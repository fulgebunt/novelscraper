Vague thunder noises resonated in the sky as lightning flashed.It felt like lightning was ready to dash through the clouds and break the sky into pieces.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Hao Ren* looked at the bad weather as he sighed; he knew that a storm was approaching. He breathed in the moist air as he paced himself towards the corner store that was about 300 meters away.If the superstore in the dorm area wasn\u2019t in renovation, if he didn\u2019t use three consecutive scissors in the rock, paper, scissors match, he won\u2019t be out here in his pajamas and slippers. He was laying on his bed reading a book, but his roommates wanted to play cards.Boom! A loud thunder sounded, and Hao Ren started to run as he tried to avoid the storm.\u201cAHAH\u2026\u201d As Hao Ren was about to speed up, he heard the scream of a girl above him.He looked up confused. He was shocked by what he saw. A girl was falling from the sky!That wasn\u2019t all. That girl was about to land on his head!\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d Hao Ren took a step back and lowered his center of gravity. He then reached out his hands and formed a perfect horse stance*.Bam!The girl smashed into Hao Ren\u2019s chest, and that force made Hao Ren lower his center of gravity by another 10 centimeters. The force was so strong that he almost collapsed.This girl\u2019s head also smashed onto Hao Ren\u2019s lips, and that impact almost made Hao Ren lose a few teeth.\u201cGulp\u2026\u201d Something dropped out of the girl\u2019s mouth, and it smoothly went down Hao Ren\u2019s throat since his mouth was still wide open due to the initial surprise.Sweet, smooth, and small\u2026 Before Hao Ren could react, this candy-like object was already in his stomach.However, Hao Ren didn\u2019t focus on that. As he was freighted and his hands were numb, he looked down at the girl in his arms.Long black lashes, short pony-tail, youthful figure, and the blue school uniform with the \u201cLingZhao Middle School\u201d badge \u2026 To be honest, the girl was pretty\u2026\u201cAh\u2026\u201d After two seconds, it seemed like she finally realized what had happened. She screamed as she opened her black eyes. She looked at Hao Ren and suddenly tried to stand back up on her own.After getting struck by the weight of the girl, Hao Ren felt like his legs were numb, He didn\u2019t know where this girl fell from. After all, there weren\u2019t any tall buildings around.After the girl stood up, she touched her body and then rubbed her lips that swelled a little. After she saw the red mark on Hao Ren\u2019s lips, she blushed and hit Hao Ren\u2019s neck.\u201cHey\u2026 I saved you\u2026\u201d Before Hao Ren could finish, the girl already ran off.\u201cGirls now days are really tough\u2026 She seems fine after falling from such a height.\u201d Hao Ren rubbed his neck as he watched the girl running away. \u201cIt\u2019s not too bad. She didn\u2019t hit me hard. Also, she didn\u2019t hit my face.\u201dHe then rubbed his lips. He couldn\u2019t remember the warm feeling of kissing that he had heard about.He was already a second-year university student, but he still didn\u2019t have a girlfriend. \u201cI\u2019m such a loser\u2026\u201d Hao Ren thought as he patted his thighs and stood up. He looked up at the sky and suddenly found that the dark clouds were all gone and even the sun had come out.\u201cDamn this weather; I thought it was going to storm.\u201d Hao Ren murmured to himself; he didn\u2019t want to get too hung up on what just happened. He quickly got to the corner store and bought two decks of cards. After that, he promptly returned to his dorm that was located in the south end of the campus.\u201cWhat took you so long? Quick, we are all waiting!\u201d After seeing Hao Ren, his three roommates shouted. (Universities in China has 4 to 8 people typically living in the same dorm room on bunker beds.)Hao Ren threw the two decks of cards onto the table and said, \u201cYou guys can play, I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d\u201cWhat is up? You are not happy?\u201d Zhao Jiayi, who was wearing a white t-shirt, asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t we agree that whoever lost would go and buy cards?\u201d He was the self-named dorm captain.\u201cI\u2019m just a little dizzy\u2026\u201d Hao Ren said as he crawled up to the upper berth that belonged to him.\u201cHey! We agreed on playing cards today!\u201d Zhao Jiayi wasn\u2019t too happy.\u201cAre you ok?\u201d Zhou Liren, another roommate, asked as he was worried about Hao Ren.\u201cNot sure, I\u2019m just not feeling too well.\u201d Hao Ren rubbed his chest as he responded. \u201cDid my organs get injured from the impact when I saved that girl?\u201d He thought.\u201cShould we\u2026 take you to the infirmary?\u201d Zhao Jiayi also got serious as he saw Hao Ren\u2019s facial expression.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I fell by accident on my way to the corner store.\u201d Hao Ren pointed at his chin that swelled a little. It was hit by that girl\u2019s head.\u201cThen get some rest. Since it is not going to rain, we are going to go to the internet cafe,\u201d Cao Ronghua, the third roommate, said.\u201cYeah, you guys go ahead.\u201d Hao Ren waved at them. He wasn\u2019t in the spirit.Zhao Jiayi was still a little worried. \u201cJust call me if you need anything,\u201d he said.\u201cOk.\u201d Hao Ren took off his slippers and got in his comfortable, cozy little bed.The four of them were all single. Except for gaming and playing cards, they didn\u2019t have any other passions. Hao Ren sighed as he fell asleep; he was exhausted for some reason.When he woke up, it was already 6 in the afternoon. There was a box of takeout food on the table; it was the dinner that the three of his roommates got for him.Through the doors, Hao Ren heard the noise of card playing in the dorm room across from his. His roommates were afraid of being loud, so they went next door.\u201cReal bros\u2026\u201d Hao Ren scratched his head as he got down from his upper berth to get the food.When he reached out his hand, he was shocked! His body froze in place. In the dark room, he saw a circle of green skin on his right wrist!Hao Ren felt like his heart stopped beating for five seconds. He opened the curtain to shed more light on his arm.A green fish scale-like tattoo covered his right arm from wrist to shoulder!Hao Ren thought he was hallucinating. He rubbed his eyes, and it was still there. He then tried to smear this green matter off of his body, but it didn\u2019t work as well.Chill\u2026 Hao Ren felt a chill down his spine. He quickly undressed and stood in front of the full-length mirror. He wanted to see if there was anything like this on other parts of his body.Creak\u2026 The door opened, and the three roommates walked in.\u201cDamn! Are you a pervert?\u201d Zhao Jiayi shouted as he saw Hao Ren who was continuously turning around in front of the mirror.\u201cNo\u2026 no\u2026\u201d Hao Ren quickly picked up his clothes and covered his body. \u201cI feel a pain in my body, and I was just checking if any other parts of my body are injured,\u201d he explained.\u201cIf you are not feeling well, we should take you to the infirmary,\u201d Zhao Jiayi frowned as he said earnestly.\u201cIt\u2019s ok. Nothing serious.\u201d Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to tell them about the weird thing happening to his skin. After all, he didn\u2019t know what was going on and how to deal with it.\u201cI think you have a desire to run naked. How about we go to the public bathhouse tonight?\u201d Zhou Liren came up and said to Hao Ren.\u201cI think it is you who has a desire to run naked!\u201d Hao Ren said back to Zhou Liren as he got dressed and covered up his arm with the sleeve.\u201cI\u2019m going to head out for a bit. You guys can chill in here now.\u201d\u201cNot going to eat?\u201d Zhao Jiayi pointed at the takeout and said, \u201cI bought it just for you!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not hungry yet!\u201d Hao Ren said as he rushed out.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDamn, is this kid in a relationship?\u201d Cao Ronghua asked after seeing Hao Ren\u2019s irregular behavior.\u201cHim? He is not as charismatic as me, he is not as fit as Zhou Liren, and he is not as handsome as you. Do you think he has a chance? If he can find a girlfriend in three years, I will give you 1,000 Yuan***!\u201d Zhao Jiayi said firmly.* Hao Ren also means a good person in Chinese.** Horse stance, A.K.A Mabu pose is a martial art pose where the practitioner stays in a half squat position for a long time to train the legs.*** Yuan is the Chinese currency.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

He waved down a taxi and was on his way to the hospital that had the best department of dermatology \u2013 Huaxi Hospital.There, Hao Ren went through a series of cumbersome administrative procedures and tiresome checkups. After, while handling a pile of reports from the equipment, the expert dermatologist determinedly told Hao Ren that the streaks on his arm were caused by a type of dye, as in the discoloration of some bad quality bed sheets.According to the reports, there was no mutation in the cells in his body. All of the results from the various tests had indicated no abnormalities. Moreover, the green color was not a result of pigmentation. As for the scale patterns, it was only accidental \u2013 the color happened to spread out in a relatively regular pattern. Most importantly, it was definitely not contagious.Although unconvincing, this explanation was enough to assure Hao Ren and calm him down temporarily.Upon receiving the reports, Hao Ren left the hospital and returned to the school. As he began forcefully scrubbing his arm with soap, he noticed that the color did seem to lighten a bit. After scaring and exhausting himself for half a day over nothing, he replaced his bed sheet with a clean one and fell into sleep.The Saturday afternoon sun shone through the curtains and found home on Hao Ren\u2019s butt.\u201cRen! Ren!\u201dAt that moment, the door of the dorm room was loudly banged on.\u201cHeck! Who is it!?\u201d Zhao Jiayi who was the occupant of the lower berth grabbed a pillow and threw it right onto the door.\u201cRen, there is a pretty girl waiting for you!\u201d On the other side of the door came the voice of Gu Jiadong who lived in dorm room 301, right across from theirs.\u201cPretty girl? Pretty girl!?\u201d As confused and dazed as he was, Zhou Liren abruptly woke up from his dream and arose to an upright position. Ever since Zhou Liren was rejected by the most popular girl at the university, he had lost the courage to pursue a relationship. However, he managed to retain his passion for admiring pretty girls.\u201cRen, get up already! Cao Ronghua told me to come and get you. Because of the pretty little girl who is waiting for you there, so many people have already gathered around the entrance of Green Hill Cafeteria! You have quite an audience!\u201d Gu Jiadong continued shouting on the other side of the door.\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Gently rubbing his slightly aching stomach, Hao Ren thought of something. As he raised his arm, the trace of the winding green marks came into sight. It did not fade away, but it did not expand either. He felt a little relieved.Thump, thump, thump! The knocking persisted.\u201cI\u2019m coming! I\u2019m coming!\u201d Hao Ren jumped off the bed and went to get the door.By this time, Zhao Jiayi who was on the lower berth could not sleep anymore and rose from his bed grudgingly. On the other hand, upon hearing the words \u201cpretty girl\u201d, Zhou Liren had already started to get dressed excitedly.\u201cSo many people have surrounded the entrance of Green Hill Cafeteria. Cao Ronghua and I were on our way to get food and thought an incident had occurred. We went over to take a look and found that it was a pretty girl waiting for someone.\u201d Seeing that Hao Ren had finally opened the door, Gu Jiadong explained feverishly.\u201cF*ck, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she is waiting for me, does it? This kind of fun is more suitable for Zhou Liren. I\u2019m not interested.\u201d Hao Ren stared at Gu Jiadong in annoyance. He had a very upset stomach yesterday and did not fall asleep until midnight. Now, being awoken by this meaningless commotion had only irked him more.\u201cLet me finish!\u201d Gu Jiadong grabbed onto Hao Ren. \u201cThat pretty girl had a portrait in her hands, and it is totally you! She said that whoever brings you to her would get awarded 500 Yuan!\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Hao Ren looked lost. He then locked his eyes on Gu Jiadong, \u201cYou are here for the 500 Yuan, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cHeehee\u2026\u201d Gu Jiadong\u2019s smile was a little too bright.At this time, a growing uproar was approaching the outside of the dorm building. Hao Ren walked over to the balcony and saw a big group of male students he was acquainted with running wildly towards his dorm room. He could tell that they were all coming after him for the reward. Therefore, he quickly threw on some clothes and shoes and followed Gu Jiadong down the stairs.As the dorm captain, Zhao Jiayi worried about any unexpected mishaps. Hence, he readily gave up the comfort of sleep, got dressed, and accompanied Hao Ren to wherever they were headed. Zhao Jiayi was closest with Hao Ren. Even though he was usually foul-mouthed and liked to bug Hao Ren a lot, he was also the one who cared about Hao Ren the most.As for Zhou Liren, he would not miss the chance of meeting pretty girls. InThe southern dorm building was situated outside the campus. As the four walked along the southern entrance and entered the campus, they saw many bulletin boards on their way, big or small \u2013 they were all filled up by wanted posters with pencil-sketched portraits of Hao Ren on them. Underneath the portraits, written in a conspicuously big font, it said, \u201c500 Yuan reward for bringing the above person to me \u2013 come to claim your reward by the entrance of the cafeteria!\u201dGoing by the number of bulletin boards there were in the school, there had to be at least a few hundreds of these posters. This was no less than the scale of being wanted nationally!\u201cWhat did you do to that girl to make her come all the way to our school to make you a wanted man!?\u201d Zhou Liren asked Hao Ren curiously as he anticipated in enthusiasm.\u201cHow am I supposed to know? I don\u2019t even know who she is!\u201d Hao Ren responded impatiently.Escorted by the big crowd, Hao Ren unwillingly walked towards the cafeteria. In a situation like this, there was simply no leeway for him.\u201cHe\u2019s coming. He\u2019s coming!\u201d Seeing that the wanted person had appeared, some students started calling out tauntingly.As a result, the previously crammed crowd had automatically split to make way for Hao Ren.Under the gazes of a few hundred people, Hao Ren awkwardly walked towards the door of the cafeteria, and\u2026 saw the pretty little girl from yesterday.She was wearing a white shirt and a pair of washed-out jeans. It was a very common outfit; yet, it looked outstanding on her. Strands of her hair were drifting in the wind. However, underneath the fluttering hair, there was an angry face.\u201cOhhh\u2026 Ohhhh\u2026\u201dSomeone started jeering.\u201cSuch a pretty little girl,\u201d Zhao Jiayi who self-claimed to have countless girlfriends whispered into Hao Ren\u2019s ear.\u201cWhen did you meet such a beautiful girl? Give us an introduction!\u201d Zhou Liren turned around and winked at Hao Ren as he said that. He was itching to have another shot with a pretty girl.Seeing that Hao Ren finally showed up, the pretty little girl pursed her lips.Suppressing the awkwardness he felt, he walked up and asked under the many piercing glances, \u201cI heard you were looking for me?\u201d\u201cDid you take something from me yesterday?\u201d Staring right into Hao Ren\u2019s eyes, the pretty little girl questioned unflinchingly.\u201cWhat? What thing?\u201d Hao Ren was not expecting this from her. He felt surprised and confused.Now that they had started their conversation, Gu Jiadong quickly came forward and interrupted them. Rubbing his hands, he said, \u201cWell\u2026\u201dThe pretty girl glanced over at him and drew out her wallet. From the purse, she took out 500 Yuan and handed it to Gu Jiadong.The students in the crowd were dumbstruck by this. They did not really believe that this little girl would fulfill the reward. Besides being shocked, they also regretted missing such a chance.Gu Jiadong held onto the money tightly and contently squeezed out of the crowd. He had no intent to take part in this commotion anymore as he was afraid the pretty girl would regret her decision in giving him the money.\u201cWhat a generous and rich little girl! No wonder she is so arrogant\u2026\u201d Hao Ren secretly thought to himself.\u201cYou! Did you take something from me yesterday?\u201d The pretty little girl continued to question Hao Ren.\u201cWhat thing?\u201d Hao Ren stared at her with eyes filled with gloom. He knew with the commotion that she has caused, he had now become \u201cfamous\u201d in the school.\u201cIt was a bead, a blue bead.\u201d She replied.\u201cI didn\u2019t see it. You must have dropped it somewhere else,\u201d Hao Ren answered without a second thought.The audience was a little disappointed by their conversation. They thought that the pretty girl had been bullied in some way and had come to seek revenge. The fact that she was only looking to recover a lost item was hardly entertaining to them.\u201cThat bead is soft and bouncy.\u201d The pretty little girl added, \u201cI\u2019ll give you two more minutes, think harder.\u201d\u201cCan we talk somewhere else?\u201d Browsing the watchful eyes surrounding them, Hao Ren couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh.\u201cJust give her back whatever you took from her! How shameless are you to steal from a pretty little girl!\u201d Craving chaos and trouble, a few male students started yelling at Hao Ren.\u201cShut up! You have no place to talk here!\u201d The pretty little girl was immediately enraged by their words.The male students went blank for a second. Although upset, it did not feel appropriate for them to lose their tempers here.\u201cThe show is over, guys! Go away already\u2026\u2026 Go!\u201d Zhao Jiayi assessed the dispute and figured that it would be a rather small one. With the help of Zhou Liren and a few other friends, they started to scatter the crowd.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euRegardless of others\u2019 actions, the pretty little girl only focused on Hao Ren. \u201cThat thing is of utmost importance to me, so I hope you can return it to me.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2026\u201d Before he could finish, the little girl put out her hand and covered his mouth.\u201cI can feel it here, right where you are.\u201d As she finished, she furrowed her brows and looked as if she was listening carefully to something.Suddenly, her hand reached for Hao Ren\u2019s stomach.As Hao Ren tried to move his belly away from her clutch, the pretty little girl abruptly clasped onto his wrist instead and rolled up his sleeve \u2013 the green colored dragon-like tattoo was revealed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedNot wanting to disclose the strange tattoo on him, Hao Ren Immediately withdrew his hand.Suddenly, the pretty little girl reached out her hand again and placed it on Hao Ren\u2019s stomach as if she was trying to feel for something.\u201cWe are in public, is it really necessary for you to be touching my stomach?\u201d Smacking her hand off, Hao Ren seemed helpless.At this time, the crowd had not completely vanished yet. Many were still waiting for more to happen. For a little girl at that age to use such startling measures to find someone in a university would make others think of all kinds of stuff.\u201cYou two, whatever your problem is, resolve it somewhere else.\u201d Since he was unable to fully break up the crowd, Zhao Jiayi was trying to find another way to help Hao Ren out. \u201cLittle girl, you have found Ren now. I think there must be some misunderstanding between you two. He is Hao Ren, what is your name?\u201d\u201cFirst off, do not call me little girl! And humph, he is a good person? I don\u2019t think he looks one bit like a good person!\u201d Glaring at Hao Ren, the pretty little girl demanded, \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving until you give me back what is mine!\u201d (Reminder, the pronunciation of \u2018Hao Ren\u2019 is very similar to the pronunciation of \u2018good person\u2019 in Mandarin Chinese.)\u201cFine, fine. Let\u2019s talk somewhere else!\u201d Hao Ren grabbed the pretty girl by her wrist and rushed towards the academic building.Since the excitement and interest had died down, no one tried to go after them. After a short while of jogging, Hao Ren let go of the pretty girl\u2019s delicate small wrist and said, \u201cOh please, why did you have to cause such a big commotion? I really didn\u2019t take anything from you.\u201d\u201cWho are you trying to fool? How do you explain the patterns on your wrist then?\u201d Her eyes locked onto Hao Ren. Her expression showed no sign of willingness to give up.\u201cThis has got to be the so-called generation gap, gotta be\u2026\u201d Looking at this unreasonable little girl who was apparently four or five years younger than him, Hao Ren felt that there was no way for him to get through to her.\u201cFirst, I did not take anything of yours. Second, I saved your life yesterday \u2013 not only were you not grateful, you hit me. Third, you alerted the whole school and caused an uproar to find me, how am I supposed to live here after this?\u201d Hao Ren argued.\u201cJust give that thing back to me and all of this will go away,\u201d she continued to stare at Hao Ren as she restated stubbornly.Her continuously repeat of the same demand had driven Hao Ren to the edge of insanity.\u201cAy\u2026 whatever. I am going to go eat.\u201d Deserting the girl, Hao Ren turned to Clear Stream Cafeteria which was closest to the academic area.However, the pretty little girl followed him closely and maintained her persistent facial expression.After he entered the cafeteria, Hao Ren stood in line to buy food. Still, the pretty little girl was stuck onto him like a nougat, following his every step.Even when Hao Ren took out his Prepaid Cafe Card to order, she had her eyes glued to him.\u201cI really don\u2019t know what to do with you\u2026\u201d Taking out his Prepaid Cafe Card again, Hao Ren sighed, \u201cChef, one more order of the beef combo, please.\u201dAs he carried his tray of food to the table, the pretty little girl also carried her tray and followed right behind him.As he sat down, she sat down right across from him.She was now copying his every move. She would take a bite of the food if he did; and when he stopped eating, so did she.\u201cBig sister\u2026 I\u2019ll call you big sister, how is that? I really, really did not take anything from you.\u201d Hao Ren couldn\u2019t help but look at her helplessly. He certainly did not expect such trouble to stem from his attempt to save a life.\u201cYour tattoo is saying otherwise. It is the best proof for what you took.\u201d Refusing to take her eyes off Hao Ren for even a second, the pretty little girl insisted.\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cWell, I can\u2019t state my reasoning with you\u2026 Anyway, I know for a fact that you have my bead. Which pocket did you put it in? It should be close to your stomach, right? Humph, you\u2019d better not make me search you.\u201d She asserted.\u201cSearch me? How is such a little girl talking so big?\u2026\u201d Hao Ren shot her a glance and carried on with his meal.It also seemed that she had starved herself while waiting for Hao Ren this morning as she devoured her meal at a fast speed.Seizing the chance, Hao Ren raised his head and observed her quietly. He found that the white shirt she was wearing was not a common white shirt. Even though the shirt indicated vigorous spirit of a middle-schooler overall, it was more of a retro style shirt. The lace knot on her chest was butterfly-like and adorned her petite body perfectly.Also, the bottom of her shirt was tucked into her jeans, displaying a nice contour of her slim waist. Along with her idyllic style floral patterned wooden sandals, Hao Ren was convinced that this girl must have come from an extraordinary background.Particularly, for someone who was at the age of a middle-schooler, her casual gesture of throwing out 500 Yuan so carelessly was definitely not a common gesture among ordinary middle-schoolers.At this moment, the pretty little girl abruptly lifted her head. She seemed to have noticed that Hao Ren was studying her. To conceal his interest and thoughts, Hao Ren quickly put his head down.Needless to say, the appearance of such an adorable little girl in a university cafeteria had attracted attention from many of the university students.\u201cAy, they must just think this is my little sister\u2026\u201d Hao Ren reassured himself.\u201cYou\u2019d better leave as soon as you finish eating. Since you came all the way here by yourself, your parents must be worried,\u201d Hao Ren said to her.\u201cAs long as you return to me what is mine, I will be able to go home with ease. I\u2019m warning you, if my parents find out what I have lost and decide to come to you for it themselves, you will be in very serious trouble.\u201d With her eyes on Hao Ren, she suddenly spoke in a calm and mellow manner.Nonetheless, her words obviously hinted at the underlying threat.This time, her remarks almost caused Hao Ren to break down. He honestly had no clue what she was talking about. \u201cKids at this age, whatever small matters they run into, always like to involve their parents so they could just conveniently hide behind them. With that being said, if her parents do get involved, this would become a very sticky business for me.\u201d Thoughts were running wild in his head.Yet, Hao Ren still didn\u2019t think that he had taken anything that was hers. He came out with nothing on him yesterday. After the encounter with her, all he brought back to the dorm were two decks of cards.As for the bead that she kept on babbling about, Hao Ren was wearing pocketless pajamas and a pair of slippers at the time. How could he have possibly brought anything away with him? She must have dropped it somewhere else.As for the round of green patterns on his skin, they were an allergic reaction resulted from his overconsumption of seafood from a while ago according to the doctor.However, judging from her stubborn character, he was afraid that her family would also believe that he had taken something from her. By then, there would be no way for him to explain himself anymore. Thinking of this, Hao Ren felt that he was developing a mild headache over the trouble he got himself into from trying to save someone.\u201cStop following me. I said I didn\u2019t take anything from you, and that means I didn\u2019t take anything from you. Even if you get your parents to come with you, I would still say the same thing,\u201d Hao Ren declared as he stood up and grabbed his tray.After that, he returned the tray and walked out of the cafeteria.

He was relieved that he finally got rid of her.\u201cYou will come to me yourself.\u201d standing outside the passage, the pretty little girl confidently stated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the end, he borrowed a few books that he found were relevant and walked out of the library.As he expected, the little girl was nowhere in sight when he got outLooking up at the gloomy sky, Hao Ren was still thinking about this whole incident involving the little girl. He wondered if he\u2019d be doomed next week.If her parents really came to see him about it, how annoying would that be\u2026 It was completely her own fault for losing her belonging. Yet, she blamed him for it just so she could shirk any responsibility of her own.When he returned to the dorm room, his roommates were all concerned with the cause and the aftermath of the incident. However, all Hao Ren told them was that it was smoothly resolved and did not go into any details. He didn\u2019t want to drag his roommates into something so troublesome and annoying.\u201cThe little girl is very pretty though. Just give her a few years, she\u2019ll definitely become the most popular girl in any school.\u201d Zhao Jiayi sighed in admiration while patting Hao Ren\u2019s shoulder as he tried to comfort him.Sure, she was pretty, but she was also a huge troublemaker. Therefore, the smart thing to do would be to avoid any contact with her.\u201cDidn\u2019t you have to go home this week? Did you finish looking up all the information you needed?\u201d Zhao Jiayi asked.\u201cYep, I am just getting ready to leave for home now.\u201d Hao Ren placed the books he borrowed from the library onto the desk and took out another empty backpack.\u201cCome back earlier tomorrow, so we can play cards in the evening!\u201d Again, Zhao Jiayi patted Hao Ren\u2019s shoulder while instilling a friendly reminder.\u201cSure, I will. Thanks for your help today. \u201d Hao Ren waved to his dormmates as he left.On the bus home, Hao Ren couldn\u2019t help but roll up his sleeve to examine his wrist again.The green marks were very much like dragon scales. Thanks to his mighty scrubbing, the color had lightened a lot.He imagined if his grandma saw this, she would surely think he had been hanging out with the wrong crowd in school and got himself a tattoo\u2026 Hao Ren let out a heavy sigh. As he opened the window, a cool breeze came in and lightly caressed his face. Gradually, he fell asleep.When Hao Ren woke up, the bus had already traveled for more than an hour \u2013 he was almost home.Sleepy and dazed, he grabbed his backpack and got off the bus. He started walking along a wide concrete path.From time to time, there were expensive and fancy cars driving by him. In contrast, as he was carrying a backpack and walking on foot, Hao Ren seemed a little miserable.It took him exactly thirty minutes to walk to an area where there were houses.If Hao Ren\u2019s classmates had seen this, they would definitely be astounded. Hao Ren\u2019s home was actually located in the harbor area which had the finest views of the ocean in East Ocean City. Moreover, embedded among the group of cottages, his house was the seemingly ordinary looking two-story cottage that was only two hundred meters away from the beach.\u201cGrandma!\u201d Feeling a little exhausted, Hao Ren shouted as he pushed open a carved-through iron gate.\u201cRen, you\u2019re back!\u201d A kind and benign looking elder came out of the house and welcomed Hao Ren with an everlasting smile. \u201cHow come you are so late today?\u201d\u201cHeehee, I have an assignment that is due next week, so I had to look up some more information before I could leave.\u201d Following his grandma inside the house, Hao Ren asked, \u201cHow was your week, grandma?\u201d\u201cBusiness as usual \u2013 did some cleaning around the house, took some walks along the beach, tended to the flowers and lawn, and did some stock trading as well. Uncle Wang is off this weekend. Let grandma show off her cooking this time,\u201d grandma answered with a chuckle.\u201cStock trading? How much did you earn this week?\u201d Hao Ren inquired lightheartedly.\u201cIt is not a business where you can just make money every week. In fact, I lost 6000 Yuan this week. But you know, this is not what Grandma cares about nowadays. Actually, there was news from Norway, your parents are about to finish their expedition and might be able to come home next month.\u201d Grandma explained to Hao Ren as she walked into the kitchen.\u201cOh, next month? That is soon.\u201d Hao Ren followed her into the kitchen to help out.Actually, they had hired a cook \u2013 Uncle Wang. It was so that someone could cook for Grandma and keep her company here in the cottage. As Hao Ren\u2019s parents were abroad and Hao Ren had to go to school during the week, it could get boring and lonely for Grandma.However, Uncle Wang had to go home this weekend due to some family business. Therefore, although there was not much to do at home for Hao Ren, he had to come home to make sure his grandma had company.Besides his parents who were elusive and rarely home, he was closest to his grandma.\u201cGrandma, there is a question I have been thinking about today.\u201d While cutting up vegetables, Hao Ren asked, \u201cdo you think dragons exist?\u201d\u201cDragons?\u201d Grandma seemed to be interested in such topic. Her eyes lit up as she thought, \u201cApparently, some residents of East Ocean City had had encounters with dragons here back in the days.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Hao Ren was now genuinely engaged as well.\u201cYes. Actually, I had an encounter myself. I was young then, in my 20s. One day, I was working in the field, and a storm had come upon us out of nowhere. A good friend of mine and I were trying to find a place to shelter ourselves. It was then that I saw a chunk of awfully thick cloud suddenly descend to a low altitude\u2026\u201dAlong with his grandma\u2019s story, Hao Ren felt as though his heart had been suspending in midair. He urged, \u201cThen what, Grandma? Keep going!\u201d\u201cWell, at the time, I saw a flash of dragon-shaped lightning protrude out of the cloud and swam across the sky for a bit. I was terrified. I later thought it was an illusion. Yet, when I thought of it more, the cloud was greyish to white, very different from the other clouds in the sky which were pitch-black.\u201d Grandma seemed deeply lost in thought as she recalled the incident.\u201cLightning\u2026 I guess it was a natural phenomenon after all,\u201d Hao Ren stated.\u201cThat was what your father said to me as well. But you know, he never had any interest or tolerance for supernatural phenomena. However, that good friend of mine later told me that she indeed saw a white dragon come out of the cloud and start sucking up water from the lake. She also saw a broad spout of water ascend skyward from the lake. I asked if it was true, and she said she was absolutely sure about it and would never lie to me.\u201dGrandma\u2019s description was so vivid and detailed that it was giving Hao Ren goosebumps.If dragons really did exist, then\u2026\u201cWhy did you want to ask about dragons all of a sudden?\u201d Snapping out of her reminiscence, Grandma asked Hao Ren.\u201cOh, I was just curious.\u201d Retracting his surprised expression, Hao Ren lowered his head and continued chopping vegetables.\u201cHere in East Ocean City, it is said that many people have seen dragons in the past. Also, according to legends from the past, there was supposedly a dragon palace nearby. Allegedly, East Ocean City got its name for this reason,\u201d Grandma added.\u201cLike the East Ocean Dragon Palace from the legends?\u201d Hao Ren turned and asked.\u201cHaha, maybe.\u201d As she finished washing the vegetables, Grandma placed them into the pot.\u201cHow come we don\u2019t see dragons anymore then?\u201d Hao Ren inquired.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt could be due to the change of environment. With the deterioration of the environment, many creatures have gone extinct.\u201d Grandma\u2019s response had left Hao Ren speechless.Just like that, the two chatted intermittently about various topics and finished dinner. After watching TV together for a while, they went to their beds respectively.After he went to his room, Hao Ren had trouble sleeping. He opened the window and gazed up at the splendid starry sky. Coupled with the sound of waves from far away, he thought about the story that his grandmother told him earlier. He had developed an intense desire to find out whether dragons existed in this world or not.Lifting his wrist, the green colored imprint was still evident on his arm. The more he looked at it, the more he felt that the pattern resembled dragon scales.\u201cAy, I\u2019m probably overthinking this\u2026\u201d He closed the window, turned off the light, and proceeded to sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He did some exercises and cooked breakfast for his grandma. Then he took a walk along the beach with her in the pleasant sunny morning.\u201cRen, you been looking much more energetic these days.\u201d Grandma said to Hao Ren kindly in the sea breeze.\u201cMy appetite got bigger than before as well.\u201d Hao Ren smiled.\u201cHehe, are you seeing someone at the university?\u201d Grandma smiled and asked.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Hao Ren denied.\u201cYou must have. Did you forget your grandma knows anthroposcopy? You seem to have good luck with women lately.\u201d Grandma chuckled.\u201cStudying is my priority at the university. How can I start dating?\u201d Hao Ren said pretentiously.\u201cThat\u2019s your father\u2019s opinion. I, on the other hand, encourage my Ren to date. Bring her to grandma if she is a nice girl.\u201d Grandma\u2019s smile spread warmth like a sunflower.\u201cAlright, I will bring her to you as soon as I get a girlfriend,\u201d Hao Ren promised seriously which made grandma\u2019s smile even brighter.The two of them watched the ocean on a reef for a while before Hao Ren and his grandma headed back slowly.He picked up many little shells along the way and put them in his pocket.\u201cYou\u2019ve collected a lot of shells growing up, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Grandma turned over and asked.\u201cAs souvenirs.\u201d Hao Ren threw a shell high up in the air and caught it.\u201cHmm, Ren, you been fond of the ocean ever since you were a little boy. Therefore, your heart is as vast as the ocean.\u201d Grandma praised him as she stamped on to the soft sand with her cloth shoes. She then murmured to herself, \u201cYou are also filial and kind. How come no girl is into you? Ah! When shall I see my great grandson\u2026?\u201dHao Ren did not see through his grandma\u2019s sneaky thoughts. He thought she was just missing her son. He stayed with her for another while after he had walked her back to the house. Then he started to pack up for school.Grandma stuffed his backpack with all kinds of snacks and local products, making his bag bulge a lot more than it used to be.\u201cBring it to school and share it with your classmates. I like Zhao Jiayi and those young fellows.\u201d she walked Hao Ren to the door and urged.\u201cOk, I know. You take care of yourself, grandma.\u201d He threw the heavy bag onto his back and started his journey.The people here all transited in their own vehicles. Due to the small number of residences here, there weren\u2019t any bus stops. The closest one was located near a tourist attraction. Hao Ren had to march for half an hour before arriving at the bus stop. It was like a full cardio workout for him.Hao Ren thought to himself on the bus, \u201cIt was a pretty pleasant weekend.\u201d The bus headed towards the city in the salty sea wind.Sure enough, Hao Ren started to distribute his snacks as soon as he arrived at school. It would take him over two weeks to finish them all by himself. The reason why grandma packed so many snacks for him every time was to let him share them with his friends.\u201cGrandma is the best. Should I find a girlfriend to cheer her up?\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself as he handed out the snacks.The strange thing was, unlike before, he didn\u2019t feel tired after carrying these things for half an hour. Hao Ren tested his wrist strength secretively and found himself lifting the table up a few centimeters from the ground with only one hand.He asked in doubt, \u201cZhou Liren, didn\u2019t you say you want to arm wrestle with me last time?\u201dZhou Liren was opening up a pack of chips in excitement. He turned around immediately. \u201cWhy, you want to arm wrestle with me?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s give it a go,\u201d Hao Ren sat at the table.\u201cDamn, did I not defeat you hard enough last time? I will only use half of my strength for the sake of all the snacks you have brought.\u201d Zhou Liren put the chips down and sat opposite to Hao Ren.Hao Ren\u2019s physical strength was in fact not bad. His leg strength was very strong due to his constant jogs. That was why he was able to catch the falling little girl last time without falling down.However, he hadn\u2019t practiced upper body strength in particular, and that was why he always lost to the 180-centimeters tall Zhou Liren in arm wrestling.They got into position and grasped each other\u2019s palm. Seeing this, some students from next door and the surrounding dorm rooms who were here for the snacks gathered around them.\u201cLet me show you what an Instant Kill is!\u201d Zhou Liren rolled up his sleeves in confidence.Considering the \u201cgreen tattoo\u201d on his arm, Hao Ren did not roll his sleeves up.\u201cThree, Two, One!\u201d As the judge, Zhao Jiayi let go of their gripped hands.\u201cAh!\u201d Zhou Liren shouted as he gathered all his strength.Bom! His arm was pressed onto the table immediately.Everyone was surprised to see this.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t count, that doesn\u2019t count. I wasn\u2019t ready yet!\u201d he waved his hands and said, \u201cYou started before I even sat still. That was cheating.\u201dHao Ren appeared calm although he felt astonished. Only he knew what was going on in his head.\u201cOne more time!\u201d Zhou Liren gripped Hao Ren\u2019s palm as he wasn\u2019t willing to admit defeat.\u201cThree, Two, One!\u201d Zhao Jiayi let go of their arms again.It was a tight match this time around. Zhou Liren gradually applied his full strength. His face turned red as blue veins popped out of his arm and forehead. He slowly took the upper hand.Bom! Hao Ren\u2019s arm got pushed onto the table.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhou Liren jumped up and cheered as he rubbed his sore arm. \u201cYour arm strength has improved, buddy!\u201d\u201cStill couldn\u2019t beat you,\u201d Hao Ren smiled bitterly, \u201cAlright, alright, let\u2019s split the snacks up.\u201d\u201cSnacks! Snacks! You took my chips, Gu Jiadong!\u201d The winner Zhou Liren jumped up and grasped Gu Jiadong in excitement.Hao Ren glimpsed at them and walked to the balcony in silence.\u201cI didn\u2019t use my full strength just now, yet I was able to defeat Zhou Liren with ease. Then I decreased my strength on purpose so he could win the tight match. That was a horrifying increase in my strength from last week\u2019s arm wrestling match\u2026\u201d Hao Ren looked up at the moon with uneasiness as he rubbed his wrist.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedUnder the moonlight, the dragon-scale tattoo on Hao Ren\u2019s arm started to become lighter after several washes. It seemed like it was glowing and had a mysterious power.\u201cThe legend about the dragon that my grandma talked about wouldn\u2019t be true, would it?\u201d\u201cRen! Come play cards!\u201d Zhao Jiayi yelled, waking Hao Ren up from deep thoughts.After playing cards for almost the entire night, the weekend had passed. It would be Monday when they open their eyes again.\u201cRen, I heard you were flirting with a girl and now she is hunting you down?\u201d\u201cI heard this girl is pretty crazy, putting up wanted posters all over the school. Ah, too bad I went home on Saturday\u2026\u201d\u201cI was in the cafeteria. The girl is pretty, and she even touched Ren\u2019s belly!\u201d\u201cHey, Ren. What did you do to that little girl?\u201d\u201cStop accusing Ren, he is a good guy\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, Hao Ren is a good guy! He has gotten the Goodperson Card (friend zoned) six times already within this semester!\u201dPeople inside the classroom were discussing with each other during class. Everyone was talking about the girl who came to school to find Hao Ren with great fanfare last Saturday, making it the hottest topic this week.Hao Ren did not bother to join the conversation. The comfort of the warm sunlight was making him a little drowsy.He occasionally looked up and watched Class President Xie Yujia who was sitting in the front. She seemed like she cared a bit more than the others about what had happened. However, she immediately avoided eye contacts with Hao Ren whenever he looked at her.Hao Ren wanted to explain to her that he wasn\u2019t a player, it was he friends who caused everything. Whenever he told his friends about a girl who he found pretty, his friends would confess his \u2018admirations\u2019 for him under his name and increased his record of getting the Goodperson Card.Obviously, Xie Yujia was also one of those who gave him the Goodperson Card.\u201cMaybe I should ask her to go to the beach with me? Grandma will probably like a beautiful girl like her.\u201d\u201cBut last time when Zhou Liren was messing around for me, she already said she wasn\u2019t interested in me\u2026\u201d When thoughts of that rose up, Hao Ren sighed and continued to sleep on the desk.The boring afternoon class finally ended. Hao Ren woke up from a blurry dream and felt the numbness in his right arm.When he was trying to get rid of the numbness by moving his right arm around, he realized that his right arm had become much thicker!Because of his long-sleeve shirt, Zhao Jiayi and others did not notice the changes in his arm. However, Hao Ren could clearly feel that his right arm was swelling!After thinking about the weird tattoo, the arrogant little girl, and the sudden increase in strength, Hao Ren found some connections between all of them. He stood up quickly, hesitated for a moment, and then rushed out of the classroom.\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Zhou Liren and the other two who were packing their bags and were about to go get dinner suddenly saw Hao Ren\u2019s hurried departure and did not know what to do.Hao Ren rushed out of the classroom and walked ceaselessly until he flagged down a taxi outside the school.\u201cMister, go to LingZhao Middle School. Quick!\u201d Hao Ren hopped into the car and said anxiously.\u201cAlright!\u201d The taxi driver drove quickly. Within ten minutes, Ren has arrived at the main entrance of LingZhao Middle School.The middle school students were just leaving school when he arrived. Students wearing uniforms started walking out of the gate like water tides.Hao Ren was standing on a high fence on his tiptoes. He was trying to find a trace of that little girl.However, all the students were wearing the same light blue uniforms and their ages were about the same. Hao Ren\u2019s eyes got tired and his head got dizzy, yet he still hasn\u2019t found the girl.\u201cUncle, you trying to find me?\u201d Suddenly, a bright voice appeared right behind Hao Ren.Hao Ren turned around and saw the young girl he had been trying to find.She was wearing the same light-blue uniform, had the same ponytail, and the same LingZhao Middle School Tag as the other students. The only thing that was different was the name tag on her uniform \u2013 Grade 2, Class 2, Zhao Yanzi.There was another girl right next to her. Even though that girl wasn\u2019t as pretty as her, she was from the same grade and class.Hao Ren was a bit embarrassed as he jumped off the fence, \u201cUm\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you, you would come find me.\u201d This girl whose name was Zhao Yanzi said confidently and proudly.Zi, who is he?\u201d the girl next the Zhao Yanzi asked quietly while looking at Hao Ren cautiously.\u201cAn uncle from East Ocean University. He owes me something,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said to that girl.Uncle\u2026 Hao Ren felt like his brain split into halves when he heard what they called him.After hearing the response, the girl beside Zhao Yanzi was still cautious about Hao Ren.\u201cCome on, do I look like a bad guy? I think my face looks pretty kind and harmless\u2026\u201d Hao Ren looked at that girl resignedly.\u201cYour name is Zi?\u201d Hao Ren asked Zhao Yanzi as he tried to break the awkward moment.Zhao Yanzi pointed at her name tag.\u201cUncle, what\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked Hao Ren.\u201cMy name is Hao Ren,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cUsually those who call themselves good person aren\u2019t really good.\u201d The girl next Zhao Yanzi said.\u201cLing, you can go home first. I still have some things I want to talk to this uncle about. I won\u2019t be able to go home with you today.\u201d Zhao Yanzi said to the girl next to her.\u201cOkay\u2026 Be careful\u2026\u201d the girl looked at Hao Ren cautiously again and reminded Zi worryingly.\u201cUncle, isn\u2019t it too late to come find me now?\u201d Seeing Ling walking further away, Zhao Yanzi looked at Hao Ren and said.\u201cDon\u2019t call me uncle, just call me Ren.\u201d Hao Ren\u2019s head was about to explode.\u201cAlright, uncle,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said.Hao Ren was speechless.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you came to find me. But sorry, it\u2019s too late already. My parents already know I lost the stuff. Wait to bear the anger of my father.\u201dHao Ren was a bit angry with this arrogant little girl. However, he held back.\u201cWait for it. My parents will come find you themselves tomorrow.\u201d After Zhao Yanzi finished speaking, she grabbed her pink backpack and ran away. She didn\u2019t even wait for Hao Ren\u2019s reaction.Hao Ren stood there speechlessly. \u201cSure.\u201d Ren thought, \u201cTell your parents to come. See who is more afraid of who!\u201d He gritted his teeth as he went back to the university and went straight to his dorm to sleep; he wasn\u2019t even in the mood to have dinner.\u201cRen seems emotional, like a lovesick teenager.\u201d\u201cIs this because of the pretty little girl?\u201d\u201cNo way, Ren likes that pretty little girl?\u201d\u201cOr maybe this is because of Xie Yujia?\u201d\u201cRen really likes the Class President?\u201d\u201cIt is so obvious alright?\u201d\u201cShould we help him?\u201dHao Ren\u2019s dormmates started chatting when they saw Hao Ren sleeping in his bed when they came back.The next day, Hao Ren tried to act cheerful when he went to class. The tattoo disappeared entirely, but his entire arm was very swollen. The veins were popping as if the arm was filled with power but had nowhere to release it. It was extremely unnatural.Hao Ren\u2019s three dormmates saw his miserable look and thought he was upset because of the girls. Therefore, they spent half a day with him trying to cheer him up.On the other hand, Hao Ren was in a bad mood every time he thought of Zhao Yanzi\u2019s parents. Perhaps they might even bring the matters to the university\u2019s administrative office.During class, Zhao Jiayi went over to Zhou Liren and Cao Ronghua. \u201cAfter all, Ren is really heart-broken. He was never this cold before.\u201d\u201cYeah, seems like his soul is out of his body today. Maybe we should take him to lunch and try to cheer him up,\u201d Cao Ronghua said as the class-end bell started ringing.Cao Ronghua and Zhou Liren dragged Hao Ren up and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go! Ren! We will buy you lunch!\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t feel like eating\u2026\u201d Hao Ren said while he was dragged out of the classroom. As he was wondering when the administrative office was going to call him, a black object entered his eyesight.All he saw was a black Mercedes Benz S-Class Sedan that was parked at the school\u2019s main entrance and two middle-aged men with black suits and white gloves standing next to the car.Many students gathered at the gate of the school, wanting to find out which rich kid these two were waiting for. It was important to know that the East Ocean University was mainly for normal citizens, even though there were some rich kids who attend this university. Nevertheless, East Ocean University was definitely not a school for the nobles.Cao Ronghua and the others dragged Hao Ren over to see what was happening. Unexpectedly, the two men rushed towards Hao Ren and said, \u201cYou are finally done with classes. Our master has been waiting.\u201dWith this sudden change, Cao Ronghua and Zhou Liren were shocked. They let go of Hao Ren as they realized that Hao Ren was the person these two men in black suits were looking for.The students around were all discussing with each other. If what happened at the cafeteria on Saturday was big \u201cnews\u201d already, two men with a S-Class Mercedes Benz coming here to find Hao Ren would be a \u201cbreaking news\u201d.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSo Hao Ren\u2019s family is rich\u2026\u201d\u201cMaybe they aren\u2019t Hao Ren\u2019s family. Look at his reaction, he was obviously shocked.\u201dThose who knew Hao Ren but weren\u2019t extremely close to him discussed the matter the most.\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d Hao Ren looked at the two men confusedly.\u201cOur master, who is also Ms. Zi\u2019s father, sent us to come pick you up. We will only take up an afternoon. Please get in the car.\u201d the two men bowed gently to Hao Ren and said politely as they opened the car door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had thought Zhao Yanzi and her parents would go directly to the administrative office. To his astonishment, a sedan was sent to pick him up.\u201cMaybe, is it an invitation to my own funeral, or a disguised kidnap?\u201d\u201cWhatever it is, I don\u2019t think they will harm me.\u201d After a moment of consideration, Hao Ren stepped into the car.Bang! Bang!The car doors closed.His three dormmates stared at the luxury sedan in astonishment. From what they knew about him, Hao Ren came from an ordinary background. They wondered what he had done to be taken away like this.The black sedan drove out of campus without incidents.On the way, Hao Ren restrained himself from asking the men sitting on either side of him any questions, He believed that he would get answers when he got to the destination.While the sedan drove forward smoothly, a sense of heroic tragedy rose in him as if he would never come back.After about half an hour of traveling through half of East Ocean City, the car came to the busy downtown.A skyscraper with seventy floors came into Hao Ren\u2019s view. On top of the building, there was a huge sign with two large words in it\u2013Mingri Group.Listed on NASDAQ in the United States, Mingri Group was one of the biggest business groups in China and undoubtedly a business empire in East Ocean City.\u201cSir, please get off the car.\u201d When the sedan stopped at the gate of the skyscraper, the two men got off and opened the door for Hao Ren.Glancing up at the skyscraper, Hao Ren was a bit dizzy. After he got off the car, he was ushered into the building by one of the men.The receptionist, as beautiful as a movie star, glanced at the men and smiled. She didn\u2019t ask them to register and opened the security pathway for them.Hao Ren was suddenly struck with a wave of nervousness.The man led Hao Ren into an elevator before pressing on number 75, the top floor of the building.The elevator rode up speedily while Hao Ren stared at the serious man silently.\u201cWho on earth is these men\u2019s \u2018master\u2019? Who can work in a place like this?\u201dDing!The elevator reached the top floor.The gates of the elevator slid open, and Hao Ren was greeted with bright red rugs, a golden lobby, and magnificent chandeliers\u2026The lobby was as luxurious as a five-star hotel.The man was still silent when he led Hao Ren out of the elevator and ushered him forward.He stopped outside of an office room with a sign that read \u201cPresident\u2019s Office\u201d.Knocking on the door, he raised his voice, \u201cMaster, here he is.\u201d\u201cBring him in.\u201d a dignified but fatigued voice came from the room.The man opened the door and ushered Hao Ren into the room.A big magnificent office room with an area of at least 200 square meters came into Hao Ren\u2019s viewA man with a crew cut and a square face locked his intense eyes on Hao Ren.Also, he was flanked by four serious-looking men who were all in black suits.\u201cIs it on him?\u201d He asked the man who had ushered in Hao Ren.\u201cIt is. I can feel it,\u201d the man answered carefully.\u201cZi told me everything. I won\u2019t cause trouble for you if you hand it over now,\u201d the man who seemed to be the president gazed at Hao Ren and said.\u201cI don\u2019t have it,\u201d grinding his teeth, Hao Ren said.Without further ado, the square-faced man spat out two words, \u201cSearch him.\u201dFour men jumped out and quickly grabbed Hao Ren\u2019s arms and shoulders while the man who brought Hao Ren here began to search him in a very professional manner.Hao Ren knew he had fallen into the \u201ctiger\u2019s den\u201d, but he was sure they could do nothing to him when they found nothing on him.As he predicted, the man found nothing when he finished the first round of searching. When he began the second round, his smooth movements became stiff.He raised his head with alarm, \u201cMaster\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve told you many times not to call me Master. Call me Boss!\u201d The square-faced man was incensed.\u201cYes. Boss.\u201d The man pointed at Hao Ren, \u201cThe thing\u2026from Ms. Zi is in his stomach.\u201dThe square-faced man froze while the others\u2019 faces also changed expressions.\u201cSummon the elders.\u201d After some considerations, the square-faced man ordered.\u201cYes!\u201d Eight of the nine men in the room walked out, and only one was left standing beside the square-faced man.\u201cPick up Zi from the school.\u201d The Square-faced man told the man beside him.\u201cYes!\u201d The man took the order and was out of the room immediately.Now only Hao Ren and the square-faced man were left in the room.\u201cMy name is Zhao Guang. What is your name?\u201d The square-faced man gazed at Hao Ren and asked.\u201cHao Ren,\u201d Hao Ren answered.\u201cAh, Hao Ren, Good Person. This matter got tricky, and you have to stay here a little longer,\u201d he continued, still looking at Hao Ren\u201cOk.\u201d Hao Ren\u2019s face didn\u2019t show the confusion he felt. He couldn\u2019t remain calm while there was some object in his stomach, especially when the object seemed to be related to the tattoo.\u201cTake a seat.\u201d Zhao Guang pointed at the seats beside him.Hao Ren walked over and sat on a leather sofa. Through the glass of the room, he had a complete view of East Ocean City and even a glimpse of the sea in the distance.They kept silent while time clicked away.About half hour later, people began to hurry in. They all looked confused and anxious.A little later, accompanied by a man, Zhao Yanzi walked in.When she saw Hao Ren, she snorted with contempt. Of course, Hao Ren responded likewise.\u201cZi, don\u2019t make that expression. It was all your fault,\u201d Zhao Guang scolded Zhao Yanzi.Zhao Yanzi pursed her lips, looking defiant.Shortly, more than a dozen people came into the big office room.\u201cSince everyone is here, let\u2019s go in for the meeting. Zi, come in too,\u201d after looking around, Zhao Guang said with a serious expression.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA hidden door opened automatically, and a small meeting room that was connected to the office room was revealed.While people began to walk into the meeting room, Zhao Guang turned to Hao Ren and said, \u201cPlease sit here for a while and wait for the results of the meeting.\u201dHao Ren had no choice but to nod his head in agreement. After all, it was not a good feeling when you had an unnamed object in your stomach.He hoped those people could find a way to take the bead out of him without surgery.Alone in the spacious and luxurious office, he looked down at the city, feeling like he was sitting on the clouds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some of them looked puzzled about the situation while others had grim expressions on their faces since they had known about the reason for this meeting.\u201cThe reason I summoned you to this meeting is that Zi lost her internal core to a mortal.\u201d Zhao Guang was the first to speak.Upon hearing this information, many of them looked at each other in astonishment.\u201cLast Saturday was Zi\u2019s first time creating the rainfall. Elder Lu was supposed to assist her, but Zi, not liking the supervision, left Elder Lu to practice on her own. That was how the misfortune happened.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do my job. Dragon\u2026Boss, please punish me!\u201d Panicked, the elderly with white eyebrows and white hair was about to leave his seat and kneel.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. Zi is too stubborn, a result of my spoiling.\u201d Zhao Guang glanced at Zhao Yanzi before looking around. \u201cThe problem is that Zi\u2019s internal core is in someone else\u2019s hands.\u201d\u201cIf some mortal took it, we can just take it back,\u201d a man with bushy eyebrows and big eyes suggested.\u201cIf it was that simple, I wouldn\u2019t have summoned you here. Something unexpected happened: the mortal swallowed Zi\u2019s internal core,\u201d Zhao Guang continued after a pause.This piece of information stunned everyone at the meeting, including Zhao Yanzi.\u201cHow is that possible? The internal core of our tribe\u2026\u201d Someone questioned the possibility immediately.\u201cZi\u2019s internal core has not matured and is very small. When it fell from the sky, it dropped into the mortal\u2019s mouth by accident,\u201d Zhao Guang explained in a steady voice.Looking at each other, the elders began to talk in low voices.\u201cA mortal swallowing an internal core has not happened in the past thousands of years\u2026\u201d\u201cIs the person a cultivator in the mortal world since this mortal has not exploded after swallowing the internal core\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are almost no cultivators left after the last bunch flew up from here 300 years ago. Maybe only two or three are still living in the mortal world\u2026\u201d\u201cThe fact that the mortal has not exploded should be due to the weak power of Ms. Zi\u2019s internal core\u2026\u201dThey talked in whispers for at least two minutes before they quieted down gradually.\u201cElders, how do you think we should solve this problem?\u201d Zhao Guang asked when they stopped talking.\u201cThis matter is quite serious. Although Ms. Zi will not be in danger in the near future, without her internal core, she will not be able to cultivate and can\u2019t transform into a dragon. Besides, according to the ancient records, members of our tribe can\u2019t live more than five years after the loss of their internal core before maturity even if he or she is healthy,\u201d after some consideration, Elder Lu with white eyebrows and white hair said.\u201cDoes it mean Zi will not live beyond 20 if she can\u2019t retrieve her internal core?\u201d Zhao Guang asked.\u201cShe may extend her life or even grow another internal core with the help of miracle herbs of nature, but Ms. Zi is too precious to take the risk,\u201d Elder Lu warned.\u201cIs it in the stomach of the mortal sitting outside?\u201d That man with bushy eyebrows and big eyes stood up abruptly. \u201cIt\u2019s simple! Bring him in here and cut open his stomach. We\u2019ll get the internal core back!\u201dZhao Guang remained silent, he looked livid.\u201cElder Zhao, it\u2019s been 200 years, and you are still hot-tempered,\u201d the woman sitting next to the man said disapprovingly.\u201cZi\u2019s life is at risk here, and the mortal is just an ant!\u201d Elder Zhao shouted.At his outburst, some other elders seemed to be nodding.\u201cKill him and dump his body into the sea. No one would know,\u201d Elder Zhao continued.Hearing this plan, the elders who were about to nod began to frown.Ignoring Elder Zhao, Zhao Guang turned to the other elders, \u201cHow about other elders? Do you have any other suggestions?\u201dSulkily, Elder Zhao sat down and turned to ask the woman next to him, \u201cWas I wrong?\u201d\u201cThe boss had told us to learn to be modern people. It\u2019s been hundreds of years now, and you still act and speak like a gangster. I wonder how you can survive the Heavenly Tribulation this year!\u201d The woman glanced at him in.\u201cI\u2019m just all words and no action. You know I never kill.\u201d Elder Zhao smiled embarrassedly.\u201cShut up and listen to the other elders.\u201d The woman still gave him a disapproving look.Meanwhile, another white-haired elder stood up, \u201cThere is one solution that can both keep the mortal alive and help Ms. Zi survive the crisis.\u201dWith a wave of his big hand, Zhao Guang said, \u201cTell us!\u201dHowever, the elder hesitated for several seconds before saying, \u201cBut\u2026I don\u2019t know if I should say it.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing you can\u2019t say. Say whatever you want, and I won\u2019t punish you,\u201d Zhao Guang encouraged.\u201cUmm, fine.\u201d The elderly nodded. \u201cIn fact, if the mortal can absorb the dragon core and gain some degree of cultivation, he can transfer some dragon essence to Ms. Zi to sustain her vital essence.\u201d\u201cNow let\u2019s put aside the problem that a mortal might not be able to cultivate using our techniques. Even if your plan works, what should we do when Zi is 20 years old, five years later?\u201d\u201cThen\u2026the dragon core will be strong and big enough, and he can share half of it with Ms. Zi. After all, the dragon core originated from her and will not pose any risks to her. They can achieve this result by\u2026\u201d\u201cBy what?\u201d Zhao Guang asked immediately.\u201cBy\u2026\u201d The elderly brought his thumbs together and spat out one word with difficulty, \u201cConsummation.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Zhao Yanzi froze for half a second before jumping up and shrieking, \u201cOldman Sun! You are a disgraceful jerk at such an old age!\u201d\u201cBehave!\u201d Zhao Guang glared at his daughter and emitted a powerful presence which pushed Zhao Yanzi back into her seat.\u201cElder Sun\u2019s plan may be a plausible solution,\u201d Elder Lu with white eyebrows and white hair spoke up abruptly. \u201cIn fact, even if we did as Elder Zhao suggested and took the core out by cutting open his stomach, it would not be safe to put the contaminated core back into Ms. Zi\u2019s body. I\u2019ve read about the solution mentioned by Elder Sun in an ancient book. It\u2019s a kind of surrogate core cultivation. The problem with this kind of cultivation is that it takes a long time and needs the assistance of a cultivator without an internal core. In addition to all the restrictions, the cultivator will get very few benefits, and that is why the method had gradually lost its appeal and is not practiced anymore. However, in the case of Ms. Zi, it\u2019s worth a try.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Zhao Yanzi shouted immediately, \u201cI\u2019d rather die!\u201dIgnoring his daughter\u2019s outburst, Zhao Guang waved his hand, and Zi froze as if she was bound with an invisible rope since she could neither move nor yell.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTurning to Elder Lu, Zhao Guang furrowed his brows. \u201cIf we take this solution\u2026Doesn\u2019t it mean Zi and the mortal will have to\u2026\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice\u2026\u201d Elder Lu said humbly.After a moment\u2019s consideration, Zhao Guang asked, \u201cHow about the guy\u2019s character?\u201d\u201cI did some investigating. His name is Hao Ren, and he is kind-hearted and very good to his grandma. Though not very hardworking at his university, he has a passable score. He is neither stupid nor a libertine. More importantly, he is not married and doesn\u2019t even have a girlfriend.\u201d\u201cThe marriages between dragons and humans are rare but are not unheard of. Once he gets a new dragon identity, it\u2019s not against our law for him to cultivate our techniques.\u201d Zhao Guang thought for a while. \u201cLet\u2019s hear him out and see how he responses to the plan. If he agrees, then the matter is settled.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The automatic door to the meeting room opened.A dozen or so people, some old and some young, walked out of the room. Zhao Yanzi was the first one who rushed out of the room. She snorted loudly at Hao Ren.Hao Ren was nonplussed, wondering how he had offended her. \u201cYou lost your stuff, and I was taken here because of it. It\u2019s fortunate that your dad is a reasonable man or I would die at your hands.\u201dWhile others passed Hao Ren on their way out of the office room, they cast strange glances at him.Then Zhao Guang took Zhao Yanzi back to school himself. As to how he would persuade his daughter was beyond Hao Ren\u2019s knowledge.Only Elder Lu and Hao Ren were left in the office room.Hao Ren looked at Elder Lu and waited for him to speak first. After going through all the weird things in the past few days, his mind was a bit numb, and he didn\u2019t even try to think straight now.\u201cIs your name Hao Ren?\u201d Elder Lu took a seat opposite to Hao Ren and asked kindly.Hao Ren stared at him, \u201cYeah, and you are\u2026\u201d\u201cHehe, you may call me Grandpa Lu.\u201d Elder Lu looked at Hao Ren kindly, \u201cAre you a bit confused?\u201d\u201cNot too much,\u201d Hao Ren answered stubbornly.Elder Lu still looked Hao Ren cordially, \u201cYou will experience more things in the future.\u201d\u201cWell?\u201d Hao Ren waited for him to continue.\u201cWhat do you think of the girl, Zi?\u201d Abruptly, Elder Lu changed the subject.\u201cImmature, unruly, willful, bad-mannered\u2026\u201d Hao Ren began.With a smile, Elder Lu interrupted Hao Ren, \u201cIn fact, Zi is a very cute girl.\u201d\u201cI disagree\u2026\u201d Hao Ren responded immediately.\u201cYou will find out gradually in the future,\u201d Elder Lu said calmly.\u201cIn the future?\u201d Hao Ren looked at him with alarm.\u201cYes. The two of you will live together for a long time.\u201d Elder Lu smiled at Hao Ren.Hao Ren was alarmed, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cOur boss appreciates you and thinks you are eligible to be his son-in-law,\u201d Elder Lu informed him.Hao Ren\u2019s jaw dropped at this information.\u201cAre you kidding me?! That so-called Zi is only a fifteen-year-old middle-schooler while I\u2019m no older than 19!\u201d He thought.\u201cDo you think the bead you swallowed is an ordinary bead?\u201d Elder Lu continued.Thinking back, Hao Ren remembered that something like a candy had dropped into his mouth when he caught Zhao Yanzi.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Hao Ren.\u201cDragon core,\u201d Elder Lu said slowly.Hao Ren looked at him in a daze, thinking that the entire family was crazy.\u201cDragons, flying across the heavens. Do you envy them?\u201d asked Elder Lu.Hao Ren shook his head.\u201cDragons, transforming the sky and the earth. Do you envy them?\u201d Elder Lu continued to ask.Hao Ren shook his head again.\u201cDragons\u2026\u201d Elder Lu tried again.Hao Ren still shook his head.Elder Lu\u2019s old face dropped. \u201cIf you don\u2019t listen to me, the bead will take your life at any moment.\u201dSeeing the question on Hao Ren\u2019s face, Elder Lu opened his hand, and a green-blueish water bead appeared in his palm.\u201cThe bead in your stomach is like the water bead in my palm.\u201d Ignoring Hao Ren\u2019s astonishment, Elder Lu raised the water bead in his palm slowly. \u201cHowever, as time goes on\u2026\u201dThe water bead gradually expanded to the size as big as his whole palm\u2026The huge green-blueish bead had a clear reflection of Hao Ren\u2019s face on its surface.\u201cAt last, it will\u2026\u201d Elder Lu gazed at the water bead.Bang!The water bead burst and water splashed all over Hao Ren.Startled, Hao Ren backed off half a step.Elder Lu pointed at Hao Ren\u2019s stomach with a smile.Thinking of the moment when the water bead burst, Hao Ren suddenly had a stomachache.\u201cI have a set of cultivation technique. You can take it and work hard on your cultivation. But remember, you must hide it from other people. This set of cultivation technique can suppress the dragon core in your body and prevent you from dying of explosion in the near future.\u201d Like in a magic trick, Elder Lu grabbed an ancient book from thin air and placed it in Hao Ren\u2019s hand.\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d Hao Ren asked. He felt like his brain was in a buzz of confusion and was unable to accept all the overwhelming information.\u201cWe are\u2026\u201d Elder Lu deliberately paused for better effects before whispering in Hao Ren\u2019s ear, \u201cDragons.\u201dHao Ren back off another half a meter. Looking at the bluffing old man, he thought he resembled the vendor who sold so-called secret martial arts scriptures near Cheng Huang Temple. (The so-called Cheng Huang Temple is where people gathered for traditional festivals.)But Hao Ren couldn\u2019t figure out how he summoned the water bead.Was it a new form of fraud? Faced with the complexities of society, Hao Ren didn\u2019t quite trust his recognition ability.\u201cI know it\u2019s hard to digest, but you will get used to it.\u201d Elder Lu patted Hao Ren on his shoulder amiably. \u201cNow that you are one of us, you must guard our common secret. By doing so, you are also protecting yourself.\u201dHao Ren looked at him in bafflement, thinking the looks of the dragons were a bit too ordinary. Flying across the heavens? Transforming the sky and the earth? Seriously?Instead, he thought it was a complicated scam, not a bunch of disguised superheroes hidden in the city like the Superman in movies.\u201cIt seems you still don\u2019t believe me.\u201d Looking at Hao Ren, Elder Lu abruptly took the ancient book back from Hao Ren\u2019s hand and put his other palm on Hao Ren\u2019s forehead.All of a sudden, a passage of shining golden characters appeared in Hao Ren\u2019s mind. Before he could react, Elder Lu removed his hand.\u201cThis is the first chapter of the [Spirit Concentration Scroll]. It is simple, and you will master it by meditating for half an hour every night. I will check your progress periodically, and you will be punished if you don\u2019t meet my requirements,\u201d Elder Lu told Hao Ren amiably.\u201cF*ck! The old man looks harmless but is actually very aggressive\u2026When did I promise to cultivate this stuff?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHao Ren stared at him with panic and fury.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, these cultivation techniques will do you good instead of harm. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t cultivate them, you will be in danger. From now on, I\u2019m your guardian in our circle. If you have any questions, just call me\u2026\u201d Elder Lu took out a name card and presented it to Hao Ren.\u201cThey even have name cards\u2026 The so-called dragons are quite professional, or can I say, not professional\u2026\u201dSpeechless, Hao Ren took the name card and froze at the information on it\u2014Lu Qing, Managing Vice President of East Ocean University.\u201cRemember your identity.

Go back early.\u201d Lu Qing stood up and waved at Hao Ren.Hao Ren thought for a few seconds, stood up, and walked out of the luxurious office. Then he took the elevator down alone.Standing in the elevator and watching the numbers drop, Hao Ren felt like he was dreaming.He arrived on the first floor. When he passed the pretty receptionist, the beauty smiled at Hao Ren. \u201cHe must be an important guest because he is capable of entering the CEO\u2019s office.\u201d She thought.He took a taxi back to school. Seeing the familiar views, Hao Ren felt like he was back to reality.He took out his phone and called Zhao Jiayi, \u201cWhere are you guys?\u201d He asked.\u201cWe are in Art Appreciation Class in building A. Are you alright? We didn\u2019t dare to call you,\u201d Zhao Jiayi said.\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll come now.\u201d Hao Ren hung up the phone. The first thing he wanted to do right now was to find his bros. After the series of weird events, he felt like none of them were real.Hao Ren sprinted to building A and sneaked into the classroom from the back door.\u201cHow was it? What happened?\u201d Zhao Jiayi and the others asked Hao Ren in concern.\u201cSigh, don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d Hao Ren waved his hand and sat down.Xie Yujia, the Class President who usually sits in the front, sensed that Hao Ren came back. She turned around and looked at him.\u201cSeems like Xie Yujia cares a lot about you recently,\u201d Cao Ronghua said to Hao Ren when he saw Xie Yujia turning back.Hao Ren wasn\u2019t in the mood to discuss this topic. He calmed down and asked, \u201cHey, what\u2019s the name of our principal?\u201d\u201cWu Senyu. You didn\u2019t even know that?\u201d Zhou Liren came up and said.\u201cWhat about the vice principal?\u201d Hao Ren asked again right away.\u201cThe managing vice principal\u2019s name is Lu Qing. I don\u2019t know about the other ones.\u201d Zhou Liren seemed like he wanted to show off how knowledgeable he was and answered, \u201cManaging vice principal is the most powerful person in the school as he is just underneath the principal. That\u2019s why he\u2019s also called the No.1 vice principal.\u201dHao Ren thought about the conversation and didn\u2019t say anything else.\u201cWhy are you asking about this? Is it related to the principal?\u201d Zhou Liren asked Hao Ren.\u201cNothing\u2026\u201d Hao Ren held the name card in his hand and squeezed it.\u201cHao Ren, stand up and answer the question!\u201d The teacher who was standing in front of the room saw Hao Ren talking to others. He also remembered that Hao Ren sneaked into the classroom earlier and was pissed off. Thus, he had Hao Ren stand up to answer the question.Poor Hao Ren. He wasn\u2019t there for half of the lecture. How could he answer any questions? He had to be scolded by the teacher helplessly.Class President Xie Yujia turned her head and looked at Hao Ren with pity in her eyes.After the lecture was over, Hao Ren, Zhao Jiayin, and the others returned to the dorm. Gu Jiadong and others came up immediately and asked about the Mercedes-Benz pickup incident.Hao Ren simply said his relative from overseas came and picked him up for a meal. He covered it up and didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore.\u201cYou haven\u2019t been yourself lately. Did you get rejected?\u201dWhen Hao Ren was copying homework at night, he received a text message from the Class President Xie Yujia.\u201cNah\u2026 I\u2019ve been busy lately.\u201d Hao Ren didn\u2019t expect her to send him a text. He thought about it and replied her.Di, di, di, di\u2026 The phone that Hao Ren put on the desk suddenly rang.It was a call from Xie Yujia, so he had to pick it up.\u201cWhat happened this morning?\u201d Xie Yujia asked over the phone.\u201cOh, my relative returned from overseas and treated me to a meal. He gave me a surprise, and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t know about it in advance.\u201d\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Xie Yujia asked.\u201cI\u2019m in my dorm room,\u201d Hao Ren answered.The other side of the phone was silent for a few seconds before she suddenly asked, \u201cDo you want to go for a walk? The moonlight is pretty right now.\u201dHao Ren got butterflies in his stomach because he didn\u2019t expect an invitation like this.In his mind, the Class President Xie Yujia was a very popular girl. Not only many guys in his class liked her, but also many upper-year students went after her.If Zhao Jiayi and others didn\u2019t go behind Hao Ren\u2019s back and confessed to Xie Yujia on his behalf, the relationship between Hao Ren and Xie Yujia wouldn\u2019t be so awkward.\u201cNevermind. I am alright, really. I have quite a bit of homework to do. Another time,\u201d Hao Ren struggled for a moment and said over the phone.\u201cUmm\u2026 If you have any questions, just ask me,\u201d Xie Yujia said. After a moment of pause, she continued, \u201cNo matter what, I am your Class President. I need to take care of you. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cHaha, thank you for your concern.\u201d Hao Ren couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say.\u201cNo worries.\u201d Xie Yujia hung up the phone.Hao Ren put down his cellphone and felt a little excited.\u201cWho called?\u201d Zhao Jiayi and other two dormmates rushed through the door with midnight snacks in their hands as they yelled at Hao Ren.\u201cNothing.\u201d Hao Ren smiled.\u201cYou have been mysterious lately. Not sure what you\u2019ve been up to!\u201d Zhao Jiayin came up and punched Hao Ren lightly as he said in a joking tone.Hao Ren took the attack from Zhao Jiayin and thought, \u201cIf someone sees the Class President and I walk together privately, not sure what they will think\u2026 Shouldn\u2019t Xie Yujia be concerned about this?In the middle of the night, Hao Ren sneakily crawled down from his upper berth when Zhao Jiayi and the others were in deep sleep. Then, he opened the door and walked out to the balcony.The moonlight was bright.Hao Ren took out Lu Qing\u2019s name card and looked at it for a while before putting it back in his pocket.\u201cMight as well give it a try\u2026\u201dAfter Hao Ren\u2019s stance was steady, he faced the silent sky and thought about the cultivation technique in his mind.The golden scripts emerged in Hao Ren\u2019s mind. Hao Ren tried to comprehend the meaning of the technique word by word and concentrated on his meditation as instructed.He finished a whole set once, returned to his room sneakily, and found out that two hours had passed.He actually stood outside for two hours\u2026 Hao Ren surprised himself.He wasn\u2019t sure if it was a psychological effect or not. After practice, he felt the swollen part of his arm had returned back to normal.\u201cWhatever, I\u2019ve done my part. Time to go to bed.\u201d Hao Ren suppressed all the other thoughts and fell asleep very soon.In the next few days, life had become as dull as flowing water. Everyone\u2019s attention paid to an ordinary classmate like Hao Ren had decreased, but Xie Yujia would still glance back at Hao Ren when she talked to the girl who sat behind her.Hao Ren went to the balcony to \u201cpractice\u201d every single night but didn\u2019t discover any refreshing effects. His strength even started to decrease to normal, and he was again no match for Zhou Liren in arm wrestling.The name card of the vice principal was hidden by him. It wasn\u2019t a good feeling when a vice principal had his eyes on him.Thursday was here in the blink of an eye. It was an exciting day for all the guys studying Mechatronic Engineering.It was because of a compulsory course for second years \u2014 Weak Optical Signal Processing.\u201cHurry up! Hurry up! Go occupy the seats in the front row.\u201d Coming out of the classroom of Advanced Mathematics, Zhou Liren dragged Hao Ren and ran crazily towards the direction of another big classroom.\u201cZhou Liren, save two seats for us!\u201d Zhao Jiayi and Cao Ronghua yelled from the back.Zhou Liren came to the classroom almost as fast as the speed of light, but he was still disappointed as he found out that first fifteen rows were occupied by other guys.\u201cWe\u2019re still too slow!\u201d Zhou Liren said angrily. He picked the seats that were closer to the middle, dragged Hao Ren with him, and saved two seats for the other two guys.\u201cSh*t! It\u2019s so far behind!\u201d Zhao Jiayi and Cao Ronghua ran in breathlessly and were dissatisfied when they saw the location of their seats.\u201cThose people skipped classes to get those seats. What can I do?\u201d Zhou Liren said innocently.\u201cDidn\u2019t you claim that you must marry her? Don\u2019t even have the guts to skip class\u2026\u201d Cao Ronghua mocked him.\u201cTrue. You were excited since yesterday for her lecture today,\u201d Zhao Jiayi followed and said.\u201cWeren\u2019t you guys the same? Running so fast!\u201d Zhou Liren rebutted.Boom, boom\u2026At this time, another group of guys rushed into the classroom for good seats. However, they ran slower than Hao Ren and could only sit in the back.Soon after, the only few girls in the same major came in late and saw the front seats occupied by the guys. They didn\u2019t have a choice but to sit at the very far back.Xie Yujia was one of the girls. She made eye contact with Hao Ren but didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cYou\u2019ve been having quite a few eye contacts with Xie Yujia lately. Are you guys secretly dating?\u201d Cao Ronghua felt something and asked Hao Ren.\u201cI\u2019ve been with you all day. Where\u2019s the dating part?\u201d Hao Ren rolled his eyes.The classroom was filled with noises. Other than Hao Ren\u2019s class, there were four other classes here as well. Everybody was talking, especially the guys.Ding, ding, ding\u2026 the bell rang.A pair of graceful legs dressed in high-waisted shorts stepped in.All the guys gasped.The light sky-blue high-waisted jean shorts was decorated with military style buttons. The top was a shirt with a laced V-neck and flounce trim. A super beauty with handouts clipped under her arm entered the classroom.\u201cLovely and mature, mature and pure\u2026\u201d Zhou Liren stuck his tongue out and commented.As the guys gasped, Hao Ren couldn\u2019t help but raise his head to observe. Indeed, Su Han was still so dazzling, delicate, and good-looking. Even when she didn\u2019t wear revealing clothing, she could still raise any male\u2019s blood temperature.Su Han walked to the front of the dais slowly in her high heels.All the eyes of the males were tightly locked on her. Even Hao Ren was staring at her despite the fact that he had practiced Concentration Cultivation Technique.\u201cToday we are going to talk about the third module. Everybody, open your textbook to page number seventy-three.\u201d The angelic tone traveled from Su Han\u2019s mini-microphone in front of her chest to every corner of the classroom.\u201cI\u2019m in heaven\u2026\u201d Zhou Liren was drunk on her voice, \u201cIt would be so pleasant to have this kind of lecture every day.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s really pretty\u2026\u201d Hao Ren looked at her and thought.\u201cHer body figure, appearance, and makeup are all impeccable. What kind of boyfriend would this type of women look for?\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.Even though everybody only had a few lectures since the beginning of the semester, all the men\u2019s hearts were conquered by her.In addition, Su Han\u2019s lectures were clear, organized, and easy to understand. Even the girls in the class had to admit that and admire her for those reasons.The ninety-minute lecture ended. All the guys were still immersed in Su Han\u2019s beauty and couldn\u2019t control themselves.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, everybody knew that this iceberg beauty never talked about anything that was unrelated to the course nor answered any question from students. She also wouldn\u2019t stay a minute after the lecture. The second the bell rang, she would finish her last sentence, pick up the notes, and walk out of the classroom at the same time.\u201cIf I could say one sentence to this kind of beauty, I would die with no regrets.\u201d Seeing Su Han was about to leave, Zhou Liren dragged Hao Ren\u2019s arm and sighed.\u201cThat student, come to my office.\u201d To everyone\u2019s surprise, Su Han didn\u2019t step out of the classroom when the bell rang. She raised her delicate hand and pointed in Zhou Liren\u2019s direction as she said.\u201cMe?\u201d Zhou Liren stood up. He was surprised and almost fainted from happiness.\u201cNo, the guy beside you.\u201d Su Han\u2019s finger moved slightly to the right and pointed at Hao Ren.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He walked up to the front of the classroom while all the shocked, envious, and jealous looks from all the guys in the classroom landed on him.Su Han nodded at Hao Ren without saying anything else. Then she grabbed lecture notes and walked out of the classroom.Hao Ren followed her, having no idea what on earth Su Han was going to do.Walking through the hallways and passing the overbridge between the academic buildings, Hao Ren walked into Su Han\u2019s office while a crowd of students looked at him with curiosity.It was known that Su Han, who had just been in the university for one year, wasn\u2019t only a celebrity at the Mechatronic Engineering Department, but also at the entire university. Everyone knew there was a teacher who had the beauty of a celebrity in the university but was still single.Su Han took out a key and opened the office door.A refreshing smell blew onto their faces.There were six or seven pots of plants on the window sill. The wooden imitated-antique tables and chairs were widely different from those provided by the university. Apparently, Su Han bought them herself.The decoration of the entire office was very elegant and graceful, making it seem like her own little world.Having her own separate office while most of the teachers had to share with each other had well proved that Su Han\u2019s status here wasn\u2019t normal.All those wooden chairs and shelves were quite pricey even though they weren\u2019t real antiques. \u201cIt seems that Su Han\u2019s family is pretty well-off.\u201d Hao Ren thought as he observed the office.Su Han closed the door and put the lecture notes down on the table. Then she pulled out a rosewood chair and sat down gracefully. She looked at Hao Ren and asked, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\u201cMechatronic Engineering,\u201d Hao Ren answered.Hao Ren looked around the office and thought that he was probably the first student who was lucky enough to get in Su Han\u2019s office.\u201cDon\u2019t try to avoid the point,\u201d Su Han stared at Hao Ren and said.\u201cEm?\u201d Hao Ren was quite confused. He was a student of the Mechatronic Engineering Department of East Ocean University. Where else could he be from?Su Han seemed to have gotten annoyed. Although she had a frowny face on at the moment, her beauty was still beyond description.Her every act and every move was so classic and elegant that it could never be imitated by any other beautiful lady. That was also why there were countless guys going crazy for her.Su Han reached out her slim hand and grabbed Hao Ren\u2019s wrist. Her action wasn\u2019t fast, but Hao Ren had no way to avoid it.\u201cAs I expected, it is the Water Element. Tell me where you belong, River, Steam, Lake, or Ocean?\u201d Su Han asked casually.Who knew how many guys would scream like a girl out of jealousy if they saw this scene.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Hao Ren looked at her with even more confusion.\u201cIf you can\u2019t answer me, I have enough reasons to kill you.\u201d A chilling expression suddenly appeared in Su Han\u2019s eyes, making Hao Ren\u2019s entire body shiver.\u201cHow did that happen? A normal human body like yours is giving out the sensation of a dragon. Where did you get the cultivation technique?\u201d Staring at Hao Ren, Su Han paused after every word she said.\u201cIt was\u2026 from Lu Qing.\u201d Hao Ren hesitated for a moment and said.\u201cOh? You are from the East Ocean?\u201d Su Han frowned as she was a bit surprised.Hao Ren was feeling more puzzled.\u201cThat\u2019s weird, how could a normal person mix in with the East Ocean Dragon Clan\u2026\u201d She mumbled to herself and then asked again, \u201cWhat is your relationship with Lu Qing?\u201dHao Ren threw up his hands and answered, \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that. Who are you?\u201dHao Ren couldn\u2019t figure out the things that were happening to him these days. He felt like his head was going to explode.\u201cI am an \u201cInspector\u201d, it seems that you do know nothing.\u201d Rubbing her pretty head, Su Han seemed confused too. She waved at Hao Ren and said, \u201cYou can leave now, I\u2019ll go talk to Lu Qing.\u201dThe way she acted made her appear as if she was at a higher position than Lu Qing. However, Lu Qing was the vice-principal while she was just a teacher of the university\u2026Hao Ren was totally puzzled.\u201cBut I need to warn you that I have enough reason to kill you if you dare to reveal any secrets.\u201d Su Han added as Hao Ren walked out of the office.Woosh\u2026 Hao Ren let out a long breath when he left the office.He went back to his dorm in anxiety and fear. Then, seven to eight guys flooded to him immediately.\u201cWhat did Su Han ask you for?\u201d\u201cWhy did she look for you?\u201d\u201cDid you go to her office?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t try to keep anything from us dude, did you do anything that drew her attention?\u201dHao Ren was surrounded tightly by them, but he didn\u2019t leak any information as he didn\u2019t forget Su Han\u2019s warning.Realizing they couldn\u2019t get anything from Hao Ren, those guys decided to switch targets and asked Zhao Jiayi and the others since they were the closest to Hao Ren.However, Zhao Jiayi and other guys didn\u2019t know what Hao Ren did recently to catch Su Han\u2019s attention. The four of them were always together when they were at the university, but they didn\u2019t notice anything else Hao Ren did that would interest Su Han.As a consequence, Hao Ren going to Su Han\u2019s office had become a mystery among the guys. Hao Ren had brought them too much gossip and surprises these days. Gradually, people started to think that Hao Ren was someone special.However, as the person involved, Hao Ren didn\u2019t join in the conversation with the others. He was wondering what they would think about him if they found out that he still had the name card of the vice-principal.It was finally the evening after Hao Ren tried to avoid the unstoppable questioning from all the guys. The four guys in the dorm seemed way too excited to fall asleep.Especially Zhou Liren, who kept asking Hao Ren what was with Su Han.This matter could have been dealt with easily, but it triggered the crowd\u2019s curiosity as Hao Ren refused to say anything about it. Hao Ren could make an excuse to fool others, but he thought it would be safer if he remained silent as thinking of the mysterious temper Su Han had.\u201cAll the visitors are gone, and we are close friends. Hao Ren, Can you just tell us what Su Han asked you for?\u201dZhou Liren reached his hand to Hao Ren\u2019s window and asked.Cao Ronghua and Zhao Jiayi who slept on the lower berth straightened their ears hoping Hao Ren could reveal some information.\u201cStop mentioning it and get some rest.\u201d Hao Ren sighed and felt very helpless.\u201cThat is so unfriendly of you.\u201d Zhou Liren was deeply disappointed.\u201cDude, you are so secretive recently.\u201d Zhao Jiayi kicked the bed frame of the upper berth from underneath.Hao Ren couldn\u2019t help with the situation. He used to be able to talk about anything with his buddies, but in terms of these things, there was nothing he could do.\u201cBut you seemed to have good luck in love these days,\u201d Cao Ronghua said all of a sudden.The lights were off at the moment; the four guys were talking in the dark excitedly and didn\u2019t feel tired.\u201cYeah, I think our Class President Xie Yujia is interested in you too.\u201d Zhou Liren followed.\u201cHow come\u2026\u201d Hao Ren yelled. He finally didn\u2019t have to stay silent as there came a topic he could talk about.\u201cShe kept looking back at you recently, don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t know about that,\u201d Zhao Jiayi said.\u201cMake your move if you like her. What is the point of hesitating?\u201d Cao Ronghua suggested.\u201cDon\u2019t mess around. I think she was just caring for a classmate.\u201d Hao Ren felt a bit panicky. He didn\u2019t really care too much about these things.He felt that he got involved in something he wasn\u2019t supposed to. Now he was unable to get away from it and there would be danger waiting for him at any time.\u201cDon\u2019t you like the Lin Li? The most popular girl in the school?\u201d Zhou Liren yelled.\u201cThat is you, all right? I never liked her.\u201d Hao Ren shrugged.\u201cBut she is indeed beautiful. Zhao Jiayi likes her too, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cF*ck off, don\u2019t mention me, it was obviously you!\u201d\u201cZhao Jiayi had so many girlfriends\u2026\u201dThey continued to chat until the morning, which left Hao Ren no chance to go out and cultivate at midnight. However, he actually liked spending all night chatting with his buddies.Soon it was the next day, another Friday that was so close to the weekend. Su Han asking Hao Ren to go to her office was definitely the hot topic of the day.Even Xie Yujia who never talked in class was discussing quietly with the girls around her from time to time. Hao Ren could tell that she was talking about Su Han from the looks she threw at him.The teacher couldn\u2019t concentrate on teaching while the students continued to discuss. Although he had warned them a few times, it didn\u2019t cool down their passion.\u201cEm, it will probably be over after this weekend. They are just too bored I guess. Last time when a good-looking guy from the fourth-year showed his admiration to Lin Li, everyone was talking about that with great interest. However, they switched their interest to other hot topics after two or three days\u2026\u201d Spinning his pen, Hao Ren hoped helplessly.Bang bang bang\u2026The classroom door was knocked on by someone from the outside.The angry teacher who was just lecturing went to open the door. He was enraged because nobody paid attention to his class, and he assumed it was a student who was late. He was about to release his rage on the \u201cintruder\u201d. However, he found the person standing outside to be vice-principal Lu Qing.\u201cVice-principal\u2026\u201d The teacher said quietly and took a half step back involuntarily.Lu Qing kept a straight face and walked in. He looked at the teacher and then at the students in the class before asking, \u201cHow can it be so out of order in here?\u201dSeeing the vice-principal in person, all the students turned quiet out of fear. No one ever expected that the vice-principal would have an interest in visiting the class by himself. The class coincidently happened to be especially noisy as he walked by.Lu Qing\u2019s eyes were sweeping over the students in the class. When he made eye contact with Hao Ren, Hao Ren couldn\u2019t help but shiver, feeling his body freeze up for a moment.\u201cGet your class under control and teach it well.\u201d Lu Qing left his words to the teacher and left the classroom.The students looked at each other in speechless despair, and no one dared to talk again. The teacher felt such a relief and nodded with satisfaction as he saw all his students finally become quiet. He could finally continue his class.Hao Ren gave a sigh of relief as well. He had a feeling Lu Qing came here on purpose for him as he felt restrained when Lu Qing\u2019s eyes passed him.The passion students had with chatting was cut off by the appearance of the vice-principal, which seemed to make the lunch break come faster.There was no class on Friday afternoon, therefore, whoever lived in East Ocean City could go home in the afternoon.Hao Ren\u2019s home was beside the ocean and wasn\u2019t that close to the university. Thus, he didn\u2019t go back home every weekend. Cao Ronghua lived even further, so he barely went back home. In terms of Zhou Liren and Zhao Jiayi, they were used to the free life at university, so they weren\u2019t willing to go home if it wasn\u2019t necessary.They bent their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders and was about to cross the south gate of the campus to go back to the dorm to play cards, but they noticed there was a black Lincoln Stretch Limousine parked at the gate of the dorm area. It looked extremely shining and luxurious in the sunlight.\u201cWho is that arrogant, getting picked up by a car like that?\u201d Staring at the luxury car, Zhou Liren yelled.They had heard about some rich kids at the university who got picked up on weekends by BMWs, but it was the first time for them to see someone got picked up by a luxury car on this level.Not only the four of them, but all other students who lived in this dorm area had never seen a scene like that.Whoever walked by the gate slowed down either intentionally or unintentionally in order to see who was going to get picked up by the car.\u201cIs someone trying to show off by getting picked up in this kind of car?\u201d Laying his arm on Hao Ren, Zhao Jiayi said disdainfully as they walked by the car.\u201cYeah, obviously they\u2019re showing off. Showing off too much will ruin their luck,\u201d Hao Ren said with a bit jealousy too as he despised this kind of behavior.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere was nothing wrong with maintaining a low profile.As they walked by the car and expressed their disdain while still putting their arms on each other\u2019s shoulders, the car door suddenly opened. Two giant men in black and a short elder got out of the car.Seeing the short elder, Hao Ren got bitterly disappointed \u2013 because he had seen this elder at Zhao Yanzi\u2019s father\u2019s office.This elder was Elder Sun, the\u201dold and disrespectful\u201d man Zhao Yanzi hated so much that she wished she could tear him apart.\u201cChilde Hao, Ms. Zi\u2019s family is inviting you for a visit,\u201d The elder said to Hao Ren pridefully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedHao Ren stared at the old man, stupefied. Zhao Jiayi and the others, however, suddenly let go of his arm and kept a distance from him.There were quite a number of students walking by the dorm entrance \u2013 some just got back from their classes and the others were leaving for home with their backpacks. They stared at Hao Ren curiously from where they were standing.Hao Ren was completely embarrassed but he kept silent.\u201cPlease get in the car,\u201d Elder Sun said to Hao Ren reverently.\u201cNo!\u201d Hao Ren\u2019s stubbornness exploded as he shouted.\u201cWhat the hell is this. I didn\u2019t even get a notice beforehand.\u201d Hao Ren wasn\u2019t very pleased.\u201cChilde Hao, you are already engaged with Zi. It\u2019s best to not act too irrationally on these things,\u201d said Elder Sun.Although his words might not have been heard by those who were a bit far, Zhao Jiayi and the other dormmates heard every word of it, \u201cEngaged?\u201d they couldn\u2019t help but repeat it out loud.\u201cWho is Zi?\u201d Zhou Liren asked Zhao Jiayi and Cao Ronghua, confused.But they simply shook their heads blankly.\u201cWould you like us to keep waiting here?\u201d Elder Sun asked kindly.\u201cYou win!\u201d Seeing more and more people surrounded them, Hao Ren quickly got into the car after thinking about it.The black Lincoln Stretch Limousine drove away from the entrance in front of everyone\u2019s stare. It was hard for it to be lowkey as much as Hao Ren wished to.\u201cWhat is the deal with Hao Ren!\u201d Zhou Liren spoke up abruptly as the black Lincoln drove further away.The vehicle drove smoothly through the city for a little while before it arrived at a two-story house.No one would think of it as the house of a rich family by its unpretentious look.The vehicle stopped, and Elder Sun accompanied Hao Ren off the car. He pressed the doorbell.\u201cCome in,\u201d a beautiful lady in an apron opened the door and said softly.\u201cI brought him here, madam. I\u2019m heading back now, Please call me if you need anything,\u201d Elder Sun said to the woman politely.\u201cYes, thank you Elder Sun. I won\u2019t keep you from your work. It seems like you are about to break through the ninth level of Purple Light Scroll. I won\u2019t waste more of your time,\u201d she said softly.\u201cThank you, madam,\u201d Elder Sun bowed with his hands folded in front, got into the black Lincoln, and left.Then, the beautiful woman smiled at Hao Ren who was at the door and said, \u201cCome and sit down.\u201dA single smile of hers would overthrow a city. And another one would overthrow a country. (Chinese Idiom describing the beautify of a woman) Her hair was tied up elegantly as if she just walked out of a painting. Seeing her, Hao Ren forgot about all the unpleasantness just now.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d he answered dully and walked into the room.The room was delicately renovated and thoroughly cleaned.\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten yet, have you?\u201d she guided Hao Ren as she gently turned and asked.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d he answered dumbly.He couldn\u2019t get mad at this elegant and beautiful woman in front of him.\u201cI am Zhao Hongyu, Zi\u2019s mom. Her dad went to pick her up from school, and they should be back soon. Go ahead and take a seat. I\u2019ll go cook.\u201d she led Hao Ren to the couch and smiled. Then she walked into the kitchen.\u201cThis must be the precise definition of what an understanding wife and loving mother are like,\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself as he stared at her back.Hao Ren sat down and looked around the house. Even though it appeared to be plain on the outside, the interior design and decoration were very pleasing and resplendent.A white staircase on the left led to the bedrooms on the second floor. There was a study room on the right. A large dark brown bookshelf inside the study room brought about the essence of a scholarly family.The fluffy carpet in the living room was stainless. The medieval-styled chandelier above him demonstrated the wealth of the family.Ka! The door opened as Zhao Guang came in with Zhao Yanzi.Zhao Yanzi was still in her fresh and light blue school uniform. She gritted her teeth hatefully when she saw Hao Ren. Yet she did not show any signs of surprise. \u201cHer dad must have told her about this when he picked her up,\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.\u201cYou are here,\u201d Zhao Guang greeted him lightly.\u201cUncle,\u201d Hao Ren quickly stood up and greeted him. He didn\u2019t really see Zhao Guang as his father-in-law, but he had to be polite since he was a guest here.He glimpsed at Zhao Yanzi who was pouting over on the side. Hao Ren shivered at the thought of getting engaged and falling in love with a mid-schooler \u2013 not to mention their complicated background.\u201cIt\u2019s ok, sit down,\u201d Zhao Guang said calmly and turned to Zhao Yanzi, \u201cYou guys have a chat. I still have some work to do.\u201dThen he walked into the study room and started going through some documents.Zhao Yanzi stood on the carpet as she stared at Hao Ren. She looked like she wanted to eat him alive.\u201cLet me warn you. I never agreed to marry you. So if you don\u2019t keep your hands to yourself, I am going to cut them off!\u201d she said aggressively.\u201cThe problem is I never wanted to get married to you either, ok? What can I do when they kidnapped me here?\u201d Hao Ren threw Zhao Yanzi an unfriendly look as well.Then he thought to himself, \u201cIs it really necessary to get mad at a mid-schooler?\u201d But then he realized that the mid-schooler was his fiancee in the current situation.\u201cI\u2019m going upstairs to play on my computer. Sit by yourself!\u201d Zhao Yanzi glimpsed at Hao Ren and walked towards the stairs.\u201cZi!\u201d Zhao Guang\u2019s stern voice came from the study room on the right.Zhao Yanzi gritted her teeth and stopped walking at her dad\u2019s words.She pouted after contemplating seriously for a while, rolled her eyes at Hao Ren, and walked slowly to him as if there were thousands of stones dragging her down.Bom! She sat on the couch beside Hao Ren reluctantly.\u201cWatch some TV if you don\u2019t want to talk,\u201d Hao Ren glimpsed at her reluctantly and turned on the TV with the remote control.Zhao Yanzi kept on staring at him angrily.Having ignored her, Hao Ren carried on with scanning through the channels.\u201cPleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf?\u201d Hao Ren turned to her, \u201cThat\u2019s more like your taste.\u201d (The show is a Chinese animated television series for kids in kindergarten and elementary school.)\u201cGo to hell!\u201d Zhao Yanzi grasped for something from the table to hit him with.\u201cZi!\u201d Zhao Guang called out her name again from the study room. He knew exactly what Zhao Yanzi was doing as if he left a pair of eyes in the living room.Zhao Yanzi put it down reluctantly yet her eyes were still fixated on Hao Ren. \u201cI\u2019m warning you. Do not make me mad!\u201dHao Ren smiled lightly. \u201cYou hate me that much?\u201dZhao Yanzi pouted. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like you at all.\u201d\u201cMe neither. You are always mad, and you are not that pretty. It would be a pity if anyone had to marry you,\u201d Hao Ren said lightly.\u201cYou!\u201d Zhao Yanzi\u2019s opened her eyes wide.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cStop fighting, you two. You are going to be husband and wife in the future anyway.\u201d Zhao Hongyu walked out of the kitchen with a dish in her hands.\u201cMom\u2026he is bullying me,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said in a pettishly charming manner.\u201cI saw it all, and you were the one bullying him,\u201d Zhao Hongyu smiled softly and walked back into the kitchen to prepare the second dish.\u201cFine, Good for you, stinky uncle. Even my parents are on your side,\u201d Zhao Yanzi exposed her \u201cvicious\u201d nature as soon as her mom left. She made a face at Hao Ren.\u201cWhy are you so reluctant? Do you have a boyfriend at school?\u201d he asked as he thought about all the mid-schooler couples on the streets.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He turned around and looked at Zhao Guang who was busy reviewing documents in his study room. He then looked at the Zhao Hongyu who was busy cooking in the kitchen. Lastly, he looked at Zhao Yanzi who looked like the pretty girl next door. He had a cozy feeling about this scene.This family of three looked like a normal and well-off family. \u201cI suddenly became a member of their family?\u201dHao Ren felt confused.\u201cDinner time!\u201d Zhao Hongyu brought the last two dishes out from the kitchen and said loudly.Zhao Yanzi\u2019s father, Zhao Guang, put down the documents in his hand and walked out from the study room.\u201cHao Ren, come eat with us,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said to Hao Ren gently.Zhao Yanzi stared at Hao Ren and looked unsatisfied.\u201cDon\u2019t make that face. Even if Hao Ren isn\u2019t your fianc\u00e9, he\u2019s still our guest,\u201d Zhao Hongyu patted Zhao Yanzi\u2019s head and scolded her.Hao Ren\u2019s brain froze again when he heard the word \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d.\u201cSit down and eat,\u201d Zhao Guang sat down firmly and said to Hao Ren.Hao Ren felt a little awkward, but he couldn\u2019t resist their invitation. He could only find a seat and sit down.The table was just big enough for the four of them.\u201cAre you busy at school?\u201d Zhao Hongyu passed Hao Ren a pair of chopsticks and asked.\u201cUh, it\u2019s alright,\u201d Hao Ren answered and felt weird. He just met them. Why was he eat at their house and interact with them like a family?He thought for a while and finally remembered that he was here to ask about the information regarding the \u201cDragon Clan\u201d.\u201cI know that you have a lot of questions about us, but I believe you will get used to it gradually,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said as if she knew what Hao Ren was thinking.\u201cZi is just in her second year of middle school. Normally speaking, it\u2019s too early to talk about marriage at this age. However, these type of things could also be settled in our circle at an early age. I must say that Zi\u2019s life is in your hands.\u201dHao Ren was stunned. Then he became serious.\u201cYou swallowed Zi\u2019s internal core. In fact, we can take it out by force from your body, but it will definitely cause you a severe injury. Zi is actually a kind-hearted person, and she doesn\u2019t want to solve this violently. From my perspective, I don\u2019t want another person to bear the consequences of Zi\u2019s mistake.\u201dZhao Hongyu paused a bit here. Hao Ren couldn\u2019t resist looking at Zhao Yanzi at this moment, but she turned her head away.\u201cSo, we\u2019ve decided to keep Zi\u2019s internal core in your body and make you start cultivating. However, I must mention that this is not entirely safe either. If you can\u2019t reach a certain level in a certain amount of time\u2026 in other words, if your body can\u2019t suppress the overflowing energy of the internal core, the aftermath will be dangerous as well,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said.Hao Ren became nervous when the elegant and gentle Zhao Hongyu suddenly turned so serious.\u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you more,\u201d Zhao Guang suddenly said, \u201cActually, there won\u2019t be any negative effects for Zi if we take it out of your body and return it to her. Yet, in order to have other elders believe in us, I asked Elder Lu to lie. He told them that Zi wouldn\u2019t be able to adjust to the dragon core after it has stayed in your body. It was for them to not take away your life.\u201dAfter hearing his words, Hao Ren felt like he was amongst countless dangers. He was half a step to heaven so many times a few days ago.Zhao Guang looked at Hao Ren. \u201cYou have two options now. First, let us take out the core by force. This is a huge risk. Second, cultivate according to what we give you. There will still be a risk, but it would be way smaller.\u201d\u201cWhat I want to know is\u2026\u201d Hao Ren looked at Zhao Yanzi, \u201cHow will Zi be affected after losing it?\u201dHearing Hao Ren called her \u201cZi\u201d, Zhao Yanzi pouted her lips and didn\u2019t comment on it.\u201cThere isn\u2019t any danger at the moment. However, three years later when Zi turns eighteen, if you can\u2019t open up the all the openings of the dragon core and transfer half of the Connate Dragon Essence back to her, she won\u2019t be able to live for more than two years,\u201d Zhao Guang said.Silence suddenly struck the dining table.\u201cIn other words, if we follow the second option, everybody has to take risks. Zi won\u2019t have to take any risks with the first option, but it will be very dangerous for me. Is that right?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cIndeed.\u201d Zhao Guang nodded.The dining table was silent once again..\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the fianc\u00e9 thing?\u201d Hao Ren asked\u201cThat was the condition of the second option. If everyone chooses the second option, you guys could only accomplish required rituals by marrying each other,\u201d Zhao Guang said slowly.\u201cMarrying each other?\u201d Hao Ren thought about it and suddenly understood. He looked at Zhao Yanzi\u2019s face, which was as red as a tomato at the moment.\u201cIs there any other options?\u201d Hao Ren thought and asked.\u201cTemporarily no,\u201d Zhao Guang answered straight away.Silence struck the dining table once again.\u201cThis little girl, Zhao Yanzi, betted her life on me. What else is there to hesitate about?\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.\u201cDon\u2019t kill him, but I don\u2019t want to marry him either,\u201d Zhao Yanzi suddenly spoke.\u201cThese two conditions can\u2019t coexist,\u201d Zhao Hongyu reminded her.\u201cAnyhow, I won\u2019t marry him.\u201d Zhao Yanzi pouted her lips as her face turned red.\u201cThen kill him?\u201d Zhao Hongyu asked.\u201cEh\u2026 we don\u2019t have to.\u201d Zhao Yanzi bit her lips as she was put into a dilemma. After all, it was her mistake, and Hao Ren was innocent.\u201cSince you guys don\u2019t have any objections, let\u2019s follow the second option,\u201d Zhao Guang hit the table and said, \u201cLet\u2019s eat!\u201d\u201cDaddy\u2026\u201d Yanzi still wanted to protest, but she was stopped by the expression on Zhao Guang\u2019s face.\u201cZi, you have to take responsibility for your mistake\u2026\u201d Zhao Hongyu comforted Zhao Yanzi, \u201cI\u2019ve done some research on Hao Ren. He\u2019s a great kid who is considerate and respectful towards elders. Your dad and I are very satisfied, or why else would we agree to this? As long as you are not willful, he will treat you nicely for sure.\u201dHearing Zhao Hongyu\u2019s words, Hao Ren who sat on the opposite side of her, stiffened his body awkwardly and didn\u2019t know how to respond. He never thought about having a little girl as a fianc\u00e9e.\u201cHow\u2019s your English, Ren?\u201d Zhao Hongyu asked Hao Ren suddenly. After confirming that Hao Ren would be Zi\u2019s fianc\u00e9, she addressed him differently.\u201cHmm, it\u2019s alright,\u201d Hao Ren responded and thought that they would\u2019ve known how good his English was better than himself since they already investigated him.\u201cWell, Zi is pretty good at all subjects but English. Come tutor Zi in English every day for the time being and get to know her better,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said.\u201cWho wants to get to know him better\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi pouted her lips and said quietly.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Hao Ren wasn\u2019t sure about coming here every night. Besides, he never had experience as a tutor before.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAt the same time, Zi can also teach you about cultivation. I think it\u2019ll be great for everyone that you guys help each other out,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said.Thinking that his cultivation was related to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s life, Hao Ren wouldn\u2019t dare to be careless even though he couldn\u2019t accept her being his fianc\u00e9e. He thought about it and said, \u201cFine, but you guys don\u2019t need to send the car to pick me up. I\u2019ll come on my own.\u201d\u201cSure. It\u2019s not too far from your campus. If you take the bus, route 767 would be able to get you here directly.\u201d Zhao Hongyu smiled when Hao Ren agreed to her plan. It was a very sweet smile.Hao Ren turned around and looked at Zhao Yanzi. He thought that this little girl\u2019s facial features and body shape were very similar to her mom\u2019s. Once she grows up, she would be an exceedingly beautiful woman.\u201cHumph!\u201d Zhao Yanzi snorted and avoided Hao Ren\u2019s eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The atmosphere around the dining table wasn\u2019t as awkward as earlier.Throughout the conversation, Hao Ren learned that the interior design was done by Zhao Hongyu herself. Zhao Hongyu\u2019s normal identity was a designer and was well-known in the designer\u2019s community.After chatting further, Hao Ren found out surprisingly that one of the top ten landmarks in East Ocean City was also a masterpiece of Zhao Yanzi\u2019s mother. It was the stadium shown in the promotional pictures of the admission brochures of East Ocean University. It just finished construction last year.\u201cHer father is a successful businessman and her mother is an outstanding designer. This kind of family is clearly above well-off. Even if they don\u2019t have their hidden identities, a little girl like Zhao Yanzi still has enough assets to be proud of.\u201d Hao Ren ate and thought at the same time.While dining, Zhao Hongyu was the one who mainly talked to Hao Ren. Zhao Guang ate steadily beside her and would say something once in a while. Zhao Yanzi had her head down, ate and chewed the food heavily as if she was not eating rice but eating Hao Ren.\u201cThat so-called meeting with in-laws would probably be like this,\u201d Hao Ren answered their questions and thought.\u201cAre your parents out of the country?\u201d Zhao Hongyu asked Hao Ren.\u201cYes, they should be back next month,\u201d Hao Ren answered.Zhao Hongyu thought and said, \u201cHow about a meet-up between the two families when your parents come back?\u201dHao Ren\u2019s heart dropped. He finally accepted the fact that he had to be with Zhao Yanzi in the long run, but Zhao Hongyu\u2019s new request once again made him feel uneasy.\u201cIf mom and dad find out that I found a middle-schooler fianc\u00e9e when they were away, I am not sure what their reaction will be\u2026\u201d\u201cSince everything is settled, it\u2019s normal for the two families to meet,\u201d Zhao Hongyu saw Hao Ren\u2019s hesitation and said.Hao Ren looked at Zhao Hongyu\u2019s gentle expression and knew that she really wanted to settle this matter from her ardent gaze. After all, from her perspective, parents still had a say in this type of thing.\u201cI didn\u2019t say I\u2019ll marry him!\u201d Zhao Yanzi raised her head and finally said something.\u201cYou have to be responsible for the mistake you made. If you didn\u2019t run off, why would there be this issue? Is it that you want others to bear the consequences of your wrongdoings?\u201d Zhao Hongyu\u2019s expression was still gentle, but her tone turned harsh.Zhao Yanzi stopped talking because she knew that she was in the wrong. Yet, she was very unwilling if she had to marry this \u201cuncle\u201d because of that kind of mistake.\u201cHao Ren is thoughtful, and I am happy with him,\u201d Zhao Hongyu looked at Zhao Yanzi and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not young anymore, and you can\u2019t always lose your temper like a child. You have to take on the responsibility that you ought to take. How long can your dad and I protect you? We also want you to mature from what had happened. You can\u2019t continue to act like a spoiled child.\u201dZhao Yanzi looked at Zhao Hongyu with a sad expression when she heard Zhao Hongyu. She wanted to cry but didn\u2019t want to disgrace herself in front of Hao Ren. All that she could do was to bite her lip and endure it.Seeing Zhao Hongyu lecture Zhao Yanzi, her father Zhao Guang remained silent. He obviously agreed with what Zhao Hongyu said.Hao Ren felt that there was another meaning behind how Zhao Yanzi\u2019s parents were treating this matter. However, Zhao Yanzi was too young to understand.\u201cAre they trying to utilize this chance to entrust Zi to me? Can it be that even with their capability and background, there are still some dangers that they can\u2019t talk about?\u201d Hao Ren thought.\u201cRen.\u201d Zhao Hongyu turned and looked at Hao Ren, \u201cZi still has the temper of a kid, please bear with her in the future.\u201d\u201cYes, I know,\u201d at this time, Hao Ren could only agree.Seeing Zhao Yanzi\u2019s red eyes as if she was about to cry, Zhao Guang felt bad even though he had his poker face on. He said to her, \u201cGo take some rest if you\u2019re done.\u201dZhao Yanzi nodded and ran upstairs. Her footsteps making a series of \u201cda da da\u201d sound.Hao Ren looked at her tiny figure and then turned back to look at Zhao Hongyu and Zhao Guang.\u201cLet her be alone for a while,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said.Hao Ren smiled awkwardly with his head down.\u201cHonestly speaking, what do you think of Zi?\u201d Zhao Hongyu asked.Hao Ren actually didn\u2019t have any good impression towards this ill-tempered little girl, but he can\u2019t talk about any shortcomings in front of her parents. Thus, Hao Ren thought very hard to think about Zhao Yanzi\u2019s merits.\u201cShe\u2019s quite pretty. Even though she has a temper, she\u2019s still really cute,\u201d he thought for a few seconds and said. Pretty and cute were probably the only strengths that he could think of.\u201cYou\u2019re older than her. Please take care of her for us. Her father and I are usually busy with many things, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t have much time to take care of her. This has made her personality more stubborn and arrogant,\u201d Zhao Hongyu looked at Hao Ren and said sincerely.\u201cOk.\u201d Hao Ren nodded. Even though he didn\u2019t really like the little pepper (Chinese way of saying someone is fierce and hard to deal with. Usually applies to girls) Zhao Yanzi, he was very touched by how caring her parents were.He could actually understand Zhao Yanzi\u2019s feeling. When he was young, his parents were also busy working and didn\u2019t take care of him much. Therefore, he was more independent and egocentric. It was fortunate that he had a caring grandma who always looked after him, and that allowed him to have better memories of his childhood.\u201cGo upstairs and keep her company.\u201d Zhao Hongyu pointed at the direction of the stairs with her lips.\u201cOkay.\u201d Hao Ren immediately put down his chopsticks and walked up the wooden stairs onto the second floor.A few abstract paintings were hung on the walls along the stairs. Hao Ren walked slowly; it felt like he was in an art gallery. Through a small window in the corner of the second floor, Hao Ren saw the tranquil and beautiful backyard and couldn\u2019t help but admire Zhao Hongyu\u2019s sense of design.Zhao Yanzi\u2019s bedroom was the first room on the corner of the second floor. Hao Ren could tell by the tiny black toy cat hanging on the door.He stood at the door and knocked.No sound came from the inside.\u201cHello, you won\u2019t let me in?\u201d Hao Ren stood there for a few seconds and asked.\u201cYou can tell on me if you want.\u201d Zhao Yanzi\u2019s voice full of grievance came from inside.Hao Ren smiled and took a few small steps on purpose to create the illusion of him walking downstairs.Dong dong dong\u2026 a quick running sound came from the bedroom. Zhao Yanzi thought Hao Ren actually went downstairs to tell on her and rushed to open the door.She ran out of the bedroom, wanting to drag Hao Ren from the stairs. However, she didn\u2019t anticipate that Hao Ren would still be standing at the door. Thus, she ran straight into his chest.The soft and petite body didn\u2019t hurt Hao Ren but rather tickled his belly.Hao Ren caught the little careless girl\u2019s shoulder with his hands and looked down at her, \u201cAm I the type of person who would tell on others?\u201dZhao Yanzi raised her head and blushed. Although it was her misjudgment, she still said stubbornly, \u201cYou look like one!\u201dHao Ren smiled and didn\u2019t argue with her. He pushed her away slightly and walked into her bedroom.\u201cHey! Where are your manners? Don\u2019t just randomly come into my bedroom.\u201d Zhao Yanzi stood at the door and looked at Hao Ren with disdain.\u201cYou have a problem with me entering my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s bedroom?\u201d Hao Ren turned his head, looked at her on purpose, and said.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi stared at Hao Ren. She was angry but couldn\u2019t vent her anger.Her eyes were red, and it seemed like she actually cried. Hao Ren saw this and didn\u2019t want to really bully her. He avoided her angry eyes and pretended to look around her bedroom casually.Through the floor-to-ceiling window, the tiny bedroom could enjoy the scenery of ancient-themed flowers and trees. The sunlight poured in from outside and shined on the transparent glass. It was a type of beauty that would blind one\u2019s eyes.A light green fish tank was placed on top of the windowsill with a few goldfishes inside. The huge framed calligraphy post hung on top of the bed brought a unique and artistic atmosphere.Yet, the light khaki wall color showcased the coziness of the room, and the stuffed teddy bear especially proved that the owner of this bedroom was still a little girl who needed attention and care.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why are you so mad?\u201d He asked lightly.Zhao Yanzi didn\u2019t answer him; she probably didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cI\u2019ll leave if I\u2019m not welcomed here,\u201d Hao Ren continued.\u201cNo!\u201d Zhao Yanzi semi-rolled her eyes and said, \u201cYou can stay here.\u201dSeeing her expression, Hao Ren knew that she was asking him to stay to avoid scolding from her parents.\u201cWhat can I do then?\u201d He asked.\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d Zhao Yanzi sat in front of the computer and reactivated the screen with her mouse.The desktop was a picture of her in a bikini at the beach. Her delicate skin glowed radiantly under the sun amongst the blue waves. She had a bright smile, and her little tongue stuck out wittily in the picture which showed her even and white teeth. Who would have known she was a little devil in reality?She quickly switched the screen as she must have noticed that Hao Ren was looking at the picture. However, Hao Ren couldn\u2019t see her expression from where he was.Zhao Yanzi started to play the most popular game lately \u201cPlants Vs. Zombies.\u201d She focused on continuing her last level as she had decided to ignore Hao Ren. (This is an older book as you can tell from the game.)Hao Ren walked to the desk out of boredom and took out a book randomly from the shelf. Zhao Yanzi carried on with her game without paying attention to him.Hao Ren sat down in a chair near the balcony. He read the novel in the afternoon sunshine.Zhao Yanzi couldn\u2019t help but glimpse at him while she played the game.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like a bad guy even though he\u2019s not that cute\u2026\u201d She thought to herself as she looked at Hao Ren, who was reading quietly in the sun.\u201cBut to marry him\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi felt internally conflicted.She pouted as she carried on with her game.Time flew by as she fought through many levels. She was deeply focused on the game and completely forgot about Hao Ren.There were more and more zombies on her screen and the pea-shooters Zhao Yanzi planted weren\u2019t enough to defeat them. She could do nothing but watch the zombies break through the door.She failed the level five times and finally got frustrated by it. She threw the mouse on the desk as if she was mad at her computer.\u201cStupid.\u201d A voice came from behind her.She turned around, not knowing when Hao Ren got behind her.Her face immediately blushed. She blamed herself for being too focused and forgot about Hao Ren\u2019s existence. However, it wasn\u2019t completely her fault as this was her own bedroom and she had always been alone in here. Her complete attention was in the game, and it made her forget about the silent \u201cguest\u201d in her room.\u201cNone of your business!\u201d She finally burst out after two seconds of silence.\u201cPlant two rolls of Sunflowers in the back; leave an empty roll for Ice Pea-shooters in the front; plant another roll of Pea-shooters in front of that; then plant a roll of potatoes. Same in the water except planting the lotus leaves first,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cPttf, that would never work!\u201d Zhao Yanzi wasn\u2019t convinced.Having ignored her, Hao Ren returned to the balcony to read.Zhao Yanzi pondered on her chair before she started the level again.She successfully passed the level using Hao Ren\u2019s strategy.\u201cDid it work?\u201d Hao Ren asked as he quietly read his book.\u201cNo!\u201d Zhao Yanzi said in a fit of pique.Hao Ren stood up, pretending to go over and check. Zhao Yanzi quickly exited the game in panic.However, that desktop photo was completely shown to Hao Ren.\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026Don\u2019t look at it!\u201d Zhao Yanzi stood up hastily to block his view.This photo showed her body in a swimsuit. How can it be seen by other people!\u201cI\u2019ve already seen the live version. What\u2019s so special about the picture?\u201d Hao Ren said with disdain.Zhao Yanzi gritted her teeth and clenched her fists. She hit Hao Ren on his chest.Thanks to the loss of her Internal Core, it wasn\u2019t a strong hit. Instead of causing pain on Hao Ren\u2019s chest, it was somehow done in a pettishly charming manner.Zhao Yanzi was a bit satisfied with Hao Ren\u2019s reaction because he was covering his chest and pretending to be hurt. \u201cHumph, I shall teach you another lesson if you say something like that again!\u201d She said.She then sat down and continued with her \u201cPlants Vs. Zombies\u201d game.Hao Ren was bored of reading, so he dragged a chair beside her and watched her play.Zhao Yanzi was, in fact, bored of playing alone, so she was glad he came to watch her. Not to mention she certainly needed some help with some levels.\u201cPlant a Chomper here\u2026\u201d\u201cHere, collect the sun!\u201d\u201cHere comes the last wave. Get the Cherry Bombs ready.\u201dHao Ren kept on instructing on the side.\u201cSo annoying! I know!\u201d Zhao Yanzi blamed him as she did what he said. Her hand was moving quickly with the mouse.The two of them were too focused on the screen to realize Zhao Hongyu had quietly pushed open the door a bit, took a look at them as she stood by the door, and left in delight.Time flew until they reached the last level; it was dinnertime.Bang bang bang\u2026there was a knock on the door.Zhao Yanzi paused the game as Hao Ren came to his senses as well.\u201cOk, enough gaming. Time for dinner,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said in a gentle tone.Zhao Yanzi turned her head to the door and then looked back to her side. She suddenly realized Hao Ren\u2019s head and her head got so close without them even noticing.She quickly tilted her body forward by 45 degrees to get away from Hao Ren. At the same time, Hao Ren also noticed that they were too close. He coughed twice in embarrassment and sat straight.Zhao Yanzi turned off the computer and hastily walked out of the room as she pretended to be calm.\u201cI do not like that guy at all\u2026how come I was having so much fun playing games with him\u2026\u201d She walked down the stairs in self-accusation.Hao Ren was also wondering why he was so into playing games with the little girl.They saw the table packed with delicious dishes when they got to the little dining room downstairs.\u201cIt\u2019s late, and I should get going,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cHave dinner here,\u201d Zhao Guang said in a calm tone. It sounded more like a command than an invitation.\u201cWould they keep me for the night too after the dinner?\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.But he quickly abandoned the unrealistic idea and sat down in embarrassment.It was a usual family dinner where Zhao Hongyu and Zhao Guang talked about the trivial things in life. Hao Ren was randomly listening in when they talked about things he didn\u2019t understand.Certainly, the couple didn\u2019t keep Hao Ren for the night after dinner. He was sensible and said goodbye.\u201cGo see him off, Zi,\u201d Zhao Hongyu told her daughter.Zhao Yanzi stood up reluctantly. She looked at Hao Ren and followed him to the door.Hao Ren turned back from the crosswalk outside of their house and saw Zhao Yanzi\u2019s pouting little lips; it could probably hang a necklace. \u201cIt\u2019s ok. You can go back now,\u201d he said.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d she turned around to leave.\u201cZi!\u201d Zhao Hongyu\u2019s voice sounded.Reluctantly, Zhao Yanzi turned back again as she looked at Hao Ren sadly.Hao Ren walked towards the bus stop 500 meters away without a word, and Zhao Yanzi kept her 30-centimeter distance from him. Her way of 'seeing him off\u201d was following him without being in his sight.It could be seen that she was made to do this by her parents from her reluctant look.The two of them didn\u2019t say a word on the way. Zhao Yanzi kicked at little pebbles along the path from time to time as if she was expressing her madness on them.The ruffle sleeves of her white t-shirt and her red floral-patterned short skirt were fluttering in the wind.If it weren\u2019t for her pouting lips, her outfit and her cute look were very attractive. As Zhou Liren\u2019s catchphrase goes: a little sweet, a little cute, a little mature, and a little sexy\u2026The 500-meter distance wasn\u2019t too long, but it wasn\u2019t too short either. Soon Zhao Yanzi walked Hao Ren to the bus stop.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAlright, off you go now,\u201d Hao Ren turned and said to her.\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi nodded with her head down.She suddenly looked up with a complex expression. Then she turned and walked back.Hao Ren realized that he didn\u2019t even have her number as he watched her leave. Even though she was just a mid-schooler, she should have a cellphone given how wealthy her family was.He stood at the stop as he watched Zhao Yanzi walk away without looking back. Hao Ren thought to himself, \u201cShe sure wouldn\u2019t want to marry an \u2018uncle\u2019 like me\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hao Ren got on the bus, opened the window, and tried to slowly sort out the things that had happened recently while feeling the city\u2019s wind on his face.The current situation was that he had a fianc\u00e9e that he didn\u2019t know much about, and he got himself into a circle that he has never heard about. Moreover, he was assigned to some extra work and had an extra identity.However, he forgot to ask Zhao Guang about their circle or anything about the cultivation techniques. He just met the other two people in Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family as their 'son-in-law\u201d.Zhao Yanzi\u2019s father seemed quite cold but was probably also someone very righteous. Zhao Yanzi\u2019s mother was a very kind and intelligent woman\u2026 that was the only impression Hao Ren had on them.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me from now on I have to go to their home for dinner every day.\u201d Hao Ren felt a bit distracted. After thinking about the situation for a while, he got off the bus three stops ahead.At the Xinhua Bookstore, Hao Ren carefully browsed around in the middle school study guide area and finally bought some books such as [Middle School English Test Bank] and [Grade Eight English Knowledge Collection].Walking out of the bookstore with a couple of heavy books in hand and looking back at the countless amount of study guides on the shelves, Hao Ren was already covered with sweat. He had to felt pity for the mid-schoolers who were under a lot of pressure.Hao Ren suddenly realized that the news about him being picked up by the Lincoln Stretch Limousine at noon in front of the dorm area had to have been widely spread among his classmates by now. If he went back now, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get away from their endless questions. He was always trying to keep a low profile and didn\u2019t want to get too much attention from the others. Therefore, after thinking for a bit, he walked across the street and got on the bus that would take him home.The bus was slightly bumpy, and the night slowly came. Hao Ren held a bunch of English study material in his arms, still feeling lost.Beep beep beep beep\u2026 his phone suddenly rang.\u201cRen, why aren\u2019t you back yet?!\u201d After picking up the phone, he heard Zhao Jiayi\u2019s yelling tone.\u201cI\u2019m going home today, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Hao Ren asked even though he knew why.\u201cDude, had a great time today? What on earth was going on during the day? we were all shocked by you,\u201d Zhao Jiayi asked over the phone.\u201cEm, nothing really. It was the relative from last time, asking me to have a meal at their home,\u201d Hao Ren answered casually.\u201cAre you still lying to us? What\u2019s with the fianc\u00e9e situation?\u201d Zhao Jiayi asked loudly on the other side of the line.Hao Ren\u2019s ear almost went deaf from Zhao Jiayi\u2019s yelling. He had to move the phone away from his ear. Although Zhao Jiayi was yelling at him, it was quite touching as Hao Ren understood that the three buddies in the dorm were really worried about him and that was why they called. After all, what kind of relatives would bring two bodyguards dressed in black when they invited someone over for a meal?\u201cJust some minor things. I\u2019ll tell you guys when I come back on Sunday,\u201d Hao Ren said. He was actually speechless about what Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family did today. They wished that he could keep their circle a secret. But on the other hand, the way they acted was so eye-catching that it drew so much attention.\u201cBut who could ever imagine how strange their identities are? The greatest geniuses often lie to conceal. However, by keeping too much of a low and mysterious profile, it may draw in even more attention from others,\u201d Hao Ren continued to wonder.\u201cFine, we will wait for you to come back and continue our investigation.\u201d Zhao Jiayi hung up the phone.Not until this second did Hao Ren notice that there were many messages from his classmates like Zhao Jiayi as well as Class President Xie Yujia on his phone.He sighed and then deleted all of the messages at once. He laid his head back down against the window and took a nap. It was very late at night when he got home. His grandma was surprised and glad to see her sweet grandson.Seeing the extreme joy on his grandma\u2019s face, Hao Ren was debating if he should tell her about the \u2018future granddaughter-in-law\u2019. However, he decided to hold back after struggling for a few minutes.After spending the weekend peacefully with his grandma, he planned to go back to the university on Sunday evening so he could avoid the crazy gossips.A big pile of snacks couldn\u2019t distract the interest of Zhao Jiayi and others. Hearing Hao Ren was back, even the guys from other dorm rooms flooded over.\u201cHey man, you made such a big scene! Getting picked up by a Lincoln Stretch Limousine? I heard that even the super rich guy Chen Ke from the advanced class didn\u2019t get such a treatment,\u201d while continuously tapping Hao Ren\u2019s shoulder, Huang Jianfeng from the dorm room across the hall said with envy and jealousy.\u201cWe heard about the fianc\u00e9e. Tell us the truth,\u201d Yu Rong from the dorm room at the corner across also yelled.\u201cEven the girls were talking about you. They were saying that your family is actually very rich. Hehe, Wang Jia, the girl who used to look down on you, was even talking about you too.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you hired some people to put on a show in order to cause a sensation?\u201d\u201cOh, that little girl was cute, what\u2019s her name?\u201d\u201cDude, you seem quiet at the university, but you actually have lots of girls outside, don\u2019t you?\u201dThey were starting to stretch the situation too far, Hao Ren could only remain speechless and helpless.\u201cAlright alright, stop making things up. It was a joke set up by one of my friends. It actually freaked me out too on Friday. I shouldn\u2019t have made such a big scene, How about we all go out to eat? I will pay!\u201d He stood up trying to shut their mouths.Those guys wouldn\u2019t refuse a free meal. They all rushed out of the dorm building while dragging Hao Ren with them.Although most of them had eaten dinner already, they couldn\u2019t resist the kind invitation for hot pot from Hao Ren. Hao Ren had no choice but to spend some money to apologize to them for the drama in order to end it all.After endless gluttony, Hao Ren roughly took care of them. What he heard from those close friends was that his behavior also drew the attention of some guys and girls in upper-years. Not only people in the second-year but also those from other years and majors had opinions about Hao Ren because of that.Tall trees always catch a lot of wind. Hao Ren didn\u2019t expect that he would catch the attention of the influential students and also annoyed them. It was true that whoever showed off would get punishedHaving dined and wined to satiety, all those close buddies from Hao Ren\u2019s dorm room and close dorm rooms went back while wrapping their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders.They ran into the vice-principal Lu Qing and some other officials of the university who were inspecting the dorms.Seeing the vice-principal coming, all the guys who were burping and singing songs instantly restrained themselves as it wasn\u2019t proper to go out and have drinks at night.To everyone\u2019s surprise, Vice-Principal Lu Qing only smiled and waved at them even though he saw that they were all drunk.Lu Qing walked by them with the other officials, leaving all the guys looked at each other in speechless despair.\u201cDid I just see the vice-principal wave at us?\u201d Zhou Liren asked Zhao Jiayi in confusion after sobering up.The other guys had no idea either about what had just happened.They thought the vice-principal would scold them after knowing that they went out for drinks or at least came to ask which major and class they were from. As they were all too shocked to see the vice-principal and struggled to come up with an excuse, the vice-principal only kindly waved at them and then walked by like nothing happened.\u201cStrange things happen every year, but there are a lot more this year,\u201d releasing a sigh of relief, Zhou Liren uttered.What Hao Ren knew was that Lu Qing was actually saying hi to him. Lu Qing knew about his visit to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s home. Without a doubt, Hao Ren believed that Lu Qing acted that way to encourage him.That little girl had been tremendously sought after and loved; no wonder her temper was quite overbearing.However, Hao Ren wouldn\u2019t share those things with his buddies as who knew what they would think of if they found out that the vice-principal had Hao Ren covered.They went back to the dorm noisily. Some started playing cards while some went on their computers. Not until the lights shut off at midnight did they unwillingly went back to their own dorm rooms.Hao Ren got up furtively after the other three in the room fell asleep. He went to the balcony to practice what was called \u201cSpirit Concentration Scroll\u201d.The moonlight shone on the entire dorm. Hao Ren felt a weak airstream circulate in his body, then he slowly threw all the distracting thoughts away and entered a dimly discernible realm.He realized it was four o\u2019clock in the morning when he finished practicing. There were only a few hours left before class started. He looked back and found the other three were still sound asleep, so he rushed back inside quietly and went to bed to catch some sleep.He was in full spirit and energy even though he had just practiced the Spirit Concentration Scroll. He recalled the scriptures in his mind and reviewed it a few more times since he wasn\u2019t exhausted at all.He was able to feel the so-called \u201cQi\u201d by practicing the scroll for a few days. If this scroll were ever revealed to the world, it would definitely shock the entire traditional Qigong world. Hao Ren\u2019s imagination ran wild while he was trying to figure out the various meanings in the scroll.What he forgot was that there was a unique Internal Core in his body which was worth three hundred years of cultivation for a normal person.Unknowingly, dawn arrived. Zhou Liren shouted to wake everyone up with full vim and vigor. The first class on Monday was Advanced Mathematics. The teacher of the class was an extremely strict old man. Thus they didn\u2019t dare to skip the class. Apparently, those who had skipped his class before all received fails for their final grades without exception.The four of them rushed to the cafeteria and then went bustlingly to class.Hao Ren felt quite complicated to see all his classmates again after a weekend. Many of the classmates looked back and pointed at Hao Ren. It seemed that him getting picked up by the Lincoln Stretch Limousine on Friday had left a deep impression.Hao Ren spent ten minutes copying his homework and then handed it to the Class President Xie Yujia.\u201cWhat happened on Friday?\u201d Xie Yujia asked as she took Hao Ren\u2019s work. She usually turned a blind eye to Hao Ren\u2019s copied homework as long as he could pass the exams.\u201cI was invited by a relative for lunch,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cI heard someone mentioned fianc\u00e9e.\u201d Xie Yujia kept asking.\u201cThat was just a joke,\u201d Hao Ren answered calmly, indicating that he didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore.Xie Yujia stopped asking. She turned around to collect the homework from the back row.Seeing that, Zhou Liren who sat beside Hao Ren bumped Hao Ren with his elbow and said happily, \u201cShe seems interested in you.\u201d\u201cShe will ask you too if you got picked up by a limousine,\u201d Hao Ren cast a glance at him and said.Zhou Liren laughed even more brightly. No one knew what that was about.The class was extremely boring. Formulas for calculus might be difficult for girls, but it wasn\u2019t hard to understand at all for people like Hao Ren who was the top student of his science class in high school.Among all the courses, his weakest one was English.Hao Ren took a three-hundred-page English test bank out of his backpack and started working on it.Zhou Liren who also had no interest in the class moved closer to Hao Ren with curiosity. \u201cPracticing English questions?\u201d He was even more shocked when he noticed it was an English test bank. \u201cQuestions for middle school? What do you want? Go back to middle school?\u201d\u201cJust to kill time,\u201d Hao Ren responded.Zhou Liren didn\u2019t buy it. \u201cBe honest with me, are you flirting with some girls in middle school?\u201dHearing their conversation, Cao Ronghua and Zhao Jiayi got closer too. \u201cRen, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cAlright alright.\u201d Hao Ren had enough of them. \u201cI\u2019m going to be tutoring a girl.\u201d\u201cA girl? Is she pretty?\u201d Zhou Liren\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cIs it the one who looked for you at the university last time?\u201d Thinking for a while, Zhao Jiayi asked.Hao Ren sighed and said, \u201cIt is her.\u201d\u201cNo wonder she made a tremendous uproar last time, she is the one you are tutoring.\u201d Zhao Jiayi realized suddenly.\u201cThen it was her who asked someone to pick you up last Friday?\u201d Cao Ronghua asked.Hao Ren nodded.\u201cDude! You are hooking up with a pretty little rich girl now.\u201d Zhou Liren put his arm around Hao Ren\u2019s neck and expressed his jealousy.\u201cHey, you! What are you guys talking about back there!\u201d The old man stopped lecturing and stare angrily at the four of them.They lowered their heads down immediately, pretending they were listening carefully.\u201cGo stand in the corner if you guys don\u2019t want to listen to this class!\u201d The old man kept lecturing after letting off one more time.Xie Yujia looked back at Hao Ren, shaking her head helplessly.Zhou Liren mumbled, lowering his voice, \u201cThat little girl is a bit wild, but she is very pretty. How about asking her to come here next time.\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d Hao Ren responded in a low voice. Zhou Liren thought Zhao Yanzi was just an innocent little girl, but Hao Ren knew that she wasn\u2019t someone easy to deal with.Moreover, if anything annoyed or pissed off Zhao Yanzi and she told Lu Qing on him, then Zhou Liren would have more trouble than he could handle.The morning Advanced Mathematics class ended. As everyone was about to be dismissed and go for lunch, the Class President Xie Yujia stood up. \u201cPlease stay everybody, I have something to announce!\u201dHao Ren was unconsciously shocked. He thought it was going to be about him. Instead, he saw Xie Yujia walking up to the dais. \u201cThe Athletic Games is coming up next week, the university required that at least six people from each class would need to attend. Now I have to make the headcount.\u201d (Athletic Games is where selected students from each class competed in different events.)Xie Yujia was dressed in a cool t-shirt and shorts. A regular cartoon t-shirt matching light-washed jean shorts made her very pretty.The guys who were about to leave all stopped as they saw Xie Yujia.She stood on her tipping toes and raised her arms trying to get the attention of everyone in the class. However, moving while standing on the dais made her look as if she was striking a pose.Having a slim and colorful belt that showed off her gorgeous slim waist was what made her casual outfit stand out more.\u201cShe is indeed the Class President and the most popular girl in the class,\u201d Zhou Liren mumbled.Seeing the crowd had stopped walking and went quiet, Xie Yujia finally gave a sigh of relief and continued, \u201cI have reserved some spots, you can apply for the rest.\u201d\u201cFirst, Yu Rong, shot put.\u201dSecond, Cai Junjie, high jump.\u201d\u201cThird, Chen Han, 400-meter relay race.\u201d\u201cFourth, Hao Ren! 1500-meter race!\u201dHer voice seemed especially loud when Hao Ren was up.\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d Whoever was called by name appeared extremely helpless.Zhao Jiayi and others looked at Hao Ren, feeling excited about his misfortune.\u201cEveryone be quiet for a second.\u201d Xie Yujia raised her hands again. \u201cThe four I just mentioned are just on the reservation. It is up to the school whether they will be chosen or not. However, we should at least show our positive attitude.\u201dReceiving no response, she asked again, \u201cThere are still two empty spots. Who would like to apply? Most of the events are for men, and we only have a few girls in this class. Can you guys be more involved?\u201dAlthough she said that, who would like to show his face in public for the Athletic Games? It was known that there were numerous athletes in the university. In terms of the guys in the class, they were all geeks who were excellent at dealing with computers but had no talent in sports. Who would be willing to embarrass himself in public?Xie Yujia gritted her teeth when she saw all the guys hesitate. \u201cFine. Then Zhao Jiayi and Zhou Liren! You two are up for the 100-meter race!\u201dZhao Jiayi and Zhou Liren who were just very happy about the other\u2019s misfortune started whining instantly.\u201cEm, that\u2019s all! Everybody can go have lunch!\u201d Xie Yujia bent down to write the names on a notebook and then announced the dismissal.Zhou Liren helplessly watched as Xie Yujia walked out of the classroom through the front door. He then suddenly turn around to look at Hao Ren and said, \u201cShe seems to have something against our dorm room!\u201d\u201cHow would I know!\u201d Hao Ren left his words and then strode out of the classroom through the back door.The afternoon classes were the same; boring and insipid. Zhou Liren who sat beside Hao Ren complained endlessly about how Xie Yujia applied for him without his agreement. Would his \u201cillustrious reputation\u201d be swept down to the ground if he was the last one in the race?\u201cStop worrying so much, it will never be your turn. There are countless athletes in the university, how could you be chosen?\u201d Hao Ren couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. He stopped writing and glared at him.\u201cThat isn\u2019t for sure. What if no one applies and they make me go?\u201d Zhou Liren asked.\u201cThen you can throw yourself on the ground, then all the beautiful girls would remember your cute face and you can successfully complete your girlfriend-searching mission,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cIt\u2019s always easy to say! Em, what a shame\u2026\u201d Zhou Liren covered his face and tried to put on an act,Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHao Ren didn\u2019t bother to respond. He continued doing his middle school level English test bank. Tonight would be his first time tutoring someone.Beep beep, beep beep\u2026\u2026The phone Hao Ren put on the desk suddenly vibrated.He picked up the phone saw a message from Xie Yujia. \u201cThe university has decided to not pick the other five people.

Due to the small size of this course, Hao Ren was only in the same class with Zhou Liren. Cao Ronghua and Zhao Jiayi weren\u2019t in this class.The schedule for their sophomore year was always full. Hao Ren packed his bag to go to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s house at five O\u2019clock in the afternoon.Hao Ren was even more anxious than the day before. He arrived at her house and rang the doorbell.It was Zhao Hongyu who opened the door again in her apron. Her hair was tied up, and her hands were wet with water dripping down from them. She was obviously working in the kitchen.\u201cSo early?\u201d she let Hao Ren in and smiled.\u201cZi hasn\u2019t come back yet?\u201d Hao Ren entered and asked. He was a bit embarrassed about being early. He lacked experience in being a tutor as it was his first time.\u201cNo, her third uncle, her Third Uncle is picking her up because her dad is working late today,\u201d she answered as if Hao Ren was a member of the family. \u201cTake a seat on the couch and watch some TV.\u201dHao Ren put the materials he brought on the coffee table and thought to himself for a few seconds. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I give you a hand in the kitchen?\u201d he said.Zhao Hongyu looked at Hao Ren in surprise for a few seconds before she smiled. \u201cOk.\u201dHao Ren rolled up his sleeves and went into the kitchen with her. He felt terrible eating their food while not helping out.There were all sorts of ingredients and condiments in the kitchen, and they were all neatly placed in order. It seemed like Hao Ren was indeed too early since Zhao Hongyu hadn\u2019t even started cooking yet. She was just about to start preparing for dinner.Hao Ren could tell from the ingredients what dishes Zhao Hongyu was going to make. He walked over quickly and started rinsing the vegetables and cutting up the meat without Zhao Hongyu\u2019s instructions. He seemed like a chef as he knew what he was doing.\u201cRen, you always help out at home, don\u2019t you?\u201d Zhao Hongyu was cutting some meat into strips beside him in a smoother manner.\u201cUm\u2026not really\u2026sometimes I give my grandma a hand,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cI could tell that you are a sensible kid. If only my Zi had half your sensibility.\u201d Zhao Hongyu sighed.\u201cShe\u2019s still young. I only cared about games when I was her age as well,\u201d Hao Ren answered without even thinking.\u201cHave your parents always been away?\u201d Zhao Hongyu continued.Hao Ren answered honestly, \u201cThey are both very busy, and I have spent most of my time with my grandma since I was a boy.\u201dZhao Hongyu pondered, \u201cYour grandma must be very lonely now that you are in university, right?\u201d\u201cI usually go see her on the weekends\u2026\u201dHao Ren sensed Zhao Hongyu\u2019s second intention of the question. He looked at her confusedly.\u201cOnce you and Zi are settled, I can invite your grandma here to live with us,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said after thinking for half a second.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026maybe a bit too soon,\u201d Hao Ren smiled in embarrassment. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about Zi yet.\u201d\u201cShe will find out soon. I know about elders\u2019 thoughts better than you, Um\u2026but I\u2019ll leave the opportunity of telling her that to you.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Hao Ren nodded and continued chopping the potato into thin strips.\u201cOh, what is an inspector?\u201d Hao Ren suddenly remembered and asked.Hao Ren had no idea why he had always felt comfortable with Zhao Hongyu. Maybe it was because the \u201cmotherly\u201d figure to him had always been as virtuous as she was.\u201cOh, you met an inspector?\u201d Zhao Hongyu was a bit surprised.\u201cA professor in my university. Her name is Su Han,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cIt\u2019s her\u2026\u201d Zhao Hongyu became deep in thought.\u201cYou know her?\u201d Hao Ren asked cautiously.\u201cThey are not a group of people who are easy to get along with. But Su Han had a relationship with us East Ocean, so she shouldn\u2019t cause you too much problem,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said.\u201cSounds like there are more than just one inspector? And it sounds like even she respects them,\u201d Hao Ren thought as more confusion arose in his head.Zhao Hongyu continued when she saw the confused look on Hao Ren\u2019s face, \u201cThe so-called inspectors are a group of specially authorized figures of the Dragon Clan who are in charge of supervising Dragon Clan\u2019s internal events. They have the right to interfere with anything that\u2019s against the rules such as bribing and murdering. They have the right to handle it before reporting them to the higher-ups as long as they have evidence of crimes.\u201cTheir power is as big as the imperial guards.\u201d Hao Ren thought. (Imperial guards were a bunch of people who only listened to the emperors of Ming Dynasty. They were like special polices who had more power than most people.)\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate them. Many of them are above the Heavenly Level. Elder Lu is already a master of the East Ocean Dragon Region. But two Elder Lu wouldn\u2019t even be able to defeat Su Han,\u201d Hao Hongyu went on.Hao Ren didn\u2019t have a definite concept of this so-called power. Neither did he know what the fights would be like. But Su Han\u2019s power would probably be much stronger than he could ever imagine.\u201cHow did she know about my identity?\u201d Hao Ren continued as he defined Su Han as a dangerous person he should never get near.\u201cThe fact is we all have our own auras. You are just too low-leveled to sense your own, not to mention others\u2019. Su Han is an extraordinary inspector of the dragon clan. She can certainly see through you,\u201d Zhao Hongyu explained patiently.\u201cCan\u2019t I hide my aura?\u201d Hao Ren asked immediately.\u201cYou can. But if the person is much stronger than you, they can still see it,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said as if she knew exactly what was on Hao Ren\u2019s mind. She continued, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. We are not allowed to kill each other within the Dragon Clan. Su Han won\u2019t hurt you as long as she recognizes your legal identity. She would even protect you.\u201d\u201cLegal identity\u2026am I an illegal character in Su Han\u2019s eyes?\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cPlus we East Ocean Dragon Clan won\u2019t let you get hurt easily!\u201d Zhao Hongyu suddenly straightened her back and added confidently.Hao Ren looked at Zhao Hongyu as her words touched him. She sure considered him as her son-in-law. If it weren\u2019t for that, why would she let him help her in the kitchen and stand up for him?East Ocean Dragon Clan\u2026sounds like it\u2019s really powerful. Su Han should have some respect for them despite her special identity.\u201cIs Zi\u2019s dad of high status in the Dragon Clan?\u201d Hao Ren asked the question that had always been bothering him. He thought it was a good opportunity to ask.\u201cHe\u2019s alright. He\u2019s the king of the East Ocean. He is the leader of East Ocean which occupies 3000 squared kilometers,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said lightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedClick click click\u2026 When Hao Ren was talking to Zhao Hongyu, a clicking noise appeared as if someone was turning the door handle.\u201cZi and her Third Uncle are back. Why don\u2019t you go talk to them and I will handle this myself?\u201d Zhao Hongyu smiled gently and said softly to Hao Ren.Hao Ren replied with a gentle smile, \u201cSure.\u201dHe walked out the kitchen and saw Zi who was wearing the same light-blue school uniform come in with a man with bushy eyebrows and big eyes.\u201cHi, uncle,\u201d Hao Ren hesitated for a moment and said to the man.\u201cHuh!\u201d the man not only did not reply to Hao Ren but his face was also filled with disdain.Zhao Yanzi didn\u2019t try to smooth things out either. She threw her backpack onto the sofa, ran to the kitchen, and started talking to her mom.Hao Ren was a little bummed out after he hit a snag. However, this man was older than him and was the uncle of Zhao Yanzi. Therefore, Hao Ren held back his anger and sat on the sofa as he started going over the stuff he was going to teach Zhao Yanzi.\u201cYou are Hao Ren?\u201d after he saw Hao Ren minding his own business and ignored him, the man with bushy eyebrows and big eyes finally asked.Hao Ren wanted to ignore him at first. However, Hao Ren thought maybe this man didn\u2019t hear his greeting in the first place.He simply replied, \u201cYes.\u201dThis Third Uncle didn\u2019t say anything further and started to observe Hao Ren up and down with his eyes.Hao Ren didn\u2019t think much at first. However, he then realized that this Third Uncle was observing his cultivation progress; that gave him chills down his back.\u201cUseless. Swallowed Zi\u2019s Internal Core and had this much time to cultivate, yet no changes to the body,\u201d the man said after a few seconds of observation.His words were harsh. Even though Hao Ren had a soft personality, he couldn\u2019t hold back his anger.While Hao Ren and the man were staring at each other aggressively, Zhao Yanzi came out of the kitchen and said, \u201cUncle, just ignore him. Mom asked me to ask you, what do you want for dinner?\u201d\u201cHaha, anything will be fine. I am not picky,\u201d the man with bushy eyebrows and big eyes suddenly turned soft like a little sheep as he heard Zhao Yanzi\u2019s question.\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi said as she turned back to the kitchen, \u201cMom! Uncle said anything will be fine, cook whatever you want!\u201dThis Third Uncle\u2019s eyes were filled with joy as he looked at Zhao Yanzi. It was obvious that he loved his niece very much.Zhao Yanzi then ran happily to her Third Uncle and said, \u201cUncle, remember what you promised me in the car?\u201d\u201cAlright, alright. How could uncle forget?\u201d The man took out a wallet from his pocket and handed ten one-hundred-dollar bills to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t let your father know about this!\u201dZhao Yanzi was beaming with joy as she stuck out her tongue and put the money in her little pink wallet. She then hugged her uncle around his neck and said, \u201cThird Uncle is the best!\u201d\u201cYou crazy little girl!\u201d Her uncle rubbed her head with joy, and his face was filled with love.Both the adult and the little girl ignored Hao Ren who was sitting on the couch as if he was transparent.Hao Ren knew that he rubbed this Third Uncle the wrong way and Zhao Yanzi was obviously treating him coldly intentionally to irritate him.Hao Ren knew that she was narrow-minded. Since the Third Uncle of hers loved Zhao Yanzi so much, he wasn\u2019t going to give Hao Ren a good time when Zi disliked Hao Ren so much.Hao Ren continued to look down at the study materials and ignore the two of them.The awkwardness was finally broken when Zhao Hongyu came out of the kitchen with freshly cooked food.\u201cZi! You bothering your uncle again?\u201d Zhao Hongyu said reproachfully to Zhao Yanzi.Zhao Yanzi was giggling and finally stopped playing the childish rock-paper-scissors with her Third Uncle.\u201cCome have dinner with us,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said politely to Hao Ren.Because of the attitudes of Zhao Yanzi and her uncle, Hao Ren didn\u2019t really want to have dinner with them. However, Zhao Hongyu treated him well and he didn\u2019t want to let her down. Thus, he walked to the table with a straight face.The four of them got into their seats in order. Zhao Yanzi sat across from Hao Ren, her Third Uncle and Zhao Hongyu sat beside Hao Ren.\u201cThis is Zi\u2019s uncle, Zhao Kuo. You can call him Third Uncle just like Zi does. Like Elder Lu, he is one of the Elders of East Ocean. Zi can explain the details to you later on,\u201d Zhao Hongyu introduced the man to Hao Ren after she sat down.\u201cThird Uncle,\u201d considering Zhao Hongyu, Hao Ren greeted Zhao Kuo reluctantly.\u201cHm,\u201d Zhao Kuo replied in neither a hostile nor friendly way.Zhao Hongyu noticed that the vibe wasn\u2019t quite harmonious, so she said with a gentle smile, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s eat.\u201d She handed Hao Ren a pair of chopsticks as she talked; she looked seemingly attentive to Hao Ren.Zhao Hongyu was as gentle as water, while Zhao Kuo was unable to calm himself. \u201cSister-in-law, what are you guys thinking? How could an ordinary guy be worthy of a nice girl like Zi?\u201d\u201cHao Ren is a really good kid. I like him. Are you satisfied with this reason?\u201d Zhao Hongyu looked at him and said gently.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Zhao Kuo was speechless as if an egg was stuck down his throat.It was at this moment Hao Ren realized that Zhao Hongyu wasn\u2019t as soft as she seemed. She had this persona where she never repeated herself. She looked like she was even more impressive than Zhao Guang.\u201cOthers might not know, but I do. If he returns the Internal Core to Zi, Zi will not suffer any harm,\u201d after a few seconds, Zhao Kuo finally said.\u201cBut Hao Ren will suffer great harm,\u201d Zhao Hongyu replied.\u201cHe is just an ordinary human. Why should we care\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201d Zhao Hongyu suddenly toughened up, \u201cYour brother isn\u2019t here, and now you dare to argue with me? This decision was agreed upon by the Elders Council. Say no more!\u201dThe fight over Hao Ren had put him in an awkward situation. However, he could feel that Zhao Hongyu was defending him.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Zhao Kuo was not convinced, he wanted to keep on arguing.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAbout Zi\u2019s problem\u2026 we have our own judgments. She has to be responsible for what she did. I know you love Zi, but don\u2019t spoil her! You have to stop cleaning up after her every time she causes trouble!\u201dZhao Hongyu words had become more firm, and Zhao Kuo finally stopped speaking. However, his face was still filled with disdain. Zhao Yanzi\u2019s face kept turning red and pale back and forth, yet she remained silent as she wouldn\u2019t dare to speak up.\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to change your easily irritated temper. So violent. I would like to see how you are going to get through this year\u2019s Tribulation,\u201d Zhao Hongyu\u2019s lowered her tone and said.\u201cAnyways, I still disagree with the decision of Zi marrying a guy like this,\u201d Zhao Kuo mumbled quietly.After a long sigh, Zhao Hongyu didn\u2019t want to argue further.

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedOn the dining table, Zhao Hongyu asked Zhao Yanzi about the things that were happening at her school, and Zhao Yanzi answered.Hao Ren ate quietly and listened to their conversation.Both the mother and the daughter looked alike, but one was gentle and mature, and the other was cute and charming. The contrast of their images was interesting.Zhao Kuo, on the other hand. ate loudly as if he was holding his breath.\u201cZhao Yanzi\u2019s father, Zhao Guang, seemed to be a wise man with great leadership. This Zhao Kuo is probably his younger brother. His personality is reckless and straightforward; he is too different from his older brother. Regarding appearance, he isn\u2019t as good-looking as Zhao Guang. He is darker and looks ferocious,\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.Feeling Hao Ren\u2019s stare, Zhao Kuo raised his head and suddenly glared at Hao Ren. The tanned and bearded face scared Hao Ren.After dinner, the conversation between the mother, Zhao Hongyu, and the daughter, Zhao Yanzi, ended. Zhao Hongyu stood up and cleaned up the dishes. \u201cZi, go upstairs and study with Ren.\u201dZhao Yanzi pouted her small mouth. \u201cI just finished eating. I still want to watch a bit of TV\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019ll be too late for Ren to go back.\u201d Zhao Hongyu denied Zhao Yanzi\u2019s request firmly and didn\u2019t give her any room for discussion.Zhao Yanzi twitched her mouth in sadness as she bit her lips and looked at Hao Ren angrily. It seemed like she wanted to vent her anger on Hao Ren.\u201cQuit stalling! Go upstairs and study!\u201d Zhao Hongyu hurried her.\u201cOkay! I know!\u201d Zhao Yanzi walked towards the stairs and stepped on the wood flooring.Hao Ren laughed, grabbed the study materials, and followed her upstairs. He didn\u2019t even think of Zhao Yanzi as his fianc\u00e9e in his mind but as a troublesome little girl.Unexpectedly, Zhao Kuo followed them upstairs when he saw them go upstairs.\u201cWhy are you going upstairs?\u201d Zhao Hongyu called.\u201cHehe\u2026 I\u2019m just going to take a look upstairs\u2026,\u201d Zhao Kuo scratched his head as he walked upstairs and replied in embarrassment.Obviously, he was worried about leaving Zhao Yanzi and Hao Ren alone. Thus, he followed to supervise them. He also wanted to see how smart Hao Ren was and if he could actually teach Zhao Yanzi.Zhao Hongyu knew clearly that Zhao Kuo went upstairs to kill the mood, but she couldn\u2019t do anything about him. She sighed slightly and continued to clean the table.Hao Ren followed Zhao Yanzi and entered her bedroom. He was caught by surprise when he saw Third Uncle following them inside. Yet, Zhao Kuo was an elder to him, and it was Zhao Yanzi\u2019s bedroom. He didn\u2019t have any reason to kick him out.Zhao Yanzi pouted her lips and sat in front of the desk unhappily.Hao Ren opened up his bag, took out a test paper, and put it in front of her. \u201cFinish this test paper first.\u201d\u201cI still have a lot of assignments to do today!\u201d Zhao Yanzi looked at Hao Ren with an unfriendly attitude.\u201cDo you want me to call your mom upstairs?\u201d Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to argue with her and directly brought up her mom.\u201cHumph!\u201d Zhao Yanzi gave in right away. She took the test paper from him, grabbed a pen, and frowned as she got started.These questions were picked from many test banks by Hao Ren, and they were all simple and basic questions. In order to see what level she was at, he had to give her a test paper like this.Zhao Yanzi bit the tip of the pen and did the questions one by one. Hao Ren dragged a chair, sat beside her, and looked at her quietly.That Third Uncle came and peeked quietly. However, these thickly dotted English words gave him a headache, and he had to sit back down in his original spot and stare at Hao Ren.After half an hour, Zhao Yanzi finally finished the simple test. Hao Ren took it from her, checked it in two minutes, and discovered surprisingly that\u2026 this Zhao Yanzi\u2019s English\u2026 was extremely poor\u2026Seeing the big red cross marks appear more and more on the test paper, Zhao Yanzi couldn\u2019t hold back, \u201cHey! Did I do that many questions wrong?\u201d\u201cYou only have twenty points out of a hundred!\u201d Hao Ren grabbed the test paper and waved it in front of her.\u201cYou did it on purpose!\u201d Zhao Yanzi\u2019s face was pale as she said arrogantly.\u201cOkay,\u201d Hao Ren put the test back to the table, \u201cLet\u2019s start your class officially.\u201d He said.\u201cHuh!\u201d Zhao Yanzi was reluctant.\u201cYou did the second question wrong. \u2018Finish\u2019 is a verb and you need to polish it with the adverb \u2018quickly\u2019. Here it\u2019s saying that it\u2019s faster than other people, so it should be \u2018more quickly\u2019 not \u2018more quick\u2019,\u201d Hao Ren pointed at the second question that she got wrong and explainedZhao Yanzi blushed. \u201cI know! I was careless and read it wrong!\u201dHao Ren ignored her excuse and pointed at the third question, \u201cGo to the beach in July and arriving on July fifth. Use \u2018in\u2019 for the proposition before the year, the month, the season, and the week. When talking about the date specifically, use \u2018on\u2019. If it\u2019s the particular arrival time, such as five o\u2019clock, use \u2018at\u2019.\u201d\u201cI know this too! I wasn\u2019t paying attention!\u201d Zhao Yanzi quibbled.\u201cAnd the fourth question\u2026\u201d\u201cSixth question\u2026\u201d\u201cSeventh question, eighth question\u2026\u201dHao Ren explained the questions one by one, but Zhao Yanzi always had some sort of excuse. If she didn\u2019t read the question wrong, it was Hao Ren\u2019s test paper not being clear enough. Overall, her English wasn\u2019t the problem.In the end, Zhao Kuo couldn\u2019t even just sit in the background anymore. He coughed two times, \u201cUh\u2026 Zi, you need to pay more attention in class.\u201d\u201cThird Uncle! His test is way too difficult!\u201d Zhao Yanzi\u2019s face was red as she spoke to her Third Uncle.Hao Ren was speechless. These questions were the simplest and most basic questions for middle school English. Even first-year middle school student could probably answer half of the questions.Zhao Kuo had a bad temper, but he wasn\u2019t stupid. He looked at Zhao Yanzi and knew that she had a bad foundation in English. Thus, he couldn\u2019t hold his ground anymore. \u201cI think you still need some tutoring.\u201d\u201cThird Uncle\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi whined cutely. Her face was red, and she felt ashamed.\u201cIt\u2019s about time. Your father should be back soon. I\u2019ll head back now so your father won\u2019t nag me,\u201d Zhao Kuo said.\u201cHaha. Third Uncle, you\u2019re scared that my father will lecture you, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Zhao Yanzi suddenly said happily. She felt like she found an alliance.Zhao Kuo felt ashamed as well. \u201cAnyhow\u2026 I\u2019m going back now!\u201d\u201cOkay! I\u2019ll see you off!\u201d Zhao Yanzi jumped up from the chair. She seemed like she was really close with her Third Uncle.\u201cYou can just walk me downstairs\u2026,\u201d Zhao Kuo said as he walked out of Zhao Yanzi\u2019s bedroom.He didn\u2019t even say goodbye to Hao Ren. It was obvious he didn\u2019t accept Hao Ren.Hao Ren stayed alone in Zhao Yanzi\u2019s bedroom. He could hear Zhao Yanzi\u2019s light whispering voice vaguely from downstairs. \u201cHe\u2019s not as bad as you think\u2026\u201dThen, it was followed by a conversation downstairs.\u201cLeaving now? Zhao Guang is almost back home. You don\u2019t want to say hi to him?\u201d\u201cNext time\u2026 next time\u2026 I came to see Zi this time\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re afraid that he\u2019ll say you\u2019re not working on cultivation hard enough, right? Well, drive safe on your way back\u2026\u201dHao Ren wanted to eavesdrop more, but Zhao Yanzi opened the door and came back to her bedroom.\u201cGees, you made me looked bad in front of my Third Uncle!\u201d Once she came in, she complained to Hao Ren right away.Hao Ren looked at her, \u201cBut you actually did them wrong!\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you pretend that I did them right?\u201d She looked at Hao Ren angrily.Hao Ren smiled and didn\u2019t want to argue with her. \u201cThis kiddo\u2019s English isn\u2019t that great, but she is afraid of embarrassment.\u201d He thought.\u201cLooks like your Third Uncle hates me,\u201d Hao Ren changed the topic and said.\u201cIt isn\u2019t just you. He doesn\u2019t like mortals,\u201d Zhao Yanzi answered.Hao Ren didn\u2019t know what to say, but his impression towards this Third Uncle was lowered by another thirty percent.\u201cHe just thinks that you\u2019re not a good match for me. You don\u2019t have to worry. He just says things but won\u2019t actually do anything to you,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said straightforwardly.\u201cI actually still don\u2019t know much about you guys. What exactly was the \u2018Spirit Concentration Scroll\u2019 that Elder Lu gave me last time?\u201d Hao Ren asked her.\u201cThat\u2019s the most basic cultivation technique. It doesn\u2019t actually do anything. It\u2019s simply for purification of the body.\u201d Zhao Yanzi looked at Hao Ren. \u201cYou\u2019ve been cultivating for so many days now, and yet it seems like your body has no reaction.\u201dSeeing her scornful gaze, Hao Ren knew that it was her turn to attack him this time.\u201cDidn\u2019t we have a deal? I tutor you, and you teach me cultivation techniques. If I cultivate poorly, it means that you are a bad teacher,\u201d Hao Ren said immediately.\u201cNonsense! I never taught you before!\u201d Zhao Yanzi glared with her huge eyes.\u201cThen you can start now.\u201d Hao Ren sat down and looked at her.\u201cThe cultivation techniques in the Dragon Clan is divided into, hmm\u2026 these eight levels: Qian, Kun, Xun, Dui, Gen, Zhen, Li, Kan. Hmm\u2026 the highest Qian Level is also called the Heavenly Level. Anyway, that\u2019s about it. You\u2019re not even on the elementary level yet. After your body power up to a certain level, my father or Elder Lu will pass you the real cultivation technique. And when you cultivate till Kan Level, you will be officially a cultivator.\u201dListening to her vague explanation, Hao Ren guessed her cultivation was probably not that remarkable. In fact, Hao Ren was right about that. Zhao Yanzi was totally uninterested in the cultivation techniques and only cultivated here and there. Yet, she thought highly of herself and was anxious about proving herself. That was why she made a mistake and fell in Hao Ren\u2019s arms from the sky. Wasn\u2019t it kind of a punishment that her parents forced her to marry Hao Ren?\u201cAre there any dangers for me to learn your cultivation techniques?\u201d Hao Ren was concerned about this. At this point, he had recovered from the hesitation he experienced a few days ago and accepted the current situation.\u201cOf course there are dangers! You could break your arms or legs if the injuries are light. You could even lose your life on the spot!\u201d Zhao Yanzi said seriously.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHao Ren got distracted right away, \u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing now, isn\u2019t it? You can be my replacement, and it\u2019ll be a lot easier for me.\u201d She giggled and tried to irritate Hao Ren intentionally.\u201cThis is what she had intended to do\u2026 However, even though there are dangers with cultivation, she probably made them up. She is probably comforting herself knowing that she can get away from the dullness of cultivation\u2026\u201d He thought.\u201cSure, I can be your replacement. You are marrying me anyway.\u201d Hao Ren took out his thumbs and touched them together, \u201cAt the time\u2026\u201d\u201cScrew you!\u201d Zhao Yanzi\u2019s face darkened. Her white teeth bit her red lips, and she punched towards Hao Ren\u2019s face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Unexpectedly, Zhao Yanzi had another strike waiting for him. Her other fist aimed at Hao Ren\u2019s stomach and hit on it firmly.She pulled her arm back and looked at Hao Ren fiercely.Knock knock knock\u2026 The sound of knocking emerged. Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi turned back and looked at the door. Zhao Guang pushed open the door and entered.\u201cHow\u2019s the tutoring going?\u201d He walked over and asked.\u201cAh, it\u2019s pretty good,\u201d Hao Ren rubbed his stomach and replied.Zhao Yanzi\u2019s face turned red and she didn\u2019t dare to talk.\u201cZi\u2019s English is very poor. We wanted to find her a tutor, but she wouldn\u2019t agree. That\u2019s why we had to ask you to help her study,\u201d Zhao Guang said to Hao Ren.\u201cYeah, she\u2019s working pretty hard,\u201d Hao Ren said.Zhao Yanzi glanced at Hao Ren; she didn\u2019t think he would say something nice about her.\u201cThis little girl is too playful. She\u2019s actually smart, but she just doesn\u2019t work hard,\u201d Zhao Guang frankly exposed Hao Ren\u2019s lie.\u201cDaddy\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi was ashamed again. She couldn\u2019t help but call out.Zhao Guang ignored Zhao Yanzi and looked at Hao Ren. \u201cHow\u2019s the cultivation of the Spirit Concentration Scroll from Elder Lu?\u201d\u201cNothing seems to be happening,\u201d Hao Ren replied.\u201cTake your time,\u201d he waved at Hao Ren, \u201ccome with me.\u201dHe took Hao Ren to some small hidden stairs and walked up into the attic on the top floor. Zhao Yanzi was curious and followed them.\u201cThis is Zhao Yanzi\u2019s mother\u2019s studio at home, but she normally doesn\u2019t use it at night. After you finish tutoring Zi, you can come here to cultivate,\u201d Zhao Guang said.Hao Ren looked around. This studio was smaller than ten square meters, but it was decorated elegantly and serenely; it didn\u2019t feel small at all.The slanted triangular bookcase maximized the space well. On top of the bookcase, there were all kinds of professional books about design, and most of them were in foreign languages.On the other side of the room, there was a flat table with different types of drawing equipment on top for drafting. The chair was as green as spring grass, and it added an artistic atmosphere to the tiny attic.Through the small window, one could view the backyard that was filled with vivid greens and looked very pleasing.\u201cDaddy, you guys like him more. I normally can\u2019t even enter this studio. Why can he cultivate in here?\u201d Zhao Yanzi said sourly.\u201cHow about you do your homework here and he gets to cultivate in your bedroom?\u201d Zhao Guang asked her.\u201cNo way!\u201d Zhao Yanzi shooked her head crazily like a rattle drum.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Go do your homework now!\u201d Zhao Guang kicked her out.Zhao Yanzi left unwillingly.Zhao Guang looked at Hao Ren. \u201cThere are actually three levels in the Spirit Concentration Scroll. The first level is to communicate with heaven and earth, feel the energy in nature, and purify your body at the same time. The second level is to guide the energy into your body. This process is very slow, but it really helps strengthen your body. The third level is to release the energy around your body. You can only cultivate other more formal cultivation techniques after passing the third level.\u201dHao Ren looked at Zhao Guang as he listened and remembered his words. He finally understood that Zhao Guang wanted to instruct him on cultivation himself.\u201cThis first level, communicating with heaven and earth, also has some techniques to it\u2026\u201d Zhao Guang faced Hao Ren and explained thoroughly.If those elders saw that the \u201cDragon King\u201d was explaining these basic terms to Hao Ren, they would find this incredibly shocking. However, Hao Ren was utterly oblivious to Zhao Guang\u2019s identity. He was touched because he thought Zhao Guang took some time out of his busy schedule to explain these terms to him.Zhao Guang\u2019s coaching was easy to understand, and Hao Ren learned a lot from him. Some things that he couldn\u2019t comprehend before were all solved. Sure enough, these kinds of things would be difficult for him to figure out on his own.Hao Ren finally understood that Zhao Yanzi would encounter a considerable amount of danger after three years. And within these three years, he also had to undertake the same amount of danger.Swallowing the Internal Core was a dangerous act. If he didn\u2019t cultivate the Dragon Clan\u2019s cultivation technique to mediate and suppress the energy of the Internal Core, his body would have exploded sooner or later due to the increasing power of the Dragon Core.According to Zhao Guang\u2019s statement, the Dragon Core innately contained the instinct of absorbing the Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Energy. Therefore, it was also a supreme treasure of the world. The Dragon Clan\u2019s body was innately born with a Dragon Core and certainly became a special and powerful clan because of it.Seconds and minutes passed by. Soon enough, it was nine thirty already.\u201cUncle, I should go back now. Our dorm\u2019s curfew is ten o\u2019clock,\u201d Hao Ren noticed the clock ticking and said hastily.\u201cAlright. I still have half of the content left to explain, but we can talk about it tomorrow.\u201d Zhao Guang led Hao Ren out of the studio.\u201cUm, I\u2019ll start heading back now,\u201d Hao Ren tried to say it in the most courteous way possible. Frankly, Hao Ren was a bit touched by Zhao Guang\u2019s act of instructing him for so long, especially after Zhao Guang had worked overtime today.\u201cI\u2019ll drive you back,\u201d Zhao Guang said in an undisputable tone.Hao Ren wanted to refuse at first, but he nodded because he thought Zhao Guang wanted to say something to him. Zhao Hongyu and he were in a son-in-law and mother-in-law relationship and they got along better. Yet, Zhao Guang and he were in a son-in-law and father-in-law relationship. There would be many things to talk about, right?Zhao Guang brought Hao Ren outside before he went to get the car from the garage. It was a low-key black Chevrolet.Hao Ren got in the car silently. As the car engine started, he waited for Zhao Guang to speak.However, Zhao Guang drove the car steadily and didn\u2019t say anything. Hao Ren had many questions, but he didn\u2019t dare to ask when he saw Zhao Guang\u2019s cold face.Zhao Guang drove Hao Ren to the entrance of the dorm right around quarter to ten. Seeing Zhao Guang being so familiar with the campus\u2019 roads, Hao Ren suddenly remembered that Mingri Group was the biggest investor of East Ocean University. Didn\u2019t they donate and help the school to build the stadium, library, and the newly built Media Academy Building?\u201cCome again at the same time tomorrow and tutor Zi after dinner,\u201d Zhao Guang said after he parked at the entrance of the dorm.\u201cOkay, thank you uncle,\u201d Hao Ren said as he got out from the car.Zhao Guang nodded and drove away.From the beginning until the end, this pair of son-in-law and father-in-law only had two sentences of conversation.Hao Ren walked into the dorm. As he returned to the third floor, Zhao Jiayi and others surrounded him, \u201cLittle guy! Now you get car service for round trips? Are you dating a rich woman?\u201d\u201cI just finished tutoring. Her dad drove me back,\u201d Hao Ren said honestly.\u201cWhy don\u2019t I ever meet a rich young girl? Not only pretty but also wealthy\u2026\u201d Zhou Liren yelled in regret.\u201cIf I tell them that I am not only tutoring a rich young girl but also have a fianc\u00e9e, I don\u2019t know how surprised they will be\u2026\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.Hao Ren climbed up to his upper berth to read after getting rid of those guys.\u201cHao Ren has had so many peach blossom* fortunes lately. First, he is tutoring a young and pretty girl, then Su Han called him to her office, and even Class President Xie Yujia has been paying close attention to Hao Ren lately\u2026\u201dSeeing Hao Ren being so ignorant, Zhao Jiayin, Zhou Liren, and Cao Ronghua started discussing the recent events as if they never noticed that Hao Ren had this kind of charm.Hao Ren held a book in his hands and pretended to be reading, but he was, in fact, trying to adjust his state of mind. He followed Zhao Guang\u2019s instruction and let the weak energy flow from Baihui Acupoint to Shenting Acupoint. Then passing through the Temple, Ermen Acupoint, Qingming Acupoint, Philtrum Acupoint, Yamen Acupoint, Fengchi Acupoint, Renying Acupoint, Danzhong Acupoint, Juque Acupoint, Qihai Acupoint, Zhangmen Acupoint, it, at last, went through the Yongquan Acupoint at the bottom of his feet and back to the center of the body.The Internal Core inside Hao Ren\u2019s Dantian (Lower abdomen region. It is where the energy was stored in Chinese Wuxia Novels.) slightly vibrated as this type of circulation flowed through him.A \u201cbop\u201d sounded, and Hao Ren felt as if someone knocked on his forehead. His body from top to bottom seemed to have opened up.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNext, Hao Ren felt the powerful Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Energy pour into his body. It froze for a bit and distributing throughout the hundreds of acupoints within his body.His whole body suddenly became light. The Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Energy that was originally difficult to sense was actually filling his body. As if his body became a transparent sieve, he couldn\u2019t keep the energy but was also not an obstacle to it.The feeling of clarity was way more refreshing than swallowing one hundred peppermints.Hao Ren tried to enjoy this refreshing experience. He didn\u2019t expect the breakthrough of the Spirit Concentration Scroll\u2019s first level would be this easy.* Peach blossom is a common phrase in Chinese descirbing that fact that a guy/girl is popular and has many encounters with the opposite sex.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You do look especially refreshed today.\u201d On the way to the class the next day, Cao Ronghua commented while studying Hao Ren.\u201cGoing out with a rich girl gave him a different aura.\u201d Rubbing his chin, Zhou Liren told Zhao Jiayi and others while gazing at Hao Ren.\u201cHe has a light elegance in every movement.\u201d Zhao Jiayi joked.They had been teasing him, but Hao Ren did feel his aura had changed ever since he made the breakthrough last night.It seemed he had merged with nature. Although he couldn\u2019t absorb the essence of nature yet, he had a faint feeling that he himself was the nature.He had this feeling after he had just reached the first level of the basic cultivation technique, but he was not a true cultivator yet. No wonder Zhao Yanzi\u2019s Third Uncle regarded mortals with disdain. Hao Ren reflected while he savored the changes in his body.The four of them were on their way to class when they met some of the girls from their class who had just come out of the cafeteria after breakfast. Glancing at Hao Ren, Xie Yujia was about to pass them to take a front seat in the classroom. Struck by a feeling of strangeness, she looked back at Hao Ren again.\u201cWeird. He is wearing the same clothes as yesterday. How come I find his presence different\u2026\u201d Xie Yujia was a little baffled, thinking it a result of her imagination. Shaking her head, she swung her leg over her bicycle and rode toward the Academic Building.\u201cXie Yujia looked at you twice. Have you two been seeing each other?\u201d Zhou Liren asked Hao Ren with a wink.Hao Ren snorted, \u201cHow is that possible\u2026\u201dIn his heart, Xue Yujia was not only the Class President but the most popular girl in the class as well. She was too out of reach for him.Besides, he was an engaged man now.They strolled carelessly into the Academic Building just when the class began. Taking a window seat with fresher air, Hao Ren dug out his study materials and began to prepare for his tutoring session.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer my message yesterday?\u201d In the middle of class, Hao Ren received a text message from Xue Yujia.Surprised, he looked up and met Xue Yujia\u2019s gaze. He wondered why the diligently note-taking Class President would send him a message during the class\u2026Hurriedly, he looked down and answered her message, \u201cYou mean about the long-distance run? I got it.\u201d\u201cYou are the only participant in our class, and only six have been selected in our whole major to enter the games. I hope you won\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d She sent another text message.All of a sudden, Hao Ren felt layers of pressure. The biannual Athletic Games in East Ocean University was a competition held among all the students, regardless of age. The most athletic students selected from the tens of thousands of students in the university would compete with one another. It was a big show.\u201cGot it,\u201d Hao Ren answered the text message. He had been a renowned long-distance runner in high school, but he had never entered any provincial level competitions and didn\u2019t gain points for it during his university entrance examination.Xue Yujia had high hopes for him, but he was not so confident with himself. Although he was fast, he had spent almost all his time playing video games after he entered university. It had been a long time since the last time he had put any real efforts into practice.Thinking that was the end of the text conversation, he was surprised when Xue Yujia sent him another, saying, \u201cDid you get a haircut yesterday? How come I feel like you look different today?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Hao Ren answered the text message.Then Xie Yujia stopped messaging him. Hao Ren wondered if he had sounded too aloof. But soon, he was immersed in middle school English practice questions.In the evening, Hao Ren again took the bus to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s home. No longer a stranger, Hao Ren was not as reserved as last time. However, he still remained silent on topics about their family.After dinner, Zhao Hongyu declined Hao Ren\u2019s offer to clean the table for her and asked him to tutor Zhao Yanzi. Reluctantly, Zhao Yanzi followed Hao Ren up to the second floor.After a day\u2019s thought, Hao Ren had decided to tutor Zhao Yanzi according to the different knowledge points. Today\u2019s quiz focused on the most common topic in the middle school English course, the tenses.Time ticked on, and Zhao Yanzi racked her brains and finally finished the quiz.\u201cUncle, are you sure you are really good at it?\u201d With her chin propped up in her palm, she spun a ball-point pen with the other hand and watched Hao Ren mark her paper earnestly.She had changed out of her school uniform into a short T-shirt with a kitten pattern and a red plaid skirt. Like a candy, the loose combination oozed the sweetness of a teenage girl.Slouching on the chair with her legs curled beneath her, she was oblivious that her posture exposed a strip of flat belly to Hao Ren.\u201cIf you learn earnestly with me, it won\u2019t be too difficult for you to be one of the top three in your class.\u201d Hao Ren scrawled a big red score of 30 on the paper before returning it to her.Ignoring her pouting lips of disapproval, Hao Ren pointed at the first question and began to explain, \u201cSince it uses \u2018yesterday\u2019 in the first part of the sentence, you must use past tense with the verb. And the past tense of \u2018say\u2019 is \u2018said\u2019, not \u2018sayed\u2019\u2026 Hey, listen up and note this down\u2026\u201dSeeing Hao Ren\u2019s earnest face, Zhao Yanzi looked resentful. Still, she had to listen to him, and she began making notes on her notebook.Hao Ren had seen the books in Zhao Hongyu\u2019s studio and knew her English was excellent. He wondered how her daughter was so lousy in English.At the end of the one-hour tutoring session, the upper end of Zhao Yanzi\u2019s ball-point pen was almost chewed off, showing how much she resented Hao Ren.\u201cRen, follow me upstairs.\u201d Zhao Guang showed up by the door on time.\u201cOk.\u201d Putting down the papers, Hao Ren followed Zhao Guang up the small stairs into the studio.\u201cIt seems that you have broken through level one?\u201d Zhao Guang asked when they were inside the studio.\u201cIt seems so. I feel that my body has been unlocked.\u201d\u201cWell, good job. However, the first level is quite simple. Today I will teach you the next part.\u201d Zhao Guang looked calm without any signs of surprise or joy.Hao Ren sat down and listened to him patiently, wondering what realm Zhao Guang had reached. Whatever realm Zhao Guang was in, it couldn\u2019t be low.Hao Ren had never dreamed of flying in the sky, entering the earth, shattering the mountains, and tumbling the oceans. Saving his own life was his purpose. And if he achieved some accomplishments in his cultivation, he would be more confident in helping Zhao Yanzi survive the crisis three years later.Of course, he knew the family of Zhao Yanzi was trying their best to help him, though strictly speaking, Zhao Yanzi had caused all this trouble. However, they would rather place their own daughter at risk than sacrificing innocent Hao Ren. That alone showed more wisdom and righteousness than most parents could ever have.Very soon, it was nine-thirty, and Zhao Guang had explained every point of the Spirit Concentration Scroll in detail.\u201cYou can come back at the same time tomorrow. Then you can cultivate by yourself and ask me whenever you have any questions,\u201d glancing up at the clock, Zhao Guang instructed.Hao Ren nodded. Walking out of the studio to the second floor, he entered Zhao Yanzi\u2019s room and found her working hard on her homework. Not wanting to interrupt her, he gathered his tutoring materials and quietly left the room.\u201cI\u2019ll drive you back,\u201d Zhao Guang appeared at the door and offered.\u201cThank you,\u201d Hao Ren accepted.On the way back to school, Zhao Guang asked suddenly, \u201cCan you drive?\u201d\u201cI got my license last summer, but I\u2019m still a beginner,\u201d Hao Ren answered.\u201cHow about I buy you a car so you can come and go with ease. Which do you like, Chevrolet or Volkswagen?\u201d Zhao Guang asked casually as if he was talking about a 10-yuan toy instead of a 100,000-yuan car.\u201cErr, it\u2019s not necessary. I can take a taxi back in the future,\u201d Hao Ren said in a hurry.Zhao Guang didn\u2019t pursue the topic. He drove Hao Ren to the dorm building in silence.\u201cOh, please tell Zi that I have to participate in the Athletic Games next week and I\u2019ll have to practice. I\u2019ll resume the tutoring sessions next Tuesday.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOk.\u201d Zhao Guang restarted the car with a steady hand and disappeared around the corner.\u201cA calm father-in-law, a gentle mother-in-law, a willful young fianc\u00e9e, what more will come my way?\u201d Inhaling deeply, Hao Ren walked into the dorm building.When he got into his dorm room, his three dormmates were still out. Apparently, they were at an internet caf\u00e9 playing games. Opening his backpack, Hao Ren was in the process of reorganizing the tutoring materials and saw that a big pig head had been drawn on the title page of his favorite middle school English test bank.A coarse nose, bulging eyes, droopy ears and thick lips\u2026 On the side were the words: Self-important Uncle.Gazing at the caricature of the pig head that was drawn to look ugly but looked a bit like him, Hao Ren chuckled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22: The Most Handsome Guy in East Ocean University Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedIn the following two days, Hao Ren didn\u2019t tutor Zhao Yanzi but took the time at night to practice long-distance running on the sports field. He didn\u2019t expect to win the first place, but he didn\u2019t want to end up last either.He believed that his long-distance skills were still there and he just needed to regain his form.With only 4-5 lamps illuminating the 400m synthetic racetrack surrounding the outside of the soccer field, the whole sports field looked quiet and lonely.Regulating his breathing and steps, Hao Ren practiced alone. He had purposely chosen to run here at nine o\u2019clock at night.In one hour, the entrance of the dorm buildings would be locked up. The basketball and soccer players had all gone back, and thus he would have no distractions while practicing.Today in Weak Optical Signal Processing class, the beauty Su Han was wearing a studded shirt, denim shorts, and Dr. Marten Boots. She looked so gorgeous that the guys yelled and cheered.However, she didn\u2019t spare a glance at Hao Ren as if she didn\u2019t summon him to her office last week.She remained aloof during the whole class until she left. Although Hao Ren knew they crossed paths in another world, they had returned to the normal world and were strangers. After all, a super beautiful female teacher would never show any special treatment to a very ordinary student.He believed that Su Han must have gone to Lu Qing to talk about him.While he ran, his mind wandered through events that happened today. Suddenly, a basketball rolled toward his feet.Hao Ren stopped running and picked up the basketball before looking toward the place where the ball had come from. Not far from him, a handsome guy wearing a white shirt sat on the bleacher. With a well-proportioned and robust body, the guy had dashing eyebrows slanting upwards and outwards.Hao Ren recognized him.Known as the Most Handsome Guy in East Ocean University, Huang Xujie was the president of the university\u2019s Rock Climbing Club and the celebrity student who was even pursued by the most popular girl in the school, Lin Li.Lifting the basketball with one hand while pointing at it with the other, Hao Ren used this gesture to ask him if the ball was his.Huang Xujie nodded and curled his finger.Hao Ren took a step forward before throwing the basketball to him with one hand.The basketball covered the 20-plus meters between them before it fell toward Huang Xujie.Huang Xujie reached one hand out and caught the ball.With the ball gone, Hao Ren swung his arms and prepared to start jogging again.\u201cSophomore!\u201d Huang Xujie suddenly said.\u201cUh?\u201d Hao Ren looked at him, baffled.\u201cI heard that you too had entered the 1500-meter race?\u201d He asked abruptly.Hao Ren looked at him cautiously, feeling a trace of hostility from him.\u201cI heard that you\u2019ve been in the limelight quite a lot recently.\u201d Spinning the ball with his finger, Huang Xujie asked, \u201cYou live in grand style, don\u2019t you? And you have been picked up from campus by a limo, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cDid I steal your show?\u201d Hao Ren asked directly.Snap! Huang Xujie stopped spinning the basketball abruptly, \u201cYeah. I\u2019m pissed off by your blatant shows.\u201dThough low-key, Hao Ren was never afraid of confrontation. Facing Huang Xujie on the racetrack, he asked, \u201cSo as a senior, you want to teach me a lesson, don\u2019t you?\u201dHuang Xujie didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he asked, \u201cThey say Su Han asked you to her office all alone. What\u2019s between you and her?\u201dFrom the trace of hostility, Hao Ren sensed an intense jealousy.\u201cI have nothing to tell you!\u201d Hao Ren went back to jogging.Huang Xujie froze for a moment, surprised that an ordinary sophomore would be so arrogant. His hand tightened on the basketball while he gazed at the back of Hao Ren.When Hao Ren returned after another lap, Huang Xujie was gone.He knew he had attracted a lot of attention in the past couple of weeks, and the several limo pick-ups on campus made him look like a big show-off.More importantly, Su Han\u2019s invitation to her office made the self-important handsome guys red-eyed with jealousy. Maybe they thought Hao Ren\u2019s previous behavior had been his efforts in attracting Su Han\u2019s attention and the famous students were furious that his clumsy efforts had paid off and had successfully drawn Su Han\u2019s interest to him.After all, their blatant behavior only won them screams of the pretty girls while the extreme beautiful Su Han didn\u2019t show a trace of interest.Indeed, Su Han\u2019s beauty exceeded people\u2019s imaginations, and it was natural that the male students were crazy for her. If Hao Ren had not known her real identity, he would have been silently amazed by her beauty, too.It was three quarters past nine when Hao Ren jogged back to his dorm. Zhao Jiayi and his other two roommates were engaged in a fierce card game with Gu Jiadong from the dorm room opposite to theirs.Hao Ren took his washbasin and towel to take a cold shower. He didn\u2019t tell anyone about Huang Xujie\u2019s provocation.Friday passed quickly with only half a day of classes. With most of the students coming from local areas, East Ocean University became unusually quiet every Friday afternoon.Zhao Jiayi and the others didn\u2019t want to go home this weekend, and they dragged Hao Ren and several others from the next-door dorm room to a nearby KTV*. After singing themselves to exhaustion, they went to a hot pot buffet. They stuffed themselves with beer and meat before returning to the dorm room for a game of cards.The days were decadent and carefree.It comforted Hao Ren that he had such a group of brothers with him no matter what had happened. They did everything together: going to classes, skipping classes, drinking, and feasting.Zhao Yanzi\u2019s Third Uncle would never appreciate this kind of happiness enjoyed by mortals.At nine o\u2019clock, Hao Ren put down the cards in his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the sports field to practice running.\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t go. It\u2019s no use practicing with only a few days left before the race. Play cards with us\u2026\u201d Zhao Jiayi tried to stop him.\u201cI can regain some of my form with practice. Gu Jiadong, come over and play cards!\u201d Hao Ren stuffed his cards into Gu Jiadong\u2019s hands, \u201cIt\u2019s on me if you lose, and you get all the benefit if you win.\u201dGrinning at the promise, Gu Jiadong took his cards and sat down immediately.Hao Ren changed into his running shoes and jogged to the sports field.The campus was unusually quiet on Friday nights. When he was passing by the office building, Hao Ren looked up involuntarily as a weird thought occurred to him, \u201cSu Han should be home now. Where does she live?\u201dZhao Hongyu said Su Han had some special connection with East Ocean Dragon Clan, and Hao Ren wondered what it was\u2026Maybe that was why she took a teaching position at Lu Qing\u2019s university\u2026While he ran, Hao Ren wondered about her. He met two girls who were taking a walk. When they saw his lingering glance, they snorted in disdain. Almost every male in the university more or less had some feelings for Su Han, and the male students were usually caught staring at Su Han\u2019s office in the hope of finding a glimpse of the unrivaled beauty.It was frustrating to them that Su Han didn\u2019t show her face except when she was walking to and from her class. No one had seen her even at the cafeteria. All of these deepened the feeling that she was like a fairy who didn\u2019t consume food of the mortal world.Hao Ren came to the sports field and began to run the ten laps according to his plan. He found his stamina recovered faster than before, and he wondered if it was a result of the breakthrough into the first level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll.The dim lights extended Hao Ren\u2019s shadow while he enjoyed the vast sports field and the loneliness of the night. Circulating the energy according to the Spirit Concentration Scroll and savoring the nature\u2019s essence, he regulated his breathing and steps as he ran at a steady pace.His clothes floated in the air. Hao Ren didn\u2019t realize there was a free and eased aura surrounded him when he ran. Every step was steady and firm while a light breeze swam around him and through his clothes.The Heavenly Dao came from nature. The order of nature had unknowingly influenced Hao Ren, and each of his movements in this peaceful night followed the easiest and logical routes suggested by the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams.After ten laps, he ran another ten laps.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHao Ren was surprised that his strength had not diminished at all. He was practicing long-distance running, but he felt like he was strolling casually without any heaviness detected in his steps.\u201cUh?\u201d After a while, he had a sudden feeling that someone was watching him from a corner.He looked towards that direction.He saw Xie Yujia in a long chiffon floral dress sitting quietly on a step a dozen meters away. She was watching him with a smile.* KTV: A place for KaraokesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After a moment of hesitation, he jogged over, \u201cWhat\u2026what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to watch you run.\u201d Xie Yujia tilted her head and smiled.Her raven black hair covering her shiny forehead and her long pony-tail trailing over her back gave her a fresh look.The night breeze brushed over her and sent a wisp of fragrance to Hao Ren. Soft and white skin, flesh and clean hair, and her fluttering dress showed that she had just taken a shower.Hao Ren had always thought Xue Yujia was pretty, and so did all his male classmates. Since she rarely showed her face during university activities, the most popular girl in the class had become her class\u2019 or her major\u2019s \u201cprivate property\u201d. She wasn\u2019t promoted as someone who rivaled with Ling Li as the most popular girl at the university.In fact, Hao Ren thought Xie Yujia was prettier than Lin Li, and he found Xie Yujia\u2019s fresh and elegant temperament more appealing.\u201cHow did you know I was practicing here?\u201d Hao Ren continued with his questions.He had not sweated much while running, but he was now suddenly sweating all over when facing Xie Yujia.\u201cI am the Class President, and I know everything.\u201d Still smiling, Xie Yujia looked at Hao Ren confidently. \u201cYou have been practicing running here at nine every night. Am I right?\u201dHao Ren knew information spread really fast among the girls, but he had never expected Xie Yujia would notice him, an ordinary and unimportant classmate. Didn\u2019t the girls always talk about the doings of handsome guys?\u201cYou look dashing when you run,\u201d Xie Yujia continued.Embarrassed, Hao Ren lowered his head. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to receive a compliment from the beautiful Class President,\u201d he said.Again, Xie Yujia smiled sweetly, \u201cI\u2019m the Class President, and it\u2019s my duty to encourage you for the sake of our class\u2019 honor.\u201d\u201cSo you didn\u2019t mean it; it was just an encouragement.\u201d Hao Ren gave her a disappointed look.\u201cI meant it; it is also an encouragement. You do look attractive when you run,\u201d seeing Hao Ren\u2019s disappointment, Xie Yujia immediately added.The moment she said that, she seemed to have found something wrong with her words. She lowered her head and smiled. When she lifted her head again, she had regained her confidence as the Class President. \u201cIn fact, as long as you give it all, I will still be pleased even if you end up in the last place.\u201d\u201cThanks a lot for the encouragement!\u201d Hao Ren dug out his mobile phone from his pocket, \u201cIt\u2019s now nine forty. The dorms will be lock up if we don\u2019t hurry back.\u201d\u201cToday is Friday, and they won\u2019t close until twelve,\u201d Xie Yujia reminded him.\u201cOh, I almost forgot without your reminder.\u201d Hao Ren thought for a moment, \u201cBut it\u2019s still late, and I have finished my practice. How about I walk you back?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you hungry?\u201d Xie Yujia asked him abruptly.Hao Ren stared blankly at her for a moment. \u201cI have instant noodles in my dorm\u2026\u201dSeeing the silly expression on Hao Ren\u2019s face, Xie Yujia smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll treat you to a late-night snack as a reward for your hard practice for the class\u2019 honor.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Hao Ren nodded. He had not expected that Xie Yujia would invite him to a late-night snack. It had been a big surprise for him already when Xie Yujia came to watch him practice so late at night.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Hao Ren asked Xie Yujia to stay where she was before dashing across the field and picking up the jacket he had left on the grass. Then he ran back to her side.Standing on the stairs in her elegant long dress as she was silhouetted against the night and the lamplights, Xie Yujia looked even more fresh and alluring.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Hao Ren called Xie Yujia.\u201cOk.\u201d Xie Yujia nodded and followed Hao Ren out of the fenced sports field.Whoosh\u2026 While exiting the sports field, a gust of wind swept towards them. Without thinking, Hao Ren immediately draped his jacket over Xie Yujia\u2019s shoulders and then shielded her from the biting wind with his body. He led her out of the cold and drafty place.\u201cHow come I never noticed your gentlemanliness?\u201d Back on the quiet road of the campus, Xie Yujia returned the jacket to Hao Ren and said.\u201cIs it because I have stayed so long with Zhou Liren that I have got some of his ill-manners?\u201d Hao Ren joked.\u201cZhao Jiayi and those guys are sometimes indeed outrageous, but I think you are different.\u201d Xie Yujia told him while they walked.It was close to midnight, and it was quiet with almost no one in sight. The dim lights from the scant street lamps gave the road that was neither too long or too short made it feel a little a dubious and romantic.\u201cNot so different. In fact, I\u2019m no better than them.\u201d Hao Ren said self-mockingly.\u201cI think you are more earnest with things. At least you have begun practicing days before the race.\u201d Xie Yujia couldn\u2019t help but speak up for him.Hao Ren smiled, \u201cI\u2019m a bashful man who is afraid of losing.\u201dXie Yujia remained silent and walked to the back gate of the university shoulder to shoulder with Hao Ren. She walked pensively as if she was savoring Hao Ren\u2019s words or thinking about something else.Hao Ren had never imagined that he could take a walk with the most popular girl in the class shoulder to shoulder on the campus on such a quiet night. Anyone that saw them would regard them as a couple.\u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d At the back gate, Xie Yujia asked Hao Ren abruptly.\u201cErr\u2026spicy Hot Pot?\u201d Hao Ren asked tentatively.Spicy Hot Pot was the cheapest meal he could think of. After all, he was uncomfortable having a girl treat him to a meal.\u201cOk!\u201d Xie Yujia agreed promptly.It was Friday night, and the dorm buildings wouldn\u2019t be locked up until midnight. There were actually many students out for late-night meals. Hao Ren regretted his decision of eating Spicy Hot Pot, fearing that the guys who were playing cards in his dorm room might also come out for a late-night snack. He would be doomed if they saw him and spread the gossip.Xie Yujia didn\u2019t seem to share his concern when she cheerfully walked to one of the Spicy Hot Pot stands. She turned to ask Hao Ren, \u201cWhat do you want to eat? Pick whatever you want!\u201dSeeing her brisk manner, Hao Ren put down his concern and embarrassment. He picked up some skewers of meat and vegetables and placed them in a basket before handing it to her.\u201cYou\u2019ve run for a long time and must be starving. Take some more!\u201d Without consulting him, Xie Yujia put several more skewers of meatballs in Hao Ren\u2019s basket.Then she picked some for herself and brought both baskets to the stand owner for paymentThey sat at a table in the open air and waited impatiently for the delicious-smelling skewers to be picked up from the pot.\u201cGuys, don\u2019t show up now\u2026\u201d While they were waiting, Hao Ren prayed silently.\u201cWhy do you look so nervous?\u201d Xie Yujia looked at Hao Ren and questioned.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d Hao Ren looked at the pretty Class President, \u201cThis is my first time eating a late-night snack with you, the Class President. Of course, I\u2019m a little nervous.\u201d\u201cIs it your first time eating a late-night snack with a girl?\u201d Gazing at Hao Ren with her bright eyes, Xie Yujia asked again.\u201cWho told\u2026 When I was in the high school, I had a girlfriend\u2026\u201d Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to admit the shameful truth.Seeing Hao Ren\u2019s stiff expression, Xie Yujia giggled. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201dHao Ren curled his lips in embarrassment and decided to turn the question on her. \u201cClass President, you are so pretty. You must have had boyfriends before.\u201dXie Yujia shook her head, and her ponytail swayed with her movement. A bright black luster shone on her hair under the illumination of the streetlights.\u201cThen we are equal,\u201d Hao Ren said without thinking.Xie Yujia smiled without commenting. Suddenly it occurred to Hao Ren that they were not at all equal. Xie Yujia was so pretty, and she must have had a lot of guys pursuing her. She had just ignored them since her focus was on studying. Him, on the other hand, was just an ordinary guy who wasn\u2019t liked by any girl.\u201cTwo Spicy Hot Pot dishes!\u201d The stand owner\u2019s wife brought the Spicy Hot Pot dishes to them. She seemed to have noticed the fresh beauty, Xie Yujia, and couldn\u2019t help glancing at her several times.Not only the stand owner\u2019s wife but the male students nearby as well were sneakily looking at her.A beauty, even a low-profile one, couldn\u2019t escape the attention of males.\u201cEat!\u201d Xie Yujia looked at the Spicy Hot Pot dishes and casually handed a pair of chopsticks to Hao Ren.To the male students who didn\u2019t know them, this casual gesture was an act of intimacy which attracted their jealous glances.\u201cThis guy looks so ordinary, and neither does he seem rich. How come he caught the beauty\u2019s eye?\u201d The male students speculated silently while they ate their food and sneaked glances at Xie Yujia.\u201cClass President, why didn\u2019t you go home this weekend?\u201d Hao Ren asked her while he opened the package of chopsticks. That was for one-time use.\u201cBecause I wanted to watch you run,\u201d Xie Yujia answered without thinking. She snickered at the surprised look on Hao Ren\u2019s face, \u201cOk. I stayed to help the Student Council to organize some stuff.\u201d\u201cSo inviting me to the meal was not in your original plan?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cLet me think\u2026\u201d Xie Yujia lowered her head to take a bite of a meatball. \u201cErr, I planned only to watch you practice, but later I decided to reward you with a meal when I saw you practicing so hard.\u201dHao Ren didn\u2019t care if she was telling the truth or not since he was quite moved that Xie Yujia would come over and watch him practice so late at night.\u201cThe other day when Su Han asked you to go to her office, what on earth happened?\u201d Xie Yujia asked abruptly.\u201cShe saw me talking in class and took me to her office to give me a lecture,\u201d Hao Ren answered.Xie Yujia\u2019s eyes told him that she didn\u2019t buy it, but she didn\u2019t question him on that. Instead, she asked another question, \u201cThen what happened with that the little beauty who came to see you?\u201d\u201cShe is one of the girls I\u2019m tutoring. She just came here to mess with me,\u201d Hao Ren answered immediately since he had prepared these answers.He looked at Xie Yujia, \u201cClass President, you seem quite interested in me recently.\u201d\u201cThe things happening to you recently made it impossible for me not to notice them,\u201d Xie Yujjia retorted.With a grin, Hao Ren lowered his head and began to suck the noodles into his mouth with loud noises. The male students who had been sneaking glances at them were furious at his lousy table manners. They thought he was blatantly showing-off that he could eat a late-night meal with a beauty even with such rudeness.In fact, Hao Ren was uneasy. He had been Xie Yujia\u2019s classmate for more than one year, and their paths had not crossed frequently. At the university, classes were loosely organized. Since several classes took the same courses while students from different majors took the same public courses, it was rare for them to have interactions. Besides, only a few girls were in Hao Ren\u2019s major, and they always hung out together. In short, Hao Ren had little chance to interact with Xie Yujia.\u201cWhat Cao Ronghua and others told me last time was just a joke, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Xie Yujia asked.\u201cEr?\u201d Hao Ren raised his head, and his face had turned red due to the Spicy Hot Pot he had eaten.\u201cThey came over and told me that you liked me.\u201d Xie Yujia bit her lip before forcing the words out.Her big eyes with long eyelashes looked exceptionally beautiful even in the shabby late-night meal stand.Hao Ren\u2019s face turned even redder, \u201cNo\u2026 They were just kidding\u2026\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 It\u2019s not important. I felt they liked to joke around.\u201d Xie Yujia smiled brightly, seeming indifferent to the whole incident.\u201cThose seniors didn\u2019t make trouble for you, did they?\u201d After a while, Xie Yujia asked abruptly.\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d Hao Ren was suddenly cautious.\u201cI heard from the Student Council that some troublesome senior male students had been displeased with your behavior in the past couple of weeks. They declared that they would teach you a lesson.\u201d Xie Yujia stared at Hao Ren while she expressed her worry.\u201cWell, it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Indifferently, Hao Ren went back to eating.\u201cI know some of them. Do you want me to explain to them about the misunderstandings?\u201d Xie Yujia asked for Hao Ren\u2019s opinion.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. You don\u2019t have to trouble yourself with it,\u201d Hao Ren declined with a wave of his hand.He didn\u2019t think those guys would cause a lot of troubles for him. More importantly, he didn\u2019t want Xie Yujia, a girl, to help him to solve the problem.\u201cWell, I guess they are just trying to frighten you. You must stay low-key in the future in the university,\u201d Xie Yujia advised him with concern.\u201cBut it\u2019s not my fault,\u201d Hao Ren thought about it but didn\u2019t say it.When they finished their food, it was almost eleven at night. The night\u2019s air got colder. Seeing Xie Yujia\u2019s thin dress, Hao Ren was afraid that she would catch a cold and suggested that they should return to the dorms earlier. Xie Yujia had no objections.Anyway, they were still classmates and couldn\u2019t stroll around hand in hand until midnight like a real couple.Walking through the quiet campus, Hao Ren accompanied Xie Yujia to her dorm building.\u201cDo your best at the Athletic Games!\u201d Standing at the door, Xie Yujia encouraged Hao Ren with a smile.\u201cGot it. Class President, have a good night.\u201d Hao Ren waved at her. For reasons unknown to him, he preferred to call her \u201cClass President\u201d instead of her name.He turned to walk to his own dorm building, and a question occurred to him, \u201cWas it a date?\u201dIf it had not been a date, how come he felt much closer to her?\u201cA beauty like the Class President was just encouraging me to perform better I guess.\u201dHao Ren shook his head to get rid of his wild speculations. Back in his dorm, he took a shower and went to bed.Ding! Ding\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn the early morning of the next day, a Saturday, Hao Ren was woken up by the ringing of his mobile phone.\u201cRen! What\u2019s the heck!\u201d Zhao Jiayi sleeping on the lower berth beneath him was the first to wake up. He threw aside his quilt and dashed to the table before tossing the ringing mobile phone to Hao Ren who was sleeping on the upper berth.An unknown number was on the screen.\u201cWho is it? It\u2019s still early!\u201d Hao Ren answered the phone with a trace of displeasure.\u201cI\u2019m Zhao Guang. Our car is now in front of your dorm building.\u201d A steady voice came from the phone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedThe voice briefly stupified Hao Ren before he quickly put down the phone and rushed to the balcony from his upper berth.He saw the black Chevrolet quietly parked in front of his dorm.He went back into the room without thinking much and threw on some clothes and shoes. Hao Ren then picked up his phone and sprang downstairs.Zhao Guang was in the driver\u2019s seat while Zhao Hongyu was in the passenger seat. Zhao Yanzi was sitting in the back with her pouting little mouth.\u201cWhy\u2026are you here?\u201d Hao Ren asked in surprise.\u201cWe are going on a weekend trip, and we are here to pick you up,\u201d Zhao Guang responded. The tone of his voice was beyond doubt as if Hao Ren was definitely going to join them.Hao Ren wanted to come up with an excuse, \u201cToday I\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have Lu Qing speak to the school if there is something you need to do,\u201d Zhao Guang said.\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Hao Ren struggled for a bit before he finally gave up, \u201cAlright, it\u2019s not a big deal. We don\u2019t need to speak to the vice principal.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Zhao Guang nodded.\u201cGet in the car.\u201d Zhao Hongyu smiled at Hao Ren.Hao Ren opened the door awkwardly and sat in the back beside Zhao Yanzi. That was his only option.\u201cMom! Why are we taking him? You said it was going to be a family trip!\u201d Zhao Yanzi complained.\u201cIsn\u2019t Hao Ren a part of our family?\u201d Zhao Hongyu said softly.Zhao Yanzi didn\u2019t know what to say. She thought about it, and Zhao Guang interrupted just when she was about to argue again, \u201cWe\u2019ll just go back home if you keep complaining. You can go do your homework then.\u201dThat certainly worked at suppressing her temper as she shut her mouth. However, her pouting became even more obvious.\u201cRen, you haven\u2019t had breakfast yet, have you?\u201d Zhao Hongyu turned around and asked gently.\u201cIt\u2019s ok. I\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Hao Ren answered.\u201cOpen up the bag, Zi. Give Ren a piece of bread,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said.Zhao Yanzi held her breath and opened the bag. Still upset, she took out a small bread and threw it at Hao Ren.\u201cThank you!\u201d Hao Ren said to Zhao Hongyu.Zhao Guang kept on driving steadily and stopped talking.Zhao Yanzi lurked in the corner and kept her distance from Hao Ren. It was more of a demonstration of her attitude towards Hao Ren and her parents; it was evident that she was annoyed at him.After leaving the downtown area, they got on a much broader road. The four of them in the car never spoke again.The long drive and similar views outside the window were starting to make people sleepy. Both Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi were dozing off.Hao Ren was sleeping because of the lack of sleep he had since he slept too late last night and woke up too early this morning. As for Zhao Yanzi, it was due to her excitement of the trip today that made it difficult for her to go to sleep last night. The comfortable seats of the car made her want to sleep as well.The two of them both fell towards the middle of the back seat as the car continued along the road\u2026\u201cWe are here!\u201d A crisp voice woke them both up.Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi slowly woke up as they realized that their heads were touching.\u201cGet out!\u201d Zhao Yanzi pushed Hao Ren away with an unpleasant frown. She quickly jumped out of the car.The surrounding view of green mountains and clear waters soon put a happy smile on her face.Hao Ren wiped the drool from his mouth and got out of the car too. He realized that they were already in the mountains.\u201cWhere is this?\u201d He asked.\u201cGreenStone Mountain,\u201d Zhao Hongyu answered.\u201cAh?\u201d Hao Ren was surprised.GreenStone Mountain was a famous tourist attraction outside East Ocean City, but it was over 100 kilometers from downtown. It seemed like they have unnoticeably driven for more than two hours.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the top of the mountain today and stay at the hotel at the foot of the mountain tonight,\u201d Zhao Hongyu continued.\u201cAh?\u201d Hao Ren became even more surprised.He forced himself to come on the trip with Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family thinking that they would return within a day. But to stay the night\u2026? It was\u2026Since it\u2019s over 100 kilometers from the city, even the buses here wouldn\u2019t be going in that direction. People who visited here would usually drive or take the bus provided by travel agencies after all.\u201cLet\u2019s put our belongings down at the hotel first,\u201d Zhao Hongyu suggested.Zhao Guang put away the car key as he nodded. He took the large traveling bag from her and headed towards the nearby hotel.Although Zhao Guang didn\u2019t talk much, Hao Ren could feel the tacit understanding and loving relationship between him and Zhao Hongyu.\u201cHere!\u201d Zhao Yanzi stuffed her backpack into Hao Ren\u2019s arms and skipped behind her dad.Hao Ren felt a little awkward knowing that he had to stay with them for two days. However, there was no way back at the moment. He threw Zhao Yanzi\u2019s backpack onto his back and followed them to the hotel with a shrug.The four-star hotel at the foot of the famous mountain wasn\u2019t cheap at all. One room would cost 1200 yuan a night.Zhao Guang paid for two rooms with his platinum card as if it was nothing.Then they need to coordinate the rooms. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t make me share a room with Zhao Yanzi, would they?\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Zhao Guang patted him on the shoulder after noticing Hao Ren\u2019s hesitation.Hao Ren suddenly realized that he would be sharing a room with Zhao Yanzi\u2019s dad, and Zhao Yanzi would be in the other room with her mom.\u201cWhat was I thinking\u2026\u201d Hao Ren talked to himself as he walked into the room with Zhao Guang.Their rooms were opposite to each other. Hao Ren followed Zhao Guang into the room and found that the rooms were elegantly decorated even though they weren\u2019t too large.He pulled back the curtains, and the beautiful scenery of GreenStone Mountain entered his view. A wave of fresh air breezed across his face; he had never breathed in such fresh air in the city.\u201cPut everything down and freshen up a little before we start the climb,\u201d Zhao Guang said to Hao Ren.\u201cOk,\u201d Hao Ren put Zhao Yanzi\u2019s pink little backpack on a chair and walked into the bathroom. He brushed his teeth as well as rinsed his face. He left in such a rush that he didn\u2019t even have time to do that. It was pretty embarrassing to think about.The three of them were already waiting at the door when Hao Ren stepped out of the bathroom.\u201cSo slow!\u201d Zhao Yanzi mumbled.Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to quarrel with her in front of her parents. He lightly coughed twice and asked Zhao Guang, \u201cTime to go?\u201d\u201cTake my backpack!\u201d Zhao Yanzi cried out.Hao Ren turned around and picked up her little pink backpack.\u201cBe polite, Zi!\u201d Zhao Guang finally couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore and scolded her.Zhao Yanzi gritted her teeth as she felt wronged. She was so thrilled about the family trip, but Hao Ren\u2019s sudden appearance made her uncomfortable.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get on the mountain,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said.\u201cOh, let me give my grandma a call first. I was supposed to go visit her this weekend,\u201d Hao Ren suddenly remembered and took his phone out.He dialed home and told his grandma that he wouldn\u2019t be able to visit her this weekend since he was going out with his \u201cclassmates\u201d. His grandma didn\u2019t blame him. On the other hand, she told him to have fun.Zhao Hongyu felt that Hao Ren was even more filial and understanding through his use of tone and words over the phone.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe air here is really fresh. You should take your grandma here sometime. There is a Farmer Host* at the mountain foot. Some young people in the city would bring their parents here to escape the heat as well as enjoy each others\u2019 company. The elders can play cards, chat, and try out some refreshing dishes. This place is pretty relaxing and popular,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said to Hao Ren as he hung up the phone.\u201cUm,\u201d Hao Ren mumbled. He had never mentioned Zhao Yanzi to his grandma, and he even told her that he was out with \u201cclassmates\u201d just now. How was he supposed to introduce his grandma to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s parents?He didn\u2019t know if grandma would be startled or surprised to see such a disobedient and misbehaving granddaughter-in-law.\u201cWe are a family so don\u2019t be so stiff. Loosen up a little. Let\u2019s start the climb,\u201d Zhao Hongyu smiled at Hao Ren and walked out of the hotel entrance while holding Zhao Guang\u2019s hand.* Farmer Host: it is a type of restaurant/hotel where people would stay with a family of farmers in order to experience the farm life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 25: The Mysterious Daoist Temple Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedZhao Yanzi was completely at ease. She was jumping and leaping, leading everyone else. Today, she was wearing a short skirt that was sewed together with cotton and denim fabrics, displaying her silky, slender calves. Out of her low cut and vest-like sleeveless shirt came two plump arms and a good portion of skin. It was a little alluring. For a girl her age, or for Hao Ren who was relatively conservative, her choice of outfit seemed rather bold.On the other hand, the Roman sandals on her feet craftily balanced out her sexiness with the liveliness of youth. Along with her springing and bouncing, the slippers were flopping like two fluttering butterflies.It was nice to have a mother who was a designer. With such casual mix and match of an outfit, not only did Zhao Yanzi not look awkward, she actually looked like a pretty little catalog model.In comparison, Hao Ren couldn\u2019t be more unfashionable. He was wearing a shirt that hadn\u2019t been washed in three days, a pair of wrinkly jeans, and a pair of dirty running shoes.The only thing about him that could attract any attention was the little pink backpack on his back. However, that was also Zhao Yanzi\u2019s item. Speaking of that, it was indeed strange enough for a guy like him to be wearing a pink backpack.As Zhao Yanzi rushed ahead, Zhao Guang and Zhao Hongyu were walking side by side with Hao Ren. While Zhao Guang\u2019s outfit was business casual, Zhao Hongyu went for a young athletic feel; it was almost impossible to tell that she was already the mother of a middle-schooler.They continued climbing up the flights of stone stairs and finally arrived at the ticket office for the tourist attraction.Zhao Yanzi was already standing right next to the window of the ticket office, impatiently waiting for her parents to go purchase tickets. Her inability to hold herself back reminded Hao Ren of the times when he went sightseeing with his parents in his childhood.Zhao Guang walked over calmly and bought four admissions tickets at once. Hao Ren felt a little uncomfortable that his ticket was paid for. But at a time like this, he did not want to put up a hypocritical fight over anything unnecessary.Through the mountain gates, they continued moving up along the stairs.The sight was undeniably magnificent. Their surrounding was saturated with greenness; as a result, even the air was giving off a hint of coolness. The reappearing stream was meandering downwards along the trail, generating a pleasantly clear and melodious sound by their feet.With her mouth wide open, Zhao Yanzi started taking in exaggeratedly deep breaths of fresh air. Hao Ren couldn\u2019t help but smile at her innocent and childish behavior.It was incredibly relaxing and satisfying for them to be one with nature again after having spent a long time living in the city.Hand-in-hand, Zhao Hongyu and Zhao Guang were taking their time to admire and appreciate the scenery around them. Since Hao Ren did not want to walk beside Zhao Yanzi, he strolled behind them. Similarly, Zhao Yanzi did not want to be stuck with Hao Ren either. Thus, she was like an excited small animal, sprinting and exploring ahead.\u201cZi, slow down!\u201d Zhao Hongyu cautioned,\u201cMom! There is a cave here!\u201d Zhao Yanzi screamed passionately from ahead.Zhao Hongyu let out a chuckle. She turned around and waved at Hao Ren before walking ahead to join Zhao Yanzi. \u201cThis cave was created due to the impact of the underground water. Streams in the mountain have formed secret paths inside the mountain. When they run into fragile and worn-out rocks, they would burst through. What we have seen on our way here are tributaries; the real water streams are all contained on the inside of the mountain\u2026\u201d\u201cHow come there is no water in it then?\u201d Zhao Yanzi asked curiously.\u201cThat is because the size and impact of the water streams also depend on the season. When the water stream is affluent, the water will seep through. Of course, it could also be that the stream had been diverted. In other words, this was formerly an exit that had become blocked off from the inside due to a small-scale landslide,\u201d Zhao Hongyu explained patiently.While nodding her head, Zhao Yanzi\u2019s eyes lit up as if she had just discovered a new continent. She pointed ahead, \u201cLook, there is some writing over there!\u201d\u201c\u2018Earthly Paradise\u2019, this was supposedly inscribed by the famous poet Du Fu of the Tang dynasty. There used to be a Daoist temple here called \u2018Celestial Cloud Temple\u2019\u2026\u201d Zhao Hongyu patiently elaborated as she walked.Blinking her big eyes, Zhao Yanzi was able to keep calm and followed her mother closely, observing and listening.Hao Ren was in awe. He was surprised that Zhao Hongyu was so knowledgeable. Not only was she successful in architectural designs, but she was also very eloquent when it came to astronomy-geology, culture, and humanity.As a result, they advanced quickly as Zhao Hongyu interpreted along the way. Moreover, she was often able to branch off from one point to pass on more information to Zhao Yanzi. Her voice was gentle and pleasant; even Hao Ren was enchanted and had learned a lot from listening to her.After walking for about two hours, they reached the halfway point and decided to go eat at a small restaurant on the mountain.Their tables were planted outside and underneath an awning. While they were devouring the vegetables and rice, they were also able to appreciate the magnificent views of GreenStone Mountain.Hao Ren had been trapped in school for far too long. Today\u2019s opportunity to travel with the Zhao Family had his eyes and mind refreshed by the green mountain and clear streams; he became cheerful as well.\u201cThere is a Daoist temple on top of this mountain called \u2018Heavenly Oneness Temple\u2019. It was said that Daoist Master Zhang had once cultivated here. The biggest palace in this Daoist temple is called the \u2018Founder\u2019s Palace\u2019. All of its shingles were covered with rolled gold. They have a pine tree that is two thousand years old as well. Moreover, there is a monument that was inscribed by Daoist Master Zhang himself\u2026\u201dAs he was eating, Zhao Guang suddenly became enthusiastic and pointed out to Zhao Yanzi.\u201cThat is fun!\u201d Zhao Yanzi looked to her father in anticipation, \u201cLet\u2019s go check it out after we finish eating!\u201d\u201cIt takes three hours to get up there. Since there are no cable cars here, your mom and I will pass on this one. We plan to walk up a little more, but then we will take our time to go back down and get some rest at the hotel,\u201d Zhao Guang replied.\u201cAwww\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi was obviously disappointed.\u201cOr you can ask Hao Ren to go with you?\u201d Zhao Hongyu suggested.\u201cWho needs his company!\u201d Gritting her teeth, Zhao Yanzi declared, \u201cI will go by myself!\u201d\u201cNo way. We would be worried if you went up there yourself!\u201d Zhao Hongyu denied Zhao Yanzi\u2019s proposition resolutely.Knowing that she could not defy her parents, Zhao Yanzi sulkily lowered her head in silence.After their meal, they continued the climb. After walking for about half an hour and having checked out \u201cElder Lord Cave\u201d that had immense history, Zhao Guang and Zhao Hongyu were ready to leave.As much as Zhao Yanzi wanted to continue upwards and to explore the Daoist temple on top of the mountain, she could only follow her parents\u2019 order now that they have decided to call it a day.Seeing that Zhao Yanzi was upset and was pouting her lips, Zhao Hongyu said, \u201cHow about\u2026 we make an exception and let you continue your tour here on the mountain?\u201dZhao Yanzi\u2019s eyes lit up instantaneously, and a bright smile started blooming across her face.\u201cBut there is one condition; Ren has to stay with you. Otherwise, we will be worried,\u201d Zhao Hongyu added.Biting her lip, Zhao Yanzi struggled for a few seconds but finally concurred, \u201cFine, I want to see what\u2019s up there!\u201dA shade of joy appeared on Zhao Hongyu\u2019s face as she turned to Hao Ren. \u201cRen, please stay with Zi. Come back down as soon as you reach the top of the mountain. Give us a call if you need anything. At your pace, four hours should be enough for you to go up and get back down to here. It takes approximately two more hours to get down to the foot of the mountain so that it would be six hours in total. We\u2019ll expect you to be back in the hotel by seven o\u2019clock.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euActually, Hao Ren did not want to go back to the hotel so early, either; it was a rare chance for him to be able to be immersed in nature. Therefore, he nodded at Zhao Hongyu assuredly and said, \u201cYes, auntie. I will try my best to look after Zi.\u201dZhao Guang gave Hao Ren a light encouraging nod before turning around and leaving with Zhao Hongyu.Hao Ren knew very well that Zhao Yanzi\u2019s parents were trying to create opportunities for him and Zhao Yanzi to get to know each other through spending time alone. However, he did not want to overthink it as all he wanted now was to visit the legendary Daoist temple.Likewise, Zhao Yanzi was thinking the same thing. Now that her parents had walked far away, she started shouting at Hao Ren, \u201cCome on, hurry up! Don\u2019t be a slowpoke and hold me back!\u201dAfter briefly rolling his eyes at her, Hao Ren looked up at the endless trail and took a step forward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedThe top of the mountain was three hours away from where they were. If they were fast, it would only take two hours. Adding the time it would take to return to the halfway point and then to the foot of the mountain, it would total to at least six hours.Thinking that he would have to spend at least six hours alone with Zhao Yanzi which was about half a day, Hao Ren became unsure.Fortunately, the scenery was splendid. If he could not bear to look at Zhao Yanzi, he could at least find consolation in the beautiful views.On the other hand, Zhao Yanzi was ecstatic. She was practically running up the mountain. It was unclear whether it was because she could not wait to visit the Daoist temple or that she was intentionally trying to lose Hao Ren.Needless to say, Hao Ren would not let her get out of sight so easily. Taking a deep breath, he sped up and followed closely behind her.\u201cHurry, hurry! See how slow you are!\u201d While climbing upwards, Zhao Yanzi turned around to press Hao Ren to go faster.Disregarding her taunts, Hao Ren continued at the speed he found appropriate. After all, he was a long-distance runner and knew how to properly distribute his physical capacity, unlike Zhao Yanzi who was sprinting without any thought of conserving energy for the latter part of their journey.Unsurprisingly, half an hour later, Zhao Yanzi who had been running hastily upwards had become exhausted. Gradually, she began to slow down.Going at an even pace, Hao Ren had caught up with Zhao Yanzi within minutes after she had slowed down. In no time, he had ran passed her.\u201cHey!\u201d Seeing that Hao Ren was going to abandon her, Zhao Yanzi couldn\u2019t help but yell at him.Putting on a face that looked innocent, Hao Ren turned around. Standing on a higher step, he looked down at her and asked, \u201cWhat? Can you not run anymore?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi\u2019s face was bright red, \u201cI just wanted some water!\u201dShe reached her arm towards Hao Ren and demanded, \u201cGive me some water!\u201dHao Ren opened her backpack, took out a bottle of water, and handed it to her.After gurgling down mouthfuls of water, Zhao Yanzi threw the bottled water back at Hao Ren in a hostile manner.Her bad attitude had indeed made Hao Ren feel uncomfortable. However, he reminded himself how nice her parents had been to him and decided to put up with it.Placing the bottled water back in the backpack, he proceeded to climb without a care for whether Zhao Yanzi could still keep up or not.That had made things very difficult for Zhao Yanzi. Now that Hao Ren had resumed climbing, she had to follow suit. For one, all of their supplies were in the backpack that Hao Ren was carrying. On top of that, she did not want to be looked down upon by Hao Ren. Hence, she could only force herself to carry on. In this situation, she could no longer utter any mockery towards Hao Ren as she did before.On their way up, Hao Ren had been going at an even and steady pace just as he would do if he was in a long-distance race. With a superior sense of rhythm, he could adjust his pace according to his breathing.On the other hand, Zhao Yanzi now felt torturous. As she tried to keep up with Hao Ren, she was constantly out of breath, and her face had gone from bright red to pale white. She couldn\u2019t stop glaring at Hao Ren as her grudge towards him grew.They continued climbing for a little longer before Hao Ren finally came to a halt. At last, Zhao Yanzi got a chance to catch her breath.Hao Ren opened up the map and studied it for a few seconds, \u201cWell, we\u2019re halfway there. At our current pace, we should be able to get there in an hour.\u201d\u201cAhhh? Another hour!?\u201d Zhao Yanzi\u2019s face was filled with despair. As she imagined having to repeat the ordeal she had just gone through, her body couldn\u2019t help but become weak and powerless.Paying no attention to her reaction, Hao Ren rolled up the map and got up on his feet again.Now that Zhao Yanzi had finally caught her breath, she saw that Hao Ren was ready to move on again without much of a break. She had immediately developed an intense hatred towards him. Pausing for a few seconds, she exploded in rage and started screaming at Hao Ren who was already far ahead, \u201cYou jerk!\u201dHao Ren turned around, still looking innocent and unaware. He looked at her from afar, \u201cWhat is wrong?\u201d He asked.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi was so mad that she was unable to utter a complete sentence through her gritted teeth.\u201cDo you need a break?\u201d Hao Ren asked.Zhao Yanzi\u2019s face had turned red from suppressing her anger and her desire for a break. Even though she did indeed need a break, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to say the words. She was afraid of giving Hao Ren a reason to mock or to look down on her.\u201cOh my, it does seem a little tiring. Let\u2019s take a break here then.\u201d Hao Ren put down the backpack and placed it on the steps. Then he sat down right next to it.\u201cKnow that you are the one who wanted to take a break, I haven\u2019t said a word about being tired!\u201d Zhao Yanzi uttered out of her pouty lips and sat right down on the ground like Hao Ren.Her pallid face was the best indicator that her body was about to give out, but Hao Ren had no intention of exposing her.They were sitting six to seven steps apart, staring right at each other.Hao Ren suddenly remembered that there was a camera in the backpack. He took it out quickly and pointed it at Zhao Yanzi who was sitting below him.Click!Her grumpy face was instantly framed and got captured in a photo.\u201cWho gave you the permission to take photos!?\u201d She screamed in a high-pitched voice.Trying to hand the camera to her from high up, Hao Ren said, \u201cHow about you take a photo of me, too?\u201d\u201cWhy would I want to take a photo of you!?\u201d Zhao Yanzi rolled her eyes.\u201cHow about\u2026 we take a photo together then?\u201d Hao Ren again suggested.Zhao Yanzi turned away from the camera without looking at Hao Ren, \u201cHumph, who would want a photo with an uncle like you!\u201dPromptly, Hao Ren put the camera back into the backpack and stood up, \u201cThat\u2019s enough of a break, let\u2019s get going.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi glanced at Hao Ren in annoyance. She knew that he was \u201cpunishing\u201d her for not cooperating, but there was nothing she could do but run along.Hao Ren turned around and saw that Zhao Yanzi\u2019s face was bright red from trying to catch up. He thought for a second and decided to slow down. Even though Zhao Yanzi was such an ill-tempered girl, there was no need to physically punish her for that.\u201cIf I had my Dragon Core, I could outrun you a hundred times!\u201d Punching Hao Ren\u2019s shoulder, Zhao Yanzi said regretfully.\u201cIf you can\u2019t climb anymore, it\u2019s not too late for us to turn back,\u201d Hao Ren proposed sincerely; there wasn\u2019t a trace of mockery in his tone.Yet, Zhao Yanzi gritted her teeth and responded determinedly, \u201cWho said I couldn\u2019t climb anymore? I will get to the top of the mountain for sure!\u201dSensing that Hao Ren was looking at her sympathetically, she clenched her teeth again. \u201cIf you can\u2019t do it, then start heading back yourself!\u201dHao Ren\u2019s mouth curved into a smile as he actually found Zhao Yanzi\u2019s determination to be quite commendable.At this time, Zhao Yanzi\u2019s face was bright red. Adorned with drops of sweat, her small nose and chest were rising and falling to the rhythm of her rapid breathing, and her snowy white skin was moist and silky like milk.The strands of her hair that were soaked by sweat made her seem almost enchanting. Although young, she had started to showcase her potential in growing up to be a beauty.Clutching her fist tightly, she abruptly took a deep breath and surpassed Hao Ren again. After that, she continued to run forward.Not knowing what to do with her, Hao Ren could only speed up and run along her.The two were advancing in silence. Since the site had no cable cars set up and it was already the afternoon, the higher up they went, the fewer tourists there were.As the view was becoming more grand and spectacular, the trail was also becoming quieter. In the end, it seemed as if Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi, the \u201ccompeting\u201d hikers, were the only ones left on this mountain.Obliquely, the sun came through from between the branches of the trees. Hao Ren looked down on his phone; it was already three o\u2019clock. If they didn\u2019t reach the top of the mountain soon, they would be returning late to the hotel. Especially if the sky darkened, it would be even harder for them to traverse the mountain.\u201cZi, we have to pick up the pace, or else we won\u2019t be able to make it down in time.\u201d After walking in silence for close to an hour, Hao Ren finally spoke up.\u201cQuit nagging me!\u201d Zhao Yanzi answered impatiently.Sweat had already soaked her face and most of her outfit. Judging from the look on her face, she was indeed trying her best already. After all, she was only a young girl, and Hao Ren was on the long distance running team back in high school; their physical strengths were not at the same level, to begin with.Just when they began to doubt whether they could make it in time, things took a different turn. As they followed the trail and walked around a big thick tree, the golden eaves of the Daoist temple had suddenly come into their sight.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHa! We made it!\u201d Zhao Yanzi shouted out of joy. She did not try to hold back her happiness of overcoming the mountain.Hao Ren also felt delighted. He was surprised yet satisfied to see that their efforts had come to fruition.At the same time, he was a little concerned. It had taken a long time and a lot of physical strength for them to reach the mountaintop. Would they be able to get back to the hotel by seven as they had planned?\u201cBubblehead! Hurry up and don\u2019t get lost!\u201d Seeing that Hao Ren was hesitant and hadn\u2019t moved off the steps, Zhao Yanzi couldn\u2019t control her excitement and yelled at Hao Ren unreservedly.Somehow, to Hao Ren, such thoughtless name-calling had indicated a sense of trust and friendliness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Carrying the backpack, Hao Ren stepped across the entrance of the Daoist temple after her.The golden eaves of the temple were soaking up the last bit of the afternoon sunshine, and the entire Daoist temple appeared solemn and serene.Since it was already afternoon and the temple was situated on top of the mountain, there weren\u2019t any visitors. As there were no cable cars, only people who were fit and determined like Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi would be able to visit the temple at this hour. Otherwise, one would have to start climbing in the early morning in order to arrive here by noon and then further spend the entire afternoon getting back down.Therefore, arriving at such odd hours, Zhao Yanzi and Hao Ren didn\u2019t run into any visitors. In the yard of the Daoist temple, some young Daoists were sweeping up fallen leaves. Even Zhao Yanzi who was yelling and shouting on her way in had become quiet as soon as she stepped into the temple.The paving bricks in the yard were of different colors and had been put together to create a massive picture of the Tai Chi and the Eight Trigrams. In the south-west corner of the yard, there was an aged yet towering ancient pine tree.Hao Ren knew that this must be the thousand-year-old tree Zhao Guang had mentioned. With a heart filled with respect, he walked over to it calmly. As the temple did not have many visitors, the ancient tree had not been fenced off. It had only quietly taken its place in the corner of the yard.Hao Ren walked up and reached out his hand, gently caressing its trunk which was full of senescence and fortitude.Its bark was rock-solid and smooth. From its outer appearance, it did not even look like wood anymore.Hao Ren stealthily began running the Concentration Cultivation Scroll and was becoming aware of nature\u2019s essence nearby. He was actually able to receive a burst of condense wood essence from the rigid bark of this ancient pine tree.Moreover, the Dragon Core inside his body seemed to have resonated with the ancient tree as Hao Ren could feel it vibrating inside of him. The warm and humid energy flow had traveled through Hao Ren\u2019s arms and towards the interior of the tree. At the same time, the ancient tree was also emitting a burst of wood essence towards Hao Ren, nourishing his body.Zhao Yanzi watched Hao Ren quietly. She understood that he must be having an enlightening moment and did not want to interrupt him.After a full minute, Hao Ren withdrew his hand and breathed out heavily. The fatigue that he felt from climbing up the mountain had completely vanished. Instead, all that was left in him was pure strength and prosperous liveliness.With his heart full of reverence, Hao Ren slightly bowed to the ancient tree.Hao Ren noticed that Zhao Yanzi had become dazed while watching him. He called to her with a smile, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dFor a few seconds, Zhao Yanzi could not react properly. She couldn\u2019t help but let out an \u201cOh\u201d and start following Hao Ren\u2019s footsteps. As she passed through the yard and entered the main palace, she was finally herself again. The image of the smile that Hao Ren just gave her had lingered in her mind, and she suddenly felt her heart flutter.Hao Ren didn\u2019t even realize how gentle he had just smiled at Zhao Yanzi. Upon entering the main palace, he raised his head to observe the statue of the Founder of the San Qing Religion that was a few meters tall. Then he proceeded inwards.The entire main palace was giving off a grand and magnificent, solemn and awe-inspiring atmosphere. It had instantly made Hao Ren feel that this visit was well worth their effort and time.Zhao Yanzi was following Hao Ren closely. Being surrounded by solemn-looking statues had frightened her a little.Through the main palace, they walked into another yard. There was a stone hut to the east of the yard, and inside of the hut stood a stone monument that seemed to have been there forever.Somehow, after the enlightenment at the ancient tree, Hao Ren suddenly felt that Zhao Guang had told them about the ancient tree and the stone monument on purpose.Hao Ren stood in front of the stone monument and began reading carefully the writing inscribed on it.\u201cIt is everlasting and cannot be named. It is the original void of \u2018non-being\u2019. This \u2018Oneness\u2019 is the Dao which is invisible and formless. It may be regarded as vague and intangible. When the Oneness Dao comes forward, its front cannot be seen. When one tries to follow it, one cannot see its rear. By abiding with the original Dao, one can master the presence\u2026\u201dAs hard as Hao Ren had tried, he was only able to make sense of a couple of sentences.Standing next to Hao Ren, Zhao Yanzi was also reading the words on the monument in silence.\u201cIf desire shall conceal true self, true self will manifest itself even more. If desire shall weaken the true self, true self will strengthen itself even more. If desire shall abandon the true self, true self will prosperous even more. If desire shall deprive the true self, the true self will give even more. This is known as the enlightened nature that is subtle yet profound. Gentleness overcomes strength, and the meek overcomes the strong\u2026\u201dThe more Hao Ren read, the more difficult it was for him to understand. Likewise, with her brows deeply furrowed, Zhao Yanzi seemed to be having a hard time deciphering it herself.This was the way to command water.Suddenly, a sense of enlightenment crossed Hao Ren\u2019s mind.It was as though an awareness had arisen from the bottom of his heart. It was about to break through his chest and reach for his head.Hao Ren then thought of the prosperousness and liveliness of the ancient tree again; it reminded him of the times when he was working on math problems. He felt as though his thinking was now finally on the right track and was about to be able to solve a challenging problem.\u201cWater gives life and nourishes all things on earth. Water breaks through and overcomes all impediments.\u201dBong\u2026The unexpected tolling of a bell had abruptly interrupted Hao Ren\u2019s reflection.Zhao Yanzi who was lost in her own thoughts had also jumped at the loud noise.Hao Ren turned around and looked at his phone. He realized that they had spent precisely half an hour standing in front of this stone monument.The continually falling leaves had found homes on the tops of their heads and their shoulders, and the young Daoists who were performing cleaning chores had also returned to rest.Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi were now alone in this empty yard.\u201cIt is quite late now, let\u2019s start heading back,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi responded obediently. It seemed that her thoughts were still with the writings on the monument.Hao Ren put out his hand and helped Zhao Yanzi to clear off the fallen leaves in her hair and on her shoulders.His gesture was casual and gentle, and Zhao Yanzi did not react in time. She felt surprised and a hint of sweet joy.\u201cThis guy is actually quite nice to me.\u201d Zhao Yanzi secretly thought to herself.On the other hand, Hao Ren did not put much thought into his gesture. He looked down and patted off the leaves on himself before leading Zhao Yanzi out of the front gate.Dusk seemed to come particularly early on the mountain. As the sun could still be seen hanging loosely from afar, its last beams of lights were trying to lit up the sky effortfully; it seemed that darkness would soon consume the world.\u201cLet\u2019s head down quickly.\u201d Hao Ren urged Zhao Yanzi as they could not afford any delays.With her lips pursed, although Zhao Yanzi was criticizing Hao Ren for having no compassion for the opposite sex in her mind, she did not dare to cause any real delays. Hence, she started following Hao Ren down the trail in compliance.As expected, the way down was less physically demanding than the way up. However, since the sun had gone down considerably, visibility had been significantly reduced. As they could not see the steps beneath their feet clearly, they had to move more cautiously and more slowly.The trails floored with green stone plates were like strings on an instrument, and the mountain streams were like musical notes. Together, they played the rhythms of the mountain. Puffs of cool and gentle mountain breezes swiftly crossed the countless branches, generating the most natural musical.As they walked, they were becoming more aware of all the changes around them. In the end, they seemed to have developed a more profound understanding of the natural simplicity that the Daoists had been promoting.The Daoist temple and pavilion stood far away in the seclusion of the endless greenness of the forest quietly. Conveniently borrowing the views of nature, these structures had completely become one with the mountain and forest. Such a splendid sight was certainly sufficient for Hao Ren to suspect that a legendary Daoist master could indeed take residence in this mountain.Hao Ren was immersed in the sceneries around him along the way. When he suddenly thought of Zhao Yanzi and turned around to check on her, she had already stopped moving a long time ago and was far behind him.Hao Ren formed a trumpet with his hands, placed it over his mouth, and yelled at her, \u201cHey\u2026\u201dZhao Yanzi heard Hao Ren. However, instead of walking forward, she actually sat down.\u201cWhat is up with her\u2026\u201d Hao Ren picked up his pace and began walking back to her. When he arrived, he questioned, \u201cWhy are you not moving?\u201dPouting her lips, Zhao Yanzi turned away from him.Hao Ren assumed that she was tired, so he sat down next to her for a break as well. He did not understand the mind of a little girl at all; he was so self-absorbed on their way down and did not check on Zhao Yanzi at all. Even though Zhao Yanzi did not say a word and tried to follow him with her greatest effort, she felt extremely upset and neglected.\u201cCan you still move?\u201d Seeing that Zhao Yanzi seemed to have no intention of getting up and the sky had darkened, even more, Hao Ren couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cIf I had my Dragon Core, I would have made it down a long time ago and not be here listening to you talk!\u201d She responded with rage.Now, Hao Ren finally realized that he had overlooked the fact that she was only a little girl and had limited strength. Zhao Yanzi\u2019s parents had asked him to look after her, yet, all he cared about was being on time. He was worried that they could not make it down the mountain in time and did not consider Zhao Yanzi\u2019s well-being at all. They were in a rush on their way up, and now they were in a rush on their way down as well.\u201cHow about\u2026\u201d Hao Ren paused to think, \u201cI carry you on my back?\u201d\u201cBah! Who would want that!?\u201d With cheeks puffed with anger, Zhao Yanzi stood up and started walking downwards.\u201cHey! Slow down!\u201d Hao Ren immediately ran after her as he was afraid she would trip.He began to have a slightly better understanding of this little girl\u2019s thoughts. Although she kept emphasizing that she didn\u2019t need Hao Ren to care for her, she became very upset when he actually did what she said,On their way down, Zhao Yanzi had picked up the pace, and Hao Ren was following by her side, trying to guard her against any potential dangers. The two were positioned like the intertwining black and white in the Tai Chi symbol as they traveled downwards along the peaceful trail.Still, as fast as they were proceeding, the sky had inevitably darkened.\u201cYou! Hurry!\u201d Now that the last beam of light was fleeing and they were still two hours away from the foot of the mountain, Zhao Yanzi had become genuinely anxious.\u201cIs it this side or that side?\u201d By the dimming light, Hao Ren held up the map and asked. The closer they were to the halfway point, the more small exhibits and diverging paths they would encounter.\u201cIt is definitely this side!\u201d Zhao Yanzi pointed to the left.\u201cOh, then it is definitely the other side!\u201d Hao Ren directly went towards the right. After Zhao Yanzi had given the wrong direction three times in a row, Hao Ren had become faithless in her sense of direction and believed that he had to go against her hunch to get to their destination.Zhao Yanzi was flabbergasted. Yet, she did not trust her own sense of direction either. In the end, she could only follow Hao Ren. Strangely enough, every time Hao Ren had gone against Zhao Yanzi\u2019s hunch and went the other way, it turned out to be the correct way down the mountain.There were no signs of any other human beings in the entire mountain, and it was almost dead silent. Consequently, the footsteps of Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi were becoming more distinct as they resonated in the dark.As the sun had set, the previously gorgeous sceneries had now become grim and gruesome. Being in this remote and thickly forested mountain, Zhao Yanzi was surely terrified as she was only a young girl after all. As a result, her speed had decreased, and she was not running ahead anymore. Slowly, she began walking by Hao Ren\u2019s side.This time, Hao Ren had figured out what she was thinking and took the initiative to hold her small hand. He had no intention of taking advantage of her; he worried that she might roll down the mountain if her legs started trembling due to fear.As the sky continued to darken, they proceeded even more slowly. Without noticing, it was already way past seven o\u2019clock. It was night time, and they were still at least two hours away from getting down to the hotel with their pace.Moreover, except the areas nearby Daoist temples which had cell towers, their cell phones had no signals anywhere else on the mountain. For them, there was nowhere to turn for help. Hence, Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi could only brace themselves and carry on.The paths on the mountain were full of twists and turns. Sometimes they pointed upwards and other times downwards. At times, the two had become confused whether they were climbing up the mountain or descending. Yet, overall, they felt that they were getting close to the foot of the mountain.\u201cHey, we\u2019re not going to starve to death here, are we?\u201d Pinching Hao Ren\u2019s palm, Zhao Yanzi couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cIf there is really nothing left to eat, then I will eat you first,\u201d Hao Ren said to her.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wrinkling her nose, Zhao Yanzi glared at Hao Ren while her cheeks puffed with anger. While talking with him, her fear automatically dropped.Time was ticking away; it was already eight o\u2019clock at night. However, the foot of the mountain still seemed unreachable to them.Being caught in this mountain where birds had the creepiest chirping, Zhao Yanzi had no one to rely on but Hao Ren. She stayed close to him and grasped his hand even more tightly.Hao Ren was also unfamiliar with the mountain. As he did not bring a flashlight, he could only turn on his cell phone and utilize the weak light from it to light up the path under their feet. He prayed that he would not miss a step and roll down the mountain with Zhao Yanzi.On their way down, they found some peculiar insects that were emitting golden lights. However, these were not fireflies as they tend to be lumpily attached to mountain cliffs.Zhao Yanzi had an intense fear of insects. She cowered right next to Hao Ren and clutched onto his hand firmly. Regret had now filled her heart. She regretted climbing to the mountaintop with Hao Ren as it had resulted in them being stuck in the middle of a mountain at night and could not make their way back down.\u201cHey, how am I supposed to walk if you\u2019re grabbing onto me so tightly?\u201d Hao Ren turned and asked her.Embellished on her fair face, Zhao Yanzi\u2019s starry eyes were beautiful and charming in pitch-dark.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not scared. I\u2019m only feeling a little cold.\u201d Zhao Yanzi\u2019s tenacious quibble had given herself away unintentionally.Enclosing her smooth and slippery palm tightly in his own, Hao Ren had strengthened his will to make it down the mountain and pressed on.After feeling their way in the darkness for over an hour, they finally caught a glimpse of the light from somewhere close to the foot of the mountain. The brilliantly illuminated hotel had also appeared before their eyes.\u201cWe\u2019re almost there!\u201d Pulling on Zhao Yanzi\u2019s hand, Hao Ren increased his speed. His cell phone was about to die, and the light emitted by Zhao Yanzi\u2019s cell phone was too weak to be helpful. If they did not get down now, they would seriously be stuck on the mountain.Zhao Yanzi also let out a sigh of relief and accelerated.At last, after about fifteen more minutes, they had made it to the entrance of the mountain.As she had been extremely anxious on her way down, Zhao Yanzi\u2019s palm was now fully covered in sweat.Now that they were safe, she finally realized that Hao Ren had been holding her hand for hours and abruptly withdrew her hand out of his.\u201cWhat a way to take someone\u2019s goodwill for ill intent\u2026\u201d Hao Ren sighed at her aggressive behavior.\u201cWho gave you the permission to hold my hand!?\u201d Zhao Yanzi asserted eloquently.Hao Ren couldn\u2019t be bothered with arguing with her as his stomach was now growling loudly. They had long finished all the snacks in the backpack on their way down.He promptly walked towards the hotel. Zhao Yanzi followed behind him, looking torn by her mixed feelings. Truthfully, she knew that she had become very dependent on Hao Ren on their way down. If it weren\u2019t for him, she would not know what to do in those situations.At the same time, she did not want to admit to herself that she could only get down with his help. She believed that if she had run into any real danger, her parents would surely come to her rescue.As soon as they got to the hotel, it seemed that their alliance had broken down. Zhao Yanzi was giving Hao Ren dirty looks as if he owed her millions.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNow that Zhao Yanzi was giving him the cold shoulder, Hao Ren did not want to waste any more effort on being friendly to her either. What concerned him the most right now was that he had to share a room with her father; he thought it might be awkward.As they entered the hotel respectively, they returned to their rooms. Listless and exhausted, Hao Ren was surprised to find that there was a note in the room. On it, it stated: \u201cZi\u2019s mother and I are going to visit a friend who lives nearby; we might be back late.\u201dDing dong\u2026 Ding dong\u2026At that moment, the doorbell of his room started ringing.He ran over to get the door and found Zhao Yanzi standing there awkwardly. \u201cHmm\u2026 Let\u2019s go eat?\u201d she said as she bit her lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He turned around and picked up his keycard. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dZhao Yanzi secretly felt relieved as she was totally expecting Hao Ren to reject her. As a stranger in a strange place, she would hate to eat out alone. If only her parents were around or her stomach was not violently voicing its dissatisfaction, she would not have come to ask Hao Ren so shamelessly.Her fierceness had further weakened as she recalled how she intentionally ignored Hao Ren only moments ago and now had to beg him to go eat out with her.The two walked out of the hotel and were in search of small restaurants. It was already past nine and was approaching ten o\u2019clock at night. Most of the restaurants had already closed. Not knowing where to look, they searched somewhat aimlessly in the areas close to the hotel. The fact that they could not find a restaurant that was open had made them even more hungry.Afraid that she might get lost, Zhao Yanzi was staying close to Hao Ren. Walking along a somewhat desolate street, Hao Ren had finally spotted a small restaurant ahead of them that was still operating.They rushed into the restaurant and were about to place two orders of food when they realized that there were a bunch of husky and muscular men in there. Some of them had their heads shaved, others were shirtless, and all of them were cursing and trying to drink as much as they could.Zhao Yanzi was scared and wanted to drag Hao Ren out of the restaurant. Hao Ren, on the other hand, gently grabbed her hand and comforted, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dHe was absolutely starving and had no more energy to look for any other restaurants. Besides, it was almost next to impossible to find another restaurant that was still open at this hour.He led Zhao Yanzi to a corner and seated themselves. He then said to the owner who had come up to greet them, \u201cTwo bowls of rice \u2013 one with shredded pork and garlic sauce and one with sauteed pork and green peppers, please.\u201dHe ordered on Zhao Yanzi\u2019s behalf without consulting her first. If it were any other times, she would definitely be 'scolding\u201d him for being disrespectful. But now, she was alarmingly watching the \u201cdangerous men\u201d around them and was too preoccupied to object to Hao Ren.\u201cWhere there are people, there are drunkards. I\u2019ll knock you out in three drinks, or I\u2019ll knock you out in five\u2026\u201d The men at the other tables were drinking and chanting as they played their drinking games. As the atmosphere became more fervent, their voices grew louder.Zhao Yanzi thought for a moment and decided to move from the seat across from Hao Ren to the one beside him instead.Her alarmed and panicky look reminded Hao Ren of a startled little bird. He chuckled and reached out his hand.Zhao Yanzi was confused. Moments later, she realized that Hao Ren was asking her to hold his hand.\u201cScrew you!\u201d Zhao Yanzi scolded quietly. \u201cI am not that scared,\u201d she thought.Soon, the piping hot rice bowls had been served. Zhao Yanzi randomly picked one and started engulfing it.So did Hao Ren. He picked up the other rice bowl and started devouring it like crazy.Their actions were so synchronized that they probably appeared to others as a very compatible couple.After dinner, the two felt that their stomachs had been filled with warmth. As Zhao Yanzi refused to stay in the restaurant for any longer, she asked Hao Ren to pay the bill and got out of there immediately.This little town at the foot of the mountain was incredibly quiet. At night, the distant mountain range could be seen generating a continuous and endless shadow.The moon was shining gently on the two of them, projecting two shadows on the smooth concrete path; one was tall, and the other was short.Observing their shadows that were touching each other ahead of her, Zhao Yanzi suddenly realized that she was standing too close to Hao Ren and quickly pulled herself away.Shuu, shuuu\u2026 Out of nowhere, a wildcat appeared and caused Zhao Yanzi to jump up and move closer to Hao Ren again.Facing her, Hao Ren once again placed his hand in front of her.Zhao Yanzi looked at him and paused for a few seconds. \u201cJust for a little while,\u201d she said.As she finished, she placed her hand into Hao Ren\u2019s palm.All of a sudden, she no longer felt anxious and uneasy. Instead, she felt calm. Moreover, any changes in their surrounding were not evoking much fear in her anymore.Hao Ren did not say much. He quietly focused on leading her back to the hotel along the paths they had previously taken.A peaceful small town, a serene mountain range, light breathing, gentle footsteps, and the slight warmth of the hand\u2026 it was all so tranquil.After walking for about fifteen minutes, they had arrived at the parking lot in front of the hotel, and their view instantly brightened.Hao Ren let go of Zhao Yanzi\u2019s hand. Zhao Yanzi turned and looked at Hao Ren as if she was ready to spew the harshest remarks. However, she decided to swallow it down instead.Her face had turned bright red as she somehow found herself useless and incompetent. Abruptly, she went into the hotel looking seemingly irritated. Hao Ren had no clue what was going on in her head. All he knew was that Zhao Yanzi was not the gentle and friendly type.Following her, Hao Ren walked into the hotel and returned to his room. To his surprise, he discovered that Zhao Guang was still not back yet.\u201cZhao Yanzi\u2019s parents must be catching up with their friend and lost track of time,\u201d he thought.He lay down on the bed and opened Zhao Yanzi\u2019s pink backpack. He took out the camera and found that they had only taken one photo with it the entire day. The only photo was the one where Zhao Yanzi was sitting on the step and looking up angrily with her cheeks puffed up.\u201cShe is actually not that annoying\u2026\u201d Hao Ren shook his head and laughed as he put away the camera.After he finished taking a hot shower, he realized that Zhao Guang had come back.Zhao Guang briefly inquired about their day on the mountain, and Hao Ren also briefly responded to his inquiry. Without any further questioning, Zhao Guang nodded, acknowledging his response, and went on to shower in the bathroom.Feeling nervous and awkward, Hao Ren got into bed. He was guessing that in the room across from theirs, Zhao Hongyu must be asking Zhao Yanzi about their day as well.It had been a scary and thrilling day. Nevertheless, he had successfully brought Zhao Yanzi down without anyone getting hurt. It was not an easy task to take care of that little girl.Having labored all day, Hao Ren quickly fell asleep before Zhao Guang could even come out of the bathroom.When he woke up the next day, Hao Ren found Zhao Guang sitting on the sofa watching TV.\u201cWere you exhausted yesterday?\u201d Zhao Guang asked as he saw that Hao Ren had woke up.\u201cA little bit,\u201d Hao Ren answered.\u201cWe are going to eat at a nearby Farmer Host in a bit. Afterward, we will be heading home,\u201d Zhao Guang told him.\u201cOk.\u201d Hao Ren nodded his head. He thought for a second and spoke again, \u201cThank you very much for your hospitality these days.\u201d\u201cAlright, go freshen up.\u201d Zhao Guang walked over to the window and pulled open the curtains.It was a drizzling and foggy day. The mountain view was hazy but splendid. A swift breeze came in through the window and started diffusing in the room. It was even colder than what they had encountered yesterday, but it was refreshing and awakening.Hao Ren put on his shirt and went over to the bathroom to freshen up. When he was ready, he followed Zhao Guang out, and they went to knock on the door across from theirs.When the door opened, Zhao Hongyu appeared, and Zhao Yanzi was following closely behind her mother.Zhao Yanzi was wearing a milky colored long T-shirt with a pair of gorgeous aubergine leggings; it was a beautiful and classic combination. Not only did the T-shirt look lovely on her, the tight leggings perfectly outlined the elegant and slender curves of her legs. Hao Ren couldn\u2019t help but keep glancing at her.On the other hand, Zhao Hongyu was wearing a Bohemian style floral dress. The excessive abstract floral patterns worked very well with the loose and flowy style, making her look casual and stunning at the same time.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBoth the mother and the daughter were each wearing a straw hat. The coffee-colored broad-brimmed straw hat perfectly matched the dark and light patches on Zhao Hongyu\u2019s dress, accentuating her elegance. Differently, the straw hat seemed a little out of place when it was matched with the rest of Zhao Yanzi\u2019s outfit. However, the fact that it was unconventional brought a sense of delight to the gloomy weather outside.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Zhao Hongyu tenderly held onto Zhao Yanzi\u2019s hand as she gave her keycard to Zhao Guang.Zhao Guang lead Hao Ren, and the four of them walked towards the hotel reception along the red-carpeted hall.Walking through the winding corridor of the hotel, Hao Ren saw GreenStone Mountain. Showered with drizzling rain and mist, it was like an impressionistic landscape painting.For a second, Hao Ren genuinely felt like he was a part of the family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29: The Real Master Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedAfter checking out of the hotel, Zhao Guang drove them to another place near the bottom of GreenStone Mountain.On their way to the destination, it was raining. The mountain range and clear waters both appeared a bit depressed. Zhao Yanzi was playing with the edges of her long T-shirt while looking at the rainy scene in silence.She changed to a new set of clothes because the weather turned chilly today. Hao Ren could only wear the shirt he wore yesterday because he didn\u2019t bring another set of clothes.The mountains were moving in the background, and the square car window outlined Zhao Yanzi\u2019s side face. It was a delicate face; the pink-whiteish neck supported a small head, and her black hair laid beside her porcelain-like ears. It presented a vague and dim aesthetic.\u201cIf this girl doesn\u2019t fight and quarrel, she is actually quite pretty.\u201d Hao Ren looked at her quietly and thought.The car stopped in front of a courtyard house. The owner of the courtyard house greeted the four of them zealously.Hao Ren noticed that a lot of old people lived there. Due to the rain, they were all chatting on the benches underneath the roof instead of going out for walks.\u201cIt\u2019s a great resort for elders who want to retire,\u201d Zhao Hongyu turned back and explained to Hao Ren.Hao Ren suddenly understood. This place was near the bottom of the mountain. The weather was beautiful, and the air was fresh. It was indeed an excellent place for retirement.The owner of the courtyard house brought them to a small backyard. Hao Ren found out that there was a hidden but beautiful spot; a small half-outdoor restaurant.Bamboos fences, frames covered with grapevines, antique-looking square tables, and a small piece of land planted with loads of vegetables\u2026 All of this reminded Hao Ren of his childhood.\u201cSit,\u201d Zhao Guang found a table, sat down, and said.There were only four tables there, and it wasn\u2019t as noisy as normal restaurants.The drizzling rain continued. The green corn field kept on swaying like the wave, and water dripping down along the grapevines created a beautiful scenery.The restaurant\u2019s stir fry dishes were cheap but tasted delicious. They were made from natural and organic ingredients.Zhao Yanzi\u2019s mother, Zhao Hongyu, was very charming and began talking about what had happened in the past. She talked about how the barren mountain started to flourish throughout the passage of history.Zhao Yanzi and Hao Ren both enjoyed listening to the stories about what happened before they were born.Even Zhao Guang, who normally remained silent, was in a good mood when talking about the people and origins of GreenStone Mountain in this pure and natural environment. He also talked about the lifestyle of people who were in Hao Ren\u2019s grandparents\u2019 age, and that drew Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi\u2019s interest.Zhao Yanzi had never experienced things like these, and that was why she was very interested. For Hao Ren, he still had vague memories of the past. As Zhao Guang kept talking, he felt more and more nostalgic.Halfway through the meal, Zhao Yanzi couldn\u2019t help but want to go out and look around. Zhao Hongyu didn\u2019t stop her. She borrowed an umbrella and asked Hao Ren to accompany Zhao Yanzi.Hence, both of them rushed out of the small yard surrounded by the fences and went to the nearby vegetable farm for an \u201cadventure\u201d.There was very little rain, and Zhao Yanzi was unwilling to hold the umbrella. She ran forward like a bird who just got released from its cage.She rolled up her pants and went inside the muddy cornfields with her sandals. Hao Ren wore sneakers and couldn\u2019t get down there. He could only watch her play around crazily and wildly while standing on the ridge,In Hao Ren\u2019s memories, he was often sent to his grandparents\u2019 place in the countryside when he was young, and the countryside at that time was fairly similar to the scenery there!It was a pity that with the expansion of the city, the countryside was replaced by reinforced concrete which later became factories, warehouses, and harbors\u2026\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi\u2019s feet were both covered in mud. She finally finished playing in the fields and returned happily to the ridge that Hao Ren was standing on.Due to the narrowness of the ridge and the slipperiness of the mud, she was unable to keep her balance and had to hold on to Hao Ren.Hao Ren grabbed her. Seeing that she found everything here interesting, he realized she actually had some cute sides.Nowadays, how many kids in the city had really gone to the countryside? They didn\u2019t even get a chance to touch a piece of soil, not to mention to play in the fields!Tall corn stalks seemed to separate this place from the outside and made a little isolated world.When one looked up, chilly rainwater hit his or her face. A blue sky could also be seen.When one looked down, the refreshing odor of soil came to one\u2019s nose. Occasionally, the sound of bugs could also be heard.\u201cIt\u2019s about time to go back,\u201d Hao Ren reminded her.\u201cNo! Let\u2019s go check the front too!\u201d Zhao Yanzi said capriciously as she dragged Hao Ren\u2019s arm and walked forward.It was rare for her to enjoy the real happiness of the countryside. How could she go back so easily?They came to a small river after crossing the cornfield. The water of the river was very clear. Although they didn\u2019t see any fish, the cobblestone riverbank was fairly beautiful.The rain dropped on top of the river and made many ripples; that created an elegant prospect in the rough and unadorned field.Hao Ren held up the umbrella and let her appreciate the small river. In fact, experiencing the countryside in these mountains and forests not only excited Zhao Yanzi but also delighted Hao Ren.Zhao Yanzi found a place with shallow water, went inside with her sandals for a bit, then returned to Hao Ren\u2019s side.Seeing that half of her body was soaked in water, Hao Ren was scared that she would catch a cold and dragged her back. Zhao Yanzi didn\u2019t resist this time.A small tree branch extended onto the side of the road. A small grasshopper jumped in front of them, a thrown-away worn-out bamboo basket was to their left\u2026 every small thing in front of their eyes made Hao Ren more and more nostalgic.Zhao Yanzi continued to walk and breath in heavily along the way as if she couldn\u2019t smell this kind of refreshing air when she returned to the city.A joyful feeling spread throughout the field.They returned to the small restaurant and saw Zhao Guang and Zhao Hongyu still eating. Zhao Hongyu didn\u2019t blame her daughter when she saw her whole body covered with mud. Instead, she took out a napkin gently and wiped off the rain on her forehead.\u201cHow was it?\u201d Zhao Guang asked Hao Ren. This random question made it sound like he was an elder who was familiar with Hao Ren and had known him for many years.\u201cPretty good. It\u2019s very rare to experience the feeling of the countryside now,\u201d Hao Ren replied.\u201cYeah. We\u2019ll be returning to the city soon,\u201d Zhao Guang nodded and said.Hao Ren nodded and looked at the green and lush mountains and suddenly felt lost.Zhao Yanzi cuddled inside her mother\u2019s arms and seemed like she was reluctant to leave the nature as well.Yet, they still had to go back. After half an hour, Zhao Guang drove his black Chevrolet and took them back to the city.It was still raining. Zhao Yanzi who played wildly for two days, finally couldn\u2019t stop the weariness from settling in as she leaned on the seat and fell asleep.Hao Ren looked towards the monotonous landscape of the highway. Feeling the quiet ambiance in the car, he suddenly realized that he seemed to be a lot closer to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family after the two-day field trip.Without Zhao Yanzi\u2019s unbearable ill temper, Zhao Hongyu and Zhao Guang were indeed very kind to him, and there weren\u2019t any problems with them.\u201cAfter returning to the city, let\u2019s have a family dinner together,\u201d Zhao Hongyu who sat in the front seat said suddenly.\u201cFamily dinner?\u201d Hao Ren reorganized his thoughts and asked with confusion.\u201cYeah, with Zi\u2019s Third Uncle, her Second Uncle\u2019s family, and our family,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said.\u201cShe completely treats me as a family member\u2026\u201d Hao Ren thought.However, thinking about meeting up with the relatives other than Zhao Yanzi\u2019s parents, Hao Ren felt pressured and shook his head, \u201cThis is not necessary\u2026\u201dHonestly speaking, as to marrying Zhao Yanzi, he hadn\u2019t had a clear idea yet. If there was a new way of solving the current problem in the future, maybe he wouldn\u2019t become Zhao Yanzi\u2019s \u201chusband\u201d, and Zi won\u2019t have to marry him unwillingly.Certainly, another reason was that Hao Ren knew Zi\u2019s Third Uncle didn\u2019t like him. Therefore, he didn\u2019t want to go to their family dinner.\u201cThat\u2019s fine, then we\u2019ll bring you back to your school,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said. She didn\u2019t have any intention of pushing Hao Ren.\u201cDoes Zhao Yanzi\u2019s father have two siblings?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cYes, you saw Zi\u2019s Third Uncle last time. He isn\u2019t married and has been single. Zi\u2019s Second Uncle is doing business overseas, but some of his family members stayed behind in East Ocean City, and we still meet quite often,\u201d Zhao Hongyu explained.Zhao Guang didn\u2019t participate in these conversations. Instead, he focused on driving.Hao Ren felt like their lifestyle wasn\u2019t any different compared to ordinary people, but they were probably wealthier than normal. \u201cZhao Yanzi\u2019s Second Uncle probably has a bigger business than her dad\u2019s.\u201d He thought.And as of Zi\u2019s Third Uncle, he looked malicious, his personality wasn\u2019t that great, and his temperament didn\u2019t feel like that of a successful person. He probably didn\u2019t have a stable job. \u201cNo wonder he is still single and didn\u2019t get married.\u201d He wondered.As if she guessed what Hao Ren was thinking, Zhao Hongyu said, \u201cZi\u2019s Third Uncle is very diligent in cultivating. He doesn\u2019t care about secular matters and never had any thoughts of having a family nor a career. Zi\u2019s Third Uncle may look ordinary, but he has the highest cultivation level out of all three brothers.\u201d\u201cOh? How does he compare to Su Han?\u201d Hao Ren asked randomly. He remembered that Zhao Hongyu once said that in their circle, Su Han already belonged to the top tier.Zhao Hongyu smiled. \u201cTwo Su Han can\u2019t even beat Zi\u2019s Third Uncle.\u201dHer reply slightly shocked Hao Ren. Two Elder Lu couldn\u2019t beat Su Han, and two Su Han couldn\u2019t beat Third Uncle\u2026 According to Zhao Hongyu\u2019s statement, Su Han was a Heavenly level master who was one step away from entering the Soaring Realm. Then the actual strength of this Third Uncle\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAs for a person like me who is still a newbie struggling with the beginner\u2019s cultivation technique, Zi\u2019s Third Uncle can pinch a hundred of me to death with a single finger\u2026\u201dHao Ren\u2019s forehead was covered with a layer of cold sweat.\u201cHer Third Uncle has a bias against you. But don\u2019t worry, he isn\u2019t the type of person who kills for no reason,\u201d Zhao Hongyu smiled and said.\u201cThis Third Uncle loves Zi very much. No matter what, I am nominally Zi\u2019s \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d. In this period of time, if I did anything against \u201cthe normals of a husband\u201d, I probably will die very miserably\u2026\u201dAnother layer of cold sweat suddenly covered Hao Ren\u2019s forehead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He said good-bye to Mr. and Mrs. Zhao and thanked them for the weekend.Zhao Hongyu had gotten more and more satisfied with their future son-in-law. She felt that he was considerate, smart, and even more pleasing than Zhao Yanzi. She already secretly treated him as her son.Hao Ren returned to his dorm room and saw no one was in there; he guessed that they probably went to the internet cafe. It was because the school regulations stated that first and second-year students couldn\u2019t bring their computers to the dorm, and the school wouldn\u2019t connect internet for lower years\u2019 dorms. Therefore, internet cafes were the most visited places by lower-year students.While they were out, Hao Ren finished the assignments that had been accumulating for a week. He didn\u2019t bother to do the complicated ones as he had planned to borrow someone\u2019s and copy their assignment.Near dinner time, the other three guys were still not back. In fact, Zhao Jiayi and the others believed that Hao Ren went home already and would only come back to the dorm around seven or eight o\u2019clock on Sunday night. They wouldn\u2019t have guessed that Hao Ren went to spend some time with his \u201cfianc\u00e9e\u201d this weekend.Hao Ren recalled the weekend that he spent at GreenStone Mountain. It was probably the most substantial and meaningful weekend he has had in a while.Hao Ren took out his cell phone and found the picture of Zhao Yanzi pouting in anger.He uploaded the picture from the computer in the hotel to his cell phone.Her shiny eyes were like black pearls, her nose was delicate, her mouth was as small as a cherry, and her eyelashes were naturally curly. With the background of green forest and gray stone stairs, this girl seemed like she had potential as a fashion model.If Zhao Jiayi and the others didn\u2019t see Zhao Yanzi in person, they would think that Hao Ren had downloaded a beauty\u2019s picture from somewhere on the internet and set it as his cell phone\u2019s wallpaper.Hao Ren thought about it and still didn\u2019t dare to use the picture as the wallpaper on his cell phone.\u201cAlthough she is just a little girl, she will become a super beautiful lady after three years. Anyway, the fifteen-year-old Zhao Yanzi is probably already a super pretty girl with that kind of appearance. She is probably really popular at her school too.\u201d\u201cUh, what am I thinking about? Am I jealous\u2026\u201d Hao Ren suddenly realized.Zhao Jiayi and others finally came back noisily around seven o\u2019clock in the evening. They were caught by surprise when they saw Hao Ren in the room.\u201cHow come you came back so early today?\u201d Zhao Jiayi asked.They totally thought Hao Ren went back home, and Hao Ren certainly didn\u2019t mention that he went on a trip with Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family. If they knew that he went out with the little girl\u2019s family, they would definitely doubt his relationship with the little girl.\u201cTomorrow is the Athletic Game. Ren, you got to work hard and try not to come in at the last place,\u201d Zhou Liren patted Hao Ren\u2019s shoulder and said encouragingly.\u201cYour expectations of me are so \u2018high\u2019!\u201d A drop of cold sweat appeared on Hao Ren\u2019s forehead as he thought.\u201cIt\u2019s great that we don\u2019t have any classes for the whole day tomorrow!\u201d Speaking of the Athletic Games, Cao Ronghua who usually had a calm personality seemed to be excited as well.They chitchatted about which class\u2019 beauty would be there and looked everywhere for a telescope. They didn\u2019t have any hope towards Hao Ren\u2019s 1500-meter race. If he wasn\u2019t their roommate, they probably wouldn\u2019t even care.From their perspective, Hao Ren was a \u201clast-minute resort kind of guy\u201d. He would be doing great if he didn\u2019t get the last place. After all, there weren\u2019t any great athletes in their major. Most of the people were ordinary students. Occasionally, there were a few people who were talented, but those talents were mainly in regards to academics.They talked about tomorrow\u2019s Athletic Games excitedly. Hao Ren ignored them and went to the balcony for some fresh air.The rain was already gone, and the moon that was in the sky was bright.Hao Ren recited the Spirit Concentration Scroll silently twice. He felt refreshed, as all the negative energy around him seemed to have disappeared.He tried to recall the ancient tree from the Daoist temple in GreenStone Mountain and the stone monument attentively. He always felt that there were some inspirations that he couldn\u2019t grasp on to no matter what.Even now, Hao Ren still couldn\u2019t forget the comfortable feeling of the rich wood essence entering his body. He also couldn\u2019t comprehend the weak suction that happened when the energy in his body went towards the trunk of the tree.\u201cWater element\u2026\u201dHao Ren suddenly thought of what Su Han said when she grabbed his arm.\u201cIs it possible that the Spirit Concentration Scroll utilizes the water elements that originates from heaven and earth?\u201d An idea came to Hao Ren\u2019s mind.\u201cIf desire shall conceal the true self, the true self will manifest itself even more. If desire shall weaken the true self, the true self will strengthen itself even more. If desire shall abandon the true self, the true self will prosperous even more. If desire shall deprive the true self, the true self will give even more. This is known as the enlightened nature that is subtle yet profound. Gentleness overcomes strength, and the meek overcomes the strong\u2026\u201d.The scripts on the stone monument appeared in front of Hao Ren\u2019s eyes again.Hao Ren felt his heart pounding, and the barrier that stopped him from advancing to the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll was about to be broken.\u201cAs a matter of fact, Zhao Guang asked me to go to that Daoist temple not only to accompany Zhao Yanzi but also to test how much I could comprehend and understand.\u201dHao Ren frowned and tried his best to look for the sensation of \u201cwater\u201d.However, the more stubborn he was, the harder it was for him to comprehend it.He took a deep breath and slowly recited the Spirit Concentration Scroll to calm down his mind.\u201cWater is Yin and wood is Yang; affinity and counter can complement each other; combining toughness with tenderness so they can have mutual control and support\u2026 Hao Ren thought about the ancient tree and suddenly had some profound inspirations.The seed that the ancient tree left inside Hao Ren\u2019s body that contained pure wood essence abruptly sprouted. In the meantime, the water element in the air formed into a few tiny water streams and poured into Hao Ren\u2019s body.Hao Ren felt his whole body was extremely comfortable, and the body that was originally \u201ctransparent\u201d became a clear container and took in all the nature\u2019s energy from heaven and earth.He knew that he was about to break through the first level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll and achieve the second level! It was the inspiration that the ancient tree brought him. In terms of that stone monument, it talked about the ways of managing and controlling water, and it matched the essence of the third level of Spirit Concentration Scroll.The mist that was originally spreading in the air gradually formed into nine vague whirling streams of water and entered into Hao Ren\u2019s nine crucial acupoints around his body.After entering Hao Ren\u2019s body, the thick streams tried to find their own positions and began to settle down.\u201cWhat are you doing outside, Ren?\u201d Zhao Jiayi yelled from inside the room.Hao Ren was suddenly shocked and the nine water streams that were filling Hao Ren\u2019s body immediately vanished.Zhao Jiayi walked to the balcony and patted Hao Ren\u2019s shoulder, \u201cWhat are you thinking out there? You have a race to attend tomorrow! Go to bed early!\u201dHe dragged Hao Ren back inside.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt the same time, the ancient tree that brought Hao Ren his seed of inspiration completely vanished and Hao Ren couldn\u2019t find any trace of wood essence nor control the abundant water energy inside his body. His body was like a container that leaked from the bottom, and all the accumulated \u201cwater\u201d was gone.Nature\u2019s energy around Hao Ren\u2019s body once again returned back to chaos as it wasn\u2019t divided into the five elements anymore.Hao Ren understood that this failure wasted a great opportunity to advance to the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll. Additionally, he didn\u2019t know when his next breakthrough will be.Even though he was disappointed, he didn\u2019t want to blame it on Zhao Jiayi. After all, Zhao Jiayi saw him standing outside for too long and asked him to take a break for his own good.\u201cSigh, I better find a quiet place without disruption for cultivation,\u201d Hao Ren climbed up to his upper berth and thought in annoyance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The festive atmosphere was everywhere even though no lanterns or banners were hanging.Zhao Jiayi and the other two got out of bed early in the morning. They packed up some food, drinks, camera, telescope, etc. They ganged up with their neighboring dorm rooms and headed towards the sports field together.Hao Ren, on the other hand, put on his sportswear and his running shoes before he had a big breakfast in the cafeteria. Then, he unhurriedly walked to the sports field.The Athletic Games was divided into two sections. Indoor events such as badminton, basketball, and volleyball were held in the newly-finished stadium whereas outdoor activities such as track and field and gymnastics were held on the sports field.There were relatively more outdoor events than indoor ones due to the large space. Therefore, it was more popular too.Since the school suspended classes for this event, it was mandatory for students in their freshmen year, sophomore year and junior year to watch the games. Basically, junior year students were to watch the indoor games while freshmen and sophomore year students were to watch the outdoor games.Sure enough, almost every student was satisfied with not having to go to classes. They watched the games with snacks in their hands while chatting from time to time. They seemed as relaxed as if they were on a middle school field trip.However, for the guys like Zhao Jiayi, it was way more interesting to search for pretty girls with their telescopes and cameras.Xie Yujia, the Class President, was already taking attendance when Hao Ren arrived at his class\u2019 designated area in his sportswear.\u201cYu Rong!\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d\u201cZhao Jiayi!\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d\u201cCao Ronghua!\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d\u201cZhou Liren!\u201d\u201cHere!\u201dSince the Class President was taking attendance herself, they couldn\u2019t muddle with it unlike classes with a lot of students. Not only did everyone show up, but they also appeared to be extremely excited.An ordinary t-shirt on Xie Yujia made her looked extremely comfortable and refreshing in such beautiful weather. However, the highlight of her outfit was not the white t-shirt with the word \u201cFighting\u201d printed on it; it was the sexy ripped jean shorts over her pretty legs. It made people assume that she was in a great mood today. The usually conservative Class President was wearing something so appealing. It made the guys\u2019 hearts beat fast.\u201cHao Ren, you are here,\u201d Xie Yujia gave him a warm greeting.\u201cWoah\u2026!\u201d The guys kicked up a fuss seeing the unusual greeting.\u201cWoah what! You can go attend the games too if you are capable!\u201d Xie Yujia scolded the guys with her stern Class President face.Her smooth hair was tied up behind her, revealing her long neck and soft shoulders. Her face looked as smooth as a freshly peeled egg under the sunshine. She looked very beautiful even though there was no makeup on her at all; the charm she had wasn\u2019t seductive at all.However, the guys weren\u2019t frightened by her today. Instead, they got even more unscrupulous.\u201cGood luck today!\u201d Xie Yujia stepped up and adjusted Hao Ren\u2019s collar.\u201cWow\u2026!\u201d The guys were yelling in surprise as they saw Xie Yujia\u2019s move.Even a few guys from the nearby class joined them. Although Xie Yujia kept a very low profile, she was still one of the prettiest girls in their major.Hao Ren got a bit embarrassed and stepped back. \u201cOk, I\u2019ll try my best.\u201d\u201cClass President! I want to run the 1500-meter race too!\u201d\u201cCount me in as well!\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201dThe guys shouted in jealousy and envy.\u201cHumph! You weren\u2019t so proactive when you were supposed to, and now you are starting to bluff!\u201d Xue Yujia glimpsed at them.\u201cI was on the list, Class President! I want you to adjust my collar too!\u201d Zhao Jiayi jumped up and cried out.Hao Ren remembered clearly that Xue Yujia randomly put in Zhao Jiayi\u2019s name since no one else enrolled. Now he was taking advantage of it to tease Xie Yujia and Hao Ren.Xie Yujia ignored Zhao Jiayi\u2019s request. She stood up blushing and said, \u201cAlright, now let\u2019s go on with the attendance. Gu Jiadong\u2026\u201dHer excellent figure was lightly shown under her white t-shirt. Although Xie Yujia didn\u2019t want to show off, she was still a top-ranked beauty in the guys\u2019 eyes.Zhao Jiayi made a bet with the other three as soon as they got into university. They wondered who amongst the 38 guys in the class would be able to make this beauty his girlfriend. The fact was, in the past two years, not only in their class, but no guy in the entire school had a dubious relationship with her.Compared to the most popular girl at the university, Lin Li, who always had rumors floating around, Xie Yujia indeed had a low profile. As a matter of fact, according to Zhao Jiayi\u2019s scoring standard, that Lin Li from Class Three wasn\u2019t as pretty as Xie Yujia on both looks and temperament. She was only good at getting involved with the influential and popular guys in the school. In other words, she was only good at promoting herself.Lin Li, who was sitting under the sun-umbrella like a spoiled girl, overheard the noise and looked over.She was a bit surprised to see Xie Yujia looking so pretty in her outfit. But she was then upset when she noticed some guys in her own class were starting in Xie Yujia\u2019s direction too.Xie Yujia did not intend to steal her thunder at all; she only wanted to dress up a little on such a pleasant day to cheer up the guys in her class. Though, indeed, Hao Ren was the only one that was participating in an actual game.Lin Li glimpsed over at Xie Yujia and landed her eyes on Hao Ren who was in sportswear. Her expression darkened as she thought of something. Then she turned her attention back not to make people believe that she was interested in an ordinary guy.The noise was becoming unbearable for Hao Ren who was in the Class Two area. He turned to Xie Yujia. \u201cI\u2019ll go warm up over there.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush? The 1500-meter race won\u2019t start until this afternoon,\u201d Xie Yujia didn\u2019t realize that Hao Ren was just trying to avoid Zhao Jiayi and the guys.\u201cAll the long-distance races are scheduled in the afternoon so there won\u2019t be enough space for warming up later on,\u201d Hao Ren waved as he got down from the spectator stand by jogging down the stairs.Xie Yujia lost her train of thought when she watched Hao Ren\u2019s natural and unrestrained body walk down in sportswear. She only came back to her senses when someone called out her name. She then went on with the attendance.\u201cHow come he seemed even more handsome after a weekend?\u201d Xie Yujia felt a bit strange. She was worried that it was her subconscious that gave her the idea. \u201cIs this what \u2018Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder\u2019 means?\u201d She wondered.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen Hao Ren got to the track, Huang Xujie entered the sports field from the locker room in his golden Adidas sportswear.He did a short spring and stopped to stretch his legs. Then he waved in the direction where most of the girls were.\u201cAh\u2026!\u201dThe girls in the Advertising Major, Business Major, and Finance Major screamed as if they saw a celebrity. The screaming continued one wave after another.Lin Li who was in the Mechatronic Engineering Major also got excited.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although clean and tidy, there were some fray edges. Its quality was a lot worse than Huang Xujie\u2019s silky Adidas sportswear which was shining under the sun.Huang Xujie was wearing a pair of fancy long-distance running shoes whereas Hao Ren was wearing the most common pair of sneakers.Huang Xujie curled his lips at Hao Ren in disrespect after seeing how poor his outfit was.Having ignored him, Hao Ren ran over to the track.\u201cSophomore,\u201d Huang Xujie said as Hao Ren was passing by, \u201cYou are ready for your last place in the match, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cMy name is Hao Ren, not \u2018sophomore\u2019.\u201d Hao Ren turned around.\u201cHehe,\u201d Huang Xujie sneered as he leaned over to Hao Ren\u2019s ear, \u201cI\u2019ll completely surpass you in front of the entire school.\u201d He whispered.He said lightly but surely in his arrogant tone.Xie Yujia, on the spectator stand, was a little confused by the \u201cintimate\u201d talk between the two on the sports field. \u201cSince when did these two become good friends?\u201d She thought.Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to argue with him as he did not expect a good placement in the race. However, he would try his best because the Class President picked him for the race. However, there was nothing he could do if he still got the last place.\u201cYou don\u2019t even dare to talk anymore, sophomore?\u201d Huang Xujie looked at him in a provoking manner as he performed a split. It made the girls on the spectator stand scream crazily again.Hao Ren ran quietly to the track with his fists tightly clenched. He really wanted to hit Huang Xujie when he provoked him, but he was able to hold back.\u201cHe thinks the entire East Ocean University is his just because of his charm?\u201d Hao Ren turned back to look at the 'senior\u201d as he found it funny just thinking about it.It seemed like no one but Xie Yujia and Hao Ren\u2019s classmates would pay attention to this unimpressive guy in low-quality sportswear and old sneakers.On the contrary, girls were reacting passionately whenever Huang Xujie passed by. His black hair, well-built body, confident look, and the yellow sports bracers all became reasons for their screaming.To them, Hao Ren who just passed by Huang Xujie was incomparable to the charming man. They did not even notice the few seconds of conversation between them as they passed by each other.Hao Ren got to a quiet corner on the west side of the sports field. He practiced shuttle runs on the rubber track. The intense sunshine caused him to be soaked in sweat after just a little while.He returned to the spectator stand after feeling completely warmed up and went back to where his class was at.Xie Yujia had finished taking the attendance, and everyone had taken their seats. They were waiting for the game to start as they sipped on their drinks and shared snacks.\u201cHao Ren!\u201d Xie Yujia waved her slim arm in excitement when she saw him coming over.Hao Ren walked over, and Xie Yujia pointed at the empty seat near her. \u201cCome sit here.\u201dThe invitation was to Hao Ren\u2019s surprise. He searched for Zhao Jiayi and the other two of his roommates as he said to Xie Yujia, \u201cI\u2019d better go sit with them.\u201d\u201cThey are in the very back, and you have to go for your race later. It\u2019s inconvenient to go up and down like that.\u201d Xie Yujia gave him a reason to stay.Hao Ren saw Zhao Jiayi and the guys waving at him, but then he saw the crowded area filled with cards and sunflower seed shells. They were nudging each other and making a lot of noises. Hao Ren gritted and thought to himself, \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll have to put girls before bros today.\u201dHe sat down beside Xie Yujia.This move completely startled Zhao Jiayi. His mouth gaped open; it was almost wide enough to fit an egg.\u201cHao Ren\u2026the guy who blushes whenever he sees pretty girls is sitting beside the Class President Xie Yujia?\u201dThen something even more startling happened.Seeing how sweaty Hao Ren was, Xie Yujia took out some tissue and wiped off the sweat from his forehead with a smile.Ka-cha!Zhao Jiayi felt like his own jaw had dislocated.\u201cSensational news!\u201d He shouted at Cao Ronghua who was busy playing cards after he realized what was going on. \u201cRen is dating Xie Yujia!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhou Liren cried out. He stopped playing cards to look at Hao Ren and Xie Yujia who were sitting together below them. Then his facial expression looked exactly the same as Zhao Jiayi\u2019s.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. I can do it myself.\u201d Hao Ren was flattered as Xie Yujia wiped his sweat for him. He hastily stopped her smooth white arm.The intense-enthusiasm Xie Yujia was showing towards him was making him uncomfortable.\u201cIt\u2019s ok. You are our class\u2019 hero.\u201d She smiled.Then she handed over a bottle of water. \u201cHere, you need to keep hydrated.\u201dZhou Liren and the guys almost dropped their jaws to the ground at the sight of this.\u201cRen is really having some luck with women\u2026\u201d They thought at the same time.\u201cDon\u2019t be so nice to me, Class President. I\u2019m not ready for it,\u201d Hao Ren took the bottle as he made a defensive gesture. He was being honest due to nervousness.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of being this nice to you from now on.\u201d Xie Yujia laughed.Hao Ren was stupefied by her smile as he felt like his heart was about to pop out of his chest.\u201cI was joking,\u201d Xie Yujia added after seeing Hao Ren\u2019s stupefied look.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Hao Ren finally returned to normal.He thought for a bit and said, \u201cClass President, don\u2019t blame me for disappointing you if I really end up last in the race.\u201d\u201cAs long as you tried your best.\u201d Xie Yujia\u2019s genuinely stared at him with her pretty eyes, \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest difference between you and them.\u201dHao Ren laughed bitterly and didn\u2019t respond.\u201cOh, do you know Huang Xujie?\u201d She suddenly asked.\u201cSort of\u2026\u201d Hao Ren mumbled. He thought girls like Xie Yujia would probably be interested in cute guys like Huang Xujie.\u201cHe is kind of cute, and a lot of girls like him,\u201d Xie Yujia said.\u201cHehe.\u201d Hao Ren laughed.

He looked closer and realized there were two girls instead of one who entered the sports field.Due to the distance, he couldn\u2019t see who the girls were. However, by the color and style of their uniforms, one of them indeed looked a lot like Zhao Yanzi.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Xie Yujia asked as she sensed the weirdness in Hao Ren\u2019s behavior.\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Hao Ren looked at the rostrum that was on the opposite side of the sports field. Yet his kept looking at those two girls.\u201cThere are two of them so it shouldn\u2019t be Zhao Yanzi,\u201d Hao Ren thought.The students who were warming up went back to their classes one by one. Huang Xujie also returned to the spectator stand and sat down with other junior and senior competitors.Since junior students were watching the indoor games and senior students were busy with their internship as well as job search, it was not mandatory for them to watch the game. Therefore, the junior and senior competitors\u2019 classmates were mostly not present.However, it was not a problem for Huang Xujie since he was famous at the school and all the girls around the sports field knew about him. It was safe to say that more than half of them were his supporters.As the tradition of the Athletic Games, the Principal went up onto the stage to give a speech. It was nothing more special than advocating sports spirit and encouraging students to exercise more.Following that was a speech from Vice Principal Lu Qing. He gave a brief speech and announced the beginning of the Athletic Games full of energy.This was the first time Hao Ren saw Lu Qing in public. He would never have thought that the vice principal would offer him 'special treatment.\u201dHowever, people cared more about the beautiful Su Han who didn\u2019t show up today. But thinking about it, as an ordinary teacher instead of an instructor or a class advisor, she didn\u2019t have to attend Athletic Games at all.The events focused on majors instead of which year the students were from. The first game was a 400-meter relay race. Participants from the Management Major, Environmental Chemical Engineering Major, Mechatronic Engineering Major, and Life Science Major all went onto the sports field.Hao Ren noticed that Huang Xujie who was from International Business Administration Major also went up in his golden sportswear.The girls screamed as she stepped onto the track.At that moment, Hao Ren glimpsed over at the entrance where the two middle-schoolers were at. He was relieved as they had disappeared.All the eight participants were in their positions on the track.Pa! The students representing the eight majors suddenly bolted ahead following the sound of the starting pistol.\u201cThey are all so fast!\u201d Xie Yujia sighed lightly.Hao Ren knew this would happen since they were all carefully chosen from their majors. They were all elites athletes, and it made sense that they exceeded the level of a high school sports event by a large degree.Soon, three relays had been completed, and none of the major had missed the passes. The relay batons were handed over to their last contestants.Hao Ren focused his attention on Huang Xujie because he subconsciously regarded this man as his competitor in the 1500-meter race.The International Business Administration Major was in the second place when the baton was in the third runner\u2019s hand. He was almost five meters behind the guy from the Mechatronic Engineering Major.However, Huang Xujie came from behind and chased after that runner after he received the relay baton.It was extremely difficult to make up those five meters within a 100-meter distance.The somewhat quiet spectator stand suddenly burst into cheers.Even Xie Xujia was concentrating on the race, and she stood up lightly.Five meters! Four meters! Three meters!Hao Ren opened his eyes wide in surprise.Huang Xujie had a powerful explosive force, similar to that of a rocket!The girls\u2019 cheerings turned into screamings.Zhao Jiayi and the guys who were playing cards all put their hands down to look at the race in astonishment.Two meters! One meter! They were in a tie!\u201cHuang Xujie\u2026\u201dThe screaming of his name filled up the entire sports field.The exciting scene at the beginning of the Athletic Games put a satisfying smile on the school officials\u2019 faces.Boom!Huang Xujie ran across the finish line a half-step faster with the relay baton in his hand.He lifted the baton up high and waved at the audience, showing a winner\u2019s stance.\u201cHuang Xujie! Huang Xujie!\u201dThe girls started to call out his name rhythmically as the rhythm followed his waving arm.Huang Xujie was immersed in the happiness of victory. He shook his head as sweat dripped off his black hair. There were pride and satisfaction on his face.\u201cNo wonder he is the president of the Rock Climbing Club,\u201d Xie Yujia sighed as she looked towards the finish line.\u201cYou like him?\u201d Hao Ren asked.Xie Yujia shook her head. \u201cNo. I just think he is pretty cool. His grades are good, and he has a cute face. He even excels in sports. No wonder he is the prince charming in so many girls\u2019 heads.\u201d\u201cAnd he comes from a decent family?\u201d Hao Ren added.Xie Yujia turned around and looked at him, \u201cAre you a little jealous?\u201d\u201cI am racing with him in the 1500 meter race this afternoon. Will you be cheering for him or me?\u201d Hao Ren shrugged and revealed a smile.\u201cOf course for you!\u201d Xie Yujia answered without thinking.He nodded in satisfaction.\u201cHey, what are you thinking?\u201d Xie Yujia asked as she suddenly felt something was wrong.\u201cNothing. I thought you are one of his fans too,\u201d Hao Ren said lightly.\u201cI am not one of those girls,\u201d she answered.However, this comment sounded a bit familiar to Hao Ren.The cheering of the girls started to fade as the second game started.Huang Xujie took his time as he returned to his seat. From there, he looked in Hao Ren\u2019s direction.\u201cIs that a warning?\u201d Hao Ren wondered.However, the explosive force wasn\u2019t the most important component when it came to long-distance race. Hao Ren calmed himself down, not letting Huang Xujie influence his mood.The second event was the 110-meter hurdles, and it was a relatively new event. It started to gain popularity amongst university Athletic Games after Liu Xiang became the Olympic champion.\u201cHere you go,\u201d Xie Yujia opened up a bottle of water and handed it to Hao Ren.She gave her own to him as she noticed that Hao Ren came empty-handed.\u201cThank you, Class President.\u201d Hao Ren laughed in embarrassment.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou need to replenish your stamina for the race this afternoon,\u201d she said.Zhou Liren and the guys got very jealous seeing how nice Xie Yujia was treating Hao Ren. They were all regretting their decision for not enrolling in the game. Otherwise, it was worth it even if they got the last place because the beautiful Xie Yujia would be taking care of them.But unlike them, Hao Ren was feeling a little uncomfortable with Xie Yujia\u2019s special care.Just when he was feeling restless, a crisp and melodious voice came from behind him.\u201cUncle!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He thought about it and scolded her, \u201cNot only did you skip school yourself, but you also told your friend to skip too.\u201d\u201cThe classes today aren\u2019t that important. It\u2019s fine.\u201d Zhao Yanzi still acted like there was nothing wrong with skipping school.Hao Ren couldn\u2019t do anything about her and didn\u2019t know how to deal with her right now.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Xie Yujia looked at Hao Ren in confusion.\u201cAh, this is my\u2026,\u201d Hao Ren could only say, \u201cmy sister.\u201d\u201cYour sister is very beautiful,\u201d Xie Yujia praised Zhao Yanzi sincerely.\u201cYou\u2019re very beautiful too, big sister,\u201d Zhao Yanzi answered deliberately.While the two girls were looking at each other, Zhou Liren, who was sitting at the top of the spectator stand and playing cards, poked Zhao Jiayi and pointed at Hao Ren.\u201cDamn! It\u2019s that little girl from last time. Ren is in big trouble!\u201d Zhao Jiayi frowned as he recognized Zhao Yanzi as the one who waited for Hao Ren at Green Hill Cafeteria.\u201cWant to go and check it out?\u201d Zhao Liren dropped the cards and said worriedly.\u201cCheck out what? That little girl is so hard to deal with. You think you could do it?\u201d\u201cThen what should we do?\u201d Zhou Liren stared at Zhao Jiayi.Zhao Jiayi glared at him. \u201cCut the cr*p! Of course, we should continue to play cards! A pair of kings!\u201dAt Hao Ren\u2019s side, Zhao Yanzi and Xie Yujia gazed at each other for two seconds without saying anything.Xie Yujia wasn\u2019t stupid; she could sense a bit of jealousy when Zhao Yanzi called her \u201cbig sister\u201d. Thus, she stopped talking and waited to see what would happen next.\u201cI\u2019m already here, and you want me to go back?\u201d Zhao Yanzi glared at Hao Ren and asked.\u201cSo I should allow you to skip class?\u201d Hao Ren asked her.Zhao Yanzi pouted. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll go see Lu\u2026\u201dHao Ren covered her mouth, \u201cOkay okay okay, you win.

But go back before noon.\u201dZhao Yanzi pushed away Hao Ren\u2019s arm and dragged Ling to sit beside her.\u201cYour sister seems like she\u2019s tough to deal with,\u201d Xie Yujia came up to Hao Ren and whispered.Hao Ren rubbed his temples and couldn\u2019t express his discomfort. Who would have expected that this little girl would skip class and come here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thirsty. Go buy a drink for me. Oh and get a drink for Ling too,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said to Hao Ren after sitting down.\u201cI\u2019ll give you money. You go buy them yourself!\u201d Hao Ren said petulantly.\u201cI don\u2019t know your campus well. What if I get lost?\u201d Zhao Yanzi retorted.\u201cHow did you find this place then?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the big sports field easy to find? I had to ask one by one for the location of your class!\u201d Zhao Yanzi squinted her eyes and said with pride.\u201cShe probably can\u2019t find the corner store. You should buy it for her,\u201d Xie Yujia said.Thus, Hao Ren stopped arguing with Zhao Yanzi, left the spectator stand, and walked outside of the sports field to buy drinks.Seeing Hao Ren vanish at the entrance of the sports field, Zhao Yanzi turned her head, looked at Xie Yujia, and said something that surprised Xie Yujia, \u201cAre you his girlfriend?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 um\u2026\u201d Xie Yujia looked at her awkwardly as she didn\u2019t expect this kind of question.She carefully observed this little girl closely and found out that her skin was delicate and smooth. Her flickering eyes made her look especially cute. Moreover, an ordinary middle school uniform didn\u2019t make her look average but rather youthful and lively.Her body that was gradually developing also made people think that she was beautiful. Anyone would find her extremely pretty and see the potential of her becoming a real beauty when she grows up.However, the aggressiveness of Zhao Yanzi\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t make Xie Yujia think that she was cute. A \u201cdangerous aura\u201d diffused from her body, making Xie Yujia, the \u201cbig sister\u201d who was four to five years older than her, a little nervous.\u201cI saw you giving him water,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said.\u201cOh, about that\u2026\u201d Xie Yujia was relieved, \u201che\u2019s just like you. He didn\u2019t bring anything to drink, so I gave him a bottle of water. That was it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not his girlfriend?\u201d Zhao Yanzi tilted her head and looked at Xie Yujia as if she was double-checking.Xie Yujia nodded dully, \u201cUm\u2026 um\u2026\u201d\u201cThought so! How can a guy like Uncle have a girlfriend?\u201d Zhao Yanzi pouted her mouth and said.\u201cUncle\u2026. \u201d Xie Yujia sweated as she heard this title. Even though Hao Ren wasn\u2019t good-looking, he wasn\u2019t that old either.\u201cYou\u2019re his sister?\u201d Xie Jiayu made use of Hao Ren\u2019s absence and asked.\u201cDo you want to hear the truth or the lie?\u201d Zhao Yanzi asked.\u201cTruth, of course\u2026\u201d Even when she added the words \u201cof course\u201d, Xie Jiayu\u2019s tone sounded hesitant. She wanted to hear both the truth and the lie.\u201cI\u2019ll remind you first that Uncle is quite a useless person. You\u2019ll definitely regret it if he becomes your boyfriend,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said.\u201cOh\u2026 then what\u2019s the truth?\u201d Xie Yujia was covered in sweat as she heard the unexpected \u201cadvice\u201d.\u201cThe truth is,\u201d Zhao Yanzi paused for a bit on purpose, \u201cI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Xie Yujia\u2019s mouth opened wide, and she nearly fell to the spectator stand.At this time, Hao Ren ran back with four bottles of water.He sat in between Zhao Yanzi and Xie Yujia, separating them. Then, he handed two bottles of water to Zhao Yanzi. \u201cThis is for you and your classmate.\u201dThen, he handed a bottle to Xie Yujia. \u201cThis is for your water earlier.\u201dLing took the water from Zhao Yanzi\u2019s hand, came close to Zhao Yanzi, and whispered, \u201cIs fianc\u00e9e some kind of a joke?\u201d\u201cOf course it is. I was tricking her,\u201d Zhao Yanzi whispered back righteously.\u201cWhy did you trick her?\u201d Ling asked in confusion.\u201cI am pissed. Why can\u2019t I?\u201d Zhao Yanzi snorted twice.After Zhao Yanzi and her classmate joined them, the atmosphere between Hao Ren and Xie Yujia seemed to be a little different. At first, they could still comment on the competition; but now, both of their attentions were on the two middle school girls.\u201cIs this your sister, Ren?\u201d A few nosy guys who didn\u2019t know anything about Zhao Yanzi came up to Hao Ren and teased him.Hao Ren thought that these guys were done for as Zhao Yanzi was so short-tempered. However, Zhao Yanzi made an adorable expression and said to them, \u201cHi, do you guys have any snacks?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d They were stunned when they heard such request from this super cute little girl. They immediately delivered their unopened potato chips, cookies, and beef jerkies to Zhao Yanzi.\u201cThank you, big brothers!\u201d Zhao Yanzi gave them a bright smile, causing those guys to almost faint in happiness.Thus, Zhao Yanzi didn\u2019t even have to go out and buy snacks. She opened up a massive pack of snacks and ate them with Ling as they watched the competition. She completely ignored the existence of Hao Ren.They were having so much fun that it felt like they were out for a field trip.Hao Ren was completely speechless and was debating whether or not to report this to her father tonight. To his surprise, she skipped school without feeling guilty at all. This was something that absolutely never happened when he was studying in middle school. She should at least be a little nervous.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNot only Hao Ren, but Xie Yujia also looked at them in astonishment. As a Tri-Merit Student (Also called the three-good student. It\u2019s an award given to students who are athletic, score straight A\u2019s, and have good morality) since she was little, it was difficult for her to imagine that middle schoolers dared to skip school for no reason.Certainly, what she cared more about was the \u201cfianc\u00e9e\u201d situation that Zhao Yanzi mentioned. She didn\u2019t believe that this little girl was Hao Ren\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Instead, she thought that Zhao Yanzi was merely a naughty little girl. However, she did hear some rumors regarding the Lincoln Stretch Limousin pick up that Hao Ren had as well as his \u201cengagement\u201d.\u201cCould it be that Hao Ren will be marrying this girl\u2019s older sister?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, no wonder Hao Ren couldn\u2019t do anything about her and had to treat her like his little sister,\u201d Xie Yujia analyzed the situation with her intelligent brain.\u201cHowever, this little girl is so pretty. Her sister must be even prettier.\u201d Another thought came to Xie Yujia\u2019s mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although his speed couldn\u2019t be compared to Liu Xiang\u2019s, the whole process was fantastic.Meanwhile, there were other games going on, such as high jump, long jump, shot put, and so forth. On the screen, the names and majors of each student who got excellent results were shown.Zhao Yanzi watched for a while and almost finished then snacks. Then. she suddenly turned to Hao Ren and asked, \u201cUncle, when will it be your turn?\u201d\u201cMy race is in the afternoon,\u201d Hao Ren answered.\u201cWhat race?\u201d Zhao Yanzi continued.\u201c1500-meter race,\u201d Hao Ren answered calmly.\u201cJust one?\u2019 Zhao Yanzi opened her eyes widely.\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Hao Ren nodded.Hearing Hao Ren\u2019s response, Zhao Yanzi mumbled, \u201cSo useless.\u201d\u201cDo you need your husband to able to run a decathlon?\u201d Hao Ren almost shouted that out.\u201cI always get first place for long-distance races at my school,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said.\u201cFine, next time I will come and watch your race.\u201d Hao Ren said absentmindedly.Zhao Yanzi\u2019s face showed a bit of annoyance. She made a striking pose all of a sudden. \u201cYou! If you can\u2019t get the first place then you are absolutely useless!\u201d She shouted.Somehow, her words touched Hao Ren\u2019s heart. He suddenly realized that the reason she sneaked out was probably to watch his race.The resistance he had against her suddenly disappeared. Instead, he felt quite moved.But if that was the case\u2026\u201cYou have to go back before noon,\u201d Hao Ren said to her.\u201cYou nag too much!\u201d Zhao Yanzi twisted her pretty eyebrows. \u201cI had asked for a leave!\u201d\u201cWhat is the reason?\u201d Hao Ren continued to ask.He soon realized that he disciplined her quite a lot. Especially when he didn\u2019t even know this little girl about one or two weeks ago\u2026\u201cI feel ill!\u201d Zhao Yanzi almost screamed.Hao Ren didn\u2019t expect her to ask for a leave just to watch his race. Thus, Hao Ren caved. \u201cFine, but you have to go back after I finish my race.\u201dHe felt that since he wasn\u2019t her elder, there was no need to pester her so much. He also sneaked out of class when he was back in middle school, and he sneaked out, even more, when he got into university. Therefore, he actually wasn\u2019t qualified to give Zhao Yanzi a lesson.\u201cI got it! You are so annoying.\u201d Zhao Yanzi rolled her eyes at Hao Ren.Ling, who sat beside her, covered her mouth while laughing. It was probably her first time seeing the fearless Zhao Yanzi being driven nearly crazy by someone.She was dragged out by Zhao Yanzi today, and the reason she gave to the teacher was to keep Zhao Yanzi company at the hospital. The teachers were aware of how influential and wealthy Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family was, so they didn\u2019t dare to give her a hard time. What surprised Ling was that although Zhao Yanzi couldn\u2019t be considered as an excellent student, this was her first time skipping class.\u201cTime for the 1600-meter relay race,\u201d Xie Yujia reminded Hao Ren suddenly. Dozens of students on the bleachers started walking towards their specific spots.Hao Ren switched his attention to the sports field as he saw Huang Xujie would be participating in this race too.The 1600-meter relay race was the highlight of the Athletic Games at Eastern Ocean University as it wasn\u2019t only a test of endurance and explosive force but also a reflection of teamwork. The 400-meter relay race, by contrast, took such a short amount of time that it finished even before the audience could really enjoy it. Therefore, it could only be seen as a warmup.Cheers sounded on the spectator stands that were silent a few moments ago as Huang Xujie showed up.He purposely rolled up his sleeves to show the solid deltoid muscles. Underneath his sports shorts were a pair of thick and strong legs. Those chunky legs didn\u2019t make him look short and chubby because of his 180-centimeter height. Instead, he looked extremely powerful.The way he showed off his muscles caused another wave of screams from all the girls.\u201cThat guy in golden sportswear looks handsomes,\u201d Staring at the track, Ling who was beside Zhao Yanzi said to her.\u201cEm, yeah.\u201d Zhao Yanzi looked over and nodded.\u201cLittle kid, what do you know about good looks?\u201d Hao Ren objected vaguely.Ling turned around and cast a slight glance at Hao Ren; it seemed like he offended them by objecting their taste of beauty.Zhao Yanzi, however, pretended she didn\u2019t hear Hao Ren\u2019s words. She stared at the track motionlessly as if she was admiring Huang Xujie who was trying to act cool.Her act made Hao Ren a bit jealous. Although he never thought of marrying Zhao Yanzi, she was still his fianc\u00e9e by name.What he didn\u2019t know was that Zhao Yanzi had nearly the same thoughts when she saw Xie Yujia give water to Hao Ren.After warming up for a few minutes, every athlete got into positionChants like \u201cCome on, XXX!\u201d or \u201cCome on, XXX Major!\u201d soared through the entire field. However, among all the cheerings, the loudest and most in sync one was definitely \u201cCome on, Huang Xujie!\u201d\u201cDamn, such a nice Athletic Games is now becoming that guy\u2019s private show.\u201d Hao Ren felt secretly annoyed.Thanks to the rules of the Athletic Games, each athlete could participate in no more than three games. \u201cOtherwise, who knows how much limelight that guy would get.\u201d Hao Ren thought as he didn\u2019t realize the annoyance he had towards Huang Xujie had evolved into disgust.However, most of the guys were annoyed by Huang Xujie anyhow. As he always tried to act cool, most of the guys in the school were just choking with silent fury. After all, Huang Xujie\u2019s father was the deputy mayor, and he was the president of the most popular Rock Climbing Club; most of the guys didn\u2019t have the chance to get close to him.Bang! As soon as the starting pistol fired, the eight athletes who represented the eight majors launched themselves into the race with a burst of acceleration. The whole atmosphere heated up instantly. All kinds of cheerings resonated in the field.Compared to the Mechatronics Engineering Major, International Business Administration Major didn\u2019t have a lot of male students; that was why they never did very well in sports. As the trump card of their major, Huang Xujie was placed as the fourth runner to boost the performance of the major.After the third runners finished, the distance between the International Business Administration Major and other majors were getting longer and longer. As the relay baton was handed to Huang Xujie, he was over twenty meters behind the first-place runner from the Mechatronic Engineering Major and over ten meters behind the second-place runner from the Computer Science Major.\u201cThere is probably no chance of overthrowing with such a distance gap,\u201d Following the situation on the field, Hao Ren thought to himself.However, Huang Xujie who was on the outermost track strived to catch up. His golden sportswear seemed to have created a golden whirlwind around him. He ran the 400-meter distance in a flat-out sprint as if he was doing a 100-meter dash.Two meters! One meter!He outran the second-place runner within three hundred meters!There were only one hundred meters left!Similar to what happened during the 400-meter relay race, he was about five meters behind the first-place runner!It was impossible to catch up as he had already run at full speed for the last three hundred meters. How could he still be able to sprint through the last one hundred meters like it was a 100-meter dash?Hao Ren couldn\u2019t help but to get up and look at the track; he felt like his heart was on tenterhooks.Actually, it wasn\u2019t only him. Almost all of the people on the spectator stands got up to watch the final dash.Woosh!Huang Xujie surprisingly surpassed the first-place runner and reached the finish line with a one-meter gap.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dThe entire audience went crazy.\u201cIs this guy a real human? How could he have such a strong explosive force as well as incredible endurance?\u201d Hao Ren looked at the finish line with a bit of astonishment.\u201cHe runs so fast!\u201d Ling couldn\u2019t help but express her praise when she saw Huang Xujie run for the first time.Numerous first and second-year students from the International Business Administration Major stood up and cheered vigorously for their third-year senior!Being a hero again, Huang Xujie took off his golden sports t-shirt immediately and showed off his muscles. Then he held the t-shirt in his hand and waved it around.\u201cDoes he think he\u2019s a world champion?\u201d Seeing the result, the guys around Hao Ren sat down one after another and complained discontentedly.\u201cHuang Xujie! Huang Xujie!\u201d The name Huang Xujie was called out in sync by over a thousand students from the International Business Administration Major.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHao Ren sat back down, grabbed a bottle of water, and had a sip.\u201cThis guy has saved his major and snatched victories at the last minute twice already. From this respect, he indeed is worthy of pride. However, he isn\u2019t fighting for the honor of his major; he is just submerging himself in the satisfaction of victory. He just would like to see others cheering for him.\u201d\u201cThis is obvious as Huang Xujie didn\u2019t gather and celebrate the victory with his team members. Instead, he chose to run around by himself.\u201dHao Ren was calmly analyzing Huang Xujie\u2019s behavior after he got his victory.\u201cIt that who you will be competing with this afternoon?\u201d Seeing the serious look on Hao Ren\u2019s face, Zhao Yanzi asked suddenly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do you have any advice?\u201d Hao Ren asked her.\u201cNo advice. I just hope you won\u2019t lose to him,\u201d Zhao Yanzi answered.\u201cIt might be tough to not to lose to Huang Xujie\u2026\u201d Hearing Zhao Yanzi\u2019s words, Xie Yujia followed up with some doubts.She would go to the Student Council sometimes to help out, and she learned something about Huang Xujie. Before he became the president of the Rock Climbing Club, he was the provincial long-distance race champion back in high school. Although he fell behind after he got into university, winning a championship on the university level would still be too easy for him.There would only be a sliver of a chance for Hao Ren to win against Huang Xujie; Huang Xujie would need to make a big mistake. Seeing Zhao Yanzi talk to Hao Ren as if she was giving an order, Xie Yujia felt speechless.Although she wished that Hao Ren could get a good result, she felt that this little girl thought too highly of him.After the 1600-meter relay race, there was pole vaulting in the middle of the sports field. It was incredibly eye-opening as Hao Ren realized that Eastern Ocean University had numerous undiscovered talents.After watching javelin throwing and shot putting, it was time for lunch.\u201cHao Ren, let\u2019s go get lunch. You can\u2019t get hungry since you have a race in the afternoon,\u201d Xie Yujia said to Hao Ren.Hao Ren looked back at Zhao Jiayi and the other guys and found that they were still playing cards with a great passion. He uttered a sigh, nodded, and said, \u201clet\u2019s go.\u201dHe looked back at Zhao Yanzi and Ling, \u201cLet\u2019s go together.\u201d He said.Zhao Yanzi looked at him and then got up. Obviously, Ling followed her.\u201cSuch a little girl, but she already has the qualities of a leader,\u201d Hao Ren thought in secret as they all walked out of the sports field.All the cafeterias were open, but they went to Clear Stream Cafeteria which was the closest to the sports field; it also had the best food in the university.This cafeteria was behind the pink dorm building for female students. Many beautiful female students would come here for food, and there were a lot of male students there who wanted just to come here and admire the girls. Zhou Liren, for example, always went to this cafeteria by himself, hoping that he could meet a pretty girl from first-year and start a relationship\u2026There weren\u2019t as many people as usual because of the Athletic Games. Xie Yujia brought them to the second floor, turned around, and asked Zhao Yanzi and Ling, \u201cwhat do you guys want to eat?\u201dZhao Yanzi looked at the menu on the wall and answered, \u201cTwo orders of sizzling beef.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Xie Yujia nodded and then asked Hao Ren, \u201cHow about you?\u201dHao Ren rushed to take out his Prepaid Cafe Card, \u201cEm\u2026I\u2019ll get it myself.\u201d\u201cCome on, it\u2019s on me today!\u201d Xie Yujia grabbed Hao Ren\u2019s hand and pushed his card back.Her palm was smooth and soft. She didn\u2019t care much, but she was actually grabbing Hao Ren\u2019s fist.Hao Ren felt quite embarrassed and quickly retracted his hand; he didn\u2019t want the Class President to think that he was trying to take advantage of her.\u201cWe\u2019ll take four orders of sizzling beef so that we don\u2019t have to be in the lineup again.\u201d Xie Yujia walked up to the ordering window briskly. \u201cSir, can I have four orders of sizzling beef?\u201dIt was embarrassing for Hao Ren to have a girl to pay for the food. Hao Ren had no choice but to let Xie Yujia pay since she was so straightforward.Zhao Yanzi and Ling found two empty seats. They just sat down and started enjoying the beautiful view of the university.Hao Ren and Xie Yujia stood beside the steaming pick-up window as they waited for their sizzling beef.\u201cThat\u2019s so\u2026 how can you pay? You had already treated me to Spicy Hot Pot last time,\u201d Hao Ren said to her.\u201cThat only cost a few bucks; it doesn\u2019t count. You are going to represent the entire class in a race this afternoon. This can be a treat for you,\u201d Xie Yujia said with a smile.She smiled slightly, but it was honest and refreshing.\u201cYou always talk about class\u2019 honor and stuff, but you are buying me food with your own money; they aren\u2019t from the bank account of the class committee,\u201d Hao Ren said.Xie Yujia suddenly pointed out the window and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201dSeeing her happy face, Hao Ren found that even the serious Class President had times when she was like a gluttonous kitty.They held two plates of sizzling beef each and walked to the table while enjoying the smell of the delicious food.Zhao Yanzi and Ling were both at the age when their bodies were growing. Therefore, they were already starving and couldn\u2019t hide the hungry look on their faces when they smelled the food.Xie Yujia smiled at Hao Ren as she saw Zhao Yanzi eating in a hurry; Zhao Yanzi completely disregarded how hot the beef was. Xie Yujia didn\u2019t believe that this little girl was Hao Ren\u2019s fiancee, and she treated Zhao Yanzi like a little sister as well.The four of them continued to have their lunch quietly. Xie Yujia didn\u2019t plan to ask this little girl for her name, and neither did Zhao Yanzi.After finishing their lunch, Xie Yujia looked at Hao Ren and said proactively, \u201cHao Ren, it is still too early to go back. How about we walk around the campus?\u201dHao Ren was about to agree when Zhao Yanzi interrupted and said, \u201cUncle, didn\u2019t you promise me that you\u2019d show me around?\u201dXie Yujia paused for a moment. She quickly thought that Zhao Yanzi was misunderstanding the situation and said. \u201cI meant the four of us could walk around the university.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother, I\u2019ll just walk around with him,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said decisively.Xie Yujia received a light blow, but that didn\u2019t make her mad. \u201cFine, Hao Ren; you can keep them company.\u201dShe suddenly felt that this little girl had such a strong possessive desire. \u201cI can\u2019t erase her hostility even after buying her lunch? Did she really think that I\u2019m going to take away her big sister\u2019s boyfriend?\u201dThinking of this, Xie Yujia started wondering again, \u201cWho is the big sister of this little girl? Is she beautiful?\u201dAs she was about to leave, Zhao Yanzi suddenly yelled towards the gate of the cafeteria in excitement, \u201cBig sister!\u201dXie Yujia looked back at the gate. Hao Ren also turned around as soon as he heard Zhao Yanzi\u2019s yell.Su Han showed up at the gate wearing a long striped blue dress.She walked towards Zhao Yanzi and Hao Ren slowly as if her feet didn\u2019t even touch the ground. Her graceful elegance seemed to block all the grease and smoke of the cafeteria.Xie Yujia was so shocked that she had to cover her mouth to prevent herself from making any sound.\u201cHer big sister is Su Han? The teacher who made all the guys lose themselves in reverie? Hao Ren\u2019s girlfriend is Su Han?! No wonder Su Han asked Hao Ren to go to her office a few days ago, the reason was\u2026\u201dXie Yujia was so puzzled that she was lost in the mind trap she had set up for herself.\u201cI was looking for you, but I didn\u2019t expect you to come here,\u201d Su Han walked up to Zhao Yanzi and said to her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAll the students who were having lunch were genuinely shocked as they saw Su Han appearing in the cafeteria. The impression they had of Su Han was that she was so pure and elegant that she would never show up in any cafeteria at the university.\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d Zhao Yanzi looked at Su Han in confusion.Su Han took a glance at Hao Ren before slightly holding onto Zhao Yanzi\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ll show you around the university.\u201dLike what Hao Ren experienced last time, Su Han\u2019s move seemed slow and elegant, but it didn\u2019t allow Zhao Yanzi to get away. Zhao Yanzi\u2019s wrist was already in Su Han\u2019s hand before she realized it.Seeing Zhao Yanzi got taken away by Su Han helplessly, Hao Ren paused for a few seconds and then turned around to look at Xie Yujia and Ling. \u201cEm\u2026\u2026let\u2019s go back to the sports field,\u201d he said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They walked back to the spectator stands while watching the race on the track.There was, theoretically, two hours set aside for lunch, but only a few students went to the cafeteria for lunch. Most of them were just eating cookies and bread, playing cards, or chatting while watching the games.Zhao Jiayi and other guys were surprised and excited to see Hao Ren and Xie Yujia come back together. Nobody could have ever predicted that Hao Ren would get so close to the Class President Xie Yujia unknowingly, especially since Hao Ren seemed so honest and shy. \u201cXie Yujia will probably become his girlfriend if everything continues to go smoothly.\u201d They all thought.\u201cHey, last time you have said that if Ren could get a girlfriend within the four years of university, you would give 1000-yuan to me and Cao Ronghua.\u201d Noticing what was going on, Zhou Liren who just lost 30-yuan playing cards yelled at Zhao Jiayi.Zhao Jiayi used to think that it was absolutely impossible for Hao Ren to find a girlfriend, but he was starting to panic now. However, it wasn\u2019t in his character to break promises. Therefore, he thought for a while and said, \u201cZhou Liren, how about we have another bet? This time, we will bet on the ranking Ren could get in this race.\u201dThe classmates around them were also excited and ready to join in on the bet when they heard Zhao Jiayi\u2019s suggestion. \u201cHehe, this is interesting! We are in!\u201d\u201cFine, fine, fine! The bet is open!\u201d Throwing away the cards in his hands, Zhao Jiayi picked up a paper and a pen from the ground and began writing down and recording the bets. \u201cThe ratio will be one to one if you bet on Hao Ren getting the last place; one to one and a half if you bet Hao Ren will get the second last place\u2026 one to fifty if you think Hao Ren will get the second place; and one to one hundred if Hao Ren you think Hao Ren can get the first place!\u201dOthers got excited as soon as Zhao Jiayi started the bet.\u201cI bet 100-yuan on Hao Ren getting the last place!\u201d\u201cI bet 50-yuan on Hao Ren getting the second last place!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bet on the second last place too. He can\u2019t be so weak that he will get the last place, right?\u201d\u201cI bet 10-yuan on him getting the last place. 10-yuan profit is still profit!\u201dAs they were making bets at full blast, Hao Ren and Xie Yujia sat down in their old spots; they had no clue as to what the guys were doing.Ling also sat back down as she quietly enjoying her drink. Her appearance was average. She wasn\u2019t good-looking but wasn\u2019t ugly either. She went back home with Zhao Yanzi after school every day, and they skipped class together today. It was obvious that she was Zhao Yanzi\u2019s best friend at school.\u201cAside from Zi\u2019s special status, she is just a normal middle school girl who has her best friend, her own hobbies, and her own temper\u2026\u201d Hao Ren thought.Following the 400-meter hurdle, there were a few female games. The 400-meter relay race, the 1600-meter relay race, and 800-meter race\u2026The appearance of female students dressed in tight tops and shorts instantly heated up the field that was silent and dull.Eastern Ocean University was a comprehensive university. Every major possessed comparative teaching resources and research abilities. The feature that made it most popular was probably the number of beautiful female students it had.The eyes of all the guys on the spectator stand lit up, and the binoculars laying beside their feet were picked up again.It was finally showtime for the majors that had more girls than guys. Majors such as Liberal Arts, Film and Television, and Fine Arts were going to demonstrate their athletic abilities.Seeing Hao Ren stare at the track with sharp interest, Xie Yujia seized the chance to tease him. \u201cThere are so many pretty girls at Easter Ocean University, and you still don\u2019t have a girlfriend?\u201d\u201cThere is a pretty girl in my class, is it necessary for me to find one somewhere else?\u201d Hao Ren said casually without even looking back.Xie Yujia froze for a moment. Then she looked at the calm expression on Hao Ren\u2019s face, making sure he didn\u2019t have any other special meaning, She then asked after thinking for a while, \u201cDo you have a girlfriend already?\u201dFollowing the start line on the track, Hao Ren \u201creviewed\u201d the beautiful and well-built girls one by one and didn\u2019t even hear Xie Yujia\u2019s question.Xie Yujia\u2019s face turned red. She had planned on taking the opportunity to ask Hao Ren more about Su Han. However, after giving it a few more thoughts, she held back as she felt she had been too gossipy recently.Bang! Eight beautiful girls started running as soon as the starting pistol fired.Although their speed couldn\u2019t be bracketed with that of the guys, their slim and gorgeous figures were the most wonderful scene for the guys on the stand.The fluttering black silky hair, the flying long and slim legs, the waving soft and tender arms, and the blushing cheeks; they were all showing the charm of sports.\u201cEh-hem!\u201d Two coughs sounded behind Hao Ren.Hao Ren looked back and saw Zhao Yanzi standing behind him; he didn\u2019t know when she came back.He moved a bit to the left, leaving some space for her. Then he asked, \u201cHow was it?\u201d\u201cNot that good! You seem so happy staring at the beautiful girls; your drools almost dripped down your mouth,\u201d Zhao Yanzi sat down and said in a jealous tone.Hao Ren then realized that he was so focused on looking at the race of the beautiful girls that he didn\u2019t even hear anything Xie Yujia had said. However, he was too embarrassed to ask her what she had said earlier.Though he can\u2019t be blamed. No guys would be able to stay calm while seeing so many beautiful girls. Didn\u2019t the other guys\u2019 eyeballs almost pop out?Obviously, Hao Ren wouldn\u2019t explain this to his \u201cfiancee\u201d. He pretended to look back seriously at Zhao Yanzi. He tried to say something but didn\u2019t end up saying a word.Actually, he really would like to know what Su Han and Zhao Yanzi talked about, but he couldn\u2019t ask because Xie Yujia was there.\u201cThe next event will be the 1500-meter race for men. All participants, please enter the field and get ready!\u201d The radio announcement on the field went off again.\u201cIt\u2019s your turn!\u201d Xie Yujia reminded Hao Ren.\u201cEh!\u201d Hao Ren stood up and was about to walk down from the stand.Xie Yujia grabbed him immediately and took out a number tag from her bag. \u201cHere, put it on!\u201dShe stood up and was going to put it on Hao Ren\u2019s chest, but she seemed to have remembered something. In the end, she just handed it to Hao Ren. \u201cPut it on yourself,\u201d she said.Hao Ren nodded, pulled off the plastic, and stuck the tag with the number eight onto his chest.\u201cAll participants, please enter the field\u2026\u201d The announcement continued on the radio.All of a sudden, Hao Ren felt a bit nervous.Xie Yujia gave him an encouraging smile, clenched her fist, and made a cheering gesture to him.Hao Ren smiled back at her as he took a deep breath and walked down the spectator stand.\u201cYou have to get the first place!\u201d Zhao Yanzi urged him.Hao Ren didn\u2019t look back. Instead, he waved his hand and walked to the track firmly.No matter if it were the first place or last, there wouldn\u2019t be any regrets as long as he tried his best. This was Hao Ren belief ever since elementary and middle school. This also explained how Hao Ren could get to the finish line successfully when everyone else collapsed.Number eight corresponded with the most-outer track on the field. It was the most disadvantageous position for long distance races.Huang Xujie, dressed in golden sportswear, was doing some stretches; he didn\u2019t even have a number tag on him. Then, he walked towards Hao Ren.Hao Ren took a look at him but didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cGet in position\u2026\u201d The starter made his command.Hao Ren got ready as he got on all fours and stay on his knees with his butt on his heels.Huang Xujie was behind him. His position was on the second most-outer track; he was only half a meter away from Hao Ren.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSophmore, I\u2019ll let you know today what our difference is,\u201d he whispered to Hao Ren.Hao Ren looked over his shoulder slightly and saw Huang Xujie\u2019s golden Nike running shoes and tight leg muscles.\u201cReady! Set!\u201dBang!The starting pistol fired.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since runners would cut into the inner track as soon as they start in the 1500-meter races, Hao Ren had to do so. When he cut into the inner track, he was the second last while the runners who started from the tracks closer to the inner track were all running ahead of him.As for Huang Xujie, due to his superior explosiveness, he had successfully grabbed the leading position even though his starting point in the seventh track. The situation was such that Hao Ren had to overtake six of the seven runners before he could run against Huang Xujie and win the race. During the process, he had to make sure that he wouldn\u2019t be overtaken by those who he passed.On the spectator stand, Xie Yujia frowned slightly when she saw the disadvantageous starting point Hao Ren had taken. Zhao Yanzi was also staring at the race track anxiously as if she was concerned about Hao Ren\u2019s performance as well.Meanwhile, the eight runners had lined up on the inner track with Hao Ren close to the tail. He didn\u2019t look eager to overtake any runners, and the others were also content with their current positions as they reserved their strength and tried to pass others at the right time.Now, Huang Xujie was leading the race while the others followed closely. Just by looking at them, it seemed like they were training for a long-distance marathon.\u201cGo! Go! Huang Xujie! Go! Go! Huang Xujie!\u201dThe girls\u2019 cheers got louder.Some of them even rushed down from the stands and got into the field to cheer for Huang Xujie.Due to their large numbers, the volunteers responsible for maintaining order couldn\u2019t keep them all out and thus tolerated them as long as they didn\u2019t interfere with the race.As if they were watching a race car event, they formed a circle around the tracks as they cheered Huang Xujie on up close.After some consideration, Xie Yujia also got down from the stand and walked into the field to cheer for Hao Ren.By now, the runners had finished one lap which was 400 meters. They began to show some fatigue as their steps were not as swift as they had been at the beginning of the race.The competition for stamina had begun.Hao Ren was the first to start overtaking his competitors.From his original seventh position, he overtook two runners in one go.\u201cKeep it up!\u201d Standing by the field, Xie Yujia raised both of her hands to cheer for him.Hao Ren\u2019s overtaking didn\u2019t attract much attention since he was still at the rear end of the line. More attention was focused on the repeated passing between the second-place and the third-place runners.Huang Xujie, on the other hand, was now so far ahead of everyone that no one could threaten his leading position.After overtaking two runners, Hao Ren steadied his pace and adjusted his breathing before speeding up and passing another runner.The former fourth-place runner purposefully stepped to the right as he tried to block Hao Ren\u2019s path. However, Hao Ren easily dodged his blocking and successfully overtook him!Xie Yujia was amazed at his smooth movements.Sitting on the stand, Zhao Yanzi\u2019s eyes lit up as well since Hao Ren\u2019s movement contained the steps of life and death originating from the Eight Trigrams. It was not a movement that he had learned and copied; it was natural.\u201cIs it possible that he had unintentionally reached the first level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll and understood the makeup of the world?\u201d Zhao Yanzi wondered.She wanted to go down to the field and take a closer look, but she gave up on the idea knowing that she wouldn\u2019t see much due to her small size. Resigned, she stayed on the stand.After taking the fourth place, Hao Ren gradually gained speed and moved closer to the second-place and third-place runners who had been repeatedly overtaking each other.Now people\u2019s attention finally turned to Hao Ren.On the stand, Zhao Jiayi and the guys had been concerned with the race since the beginning. They were actually worried because of the bets they made.Seeing Hao Ren overtook runners before him one by one, Zhao Jiayi grinned with joy since most of the guys in the class had bet on Hao Ren ending with either the last place, the second last place, or the sixth-place. If Hao Ren won the fourth place, he the banker would be rich with all the gains.\u201cIt\u2019s no use. He is running fast now, but he will be passed later,\u201d Yu Rong who had bet 100-yuan on Hao Ren getting the second last place said firmly.\u201cYeah, if he doesn\u2019t save his energy, he won\u2019t keep his place on the last lap.\u201d The others agreed with him.\u201cHao Ren, good boy! You could take the fourth place in this highly competitive Athletic Games. Even though you are only temporarily fourth, it is a great achievement,\u201d Zhao Jiayi thought to himself.Zhao Jiayi knew how great the runners competing on the tracks were. He was even familiar with some of them as he had played basketball with them; they were either local municipal champions or got placed first or second in provincial races. If the gamblers on the stands had been on the track racing against them, they would have been left behind by at least more than half a lap now. That was why Hao Ren\u2019s fourth position was a great feat.Zhao Jiayi caught a glimpse of Xie Yujia who had been rooting for Hao Ren while jogging along with him. Gazing at Xie Yujia\u2019s vibrant and young figure, Zhao Jiayi lamented silently at Hao Ren\u2019s luck for having such the support and encouragement of such a beauty.Thud! Thud!Hao Ren\u2019s feet stepped firmly on the synthetic tracks while his arms swung rhythmically.His steps looked heavy, but a fresh breeze went with him when he passed by the speculators. After Hao Ren took the fourth position, the students both on the stands and around the field began to notice the normal number eight runner. With a red face, he had been advancing steadily without showing too much fatigue.\u201cWho is this guy\u2026\u201d\u201cIs he from the Mechatronic Engineering Major?\u201d\u201cHe was taking the rear at the beginning of the race\u2026\u201dPeople began to talk about Hao Ren because they found that this runner with the number eight tag on his chest was running steadily and even speeding up slowly while others began to slow down.Xie Yujia watched Hao Ren as he passed the curve in front of her and saw the drops of sweat on Hao Ren\u2019s face clearly. She was touched by his decisive expression.He looked at the ground ahead of him and was oblivious to the fact that many pretty girls were cheering on Huang Xujie.Xie Yujia felt an extraordinary attraction while she looked at his earnest and persistent expression. Just a moment ago when the girls were competing, Hao Ren looked like every other guy around as he watched the performance of the pretty girls on the tracks enthusiastically.However, when real responsibility fell on his shoulders\u2026Sweat dripped down from his chin. Some of it soaked his shirt while the rest dropped onto the track and shattered in pieces before sinking into the ground.While the other girls were still cheering for Huang Xujie due to his handsome face and dashing figure, Xie Yujia was attracted to Hao Ren.On the spectator stand, Zhao Yanzi had her eyes locked on Hao Ren and gradually understood his movement. Each of Hao Ren\u2019s steps seemed to contain Daoist principles and thus were extraordinarily steady and firm. A unique aura seemed to have surrounded him while nature\u2019s essence flowed through him; his aura was gradually transforming because of all this.Zhao Yanzi couldn\u2019t get to the bottom of it. She wished Su Han had been here since she would have been able to tell her what level Hao Ren was on.She didn\u2019t realize that the most important thing for cultivation was the one-mindedness between one\u2019s mind and one\u2019s spirit; Hao Ren did much better than her in this field.On the rooftop of the stadium nearby, Su Han in a blue dress stood against the blue sky and watched the race intently. She nodded with appreciation and soon disappeared with a flash.While the second-place and the third-place runners were still trying to overtake each other, like a floating ghost, Hao Ren passed both of them with ease.They were astonished and tried to overtake him, but Hao Ren just left them in the dust!In their panic, they didn\u2019t notice Hao Ren\u2019s light steps. His steps were silent, and his breathing was quiet. It felt like he was talking a walk! It was impossible for the other runners to race against him. It seemed like he was flying!\u201cNo way!\u201d In the spectator stand designated to Hao Ren\u2019s class, all the guys stood up as they were stunned.In the blink of an eye, Hao Ren\u2019s ranking had turned from the original seventh to second!No one knew how it happened even though Hao Ren had overtaken his rivals one after another before their eyes!Hearing the crowd\u2019s gasps of astonishment, Huang Xujie who had been leading with ease turned his head. He found in shock that the second-placed runner was gaining on him!This second-placed runner was no other than the 'sophomore\u201d whom he regarded with disdain.Distracted, he stumbled and almost fell. This precarious movement caused a wave of alarming shrieks among the girls.Huang Xujie didn\u2019t regard the shrieks as the girls\u2019 concern for him. Instead, he was humiliated by the sound. He gritted his teeth and was determined to not allow Hao Ren to go near him.Huang Xujie sped up abruptly, and the girls\u2019 cheering got louder with his acceleration.\u201cGo! Go! Huang Xujie!\u201d A crisp voice appeared among the others.Hao Ren turned his head slightly and saw the so-called most popular girl of the university Lin Li cheering for Huang Xujie beside the track.\u201cDamn it! The woman is so blatant!\u201d Zhao Jiayi stood up in fury when he saw Lin Li cheering for Huang Xujie.Even though Lin Li was not in their class, she was in the same major and as Zhao Jiayi and Hao Ren. Zhao Jiayi would understand if Lin Li didn\u2019t cheer Hao Ren on since they weren\u2019t in the same class, but Lin Li was now cheering for Huang Xujie who was Hao Ren\u2019s competitor from another major! This was unacceptable to Zhao Jiayi.In fact, the other guys from Hao Ren\u2019s class and some of the guys from Class Three were also enraged. After all, it was ok for one to not participate in the events, but one must guard one\u2019s major\u2019s honor.On the track, Huang Xujie thought he had pulled away from Hao Ren and relaxed a bit. However, when he looked back, he found that Hao Ren was catching up again steadily.He sped up again. When he looked back, Hao Ren was still gaining on him at a steady pace.\u201cThis guys is like a sticky candy\u2026 Last time when I watched him practice at night, he didn\u2019t look like he could be my rival\u2026\u201dHuang Xujie felt threatened for the first time. He turned his head around to glance at Hao Ren, and he found his rival looking calm and breathing evenly. His rival was running with perfect form!\u201cIs it possible that he doesn\u2019t even regard me as his rival? Is he just trying to surpass himself? Is it possible that in his eyes, I\u2019m nothing?\u201dThese thoughts suddenly occurred to Huang Xujie.Seeing Hao Ren making gains on him step by step, Huang Xujie who had his eye on the first-place immediately regulated his breathing and sped up.Seeing the distance between Huang Xujie and Hao Ren gradually got shorter, Lin Li who was wearing a miniskirt cheered for Huang Xujie again.Xie Yujia happened to be standing near her, and she got angrier while she watched. She bumped the excited Lin Li in the waist with her elbow intentionally.\u201cOuch!\u201d Lin Li frowned as she put her hand on her waist and turned angrily to the person beside her.When she saw it was Xie Yujia, the Class President of Class Two, her arrogance abated a bit instantly. She glared at Xie Yujia unpleasantly.\u201cSorry.\u201d Xie Yujia apologized insincerely before bringing her palms around her mouth to form the shape of a trumpet, \u201cGo! Go! Hao Ren!\u201d She shouted.Lin Li gritted her white teeth while she glared at Xie Yujia. However, she didn\u2019t dare to release her anger. She knew about Xie Yujia\u2019s great reputation at the university; Xie Yujia was even on good terms with those tough figures.Since Xie Yujia was cheering loudly for Hao Ren, Lin Li was ashamed of herself and didn\u2019t continue cheering for Huang Xujie anymore.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs the race went on, the distances between the runners were getting bigger. The last-place runner lagged behind the first-place runner by about half a lap, and competition for higher placements was still fierce.Hao Ren and Huang Xujie were in the lead; the third-place runner was well behind them while the fourth-place runner could overtake the third-place runner at any minute.As to the rest of the contestants, they couldn\u2019t engage the audience\u2019s attention.On the spectator stand, Ling turned to Zhao Yanzi abruptly and complemented, \u201cZi, your \u2018uncle\u2019 is quite amazing at long-distance races.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Zhao Yanzi pursed her lips with pride.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The match between Hao Ren and Huang Xujie for first-place had undoubtedly become the focus of the audience.The 1500-meter race had not been under the spotlight until Huang Xujie entered the race; the girls had been eagerly anticipating the event. While Hao Ren gradually gained on Huang Xujie and threatened his leading position, the guys in the spectator stand all put down the cards they had been playing and began to watch the race carefully.For them, it was quite refreshing when someone could threaten Huang Xujie\u2019s position as the \u201cPermanent Champion\u201d. Apart from the issue of strengths, it would be a disgrace to Huang Xujie if someone could take the first place from him. What a sensation it would cause!Huang Xujie\u2019s breathing became short, and his steps got heavier. As a veteran athlete, he had regarded the champion of the 1500-meter race as something that was already in his bag. But now, some unknown guy was catching up to him; it was like a loud slap to his face!Naturally, East Ocean University was full of people with unusual abilities and Huang Xujie was only one of them.On the other hand, Hao Ren had a firm look on his face, and his steps remained steady. When he passed the start line, he glanced at the sign on the side of the tracks: 1.There was only one lap left.On the spectator stands, all the guys standing beside Zhao Jiayi were stunned. They had not expected that Hao Ren could reach second-place and could even maintain his placement for so long. In other words, as long as Hao Ren didn\u2019t make any mistakes, he would surely get the third-place even if his stamina ran out on him later.None of them had betted that Hao Ren would enter the top three! Standing among them, Zhao Jiayi had a huge grin on his face since no one winning meant that him the banker was the real winner!\u201cHao Ren, drink some water!\u201d Xie Yujia dashed along with Hao Ren by the side of the track as she handed him a bottle of water with its cap removed.Glancing at her gratefully, Hao Ren took some gulps as he continued running. Afterward, he handed the bottle back to Xie Yujia.A girl followed suit and handed a bottle of water to Huang Xujie a few meters in front of Hao RenSurprisingly, Huang Xujie pushed away the girl\u2019s arm, and the water spilled all over the track as the bottle fell to the ground.This ungracious act showed Huang Xujie\u2019s fury.\u201cGo! Uncle!\u201d Sitting on the spectator stand, Zhao Yanzi shouted abruptly.Hao Ren glanced up at her and gave her a gesture of victory.Then, with his eyes glued to track in front of him, his body tilted slightly forward while his heels continued to step onto the ground. With a snap, he shot forward like a bullet!Sprint! He was sprinting!Everyone was screaming in their heads.He began to sprint with one whole lap left; it was 400 meters away from the finish line!Seeing the astonished faces around him, Huang Xujie in the leading position involuntarily looked back. When he saw Hao Ren sprinting toward him like a rocket, he hurriedly moved to the right as he tried to block him.Hao Ren didn\u2019t slow down! Running close to the inner track, he leaped into the air lightly and passed Huang Xujie through the gap on his left side.It was like a move from the hurdle race and a breakthrough in a soccer game.Huang Xujie\u2019s heart sank. When he tried to block again, Hao Ren had overtaken him!It was the first time in his whole life that he was overtaken by someone with such arrogance and ease!He felt like Hao Ren showed him the ultimate contempt.\u201cBut he will regret sprinting so early\u2026\u201d Gazing at Hao Ren who was moving fast away from him, Huang Xujie thought to himself with resentment.\u201cGo! Ren!\u201dOn the spectator stand, Zhao Jiayi abruptly stood up and shouted. From the morning until the afternoon, he had been playing cards with Zhou Liren and some others and didn\u2019t pay much attention to the events. It was his first cheer of the day.\u201cGo! Ren!\u201d Zhou Liren and Cao Ronghua joined him.One after another, Yu Rong, Gu Jiadong, Chen Ke, Huang Jianfeng, and other classmates who were close to Hao Ren began to cheer for him.Their cheering drew the attention of other classmates, and they all stood up and cheered loudly.Their high spirits spread to other classes. From the neighboring Class Three to Class One to Class Four\u2026 Soon, all the students from the Mechatronics Engineering Major began to cheer for Hao Ren.Then, the spirits spread to the other majors. Soon, the entire Engineering Faculty began to cheer for Hao Ren.\u201cGo! Go! Ren!\u201d The cheering resonated across the whole field, and the voices got louder and more distinct.Their faculty had the highest percentage of guys, and their collective cheering was a magnificent sight.Meanwhile, the cheering for Huang Xujie from the girls was shattered as if small waves were hit by the tsunami.Hearing the deafening cheers, Huang Xujie panicked for the first time. He even found that the guys from the other faculties were cheering for the 'sophomore\u201d!\u201cYou all want me to lose?!\u201d A wave of fury surged in Huang Xujie mind, and the fury was a source of new-found energy as it allowed him to sprint forward!On the tracks, the first two runners continued to sprint as if they were in a 100-meter dash.They sprinted forward with all their strength as the finish line was still 300 meters away.Hearing the deafening uniformed cheering, Hao Ren felt a strength surging in his body. Stepping hard on the ground, he began to speed up!Huang Xuejie who was also sprinting got left in the dust as he saw Ren run away at an insane speed; he knew he would never catch up.Despair engulfed him. He had regarded his opponent with contempt, yet this opponent had easily overtaken him and create a distance of more than 20 meters between them.When Hao Ren was almost at the finish line, he looked back to see if Huang Xujie was right behind him.This subconscious behavior was noted by most of the people in the audience.\u201cSo arrogant. He even looked back when he sprinted across the finish line.\u201d\u201cDamn! It was a blatant taunt\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt was an easy win\u2026\u201dOf course, Hao Ren didn\u2019t hear those comments. When he saw Huang Xujie was still far behind him, he relaxed before sprinting across the finish line.Huang Xujie also reached the finish line three seconds later.One of his buddies tried to drape a jacket over his shoulders but was pushed away by him forcefully. With a pair of red eyes, Huang Xujie dragged his exhausted body to the locker room without looking back. He wasn\u2019t even planning to attend the award ceremony.On the rostrum, Lu Qing, the vice president of the university, slouched on a chair with a cup of tea in his hand. He grinned while his gaze followed Hao Ren who was walking towards Xie Yujia as soon as he won the race.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedA simple awards podium was built in the middle of the field. Hao Ren and the third-place runner walked onto it successively, but Huang Xujie couldn\u2019t be found by the organizers.The broadcaster had no choice but to announce that Huang Xujie was injured and won\u2019t participate in the awards ceremony. The girls in and out of the field murmured among themselves with concern. The fact was, they didn\u2019t care if Huang Xujie won the first-place in the competition or not; all they wanted was for him to continued to be handsome and cool.Despite the vacancy on the awards podium, the awards ceremony went on, and Gu Jialing, the Student Council President, presented the Certificates of Merit to Hao Ren and the third-place runner.The certificates were just a symbol while the most attractive part of the awards was that the champion of each event would get 1,000 yuan in cash, second place would get 500 yuan, and third place would get 250 yuan.The prize money was set up to encourage participation in the competitions. Of course, people like Zhou Liren who knew they were weak would never enter the competitions just for the money.While Hao Ren was receiving the Certificate of Merit and prize money, Zhao Jiayi was busy collecting his money.\u201cHurry! Hurry! Hand me the money you lost in the bet!\u201d He waved the paper written with records of the bets, \u201cYu Rong, 200! Chen Ke, 300! And don\u2019t run, Zhou Liren! You owe me 200, too!\u201dThose guys were both pleased and reluctant. On the one hand, they were surprised and happy that Hao Ren had won first place; on the other hand, they scolded themselves for underestimating his strength.With the certificate and prize money in hand, Hao Ren walked back to the stand while talking to Xie Yujia. He looked for Zhao Yanzi and Ling, but found that they were gone.\u201cZhao Jiayi! Where are the girls who were sitting here?\u201d Hao Ren raised his head and asked Zhao Jiayi who was busy collecting money.\u201cOh, they left after you crossed the finish line,\u201d Zhao Jiayi answered.Well\u2026 Hao Ren was a little disappointed.But he soon rallied and shouted at Zhao Jiayi, \u201cI won the prize money! I will treat you all to dinner tonight!\u201d\u201cForget it!\u201d Zhou Liren, who had lost 200 yuan, shouted sulkily, \u201cZhao Jiayi has won much more than you! Dinner is on him!\u201dHearing Zhou Liren\u2019s suggestion, the other guys who had lost yelled in agreement, \u201cYeah! It\u2019s on Zhao Jiayi!\u201dZhao Jiayi was never a stingy person; on the contrary, he was the most generous one among the group. He laughed. \u201cOk! Tonight, let\u2019s go eat something fancy! I will spend all my winnings to celebrate Hao Ren\u2019s victory!\u201dThe others all agreed. After all, they were proud that Hao Ren won the race, and none of them minded their small losses. Xie Yujia smiled with joy at the friendship among the guys.\u201cClass President, you come with us too!\u201d Zhao Jiayi shouted.\u201cUh?\u201d Xie Yujia was surprised, \u201cDon\u2019t count me in. You guys have a good celebration!\u201d\u201cCome on! Come on!\u201d Zhao Jiayi coaxed her with enthusiasm while the other guys shouted in agreements.Xie Yujia blushed. \u201cOk, I will join your celebration. But\u2026 you must invite the girls in the class as well.\u201dShe wouldn\u2019t find it awkward if she weren\u2019t the only girl among them.They only had six girls in the class, so Zhao Jiayi waved his hand grandly and shouted, \u201cOk! I invite all of them!\u201d\u201cThe next event is the Aerobics Competition. All the contestants, please enter the field as soon as possible!\u201d The broadcaster announced the next competition.At the announcement, the boisterous guys suddenly became quiet while their eyes lit up. Then, they howled with delight.\u201cWell\u2026 these guys\u2026\u201d Xie Yujia sighed with helplessness and sat down. Of course, she knew what was on the guys\u2019 minds. They faked interest in the Aerobics Competition while they focused their attention on the girls who were competing.Hao Ren sat down. He moved a bit closer to Xie Yujia, \u201cUrm, Class President, I want to donate my 1,000 yuan prize money to the class. I planned to spend it on the dinner, but now that I don\u2019t have to pay for it\u2026\u201dStaring at Hao Ren, Xie Yujia interrupted him, \u201cWhy donate it? You won it! Besides, you won honor for the class and the department. You deserve it!\u201dHao Ren froze a little looking at her serious expression. \u201cOk, then I will keep it,\u201d he said.In fact, he felt he owed a lot to Xie Yujia for his win, and donating the prize money to the class was his way of expressing his gratitude.Meanwhile, Xie Yujia looked away from Hao Ren and thought, \u201cHao Ren is indeed different from the other guys. He is neither greedy nor dirty-minded\u2026\u201dHer heart fluttered. But when she turned to Hao Ren again, she found him staring at the first aerobic contestant from the Management Department entering the field. His mouth was slightly open, and his eyes lit up.\u201cWell, forget it\u2026\u201d Xie Yujia was speechless.The Aerobic Competition was the last event. Pretty girls with great figures selected from each major leaped and swayed with the music. It was a pretty sight.This wise schedule had successfully kept a majority of the guys to the end of the whole competition. The competition ended with the announcement of the results of the unity prizes for each department. They were given by the school\u2019s management team according to the overall performance of each major in the competitions.The students on the stands left one after another.Zhao Jiayi sent out his invitations and led everyone to a BBQ restaurant.Except for the two girls who couldn\u2019t make it, four girls, including Xie Yujia, joined the 20 plus guys. When they entered the restaurant, they almost took up half of the small establishment.Hao Ren\u2019s victory in the long-distance race was unexpected but worthy of celebrating. To award Hao Ren, who was today\u2019s hero, Zhao Jiayi arranged Xie Yujia, the pink-faced beautiful Class President, to sit next to him.Hao Ren tried to stop them while he kept apologizing to Xie Yujia. Fortunately, Xie Yujia knew their ways; she pouted with helplessness but was not angry.Beer, roasted meat, and pretty girls\u2026 All these raised the guys\u2019 adrenaline levels. They clinked their beer mugs repeatedly, and half of the BBQ restaurant became their venue of revelry.Under the persuasion of the naive-looking Cao Ronghua, Xie Yujia drank several glasses of beer. Sitting next to Hao Ren, her face was deep pink, and she looked sweet and bright like an apple.As for Hao Ren, they didn\u2019t go easy on him. Almost everyone came over to drink with him. Although it was only beer, Hao Ren began to feel the effects of the indulgent drinking.The scene looked more like a wedding feast just before the wedding night than a celebration for Hao Ren\u2019s victory.Half drunk, Hao Ren wanted to send a message to Zhao Yanzi to ask her if her trip back to school was safe and was she home yet. However, when he dug out his mobile phone, he suddenly remembered that he didn\u2019t have Zhao Yanzi\u2019s number. He patted himself on the head and lamented about his drunkenness.\u201cHey! You are too loud!\u201dA harsh voice cut into their boisterous conversations with a loud bang on the table at the other end of the room.Zhao Jiayi and others stopped talking and looked toward that direction.A brawny guy with a crew cut was glaring at them while holding a glass of beer in his hand.\u201cThis is a public place. If you find it noisy, you can go to another place,\u201d Zhao Jiayi turned to the guy and retorted.As the leader of the dorm, Zhao Jiayi had always put Hao Ren under his protection. When he was in middle school, he had been a big gun at his school and never had to back off from anyone.\u201cSophomores, right?\u201d that guy looked at Zhao Jiayi as he stood up.When he stood up, the people in the room saw his unusual height. Almost six feet four inches tall, he was one head taller than Zhao Jiayi!Sensing a fight was in the air, Xie Yujia stood up immediately and called out with her Class President tone, \u201cZhao Jiayi, come back! Ignore him!\u201dHowever, Zhao Jiayi\u2019s motto was to never back off. He stared back at that guy without fear.The other guys eating with the tall guy abruptly stood up. Each of them was at least 6 feet tall, and they looked like a group of aggressive mountains when they stood together.Fearing for Zhao Jiayi\u2019s safety, the usually timid Zhou Liren, who was the tallest of the guys, rushed over and stood next to Zhao Jiayi.Then, the other guys in Hao Ren\u2019s class walked over and stood on both sides of Zhao Jiayi. Hao Ren was about to go as well, but Xie Yujia caught him with a firm grip.Zhao Jiayi\u2019s group had no advantage in height, but their number was four times of their opponents\u2019. If the fight broke out, the worst result would be heavy losses for both parties.Sensing that a fight was about to break out, Xie Yujia screamed, \u201cCome back here! Don\u2019t fight!\u201dBut at that moment, who would care about her opinion?\u201cYou! Are you a bad-*ss?\u201d the biggest guy with the crew cut suddenly pointed at Hao Ren who was held back by Xie Yujia.Xie Yujia stared at that guy in astonishment and realized they were here to cause trouble for Hao Ren. She searched her brain and abruptly remembered that this guy was Bai Zhixiong, a fourth-year student and the Deputy Captain of the university\u2019s basketball team. He was also one of Huang Xujie\u2019s good friends.\u201cAre you here to mess with Ren?\u201d while Xie Yujia racked her brains for a solution, Zhao Jiayi saw the real intention as he asked that guy directly.Although the guys in the Mechatronics Engineering Department were a group of otakus, they stuck with each other when needed. They always teased Hao Ren, but they would never allow anyone to bully him. Never!\u201cZhao Jiayi, they are here for me.\u201d when Xie Yujia\u2019s grip on his arm slackened a bit, Hao Ren escaped her grasp and strode over.He didn\u2019t want Zhao Jiayi and his other buddies to get hurt because of him. Since they came for him, he had no reasons to hide.The big guy had planned to intimidate Hao Ren and didn\u2019t expect the ordinary-looking Hao Ren to have the guts to face him. The speech he had prepared for this occasion was now useless. He stared at Hao Ren blankly, trying to find a way out.At his silence, Hao Ren walked up to him and said, \u201cIf you think we are younger than you and would be good targets for bullying, you are mistaken. As seniors, you have nothing to be proud of. Huang Xujie does excel in some areas, but he is too full of himself! He overestimated himself, and that is why he lost to me.\u201d\u201cYou are indeed arrogant,\u201d Bai Zhixiong looked down at Hao Ren and said.Hao Ren shook his head and sighed, \u201cThis is not arrogance. I\u2019m trying to reason with you. You don\u2019t like me, just like how I don\u2019t like you. However, I didn\u2019t randomly mess with you, but you think you can mess with us just because you are seniors.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no use reasoning with them. They messed with us; let\u2019s fight with them!\u201d Zhao Jiayi shouted from the side. He had never liked these self-important guys who preyed on the weak. He was especially displeased with them since they had repeatedly taken the basketball court away from him and his friends.Swoosh\u2026Suddenly, a brown basketball flew in from the outside.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe ball swept over Zhao Jiayi\u2019s head and smashed into Bai Zhixiong\u2019s face.As strong as Bai Zhixiong was, he couldn\u2019t withstand the sneak-attack of the basketball, and blood flowed from his nose.\u201cWho the f*ck told you to come out? Get your *sses back to the gym!\u201d a thundering shout exploded from the outside of the door.Hao Ren turned and saw a huge figure block the entire doorway.\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d an inaudible word jumped out of Xie Yujia\u2019s mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, he shivered at the voice from the outside and looked very obedient.Likewise, the other members of the basketball team all looked nervous.With their heads lowered, they filed out of the restaurant silently. Each of them was slapped on the back of the head by the man waiting at the door. He struck Bai Zhixiong with greater force and sent him stumbling several steps forward. However, the six feet four inches tall Bai Zhixiong dared not to utter a word of complaint.Looking at the magnificent and big body standing at the door, Hao Ren and his buddies couldn\u2019t help but wonder about the man\u2019s great strength. Especially since he could hold this group of big guys in the basketball team in check.\u201cGet your *sses back to training!\u201d With another shout, the mysterious man escorted the basketball team members to the university, giving the people in the restaurant a magnificent broad back to look at. This man was even half a head taller than Bai Zhixiong!\u201cHe should be Xie Wanjun, the captain of the basketball team. Only he can keep those guys on the basketball team in control,\u201d Yu Rong, who was familiar with the situation at school, said.From the start to the end of the incident, Hao Ren had never gotten a glimpse of Xie Wanjun\u2019s face; this man was taller than the door when he was standing on the outside, and Hao Ren only got a glimpse of his back when he left.\u201cOk, ok! Let\u2019s get back to our dinner!\u201d Hao Ren cleared his head and called out to the others.With an awkward smile on her face, Xie Yujia joined his efforts.However, their spirits were dampened by the interruption.\u201cYour victory over Huang Xujie disgraced him. His friends will probably make more trouble for you. Be careful.\u201dAt Hao Ren\u2019s silence, Xie Yujia continued, \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to worry. At most, they will just do something to make you uncomfortable. They won\u2019t do anything outrageous.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not worried. They are making trouble out of nothing. And it\u2019s not the first time the seniors bullied juniors in the school. They took basketball courts from Zhao Jiayi and his friends several times, and he had been wanting to summon some of his buddies to fight them,\u201d Hao Ren said.Xie Yujia sighed, \u201cYou\u2019d better not fight, or the school would punish you.\u201dShe thought about talking to her older brother and asking him to tighten his control on the guys on the basketball team. However, she knew it would be little use since it couldn\u2019t eliminate bullying in the school as it was almost a part of the norms in the school. Besides, Huang Xujie, son of the deputy mayor of the city, set up the popular Rock Climbing Club and was close to the other sports clubs in the school. He was especially close with the players on the basketball team, who were the unrivaled tough guys in school.The basketball team of East Ocean University was well-known all over the country, and it was last year\u2019s champion of National College League, bringing great honor to East Ocean University. That was why the school treasured them despite their terrible academic performances. They triumphed over all the other ordinary students in strength, and more importantly, they had the school behind their backs as long as they didn\u2019t do things that were outrages.Due to his close relationship with them, Hua Xujie could almost do whatever he wanted.Anyway, Hao Ren humiliated Huang Xujie by winning the race, and the latter would make trouble for him. Xie Yujia was a bit concerned about this.While Xie Yujia was troubled with all these concerns, Hao Ren was thinking about something else. He wasn\u2019t too concerned about Huang Xujie\u2019s retaliation, even though the latter was the son of the deputy mayor.What concerned him was the deep resentment between the so-called celebrity students and the regular students in the junior years. Zhao Jiayi and his buddies were repeatedly driven away from the basketball court by the members of the Rock Climbing Club and some players of the basketball team. This was just one example of the bullying happening on campus. If the situation continued, a huge fight would break out sooner or later.If a fight broke out, no one would be the winner, especially the weaker ones like Zhao Jiayi. Hao Ren knew Zhao Jiayi had been contacting his buddies and was prepared to fight with those seniors from the Rock Climbing Club and the basketball team if they kept up the bullying.Hao Ren wondered if it was time for him to dig out Lu Qing\u2019s card and have a pleasant conversation with the vice president of the university.The party ended in low spirits half another later. Zhao Jiayi returned to the dorm in a bad mood. If Hao Ren didn\u2019t persuade him, he would have summoned his buddies to go after those guys tonight.\u201cRen, if they dare to make trouble for you, give me a call!\u201d Zhao Jiayi patted his chest and said.Hao Ren smiled and replied, \u201cI will be fine. They were just bluffing. They won\u2019t do anything serious.\u201dIn this dorm, Zhao Jiayi was the big brother. Zhao Jiayi had many friends from all circles, so he felt like he should look after his roommates.However, he would never have guessed that Hao Ren had the school\u2019s vice president Lu Qing behind him. In fact, in the so-called Dragon Tribe, Lu Qing must respect Hao Ren and refer to him as \u201d Fuma 1 \u201c.Even without Lu Qing behind him, Hao Ren wasn\u2019t afraid of Huang Xujie. He had always kept a low-profile because he didn\u2019t like to attract attention to himself, but he wasn\u2019t scared by trouble.The eventful day ended. The next day, everything returned to normal at school while some people still talked about what happened the day before.In class, Hao Ren immersed himself in preparing middle school English practice questions. Knowing Hao Ren was tutoring the little girl in the evening, Zhou Liren left him alone.The glory of the long-distance race champion was now just a memory. Hao Ren put the 1,000 yuan prize money into the shared fund\u2019s box of the dorm room; it would be used for Room 302\u2019s future entertainment activities.To Hao Ren, only those self-important guys would care about such vanities and the girls\u2019 screams. He did his best in the race because he entered his name into it and wanted to repay Xie Yujia for her encouragement.The sky turned dark in the evening. Hao Ren rode Bus 767 and arrived on time at Zhao Yanzi\u2019s home, a two-story house.For some unknown reason, after having eaten food cooked by Zi\u2019s mother, Hao Ren\u2019s mouth would water each time he was on his way to Zi\u2019s home to tutor her. Since yesterday was Monday and he didn\u2019t come to tutor Zhao Yanzi, he was suddenly struck by a longing for the delicious dishes cooked by Zhao Hongyu when he was standing at the door.With papers in hand, Hao Ren pressed on the doorbell.Suddenly, thunder resonated in the sky, and a storm came instantly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA downpour commenced. Standing at the door, Hao Ren was half soaked in the blink of an eye.\u201cWell, hurry in!\u201d hearing the doorbell ring, Zhao Hongyu hurried over to answer it. Seeing Hao Ren getting soaked in the rain, she drew him in immediately.Boom! Boom\u2026 With another string of thunder, dashes of lightning flashed across the sky outside the windows.Very soon, the high buildings in the distance were engulfed by the white downpour.Hao Ren put down his papers while he shook his head to get rid of the water in his hair. Zhao Hongyu handed him a white towel and told him in a light tone, \u201cYou can stay here tonight. Today, Elder Sun is responsible for the rainfall, and it shall last the entire night.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although Zhao Guang seemed like a stern father, he showed how much he loved his daughter by going in person to pick her up from school on such a rainy day when he was a busy man.Zhao Hongyu walked over after her husband entered. \u201cSince there\u2019s a storm today, I think Ren should stay over instead of going back in the rain,\u201d she said.\u201cOk, it should be Elder Sun\u2019s rain so it will probably last all night. It will be difficult even to drive him back. It\u2019s best for him to stay here,\u201d Zhao Guang nodded without hesitation.Hao Ren was too shy to express his opinion after both of them told him to stay. He wouldn\u2019t want to insist on leaving as they were both persistent in keeping him there. Zhao Guang would for sure give him a ride back if he insisted. However, Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to cause him so much trouble on a stormy night like this.Zhao Hongyu smiled pleasantly as she saw no objections from Hao Ren. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s have dinner first since it is ready. Zhao Guang, grab some dry clothes for Ren. He got all soaked on the way here to tutor Zi. And go wash your hands, Zi!\u201d she said.\u201cOk.\u201d Zhao Guang nodded calmly and went upstairs to get some clothes.Zhao Yanzi stared at Hao Ren grudgingly from where she was standing as if she wasn\u2019t happy about her own turf being invaded. She still hadn\u2019t gotten used to the fact that her parents were treating Hao Ren as a part of the family. She could still endure it when they took him on the family trip, but now keeping him for the night? Who would know what was going to happen next time?Little girls were pretty territorial at this age as they even drew lines across the shared desks at school to mark their territories.Hao Ren completely ignored her stare. He never regarded her as his fianc\u00e9e. On the other hand, he only hoped for her English grade to pick up; if that happened, he wouldn\u2019t disappoint her parents who had been treating him so nicely.Soon, Zhao Guang walked downstairs with a set of grey plaid pajamas and handed it over to Hao Ren. \u201cGo get out of your wet jacket first,\u201d he said.\u201cThank you!\u201d Hao Ren took the pajamas and put it on after taking off his own jacket.It was a bit large for Hao Ren, but it somehow fit.The four of them washed their hands and sat down for dinner. Hao Ren forgot about all the unpleasantness when he saw the delicious dishes on the table. Thinking back, it had been several days since Hao Ren enjoyed Zhao Hongyu\u2019s cooking.\u201cHow lucky is Zhao Yanzi to have such a wonderful mother who was loving, caring, intelligent, and beautiful,\u201d he thought.\u201cRen, has Zi shown any improvements in her English tests lately?\u201d Zhao Hongyu suddenly asked about Zhao Yanzi\u2019s school work while they were having dinner.Zhao Yanzi looked up at Hao Ren nervously when she heard the question.\u201cThere are some improvements. It seems like she is doing better than before,\u201d Hao Ren didn\u2019t answer directly. As a matter of fact, only Zhao Yanzi herself knew how bad her English was.\u201cUm\u2026take it slow. Has she been doing well in school?\u201d Zhao Hongyu continued to ask.Hao Ren was stunned for a moment as he thought she was asking about the time when Zhao Yanzi skipped class. He tried to think of a reasonable response but didn\u2019t know how to answer.Zhao Yanzi was trying her best to send him signals. She held onto her chopsticks tightly and curled her lips, giving him a threatening look.\u201cOh, what I mean is, do you think she is putting more effort into studying English?\u201d Zhao Hongyu added.Hao Ren looked at Zhao Hongyu as he realized they didn\u2019t know about her skipping class yet. He was relieved and said, \u201cUm, the knowledge points have been enhanced. She has probably been paying more attention in class.\u201d\u201cUm, that\u2019s good,\u201d Zhao Hongyu nodded with a smile.Zhao Yanzi secretly breath out as she thought Hao Ren would tell on her. However, Zhao Guang caught all of her expressions. He kept on eating without getting involved in their conversation.\u201cNot only her English, but her other subjects also aren\u2019t that good,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said after a moment, \u201cMidterms are in a few days. I hope her grades get better by then. So, if it is not too much to ask, can you tutor her on other subjects too?\u201dHao Ren certainly couldn\u2019t reject the \u201cmother-in-law\u2019s\u201d request. He nodded and said, \u201cOk, I will try my best.\u201d\u201cEnglish is her weakest subject. You don\u2019t need to tutor her specifically on other subjects. Is it ok if she comes to you with questions she can\u2019t do?\u201d Zhao Hongyu asked softly.\u201cNo problem.\u201d Hao Ren said. Although he was stuck with an annoying little fianc\u00e9e, he couldn\u2019t complain about having such an understanding \u201cmother-in-law\u201d.\u201cWe love everything about Zi. It is only her attitude towards studying that bothers us. Her grades have always been one of the worst in her class, and we are always embarrassed when we attend the parent-teacher meeting,\u201d she said.\u201cSo that is why\u2026Zhao Hongyu doesn\u2019t want to be embarrassed as a parent. Even for the charming Zhao Hongyu, it was hard for her to be proud of her daughter when Zi has such bad grades,\u201d Hao Ren thought, \u201cHehe, even the Dragon Tribe suffers just like any other parents in the world.\u201dZi\u2019s little face blushed. Her lips pouted as she tried to defend herself, but she came up with nothing. Except for her excellent PE grades, she was amongst the worst students in all other subjects.\u201cSorry for the trouble,\u201d Zhao Hongyu apologized softly when she realized that she had been asking a lot of him.\u201cThat\u2019s ok,\u201d Hao Ren laughed. He would do his best to tutor Zhao Yanzi just for the sake of Zhao Hongyu.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euRelaxing classical music was being played in the room, and even the heavy rain couldn\u2019t disturb the cozy atmosphere. Zhao Guang had always been a man of few words as the head of the household. Zhao Hongyu, on the other hand, had a charming smile on her face as if she was satisfied with where life was headed.Zhao Yanzi frowned and pouted. She was probably coming up with ways to deal with Hao Ren\u2019s \u201cinvasion\u201d into her life.Time passed by quickly as dinner reached an end.\u201cYou can go help Zi with her school work in my studio after dinner. I\u2019ll go make the bed in her room so that you can rest well tonight,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said gently to Hao Ren.\u201cPhew\u2026!\u201d Hao Ren immediately spat out a mouthful of soup.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zi\u2019s bedroom is big enough. Besides, she also has her own washroom, and it\u2019s more convenient.\u201d\u201cMom!\u201d Zhao Yanzi whined in dissatisfaction. No guy had ever slept over in her bedroom before.Zhao Hongyu was about to say that Hao Ren wasn\u2019t a stranger, but Hao Ren wiped the soup from his lips and said voluntarily, \u201cZi is a girl after all. It\u2019s not convenient for me to sleep in her bedroom. How about I sleep in the living room?\u201dZhao Yanzi turned her head around and looked at Hao Ren without saying anything. She initially thought that this \u201cdirty\u201d uncle would seize the chance and sleep in her bedroom to make her feel uncomfortable.Hao Ren also had his own ideas. On the one hand, he didn\u2019t want to provoke Zhao Yanzi too much even with her parents\u2019 support. On the other hand, before they properly confirmed their relationship, he should still keep some distance from Zhao Yanzi. Otherwise, he might not be able to be able to get away from her if he wanted to in the future.Zhao Hongyu looked at them and said, \u201cThe first-floor living room is too cold. If you\u2019re not sleeping in Zi\u2019s bedroom, sleep in my studio in the attic upstairs. The room is a bit small, but it\u2019s still pretty warm.\u201d\u201cThat sounds good.\u201d Hao Ren nodded.\u201cBut Ren still has to take showers in your washroom,\u201d Zhao Hongyu turned around, looked at Zhao Yanzi, and said.Zhao Yanzi bit her lip in a grievance. \u201cFine,\u201d she murmured.She felt like her territory was being divided up and given to Hao Ren. Even her parents were leaning towards him. This made Zhao Yanzi feel conflicted. Before she made up her mind to \u201cmarry\u201d Hao Ren, any sort of contact without her consent was worth fighting for.This was her little pride, even though she sometimes thought Hao Ren wasn\u2019t that bad.Zhao Hongyu smiled sweetly to soften up the atmosphere. \u201cYou guys go up now since you have finished eating. Hao Ren is sleeping here tonight anyway, so we\u2019re not worried about the time either. Take a shower first, get comfortable, and help Zi with her school work.\u201dSeeing that Zhao Hongyu was about to stand up, Hao Ren hurried and stood up first as he grabbed some dishes and chopsticks. \u201cAuntie, let me help you clean up.\u201d\u201cHaha, it\u2019s fine! Let me do it! You go upstairs and take a shower first,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said gently.Hao Ren insisted for a bit but failed to persuade Zhao Hongyu. He could only thank her for treating him to dinner.After Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi went upstairs, Zhao Hongyu, who was cleaning the table, asked Zhao Guang, \u201cWhat do you think after this period of observation?\u201dZhao Guang nodded. \u201cHe has a good character, a calm personality, and he\u2019s also nice to Zi. Besides, there seemed to be a sign of him breaking through the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll. Just like what Elder Lu said, he is a smart and non-ostentatious kid,\u201d he said\u201cThen that means you officially approve of him. In fact, after interacting with him several times, I like him a lot as well,\u201d Zhao Hongyu stopped what she was doing and looked at Zhao Guang, \u201cAlso\u2026what are you planning to do with West Ocean?\u201d she asked.\u201cCounter soldiers with generals and cover water with soil(TL: a Chinese idiom which means there\u2019s always a solution to a problem). There\u2019s no use thinking about this now. We can only make Ren improve his strength as soon as possible,\u201d Zhao Guang\u2019s face turned solemn as he said calmly.On the second floor, Hao Ren held the materials for their tutoring session and entered Zhao Yanzi\u2019s bedroom as he smelled a light aroma.Despite the heavy rain outside, it didn\u2019t impact the silence of this small world. Hao Ren put down the materials and asked Zhao Yanzi, \u201cWhere\u2019s the washroom?\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Zhao Yanzi turned her head and didn\u2019t answer him.\u201cI haven\u2019t told your parents about you skipping school yesterday,\u201d Hao Ren looked at her and said indifferently.Upon hearing this, Zhao Yanzi\u2019s ears perked up right away, and her facial expression revealed her anxiousness, \u201cYou\u2026 How dare you!\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything I can\u2019t say. It was a fact that you skipped school,\u201d Hao Ren said again indifferently.\u201cThat\u2026 that was to watch your competition!\u201d Zhao Yanzi glared at Hao Ren and raised her voice.\u201cThat\u2019s weird. I don\u2019t remember inviting you. You sneaked out yourself, and you\u2019re blaming it on me?\u201d Hao Ren asked.Zhao Yanzi was speechless. Indeed, skipping school to watch Hao Ren\u2019s competition was just a small part; the real reason was that she wanted to see how lively it would be at a university\u2019s Athletic Competition.\u201cDid you see that I got first place yesterday?\u201d Hao Ren asked her again.\u201cWhat is there to brag about? Obtaining first place in that kind of trashy competition!\u201d Zhao Yanzi blushed and almost wanted to beat Hao Ren up.Seeing that she got so anxious, Hao Ren laughed and whispered, \u201cThen why did you come and watch?\u201dZhao Yanzi\u2019s chest was moving up and down from anger. \u201cThis uncle has been going way too far and is getting more and more annoying!\u201d she thought.It was true that she wanted to see Hao Ren\u2019s results of the race, but it really made her angry that she went to watch him but also got mocked by him.She was in angry and didn\u2019t realize that she had done the exact thing to Hao Ren several times before.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to tell your parents about you skipping school, improve your midterm class ranking of each subject by ten.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re threatening me!\u201d Zhao Yanzi showed her teeth and was so eager to bite Hao Ren\u2019s ears off.Hao Ren stuck out a finger and wiggled it. \u201cI\u2019m not threatening you. It\u2019s a condition,\u201d he said.\u201cI won\u2019t accept it!\u201d Zhao Yanzi grabbed the pillow beside her and threw it at Hao Ren.Hao Ren avoided it and smiled again. \u201cNo rush. I will tell your parents that you skipped class if there isn\u2019t any progress on your midterm grades.\u201d\u201cAhhhhhh\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi was very close to going crazy. She had never encountered such an experience when growing up. Especially since her parents, who used to spoil her, seemed to have taken Hao Ren\u2019s side now.\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Hao Ren comforted her when he felt like she was about to explode, \u201cI\u2019ll go shower first. Where is the washroom?\u201d\u201cOver there. Don\u2019t you have eyes?\u201d Zhao Yanzi pointed at a white cabinet.Hao Ren walked over, opened the white cabinet door, and found a well-equipped washroom hidden in there. \u201cWhat the heck!\u201d he thought. If no one told him about it, how could he find it?He walked inside and turned on the shower head. Indeed, he wanted to shower because his body was sticky from being soaked in the rain. However, it was his first time showering in a girl\u2019s home.After he took a hot shower and put on a bathrobe, he saw a set of brand new set of black pajamas folded tidily by the door of the washroom, and Zhao Yanzi was nowhere to be found. After he put it on and walked out of the room, he heard Zhao Yanzi\u2019s voice in the next room.Zhao Hongyu probably heard Hao Ren\u2019s footsteps and called, \u201cCome in, Ren!\u201dHao Ren pushed on the door carefully and entered Zhao Yanzi\u2019s parents\u2019 bedroom.It was a bedroom that was way bigger than Zhao Yanzi\u2019s, but the design of the bedroom was also very delicate. The presentation of the bedroom gave people an elegant and comfortable feeling.Zhao Guang and Zhao Hongyu were both wearing comfortable pajamas. They laid on the three-meters-wide bed and faced the fifty-four-inches plasma TV, which was playing an entertainment show. Zhao Yanzi was laying in between her parents and wore a set of pink pajamas. It seemed like she had showered in the bathroom that was connected to this bedroom.Seeing Hao Ren walk in, Zhao Yanzi, who was giggling just now, suddenly stopped.When Hao Ren saw that the family of three was having a good time, he felt like he shouldn\u2019t have entered.Zhao Hongyu stood up, \u201cDone showering? Leave your clothes in the washroom. I\u2019ll wash them for you, and they should be dry by tomorrow.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine!\u201d Hao Ren rushed to stop her.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re a family. You don\u2019t need to be shy!\u201d Zhao Hongyu neglected Hao Ren\u2019s intent, stepped out of the door, and went to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s room to get his clothes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDo you want to watch TV?\u201d Zhao Guang asked Hao Ren.\u201cUh, no thanks,\u201d Hao Ren stood at the doorway and said blankly.\u201cYou\u2019re still too tense, Ren,\u201d Zhao Guang said to Hao Ren. Then, he patted Zhao Yanzi\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cGo study and don\u2019t let your mom down.\u201dZhao Yanzi stood up from the bed unwillingly, jumped on the rug, and put on a pair of pink cartoon slippers.Zhao Guang looked at their contrasting figures: tall and short; black and pink as they walked out of the bedroom. His gaze seemed distant as he sighed meaningfully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedAfter returning to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s room, Hao Ren realized it was almost eight o\u2019clock and decided to send a text message to Zhao Jiayi. He notified his roommates that he was not going back, just in case they got worried. The four of them had a very close bond. Thus, Hao Ren didn\u2019t want them to worry, especially during this sensitive period after Huang Xujie\u2019s incident.\u201cWho are you texting?\u201d Zhao Yanzi came and looked when she saw Hao Ren busy texting someone.Hao Ren turned his body away and avoided her gaze. However, this made her even more curious, and she had to see.Di\u2026 message sent. Hao Ren put his cell phone back in his pocket.He turned back and looked at Zhao Yanzi. \u201cAlright, sit down and let\u2019s start your lesson,\u201d he said.Zhao Yanzi sat down angrily. Suddenly, she raised her head and looked at Hao Ren from the side, \u201cYou were texting that Class President, right?\u201d\u201cSince when were you allowed to question me?\u201d Hao Ren reached his finger out and dabbed her nose. The pink pajamas made Zhao Yanzi look as cute as a rabbit, and the pink undertone of her fair skin was just like those of the porcelain dolls they sold at the store. Hao Ren had the urge to tease her a little.Hao Ren felt funny especially when he noticed the jealousy in her voice.Pa! She hit Hao Ren\u2019s arm hard and had an extreme reaction toward Hao Ren\u2019s touch.\u201cWhat? Are you jealous?\u201d Hao Ren asked as he used his left hand to rub his right arm, which had turned red.\u201cDo you think I can\u2019t kick you out?\u201d Zhao Yanzi pointed at the outside and said viciously.At this moment, it was still raining cats and dogs. Even though it was quiet in the house, the sound of the rain outside was still audible, and it sounded like a huge storm.Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to worsen the atmosphere. He sighed, \u201cNo, I sent a text message to my roommate and told him that I\u2019m not going back tonight so they won\u2019t worry about me.\u201d\u201cGive me your cell phone!\u201d Zhao Yanzi reached out her pink and soft hand.Hao Ren sighed again and didn\u2019t think he should argue with a little girl. Thus, he took out his cell phone and handed it to her.Zhao Yanzi turned on the phone and actually started checking the text messages on his phone. Her serious expression seemed like that of a suspicious girlfriend, inspecting her boyfriend\u2019s phone.When she saw that the text message was sent to a guy named Zhao Jiayi, she snorted lightly and returned the cell phone to Hao Ren.\u201cNot worried anymore?\u201d Hao Ren put his cell phone back in his pocket and asked her intentionally.\u201cWhat is there to worry about!\u201d Zhao Yanzi defended herself.After all, Hao Ren still couldn\u2019t understand the little girl\u2019s mindset. He flipped open the study material. \u201cLet\u2019s start with English. Today, we are going to emphasize the knowledge point on the infinitive \u2018to do something\u2019,\u201d he said.Zhao Yanzi bit her lips, ignored the thought of arguing with Hao Ren, and opened her notebook.This time, Hao Ren explained very carefully and attentively. He tried to slow down his explanations and started with the most straightforward concepts to the most difficult ones. After tutoring a few times, he knew what level Zhao Yanzi was at and how he should explain the key points accordingly.Zhao Yanzi seemed to be putting in more effort than before. She propped her chin up with her left hand as she memorized and processed the concepts at the same time.The pink pajamas emitted a light aroma. Her eyebrows were slightly raised. The appearance of Zhao Yanzi in deep thought was actually a little charming.\u201cThis little girl is still pretty lovely when she\u2019s quiet,\u201d While explaining, Hao Ren thought to himself.Zhao Yanzi listened and started to blank out gradually. Her gaze moved to Hao Ren\u2019s face. Looking at the somewhat familiar and unfamiliar facial features, staring at the brightness in his eyes, and listening to various English sentences coming out of his mouth, Zhao Yanzi felt slightly dazed.The soft and wet hair stood up messily on top of Hao Ren\u2019s head and reflected the light. Compared to Hao Ren\u2019s normal dry hair, the wet hair seemed to have added some handsomeness to his appearance.\u201cHey, why didn\u2019t you write anything down?\u201d Hao Ren waved his hand in front of Zhao Yanzi\u2019s unfocused eyes as he asked.Zhao Yanzi, recovering from blanking out, flushed slightly and asked. \u201cAh, where were we?\u201dHao Ren signed helplessly, \u201cWe\u2019re at the combination of subject grammar. Utilize \u201cit\u201d to be the subject of the sentence. For example, \u2018it \u2013 is \u2013 my \u2013 duty \u2013 to \u2013 take \u2013 care \u2013 of \u2013 you\u2019.\u201d\u201cOh, oh,\u201d Zhao Yanzi wrote the sentence down but didn\u2019t really understand, so she asked again, \u201cWhat does this sentence mean?\u201d\u201cHow come you don\u2019t know this simple sentence?\u201d Hao Ren pointed at his notebook and said, \u201cDuty is responsibility, and this sentence means taking care of you is my responsibility.\u201dHe was angry and a bit depressed. He prepared detailed information and explained so clearly, but Zhao Yanzi didn\u2019t even care and blanked out.Seeing Hao Ren was getting slightly impatient, Zhao Yanzi got irritated as well. \u201cI was at school all day and have to listen to you tutor at night. I\u2019m already tired to death! Why can\u2019t I snooze for a bit?\u201dHao Ren wasn\u2019t feeling that great either and got angry when he saw her finding excuses for herself. \u201cWhat kind of attitude is this? I am helping you out by teaching you\u2026\u201dKnock! Knock! Knock! Three knocking sounds came from the door.The door opened soon after. Zhao Hongyu, who walked in with a plate of snacks in her hands, asked, \u201cWhat are you guys fighting about?\u201dHalf of Hao Ren\u2019s anger suddenly disappeared when he saw Zhao Hongyu. Zhao Yanzi\u2019s expression also turned tame.\u201cUh\u2026 nothing. We were discussing a knowledge point, and Zi and I had different opinions,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cOh? Let me see,\u201d Zhao Hongyu didn\u2019t seem to buy his excuse. She walked over, picked up Zhao Yanzi\u2019s notes, and read with fluent English, \u201cIt \u2013 is \u2013 my \u2013 duty \u2013 to \u2013 take \u2013 care \u2013 of \u2013 you, which means it is my responsibility to look after you. What\u2019s wrong with this sentence?\u201dHao Ren and Zhao Yanzi were both embarrassed and didn\u2019t know how to answer. Hao Ren felt weird as well. \u201cWhy did I get so angry when Zhao Yanzi randomly talked back?\u201cHmm, it\u2019s a great sentence,\u201d Zhao Hongyu put Zhao Yanzi\u2019s notes down and moved the plate of snacks towards them. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we had dinner. Eat some snacks,\u201d she said.\u201cThank you, auntie,\u201d Hao Ren grabbed a slice of cake.\u201cThanks, mom.\u201d Zhao Yanzi pouted her mouth as she carefully grabbed a piece of desserts from the plate.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAlright, I\u2019m not going to disturb you anymore. Study hard,\u201d Zhao Hongyu took the plate and walked out of the room with a smile.Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi looked at each other and felt a bit awkward. Strangely, the burning flames of anger couldn\u2019t seem to be ignited again.Hao Ren coughed twice and broke the silence. He followed the spirit Zhao Hongyu conveyed at dinner time and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll stop here for English. You don\u2019t have questions about other subjects, right? It seems like you\u2019re tired as well. Let\u2019s call it a day.\u201dHua! Zhao Yanzi pulled out her drawer and grabbed a few thick exercise books.A smile of revenge emerged on her face as she spoke with a clear voice, \u201cI suddenly feel energetic again!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And this, and this\u2026\u201d Opening the practice book, Zhao Yanzi circled with the ball-point pen.\u201cUrm, let me take a look\u2026\u201d Hao Ren forced himself to look through the problems.\u201cThis is only Math. And I still have Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology\u2026\u201d One by one, like in a magic show, Zhao Yanzi pulled out many practice books from that little drawer.Hao Ren was dizzy with exhaustion, and he could only solve a few of the problems. Meanwhile, Zhao Yanzi slouched in the chair with her arms crossed over her chest, looking at Hao Ren with a gloating smile.\u201cDamn! How come the science courses in middle school have gotten so difficult\u2026\u201d Hao Ren cursed silently. However, since he couldn\u2019t humiliate himself in front of Zhao Yanzi, he had to rack his brain on the problems.While he was working on the Eighth-Grade math problems, he thought about advanced mathematics; while he was working on the physics problems, he thought about college-level physics theories\u2026 The big gap between his current knowledge of the subjects and that of a middle schooler made it impossible for him only to solve the problems using middle school concepts.\u201cUncle, can you solve them or not?\u201d While he was struggling with mounting frustration, Zhao Yanzi asked him in high spirit. Hao Ren had tormented her in English, and now she felt good about the retaliation.Putting his hands to his burning temples, Hao Ren felt he was going to explode. However, it was too shameful to admit that he, a student at a top university, couldn\u2019t solve middle school problems.\u201cHand me all your textbooks, and I\u2019ll refresh my memory on the middle school concepts,\u201d Hao Ren put down the pen and said to her.Zhao Yanzi misunderstood him and said, \u201cBut I need them for tomorrow\u2019s classes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I only need them for tonight,\u201d Hao Ren looked confident.\u201cWait!\u201d Standing up, Zhao Yanzi walked to the bed and picked up her backpack. She dug out five to six thick textbooks before handing them to Hao Ren.\u201cSleep early tonight,\u201d Hao Ren said to her as he walked to the door with the textbooks in his hands.Zhao Yanzi looked at him, stunned. She was surprised that Hao Ren was still so nice to her and didn\u2019t get angry as she had expected.Before she could regain her composure, Hao Ren had left her room and walked up to the attic where Zhao Hongyu\u2019s studio was.She looked down at her pink pajamas and the soft skin under the collar and wondered, \u201cIs he not attracted to me at all?\u201d\u201cHe leaves as soon as he finishes tutoring as if it is a task to him\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi thought as she looked down at the slight rise of her chest. All of a sudden, she thought of the pretty girl she met at East Ocean University during the Athletic Games.She snorted with disdain and jumped onto her bed.When Hao Ren got up to the studio, he found that neatly laid out bedding was placed on the clean floor, and on one side of the bedding hanged the clothes he had changed out of earlier. They had been washed and dried.\u201cZhao Yanzi\u2019s mother is such a thoughtful and considerate woman. If Zhao Yanzi can grow into a woman with half of her mother\u2019s virtues, I will be a happy man\u2026 Urm, what am I thinking\u2026\u201dHao Ren put the textbooks on the floor before settling down. He picked a random textbook from the floor and began to study it.Outside, the storm continued into the night as predicted by Zhao Hongyu. Illuminated by the soft yellow light, the little attic was warm and quiet.While reading, he began to doze off. Clap! The book slid from his hands and fell to the floor.In her room, Zhao Yanzi was tossing and turning in her bed, unable to sleep. She turned on the lights and stared up at the ceiling covered with stars. After a while, she got up from her bed and tiptoed out of her room and up the stairs; she was curious about what Hao Ren was doing.When she found Hao Ren asleep with textbooks scattered around him, her suspicious heart was touched.The pitter-patter of raindrops outside made the small attic seem a little cold.\u201cYou jerk, throwing my books everywhere.\u201dShe thought for a moment and tiptoed into the room. She picked up the textbooks and was about to leave when a thought occurred to her. She bent down and quietly dragged the kicked-aside quilt over his body.She made a face at the sleeping Hao Ren and waved her hand in front of his face as if she was going to strike him. But in the end, she didn\u2019t wake him up.Carrying the heavy books, Zhao Yanzi returned to her room on the second floor.The next morning.When Hao Ren woke up, he was a bit startled to find himself not in his dorm. Sitting up, he saw the quilt had been kicked aside and realized that the textbooks beside him were gone.It was still raining, though not as heavily as last night.He changed into his own clothes and walked down the stairs to the first floor. When he passed by Zhao Yanzi\u2019s room, it was rather quiet.Chop! Chop!\u2026 The chopping sounds came from the kitchen.Hao Ren walked in and found Zhao Hungyu who was in her apron busy in the kitchen.\u201cMorning, auntie,\u201d He went in and greeted her.\u201cYou up already?\u201d Zhao Hongyu smiled at him. \u201cHow was your sleep last night?\u201d she asked.\u201cIt was good. Isn\u2019t Zi up yet?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cShe is a lazy bug and won\u2019t get up until someone wakes her. Go to Zi\u2019s bathroom for your morning wash-up. I\u2019ve put a new towel and a new toothbrush there for you,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said.\u201cI\u2019ll wait for her to get up. It\u2019s not right to barge into her room,\u201d Hao Ren said.Zhao Hongyu nodded with a smile. Indeed, if Zi found that Hao Ren had seen her unladylike sleeping poses, she would fly into a rage and make a scene.\u201cZi\u2019s father will drive you to school. Relax in the living room for now,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said while chopping the Chinese Mustard with ease.\u201cMinced pork congee with mustard and preserved egg? Let me help you,\u201d Hao Ren walked over and began to help.Zhao Hongyu didn\u2019t refuse his help. She smiled and said, \u201cYou are a good boy.\u201d\u201cAnd you are a great mother,\u201d Hao Ren replied.\u201cDoesn\u2019t your mom cook you breakfast?\u201d Zhao Hongyu asked casually.\u201cShe is very busy and has no time to do the things an ordinary mother does,\u201d Hao Ren answered after some thoughts.Sensing the faint disappointment in Hao Ren\u2019s tone, Zhao Hongyu smiled at him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. This is your home now,\u201d she said.Hao Ren was touched. He wasn\u2019t certain about Zhao Yanzi\u2019s feelings toward him, but he knew Zhao Hongyu treated him as a member of her family.Not knowing how to answer her, he busied himself and worked silently.Soon after, Zhao Guang and Zhao Yanzi got up and came down to the first floor. By now, the deliciously smelling minced pork congee with mustard and preserved egg was on the table, a result of the joint efforts of Hao Ren and Zhao Hongyu.Hao Ren went into the bathroom in Zhao Yanzi\u2019s room to wash up, and Zhao Guang was pleased that Hao Ren had helped to make breakfast.Zhao Yanzi was surprised that Hao Ren was such a hardworking and able guy. However, when her mother scolded her for being surprised, she pouted in silent protest.When the simple breakfast ended, the storm which had been raging for the whole night ended as well.Zhao Guang got ready to drive Zhao Yanzi and Hao Ren to school while Zhao Hongyu took off her apron and revealed the lotus flower halter top with thin straps underneath. She put on her sunglasses and grabbed a very ladylike black purse before entering the garage.One minute later, Zhao Hongyu drove a red Ferrari out of the garage.Hao Ren was surprised by Zhao Hongyu\u2019s instant change from a perfect mother to a fashionable woman. But then again, it wasn\u2019t that big of a surprise since Zhao Hongyu was a top-rated designer.He had only seen her role as the perfect mother recently and had forgotten that she had her own career. With her reputation and ability, she was probably leading her own elite team and running an independent studio.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith a wave of her hand, Zhao Hongyu sped off in her shiny red Ferrari.In his low-profiled black Chevrolet, Zhao Guang drove Zhao Yanzi and Hao Ren to their schools successively. Not wanting to draw more attention to him, Hao Ren asked Zhao Guang to drop him off hundreds of meters away from the school\u2019s main gate.After saying goodbye to Zhao Guang, Hao Ren walked to the main gate of the university.From afar, he saw some students hanging up a banner over the gate.\u201cA Warm Welcome to the World Famous Biologist Hao Zhonghua and Globally Well-known Meteorologist Yue Yang who will be Giving Lectures at the University!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(2 in 1 Chapter) Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedHao Ren walked toward the banner and saw a line of smaller characters underneath the big ones: \u201cThursday, March 18th at 8 PM in Shaw Auditorium.\u201cNext Thursday is a full week from now, but the school couldn\u2019t wait to put up the banner at the main gate. It is undoubtedly their way of showing off,\u201d Hao Ren thought.Although East Ocean University was currently a comprehensive university, its goal was to become a research-focused university. To reach that goal, the school had been working hard to hold science and technology lectures and establish science research projects. Directed by this strategy, East Ocean University\u2019s research branch had been growing while its comprehensive abilities were still improving. Its undergraduate programs were ranked among the top ten nationally while the development of masters and doctors had been moving into more advanced areas.While he walked through the campus, Hao Ren leaped over one puddle after another. After the storm, the tree-lined campus was full of cool and refreshing air.After he walked from the main gate to the southern entrance, Hao Ren crossed a street and returned to his dorm. He found that his roommates were already gone, so he picked up his bag and walked back to the campus for the lectures.In the classroom, Zhou Liren spotted Hao Ren and yelled, \u201cRen, are you a kept man now?\u201d\u201cStop your nonsense!\u201d Hao Ren hurried over and knocked Zhou Liren\u2019s head with his book.\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you come back last night? We all thought that you had been kept by a rich lady!\u201d Zhou Liren covered his head with his hands and laughed.\u201cIsn\u2019t that your dream?\u201d Hao Ren slapped Zhou Liren\u2019s head twice with his book, though not with force.Xie Yujia, who was sitting in front of them, heard their bickering. She turned to look at them.\u201cDid you stay the night in the home of the little girl you are tutoring?\u201d Zhao Jiayi came over and asked.\u201cYeah. I couldn\u2019t come back because of the storm and had to stay the night in their home,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cThey should have asked you to stay the night. Is it possible they want you to be their son-in-law?\u201d Cao Ronghua also joined the conversation.\u201cWe analyzed the situation for half a night and thought that the little girl has some hidden motives. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have come to see you race at the Athletic Games,\u201d seeing that Hao Ren had stopped assaulting him, Zhou Liren raised his head and said.Slap!Hao Ren\u2019s book landed harshly on his face again.\u201cStop your wild guesses! I stayed there for the night because of the storm,\u201d Hao Ren tossed the book onto the desk before sitting down.\u201cThen you and Xie Yujia\u2026\u201d Zhou Liren leaned toward him and lowered his voice, \u201c\u2026have nothing going on?\u201d\u201cF*ck! You are such a gossiper!\u201d Hao Ren glared at him.\u201cThis information is worth 1,000 yuan. If you have a girlfriend, Zhao Jiayi will lose 1,000 yuan to me and Cao Ronghua,\u201d Zhou Liren snickered.\u201cB*tch!\u201d Hao Ren tapped Zhou Liren\u2019s face with the back of his fist.The morning and half of the afternoon passed uneventfully in classes.Hao Ren spent some time preparing that night\u2019s tutoring lesson for Zhao Yanzi, and the last class was over before he noticed.There were still two hours before dinner time. They usually spent it on playing cards in the dorm or playing World of Warcraft at the internet cafes.The students filed out of the classroom. Suddenly, Hao Ren noticed that the students who had walked out of the room all stopped at the door.Hao Ren and Zhou Liren walked to the door slowly and saw Su Han, who rarely showed herself on campus, standing at the door. She looked like she was waiting for someone.At the sight of Hao Ren, Su Han walked forward and said, \u201cMr. Hao, please take a walk with me around the campus.\u201dHearing her words, the surrounding classmates suddenly turned quiet. Xie Yujia also stared at Su Han and Hao Ren in astonishment and confusion.\u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201d at Hao Ren\u2019s silence, Su Han asked.\u201cLet\u2019s go then!\u201d Hao Ren squared his shoulders and escorted Su Han to the stairs pretentiously.His classmates were left behind, gaping at them.They went down the stairs and out of the Academic Building. On the way, the students they met all shot strange glances at them since they had never seen Su Han walk with a male student before.Today, Su Han was dressed in black and white. The short-sleeved sweater with a U-shaped neckline accentuated her elegant long neck and showcased her beautiful head like a statue.She wore big retro bracelets which made her arms look slimmer and more feminine.Hao Ren looked askance at her up-close and wondered which of the two women, Su Han or Zhao Hongyu, had a better taste in fashion.When he turned his head around, he saw Zhou Liren and others sneakily following them in the distance.\u201cThese guys\u2026\u201d Hao Ren didn\u2019t know what to do with them. He knew Su Han was aware that the guys were following them. Since she had come for him, she didn\u2019t intend to keep their meeting a secret.\u201cI have made a thorough investigation on this issue,\u201d Su Han said abruptly when they were more than a dozen meters away from the Academic Building.A faint fragrance floated from her cherry-shaped mouth. Even without make-up, Su Han was a great beauty.\u201cYou mean the issue of my identity?\u201d Hao Ren asked. Since they were far away from other people, Hao Ren wasn\u2019t worried about being overheard.\u201cYes,\u201d Su Han nodded and said. \u201cI asked Lu Qin and talked to Zi. I have a clear understanding of the whole situation.\u201d\u201cThen do you acknowledge my identity now?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cYes, barely. Since East Ocean is determined, I have made an exception for you. You are not from the orthodox background, but due to the special circumstances and the insistence of Zi\u2019s parents who are my benefactors, I will temporarily give you a chance,\u201d Su Han, walking with light steps, said.\u201cTemporarily?\u201d Hao Ren caught the keyword and asked.\u201cRight, only temporarily. The result of my negotiation with East Ocean is that if you don\u2019t succeed in the cultivation of the techniques of the Dragon Tribe, I, as an inspector, will have to deprive you of the qualification of becoming a member of the Dragon Tribe. And the time limit\u2026\u201d Su Han paused for a second before she said, \u201c\u2026is only one month.\u201d\u201cI need to a breakthrough of the Spirit Concentration Scroll?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cIn your dreams. It is just a basic technique, and you are not counted as a cultivator even if you mastered it. I meant Kan-level which is the lowest level in the cultivation system of the Dragons. Qian, Kun, Xun, Dui, Gen, Zhen, Li, and Kan 1 ; these are the eight levels, and Kan is the lowest!\u201d Su Han said coldly.Hao Ren was a bit disappointed. It had taken him almost two weeks to break through the first level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll, and maybe he was one of the least talented guys. It would be extremely difficult for him to reach Kan-level within one month.\u201cI\u2019ve told you everything you need to know. If you can\u2019t meet my requirement, I\u2019ll have to do my duty despite my feelings for East Ocean. In the next while, I will closely monitor your cultivation progress,\u201d Su Han continued.Hao Ren silently lamented his ill fate. Now he was not only monitored by the school\u2019s vice president and his \u201cfather-in-law\u201d, but also by Su Han, the beautiful teacher who was in the center of the attention.Being under the supervision of these three people was worse than being roasted in the elixir furnace.\u201cI have to warn you. I\u2019m not the only inspector in the Dragon Tribe. I am lenient with you, but when other inspectors notice you, you won\u2019t be so lucky.\u201dHao Ren asked in bafflement, \u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re lucky, they will only interrogate you. But if you\u2019re not, they might kill you,\u201d Su Han said, emphasizing each word.When Hao Ren froze in astonishment, Su Han turned to look at him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t panic.\u201dShe took out a silver necklace from her pocket. \u201cThis necklace holds a special array formation designed by me which can conceal the faint dragon presence in your body and keep other inspectors from noticing you.\u201dRelieved, Hao Ren berated her silently for scaring him by not taking out the necklace earlier.Instead of putting the necklace in Hao Ren\u2019s hand, she faced him and put it around his neck.Zhou Liren and others who had been following them from a distance were all stunned. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? How intimate are Su Han and Hao Ren? She\u2019s putting a necklace on him! And the necklace seems to be her gift to Hao Ren!\u201d they thought.Hao Ren had not expected that Su Han would put the necklace on him herself.Of course, Zhou Liren and his buddies were not the only witnesses. The other students loitering around campus had also seen it. After all, Su Han rarely showed herself on campus and everyone would notice the super beauty wherever she went.Everyone was shocked, but Zhou Liren was on an extreme; he put his finger in his mouth and almost bit it off.\u201cWith the array formation I designed on it, only I can put it on you or take it off you,\u201d Su Han lowered her slim and soft arms and explained.Hao Ren tried to take it off but failed. Besides, the necklace seemed to be made from a special material which couldn\u2019t be broken easily.\u201cFortunately, the necklace is quite pretty. Otherwise, it would look like a dog collar,\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.If Zhou Liren had heard this ungrateful thought, he would have strangled Hao Ren with jealousy because he would have passed out in happiness if Su Han had put a dog collar on him.\u201cOf course, this necklace has other functions. One of them is that I can track your whereabouts anytime I want,\u201d Su Han continued.\u201cF*ck! I have been tricked!\u201d Hao Ren thought, \u201cThis Su Han is really a fox. She pretended to be concerned about my safety, but her real intention is to monitor and control me!\u201dSeeing the regretful expression on Hao Ren\u2019s face, Su Han smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s no use crying over spilled milk. As I told you, you can\u2019t remove it until you find someone more powerful than me,\u201d she said.Looking at her beautiful smiling face, Hao Ren lamented silently that beautiful women were the most ruthless. He searched his brain for a person more powerful than Su Han and found one: Zhao Yanzi\u2019s Third Uncle.However, that Third Uncle didn\u2019t like Hao Ren and probably won\u2019t waste his strength to help. As to the other people, neither Lu Qing nor Zhao Hongyu had greater strength than Su Han.\u201cThis damn Inspector! She traped me, and I am now totally under her control! The woman looked cold, but she is actually very cunning,\u201d Hao Ren silently berated the beautiful woman who was worshipped and admired by all the guys in the school.\u201cWell, what other questions do you have for me? I can walk with you for another half hour,\u201d Su Han\u2019s fleeting smile vanished while she continued the walk.Hao Ren hurriedly followed her. \u201cI\u2019d like to know how many Inspectors are out there\u2026\u201dZhou Liren, Zhao Jiayi, and Cao Ronghua continued to follow them. When they saw Hao Ren walking shoulder to shoulder with Su Han while talking animatedly, they were green with envy.\u201cThe number of Inspectors is not fixed. Some wander around between cities and are disguised as artists, musicians and such, and others, like me, stay in one city and supervise the dragons in that area,\u201d Su Han answered Hao Ren patiently.Hao Ren was pleased to obtain this useful information. He continued to ask, \u201cThen how can I recognize these Inspectors?\u201dThis question was important to him, and he had to know the details.\u201cYou can\u2019t recognize the Inspectors, especially those who wander around. Even elders like Lu Qing probably can\u2019t spot them. Only Inspectors can sense each other\u2019s existence,\u201d Su Han explained.Inspectors were like secret agents whom you can\u2019t avoid. Even the mighty East Ocean Dragon Clan has to be respectful towards them. No wonder Zhao Hongyu was cautious when she mentioned Su Han. Hao Ren had a better understanding of the situation now.\u201cThis thing you gave me,\u201d Hao Ren pointed at the necklace and asked, \u201cWill it last forever?\u201d\u201cThe array formation on the necklace lasts only one month. After one month, unless I transfer more energy into it, the array formation will automatically stop working,\u201d Su Han answered him.No one would expect such patient explanations from Su Han, who was so cold in the class that she never answered her students\u2019 questions.Hao Ren wasn\u2019t the only one who was surprised. Zhou Liren and the other students, both male and female who were watching them from a distance, were also astonished to see Su Han talk incessantly with a male student.The sky was cloudy, but the air was quite refreshing. Beautiful Su Han dressed in black and white walking shoulder to shoulder with the ordinary-looking Hao Ren under the willow shades along the lake bank was not a perfect picture, but others felt like they were intimate.\u201cThat was why I gave you the time limit of one month. If you can reach Kan-level in one month, your body will release pure dragon energy, and the other Inspectors won\u2019t easily detect you. Besides, if you get to Kan-level, you will have some strength to defend yourself even if you meet a tough Inspector,\u201d Su Han added.Looking at her, Hao Ren suddenly realized that she was, in fact, helping him.\u201cSince you don\u2019t acknowledge my official status, why do you want to help me?\u201d Hao Ren asked her.Su Han sighed a little. \u201cBecause I owe East Ocean a favor and helping you is to return that favor,\u201d she said.\u201cWhat kind of favor?\u201d Hao Ren continued to ask.Su Han looked at him and thought for a while before answering, \u201cI grew up in the East Ocean Dragon Palace. Zhao Guang and Zhao Hongyu took care of me before.\u201d\u201cDragon Palace?\u201d Hao Ren raised his voice in astonishment. He was stunned that it did exist.\u201cYes. It\u2019s hidden under the water of East Ocean, and I think Zhao Guang will take you there one day. Most of the elders of East Ocean are in the Dragon Palace, guarding the place while cultivating. Only a few clever ones are in the city assisting Zhao Guang,\u201d Su Han said.Strange feelings surged in Hao Ren\u2019s heart. He had thought the so-called dragons looked a bit too ordinary and thus was surprised that the legendary Dragon Palace really existed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cTo Zhao Yanzi and others who live in the city, the Dragon Palace should be like their home and base, right?\u201d he thought.\u201cSo you grew up in the Dragon Palace?\u201d Hao Ren asked her with interest.\u201cI am an orphan and was adopted by an elder of East Ocean. That\u2019s why I spent my childhood in the East Ocean Dragon Palace,\u201d Su Han said lightly.When she said those words, her expression was calm without a trace of sadness.After a few seconds of consideration, Hao Ren asked rudely, \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering, how old are you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, the coldness in her eyes could almost freeze Hao Ren into an ice sculpture.\u201c24,\u201d She stared at him for a few seconds before she told him her age.Hao Ren exhaled deeply, \u201cI thought you are a few hundred years old\u2026\u201d he murmured.He only spoke his mind and didn\u2019t think things through. Su Han was able to level up from Kan-level to Qian-level in 20 years, and she was what Zhao Hongyu referred to as a Heavenly-level Master. It showed how talented she was.Lu Qing, for example, tried his hardest and was only able to get to Kun-level after working towards it for a few hundred years. For him, Kun-level was already the highest he could dream of in this lifetime.The difference in power between them was not only one or two folds.Su Han rolled her eyes at him. Although her heart was as calm as a pond of water, she was a woman after all, and every woman cared about their age.\u201cOk, what other questions do you have?\u201d Su Han asked Hao Ren in a cold voice.In fact, Hao Ren wanted to ask about her body measurements for Zhou Liren. But he could only secretly wonder in silence to avoid being beaten by her. He could never ask that out loud.\u201cOh, are there any quiet places in the school where I can concentrate on cultivating?\u201d Hao Ren suddenly remembered and asked.He was interrupted by Zhao Jiayi just when he was going to achieve a breakthrough last time when he was cultivating on the balcony. It made him gloomy for several days.\u201cQuiet places\u2026\u201d Su Han thought about it and said, \u201cYou should go find Lu Qing and ask for a spare office to cultivate in.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026a bit dramatic,\u201d Hao Ren hesitated. Owning a separate office as an ordinary student would soon be found out by others. Who knew what kind of disturbances it would cause.\u201cIt\u2019s your business as for where you should cultivate. I\u2019m not dealing with it,\u201d Su Han said coldly as if Hao Ren\u2019s question about her age triggered her.\u201cOr\u2026\u201d Hao Ren asked cautiously, \u201cCould I borrow your office?\u201d\u201cYou are asking for a yard after taking an inch, eh?\u201d Su Han raised her eyebrows.Hao Ren laughed awkwardly and explained, \u201cI just think it would be nice to be able to ask you if I run into any problems\u2026\u201dHe realized that Su Han was charming even though she was mad at him. It was bizarre that Su Han, who had always been so calm, could get mad at him.It was his cautious suggestion that upset her. He had definitely touched this \u201cimperial guard\u2019s\u201d sensitive spot.Su Han pondered as she looked at Hao Ren, \u201cYou are right. Zhao Guang is busy with work, and Lu Qing is swarmed with trivial things, so neither of them have the time to guide you. How about you see me in my office from 4:00-6: 00 PM, Monday to Friday. But don\u2019t bother me at other times.Hao Ren was thrilled to get Su Han\u2019s permission. Not only did he get a chance to spend time with a pretty lady, but his chance of survival had also increased! After all, she was the strongest person other than Zhao Yanzi\u2019s Third Uncle he had ever met.This was why he tried his luck with Su Han when she came to see him today.Su Han actually had her own reasonings for this decision. She was a cultivation addict by nature, and what she hated the most was being interrupted during cultivation. However, she wanted to return East Ocean\u2019s favor of bringing her up. On top of that, she found Hao Ren to be a hard-working guy, so she didn\u2019t mind giving him some instructions.If it weren\u2019t for those reasons, she would have smashed away anyone with such a request.\u201cI\u2019m heading back if you don\u2019t have any more questions,\u201d she said lightly.Hao Ren looked up at the big clock hanging on the library building and realized it was already half past four. That meant he had been walking with Su Han for the past half an hour.None of the guys at school had the chance to even spend a minute with her, yet Hao Ren walked and chatted with her for 30 minutes! This could cause the guys to kill him with jealousy if they found out.Even for Zhou Liren and the guys, it would be a luxury experience to walk for half an hour with Su Han. They had never seen or heard of something like that.\u201cOk, I\u2019ll come to see you at four every weekday as long as I don\u2019t have class!\u201d Hao Ren said.Su Han nodded and briskly walked to her office.\u201cOh\u2026wait a moment!\u201d Hao Ren suddenly thought of something and called.Su Han stopped and turned around.Having seen this, Zhou Liren almost wanted to run over and chock Hao Ren. \u201cAside from the walk, Hao Ren could even call out for her to stop!\u201d he thought.\u201cUm\u2026lots of people saw me walking with you on campus today\u2026 How should I explain it to them?\u201d he asked.\u201cJust say I\u2019m your older sister,\u201d Su Han said after thinking for a bit.Then she left swiftly.Hao Ren was relieved as he watched her leave. Having an answer that she had agreed to was much easier than making up a lie himself, especially if it would make her mad in the future.The fact was, this seemingly cold and weak lady would finish Hao Ren with just one finger.When he turned back and prepared for the upcoming interrogation from his roommates, a bright red color entered his view.He looked over and saw a red Ferrari driving towards the campus. Although it was not fast, the flame-like color still dragged a ray of red behind it.\u201cI have\u2026probably seen that car this morning\u2026\u201d Hao Ren remembered.Su Han, who had almost reached her office, also slowed down at the sight of the car.The red Ferrari slowly approached Su Han and stopped right in front of her.The beautiful lady in the car took off her sunglasses and flashed a charming smile, \u201cSu, long time no see!\u201dWho could it be if it wasn\u2019t Zhao Hongyu!Zhao Jiayi and the guys were just about to interrogate Hao Ren. However, the Ferrari and the beautiful lady made them stay where they were as if they were under a spell.\u201cHongyu, how come you are here?\u201d Su Han asked lightly as if she weren\u2019t surprised about Hongyu showing up at all.Hao Ren thought about it and realized that Su Han might have already sensed Zhao Hongyu approaching from a few kilometers away with her level of strength.\u201cThere isn\u2019t much to do at work, so I took off earlier and came here to catch up with you,\u201d Zhao Hongyu got out of the car and walked to Su Han as she said softly.The guys were surprised to see such an elegant lady stepping out of the car. She was obviously a high-class office lady with a great temperament.\u201cYou want to talk about Hao Ren, right?\u201d Su Han turned around and looked at Hao Ren, who wasn\u2019t far away, as she said to Zhao Hongyu, \u201cI won\u2019t cause him any trouble this month, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSu Han\u2019s cold attitude was pushing people away. Due to her high status, Zhao Hongyu had to show her some respect, but she wasn\u2019t going to beg her or anything. Having heard a precise answer from Su Han, she nodded and said to Hao Ren, \u201cRen, you don\u2019t have any classes this afternoon, right?\u201dHao Ren nodded.\u201cThen come home with me. We can go get groceries on the way back,\u201d Zhao Hongyu waved him over and asked him to get in the car.Hao Ren sat in the million-dollar Ferrari.As they drove away, Zhao Jiayi and the guys were stunned with their jaws falling to the ground behind them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It wasn\u2019t very hot because it rained last night, so the weather was quite breezy and pleasant.The Ferrari Zhao Hongyu drove was a two-seat roadster. Her charming figure and stylish attire caught a lot of attention from the pedestrians while they waited for the red lights even though she was wearing sunglasses.On the contrary, Hao Ren was dressed very casually, and that didn\u2019t really match up with the scene.\u201cRen, it\u2019s still early, how about I take you to a mall and buy some clothes for you?\u201d Zhao Hongyu turned her head around and asked Hao Ren.\u201cEm, no thanks. I\u2019m comfortable with what I\u2019m wearing now,\u201d Hao Ren answered as he touched his clothes.He got most of his clothes from the light textile market around his university. The clothes there usually didn\u2019t have any brand names, and there was a vast price difference between them and those sold in the mall. However, Hao Ren didn\u2019t care much about that as long as the clothes were comfortable to wear. It didn\u2019t bother him if some of the clothes were worn out.Zhao Hongyu didn\u2019t want to force Hao Ren. Suddenly, she smiled and said, \u201cDid Su Han give you the necklace, it seems that she has accepted you already.\u201dWooom!The roadster dashed out as soon as the green light went on.Her driving skills seemed first-class to Hao Ren. The red Ferrari was smoothly shuttling back and forth between the traffic flow on the broad road.\u201cIt is hard to tell that Zhao Hongyu, who is so gentle and kind, could be so aggressive while driving,\u201d Hao Ren thought as he secretly stared at the side of her calm and graceful face,Nevertheless, as the powerful engine of the Ferrari was roaring, it also attracted many whistles from some playboys who were in their own fancy cars. If Hao Ren didn\u2019t sit beside her, those guys probably would get close and flirt.However, if Zhao Hongyu even sped up slightly, those guys wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up.The car drove to somewhere near Zhao Yanzi\u2019s home, and they parked in front of a local grocery market. Zhao Hongyu took out a basket from some corner of the car like she was doing magic tricks as she got out of the vehicle, and Hao Ren got out with her. Zhao Hongyu picked up her car key and locked the car with two beeps, and then she paid five yuan to the old man for parking.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said to Hao Ren gently and walked into the dim indoor grocery market with the basket. As they walked in, there were some curious young, and middle-aged men gawking over the million-dollar car. It was expected since they could only see a Ferrari in magazines or on TV.\u201cDriving a Ferrari to go grocery shopping, what kind of life is this\u2026\u201d Hao Ren felt speechless as he followed Zhao Hongyu inside.\u201cGirl, you here for grocery shopping again?\u201d as Zhao Hongyu walked in, some farmers and butchers said hi to her from their booths.Zhao Hongyu smiled at them as she carried the basket and walked up to the closest vegetable booth, \u201cUncle Liu, how are the vegetables today?\u201d\u201cFresh! Absolutely fresh! I just dug them out of the field this afternoon!\u201d that fifty-year-old man with messy hair promised to Zhao Hongyu while tapping his chest.\u201cGreat, get me two potatoes and three tomatoes, I\u2019ll make some soup when I get home,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said with a smile.\u201cOk! I\u2019ll pick the best for you!\u201d the booth owner laughed happily. He then picked out some potatoes and tomatoes and weighed them. \u201cThe total will be five yuan and thirty cents, just give me five yuan!\u201d he said.\u201cI can\u2019t do that!\u201d Zhao Hongyu took out her wallet from her stylish coat like she was doing magic tricks again. She grabbed a five yuan bill and then dug out thirty cents and put them on the electrical scale. After that, she put the tomatoes and potatoes in her basket.\u201cCome back next time!\u201d the man spoke loudly to Zhao Hongyu in a happy tone after closing a small deal.\u201cAlright, alright!\u201d Zhao Hongyu answered happily as well. She then walked to another booth, \u201cGranny Sun, how are the fruits today?\u201d she asked.\u201cThose cherries just arrived today! They are delicious!\u201d the granny with wrinkles all over her face said to Zhao Hongyu.\u201cHehe, then let me get a kilogram please,\u201d Zhao Hongyu took a bag and put some in.She turned around to ask Hao Ren, \u201cwhat fruits would you like? what would you like for dinner?\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, auntie. It\u2019s up to you,\u201d Hao Ren said shyly.\u201cWho is this, I have never seen him before,\u201d the granny at the fruit booth asked as she weighed the cherries.\u201cMy distantly related nephew,\u201d Zhao Hongyu answered.\u201cAh, young man, you look quite handsome,\u201d the granny said after observing Hao Ren.It was Hao Ren\u2019s first time hearing someone call him \u201chandsome\u201d, and he didn\u2019t know how he should feel.After buying fruits, Zhao Hongyu then brought Hao Ren to get some more meat, flour, and other vegetables\u2026 Every booth owner was greeting Zhao Hongyu passionately, and Zhao Hongyu chatted with them while shopping.Ever since he was young, Hao Ren had only been to the grocery market a few times with his grandmother, and he barely went there after he grew up. Grocery shopping with Zhao Hongyu and hearing her chats with the farmers suddenly seemed so genial to him.Who could tell that this beautiful woman drove here in a Ferrari?Having got everything they needed after walking around, the basket got heavier and heavier, so Hao Ren volunteered to carry it.They walked out of the grocery market and saw a couple of kids playing around the fancy Ferrari. Some were so naughty that they even tried to climb into the roadster; the old man managing the parking lot couldn\u2019t even do anything to stop them.Zhao Hongyu didn\u2019t get mad at all. She just walked up there and opened the car door after unlocking the car, and the kids dispersed as soon as they saw the owner was back.Zhao Hongyu smiled helplessly. She sat in the car and waved at Hao Ren, \u201cGet in the car.\u201dHao Ren got in the car with the basket, and Zhao Hongyu pointed at the space back in the car and said, \u201cJust leave it at the back.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWater was dripping from the basket that was full of vegetables and meats, and Hao Ren followed the instruction and put it into the baked-porcelain-painted rut located at the back of the fancy, million dollar Ferrari\u2026Anyone else who witnessed this would probably break down\u2026Zhao Hongyu started the car, drove it out of the parking spot, and seamlessly joined the traffic flow on the road.Hao Ren sat in the passenger seat and quietly watched everything Zhao Hongyu was doing. Zhao Hongyu wasn\u2019t only a famous designer, a virtuous housewife, Zhao Yanzi\u2019s mother, but also the Dragon Queen\u2026She had perfectly switched between all of those roles and had tried her best to do everything to the best of her abilities. Staring at Zhao Hongyu who was so close to him, Hao Ren suddenly had a deep admiration for this young mother.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Actually, he didn\u2019t want to talk about the issue of Zhao Yanzi. First of all, he wasn\u2019t sure what his parents would think. Second, he didn\u2019t feel like this matter was concrete enough to mention yet.\u201cFine, I\u2019m not going to make it hard for you,\u201d Zhao Hongyu smiled understandingly and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll find a chance to talk about it after your parents come back.\u201dHao Ren almost told her that his parents had their careers, and all the family issues were up to his grandma. As long as his grandma accepted Zhao Yanzi as her granddaughter-in-law, it wouldn\u2019t matter how hard his parents try to object.Apparently, Hao Ren didn\u2019t think that Zhao Yanzi\u2019s personality would gain any adoration from his grandma. If his grandma could like anyone, it would be Xie Yujia.Zhao Hongyu parked the car in the garage after they got back home, then she brought Hao Ren into the house. Hao Ren could barely imagine how a senior designer who drove a Ferrari to work could also do the grocery shopping at a local market every day and go home early to prepare dinner.After going into the kitchen and putting on an apron, Zhao Hongyu turned from an office lady to a kind and virtuous housewife. Hao Ren also went to the kitchen to help since he didn\u2019t have anything else to do, and Zhao Hongyu didn\u2019t stop him.In a few moments, Zhao Yanzi got home. She casually said hi to her mother and Hao Ren when she saw them in the kitchen, and she went upstairs to do her homework.After a while, Zhao Guang also came back home from work. He saw Hao Ren in the kitchen helping Zhao Hongyu wash vegetables and cut meat. He nodded approvingly and then went back to his study room to take care of more business.Inside this two-story ordinary-looking house, Zhao Yanzi was in her room doing homework miserably, Zhao Guang was seriously reviewing some documents in his study room, Zhao Hongyu was standing in front of the pot cooking food, and Hao Ren was beside Zhao Hongyu preparing the next dish.The entire atmosphere was so harmonious as if they were a real family.Delicious dishes were brought to the dinner table one by one. Hearing Zhao Hongyu\u2019s call, Zhao Yanzi put away her homework and happily went downstairs for dinner. Zhao Guang also came out of his study room and steadily walked towards the dinner table.The four of them sat around the dinner table, enjoying the delicious meal together. During dinner, Zhao Hongyu kept speaking well of how considerate Hao Ren was and how good he was at housework, and that made Zhao Yanzi pout out of jealousy.Not only Zhao Hongyu but also Zhao Guang who was observing Hao Ren was feeling more and more satisfied with this son-in-law he had \u201cpicked\u201d.Zhao Yanzi was the only one who still had heavy hostility against Hao Ren. She really didn\u2019t like the feeling when she thought about marrying this guy who was good at \u201cflattering\u201d her parents.However, when she thought of that pretty Class President in Hao Ren\u2019s class, she wasn\u2019t willing to give Hao Ren away. She believed that the Class President would take Hao Ren if she didn\u2019t want him.As usual, Hao Ren had to tutor Zhao Yanzi after dinner. He spent an hour systematically explaining the important English concepts to her and another hour on solving problems in other subjects.He no longer found the questions given by Zhao Yanzi unfamiliar or tough since he had already read some of her textbooks last night. He solved a bunch of questions continuously, and that impressed Zhao Yanzi a lot.\u201cThis guy seems to have a smart brain\u2026\u201d secretly staring at Hao Ren\u2019s smooth and round forehead, Zhao Yanzi concluded.She hated stupid people the most, but it seemed that Hao Ren wasn\u2019t that type.The two-hour tutoring session was over, and Hao Ren had to go back. Zhao Guang offered him a ride, but Hao Ren refused kindly. He packed up his tutoring materials and planned to hail a taxi. He didn\u2019t want to trouble Zhao Guang every time.\u201cEm\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi suddenly rushed downstairs as Hao Ren was about to walk out. She handed a few books to Hao Ren and said, \u201cI don\u2019t need them tomorrow, so you can bring them with you to read. Remember to bring them back tomorrow!\u201dHao Ren looked down and found out they were Biology and Geography textbooks. Seeing Hao Ren looking up at her, Zhao Yanzi\u2019s face blushed. She turned around and ran up the stairs as she shouted, \u201cRead carefully! Read seriously! It would be your fault if I get any questions wrong!\u201d\u201cThis girl\u2026\u201d Zhao Hongyu, who stood at the door with Hao Ren, shook her head and smiled, \u201cI was about to ask her to walk you out\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m going back now. There is no need for Uncle to drive me back; I know he is very busy with work,\u201d Hao Ren waved his hand at the door before he turned around and walked to the road.Zhao Hongyu nodded delightfully, feeling more and more satisfied with Hao Ren.When Hao Ren was on the taxi heading back to the university, he suddenly realized that the little girl Zhao Yanzi had never called him by his name; it was either \u201chey\u201d, \u201cthis\u201d, or \u201cthat\u201d\u2026Ah, what a failure\u2026As soon as he got back to the dorm and stepped onto the third floor, he heard someone yell, \u201cHao Ren is back!\u201dImmediately after that yell, all the guys rushed out of their dorms as if they had just heard there was an emergency. They surrounded Hao Ren and started bombarding him with their questions!\u201cWhat is your relationship with Su Han!\u201d\u201cShe actually put the necklace on for you, we all saw that!\u201d\u201cThat is the necklace! The one on his neck!\u201d\u201cLet me see! Let me see!\u201dWhile holding the plastic bag with all the tutoring materials in it, Hao Ren was tightly surrounded by them and was unable to move by a single step. They were so interested in the necklace that they tried to grab it one after another.Luckily this necklace was made out of some special material that could bear all the tugs and pulls. However, Hao Ren\u2019s neck couldn\u2019t take the painful pulling anymore. In this situation, no one could say for sure that some of them didn\u2019t do it out of jealousy and didn\u2019t want to take this opportunity to get their revenge.\u201cMove out of the way! Move!\u201d at this critical moment, Zhao Jiayi showed up with Zhou Liren and Cao Ronghua to rescue Hao Ren.They saved Hao Ren and walked him back to their dorm as if they were guarding an emperor. When they closed the door, the guys from the other dorms didn\u2019t give up that easily and continued to smack the door like crazy.\u201cThe news about Su Han giving you the necklace had already spread throughout the entire university! It is definitely a breaking news! You are screwed, dude!\u201d pushing Hao Ren against a chair, Zhao Jiayi said as he stared at Hao Ren.\u201cWhat the hell? It is just a necklace given by Su Han, how did it become such a big news?\u201d Hao Ren asked while rubbing his throbbing neck.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDon\u2019t try to quibble! Have you ever seen Su Han give a necklace to any other guy?! Plus\u2026 do you know what the biggest news is?\u201d Zhao Jiayi showed an extremely bright smile all of a sudden. \u201cHuang Xujie had heard about this news, and he went crazily mad! It turned out that bastard likes Su Han a lot!\u201d he shouted.He hooked his arm onto Hao Ren\u2019s neck and cheered, \u201cGood job Ren! You run faster than him, and you are even better at picking up girls than him!\u201dSeeing the extremely excited and gloated look on Zhao Jiayi\u2019s face, Hao Ren had no idea what to say.\u201cSu Han is a distant cousin of mine\u2026 probably nobody would believe in an explanation like this now\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cBeautiful Su Han!

It\u2019s me, Yu Rong!\u201d Yu Rong, from room 303 across the hall, banged on the door and yelled at the same time, \u201cWe\u2019re brothers! Don\u2019t close the door! Let me in to know the truth!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not opening the door!\u201d Zhao Jiayi yelled from the other side of the door, \u201cWe\u2019re not opening the door for anyone today. If you want to know, ask tomorrow!\u201dZhao Jiayi continued to yell when he heard them continue banging the door, \u201cOkay! Okay! Go back! Eight o\u2019clock tomorrow morning, room 302 will have a press conference! We\u2019ll explain everything clearly then!\u201dThere were still a lot of noises outside when they heard Zhao Jiayi\u2019s words. However, all the guys outside actually dispersed after hearing an answer.The hallways of the dorm were still filled with the discussions of the incident, but the overall situation started to die down. The female dorm manager was finally relieved because she was about to call security to control the situation.\u201cWe\u2019re all in the same dorm room, Ren. Tell us the truth, what\u2019s the relationship between Su Han and you?\u201d Zhao Jiayi faced Hao Ren and asked as the noises stopped outside.Cao Ronghua and Zhou Liren also dragged two chairs and sat across from Hao Ren. Two of them and Zhao Jiayi surrounded Hao Ren and were about to start the interrogation.\u201cSu Han is a distant cousin of mine,\u201d Hao Ren said helplessly.\u201cHow come you never mentioned this to us before?\u201d Zhao Jiayi immediately detected the flaw and asked.Hao Ren thought for a bit and said, \u201cI just found out recently as well. A relative came from overseas and treated me to a meal\u2026\u201dZhao Jiayi raised his arm and said, \u201cOkay, okay! This reason is outdated! How do you have so many relatives? Is the principal your relative too?\u201dHao Ren couldn\u2019t answer but smiled bitterly. \u201cThe vice-principal is somehow related to me, and you got half of that right\u2026\u201d he thought.Certainly, Zhao Jiayi and the other two knew Hao Ren for two years and definitely wouldn\u2019t think that Hao Ren came from a wealthy family with a significant background. Zhao Jiayi thought for a while and said, \u201cAnyhow, it is a fact that many people saw Su Han putting a necklace on for you. Even if she is your cousin, people won\u2019t buy it. It is better for you to say quiet and accept the rumors and dubious claims, or you\u2019ll create even more misunderstandings.\u201dHe continued to analyze, \u201cThe situation as of now is that unless Su Han explains everything herself, they wouldn\u2019t believe anything you say\u2026\u201d\u201cYup, yup, yup!\u201d Cao Ronghua and Zhou Liren stood beside Zhao Jiayi and agreed with what he had said.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible that Su Han will clarify this type of mess for me. I doubt that she would give a damn even if the fire was burning her house as long as it doesn\u2019t affect her cultivation,\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.\u201cSo, let\u2019s announce this tomorrow: you and Su Han are on good terms, but it\u2019s not exactly what they think it is. The crucial part of this statement is to piss off Huang Xujie. Afterward, when you have a chance to treat Su Han to dinner, we\u2019ll also tag along and get to know her\u2026,\u201d Zhao Jiayi followed up with the suggestion slowly.\u201cWhat the hell! That is what you guys are aiming for!\u201d Hao Ren understood what was going on as he listened to the very end.\u201cFine, we\u2019ll talk about treating her to dinner later,\u201d Zhao Jiayi didn\u2019t want to startle Hao Ren and quickly added.Hao Ren looked at them and knew that these three guys were up to no good. After all, they wanted to utilize his connection to approach Su Han.However, Hao Ren would like to see Huang Xujie in frustration. He also understood why Huang Xujie provoked him before the Athletic Games. The fact that Su Han called Hao Ren to her office caused Huang Xujie\u2019s extreme resentment.\u201cHumph, you think you can pursue Su Han as the son of the Deputy Mayor? You think Su Han is only an ordinary lecturer?\u201d Hao Ren thought.He knew that many third and fourth-year students had pursued Su Han publicly or privately. He also knew that some first and second-year students who were self-obsessed and had a wealthy family background wanted to go after Su Han as well.After all, Su Han was beautiful and otherworldly. Also, she was only two to three years older than them, and she actually looked much more youthful than those third and fourth-year female students.However, he didn\u2019t know that Huang Xujie had pursued unapproachable Su Han when she hadn\u2019t graduated and was the most popular girl at East Ocean University.Despite Huang Xujie\u2019s effort, Su Han ignored him. Additionally, because she didn\u2019t live in the dorms and was hard to find, this made Huang Xujie\u2019s pursuit end without a result.He initially thought that he wouldn\u2019t be able to see this beauty again after Su Han graduated. Unexpectedly, Su Han chose to stay at East Ocean University as an ordinary lecturer, and this allowed Huang Xujie to see hope again.Huang Xujie\u2019s pursuit of Su Han happened before Hao Ren\u2019s enrollment, and he hid this failure of his very well. Therefore, Zhao Jiayi and the junior students were very surprised when they found out that Huang Xujie liked Su Han.Huang Xujie went after Su Han for many years and didn\u2019t even receive a response, but Hao Ren, a new student, obtained Su Han\u2019s attention. How could Huang Xujie not be pissed off?The current most popular girl in the school, Lin Li, who got her title from the hypes and headlines, was much worse than Su Han.\u201cAlso, uh\u2026,\u201d Zhou Liren asked, \u201cWho\u2019s the woman who drove a Ferrari to pick you up today? She\u2019s so pretty\u2026 She also seemed prettier and more mature than Su Han\u2026 Ren, tell us, do you have a sugar mommy? You didn\u2019t even return to the dorm a few days ago\u2026\u201dAs he kept talking, his expression became nastier. Hao Ren quickly blocked his mouth with one hand as the other hand formed a fist and hit him on the head. \u201cShe\u2019s the mother of my student. Quit your dirty thoughts!\u201d he scolded.Zhou Liren got hit, but he didn\u2019t back off. Instead, he got closer to Hao Ren, rubbed his hands together, said in an obscene tone, \u201cBrother Ren! Brother Ren! I didn\u2019t know you are so good at getting girls. Teach me a few tricks!\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201d Hao Ren kicked him away.The next day morning, room 302 hosted a \u201cpress conference\u201d as promised. As the \u201cofficial spokesman\u201d, Zhao Jiayi raised both of his hands and stood at the highest point in the room\u2013 the upper berth close to the balcony.Hao Ren crossed his legs and sat on the upper berth, and Cao Ronghua and Zhou Liren tried to maintain order down below. Other curious guys stood in the narrow room, looked up at Zhao Jiayi and Hao Ren in their slippers.What press conference is this? No matter how one looked at it, the scene resembled that of migrant workers gathering to ask for their salaries.Zhao Jiayi utilized the art of language well and indicated that Hao Ren and Su Han\u2019s relationship was developing in a \u201cgood direction\u201d. He also tugged on the emotions of the guys and said that if Hao Ren and Su Han were on good terms, Su Han would come to the dorm often, especially the third floor. This turned the mood of the guys from jealousy to expectancy.Hence, the press conference had a perfect ending, and No.7 dorm\u2019s atmosphere was in great harmony. As a result, the guys were either washing their faces, brushing their teeth, or returning to their rooms for more sleep.The four people in Hao Ren\u2019s dorm room went to class together because today was Thursday. After Advanced Mathematics, it was Su Han\u2019s lecture on Weak Optical Signal Processing.Compared to before, the guys were more excited today because they wanted to see how Su Han would treat Hao Ren.However, to their disappointment, Su Han was as cold as before in the two-hour lecture and didn\u2019t make any eye contact with Hao Ren.After the lecture, Su Han packed up her notes and left as usual.\u201cThe Iceberg Beauty is still cold after all. You are too amazing to have the ability to approach someone like her!\u201d Zhou Liren gave Hao Ren a thumb up, and Zhao Jiayi and Cao Ronghua also admired him.As they packed up their textbooks, Class President Xie Yujia walked towards them and put something down on Hao Ren\u2019s desk.Hao Ren picked it up and looked at it. It was an envelope.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhou Liren\u2019s heart was pounding crazily as he stood beside Hao Ren. \u201cOh my god! No way! Hao Ren\u2019s peach blossom fortune is blooming! The Class President also gave Hao Ren a love letter?! What kind of world am I living in?\u201d he thought.Hao Ren didn\u2019t even think of it in that direction. While confused, Hao Ren opened up the envelope in front of Xie Yujia and drew out a piece of paper.There were only a few words on it.\u201cSee you on the field at 8 PM. \u2013 Huang Xujie.\u201d* Height Couldn\u2019t Endure the Coldness is a Chinese idiom that means as the higher status the person becomes, the true friend that he/she has will decrease.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, he didn\u2019t expect it to happen this soon and this direct.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Zhao Jiayi took the note from Hao Ren\u2019s hand as he felt something odd was going on.After he read the note, he shouted angrily, \u201cF*ck! He really dares to cause trouble! Ren, don\u2019t be scared. I will call a few of my guys to go with you tonight!\u201d\u201cShhh!\u201d Xie Yujia immediately stopped Zhao Jiayi and told him not to shout. She then turned to Hao Ren and said, \u201cI think I know why he is trying to talk to you. However, this thing between you and him can be fixed. Why don\u2019t I come with you tonight so that I can explain it peacefully to him and we can resolve it as quickly as possible?\u201d\u201cIt will be alright. Let\u2019s wait until tonight and see,\u201d Hao Ren took the note back from Zhao Jiayi and ripped it into pieces. Then, he threw it into the garbage bin behind the classroom.Xie Yujia got more anxious when she saw Hao Ren\u2019s calmness as she thought Hao Ren might do something irrational. She asked tentatively, \u201cYou and Su Han\u2019s relationship\u2026 isn\u2019t like the rumor, right?\u201dShe wasn\u2019t sure about the answer to her question. Since last time Zhao Yanzi came to school for the Athletic Games, Xie Yujia was more convinced that Hao Ren had a special relationship with Su Han. However, deep down, she still believed that Hao Ren wasn\u2019t the type of person who was capable of stirring up trouble. After all, he seemed like an honest guy.Especially after his performance at the Athletic Games, she had an entirely new appreciation for Hao Ren. She thought he was down to earth, brave, and also very humble.No matter what, it was her responsibility to make sure no one would take this opportunity to cause trouble, especially since Huang Xujie wasn\u2019t only the son of the Deputy Mayor but also a troublemaker at school. If Zhao Jiayi and the others were to start a fight with Huang Xujie, they would be the ones suffering more losses.\u201cSu Han is my distant cousin. The necklace she gave me was purely a gift,\u201d Hao Ren replied.Xie Yujia was relieved. \u201cHow stupid was I am to think that Su Han is Hao Ren\u2019s girlfriend?\u201d she thought.\u201cAlright. I will come with you tonight and clear things up with Huang Xujie,\u201d she said.\u201cThere is nothing to clear up,\u201d Hao Ren\u2019s words suddenly turned tough, \u201cWhen facing a guy like Huang Xujie, the more you let him bully you around, the more arrogant he becomes. Do you think telling him that nothing is going on between Su Han and me is going to solve this problem? Because he wants to be with Su Han, nobody can be close to her? Because he is the son of the Deputy Mayor, the entire school has to listen to him?\u201dXie Yujia was speechless after hearing Hao Ren\u2019s series of questions.In the end, Hao Ren packed his bag and stomped out of the classroom without saying whether he was going to go.\u201cRen, I will go with you tonight!\u201d Zhao Jiayi ran out of the classroom and called Hao Ren.\u201cWe will go too!\u201d Cao Ronghua and Zhou Liren both added.\u201cGo my *ss. I didn\u2019t say I\u2019m going to meet him,\u201d Hao Ren said.Zhao Jiayi thought Hao Ren felt powerless and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be scared! I will call a dozen of my guys! If Huang Xujie dares to fight us, we will fight back!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t stir up more trouble. I will fix my own problems. If I go just because he had told me to, that will be like me paying him respect,\u201d Hao Ren replied.\u201cIf you don\u2019t go, he will think you are afraid of him!\u201d Zhao Jiayi said emotionally as if he wanted to start a fight.\u201cHe lost in the long-distance race against me, so he is the one who should be embarrassed. Why should I be scared of him? If I am really scared of him, I wouldn\u2019t even compete against him in the first place!\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cYes! Screw that son of a b*tch. Let him wait on the field alone. What can he do about it!\u201d Cao Ronghua agreed.The four of them went to the cafeteria for lunch and then went to class as usual. Most of the courses in the second year were foundational courses. The schedule was busier as there was less free time between classes. After having experienced retaking failed courses during the first year, Hao Ren and his friends didn\u2019t dare to skip class again.After finishing Programming and C Language class in Academic Building D, all the afternoon classes were over. Like always, they were about to go to the Internet Cafe and play some games, and then have dinner at the Hongji Square before their night class \u2013 Principles of Marxism Philosophy.\u201cYou guys can go without me, I have something to do,\u201d Hao Ren said to the guys after they walked out of the classroom.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? If you are not coming, how are we going to team-up and play the 3C tactic?\u201d Zhou Liren complained as he had been planning his 3C tactic during classes.\u201cAnyways, I have something to do. You guys go have fun!\u201d Hao Ren waved at them and walked towards the opposite set of stairs to prevent Zhou Liren coming to get him.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go! It\u2019s fine if he is not coming!\u201d Zhao Jiayi said to guys as they all started walking down the stairs in excitement.Xie Yujia, who just walked out of the classroom, looked at the stairs on both sides and decided to follow Hao Ren.The \u2018thing\u2019 that Hao Ren said he had to do was actually to find Su Han at her office. Because of the interrogation, Hao Ren missed his chance to cultivate last night. Fortunately, there were no classes in the afternoon after 4 PM today, so Hao Ren could cultivate in Su Han\u2019s office for two hours to make up for yesterday\u2019s time.After crossing two bridges between the tall Academic Buildings, Hao Ren entered Academic Building F where all the teacher offices were. He walked up the stairs to the fourth floor and went towards Su Han\u2019s office. Along the way, Hao Ren had no idea Xie Yujia was secretly following him.When Hao Ren knocked on the door and entered Su Han\u2019s office, Xie Yujia was shocked, and there were no words to describe her feelings.\u201cYou were being followed, and yet you had no idea,\u201d the moment Hao Ren closed the door, Su Han, who was wearing a purple chiffon skirt with floral patterns on it, said with her eyes closed.\u201cOh?\u201d Hao Ren was slightly shocked. He opened the door and looked into the hallway, but he didn\u2019t see anybody there.\u201cClose the door, she is gone already,\u201d Su Han said lightly and opened her eyes.Hao Ren was perturbed as he closed the door, turned around, and looked at Su Han.Su Han was wearing a long purple chiffon skirt. The U-shaped neckline presented her sexy clavicle curve and plump chest lines.Because she was sitting cross-legged, her long beautiful legs were right in front of Hao Ren\u2019s eyes. Even her toes and glittering pink nails could be clearly seen.Also, the room was filled with a slight smell of incense which was very comforting.Su Han pointed at the window, and the closed curtains started to open up by itself. The green color and the peacefulness of the school appeared in front of Hao Ren\u2019s eyes, and the bright light wiped out all the dubious vibes in the room.\u201cLook at the nice view outside of the window instead of staring at me,\u201d Su Han\u2019s slightly opened her lips and said.Hao Ren\u2019s face turned red as he quickly moved his eyes away from Su Han\u2019s long pretty legs. \u201cI have only practiced half of the Spirit Concentration Scroll that Elder Lu gave me. I hope Su\u2026 Sister Su can guide me,\u201d he said.\u201cHuh,\u201d Su Han nodded, \u201clet me hear you recite the Spirit Concentration Scroll.\u201dHao Ren thought about it for a moment and started reciting it, \u201cThe road to earth and heaven, is wide, thick, high, clear, peaceful, long, and infinite. The sun, stars, moon are the things of the world. Containing the seas and rivers, yet they never leak. Everything is contained\u2026\u201d like reciting a poem back in middle school, Hao Ren recited everything he remembered in one try. He then looked at Su Han and waited for the next instruction.\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Su Han asked.\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Hao Ren replied.\u201cSo, Lu Qing only gave you the first chapter of the Spirit Concentration Scroll. No wonder you haven\u2019t made any progress after you have been cultivating for so long. That old guy, saying he would take care of everything, yet so careless,\u201d Su Han complained quietly. She then said to Hao Ren, \u201cI am going to read the next two chapters of the Spirit Concentration Scroll to you, listen carefully.\u201d\u201cWhether or not the validation is real, instead of guessing, open it and show it, or close it up entirely. Those who open it feel sympathy. Those who close it differentiates it sincerely. Whether to stay or to leave, it starts with one\u2019s ambition\u2026\u201d\u201cSuch as yin and yang, like circle and square. If there is no shape, the circle is the way. If there is shape, the square is the problem. Nothing is pre-determined. If things go wrong, the wrong path was chosen. Things aren\u2019t always right; feelings and integrity are forgotten\u2026\u201dSun Han\u2019s voice was clear and crisp and was lovely to listen to. Like a chain of pearls, each pearl was a word that came out of her mouth. Hao Ren sat down peacefully and listened carefully as he concentrated and memorized every single word.Almost 20 minutes had passed, and Su Han finished reading the last word of the Spirit Concentration Scroll. She asked Hao Ren, \u201cHave you memorized all of it?\u201dActually, Hao Ren wanted Su Han to read it all over again. Not because he couldn\u2019t remember, but because her voice was so lovely that he wanted to hear it again.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, he knew Su Han wasn\u2019t someone he would want to mess with. He was fortunate that she was willing to guide him already. Therefore, Hao Ren wouldn\u2019t dare to push his luck. If she found out what he was trying to play tricks, he would be the one to die first.\u201cYes, all memorized,\u201d Hao Ren answered honestly.\u201cAlright then, you can start cultivating by yourself,\u201d Su Han said coldly and started cultivating with her eyes closed again.If she didn\u2019t think Hao Ren was hard-working, she wouldn\u2019t spend all this time reading the basics of the Spirit Concentration Scroll to him patiently. Instead, she would\u2019ve smacked all these cultivation techniques into his brain and have gotten it over with.However, she didn\u2019t know that even though Hao Ren did not have the second or third chapter of the technique, he had almost gotten to the second level of the Concentration Cultivation Techniques by touching the stone monument at the Taoist Temple and communicating with the earth and heaven.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 52: Well, Masters? Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedBlue smoke floated from the incense burner, and the office was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.Su Han was meditating, and the blue smoke from the incense burner floated around her without being disturbed. She looked as if she had stopped breathing, and even her eyelashes were frozen still.Stealthily, Hao Ren observed the beauty who looked like a photoshopped beauty in Online Gaming Commercial. It suddenly occurred to him that with her capabilities, she would know that he was looking at her even with her eyes closed. At this thought, he looked away in a hurry and silently recited the first chapter of the Spirit Concentration Scroll three times. After that, he closed his eyes and tried to understand the second chapter.The second chapter corresponded with the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll. When Lu Qing taught Hao Ren the cultivation technique, he didn\u2019t expect Hao Ren to break through the first level so soon. He was afraid that Hao Ren would rush through the process and thus had only taught him the first chapter. Later, Lu Qing was immersed in businesses and had planned to check up on Hao Ren\u2019s cultivation progress in one month.However, he didn\u2019t know that Zhao Guang had personally given tips to Hao Ren, and Hao Ren\u2019s talent was better than he had thought. Therefore, Hao Ren had to stumble around without the second chapter of Spirit Concentration Scroll. On the other hand, Zhao Guang thought Lu Qing had taught Hao Ren the whole Spirit Concentration Scroll, a basic cultivation technique, so he didn\u2019t teach Hao Ren the second chapter either; he just gave Hao Ren some tips.It was like you telling a student to go to class without giving him or her a textbook and the student had to learn all the concepts through the practices. Without a systematic understanding of the structure, only the super smart kids could get a good mark.Immerged in the second chapter, Hao Ren gradually entered a meditation state and was oblivious to everything around him.The clock on the wall showed 6 o\u2019clock. Sensing that the time was up, Su Han was about to open her eyes and send Hao Ren back. Suddenly, something was wrong.A massive pile of white clouds had accumulated above the top of the Academic Building F, and the clouds formed a tremendous and colossal vortex!The five elements nearby began to move violently, and even the soundproof array formation she built around her office was unstable!\u201cA powerful enemy is here!\u201d Su Han thought as she opened her glinting eyes. With a wave of her palm, a blue sword appeared in her hand.She was about to stand up and leap up into the air when the weird fluctuations suddenly vanished. The large vortex of clouds that were above the building and the whole campus suddenly dispersed.At this moment, Hao Ren, who was sitting across from Su Han, opened his eyes slowly and said shyly, \u201cSister Su, it seems that I have broken through the level.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Su Han stared at him blankly.She put away the blue sword and grabbed Hao Ren\u2019s arm. She immediately sensed that Hao Ren\u2019s body contained a little nature essence; it was empty before.Relieved, she let go of Hao Ren\u2019s hand with a bit of astonishment as she blushed.She blushed not because she grabbed Hao Ren\u2019s arm but because she, a Heavenly-level master, had panicked.Fortunately, she knew Hao Ren didn\u2019t see her panic, and the turmoil in her mind began to calm down.At that moment, alarmed Lu Qing barged into the room. \u201cMs. Su! Did you see that?\u201dSu Han turned around and said lightly, \u201cDon\u2019t panic, Elder Lu. It was just Hao Ren breaking through the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll!\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Lu Qing\u2019s expression changed from being alarmed to embarrassment to calm and then to pleasantly surprised. \u201cMr. Hao broke through the second level?!\u201d\u201cYes. He was cultivating here, and he just broke through,\u201d Su Han said calmly, keeping her usual aloofness.\u201cMs. Su is indeed a master of cultivation. Under your guidance, Mr. Hao has broken through the second level so fast!\u201d Standing at the door, Lu Qing praised sincerely. Inside, he was amazed that Su Han was unfazed by the sudden change, and he was ashamed of himself for panicking and rushing to Su Han at the slightest movement.\u201cIt was no big deal.\u201d Su Han sounded calm.\u201cThen I will leave you guys alone. I\u2019m sorry that I barged in thinking something serious had happened\u2026\u201d embarrassed, Lu Qing kept berating himself as he backed out of Su Han\u2019s office.After Lu Qing left, Su Han had also regained her composure. \u201cGood. Lu Qing also panicked, and he shared my embarrassment. Anyway, I still have to work on my composure,\u201d she thought.Seeing Lu Qing barging in and then backing out apologetically, Hao Ren was confused and asked, \u201cSister Su, what happened?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me Sister Su. Call me Su Han,\u201d Su Han said coldly.Hao Ren obeyed her. \u201cSu Han, what happened?\u201d he asked.He felt weird calling her by her full name. But on second thought, a difference of a couple of years in age was no big deal for the dragons who could live for hundreds of years.\u201cYour breakthrough of the second level caused a slight phenomenon in the sky. Lu Qing thought something happened and came here to check with me,\u201d Su Han dismissed the incident lightly.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Hao Ren looked up at the clock. \u201cTime is almost up, and I\u2019ve got to go since I have class tonight. If I have time tomorrow, I will come here to continue my cultivation,\u201d he said.\u201cOk,\u201d Su Han nodded coldly.Looking at Hao Ren who was walking out, Su Han thought, \u201cThis guy is such a quick learner.\u201d\u201cAlthough his breakthrough was unexpected, my startled reaction was uncalled for. I have to work harder on my composure\u2026\u201d she thought.With a wave of her hand, the soundproof array formation was activated again. She closed her eyes and entered her cultivation state\u2026With books in his hand, Hao Ren hurried to the lecture hall in Academic Building C as class was just about to begin.\u201cRen!\u201d Zhao Jiayi, sitting in the last row, waved at Hao Ren.Hao Ren hurried over and found that his three buddies had reserved a seat for him.\u201cWhere have you been? We had a great time playing the 3C tactic! We completely destroyed those four guys in Yu Rong\u2019s dorm!\u201d Zhou Liren told Hao Ren excitedly.\u201cI went out of the school for an errand and didn\u2019t have time to eat dinner,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cDid you see the vortex of clouds above the school? It was almost as big as the basketball court!\u201d Zhao Jiayi asked Hao Ren.\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t see it. Is it still there?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cIt lasted only a few seconds, and I didn\u2019t even have time to dig out my phone to take a picture. Cao Ronghua and I saw it when we were on our way to class,\u201d Zhao Jiayi said.Before Hao Ren could ask more about it, roll call had begun. Since it was a big class of over 100 students, the teacher did it randomly. The teacher was quite cunning, and he would call out the names of those students who were close. For example, if he called Hao Ren\u2019s name, he would definitely call the names of Zhao Jiayi, Zhou Liren, and Cao Ronghua. In this case, it would be impossible for Zhao Jiayi and the other two to answer the call for Hao Ren if the latter was absent.Today, Hao Ren was lucky since he was the first name to be called among the hundreds of students. As predicted, Zhao Jiayi, Cao Ronghua, and Zhou Liren\u2019s names were also called one after the other.\u201cLuckily we are all here! I guess we won\u2019t be called next time, so we can skip the next class,\u201d Zhao Jiayi said after raising his hand and shouted \u201chere!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cRen, it seems like many girls are looking back at you,\u201d Cao Ronghua, whose name had also been called, leaned towards Hao Ren and whispered.Hao Ren raised his head and looked forward. Indeed, many people were looking back at him.\u201cIs it because the teacher called my name?\u201d he thought.He listened carefully and overheard some glimpse of conversations, \u201cSo he is Hao Ren\u2026Oh, he is the guy who outran Huang Xujie at the Athletic Games\u2026 He seems to be close to Su Han\u2026 Did you know that Huang Xujie has called him out for a fight tonight on the field\u2026 When\u2026 Eight o\u2019clock tonight after this class\u2026\u201dHao Ren felt a little uncomfortable after seeing more and more glances cast toward him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He bumped Hao Ren with his arm and said, \u201cRen, it seems like you are quite popular.\u201d\u201cWhatever,\u201d Hao Ren lifted his book as a shield and lowered his head behind it to avoid being looked at.Hao Ren was now well-known as Huang Xujie\u2019s rival and Su Han\u2019s \u201cboyfriend\u201d; any one of those titles would result in him being in the center of the attention.\u201cWe\u2019ll watch a good show tonight.\u201d\u201cI guess Huang Xujie will teach him a good lesson!\u201dThe conversations continued.\u201cHuang Xujie is a vicious guy. He called you out for a fight and then spread the news to everyone,\u201d sitting next to Hao Ren, Zhao Jiayi commented with a fierce frown.\u201cIgnore him. He thrives on attention,\u201d Hao Ren rested his head on the desk and said.For some unknown reason, he felt tired and desperately wanted to take a nap after breaking through the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll. He was in a hurry when he left Su Han\u2019s office and didn\u2019t ask her if this was a typical reaction.Compared with the business of the Dragon Tribe, Hao Ren thought the incident with Huang Xujie was trivial and not worthy of his attention. It was like a man who had hundreds of millions of yuan wouldn\u2019t care if he had lost 20 yuan on the street.\u201cSu Han can easily destroy me if I don\u2019t work hard on cultivating. That is the real danger\u2026\u201d Hao Ren sighed and clutched his head in his hands.They sat in the last row which was next to the windows at the back of the classroom. Hao Ren regulated his breathing and re-entered the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll as he carefully tried to understand the essence between the heaven and the earth.The nature essence which had been running around him was now being sucked into his body, and the parts that couldn\u2019t be fully absorbed were tossed out. This process repeated continuously.Hao Ren found the Dragon Core that he had swallowed begin to respond to the circulation of nature essence flow. Under the repeated rush of nature essence, it started to automatically store the nature essence in Hao Ren\u2019s limbs and other parts of his body.\u201cThe Dragon Core is indeed impressive\u2026\u201d Hao Ren was amazed.The nine main acupoints in his body were slowly absorbing pure nature essence, giving him an indescribable pleasure.\u201cHow can this guy fall asleep when there is trouble waiting for him tonight\u2026\u201d Zhao Jiayi felt resigned when he saw Hao Ren closing his eyes.\u201cAuch!\u201d Hao Ren yelled suddenly, and his head bounced up from his desk.Seeing the teacher and students sitting in front of him all looking toward the last row, he lowered his head in a hurry and pretended to act innocent. Luckily, most of them didn\u2019t know who had yelled.The teacher paused his lecture and berated the students without a specific target. Without catching the troublemaker, the teacher had to resume the class.Seeing that everything had settled down, Zhao Jiayi reached out and touched Hao Ren. \u201cHey, why did you yell?\u201d he asked.\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d Hao Ren gritted his teeth and waved his hand at Zhao Jiayi.A moment ago, the nine acupoints in his body suddenly hurt like hell as if someone was piercing needles into him. Now, his whole body was in so much pain that he felt like he was being split apart.Seeing Hao Ren sweating in pain, Zhao Jiayi was alarmed. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d he asked.\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d Hao Ren held his breath and pressed his clenched fists against the desk; he felt acute pain in every inch of his bones.Now he knew that the listlessness and sleepiness a moment ago and the tumbling of his organs and bones that happened just now were all parts of the process of cultivation.\u201cSo painful\u2026 Even cultivating the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll, which is the most basic cultivation technique, is so painful. Can I survive on the rest of the cultivation path?\u201d Hao Ren gritted his teeth while those thoughts crossed his mind.The pain was finally over after a dozen deep breaths. Hao Ren looked down at his sweat-soaked shirt and then turned to Zhao Jiayi, Zhou Liren, and Cao Ronghua who were staring at him with astonishment and concern in their eyes.\u201cI\u2019m fine now. I had a cramp,\u201d Hao Ren explained.\u201cMan, it was an artistic cramp! Your whole body was twisting,\u201d Cao Ronghua said.With a bitter smile, Hao Ren swept a palm over his sweaty face, thinking that the pain was not less excruciating than the cruel ancient tortures.He now understood why Zhao Yanzi, the only daughter of a Dragon King, was so weak in terms of cultivation. One reason was that she couldn\u2019t focus her attention, and the other was that she couldn\u2019t withstand the pain.He remembered her words about the dangers of cultivation, \u201cThe least danger was the loss of limbs and the worst danger was death.\u201dAlthough the path of cultivation wasn\u2019t as scary as she had described, the risks were indeed high.Then, he suddenly thought of Su Han who was also a female but had become a Heavenly-level Master in her twenties. That not only required unusual talent but great fortitude as well.In her office, Su Han looked up at the clock and murmured to herself, \u201cWell, the pain should have passed. If he couldn\u2019t withstand such small hardships, he will never make it through in the future.\u201dThen she put away the bottle of small golden pills she had in her hand.In the lecture hall in Academic Building C, Hao Ren, who was hardly in the circle of cultivation yet, was oblivious to the fact that there were pills that could alleviate such pain.He stretched and found that every joint in his body was more flexible, and his strength had reached its peak level.\u201cDon\u2019t you think that Hao Ren is a bit taller all of a sudden?\u201d Zhou Liren, who was sitting farthest from Hao Ren, asked Cao Ronghua in a whisper.Cao Ronghua turned to look at Hao Ren. He didn\u2019t think Hao Ren had grown taller but believed that Hao Ren\u2019s presence was different.His skin was smoother, his eyes were brighter, and even his hair was softer\u2026\u201cDamn! Am I into him now?\u201d Cao Ronghua shivered in discomfort.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAfter careful considerations, I think tonight you should\u2026\u201d Zhao Jiayi turned to speak to Hao Ren and paused in the middle of his sentence.For a second, Zhao Jiayi thought the guy sitting next to him was someone else. He looked again and realized that the guy was indeed Hao Ren.\u201cAm I hallucinating, or Hao Ren suddenly became more handsome all of a sudden?\u201d Zhao Jiayi wondered and totally forgot what he was going to say.At that moment, Hao Ren\u2019s mobile phone vibrated.He thought it was Xie Yujia calling to ask him about tonight\u2019s fight, but when he answered it, he heard Uncle Wang\u2019s anxious voice. \u201cRen!

He was only enraged when Hao Ren was gone. \u201cThe students nowadays are so rude! They are so audacious that they think they can leave the classroom in the middle of the class without giving any explanations to the teacher!\u201d he thought.Hao Ren dashed out of the Academic Building toward the main gate of the school while he spoke on the phone, \u201cUncle Wang, don\u2019t panic. Did you call the hospital close to the cottage and ask them to pick up my grandma?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t find their phone number,\u201d Uncle Wang sounded extremely agitated.Lamenting silently at the muddle-headedness of Uncle Wang, Hao Ren dashed out of the school\u2019s main gate and tried to grab a taxi.Since the school was in the suburbs and it was almost 8\u2019o clock at night, there were many taxis in the area.He stood there for a while before spotting several taxis, but they all had passengers in them.In the half-minute that he tried to grab a taxi, Hao Ren kept talking to Uncle Wang. However, this half-minute seemed to be longer than a century!He even thought about jumping into the middle of the street and stopping a random car.While he was as agitated as an ant on a hot oven, he tried to calm Uncle Wang down over the phone.In the height of anxiety, he saw a red car driving past him and suddenly remembered the dashing sight of Zhao Hongyu in her red Ferrari.Zhao Hongyu! Hao Ren thought of a sudden idea.\u201cUncle Wang, I\u2019ll hang up now since I need to call for help. Call me when the situation changes,\u201d Hao Ren ended the call and fumbled through his contact list. After finding Zhao Hongyu\u2019s number, he dialed it.When Hao Ren accompanied Zhao Yanzi up the mountain on that weekend trip, Zhao Hongyu gave him her number in case of an emergency. He hadn\u2019t used it until now.Usually, he wouldn\u2019t bother Zi\u2019s parents. Since this situation was urgent and his parents were still abroad, the only people Hao Ren could think of now were Zhao Yanzi\u2019s parents.The phone beeped six times, and no one answered. Hao Ren was so agitated that his palm holding the phone began to sweat.\u201cHello?\u201d the phone was suddenly answered, and Zhao Hongyu\u2019s gentle voice came through the phone.\u201cAuntie! It\u2019s me!\u201d Hao Ren shouted urgently.\u201cOh, it\u2019s you, Ren. Why didn\u2019t you come here and tutor Zi today? I was going to call you to ask about it,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said.\u201cI have class tonight, and I skipped class to tutor Zi last week. I told Zi yesterday.\u201d Hao Ren explained in his mind. Right now, he had no time to explain this to Zhao Hongyu. He said urgently, \u201cIt\u2019s my grandma. She\u2026\u201dFor some reason, Hao Ren was so moved after hearing Zhao Hongyu\u2019s voice that he got choked up.\u201cWhat happened? Don\u2019t panic. Take it easy,\u201d sensing the agitation in Hao Ren\u2019s voice over the phone, Zhao Hongyu was alarmed.\u201cMy grandma fainted due to high blood pressure, and she needs to be taken to the hospital. However, Uncle Wang, the caretaker of my grandma, doesn\u2019t drive,\u201d Hao Ren exhaled and cleared his head before explaining the situation.\u201cGive me the address, and I\u2019ll go over now!\u201d Zhao Hongyu said immediately.\u201cBlue Sea and Golden Sand Resort in the southern suburb of East Ocean City. The number of the cottage is 16. It\u2019s the sixth cottage on the right after you enter the south gate,\u201d Hao Ren said. His heart latched in his throat, and his arm holding the phone shook violently.\u201cGot it! I\u2019ll be there soon. We will keep in touch!\u201d Zhao Hongyu hung up, and it seemed like she had already run to the garage.Lowering the phone from his ear, Hao Ren stood at the main gate of the school, not knowing what to do next. The road ahead was dark, and the cars driving past him shined into that darkness.Buzz\u2026 His mobile phone vibrated. Hao Ren immediately answered it and heard Zhao Guang\u2019s deep voice, \u201cAre you at school? I\u2019m on my way and will pick you up at the gate in about ten minutes.\u201dHao Ren said \u201cOk,\u201d and the phone call ended.He stood on the empty place in front of the main gate, feeling the cold wind penetrate his shirt.Snap! Snap!Under the force of the strong night winds, the big banner hanging over the gate danced with a loud snapping sound.Hao Ren turned his head and looked at the banner with sudden resentment.Squeal! A black Chevrolet stopped before Hao Ren.Zhao Guang stuck his face out from the window and said, \u201cGet in the car, and we can wait for the news at home.\u201dNodding numbly, Hao Ren got in the car and found that Zhao Yanzi was also there.She looked at Hao Ren with concern and sympathy; it seemed like she was worried about Hao Ren and came with her dad to pick him up.Steadily, Zhao Guang started the car and drove toward their home. It was not a long ride from their home to East Ocean University.Pale-faced, Hao Ren sat in the car and thought for a while before asking Zhao Guang, \u201cHow did auntie go there?\u201d\u201cShe drove,\u201d Zhao Guang answered.Hao Ren was a little disappointed since he had expected Zhao Hongyu to use her superpower and fly there.As if he had read Hao Ren\u2019s mind, Zhao Guang continued, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It doesn\u2019t take much longer for your auntie to drive there than to fly. We have a lot of restrictions on flying. If she encounters an Inspector, a lot of time will be wasted on answering questions. Besides, if she flew there, she couldn\u2019t bring your grandma to the hospital.\u201d\u201cRight,\u201d Hao Ren nodded as he felt grateful for the help of Zhao Yanzi and her family. He just hoped that his grandma was ok.It took only a dozen minutes to drive from East Ocean University to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s home. Zhao Guang parked the car and brought Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi into the house.The cozy and familiar setting slightly calmed down Hao Ren\u2019s agitated nerves.He took out his mobile phone and called home again. Uncle Wang answered the call, and Hao Ren immediately asked about his grandma.\u201cA woman just arrived and claimed to be your friend. She applied some first aid to your grandma and carried her into a car. She drove away less than a minute ago, and I was so agitated that I forgot to ask her name,\u201d Uncle Wang told him over the phone.\u201cWell, Uncle Wang, although good at cooking, is not someone you can depend on in an emergency,\u201d Hao Ren lamented about Uncle Wang\u2019s clumsiness in his mind as he comforted him over the phone and hung up.Uncle Wang panicked when Hao Ren\u2019s grandma got sick. He couldn\u2019t find the hospital\u2019s phone number and didn\u2019t know how to deal with the crisis. He even needed Hao Ren, who was far away at school, to direct him, and he didn\u2019t even ask for the stranger\u2019s name before letting the stranger take Hao Ren\u2019s grandma away\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHao Ren became more and more agitated when thinking about this. He thought it was quite unsafe to let Uncle Wang continue taking care of his grandma alone, and he berated himself for not being able to help his grandma when she was in danger.With a frown, he looked up at the clock, thinking that it was quite fast for Zhao Hongyu to get to the cottage at the seaside in just 20 minutes.Zhao Guang and Zhao Yanzi sat together with Hao Ren in the living room instead of tending to their own businesses.About another 20 minutes later, the phone in the living room rang abruptly.Zhao Guang picked up the phone and listened. He turned to Hao Ren and said, \u201cHongyu has taken your grandma to the Eastern Hospital in the city, and she is being treated. The doctor said she would be fine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He got in touch with Zhao Hongyu and found out that Hao Ren\u2019s grandma was in stable condition and was placed on a hospital bed.They walked along the stairs and through the quiet corridors. Then, they reached the room Zhao Hongyu mentioned.There were four beds in the room, and three of the beds were taken by other elderly patients as well. Zhao Hongyu didn\u2019t want Zhao Yanzi to get noisy, so she made shushing gesture to her before they entered.Hao Ren\u2019s grandma was lying flat on the bed, and she had an intravenous drip in her arm \u2013 it was the saline solution. Her eyes were closed, and her breathing seemed regular. The wrinkles on her face were like the valleys between the hills.\u201cThe doctor says she will be fine after resting for two days,\u201d Zhao Hongyu stepped forward and said to Hao Ren softly.\u201cThank you, Auntie!\u201d Hao Ren was relieved and walked over to take a look at his grandma.\u201cSince this was an emergency, she was put into a standard ward like this. I will talk to them tomorrow and see if they can transfer her into a single room,\u201d Zhao Hongyu whispered to Hao Ren from behind.\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d Hao Ren turned around, having no idea how to thank her.\u201cI need to pay for a bunch of speeding tickets tomorrow, but I have an appointment with Phillip Stark because he wants to visit my studio. So, I won\u2019t have time to pay\u2026\u201d Zhao Hongyu whispered into Zhao Guang\u2019s ear.Hao Ren sat beside the bed and looked carefully at his grandma. He caught what Zhao Hongyu was whispering about, and he thought about how she helped him out even though they were not related. He was incredibly grateful towards her.\u201cLet me pay for the tickets, auntie,\u201d he turned to Zhao Hongyu and said.She was surprised at how sharp Hao Ren\u2019s hearing was. After a short moment of pause, she shook her head and smile, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. There are only two or three of them.\u201dZhao Guang looked at Hao Ren and thought for a bit. Then he asked, \u201cDid you break through the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll, Ren?\u201dHao Ren nodded. He was so worried about his grandma that he forgot to mention the good news to Zhao Guang.\u201cNo wonder I sensed something different about you. Your five senses have gotten sharper too,\u201d Zhao Guang suddenly understood.\u201cFive senses?\u201d Hao Ren was confused.\u201cYes, five senses \u2013 seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching,\u201d Zhao Guang explained.Hao Ren didn\u2019t feel anything special, but since Zhao Guang said they were enhanced, then that must have been the case.Zhao Yanzi, who was beside Hao Ren, looked at him in surprise. She thought, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long, and he has already broken through the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll? I ate elixirs at home as if they were candy and barely got to Kan-level.\u201d\u201cYou should keep your grandma company since she is alright. Zi has school tomorrow, so I\u2019m going to take her back home. Oh, I have already paid for the hospitalization and treatment fees, and I also paid 6000 yuan in additional deposits. She can take her time to recover here, and I\u2019ll come by tomorrow if I have some time,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said to Hao Ren.\u201cI\u2019ll pay you back. Thank you, Auntie!\u201d Hao Ren said sincerely.\u201cIt\u2019s not much money so don\u2019t worry about it. Taking care of her is your priority,\u201d Zhao Hongyu took Zhao Yanzi by the arm, and the three of them left.Hao Ren stayed in the ward, waiting for his grandma to wake up. She finally came to her senses at midnight when Hao Ren was about to fall asleep.\u201cRen! She called out softly as soon as she saw him beside her bed.Hao Ren was suddenly woken up by her voice, and he rubbed his eyes to have a better look. When he saw his grandma awakening up, he called out in excitement, \u201cGrandma!\u201dThen, he immediately covered his mouth as he remembered that there were still other elders in the room.\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d his grandma asked.\u201cYou fainted at home, so we took you to the hospital,\u201d Hao Ren answered lightly.\u201cOh, I remember now. I was cleaning the house\u2026 but I don\u2019t remember what happened next,\u201d she raised her skinny arm and pinched her forehead as she continued, \u201cWhy are you here? Shouldn\u2019t you be in school?\u201dHao Ren told her exactly what had happened. However, he replaced Zhao Hongyu\u2019s identity of \u201cmother-in-law\u201d to \u201chis student\u2019s mom.\u201d\u201cIn that case, they are a family of good people. I must go thank them in person after I recover.\u201d Grandma sighed.She was too weak to keep up their conversation, so he persuaded her to rest some more since he didn\u2019t want her to pass out again.When she looked at her filial grandson, she was delighted and forgot about her health condition.At sunrise, a nurse brought over breakfast, and Hao Ren took it from her and fed his grandma carefully.\u201cRen, today is Friday, so you still need to go to school, right?\u201d Grandma asked as Hap Ren lifted up a spoon full of soup.\u201cIt\u2019s ok. I can take a day off to keep you company,\u201d Hao Ren said immediately.He was planning to go back on the weekend to keep his grandma company, but he didn\u2019t think that something like this would happen. Hao Ren felt guilty when he thought about his grandma being home alone when Uncle Wang wasn\u2019t very good at taking care of her.However, his grandma\u2019s words reminded him of Zhao Jiayi and the guys. He called them up and told them to help him out. That meant if a teacher took attendance, Zhao Jiayi and the guys would need to inform the teacher of the situation.Grandma had to keep having her intravenous drip today, and Hao Ren went back and forth as a filial grandson; he washed towels and peeled apples for her, doing whatever he could.In the afternoon, Hao Ren received a text message from Xie Yujia, asking about his grandma\u2019s condition. Hao Ren knew she must have overheard Zhao Jiayi when he explained it to the teacher, and this message was her way of caring for him.Although it was only a friendly text, Hao Ren was still a bit moved by it.Grandma saw Hao Ren hesitating on his cell phone, so she laughed, \u201cIs it your girlfriend?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d he laughed and typed in \u201cThank you for asking\u201d after a few seconds of hesitation.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s normal to have a girlfriend at your age,\u201d Grandma kindly brought up the old topic again.Hao Ren knew that she had the traditional concepts of the suburb farmers and believed that boys should start dating at the age of 20 and get married before they turn 25. However, given her age, it was understandable that she wanted to have a granddaughter-in-law as soon as possible. Therefore, he didn\u2019t argue with her.The strange thing was, Xie Yujia would always pop up in his head whenever his grandma brought up this topic. It was as if his instinct had been telling him that a smart and understanding girl like her would be the type of granddaughter-in-law his grandma would like.\u201cBut if you do have a girlfriend, she would probably be visiting me now that I am sick, right?\u201d Grandma didn\u2019t want to let this topic slip, so she kept asking tentatively.As she finished her sentence, Zhao Yanzi entered the room curiously. She was in her blue school uniform and had the pink backpack on her back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedWhen she saw Hao Ren and his grandmother in the room, she confirmed that she didn\u2019t walk into the wrong ward. She walked towards Hao Ren slowly, turned to his grandmother on the hospital bed, and asked softly, \u201cGrandma, do you feel better?\u201d\u201cHaha, I feel a lot better,\u201d Grandmother replied. Turning around, she asked Hao Ren, \u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, she\u2019s Zhao Yanzi, the little girl who I\u2019ve been tutoring recently. You fainted last night, and her mother took you to the hospital,\u201d Hao Ren replied.Hearing that Hao Ren called her a little girl, Zhao Yanzi pouted unwillingly.\u201cSo, this is my little savior!\u201d Grandma looked at Zhao Yanzi with appreciation. \u201cCome here and let grandma have a good look at you!\u201d she said.Zhao Yanzi came closer to the hospital bed when she saw Grandma waving at her.Grandma narrowed her slightly-cloudy eyes and observed Zhao Yanzi happily. After she saw this little girl with the ponytail being so delicate and cute, it struck her soft spot as an elder. She gently stroked Zhao Yanzi\u2019s head and said, \u201cThis little one is so pretty!\u201dZhao Yanzi smiled as she heard Grandma\u2019s compliment. Her eyes curved like a bright half-moon, and that made Grandma like her even more.\u201cRen, little Zi is my savior. You have to work harder when tutoring her in the future!\u201d Grandma stroke the head of this cute porcelain doll-like girl and said to Hao Ren.Zhao Yanzi heard her words and looked at Hao Ren with pride as if she obtained the Shangfang Sword 1 . Hao Ren could only nod his head.\u201cBy the way, why are you here?\u201d Hao Ren looked at Zhao Yanzi and asked.\u201cI only have a half day of school on Fridays. I got off early and wanted to come to take a look,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said.Even though she spoke calmly, Hao Ren knew she was worried about his grandma and came to see her. He looked at Zhao Yanzi and thought, \u201cEven though this little girl is harsh when she speaks, she is kind-hearted.\u201cHave you eaten lunch yet?\u201d Hao Ren asked her.\u201cGoing to go home and eat,\u201d she answered.\u201cI\u2019m going to buy lunch for Grandma. Do you want me to get something for you too?\u201d Hao Ren asked. He knew that Zhao Guang had work today and Zhao Hongyu might be busy welcoming a foreigner. If Zhao Yanzi went back home now, there wouldn\u2019t be anything for her to eat.Zhao Yanzi thought for a bit and left her backpack on the chair beside the hospital bed. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d she said.Grandma lied on the hospital bed, listened to their conversation quietly, and thought, \u201cThis little girl is great.\u201dHowever, she could never think that this lovely girl was her granddaughter-in-law.Zhao Yanzi and Hao Ren went downstairs, walked to the restaurant near the hospital, bought three meals, and returned. Perhaps Hao Ren was surprised by Zhao Yanzi\u2019s voluntary visit; he felt like this girl wasn\u2019t as inconsiderate as before.When they returned, a few nurses were planning to change Hao Ren\u2019s grandma into a different room. It was because Zhao Hongyu used her friend\u2019s connection and talked to the hospital\u2019s superintendent, and that was why the hospital was moving Hao Ren\u2019s Grandma from a general ward to the best private room.Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi helped carry some items and followed the nurses and Grandma to a south-facing private room with better air quality.Seeing Zhao Yanzi carrying a bunch of stuff in her hands, Hao Ren had a more favorable impression of her.A nurse pulled the curtains to the sides, and the bright sunshine from the garden outside immediately brightened the whole room. This was definitely one of the best places in the hospital.\u201cLunchtime, Grandma!\u201d after his grandma settle down, Hao Ren brought her lunch to her.\u201cYou guys eat too. Don\u2019t starve yourselves!\u201d Grandma said while looking at Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi. She felt like this Zi, as Hao Ren\u2019s student, had helped out more than enough today.Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi opened their lunch boxes. Zhao Yanzi was craving for the braised pork in Hao Ren\u2019s lunch box, so Hao Ren had to give it to her.Grandma was slightly confused when she saw them fighting but yet also being very intimate.After lunch, Hao Ren asked the nurse to change the saline solution and watched Grandma as she fell asleep. Zhao Yanzi was going to go home, but she stayed because she thought this room was wide and comfortable, and she started to do her homework here.At the table in front of the window, Zhao Yanzi\u2019s body seemed to become more feminine under the sunshine. Through the light, her curvature in the blue school uniform was perfect, and her arms underneath the sleeves seemed translucent and cute.Hao Ren sat beside her and answered all of her questions patiently. Their bodies formed a pair of shadows, cuddling on the floor of the room.Time passed by, and Zhao Yanzi finished half of the weekend\u2019s homework with Hao Ren\u2019s assistance. A few of her textbooks were still at Hao Ren\u2019s place, and Hao Ren could only return them to her on Monday.\u201cAh they changed the room\u2026,\u201d a gentle voice sounded. Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi turned their heads around and saw Zhao Hongyu appear in business attire at the door.\u201cWhy are you here, Zi?\u201d she was slightly shocked when she saw Zhao Yanzi.From Zhao Hongyu\u2019s expression, Hao Ren was positive that visiting Grandma was Zhao Yanzi\u2019s own idea.\u201cUm, I came here to visit Hao Ren\u2019s grandma,\u201d Zhao Yanzi packed up her homework and said.Zhao Hongyu smiled in gratification. She probably felt as if Zhao Yanzi had suddenly grown up.Hao Ren saw that there were a bunch of fruits and dietary supplements in her hands, and he walked over quickly and said, \u201cWhy did you buy so many things for us, Auntie?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Zhao Hongyu smiled as she put the fruits and dietary supplements by the cabinets beside the hospital bedShe asked Grandma, \u201cAre you alright?\u201dHao Ren\u2019s Grandma wasn\u2019t dull and knew who Zhao Hongyu was from her conversation with Zhao Yanzi. She sat up and said, \u201cThank you for bringing an elder like me to the hospital yesterday.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. That\u2019s what I should do!\u201d Zhao Hongyu answered frankly.Grandma continued and said, \u201cThe money for the hospital\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Hongyu held Grandma\u2019s fingers and didn\u2019t let her continue, \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry about it!\u201dSeeing Zhao Hongyu being so polite about the issue, Grandma felt terrible and repeated, \u201cNo, no, no\u2026\u201d\u201cAuntie! Please don\u2019t treat me like a stranger.

Ren does have a good relationship with Zi.\u201dZhao Yanzi\u2019s face blushed immediately as she defended herself in a quiet voice, \u201cWho says I have a good relationship with him\u2026\u201d\u201cI just asked the doctor, and he said that if everything is ok after another day of observation, you can go home,\u201d Zhao Hongyu continued.\u201cThank you so much! But I still need to pay you back. Once I am discharged, I will look at the bills and give you the money!\u201d Grandma insisted.Seeing her like this, Zhao Hongyu couldn\u2019t refuse any longer. Therefore, she nodded reluctantly and said, \u201cAlright\u2026\u201d\u201cMom, didn\u2019t Phillip Stark come to visit your studio today? I thought you are having dinner with him,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said.\u201cI showed him around the Creative Center today. But since Hao Ren\u2019s grandma is ill, I canceled our dinner arrangements,\u201d Zhao Hongyu smiled.Hao Ren was touched that Zhao Hongyu had prioritized his grandma, but he had no idea that Phillip Stark was a World-Renown Designer who worked on the renovation of the most historic and luxurious hotel in Hong Kong \u2013 the Peninsula Hotel as well as the personal residence of the French President Francois Mitterrand. Zhao Hongyu didn\u2019t just give up an ordinary dinner in order to see Hao Ren\u2019s grandma at the hospital.Since she was here, she certainly wouldn\u2019t leave without chatting with Hao Ren\u2019s grandma for a bit.Although she was in business attire, she was still an understanding wife and loving mother who was down to earth. Her thoughtful conversations and smart responses helped her bond with Hao Ren\u2019s grandma.Grandma was a bit unhappy about how busy her daughter-in-law was since Hao Ren\u2019s mom was working all the time. Therefore, after she found out that Zhao Hongyu was great at doing house chores and taking care of her family, Grandma liked her even more.During their conversation, Zhao Hongyu asked, \u201cAuntie, it\u2019s pretty inconvenient for you to stay in the beach house. Why don\u2019t you move into the city?\u201d\u201cRen\u2019s dad said that the air on the beach is fresher, so he bought me the cottage there. We sold our place in the city many years ago,\u201d Grandma answered.\u201cYou are a senior, and it\u2019s not safe for you to live alone over there. Ren almost lost it yesterday when this happened. I think it would be easier for you if you lived in the city,\u201d Zhao Hongyu carried on.Grandma was a bit convinced as she turned to Hao Ren and imagined how stressed out he was the day before.Zhao Hongyu continued, \u201cHow about moving in with us after you have recovered?\u201dHao Ren was listening to their chat from the side, and he tensed up at the suggestion. \u201cGrandma moving into Zi\u2019s house? What would that mean?\u201d he thought.\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary!\u201d Grandma waved hastily and said, \u201cI\u2019m used to living alone at the beach. It\u2019s is ok. Plus, Ren\u2019s parents are coming back next week, so I will be alright with them taking care of me.\u201d\u201cNext week?\u201d Zhao Hongyu\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cYes, should be next Wednesday. I will ask Ren\u2019s dad to take your family out for dinner to thank you for saving my life,\u201d Grandma said.\u201cPlease don\u2019t bother with that\u2026 we are a family,\u201d Zhao Hongyu kept mentioning that they were a family.She soon added, \u201cBut it\u2019ll be good for us to all meet.\u201dHao Ren\u2019s heart sank. He felt like he had just fallen into a trap. Although his grandma looked healthy, she had severe high blood pressure. It was an indisputable fact that Zhao Hongyu did him a huge favor this time.\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll have Ren\u2019s dad make a reservation when he comes back so we can show our gratitude!\u201d Grandma said brightly.Zhao Hongyu covered her mouth as she laughed and glimpsed at Hao Ren, and he lightly sighed helplessly. He knew that the meeting was destined even if this incident with Grandma never took place. With Zhao Guang controlling the Mingri Group, and he would be able to meet up with Hao Ren\u2019s parents by either investing or sponsoring their projects.\u201cSince we are already a family,\u201d Zhao Hongyu added in the heat of the moment, \u201cMaybe you can stay with us for a few days and fully recover before Ren\u2019s parents come back? We can take you back to the cottage afterward. Plus, we are very close to Ren\u2019s university. You guys would be able to see each other more often because Ren comes to tutor Zi every day. That sounds great, doesn\u2019t it! Ren was so worried when he heard the news yesterday. You don\u2019t want to worry him too much too, right?\u201dThose words were persuasive, but Grandma was still hesitant, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026too much trouble\u2026\u201d\u201cNot at all. We have a spare room, and I will get it ready for you after we get back. It\u2019s not troublesome at all; just an extra pair of chopsticks!\u201d Zhao Hongyu said enthusiastically.Grandma turned to Hao Ren and was still hesitant.Hao Ren was in a dilemma himself after hearing Zhao Hongyu\u2019s suggestion. On the one hand, he didn\u2019t want to trouble Zi\u2019s family because of his grandma. On the other hand, he wanted her to be taken good care of after getting out of the hospital. He wanted her to get well soon because she shouldn\u2019t go through too much at such an old age. Uncle Wang was not young, and he might neglect a lot of things. Hao Ren would still be worried if he let her return to the cottage directly from the hospital.Therefore, he said after a thorough consideration of the situation, \u201cSince my parents will be home next week, it\u2019s better for Grandma to stay with Auntie Hongyu for the time being. We can take you back to the cottage after my parents come back.\u201dHe thought to himself, \u201cWe must pay back the favor to Zi\u2019s family because they have spent money, time, and energy on Grandma in her time of need. It\u2019s a good thing that Zi is still young! I can ask dad to give her a thick red pocket with 7,000 to 8,000 yuan as a gift when they meet. That should be enough to express our gratitude and cover the cost.\u201dGrandma finally made up her mind after hearing Hao Ren\u2019s words. She said to Zhao Hongyu, embarrassed, \u201cAoy\u2026sorry for the trouble then\u2026\u201dShe had the same thoughts as Hao Ren. She wanted to thank Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family a million times once Hao Ren\u2019s dad was back.\u201cThen take some good rest, Auntie! I will send a car to pick you up first thing in the morning tomorrow!\u201d Zhao Hongyu laughed cheerfully. She stood up and lightly bowed to Grandma. Then she waved Zhao Yanzi over.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGoodbye, Grandma!\u201d Zhao Yanzi put the backpack on her back and said to Grandma in a girly tone.\u201cYou have really met a great family, Ren!\u201d Grandma sighed as the two walked out of the room one by one.Next morning, after having examined Hao Ren\u2019s grandma\u2019s condition, the doctor confirmed that everything was fine. He told Hao Ren to complete the discharging procedures.After everything was done, Hao Ren held onto his grandma and helped her to walk out of the hospital \u2013 she was still weak.A black stretch Lincoln Limousine was already waiting outside; it was five meters away from the entrance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Please get in the car.\u201dHao Ren\u2019s grandma was uncomfortable to be greeted like this by Elder Sun who looked older than her. Baffled, she turned to look at Hao Ren.Hao Ren was feeling awkward as well when he saw people in and out of the hospital looking at them. Hurriedly, he helped his grandma into the car.Bam! Bam! The car doors closed after Elder Sun got into the car after them, and the stretch Lincoln Limousine drove away from the hospital steadily.On the way, Elder Sun was all smiles but remained silent. Hao Ren\u2019s grandma was full of questions, but she refrained from asking them.The car arrived at Zhao Yanzi\u2019s home.This time, Elder Sun didn\u2019t go in and say hello like last time. Instead, he left with the car after dropping off Hao Ren and his grandma at the door.Zhao Hongyu heard the car and hurried out to welcome them.At the sight of welcoming Zhao Hongyu, Grandma\u2019s mood got better. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry to trouble you again after all the inconveniences I caused you when you brought me to the hospital,\u201d she said.\u201cWell, it\u2019s really no trouble at all. We are a family, and that\u2019s our duty,\u201d Zhao Hongyu took Grandma\u2019s hand and led her into the house.It was Grandma\u2019s first time inside Zhao Yanzi\u2019s home. She looked around at the luxurious interior and the large high-end rugs on the floor of the living room and knew that Zhao Hongyu\u2019s family was very well off.\u201cHere you are! Welcome!\u201d Zhao Guang walked out of his study room and came to greet them with a smile.Grandma had never seen Zhao Guang before, but she guessed that he must be Zhao Hongyu\u2019s husband. She nodded at him amiably and said after some thinking, \u201cYour home is so beautifully decorated, but I think I\u2019d better not stay here.\u201d\u201cWhy, didn\u2019t you promise yesterday to stay in our home after you\u2019re discharged from the hospital?\u201d Zhao Hongyu interrupted anxiously.Grandma had thought that Zhao Hongyu was from an ordinary family when she saw her simple clothes the day before. But after knowing that Zhao Hongyu\u2019s family was wealthy, Grandma got a little uncomfortable. After all, Grandma was from the countryside and lived a very simple lifestyle.\u201cGrandma\u2026\u201d hearing the sounds from downstairs, Zhao Yanzi, dressed in a hooded shirt and a pair of denim shorts, ran down.She looked cute and innocent, like an energetic little white dragon jumping out of the water. She had meant to say hello to the guest as required of a good-mannered family member.However, Grandma was charmed by Zhao Yanzi\u2019s cute and innocent look. She took her in her arms and patted her head. \u201cGood girl! I just came out of the hospital and hadn\u2019t get you a gift,\u201d Grandma said.\u201cGrandma\u2019s health is the only gift I want!\u201d Zhao Yanzi said sweetly. She meant what she said since she had been quite concerned about Hao Ren when she saw him so anxious and lost when Grandma was in the hospital. That was why she had gone with her dad to pick up Hao Ren and hoped that she could help out.Of course, caring for Hao Ren didn\u2019t mean that she liked him.\u201cAuntie, please stay with us!\u201d Zhao Hongyu urged again.Looking at Zhao Yanzi in her arms, Grandma hesitated and said. \u201cWell, fine. I\u2019m just afraid to disrupt your beautiful home.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s sit down for lunch,\u201d Zhao Guang called to them.Hao Ren looked up and saw delicious-looking dishes on the table.Hao Ren helped his grandma to the table. With a reclining chair added to the table, the five of them sat down and had lunch in high spirits.After the incident with his grandma, Hao Ren was very grateful towards Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family. Even if they could find another solution to the problem between him and Zhao Yanzi, he would never forget this big favor that Zhao Hongyu and Zhao Guang had done for him.After lunch, Zhao Hongyu helped Grandma to rest in the room that had been newly cleared for her, Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi were put in charge of cleaning up, and Zhao Guang had left as there were some urgent business matters he had to take care of.Zhao Yanzi stood shoulder to shoulder with Hao Ren in the kitchen while washing the dishes. To tell the truth, Zhao Yanzi sucked at washing dishes as none of the plates she washed was clean, so Hao Ren had to wash them again.\u201cThank you for all the things you did,\u201d Hao Ren said while he rewashed the plates.\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Zhao Yanzi pursed her lips.Hao Ren smiled and said, \u201cDo you want me to play games with you this afternoon?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need your company! I\u2019m going shopping with Ling this afternoon!\u201d Zhao Yanzi pushed all the dirty plates to Hao Ren and skipping out of the kitchen. Afterward, she dried her hands and thought her task was over.Hao Ren turned and saw Zhao Yanzi tiptoeing out of the door and running to the street through the glass door of the kitchen.\u201cThis girl is going out shopping without her mom\u2019s permission. She must have gone pocket money from her Third Uncle to buy girly things\u2026\u201dExasperated, Hao Ren shook his head and continued washing the dishes.Maybe it was her way of telling Hao Ren not to be smug, Zhao Yanzi had dinner in Ling\u2019s home after shopping with her. Then, she asked Ling\u2019s parents to call home to tell her parents that she was staying the night at Ling\u2019s home.Knowing that Ling and Zi were best friends, Zhao Hongyu agreed to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s request. After all, it was the weekend, and she wanted her daughter to have some leisure time. Hao Ren stayed the night in Zhao Yanzi\u2019s home to keep his grandma company. The next day was Sunday, and he returned to school after being assured of his grandma\u2019s comfort.After the eventful weekend, Hao Ren returned to the dorm and went back to the messy and happy life with Zhao Jiayi and his other buddies. Another week began.After two classes in the morning, Hao Ren carried an armful of library books and went to the library alone to return them.After returning the books, he borrowed some new ones. In the past, he had some time for reading. Now, he had to tutor Zhao Yanzi and cultivate outside of his regular class schedule; he almost had no time of his own and couldn\u2019t play cards and games like Zhao Jiayi and the others.Hao Ren gradually felt like Zhao Yanzi\u2019s home was his own since he went there every day after school and now even his grandma lived there.He walked out of the library with those thoughts on his mind. When he walked toward the stairs, he saw Class President Xie Yujia dressed in a white shirt studying in the periodicals reading room.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe seemed to have sensed his presence as she turned and saw Hao Ren on the stairs.Hao Ren smiled and waved at her. After that, he continued going downstairs with books in his arms. He went into the hall and out of the library.When he was turning towards the direction of his dorm, he heard hurried footsteps behind him.He turned and saw Xie Yujia rush towards him with books and notebooks in her arms.\u201cHao Ren, wait!

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedXie Yujia was running so fast that she almost tripped over the steps outside the library and landed in Hao Ren\u2019s arms.She barely steadied herself, and her face was red due to the run. She panted and said, \u201cAre you going back to your dorm?\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d Hao Ren looked at her, baffled.\u201cI\u2026I am heading back to my dorm, too,\u201d Xie Yujia said after half a second pause.\u201cOh. Let\u2019s walk back together,\u201d Hao Ren still looked nonplussed.\u201cWait for me for a second; my bicycle is over there,\u201d with her books in her arms, Xie Yujia walked to the parking lot on the right side of the library. She put the books in the basket in the front and unlocked the bike before walking it to Hao Ren.Dressed in a white shirt, a pair of denim shorts, and a pair of green canvas shoes while walking a semi-new bike, Xie Yujia looked like the girl-next-door.In Hao Ren\u2019s mind, she had the perfect image and should be the most popular girl in the school instead of that blatantly dressed-up Lin Li from the Third Class.Seeing Hao Ren staring at her, Xie Yujia blushed and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cOk,\u201d Hao Ren walked with her shoulder to shoulder. They walked across the open space in front of the library and crossed the bridge over the school lake.The sun was shining, and the bike rolled forward slowly, matching their steps. They walked for a dozen meters in silence before Xie Yujia asked abruptly, \u201cHow is your grandma?\u201d\u201cShe is fine now,\u201d Hao Ren thought for a moment and said, \u201cThank you for your concern.\u201dXie Yujia lowered her head and asked after a few seconds, \u201cWhat is going on between you and Su Han?\u201dWith her white hands on the bike handles, her soft and elegant body leaned slightly to one side.\u201cShe is my distant cousin,\u201d Hao Ren forced himself to say the words even himself wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201cThat day, Thursday, I saw you enter her office,\u201d Xie Yujia said.Hao Ren turned to look at her; now he knew that the person who had followed him was actually Xie Yujia. He thought quickly and said, \u201cOh\u2026 I went to ask her about something I didn\u2019t quite understand from her class.\u201d\u201cOh, so she tutored you privately,\u201d Xie Yujia said immediately.\u201cWell,\u201d Hao Ren smiled at the assumption, though the content of the tutoring session wasn\u2019t about the topic taught in the class but about cultivation.\u201cAny more questions?\u201d Hao Ren asked after Xie Yujia turned silent.\u201cNo,\u201d Xie Yujia shook her head.Looking at her bright and pretty face, Hao Ren thought the beautiful Class President was quite cute.They continued to walk. Although Xie Yujia had the bike with her and had finished asking her questions, she didn\u2019t seem like she was in a hurry.\u201cWarm Welcome to World Famous Biologist Hao Zhonghua and Globally Well-Known Meteorologist Yue Yang Who Will Be Giving Lectures in the University!\u201dA red banner hanging over the top of the Green Hill Cafeteria came into their view.It was hung here to get more students\u2019 attention.Looking up at the banner, Xie Yujia started another topic, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect our school to be able to invite such famous people to give guest lectures here.\u201d\u201cOh? Do you know them?\u201d Hao Ren was surprised.Seeing Hao Ren\u2019s surprise, Xie Yujia said immediately, \u201cHow can I not know them? Hao Zhonghua is China\u2019s most famous biologist, and the domestic media says that he is the most promising Chinese candidate for the Nobel Biology Prize. His paper on genetic information transcription has been published in Nature Magazine in the United States. International media also has a high opinion of his other research projects, though I can\u2019t remember the titles now\u2026\u201dXie Yujia had a lot to say about the global reputation of the so-called Greatest Biologist in China. However, when she talked about his biological research projects, she couldn\u2019t remember the titles.Seeing the confusion on Hao Ren\u2019s face, Xie Yujia was angry at her futile efforts. \u201cAnyway, he is one of the greatest scientists in China. Besides, he is very young, only in his forties. He published papers in all kinds of science magazines, and he is in the news frequently. You haven\u2019t heard of him at all?\u201dSeeing her serious expression as if she was giving a lecture to a student, Hao Ren had an urge to laugh.\u201cYou guys only know about playing online games, watching movies or reading comic books in your dorm, and you don\u2019t care a bit about the world around you. If you guys keep going like this, you will be left behind by the world!\u201d with one hand on her hip, Xie Yujia lectured him sternly.Seeing her all riled up, Hao Ren had to give in. \u201cOk! Ok! Now I\u2019ll remember his name,\u201d he said.\u201cGood!\u201d Xie Yujia was satisfied. \u201cIt would be shameful if you knew nothing about such a famous scientist! Besides, he should be a distant relative of yours.\u201d\u201cDistant relative?\u201d Hao Ren was baffled.\u201cYeah. Since you both have the surname of Hao, you guys probably belonged to the same family 300 years ago,\u201d Xie Yujia stared at Hao Ren and said.Hao Ren chuckled. \u201cYou are right, Class President. I didn\u2019t know you are a fan of this Hao Zhonghua.\u201d\u201cBe respectful! He is the most famous scientist in China!\u201d Xie Yujia began to lecture him again.\u201cYeah, yeah\u2026\u201d Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to argue with a girl or the Class President. He surrendered and said, \u201cClass President, I guess you will definitely go to the lecture this Thursday.\u201d\u201cOf course! And this time he isn\u2019t alone! His wife will be here, too! This is a rare opportunity for us undergraduates! As academicians, he and his wife are busy with their research and rarely show their faces in public. I wonder how the school managed to invite them both to give us lectures\u2026 This is even a rare opportunity for doctoral students!\u201dXie Yujia was excited about this topic. She had been a straight-A student since elementary school, and she had her eyes on science and technology. As a result, her admiration of scientists was understandable.Of course, even the students who had no interest in science would go to the auditorium to see the famous couple Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang.Xie Yujia continued her lecture while walking with Hao Ren, \u201cHao Zhonghua is only in his forties, but he is already a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 1 . And his wife, Yue Yang, is also awesome since she is a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Some say each of them could be a member of both the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, but they aren\u2019t given the titles because of their young ages\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHearing the \u201cgossip\u201d about the couple from Xie Yujia, Hao Ren found the serious look on her face funny.Soon, Xie Yujia found that Hao Ren was still unimpressed after her lecture and was almost treating what she said as some jokes. She was seriously upset and said, \u201cYou! You don\u2019t have any respect for such great scientists!\u201dHao Ren was about to argue his case when the cell phone in his pocket began to buzz.Digging out his phone, he saw it was from Cao Ronghua. He answered lazily, \u201cWell, I\u2019m on my way. You can take out the cards now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not about the cards!

He asked immediately, \u201cWhere are they?\u201d\u201cZone B on the basketball court!\u201d Cao Ronghua yelled on the phone.\u201cGot it! I\u2019m coming!\u201d Hao Ren hung up and looked towards the direction of Zone B; he was ready to take off.Xie Yujia reached out and held him back. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked.\u201cZhao Jiayi is fighting with the guys from the basketball team!\u201d Hao Ren answered. Suddenly, he looked at Xie Yujia\u2019s bike and reached for the handles. \u201cLend me your bike!\u201d he said.\u201cNo! I\u2019m going, too!\u201d as the Class President, Xie Yujia felt it was her duty to make sure that everyone in her class was safe.Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to argue with her. He threw his leg over the bike and was on it instantly. Xie Yujia held onto his shirt tightly and sat on the back seat of the bike.With Xie Yujia on the back seat, the bike was still not heavy. Hao Ren paddled hard and dashed forward at a hurtling speed.Xie Yujia was astonished at the speed and the powerful strength of Hao Ren\u2019s legs. She had no choice but to clutch his shirt in her hands and hold onto Hao Ren tightly to stop herself from falling off the bike.The ordinary bike rushed toward Zone B of the basketball court.Screech! Hao Ren braked hard when they reached the court, and Xie Yujia\u2019s soft body crashed onto his back with great momentum.However, Hao Ren was oblivious to all this. Jumping off the bike, he dashed onto the court.With her chest hurting, Xie Yujia caught the bike and kept it from falling. She saw the court was crowded with people and fighting noises could be heard coming from the center. She pushed the bike aside and ran after Hao Ren onto the court.Hao Ren pushed through the crowd with a force he didn\u2019t know he possessed before, rushing towards the center. Xie Yujia had followed Hao Ren closely and thus also got into the inner circle of the crowd.In the center of the basketball court, four big guys from the basketball team surrounded Zhao Jiayi while giving him bashes and kicks.Zhao Jiayi was bruised all over. Although he had fallen to the ground, he stubbornly kicked at his opponents who were wearing sports shorts. Hurt and enraged by his kicks, his opponents beat Zhao Jiayi with greater force.\u201cStop!\u201d a surge of hot blood rushed into Hao Ren\u2019s head. He rushed over and punched the guy who was giving Zhao Jiayi the most vicious kicks in the face.That guy was red in the eye and had not expected someone would dare to stop him. Unprepared, he was solidly punched by Hao Ren\u2019s fist; he fell back three steps, and his face instantly swelled up.It happened so fast that the others didn\u2019t notice Hao Ren\u2019s interference as they kept kicking Zhao Jiayi. Enraged, Hao Ren rushed into the circle of the fight. Shielding Zhao Jiayi with his body, Hao Ren grabbed onto two ankles and swung them out.Bang! Bang!Two big guys from the basketball team crashed onto the ground.Xie Yujia\u2019s eyes widened, astonished by Hao Ren\u2019s great strength.Anxious to save his buddy, Hao Ren stood up and grabbed another two guys from the basketball team by their shirt and swung them out with force; the two six-feet tall guys flew into the air!All the people in the crowd were stunned\u2026 \u201cIs him Superman coming to the rescue? He looks thin and weak, but he had just knocked down six to seven big guys from the basketball team in the blink of an eye!\u201d they thought.With a bruise on the corner of one eye, Zhou Liren, who was standing at the corner in the crowd, was also stunned. He was six feet tall, and he had tried to help Zhao Jiayi but was knocked down by one fist instantly.Beside him, Cao Ronghua, who was even weaker than Zhou Liren, was standing there. He had tried to break up the fight and was pushed far away by one brawny arm of one of the basketball team members. He had called Hao Ren to get more help, but he was astonished to see Hao Ren knocking down all the opponents\u2026\u201cWho dares to come?!\u201d Red-eyed, Hao Ren shielded Zhao Jiayi with his body and yelled.His act was extremely courageous in Xie Yujia\u2019s eyes. Looking at Hao Ren who was sweaty and red in rage, Xie Yujia, a well-behaved student who hated fights, suddenly found him extremely dashing.\u201cKid, who do you think you are?\u201d the Power Forward in the basketball team stood up and threw his six-feet-four-inch body toward Hao Ren.He didn\u2019t believe Hao Ren could catch his body. He had blamed his earlier fall to his unpreparedness. After all, the brutal force of the basketball team was unrivaled!Seeing this guy rushing toward him, Hao Ren\u2019s rage ignited. He didn\u2019t even dodge since his buddy, Zhao Jiayi was lying at his feet.Bang! Hao Ren reached out and caught the six-feet-four-inch tall and 200-pounds Power Forward!Their palms collided with each other. Like in Russian wrestling, they were competing with pure force!Deng! Deng! Deng! Deng!The brawny Power Forward was forced back four steps and then crashed onto the ground at the last unsteady step.It happened in the blink of an eye.All the people had disbelief on their faces.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dThe question arose in the mind of everyone present.The fallen Power Forward also looked at Hao Ren in astonishment. \u201cThis ordinary student who is one head shorter and half of my size pushed me to the ground!?\u201d he thought, \u201cI am the Power Forward of the basketball team which had won the champion of the College Basketball League\u2026\u201dSnap! Snap!The shoelaces on both of Hao Ren\u2019s shoes snapped.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe bent his back and helped Zhao Jiayi to get up. He looked back at the members of the basketball team and spat out two words, \u201cJust wait\u2026\u201dSwoosh! The crowd stepped aside and opened a path for them automatically.Hao Ren helped the limping Zhao Jiayi out of the basketball court and toward the dorm building outside the campus.Zhou Liren and Cao Ronghua exchanged a look with each other, hurriedly stood up, and followed Hao Ren.The dazzled crowd was left speechless on the basketball court, including Xie Yujia, who had her cell phone in her hand and was planning to call her older brother.

Yu Rong, Gu Jiadong, Huang Jianfeng and the other students in the nearby dorm rooms all came over to ask about the incident.They were all astonished when they knew Zhao Jiayi had been in a fight with the Savages from the basketball team. Zhou Liren\u2019s eye swelled up and looked like a panda; Cao Ronghua, though not injured, had his clothes torn open; and Zhao Jiayi had the most severe injuries with a bloody mouth, a scratch on his forehead, a bleeding nose, and countless bruises on his arms and legs.Only Hao Ren was intact except for his broken shoelaces. It was the most severe group casualties for Room 302 since the day they enrolled in school.Yu Rong fetched some anti-infection medical solution from his own dorm and applied it to Zhou Liren\u2019s wound. Zhao Jiayi, on the other hand, had to go to the hospital to check if he had any bone fractures.\u201cDamn! They dared to fight with us! Yu Rong, call all the guys from our department and go crash their training court!\u201d Huang Jianfeng, who liked to stay in his room and read novels, was indignant. He called and shouted to Yu Rong, the most trustworthy guy among them who could summon a lot of students.\u201cStop it!\u201d suddenly, a crisp female voice came from the outside of the door.Xie Yujia in her white shirt walked into Room 302. Under the watchful eyes of the guys, she walked to Zhao Jiayi and asked, \u201cAre you all right?\u201dZhao Jiayi didn\u2019t expect the Class President would come to see him in person. He had been grimacing with pain, but now he suddenly toughed up and answered firmly, \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201dNodding, Xie Yujia looked at the other guys in the dorm and said, \u201cSchool management is aware of the fight and is dealing with it. Don\u2019t put yourselves in the wrong!\u201d\u201cWe should just forget about it after being beaten by them? No way!\u201d Huang Jianfeng shouted.\u201cThe members of the basketball teams are also injured. The Point Guard has a fracture in his arm, the Shooting Guard sprained his ankle, and the Power Forward injured his back. There will be a basketball match between our school and Jinghua University the week after next week. If they can\u2019t play in the match, our school will be in the danger of losing. You must not do anything to make the matter worse!\u201d\u201cThe unrivaled players on the basketball team were also injured?\u201dThe guys in Room 302 couldn\u2019t believe the information Xie Yujia just told them.Seeing their expressions, Xie Yujia continued, \u201cIn short, the school will deal with the matter seriously. You must not make the matter worse, or you will have to endure the consequences!\u201dYu Rong took half a step forward and said, \u201cBut the school will surely stand behind the basketball team, and Zhao Jiayi will be punished unfairly. Besides, the record of disciplinary punishment would not affect the future of those guys on the basketball team while it would be different for Zhao Jiayi\u2026\u201d\u201cFine! I will report it to the school!\u201d Irritated, Xie Yujia interrupted Yu Rong.She was incredibly bothered with the whole thing. On the one hand, the guys from her class caused trouble, but she didn\u2019t want any of them to be punished. On the other hand, the starting players on the basketball team were injured because of the fight, and the basketball team would probably lose the match against Jinghua University in two weeks. Her older brother was now furious and had said he would handle this situation in person; that meant Hao Ren, main fighter, would face her older brother\u2019s fury.Besides, she had asked around about how the fight started. Zhao Jiayi and his two buddies had gone to the basketball court after finding no seats in the Internet Cafe. While they were playing, some members of the basketball team tried to take the court from them. Zhao Jiayi didn\u2019t agree and argued with them. It had been quite an ordinary argument until Zhao Jiayi cussed at them and threw the basketball at one of the players on the basketball team. These members on the basketball team were always hot-tempered, and thus both parties got into a serious fight.The fact was that Zhao Jiayi and his buddies had started the fight.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll take you to the hospital and get you checked,\u201d Xie Yujia turned to look at Zhao Jiayi and said.\u201cNo! I\u2019m fine!\u201d Zhao Jiayi wanted to show his strong side in front of a girl.\u201cYou better get a check-up. There will be more trouble if you have some unknown injuries,\u201d Xie Yujia was stubborn; she grabbed Zhao Jiayi\u2019s arm and insisted.\u201cYeah, go check. The injury report will also be proof against them,\u201d other guys urged.\u201cFine,\u201d Zhao Jiayi finally gave in. He looked at Zhou Liren and said \u201cYou will come as well. You must have your eye treated; you look like a panda!\u201d\u201cOk, ok\u2026\u201d rubbing his eye, Zhou Liren stood up.Other guys volunteered to go with Zhao Jiayi, but Xie Yujia stopped them, saying, \u201cYu Rong and Cao Ronghua can accompany them. Hao Ren, you stay in the dorm and rest.\u201dThen she left the dorm with the four guys, and the other guys all returned to their own dorm rooms.Xie Yujia came to their dorm and prevented the escalation of the situation while giving them comfort and emotional support. She was an excellent Class President.Hao Ren was left alone in the dorm room. He thought for a while and was still unease. He dug out the thick Engineering Philosophy book and found Lu Qing\u2019s business card that he put in it.The school\u2019s attitude on this incident was critical, and Lu Qing, the head vice president supervising the school\u2019s management, would play an essential role in dealing with this incident.Hao Ren didn\u2019t want Zhao Jiayi to be mistreated. Although Zhao Jiayi started the fight, the trigger had been the long-time bullying behaviors of the players on the basketball team towards other students, especially junior students.With the card in his hand, Hao Ren took out his phone and thought for half a minute about what he intended to say. He was about to dial the number when a thought occurred to him, so he put the card back into the book and stood up with the key of the dorm room.It would be better to talk to Lu Qing face to face, rather than talking to him over the phone.Hao Ren left the dorm building and hurried onto the campus. He went directly to vice president Lu Qing\u2019s office, situated on the sixth floor of the administration building.He knocked on the door and waited a while; no one answered or opened the door.Worried that some teachers passing by would ask him questions, Hao Ren waited for half a minute at the door and had to leave when Lu Qing didn\u2019t answer.He knew the vice president was a busy man. Since the punishment decision wouldn\u2019t be made so soon, Hao Ren was not very anxious. He wasn\u2019t even certain that the fight had been reported to Lu Qing.With this thought, Hao Ren took the elevator and went down. While he was walking out of the administration building, a mountain-like figure walked toward the entrance.With a height of more than six-feet-five-inches and a width of almost three-feet-three-inches, this figure blocked the sunshine from coming in through the door.The giant had to bend his back and lower his head to enter the door of the building. With a scowl on his face, he was not in a good mood.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHao Ren guessed that he must be the legendary captain of the basketball team.\u201cIs he here to see the vice president Lu Qing, too?\u201d the thought occurred to Hao Ren.Indifferent to an ordinary student\u2019s astonishment, the giant walked into the elevator from which Hao Ren had just come out.Deng! Deng\u2026 The moment he walked into the elevator, it shook slightly.Hao Ren stood there and watched the number above the elevator door change from one to two, three, four, five until it stopped at six.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedHao Ren thought about it for a moment but walked out of the Administrative Building and returned to his dorm instead.On his way up the staircase and through the hall, he found that all of the male students, whether they knew him or not, were all staring at him strangely as if he was an alien.\u201cIs that him? Sun Han\u2019s rumored boyfriend? The guy who beat Huang Xujie at the long-distance race, and the one who fought against half of the basketball team on his own?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t really tell from his appearance, can you? He looks just like a normal kid, who would have thought\u2026\u201dThey continued to gossip behind Hao Ren\u2019s back. None of them had ever imagined that Hao Ren, an ordinary looking student and a nobody in the school, could have badly beaten up those arrogant and presumptuous players on the basketball team.Their words, more or less, had not escaped Hao Ren\u2019s keen hearing. He found that as more people talked about it, the more exaggerated and distorted the descriptions of the incident had become.Paying no attention to their comments, Hao Ren directly returned to the third floor; all he cared about right now was Zhao Jiayi\u2019s condition.\u201cRen, you took care of half of the basketball team all by yourself?\u201d Gu Jiadong rushed out and asked astoundingly as he saw Hao Ren pass by their dorm room.It seemed that the people in their dorm building fell behind on the news. After Zhao Jiayi went to the hospital and Hao Ren went to the Administrative Building, the reports of Hao Ren\u2019s heroic deeds such as how he took on multiple players and frightened and restrained them finally came through.By the time Hao Ren had come back, word had spread throughout the dorm building No.7 and the entire southern region of the dorm area.\u201cIs Zhao Jiayi and the others back yet?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cNot yet, but Yu Rong called just now and said that the test results are out. According to the results, Zhao Jiayi\u2019s injuries are mostly bruises, and the worst injury was just a muscle strain on his right arm. Zhou Liren also only has a bruise around his eyes\u2026 and that\u2019s all,\u201d Gu Jiadong replied.Hao Ren felt slightly relieved upon receiving this update. Luckily, Zhao Jiayi had tough skin. Acquiring only minor injuries after being assaulted by a round of basketball players indicated that Zhao Jiayi was no doubt the fittest in their dorm room.\u201cOh, and there is something else,\u201d seeing that Hao Ren started to head towards Room 302, Gu Jiadong stopped him and said, \u201cApparently, two of those guys on the basketball team have mild bone fractures, one pulled his hamstring, and one got scrapes on his back. Out of the six, four have been injured, and the situation seems more serious than what the Class President had said. Since this is the latest update acquired by Yu Rong, I think it should be accurate.\u201dHao Ren went blank for a second and did not say anything.\u201cIt seemed that the basketball team suffered more from this fight. No wonder even the basketball team captain, who usually only stayed in the training court and rarely made any appearances in the school had gone to talk to Lu Qing in person. Not only that, he looked horrifyingly mad. This matter won\u2019t be settled very easily,\u201d he thought, \u201cNonetheless, taking advantage of their special status, the bad eggs on the basketball team had been bullying other students on a regular basis. Therefore, they weren\u2019t so innocent, and one might even say that this outcome served them right.\u201dTaking out his key, he got into their dorm room and seated himself in front of his desk. He then opened a textbook and tried to read, but he couldn\u2019t digest any of it. After all, with the occurrence of such a hectic incident, he could not remain calm.Shortly after, Zhao Jiayi and Zhou Liren had returned with Xie Yujia\u2019s company.When they saw that Hao Ren was reading on the balcony, they couldn\u2019t help but almost applaud him for being so composed.\u201cHow was it? Are you alright?\u201d Hao Ren inquired as soon as the gang walked in.\u201cNothing serious. I just pulled my arm. With a few days of rest, it will be fine,\u201d Zhao Jiayi answered. After today\u2019s incident, he looked to Hao Ren with a slight sense of reverence.No one would have guessed that Hao Ren, who was mild and gentle and had a name even resembled the pronunciation of \u201cgood person\u201d, was such an incredible fighter. To Zhao Jiayi, who had shared a room with Hao Ren for a long time and supposedly knew him well, it came as an even bigger surprise.\u201cYou already know about the situation with the basketball team, right?\u201d Yu Rong walked over and asked Hao Ren.\u201cYes, more or less,\u201d Hao Ren put the book back on the desk.\u201cThe basketball team consists of 12 players. Four of them are now injured, and they are all starting players. Not only that, this incident will likely affect the outcome of the basketball match between East Ocean University and Jinghua University which is taking place two weeks from now. Hence, the school will definitely take this incident seriously,\u201d Xie Yujia said solemnly as she turned to face Hao Ren.She was a little irritated. At a time like this, the fact that Hao Ren was able to read calmly and act as if nothing had happened had angered her. She felt like all the worries she had for him had gone to waste.\u201cRen, this has nothing to do with you. I started the whole thing! It doesn\u2019t matter if it results in punishment or expulsion, I am the one responsible and will deal with the consequences alone!\u201d Zhao Jiayi spoke up suddenly.\u201cWhat nonsense, I was the one who injured those guys, and you are a victim who was assaulted by those players. This has nothing to do with you!\u201d Hao Ren stood up and stated determinedly.\u201cDon\u2019t leave me out!\u201d with bruises around one of his eyes, Zhou Liren stood with them.\u201cMe too. They\u2019d better penalize none of us or all of us! F*ck, if they\u2019re going to make one of us a scapegoat, then all of us in Room 302 will be scapegoats together!\u201d Cao Ronghua who was usually gentle and soft-spoken declared fiercely.\u201cAlright! Stop this, you guys!\u201d Xie Yujia raised her hand and interrupted them, \u201cAt any rate, I will try my best to ease things with the school. Don\u2019t you dare stir up any more trouble at this time!\u201dZhao Jiayi disagreed with her words, \u201cWhat do mean we stirred up trouble, they were the ones\u2026\u201dSeeing that Zhao Jiayi was raising his voice at Xie Yujia, Hao Ren promptly pulled at Zhao Jiayi\u2019s arm to stop him from continuing. He then turned to Xie Yujia and said, \u201cThank you, Class President, and sorry for all the trouble we caused you.\u201dLooking at Hao Ren, Xie Yujia paused and gave up on lecturing him. In the end, she could only let out a sigh. \u201cAy\u2026\u201dThen, she turned and walked out of Room 302.\u201cRen, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s probably going to be detention or something! I will see the Guidance Counsellor tomorrow and explain everything. I will take full responsibility and accept all consequences. In any case, this should have nothing to do with you!\u201d after Xie Yujia walked out, Zhao Jiayi looked at Hao Ren and said.\u201cIt can\u2019t be that simple\u2026\u201d Hao Ren responded silently.Xie Yujia was right. If this incident had taken place at any other time, it would not have been a big problem, and they might get off with just a verbal warning. However, the fact that it happened right before the basketball match between East Ocean University and Jinghua University had made it complicated.Jinghua University was the runner-up for last year\u2019s National College Basketball League, and their basketball team\u2019s skill sets were comparable to those of East Ocean University\u2019s. After all, they lost with a mere two-points difference at last year\u2019s finals.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis year, they called for a friendly exhibition match with East Ocean University before the official start of the season; it was obvious that it was an act of provocation. If East Ocean University lost this match, it would significantly impact the morale of the team and their confidence to do well in the regular season. As a result, both the basketball team and the school placed immense emphasis on winning this match.Yet, during such a pivotal moment, the top players on the school\u2019s basketball team had been injured in a fight. This has turned into a very sensitive matter.If the school was hoping to defend their champion title this year, they would have to take the basketball team\u2019s concerns into consideration. Having said that, even without the imminent match, the school would have ruled in the basketball team\u2019s favor to pacify the group anyway.Moreover, Hao Ren knew that the captain of the basketball team, who usually only took responsibility for training the team and rarely got involved in any school affairs, had taken matters into his own hands this time.One way or another, this dispute had to be resolved!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63: Game Plays\u2026 Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedThere were two periods of the elective, Art Appreciation, scheduled in the afternoon. However, with the recent incident, no one was in the mood to go to class.Zhao Jiayi was resting in bed, Cao Ronghua had buried himself in homework, Zhou Liren was sitting cross-legged and listening to his MP3, and Hao Ren was gathering materials for his tutoring session tonight.\u201cI\u2019m treating you guys to dinner tonight. I\u2019ve thought it through; in the worst case, I will just drop out of school! Screw their punishments or detentions!\u201d Zhao Jiayi announced as he abruptly jumped up from his bed.\u201cAy, why would you want to throw your life away like that?\u201d Cao Ronghua turned his head and urged.\u201cThe school always takes the side of those bastards anyway. What is the point of studying in a school like this!?\u201d Zhao Jiayi shouted despairingly.\u201cExactly!\u201d taking off his headphones, Zhou Liren joined in angrily, \u201cThe basketball team is the pride of the school, and we are nothing, is that it?\u201dHao Ren was feeling unsettled, too. Actually, the conflicts between the members of the basketball team and the other students were mostly derived from the use of the basketball court, nothing else. It was people like Huang Xujie who grew so self-important because of their connections with the players that irked him the most.Examining the incident closely, it was indeed Zhao Jiayi\u2019s impulsiveness that had led to the fight. Even so, the fact that it was not the first time Zhao Jiayi had to deal with the members of the basketball team forcefully taking over the court should be taken into consideration as well. In addition, some of the basketball players there were the ones who had provoked them at the Bar and Grill last time. Zhao Jiayi naturally believed that it was personal, and they were trying to provoke him again. Therefore, his temper exploded at full force instantly.At this moment, Hao Ren suddenly thought of something. On Thursday night, the night he had Marxism Philosophy was the same night in which his grandma collapsed due to having high blood pressure\u2026 he left school and did not make it to the field at eight o\u2019clock. In other words, he had stood Huang Xujie up. Could Huang Xujie be the one behind all this?After finding out that the members of the basketball team were injured badly, Hao Ren had gradually calmed himself down. But now, his anger rose once again. If it was Huang Xujie who instigated the basketball team to harass Zhao Jiayi, then there would be no need to try and reason!\u201cLet\u2019s go! Let\u2019s eat out today! We might get expelled tomorrow anyway!\u201d Zhao Jiayi demanded as he pounded at the three one by one.Zhao Jiayi was now in a terrible state of mind. He could see that the school would inevitably favor the basketball team when handling this incident, especially when he was the one who initiated the fight.The thought of no one occupying the berth below him made Hao Ren uneasy. Now that the match against Jinghua University was nearing, he had absolutely no clue what kind of punishment the school would be handing out.All in all, even though Zhao Jiayi initiated the incident, it was Hao Ren who injured those players. Therefore, Hao Ren felt that he had reasons to shoulder the blame together with Zhao Jiayi, even if he were to be expelled.\u201cCome on! It\u2019s on me!\u201d Zhao Jiayi continued calling out to them.Seeing Zhao Jiayi in such a bad mood, there was nothing Hao Ren and the others could do but to agree to go with him. The four of them went to the best eating joint in the nearby Hongji Square.Since Zhao Jiayi was feeling dejected, he immediately started downing glasses of liquor. Since they could not stop him, Zhou Liren and Cao Ronghua could only join him. On the other hand, before going out with Zhao Jiayi, Hao Ren had made a call to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s home to inform them that he would not be there for dinner that night.\u201cSons of b*tches! When I saw them walking towards our court, I could tell that they were coming for you, Ren!\u201d the more that Zhao Jiayi drank, the louder he got.Hao Ren was moved. At first, he thought that the fight was purely over the use of the court. Now he understood that Zhao Jiayi started the fight trying to stick up for him.\u201cThose bastards, they have their own gym and training facilities, yet they had to come practice outdoor! What for? Just because the basketball courts were close to the girls\u2019 dorms, and they wanted to have a female audience!\u201d with a black eye, Zhou Liren was drinking and complaining at the same time.\u201cLast time at the Bar and Grill, they couldn\u2019t lay hands on us because we had the numbers advantage. This time, they obviously recognized us since they didn\u2019t bother with the other unoccupied courts and came right at us instead. It was totally personal!\u201d Cao Ronghua said as he put down his drink forcefully, banging the table.Squeezing the glass in his hand, Hao Ren remained silent.\u201cHoho, isn\u2019t this the second-year long-distance race champion?\u201d Just as Cao Ronghua and the others were taking turns venting, a remark in a taunting tone came from the entrance of the restaurant.Hao Ren turned at the voice and saw Huang Xujie leading a group of male students, strutting into the restaurant.\u201cI waited for you at the field on Thursday, how come you didn\u2019t show up? Too scared?\u201d he asked as he approached Hao Ren.Glaring at him, Hao Ren paused slightly and then asked, \u201cAre you behind what happened today?\u201d\u201cAh, you mean your fight with the basketball team?\u201d Huang Xujie shrugged as if he genuinely was not involved and said, \u201cThey did want to make a point on my behalf. But I\u2019ll tell you this; I don\u2019t need their help at all.\u201d\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying you have nothing to do with anything that had happened today?\u201d Hao Ren further attempted to verify.Huang Xujie got very close to Hao Ren and arrogantly stared at him in the eye from just five centimeters away. He declared slowly, \u201cTo deal with you, I don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll let it go today then,\u201d Hao Ren said as he moved his intense gaze away.\u201cHow boastful? Hahahaha\u2026 How dare a second-year talk so big?\u201d the guys behind Huang Xujie yelled as they let out roaring laughter at Hao Ren\u2019s serious remark.Bang!Abruptly, the glass in Hao Ren\u2019s hand shattered.The golden-colored beer dripped along his arm and hand, onto the floor.At that moment, all of those who were taunting him just seconds ago had tightly shut their mouths.Huang Xujie was also slightly bewildered. \u201cIf the rumor about Hao Ren taking on the basketball team on his own was true, then I might not be Hao Ren\u2019s match,\u201d he thought.Huang Xujie just assumed Hao Ren\u2019s \u201cno show\u201d on Thursday was due to cold feet. Yet, judging from Hao Ren\u2019s actions today, Huang Xujie found Hao Ren to be more capable and mysterious than he had initially believed.Still, quickly adjusting himself, Huang Xujie calmly stated to Hao Ren, \u201cYour friends have guts. It takes a lot of courage to pick a fight with the basketball team. However, this thing between you and me, I will come to you about it myself.\u201d\u201cWhatever the basketball team did to you had nothing to do with me. But since they are my friends, I will help them work this out! Enjoy your meal with your friends, second-year! This could well be your last meal! If everything goes right, the punishments should be handed down tomorrow!\u201d straightening his body, Huang Xujie slightly waved his arm with his back to Hao Ren, and he lazily but confidently left his last words before walking towards the back of the restaurant.Thump!Hao Ren stood up so abruptly that his chair fell over.Yet, a strong, muscular arm had grabbed onto his shirt and stopped him from rushing to confront Huang Xujie.Hao Ren turned around and saw Zhao Jiayi shaking his head at him.Hao Ren understood that Zhao Jiayi did not want the incident to escalate any further. Zhao Jiayi knew that there was no way he would get away with it, so he hoped Hao Ren would not get involved again.\u201cHuang Xujie\u2019s father is the Deputy Mayor. If his dad says anything in the basketball team\u2019s favor, there is nothing left for us to do,\u201d Zhao Jiayi sat Hao Ren down with force and pointed out gloomily.Gloom had gradually taken over Hao Ren\u2019s face as well. He found himself extremely naive for oversimplifying the scale of the matter.After Huang Xujie and his group walked away, Cao Ronghua asked Hao Ren in a daze, \u201cHow did you break the glass?\u201dWith a bitter smile, Hao Ren replied, \u201cThe restaurant owner gave me a glass that already had cracks in it.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Zhou Liren, who believed he was stronger than Hao Ren, skeptically held up the glass in his hand and started squeezing it with full force. Yet, nothing happened.Hao Ren did not want to explain himself any further. Glancing over at Huang Xujie who was ordering food and drinks with his friends in a perfectly calm and collected manner, Hao Ren felt a sense of loss.He thought there was no use in being brawny. Zhao Jiayi would surely be at a disadvantage when the school makes their decision.The fact that Huang Xujie looked so comfortably confident seemed to suggest that he might have been guaranteed a favorable outcome and already knew that his friends would not suffer any consequences. That was probably why he didn\u2019t seem to care about what happened and was eating out and having fun with his friends.Again, Hao Ren thought of the basketball team captain who went to see Lu Qing today. He understood that the basketball team had to hold their own ground and would try to look out for their members\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMoreover, Lu Qing would try to protect me due to his special hidden identity\u2026 In the end, Zhao Jiayi would likely be the sole scapegoat\u2026\u201dLooking at his good friend Zhao Jiayi who was sitting on the other side of the table and was trying to drown his worries in alcohol, Hao Ren vowed to make things right with the broken glass in his hand.However, his parents had not returned from overseas, which meant that he could not make use of any of their connections\u2026 Also, the incident was known to the entire school, and the school\u2019s management team must have been properly informed. Therefore, Lu Qing alone might not be able to turn things around\u2026For Zhao Jiayi\u2019s sake, Hao Ren was willing to withstand embarrassment and shame. Obviously, the reason Huang Xujie could behave so recklessly at school was that his father was the Deputy Mayor. Yet, Hao Ren\u2019s nominal future father-in-law was actually the biggest shareholder of East Ocean University, and his company was the economic leader of the entire East Ocean City!! What could that entail?Hao Ren decided he must make the school handle the incident fairly. Or else it would be shameful for him, the son-in-law of such a prominent figure!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64: Grandma\u2019s Suspicion Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedWhen they finally returned to their dorm room, all four of them were feeling a little intoxicated. Still, Hao Ren was the soberest. After such stressful events, Hao Ren should have stayed in the dorm to care for Zhao Jiayi. However, at this time, he dearly missed his grandma who had recently been discharged from the hospital. Also, he would like to have Zhao Guang\u2019s advise on the matter. Hence, Hao Ren gathered up his materials and took the bus to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s home. When he arrived at Zhao Yanzi\u2019s, it was already seven o\u2019clock in the evening. Zhao Hongyu had just finished cleaning up after dinner and had joined Hao Ren\u2019s grandma for conversations while watching TV. As Hao Ren entered the house, he was surprised to see the healthy glow on his grandma\u2019s face. \u201cRen, we were just talking about you! I thought you are not coming tonight.\u201d seated cozily on the couch, Grandma was pleasantly surprised to see Hao Ren. \u201cSomething happened at the school, so I couldn\u2019t leave until later. How are you feeling, Grandma?\u201d Hao Ren asked. \u201cHaha! Never better! Even my blood pressure has returned to optimal levels!\u201d Grandma\u2019s answer was loud and clear. Indeed, Hao Ren thought Grandma\u2019s face looked vigorous, nothing like a recovering patient. In fact, she was looking a few years younger than before. Standing next to Grandma, Zhao Hongyu smiled in silence. \u201cHongyu took excellent care of me, after all. She\u2019s been making me chicken soup every day for the past two days, so my body has recovered quickly and grown even stronger!\u201d Grandma added as she looked to Zhao Hongyu appreciatively. Hao Ren suspected that Zhao Hongyu had been putting some elixir in the chicken soup. The more he looked at her smile, the more he believed it. By all means, it could also be that Grandma was in a great mood, so she was able to recover quickly. In any case, seeing that his grandma was in good health, Hao Ren finally felt relieved. He turned to Zhao Hongyu and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Zi?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s working on her homework upstairs, go join her. I will chat with your grandma some more,\u201d Zhao Hongyu responded kindly. \u201cOkay!\u201d carrying his stuff, Hao Ren started climbing up the stairs. On his way, he turned to look at Zhao Hongyu and Grandma who were in the living room. He found that they were getting along exceptionally well and seemed to have developed a relationship even closer than that of Grandma and her own daughter-in-law. \u201cWhat an interesting world this is,\u201d he thought. Soon, he arrived at the door of Zhao Yanzi\u2019s room. Quietly pushing open the door, he found Zhao Yanzi sitting in front of her desk and burying herself in homework. Hearing the door, Zhao Yanzi turned around and immediately let out a \u201chumph\u201d at Hao Ren. \u201cWhat now? What did I do to piss you off this time?\u201d Hao Ren walked over and returned the few textbooks he had borrowed from her last time. \u201cMy mom made a lot of your favorite dishes tonight. Yet, with just a phone call telling her that you were not coming to dinner, you made all her good intention and effort go to waste,\u201d pouting her lips, Zhao Yanzi replied grumpily. \u201cOh?\u201d as he only learned that from Zhao Yanzi right now, Hao Ren felt surprised and touched. \u201cSomething happened in school today so that I couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d Hao Ren explained as he sat down next to her and started pulling out materials from his bag. Zhao Yanzi ignored Hao Ren\u2019s remark as she continued to puff out her cheeks, looking like a pufferfish. \u201cYour midterm exams are this Friday, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Hao Ren asked. \u201cYeah,\u201d Zhao Yanzi nodded her head lightly. She was wearing a ruffle layered printed top and a pair of mid-length khaki pants, looking nifty and vivacious. Yet, the outfit also made her seem especially sweet. Her lovely petite body gave off a faint after-shower fragrance, slightly stimulating Hao Ren\u2019s olfactory sensations. She was no doubt the daughter of a renowned designer as even her casually matched outfits were even flawlessly brilliant. \u201cLet\u2019s review for the midterms then,\u201d Hao Ren suggested as he spread out the materials. After having read the textbooks Zhao Yanzi lent him, Hao Ren now had a clear understanding of her learning progress and was able to pinpoint the areas that she should focus on. Therefore, he could now tutor Zhao Yanzi in a way that would better help her prepare for the midterm exams. Surprisingly, Zhao Yanzi did not try to argue but simply followed Hao Ren\u2019s instructions this time and began the review session at once. In the end, it turned out to be the most productive tutoring session Hao Ren had had with her thus far. Hao Ren felt that Zhao Yanzi was genuinely trying to learn. He could tell that she was taking the midterm exams seriously this time. After he finished arranging and refreshing the important concepts of each subject for her once, two hours had already passed. Hao Ren suddenly stopped lecturing and turned to her as he said, \u201cYou should go to bed now. I\u2019ll go check on my grandma.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Zhao Yanzi nodded while her head was still down, busily organizing the notes from today\u2019s lecture. Her unexpected compliance had caught Hao Ren off guard. For a second, he suspected whether if the Zhao Yanzi before him really was the real Zhao Yanzi. Quietly, he left the room and moved to the next room to visit his grandma. \u201cAre you done tutoring Zi?\u201d lying in bed, Grandma was still awake as if she had been expecting Hao Ren. \u201cYep. We didn\u2019t finish going through everything, but we will do that over the next few days,\u201d Hao Ren sat down on Grandma\u2019s bed as he answered. \u201cRen, I feel that your relationship with Zi\u2019s family is not as simple as you have said. When I asked Hongyu about it, she kept telling me that you are only Zi\u2019s tutor,\u201d Grandma focused her attention on Hao Ren and said, \u201cIs there something you are hiding from me?\u201d \u201cUh\u2026 no,\u201d Hao Ren shook his head, \u201cI just became really close to her family.\u201d \u201cAlright. Anyway, I am greatly indebted to Hongyu and her family for saving my life, so you must do your best to tutor Zi,\u201d Grandma gently put her hand on Hao Ren\u2019s shoulder as she said. In the few days she had spent at Zhao Hongyu\u2019s home, Grandma felt that the Zhao\u2019s were treating her as if she was a senior member of their own. The way they were so respectful and considerate towards her made her believe that the Zhao\u2019s was indeed a family of great virtues. For instance, Zi had been giving Grandma greetings every morning and night. In the morning, Zi would come to wake Grandma up for breakfast; and after Zi came home from school every night, she would check on Grandma and see how she was doing. Grandma had grown very fond of Zi as she felt Zi was attentive and understanding. As a result, Grandma had decided that even after she recovered and returned to the cottage by the ocean, she would not cut ties with Zhao Hongyu and her family. Moreover, she was planning to introduce her son to the Zhao\u2019s. No matter how busy life could get, they would try to maintain a good relationship with the Zhao\u2019s, and she hoped that the friendship between the two families could last generations. On the other hand, Grandma thought it was a pity that Zi was a few years too young and did not seem to have any romantic feelings for Hao Ren. Otherwise, the two teenagers could make a great couple\u2026 Slowly, as Grandma\u2019s imagination was running wild, her old-fashioned idealism had also resurfaced again. She kept thinking that since it was impossible for Zhao Hongyu to be her daughter-in-law, it would still be great if the two families could be relatives by marriage. If that happened, the ties between the families would be more cemented and complete. \u201cUnfortunately, Zi is too young to be Ren\u2019s girlfriend,\u201d Grandma thought disappointingly. Hao Ren certainly had no idea about Grandma\u2019s crazily wild imaginations that suited her traditional ways of thinking. He focused on telling her about his school life in their on-and-off conversation, just the way he had when they lived by the ocean. Just like that, half an hour had gone by, and it was time for Hao Ren to leave for school. Although Hao Ren was ready to return to school, Grandma was not willing to part with her darling grandson yet. \u201cHongyu said that you could stay here tonight. You can take my room or the studio in the attic.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s alright, Grandma. I should go back to school. It wouldn\u2019t be very convenient if I stayed out too often,\u201d Hao Ren tried to comfort her. Actually, he was still worried about Zhao Jiayi and wanted to go back to be with him. \u201cTrue. Staying out too often might negatively affect your school work. You should be on your way then,\u201d Grandma had hoped Hao Ren could stay for the night, but she also did not want him to do poorly in school. \u201cYep. You rest well, too, Grandma. I will come to see you again tomorrow,\u201d while browsing his grandmother\u2019s spotless room, Hao Ren got up from the bed and walked out. From the corridor on the second floor, Hao Ren could see that the light was still on in the study room next to the living room on the first floor, he assumed Zhao Guang had not gone to bed yet. After he climbed down the stairs, as expected, he found the door of the study room wide open, and Zhao Guang who had a big shirt draped over his shoulders was reading over some files. Hao Ren walked to the door and knocked. Zhao Guang looked up. When he saw Hao Ren, he nodded faintly and said, \u201cCome in.\u201d \u201cUncle, I would like your opinion on something,\u201d as he entered the study room, Hao Ren looked up at the clock and saw that it was almost ten o\u2019clock. Hao Ren thought Zi\u2019s father was always serious in both speech and manner. Nonetheless, Hao Ren could tell that Zhao Guang did indeed have an enormous amount of work to take care of. He secretly hoped that Zhao Guang would not get annoyed when asked to be involved in such a small school affair. \u201cYes?\u201d Zhao Guang put down the files in his hands and looked straight at Hao Ren. \u201cWell, here\u2019s what happened. A classmate of mine fought with the school\u2019s basketball team today\u2026\u201d Hao Ren told Zhao Guang the entire incident, including its causes and potential effects. Sitting in his chair and facing Hao Ren, Zhao Guang listened quietly and collectedly, not giving away any thoughts he might have. \u201cIs that all? You participated in the fight as well?\u201d after Hao Ren finished talking, Zhao Guang finally opened his mouth. Hao Ren nodded in response. It was awkward for him to ask Zhao Guang to get involved and help him out as Zhao Guang was not his father after all. On top of that, Hao Ren had already troubled them once with Grandma\u2019s incident, and Grandma was now staying in their home. Hao Ren had always been thin-skinned and was now afraid that asking for Zhao Guang\u2019s help again would make him seem hopelessly shameless. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come to me for matters like these,\u201d Zhao Guang looked at Hao Ren and stated coldly. Hao Ren\u2019s heart sank. He felt that he had upset Zhao Guang, just as he had anticipated. \u201cGo talk to Lu Qing tomorrow,\u201d Zhao Guang added. Hao Ren\u2019s face was flaming red due to embarrassment. As he was ready to bid his goodbye, Zhao Guang spoke again, \u201cI will give the principal a call about this shortly. Your classmate\u2019s name is Zhao Jiayi, correct?\u201d A sliver of hope rose in Hao Ren. Gazing at Zhao Guang who was aloof looking but was always willing to help, Hao Ren expressed his gratitude heartfully, \u201cYes, thank you, Uncle!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s alright. According to your account of the incident, you guys were not at any serious fault. I also hope the school can handle these matters more impartially. At any rate, be careful in the future,\u201d Zhao Guang looked up at the clock and continued, \u201cYou are staying here tonight, right?\u201d \u201cNo, I should get back to school now,\u201d Hao Ren responded. \u201cI still have a lot of work to process here, is it okay for you to go back on your own?\u201d Zhao Guang asked. \u201cI will be fine! Thanks again, Uncle!\u201d Hao Ren turned and gleefully walked out of the study room. When he went back to the second floor and tried to retrieve his teaching materials from Zhao Yanzi\u2019s room, he found that Zhao Yanzi had fallen asleep on her desk. Hao Ren tiptoed to the desk and quietly observed her face and hands that were turning red from being pressed against the desk. \u201cShe definitely seems to be trying her best to study for these midterms,\u201d Hao Ren thought; he had never seen her work so seriously before. Watching her sleeping so sweetly, Hao Ren did not want to wake her up. However, he was also concerned that she might catch a cold or wake up with a sore back. Therefore, after a moment of consideration, Hao Ren bent down, placed one hand underneath her knees and the other on her back, gently lifting her up. Zhao Yanzi seemed to be in a deep sleep as Hao Ren\u2019s action did not wake her at all. Her eyes had remained closed, and her breathing stayed calm. Carrying Zhao Yanzi who was soft like a plushie, Hao Ren was immersed in her sweet scent. Promptly, he placed her carefully on her bed and tucked her in with the quilt. Then, he picked up his materials and tiptoed to the door again. Before he walked out and closed the door, he turned off the big lights and left a small one on. As the door closed, Zhao Yanzi who was \u201cdeeply asleep\u201d, slowly opened her eyes as a blush of red instantly covered her face. \u201cThat jerk\u2026\u201d she whispered quietly in her heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As the entrance of the dorm had not yet closed, he hurriedly took a taxi back to school.At this time, more than a dozen people had gathered in Room 302. They were all male students from neighboring dorm rooms.Seated sparsely on the beds, chairs, and desks, they were trying to come up with a way to deal with this situation.\u201cHow come you\u2019re so late?\u201d Yu Rong questioned Hao Ren as he saw Hao Ren walk in.\u201cI had some tutoring to do tonight,\u201d Hao Ren answered.\u201cZhao Jiayi is about to get expelled, and you are still in the mood to go tutor someone?\u201d Yu Rong seemed a little irritated.\u201cWho said Zhao Jiayi is getting expelled?\u201d Hao Ren asked sincerely as he placed his tutoring materials on his desk and turned to Yu Rong.\u201cI heard from a few friends of mine who are a part of the Student Council. They said that the school is taking the incident very seriously and will be strict in handling it,\u201d Yu Rong explained.Yu Rong was the best source for information in the Dorm Building No.7, and no one would ever question his sources.\u201cYou know what they mean by strictly handling; ordinary students with no powerful connections will be the ones suffering the consequences,\u201d Yu Rong added.\u201cExactly. There was a similar incident before; a student and the basketball team fought over the use of a court, and it wasn\u2019t even as bad as this one. Yet, that student got a disciplinary warning,\u201d Gu Jiadong interrupted.\u201cI was in the fight, too. They\u2019d better penalize me as well,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cYou will be fine!\u201d Yu Rong stated, \u201cMy friends in the Student Council told me that the nature of fight would be examined. The one who started the fight would be the most at fault. Your initial intention was to mediate the fight but accidentally got caught in the fight and had injured others, so it was not that bad. When both sides are at fault, the side who threw the first punch will receive harsher penalties. Besides, we all know the school has always been partial to the basketball team.\u201dHis words made everyone\u2019s face somber. Zhao Jiayi was sitting by his bed, not knowing what to say.Zhao Jiayi was quite popular among the residents in Dorm Building No.7. He was frank and straightforward, an overall passionate and friendly person. Therefore, knowing that he could face severe consequences, everyone was upset and worried.If Zhao Jiayi were to be expelled from the school for something like this\u2026\u201cGuys, guys, there\u2019s no use talking about this. Everyone, go back to your room and get some rest now,\u201d Hao Ren waved at the crowd as he asserted.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Go, don\u2019t worry about me!\u201d Zhao Jiayi got up and started driving the crowd out as well.Knowing that they could not be of much help by staying and might only upset Zhao Jiayi even more, everyone began walking out of Room 302.When the four were left in the room alone, silence had instantaneously taken over. One by one, they each went back to their own beds. After, Hao Ren said to Zhao Jiayi who was resting below him, \u201cZhao Jiayi, don\u2019t worry, everything should be fine.\u201d\u201cHaha,\u201d Zhao Jiayi responded with bitter laughter. He seemed to think that there was no way of escaping his doom.\u201cDo your parents know about this yet?\u201d Zhou Liren was concerned.\u201cI didn\u2019t tell them!\u201d Zhao Jiayi responded.\u201cOr we can start a petition against the basketball team to reveal their detestable behaviors!\u201d Cao Ronghua who slept on the berth below Zhou Liren shouted out.\u201cDon\u2019t be naive. It is obvious that the school would do anything to protect the basketball team,\u201d fiddling with the coin in his hands, Zhao Jiayi said calmly.\u201cAy, let\u2019s go to sleep! We will deal with this tomorrow!\u201d Zhao Jiayi turned off the light with a smack.With heavy hearts, no one spoke again that night.The next day, Zhao Jiayi went to class as usual with Hao Ren and the others. However, the more he casually joked and laughed with Zhou Liren and the others, the more his classmates could tell that he was laden with anxiety.After all, all he could do now was wait for the school\u2019s official statement.After they finished their morning classes, Hao Ren excused himself from having lunch with the others and stealthily got into the Administrative Building. He was heading to the 6th floor for Lu Qing, the vice principal.This time, he brought along Lu Qing\u2019s business card. This way, if Lu Qing was not in his office, he could reach him directly by phone.Knock, knock\u2026 Just as Hao Ren started gently knocking on the door, Lu Qing\u2019s voice came through, \u201cPlease come in.\u201dHao Ren opened the door and walked in. He saw Lu Qing seated at his desk, looking up some information.\u201cHello, El\u2026 Principal,\u201d Hao Ren greeted. The moment he opened his mouth, he suddenly became unsure whether he should address him as Elder Lu or Principal Lu.\u201cGongzi Hao, come in and have a seat,\u201d pointing at the chair across from his, Lu Qing said politely.Hao Ren closed the door and sat down across from him uneasily. \u201cYou can just call me by my name,\u201d he said.This was his first interaction with Lu Qing as his vice principal. Moreover, it was taking place in the vice principal\u2019s office at the university. Hao Ren had never imagined he would one day be talking directly with any high-rank personnel from the school management team.\u201cHehe, alright.\u201d Lu Qing nodded with a smile.\u201cI am here to talk to you about the fight that took place yesterday,\u201d Hao Ren went straight to the point, \u201cI believe you have heard that I also participated in the fight. It seems that the school is planning to deal with the student who initiated the dispute harshly. You see, that student is a good friend of mine\u2026\u201d\u201cAbout this,\u201d Lu Qing stopped Hao Ren and said \u201cIt had already been discussed at the school affair meeting today. From the school\u2019s perspective, such incidents could influence the entire school\u2019s spirit and discipline. Hence, we must handle it seriously.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Hao Ren\u2019s heart began to sink at Lu Qing\u2019s words. He wondered if Zhao Guang\u2019s phone call exerted any impact.\u201cHow do you think this incident should be dealt with?\u201d Lu Qing suddenly turned his focus on Hao Ren.Hao Ren hesitated for half a second then stated, \u201cTo me, I think the basketball team initiated the provocation, and Zhao Jiayi had no choice but to fight back. The basketball team was the most at fault. Not to mention, most of the students have been upset about the basketball team overtaking the outdoor basketball courts when they have their own training facility\u2026\u201dLu Qing looked to Hao Ren with his smiley eyes and interrupted, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me your reasoning. Just tell me how you\u2019d handle this.\u201d\u201cZhao Jiayi was not the most at fault and was also injured by their joint attacks. At most, he needs some advice and disciplining from the Guidance Counsellor. As for those on the basketball team, it should be in the rules that they are not allowed to occupy the outdoor basketball courts which are intended for the use of regular students. Also, they jointly assaulted a student, and they should at least receive disciplinary measures for their actions,\u201d Hao Ren proposed.Observing Hao Ren, Lu Qing was silent for a few seconds. Then abruptly, he nodded his head and said, \u201cGood, let\u2019s do as you said.\u201dHao Ren looked at Lu Qing, shocked by his response. He only intended to raise some suggestions and hoped to clarify his attitude. He did not expect Lu Qing to make the decision based on what he had said.\u201cActually, the principal did mean to be stricter about this,\u201d Lu Qing seemed to be able to read Hao Ren\u2019s thoughts. He leaned forward and asked, \u201cYou asked Zi\u2019s father to make a phone call, didn\u2019t you?\u201dHao Ren nodded lightly.\u201cThe boss is very busy, try not to bother him with such small things in the future. I knew immediately that the boss had quietly exerted his influence when the principal clearly stated his stance to be partial to the regular students at today\u2019s meeting,\u201d Lu Qing said with a chuckle.Hao Ren tried to explain, \u201cI was just so worried\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha,\u201d Lu Qing looked to Hao Ren in a kind and friendly way, \u201cYou broke through the second level already?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes, that was a few days ago.\u201d\u201cGood job,\u201d Lu Qing seemed gratified. \u201cI\u2019d never imagined that Su Han would be willing to help anyone cultivate in person. She is the second best master I know of. Learning from her, you will progress rapidly for sure.\u201dHao Ren supposed the No.1 master would be Zhao Yanzi\u2019s Third Uncle \u2013 Zhao Kuo. Nevertheless, he had had a taste of Zhao Kuo\u2019s violent temper and did not expect to receive any guidance or pointers from him.\u201cI still have classes in the afternoon. I should go now,\u201d Hao Ren said as he got up. It was making him uncomfortable to stay in the vice principal\u2019s office for too long.\u201cGo\u2026\u201d Lu Qing waved at him casually. .After getting out of the Administrative Building, he went for lunch in the cafeteria. He planned to meet up with Zhao Jiayi and the others in the afternoon and continue going to class.After forcing himself to smile and act normal for the whole morning, Zhao Jiayi had become enervated by the afternoon. He cushioned his arms with his books underneath and decided to take a nap.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBreaking news! Breaking news!\u201dA few minutes before the class was about to start, Yu Rong rushed into the classroom, waving both of his arms in the air as he shouted, \u201cThe notice of disciplinary measures is out!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d everyone in the class including Xie Yujia looked up curiously and anxiously.Expectantly, Zhao Jiayi\u2019s head also immediately bounced up from the desk.\u201cThe notice is posted in the display window on the first floor of the Administrative Building. The students on the basketball team who were involved in the fight: four are receiving disciplinary measures, two are given verbal warnings, and they are all temporarily expelled from the basketball team! Moreover, they are to pay for Zhao Jiayi\u2019s medical expenses! The most important thing is, Zhao Jiayi is exempted, and so is Hao Ren!\u201d Yu Rong screamed exhilaratingly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated\u201cAlso, the school specified that from now on, the players on basketball team would not be allowed to use the outdoor basketball courts without authorization. Or else, they will be harshly punished if any disputes over the use of the court are to happen again,\u201d Yu Rong added.The news from Yu Rong greatly astounded the entire class. At first, they all believed that the school\u2019s final decision would victimize Zhao Jiayi. Yet, he was not penalized in any way at all. On top of that, the four people on the basketball team who were injured now had to compensate Zhao Jiayi for his medical expenses.\u201cDoes Zhao Jiayi have a powerful background or what?\u201d\u201cNo wonder he was so collected in the morning\u2026.\u201d\u201cHe must have relatives who are government officials, right?\u201d\u201cIs Yu Rong joking? How is it possible that the school would penalize the players on the basketball team?\u201dInstantly, a discussion broke out and began spreading to all corners of the classroom.Zhao Jiayi could not believe the news himself, either. He wondered if his ears had failed him. Unlike what his classmates were speculating, it was out of dignity that he tried to remain calm this morning. He had no last measure or influential background.Seeing that people doubted the accuracy of the news he brought, Yu Rong took out his phone. \u201cThis is a photo that my friend took and sent to me! If you don\u2019t believe it, then go check the display window at the Administrative Building yourselves!\u201d he shouted.\u201cLet me see! Let me see!\u201d the male students yelled out eagerly.Yu Rong passed his phone to them. One by one, the guys were uttering an \u201cOh\u201d to show that they were now finally convinced.As for Xie Yujia, who was seated in the front, she turned around to observe the guys jumping and running in excitement. Biting her lips, her brows furrowed slightly.Indeed, she did try to help Zhao Jiayi by talking to the school management team. Still, she did not expect the school to favor Zhao Jiayi like this completely. Moreover, the school did not handle this in the way that would reconcile all parties involved as she had anticipated. Instead, they heavily penalized the basketball team.Now that the basketball match between East Ocean University and Jinghua University was about to start, she could not understand why the school would make such a decision at all.Out of the six members of the basketball team, four of them were now dismissed. She couldn\u2019t imagine how much it would impact her older brother\u2019s basketball team\u2026 Grasping the pen in her hand, Xie Yujia was very concerned.At this time, she was no longer worried about Zhao Jiayi and Hao Ren but how her brother would react to this situation.Shortly, their lecturer arrived in the classroom and stopped the chattering from growing any further. Yet, during the lecture, whispers could still be heard.Zhou Liren and Cao Ronghua who were seated in the back continued to talk among themselves excitedly.Especially Zhou Liren, whose face was bright red and was now lowering his voice to blurt out, \u201cOne who survives a great disaster is destined to good fortune forever! Zhao Jiayi, you have to treat us to dinner!\u201d\u201cF*ck, I don\u2019t even know what is going on.\u201dThe happiness came too soon and too abruptly. Zhao Jiayi was still a little confused, but he could not hide the blooming smile on his face.Also, Zhao Jiayi did not want to deliberately explain himself as he did not care if people thought he had a powerful background or not.Only Hao Ren knew what was going on. Yet, he did not want to claim credit for it. As long as his good friend Zhao Jiayi was fine, he was happy.After all, the arrogant bullies on the basketball team did deserve a lesson.Besides, Hao Ren began to imagine Huang Xujie\u2019s reaction to this news. That guy was extremely confident yesterday\u2026After class, the crowd was cheering for Zhao Jiayi and asked him to treat everyone to milk tea. Since he was in such a merry mood, Zhao Jiayi agreed. So, in the end, everyone in the class received a drink for this celebratory occasion.At four in the afternoon, Zhao Jiayi further treated the guys to computer games. Hence, the large crowd gleefully headed towards the internet cafe at Hongji Square.Again, Hao Ren excused him and did not join the crowd. Instead, he quietly hurried to the Academic Building F.This time, he made sure he was not being followed before entering Su Han\u2019s office.The door to Su Han\u2019s office was not locked as if she was expecting him. When Hao Ren walked in, he saw that Su Han had her eyes tightly shut and was completely immersed in her own cultivation.Gently, he closed the door and sat down in the chair across from Su Han. He did not want to interrupt her, so he quietly began cultivating the Spirit Concentration Scroll.A burst of faint energy rushed from his Dantian to his Huiyin Acupoint and then Guowei Acupoint. Afterward, it ascended to Mingmen Acupoint, Yuzhen Acupoint, Baihui Acupoint, and passed Danzhong Acupoint to Shenque Acupoint, then back to his Dantian.In this continuous loop, it seemed that his body was being nourished and had become incredibly at ease. In addition, Su Han\u2019s office was facing the lawn and the garden outside of the building. With its fresh air and serene environment, it was indeed the perfect location in the school for cultivation.This gentle and warm energy had filled up half of his body, and he could no longer absorb any more of it. Reluctantly, he opened his eyes.He saw that Su Han had also finished her cultivation and was calmly looking at him from the seat across.With her backdrop being the brown bead curtain, Su Han, who was in light-colored clothing, looked as if she was a beauty in a painting.Calmly, she lifted her slender hand and picked up the teapot on the table. With her fingers slightly curled, she started pouring the bright green colored tea into two crystal clear cups made of white jade.\u201cPlease,\u201d She uttered.Hao Ren nodded his head and held up the teacup. As he took a small sip, he felt that its aroma had seeped through and taken root in his mouth. His entire body was becoming light and agile.Picking up the teacup with her white wrist elegantly, Su Han also took a sip.Silence had taken over the room as a light breeze came in through the window and made the bamboo curtain beside Su Han to flutter.\u201cI didn\u2019t come yesterday because of an incident that happened in the school,\u201d Hao Ren said as he decided to break the silence.\u201cNot my concern,\u201d Su Han coldly stated.Now that his words were met with rejection, Hao Ren could only stop talking again. Still, he thought hard to come up with another topic, \u201cThe last time I went to the GreenStone Mountain with Zi\u2019s family, I ran into a stone monument in the Daoist Temple situated at the summit. However, I did not quite understand the writing on it.\u201d\u201cWell, see if you can recite it for me,\u201d Su Han replied.Hao Ren recalled for a moment and was able to recite the writing for her.Su Han listened carefully. When Hao Ren finished reciting, she explained, \u201cThis monument was supposedly left behind by Daoist Master Zhang when he achieved ascension. It was allegedly his enlightenment about the Heavenly Dao, so it does have a lot of history behind it. However, in the past few hundred years, no one was able to understand the writing fully. Therefore, even though it is widely known, it is not of much use.\u201d\u201cNot able to fully understand it? Because of it, I almost had a breakthrough of the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll,\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself secretly.\u201cSpeaking of the GreenStone Mountain, there is a senior of the Dragon Tribe who resides there. The reason Zhao Guang took you to the GreenStone Mountain was probably to visit him,\u201d Su Han added.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuddenly, she raised her head and muttered to herself, \u201cIt seems like he has started to get ready by drawing people over to his side.\u201dNow that Su Han looked mysterious and preoccupied, Hao Ren couldn\u2019t help but ask her, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201dSu Han looked at him with her brow slightly furrowed, \u201cHumph, do you think it is such a simple matter to be Zhao Guang\u2019s son-in-law?\u201d she said. After that, she waved her hand. \u201cAlright, it\u2019s six now.\u201dKnowing that Zhao Hongyu didn\u2019t even want to get on the wrong side of Su Han, Hao Ren did not inquire any further and was about to get up and leave.\u201cActually,\u201d right when Hao Ren was about to walk out of the office, Su Han stopped him and said, \u201cI\u2019ll teach you a set of techniques that would allow you to control your strength better, so you won\u2019t injure people again.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(2 in 1 Chapter) Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedHao Ren stopped walking and turned around to look at her.Although Su Han was cold, it was worth it to cultivate here as long as he could learn something from her.This so-called Heavenly Master was also an Inspector in the Dragon Tribe. She should have a decent amount of precious dharma treasures and cultivation techniques.Hao Ren was very clear about what he wanted. Not only for himself, but he also needed to keep a good relationship with Su Han for the sake of East Ocean Dragon Clan.Sure enough, Su Han waved at him and said, \u201cCome over. I\u2019ll teach you a technique.\u201dAfter Hao Ren walked to her, Su Han pointed at his forehead with her long slim finger and transferred the thoughts into his head. Hao Ren memorized the simple spell that had three sentences easily.\u201cHow can I use it?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cIt must be used with an object, and here it is,\u201d as she said that, two silver bracelets magically appeared in her palm.She lightly smiled at Hao Ren and said, \u201cPut it on.\u201dHe warily stared at the bracelets in her smooth palm and didn\u2019t reach for them hastily. The necklace Su Han gave him last time was still stuck on his neck.If she were to put two anklets on him next time, then the five accessories could easily restrain him. All Su Han needed to do was control him with her thoughts if that happened.Su Han knew what was worrying Hao Ren, so she smiled again and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You will be able to take these off.\u201dHer light smile was charming; it was as sweet as the glorious flowers of spring. However, it made Hao Ren more worried as he saw the temptation in her smile.\u201cHurry up!\u201d the smile on Su Han\u2019s face disappeared as she flipped the silver bracelets on to Hao Ren\u2019s wrists.At the same time, Hao Ren felt like his arms got as heavy as two giant mountains. Not only did his arms feel like they were almost breaking off, but his legs and feet were also having trouble supporting his body as well.\u201cThe spell I just taught you are for taking these bracelets off. But you may only take them off for two hours each day. Otherwise, the necklace on you will strangle your neck and make you wish you are dead,\u201d Su Han said calmly with her arms folded in front of her.Hao Ren was in severe pain as well as serious regret.\u201cSchemer\u2026such a schemer\u2026\u201d Hao Ren cursed at her 100 times in his mind. He blamed himself for being greedy and not leaving decisively; he did think that she was about to teach him some amazing cultivation technique.\u201cI heard about the fight. On the one hand, these Mount Tai Bracelets can contain your physical force and stop you from hurting people by accident in the future. On the other hand, they can help you cultivate and allow you to control your body more precisely,\u201d Su Han continued.\u201cWell\u2026then\u2026thank you, Su Han,\u201d Hao Ren gritted his teeth; he tried not to show his negative emotions towards her. The heavy bracelets made it difficult for him to lift his hands up, let alone talking.\u201cOn top of that, the bracelets can sense your emotional state and would get heavier when you are in a bad mood. But if you are in a cheerful frame of mind, they would weigh nearly nothing,\u201d Su Han calmly said to him as she stood beside him.\u201cNear nothing\u2026 how heavy is that?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cThey would probably be around 25 kilograms each given that you are in a good mood,\u201d Su Han mentioned lightly.\u201c25 kilograms\u2026\u201d Hao Ren almost collapsed.Hao Ren persuaded himself to believe in Su Han\u2019s \u201cgood intentions\u201d as he walked down from her office with difficulty. Each step was a huge task for him.Maybe it was due to the self-comfort, but the bracelets on his wrists became lighter and lighter as he went down the stairs. Before long, it wasn\u2019t that painful for him to wear them.However, his arms were still heavy as if they were carrying two bags of rice. Fortunately, he was already on the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll, which strengthened his physical body to a large degree. It helped him resist being dragged down to the ground.\u201cSu Han was trying to be nice to me\u2026she is being considerate\u2026\u201d Hao Ren tried his best to keep up a good mood by lying to himself. He walked to the school gate to take the bus to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s house.He arrived there on time as usual, and Zhao Hongyu was making dinner. However, it wasn\u2019t only her who was cooking in the kitchen; Grandma was helping out as well this time.They were chatting while they prepared the dishes as if they had been close friends for years.Hao Ren was glad to see Grandma and Zhao Hongyu getting along so well. His parents were busy with work, and they always needed to go on business trips abroad. Also, he could only visit Grandma on weekends due to his school, and Uncle Wang wasn\u2019t very good at taking care of others as he wasn\u2019t very talkative and spent lots of time with the plants. Therefore, Grandma was still technically living alone other than the fact that Uncle Wang cooked for her.It was a good thing for Grandma to become good friends with Zhao Hongyu at her age. They could chat and cook together when she was living here, and they could call each other from time to time once she moved out.Having seen how well they got along, the bracelets on Hao Ren\u2019s wrists became even lighter.He pushed open the door and entered the kitchen as he said, \u201cI\u2019m back, Auntie, Grandma.\u201d\u201cHehe, you are back. We left the door open knowing it was about time,\u201d Zhao Hongyu laughed softly. She then noticed the silver bracelets on his arm and asked, \u201cAre those little trinkets from Su Han again?\u201d\u201cLittle trinkets? They are nothing good\u2026\u201d Hao Ren secretly found them annoying.The bracelets got a lot heavier immediately when his mood changed, and Hao Ren almost fell over. He immediately started to recite the phrase, \u201cSu Han is a good person\u2026she is only trying to help me\u2026\u201d\u201cWho is this Su Han?\u201d Grandma asked out of curiosity when she heard a girl\u2019s name.\u201cOh, she is a friend of mine, and she teaches at East Ocean University. She has been taking care of Ren at school,\u201d Zhao Hongyu explained to Grandma.\u201cRen is destined to receive help from good people,\u201d Grandma chuckled as she looked at her grandson.\u201cYes, she has been pretty good to him. She is not only helping him with his school work but also giving him some of her homemade trinkets from time to time,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said.Hao Ren began to sweat at the sound of this. Other people would die for something from Su Han, yet he was too scared to get anything from her ever again.Grandma looked down at Hao Ren\u2019s bracelets and said, \u201cYeah, these handcrafted items are really beautiful. What a clever and deft girl. This lady must be very beautiful as well.\u201dZhao Hongyu laughed and nodded. Then, she said to Hao Ren, \u201cZi has already come back, and she\u2019s doing her homework upstairs. Go ahead with your tutoring session.\u201d\u201cUm, ok.\u201d Hao Ren turned around and left the kitchen.\u201cWhat do you think about Zi\u2026\u201d Zhao Hongyu carried on chitchatting with Grandma as Hao Ren walked upstairs in heavy steps.Zhao Yanzi was doing her homework earnestly when Hao Ren walked into her room with some study materials.\u201cIt seems she has been really well-behaved recently\u2026\u201d Hao Ren walked up behind her and coughed slightly.Zhao Yanzi looked back realizing it was Hao Ren. She didn\u2019t say anything; instead, she dragged her chair more to the right.Hao Ren grabbed a chair and sat down beside her. \u201cToday, I\u2019m not going to tutor you like usual; we will just solve questions that confuse you before the exam. Ask me if you have any questions,\u201d he said.\u201cEm,\u201d Zhao Yanzi pouted and pushed her homework to Hao Ren as she said, \u201cI circled the questions I don\u2019t know how to do.\u201d\u201cOk, let me take a look.\u201d Hao Ren took over the notebook, picked up a pen and some paper, and carefully started the calculations.Meanwhile, Zhao Yanzi sat beside Hao Ren, staring at him doing the calculations. She also rolled her eyes and observed him secretly.\u201cHe seems more handsome than usual,\u201d a hazy and beckoning feeling knocked on Zhao Yanzi\u2019s heart.\u201cDressed in a white shirt, nothing special but is fairly neat. No scars on his hands, and he doesn\u2019t seem strong\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi switched from observing Hao Ren\u2019s face to his body.All of a sudden, her eyes locked onto the silver bracelets on Hao Ren\u2019s wrists.\u201cDid Sister Su give you these bracelets?\u201d Zhao Yanzi asked.\u201cYeah,\u201d Hao Ren turned around and looked at her. \u201cYou know about these bracelets?\u201d he asked.Zhao Yanzi nodded and replied, \u201cThey are Mount Tai Bracelets, and only Inspectors have them. They are the same as the handcuffs normal police use to restrain criminals.\u201d\u201cCriminals?\u201d Hao Ren felt quite sensitive about this word.\u201cEm, the Inspector would put these bracelets on the cultivators who made mistakes and broke rules. The purpose is to restrain the strength and the supernatural power so the criminals can\u2019t run away. But it seems that the bracelets given by Sister Su are simply Level 1 Bracelets, which are only used to restrain strength. Moreover, whoever wears it could open it with a secret spell,\u201d Zhao Yanzi explained patiently.Hao Ren stared at the bracelets in shock. Then, he looked at Zhao Yanzi in surprise. He didn\u2019t know anything about the background of these bracelets, and he didn\u2019t expect Zhao Yanzi to get more and more gentle with him.Zhao Yanzi was wearing a set of orange pajamas since she was just staying in her own room. The orange pajamas matched with her youthful face, making her as refreshing as a glass of fresh orange juice.Seeing Hao Ren staring at her in surprise, Zhao Yanzi changed the look on her face and yelled, \u201cDon\u2019t give me that look. After all, these two bracelets are dharma treasures. It is your honor that Sister Su gave them to you.\u201d\u201cFine, fine\u2026\u201d Hao Ren turned around to the desk, trying to refocus on the questions.\u201cSu Han must know about the fight I had on the basketball court. Putting them on me is probably some kind of punishment for me,\u201d Hao Ren wondered at the same time.Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi were soon immersed in the questions and didn\u2019t even realize it was time for dinner. Zhao Hongyu went upstairs in person to tell them, and both of them left the desk and walked downstairs with Zhao Hongyu side by side.While walking downstairs, Zhao Hongyu looked back and saw Zhao Yanzi grabbing onto Hao Ren\u2019s sleeve while walking downstairs carefully, and this mother showed a glad smile immediately.\u201cMom, what are you smiling about?\u201d Zhao Yanzi yelled.\u201cHehe, nothing!\u201d Zhao Hongyu walked to the dining room.Zhao Guang and Grandma had already sat beside the dinner table, and they were talking about something. They waved at Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi when they saw them walking downstairs together.The five people started having dinner joyfully like a real family.During dinner, Zhao Guang unexpectedly brought up a topic. \u201cRen, your grandma said that your parents would be back this Thursday. How about having dinner together this Thursday night so that we can get to know more about each other?\u201d he asked.\u201cHuh?\u201d Hao Ren froze for a second. He had expected that both families would meet each other in some way, but he didn\u2019t think it would be this quick and sudden.\u201cYeah, Hongyu and her family took such good care of me, and I really hope that your parents could invite them to dinner and meet them as soon as possible,\u201d Grandma followed.\u201cEm\u2026\u201d Hao Ren looked at Zhao Guang then at Zhao Hongyu, feeling like something extraordinary would happen at the gathering.Zhao Yanzi stopped eating as well. She stared blankly at the people around the dinner table, waiting for the result. She definitely would have yelled and turned down the family meeting if it was before. However, she had to maintain her \u201clady\u201d image in front of Grandma.\u201cZi will have her midterm exams at school this Friday. So, it will be better for her just to focus on reviewing. We can wait until the weekend and then talk about the meeting,\u201d after thinking for a while, Hao Ren suggested.\u201cAlright, if that\u2019s what it is\u2026\u201d Grandma felt really puzzled just now. She was wondering why Hao Ren was so hesitant when it was time for him to show his appreciation to Zi\u2019s parents. Now, she knew it was all because he was concerned about Zhao Yanzi\u2019s midterm exams.\u201cYeah! Yeah!\u201d Zhao Yanzi nodded in agreement instantly as she didn\u2019t want to go to the next so-called parents-meeting stage so quickly.\u201cYou had never taken exams so seriously before. You even went out during the final exams last time. How come you are so serious about it this time? We\u2019ll see what grades you get,\u201d Zhao Guang said to Zhao Yanzi.Hearing Zhao Guang\u2019s words, Zhao Yanzi pouted discontentedly.\u201cZi has been work really hard on reviewing recently,\u201d Hao Ren interrupted.\u201cHum! I don\u2019t need you to put in a good word for me!\u201d Zhao Yanzi suddenly got mad for no reason.\u201cFine, fine, there is no rush. Then we will discuss this matter on the weekend,\u201d Grandma tried to mediate the dispute.After dinner, Zhao Yanzi decided that she didn\u2019t need Hao Ren\u2019s help reviewing. Therefore, Hao Ren had to go back to the university helplessly.It was really hard to guess what the girl was thinking about. It wouldn\u2019t work out either way if Hao Ren went along or against her.As a consequence, Hao Ren went back to the dorm earlier than before. Zhao Jiayi, who just got away from a tragedy, was playing cards with Zhou Liren and Cao Ronghua.Hao Ren put the materials away on his desk and was about to get on his bed to have some rest. However, Zhao Jiayi suddenly grabbed his wrist. \u201cWhat the hell, where did you get these bracelets?\u201d he asked.\u201cFrom some booth on the side of the road, just for fun,\u201d Hao Ren answered exhaustedly.\u201cBracelets, are you a girl?\u201d Zhou Liren said immediately.Hao Ren didn\u2019t know what to say. He knew that if Zhou Liren ever found out that these bracelets were from Su Han, this man would be willing to wear them all over his body.\u201cBut they are nice bracelets,\u201d Cao Ronghua got closer and took a better look at the two bracelets on Hao Ren\u2019s wrist as he commented.\u201cSeems like they match your necklace,\u201d Zhao Jiayi\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cdon\u2019t tell me they are from Su Han again?\u201d\u201cThey do seem to match!\u201d Zhou Liren finally found out this secret and started screaming.\u201cDon\u2019t be so gossipy!\u201d pushing Zhou Liren\u2019s face away, Hao Ren jumped onto his bed to rest. However, the bed was bending so much that it almost broke.\u201cBe mild, be mild!\u201d Zhao Jiayi yelled.\u201cHow can it be mild when you are wearing bracelets that weigh 50 kilograms\u2026\u201d Hao Ren sighed in his mind as he picked up the book beside his pillow.The Wednesday was as ordinary as usual. What the students talked about most was the discipline announcement posted in the Administrative Building. However, this matter didn\u2019t have any influence on Hao Ren anymore.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe had to tutor Zhao Yanzi at night, and her attitude wasn\u2019t reckless nor passionate; Hao Ren had no idea if he did something that offended her.Hence, in a flash, it was Thursday again.Ting! The signal light for text messages lit up on his cell phone.Hao Ren sleepily opened his phone during class and found out that the message was from Xie Yujia.\u201cAcademician Hao and Academician Yue will be giving lectures on science at eight o\u2019clock tonight. Would you like to go with me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why me?\u201d after thinking for a while, Hao Ren replied to her message. Shortly afterward, he got another message from Xie Yujia, \u201cI\u2019m inviting you so that you can appreciate real scientists\u2019 elegant demeanor!\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s ok; I have enjoyed that quite often\u2026\u201d Hao Ren sent back another message languidly.Based on his experience, Xie Yujia won\u2019t reply messages frequently. Moreover, it was during class time; a good student like her would never waste her note-taking time on texting.However, beyond Hao Ren\u2019s expectations, Xie Yujia pursued hotly this time. She texted a message back immediately, \u201cDon\u2019t be so glib-tongued! You should be respectful towards the great scientists! Just because you don\u2019t have respect for them, I have to take you to experience it!\u201dOn top of texting Hao Ren back, Xie Yujia, who was sitting in the front row, turned around and stared at Hao Ren from a distance. It was obvious that she was monitoring him.\u201cWho is Xie Yujia looking back at? She seems angry,\u201d Zhou Liren, who sat beside Hao Ren, asked him.\u201cEm, I have no idea,\u201d Hao Ren answered while acting innocent.He looked down at his phone and found that another message had come in, \u201cA lot of people want to go to the lecture, but the admission is limited. I was only able to get two tickets through my connections at the Student Council! That\u2019s it; I have to focus on class now!\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Hao Ren sighed slightly.\u201cThis Class President takes things too seriously. I was just saying casually last time, but she insists that I have to go with her,\u201d he thought as he rubbed his sore arms, laid them back on the desk, and went back to napping. However, the desk was making crunching noises due to the weight of the bracelets. It wasn\u2019t a good feeling carrying at least 50 kilograms around.The afternoon was filled with mostly easy courses like English, and Hao Ren didn\u2019t take the same classes as Xie Yujia.Ever since Su Han gave him the little gifts, Hao Ren had been too scared to go to her. The closer he got to Su Han, the more terrifying she seemed.Therefore, after four o\u2019clock, Hao Ren killed some time in his dorm until six o\u2019clock. Then, he went to the cafeteria for dinner with Zhao Jiayi and the other two guys, and they went to Philosophy class next.The course was scheduled from six to seven forty-five. When the class ended, there was a flood of people trying to get out because the classroom was packed.Hao Ren and the other three guys usually sat in the last row. Thus, they were at the end of the crowd when class ended.\u201cZhao Jiayi, let\u2019s go for some midnight snacks! It is on you since you survived the tragedy!\u201d Zhou Liren said as he tried to push forward in the crowd.\u201cDamn! You have been saying that from Tuesday to Thursday, and I have treated you so many times already!\u201d Zhao Jiayi punched Zhou Liren\u2019s back.Zhou Liren giggled as he turned around and said, \u201cCao Ronghua, how about you treat us this time?\u201dThe four of them walked out of the classroom while pushing each other around.All of a sudden, Xie Yujia, who was dressed in a royal blue skirt, appeared in front of them.Zhao Jiayi and the other guys froze for a second; even Hao Ren was surprised as he didn\u2019t expect that Xie Yujia would be waiting for him here.The skirt Xie Yujia wore couldn\u2019t be considered as a fancy party gown, but it was still beautiful. Her pretty face and the gorgeous figure had made her temperament above others, and it looked like she was dressed up for a date.Hao Ren and the other three guys stood at the door blankly. Other guys who had just walked out were also looking back at this pretty girl and lingering on without any thought of leaving.\u201cHao Ren, let\u2019s go,\u201d Xie Yujia smiled at Hao Ren.\u201cOk, ok.\u201d Hao Ren nodded. He then turned around and said to Zhao Jiayi, \u201cI\u2019m going to a lecture with the Class President.\u201dZhao Jiayi and the other two guys stared at him in shock.\u201cHurry up, or we will be late,\u201d Xie Yujia pulled on Hao Ren\u2019s sleeve and rushed him.Hence, Hao Ren walked out of Academic Building D with Xie Yujia. He pushed Xie Yujia\u2019s bike away from the parking spot and hopped on. Xie Yujia then jumped on the back seat deftly and held onto Hao Ren\u2019s waist.The bike bumpily rode across campus in the dim light of the night.Zhao Jiayi and the others continued to stare at the scene as if they got fossilized together.After a while, Zhou Liren stretched his stiff neck and asked, \u201cIs Ren\u2026 really dating the Class President?\u201dMeanwhile, on the road, Hao Ren asked while riding the bike, \u201cClass President, did you come to get me because you were afraid that I would skip it?\u201d\u201cYeah, who knows if you would go for midnight snacks with Zhao Jiayi and other guys and stand me up?\u201d Xie Yujia said brightly as she sat in the back and grabbed onto Hao Ren\u2019s waist tightly.Hao Ren laughed and paddled even faster; he felt like he was getting closer with the Class President even though he barely had any chance to get to know her before.For Xie Yujia, she started noticing Hao Ren since the time he got picked up by the Mercedes. At first, she was concerned that there was something wrong with this guy in the class. Slowly, she found out that although Hao Ren wasn\u2019t special, he was different from the other unambitious guys. When he trained at night for the Athletic Games, it made him unique in Xie Yujia\u2019s eyes.They went to Academic Building E but found that the parking lot outside the building was already full of bikes, e-bikes, and many flashy cars.Xie Yujia parked her bike further away and then entered the glass hall with Hao Ren. Xie Yujia was worried that others might take her seats, so she started walking at a faster pace and pulled on Hao Ren\u2019s arm to ensure that he kept up.The architectural design of the hall was based on the Roman Colosseum. It had a round structure, and the interior decorations were high-end and bright.Outside the marble hall, reporters from various media channels surrounded a couple of people with microphones and cameras held high in their hands. Xie Yujia was quite curious, so she slowed down and pulled Hao Ren to have a look together.\u201cHuh, huh. Mayor Sun, I know you are very busy, but you are still coming for my lecture,\u201d a crisp and bright male voice said.\u201cAcademician Hao, I\u2019m your loyal fan! I have to come to your lecture no matter how busy I am!\u201d a man dressed in a plain shirt said.Hao Ren recognized him; he was the Mayor of East Ocean City who was on the news all the time.The Deputy Mayor, who was in charge of the economic development and was also Huang Xujie\u2019s father, was standing beside the Mayor. He had a smile on his face and didn\u2019t say anything out of the norm as he was in the company of his higher-up.\u201cAcademician Yue is getting younger and younger,\u201d after chatting with the tall and mighty Academician Hao, the Mayor turned around to respectfully talk to the lady who was dressed in a plain suit and stood beside Academician Hao.\u201cYou are flattering me, Mayor,\u201d the lady with impressive appearance lowered her head and smiled.\u201cAcademician Yue acquired another high-valued scientific award from Europe. You are indeed an honor of the East Ocean City as well as the Chinese scientific community!\u201d the Mayor laughed and continued talking.Accompanying the Academicians and the Mayor were a lot of university officials, college officials, and senior professors who were rarely seen. They were just smiling and staying quiet in front of the media.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThose two are Academician Hao and Academician Yue. Did you see that? That is the temperament of world-class scientists!\u201d Xie Yujia pointed secretly at the academician couples and moved closer to Hao Ren as she whispered with great respect.\u201cIt is about time. Don\u2019t let the students wait too long. Let\u2019s go inside,\u201d Academician Hao, who could be described as handsome and highly esteemed, looked at his watch and suggested.\u201cAlright, alright, alright\u2026\u201d numerous university officials agreed repeatedly. The mayor and Deputy Mayor started walking respectfully with Academician Hao and Academician Yue to the lecture hall.However, Academician Hao, who seemed conspicuous in the crowd because of his tall figure, took a look around and paused for a second when he saw Hao Ren and Xie Yujia before he walked into the lecture hall.\u201cLet\u2019s hurry up as well!\u201d Xie Yujia pulled on Hao Ren\u2019s arm in a hurry and almost dragged Hao Ren into the lecture hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69: The Super Fan Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedThe lecture hall was packed with a large crowd of people. Although there were hundreds of seats in the biggest room in Academic Building E, they didn\u2019t seem to be enough.Worrying about losing their seats, Xie Yujia held onto Hao Ren and rushed to the seats she reserved.Finally, she found the seats according to the numbers on her tickets. She walked in while grabbing onto Hao Ren\u2019s hand and then sat down as she uttered a sigh of relief.When she sat down, she realized she had been holding onto Hao Ren\u2019s hand the entire time. Her face turned red instantly, and she let his hand go hastily. Her palm was a little slippery and a little wet; she was so nervous.Hao Ren took his hand back awkwardly and wiped his slightly wet hand on his clothes. He felt embarrassed to ask the Class President to release his hand while she was grabbing onto it, so he had to let her do it.With the appearance of Hao Zhonghua on the podium, the noisy and excited lecture hall went silent immediately.\u201cAh, I forgot to get some water,\u201d Xie Yujia said suddenly.\u201cI\u2019ll go get it,\u201d Hao Ren stood up and replied.\u201cForget it!\u201d Xie Yujia grabbed his arm and stopped him hastily, \u201cThe lecture is going to start soon.\u201dHao Ren looked back at her, and Xie Yujia blushed and took her hand back immediately.\u201cI must be too excited today, otherwise why do I keep touching him so much\u2026\u201d Xie Yujia thought to herself secretly while her face was still red.\u201cOk\u2026\u201d Hao Ren sat back down without noticing the look on Xie Yujia\u2019s face.The lecture hall was divided into three areas specifically for today\u2019s lectures.The two front rows were for the officials of the city and university, the senior professors, and the most authoritative scientists in the East Ocean area.Many master and doctoral students in related majors from various famous universities in East Ocean City were attracted to the lecture by the fame of the couple, and many of them were also the favorite students of the professors who sat in the front. The university had arranged six to seven rows in the middle based on the number of these students.The area furthest back was left for the undergraduates of East Ocean University. However, as Xie Yujia said, there was only a limited amount of tickets available. She tried hard and only got two tickets through the Student Council. Other students who didn\u2019t get seats had to stand throughout the whole lecture.The seats Xie Yujia reserved were in a pretty good spot. They were in the front row of the third area, which enabled them to see Hao Zhonghua and his wife on the podium clearly.The entire lecture hall was fully packed. Even the hallways were full of students. Many of them were standing on tiptoes worrying they wouldn\u2019t be able to see the appearance of the two famous scientists.This lecture was a unique and grand occasion in the university.\u201cOn such a lively day like today, it is our great honor to have a world-famous couple in the science community, Academician Hao Zhonghua, and Academician Yue Yang, give us a lecture on their scientific research. Academician Hao Zhonghua and Academician Yue Yang are from Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering respectively. They have come here to give this lecture as soon as they landed in China from their trip to Europe; it is indeed an honor for our university! Academician Hao Zhonghua had just won the most prestigious award in the biomedical scientific community abroad, Gairdner Award! And Academician Yue Yang, her recent climate research had won the Graff Award, which is also known as the \u201cNobel Prize in Ecology\u201d in the science community.\u201dThe Principal of the university was prologuing with the most genuine expressions and enthusiasm. Xie Yujia, who sat beside Hao Ren, was holding her head up and in a passionate mood as if it was her, instead of Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang, who had won the awards.The look on her face switched from excitement to discontent when she turned around and saw how calm Hao Ren was. She knocked Hao Ren with her arm and whispered, \u201cDid you hear that! How incredible are they! They just won two international prizes!\u201d\u201cJust some prizes, what\u2019s so special about them,\u201d Hao Ren said calmly.\u201cYou!\u201d Xie Yujia pouted. She stopped bothering him and continued looking forward with her neck stretched.She had done lots of research on scientific news and found out that the Gairdner Award was also known as \u201cthe mini Nobel Prize\u201d as a quarter of the Gairdner Award recipients had won the Nobel Prize later. Therefore, this award was also called \u201cthe Pre-Nobel Prize\u201d.As soon as the Principal finished his speech, roaring applauses resonated in the hall.The applauses were very enthusiastic and prolonged. It wasn\u2019t because the Principal\u2019s speech was excellent; instead, the arrival of the two world-famous scientists after winning the awards indeed drove up the students\u2019 excitement.After the Principal walked down from the podium, Hao Zhonghua, who was a stalwart figure and had an imposing appearance walked up to the podium.Xie Yujia\u2019s eyes radiated instantly; she was a crazy fan of Hao Zhonghua.Hao Zhonghua held the microphone, cleared his throat, and smiled. \u201cThe Principal overpraised me. As a matter of fact, we still have a long way ahead of us on the road of science. The development of science in China relied on contributions from generations, which can\u2019t be simply measured by trophies and awards. The main purpose of me and my wife\u2019s trip to Europe wasn\u2019t accepting the awards; instead, it was connecting with professionals and scientists from abroad. East Ocean University is the first place we have come to give this lecture. We have some spare time as we had just come back, and I graduated from East Ocean University, so I have deep feelings for it\u2026\u201d his voice was plump and charming.Xie Yujia was listening carefully with her neck turned to the side. The passion she had wasn\u2019t inferior to those fans of celebrities from middle school.\u201cHao Zhonghua is so attractive; he is so clever and charming\u2026 if my future husband could ever be like that\u2026\u201dBehind Hao Ren, there were a few girls making comments in a slightly trembling voice.\u201cEm, is he that good-looking\u2026\u201d Hao Ren was speechless.He turned around to look at Xie Yujia. Her eyes were shining, her hands were laying under her jaw, her mouth was slightly open, and her expression showed how engaged she was.On the podium, as soon as he finished his polite greeting, Hao Zhonghua started talking about his most recent scientific research, which was what he won the award for.The professors and master and doctoral students in the front were listening carefully as if it was a traditional lecture, and they took notes diligently. Some were so immersed in the lecture that they nodded along and then lowered their heads to take notes as if they figured something out.East Ocean University\u2019s undergraduates in the third area were listening carefully and quietly without making any noise, even though they couldn\u2019t completely comprehend what Hao Zhonghua was talking about.However, Hao Zhonghua\u2019s lecture didn\u2019t dive in deep. Even undergraduates who weren\u2019t majoring in biology could still get some of the points; it was just the details that puzzled them.The primary purpose of holding a scientific lecture at East Ocean University was to form a gathering effect. On the one hand, it was to introduce the undergraduates to an intense scientific research environment and to allow them to experience a higher level of academic knowledge. On the other hand, it was to draw the attention of the media and scientific community and to promote the school\u2019s image.Hao Zhonghua spoke eloquently during the lecture. Once a while, he would use gestures to enhance the effects. Many scientists with grey hair had shown their admiration because of his clear statements and logical thinking.One hour passed by like a flowing river. When Hao Zhonghua finished his lecture, all the people in the hall were still enjoying the charm of science and longing for more, didn\u2019t matter if they were the officials of the city or the university, professors or students.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSwoosh, swoosh, swoosh\u2026 warm applauses resounded through the lecture hall like tides as soon as the crowd realized the lecture was over.The applauses lasted at least five minutes.Hao Ren also joined the crowd and applauded. Xie Yujia probably thought Hao Ren was finally influenced as she touched Hao Ren with her arm proudly and said, \u201cSee, that\u2019s the power of science!\u201dAfterward, she mused, \u201cHe is indeed a great scientist. He can explain the most advanced concepts in such an understandable way, and his communication skills are also incredible!\u201dHao Ren looked at her helplessly. He figured that Xie Yujia had idolized Hao Zhonghua to some degree as she was so close to having stars spinning in a circle in her eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her sharp eyes and clear tone reminded people of the portrait of Madam Curie in the hallway.Her lecture was about her research on one of the most impoverished areas in Africa, Lesotho Kingdom; this country had the highest altitude in the world. This three-year research made her the recipient of one of the most valued awards in the scientific community, the Graff Award. Moreover, in this research, she brought up an effective cultivation project for cereal crop based on the local ecological environment and state of the nation and its civilians in the hope of solving the most severe famine problems. As a result, it had drawn in enormous attention from all over the world.Similarly, nobody made a sound during the entire lecture. The professors were listening carefully with knitted eyebrows while the students were also paying full attention.Yue Yang\u2019s lecture started from the local environment to the local politic climate, then from the living space of the residents to the influence of ecology on the industry. Next, she mentioned how the unproductive land could be altered through science\u2026She gave a lively description of the three-year and five-year plans for the country as well as for its poverty and future developments. She also expressed how convinced she was that this troubled land would be revived.\u201cThat is so great\u2026\u201d sitting beside Hao Ren, Xie Yujia mused.Hao Ren was no longer spacing out like earlier as he was listening earnestly.The one-hour lecture soon finished, and the stormy applauses also lasted over five minutes. Yue Yang slightly bowed to the audience in the hall then walked down from the podium.The Principal showed up on the podium again, making his conclusion.At this moment, Xie Yujia took two books out of her purse. She said to Hao Ren in a worried voice, \u201cRush to the front with me later. I want to get their autographs!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Hao Ren looked at her, dazed.\u201cDon\u2019s worry about anything, just rush to the front with me in a bit!\u201d Xie Yujia put a book in Hao Ren\u2019s hand and said.At the same time, the Principal standing on the podium said, \u201cIn order to allow everyone to meet with Academician Hao and Academician Yue, both academicians have agreed that students with their books can ask them for autographs after the lecture. However, in consideration of the big crowd here today, each student can only have one book signed. Meanwhile, I hope all the students can keep order and maintain an excellent image of the university.\u201dHao Zhonghua and Yue Yang left the lecture hall under the security of a group of guards. The Mayor and Deputy Mayor tightly followed them, chatting and smiling.Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh\u2026 although the Principal had asked the students to keep order, nothing could slow down the passion of the fans. All of them flooded out of the door like a free-flowing water.Xie Yujia also dragged Hao Ren and ran out wildly. No one could tell how a skinny girl like her could have so much power.Although Xie Yujia and Hao Ren were sitting at the front of the third area, about a hundred people were lining up ahead of them when they rushed outside.The master and doctoral students at the front were all well-prepared as everyone had a science book written by the academicians. Their seats closer to the front also allowed them to leave the hall earlier than others.Xie Yujia waited at the back of the line, and her pretty face had turned red. She was still dragging Hao Ren\u2019s arm, and it even had five fingermarks on it. Standing beside Xie Yujia, Hao Ren felt quite helpless.\u201cThe Class President who is usually serious and poker-faced\u2026 I didn\u2019t know there are times that she would be this cute\u2026\u201d staring at her pink cheeks and shining eyes that radiated, Hao Ren thought.Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang sat behind a long desk, smiling at every student that came up and asked for autographs.The officials of the city didn\u2019t leave probably out of respect. Instead, they stood beside the desk and looked at the couple signing autographs with smiles on their faces.The scene of Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang sitting down signing autographs while the officials of the city stood beside them modestly was great for the news and their images.Instantly, all the camera flashes got turned on, and various cameras were aimed at the officials and the academicians. They didn\u2019t only record the enthusiasm of the students but also the great respect the government officials had for the scientists.It was an honor for the officials to come to the lecture given by both academicians in person. However, their cheerful and supportive presence during the autograph signing portion had definitely promoted Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang\u2019s status as well.Those two scientists were well-known worldwide, and even the officials of the city treated them with great respect. If anyone ever offended the two respectable scientists, that person would probably be in trouble.With the world-famous scientists\u2019 contribution to East Ocean City, the development of technology as well as the high-tech and environmental protection industries in East Ocean City had soared incredibly. The fast-paced growth also dramatically improved the image of the city, which was something that could never be bought with tens of billions or even hundreds of billions of yuan!The lineup for autographs was moving slowly. Xie Yujia stood on her tiptoes as if it drove her crazy that she wasn\u2019t able to talk to her idols while they were so close to her.Finally, after waiting in line for half an hour, they were getting closer to the long desk. It was eventually Hao Ren and Xie Yujia\u2019s turn to get their books signed when a few doctoral students ahead finished talking to the academicians unwillingly.Xie Yujia rushed forward with a book in her arms, but she got irritated when she saw Hao Ren moving slowly behind. She called to him, \u201cHao Ren! Hurry up!\u201dHer tone wasn\u2019t too kind since she was undoubtedly impatient because she waited for so long. Also, Hao Ren was indeed moving too slow when it was their turn to get her idols\u2019 autographs.Hao Ren paced himself, held out the book, and went up to Xie Yujia awkwardly. With the long desk in between, Xie Yujia was facing Hao Zhonghua while Hao Ren was facing Yue Yang.\u201cAcademician Hao, I am your loyal reader! I bought all the books you published! It is such a pity that only one book can be signed!\u201d it wasn\u2019t easy for Xie Yujia to have the chance to be so close to her idol, and she couldn\u2019t help but speak quickly.\u201cHuh, huh, alright,\u201d Hao Zhonghua took over the book from Xie Yujia, opened it to the title page, picked up his pen, and signed his name smoothly.Meanwhile, Yue Yang looked up at Hao Ren who was silently standing on the other side of the desk. She also opened the book to the title page and signed her name.\u201cAcademician Yue, I am also your fan! I have read all of your books as well!\u201d Xie Yujia said to Yue Yang contentedly after getting the autograph from Hao Zhonghua.\u201cHuh, really?\u201d Yue Yang observed Xie Yujia from top to bottom as she gave an elegant smile to Xie Yujia.Xie Yujia was staring at them in excitement but had no idea what to say. As she was wondering if it was time to leave, Hao Zhonghua asked unexpectedly, \u201cIs this your boyfriend?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Xie Yujia paused for a second. Afterward, maybe due to being too nervous, she blurted out, \u201cNot yet!\u201dHearing the answer from Xie Yujia, Hao Ren was slightly surprised, and his body shivered a little.\u201cHuh, huh,\u201d Hao Zhonghua laughed as he looked at Xie Yujia\u2019s pretty and passionate face without saying anything.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cExcuse me, please walk forward if you have gotten the autographs,\u201d the student who was in charge of maintaining order said to Xie Yujia and Hao Ren.Xie Yujia then realized that she couldn\u2019t continue to stay there. She smiled at Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang brightly and dragged Hao Ren, who was still blanking out, out of the autograph-signing area.\u201cGive it to me!\u201d seeing Hao Ren holding Yue Yang\u2019s book, Xie Yujia pulled the book with Yue Yang\u2019s autograph on it into her arms, worrying that Hao Ren might accidentally damage it. Then, she put it cautiously into her purse together with the book signed by Hao Zhonghua.\u201cYou are so silly. It is such a rare chance to see great scientists like them, and yet you didn\u2019t even say a word,\u201d Xie Yujia complained to Hao Ren. Then, she looked down at her purse and smiled contentedly.She was cheered up, and she said to Hao Ren, \u201cAlright, but you did do a good job today for getting me a book with their autograph. I\u2019ll treat you to midnight snacks!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedHer excitement proved that she was actually in a good mood.However, what Hao Ren was concerned about at the moment was that somebody might call him. He wasn\u2019t too interested in midnight snacks, so he refused politely, \u201cToday\u2019s lectures are fantastic. Class President, I appreciate the ticket you gave me. Regarding midnight snacks\u2026 that\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cGood, now you admit that the lectures were excellent! How about you treat me to midnight snacks then!\u201dHer face was still pink; she was still immersed in the excitement.\u201cEm\u2026\u201d Hao Ren hesitated.\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t want to? I showed you the wonder of science, but you don\u2019t even want to thank me?\u2019 Xie Yujia squinted her eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I am just worried that if we don\u2019t go back now, the dorm gates will be locked,\u201d Hao Ren explained.\u201cThe university knows many students are going to the lectures so that the dorm gates will close at eleven o\u2019clock tonight instead,\u201d Xie Yujia said.Seeing Xie Yujia in the mood, Hao Ren had to agree, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll get you midnight snacks. Let\u2019s go to Hongji Square.\u201dAfter all, Xie Yujia had treated him twice already. Hao Ren decided to treat her tonight so that he could return the favor.\u201cOk!\u201d Xie Yujia got her bike, and Hao Ren rode the bike and took her to Hongji Square outside the west gate of the university.In the balmy night, Hao Ren was riding smoothly on the quiet road on campus with Xie Yujia on the back seat. The night breeze softly blew through the leaves, and everything was so quiet and peaceful.It reminded Hao Ren of the last time when he walked side by side with Xie Yujia for midnight snacks outside the university.\u201cUniversity life would be such a failure if you don\u2019t date during the four years\u2026\u201d having Xie Yujia in the backseat, the quote that had been mused by numerous senior students suddenly came across Hao Ren\u2019s mind.He looked back at the round hall in Academic Building E, which was still dazzlingly bright. It was also at this moment when he noticed Xie Yujia, who was sitting in the back while staring quietly at the artificial lake in front of them with a content smile on her face.Long eyelashes, star-shining eyes, pretty features, flowy hair, and smooth figure\u2026\u201cThe Class President is a beautiful girl,\u201d the thought crossed his mind.He pretended to look at Academic Building E unintentionally, so he looked back and kept riding.Hongji Square was as busy as usual when they arrived. The dorm would only be locked at eleven o\u2019clock; therefore, the energetic students weren\u2019t willing to go back that early.\u201cAre you hungry, Class President? I\u2019ll buy you some Sanhuang Chicken,\u201d while parking the bike, Hao Ren said to Xie Yujia.Although Hao Ren didn\u2019t invite girls out for food often, he still knew that he couldn\u2019t send her off by just buying her a bowl of cheap hot spicy dip.\u201cSure, Dexin Restaurant,\u201d Xie Yujia rubbed her tummy and replied; she indicated that she was indeed hungry.Hao Ren smiled and walked across the square to Dexin Restaurant with Xie Yujia.\u201cRen!\u201d all of a sudden, a familiar voice sounded from the rear corner behind him.Hao Ren turned around and saw Zhou Liren sitting at an outdoor barbecue booth, and Zhao Jiayi\u2019s palm had already covered his mouth.\u201cYou guys are eating here too?\u201d seeing the three other guys from Hao Ren\u2019s dorm, Xie Yujia was quite surprised.Since they met, Hao Ren had no choice but to walk over there with Xie Yujia.\u201cWhy are you guys here?\u201d Hao Ren asked them.\u201cWe got bored at the dorm, so we came out for some food,\u201d Zhao Jiayi answered while scratching his head. Zhou Liren kept his eyes averted; he was probably wondering why Zhao Jiayi didn\u2019t allow him to yell just now.\u201cOk, then we\u2019ll eat together,\u201d Xie Yujia said frankly. She turned to Hao Ren and suggested, \u201cThen let\u2019s not go to Dexin Restaurant. We can have some barbecue instead.\u201dHao Ren didn\u2019t know how to answer, but Zhao Jiayi suddenly stood up, leaving a dozen skewers of barbequed meat on his plate. \u201cNo! No! You guys go ahead! We are done now, and we are ready to go back!\u201d\u201cAh, really?\u201d staring at the leftover skewers on the plate, Xie Yujia said doubtingly.\u201cFor real! For real! We are planning to bring the rest to the dorm!\u201d grabbing the skewers on the plate quickly with one hand, Zhao Jiayi twisted Zhou Liren\u2019s ear with the other and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go now!\u201d\u201cAyyyy!\u201d Zhou Liren yelled and made several glances at Hao Ren. It took him too long to realize why he shouldn\u2019t have called Hao Ren\u2019s name.Cao Ronghua followed, picking up the unfinished half bottle of beer.\u201cYou can\u2019t drink beer in the dorm!\u201d Xie Yujia reminded him.Cao Ronghua put down the beer unwillingly, wiped his hand, and got the bill from the owner. Afterward, the three of them left like thieves.\u201cAy\u2026\u201d looking at their backs, Xie Yujia sighed helplessly.\u201cThen\u2026.. Let\u2019s go to Dexin Restaurant?\u201d staring at Xie Yujia, Hao Ren asked in a quizzical tone.He was found with Xie Yujia by Zhao Jiayi and the other guys; he didn\u2019t know what they would think about it and how Zhou Liren, the big mouth, would spread it when he went back.\u201cFine, let\u2019s go!\u201d Xie Yujia nodded without avoiding anything.Dexin Restaurant was quite busy when they walked in. They sat down at a table by the wall, and Hao Ren ordered a half plate of Sanhuang Chicken, two bowls of chicken and duck blood soup, two bowls of chicken congee, and a small plate of duck gizzard. Those were regular midnight snacks.\u201cHas Zhao Jiayi recovered from the injury?\u201d Xie Yujia asked after sitting down.\u201cYes, he is fine now. He has tough skin, so he recovered fast. He was acting lively just now,\u201d Hao Ren said with a smile.\u201cThe punishment from the university was bizarre. I thought he would at least get a verbal warning,\u201d Xie Yujia said.\u201cZhao Jiayi had the same thought. Therefore, he felt so refreshed when he learned about the results. He is now in a better condition than he was before the fight,\u201d Hao Ren said in his mind.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you weren\u2019t involved this time,\u201d Xie Yujia continued.Hao Ren smirked. What Xie Yujia didn\u2019t expect was that Hao Ren had put lots of effort into getting that result. Otherwise, just like she said, no matter how much partiality the university showed, as the party that started the fight, Zhao Jiayi would get a verbal warning at least.\u201cSpeaking of which, you are great at fighting,\u201d after thinking for a while, Xie Yujia said.Seeing Hao Ren keeping smirking, she continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could be that tough\u2026and mighty.\u201dHao Ren guessed that she was about to use the word \u201cviolent\u201d, but she switched to the positive word \u201cmighty\u201d instead.\u201cYou are the same, Class President. You used to be so gentle and serious about everything, but during lectures, you were so excited as if you were a teenager girl,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cHuh, was I?\u201d sitting straight, Xie Yujia looked at Hao Ren with her shining eyes.\u201cYour face is still pink,\u201d Hao Ren smiled and said.Xie Yujia didn\u2019t believe his words, so she put her hands on her cheeks to check. After that, her face blushed for real. She thought for a bit and tried to explain, but it only made it worse. \u201cFine, I made a scene today! But Academician Hao and Academician Yue are my most admired scientists; it makes sense that I got too excited when I met them in person,\u201d she concluded.\u201cYeah, it makes sense,\u201d Hao Ren nodded helplessly.Xie Yujia was slightly unhappy about Hao Ren\u2019s insincerity, but she didn\u2019t want to haggle over it. She continued asking her questions, \u201cDo you have any problems with Huang Xujie?\u201d\u201cWhy did you ask that all of a sudden?\u201d Hao Ren raised his head.\u201cEm, I heard that the fight occurred this time because you and Huang Xujie didn\u2019t get along well,\u201d Xie Yujia said seriously.\u201cI don\u2019t like him, and he doesn\u2019t like me, that\u2019s it,\u201d picking up a piece of Sanhuang Chicken with his chopsticks, Hao Ren said casually.\u201cEm\u2026 how about I be the arbitrator, and you guys can resolve this matter?\u201d Xie Yujia said after thinking for a few seconds.\u201cDon\u2019t bother, Class President; you don\u2019t have to get involved in this. Have some chicken,\u201d Hao Ren pushed the plate of Sanhuang Chicken towards Xie Yujia.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXie Yujia nodded, but she was still worried about Hao Ren. However, it seemed like Hao Ren didn\u2019t care about it, so Xie Yujia thought he probably had some people to rely on.What happened to Huang Xujie didn\u2019t really concern her. It was her brother, the Captain of the basketball team, that made her worry. She wasn\u2019t sure if her brother would let go of Hao Ren because of the enormous loss the basketball team suffered.The way the university dealt with the incident was strangely harsh on the basketball team, and nothing happened to Hao Ren and Zhao Jiayi, which seemed unfair to the basketball team. She believed her brother would be resentful about it.As they continued to eat, they talked about all kinds of things that were happening in class. The topic went back to the lectures today as time went by. Hao Ren felt the enormous admiration Xie Yujia had for Hao Zhonghua while he thought about the hidden secrets deep in his heart. Both of them didn\u2019t even notice that there were fewer and fewer customers in the restaurant.\u201cAh, it\u2019s already eleven thirty!\u201d looking up at the clock on the restaurant\u2019s wall, Xie Yujia screamed unexpectedly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then, he realized there were only a few people left in the restaurant.\u201cSir, bill please!\u201d he took out his wallet and said in a hurry.The waiter collected the money, and Hao Ren and Xie Yujia hastily walked out of Dexin Restaurant and realized that the outdoor area of the square was already empty.\u201cWhat now\u2026\u201d Xie Yujia looked a little worried as she held the purse in her hand.She had never spent a night outside of her home or dorm! It was the first time for her to have missed the curfew time of the dorm.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Maybe the dorm manager is not asleep yet,\u201d Hao Ren carried her on the back seat and biked into the dormitory area as he comforted her.They went to the entrance of the female Dorm Building No.3 in the south region and found the light in the administrative office by the dorm gate was off. That meant the manager had already gone to sleep.On top of that, all the lights in the dorm building were off as well, which showed that the curfew had begun.Xie Yujia jumped off the bike in a hurry and called towards the window of the administrative office, \u201cMa\u2019am! Ma\u2019am!\u201dNothing happened. It seemed like the manager had fallen soundly asleep.Hao Ren knew that the manager of their male Dorm Building No.7 always slept late, and he should be able to wake her up even if she went to bed. That meant he could still go back to his dorm building.However, since Xie Yujia couldn\u2019t get in now, how could he leave her outside all by herself?Xie Yujia couldn\u2019t wake the manager up after several shouts. Then, she turned back to Hao Ren and said in worry, \u201cWhat now?\u201dThe confident Class President looked helpless at that moment. Hao Ren, who had spent nights outside with Zhao Jiayi quite often finally found an opportunity to apply his experience. \u201cWe can\u2026spend a night at the Internet Cafe?\u201d\u201cIs it\u2026safe there?\u201d Xie Yujia hesitated while frowning.The environment and air quality were terrible in the Internet Cafe, and she didn\u2019t play many games. It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to take her to that kind of place.Hao Ren thought about it and probed, \u201cOr\u2026the hotels 1 outside of the school?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Xie Yujia looked at him, startled. She hesitated and asked, \u201cHave you stayed there before?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026not really. But I heard it doesn\u2019t cost much. About 120 yuan per night. As long as we have our IDs\u2026maybe student cards work too\u2026\u201dHe lowered his voice since he didn\u2019t want Xie Yujia to think that he was \u201cexperienced\u201d.\u201cIs that kind of place safe?\u201d Xie Yujia asked the same question after thinking about it for a bit.\u201cYes. It should be safe,\u201d Hao Ren didn\u2019t sound so sure about his answer.All kinds of people stayed in the hotels close to the school, and he had heard of incidents happening there. It wouldn\u2019t put him at ease to go back to his dorm and leave Xie Yujia at the hotel by herself.\u201cThen\u2026I can stay with you\u2026if you are worried?\u201d Hao Ren coughed twice pretentiously and asked quietly.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not appropriate,\u201d she hesitated for a bit before rejecting it.Since his ideas didn\u2019t work out, Hao Ren suggested, \u201cOr we can call up Ma Lina and ask her to knock on the manager\u2019s door so that she can open the gate for you?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t bring my cell phone. That is the problem,\u201d Xie Yujia said helplessly. She came out just for the guest lecturers, so she didn\u2019t bother to bring her cell phone. Who would have known that this could happen?\u201cI don\u2019t have their numbers. And neither would Zhao Jiayi and the guys,\u201d Hao Ren said. Since students could arrange their schedules and courses, the class was pretty loose. The girls would always stick together, so that meant there wasn\u2019t a lot of communication between the girls and the guys.\u201cThere are still a couple of hours left before dawn, and we need to find somewhere to stay,\u201d Xie Yujia gave up after having knocked on the window of the administrative office for a while.Fortunately, Hao Ren was here with her, so she wasn\u2019t too desperate.At this time, Hao Ren suddenly thought of something and said, \u201cWe can go to a KTV and spend the night there. A room from midnight to 6:00 AM will only cost 80 yuan!\u201d\u201cYes! That\u2019s good!\u201d Xie Yujia finally agreed to his suggestion.It was cold at night, and they couldn\u2019t get into the dorms. After the decision was made, Hao Ren took her back to Hongji Square on her bike.He thought about the suggestions he just mentioned to her while biking and realized that the one he looked forward to was to spend the night at a hotel room with her.\u201cDamn it, damn it! What was I thinking?\u201dHao Ren blamed himself for having that thought.On the other hand, Xie Yujia behind him didn\u2019t think that much. She was only touched by Hao Ren\u2019s good intention in keeping her company so late at night.She knew that the guys usually returned to their dorms late and the manager there was used to them coming back after closing time. Therefore, she was clear that Hao Ren could still go back to his dorm if he wanted to\u2026\u201cIt is all my fault. If I hadn\u2019t gotten too into talking and didn\u2019t forget about the time, Hao Ren could still go back to his dorm instead of wandering around with me so late at night.\u201dXie Yujia self-criticized in the back seat as she bit her lip.They went to \u201cGolden Ages Karaoke\u201d which was located on the second floor of a building on Hongji Square. They asked for a small room for the night.Seeing only the two of them there at midnight, the male waiter who led them to the room kept staring at them with a suspicious look.\u201cThe room is only for singing, not for other things,\u201d he reminded them after they had arrived in the room.\u201cOther things\u2026\u201d Xie Yujia suddenly understood the implied meaning before she was about to ask. Her face blushed.\u201cI mean,\u201d the waiter added after seeing her flush, \u201cYou can sing in here, but you can not sleep. As the rules go, at least one of you needs to stay awake.\u201d\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Xie Yujia murmured. Her blush became more apparent when she noticed Hao Ren looking at her in a weird way. She hurried into the room and sat down in a corner.The waiter explained a few more things to Hao Ren, turned on the equipment, and left the room.Xie Yujia sat awkwardly on the couch as she looked around the room, still blushing.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. They have strict rules here,\u201d Hao Ren randomly grabbed a microphone and put it beside him, \u201cI came here with Zhao Jiayi and the guys before. But guys like us are at the Internet Cafe a lot more than here.\u201d\u201cI know. I came with Ma Lina and some other girls before as well. At least it is safer than both the Internet Cafe and the hotel,\u201d Xie Yujia nodded.Hao Ren knew that Xie Yujia was tired as he noticed the redness in her eyes. He said, \u201cYou can go to sleep, Class President. I\u2019ll stay up.\u201dXie Yujia pouted her little mouth, \u201cHow could I let you\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s ok! I always stay up with the guys, and I\u2019m used to it!\u201d Hao Ren pushed her down, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t fall asleep. It\u2019s not a problem for me to guard you!\u201dXie Yujia bit her thin lips and stared at him in embarrassment. She wanted to say something but didn\u2019t know where to start.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHao Ren took off his jacket and put it over her, \u201cYou might feel a bit chilly after you fall asleep. Anyways, get some sleep. I\u2019ll listen to some music and sing a few songs. It will keep me awake.\u201dHe stood up and clicked on some popular songs. Then, he sat back beside Xie Yujia.\u201cHao Ren is indeed a \u2018good person\u2019.\u201d Xie Yujia sighed as she looked at him with her eyes semi-closed, lying on the couch.Hao Ren picked up the microphone as he listened to the familiar music. He turned on the voiceover and randomly hummed along; he was a little embarrassed to sing in front of the Class President.Xie Yujia was secretly looking at him through her squinted eyes as she pretended to be asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She felt like Hao Ren\u2019s humming sounded like a lullaby and fell asleep unconsciously.When she opened her eyes again, she saw Hao Ren snoozing with both of his hands on the sofa.She sat up, and her shoes made a squeaking noise on the sofa. Hao Ren heard the sound and woke up immediately. The microphone in his hand fell to the floor.\u201cYou really didn\u2019t sleep last night?\u201d Xie Yujia rubbed her eyes, saw the black circles around Hao Ren\u2019s eyes, and asked guiltily.\u201cThat waiter was patrolling by the door all night. I couldn\u2019t sleep even if I wanted to,\u201d Hao Ren stretched his arm and laughed, \u201cHow was your sleep?\u201d\u201cIt was alright. I had a few dreams,\u201d Xie Yujia replied as she returned the jacket to Hao Ren and checked her own clothes.She wasn\u2019t concerned about Hao Ren doing anything while she was asleep as she trusted him. Instead, she was scared that her clothes might slide and reveal parts of her body that shouldn\u2019t be exposed.She calmed down when she saw that her clothes were tidy.\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d she asked.\u201cIt\u2019s almost six. The time for the room is almost up too,\u201d Hao Ren replied.\u201cUm,\u201d Xie Yujia nodded, \u201cThank you so much for yesterday.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. These types of things happen sometimes,\u201d Hao Ren stood up and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go find a place for food!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to sleep for a bit?\u201d Xie Yujia looked at him in confusion.Hao Ren shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not even six yet. You should sleep for a bit. There\u2019s no use going back to the dorm since it\u2019s not opened yet. I\u2019ll be on the watch for you this time!\u201d Xie Yujia said.She saw Hao Ren\u2019s tired face and suddenly realized that this was the first time she stayed overnight alone with a guy.\u201cNo need, it\u2019ll be six in half an hour,\u201d Hao Ren still shook his head. He couldn\u2019t sleep alone and have a girl keep vigil for him.\u201cLet\u2019s sing then!\u201d Xie Yujia changed her expression and said.\u201cHuh?\u201d Hao Ren was a bit surprised.\u201cThere\u2019s still half an hour. We\u2019ll be wasting it anyways and might as well use this time to sing,\u201d Xie Yujia walked up to the karaoke machine and chose a few songs.The first song \u201cBlessings on the Street Corner\u201d came out on the screen. After half a night of sleep, Xie Yujia was already energetic. She picked up the microphone without being shy, found the key of the melody, and started singing.\u201cIn many autumns and winters, I was almost about to be cured\u2026\u201dHao Ren listened to Xie Yujia\u2019s voice and didn\u2019t know that the Class President sang so well.\u201cI could only pretend that I couldn\u2019t hear from other people about how he was doing\u2026\u201dAfter the first song, Xie Yujia continued to sing the second song.Her voice was melodious and pleasant, and the smile on her face seemed to create a sense of happiness.Hao Ren sat on the sofa and looked at Xie Yujia quietly. Unexpectedly, the studious Class President was also a pro at karaoke.\u201cAfterward, I finally learned how to love. It was a pity that you\u2019d left long ago, disappearing into the crowd\u2026 Afterward\u2026\u201d\u201cIs she singing these songs for me?\u201d Hao Ren suddenly thought.After singing six songs continuously, Xie Yujia abruptly took out another microphone and handed it to Hao Ren. \u201cCome and join me!\u201d she said.\u201cAh? No, I can\u2019t!\u201d Hao Ren waved his hands quickly.\u201cLet\u2019s sing together. There is only the two of us, what are you afraid of?\u201d Xie Yujia put the microphone in Hao Ren\u2019s hands enthusiastically.The old song \u201cHiroshima Mon Amour\u201d sounded. Hao Ren had to hold the microphone and sing awkwardly. Not sure if his potential had reached new heights or what had happened, but Hao Ren, who didn\u2019t sleep for the whole night, sang the song perfectly with a husky voice.\u201cNot bad! Let\u2019s do another newer song. \u2018Rooftop\u2019!\u201d Xie Yujia swayed her hands and said happily.Hao Ren tried to refuse but sang the song perfectly and expressed the gloominess in the song well.\u201cGeez! You are so good at singing! Stop pretending you are bad already!\u201d Xie Yujia winked at Hao Ren.Hao Ren found it weird as well. How did he voice become so full and broad? Was it because he cultivated the Spirit Concentration Scroll?After they finished singing another duet of \u201cYou Are a Song in My Heart\u201d and were about to pick another song, the waiter pushed open the door and came in suddenly.\u201cExcuse me, sir. The time of your room is up!\u201d he said.Hao Ren and Xie Yujia felt like they didn\u2019t sing enough, but they still had classes that day, so it was impossible to continue singing. They looked at each other, smiled, and put down the microphones. Then, they grabbed their stuff and checked out at the front desk.Xie Yujia wanted to pay when they were checking out, but Hao Ren stopped her. Even though he was accompanying Xie Yujia, how could he make a girl pay for him?After they walked out of the KTV, Xie Yujia insisted on treating Hao Ren to breakfast, and Hao Ren could only accept. They headed to Dexin Restaurant and ate two nutritious breakfast meals. Then, Hao Ren rode the bicycle and took Xie Yujia back to school through the west entrance; they were headed to the dorm area in the south.The morning at school was as silent as a park. The air was refreshing, and the environment was beautiful.Xie Yujia sat in the back seat of the bicycle, and both of her hands held on to Hao Ren\u2019s shirt as her body swayed in the direction of the wind. She thought for a while and placed her head on Hao Ren\u2019s back.\u201cIt\u2019s cold in the morning. Do you want my jacket?\u201d Hao Ren asked as he rode the bicycle.\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Xie Yujia felt the warmth on Hao Ren\u2019s back through his shirt and whispered.\u201cI\u2019m quite happy today,\u201d she suddenly said after being silent for a while.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Hao Ren didn\u2019t hear her as he was concentrating on riding the bicycle.\u201cSinging was enjoyable today, and so was last night,\u201d Xie Yujia raised her voice and said. The chilly morning breeze blew into her hair and face and sent her words into space.\u201cOh\u2026 I am glad you enjoyed it!\u201d Hao Ren was busy riding the bicycle and answered casually.\u201cThis idiot\u2026\u201d Xie Yujia thought in her mind.\u201cOne, two! One, two!\u201dSuddenly, organized shouts came from somewhere nearby.\u201cHao Ren! Change route and go around!\u201d Xie Yujia, who was sitting in the back, suddenly tugged on Hao Ren\u2019s shirt and hurried him.\u201cHuh, what?\u201d facing the wind and riding the bicycle, Hao Ren once again didn\u2019t hear her well.At the same time, the Captain of the basketball team, Xie Wanjun, who was wearing a dry-fit sports t-shirt and leading the whole sweaty basketball team ran towards them.It was Hao Ren\u2019s first time seeing the face of the Captain of the basketball team, so he couldn\u2019t help but slow down. The two-meter-tall giant Captain was leading the jog at a moderate speed and turned his head at the same time to look at Hao Ren, who was riding the bike, and Xie Yujia, who sat in the back seat.Xie Yujia felt conflicted as she looked at her older brother.It was six o\u2019clock in the morning. Other than the basketball team, who were doing their morning run, not a lot of students would be awake at this time.Hao Ren and Xie Yujia came from the west entrance of the school. What did the west entrance mean? Restaurants and small hotels could be seen any around Hongji Square.Would it be going out to eat and just coming back at this time?Xie Yujia lowered her head and didn\u2019t know what to do. Her older brother, Xie Wanjun, merely led the six to seven basketball players, yelled, and ran passed their bicycle emotionlessly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXie Yujia knew her older brother well enough, and his poker face was often his scariest expression.While Xie Yujia was nervous about this, Hao Ren turned his head and looked at the basketball team that moved like a tall wall. He noticed that those six basketball players who got kicked out were not in the morning training.\u201cThis Captain of the basketball team, Xie Wanjun, lost six team members because of the school\u2019s punishment. He probably hates me\u2026 but it seems like he doesn\u2019t know me yet?\u201dHao Ren rode to the south entrance and thought.Xie Yujia, who was sitting in the back seat, could only think of one phrase in her mind, \u201cOh cr*p!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedHao Ren rode the bicycle and returned to the southern dorm. He dropped off Xie Yujia at the female Dorm Building No.3 and then walked back to male Dorm Building No.7.The dorm gate had just opened at this time, and Hao Ren sneaked into the dorm when the manager wasn\u2019t paying attention.He went up to the third floor, entered the dorm room, and saw Zhao Jiayi and the two other guys still sleeping. There were a bunch of tiny wooden sticks from the meat skewers and a few empty beer bottles on the floor.\u201cThese guys\u2026\u201d Hao Ren walked in quietly, grabbed his towel and toothbrush, and was about to wash up.However, his arm bumped into a cup and made some noises which woke up Zhao Jiayi, who was asleep in one of the lower berths.\u201cYou\u2019re back, Ren?\u201d Zhao Jiayi yelled.\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Hao Ren could only admit.Hearing their conversation, Zhou Liren and Cao Ronghua woke up as well. They looked at Hao Ren, who was holding the towel and toothbrush sneakily, and asked immediately, \u201cWhat did you do last night?\u201d\u201cI\u2026uh\u2026,\u201d Hao Ren held his toothbrush and gestured as he stuttered; he couldn\u2019t say anything.Zhou Liren, who was initially sleepy, suddenly got energetic. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you and the Class President\u2026 progressed so fast?\u201d he asked.\u201cCut the cr*p! The dorm gate was already locked when I came back yesterday, so I went to the Internet Cafe for the whole night,\u201d Hao Ren thought about it and said.\u201cXie Yujia went as well?\u201d Cao Ronghua asked.\u201cShe\u2026 I don\u2019t know. After we ate yesterday, she went back herself. I strolled around for a bit, and it was already too late to come back.\u201d\u201cHehe. don\u2019t hide it if there\u2019s progress\u2026,\u201d Zhou Liren sat up in the upper berth and made a funny face at Hao Ren.\u201cGet lost!\u201d Hao Ren waved at him and took his toiletries with him as he walked out of the bedroom.Cao Ronghua, who slept on the lower berth under Zhou Liren didn\u2019t believe Zhou Liren\u2019s speculations. \u201cThe great beauty, the Class President, hooked up with Hao Ren this fast?\u201d he thought.However, many things that happened recently made him believe that Hao Ren had many miraculous characteristics.\u201cHao Ren\u2019s peach blossom fortune is too good!\u201d Zhao Jiayi sighed and said emotionally as he saw Hao Ren rushing out.The three of them also got up, got prepared, and went to class with Hao Ren.When they walked by the cafeteria, they bumped into Xie Yujia, who rode past them on her bicycle.Xie Yujia would normally greet her classmates, but she rode her bicycle and passed them in a hurry.Zhou Liren hit Hao Ren deliberately as he looked at Xie Yujia\u2019s thin yet hourglass figure.\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense when we get to class,\u201d Hao Ren warned him.\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Zhou Liren smiled even more nastily.The four of them stepped into the classroom and found that many people were discussing the scientific lectures that took place yesterday. Hao Ren looked at Xie Yujia\u2019s direction and saw that she was talking to the girls in the class as if nothing had changed.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come back yesterday, Ren? I wanted to play cards with your dorm!\u201d Huang Jianfeng saw Hao Ren walking in and yelled loudly.Hearing the shouting, the girls sitting in the front turned their heads.\u201cHe went to listen to the lecture with the Class President yesterday. Why could he come back and play cards with you?\u201d a few guys who knew what had happened said.\u201cStop talking, stop talking\u2026,\u201d Hao Ren who was sitting in the back row tried to quiet them down.The class soon began. Hao Ren, who thought everything would be over by now, discovered that the whispers started to spread around the classroom.In a moment, Zhou Liren received a message, turned around to bump Hao Ren\u2019s arm, and asked in surprise, \u201cHey! You actually spent the night with the Class President? I was only joking with you!\u201d\u201cWhere did this information come from?\u201d Hao Ren asked him.\u201cThe girls in the front row. They said that Xie Yujia didn\u2019t return to the dorm last night. Besides, she wasn\u2019t there when the dorm manager came for room inspection, and her name is now written on the non-returned list on the small chalkboard outside Dorm Building No.3!\u201dThen, he stared at Hao Ren in shock and asked, \u201cDid you actually\u2026 do that with her last night?\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d Hao Ren knocked Zhou Liren\u2019s forehead.He looked at Xie Yujia, who was sitting in the front row organizing her notes; it seemed like she wasn\u2019t bothered by the surrounding discussions. Suddenly, he felt that he should have dealt with last night\u2019s situation in a better way.Girls saw reputation as a significant matter, especially girls like Xie Yujia\u2026\u201cGo listen to the scientific lectures together, go eat together, and don\u2019t return together\u2026 anyone would misunderstand\u2026\u2026.\u201d he thought.Yu Rong was still discussing this matter, and Hao Ren suddenly turned his head and said, \u201cStop! If anyone still talks about this, I won\u2019t be friends with him anymore!\u201dSeeing the good-tempered Hao Ren suddenly getting mad, Yu Rong and others stopped talking right away and looked at him in confusion.Ever since the incident of Hao Ren beating up half of the basketball team, the guys from his class and in Dorm Building No.7 had more respect for him.Even though some of the guys in the class liked Xie Yujia and were jealous of Hao Ren, who dared to gossip under the powerful force of Hao Ren?Besides, Hao Ren\u2019s buddy Zhao Jiayi wasn\u2019t an easy guy to deal with either. Not only did he have many friends at the school, but he also got the members of the basketball team to pay for his medical expenses after the injuries; that made the other students think that he had a powerful background.Hao Ren heard that all the conversations stopped, and he readjusted his focus and looked at Xie Yujia in the front row. He noticed that her ears were red, and it seemed like she was affected by the conversations around her after all.\u201cIt\u2019s better if I keep some distance from her for a period of time\u2026\u201d Hao Ren thought.Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!Hao Ren\u2019s cell phone on the desk vibrated a little.He picked up his cell phone and saw a text message from an unknown number.He opened up the message and saw a few words, \u201cWhat is China\u2019s Capital for coal production?\u201d\u201cWho is this?\u201d Hao Ren didn\u2019t react well since he was in a bad mood. Normally, he would delete this type of boring text messages right away, but he replied on purpose this time, \u201cChina\u2019s coals are black!\u201dBuzz! Buzz! Buzz!A few seconds, he received another text message.\u201cI\u2019ll choke you to death! Tell me now what are the coals?\u201dSensing the tone of the message, Hao Ren instantly knew who sent it.\u201cThe kids now days are so high-tech. Zhao Yanzi is already cheating using text messages?\u201d he thought.Hao Ren replied, \u201cFushun. Do the rest yourself. I won\u2019t answer you anymore.\u201dBuzz! Buzz! Buzz!In a short time, he received another message, \u201cHow many basins are there in Xinjiang?\u201d\u201cThis little brat\u2026\u201d Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to reply, but he thought of the anger he would have to endure later and gave in. He sent a message back, \u201cTarim Basin and Dzungarian Basin. I am not answering anymore!\u201d\u201cThere should be another one!\u201d another text message was sent back.Hao Ren thought for a few seconds and replied, \u201cQaidam Basin! I\u2019m not replying to your texts!\u201dBuzz! Buzz! Buzz!A few minutes later, his cell phone vibrated again.\u201cIs there an end to this\u2026\u201d Hao Ren took out his cell phone, and it was Zhao Yanzi\u2019s message again, \u201cSo stupid! Qaidam Basin is from Qinghai! I almost did it wrong!\u201d\u201cYou blame me for a question you couldn\u2019t do? You deserve to do it wrong! Go take your exam!\u201d Hao Ren replied.\u201cWhat exam?! I just finished! I\u2019m eating lunch now!\u201d Zhao Yanzi replied again immediately.It\u2019s the first time Hao Ren texted Zhao Yanzi in class. He suddenly felt like she was kind of cute despite her rudeness.\u201cHow many more exams do you have?\u201d Hao Ren thought about it and sent a text message to express his concern.Well, this little girl was his \u201cfianc\u00e9e\u201d after all. On top of that, Zhao Yanzi\u2019s parents had helped Hao Ren so many times before. He couldn\u2019t really ignore her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThere are two more exams in the afternoon. Physics and Chemistry. I\u2019ll be relying on you!\u201d a happy message was sent to his cell phone.\u201cI was wondering why she was suddenly so nice to me. It turns out that she wants me to help her cheat\u2026\u201d Hao Ren finally realized the reason and replied, \u201cHelp yourself, and you\u2019ll be well-fed and well-clothed!\u201dZhao Yanzi didn\u2019t reply to this message; she was probably mad.Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to argue with her, so he put down his cell phone and looked out the window; it was raining outside.\u201cTwo exams mean that she\u2019ll finish school around two o\u2019clock.

He noticed that she was keeping notes carefully and her phone screen never lit up on her desk. He knew that it wasn\u2019t her who Hao Ren had been texting.\u201cIf it isn\u2019t her, maybe Hao Ren is talking to another girl? He didn\u2019t come back last night\u2026 so it wasn\u2019t Xie Yujia whom he spent the night with? The four of us always hang around at school, and we know who Hao Ren talks to\u2026 Who else could Hao Ren get in touch with?\u201dZhao Jiayi was a bit confused as he noticed a secretive smile on the edge of Hao Ren\u2019s lips when he checked his message. He knew it must have been a girl.\u201cOr\u2026\u201d Zhao Jiayi did not think of Hao Ren\u2019s tutoring job at night; Instead, his thoughts headed in a completely different direction: Su Han.\u201cWould Hao Ren be that bold? People have been gossiping about him chasing after Su Han, but they were only gossips. No one would actually believe that Su Han would become Hao Ren\u2019s girlfriend\u2026\u201dDing, ding, ding\u2026 the bell cut off Zhao Jiayi\u2019s thoughts.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go eat!\u201d Zhou Liren shouted.It was raining outside, and none of them brought an umbrella. But \u201cguys don\u2019t need umbrellas\u201d was a catchphrase they used. Therefore, the four of them lined up nicely and ran towards the cafeteria.Yixin Cafeteria, which was between Academic Building E and Administrative Building F, was a great cafeteria with delicious dishes at a cheap price. Because of these factors, it was always packed during lunchtime. The lineup would take forever for the latecomers.When the four of them sprang into the cafeteria, the lineup was already long.\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Zhou Liren nudged Hao Ren and pointed at the door of the cafeteria with his chin.Xie Yujia was swinging the rainwater off her body as she walked in the cafeteria. Half of her body was soaked; she probably didn\u2019t bring an umbrella with her today because she didn\u2019t expect there to be rain. The white shirt became a little transparent after being soaked in the rain, and her skin could partly be seen through her shirt.\u201cClass President!\u201d Hao Ren waved at her.Xie Yujia looked at Hao Ren and nodded. She walked over as she squeezed the water out of her hair.\u201cSo sneaky\u2026\u201d Zhou Liren said lightly.He thought Hao Ren called her here because he wanted to see her body under the wet transparent shirt from a closer distance. However, Hao Ren immediately took his dark-colored jacket off and put it around Xie Yujia after she had walked over.Xie Yujia was stunned when the jacket landed on her. She was suddenly touched by the move again.Having seen all that, Zhao Jiayi thought to himself, \u201cRen has his tricks with girls!\u201d\u201cYour shirt is wet, and everyone can see through it,\u201d Hao Ren explained.Xie Yujia nodded in appreciation.She thought since she already got wet, it would make sense to go back to change and grab the umbrella after lunch. Who knew\u2026After taking off the jacket, Hao Ren was only left with a thin white tank top. His almost naked body, as well as the wetness, made him seem weird amongst the crowd.The good thing was that the weather wasn\u2019t too cold. Although it was raining, the temperature wasn\u2019t low. Even though it was a little inappropriate for Hao Ren to stand in the cafeteria like this, he wouldn\u2019t catch a cold.\u201cClass President, you can stand in front of me,\u201d Zhao Jiayi said to her affably as he secretly admired Hao Ren\u2019s brilliant tricks.\u201cIt\u2019s ok. I shouldn\u2019t cut the line. I\u2019m here with Ma Lina, so I\u2019ll just go get in line with her over there,\u201d she said as she walked towards Malina who was not far from them.She suddenly turned back after a few steps. \u201cThank you, Hao Ren. I\u2019ll return your jacket on Monday!\u201d she said.Hao Ren waved generously. \u201cIt\u2019s ok; you can take it. It\u2019s just a bit dirty because I haven\u2019t washed it for a few days,\u201d he replied.Xie Yujia laughed as she stiffed the jacket a little. Then, she walked over to Ma Lina.\u201cAtta boy! You\u2019ve got some moves!\u201d Zhou Liren punched on Hao Ren\u2019s shoulder when he saw her walking away.\u201cWhat moves? She was soaked. Shouldn\u2019t I have lent her a jacket?\u201d Hao Ren murmured.\u201cYou are interested in Xie Yujia, right?\u201d Zhou Liren looked excited.\u201cStop it. You have made it embarrassing enough yesterday,\u201d Hao Ren glimpsed at him.\u201cShe must be interested in you. Judging from my experience\u2026\u201d Zhao Jiayi joined their conversation abruptly.\u201cWhat experience. Aren\u2019t you single too?\u201d Hao Ren said.Zhao Jiayi wasn\u2019t happy about it. He patted his chest and said, \u201cWho says I\u2019m not experienced\u2026while I was in middle school\u2026\u201dCao Ronghua, Hao Ren, and Zhou Liren immediately covered up their ears and started shaking their heads. Listening to Zhao Jiayi\u2019s brilliant history was worse than watching a boring drama show!Hao Ren got changed after lunch, and they headed to the Mechanical Drawing Class in the afternoon. The four of them chose the same class, but Xie Yujia didn\u2019t enroll in this course. Therefore, she wouldn\u2019t run into them and certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to return Hao Ren\u2019s jacket.Their school week finished as the two-hour class came to an end. The Internet Cafe was their Friday afternoon\u2019s \u201cmust-go-to place\u201d. However, instead of joining them, Hao Ren said he needed to go home that weekend.Zhou Liren and the guys knew about his grandma\u2019s incident, and they thought he was in a hurry to go see his grandma. Therefore, they didn\u2019t insist.Hao Ren said goodbye to them and stuffed two umbrellas in his bag. Then, he took a bus to LingZhao Middle School, where Zhao Yanzi was.It was almost two o\u2019clock, and it was only about ten minutes from the end of their last mid-term exam.The street outside was crowded with cars such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes, and Bentley\u2026It was like a mini automobile exhibition.LingZhao Middle School was the best middle school in East Ocean city. LingZhao Private School had both a middle school and a high school department. Mid-schoolers can directly enter the high school department after graduation, so this school not only had the smartest students in East Ocean City but also welcomed the children of the most wealthy and influential people in the city.Hao Ren was the only one who came here to pick a student up with just an umbrella in his hand.Pleasant music sounded from the school.Then, the parents who were waiting got out of their cars and searched for their kids. In fact, even if it was only a typical Friday afternoon instead of the midterms season, this place would still be filled with cars. Since this was a semi-boarding school, most students could only go home on the weekends.A large group of energetic mid-schoolers rushed towards the school gate in their blue uniforms. They were moving forward akin to the waves of the ocean.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe parents called out their children\u2019s names, and the kids boarded the cars. Hao Ren also moved forward to look for Zhao Yanzi.\u201cWhy are you here, Uncle?\u201d Hao Ren didn\u2019t find her in the \u201cwaves\u201d. However, she appeared in front of him just like last time.\u201cUm\u2026I\u2019m here to pick you up,\u201d Hao Ren tossed her the umbrella in his hand and said.\u201cSince when was it your turn to pick up Zi?\u201d a cruel voice said beside them.Hao Ren turned around and saw Third Uncle staring at him while standing beside a black Mercedes.

Then, he looked up at the sprinkling rain, opened up his other umbrella, and walked away.\u201cWhat\u2026what temper\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi pouted as she stared at his back. She ran over and dragged on his arm after a few seconds. \u201cWhy throw a tantrum like a kid? You can come back with us now that Third Uncle is here to pick me up!\u201d she asked.\u201cI am not getting into your Third Uncle\u2019s car!\u201d Hao Ren lightly threw away her hands.\u201cWhat are you saying, kid!\u201d Zhao Kuo heard it with his acute hearing and shouted from afar.\u201cStubborn! Grumpy!\u201d Zhao Yanzi stomped her right foot and decided to leave Hao Ren alone. She jogged back to her Third Uncle at the school gate.She was a little moved when she saw him waiting at the school gate with an umbrella, even though she didn\u2019t like this \u201cUncle\u201d.\u201cForget about him and let\u2019s go!\u201d Zhao Kuo sensed Zhao Yanzi\u2019s bad mood. After he opened the door to let her in, he started the black Mercedes.Hao Ren quietly walked along the street with his umbrella. He ignored the million-yuan cars that were passing by him because all he cared about was his grandma.It was a random idea to pick Zhao Yanzi up from school; he didn\u2019t do it because it would make her happy. If anything, he was doing it as a reward for her hard work lately.As the black Mercedes passed by, Zhao Yanzi looked back at Hao Ren who was walking by himself. She felt bad for him all of a sudden.\u201cThird Uncle, let it go. Let\u2019s take him with us,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said.\u201cI\u2019m not taking him\u2026who does he think he is!\u201d Zhao Kuo said with pride.The car left Hao Ren behind while they were talking.Zhao Yanzi turned back again to look at Hao Ren who was strolling in the rain, and she said to her Third Uncle all of a sudden, \u201cThird Uncle, stop the car!\u201d\u201cWhy? Did you forget something?\u201d hearing Zhao Yanzi shout, Zhao Kuo immediately parked the car along the roadside.\u201cYou go ahead, Third Uncle. Take my backpack with you!\u201d Zhao Yanzi opened the car door and jumped out.\u201cZi! It\u2019s raining!\u201d Zhao Kuo insisted.\u201cIt\u2019s fine!\u201d she ran back over a puddle as the water reflected the shape of her slim pale legs.Hao Ren was walking with his head down under the umbrella when the small body entered his view.He looked up and saw Zhao Yanzi standing in front of him, breathing heavily.\u201cGive me the umbrella!\u201d she reached out her hand.\u201cHuh?\u201d Hao Ren didn\u2019t realize what she meant.\u201cGive me the umbrella!\u201d She repeated in a louder voice.Hao Ren looked at her as he took the other umbrella out of his bag, confused.Zhao Yanzi quickly snatched it from Hao Ren, opened it up, and walked ahead in big steps.Hao Ren sped up to catch up with her.\u201cWhat are you doing? You are walking with me when there is a car waiting for you?\u201d Hao Ren asked her.\u201cWho wants to keep you company! Can\u2019t I just enjoy the rain?\u201d Zhao Yanzi hopped over a small puddle and pouted.\u201cZi!\u201d Third Uncle backed up the Mercedes towards them and rolled down the window.\u201cIt\u2019s ok, Third Uncle! You can go back first!\u201d Zhao Yanzi waved at him.He looked at her in confusion as he noticed the impatience in her tone. He felt wronged and wondered if he had done anything incorrectly.\u201cIt is indeed more and more difficult to see through this little girl. She was so mad at this boy that she wanted him dead\u2026but now\u2026\u201dHe sighed as he watched them walk forward side by side. Then, he stepped on the gas paddle and headed home.The drizzling rain fell down generously from the sky.The air hadn\u2019t been this fresh for quite a while, and the cool and refreshing wind made them feel very comfortable.Zhao Yanzi\u2019s shoes and socks got wet, yet she still insisted on walking instead of taking the bus or hailing a taxi.\u201cHow did the exams go?\u201d asked Hao Ren.\u201cJust so-so,\u201d she answered. Then she added, \u201cYou didn\u2019t help me cheat.\u201d\u201cYou certainly have only yourself to rely on in the exam. How can you cheat?\u201d Hao Ren said with a strong sense of righteousness.\u201cPffft, don\u2019t tell me you have never cheated,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said with disdain.Hao Ren examined his past and realized that he wasn\u2019t really that righteous during his middle school exams either.However, he quibbled for himself in silence, \u201cWe only used some cheat sheets\u2026and the most serious offense would be peeking at other people\u2019s papers. No one was bold enough to ask for answers with a cell phone\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen will you get your results?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cSo annoying\u2026 you aren\u2019t my parents!\u201d Zhao Yanzi rolled her eyes at him.Hao Ren quibbled secretly, \u201cI\u2019m your tutor\u2026and\u2026 I\u2019m your future husband\u2026\u201dSeeing how defensive she was, he kept quiet as they continued walking. She didn\u2019t answer any of his questions.\u201cYou and that Class President\u2026what has been going on with you two lately?\u201d Zhao Yanzi suddenly asked after taking a few more steps.\u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d Hao Ren was interested.\u201cJust curious.\u201d she pouted her mouth and sped up a little.Hao Ren thought to himself as he hurried up and caught up with her, \u201cCould she be thinking that Xie Yujia is my girlfriend at school?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t think she could get jealous too\u2026\u201d Hao Ren thought as he looked at her pretty little face.They sped up and slowed down from time to time until they arrived at Zhao Yanzi\u2019s house.Zhao Kuo\u2019s black Mercedes was parked outside.Zhao Yanzi took out her key and opened the door, and she immediately heard the quarrel between her dad and her Third Uncle from the living room.\u201cWhat? Brother, you are inviting those jerks from West Ocean?\u201d Zhao Kuo\u2019s loud voice came into Hao Ren\u2019s ears.\u201cQuiet, we have guests here,\u201d Zhao Guang shushed him, \u201cWe need to invite them whether you like it or not. They used to be on good terms with us after all. If we don\u2019t invite them to Zi\u2019s 15th birthday party, it would be like coming to an open rupture publicly.\u201d\u201cBrother!\u201d Zhao Kuo stopped himself when he noticed that Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi had returned.\u201cDad, Third Uncle, I\u2019m back,\u201d Zhao Yanzi walked inside and put the umbrella in a corner.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cUncle,\u201d Hao Ren followed in and greeted.He didn\u2019t want to look rude in front of Zhao Guang although he wasn\u2019t a big fan of Zhao Kuo.\u201cWhere is my grandma?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cHehe, she is cooking dinner with Hongyu in the kitchen,\u201d Zhao Guang laughed. Then, he turned to Zhao Kuo with a straight face and said, \u201cYou, come with me to the study room.\u201dZhao Kuo\u2019s face turned red as he looked down.

Zhao Yanzi followed suit and greeted her mom Grandma.Since dinner wasn\u2019t ready yet, Zhao Hongyu asked Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi to go up and play before the dinner was served. Thus, they went upstairs and entered Zhao Yanzi\u2019s room.Zhao Yanzi was no longer feeling any resistance against Hao Ren entering her room, but it still was her territory, and Hao Ren must obey her rules while he was in there.\u201cI\u2019ll play games, and you read,\u201d upon entering the room, Zhao Yanzi immediately assigned tasks.From the bookshelf, Hao Ren picked up the novel he was halfway through reading. He asked with deliberate casualness, \u201cYour birthday is coming up?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s next month,\u201d Zhao Yanzi answered. She turned on the computer before changing into the pink slippers she usually wore in her room.\u201cWhat\u2019s the West Ocean your Third Uncle just mentioned?\u201d Hao Ren continued to ask.He knew very little about the Dragon Tribe. Sometimes he felt like they were no different from ordinary people, and sometimes every movement and every word of theirs was a mystery.\u201cThe West Ocean is also a dragon clan, just like our East Ocean Dragon Clan but with different areas under control. They suck at running businesses on the land, and they are stupid and arrogant,\u201d Zhao Yanzi\u2019s tone revealed her resentment toward the West Ocean.\u201cAnd there are South Ocean and North Ocean too?\u201d Hao Ren speculated.\u201cYeah, but we have little contact with them; we would only meet at the annual conference,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said while waiting for the computer to start.\u201cAnnual conference?\u201d\u201cYeah, it is a regular meeting for River, Steam, Lake, Ocean Dragon Clans. Except for the annual conference, there are biannual Dragon Tribe Meetings. This stuff is more complicated than you can imagine. However, it\u2019s not my business, and my dad takes care of it,\u201d she said.The game flashed on the computer screen, and Zhao Yanzi jumped onto her chair and grabbed the mouse; she was no longer in the mood to chat with Hao Ren.On the other hand, Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to ask any more questions. He knew he must get used to it gradually since things, just like Zhao Yanzi said, were more complicated than he had imagined.From Zhao Yanzi\u2019s short answers, Hao Ren knew Zhao Guang was running the East Ocean Dragon Clan and thus had a lot on his plate. No wonder he was busy all day long, and his younger brother Zhao Kuo exceeded him in cultivation levels.As Zhao Guang\u2019s wife, Zhao Hongyu was also a busy woman. Only Zhao Yanzi, cherished by all, was the stress-free and happiest one. Even though this was the case, she would have to shoulder her share of the burden and obligations when she grew up.Sitting in the reclining chair and looking at Zhao Yanzi who was busy playing the online game, Hao Ren mused to himself.After thinking for a while, he picked up a novel to kill time.The clock ticked away, and the dinner was soon ready.\u201cZi! Ren! Come down for dinner!\u201d Zhao Hongyu called to them at the foot of the stairs.\u201cComing!\u201d Zhao Yanzi and Hao Ren answered and got up at the same time before running out of the room together.\u201cWhere is Third Uncle?\u201d coming downstairs, Zhao Yanzi asked when Zhao Kuo was not in her sight.\u201cHe had to go back to finish some business,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said with a helpless expression on her face.\u201cHe must have quarreled with Dad,\u201d Zhao Yanzi pointed out the truth before sitting down. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I will go visit him later,\u201d she said.\u201cYour Third Uncle is short-tempered and stubborn. He needs time to think things over,\u201d Zhao Hongyu took off the apron and said. Then, she turned to Hao Ren and his grandma and added, \u201cAuntie, Ren, let\u2019s eat.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Grandma sat down and wrung her hands. \u201cI\u2019ve stayed here for so long, and I\u2019m sorry for the trouble I have caused you,\u201d she said.\u201cNo trouble at all. Auntie, you have helped me a lot,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said warmly.Grandma smiled and turned to Hao Ren as she said, \u201cRen, I\u2019ve decided with your father that tomorrow, our two families will have lunch together and get to know each other.\u201d\u201cTomorrow\u2026\u201d Hao Ren nodded, having expected that such a day would come.\u201cSo, this dinner is the last meal I will have in Zi\u2019s home,\u201d Grandma added with slight melancholy.During her stay, she and Zhao Hongyu had become friends, she liked Zhao Yanzi a lot, and although Zhao Guang rarely spoke, he showed sincere respect towards her. Those were the reasons why Grandma felt reluctant to leave their home. After all, her son and daughter-in-law, who had always been busy with their work, had never given her such warmth.\u201cAuntie, don\u2019t say that. You can come over any time you want. If you want, you can stay here forever,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said immediately.\u201cHehe, it\u2019s impossible. I can\u2019t trouble you anymore. Let\u2019s eat,\u201d Grandma said.Seeing the sorrow and reluctance on Grandma\u2019s face, Hao Ren wished that she could continue to live here. However, just like what Grandma said, they couldn\u2019t trouble Zhao Hongyu\u2019s family anymore. Besides, his dad and mom had returned from abroad, and there was absolutely no reason for his grandma to live in someone else\u2019s home.\u201cRen, you can stay here for the night and don\u2019t need to go back to school,\u201d Zhao Guang said abruptly.\u201cOk,\u201d Hao Ren said immediately, wanting to spend more time with his grandma.It was drizzling outside, and the atmosphere in the dining room was a little melancholy.It was the second time that Hao Ren stayed the night in Zhao Yanzi\u2019s home. He slept on the beddings on the floor in his grandma\u2019s room, and they chatted well into the night. Grandma was full of praises for Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family, and it was clear to Hao Ren that she had formed a deep bond with them during her short stay there.The next day was Saturday, and it was a sunny day. Zhao Hongyu had packed for Grandma while still trying to change her mind about leaving.Grandma wanted to stay with them, but she also felt uncomfortable staying any longer. To show her gratitude, she had asked her son to book a reservation at the Starlight Restaurant, the best in East Ocean City.The lunch was scheduled for 11 A.M. According to the plan, Hao Ren\u2019s parents should drive to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s home to pick up Grandma\u2019s bags before going to the restaurant together for lunch.However, Hao Ren\u2019s parents didn\u2019t show up at 11 A.M.Grandma, who had been restless all morning, couldn\u2019t wait anymore and called her son. Soon, she was informed that they were delayed and would arrive soon.Therefore, they sat in the living room and waited.Half an hour passed, and Hao Ren\u2019s parents still didn\u2019t show up. Grandma who had been trying to appear calm became agitated.\u201cAuntie, take it easy. The traffic must have delayed them,\u201d Zhao Hongyu comforted her.Hao Ren was getting impatient too. Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family put off everything and waited for his parents, but they just wouldn\u2019t show up.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAnother half hour passed. As Grandma was about to call again, a white Ford arrived at the door.Hao Ren\u2019s father in a silver suit and his mother in a long black dress came out of the car and hurried over hand in hand.They matched each other perfectly, no matter in looks or temperaments.If Xie Yujia was here, she would have been stunned because the couple was no other than Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang who gave the science lectures at East Ocean University a couple of days prior!Seeing Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang coming to her side, Grandma didn\u2019t show any joy on her face; instead, an unusually stern expression appeared.

Today, I must have my say,\u201d Grandma raised her hand and stopped Zhao Hongyu.Seeing the awkward situation between the mother and the son, Yue Yang finally broke the silence and said, \u201cMom, please calm down. Your high blood-pressure\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd you!\u201d Grandma who was usually amiable was beside herself today. \u201cHave you ever taken care of Ren since he was born? I took care of him all by myself! Have you ever worried about the duties in this household? I took care of them all by myself! Work! Work is everything in your lives!\u201d she shouted.Scolded by Grandma, the decorous Yue Yang backed off a little and remained silent.\u201cGive me your hand!\u201d Grandma yelled at Hao Zhonghua for the third time.Seeing his mother shaking in rage, Hao Zhonghua was afraid that she would have another stroke due to high blood pressure, and he had no choice but to lower his head in embarrassment and extend his palm.Grandma looked around and saw a folding fan on the coffee table, and she picked it up instantly.The folding fan had a frame made of fine rosewood, and it was smooth and hard.\u201cAs the old saying goes, amongst all the virtues, filial piety comes first. With all your trips overseas, it seems like you have forgotten our ancestors\u2019 teachings and disciplines!\u201d Grandma held Hao Zhonghua\u2019s hand in one hand and hit the palm with the folding fan.Feeling the sharp pain, Hao Zhonghua had the urge to withdraw his hand, but he dared not to in front of his angry mother.A red welt appeared immediately on his palm.\u201cWhere were you when I passed out due to high blood pressure? Where were you when I was discharged from the hospital? Where were you when I was ready to go home? If it weren\u2019t for Zhao Hongyu\u2019s family, I would have been dead!\u201dSnap! Another hard lash landed on Hao Zhonghua\u2019s palm.Yue Yang felt sorry for her husband but was afraid to stop Grandma. She said in a low voice, \u201cMom, please don\u2019t say that.\u201d\u201cEvery word I have said is true! Hongyu\u2019s family saved my life, and they took care of me. How about you? Zhonghua is my son, and you are my daughter-in-law, but where were you when I was in danger? And you treat my saviors with such attitude? I may be illiterate, but I know the virtues and how to act in good faith!\u201dSnap! The third hard lash landed on Hao Zhonghua\u2019s palm.Hao Zhonghua\u2019s palm had quickly turned red, and this well-known scientist stood obediently before his mother with a red and sweaty face.\u201cWe agreed on eleven o\u2019clock, then you must come at 11 A.M.

I don\u2019t want such a son like you!\u201d Grandma got even angrier with each lash. She was now panting, but the beatings got even more forceful.Hao Zhonghua bowed before his mother and bore the pain with a frown. He kept his head lowered the whole time.When he was a boy, Grandma would scold him this way whenever he messed around or got lazy with his studies. In the last 20 years since he grew up and earned his reputation, he had not been punished like this.Now in front of outsiders, he experienced his mother\u2019s fury again. He felt not only the burning pain but also shame, guilt, and some gratitude as well.\u201cI taught you everything about filial piety, faith, honesty, and honor! Have you forgotten them all?!\u201dSnap! Snap! Snap! Snap! Another series of lashes landed on his palm, and Hao Zhonghua gritted his teeth, endured his mother\u2019s rage, and didn\u2019t withdraw his hand that was regarded as the deftest and valuable hand in science as his hands could split cell membranes with the assistance of a microscope and a pair of tweezers.\u201cDon\u2019t think you are above everyone with several prizes and the support of the Mayor! There is something higher than us! How can you call yourself a man when you treat the saviors this way?!\u201d out of breath, Grandma couldn\u2019t stand any longer, and she had to sit down on the sofa behind her.\u201cMom, it is my fault,\u201d Hao Zhonghua moved forward and held his mother\u2019s hand in his and said with sincerity.\u201cI\u2019m wrong, too,\u201d Yue Yang took two steps forward and said with her head lowered.\u201cIt\u2019s never too late if you can correct your mistakes! Don\u2019t forget our ancestors\u2019 teachings while you are abroad!\u201d Grandma said in a loud voice.\u201cAuntie, don\u2019t work yourself up. You must take care since you were just discharged from the hospital,\u201d Zhao Hongyu took the opportunity to appease her.\u201cGrandma, please don\u2019t be so angry,\u201d Zhao Yanzi also walked over to comfort Grandma.Hao Ren moved to his grandma\u2019s side and gently patted her back, helping her calm down.Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang were now standing beside Grandma in silence. A couple of days before, they were confident and passionate scientists giving lectures in the auditorium, but now, they had tears in their eyes as they faced Grandma like kids who misacted.\u201cFaith and virtue! They are the foundation of our race! Even though you are building a big career, you will amount to nothing if you have forgotten the most basic principles of being a human!\u201d Grandma raised her head and added.\u201cMom, we know we are wrong,\u201d Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang said together.\u201cOk then. Now go get my bags!\u201d Grandma gave them a hard look.Hurriedly, Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang began to move Grandma\u2019s bags into their car. Hao Ren saw the red tomato-like palm of his dad that was shivering uncontrollably, and he knew Grandmother was dead serious this time.\u201cI apologize for what happened today,\u201d after several deep breaths, Grandma returned to her amiable self and said to Zhao Hongyu and Zhao Guang.\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Zhao Guang said with a smile.After publicly scolding her son, Hao Ren\u2019s grandma apologized to her hosts, hoping that they would not hold any grudges against Hao Ren\u2019s parents for being late.\u201cMom, the bags are all in the car. Shall we go to lunch now?\u201d Hao Zhonghua reentered the house and said.His expression returned to normal and didn\u2019t look as embarrassed as a few minutes before.\u201cUm-hem,\u201d Grandma stood up and walked toward the door.After several days of rest in Zhao Hongyu\u2019s home, Grandma was much stronger, and her complexion looked much healthier.She was old, but her head was clear. She knew Zhao Hongyu must have put many valuable ingredients in the chicken soup that she made been making for herAlso, she noted how much Zhao Hongyu liked Hao Ren.Seeing Zhao Yanzi and Hao Ren together, she found his grandson\u2019s calm manner quite matching with Zi\u2019s cuteness.Now that she had told everyone that Zhao Hongyu\u2019s family was her savior and showed them her authority as the big boss of the Hao Family, everything else would go smoothly.She was willing to wait a few years as long as Zhao Yanzi and Hao Ren had feelings for each other. She didn\u2019t mind Zhao Yanzi\u2019s age since when she was young, she had even seen girls marrying as young as 12 or 13!Hao Ren was oblivious to his grandma\u2019s plan underneath her outburst, and he walked his grandma out of the door and into his father\u2019s Ford.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Guang drove out his black Chevrolet, and the two cars drove toward the Starlight Restaurant one after another.\u201cToday, are we just have lunch, or do we want to let Ren\u2019s parents know about the arrangement?\u201d sitting in the passenger seat, Zhao Hongyu asked Zhao Guang.\u201cAuntie has just expressed to us that she has the final say in the family.

After all, it was unacceptable for Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang to be one hour late on such an important day.Afraid to anger her again, Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang dared not to start a conversation.Like Zhao Yanzi who was in the Black Chevrolet, Hao Ren looked out at the white clouds and got lost in his own thoughts.Two cars arrived at the Starlight Restaurant situated in the center of the city, and the two families greeted each other again and were ushered by a waiter into their reserved compartment.They sat down, and Hao Zhonghua handed the preselected menu to the waiter.\u201cI\u2019m grateful for your family\u2019s excellent care of my mom.

We didn\u2019t know that you were Ren\u2019s parents, and it\u2019s a great honor to meet you!\u201d Zhao Hongyu added.\u201cI\u2019m just doing some research, and I\u2019m still far from being a big scientist,\u201d Hao Zhonghua\u2019s face reddened a little and said hurriedly as he thought of the scolding he received from his mother in Zhao Guang\u2019s home.\u201cWhat do Mr. and Mrs. Zhao do?\u201d Yue Yang asked warmly.\u201cHehe, I run a small business, and my wife runs a small design studio,\u201d Zhao Guang answered.\u201cThat is nice,\u201d Hao Zhonghua answered courteously.He knew Zhao Guang was humble. Judging from the interior decorations of Zhao Guang\u2019s home, he knew Zhao Guang\u2019s business wasn\u2019t small. However, he didn\u2019t realize that Zhao Guang\u2019s company was, in fact, the famous Mingri Group whose businesses covered multiple industries. It was also one of the most prominent machinery manufacturing groups in the country.Although Zhao Hongyu\u2019s design studio had only about a dozen employees and was just a mini-company, it had an excellent reputation in the designer circle and was ranked among the top six interior design studios in the country.\u201cYour daughter is beautiful. Is she in middle school?\u201d Yue Yang looked at Zhao Yanzi across the table and smiled.\u201cYes, she is in the Eighth Grade. She is not a diligent student, and that\u2019s why we asked Ren to tutor her,\u201d Zhao Hongyu answered with a smile.\u201cHehe. I hope our Ren didn\u2019t cause you too much trouble,\u201d Yue Yang continued.\u201cNot at all. Ren is smart and considerate. I like him very much, and so does my husband. He will make an excellent son-in-law,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said.Yue Yang didn\u2019t realize Zhao Hongyu was serious about the topic. She chuckled and said that Ren still had a long way to go.\u201cI\u2019m sure Ren will follow your steps and become a great scientist, won\u2019t he?\u201d Zhao Hongyu asked.\u201cNo! No!\u201d Yue Yang waved her hand immediately and replied, \u201cZhonghua and I are both in the science field and know it is too demanding of a career. That\u2019s why we have never pushed him in this direction. We hope he could live an ordinary life.\u201dZhao Hongyu nodded and was satisfied with this answer. She had been worried that Hao Ren would put all his time and energy into his work like his parents and neglect Zi.\u201cYour Zi looks so pretty and smart. She will one day do great things,\u201d Yue Yang complimented.\u201cHehe, with her present academic performance, we don\u2019t expect too much of her. We just hope that she will be like an ordinary girl and could find a good husband who loves her.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s just in the Eighth-Grade. Isn\u2019t it too early to think about that?\u201d\u201cNo, not too early\u2026\u201dThe mothers were warming up to the topic while they waited for their dishes.In the eyes of the public, Yue Yang was a mysterious female scientist. But on the inside, she was just an ordinary mother who loved to talk about her kid.She and her husband were both famous scientists, but they didn\u2019t have high expectations for their son. Their lives looked dignified and high above the crowd, but it was very hard. They hoped Hao Ren\u2019s life would be simpler and more comfortable.Otherwise, with their abilities, they would have sent Hao Ren to the best elementary, middle, and high schools in the country and then to the best domestic or even international university.Meanwhile, Hao Ren had always been low-key, never using his parents\u2019 names for his convenience. He worked hard, climbed the academic ladder all by himself, and finally entered the nationally well-known East Ocean University.Of course, it was not a secret that Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang had a son named Hao Ren. A few officials in the municipal government knew about it, but they were familiar with these two scientists\u2019 temperaments and wouldn\u2019t do anything to please them.While Yue Yang and Zhao Hongyu warmed up to each other, Zhao Guang and Hao Zhonghua, like typical fathers, talked about their work on the other side of the table. Since neither of them knew about the other\u2019s area of profession, their talk sounded superficial and tentative.As to Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi, they just looked at each other from across the table. While the parents began to get familiar and the topics got broader and more profound, they still couldn\u2019t contribute and just observed the direction of their conversation cautiously.When the dishes began to be served, Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi busied themselves with eating, which was another excuse not to join in on their parent\u2019s conversations.\u201cYou are very busy, and you don\u2019t stay in the country often, do you?\u201d seeing Zhao Guang and Hao Zhonghua still not being so close with each other, Zhao Hongyu initiated another topic directed at Hao Zhonghua.\u201cOh, we occasionally go abroad to do research, but we stay in the country most of the time. However, Yue Yang and I spend most of our time in the labs and research institutes and have neglected Ren. Fortunately, he is a good boy and is very independent,\u201d Hao Zhonghua answered.\u201cYou don\u2019t have much time to take care of Auntie, right?\u201d Zhao Hongyu asked tentatively.\u201cWe hired Uncle Wang to take care of my mother. We usually squeeze some time to stay with her when we\u2019re in the country. The incident made us realize that there were some problems with our previous arrangement. Yue Yang and I discussed it, and we are considering hiring another person whose sole responsibility will be to take care of my mother,\u201d Hao Zhonghua said.\u201cI can still move around. I don\u2019t need a hired help to take care of me!\u201d Grandma, who had been silent, suddenly spoke.\u201cI have a suggestion. Since Auntie got along with us well and you are very busy, she can live in our home, and we can take care of each other,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not appropriate,\u201d Hao Zhonghua immediately shook his head and replied, \u201cWe have troubled you for so long, and we can\u2019t put more burden on you!\u201d\u201cSo, I\u2019m just a burden,\u201d Grandma threw out a comment.\u201cMom, that\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u201d hurriedly, Hao Zhonghua turned to Grandma and explained.\u201cBefore you came back from abroad and after you came back to East Ocean City, you have just called me twice. Doesn\u2019t it mean that I\u2019m a burden to you?\u201d Grandma said.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSince Zhonghua and I returned from abroad, we had to make time to give lectures at East Ocean University, and then the supervisors arranged for us to be interviewed by all kinds of media. We were so busy that we didn\u2019t even have much time to sleep\u2026\u201d Yue Yang tried to explain.\u201cI will be left with a hired help. It seems that I\u2019m really a burden\u2026\u201d ignoring Yue Yang\u2019s explanation, Grandma continued her complaint.In fact, Hao Zhonghua cared a lot about his mother, However, each time he called her, she would complain over the phone for more than one hour, making his tight schedule even tighter. As time went on, Hao Zhonghua called his mother less often.Facing Grandma\u2019s continuous complains, a thought occurred to Yue Yang, \u201cMom\u2019s greatest hope is for Ren to find a girlfriend.\u201dShe turned to Hao Ren and asked, \u201cRen, the girl who came to the lectures with you is your girlfriend, isn\u2019t she?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mom, stop it!\u201d Hao Ren was anxious and tried to explain, \u201cShe\u2026 she just dragged me in there to find seats!\u201dHao Ren\u2019s face was turning red from the anxiety, but Yue Yang, who was oblivious to the situation, thought Hao Ren was shy. She laughed, \u201cHehe, don\u2019t hide it from Mom. I won\u2019t object to it, and your grandma will be happy for you as well. Besides, that girl is very pretty and warm-hearted. You father thinks well of the girl, too.\u201dBiting her lips, Zhao Yanzi\u2019s expression had been changing while her parents\u2019 expression turned from astonished to unreadable.\u201cRen, is she really your girlfriend?\u201d Grandma asked.\u201cNo, she isn\u2019t. She is really just the Class President. We only went to the lectures together!\u201d Hao Ren explained while sweat began to form on his forehead.Although there was nothing yet between Zhao Yanzi and himself, he was at least her fianc\u00e9 in name. Besides, there was nothing between him and Xie Yujia; he wouldn\u2019t take the blame for things he didn\u2019t do.However, his explanation only convinced his parents that something was going on. Seeing his mother\u2019s interest, Hao Zhonghua warmed up to this topic and added, \u201cRen, although I only had a glimpse of her, I think she is a good girl. She was good to you, I won\u2019t object if you go out with her. If she is not your girlfriend yet, you can pursue her since she looks like a fine and considerate girl. I\u2019m sure your Grandma will like her as well.\u201dHe had angered his mother with his lateness, and now he wanted to cheer her up with her favorite topic.However, they didn\u2019t know they were making the matter worse in the eyes of the potential in-laws sitting across the table.Due to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s young age, they had never thought of pairing Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi together.Seeing Hao Ren\u2019s recent good mood, Grandma thought that he had a girlfriend. Now with her guess confirmed by Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang, her face lit up. \u201cRen, don\u2019t hide it from us. Find some time and bring the girl back to visit me!\u201d she said cheerfully.After all, making Zhao Yanzi her granddaughter-in-law was just her wishful thinking, and she would be happy if Hao Ren had indeed got a girlfriend.Zhao Yanzi couldn\u2019t listen to it anymore. With a snort, she stood up abruptly and left their compartment.\u201cZi!\u201d Zhao Hongyu called after her, but Zhao Yanzi didn\u2019t look back.Frustrated, Hao Ren hurriedly stood up and followed her out of the compartment.Seeing Hao Ren following her, Zhao Yanzi quickened her steps and ran toward the stairs. However, how could she outrun Hao Ren?Hao Ren rushed up and grabbed her wrist.\u201cThe Class President is not my girlfriend!\u201d Hao Ren told her in earnest.Zhao Yanzi snorted and shrugged away from his hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me an explanation!\u201d she yelled.Hao Ren looked at her and asked, \u201cAre you angry?\u201d\u201cI have nothing to be angry about since I don\u2019t like you. I don\u2019t care who your girlfriend is,\u201d Zhao Yanzi said stiffly.\u201cOk, I will explain it to you anyway. That day, the Class President wanted to go to the lecture. Since no one wanted to go with her, she asked me. Later during the book signing event, since one student could only get one signature, she dragged me there to get one extra signed book for her\u2026\u201dHao Ren explained in earnest, but Zhao Yanzi put her hands on her ears, refusing to listen to him.\u201cThis silly girl\u2026\u201d Hao Ren took her right hand away from her ear and said, \u201cYou must listen to me\u2026\u201d\u201cNo! No! No\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi kept shaking her head.Helpless, Hao Ren grabbed her hand and began to drag her back to their compartment.\u201cLet me go! I won\u2019t go back!\u201d Zhao Yanzi hit Hao Ren\u2019s arm with her left hand.Determined, Hao Ren bent over abruptly and carried her in his arms before walking back to their compartment.\u201cYou jerk!\u201d Zhao Yanzi cursed at him while hitting Hao Ren\u2019s shoulders and chest with both of her fists and kicking around above his arm with her feet.However, her feeble struggle was nothing to Hao Ren who was now on the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll.\u201cDon\u2019t kick, or your skirt will slide up,\u201d with Zhao Yanzi in his arms, Hao Ren warned her.\u201cYou\u2026jerk!\u201d she turned her head abruptly and bit Hao Ren\u2019s arm.\u201cOuch!\u201d Hao Ren yelled but didn\u2019t put her down. \u201cAre you a dog?\u201d he asked.Fortunately, he had reached the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll, and his arm muscles were as hard as rocks; that was why Zhao Yanzi\u2019s teeth didn\u2019t injure him.\u201cI\u2019m a dragon!\u201d Zhao Yanzi retorted indignantly.Hao Ren put the red-faced Zhao Yanzi down at the door of their compartment. She turned around and tried to escape, but Hao Ren caught her by the shoulders and turned her around. He took her hand before pushing the door open and walking in.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hao Zhonghua asked in bafflement.\u201cSomething came up, and Zi had to run out to deal with it,\u201d Hao Ren said.With doubt on his face, Hao Zhonghua asked again, \u201cThen\u2026 the matter is taken care of?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s done.\u201d Hao Ren nodded.He grabbed onto Zhao Yanzi\u2019s hand a little tighter and tried to prevent her from running out again.\u201cCome back to your seats,\u201d Hao Zhonghua said.Looking at Zhao Yanzi\u2019s red face, Zhao Hongyu didn\u2019t know what had happened. But seeing Hao Ren rushing out in concern and returning hand in hand with Zi, she thought it was a good sign.\u201cYou two sit together,\u201d she said as she looked at them.Zhao Yanzi didn\u2019t want to sit next to Hao Ren, but she couldn\u2019t get her hand free from his grip. Besides, she didn\u2019t want to appear willful and poor-mannered in front of Grandma and Hao Ren\u2019s parents.\u201cThat girl really is not your girlfriend?\u201d Yue Yang resumed the topic after seeing Hao Ren returning while holding Zi\u2019s hand; she found it weird.\u201cMom, just believe me when I say she\u2019s not my girlfriend!\u201d Hao Ren said helplessly. The words were for his mom and Zhao Hongyu.\u201cWell. I thought you had finally got yourself a girlfriend,\u201d after hearing Hao Ren\u2019s answer, Grandma was a little disappointed.\u201cIn the old times, a man could have three to four wives. However, our Ren doesn\u2019t even have one\u2026\u201d Grandma lamented.Hao Ren began to sweat at his Grandma\u2019s ancient thoughts\u2026\u201cAuntie, what do you think of our Zi?\u201d seeing Zhao Yanzi and Hao Ren wrestling under the table, Zhao Hongyu asked.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSmart, lively, cute\u2026 I like her a lot,\u201d Grandma answered.\u201cWhat do Mr. and Mrs. Hao think?\u201d Zhao Hongyu turned the question to Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang.\u201cOur impressions of her are excellent. She\u2019s pretty and clever,\u201d Yue Yang said, and Hao Zhonghua, who was sitting next to her, nodded in agreement.Sensing the direction of the conversation, Zhao Yanzi and Hao Ren stopped their attacks and defenses under the table simultaneously and turned their eyes to the elders at the table.After observing and pondering for a few seconds, Zhao Hongyu asked Grandma, \u201cAuntie, do you want Zi to become your granddaughter-in-law?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedThe entire room was quiet after Zhao Hongyu\u2019s remark.It was easier for Zhao Yanzi because she had already seen it coming. Hao Ren, on the other hand, was astonished. He had figured that this matter would be brought up, but it was still surprising for Zhao Hongyu to bring it up directly like this.He thought this first meeting would be a simple meetup and the marriage proposal would have to wait until after a few meetings between the parents.Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang stared at Zhao Hongyu in surprise; they thought they must have heard her wrong.Grandma\u2019s right hand was just about to reach for a dish, and it stopped mid-way as her expression was half surprised and half cheerful.However, Zhao Guang\u2019s settled expression was telling them that they did not hear anything wrong.\u201cYou are saying\u2026\u201d Grandma\u2019s lips trembled at the sudden good news, \u201cZi can be my granddaughter-in-law?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Zhao Hongyu nodded.Grandma turned back and looked at Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi, who were sitting together in embarrassment. She then turned to Zhao Hongyu and agreed promptly, \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201dHao Zhonghua and Yue Yang looked at each other, confused. They had no idea what was going on.Even though they had the fastest brains and the most rigorous logic, it was still beyond their anticipation to receive a daughter-in-law as soon as they got back from abroad. They didn\u2019t even have time to deal with many important issues yet.\u201cThis arrangement is settled then!\u201d Zhao Hongyu happily clapped her hands and breathed out deeply in relief; she seemed to be very pleased with this answer.Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang had no chance to talk at all in the last half a minute as Grandma who was the final boss already made the decision.Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi looked at each other awkwardly; they didn\u2019t expect things to go like this.Hao Ren\u2019s parents turned to Zhao Yanzi to actually take a good look at her.Although this little girl gave them a pretty good first impression, it was still too soon to upgrade her from the daughter of their mom\u2019s saviors to their own daughter-in-law.Fortunately, they have been through many critical events and had the temperament to deal with emergencies. No one knew what embarrassment they would have caused if they didn\u2019t have such good self-restraint.\u201cWhat\u2026is this all about?\u201d Hao Zhonghua eventually asked after a few seconds.\u201cI like Ren very much, and Auntie adores Zi. So, we want to assign them a \u2018 baby marriage 1 \u2018 today,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said softly.\u201cWhat are the kids\u2019 opinions then?\u201d even the top scientist Hao Zhonghua was confused by the situation.\u201cI don\u2019t agree, mom!\u201d Zhao Yanzi stood up immediately at the chance to talk.\u201cHow about Ren?\u201d Hao Zhonghua asked; he valued Hao Ren\u2019s opinion more.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Hao Ren hesitated.After he looked at Zhao Hongyu\u2019s expecting stare, he paused for a moment and said, \u201cI have no problem with it.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be a big deal since Zhao Yanzi had already said no. I shouldn\u2019t disappoint Zhao Hongyu and Zhao Guang since they have been so nice to me,\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.He had never seen himself liking a shrewish little girl like this. His Otaku nature would make him more likely fall for cuter and sweeter girls.\u201cZi\u2019s objection is not a real objection. So, you won\u2019t have an issue if Zi is ok with it?\u201d Zhao Guang said.His words gave out a strong sense of stateliness, and Zhao Yanzi shut her mouth even though she wanted to say something.\u201cWe certainly won\u2019t interfere if they both agree to it,\u201d Hao Zhonghua answered after some consideration. He had examined Zhao Yanzi closely and didn\u2019t find any shortcomings. Plus, he was aware of how much Grandma liked her.He decided to go along with their plan as he had no clue what their intentions were.\u201cSo, that\u2019s a yes,\u201d Zhao Guang said.\u201cIt\u2019s a yes, but Zi is only\u2026\u201d Hao Zhonghua was confused.\u201cAs long as you are ok with it, we can discuss the rest of it later,\u201d Zhao Guang said.Hao Zhonghua looked at his wife for her opinion, and Yue Yang looked at Zhao Yanzi\u2019s pretty doll face from across the table and nodded to her husband.She was indeed a great scientist; her logical thinking calmed her down immediately; other moms would have panicked in such a situation.\u201cIt all depends on the kids. Yue Yang and I won\u2019t interfere if they wish to develop their relationship in the future,\u201d Hao Zhonghua stated his opinion upfront.Having said that, he still felt a bit weird since Zhao Guang\u2019s daughter was only in middle school. There was no need to be in such a rush even if they really liked Hao Ren.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d Zhao Hongyu smiled and raised her glass of sprite. \u201cCheers!\u201dZhao Yanzi, who was still standing, realized that her opinion had been completely ignored by her parents as if it didn\u2019t matter at all.However, she didn\u2019t want to throw a tantrum in front of Grandma. It was killing her to swallow it back.\u201cZi, Grandma adores you so much!\u201d Grandma took her little hand and said cheerfully.Zhao Yanzi felt wronged, but she couldn\u2019t cry out a single tear. Her right to speak was absolutely taken away by her parents as they 'sold her out\u201d without even giving her a chance to fight back.\u201cThis is hegemonism! I need to fight back! Fight back!\u201d she thought.However, her passion was immediately suppressed as soon as she noticed Zhao Guang\u2019s razor-sharp stare.Ah\u2026But her dad had the final say in the family and was the Dragon King. Hao Ren\u2019s family was very democratic, and he could make his own decisions. On the other hand, even though Zhao Yanzi was the princess, she could only act tough outside of her family.\u201cCheers\u2026\u201d Yue Yang raised her glass and said to Zhao Hongyu.She thought her son was too nerdy to ever find a girlfriend, but a daughter-in-law has presented herself now.She found herself liking Zhao Yanzi for some unknown reason; maybe it was because she had always liked girls but never gave birth to one, or maybe Zhao Hongyu\u2019s straightforward and warm personality left a good impression on her mind.As long as Grandma was happy about it, Zhao Yanzi\u2019s young age shouldn\u2019t be a problem for this \u201cbaby marriage\u201d since they could wait. Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family seemed like a really nice family after all.The agreement had been tentatively reached with their toast.Hao Zhonghua suddenly remembered his red pocket, so he took it out and put it into Zhao Yanzi\u2019s hand, \u201cUncle forgot to bring gifts for this first meeting. Take this little red pocket as a gift.\u201dEven though he called it a little red pocket, there was actually 8,000 yuan inside as a thank you gesture for the good care Zhao Hongyu\u2019s family provided Grandma.The two families naturally became closer due to their special bond.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNo way\u2026 There is no way I am marrying him\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi mumbled secretively while holding a tantrum inside.The lunch brought the two families together; Hao Ren\u2019s family wanted to express their gratitude whereas Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family intended to get a commitment.Although Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang agreed to the baby marriage verbally, they did not take it very seriously. To them, it was like a silly joke which could be either serious or not. It would be good if Zhao Yanzi were to become their daughter-in-law in the future, but it would be ok too if it didn\u2019t work out in the long run.After Hao Zhonghua paid the bill after lunch, the two families went through the hallways to the lobby.\u201cCome over at seven o\u2019clock in the morning tomorrow, and I\u2019ll take you to the Dragon Palace,\u201d Zhao Guang walked over to Hao Ren and whispered into his ears.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After he and Zhao Hongyu have met Hao Ren\u2019s parents, the remaining doubts were gone, and it was time to bring Hao Ren to deal with more complicated things.This group of people said goodbye to each other outside of the restaurant. Even though Zhao Hongyu mentioned having Zhao Yanzi as Grandma\u2019s granddaughter-in-law and it was quite a shocker, the atmosphere during lunch was still very harmonious and pleasant.Because of Grandma, the two families already trusted each other, and both thought that the other family was a great family.Yue Yang patted Zhao Yanzi\u2019s head to say goodbye to her. Even though this little girl was her daughter-in-law in name, Yue Yang wasn\u2019t in a hurry to invite her over. It was only her first-time meeting Zhao Yanzi, and there would be other chances in the future to get to know her better.Hao Ren helped Grandma to get in the car while Hao Zhonghua went to the driver\u2019s seat, and Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family also got into their vehicle. They waved at each other and went separate ways.On the way back, Grandma sat in the back seat, and she was happier than someone who had won one million yuan when she thought of the cute Zi becoming her granddaughter-in-law.The car headed to their house near the sea. On the way back, Hao Zhonghua\u2019s cell phone rang about five to six times, and those calls were all about work. In the end, he turned off the phone so that no one could reach him.To make Grandma happy, he took the whole day off from work to spend it with his family.He finally woke up from the punishment today; even though his science career was booming, he couldn\u2019t neglect his family either.On the other hand, Yue Yang turned off her cell phone to avoid any disturbances as well.After they arrive at the house, Hao Zhonghua parked the car in the garage and brought the whole family inside.This house had two floors and was bigger than Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family\u2019s two-story home. The living room was located on the main floor, and the entire wall that was facing the sea was made from glass. This was a true oceanfront cottage.The bedrooms were located on the second floor, and the dining room was located in a small wooden house that was connected to the second floor by a little bridge. Uncle Wang, who usually cooked for Grandma, lived on the first floor of the small house.There was a big garden on this property, and Uncle Wang also took care of all the flowers and grass.If Grandma wasn\u2019t too lonely staying here, this type of house would be very comfortable to live in.\u201cMom, I\u2019m not going to the laboratory today. I\u2019ll spend some time with you,\u201d Hao Zhonghua held Grandma\u2019s hand and said respectfully.\u201cI know you are busy with work. I am your mom, and it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t place too much time and energy on me. However, you can\u2019t neglect my savior, Zi\u2019s family, in the future, understood?\u201d Grandma said.\u201cYes, it was my fault today,\u201d Hao Zhonghua admitted his mistake sincerely and explained on behalf of Yue Yang as well, \u201cIn fact, Yue Yang arrived at my laboratory very early this morning. I wanted to finish the job I had on hand and thus dragged her down with me.\u201d\u201cIt is fine, you don\u2019t have to explain. I\u2019ll be happy if you guys come home more often. Even when you\u2019re busy with work, you still need to take care of your bodies. You two should go take a nap now that you are home,\u201d Grandma patted Hao Zhonghua\u2019s arm and said.After all, he was still her son. She hit him pretty hard earlier, and she felt sorry for him.\u201cThat\u2019s nothing, we will walk around with you outside.\u201d\u201cGo for a walk? I\u2019m going to take a nap. I\u2019m a bit tired today,\u201d Grandma walked into her room and closed the door.Thus, Hao Zhonghua and Yue Yang had to return to their room for some rest. Indeed, they had been busy and were still jet-lagged when they came back home.Hao Ren also went back to his room, locked the door, and opened the window. He started cultivating the Spirit Concentration Scroll.In this period of time, he had been wearing two Mount Tai Bracelets, which meant that he was carrying more than 50 kilograms on a daily basis. Therefore, he had to cultivate the Spirit Concentration Scroll and use the Nature Essence inside his body all the time. Other than sleeping at night, he couldn\u2019t slack off at all.Because of this, he had gotten better at cultivating the Spirit Concentration Scroll. Even though he didn\u2019t go to Su Han\u2019s office in the past two days, he had been cultivating on the way to school, in class, and when he was eating.It might be because this place was close to the sea and there were a lot of water elements in the air, Hao Ren felt like he progressed further on the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll.The Nature Essence that originally filled half of his body seemed to have increased in volume. Especially the nine critical acupoints in the top, middle, and lower parts of his body, they absorbed more Nature Essence and responded to the Dragon Core in his Dantian 1 .When he realized this, he had already cultivated until night.Hao Zhonghua came to get Hao Ren for dinner. When his son opened the door, he suddenly felt like this kid not only seemed energetic but also had a unique temperament.\u201cHe has gone through so many changes! I\u2019ve been out of the country for a month or so, and he has become better looking. No wonder girls have started to like this kiddo,\u201d Hao Zhonghua thought.After dinner, Hao Zhonghua asked his son to go out for a walk along the beach.The sea breeze was slightly salty, but it felt comfortable when it blew on their bodies. The tides at night made some soft crashing noises, and it was ear-pleasing. This was a great place to talk as they walked on the soft sand.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while. You\u2019ve become buffer than before, and you look more like a grown-up,\u201d Hao Zhonghua said as he walked beside Hao Ren and looked at him under the moonlight.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to tell you what to do, Dad, but you got to take care of Grandma more,\u201d Hao Ren stepped on the sand as he told his dad.\u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t care, but your grandma likes to complain a lot. Ah,\u201d Hao Zhonghua sighed, \u201cBe honest with me; was the girl we saw at the university your girlfriend?\u201d\u201cNo, she\u2019s my Class President,\u201d Hao Ren answered.\u201cThat girl seems great,\u201d Hao Zhonghua whispered.Hao Ren stopped this topic and asked, \u201cWhy did you guys just agree casually to the arrangement today?\u201d\u201cZhao Yanzi\u2019s family seems very good after we interacted with them today. Besides, we were trying to make your grandma happy when we said that at lunch. You know how your grandma is; once she is certain of something, we must do it her way. Since she likes the little girl, your mom and I had to obey her wishes so she wouldn\u2019t get angry,\u201d Hao Zhonghua said.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your intention?\u201d Hao Ren asked again.\u201cYou can\u2019t say that either,\u201d Hao Zhonghua looked at the surging tide and replied, \u201cThis little Zi is really beautiful and cute. If she\u2019s my daughter-in-law, that\u2019s pretty good too. However, you never know what will happen in the future.\u201dHe thought for a few seconds and asked, \u201cDo you still remember Little Carrot?\u201d\u201cLittle Carrot?\u201d Hao Ren seemed a bit confused.\u201cHaha, you forgot already? It\u2019s the girl who always came to our home when you were young. Her dad was my classmate at the university. We were pretty close at the time, and their family always came to our place. We called her Little Carrot because she was tiny and skinny. She used to follow you around all the time, don\u2019t you remember?\u201dHao Ren thought for a while; in his vague memory, there was a little girl who had a runny nose, wore a light-yellow dress, and had a red flower in her hair. She was a little girl who followed him all the time and always called him \u201d Little Older Brother 2 \u201c.\u201cYeah, I remember a little,\u201d Hao Ren nodded and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s their family right now?\u201d\u201cHer dad was one of the groups of people who went overseas in my generation. Because the means of communication wasn\u2019t developed at the time, we gradually lost contact with each other. That Little Carrot probably went to the States with her dad,\u201d Hao Zhonghua looked at the sky and said in exclamation.\u201cWhy mention that all of a sudden?\u201d Hao Ren asked.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh, it was because the two families were close at the time, and we also joked about the baby marriage since you guys got along well. As kids grow up, these types of arrangements don\u2019t count,\u201d Hao Zhonghua said in disappointment.\u201cWhen Zi grows up, if she ends up liking you, your mom and I won\u2019t oppose you guys being together. However,\u201d Hao Zhonghua\u2019s tone changed, \u201cIf Zi doesn\u2019t like you, or if she finds herself a boyfriend in the future, forget about this and don\u2019t force it. Understand?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Hao Ren nodded as he used the tip of his toe and drew a deep sand pit.\u201cZhao Yanzi\u2019s family is very well-educated and considerate. Even if we can\u2019t be in-laws, it\u2019s still good to be friends with them in the long run,\u201d Hao Zhonghua said.\u201cDragon Palace,\u201d Hao Ren looked at the endless sea under the moonlight and suddenly thought of what would happen tomorrow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedHao Ren woke up early the next day. He opened up the window, faced the ocean, and cultivated the Spirit Concentration Scroll for another two hours.The fog in the morning formed some spiral-shaped water elements, and they entered the acupoints in Hao Ren\u2019s body without his awareness. The water elements went through more than a hundred of acupoints in his body, and they traveled along and stored themselves in the Dantian to irrigate the Dragon Core.The second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll was the realm of guiding the energy inside the body. Even though it couldn\u2019t be compared to the third level, it was still great progress for Hao Ren who just started cultivating.After cultivating, Hao Ren\u2019s body had become more and more refined. Even though there wasn\u2019t the growth of muscle in his body, his strength increased by many folds.Hao Ren stopped his cultivation process when he heard something outside. He opened the door and walked out.\u201cYou\u2019re up so early?\u201d Hao Zhonghua, who was in the hallway, asked when he saw his son walking out.\u201cAre you still working today, Dad?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cYeah, I still have many things to finish from yesterday. You look great! Must have had a good sleep from last night?\u201d Hao Zhonghua asked.Hao Ren nodded with a smile.In fact, the additional benefit of the Spirit Concentration Scroll was to restore one\u2019s stamina quickly, and it worked better than sleeping.Both Father and Son went downstairs, and Hao Zhonghua made something simple to eat.\u201cDad, can you drive me to the city on your way?\u201d Hao Ren said as he ate.\u201cToday\u2019s Sunday. You don\u2019t have classes, right?\u201d Hao Zhonghua was a bit confused.\u201cI\u2019m going to Zi\u2019 place. Uncle Zhao is taking me somewhere today,\u201d Hao Ren replied.\u201cOh, okay,\u201d Hao Zhonghua ate the bread and didn\u2019t ask anything else.Hao Zhonghua was very similar to Hao Ren. Even if they were close to someone, they didn\u2019t know how to express their feelings well.Hao Zhonghua was also busy with his research. Therefore, Yue Yang was the one who took the initiative and went after Hao Zhonghua.Hao Ren saw that his dad was absent-minded and knew that he was already thinking about work beforehand.After eating breakfast, Hao Ren left a note on the table and went to the city in his dad\u2019s car.Hao Zhonghua\u2019s biology laboratory was located in the city. When they were living in East Ocean City, he usually drove to work as well. Yue Yang\u2019s Climate Research Institute was by the ocean and wasn\u2019t far from their oceanfront property; it was only little over a ten-minute walk.Hao Ren felt his dad worked hard as Hao Zhonghua was even working on the Sunday. While Hao Zhonghua drove, he glanced at Hao Ren and suddenly asked, \u201cWhy do you wear bracelets like a girl?\u201d\u201cWhat bracelet? They\u2019re just small wristbands,\u201d Hao Ren explained.\u201cDid little Zi give you those?\u201d Hao Zhonghua asked.Hao Ren shook his head.Hao Zhonghua was just trying to get a conversation going and didn\u2019t care about the bracelets that much. It was pretty common for young guys to wear wristbands.However, he wouldn\u2019t have thought that those two small bracelets, which looked cheap, would be something unimaginable.He thought for a while and said, \u201cI might have to leave in two days.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Hao Ren asked immediately.\u201cConnecticut, United States. There\u2019s an Academic Conference at Yale University. I also have a few friends in the biology circle there, and I have to visit them,\u201d Hao Zhonghua said.\u201cFor how long?\u201d Hao Ren kept asking.\u201cHmm\u2026 for about two weeks,\u201d Hao Zhonghua answered.Hao Ren was silent and felt unhappy about it. His dad just came back for a few days and already planned on leaving again. No wonder Grandma always complained.\u201cBut your mom won\u2019t go this time. She\u2019ll stay and take care of Grandma in East Ocean City,\u201d Hao Zhonghua said.Seeing his son not answering back, Hao Zhonghua knew that Hao Ren was unhappy. \u201cTake care of yourself and come back more often on the weekend to accompany your grandma,\u201d he said.Hao Ren still didn\u2019t say anything. He thought his dad could stay longer this time, but who knew that he had to travel again after having a meal with Zhao Yanzi\u2019s family.The car stopped at the door of Zhao Yanzi\u2019s house, and Zhao Guang came out to welcome them when he heard the noise.Hao Zhonghua opened the door and quickly got out to greet Zhao Guang.\u201cWould you mind if I bring Ren along to somewhere?\u201d Zhao Guang, who looked dignified in appearance, said with a loud voice.\u201cHaha, of course not. I\u2019ve been busy with work lately. When I am free, I\u2019ll also bring Zi out with my family,\u201d Hao Zhonghua, who also had a strong figure and good temperament, responded loudly.\u201cGood, good, good\u2026,\u201d Zhao Guang and Hao Zhonghua greeted and chatted with each other more.Then, Hao Zhonghua had to go to work and left.Zhao Guang led Hao Ren inside the house.Hao Ren felt nervous when he thought of going to the so-called Dragon Palace.\u201cAre you awake, Zi?\u201d Zhao Guang asked in a loud voice as he entered the house.\u201cAiya\u2026 I still want to sleep!\u201d Zhao Yanzi whined with a lazy voice from her bedroom upstairs.Zhao Guang led Hao Ren upstairs and opened her bedroom door.Zhao Yanzi was covered up in a blanket with two thin legs hanging outside the bed. Her hair was messy, and her pajamas were also crumpled. She looked like a little bird that was still not awake.She opened her eyes semi-consciously and saw Hao Ren also standing at the door. She instantly screamed and shrunk into her blanket as she yelled, \u201cDad, why did you bring him up here!\u201d\u201cDo you want to go to the Dragon Palace?\u201d Zhao Guang stood at the door and asked.\u201cNo, no, no\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi yelled from under the blanket.Zhao Guang sighed helplessly and yelled at the bedroom next door, \u201cYou stay home and take care of Zi, Hongyu. I\u2019ll bring Hao Ren to the Dragon Palace.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Zhao Hongyu\u2019s voice came from next door.Their tones were so calm as if Zhao Guang was taking Hao Ren to another house of theirs to fetch something, and that destroyed the excitement and mystery Hao Ren felt.\u201cForget about Zi; she still wants to sleep. Let\u2019s go ourselves. She had been preparing for her exams this week and is pretty tired. I\u2019ll let her rest over the weekend,\u201d Zhao Guang said as he brought Hao Ren out of Zhao Yanzi\u2019s bedroom.\u201cOkay,\u201d Hao Ren nodded. He knew Zhao Yanzi\u2019s temper and never argued with her.Seeing Zhao Guang\u2019s calm expression, Hao Ren thought to himself again, \u201cMaybe my expectation is too high. Is the real Dragon Palace like a broken temple or memorial temple? And is that the reason why they didn\u2019t stay in the sea and came on land to do business? Do those treasures, precious materials, and rare monsters not exist?Hao Ren was nervous, disappointed, and yet excited at the same time.Zhao Guang ignored Hao Ren\u2019s uneasiness, drove out his black Chevrolet, and took Hao Ren towards the beach.As they traveled, Hao Ren found that the route they were on got them closer and closer to his home near the ocean. Gradually, he could see his family\u2019s home near the beach.\u201cEh\u2026 the Dragon Palace is actually near my house\u2026 We\u2019ve been \u201cneighbors\u201d for so many years and didn\u2019t even know\u2026\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.Suddenly, Zhao Guang turned into another area.This place wasn\u2019t far from the lively Golden Seacoast Resort, and there were many reefs and rocks near the area. The wind and waves were huge, so it was rare for people to go there.Zhao Guang parked the car and led Hao Ren towards the biggest reef in the area.The shape of the reef looked like an upright shell, and there was a deep indentation in the middle; half of a person could almost hide in there.\u201cUse the Spirit Concentration Scroll and hold this in your mouth,\u201d Zhao Guang put a pearl-like bead in Hao Ren\u2019s palm.Hao Ren followed the instructions and felt like his whole body was covered in a layer of cold air. Zhao Guang pushed on Hao Ren\u2019s back, and Hao Ren flew towards the reef.He closed his eyes instinctively. When he opened his eyes again, he was at the bottom of the ocean.The sea water surrounded him but couldn\u2019t get closer than a meter. The bead in his mouth became colder and drew the energy in his body bit by bit.\u201cI must have the legendary \u2018Water Repellant Bead\u2019 in my mouth! It could be counted as a dharma treasure\u2026\u201d Hao Ren speculated secretly.\u201cDon\u2019t overthink. Follow me,\u201d Zhao Guang transmitted his voice to Hao Ren in the water and led the way.The Spirit Concentration Scroll wasn\u2019t only the Dragon Tribe\u2019s fundamental cultivation technique but also the \u201cverification code\u201d through the reef passage. If one didn\u2019t cultivate Spirit Concentration Scroll, he or she can\u2019t get through.\u201cNo wonder Su Han was very nervous when she sensed my energy; this fundamental cultivation technique is a key to their secrets and needs to be strictly controlled,\u201d Hao Ren thought while he followed Zhao Guang.The sea water yielded automatically when Hao Ren moved around. With Water Repellent Bead in his mouth, he followed Zhao Guang closely and wasn\u2019t affected by the waves.Hao Ren didn\u2019t know how long they had been walking, but he suddenly saw a golden object in front of them.\u201cFollow me and don\u2019t take any wrong steps,\u201d Zhao Guang\u2019s suddenly said to Hao Ren again and transmitted his voice over.Zhao Guang explained further probably because he was worried, \u201cThere are many dangerous and complex array formations here. You would turn into ashes if you take a wrong step.\u201dHearing those words, Hao Ren suddenly focused and ceased his original intention of looking around.\u201cI am the son-in-law of the Dragon King. Wouldn\u2019t it be a huge joke if I died at the entrance of the Dragon Palace\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cTwo steps left, one step forward, one step right, two steps across\u2026\u201d Zhao Guang\u2019s calm voice was clearly transmitted to Hao Ren.Hao Ren didn\u2019t dare to be careless. He followed the steps Zhao Guang told him and followed him steadily.This way of walking was similar to the playground game of hopscotch, but the pressure on Hao Ren was insane!Who would think that such dangerous array formations were hidden under the tranquil and serene sea water?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cFour steps forward, then turn right!\u201d Zhao Guang shouted.Hao Ren looked at his steps closely as he walked four steps forward quickly and then turned right immediately.\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Hao Ren felt relieved at Zhao Guang\u2019s words.A short walk of ten minutes made him sweat through his entire clothes.He rubbed his neck, raised his head, and looked up at the golden, luxurious, and grand East Ocean Dragon Palace!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedThe golden structure was even more majestic than the Forbidden City in Beijing! One couldn\u2019t even see the end of it! The red defense walls that were more than ten meters tall stretched sideways with bright golden encaustic tiles on top, the defense walls were so long that their endings were nowhere in Hao Ren\u2019s sight.Thousands of golden armored soldiers were patrolling along the defense wall, and they looked like little gold dots from afar.More than 80 Elders in purple robes awaited politely on the sides of the entrance, and over 20 well-built generals in heavy black armors bowed with hands folded in front of them on the defense wall.\u201cWelcome back, Dragon King!\u201dThey shouted out together with hundreds of soldiers who were standing behind them as Zhao Guang stepped forward.The sound was so loud that it created a huge wave in the ocean.Zhao Guang waved casually and walked the city with Hao Ren, and the Elders followed them in.The Generals bowed again and continued with their patrolling duties along the defense wall, followed by their soldiers.Hao Ren noticed that there were sections of different palaces beyond the defense wall. There were generals and soldiers in different uniforms patrolling around each section.Bom, Bom, Bom\u2026 A hump-backed short elderly man in a gray robe jogged over.\u201cForgive me, Dragon King, for not welcoming you at the gate! I had no idea that you were coming!\u201d he kneeled and said as soon as he got in front of them.Zhao Guang pointed casually at where this old man was kneeling, and the old man was got up with the assistance from Zhao Guang\u2019s energy. Zhao Guang asked as he kept walking, \u201cPremier Xia, anything new lately?\u201dPremier Xia walked right beside Zhao Guang and said, \u201cDragon King, the Dragon Palace has been in peace for the past month. Everything is under the governing of the elders\u2026\u201d\u201cGet to the point,\u201d Zhao Guang said.\u201cOf course\u2026\u201d Premier Xia nodded, \u201cI have passed the important issues on to Elder Sun and Elder Lu for you to read over. As for the trivial things, the elders here in the palace and I took care of them. I stored the 36 ripe Thousand-Year Crimson Fruits sent from the South Ocean into the Ice Palace. We delivered six pearls of the highest grade as a gift to North Ocean\u2019s Sixth Princess\u2019 wedding. Since West Ocean\u2019s Qinghe Dragon King\u2019s nephew\u2019s is having some trouble with cultivation, they borrowed the green-grade technique, Seven Hearts and Spirit Scroll, from us. After discussing with several Elders, we decided to lend it to them for one month. They will probably return it with some gifts by then\u2026\u201dZhao Guang listened to Premier Xia\u2019s report and hummed from time to time. Premier Xia, on the other hand, talked timidly as he didn\u2019t want to say anything wrong.Hao Ren noticed that the Elders behind them didn\u2019t make any noise out of respect, and they even walked quietly in order to not make any sound. Hao Ren truly experienced the \u201cpower of the king\u201d for the first time.Zhuang Guang seemed like such an easy-going person with his quiet and calm personality. Who would have thought that he was the leader of the East Ocean Dragon Clan that had control over 30 million ocean creatures in the East Ocean region! Any decision of his would be able to turn the ocean around!\u201cIs Elder Zhao\u2019s altar almost ready?\u201d Zhao Guang asked abruptly.\u201cWe have finished 78 working procedures, and the altar can generate six large array formations and 32 small array formations. It should be done in about another ten days. Third Lord 1 is extremely powerful, and no one in the Human Realm can defeat him. He can certainly go through the Heavenly Tribulation successfully next month and level up into a Heavenly Dragon!\u201d Premier Xia said.Hao Ren, who was walking beside Zhao Guang, figured that they were talking about Zhao Yanzi\u2019s Third Uncle, Zhao Kuo. Although he knew that Zhao Kuo was powerful, he never had a clear idea of how powerful the man was. This \u201cundefeatable in the Human Realm\u201d remark demonstrated how terrifying his strength must be.Zhao Guang suddenly turned around once they entered a palace and said, \u201cElders, please head back to get some rest.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Premier Xia pointed at Hao Ren secretly as if he was trying to say something.\u201cOh,\u201d Zhao Guang came to his sense and pointed at Hao Ren as he explained, \u201cThis is Zi\u2019s future husband, Fuma Hao Ren.\u201d\u201cLong Live Fuma Hao Ren!\u201d more than 80 elders bowed as they greeted Hao Ren.Hao Ren felt extremely flattered by this greeting.\u201cThere is no water in the Dragon Palace due to the protection of the array formations. Why are you still holding the Water Repellent Bead in your mouth?\u201d Zhao Guang noticed Hao Ren\u2019s stuffed mouth.After hearing this, Hao Ren spat the bead out.He was astonished at everything on the way as he followed Zhao Guang through almost half of the Dragon Palace. On top of that, Premier Xia\u2019s reports amazed him as well. He still needed more time to recover from all the surprises.Premier Xia took out a silk handkerchief and wrapped Hao Ren\u2019s Water Repellent Bead up before handing it back to him.Hao Ren caught his apple-polishing motive but still thanked him.\u201cYou can show Ren around, Premier Xia. It\u2019s his first time here, and he\u2019s not familiar with the place yet. Explain to him patiently if he has any questions,\u201d Zhao Guang said.\u201cAs you wish, Dragon King!\u201d Premier Xia bowed with his hands folded in front. Then, he glimpsed at Hao Ren and backed out of the palace.Zhao Guang stayed in the palace to deal with matters that weren\u2019t reported to him on land. Just like what Premier Xia said, important issues would be delivered to Zhao Guang by Elder Lu and Elder Sun, and the trivial things, which didn\u2019t need to be reported, were kept inside the Dragon Palace for the Elders and himself to work on. However, those that were neither important nor trivial were left behind for Zhao Guang\u2019s return.Hao Ren and Premier Xia had walked out of Zhao Guang\u2019s main palace.Seeing Premier Xia\u2019s hunched back, Hao Ren suspected that his original form was a shrimp. However, Hao Ren held back asking that because he didn\u2019t want to hurt this elderly\u2019s self-esteem.\u201cFuma, let me show you around since this is your first time at the Dragon Palace,\u201d Premier Xia said to Hao Ren as he humbly stood half a meter behind Hao Ren.\u201cThank you, Premier Xia,\u201d Hao Ren bowed to him with hands folded in the front just like how they did it.Premier Xia was glad that this Fuma, whom he had heard of but never met, was so easy to get along with; even his hunched back straightened a little. He led Hao Ren to the back and said in a loud voice, \u201cThis way, Fuma. Right in front of you is the Hundred-Flower Palace. There are precious fruits of over hundreds even thousands of years here, and they are all great for creating elixirs. I can show you around, but please make sure you don\u2019t touch anything because some of them are deadly toxic. I would be in huge trouble if anything were to happen to you\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cUp ahead is the Mystic Creature Palace. We keep some bizarre creatures in there.

Therefore, we established this place for them to live in\u2026\u201dPremier Xia got more and more excited before they even reached their destination.Hao Ren listened to the amazing stories as he followed Premier Xia. He suddenly thought to himself, \u201cWould there be an imperial harem in such a majestic palace for Zhao Guang?\u201dPremier Xia suddenly turned back to look at Hao Ren.\u201cUm\u2026just pure curiosity\u2026\u201d Hao Ren found an excuse for his weird thoughts and hastily caught up with Premier Xia.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Premier Xia followed Hao Ren anxiously, afraid that he would touch something he shouldn\u2019t.Keeping Premier Xia\u2019s warning in mind, Hao Ren just looked around and was careful not to touch anything without permission.The Palace was enormous, and it was impossible for him to see everything there in a short time. Premier Xia gave him a small tour before leading him out.When they were on their way out of the Hundred-Flower Palace, Premier Xia plucked two small red fruits and handed them to Hao Ren.\u201cThese are\u2026\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cThese are the most common fruits in the Hundred-Flower Palace,\u201d Premier Xia said with an ingratiating smile, \u201cThey aren\u2019t special except for the good taste. You may eat them for fun.\u201dThere was no reason for Premier Xia to trick him, so Hao Ren put the two cherry-sized fruits into his mouth. Chewing tentatively, he found that they were coreless, and he swallowed them right away.A super cool sensation spread from his stomach outward to the acupoints all over his body. It felt like all his acupoints were purged and refreshed.A surging strength instantly filled Hao Ren\u2019s body, and even the Mount Tai Bracelets on his wrists felt much lighter.\u201cThese fruits really don\u2019t have anything special to them?\u201d Hao Ren asked suspiciously when they walked out of the Hundred-Flower Palace.Premier Xia nodded and confirmed, \u201cThey are just sweet fruits. Their power is very weak; one fruit would only give you five-years of cultivation progress of a mortal martial art master.\u201dHe spoke casually, but Hao Ren was stunned.\u201cOne of these common roadside fruits in the Hundred-Flower Palace was equivalent to five-years of cultivation of a martial arts master? What about the rare herbs?\u201d Hao Ren thought.Premier Xia didn\u2019t give him much time to digest this information. He continued excitedly, \u201cNext to the Hundred-Flower Palace is the Mystic Creature Palace. There live many ancient beasts that are extinct in the mortal world. However, we don\u2019t have any unique creatures such as Kirin or Phoenix there.\u201dListening to Premier Xia\u2019s introduction, Hao Ren felt like he was in a wildlife preserve where different animals had their own territories and followed the natural food chain. Premier Xia didn\u2019t dare to venture too deep in there with Hao Ren. After he pointed out several beautiful animals for Hao Ren to look at, he led him out of there quickly.Next, they went to the Profound Cultivation Palace which had more guards than the previous two palaces. This palace was an exquisite seven-level pagoda with each level in a color of the rainbow; from the red bottom level to the purple top level with orange, yellow, green, indigo, and blue in between. Soldiers in gold armors were patrolling the outer fences around each level.With Premier Xia as his guide, no one questioned Hao Ren when he entered the pagoda-shaped Profound Cultivation Palace. The guards were informed of Hao Ren\u2019s identity, and they all greeted him deferentially.Embarrassed by their formal greetings, Hao Ren followed Premier Xia into the palace in a hurry.Sparsely decorated, the palace had bookshelves built around the circular walls. In each of the compartments on the bookshelves. there were radiant books which were protected by array formations.In the rare occasion that outsiders sneaked into the palace, they couldn\u2019t take the cultivation techniques with them if they couldn\u2019t break the array formations.Seeing the confusion on Hao Ren\u2019s face, Premier Xia explained, \u201cFuma, the strength of our dragons is divided into the levels of Qian, Kun, Xun, Dui, Gen, Zhen, Li, and Kan. After breaking through the basic Spirit Concentration Scroll and entering Kan-level, one can cultivate more advanced techniques. The grade of the techniques is divided into the grades of red, orange, yellow, green, indigo, blue, and purple. The cultivation techniques are respectively placed on the seven levels of the Profound Cultivation Palace. The widest first level is for the most common Red-Grade Techniques.\u201dHe led Hao Ren to the second level and said, \u201cThe second level is for the Orange-Grade Techniques.\u201dHao Ren followed him up the levels one by one. The higher the level, the array formations for the protection of the books were more complicated and more powerful, undoubtedly with stronger defense and offense abilities. Of course, the higher the level, the smaller the area got, and the fewer the books.When they got up to the fourth level, Premier Xia stopped. \u201cFuma, we have to stop here. I only have the authority to the first four levels. It means that the Green-Grade Techniques are the best techniques I have access to. Without Dragon King\u2019s permission, we can\u2019t go up any further,\u201d he said.Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to cause trouble for Premier Xia, so he nodded and cast a glance at the fourth level before going downstairs. After all, he was on the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll and had a long way from Kan-level; these cultivation techniques were useless to him anyway.Seeing the Fuma was so reasonable, Premier Xia felt a growing fondness for him.When he was walking down the stairs, Hao Ren suddenly wondered what kind of cultivation technique Su Han, who had reached Qian-level, was using.\u201cPremier Xia, in theory, I can reach Qian-level with the most basic Red-Grade Techniques as long as I work hard, right?\u201d Hao Ren asked when they were out of the Profound Cultivation Palace.\u201cIn theory?\u201d Premier Xia froze for a moment before answering, \u201cI suppose so, but no one has ever reached Qian-level by practicing only Red-Grade Techniques. The better the techniques, the greater the power they contain, and faster the cultivation will be.\u201dLooking back at the towering seven-level pagoda, Hao Ren was amazed at the large collection of techniques the East Ocean Dragon Clan had gotten in the past thousands of years. An ordinary sect would be proud to have three to four cultivation techniques, but this Dragon Palace had a collection of hundreds of them. No wonder smaller Dragon Clans had to come here to borrow cultivation techniques.Premier Xia then took Hao Ren to the Godly Treasure Palace which had three levels, and each level was crammed with all kinds of Dharma treasures. The shining Dharma treasures were protected by their respective array formations.The Dharma treasures were roughly divided into three grades: upper grade, intermediate grade, and lower grade; this grading system was much simpler compared to the cultivation techniques. According to Premier Xia, the best Dharma treasure for a cultivator was the one most fitting for him or her. Since the East Ocean Dragon Clan only collected the good ones, Premier Xia offered, \u201cFuma, if you like something, you can pick one. Access to the Dharma treasures is not strictly off limits as with the cultivation techniques. The East Ocean Dragon Clan has the best forge master who could make any Dharma treasures as long as you could provide the materials.\u201dPremier Xia stood taller with pride when he said that.Hao Ren was tempted since it was the only palace he had seen by now that was not off limits.He spotted a pretty heart-shaped silver pendant.\u201cWon\u2019t it reflect badly on me if I give Zhao Yanzi this Dharma treasure as her birthday gift? It is technically from her home,\u201d Hao Ren thought.Noticing Hao Ren\u2019s interest in the pendant, Premier Xia took a step forward and suggested, \u201cThis is a small-scale spatial Dharma treasure which could store objects smaller than two meters tall. However, I don\u2019t think the shape will look good on you.\u201d\u201cIs it difficult to make?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cIt\u2019s a simple Dharma treasure that has little combat power. It gives you the convenience of carrying things around. This item here would be a better choice for you,\u201d Premier Xia explained patiently as he pointed at another Dharma treasure.\u201cShall I give this to Su Han as a gift?\u201d Hao Ren hesitated and thought, \u201cShe has done me many favors and tutored me with my cultivation. I will just tell her that this is a gift from the Dragon King.\u201dHe made the decision and took two steps forward to pick up the pendant.Bing!A white flash of light bounced Hao Ren\u2019s hands away.\u201cMount Tai Bracelets!\u201d Premier Xia was startled, \u201cYou are wearing Inspector\u2019s Mountain Tai Bracelets? You can\u2019t take this pendant then since Mount Tai Bracelets rejects all Dharma treasures.\u201d\u201cIs the Water Repellent Bead a Dharma treasure?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cIt\u2019s a bead with a special power. However, it is not good enough to be a Dharma treasure. Only those that could be controlled by Dharma spells are Dharma treasures. The pendant which caught your eyes needs a Dharma spell to open the small storage space inside,\u201d Premier Xia explained.\u201cGot it,\u201d Hao Ren replied.\u201cSu Han, Su Han, I meant to be nice and wanted to give you a gift. Well, I\u2019d better work hard to reach Kan-level as soon as possible so I could get rid of the chains on my wrists,\u201d he thought.Rubbing his sore wrists, Hao Ren had to give up on the Dharma treasure and walked out of the Godly Treasure Palace.Hurriedly, Premier Xia followed him out and asked, \u201cFuma, where do you want to go next? Shall I take you to the Godly Elixir Palace for a tour?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go to the Ice Palace you just mentioned. Is it off limits?\u201d not wanting to dampen Premier Xia\u2019s spirit, Hao Ren asked after some consideration.\u201cNo, it is not. However, it\u2019s quite cold in there. You must activate your cultivation technique to keep warm,\u201d Premier Xia said.\u201cOk,\u201d Hao Ren nodded and followed Premier Xia in another direction.On the way, Premier Xia said, \u201cFuma\u2026\u201d\u201cCall me Hao Ren. I\u2019m uncomfortable being called Fuma,\u201d Hao Ren interrupted him.\u201cI don\u2019t dare to cross the line. Then I\u2026\u201d Premier Xia thought for a moment and asked, \u201c\u2026will call you Gongzi Hao. Can I?\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Hao Ren was exasperated. Anyway, it was better than being called Fuma.\u201cGongzi Hao,\u201d Premier Xia said cautiously. Seeing Hao Ren was not displeased with it, he continued carefully, \u201cI heard that the mortal world is now full of houses built with stones, and they are hundreds of meters tall. Is that true?\u201dHao Ren was puzzled for a moment before it dawned on him that Premier Xia was referring to the skyscrapers. He chuckled and replied, \u201cYeah, people all live in the stone buildings now.\u201d\u201cAnd I heard that the mortals don\u2019t use carriages and horses anymore. Instead, they use iron and steel boxes which can move by themselves. Is that true?\u201d after some consideration, Premier Xia asked again cautiously.This time, Hao Ren couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cRight, people are swallowed in there, and they are spat out when they reach their destination.\u201dPremier Xia raised his head and thought hard for a second. \u201cThat must be some kinds of Demon Beast that have weak stomachs,\u201d he murmured.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHao Ren choked up with laughter.On a second thought, Premier Xia handled businesses all day long in the Dragon Palace and got all of his news from Elder Lu and Elder Sun. It was a pitiful life.\u201cIf Uncle Zhao, I mean the Dragon King, agrees, I will take you to the mortal world for a tour,\u201d Hao Ren said sympathetically.\u201cNo! No! I have my duties here!\u201d Premier Xia waved his hand, but he was grateful to the young Fuma for the offer.\u201cAfter touring the Ice Palace, Fuma will go back. He is kind and amiable, very unusual\u2026\u201d Premier Xia lamented silently and felt a bit reluctant about Hao Ren leaving.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedOn the way to the Ice Palace with Premier Xia, Hao Ren thought for a while before asking, \u201cPremier Xia, was Zi very rebellious when she was little?\u201dHearing the topic turning to Zhao Yanzi, Premier Xia answered respectfully, \u201cLittle Princess rarely comes to the Dragon Palace, and I don\u2019t see her often.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Hao Ren found it strange. \u201cDidn\u2019t Zi grow up in the Dragon Palace?\u201d he asked.\u201cLittle Princess was born on land and was under the guidance of Elder Sun and Elder Lu. I don\u2019t have the honor to see her often.\u201d\u201cSo Zi grew up in the mortal world? She is only 15, and I guess Zhao Guang kept her on the land because he doesn\u2019t want her to be uninformed about the era like Premier Xia,\u201d at this thought, Hao Ren asked again, \u201cDid Su Han grow up in the Dragon Palace?\u201d\u201cFuma\u2026 Gongzi Hao, do you mean Su Han, the Inspector?\u201d Premier Xia nodded and said, \u201cAn Elder of East Ocean adopted her, and this elder taught her cultivation techniques and nurtured her. She left the Dragon Palace when she was 15 years old.\u201dHe added, \u201cSu Han has a rare Metal Water Body Type and is a cultivation genius that was rarely seen even in the past 1,000 years. Her cultivation progress was so fast that she became a Kun-level cultivator when she was only 15. After leaving the East Ocean Dragon Palace, she joined the system of Inspectors and is now in charge of the East Ocean area.\u201d\u201cShe doesn\u2019t come to the Dragon Palace often, does she?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cTechnically speaking, she is not a member of the East Ocean Dragon Clan, but she has the right to patrol the area as an Inspector. However, due to her special relationship with the East Ocean Dagon Clan, she rarely interferes with our business and comes back occasionally to visit her master,\u201d Premier Xia answered.\u201cMetal Water Body Type \u2026 I wonder what body type I have,\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cGongzi Hao, you have a mortal body which is supposed to be a chaotic Five-Element Body Type. However, you have been cultivating the Spirit Concentration Scroll for a while, and Little Princess\u2019 Dragon Core is inside your body. It should gradually turn into a smooth Water Body Type,\u201d Premier Xia explained to him patiently.\u201cCompared with Su Han, is my body type inferior?\u201d Hao Ren continued to ask.\u201cHehe, you are a mortal and thus have been born with a poor body type. However, you can\u2019t rush your cultivation,\u201d Premier Xia comforted him.Hao Ren agreed silently. Su Han was born with a rare body type, and she has been cultivating very hard, which was why she had reached her current realm.\u201cAs for me, I don\u2019t expect to be unrivaled. As long as I can save myself and protect the people close to me, I\u2019m content,\u201d he thought.While they walked, their conversation centered on cultivation. Although Premier Xia\u2019s ideas about the mortal world were hundreds of years behind reality, he was a great cultivator.His patient explanations answered several questions Hao Ren had with the cultivation of the Spirit Concentration Scroll.\u201cFuma has quite a different personality compared to the Little Princess. He is smart, curious, calm, and not ashamed to ask questions\u2026\u201d Premier Xia thought to himself while he answered Hao Ren\u2019s questions.They finally came to the Ice Palace.In fact, after the long walk and talking with Premier Xia, Hao Ren had lost interest in the Ice Palace. However, he didn\u2019t want to disappoint Premier Xia, so he followed the latter inside.The Ice Palace was also known as the ice warehouse which was a world of ice and snow. It was quiet and cold inside.While Hao Ren walked around in there, he wondered if some of the Dragon King\u2019s past concubines were locked in the Ice Palace 1 .\u201cPremier Xia, how come there are no maids here?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cThe maids used to serve the Dragon King, Dragon Queen, and the Princess. Since they all live on land now, we don\u2019t need maids here. The only females here are the families of the elders who live in the Dragon Palace,\u201d Premier Xia explained.Windless, the Ice Palace was a bitterly cold place of snow. Hao Ren circulated Nature Essence in his body according to the Spirit Concentration Scroll to keep warm while he looked at the many natural treasures stored in huge ice blocks that were two to three meters high.Since he knew nothing about the natural treasures, he felt like a curious tourist.As he was walking in the Ice Palace, he spotted a set of beautiful ancient female clothes stored in one ice block. He was about to pass it when he sensed something unusual about it. He paused and looked again.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d mustering his courage, Hao Ren asked Premier Xia.\u201cShe is an Immortal Maid sent from the Above Realm. It\u2019s said that she came down to the mortal world without permission and was discovered by an Inspector. She was sent to the Ice Palace in the East Ocean Dragon Palace for a 200-year imprisonment as a punishment,\u201d Premier Xia said.While they were talking, a rustling sound came from behind the ice block near them.\u201cWho is it?\u201d alarmed, Hao Ren, who had an excellent hearing, yelled immediately.A sad and timid-looking girl appeared from behind a huge ice block. She kneeled in front of Premier Xia and said, \u201cGreetings to Premier Xia.\u201dShe looked delicate and charming and was wearing a thin blue dress in this cold, snowy place.\u201cShe is the younger sister of the Immortal Maid imprisoned in the ice block. She came to take care of her older sister,\u201d Premier Xia whispered in Hao Ren\u2019s ear.Hao Ren looked at her and then at the girl in the ice block and found that they looked identical.\u201cMore than 200 years?\u201d Hao Ren caught the keywords and asked, \u201cDoes it mean that the punishment is over?\u201cI suppose so. But since we haven\u2019t received any new messages about it from the Above Realm, she is still imprisoned here.\u201d\u201cThey were just two ordinary maids in the Above Realm. I guess no one recalls the 200-year punishment anymore,\u201d Hao Ren thought, \u201cThere is another realm above the Dragon Palace? That is interesting.\u201d\u201cSince she has finished her time, why don\u2019t you release her?\u201d Hao Ren suggested.\u201cSince Fuma suggested it, I will send a message to the Above Realm in a couple of days. If they have no further instructions, I will release them,\u201d Premier Xia said.Hearing Premier Xia\u2019s words, the eyes of the girl, who was standing nearby, lit up.Hao Ren turned his head and glanced at her. He didn\u2019t know what to say, so he turned to the gate of the Cold Palace and suggested, \u201cWell, I should head back now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the Dragon King,\u201d Premier Xia followed him closely. He didn\u2019t care about the two Immortal Maids, but he would do it as a favor for Hao Ren.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIs the Above Realm you mention the Heavenly Realm?\u201d Hao Ren asked Premier Xia as they walked out of the Ice Palace.\u201cThe Above Realm refers to the cultivators living above the clouds. They are all powerful, but we Dragon Tribe have the numbers advantage. Overall, we are equal in terms of status. In the ancient times, there were Heavenly Immortals and Earthly Immortals. But now, all the Earthly Immortals had advanced into Heavenly Immortals and thus left all the earthly business to the Dragon Tribe,\u201d Premier Xia said.Hao Ren nodded and didn\u2019t follow that up with anything.When they returned to the main palace, Zhao Guang had finished his backlog of work and was having tea.\u201cLet\u2019s head back,\u201d seeing Hao Ren returning with Premier Xia, Zhao Guang stood up and said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But I must complete my duty,\u201d Premier Xia said while walking them out.He didn\u2019t stop until they were at the main gate of the Dragon Palace. \u201cI\u2019ll stop here. I wish Your Majesty and Fuma a safe journey!\u201dHao Ren turned to face Premier Xia and replied, \u201cPremier Xia, thank you for giving me the tour today. Goodbye!\u201d\u201cGoodbye?\u201d Premier Xia froze for a moment before he realized that the Fuma was saying farewell to him.He was so grateful for Hao Ren\u2019s simple farewell that he stared at Hao Ren and was at a loss for words.\u201cFollow me,\u201d Zhao Guang walked into the protection array formation and said, \u201cThree to the left, one forward, six to the right.\u201dHe started to give Hao Ren instructions again.Hurriedly, Hao Ren took out the Water Repellent Bead and put it in his mouth. He followed Zhao Guang closely and cautiously.Standing at the gate of the palace, Premier Xia looked at the back of Hao Ren with tears in his eyes. \u201cWhat a virtuous, considerate, and kind Fuma! I wonder when I will see him again,\u201d he thought.In the vast ocean, Zhao Guang strolled forward while Hao Ren followed him anxiously as if he was in an English Listening Test for the College Entrance Examination. He was afraid of mishearing Zhao Guang\u2019s instructions and misstepping due to his nervousness.They continued to walk for more than ten minutes before they were out of the array formation. Although Hao Ren had the Water Repellent Bead in his mouth, his clothes were soaked, not by sea water but by his sweat.After they went back on land, Hao Ren spat out the bead and felt a bitter taste in his mouth. By now, the sky had turned dark, and the only illumination was the moonlight reflecting on the surface of the sea.Hao Ren took out his cell phone and saw it was already ten o\u2019clock. Although the legend said, \u201cOne day in the Dragon Palace equals one year on land,\u201d it wasn\u2019t the case here. However, the time had indeed passed quickly.Zhao Guang went over to start his car, and Hao Ren cleaned the bead and said to him, \u201cUncle, here\u2019s the bead you loaned me.\u201d\u201cYou can keep it,\u201d Zhao Guang started the car and said, \u201cGet in the car. It\u2019s already late; you can stay the night at our home and go directly to school tomorrow.\u201dConsidering that Grandma and his parents had probably all gone to bed, Hao Ren nodded and replied, \u201cThank you, Uncle.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think of the trip?\u201d on the way back home, Zhao Guang asked Hao Ren.\u201cVery different from what I had imagined,\u201d Hao Ren answered.\u201cHehe. I go back to the Dragon Palace once every month to deal with the backlog of work. Today, I took you with me, so you could look around. Although we don\u2019t live there, the Dragon Palace is an important place for us,\u201d Zhao Guang said.Hao Ren nodded. He suddenly thought of the incident in the Ice Palace and asked, \u201cToday when I toured the Ice Palace with Premier Xia, I saw an Immortal Maid being imprisoned in an ice block. Did you know about it?\u201d\u201cI did. She is an Immortal Maid sent down from the Above Realm 200 years ago. Now that I think of it, the imprisonment time has come to an end by now.\u201d\u201cI asked Premier Xia to release her,\u201d Hao Ren said.To Hao Ren\u2019s surprise, Zhao Guang was calm. \u201cShe is just an Immortal Maid who made a mistake. It is no big deal that we release her. After all, we can\u2019t imprison her in the Dragon Palace forever,\u201d he said.Zhao Guang wouldn\u2019t deny his son-in-law this little authority and didn\u2019t blame Hao Ren for his interference. Besides, he knew Premier Xia, a cautious man, would handle this issue well.Hao Ren was relieved because he had been afraid that Zhao Guang would scold him for deciding without consulting with him.The car drove steadily on the highway. Shortly after, they returned home.It was already 11 o\u2019clock.Zhao Hongyu heard the car and came downstairs in her pajamas to greet them.\u201cYou are back together! Are you hungry?\u201d she asked with concern.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Hao Ren shook his head and replied. Having eaten two small red fruits, he was still full. However, he felt a bit tired after walking around for a long time.\u201cI\u2019m not hungry either. Let\u2019s call it a day,\u201d Zhao Guang took off his jacket and said tiredly. He had spent the whole day working in the Dragon Palace and was exhausted.Now, Hao Ren understood why Zhao Yanzi was not eager to go back to the Dragon Palace. After all, it was not a gigantic place, and it was always midnight when the trip ended. She didn\u2019t like that.\u201cYou stay the night in Zi\u2019s room. I need to work on some of my designs tonight in the studio,\u201d Zhao Hongyu said to Hao Ren. Tonight, she had her hair up.\u201cCan I sleep in the room my grandma used?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cSince your grandma won\u2019t come back soon, I sprayed some bug repellent in that room. It\u2019s not suitable for living right now,\u201d Zhao Hongyu explained with a smile.\u201cThen I\u2026\u201d Hao Ren stopped speaking when Zhao Hongyu began to tug him upstairs. They stopped at Zhao Yanzi\u2019s door and knocked.\u201cGoing to sleep now!\u201d Zhao Yanzi\u2019s yell came from inside the room.\u201cNaughty girl!\u201d Zhao Hongyu took out a key and unlocked the door. Sure enough, Zhao Yanzi, in her pink pajamas and a casual ponytail, was crouching in her chair playing games on the computer.She turned and was displeased at the sight of Hao Ren. \u201cWhy are you here?!\u201d she yelled.\u201cRen will sleep in your room tonight. Stop playing games and go to bed now!\u201d Zhao Hongyu said as she dragged Hao Ren into the room. She took out beddings from the wardrobe and placed them on the rug before Zhao Yanzi\u2019s bed.\u201cMom!\u201d seeing her mom putting Hao Ren into her room for the night without consulting her, Zhao Yanzi yelled in protest.\u201cDon\u2019t yell. I need the studio in the attic tonight, and I sprayed bug repellent in Grandma\u2019s room. Plus, the living room is too cold for sleeping. He has to stay in your room for the night,\u201d ignoring Zhao Yanzi\u2019s protest, Zhao Hongyu spread out the bedding and said to Hao Ren, \u201cRen, go to bed soon.\u201d\u201cThank you, Auntie,\u201d Hao Ren said sincerely.\u201cIf Zi disturbs your rest, come to me,\u201d with that, Zhao Hongyu walked out of the room and shut the door.\u201cYou!\u201d the moment Zhao Hongyu left the room, Zhao Yanzi jumped from her chair and yelled, \u201cYou did this on purpose!\u201dHao Ren felt wronged since he had meant to stay the night in the room his grandma had used, and that was why he came back with Zhao Guang. He had not expected that the room Grandma stayed in would be unavailable due to being sprayed with bug repellent.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, he didn\u2019t want to explain to Zhao Yanzi.After he unbuttoned his jacket, he walked toward the bathroom.Seeing his familiarity with her room, Zhao Yanzi was even angrier. \u201cI forbid you from living in my room!\u201d she yelled again.\u201cGo to bed early. Staying up late playing games and waking up late in the morning is bad for you. You have school tomorrow!\u201d Hao Ren turned and lectured her.\u201cYou have no right to lecture me!\u201d enraged, Zhao Yanzi picked up a pillow and threw it at Hao Ren.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead of throwing it back to Zhao Yanzi, he took it with him into the bathroom.\u201cHey!\u201d Zhao Yanzi yelled, but Hao Ren was already in the bathroom and had locked the door.In the bathroom, Hao Ren took off his clothes and hummed to himself while taking a shower.Hearing Hao Ren humming in the shower, Zhao Yanzi burned with rage.Hao Ren didn\u2019t mean to anger her. However, her unfriendly manner made him want to retaliate. After all, she had never uttered a \u201cthank you\u201d in the long period he had been tutoring her.The shower washed away his fatigue. After putting his clothes back on, he walked out of the bathroom and found Zhao Yanzi standing at the door; she was livid.\u201cI will go to bed now,\u201d Hao Ren said lightly. With the pillow in his hand, he walked sideways past her.Zhao Yanzi curled her lips furiously, looking like a little tiger that was about to attack.Hao Ren walked to the computer desk and put the pillow on the chair before crawling into the bedding at the foot of the bed.Click! Zhao Yanzi entered the bathroom before pulled the sliding door shut.The bedding was soft and warm; Hao Ren felt quite cozy in there after a day of walking.In the bathroom, the shower was turned on.Concealed behind the sliding door, the bathroom didn\u2019t have a frosted glass door so that nothing could be seen at all.Lying in the bedding on the floor, Hao Ren looked up at the blue ceiling decorated with stars and listened to the shower water in the bathroom. His thoughts were tangled and indistinct.Bang! The bathroom door opened, and Zhao Yanzi in her cute pajamas walked out.With her fragrance, soft skin, and damp black hair, she looked like a cupcake that had just come out of the oven.Since the day was warm, she was wearing a short-sleeved top and a pair of shorts, exposing her slim limbs.Seeing her coming out, Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to bicker with her, so he closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.Thud! Thud\u2026 Zhao Yanzi walked toward her bed and was close to where Hao Ren was sleeping.Hao Ren regulated his breathing and pretended that he was buried in sleep.Then, he felt a soft foot stepping hard on his belly!\u201cAuch!\u201d rubbing his belly, Hao Ren\u2019s eyes popped open.Pretending nothing had happened, Zhao Yanzi climbed onto her pink bed and into her soft quilt.Hao Ren decided to let it go, and he turned on his side.After half an hour, it was quiet in the room except for the humming sound of the air conditioner.Hao Ren had begun to doze off when he suddenly heard Zhao Yanzi getting out of the bed.Alarmed, he opened his eyes and observed her movements cautiously.She stood up from the bed.Her smooth and white legs were flawless. Seeing her walking on the rug barefooted, Hao Ren found it a little\u2026 sexy?Walking to the desk, she gulped down a glass of water. Afterward, she went back to her bed.Seeming to have sensed Hao Ren\u2019s eyes on her lower legs, Zhao Yanzi slowed her steps when she was about to step over Hao Ren.An exquisite jade-like small foot lowered slowly.\u201cOuch!\u201d Hao Ren yelled again, bolting up.\u201cSorry for stepping on you,\u201d with these casual words, she climbed back into her bed.Rubbing the crook of his left arm, Hao Ren considered confronting her. However, on the second thought, he decided not to, thinking it was futile to argue with a little girl.Zhao Yanzi slid under her quilt, and a word floated out of her mouth, \u201cPervert!\u201dHao Ren couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. He turned to face her immediately and asked, \u201cWhy did you call me a pervert?!\u201dZhao Yanzi snorted and rolled the quilt tightly around herself before turning to the wall, leaving the back of her head to Hao Ren.In the cocoon-like quilt, only her head and lower legs were exposed to enjoy the cold air from the air conditioner.It seemed to be her usual sleeping position.Looking at the round back of her head and the slim and white lower legs extending out from the quilt, Hao Ren thought, \u201cYour legs are not so pretty after all.\u201dHe didn\u2019t say it out loud since he knew her bad temper and didn\u2019t want to see her explode with rage.The room was quiet again except for the humming sounds of the air conditioner.Zhao Yanzi didn\u2019t turn off the lights. Apparently, she had a habit of sleeping with lights on. Hao Ren lay on his side and looked at the soft skin on her lower legs. It was the first time he had stayed in a girl\u2019s room, and he couldn\u2019t sleep.After a while, Zhao Yanzi suddenly turned around.Hao Ren closed his eyelid immediately and watched her movements through his squinted eyes.She glared at Hao Ren. After a moment of consideration, she poked out her leg and wanted to kick Hao Ren in the chest.However, Hao Ren was prepared. The moment her foot touched his chest, his hand shot out and caught it; it was slim and smooth like an eel. Hao Ren gripped her ankle and didn\u2019t let it go.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Zhao Yanzi struggled futilely, and she flew into a rage. \u201cJerk!\u201d she shouted.However, her shout sounded weak when her ankle in Hao Ren\u2019s firm grip.Hao Ren saw her face flush red and thought, \u201cWell, you tried to sneak-attack me. Now, I just won\u2019t let go. What can you do?\u201dThe more she struggled with her leg, the cuter she looked.\u201cJerk! Let go!\u201d seeing Hao Ren had no intention of letting go, she decided to act as the victim and yelled, \u201cMom! He is bullying me! Help!\u201dWhile she yelled and struggled, she shook the bed and made it creak.Zhao Hongyu, who was drawing designs in the attic, heard the commotion in Zhao Yanzi\u2019s room. She shook her head in exasperation and continued working.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cRape! Rape!\u201d flustered and utterly frustrated, Zhao Yanzi yelled more blatant accusations.In the bedroom next to hers, Zhao Guang picked up the earplugs from the bedside table and plugged up his ears. He turned and resumed sleeping.They didn\u2019t quiet down until two o\u2019clock in the morning.When Zhao Hongyu opened the door and called them to breakfast the second day, she found Hao Ren sleeping on his back with rows of bite-marks on his arm. Zhao Yanzi was also sound asleep with the quilt tugged tightly around her body. Her lower legs, sticking out of her quilt, were covered in long white socks.Zhao Hongyu couldn\u2019t help grinning at this scene and decided not to arrange them to sleep in the same room again in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For one, his school was not on the way, and he didn\u2019t want Zhao Guang to detour; secondly, the Ferrari would attract too much attention, so he didn\u2019t want to get a ride from Zhao Hongyu, either.On the bus, he rolled up his sleeves and studied the bite marks on his arm. He recalled the look on Zhao Yanzi\u2019s face when she finally freed her feet, jumped onto him, and showed her teeth while biting him frantically. Hao Ren found it aggravating and hilarious at the same time.When Bus 767 stopped in front of the main entrance of the university, Hao Ren got off and headed towards the southern dormitory.At this exact hour, most students who had morning classes were crawling out of bed. As a result, the entire dorm building was filled with clanking noises made by the clashing of toothbrushes and mugs.As he was on his way to the Dorm Building No. 7 and just when he was about to turn at a corner, he heard Ma Lina and Liu Yan\u2019s voices. Ma Lina and Liu Yan were in the same class as Hao Ren. In their conversation, Hao Ren seemed to hear them mentioning Xie Yujia.He looked around and found Ma Lina and Liu Yan on the other side of the road. They were walking towards the south gate while talking amongst themselves; they did not notice Hao Ren.Judging from the look of it, they planned to have an early breakfast, so they could get to class early and grab the seats they wanted.After obtaining a breakthrough to the second level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll, Hao Ren\u2019s hearing had become sharper than ever. As he focused, he was able to hear their conversation.\u201cXie Yujia has been close with Hao Ren lately. I bet that is because she thinks he\u2019s from an affluent family,\u201d Liu Yan asserted as she walked alongside Ma Lina.\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense. Xie Yujia is my roommate, and I know all about her. I don\u2019t think she is that kind of person. We used to stay up all night and chat. Even back then, she had often said that Hao Ren is a decent guy,\u201d Ma Lina clarified.\u201cOh, so Xie Yujia has always had a crush on Hao Ren?\u201d Liu Yan became interested.Ma Lina shook her head and replied, \u201cNot really. She was only saying that he is a good guy. I don\u2019t think she meant anything else besides that.\u201d\u201cTsk, doesn\u2019t that prove what I just said?\u201d Liu Yan curled her lips and continued, \u201cShe didn\u2019t like him before, but now, she knows that Hao Ren\u2019s family is rich, so she became close to him.\u201d\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t think Xie Yujia is that kind of person,\u201d Ma Lina continued to defend Xie Yujia, \u201cBesides, didn\u2019t Wang Jia and the others conclude that Hao Ren is only from an ordinary family after their investigation? The fancy cars that came to pick him up were all sent by the family of the pretty little girl whom he is tutoring. Wang Jia was the most excited when the Benz and the Lincoln showed up to pick up Hao Ren, and she kept saying that she was going to pursue him. Yet, after she found out that the cars did not belong to Hao Ren\u2019s family, she cooled down instantly, didn\u2019t she?\u201dAfter listening to their conversation, Hao Ren was able to have a glimpse of how he was seen in the girls\u2019 eyes.\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Liu Yan nodded, \u201cKnowing the kind of girl Wang Jia is and how she made no moves after she found out about Hao Ren\u2019s real background, there is no reason for Xie Yujia to be oblivious to the fact that Hao Ren is from an ordinary family.\u201d\u201cRight, and I think Xie Yujia is a good person. The only thing is that she studies too hard and takes things too seriously, but she is definitely not the superficial type like Wang Jia\u2026\u201dAs they were talking, they had walked away. Even with Hao Ren\u2019s keen hearing, he could not make out what they were saying anymore.\u201cXie Yujia is seen as superficial by some girls all because she has been close to me lately. Ay, people sure will talk\u2026\u201d Hao Ren thought quietly.Looking at the time, Hao Ren realized that Xie Yujia might come out of the girls\u2019 dormitory and ride her bike to class at any moment. Hence, he sped up and entered his dorm building at once; he was afraid to run into Xie Yujia here and now.At this time, Zhao Jiayi and the other two were causing a commotion as they were freshening up by the sink in the public washroom; Hao Ren could hear their jeering from the staircase.\u201cThese guys\u2026\u201d Hao Ren went into their dorm room, grabbed his toothbrush and mug, and got into the washroom.\u201cHoly sh*t! You just came in!? We were hoping we could play cards together with you yesterday!\u201d Hao Ren\u2019s appearance caused them to make an even bigger uproar.\u201cBe honest, what did you do this weekend? Since your face is glowing, I bet you were with some pretty girls!\u201d with a towel on his shoulder, Zhou Liren walked over and wrapped his arm around Hao Ren\u2019s neck.Watching the noisy bunch fooling around, Hao Ren\u2019s mood was instantly lightened.\u201cIf I told you guys that I went for a tour of the Dragon Palace on the weekend, I don\u2019t think you would believe me,\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.After the four finished freshening up, they gathered their books and started walking down the stairs side by side.When they got out of the dorm building, they found Xie Yujia, who was in a relaxed plaid shirt, waiting outside.In her hands, there was an immaculately clean jacket; the one Hao Ren lent her on Friday.\u201cThanks for the jacket on Friday. I\u2019ve washed and dried it for you,\u201d she candidly stated as she walked up and handed the jacket to Hao Ren.\u201cUh, oh!\u201d standing next to Hao Ren, Zhou Liren began jeering untactfully and had his mouth covered by Zhao Jiayi\u2019s hand immediately.However, it was enough for Xie Yujia to feel embarrassed. Blushed, she hopped onto her bike and paddled away.\u201cXie Yujia is actually quite cute,\u201d Cao Ronghua concluded as they watched Xie Yujia disappeared into afar.Hao Ren was speechless as he held his jacket in hand. In truth, he had long forgotten about lending his jacket to Xie Yujia.\u201cLooks like you might have a chance, go for it!\u201d Zhao Jiayi said as he subtly elbowed Hao Ren.\u201cShe was just here to return a jacket, is it really worth making a big fuss about!?\u201d Hao Ren gave the others a hard stare and crisply put the jacket on. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go get food in the cafeteria!\u201d he said.\u201cRen, since you seem to be having amazing luck with the ladies, breakfast should be on you!\u201d Zhou Liren shouted as he ran after Hao Ren.\u201cYou bastard! All you ever think about is food! Fine, I will pay!\u201d Hao Ren responded loudly.After they finished eating, they went straight to class. At ten o\u2019clock, their morning class ended, and they had two hours in between until their next class which was to start at 12.The group was indecisive about how to spend their time. They were torn between going to the Internet Cafe or going back to the dorm to play cards. Since their lunchtime also needed to be taken into consideration, they found the two hours to be less than sufficient to travel back and forth.\u201cApparently, the Rock Climbing Club is very popular among girls, and they are all wearing attractive sportswear. The Rock Climbing Club is recruiting today; I bet there will be a lot of beautiful girls joining, why don\u2019t we go take a look?\u201d Zhou Liren suggested on a whim.\u201cRock climbing? Isn\u2019t that Huang Xujie\u2019s turf?\u201d Zhao Jiayi said.\u201cWhat are you afraid of, Zhao Jiayi? Isn\u2019t your family so powerful that even the players on the basketball team had to offer you compensation and apologies!? Let\u2019s go take a look, Huang Xujie won\u2019t dare to do anything to us,\u201d Zhou Liren insisted.Zhao Jiayi rolled his eyes at Zhou Liren\u2019s remark. After he thought about it, he agreed, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go check it out. Hopefully, it will be worth spending an hour there, so we can go for lunch by the time we come back. Ren, let\u2019s go together!\u201d\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go!\u201d Hao Ren nodded.\u201cWe are just going to take a look. Even if Huang Xujie is there in person, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll cause a scene!\u201d Hao Ren thought.\u201cLet\u2019s not get Yu Rong and the others, just us four!\u201d Zhou Liren said suggestively as if the more people he went with, the fewer glances he could steal from the pretty girls.As they finally settled on a decision, the four grabbed their belongings and hurried towards the Sports Stadium.When they arrived at the outdoor public square outside of the Sports Stadium, they found that there were already over 100 people swarming the area.Moreover, Yu Rong and the others were also in the crowd. They were standing on tiptoes and craning their necks forward.\u201cDamn, they came to see pretty girls without telling us!\u201d Zhou Liren exclaimed as he was irked by the sight of Yu Rong and the others.Zhou Liren\u2019s unabashed manner had made Hao Ren feel a loss for words.Brushing Hao Ren with his elbow while curling his lips, Zhao Jiayi signaled Hao Ren to pay attention to the other side of the crowd.As Hao Ren looked over to the hinted direction, He saw Xie Yujia, Ma Lina, and a few other girls in the crowd.At this time, Cao Ronghua pointed in a different direction while poking Hao Ren.Hao Ren turned and found that the strong-built giant-like Xie Wanjun was also among the crowd. His height, which was over two meters, had made him stand out like a towering monument in the flood of people.Hao Ren felt a hint of contempt toward Xie Wanjun, who was usually extremely occupied, for showing up here. Hao Ren knew he was right about the fact that the basketball team and the Rock Climbing Club were birds of the same flock.Now, Xie Yujia was glancing over at Hao Ren as she had also noticed his presence. Yet, when she saw that Hao Ren was staring straight at her older brother, her heart sank a little.Seeing that more and more students had finished class and were rushing to join the crowd from all directions, Huang Xujie spoke through a bullhorn while standing next to the rock climbing wall, \u201cToday is the recruitment day for the Rock Climbing Club. Our club is the biggest club at East Ocean University and currently consists of over 300 male members and 200 female members. Those who have joined our club are all sports lovers. The Rock Climbing Club not only provides indoor and outdoor training at the Sports Stadium but also sometimes organizes trips to the wild. In addition, the equipment that you purchase from us is guaranteed to be priced lower than those you will find in the sports shops out there\u2026\u201dHis voice was sonorous, and his tone was mild and gentle. Moreover, he was good-looking and confident. If one only knew him on the surface, they would surely take him as a polite, friendly, and poised senior student.However, Hao Ren knew very well how proud and arrogant Huang Xujie was and how he lost his temper when he lost the race to Hao Ren.Even though many uninformed junior students were tempted by the list of benefits the Rock Climbing Club had promised, none had hastily gone over to sign up.\u201cHaha, there is no rush. We will first showcase our Rock Climbing Club today,\u201d Huang Xujie handed the bullhorn over to a skinny, dark-skinned male student next to him while giving him a look.That guy held up the bullhorn and continued, \u201cI am Lu Bo, the Assistant Captain of the Rock Climbing Club. Now, I will demonstrate to you some of the techniques required for rock climbing.\u201dNext, while holding the bullhorn, he began explaining and putting on the different types of gear needed for the climb. After, he moved to the bottom of the rock climbing wall and put down the bullhorn. He then raised the volume of his voice and used his limbs to demonstrate the proper climbing positions.Many of the students who had no experience with rock climbing became intrigued and were paying attention closely.However, Zhou Liren was becoming impatient, \u201cWhere are the pretty girls\u2026\u201d he murmured.Clap! Clap! Clap! Suddenly, Huang Xujie clapped his hands.Following his clapping, four beautiful girls who were wearing athletic gears came out from behind the rock climbing wall. Instantly, their elegant figures and charming faces had stunned and dazzled all the male students.\u201cNow, four of our members will take over and demonstrate the process of a climb to you, from start to finish,\u201d Huang Xujie picked up the bullhorn once again.As the beautiful girls appeared, everyone\u2019s eyes had lit up. At this time, Hao Ren discovered that Lin Li, who was wearing athletic wear, had also joined the Rock Climbing Club.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cShe joined, too\u2026 But that is no surprise. Since Lin Li is after Huang Xujie, it gives her more reasons to join the Rock Climbing Club that is run by Huang Xujie. Likewise, Huang Xujie needs to pull in as many beautiful girls as possible to help him attract other students; there is no reason for him to reject her application, either.\u201d Hao Ren thought.On the rock climbing wall, the four beautiful girls utilized all of their bodies. After their safety was ensured by their harnesses and ropes, they grasped onto the colorful rocks and began moving up.Gradually, they had climbed up so high that the student audience had to stretch their necks considerably to see them.\u201cThis is really nice\u2026\u201d admiring the display of the beautiful girls\u2019 youthful postures, Zhou Liren let out sighs of satisfaction as he eyed every inch of their bodies\u201cUsing beautiful girls as their marketing strategy, I wonder how many male students are going to fall for that\u2026\u201d Hao Ren pondered as he observed the agile and athletic beauties.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedOne by one, the beautiful girls reached the top of the wall. Then, they descended by sliding down on the ropes. The exquisite curves of their bodies, their confidence, and their demeanors had convinced the girls that rock climbing could help them lose weight. Also, they made the guys believe that they could strengthen their bodies and have a chance with the beautiful girls in the club.The previously hesitant students had made up their minds and rushed to sign themselves up.\u201cDid they hire these girls from outside the school?\u201d Cao Ronghua was suspicious.Hao Ren shook his head as he disagreed. Although he disliked Huang Xujie, he believed that Huang Xujie could easily charm some beautiful girls into joining his club.After, four other beautiful girls appeared, climbed up the wall, and came down. Following that, another group of four did the same thing. With three rounds of sexy girls taking the stage, the male students surely had their eyes well-feasted.Now that the girls had finished their performance, Huang Xujie arranged for their muscular male members to demonstrate accelerated rock climbing. Their vigorous postures and agile movements had further convinced their male audience that rock climbing could help them become sharp and robust.\u201cTo join our club, you have first to pay a 200 yuan registration fee. After the orientation next week, you will join us for group training\u2026\u201d Huang Xujie announced through the bullhorn while arranging other members to help students register.\u201cAfter signing up for his club, group training costs 100 yuan. Then, there is the official training where formal gears need to be purchased; it would further cost 200 to 300 yuan. If you decide to quit, the registration fee and training fee won\u2019t be refunded\u2026\u201d knowing the procedures involved, Zhao Jiayi quietly explained to Hao Ren.\u201cBy such means, no wonder the Rock Climbing Club has become the biggest club at East Ocean University,\u201d Hao Ren sneered, \u201cThe money that they collected from their members would become funds for the senior members to go on the so-called \u2018trips\u2019 and \u2018adventures\u2019.\u201dApparently, this club\u2019s bullying behaviors had been reported to the school before. However, as Huang Xujie was the son of the Deputy Mayor and disputes involving clubs could get very complicated, the school wanted nothing to do with it.Seeing that the students who wanted to sign up were almost all registered, Huang Xujie wanted to attract more. He spoke through the bullhorn once again, \u201cSince today is the recruitment day for our club, we would make an exception and allow students who are not members of our club to try climbing this wall. Normally, this wall is usually off limits to anyone outside the club.\u201dHe added, \u201cOf course, we are going to make it a little challenging. Only the 10-meter wall was used in the previous performances; if you would like to try the wall, you will have to climb this 15-meter wall. The first person to reach the top will be rewarded with this amazing set of gears!\u201dHuang Xujie pointed at the set of black sports gears of a famous brand that was placed neatly on the table behind him.The announcement had greatly excited the male students. Yet, no one was willing to be the first one to try. After all, a lot of female students were in the audience, and so many beautiful girls were present. Recklessly going forward might result in extreme embarrassment if they failed to perform.The 15-meter wall was the standard for rock climbing competitions. For people who had never been trained in rock climbing, it was impossible for them to obtain the reward.In addition, the holds from the bottom to the top were few and far between. Therefore, the difficulty level was incredibly high.Actually, Zhou Liren wanted to try. Nonetheless, he knew that although he had a body that was tall and thick, it was still a body of a nerd. After careful consideration, he finally decided to give up.On the other hand, Zhao Jiayi, who had the best physique and was the most interested in sports of the four, had now become eager.At this time, Yu Rong and the others had noticed Zhao Jiayi. Seeing that Zhao Jiayi was full of excitement and was rubbing his hands together, they immediately began egging him on, \u201cGo, Zhao Jiayi!\u201dSince those guys were all good friends with Zhao Jiayi, they started jeering together.Feeling acclaimed by his friends, Zhao Jiayi could only step up and walk towards the wall. \u201cAlright! Let me try!\u201d he said.As Zhao Jiayi walked forward, Huang Xujie recognized him; he knew this guy was one of Hao Ren\u2019s friends and felt slightly agitated. Yet, he suppressed his negative feelings and pretended to be encouraging, \u201cGreat, let\u2019s applaud the courage of our first warrior!\u201dThe crowd gave a round of scattered applause. In fact, the crowd was very skeptical about Zhao Jiayi reaching the top as he was not very tall.Promptly, Lu Bo, the Assistant Captain of the Rock Climbing Club began helping Zhao Jiayi put on all the safety gears. Then, he guided him to the bottom of the 15-meter wall.In that instant, all eyes were on Zhao Jiayi.Standing there, Zhao Jiayi took a deep breath and looked up at the sparse colored climbing holds. Then, he lifted his right foot and stepped onto the first hold while grabbing the other holds with both of his hands. He began ascending.\u201cYou can do it, Zhao Jiayi!\u201d Yu Rong cheered loudly.Following Yu Rong, the other guys in their class also started yelling out random cheers.Soon, Zhao Jiayi had already climbed one-third of the wall and was 5 meters up on the wall. He turned and waved at Yu Rong and the others confidently.Yet, the most challenging part about rock climbing was that the higher on the wall, the more difficult it was. It was not only due to physical exhaustion but also the fact that the design and placement of the holds became very tricky as the climber got close to the top.As Zhao Jiayi was not tall nor had elongated limbs, and the holds were becoming farther and farther apart from one another, he was having problems grab onto them.Thump! Zhao Jiayi made a small jump in the air, grabbed onto a hold with his right hand and quickly moved his left foot to another hold.Phew\u2026 He hung onto the rock wall and let out a deep sigh of relief.By then, five minutes had passed. Hao Ren, Xie Yujia, and the others who were watching with their heads up were filled with worries.On the other hand, Huang Xujie, who was standing by the table, was shocked to see Zhao Jiayi, who had never received any systemic training, climb so high. He thought Zhao Jiayi must be a monster of some sort.\u201cWay to go, Zhao Jiayi!\u201d Originally, Yu Ron was hoping to see Zhao Jiayi fail so that he could tease him about it. But now, stretching his neck, he was just amazed at the fact that Zhao Jiayi had already climbed two-thirds of the wall.After briefly shaking his sore fingers and shoulders, Zhao Jiayi continued climbing up.Seeing that things were not going as he expected, Huang Xujie gave the Assistant Captain a meaningful glance.Now, Zhao Jiayi had climbed more than 10 meters high and had encountered a very challenging hold. Adjusting his breathing, he decided to try the same method; reaching the hold with the help of a small jump.Hao Ren also became nervous and was holding his breath. He always thought Zhao Jiayi was good at playing basketball but didn\u2019t know that he was gifted in other sports as well.Pop! Aiming right at the hold, Zhao Jiayi made his jump.Right at this moment, the rope that was hanging from the top of his head swayed a little!It was hard to maintain one\u2019s balance in mid-air in the first place, and this slight sway had caused Zhao Jiayi to lose his balance completely. His right hand was able to reach the hold, but it was unable to sustain the grip. As a result, he instantly lost support and fell from the wall!Moreover, for whatever reason, the rope that was supposed to support the climber did not start pulling in time.Seeing that things were not going well, Hao Ren dashed out of the crowd and sprinted forwards like a cheetah. He threw himself over and reached out his arms, attempting to catch Zhao Jiayi!Thud! While Zhao Jiayi was losing his wits from the 10-meter free fall, the rope that was attached to his harness finally began pulling!Even so, Zhao Jiayi was still falling. Right before he fell into Hao Ren\u2019s arms, the rope finally stabilized and reduced most of the impact from the fall!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDragging the rope, Zhao Jiayi was now standing on the ground, and his face was ghastly pale. Likewise, Xie Yujia who was at the front of the crowd and had witnessed the whole course of Zhao Jiayi\u2019s climb closely was covered with cold sweat; she was trying to calm her heart by placing her hands over it.With his eyesight sharper than ever, Hao Ren noticed the unusual movement of the rope; He knew something was wrong.Others might not be able to tell and thought that the rope was swaying because Zhao Jiayi had made a jump, but Hao Ren knew very well that the rope was tampered with!However, he had no evidence to prove it!Letting go of his arms which were supporting Zhao Jiayi\u2019s shoulders, Hao Ren turned to Huang Xujie. With rage fueling in his eyes, he raised his arm and declared, \u201cYou, let\u2019s have a match!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although Hao Ren challenged their captain, Lu Bo was careful with the safety preparation since it was a matter of life and death.With an angry expression, Hao Ren spread his arms for the harness silently. On the other side, several pretty girls from the club surrounded Huang Xujie and put the harness on him; that scene aroused jealousy in Zhou Liren.Xie Yujia, who was standing in the crowd, hesitated for several seconds before walking over.\u201cHao Ren, don\u2019t compete with him! It is too dangerous!\u201d she said.\u201cClass President, don\u2019t worry.

Since you never practiced before, you will put yourself in danger if you act rashly,\u201d Xie Yujia tried to dissuade him while shaking her head.She was concerned not only because Hao Ren was her classmate, but also\u2026\u201cXie Yujia, don\u2019t interfere. If his mental state is disturbed, there will be a higher probability of accidents occurring. If that happens, you may need to responsibility for the accident,\u201d Huang Xujie said to Xie Yujia while he buckled up his harness.His words sounded well-intentioned, but they made Xie Yujia more worried.She glanced at Hao Ren in concern and looked back at Yu Rong and his buddies, wishing they would join her efforts. But the truth was, the guys would never issue a challenge and then back out in fear. It would be too shameful for a man.\u201cClass President, just watch. I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Hao Ren was moved by Xie Yujia\u2019s concern for him, but he wasn\u2019t going to quit.He was still burning with rage.Feeling resigned, Xie Yujia looked back at Xie Wanjun who towered over the crowd. At the moment, her brother was watching the whole thing with an emotionless expression in silence.\u201cThe competition is about to begin. For safety reasons, everyone, please watch it from the outside of the site,\u201d Lu Bo walked over and ushered Xie Yujia out.Three belayers held Huang Xujie\u2019s safety rope, and Hao Ren got the same treatment.The competition was about to begin when Yu Rong suddenly rushed into the site and said, \u201cWe will act as the belayers! We don\u2019t trust you guys!\u201dYu Rong was quite influential among the guys. Several other buddies of Hao Ren followed suit and rushed in.After witnessing Zhao Jiayi\u2019s failure a moment ago, they lost trust in the members of the Rock Climbing Club. They\u2019d rather keep the rope in their own hands.Lu Bo had no choice but to walk over and show them how to control the rope and what to do when the climber falls. Finally, Yu Rong, Zhou Liren, and Huang Jianfeng who were the strongest among them were left on site to be Hao Ren\u2019s belayers while the rest were asked to watch outside.Then, Lu Bo walked to the rock climbing wall and raised his watch.\u201cReady! Go!\u201d he shouted.Hao Ren and Huang Xujie put their hands on the rock climbing wall at the same time and began climbing.In fact, with this level of rock climbing, a few seconds of difference at the beginning was not a big issue. The critical point was who could make it to the summit. Even if the competitors could all reach the top, there would be a difference of minutes between the first and the second place.On the 15-meter rock climbing wall, Hao Ren to the left of Huang Xujie, and they each chose their own route.Huang Xujie was very deft and climbed three meters shortly. Although the positions of the holds were changing due to different levels in difficulty, he, as the Captain of the Rock Climbing Club, was quite familiar with these holds and knew the best route to the top.He was wearing an orange mesh vest which exposed his chiseled muscles, and the girls watching shrieked at the sight.In contrast, Hao Ren was climbing steadily with his hands and feet tightly positioned on the holds firmly. He wasn\u2019t dressed professionally like Huang Xujie, but his steadiness and smart route choice made the students who didn\u2019t know him admire him a little.\u201cWho\u2019s this guy? He is quite bold to challenge the Captain of the Rock Climbing Club.\u201d\u201cHe is the buddy of the guy who just fell. I guess he is doing this for his buddy.\u201d\u201cHow can he defeat Huang Xujie who is the best climber in the Rock Climbing Club?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know that he is the guy who defeated Huang Xujie in the long-distance race in the school\u2019s Athletic Games?\u201dThe students in the crowd began to talk among themselves.Hearing the comments around her, Xie Yujia was so nervous as she observed Hao Ren that her fingernails cut into her palms, and her heart was in her throat.By now, Huang Xujie had climbed half of the distance while Hao Ren was only half a meter below him.Huang Xujie had slowed down. After each step, he would pause to rest for several seconds while leaning against the wall.In a rock climbing race of this level, one needed steadiness, excellent techniques, and sound mental fitness to reach the summit.Hao Ren continued climbing steadily; he would calculate his route before making several moves.\u201cThis guy\u2019s stamina is terrifyingly good,\u201d Huang Xujie thought as he looked down at Hao Ren who was only half a meter lower than him.From a professional viewpoint, Hao Ren\u2019s choices of holds were not excellent. They were energy-consuming and challenging to reach. Despite that, Hao Ren was still closely following him.\u201cHao Ren is really a monster,\u201d Huang Xujie\u2019s face turned grim at the thought.Looking up at the remaining eight meters, he inhaled deeply and resumed climbing cautiously. If he made a mistake and fell, the lucky second-year would win the competition.He had just grabbed another hold above him when Hao Ren suddenly signaled to his belayers that he was going down.\u201cHe has finally exhausted his strength,\u201d Huang Xujie was pleased when he saw that. He silently mocked, \u201cWell, you are just average. Even though you were lucky enough to win against me in the long-distance race, there\u2019s no way you can beat me in rock climbing!\u201dSeeing Hao Ren\u2019s hand gesture, Yu Rong and the other two belayers immediately slacked the rope and put Hao Ren down.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2019m not finished. You go on climbing,\u201d back on the ground, Hao Ren raised his head and yelled when he saw Huang Xujie\u2019s belayers also wanted to loosen the rope.Huang Xujie froze in surprise and thought, \u201cWhat the hell is this guy doing?\u201dHao Ren murmured some words and took the silver bracelets off his wrists. He bent down and put them on the ground.Carrying 50 kilograms on his arms while rock climbing was not an easy task. Besides, due to his bad mood, the burden on his arms seemed to have grown another 50 kilograms.As he swung his arms to relieve the tension, Hao Ren walked toward the wall once again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She walked out of the crowd again and said, \u201cHao Ren! Don\u2019t!\u201d\u201cClass President, I will be fine. The bracelets kept bumping into me, and I just have to take them off,\u201d Hao Ren smiled at her.Then, he took off his jacket and placed it in Xie Yujia\u2019s hands before turning to face the wall. He was up half a meter instantly.Xie Yujia was worried, but she knew she couldn\u2019t stop Hao Ren. Anxiously, she urged Yu Rong and the other two belayers, \u201cYou must hold the rope tight. You can\u2019t let him fall.\u201dTowering over the crowd, Xie Wanjun noted his sister\u2019s anxious expression. He then lowered his head and buried himself in deep thoughts.In the blink of an eye, Hao Ren was two meters up; he took the same route but had a faster speed.Everyone attributed his faster speed to his experience which saved him the time of thinking. No one knew that he had been climbing while carrying 100 kilograms on his arms.Huang Xujie looked down and saw Hao Ren climbing up again. He was both surprised and contemptuous. \u201cIdiot. Do you think your strength is inexhaustible? You will be grateful if you can cover half the height you did the last time,\u201d he thought.He turned to look at the girls who were looking up at him in admiration, and he put more strength in his grips and thought, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll show you the strength of the Captain of the Rock Climbing Club!\u201dWhile all that was going on Huang Xujie\u2019s head, Hao Ren was climbing up steadily, trying not to make mistakes. Ten minutes later, he was back at the same spot where he was last time.Meanwhile, Huang Xujie had just climbed up another three meters.The higher he climbed, the more difficult it got. The holds were sparsely positioned and thus were difficult to reach and grip.When Hao Ren was halfway up the first time, he had felt the sudden increase of difficulty, and that was why he decided to go back down to take off the Mount Tai Bracelets.The three meters Huang Xujie had covered were difficult, but the toughest part was the last three meters near the summit.Hao Ren inhaled deeply, looked up at the uneven and protruding rock wall and the randomly placed colorful holds, and reached out his hand. After he grasped one hold, he tried to pull himself up.Seeing Hao Ren gaining on him, Huang Xujie panicked slightly. He was horrified by Hao Ren\u2019s enormous strength.If he had known that Hao Ren had been previously climbing with 100 extra kilograms, he would have fallen with astonishment.Hao Ren was more cautious now. The last six meters required not only strength but technique as well.Everyone on the ground was watching the competition with their hearts in their throats. Even the emotionless Xie Wanjun was focusing his attention on the race happening on the 15-meter rock climbing wall.Hao Ren was gaining on Huang Xujie. His acute hearing picked up Huang Xujie\u2019s panting even though this guy was showing everyone his confident smile as if reaching the summit was just a piece of cake.Hao Ren looked up at the two holds above his head, not sure how to get to them. If he let go of one of his hands now, he would lose balance and fall backward. After all, the upper end of the rock wall had been designed to have a negative slope!\u201cWhatever!\u201d Hao Ren gritted his teeth, no longer caring about how Huang Xujie was planning to climb this part of the wall. He let go of one hand and immediately reached for another hold above him.Sure enough, the gravity pulled him down. His whole body fell backward, and his feet could no longer touch the rock wall. He was suddenly in the air!\u201cOh!\u201d the students on the ground all exclaimed in fear.Even with the safety rope, the precarious position over ten meters in the air was frightening to look at.Yu Rong and the other two belayers gasped and tightened their grip on the rope with all their strength.To their astonishment, with just one of his hands on a hold, Hao Ren dangled in the air; he didn\u2019t fall and didn\u2019t run out of strength!Xie Wanjun\u2019s eyes lit up at this scene.\u201cHe\u2019s finished.\u201d\u201cYeah. There\u2019s no way that he can go up.\u201d\u201cHe can\u2019t hold it any longer. He will fall very soon.\u201d\u201cWith all his weight on his fingers, he can only last a few seconds.\u201dWhile people were talking among themselves, Hao Ren suddenly bent his arm and began to pull himself up.The students watching gasped in astonishment.When he pulled himself up to the limit with one arm, Hao Ren abruptly reached for a higher hold with the other hand.\u201cWow!\u201d there was another wave of gasps.With both feet in the air, he climbed up with the sole strength of his upper body, one hold after another.No one made a sound because they were all stunned.\u201cWhat terrifying strength he has! He is pulling himself up with only his fingers and single arms!\u201d they thought to themselves.After covering the portion of the wall which had a negative slope, Hao Ren was now at the same height as Huang Xujie.Hao Ren was wearing a cheap white vest, and his muscles that were exposed were not sun-tanned or strong-looking. But in the eyes of Yu Rong and the other students on the ground, he looked as dashing as a god coming down to the mortal world! In the crowd, Xie Yujia also gasped in surprise with Hao Ren\u2019s jacket in her hands.Huang Xujie was in a real panic now. Seeing that Hao Ren had caught up with him, he looked up at the hold above him and inhaled deeply before reaching up for it.It didn\u2019t matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t change the fact that Hao Ren went down and had caught up with him. In people\u2019s eyes, Hao Ren was already the winner.Even if he could reach the summit before Hao Ren, it only meant that he was more skilled; Hao Ren was the one who had greater strength.The girls who had been looking up at Huang Xujie starry-eyed were all talking about the previously unknown Hao Ren.The steady and tense competition between the two rivals continued. Huang Xujie was astonished. But as a professional rock climber, he kept his emotions in control and his movements steady.In a rock climbing competition, no one was the winner until the last moment.Even if a climber was inches away from the top, he or she would fail immediately if the grip got loose and a mistake was made.At the moment, the two were so close that they could hear each other\u2019s loud heartbeats.Sweat drops flowed down from their arms and faces and fell to the ground more than ten meters below them, shattering into pieces.\u201cIf I win, you must explain to the freshmen how the Rock Climbing Club charges its members,\u201d Hao Ren said coldly while glancing at Huang Xujie.\u201cSave your breath until you can beat me!\u201d Huang Xujie glared at Hao Ren and replied as he reached for a higher hold while spreading his limbs to their limits.Only highly-skilled rock climbers could accomplish this spider-shaped movement.On the ground, Yu Rong and the others gradually calmed down from their earlier excitement. The last meter until the summit was the most challenging part. Standing far below, they had a clear view of the last few holds which were more than half a meter from each other. Without leaping, the climbers couldn\u2019t reach any of them. However, leaping was a highly-risky move during which the climbers could fall from the wall at the smallest mistake!Huang Xujie knew the difficulty in the last meter well. It was a thin line between success and failure.He gulped, hesitating about the leap. On the one hand, Hao Ren was already kind of the winner in people\u2019s eyes when he caught up with Huang Xujie after going down, and Huang Xujie had to reach the summit to win back his honor. On the other hand, Huang Xujie was not absolutely sure if he could conquer the last meter. He had only a 50% success rate even during normal practice.Now, he berated himself for setting the difficulty level to the highest to prevent anyone from reaching the summit and getting the prize.While he was weighing his options, Hao Ren measured the distance with his eyes and leaped up!It seemed that time had stopped when he leaped.Everyone looked at Hao Ren who leaped into the air by kicking on two holds.Silhouetted against the blue sky, Hao Ren looked like he was flying while the wind fluttered his white vest.Of course, it was people\u2019s illusion. Hao Ren just leaped half a meter into the air with his body free of the support from the wall.Yu Rong and the other two belayers held the rope anxiously with sweaty hands.Slap!Hao Ren landed on the rock wall with one hand gripping one hold and one foot stepping on another.When everyone heaved a sigh of relief, Hao Ren, who had gripped only two holds instead of three, began to swing!\u201cOh!\u201d everyone gasped due to fear.It seemed that the audiences\u2019 mouths and voices were no longer under their control.Putting more strength in his fingers and gripping the hold tightly, Hao Ren stabilized his body. Putting his free foot onto a pocket in the wall, he leaned closely against it.Hao Ren heaved a sigh of relief.He let go of one hand and reached up to grip another hold.The most challenging part was over, and he would reach the summit after two easy steps.Red-eyed, Huang Xujie lost his composure. Taking two deep breaths, he also leaped up for a hold above him.Slap!His hand grabbed the hold!\u201cYes!\u201d the members of the Rock Climbing Club, who had been holding back for the past ten minutes, cheered.While they cheered, Huang Xujie\u2019s arm couldn\u2019t support his weight, and his hand slipped. He fell from the position near the summit that was more than ten meters in the air!The three belayers immediately tightened their grip on the rope and controlled Huang Xujie\u2019s fall.Meanwhile, Hao Ren took the last two steps and reached the summit successfully!\u201cWow!\u201d the cheers exploded from the crowd on the ground.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLooking around at the students who were cheering in excitement, Zhao Jiayi had a feeling that the legend of Hao Ren would soon spread all over the school.Hao Ren waved his hand and descended slowly with the help from the rope.Huang Xujie had already reached the ground, and his face was purple with rage.It was obvious who the winner was and who the loser was.Xie Wanjun, who had been emotionless during the whole competition, grinned suddenly. \u201cNo wonder this guy could beat half of the basketball team\u2026\u201d he thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He slowly walked to Huang Xujie and pointed his finger at the white speakerphone by the table. \u201cWe just agreed on\u2026\u201d he started to speak.\u201cWhen did we agree on anything?\u201d Huang Xujie stared at Hao Ren with a look so cold that it could cut through human bodies.Hao Ren embarrassed him twice in front of so many people. Therefore, Huang Xujie, who valued his reputation a lot, would be willing to die if he could cut Hao Ren into 18 pieces now.Xie Yujia saw that Hao Ren was walking to Huang Xujie and thought they were going to fight. Therefore, she hastily ran over to Hao Ren with his jacket still in her hands.Xie Wanjun was just about to leave, and he stopped as he noticed the change in the situation. Hao Ren\u2019s safety was nothing to him, but he couldn\u2019t leave his sister behind.Huang Xujie\u2019s anger decreased by half when he saw Xie Yujia, especially when he noticed Xie Wanjun, who stood out from the crowd, staring at him. He didn\u2019t dare to make any impulsive moves; at least he dared not yell at Xie Yujia.Maybe others were not aware of Xie Yujia\u2019s status, he as one of the influential person in school knew exactly what her background was. No one at school dared to get in her brother, Xie Wanjun\u2019s way.Even Lin Li, who considered herself to be the most popular girl in the school and didn\u2019t care about other girls\u2019 existence, would keep some distance from Xie Yujia. It was because she learned from Huang Xujie that Xie Yujia\u2019s older brother was Xie Wanjun, the Captain of the school basketball team!\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Xie Yujia asked Huang Xujie when she saw Hao Ren\u2019s slightly irritated expression.She and Huang Xujie kind of knew each other since they were both a part of the Student Council.\u201cYour classmate isn\u2019t satisfied with the prizes he won; he is also trying to interfere with my club\u2019s management,\u201d Huang Xujie tried hard to suppress his anger and said in an upset tone.\u201cI don\u2019t care about the prize. However, you need to clarify your club\u2019s charges to the freshmen,\u201d Hao Ren said to him lightly.The crowd circled the three as they saw the conflict between Hao Ren and Huang Xujie after the match.\u201cWhat charges? It\u2019s 200 yuan to enroll,\u201d Huang Xujie insisted when he saw more people getting closer.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll say it if you won\u2019t,\u201d Hao Ren nodded as he walked to the table to grab the bullhorn.Shoo! Huang Xujie reached out his arm in anger and tried to stop Hao Ren.Pa! Hao Ren was equally upset. He pushed away Huang Xujie\u2019s arm without hesitation.Even though Huang Xujie was strong, his strength was nothing compared to Hao Ren\u2019s. After all, Hao Ren had to carry 100 kilograms around on his wrists every day.Huang Xujie immediately got pushed aside, and he almost fell.Hao Ren quickly picked up the bullhorn, turned it on, and said to the crowd, \u201cWhoever is considering joining the Rock Climbing Club, listen carefully. The fee you are paying today is only the enrollment fee, and it does not include the fee you have to pay a week later. Not only that, the training and equipment will be an extra charge as well!\u201d\u201cI thought the 200 yuan would cover everything!\u201d\u201cWe have to buy our own equipment? I thought the club is going to provide it for us.\u201dSure enough, those who just registered and those who were going to register started to discuss.\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business!\u201d Huang Xujie dashed over.He whipped out his fist and aimed it at Hao Ren\u2019s forehead. However, it was stopped by a giant hand.He turned back and saw Xie Wanjun staring at him angrily from above with eyes wide open. Xie Wanjun was grasping onto his arm with the palm that was twice the size of an average person.\u201cBrother Jun, he injured your basketball team members, and you are still helping him?\u201d Huang Xujie took his arm back as he asked.\u201cThat\u2019s between him and me, and I\u2019ll deal with that later. I\u2019m not happy with you charging students with all these extra fees as well,\u201d Xie Wanjun said.This was the first time Hao Ren heard Xie Wanjun talk and looked at him from such a close distance. Xie Wanjun\u2019s deep voice had an overwhelming sense of power, and those who didn\u2019t obey would be playing with fire.\u201cI don\u2019t want to join this Rock Climbing Club anymore. Can I get a refund?\u201d a freshman asked Hao Ren timidly.\u201cAsk him,\u201d Hao Ren pointed at Lu Bo, who was the Assistant Captain of the club.Lu Bo could do nothing but nod at this moment.Then, a couple of students who had just registered for the club got their refund one by one. They thought the enrolment fee was all it took to attend the Rock Climbing Club and had no idea that there would be a large number of charges to follow. An official set of rock climbing equipment, for example, would cost thousands; not a lot of students could afford that!\u201cIt\u2019s almost time! Let\u2019s get back to class,\u201d Hao Ren said after the issue had been taken care of as he wiped off the sweat on his forehead.\u201cOk, let\u2019s go!\u201d Zhao Jiayi was glad to see Hao Ren venting his anger, and he didn\u2019t want to stick around any longer after this was done.Hao Ren glimpsed at Huang Xujie, who was so upset that his eyes turned red, and ignored him. He simply took his jacket from Xie Yujia and walked out of there.\u201cHey! You forgot your prize!\u201d Xie Wanjun said in his deep voice. He grasped the set of black equipment and threw it at Hao Ren.Hao Ren caught it in his hands and tossed it into the air twice. Then, he threw it back to Xie Wanjun and said, \u201cI don\u2019t need it!\u201dXie Wanjun was over two meters tall and was strong like a bull. He was forced back half a step by the 50-pound equipment that was thrown to him. He thought to himself, \u201cThis guy has pretty strong arm strength!\u201d\u201cHao Ren!\u201d Xie Yujia jogged over to catch up with him.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Class President?\u201d Hao Ren turned around reluctantly.This Class President was perfect besides her interest in controlling too many things. If she was like this already, she would definitely be a strict wife after she gets married.However, she was very nice to all her classmates.\u201cYou forgot these bracelets,\u201d she handed them over to Hao Ren.Hao Ren then suddenly remembered the Mount Tai Bracelets he just left beside the wall. Hao Ren quickly took them from her smooth hands and put them on his wrists.\u201cIf I had forgotten these bracelets and had lost them\u2026\u201d Hao Ren shivered as he thought of the necklace around his neck.Although he had never tasted the feeling of the tightening necklace, he knew it wouldn\u2019t be the best feeling in the world. It was from Su Han after all, and it was no cheap Dharma treasure. She would never leave a life behind if she had decided to kill; that was her personality.\u201cThank you, Class President!\u201d Hao Ren thanked her sincerely this time.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXie Yujia noticed how much Hao Ren valued these seemingly ordinary bracelets, and she also caught him subconsciously touching the silver necklace. Then, she realized that the bracelets and the necklace seemed like a set.\u201cAre these gifts from Su Han as well?\u201d Xie Yujia thought to herself.\u201cClass President, you must have class in the afternoon too. Go get some lunch before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Hao Ren laughed happily and said to her. Afterward, he walked away with his arm around Zhao Jiayi\u2019s neck.Xie Yujia looked at Hao Ren as he walked off; she wondered if his girlfriend was really Su Han.She didn\u2019t come to herself until Ma Lina came over and nudged her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Did you see Huang Xujie\u2019s face, Ren? It was so awful that it looked like he was taking a poop!\u201d Zhao Jiayi shouted in excitement as he walked.\u201cDamn it, man. We are going to eat soon\u2026 Maybe don\u2019t talk about poop right now?\u201d Cao Ronghua shouted.\u201cBut it was really awesome!\u201d Zhao Jiayi kept making crazy hand gestures as he talked, \u201cI still remember how arrogant that guy was when we saw him at Hongji Square last time. But today, he didn\u2019t even dare to make a sound when those students were asking for a refund!\u201dHao Ren simply smiled. Although he felt good too, he was not as excited as Zhao Jiayi.Since they played tricks on Zhao Jiayi to make him fall, it could have been a severe accident. If Zhao Jiayi fell on his own, Hao Ren wouldn\u2019t take this opportunity to interfere with the excessive fees charged by the Rock Climbing Club.He certainly knew that Xie Wanjun\u2019s presence was also the reason why Huang Xujie turned quiet. Huang Xujie had to swallow it because even Xie Wanjun wasn\u2019t happy about all the hidden fees in the Rock Climbing Club.\u201cRen, you are pretty awesome at rock climbing. Have you practiced before?\u201d Zhou Liren interrupted.\u201cPractice my *ss! I have only seen it on TV!\u201d Hao Ren answered.However, he remembered that when he was little and stayed at his grandma\u2019s, he had rebelliously climbed on to the fences and the trees thousands of times.\u201cThose single-arm swings were amazing!\u201d Zhou Liren shouted.Hao Ren broke out in cold sweat. His random moves on the rock climbing wall even got a professional name from Zhou Liren.While chatting, they arrived at the cafeteria. After lunch, they headed to class.The news about the rock climbing competition where Hao Ren defeated Huang Xujie has been passed around in the school, and the students had been crazily spreading the video of Hao Ren\u2019s last moves where he did consecutive pull-ups with single arms while his feet were free in the air before jumping into the air to grasp the holds far above him.\u201cThat guy behind us\u2026in the second last row. The one in the black shirt.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s him? King of the Air?\u201dEven during the class, many students turned back to check Hao Ren out.\u201cGreat reputation travels far,\u201d Zhou Liren sighed as he tried his best to think of a proper saying. It wasn\u2019t easy for him since his grades were the worst amongst them.Hao Ren had no time to deal with those remarks. He was focused on preparing his tutoring material, and he wondered how Zhao Yanzi did on her midterms.Ring!The bell rang.After two hours of sitting, students rushed out of the classroom. A few girls were still checking Hao Ren out as they walked out, and some of whom were beautiful young girls in their freshman year.\u201cYou are famous now, Ren. Some of the pretty girls might want to become your girlfriend!\u201d Zhou Liren said jealously.As they spoke, a pretty girl who was well dressed walked up to Hao Ren and handed him a note. \u201cThis is my number in case you want to talk sometime. I think you are pretty cool. I\u2019m a first year in the Business Major by the way,\u201d she said.After that, she headed for the door, leaving them a beautifully shaped figure to look at shortly. She whispered to another girl curiously, \u201cHow did I do? How did I do?\u201d\u201cWoah!\u201d Zhou Liren and the guys kicked up a fuss as they had never seen something like this.Hao Ren coughed as he opened up the note. Then, he rolled it up and threw it into the trash can in front of them.Zhou Liren didn\u2019t expect that. He shouted immediately, \u201cWhat are you doing throwing it away? She is such a pretty girl! Plus, she is so proactive!\u201dHao Ren waved and said in annoyance, \u201cAlright, alright, let\u2019s go already!\u201dZhou Liren took another look at the trash can reluctantly; he was struggling against the thought of picking the note back up. However, there were sticky leftover fruits in there which stopped him from going through the garbage for the pretty girl\u2019s number.If it was before, Hao Ren would probably find it interesting and get worked up and excited. He would have opened up his phone and messaged her right away. However, as popular as he was now, Hao Ren found it annoying since so many students were interested in getting to know him.He wasn\u2019t Huang Xujie who sought attention after all.\u201cDo you really have a girlfriend now?\u201d Zhou Liren caught up with him and asked.\u201cYou are getting more and more annoying. I\u2019ll just give all the notes to you to deal with in the future, alright?\u201d Hao Ren looked at him, speechless.\u201cThat\u2019s good! That\u2019s good!\u201d Zhou Liren kept on nodding, \u201cI\u2019ll be your agent, and whoever wants to date you will have to date me first!\u201d\u201cShameless!\u201d Hao Ren, Zhao Jiayi, and Cao Ronghua hit him in the face at the same time.\u201cBut I do think you and Xie Yujia would be a good match. Plus, you are from the same class and know each other pretty well already. We can tell that she cares a lot about you,\u201d Zhao Jiayi said to Hao Ren.\u201cHow can you guess our Class President\u2019s thoughts?\u201d Hao Ren said. In fact, Xie Yujia was also worried when Zhao Jiayi was climbing.\u201cWoah\u2026so our Ren does like Class President!\u201d Cao Ronghua cried out.Hao Ren shook his head; he didn\u2019t want to argue with them. These guys did no good, yet they were pretty good at ruining things. If they hadn\u2019t gone confessing Hao Ren\u2019s love for Xie Yujia without permission a while ago, the relationship between them wouldn\u2019t have been so weird lately.These days, their relationship had just been getting a little better. Hao Ren didn\u2019t want Zhao Jiayi and the guys to mess it up again.Hao Ren had more respect than the fondness for Xie Yujia. She was a charming girl, and her excellent grades and outstanding abilities made her stand out. With all these great traits, she also demonstrated the cute side of her personality such as sing. All these made her destined to become a goddess in all the guys\u2019 eyes.Zhao Jiayi changed the topic when he realized Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. \u201cIt\u2019s still early. Let\u2019s go play basketball!\u201d he yelled.Although he failed at rock climbing, his obsession with sports was awoken. Hao Ren didn\u2019t tell Zhao Jiayi that he might have succeeded in rock climbing if the members of the Rock Climbing Club hadn\u2019t messed with the equipment; he knew it would only make Zhao Jiayi more depressed.\u201cCome along, Ren!\u201d Zhao Jiayi dragged his arm.\u201cI can\u2019t play basketball!\u201d Hao Ren shook his head.\u201cYou only need to know how to pass, dribble, and shoot the ball!\u201d Zhao Jiayi knocked hard on Hao Ren\u2019s shoulder with his fist, dissatisfied.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go,\u201d Hao Ren agreed to go with them at last. He felt bad for not hanging out with them enough lately because of cultivation and tutoring.Zhao Jiayi\u2019s execution ability was really worth mentioning. On the one hand, he immediately called up Yu Rong and some other guys and told them to bring a basketball from the dorm. On the other hand, he quickly booked a basketball court with Hao Ren and the other two. The guys gathered at the court at the same time.The school made a rule for the Basketball Team after the incident last time. Thus, one could rarely see them practicing on the courts outside. In addition, since they were to play against Jinghua University next week, they had to train even more intensively due to the loss of a few of their starting players.The Rock Climbing Club\u2019s registration desk had disappeared from outside of the stadium. Their new member welcoming activities used to go on for an entire day, but all the desks and chairs were nowhere to be found.Hao Ren could imagine how mad Huang Xujie must be after he returned to the club. He must have thrown a tantrum at his members in the club.It wasn\u2019t his first time going against Huang Xujie anyways, so Hao Ren wasn\u2019t worried about how Huang Xujie would seek revenge on him. Instead, he focused on playing basketball with the guys.They played four against four on the half court, Zhao Jiayi\u2019s dorm against Yu Rong\u2019s dorm.Basketball wasn\u2019t really Hao Ren\u2019s strong suit. Basically, he would pass the ball whenever he got it, and he would shoot it at the basket when he couldn\u2019t pass it since he didn\u2019t know how to dribble properly. He would score if he was lucky. If not, the rebound would be secured by Zhou Liren with his height advantage or Zhao Jiayi with his excellent leaping ability.\u201cDon\u2019t just pass it, Ren! Dribble and move around!\u201d Zhao Jiayi yelled after securing six rebounds; he was out of breath.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be caught traveling! Damn!\u201d Hao Ren answered as he bounced the ball like an elementary schooler.Zhao Jiayi rolled his eyes speechlessly, but he had to admit that Hao Ren had a pretty good sense of positioning when he didn\u2019t have the ball; Zhao Jiayi always had a chance to throw the ball at Hao Ren for him to shoot.However, the accuracy of Hao Ren\u2019s shots wasn\u2019t that good. They were mostly airballs, and he got the backboard or the basket a few times. Zhou Liren had to tackle the ball and rebound using his height advantage.Although Cao Ronghua wasn\u2019t bad at aiming, his skinny body didn\u2019t give him too much energy to run around the court like Hao Ren. He had to stay still and wait for Hao Ren to pass the ball to him.Soon, Yu Rong\u2019s team learned about Hao Ren\u2019s weak aiming skills. They focused more on defending Zhao Jiayi and the other guys and left Hao Ren alone. It took a lot of energy for Zhao Jiayi and Zhou Liren to grab rebounds, and soon they were out of breath.\u201cSh*t! Sh*t! Sh*t!\u201d Zhao Jiayi shouted. He was upset when he noticed that they had fallen behind, knowing that his team\u2019s average skill was higher than that of Yu Rong\u2019s.Hao Ren held the ball and saw that the other team entirely blocked his three teammates. He took another shot seeing that he had no chance to pass the ball, and sure enough, it was another airball.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI told you I can\u2019t play basketball, and I\u2019ll only drag you guys down,\u201d Hao Ren murmured when he saw Zhao Jiayi\u2019s mad expression.At that moment, some dark clouds came above him, blocking the bright sunshine. Hao Ren looked up at the sky instantly.However, instead of the clouds, he saw Xie Wanjun standing behind him; tall as a hill.Zhao Jiayi and the other guys realized the change in the situation, and they hastily threw away the basketball and gathered around Hao Ren.They still remembered last time when Hao Ren beat several players on the Basketball Team. It was like yesterday when those players shouted madly in pain. Right now, the Captain of the Basketball Team was standing on the court with a stern expression. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be here! What could this possibly mean?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedXie Wanjun raised his hand, and Zhao Jiayi and the guys quickly ran over to Hao Ren as they thought Xie Wanjun was going to hit Hao Ren.However, Xie Wanjun simply pointed at Hao Ren and said in a calm yet determined tone, \u201cYou, join the Basketball Team!\u201dThis remark stupefied everyone including Hao Ren.\u201cWhat the hell? Why should he join just because you asked him to?\u201d Yu Rong shouted with the guys before Hao Ren could even respond.Xie Wanjun ignored their yelling and turned towards Zhao Jiayi. He pointed at him and said calmly, \u201cYou as well. Join the team!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Zhao Jiayi was just as surprised as Hao Ren.Xie Wanjun took out a little notebook from the pocket of his baggy sweatpants and read to Hao Ren, \u201cReaction, level S; Speed, level S; Arm Strength, level SS; Positioning, level B; Passing, level C; Dribbling, level D; Shooting Accuracy, level E.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Hao Ren asked.However, Xie Wanjun turned to Zhao Jiayi without answering Hao Ren\u2019s question. \u201cLeaping, level A; Positioning, level A; Passing, level B; Dribbling, level A; Endurance, level A; Judgement, level B; Height, level D,\u201d he read.Zhao Jiayi got straight As and Bs except for a D for his height, which he felt disheartened about too. Despite his enthusiasm and talent for basketball, he was only 1.7 meters tall. That was also the reason why he didn\u2019t make it into his middle school basketball team.His height certainly didn\u2019t get in the way of him being popular and being liked by girls at the school. Of course, the latter part of that sentence was from Zhao Jiayi\u2019s own words. Even though that was the case, Zhou Liren and the guys kind of believed it when they saw him being invited a lot by pretty girls. The girls had always asked him to go to karaoke or go on a trip with them.When Zhao Jiayi was formally invited to join the Basketball Team of East Ocean University by the Captain, he was thrilled! It had always been his dream to join the Basketball Team!When Xie Wanjun saw the Rock Climbing Club\u2019s registration event outside of the stadium, he decided to make time to take a look and see if there were any physically outstanding freshmen; he was hoping to recruit some new players to invigorate his team.When he saw \u201cShorty\u201d Zhao Jiayi smoothly climbed up over ten meters without any previous experience, he realized how talented this sophomore was; at least he knew how energetic and perseverant Zhao Jiayi was.However, before he could say anything to Zhao Jiayi, the quarreling scene between Hao Ren and Huang Xujie took place.He heard that Hao Ren and his friends were playing basketball outside while he was training in the stadium, so he came over to take a look.When Xie Wanjun saw Zhao Jiayi\u2019s smooth shooting motion and excellent basketball consciousness, he knew that he found himself an \u201cunprocessed jade\u201d. Therefore, he dashed over to invite them despite other people\u2019s objections.\u201cWhat A, B, C, D? Is it a multiple-choice question?\u201d Xu Yandong from Yu Rong\u2019s dorm shouted at Xie Wanjun, not knowing how good this Captain was at basketball.\u201cA, B, C, D, E are levels in my rating system, and S is better than A,\u201d he pointed at Zhao Jiayi and said, \u201cYour physical quality is excellent, and your basketball foundation is fairly impressive. You are quite promising as a sophomore.\u201dThen, he pointed to Hao Ren and said, \u201cYour foundation is extremely poor, but your physical quality is not excellent\u2026\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201d that remark hit Hao Ren pretty hard.\u201cNot excellent\u2026 but abnormally excellent!\u201d Xie Wanjun continued.Hao Ren who looked down immediately lifted up his head.\u201cI\u2019m missing a few players in the game next week, so you need to serve as a last resort,\u201d Xie Wanjun carried on calmly as if the opinion of others didn\u2019t matter to him at all.Hao Ren thought about it for a few seconds.After he made sure that Xie Wanjun wasn\u2019t there to pick a fight with them, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no problem if you want Zhao Jiayi on your team, but I don\u2019t know how to play at all\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have no choice. One of the things the Vice Principal promised me when I fired my team members was that I could pick anyone for the game next week,\u201d Xie Wanjun said to Hao Ren in his calm voice.Hao Ren shook his head and replied, \u201cEven so\u2026\u201dXie Wanjun lifted his hands and interrupted Hao Ren. \u201cA man should take responsibility for his actions. I didn\u2019t hold you responsible for injuring my team members. In addition, it was me who urged the school to fire those troublemakers,\u201d he said.\u201cHe requested them to be fired?\u201d not only Hao Ren, Xu Rong, Zhao Jiayi, and the other guys were all surprised.\u201cYou can check with the Vice Principal, Lu Qing, if you don\u2019t believe my words,\u201d Xie Wanjun said before closing his mouth.Hao Ren suddenly remembered that when he went to see Lu Qing in the Administrative Building, Xie Wanjun was there too. Now, he realized that Xie Wanjun looked mad back then because his team members caused a lot of trouble; this Captain wasn\u2019t mad at him.Xie Wanjun didn\u2019t rush for Hao Ren\u2019s decision as he noticed that Hao Ren was rooted in his thoughts. He turned to Zhao Jiayi and asked seriously, \u201cAre you willing to join the Basketball Team?\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Zhao Jiayi agreed immediately.Xie Wanjun asked again since he didn\u2019t hear the answer he was looking for, \u201cAre you willing or not willing!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m willing to join the team!\u201d Zhao Jiayi gave a definite answer.The guys looked at Zhao Jiayi in surprise as they didn\u2019t expect him to join the \u201cenemy team\u201d so quickly. He was just in an intense fight with the members of the Basketball Team not long ago, yet he was already a part of their team!However, Zhao Jiayi thought differently. Basketball was not only his hobby but also his dream. He saw the invitation from the Captain of the Basketball Team as the recognition for his abilities. The opportunity only knocks once, so he had to make the most of it!Having gotten an affirmative answer from Zhao Jiayi, Xie Wanjun turned to Hao Ren again and asked, \u201cHow about you? Do you want to be a part of the game next week?\u201dHao Ren heard him clear this time; instead of asking him to join the team, Xie Wanjun was asking if he wanted to play in the game next week.\u201cWith your strength and fast reaction time, you can be a good fit to replace Bai Zhixiong\u2019s position. You can be the temporary Power Forward of the team. You will be rebounding, defending, and blocking. We won\u2019t count on you for shooting and scoring. Simply put, you will be the hard labor in the restricted area,\u201d Xie Wanjun laid it all out to Hao Ren without mercy.Hao Ren understood and felt relieved after hearing this.\u201cSounds like this Xie Wanjun had been paying attention to me for a while now,\u201d he thought.\u201cYou, on the other hand,\u201d Xie Wanjun turned back to Zhao Jiayi and said, \u201cAre quick in reacting and smooth in dribbling. You can also protect the ball well while dribbling since your center of gravity is lower. Plus, with a great sense of space and timing, you can pass the ball on by making use of gaps and errors in the other team\u2019s defense. You are a great fit as a Point Guard. Your accurate shooting skills can benefit you in this position even more!\u201dXie Wanjun kept on and on about how good Zhao Jiayi was. Even though Zhao Jiayi was short, Xie Wanjun couldn\u2019t stop praising him out loud.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Jiayi\u2019s eyes got brighter and brighter. Although Hao Ren didn\u2019t understand the meaning of the whole spiel, Zhao Jiayi, as a basketball fan, knew clearly that the Point Guards had the most opportunity to control the ball in an entire game. They were the real core of the team!\u201cYes! I\u2019m in!\u201d Hao Ren agreed without hesitation after seeing his buddy light up with excitement.He asked, \u201cWhen do we start training?\u201dXie Wanjun couldn\u2019t help but laugh when he heard Hao Ren\u2019s question.\u201cYour friend can start his training with the rest of the team starting tomorrow. As for you\u2026\u201d he dragged out his voice before stating, \u201cYujia can instruct you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown Translated\u201cYujia?\u201d Hao Ren and the others felt that this name was so familiar, but they couldn\u2019t think of the person.\u201cXie Yujia, your Class President,\u201d Xie Wanjun said.Hao Ren and the others were stunned again.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d they looked at each other and gasped at the same time.\u201cShe\u2019s my younger sister. Her basketball skills aren\u2019t that great, but she is good enough for a noob like you!\u201d Xie Wanjun said as he looked at Hao Ren.\u201cYounger sister\u2026\u201d after some murmuring, the guys couldn\u2019t help but shout, \u201cHuh? Younger sister!\u201dComparing the skinny and pure Xie Yujia to this powerful and buff Xie Wanjun, no one would believe that they were related!\u201cThis black \u2018gorilla\u2019 actually has a beautiful younger sister!?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of expression is that?\u201d Xie Wanjun looked at them emotionlessly and asked.Even Yu Rong, who was usually quick on his feet, didn\u2019t know what to say due to the shock.Hao Ren thought back to the morning when he rode the bicycle with Xie Yujia on the back seat. They entered from the west entrance, and there were many hotels nearby. They bumped into Xie Wanjun, who was leading the whole basketball team for their morning run\u2026 At that moment, Xie Yujia was sitting in the back and was holding onto his lower waist\u2026\u201cThat\u2019ll be all. You will come to the school\u2019s main entrance and gather with us at six o\u2019clock tomorrow morning. We\u2019ll start with a morning run, and then you\u2019ll join the regular training.\u201d Xie Wanjun said to Zhao Jiayi. Then, he turned to Hao Ren and said with a cold face, \u201cI will have Yujia teach you the basic basketball moves one by one. Same time in the morning at six o\u2019clock, and you\u2019ll train on the outdoor basketball court!\u201dAfter he said that, he turned around and was about to leave.\u201cA pretty girl will teach Hao Ren basketball?\u201d this tempted Zhou Liren. and he asked courageously, \u201cBig bro, can I join the Basketball Team as well?\u201dAs he said that, he rolled up his sleeves and revealed the round muscles on his shoulder. \u201cLook, I am strong too, and I am also above 1.8 meters\u2026\u201d he added.Xie Wanjun glanced at him and interrupted with one sentence, \u201cYou still have a long way to go!\u201d Then, the Captain of the Basketball Team turned around and walked away steadily; soon, everyone on the court could only look at his figure from afar.Zhou Liren was struck badly by Xie Wanjun\u2019s disdainful sentence. He couldn\u2019t adjust to the sentence in time, and he said to Zhao Jiayi, \u201cAin\u2019t I strong? Don\u2019t you forget your bros since you\u2019re on the basketball team now! Zhao Jiayi, you have to recommend me!\u201dHis eagerness to join the team seemed to have helped him forget how he looked at Zhao Jiayi as a traitor when Zhao Jiayi agreed to join the Basketball Team.Everything happened all of a sudden, and it took Yu Rong and the others a while to get all the facts straight. Zhao Jiayi was recruited to the Basketball Team, and Hao Ren would play in the basketball game between East Ocean University and Jinghua University. Furthermore, Zhao Jiayi was going to attend the Basketball Team\u2019s training, and Hao Ren would be instructed by Xie Yujia regarding basic basketball moves. The most shocking news among them was that the beautiful Xie Yujia was actually Xie Wanjun\u2019s younger sister!Not only Yu Rong and others were dazed, but Zhao Jiayi himself was also confused. He didn\u2019t expect that fighting with the members of the Basketball Team would bring him such fortune. He got Xie Wanjun\u2019s attention and was recruited to the Basketball Team to fill the vacancies! In addition, the position he would be playing was going to be Point Guard, the most important position in the team!However, none of them knew that Xie Wanjun was really eager to recruit Hao Ren for next week\u2019s game! Only his level of stamina and strength could help them with this tough battle when the main players were missing.Xie Wanjun wanted to punish those few black sheep, but he didn\u2019t want to lose the game as well!Even though Zhao Jiayi had potential, it would take time to train him\u2026 Fortunately, Hao Ren understood the meaning of a \u201cbundled sale\u201d of his good friends and himself\u2026Therefore, Xie Wanjun only praised Zhao Jiayi on the surface, but he actually thought highly of Hao Ren.Since the training would be very tough, he didn\u2019t want to make it seem like he was avenging for what happened earlier. That was why he had his younger sister instruct Hao Ren instead of putting him on the basketball team for the cruel training.He didn\u2019t praise Hao Ren because he was afraid that Hao Ren would get too confident and cocky. As a matter of fact, the key to winning the game next week was Hao Ren.Xie Wanjun wasn\u2019t stupid! He had a thoughtful mind and steady way of dealing with things. If not, how could he lead the Basketball Team of East Ocean University to the championship in the National College Basketball League!On the other hand, Hao Ren wasn\u2019t stupid either. He accepted Xie Wanjun\u2019s request because he wanted to help his friend, Zhao Jiayi, on his first public appearance. He was planning to fully cooperate with Zhao Jiayi and make him score a lot in next week\u2019s game between East Ocean University and Jinghua University! Even though he didn\u2019t know much about basketball, he knew Zhao Jiayi\u2019s performance in the first game would determine his future ranking on the Basketball Team.\u201cZhao Jiayi, you got to treat us now that you successfully got on the Basketball Team!\u201d Zhou Liren, who couldn\u2019t be on the Basketball Team, yelled to Zhao Jiayi in distress.\u201cTreat, treat, treat, all you know is treating you!\u201d Zhao Jiayi hit Zhou Liren\u2019s head with his hand, turned around, and told Yu Rong, \u201cCall everyone from room 301 to 306! I\u2019ll treat you guys!\u201dAfterward, he couldn\u2019t stifle his smile; luck just dropped from the sky! He brought Hao Ren to play basketball and got scouted by the Captain of the Basketball Team\u2019s captain. He became a member of the Basketball Team inexplicably and would have a chance to play in the National College Basketball League!After this incident, they didn\u2019t have the mood to play more basketball. Yu Rong wanted to go back and spread the news, and Zhao Jiayi was also in a rush to tell his friends from high school about this great news as well. He might have to treat them in a celebration, too!Thus, everyone dispersed. Yu Rong brought his basketball back to the dorm, Zhao Jiayi went to invite his high school friends who were also studying in East Ocean University, and Zhou Liren followed Yu Rong to join in on the fun.Hao Ren saw that it was almost four o\u2019clock, so he thought for a while and decided to meet Su Han.After Su Han put the Mount Tai Bracelets on his wrists, Hao Ren didn\u2019t dare to go into the trap again. However, it wouldn\u2019t work if he kept on avoiding her. After all, he still needed her to advise him on cultivation. Although Vice Principal Lu Qing was kind, he was really busy, and Hao Ren didn\u2019t want to trouble him often either.Hao Ren came to the door of Su Han\u2019s office exactly at four o\u2019clock. He knocked on the door, heard Su Han say \u201ccome in\u201d from within, and pushed the door open to go inside.Su Han wore a colorful floral dress today. The design of spaghetti straps revealed her smooth shoulders and made them seem pretty and glamorous. The cut of the dress totally highlighted her perfect body shape, and any guys would drool over Su Han in this outfit.At the moment, she was sitting on a chair while leaning against the window. Her long legs were resting on top of a stool, and she was reading a magazine.\u201cIf Su Han isn\u2019t a teacher, she could definitely do well as a model,\u201d Hao Ren thought as he walked over and coughed twice.Su Han glanced at him and looked at the seat in front of her as she said, \u201cGo cultivate yourself.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Hao Ren walked over, crossed his legs, and sat on the bamboo mat with the Tai Chi pattern.Before he closed his eyes, Hao Ren looked at Su Han, who sat in front of him, again. He saw her grabbing the coffee on the windowsill and flipping through the magazine as she took a sip.\u201cSu Han actually has a modern side to her as well,\u201d Hao Ren corrected his perspective of Su Han once again.Su Han seemed to have sensed Hao Ren\u2019s stares, so she said while reading, \u201cYou were in the spotlight today.\u201d\u201cYou are talking about the Rock Climbing Club?\u201d Hao Ren thought and asked.\u201cWhat else could it be?\u201d Su Han asked back.Hao Ren smiled and didn\u2019t say anything. He thought Su Han didn\u2019t really care about other matters and only cared about cultivation. Yet, it seemed that an Inspector like her was actually aware of the surrounding events.\u201cDid you go to the Dragon Palace last weekend?\u201d Su Han asked.\u201cYeah,\u201d Hao Ren nodded.Hao Ren was actually a little afraid of Su Han. She was no doubt the secret agent of the Dragon Tribe. The Inspectors\u2019 abilities of information gathering were very intimidating.\u201cCome here,\u201d Su Han thought for a bit and waved at Hao Ren.Hao Ren walked up to her. No matter if it was a good thing or a bad thing, any types of resistance would be useless in front of this master.She held up Hao Ren\u2019s wrist as if she was trying to sense something.Hao Ren\u2019s arm was held up by her, and he felt her exquisite and smooth palm. That comfort was indescribable.\u201cSu Han is the No.1 Beauty in East Ocean. No wonder so many people are obsessed with her\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cYour heart is beating very fast,\u201d Su Han said indifferently.\u201cBeing held by a beauty like you, it\u2019s hard for it not to beat fast,\u201d Hao Ren replied.Su Han raised her head and stared at Hao Ren before saying, \u201cSweet talk.\u201dIt might be because she wasn\u2019t happy with her reply, she added again, \u201cI can put two more Mount Tai Bracelets on you if you want.\u201d\u201cUh, please don\u2019t,\u201d Hao Ren gave in quickly. It wouldn\u2019t do him any good if he made the beautiful Su Han angry.However, he felt this icy beauty was a little cute sometimes.Su Han let go of Hao Ren\u2019s arm after a while and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve improved since last time, but two meridians\u2019 ends were split in the wrong direction. They are Yangwei Meridian and Yinqiao Meridian. Try feeling it yourself.\u201d((in acupuncture and Chinese medicine) each of a set of pathways in the body along which vital energy is said to flow. )Hao Ren followed her instructions, worked the Natural Essence in his body using the Spirit Concentration Scroll, and felt the slight clog in these two spots.However, there were only three to four small acupoints in those spots, so Hao Ren was able to open them up in no time after guiding the Nature Essence in his body through them.The Spirit Concentration Scroll formed a perfect cycle and circulation in his body, and it immediately made Hao Ren feel the increase in the speed of circulation of the Nature Essence.Seeing Su Han looking down at the magazine again, Hao Ren admired her and felt grateful.\u201cAfter all, I still need a master to coach me. If I tried to explore it myself, I don\u2019t know when I would be able to find that something is wrong with my meridians. It would also take time away from breaking through the third level of the Spirit Concentration Scroll\u2026 On the other hand, Zhao Guang often meets up with me and instructs me on cultivation as well. Yet, he didn\u2019t spot any issues with my cultivation. This is proof that Su Han\u2019s level is way stronger than Zhao Guang\u2019s,\u201d he thought.Seeing Su Han ignoring him again, Hao Ren returned to his seat and prepared to concentrate on cultivation. He was about to close his eyes, but he thought for a while and asked, \u201cSu Han, you\u2019re not cultivating?\u201dSu Han raised her head and looked at him. \u201cYou really think I am a cultivation freak? I have to rest sometimes too. Besides, you would affect my cultivation in some way when you are here,\u201d she said straightforwardly.Hao Ren forced a smile. Even though this teacher\u2019s level was high, her attitude was not exactly the greatest.He closed his eyes and was about to cultivate, but Su Han suddenly said, \u201cDo you know about Zi\u2019s birthday party?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it next month?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cYeah, I already received an invitation. The scale of Zi\u2019s birthday party will be huge this time, and many important figures who live in seclusion will be there,\u201d Su Han said.\u201cIs it because of the importance of Zi\u2019s 15th birthday?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cHumph,\u201d Su Han snorted lightly, \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as you think. If it\u2019s just a normal party, I wouldn\u2019t be talking to you about it.\u201dHao Ren sensed that there was more that Su Han was not telling him and asked, \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is\u2026\u201d\u201cThis gathering seems like Zi\u2019s birthday party on the surface, but it\u2019s an event to compare the strengths of the four Oceans, especially East Ocean and West Ocean. Zhao Guang visited and invited many important figures to come out and help. The appearances of these influential figures would indicate where they stand.\u201dSeeing Su Han saying this solemnly, Hao Ren became serious as well. \u201cDoes it mean the start of a war?\u201d he asked.\u201cIt\u2019s not as severe as a war, but small-scale fights will definitely happen continuously. Even though these two Oceans seem friendly to each other, their relationship has deteriorated over these years. East Ocean\u2019s businesses on land are doing way better than West Ocean; but in terms of cultivation, West Ocean is slightly better.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t Zhao Yanzi\u2019s Third Uncle very powerful?\u201d Hao Ren asked.Su Han shook her head and explained, \u201cBecause of him, West Ocean doesn\u2019t dare to do anything reckless. Zhao Kuo is the No.1 Master in the Human Realm. Other than those old cultivators who don\u2019t come out for thousands of years, almost no one could defeat him.\u201d\u201cZhao Yanzi\u2019s Third Uncle is that strong\u2026\u201d Hao Ren was shocked again. After hearing both the flattering from Premier Xia and the compliment from the Heavenly Master Su Han, Hao Ren felt totally different about Zhao Kuo.\u201cHe\u2019s truly invincible in the Human Realm\u2026 No wonder Zhao Yanzi\u2019s Third Uncle is so arrogant,\u201d Hao Ren thought.\u201cHowever,\u201d Su Han changed her tone, \u201cZhao Kuo\u2019s Heavenly Tribulation will be next month. If Zhao Kuo can pass through the Heavenly Tribulation and become a Heavenly Dragon, West Ocean will still be intimidated for a while. If not\u2026\u201dSu Han didn\u2019t continue. However, Hao Ren\u2019s mood became solemn as her tone changed.Since he was truly invincible in the Human Realm, Zhao Kuo\u2019s Heavenly Tribulation would definitely be very tough.\u201cThus, don\u2019t think that you\u2019ll be fine as Zhao Guang\u2019s Son-In-Law. If East Ocean and West Ocean start fighting, they may not be capable of protecting Zi,\u201d Su Han stated.\u201cZi will be in danger despite being the daughter of the Dragon King?\u201d Hao Ren\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\u201cIn fact, East Ocean and West Ocean held grudges against each other for so long, and Zi is like the spark that ignited the bomb. And you,\u201d Su Han stared at Hao Ren and said, \u201cjust became Zi\u2019s fianc\u00e9 at this time.\u201dHao Ren\u2019s heart skipped another beat.\u201cI\u2019m not too sure what Zhao Guang is thinking. Maybe he\u2019s preparing for the worst and will be handing Zi to your care,\u201d Su Han said.Hao Ren didn\u2019t speak; he was thinking hard. At this moment, his mind suddenly felt confused, and he was no longer in the mood to cultivate.\u201cWhich side are you on?\u201d Hao Ren asked her after a few seconds.\u201cI\u2019m an Inspector. Theoretically, I need to maintain the orderliness of the whole Dragon Tribe. If they really start fighting, I can only remain neutral. East Ocean and West Ocean are both powerful forces and can\u2019t be stopped by one or two Inspectors,\u201d Su Han replied.Hao Ren fell into thoughts again. Soon, he asked Su Han, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d\u201cWork harder to cultivate,\u201d Su Han left him with four words.Hao Ren didn\u2019t expect this kind of response. However, when he thought again, there was nothing else he could do. Other than trying to raise his strength, he couldn\u2019t do anything else. These internal fights of the Dragon Tribe couldn\u2019t be controlled by the secular forces.\u201cIn Zi\u2019s birthday party next month, many important figures, as well as other Inspectors, will appear in various forms. Any impure essence will be detected by them. However, as Zi\u2019s fianc\u00e9, you must be there. In other words\u2026\u201d Su Han dragged out her words, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t leveled up to Kan-level successfully to prove that you\u2019re a member of the Dragon Tribe, you\u2019ll be in a dangerous situation.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDangerous situation.Su Han said those two words syllable by syllable.\u201cFrom Zhao Kuo\u2019s speech and behavior, it is easy to tell the attitude these masters had towards normal human beings\u2026 sigh\u2026 it seems like I have no other choice\u2026\u201d Hao Ren thought.His forehead was full of sweat as he closed his eyes and concentrated on cultivating the most fundamental cultivation technique, the Spirit Concentration Scroll.Su Han, who sat in front of him, sighed deeply. She looked down at her beautiful hands and thought, \u201cSigh, if this guy can\u2019t reach Kan-level in time, should I help\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Come for dinner at Hongji Square! I\u2019m paying!\u201d Zhao Jiayi cried out excitedly over the phone.\u201cI\u2019ll pass. There\u2019s something else I need to do,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cDamn it, you!\u201d Zhao Jiayi tried to convince him, but Hao Ren still said no. Therefore, he had to let it go.\u201cTime\u2019s up. I\u2019m out,\u201d Hao Ren stood up and said to Su Han after he realized it was already six o\u2019clock.\u201cOkay,\u201d Su Han nodded.Seeing that Su Han didn\u2019t have anything else to say, Hao Ren left her office and took the bus to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s place.Today was the day her midterm results got released. Therefore, as her tutor as well as future husband, Hao Ren wanted to know as soon as possible.Hao Ren knew that the dinner at Hongji Square with Zhao Jiayi wouldn\u2019t end early, so he decided to pick Zhao Yanzi over the guys after some consideration.The front door was half open for Hao Ren when he got there. He walked in and saw Zhao Hongyu putting several dishes on the dining table.\u201cAuntie!\u201d Hao Ren greeted.\u201cHehe, you are here. Zhao Guang went to pick Zi up, and they should be back soon as well,\u201d Zhao Hongyu smiled lightly and said.Hao Ren asked after a bit of hesitation, \u201cAuntie, is it Zi\u2019s birthday next month?\u201d\u201cUm, yes. I thought she would tell you about it. Why? Are you preparing a gift for her?\u201d Hao Hongyu asked casually as she laid out the plates in order.\u201cWill there be a lot of people that day? Is West Ocean coming as well? Aren\u2019t East Ocean and West Ocean not getting along?\u201d Hao Ren asked a few questions in a roll.\u201cDid Su Han tell you all this?\u201d Zhao Hongyu laughed, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry. You are already a part of our East Ocean, and we sure won\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u201dZhao Hongyu rubbed his head as if he was Zi and said when she saw how worried Hao Ren was, \u201cDon\u2019t over-think; just act normal. If anything, Zi\u2019s dad and I will take care of it.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Hao Ren nodded. After Zhao Hongyu\u2019s comforting words, there wasn\u2019t much that Hao Ren could say. It seemed like there were indeed some conflicts between East Ocean and West Ocean. However, it was not an issue for Zhao Yanzi yet since her parents were dealing with all the pressure.Pa! Zhao Yanzi opened the door and entered, holding Zhao Guang\u2019s hand.She pouted as soon as she saw Hao Ren in the room; she was still not over the fact that Hao Ren \u201cbullied\u201d her last night.\u201cOk, go wash your hands, and let\u2019s have dinner!\u201d Zhao Hongyu said to both of them softly.After the four of them had sat down at the table, Zhao Hongyu asked Hao Ren how his grandma was doing back home. Then, she asked if the tutoring for Zhao Yanzi got in the way of his own studies. She didn\u2019t mention anything about the fight Hao Ren and Zhao Yanzi had last night on purpose.Hao Ren answered each question politely while Zhao Yanzi made a cold face, ignoring him at the dinner table.After that, Zhao Hongyu asked Zhao Guang about the invitations to Zi\u2019s birthday party.\u201cI have already sorted out the list and asked Premier Xia to send the invitations out last time I went back to the Dragon Palace. So far, South Ocean, North Ocean, and West Ocean are all attending. A few River Dragon Kings who are located further will send their congratulating gifts. Several Lake Dragon Kings will show up as well,\u201d Zhao Guang said.\u201cHow many people from West Ocean are coming?\u201d Zhao Hongyu asked.\u201cAbout 50 of them. And Old Zeng will be coming in person too,\u201d Zhao Guang said as he picked up some vegetables with his chopstick.\u201cIsn\u2019t he under his 100-year isolated cultivation? Why is he attending?\u201d Zhao Hongyu asked.\u201cHm, all because of this incident,\u201d Zhao Guang said in disdain.Zhao Hongyu slightly frowned and shook her head. \u201cThough we are not afraid of him because Zhao Kuo is going to be there,\u201d she said.\u201cThat\u2019s true. But the biggest problem is not Old Zeng. It\u2019s the Inspectors from different regions. Su Han has a good relationship with us, and she never caused any trouble for East Ocean. But it\u2019s hard to say if the other Inspectors will,\u201d Zhao Guang said seriously.Zhao Hongyu pointed at the dishes when she realized Hao Ren was listening carefully. \u201cEat first. We\u2019ll talk about it later,\u201d she said.Hao Ren thought to himself, \u201cZhao Yanzi\u2019s birthday is going to be a huge event. It looks like many powerful dragons are going to be present.\u201d\u201cOh, I met Zi\u2019s Class Advisor when I picked her up today,\u201d Zhao Guang said all of a sudden.\u201cOh, I was just about to ask. How was it? Zi\u2019s midterm result should be out, right?\u201d Zhao Hongyu was suddenly excited.\u201cIt\u2019s out, but her Class Advisor didn\u2019t tell me about it. She said that the report cards would be distributed during the Parent-Teacher Meeting tomorrow evening,\u201d Zhao Guang said.When her parents were talking about her grades, Zhao Yanzi was eating with her head down, pretending she didn\u2019t hear them at all. However, Hao Ren assumed she did terrible from her reaction.\u201cTomorrow evening? What a rush. I have been working on a design lately and won\u2019t be able to make time for it tomorrow. Can you go instead?\u201d Zhao Hongyu asked.\u201cI know you are busy these days, but I have been arranging things for Zi\u2019s birthday event, and I have to pay a visit to Elder Mu from the Breeze Forest. You know people like him wouldn\u2019t even come if I am not delivering the invitation myself. Once I\u2019m there, he would insist on playing chess and having a chat. I don\u2019t even know when I will be able to get back,\u201d Zhao Guang was replied.Zhao Hongyu sighed, \u201cTomorrow is the deadline for submitting the blueprint for Beijing\u2019s New Times Square, and I really want to get the bid. There are only eight architectural design studios from all over the world that got the opportunity to bid for it.\u201d\u201cAlright! Alright! It\u2019s ok if you can\u2019t come!\u201d Zhao Yanzi shouted, dissatisfied.Seeing their daughter throwing a tantrum, Zhao Hongyu and Zhao Guang looked at each other helplessly.Just when Zhao Hongyu was about to give up her plan on bidding for the design, Hao Ren said, \u201cI could go on your behalf.\u201dZhao Guang and Zhao Hongyu looked at Hao Ren at the same time. Then, they looked at each other and nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s good. There shouldn\u2019t be any important matters for this meeting besides the release of the report card,\u201d Zhao Hongyu nodded at Hao Ren and said, \u201cThen, please go on our behalf this time, Ren.\u201d\u201cThe Parent-Teacher Meeting starts at six O\u2019clock tomorrow afternoon, and Zi is in Grade 8 Class 2. Please don\u2019t be late,\u201d Zhao Guang said.By saying this, he agreed to the idea of Hao Ren attending the meeting for them as well.Hao Ren suddenly thought of Zhao Yanzi\u2019s Third Uncle. But then, he remembered that man\u2019s temper; it would be a miracle for him not to offend the teachers. Zhao Guang would not dare to let him go to the Parent-Teacher Meeting at all. His bad temper would explode if the teachers said something bad about Zhao Yanzi, and he did have the ability to destroy the school with an easy blow.After the matter had been settled, they chitchatted for a little while before dinner was finished.Hao Ren followed Zi upstairs to get started with tutoring. At the same time, Zhao Guang and Zhao Hongyu stayed downstairs to discuss a few more things.Zhao Yanzi\u2019s pouted her mouth as soon as they got into her room.Having ignored her attitude, Hao Ren took the books out and said, \u201cWe are still focusing on English today, and you will learn the difference between \u2018to\u2019 and \u2018for\u2019 and when they should be used.\u201dZhao Yanzi rested her arms on the desk and her chin on her hand, not focused at all; she didn\u2019t look energetic in her blue uniform.Hao Ren figured that this must be her usual position in class since her grades were so bad.\u201cListen carefully because this is very important and useful on tests,\u201d Hao Ren knocked on the desk with his finger.Zhao Yanzi was still not cooperating; her little mouth was puffing, and she was absent-minded today.\u201cWhat is this face? You are not going to pay attention anymore because the exams are over?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cMy foot is still hurting from your grab yesterday!\u201d Zhou Yanzi suddenly shouted at him.\u201cIs it? Well, your bite marks are still on my arm too,\u201d Hao Ren rolled up his sleeve and showed her.\u201cYou deserved that,\u201d Zhao Yanzi growled.\u201cOh, so I should just let you kick me and do nothing about it?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cWell, last night you\u2026\u201d her face blushed as she stopped mid-sentence.Hao Ren remembered last night and looked down at her feet. She was wearing white student socks, and her lower legs showed a slight curve. It wasn\u2019t showy, but the shape of her legs was pretty.Seeing Hao Ren\u2019s eyes moving down, Zhao Yanzi screamed out loud again, \u201cYou are still looking!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you wearing it for people to look at?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cPervert!\u201d Zhao Yanzi threw her fist at Hao Ren.He caught her little fist and laughed, \u201cAlright, I won\u2019t mess with you anymore. Let\u2019s start.\u201dHowever, Zhao Yanzi stared at him and said, \u201cYou apologize first!\u201dHao Ren kept on laughing with her fist in his hand.\u201cYou sneaked a peek at my legs yesterday. Apologize for it!\u201d Zhao Yanzi went on; she looked just like a sassy girlfriend.\u201cOk, ok, ok, I shouldn\u2019t have checked your legs out,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cAre you sorry?\u201d Zhao Yanzi wasn\u2019t ready to let it slide.Hao Ren sighed, \u201cI am sorry.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more like it!\u201d Zhao Yanzi took her fist back, but she still squinted her eyes in anger.Hao Ren couldn\u2019t help but laugh at this little girl who had been upset about it all day.\u201cI\u2019ll just check out your smooth legs\u2026later on\u2026\u201d Hao Ren stopped his thoughts right there. It would make him a pervert if he kept on thinking about it.\u201cThe lesson for today is the difference between prepositions \u2018to\u2019 and \u2018for\u2019 and when they are used with a subject,\u201d Hao Ren opened his book and carried on with the lesson.However, Zhao Yanzi stood up all of a sudden and ran out of the room.\u201cWhat is this girl doing? She is trying to piss me off on purpose\u2026\u201d Hao Ren was a bit mad because she interrupted him twice in a roll.Zhao Yanzi rushed back into the room just when Hao Ren was about to go out to find her; she almost ran into his arms.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Hao Ren asked as he sat back at the desk after Zhao Yanzi.\u201cHere!\u201d she threw something in front of Hao Ren.Hao Ren took a look and realized it was a band-aid. He asked in confusion, \u201cWhat are you giving me this for?\u201d\u201cFor your wound, stupid!\u201d Zhao Yanzi said rudely.\u201cI have your bite marks everywhere, and there is only one band-aid,\u201d Hao Ren glimpsed at her.\u201cIt\u2019s for this!\u201d Zhao Yanzi sounded even more upset as she pointed at Hao Ren\u2019s left elbow.Hao Ren lifted his arm but didn\u2019t see the injury. He touched where he couldn\u2019t see with his right hand and felt the pain.\u201cThere is indeed a wound here\u2026\u201d Hao Ren thought, \u201cNot sure if I got injured during rock climbing or got scratched while I was playing basketball today.\u201dHe looked down at the band-aid on the desk and said to Zhao Yanzi, \u201cThanks.\u201dShe turned her head away as her little pigtails wiggled, \u201cHumph!\u201dHao Ren laughed again. He ripped open the band-aid and tried to put it on his wound.However, it was not easy to put it on precisely at such a blind spot. He tried to stick it on with his right hand while bending the left elbow. Since he couldn\u2019t see anything, he could only rely on his touch. Hao Ren failed after a few times, looking like a gorilla that was scratching itself.\u201cStupid!\u201d Zhao Yanzi couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. She took the band-aid and put it on his wound in no time.\u201cCould have offered the help a long time ago,\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.However, he was still a little touch by the band-aid she got for him; she brought it over as soon as she noticed the wound.The only problem was the cartoon pattern on this pink band-aid. He decided not to bother since it would be hidden under his sleeve.\u201cNow, we are going to talk about the prepositions \u2018to\u2019 and\u2026\u201d Hao Ren continued with his class, and Zhao Yanzi finally calmed down and started taking notes.Her grades were terrible, but her handwriting was pretty nice to look at.After an hour, Zhao Guang came in to get Hao Ren and ask how it was going. Since Zhao Hongyu was working on her design in the attic, Zhao Guang led Hao Ren into the next room; the smell of bug repellent was gone.Zhao Guang asked him some details regarding his cultivation.Hao Ren\u2019s proficiency in practicing the Spirit Concentration Scroll had become better and better. However, breaking through was not just a matter of proficiency.Zhao Guang took some time to answer Hao Ren\u2019s questions on cultivation. After having gotten Zhao Guang, Premier Xia, and Su Han\u2019s instructions as well as Lu Qing\u2019s caring advice, Hao Ren was able to grasp more and more critical points in cultivating the Spirit Concentration Scroll. He could gather ideas from all of them and have them support each other.Not just anyone could have the opportunity to get help from these four masters; especially when it was only on a basic technique like this. Hao Ren\u2019s sincere eagerness to learn was one of the reasons why they were all willing to teach him everything they knew.It was almost nine o\u2019clock after Zhao Guang\u2019s tutoring section, and Hao Ren\u2019s comprehension towards the Spirit Concentration Scroll reached another level.He went back into Zhao Yanzi\u2019s room and found her doing her homework. She had already changed into her pajamas, which made her look pretty cute.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHao Ren picked up the books and asked her, \u201cYou\u2026did badly on the exams?\u201dHe wanted to ask her this question for a long time, but he held it back until he was leaving.\u201cIf I did badly, then you must be a bad teacher,\u201d she lifted her head and said.Hao Ren shook his head and smiled as he left her room. Hao Ren didn\u2019t want Zhao Guang to give him a ride to school; instead, he insisted on taking the bus.\u201cIf she did well, then it must have been her own hard work. I\u2019m doing such a thankless task,\u201d Hao Ren thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Oh, don\u2019t wait for me tomorrow night since I need to go home,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cHow much do you make tutoring each month?\u201d Zhao Jiayi asked.\u201cSeveral hundred yuan,\u201d Hao Ren made it up.\u201cQuit tutoring so that you can play basketball with me every evening! We will be the best partners on the court!\u201d Zhao Jiayi urged excitedly.\u201cSorry, Point Guard, but you are on your own,\u201d Hao Ren picked up his washbasin and bonked it lightly on Zhao Jiayi\u2019s belly before going down the hallway to wash up in the public bathroom.At half past five the next morning, Zhao Jiayi jumped up and woke up Hao Ren who was on the upper berth.Opening his eyes drowsily, Hao Ren found the energetic Zhao Jiayi standing before him. He knew the latter must not have slept due to the excitement.\u201cTime to go! We will be late if you don\u2019t hurry!\u201d Zhao Jiayi urged.Roused by Zhao Jiayi\u2019s tugging, Hao Ren had no choice but to get up. Cao Ronghua and Zhou Liren were also woken up by the commotion and forced themselves to get up.To their surprise, the guys in the nearby dorms had also got up.\u201cGeeze! It\u2019s only half past five!\u201d Hao Ren was astonished.\u201cLet\u2019s go and watch Zhao Jiayi and Hao Ren practice!\u201d Yu Rong called, walking out from his dorm in a pair of shorts.\u201cF*ck! There is nothing to watch!\u201d Zhao Jiayi yelled.\u201cWe won\u2019t watch you, Ugly. We\u2019d like to see Xie Yujia play!\u201d Huang Jianfeng yelled back.Hao Ren began to sweat after understanding the reason why the guys had dragged themselves out of bed at such an early hour.After stumbling around and finally washing up in the bathroom, they rushed toward the school\u2019s main gate. It was the first time that they rushed out of the Dorm Building as soon as it was unlocked.Xie Wanjun was already waiting at the gate with the guys from the Basketball Team. He looked down at his watch while counting down the seconds.Zhao Jiayi, who had been chatting with Yu Rong and the others, dashed toward them.\u201cThree!\u201d Zhao Jiayi was before Xie Wanjun when the latter counted down to two.\u201cIf you are late, you don\u2019t have to join us in the future,\u201d Xie Wanjun said with a stern expression. Then, he turned to the other teammates and said, \u201cBegin the morning jogging!\u201dWith steady steps, he began to run while the others followed him uniformly.Looking at shame-faced Zhao Jiayi, Yu Rong predicted, \u201cWorking under such a strict guy, I think Zhao Jiayi\u2019s good days are over.\u201dHao Ren chuckled before crossing the campus to the basketball court near the stadium. Yu Rong and other nosy guys followed him closely to watch them practice.When Hao Ren came to the basketball court, he found Xie Yujia who was in a pair of sports shorts and a white sports t-shirt was already practicing. Her bike was parked outside of the court.She was a bit surprised at the sight of the large group of guys. Hao Ren walked over and scratched his head in embarrassment, \u201cThey\u2026are determined to come and watch.\u201dXie Yujia\u2019s pretty eyes blinked, and she remained silent. With her hair tied into a long ponytail, she looked extraordinarily vibrant and youthful.Her white sneakers showcased her white ankles which were even whiter than the shoes. The color of her skin fit the description of 'snow white\u201d.Huang Jianfeng and others, who had rarely crossed paths with the Class President, were starry-eyed when they looked at the vibrant Xie Yujia at such close range.They had seen Xie Yujia in class, but they had never imagined that the dignified girl could be so athletic.\u201cHave you had breakfast?\u201d ignoring the admiring stares, Xie Yujia asked Hao Ren.\u201cNot yet. We came directly from the dorms, and the cafeteria isn\u2019t open yet,\u201d Hao Ren answered.\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Xie Yujia nodded and ran to her bike. She lifted a bag from the basket and handed it to Hao Ren. \u201cI got up early and bought some Baozi 1 ,\u201d she said.Hao Ren was amazed.\u201cYou should eat them so that you will have the strength to practice. I\u2019ve already eaten,\u201d Xie Yujia pushed the buns toward him.\u201cClass President! We want to eat Baozi, too!\u201d Huang Jianfeng yelled.\u201cThose are the last three Baozi. Besides, you are not here for practice!\u201d Xie Yujia said, turning to look at them.\u201cWe want to practice, too!\u201d They continued with their demands.Xie Yujia turned to face Hao Ren and ignored them.\u201cClass President, ignore them,\u201d Hao Ren was exasperated. After eating the Baozi, he immediately felt better.\u201cOk. You warm up a bit, and then I\u2019ll show you how to play,\u201d Xie Yujia nodded at Hao Ren briskly.Hao Ren nodded, though he still felt uncomfortable letting a girl show him how to play basketball.While Hao Ren was warming up, Xie Yujia picked up the orange basketball from the ground. \u201cI\u2019ll show you one of the basics, dribble. Dribble is more than bouncing the ball,\u201d she said.Xie Yujia bent her back and kept low, moving her left arm before her body in defense while her right hand pushed down the basketball deftly. The ball bounced up immediately, and Xie Yujia followed the momentum and held the ball in her palm before pushing the ball back down with a standard move of her wrist.The movements were as smooth as exercising Tai Chi in the water. Except for the slower speed, the movements were almost as professional as those of the basketball players who were broadcasted on TV.Seeing the stunned expressions of Yu Rong and the other guys, Hao Ren was no longer shameful for learning basketball from a girl. The Class President was a basketball expert in disguise!\u201cBut, wait\u2026 What are the guys staring at?\u201dHao Ren found their expressions quite weird and followed their gazes. It was not the basketball they were staring at but the low neckline of her t-shirt when she bent over to dribble the ball.Beneath the white t-shirt, a portion of her white skin and even a part of the contour of her beautiful chest were exposed!Hao Ren immediately blocked her from their view.\u201cUr\u2026\u201d He pointed at Xie Yujia\u2019s chest and murmured, \u201cYour\u2026neckline.\u201dLooking down at her neckline, Xie Yujia yelled in embarrassment. She stood straight immediately as she placed her left hand on the loose neckline of her t-shirt.Her face reddened immediately. In the misty morning, her blush looked especially distinct and pretty.\u201cRen, where are your morals!\u201d Yu Rong and the others shouted indignantly.Hearing their shameless yells, Xie Yujia\u2019s face fell, and she bit her lip instinctively.\u201cWell, well, get out of here! Don\u2019t piss off the Class President!\u201d Hao Ren walked over to kick them away.Yu Rong and other guys were driven out of the basketball court while still protesting; their view would be less clear through the fences.Hao Ren returned to the court and said to Xie Yujia, \u201cI drove them off. Class President, let\u2019s continue.\u201d\u201cOk,\u201d Xie Yujia was still pink in the face, but she continued, \u201cThe dribble\u2026 Uh, where was I?\u201d\u201cYou said that dribbling is not as simple as bouncing the ball, and then you showed me the movements,\u201d Hao Ren said.Seeing Xie Yujia was still uncomfortable, Hao Ren continued, \u201cClass President, you just show me the moves. I won\u2019t let my eyes wander to the places they shouldn\u2019t.\u201dHearing his placating words, Xie Yujia turned even redder, berating herself silently for neglecting the neckline of the t-shirt while bending to dribble the ball. In fact, she had purposefully chosen a t-shirt with a smaller neckline, but the guys apparently had sharper eyes than she anticipated.While Hao Ren was trying to comfort her, he thought to himself, \u201cYu Rong and the guys are really bad for daring to peek at the Class President. Now, the view is only for my eyes.\u201dIf Yu Rong, who was standing far away outside of the court, had known Hao Ren\u2019s thoughts, he would have rushed in and given Hao Ren a good beating for being such a hypocrite.Xie Yujia lifted up the neckline of her t-shirt before bending again and explaining, \u201cI\u2019ll show you the correct dribbling position. Keep your feet apart at a comfortable distance and bend your knees slightly. Lean your body forward and keep your head up to observe the situation on the court. Then, raise your left elbow to protect the ball.\u201dXie Yujia demonstrated while explaining the key points.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDuring the process, Hao Ren watched the movements of her hands and feet and the white skin exposed at her neckline. Although he saw Xie Yujia\u2019s neckline had loosened again, he kept his mind on the dribbling movement of her arms.Afterward, Xie Yujia handed the ball to Hao Ren for him to practice. She moved his wrists and lowered his back to get him into the right position.Xie Yujia looked natural guiding him, but Hao Ren was uncomfortable with this pretty girl standing close to him and sliding her smooth palms along his wrist. When he wasn\u2019t following her instructions, she even moved her arm against his to correct his moves.She was Hao Ren\u2019s beautiful private coach.\u201cDespicable! Shameless!\u201d standing outside of the fence, Yu Rong and the guys watched the intimate contact between Xie Yujia and Hao Ren on the basketball court more than ten meters away. They were burning with envy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99: Off-Limit Translator: Noodletown Translated Editor: Noodletown TranslatedFrom six o\u2019clock to seven o\u2019clock, Hao Ren finally understood how to dribble under Xie Yujia\u2019s earnest instructions.He had never played basketball except for the occasions when he was dragged to the court by Zhao Jiayi. However, when he was in middle school, he had been a member of the Track and Field Team and was close with the Soccer Team. He had often acted as their temporary goalkeeper and thus was not a stranger to balls.Despite the chilliness of the morning wind, Xie Yujia began to sweat while jogging around Hao Ren to get him into the correct positions.Covered with a thin layer of sweat, she looked even more alluring. Her fit and beautiful figure attracted Hao Ren\u2019s gaze while he was practicing how to dribble. After all, Xie Yujia had told him not to stare at the ball but to observe the movements on the court. Currently, Xie Yujia was the only person on the court.Xie Yujia blushed at his stare, and she went behind him to correct his posture.\u201cClass President, I\u2019ve dribbled for an hour now, and my arms are sore. When can I learn something else?\u201d Hao Ren turned to look at her before asking.\u201cWe are practicing the standing dribble which is the simplest technique, and we\u2019ll turn to dribble while running after a while. Why are you so impatient?\u201d Xie Yujia snorted and lectured Hao Ren like a coach.\u201cChange to your right hand!\u201d She instructed.Immediately, Hao Ren changed the ball to his right hand and resumed dribbling.\u201cGood,\u201d Xie Yujia nodded approvingly and said, \u201cNow, I\u2019ll show you the running dribble. The match is next week, so I won\u2019t have time to teach you cross-overs. It will be enough if you master the speed dribble.\u201dShe stole the ball from Hao Ren and ran to mid-court after a series of dizzying dribbling movements around Hao Ren.\u201cLook carefully! The key to the running dribble is the coordination between your hands and feet. You must not travel with the ball. The faster you move, the farther back the ball will be, and the greater force you will need to apply. When you are traveling in a straight line, you usually dribble once every two steps.\u201dHao Ren admired Xie Yujia\u2019s vigorous figure in her white t-shirt and the sway of her long ponytail. Thinking back to how easily she stole the ball from him, Hao Ren was ashamed of himself.After looking around, he found that Yu Rong and the guys had left. It was not surprising since they could only watch Xie Yujia from afar and could not interact with her. One hour of that would make the drowsy guys bored.Clap! Clap\u2026 Xie Yujia dribbled the ball back to Hao Ren from mid-court. It was quite enjoyable to watch her beautiful white legs running in the white sneakers.Suddenly, someone whistled at Xie Yujia from outside of the court.Hao Ren turned and saw the Basketball Team led by Xie Wanjun was passing the wired fence of the court. Some of the team members saw the pretty Xie Yujia playing basketball and couldn\u2019t help but to whistle to show their appreciation.\u201cIt seems like not all the players know that she is Xie Wanjun\u2019s younger sister,\u201d Hao Ren thought.Xie Wanjun stopped suddenly and pointed at the guys who had whistled. \u201cEach of you, do 50 push-ups here and now!\u201d he shouted.Then, he entered the open basketball court in Zone B and walked up to Xie Yujia and Hao Ren. He asked, \u201cHow was the practice?\u201d\u201cVery good! He is a quick learner,\u201d Xie Yujia answered immediately.Taking the ball from Xie Yujia\u2019s hand, Xie Wanjun turned abruptly and dribbled the ball at lightning speed to the net before jumping up and dunking it with a bang!Outside the court, Zhao Jiayi gaped at the scene. He had been jogging for an hour and was soaked in sweat, but he rallied again when he witnessed Xie Wanjun\u2019s masterful show of skill and strength.\u201cGet back to your drill.\u201d Xie Wanjun caught the ball and tossed it to Hao Ren.Hao Ren caught the ball and was at a loss for words.Walking out of the court, Xie Wanjun turned to the guys who were still obediently doing push-ups and slapped them on their heads one by one. \u201cShe is my younger sister. If any of you dares to whistle at her in the future, you will do 200 push-ups for it. Now get up and run to the stadium to start training!\u201d he said.Then, he jogged with the team into the stadium. Zhao Jiayi, who was at the end of the line, turned to look at Hao Ren in the open basketball court and waved his arms at him in encouragement.\u201cJust ignore my brother; he\u2019s just showing his muscles. Let\u2019s get back to our practice.\u201d Xie Yujia took the ball from Hao Ren and dribbled it like a professional player.Then, she showed Hao Ren high dribble, low dribble, dribble block, and dribble turn\u2026 Hao Ren admired her thorough and professional manner. He was surprised that this well-behaved and Tri-Merit student was also good at basketball.Xie Yujia didn\u2019t stop the morning session until 8:30 AM when some students passed the court on their way to their classes. Xie Yujia picked up the basketball and said, \u201cWell, we\u2019re done now. It\u2019s time for class.\u201dShe looked quite cool tucking the ball underneath her arm. Against the green shades, she was like the cover girl on a fashion magazine.\u201cGood. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Slightly panting, Hao Ren nodded and showed his agreement. After all, it would be difficult for a strong person to practice dribbling for two hours without rest while carrying over 25 kilograms on each wrist.Walking out of the court, Xie Yujia put the basketball into the basket on her bike. Then, she walked over to Hao Ren and asked, \u201cI brought the books for today\u2019s morning classes with me. Don\u2019t you need to go back and get your books?\u201d\u201cNo! We as guys never use books in class!\u201d Hao Ren waved his hand.Exasperated, Xie Yujia shook her head and replied, \u201cOk then. I will return the basketball to my brother before we go to the cafeteria for breakfast. Then, we can head to the class.\u201dShe rode the bike to the stadium nearby. Soon, she returned with an empty basket to the exit of the basketball court at Zone B.\u201cLet\u2019s head to the cafeteria!\u201d Xie Yujia beckoned at Hao Ren.\u201cYou will carry me on your bike?\u201d Hao Ren was surprised.\u201cYeah! I can carry people!\u201d Xie Yujia nodded and said, \u201cJump on!\u201dGrinning, Hao Ren scratched his head. He ran to the back seat and jumped onto it lightly.He had thought that Xie Yujia couldn\u2019t handle his weight on the bike. To his surprise, she adjusted the position of the paddles and rode steadily forward.Now, Hao Ren was in a dilemma. He had thought that Xie Yujia would have to give up and let him ride, but he underestimated her and had to be carried on the back seat to the cafeteria by a girl.Hao Ren kept his feet close to the wheel and cautiously placed his hands around Xie Yujia\u2019s waist. He had meant to grip the seat, but it was too small. If he were not careful, he would accidentally touch her.Xie Yujia was silent on the way. It was her first time carrying a boy on her bike. It was an impulsive act, but it was okay since there weren\u2019t many students on campus yet.They went into Green Hill Cafeteria and lined up to buy breakfast. Hao Ren had offered to treat the Class President to a meal to thank her for teaching him how to play basketball, and Xie Yujia gladly accepted it.While Xie Yujia waited in line with Hao Ren, many guys glanced at her openly or secretly.This was not surprising. In a sports t-shirt, Xie Yujia\u2019s gorgeous figure, pretty face, outstanding temperament, and vibrant energy were too tempting to resist.Ignoring the admiring glances, Xie Yujia got her breakfast with Hao Ren and sat down with him to eat.Seeing Hao Ren\u2019s ordinary clothes and looks, the guys were jealous of him and wondered how a plain guy like him attracted such a pretty girl.After breakfast, Xie Yujia and Hao Ren walked out of the cafeteria. Coming and going together, they indeed looked like a student couple.\u201cClass President, you go ahead and bike to the Academic Building. I\u2019ll walk,\u201d Hao Ren said when Xie Yujia went over to her bike.\u201cWell, ok.\u201d After a moment of consideration, Xie Yujia rode the bike toward the Academic Building. She knew Hao Ren was afraid that the girls in the class would gossip about them if they were seen on a bike together.Hao Ren looked after Xie Yujia\u2019s figure and thought, \u201cEven on a 100-yuan bike, a pretty girl like her can still make such a beautiful scene.\u201d\u201cHey!\u201d Hao Ren was suddenly disturbed by a loud yell.He turned and saw Zhao Jiayi standing behind him, covered in sweat.\u201cDamn! What are you doing here?\u201d Hao Ren asked.\u201cI\u2019ve been here for a while. I saw you in the cafeteria but didn\u2019t want to interrupt you guys,\u201d Zhao Jiayi said while wiping the sweat off of his forehead.\u201cThere is nothing between the Class President and me!\u201d Hao Ren turned and walked toward the Academic Building.Zhao Jiayi walked along with him. He threw an arm around Hao Ren\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cNothing? Do you think I\u2019m blind? Xie Yujia rode the bike, and you sat on the back seat. You\u2019re really good at this. How come no pretty girl is carrying me on a bike?\u201d\u201cYou saw it?\u201d Hao Ren asked him.\u201cOf course. I just finished the practice and was about to head to class when I saw you guys. Damn! I chased you guys halfway here, but neither of you heard me calling.\u201dImagining Zhao Jiayi chasing them in sweat while they rode forward breezily, Hao Ren felt sorry for Zhao Jiayi.Zhao Jiayi bumped Hao Ren with his brawny hip. \u201cGo for her! It seems like Xie Wanjun willing to let you pursue his sister,\u201d he said.\u201cWell. Not now.\u201d Hao Ren threw off his sweaty arm.In class, everyone had known that Xie Yujia was Xie Wanjun\u2019s younger sister, and it became a hot topic among the students in the classroom.The guys who had been secretly admiring Xie Yujia lamented about the surprising news while silently giving up their plans to pursue her. They congratulated themselves for not acting rashly.After all, it would take more than an ordinary guy to handle the sister of such an influential figure.Now, the girls understood why the overbearing Lin Li from Class Three wasn\u2019t able to do anything to Xie Yujia; it was because Xie Yujia\u2019s brother was a figure who was more powerful than Huang Xujie!After the Mechanical Drawing Class, Xie Yujia packed up her stuff, ignored the glances cast her way, and walked out of the classroom with her good friend and dormmate Ma Lina.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHer ponytail swayed innocently, but in other people\u2019s eyes, she was no longer an ordinary Class President.The gossip spread to other classes when the guys at school began to talk about how Zhao Jiayi, who was only 1.7 meters tall, had suddenly joined the basketball team. It seemed like guys could gossip just as well as girls.Thanks to Hao Ren, Zhao Jiayi was famous; he was in such high spirits that he didn\u2019t care about the nature of the gossips. He just couldn\u2019t wait for next week\u2019s match to begin.However, Hao Ren remained calm the whole day. After his afternoon classes, he went back to the dorm to change before taking the bus to LingZhao Middle School.He didn\u2019t care about all the gossip at the school since tonight\u2019s Parent-Teacher Meeting was his top priority\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Sitting on the rickety bus, Hao Ren leaned his arm against the window and rested his head on his palm. His gaze fell on the band-aid on his elbow.He tore it off and saw only a small trace of blood on it, which meant the wound was not at all serious. After looking at the cartoon of a pig on the other side of the band-aid, Hao Ren was amused.Hao Ren was reluctant to toss away this memorable little thing after playing with the band-aid in his hands for a couple of minutes. On second thought, it would be weird to keep such a thing, so he tossed it into the dustbin on the bus.\u201cActually, this little girl isn\u2019t too bad to me\u2026\u201d Hao Ren thought.The bus arrived at LingZhao Middle School, and Hao Ren got off the bus and found that it was ten to six. Many cars were lined up along the street on both sides of the school gate, and parents were hurrying toward the school.Afraid of being late, Hao Ren also hurried toward the gate. However, a middle-school girl stopped him. \u201cHey, we have Parent-Teacher Meetings happening today, and only parents can come in,\u201d she said.\u201cI\u2019m here for a Parent-Teacher Meeting,\u201d Hao Ren said.The girl looked at him suspiciously and asked, \u201cWhose parent are you?\u201dAlthough some parents of middle-schoolers were quite young, they were not as young as Hao Ren.\u201cZhao Yanzi from Class Two in Eighth Grade. I\u2019m her brother, and I\u2019m here to represent her parents who are too busy to come to the meeting today,\u201d Hao Ren answered. He had made up the story on the bus.\u201cOk.\u201d The girl nodded before lowering her arm to let Hao Ren in.\u201cIs Zhao Yanzi this well-known in her school?\u201d Hao Ren thought while walking on campus.LingZhao Middle School was one of the best middle schools in East Ocean City. The campus was very large and beautiful with rockeries, an Artificial Lake, modern Academic Buildings, a Stadium, and classical-style Art Museum, and a Music Hall. It looked like a multi-functional park.Since many of the students were kids from wealthy families or political families, the security of the school was tight, and no one could enter without permission. Hao Ren grew up in East Ocean City, but it was his first time stepping into this famous middle school.In fact, there were two departments in the school, a High School Department and a Middle School Department. Except for the shared Stadium, Art Museum, and Music hall, the departments each had their own facilities including Academic Buildings, and they were divided by the Artificial Lake which ran across the campus.Following the direction signs, Hao Ren had no trouble finding the Academic Building of the Middle School Department. The classes of the Eighth Grade were on the second floor, and Hao Ren walked up the stairs and followed the class signs down the hall before finally spotting Class Two.There were many parents who were either resting with their eyes closed or talking to each other in the classroom, and Hao Ren attracted a lot of attention since he was too young.On each desk, there was a slip of paper with the student\u2019s name on it. Hao Ren spotted Zhao Yanzi\u2019s name on a desk in the second row, so he walked over, pulled out the chair, and sat down.The man sitting next to him was a man in his forties, and Hao Ren nodded at him in greeting.He looked around the classroom. There were the teaching platform and the whiteboard in the front, and a smaller whiteboard with the students\u2019 articles posted on it was located on the back wall.However, the teaching platform in the front was bigger than what Hao Ren was used to seeing, and he was new to whiteboards and colored markers as well since his middle school used blackboards and chalks.The desks and chairs were made of metal and were brand-new. Hao Ren noticed a small metal name tag on the upper right corner of the desk, and Zhao Yanzi\u2019s name was written on it.\u201cThe students have their own set of desks and chairs. No wonder the desks are kept so clean\u2026 How come no one thought of this method in our time\u2026\u201d Hao Ren thought to himself.Hao Ren suddenly had a weird feeling about it when thinking about how Zhao Yanzi sat in this chair in class. He imagined Zhao Yanzi sitting here facing the whiteboard while the teacher was giving a lesson, exchanging glances with Ling who sat close to her, and passing slips of paper to communicate with her best friend when talking wasn\u2019t allowed. There were probably some boys messing with each other when the teacher wasn\u2019t looking while some boys glanced secretly at the girls they liked. Some of the boys sitting in the back row probably played with the braids of the girls sitting in front of them, and the girls probably turn around to roll their eyes\u2026\u2026Imagining the scenes in the class, Hao Ren glanced at the name tag on the desk next to Zhao Yanzi\u2019s and found that it was a girl\u2019s name.\u201cWell, Zhao Yanzi\u2019s neighbor is a girl\u2026\u201d Hao Ren was relieved before he caught himself, \u201cWhat am I thinking about?\u201dWhile he was looking around, a middle-aged woman in a suit came into the classroom and stepped onto the platform with a binder tucked under her arm.\u201cGood evening, parents! I\u2019m Luo Ying, the Class Advisor of Class Two of the Eighth Grade,\u201d she introduced herself. Suddenly, she spotted a young man sitting in the classroom and asked suspiciously, \u201cAnd you are\u2026\u201d\u201cOh. I\u2019m Zhao Yanzi\u2019s older brother. Her parents are busy and asked me to come in their place,\u201d Hao Ren said.\u201cSince you are her older brother, aren\u2019t her parents your parents, too?\u201d The experienced Class Advisor immediately caught the loophole in Hao Ren\u2019s words.She suspected that Zhao Yanzi, embarrassed about her low scores, had asked a random person to attend the Parent-Teacher Meeting. Some students had done such things before; one student from the Middle School Department had asked a student from the High School Department to act as his parent. The teachers were smarter than the students after all, and both of those students ended up being punished.\u201cOh, I mean I\u2019m her cousin!\u201d Fortunately, Hao Ren quickly thought of an explanation.\u201cA cousin in the Parent-Teacher Meeting\u2026\u201d Luo Ying was displeased, but she didn\u2019t pursue the topic. After all, the other parents were waiting for the meeting to begin.\u201cThe main purpose of today\u2019s Parent-Teacher Meeting is to announce the midterm examination scores. As you all know, the kids are now in the Eight Grade and will soon be entering the Nine Grade. We must prepare them for it since the Ninth Grade performances depend on their Eighth Grade performances a lot. They must build a solid foundation for\u2026\u201d Luo Ying began her speech to the parents.Sitting in the chair, Hao Ren saw the parents around him listening attentively, and he followed suit, putting on his serious face. However, he knew the Class Advisor was giving a cut and dry speech, and the purpose was to urge the parents to keep a sharp eye on their kids\u2019 studies.It was Hao Ren\u2019s first time acting as a parent. Seeing the anxiety on the parents\u2019 faces, Hao Ren suddenly thought that he would be one of them one day.\u201cSome of you have the mistaken impression that you don\u2019t have to worry about your children\u2019s academic performances since they could go to the High School Department as long as they have passable scores. In fact, children\u2019s performances in the Middle School Department will decide their academic levels in high school, which in turn will decide which university they can enter\u2026\u201d Luo Ying continued her speech.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUnlike the other parents, Hao Ren got bored. He lowered his head and began to quietly run through the stuff stored in the drawer of Zhao Yanzi\u2019s desk.There was a bottle of half-empty drink, half a bag of chips, and some unopened bags of dried fruits. Also, there was some girly stuff besides the snacks including a nail clipper.\u201cThis girl even stores food in her desk.\u201d Hao Ren pushed those things aside and tried to find out what was behind them.Luo Ying, who was familiar with students\u2019 little tricks, had immediately seen Hao Ren\u2019s act. However, she swallowed back her reprimand and continued her speech for the other parents.\u201cUmm, this is\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Hao Ren hit on something intriguingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
