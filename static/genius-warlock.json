    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1The 19th century was called the Age of Magic and Industry.Humanity has developed by leaps and bounds.The forests were cleared, railroads were laid, airships were in the sky, and cars were circulating in the streets.Did it end here?NOThe economy developed, the population exploded, and numerous colonies were established.Some said \u2014This was the golden age of mankind, and yet some places were alienated.This was the case with the mining town right here.This is a village, which doesn\u2019t even have a proper name.It is a place where minerals come out, and it was a place where people at the bottom of the social pyramid gathered, and of course, at the bottom of them were the children.Most of the children here were orphans who had similar backgrounds.They didn\u2019t know who their father and mother were, and they were raised until the age of 14 by the government subsidies, after which they were sold to the mining village here in the name of employment and independence.It was illegal, but no one cared. Because this was very common here.Perhaps because of that, the appearance of the children all looked alike.A face that has turned black from mining, lifeless eyes, and a skinny body.It may be too much to say, but they were more like cogs or screws in human form rather than human beings.It\u2019s as if they were squeezed to the limit and were broken to the point, if they were to be squeezed a bit more then they\u2019ll get sick and die.Like the saying \u2018Nature provides an exception to every rule\u2019, even in this place there was a strange child.This child\u2019s name was Oliver.There was nothing special about him but still he was a little bizarre.No, it was more than that.Oliver, who was smaller and thinner than the other children, had pale skin.He was reminiscent of a living corpse, and he was an ugly child that no one would think of as strange if he died right away tomorrow.However, that was ironically the proof that Oliver was bizarre.It was three years and four months from now when Oliver got sold to this mine, at that time he was hated by the manager, so he couldn\u2019t get to eat properly, so he was much more miserable than he is now.Seeing such a soggy child, all of them expected that he would die in less than three months, some even started betting on when he would die.In fact, Oliver fell ill, less than a week after his arrival to the mine.His condition was so serious that he couldn\u2019t even breathe properly and his body boiled like a kettle.But to everyone\u2019s surprise, Oliver miraculously recovered when they were preparing to dig a place to bury him.Rather, the other children, who were fine until the day before, suddenly fell ill and died.And that wasn\u2019t the end.Oliver had many other oddities that cannot be properly explained.It was difficult to avoid the angry supervisor, but Oliver was strangely quick to notice the change and was able to avoid being the supervisor\u2019s target.Even if he was the target of harassment by bullying, he luckily escapes quickly, with the perpetrator dying of illness.In addition, the fierce guard dog watching over the children was especially scared in front of Oliver, and the rats disappeared one by one in the places wherever Oliver worked or slept.These strange phenomena overlapped, and resulted in Oliver being alienated, and treated as an ominous object by everyone.But Oliver, the concerned party, did not care about these at all.His interest wasn\u2019t to be friends with anyone or to be loved by anyone.Currently, Oliver only wanted to survive as long as he could in this Mine.There was no clear purpose.It was just an obsession with life.He was similar to ants and mites who are all struggling to live.Oliver was raised in an orphanage and then was raised in a Mine, had nothing other than survival in his mind.However, his survival was greeted with a change one day due to a sudden visitor.PUANG PUANG PUANG PUANGAt the time of work, there was the sound of an alarm that shouldn\u2019t have sounded.The children, who worked in the stuffy coal mine without a trace of sunlight, looked up with difficulty, and only Oliver, who was mining in the corner, was working without paying any attention.After a while, a fat man came down on the rusty ladder.It was the supervisor who supervised the children.\u201cAttention! Attention, everyone! Gather outside right now!\u201dA black-faced child asked with a frightened look.\u201cOh, supervisor? What\u2019s going on\u2026?\u201d\u201d A visitor came in after a long time. They say he\u2019s looking for a sincere hard worker, so come out and greet him! Hurry, hurry, move! Come on!\u201dAt the supervisor\u2019s word a faint smile flashed across the faces of the children who had a dead expression.Why?It\u2019s because if they got chosen, they could get out of this hell.It was a kind of irregular event.This was their only hope in this hopeless Mine.The children stopped what they were doing and climbed up to the ground on a rusty ladder.TANG TANGThe sound of the ladder rang, and there was a small commotion as everyone pushed each other in order to climb up first.Only Oliver got away from the commotion as he was watching them from below.He felt that there was no particular reason to rush like others.Whether it is his emotions that are dead or his soul that is broken, Oliver has never felt any emotions such as joy, expectation, or hope ever since he was born.That\u2019s why he was so calm, and he did know \u2014maybe it was thanks to this that he still survived.Because for him, false hope was poison.The strong children were the first to climb above the ladder, and the rest of the weak children climbed the ladder following them.And of course, it was Oliver who came in last, so he got the worst seat in the last corner.\u201cOh, it\u2019s dazzling\u2026\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019m going to live a little longer.\u201d\u201cCough cough.\u201dChildren who saw the sun after a long time chattered with excitement.Even the sunlight was a luxury in the coal mine.Meanwhile, a muscular man appeared in front of the children.He was the tyrant who was in charge of the mines in these fields.He had a cigarette in his mouth and was accompanied by his fierce guard dog, and he spoke in an arrogant manner.\u201cShut Up, everybody, be quiet. Don\u2019t make a fuss in front of the customer.\u201dThe dog barked furiously.The children were frightened and united among themselves, only Oliver stood calmly.Then a man appeared quietly.\u201cAttention, everyone! This is the customer who came to visit us today. He needs sincere and talented workers. So everyone, be silent.\u201dThe children closed their mouths as if they had made a promise not to open them and rolled their eyes to look at the man called a customer.The man was middle-aged, with a benevolent expression and a well-groomed mustache, and he seemed quite rich in his neat coat and heavy hat.This could be a good sign \u2013 A nice-looking, wealthy man who could take them anywhere better than here.But he looked a little different in Oliver\u2019s eyes.The supervisor spoke to the customer.\u201cDo you want me to recommend some children?\u201dThe workers who usually behaved nicely to the supervisor smiled faintly.But the customer shook his head.\u201cNo, I would like to pick one by myself.\u201dThe customer then pulled something out of his coat.Surprisingly, it was chocolate.\u2018Chocolate!\u2019The children, who had been watching only chocolate wrappers all their lives, were excited.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dThe customer spoke first.All the children tilted their heads.\u2018What is that? Does he think we don\u2019t even know what chocolate is because we work in the mines?\u2019\u2018I wondered what his intention was to ask such a question.\u2019Meanwhile, the boy who was a little faster raised his hand and said.\u201cIt\u2019s chocolate!\u201dThe child smiled slyly at the same time he gave the answer.He was sure to himself \u2013 That this was a test to find an enterprising child who acts first, but his prediction went awry.\u201cDoes anyone have any other opinions?\u201dThe child who answered first the cold customer\u2019s question looked disappointed.But there was no sympathy from anyone.Rather, they raised their hand like animals, in order to not miss this opportunity.\u201cMe!\u201d\u201cI know!\u201d\u201cMe! Me!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll answer! Sir!\u201d\u201cPlease me\u2026\u201dChildren shouted and raised their hands like a flock of pigeons gathering around the crumbs, except Oliver.Oliver instead of raising his hands, fell into deep thought.\u2018Is that really chocolate?\u2019Oliver looked at the customer\u2019s hand that was holding the chocolate.Obviously, he had the chocolate in his hand, but there was something more noticeable than that.It was a black light.It was a round black light that was formed at his fingertips.The customer was drawing black light from his body towards the fingertips and making a circle.This was quite a shock to Oliver.Each person had a black light in their bodies, but he has never seen any of them handle it like this before.So while Oliver was shocked by the new discovery, the other children answered the questions, being pointed out by the customer.\u201cOkay, you answer.\u201d\u201cYes! That\u2019s an opportunity.\u201d\u201cWrong!\u201dThe customer pointed to the other child.\u201cIt\u2019s the future. A future where I can live a better life!\u201d\u201cWrong!\u201dThe guest pointed to another child again.\u201cIt is a hope.\u201d\u201cWrong!\u201dThe customer pointed towards another child again.Then he pointed to another child.Each and every child he pointed out gave a novel answer, but nothing satisfied the customer.Before they knew it, all the hands were down, and the children whose hopes were trampled were only crying.They even shed tears because they felt it was so unfair, but fair or not, the customer only murmured in disappointment.\u201cUm\u2026 is there no one here either?\u201dIt was at this moment, that someone quietly raised his hand.Everyone\u2019s eyes focused on him.\u201cHuh? Uh, yeah\u2026 What does this look like to you?\u201dAn unexpected question.Oliver, who was least visible, replied.\u201cA circle.\u201d\u201c\u2026huh? what?\u201d\u201cA circle. Sir.\u201d\u201c\u2026a circle? Not a square?\u201d\u201cYes. How did you do that, sir?\u201dThe customer smiled in silence.The deal was done quickly.The customer handed over a lump of money that seemed heavy to the person in charge of the site, and the person in charge of the site handed Oliver over to the customer, skipping even the questions he had to ask as a guardian.All the children went back to the mine with a look of injustice, and Oliver followed the guest, no\u2026\u2026the new Master, and left the Mine.Ordinary children would have greeted him as politely and servilely as possible in order to make a good impression at this time, but Oliver did not do that, rather, he asked a bold question.\u201cExcuse me\u2026 Master? How did you do that?\u2019\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThis. Is this how you do it?\u201dWith those words, Oliver raised his finger.It was invincible to ordinary people but was visible to the customer.A lump of black light formed at the tip of Oliver\u2019s finger.Oliver imitated the customer\u2019s tricks just by looking at them once.It wasn\u2019t that hard either.The corners of the customer\u2019s mouth slowly lifted.\u201cSince when were you able to do that?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just now. I\u2019ve seen it since I was a kid,\u201dOliver replied, and the customer suddenly stopped and looked at Oliver.\u201cMy name is Joseph. A great Warlock, I will be your teacher. From now on, serve me.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2WURRR WURRRA black mass that resembled clay and smoke revolved above Oliver\u2019s fingertips.At first, he could only make it into a round mass of light, but in less than half a day, he could transform it into triangles, squares, stars, donuts, and even human shapes.Above all, Oliver didn\u2019t get tired of it.He began to make the mass of black light change into more complex and sophisticated forms.The black smoke transformed into cones, Mobius strips, and spider webs.Oliver was like a child who received a toy for the first time.\u201cIs it fun?\u201dJoseph, who was walking ahead of Oliver, suddenly asked.\u201cYes, it can change into something like this\u2026 It\u2019s amazing.\u201dOliver replied with pure admiration.Oliver looked gloomy because of his ugly impression and subdued voice, but the happiness on his face was sincere.Oliver didn\u2019t expect that the black light could be used like this.It was an amazing finding for Oliver.\u201cIs this black light called.. black magic?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a black light, it\u2019s called emotions.\u201d\u201cEmotions?\u201d\u201cYeah, anger, sadness, hatred\u2026 Dealing with these kinds of emotions is the fundamentals of black magic. It might not seem like a big deal, but it\u2019s a very powerful force. Emotions are a kind of energy that comes from the soul. It can be said that it is the same principle as the magic that comes out of magic stones. By the way, you are good at handling these emotions, but your emotions are not that strong.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cJust as you heard. Your feelings are very small and humble. But\u2026.. this kind of thing doesn\u2019t matter. Since you can use other people\u2019s emotions. That\u2019s the norm.\u201dAt those words, Oliver\u2019s dynamic eyes lit up \u2013 like a corpse that had come back to life.\u201cIt\u2019s not difficult. It\u2019s similar to how you can see others\u2019 emotions and deal with them now. Anyone can do it if they have enough talent. Think of it as similar to using your sixth sense, and invisible muscles that go beyond the ordinary senses.\u201dOliver frowned at the complex words, but he instinctively realized one thing: that he had enough talent.Although there was no basis for it, he could be sure.At that moment, Oliver\u2019s hard brain creaked.He started to fall into his own imagination.Imagining himself handling a huge light rather than a small light like this.His cold heart started to warm up little by little when he thought of it.Oliver asked quietly, with eyes filled with desire,\u201cCan you teach me more? Black magic.\u201dSeeing his quiet but greedy eyes, Joseph pondered for a moment before answering:\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you more after we get home.\u201dThe words \u2018Teach me now\u2019 came up to the end of Oliver\u2019s throat.It was a natural reaction because it was something that interested him for the first time in his life.However, as soon as he saw Joseph, he swallowed his words and decided to be patient.The reason for doing that was \u2013 the light emanating from Joseph\u2019s body.Oliver has always been able to see light around other people\u2019s bodyA light that flickers when someone is angry, a light that waves when someone is sad and a light that trembles when someone is afraid.Oliver used the light to understand people\u2019s moods and used it to avoid getting caught in situations.Similarly, right now with the help of the light, he realized that if he doesn\u2019t listen to Joseph now, he won\u2019t get what he wants.He understood that Joseph wanted him to obey his orders.Noticing this, Oliver decided to use the tricks that had helped him to survive, to help him get what he wants.He pretended to be an obedient livestock \u2013 like the one Joseph wanted.Joseph smiled a little and walked along the road as if he liked the attitude of Oliver.Oliver became a good boy and followed Joseph quietly.However, even at that moment, Oliver did not shake away his thoughts about black magic\u2026..No, he carved for it more.A considerable amount of time has passed since the last conversation.Joseph and Oliver did not speak a word.They just walked silently.For young people, walking on the road for a long time without getting in a car or train was an arduous task, but Oliver didn\u2019t really care.He wasn\u2019t bored since he was playing with the light from his emotions while walking.All he did was use his emotions to make more complex shapes at a much faster time while moving them from left to right.Oliver thought of things that could be done with his newfound toy.He thought of the possibility of changing it to adapt for a specific use, rather than simply making a shape.He thought of mine\u2019s pickaxe, the kitchen\u2019s cleaver.But Oliver didn\u2019t limit his imaginations to just that, he thought, perhaps it could be recreated into something newer through processing rather than some known shapes.Oliver didn\u2019t learn it from anyone, but his instincts told him that it was possible.Thus Oliver unwittingly developed his own understanding and imagination of black magic \u2013 like a flower bud that was about to unfold.At that moment Joseph\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cGood. How about the inn over there?\u201dOliver, who had buried himself in his imaginary laboratory, suddenly regained his consciousness and returned to reality.He looked up at the sky and found that night had already come, and the sky was covered with dark curtains, while the streets and surrounding forests were filled with darkness.The only light that could be seen was from a lonely inn in the distance.Joseph turned to Oliver and said.\u201cWell, we are lucky. To stumble upon an inn in such a remote place.\u201dWithout hesitation, Joseph approached the inn.The distant yellow light calmed their hearts as they approached it.As they opened the door and entered, they were greeted with a warm welcome along with the fragrant smell of food.\u201cOh Welcome, sir.\u201dThe innkeeper greeted Oliver and Joseph as if he was waiting for them.A large middle-aged man rubbed his hands with a flattering smile typical of a merchant.\u201cThank you for coming, sir. Accommodation for how many?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me and this little boy. Do you have a room for the night?\u201d\u201cYes Yes. Of course, we have sir. Come, come with me.\u201dThe owner politely bowed his head and led them to the room.On the way, they saw a dining hall, where there were about three to four other customers besides Joseph and Oliver.\u201cDoesn\u2019t the food look delicious?\u201dLooking at the food on the guests\u2019 tables, Joseph said.In fact, the meals the guests were eating looked quite delicious \u2013 Freshly baked bread, stew, cheese, and steamed meat.It was rare for such a secluded inn to have delicious meals like steamed meat.The owner smiled and replied.\u201cThank you for the compliment, sir. It\u2019s kind of a sales strategy. As you can see, it is a remote inn, so it is difficult to receive guests. We can only deal with the occasional passer-by or truck drivers\u2026 So we are increasing the number of customers by making the food delicious.\u201d\u201cRight. It sure looks delicious. It looks like a work of a master chef.\u201d\u201cThank you, sir. It\u2019s all my wife\u2019s work. Including the staff, this inn is run by a total of five people. Of course, you will eat, right sir?\u201d\u201cOf course, we should eat\u2026 But can we eat in the room? I want to eat quietly. I will give you more money.\u201dAt that moment, the inn owner\u2019s facial muscles twitched slightly.\u201cAh\u2026 yes, yes, of course, it is possible. Here, this is the room, sir. Please wait a moment and I will bring you the meal. Is there anything else you need?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cOkay sir, then have a nice stay\u2026\u201dThe owner hurriedly went down to the first floor, while Joseph entered the room with Oliver.Joseph asked Oliver as he took off his coat.\u201cWhat do you think of the owner? Isn\u2019t he kind?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 I don\u2019t know, but he was strange.\u201d\u201cHahaha. Isn\u2019t he?\u201dJoseph laughed.The owner did seem like a good innkeeper, but somehow his main job seemed a little different.About 20 minutes later, there was a knock on the door.A tall man who appears to be an employee brought food on a tray.\u201cI brought the food, sir.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dJoseph exclaimed at the delicious food such as stews and steamed meat along with freshly baked bread.Joseph handed the clerk a generous tip, and the clerk grinned.\u201cI would appreciate it if you could just put the empty bowl outside the door after you finish eating. If you need anything, please let me know sir.\u201dAs the employee went outside, Oliver and Joseph looked into each other\u2019s eyes.An hour later, an empty bowl and plate were placed outside the door, and the owner, who saw it, put an evil smile on his face.At Midnight.THUD!THUD!A dull sound rang out.It was the sound of hitting meat with a hammer \u2013 a human meat.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dThe inn owner sighed and wiped the sweat from his forehead.No, it wasn\u2019t sweat, it was blood.At his feet lay an inn guest.It couldn\u2019t be seen properly because of the darkness, but the guest had been hit in the head with a hammer several times.\u201cAhhh. I\u2019m too old for this sh*t.\u201d\u201cAh, what do you mean, Master? You can continue this for 20 more years.\u201d\u201cArthur\u2026 Arthur. How old do you think I will be in 20 years? At that age, I want to live a more dignified life. By the way, is this the end?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 no. There\u2019s the last thing in the room at the end of the hallway. The man and a child.\u201d\u201cOh, right. Those who ate in the room. Phew\u2026\u2026 We\u2019re in luck today, shall I try harder?\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t they be awake?\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry. The food has been eaten thoroughly. It was like they cleaned the plates by licking with their tongues.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s good. The atmosphere was weird, so I was worried about it\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, the kid, in particular, he looked like a walking corpse.\u201d\u201cWhat are those two? He doesn\u2019t look like a rich man, did he?\u201d\u201cWell? Looking at the soot on the boy\u2019s body, he must have been a boy from a nearby coal mine. Slave traders, perverts who like children, and people who need lab rats occasionally visit those kinds of places.\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s a bad thing.\u201dThe innkeeper and his subordinate stood in front of the room where Joseph and Oliver were staying.The two waited for a while at the door, as usual.They made eye contact with each other and spoke softly.\u201cOne\u2026\u2026\u201dThe subordinate nodded his head.\u201cTwo\u2026\u2026\u201dOnce again he nodded\u201cThree..\u201dAs they were about to open the door and go inside,BANG BANG BANGThe door suddenly broke and something poured out.It was like a marble, and it was so fast that the subordinate got startled and sat down.When he belatedly opened his eyes, all he could see were the shards of the broken door and the owner lying down covered in shards.The owner was lying bleeding through his torso as if he had been shot.\u2018What nonsense is this\u2026.\u2019The subordinate\u2019s heart was pounding like a drum, while he felt suffocating.TAK TAK TAKSoon, with the sound of loud footsteps, someone walked out of the room.It was the guest who came to the inn along with a child.He looked down at the subordinate and said,\u201cone.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3A few hours ago.Oliver and Joseph looked at each other with a table filled with delicacies between them.\u201cDo you think we should eat this food?\u201dOliver thought for a moment and then shook his head.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 it\u2019s a little difficult to explain.\u201cThen explain it the difficult way.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 well\u2026 the light around the person who brought us the food was weird.\u201d\u201cLight?\u201cYes\u2026.. I mean, the emotion. When angry, it flickers, and when sad, it wavers and it trembles when afraid.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cThat man\u201d\u201cThe innkeeper?\u201d\u201cYes, the light around the innkeeper. It\u2019s faintly twisted.\u201d\u201cWhat if it\u2019s twisted ?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve only seen it a few times. The supervisor of the Mine had that kind of a light right before he took me to the Mine and when he put me into a dangerous job.\u201d\u201cYou mean that kind of light is when people tell a lie?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 yes, I think so.\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s reply, Joseph nodded as if he was satisfied with his answer.\u201cWhy did the innkeeper lie to us?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cThe reason is obvious. It\u2019s because they had a purpose. For example, this delicious food is mixed with sleeping pills. Then, after eating and sleeping, they will kill us to get our things.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a pleasant story, but Joseph seemed to be a little excited as if he was reminiscing his childhood memories.\u201cWell, then, what should we do?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 we don\u2019t eat?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the right answer. If you do that then the innkeeper will realize that we\u2019ve noticed. Rather, we should pretend we\u2019ve been tricked and be vigilant. Remember, tricks are important to be a warlock.\u201dOliver nodded his head with wide eyes as usual.Joseph wondered if Oliver understood what he said, but he didn\u2019t talk further.Instead, he pulled out a test tube from his chest pocket.Oliver\u2019s eyes lit up slightly when he saw the test tube.The test tube, sealed with a black stopper, contained a black liquid, as thick as tar, and it could be seen wriggling like a living creature.\u201cIs the\u2026.black thing\u2026..emotions?!\u201dOliver asked,\u201c\u2026\u2026 Yeah. That\u2019s right. They are condensed emotions.\u201d\u201cHow did you do it?\u201dOliver\u2019s eyes were tinged with greed.When Joseph saw his greed, he warned him.\u201c\u2026. Don\u2019t be in such a hurry. It\u2019s not something you can learn yet. Instead, I\u2019ll show you something more interesting. Think you\u2019re lucky.\u201dWith those words, Joseph pulled out the stopper from the test tube, and as soon as the stopper opened, the liquid shook more violently, and Joseph placed his hand on it.When the hand is removed from the test tube, the liquid became silent, and a strand of thread was pulled out.Its appearance was reminiscent of a thread from a spinning machine, and as soon as the thread was pulled out, it started to change back to black light again and circled around Joseph\u2019s hand.From liquid to thread and then to light.Oliver watched the amazing and mysterious sight without saying a word.No, he was doing more than just watching.From the moment Joseph opened the lid, the world seemed to have slowed down for Oliver, he instinctively understood everything, including the principles, mechanisms, and even tricks.This was the moment when the theory that he had built in his imagination was proved to be true.Black light, emotion could be changed according to one\u2019s purpose and could be processed into something new.\u201cCome out, Eater\u201dJoseph whispered towards the black light.Hearing his whisper the black light began to sway and spun around, as it united into one, and then began to expand:\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201dOliver said while looking at the sphere in the air.It was the size of a human head, and Oliver reached out his hand towards the sphere out of curiosity before he knew it.It was similar to a child extending his hand the first time he saw a fire?Just before Oliver\u2019s hand touched the sphere, one side of the sphere opened.And between the crevices appeared a huge, shaggy tongue and white teeth.A gigantic mouth appeared in the air.\u201cEater. A scavenge hunter I created. It wasn\u2019t originally intended for this, but it can be used like this too\u2026 .. Eat all the food.\u201dAt Joseph\u2019s words, Eater began to devour the food placed on the table, licking and cleaning the plates completely, but Oliver was rather amazed at how it looked.\u2018Black Magic\u2026\u2026.It is really fun.\u2019\u201cAre you curious?\u201d\u201c\u2026. Yes.\u201d\u201cWell then, stay awake tonight. Maybe, you will see something even more interesting.\u201dAnd it was true.\u201cOne.\u201dJoseph said while walking out of the door, and the frightened innkeeper screaming stupidly, got up and started running away.\u201cTwo\u201dJoseph didn\u2019t care and took the thread again from the test tube.When the thread turned back to light, the light condensed in an instant and turned into a bullet-like shape.All this happened in just a second or two, and Joseph while pointing his finger at the employee said,\u201cThree. Hate Bullet.\u201dThe ball of light flew at the chant and pierced the back of the employee.The force was so powerful that a hole the size of marble was created on his head, and the employee fell down and died even before he could scream.Oliver followed Joseph and went down with him.For safety, he should have stayed in the room, but his curiosity and lust to learn about Black Magic made it impossible.He wanted to watch it through to the end.He felt like it was his mission.\u201cWell, this is not surprising.\u201dJoseph saw something and murmured.Oliver looked over Joseph\u2019s shoulder from the first floor of the inn.What caught his eyes was a naked guest\u2026.No, it was a corpse of the guest and a middle-aged woman carrying that body.The fat woman innkeeper looked at Joseph and Oliver with a puzzled expression on her face,\u201cHuh? Huh? Didn\u2019t you finish your dinner?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little cautious so I don\u2019t eat anything suspicious.\u201dAfter speaking, Joseph responded like a gentleman to the woman, and he stretched out his hand.\u201cHate Bullet.\u201dThe bullet of hate that flew pierced the middle-aged woman\u2019s head and chest at once.One of the waitresses, who was mopping and wiping out bloodstains next to her, was terrified and ran into the kitchen.Joseph walked leisurely and followed her, and Oliver followed Joseph, keeping a reasonable distance.It was so much fun for Oliver, who never thought black magic can use emotions like bullets.It felt like a dream come true.It was very interesting and terrifying at the same time.As Joseph was on his way to the kitchen, the employee who ran away came out.She came out with a shotgun that was usually used at the inn and pointed it at Joseph.Oliver thought at that moment.\u2018Is it possible to spread the emotion out wide and block it like a shield?\u2019As if he had known from the beginning an image was drawn in his head and to his surprise, Joseph created a curtain larger than the human height using the black light as Oliver had imagined.\u201cDieeeeeeeeeeee\u201dThe waitress opened fire aiming at JosephBANG BANG BANG\u201cBlack Shield.\u201dA loud gunshot rang out.However, all the bullets from the shotgun were blocked by a wide black curtain.The bullets fired from close range were blocked so futilely, and the waitress looked at that with her eyes wide open as if she was possessed by a ghost, but that was a fatal mistake.\u201cHate Bullet.\u201dJoseph fired bullets of hatred with no mercy.With a sound, the employee with holes in her chest and stomach collapsed.\u2018Beautiful!\u2019From strange creatures to bullets and shields\u2026Everything Oliver thought and didn\u2019t think, filled his eyes.\u201cKnowing how to treat customers properly is the first virtue of a waitress\u2026.well, it\u2019s already too late for you.\u201dJoseph muttered as he approached the fallen corpse, and then muttered as if he had remembered it too late:\u201cDidn\u2019t the inn owner say there were five\u2026.\u201dSaying those words, Oliver turned his head to the basement without knowing it.At that moment, his eyes met with the last employee who was coming out of the basement.He was sweaty as if he had moved a heavy load.As soon as he saw the dead waitress, his face distorted and he rushed in.\u201cYou b*stards!\u201dHe was more frightening than the Supervisor of the coal mine, the butcher\u2019s knife in his hand was so sharp \u2013 as if it could cut anything with a small touch, and above all, the light emanating from his body was flickering more severely than anyone Oliver had ever seen before.Oliver was sure that he would die if he got caught.But\u2026..Oliver wasn\u2019t afraid, rather he felt the opposite \u2013 happy.Oliver stretched out his hand.It wasn\u2019t taught by anyone, but he instinctively reached out.Then he extracted the emotions of the angry employee swirling around him toward his hand.The black light moving around Oliver\u2019s hand was huge, and it was difficult to even for Oliver to explain how he did it.It was like walking for human beings \u2013 which is not taught but done instinctively.It was the realm of talent that Joseph talked about.THUMP \u2026 THUMP \u2026 THUMP\u2026Oliver\u2019s cold heart started beating and all his nerves were focused on his hand.The inn employee was almost a few steps away,But Oliver was neither afraid nor nervous.He only cared about the emotions in his hands.Oliver painted the image in his head.Like Joseph, he condensed the fluctuating emotions\u2013 Fastly and more precisely.As time passed slowly the fiery emotions found stability in Oliver\u2019s hand and they took the form that he had imagined.Oliver made his hand into the shape of a gun while stretching the thumb finger and index finger.A bullet of hatred was formed at the tip of his index finger.After that, he left everything to his instincts and took aim.\u201cHate Bullet.\u201dThe bullets of hatred from his fingertips flew at the chant and pierced the chest of the employee.A fist-sized hole was created with the sound of a pop, and the employee died with his eyes wide open.The silence was the only thing that filled the inn.Oliver stared intently at his hand.He recalled the feeling of using black magic for the first time, and the feeling still lingered \u2026Soon a hand touched Oliver\u2019s head.It was Joseph.He gently stroked Oliver\u2019s head with a very admirable expression on his face.\u201cGood job.\u201dOliver followed Joseph down to the basement.In the basement, there were piles of stolen items taken from the murdered guests.Expensive coats, pants, and shoes.In addition, various watches, wallets, belts, and wedding rings were packed in the box.\u201cHahaha\u2026 they worked really hard.\u201dJoseph pulled a pouch out of his pocket.The yellowish leather pouch had tooth-like zippers.It was like a little creature, which was a bit unpleasant.\u201cTake everything.\u201dAt Joseph\u2019s words, clumsy hands and feet sprouted from the pouch and they began to devour the stolen belongings.After confirming that the pouch was collecting the belongings, Joseph approached Oliver and spoke to him.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cAh, just\u2026 Why do you want to collect this?\u201dOliver said, looking at the packed corpses and piles of blood packs.Rather than fear, there was only pure curiosity.\u201cTo sell on the black market. There\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be bought, and there\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be sold. You may be able to use it in the future.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYeah, warlocks inevitably use the black market. Do you want to be a warlock?\u201dOliver nodded his head.Oliver wanted to be a warlock, it was fun and weird for Oliver.Joseph placed his hand on Oliver\u2019s head once again.It was a very friendly gesture.\u201cWhy do you think I bought you?\u201dOliver didn\u2019t answer.He heard a lot of interesting stories about how to use emotions and what black magic was, but he didn\u2019t know why Joseph bought him.It was natural because he had no interest.\u201cMy goal is to train excellent warlocks. That\u2019s why I\u2019m gathering talented kids.\u201d\u201cMe\u2026talented?\u201d\u201cYes. So, do you know why my goal is to train Warlocks?\u201dOliver shook his head.\u201cFor their survival. If you live as a warlock, you will naturally face the world\u2019s persecutions and threats. The only way to survive is to become stronger. And I\u2019m nurturing those talents to be strong so that they can face the world.\u201dOliver didn\u2019t quite understand, but he just nodded his head.\u201cBut nurturing talents is not easy. It\u2019s hard to find talented kids, and there\u2019s no such thing as a cleric, paladin, or mage education system. I have to bear all the effort and expenses required for education\u2026 Do you know how difficult this is?\u201dOliver nodded mechanically and Joseph continued,\u201cAnd nothing is free in this world. Everything, whether it\u2019s a kind act or an evil act, all done with compensation in mind.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t have any money?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need money. All I need is Loyalty. Loyalty to your teacher and your Master.\u201dOliver saw the light around Joseph.The pulsing light in Joseph\u2019s body \u2013 was desire.Oliver, understanding the meaning of the light, immediately bowed his head.\u201cI will obey the MASTER.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Oliver stayed awake all night.After leaving the inn, Oliver spent every night without an ounce of sleep.Even though he was tired because of the long journey, he couldn\u2019t sleep.It was not because Oliver was physically or mentally strained, rather the opposite \u2014 he was excited.During his days in the orphanage and mine, every day was just the same.He could fall asleep at any time because he was not interested in anything other than survival, but the past few days were different.Every day was exciting.He thought of it several times a day\u2026. no, dozens or hundreds of times, about the time, when he extracted the emotions from the inn employee and shot him with Hate Bullet.The mysterious and yet familiar sensation made him feel like he was flying in the sky with wings.Recalling those memories not only made Oliver excited but also at the same time feel bad.Oliver felt that if he had concentrated a little more at that time, he could have extracted much more emotions at a much faster speed.He felt if he had restrained his joy and concentrated a little more, he could have shot several shots at the same time, not one.He regretted that he could have cast advanced black magic rather than imitating what Joseph did.Oliver reflected on each of those regrets.And he did image training in his head to relieve that disappointment. He extracts more emotions, shoots more Hate Bullets, and increases the speed, accuracy, and power.In time, he also gave a unique shape to the Hate bullet.Even though it was just an imagination in his head, Oliver had the confidence to apply it in reality.If it had not been for the words of Joseph, his master, and teacher, he would have extracted his emotions and experimented with them right away.\u201cDon\u2019t practice black magic without my permission.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026 Master?\u201d\u201cUnlike the shapes created using emotions which can\u2019t be seen by people, black magic spells could be seen. We\u2019ll be arriving at our destination soon and I don\u2019t want you to attract useless attention. Above everything, a true Warlock would never use his own emotions for black Magic.\u201d\u201cEmotions are limited resources, and if you use them recklessly, your soul will become empty, so unless you are really out of options, you should avoid using your emotions.\u201d\u201cThen, can I practice if I extract it from someone?\u201d\u201cNo. You should never use black magic without my permission. Did you forget what I told you at the inn? You should obey and follow me without asking questions. Then I will teach you.\u201dBecause of those words, Oliver had no choice but to practice Black magic only in his head.It was frustrating, but he couldn\u2019t help it.Joseph demanded obedience, so he had to obey as much as he could in order to receive his teaching, even if it was just on the surface.Before he knew it, the dark sky turned gray and gradually turned blue.The sun rose again, and Joseph also rose up from his seat.\u201cHmmm\u2026! Sleeping in the streets isn\u2019t that bad. Huh? Did you wake up early? No, you didn\u2019t sleep, right?\u201dJoseph said, looking at Oliver with a pale complexion and increased dark circles around his eyes.As usual, Joseph went to a nearby stream to wash his face and washed his mouth with an oral cleanser.Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!Joseph said after spitting out a thick sputum-like cleanser.\u201cDo you usually not sleep? Or are you not sleeping on purpose? Even if you get tired in the middle, I won\u2019t give you a piggyback ride.\u201dOliver replied with a glance at Joseph.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, master\u2026 I couldn\u2019t sleep because I was excited when I heard that we were about to arrive at the destination.\u201dOliver wasn\u2019t lying.Oliver couldn\u2019t wait to reach the destination and start learning black magic.It was a feeling he felt for the first time in his life, so he couldn\u2019t control it.Joseph said in a soft voice as if he didn\u2019t like such an appearance.\u201cWell, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand. All the other kids were also like that.\u201d\u201cOther kids?\u201d\u201cWhat? Did you think you were the only one I\u2019ve ever met who\u2019s talented? There are many other talented children besides you.\u201dOliver saw the light around Joseph.The light staggered subtly.It meant what he was saying was half true and half lie.\u201cOf course, not all of them are talented. There are many other kids besides you. You know what to do if you\u2019re from an orphanage, right?\u201cI\u2019ll behave properly, Master.\u201d\u201cYeah, you\u2019re the youngest who just came in. You have to behave like a newcomer. Rank is really important in our society.\u201dOliver nodded his head.It wasn\u2019t much different from the orphanage and mine.The weak or the newcomers had always made to do the hardest work and sleep in the worst position.In order to get out of such treatment, you have to be stronger than other children or have to be close with a strong child.So far, Oliver has been out of the spotlight by staying quiet because he wasn\u2019t interested in anything, but now Oliver doesn\u2019t know what he should do since there is something he is interested in.Joseph said warningly to such Oliver,\u201cDid you catch my point?\u201d\u201c Yes, Master\u2026 I obey the master, and the rules of the place I\u2019ll be living.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Follow the rules if you want to learn. \u201dOliver nodded his head once again.After a while, Joseph and Oliver had a small loaf of bread for the meal and they started walking again.As they reached close to the destination, the number of trees gradually decreased, and the artificial smell peculiar to the city came out, and soon, a small city appeared down the hill.\u201cThat\u2019s Wineham.\u201dHearing Joseph\u2019s words, Oliver\u2019s eyes grew wider looking at the city.It was because of the number of people in the city and the various emotions they exuded.\u201c It\u2019s not a big city, but at the same time not a small city. How does it look?\u201d\u201c\u2026it looks lively.\u201dOliver replied, looking at the gleam of irritation, anger, and resentment swirling around the people.\u201cWell, maybe. Some of the big factories that supported the city will be relocated to \u2018Landa.\u2019 That\u2019s why everyone is emotionally unstable.\u201dOliver didn\u2019t fully understand the meaning, but he understood that factories leaving was the cause of that fluctuating light.After finishing his words Joseph began to walk, while Oliver followed the suit and they soon reached a shabby factory built on the outskirts of the city.The building with the ceiling tilted to one side had a smiling pig and hanging sausage as a signboard.\u201cIs this\u2026?\u201d\u201cOfficially a small, unsightly sausage factory. Unofficially, it\u2019s our family base.\u201dJoseph went inside and Oliver followed.Shortly after entering the factory, Oliver saw the inside of the factory.There was a little bit of spoiled meat, a huge grinder, a cart carrying minced meat, and young workers working there.Even though they were young, they looked older than Oliver, all of them were in their mid to early twenties.As soon as Joseph appeared, they stopped what they were doing, approached Joseph, and bowed their heads.\u201cI greet the Master.\u201d\u201cWelcome. Master.\u201d\u201cHow was the journey Master?\u201dThe smell of spoiled meat and sweat emanated from their body, but they tried their best to look good in front of Joseph.As if familiar with the sight, Joseph pushed Oliver\u2019s back and spoke.\u201cThis is the new kid I brought. He\u2019ll be a family member from today, so teach him the rules and everything about this place.\u201dThe children smiled brightly at Joseph\u2019s words.They looked happy as if they got a new brother, at least on the outside,\u201cYes, We will do it. Master.\u201dUpon hearing the answer, Joseph calmly left Oliver behind.Oliver didn\u2019t understand what was going on, and soon he was left alone in a strange place.No, Oliver wasn\u2019t alone, there were fiercely glaring workers around.They spoke with a frown like an angry dog.\u201c\u2026.. What? Don\u2019t you understand what\u2019s going on? Go, get ready to work!\u201dThus began Oliver\u2019s new life.Ting! Ting! Ting! Ting! Ting! Ting! Ting!In the morning, there was the sound of knocking on the crushed frying pan.The children, who were sleeping on a soggy mattress, woke up one by one to the painful metal sound.If there was anyone who was still sleeping without waking up, the children who played the role of supervisors screamed at them.\u201cWhat are you doing piece of sh*t! Don\u2019t be lazy. Get up quickly!\u201dAfter hearing the scream, the children woke up in a hurry because they knew if they didn\u2019t soon a kick would follow, and the first to wake among them was Oliver.A week has passed since Oliver came here, and he was quickly adjusting to life here.It was one of his unique abilities \u2013 to adapt quickly wherever he was.In the morning, he came out of the warehouse called the accommodation and cleaned the inside of the factory.After he finished cleaning, he ate the bread and soup provided.It was an old hard bread, but it was a pretty good meal compared to the watery porridge he had in the mine.After the meal, he once again started working in the factory.For Oliver, this wasn\u2019t hard because it was a job where he had to just make sausage with the meat that came in that day.The smell of spoiled meat was bad, but it wasn\u2019t a big deal for Oliver, who had a dull sense of taste or smell, and it was easy compared to the heavy work he had to do in the mine where there wouldn\u2019t be any sunlight.The workload was also jagged from day to day, but it was basically small and had nothing to complain about.Rather it was the mind, not the body that was having a hard time.Obviously, Oliver expected that Joseph would teach him black magic as soon as he came to this place, but contrary to his expectations, Joseph just left after leaving Oliver here.Oliver wanted to ask what was going on, but he couldn\u2019t ask because of his experience in the orphanage and mine, and his desire to obey.Working was not a problem at all, but he wanted to know when he could learn black magic.Oliver wasn\u2019t confident about dealing with the disappointment in case he had to continue working in the factory without being able to learn Black magic.It was then.SLAP!A burning pain rushed into Oliver\u2019s face, as he stumbled backward.When the blurred vision became clear, there was a man standing in front of him \u2014 A ferocious young man with a masculine body.He said, thrusting his hand on Oliver\u2019s chest.\u201c This damn fu*ker\u2026.Didn\u2019t I ask you to move all the meat?\u201dHe was the supervisor in charge of the male workers.\u201cI\u2026 mooo\u2026ved it,\u201dOliver replied with a dull pronunciation from the pain.Dissatisfied with the look on Oliver\u2019s face, the supervisor thrust his hand on Oliver one more time.\u201cThis bugger\u2026 Hey, teach him a lesson! Even though I\u2019ll be leaving this place soon, I can\u2019t stand the thought of this sucker staying in the place where I once worked. It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve got a shortage of workers.\u201dAt the supervisor\u2019s words, the workers around, as well as the other fellow supervisors, nodded their heads.As if he liked the atmosphere, the energetic supervisor said, grabbing Oliver by the collar.\u201cHey, little sh*t. I warn you if you want to stay here as a worker, get your act together. It\u2019s no use pretending to be a fool. If I catch you doing something weird, I\u2019ll put you in the grinder and make you minced meat. Did you get it?!\u201dOliver nodded his head from his experience of becoming submissive whenever someone gets angry at him.The supervisor\u2019s face got further distorted by contempt.\u201cHuh! You moron\u2026 clean up all the mess here today as punishment!\u201dOliver nodded again.Only then did the supervisor let go of Oliver\u2019s collar.At that moment another supervisor intervened.It was a woman with pale skin and short purple hair.\u201cHey, you can\u2019t just ditch your job on someone else. Today\u2019s workshop cleaning is you guys.\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes were on her.The supervisor who hit Oliver crumpled his face, and the female supervisor folded her arms without losing to him.Everyone swallowed their saliva and stopped their breath, while Oliver had only one thought.\u2018When are you going to teach me Black magic?\u2019Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5The male supervisor said with an arrogant tone.\u201cWhy do you care?\u201dThe female supervisor replied.\u201cI care because I\u2019m the same supervisor as you. You can\u2019t have your own way.\u201d\u201cHa! The same supervisor? Same supervisor, huh!!\u201d\u201cYes, same supervisor.\u201dThe woman said without losing, but the atmosphere was terrible.Everyone looked worried as if the female supervisor had done something wrong.Oliver, who was not aware of the situation, couldn\u2019t understand what was going on.\u201cIt looks like you don\u2019t have a grasp of the situation yet. Haven\u2019t you heard that I\u2019ll soon be a formal disciple?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just a rumor.\u201d\u201cJust a rumor? I heard it from a formal disciple. If you don\u2019t believe in rumors, you can just check it with your own eyes.\u201dSoon, the male supervisor gathered black light in both hands.It was a pitifully small and unstable light compared to Joseph.Others, however, stepped back in fear, the female supervisor was the only one standing tall without flattering.\u201cIt\u2019s for the Master to decide who would become a formal disciple. What do you think the Master will do if he gets to know that you\u2019re running wild without knowing your place?\u201dWhen Joseph\u2019s name came out, the heated atmosphere subsided a little.The male supervisor, who looked fierce like a bulldog, also made an uncomfortable expression, but he did not withdraw his hostility toward the female supervisor.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right, it\u2019s up to the Master to decide. I wonder how you\u2019ll behave at the end of this month when I officially become a formal disciple. Hey, what are you doing? Start cleaning up.\u201dThe male supervisor ordered the workers to clean up.Then the workers began to move like a dog with its tail on fire.Oliver hid his presence as usual and got out of the mess.He would have normally disappeared quietly without getting noticed by anyone, but he didn\u2019t do it today.Instead of going away, he was waiting on one side for the female supervisor who helped him earlier to pass.The female supervisor was coming his way while talking to her fellow workers.\u201cWhy did you do that, Marie?\u2026 I\u2019m sure that guy deserves it.\u201d\u201cRight. It\u2019s none of our business, why did you poke your nose in it?\u201d\u201cI heard that that guy Tom is going to be a formal disciple this time. I\u2019m pretty sure. You have a lot of grudges, Marie.\u201d\u201cEnough. Everybody be quiet. Nothing\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s just a rumor. I\u2019ve been here for years, how many times do you think I\u2019ve heard things like that? So stop it. Just give it a rest\u2026 huh?\u201dMarie, the female supervisor, stopped walking.The reason was because she saw Oliver waiting for her.As if seeing something bothersome, Marie sighed deeply.Then she spoke coldly to Oliver.\u201cI just helped you because I didn\u2019t like that guy\u2019s behavior. I don\u2019t need your thank you. I didn\u2019t help you because you were pretty. Don\u2019t think about anything weird and go away. It\u2019s annoying.\u201dOliver stood still with a blank look on his face.Marie asked again, frowning.\u201cWhat? Is there anything else you want to say?\u201dOliver nodded.\u201cYes, what is a formal disciple?\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201dAt the study in the basement of the sausage factory.Joseph, who was reading a book there, asked a fairly handsome blond man who looked like he was in his mid-20s in front of him.The man\u2019s name was Andrew, Joseph\u2019s best student and the second-in-command of the Joseph family.\u201cThere was a small disturbance at the factory. You know the guy you brought in the other day? He was beaten to death by Tom.\u201d\u201cIs he fine?\u201d\u201cWho are you asking?\u201d\u201cThe one who got beat. Is it the boy I brought the other day?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, but not to the point of worrying. Marie helped him when he was about to get hit hard.\u201d\u201cMarie? That\u2019s surprising. It\u2019s none of her business. Why did she stand up for him?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t she the kind who can\u2019t stand unreasonable things? Plus, it might have irritated her seeing Tom acting high and mighty. You know, Tom\u2019s been an informal disciple for 2 years, while she\u2019s been a for 6 years, so she\u2019s probably nervous.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. I remember. The girl who\u2019s been an informal disciple for a long time. Hmm, I thought aspiration was as important as talent for Black magic, but I guess not. Wait a little longer and if she doesn\u2019t show any results, downgrade her to a servant.\u201dAndrew, the formal disciple didn\u2019t bother to say anything, since it was the rule of this place \u2014 Those who don\u2019t have any talent should serve those who have talent.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll get going. I\u2019ll report you if anything happens.\u201dAfter saying that Andrew didn\u2019t go out, he just stood still in the same place.Joseph, who saw his unusual behavior, asked.\u201cWhat? Are you not going out?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Master. May I ask you a question?\u201d\u201c\u2026Tell me.\u201d\u201cWhy do you want me to keep an eye on the kid you brought in? Didn\u2019t you put him in as an informal disciple because he wasn\u2019t very talented?\u201dJoseph said, covering the book he was reading.\u201cWhy are you interested in that?\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019ve never done anything like this before, that\u2019s why\u2026. The one\u2019s Master picked up as an informal disciple was taught once or twice by the Master, and soon you\u2019ve lost interest in them\u2026\u2026but this time it seems different. And I\u2019m your disciple\u2026\u201dAndrew wanted to say \u2018I\u2019m am your disciple, so I deserve to know.\u2019, but when he saw Joseph and his eyes, he was soon discouraged and blurted the end of his words,After seeing through Andrew\u2019s mind, Joseph opened his mouth like a benevolent teacher.\u201cWhy? There\u2019s nothing much to it. It\u2019s just because he\u2019s pretty interesting.\u201d\u201cInteresting?\u201d\u201cYeah, unlike other kids, who want to learn black magic to gain strength or money, he just wants to learn Black magic. Isn\u2019t he interesting?\u201d\u201cSo, you mean he has some talent?\u201d\u201cNot some, he has quite a lot.\u201dAndrew\u2019s expression hardened noticeably when Joseph said that.\u201cHahaha. Are you scared?\u201d\u201cUgh, no. No Master!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so scared. That guy is just in his beginning stage, on the other hand, you\u2019ve been my best student for years. So, don\u2019t worry about it, just train.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, Master.\u201dAndrew was relieved when his teacher comforted him.As he was in a hurry to leave the study, in order to avoid showing his embarrassed face to his teacher, Joseph called Andrew.\u201cWait, did I say Tom will be promoted to a formal disciple?\u201d\u201cYes, you said last time, it will be officially announced at the end of this month\u2026 What\u2019s wrong, Master?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dJoseph didn\u2019t answer.Instead, he thought hard as if he had an interesting idea.\u201cOkay, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve come back, so it\u2019s not bad to show them mercy once. Andrew, let the informal disciples know. We\u2019re going to have a class in two days.\u201d\u201cClass?\u201dAndrew asked back in surprise.Untalented informal disciples were also taught by Joseph, but only once every two or three months.When Joseph wasn\u2019t feeling well, they never received a class once in six months, so it was an unusual case to take a class soon after his return from the trip.Andrew asked, enduring the shock.\u201cReally, are you fine with this, Master?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m going to promote one at the end of this month, so it\u2019s not bad to check everyone\u2019s skills one last time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026. So. We\u2019re just disciples, not real disciples. If you want to be a real disciple, you have to at least enter the low level of formal disciples. Do you understand?\u201dOliver nodded to Marie\u2019s question.At first, it was hard to understand, but Marie\u2019s detailed explanation gave him a rough idea of what an informal disciple was and what a formal disciple was.To put it simply, an informal disciple is only a disciple in name, but in reality, they were not a disciple.Rather, they were a disciple candidate and a worker at the same time.They were not taught anything properly and had to take care of the chores, which came as quite a shock to Oliver.Working was not a problem.The real problem was that he couldn\u2019t learn black magic properly.That\u2019s the only thing Oliver was looking forward to.It was quite a big deal for Oliver.When Marie saw that, she said,\u201cDon\u2019t be so disappointed. Life is supposed to be unfair.\u201dWhether it was because of Marie\u2019s consolation, Oliver soon regained his spirits.On the surface, his face wasn\u2019t much different from when he was disappointed because of his corpse-like appearance,\u201cThen, how do I become a formal disciple? The guy named Tom said he was about to become a formal disciple.\u201dMarie frowned when the story of Tom came out.Combined with her fiery-looking eyes and her purple hair, she looked angrier, but she spoke in a rather hysterical voice.\u201cWell, To be recognized as qualified to become at least low level of the formal disciple, you have to accumulate skills in the classes that\u2019s taken once every few months\u2026.Don\u2019t expect too much. It\u2019s not easy for an informal disciple to become a formal disciple, and the number of seats is limited, so it will take several years. It\u2019s not something, you, who has been here for only a week should be thinking about.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do to be recognized as qualified for becoming a formal disciple?\u201dMarie frowned.\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me? Don\u2019t think about it\u2026 Ahhhh, you have to know how to use the basics of black magic. Do you know Hate Bullet? Have you heard of Black Shield\u2026.?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s energy extracted from the soul, and it can take forms like a gun, a shield. It\u2019s way more powerful than guns. I happened to see it when the Master picked me up. In an instant, he swept away the gangsters who had dominated my neighborhood.\u201dMarie made a complicated expression.Oliver could see her emotions mixed with admiration, greed, and nervousness, remembering that time.She, too, coveted black magic, but for some reason, she couldn\u2019t do it properly and she has become impatient.Marie pondered for a while, but soon came to her senses and jumped out of the seat.\u201cAhhh\u2026. Why am I explaining this to you? You\u2019re not my guy, and you didn\u2019t even bring anything\u2026 Ugh, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cOliver.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you were thinking about when asking me these questions, but this is the last time. I\u2019m not free enough to answer your questions one by one. I\u2019m giving you advice because you don\u2019t seem to know anything. If you want to get help from now on, at least bring something. There\u2019s no such thing as free in this world, Okay?\u201dOliver nodded his head.Marie didn\u2019t know whether Oliver understood it properly because he always had the same expression on his face, but Marie woke up saying it was no longer her business.\u2018Why the hell did I answer his question\u2026 Maybe I was possessed by that blank expression.\u2019Just as Marie was about to go back, a worker under Marie\u2019s supervision came running.\u201cMarie! Marie! I have good news! Good news!\u201dOliver who stood next to Marie didn\u2019t care what she was so excited about and just stood there to listen to what she had got to say.\u201cWhat is it? Calm down and tell me.\u201d\u201cSURPRISE! Master will take a break from his work tomorrow and will be conducting a class. Can you believe it? Class? Normally, when he comes back from a trip, it usually takes 4 months to have the next class, right?\u201d\u201cRight\u2026 Why is this sudden change!?\u201dMarie said, with a surprised look on her face.There has never been a case like this in the 6 years of her stay in this place.When Marie was in deep thoughts, Oliver cut in tactlessly.\u201cDo we have class tomorrow?\u201d\u201c\u2026yes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201c\u2026.. You\u2019re really lucky.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6The next morning was different from usual.Even if the supervisor didn\u2019t beat up the frying pan, everyone got up from bed.Not simply because there was no work.\u201cWow\u2026 It has never happened before. I can\u2019t believe there is a class.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cDid something good happen?\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, I heard that the Master took a huge chunk of stolen goods on the way here. Hey, do you know anything?\u201dThe kids who chatted amongst themselves looked at Oliver who woke up from the worst corner and asked.\u201cThis is the guy that Master picked up this time. He doesn\u2019t answer anything you ask, and just stares blankly.\u201dOne child said.\u201cDon\u2019t mind him. If Tom sees you speaking to him, he might pick on you.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s scary\u2026 But still, I\u2019m so jealous of Tom. He came in with me, and I can\u2019t believe he is already a formal disciple.\u201d\u201cIs that true? Wasn\u2019t it just a rumor?\u201d\u201cAlmost true. Well, Andrew\u2019s underlings talk about it almost openly. Seriously, Tom already knows how to use Black magic, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, he\u2019s definitely going to be a formal disciple. He said he\u2019d become a great Warlock.\u201d\u201cSo be careful with him. He has a bad personality, you\u2019ll get into a whole lot of trouble if you get on his bad side. And when he becomes an official formal disciple\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not us who should be worried about, it\u2019s Marie. That 6-year informal disciple will die next month. It\u2019s all because she went out of her way to help that idiot\u2026.Ah, what the f*ck?\u201dEveryone was surprised looking at Oliver who approached them without making a sound and stood next to them with a lifeless face.\u201c Excuse me, Sirs, Can I ask you something?\u201dOliver spoke respectfully.There was no particular reason.It was because the orphanage director and supervisor of the Mine always forced him to speak politely.It became a kind of habitPerhaps that\u2019s why Oliver\u2019s honorifics were more unpleasant than courtesy or consideration.\u201cWhat, what\u2026?\u201d\u201cSupervisor Tom. What kind of black magic does he use?\u201d\u201cHa\u2026? What are you going to do with that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just curious. I beg of you.\u201dOliver asked, bowing his head.Then, he could see the light of the children who were talking spread widely and soaked in a sense of superiority.\u201cWell, if you go that far, I\u2019ll let you know only once, so listen carefully. Well, it\u2019s irrelevant to you, but to become a warlock, you must have two things. One, it the eye to see emotions and two, the ability to handle emotions..\u201dSaying that the boy raised his hand and gathered the black light.A surprisingly crude circle was created.\u201cHa\u2026 this is called emotions. It took me months to do this alone. How about you guys?\u201dThe other two children who were chatting together made a circle with black lights on their fingertips.It was a crumpled, clumsy circle.\u201cOh, you\u2019ve improved.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I? I\u2019ve been practicing from time to time!\u201d\u201cHahaha, how is it? Are you scared\u2026? There are a lot of people who can\u2019t even do this. After being able to see and handle emotions, all that\u2019s left is processing the emotions.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s processing, sir?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything, huh. Casting Black magic using emotion is called processing. It could be a more powerful weapon than a gun, an invincible shield, or a terrible monster.\u201d\u201cAnd you can make drugs, cosmetics, perfumes, Pilates, and a lot of money.\u201dWhen the word money was mentioned, the children stopped talking and exclaimed.Oliver, who was not interested, tried to ask again what he should do to become a formal disciple, but at that time someone kicked the door and shouted.\u201cYou idiots! If you wake up, you should clean up and eat! What are you all doing, especially when our Master is sparing his precious time and giving us lessons? Do you want to be smacked?\u201dAll the workers who were listening to the supervisor\u2019s orders were stunned and stopped talking and began to move.Oliver, who could not hear the answer he wanted, was disappointed, but soon began to move from the supervisor\u2019s gaze.The supervisor grabbed Oliver and said,\u201cHey, you\u2026 Don\u2019t get cocky just because you got to attend a class as soon as you came, it\u2019s never going to happen. There are guys here for more than a year and have yet to become official disciples. So don\u2019t even dream about it.\u201dOliver saw the emotion circling around the supervisor, it shone with anger and vigilance.Oliver answered quickly, bowing his head.\u201cYes, sir.\u201dAs usual, Oliver started cleaning the factory with other workers.Everyone worked hard as if they were happy to take the class, and thanks to that, everything ended earlier than usual.After the cleaning, they took the meal as usual, where in addition to bread and soup, there was one more golden-yellow sausage today.Everyone ate the sausage greedily, and Oliver too ate it.It was salty and greasy.Twenty minutes later, by the time they finished eating and cleaning up, a man appeared from out of nowhere.Unlike the children working in the factory, he was well-built and had a fair complexion.As soon as everyone saw him, they bowed their heads.\u201cOh, Mr. Andrew\u2026! Nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you.\u201dEveryone bowed their heads, following Tom\u2019s lead.Oliver also bowed his head, and the man named Andrew raised his hand and said,\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Don\u2019t be so stiff. Have you all finished your meal?\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dEveryone answered loudly.Upon hearing the answer, Andrew gave a nod and opened his mouth.\u201cWell, follow me. Today, the Master will be teaching you in person.\u201dThe children had a faint smile on their faces.Considering that they only take about five classes a year, it was a fully understandable response.The children naturally lined up, and Oliver stood at the back after a quick glance at Andrew.\u201cEveryone, follow me,\u201dAndrew entered the factory warehouse.In the warehouse, between the packaged sausage boxes and items covered with unidentified tents, there was a small door.In fact, it seemed difficult to notice because it was closer to a secret passage than to a door, but when Andrew put his hand, covered with black light, the complicated pattern shone brightly and the door opened without noise.As soon as Andrew entered the door, the children followed him.Surprisingly, it was a fairly well-packed basement inside the door, and the light bulb was lit at regular intervals, making it pleasant.The children chattered among themselves as if they were having fun, imagining being a Warlock living here someday.\u201cOh, was there really a class today?\u201dA man who met Andrew on the way asked.Judging from the atmosphere, he seemed to be in the same position as Andrew.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s surprising. When the Master comes back from the trip, doesn\u2019t he always rest well for a few weeks, and only read books?\u201dHearing the question Andrew looked at Oliver in the back.\u201cI guess there are times when he doesn\u2019t. Don\u2019t mind it.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dAfter a short conversation, Andrew started walking again.After passing through several rooms and corridors, they finally entered a room that seemed like a classroom.Unlike other places, the wall was half-soil because it was not properly paved.But the room wasn\u2019t very unprepared either.Although not enough for the number of people, there were desks and chairs prepared, and there were test tubes and black magic books on the shelf, and Oliver felt his quiet heart beat again after a few weeks.\u201cWelcome,\u201dJoseph, who appeared out of nowhere, said while standing at the podium, in front of everyone.Everyone bowed their heads as soon as they saw him.\u201c We greet the Master!\u201d\u201c We greet the Master!\u201dJoseph raised his hand lightly and ordered them to sit down.There were 10 desks, which was absurdly small for informal disciples who were over 30 to sit on, but there was no problem.When the three supervisors sat down first, the workers began to fight for the rest of the seats.Slow-footed and weak Children were forced to stand in the back and hear the classes uncomfortably.Faster, stronger people can enjoy more, that was the motto and the first teaching of being a Warlock.As soon as the class started, Joseph asked Andrew.\u201cAre you not going out?\u201d\u201cCan I join you in your class, Master, if you don\u2019t mind? Since Master\u2019s teaching is always useful.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do as you please.\u201dAndrew bowed when the permission was granted.Joseph quickly started the class.\u201cWell, this is a special class that I\u2019ll be giving you, so listen carefully. First of all, let\u2019s talk about the basics before the full-fledged class. What is black magic?\u201dMarie raised her hand before anyone.\u201cIt\u2019s basically a study on using emotions. To be precise, it\u2019s actually a study that deals with the soul, which is the foundation of human beings. Emotions are just some energy from the soul.\u201d\u201cYes, black magic is essentially the study of dealing with the soul. Therefore, in addition to emotions, invisible human characteristics such as vitality and attractiveness can be extracted and used. Since the soul is the foundation of everything, black magic can be said to be the search for truth and fundamentals of human beings.\u201cOh-oh\u2026\u201dEveryone nodded in admiration and writes in their notebooks as if they understood.Oliver thought he was the only one who didn\u2019t understand.\u201cWell then, is there anyone who can tell me what is the foundation of black magic.\u201dOnce again Marie raised her hand.\u201cSeeing emotions and handling them are the foundations of Black magic.\u201d\u201cYes, no matter how much knowledge you have, it\u2019s useless if you can\u2019t see and handle emotions. And what next?\u201d\u201cTo become a warlock, you need to have the ability to extract the emotions and process them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s the basics of the basics and it\u2019s the real first step. But it is also as difficult as it is. Why?\u201d\u201cEmotion is the energy of the soul. The moment you try to extract and process, it affects the Warlock himself. Grief, anger, hatred\u2026 If the Warlock is careless or lacks the ability, he or she can be affected by emotions and suffer damage.\u201cYes! Black magic has the most destructive power and efficiency, but it\u2019s not without any risk. If the Warlock\u2019s mental strength is weak or he lacks skills, he or she would be rather eaten by the emotion. Therefore, black magic is the strongest magic only in theory, but there was no one who was able to reach it practically.\u201dThe atmosphere became solemn for a moment.Everyone felt worried and scared that black magic was not that easy.CLAP!Joseph clapped his hands to draw the attention of everyone.\u201cThat\u2019s why I had this class. So that at least one person can build up their skills. Let\u2019s stop with the theory and try to extract emotions.\u201dJoseph gave an experimental flask to the informal disciples.There was a moving mass of emotion in it.The first one who received it was Tom.He smiled confidently and touched the mouth of the flask.After a while, a black thread slowly came up.Everyone exclaimed and admired it.Next, it was handed to Marie.She had to try a little harder than Tom to extract the emotions.Marie frowned heavily, and Tom smirked derisively at the sight.Next, it was given to the supervisor who manages Oliver.He also extracted emotions but had a hard time compared to Marie and Tom.\u201cSupervisors sure are in a different league,\u201dSomeone murmured.After all the supervisors extracted the emotions, it was the turn of the workers among the informal disciples.Everyone looked determined, but only a few were chosen from among them.There were only a handful of people who could properly extract and pull out the emotions to their hands, while for the rest, the extracted emotions got cut off midway or were not even able to pull out the emotions.In addition, it seemed difficult for those who extracted to maintain the emotions collected in their hands, it was also the reason why they were not made formal disciples.\u201cCome on, take it.\u201dFinally, it was Oliver\u2019s turn.Oliver just stared at the flask container, but the other informal disciples didn\u2019t even bother to turn their heads in Oliver\u2019s direction since they knew that they had nothing to see\u2026\u2026.Until Oliver opened his mouth.\u201cMaster\u2026\u201dEveryone looked at Oliver reflexively.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cHow much do I have to extract?\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes grew wider except for Joseph.\u201c\u2026. As much as you can extract. It\u2019s training. So, extract and handle as much emotion as possible.\u201dAs soon as Joseph finished his words, Oliver placed his hand on the mouth of the flask.Then, he began to extract emotions based on the image training he had been doing.The lump of emotion, which occupied about one-third of the container fluctuated, and soared out of the flask container.Surprisingly, it regained stability in Oliver\u2019s hands.\u201cWhat should I do next, Master?\u201dOliver\u2019s question echoed in the room filled with silence.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Everyone was shocked.It\u2019s said that it\u2019s much easier to extract the emotions stored in the flask than to extract them directly from a person, but to extract that much at once, no one had words to express their shockIt was hard to even for low-level formal disciples, and not an easy task for intermediate formal disciples.Above all, Oliver didn\u2019t even break a sweat doing it.The higher the quality of the emotion, the higher the volume, and the higher the burden that the Warlock should feel, but Oliver showed no signs of it.Rather, he looked like a child playing with a toy.\u201cU\u2026\u2026\u2026gh\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..ugh..\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile everyone was surprised and dumbstruck, Oliver felt something strange and asked in his peculiar dull manner.\u201c\u2026 Did I do something wrong?\u201d-\u201cNo, it\u2019s great. Right?\u201dJoseph asked Andrew, who was watching from the back, and Andrew nodded slowly.\u201cYeah, yes, that\u2019s pretty good. Really.\u201dThe chaotic atmosphere regained stability, and Joseph continued his lesson.\u201cNow, what you just did is extraction. It\u2019s the first step in black magic. There are a total of two ways to extract emotions. Anyone?\u201dMarie raised her hand again.She seemed very agitated.\u201cUh, the first is to extract emotions stored in the test tube, and the second is to extract emotions directly from people.\u201d\u201cWhat are the similarities and differences between the two?\u201d\u201cThe common thing is that they both are emotions from real people. The difference is that one is pre-picked and stored, while the other one is extracted on-site.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s harder?\u201d\u201cThe second one is harder. Pre-picked emotions are easy to extract, but when emotions are extracted on-site, there are chances where the target might resist, if you try to extract during combat, it might become fatal.\u201dJoseph nodded and praised Marie with a satisfactory response.But for Oliver, it was a bit of a mystery.Although he had only one experience, it didn\u2019t feel like it was very difficult to extract emotions directly from people.No, it was rather fun\u2026.at least for him.Joseph opened his mouth again.\u201cAs Marie said, it\u2019s harder to extract emotions from people. Even ordinary people resist instinctively. If you do it wrong, you may fail to extract it or you may get hit. So Warlocks always store a certain amount of emotion. However, a true warlock should not rely solely on pre-picked emotions. This is because skills are also skills and emotions extracted from people are of better quality. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201d\u201cSo, don\u2019t be satisfied with your current level, and do your best to be more proficient, and those who fail should train more and more. Remember, time will never wait for you.\u201dThen the children who failed to extract emotions bowed their heads.Inside their head, there were signs of nervousness, fear, jealousy, and resentment.\u201cWell, let\u2019s get back to class. All the children who were able to extract emotions, follow me.\u201dJoseph gathered the black light in his fingertips and made a circle as he did when he first met Oliver.It wasn\u2019t that long, but it was no longer fascinating for Oliver.Soon everyone started gathering and tried to imitate the shape that Joseph showed.\u201cUgh..\u201d\u201cAwwww\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201dMost of the imitations were more like a dented thing rather than a circle.It was only the supervisors like Tom and Marie who made the circle properly.And there was one more.It was Oliver.Oliver compressed the extracted black light into a circle the same size as Joseph.A perfect circle with little sway and no dents.Joseph manipulated the black light again and changed the circle into a square.Tom and Marie changed it relatively easily, but others couldn\u2019t change it easily and the shape collapsed in the middle.Joseph changed the square into a triangle.After the triangle, it was changed to a cone, a star, a donut, and a Mobius band, and at this point, only the three supervisors and Oliver were able to follow.\u201cAll right, you\u2019ve followed me well. This is the last. Make the most difficult model you can make. The bigger, the more complex, the better.\u201dIt was time to show off their individual abilities.Everyone bit their teeth tightly because they wanted to leave a good impression here.The first one to show off was Tom, who will soon be becoming a formal disciple.He created the most difficult model he could present to solidify his position.After making the black light into a cylindrical shape, it was drawn long and twisted like a spring to make it a twisted column.Every one admired it as they looked at it.Marie next to him was conscious of him, so she tried to imitate the same shape, but she couldn\u2019t maintain the shape in the middle and it collapsed.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dMarie\u2019s wistful exclamation and Tom\u2019s smirking laugh were heard.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to do it?\u201dJoseph asked, looking at Oliver standing quietly in the back.Oliver looked at Joseph and asked as if he had made a decision after some thought.\u201c\u2026. Can I make it as big and as sophisticated as possible?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHearing Joseph\u2019s short reply, Oliver wrapped his hands with black light, which was different from others.Everyone was curious about what he was doing, but on the inside, they thought Oliver would fail.No, they were hoping for Oliver to fail.The black light in Oliver\u2019s hands fluctuated. It was like an egg on the verge of hatching, and then it became a perfect sphere, firmly stabilizing again.\u201cIt\u2019s just a ball?\u201dIt was then.The black light, which regained stability, quickly shrank and became as small as beads, and soon expanded again to cover the whole classroom.Everyone was stunned because they couldn\u2019t grasp the situation, but along with him, an unbelievable scene unfolded in front of them.A black ivy vine structure covered the entire classroom.It was so elaborate as if it was a real ivy vine, and no one could open their mouth while looking at it.Everyone just looked at Oliver with their eyes open wide.Oliver looked around at the ivy vine and said softly.\u201cOh, it works.\u201dThe next morning.Oliver felt something changed.Not only the fellow workers who despised and ignored him until yesterday, but even the supervisor was somewhat cautious.On the outside, they pretended not to show it, but the light from their bodies told the truth.They were afraid and jealous of Oliver at the same time, and a few had an admiring glow.Oliver didn\u2019t understand the change.At some point in the orphanage and mine, the way people treated him had changed, but this was the first time it had changed in such a short period of time, so Oliver had no clue of why this was happening.However, his worries prevailed only for a while, soon he stopped thinking about it and started his daily routine, cleaning the factory, and began his daily life as usual.Making friends or feeling superior to them was never an option.Now Oliver\u2019s only interest was learning black magic.Perhaps because of the day off due to the class, the piled-up meat was more than twice the usual amount.Oliver carried the lump of meat and brought it near the grinder.The meat was large and heavy, and most of them smelled bad, but the work was comfortable for Oliver compared to the work he did at the mine.Above all, he liked it because it was simple labor, where there was no need for him to use his head, so he could work mechanically and think about other things.For example, reflecting on the class he learned yesterday.At the same time as Oliver kept reflecting on yesterday\u2019s lessons, he kept asking questions and finding breakthroughs.For example, why is it more difficult to extract emotions directly from a person?What is the most efficient way to store emotions?Why are they putting it in a test tube?Like a three-year-old child, he constantly asked himself why and searched for answers on his own.There were times when he stumbled upon the satisfactory answers and sometimes he couldn\u2019t, but the latter was the most, so he felt frustrated and uncomfortable because he couldn\u2019t scratch the surface of the answer.He wanted to hold onto someone and ask questions.\u201cExcuse me\u2026 Aren\u2019t you tired? Can I help you if you don\u2019t mind?\u201dOliver looked up at the sudden voice.There was a worker there.He repeated his words thinking Oliver didn\u2019t listen to his words.\u201cIt must be hard to move the meat alone, can I help you?\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026?\u201dOliver asked the worker.Oliver was not being sarcastic, he was just curious.\u201cOh\u2026 Because it\u2019s hard to do it alone? It\u2019s less tiring if we do it together and\u2026 We\u2019re colleagues. Yes! Colleagues\u2026\u201dOliver knew he wasn\u2019t very smart, but he noticed something didn\u2019t make sense.Suddenly, he questioned whether the worker was a person who would help because he was his colleague.Above all, he was worried about the light circling around the worker.He was smiling, but the light around him was twisted and sly like a snake.It was a shape he had seen more than once before.Yes, it was the light emitted by the director of the orphanage, the mining supervisor, and the inn owner.But he didn\u2019t understand what the worker was trying to achieve by showing such an attitude toward him.\u201cIs that him?\u201cYes, that\u2019s him. It\u2019s only been a week, but in yesterday\u2019s class\u2026\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dOliver turned his head and saw Andrew at a distance, from whom he felt a mosquito-like annoyance, alertness, and hostile light.There were people he saw for the first time, standing at a distance looking at Oliver while emitting a wary light.Oliver felt like a stray dog that\u2019s invaded the territory of another stray dog.He just wanted to learn black magic by doing the quiet work, but all of a sudden troublesome people suddenly started swirling around him.Then, a person came into Oliver\u2019s view.It was Marie.Oliver approached her just in case thinking she might help, but she frowned looking at the approaching Oliver.It wasn\u2019t just her facial expression.Many negative emotions such as anger, jealousy, and anxiety could be seen in the light around her, and Oliver had no choice but to stop approaching her without realizing it when he saw the light.He didn\u2019t know how to respond to the sudden change, and at that moment Andrew called Oliver.\u201cOliver?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cMaster is calling. Follow me.\u201dOliver followed Andrew to the Master\u2019s room.Like the classroom, it was in the basement of the factory, and the splendor of the room can\u2019t be compared with the classroom.A neatly finished walls and ceilings, huge beds, the smell of tangerines floating in the air, furniture he has never seen before\u2026 Yes, it was similar to the luxurious office of the Director of the Mine that Oliver happened to see once.Fortunately, Oliver was not very interested in this, so he did not show any interest.The only thing that interested him was Joseph had called him.\u201cI greet the Master, \u201dOliver greeted Joseph with a sense of recognition.Joseph answered, pouring whiskey into a fancy crystal glass.\u201cYes, come on in. How are you?\u201dOliver tilted his head at the strange question.He didn\u2019t understand what the words meant.\u201cUh, yes. I\u2019m good. \u201d\u201cGood? Really?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 However, I would like to take classes more often.\u201dJoseph, who frowned at the words, burst into laughter.Following Joseph, Andrew burst into laughter.\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s more like you. Is there anything else? Is there anything uncomfortable with people around you, like eating or sleeping?\u201dA lot of things came to Oliver\u2019s mind.A fellow worker who used to pick fights with him, the same bread and soup every day, and a damp, moldy mattress.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Thank you very much for your kindness, Master.\u201dHe mimicked the children\u2019s words that they used while flattering the supervisors.Everyone liked it even though they knew it was a lie, but fortunately, Joseph also seemed to like it.\u201cIt\u2019s a good attitude, no, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good attitude, but I like it. Excellent\u2026 A good boy needs to be given a prize, right? I have good news for you.\u201d\u201cWill you teach me black magic again, Master?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll give you a chance instead. A chance to become a formal disciple.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8\u201cWhat\u2026What does that mean?\u201dA bewildered voice was heard from a place behind the sausage factory.It was a place that people rarely visit, so garbage and junk were piled up everywhere, and rats wandered around.Right now, two men stood in that place.One was as rugged as a backstreet thug, and the other was a blond with a handsome face.It was Tom and Andrew.\u201cCalm down.\u201dAndrew said in an effort to calm Tom down.However, Tom didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of doing that.He was in a panic.\u201cHow can I calm down?!\u2026 a match? A test to become a formal disciple? Why should I do that in the first place? It\u2019s my rightful place!!\u201dTom\u2019s eyes were tearful, which didn\u2019t go well with his rugged appearance.That\u2019s how unfair it was.Indeed, anyone normal would behave like that in a similar situation.Tom, who had secured a seat as a formal disciple and was days away from becoming a formal disciple, has to now have a battle with a boy, who came just a week ago for that seat.But Andrew\u2019s response was callous.\u201cStop\u2026! Stop being so weak. In the first place, it\u2019s already decided. What can you do if you feel wronged?\u201d\u201cOh, but couldn\u2019t Senior Andrew be able to say something?\u201d\u201cDid you think I didn\u2019t say anything? I said! Along with other senior students we spoke to the Master and said that it doesn\u2019t make sense to give such a perk to a guy who\u2019s only been here for a week! But it didn\u2019t work. His last performance was so overwhelming that\u2026.\u201dAndrew blurted the end of his sentence, and Tom felt even more desperate.Tom was there, too.Originally, it was a place to show off his ability as the next formal disciple, but funnily, it became a stage for a guy who stayed here for less than a week.Tom was still suspicious.He couldn\u2019t believe the things that conspired in front of his eyes.As if it wasn\u2019t enough to extract a huge emotion, the new guy processed the emotion into a way bigger and a way stranger shape.Everything felt like a dream \u2014 a terrible dream.Tom said with eyes filled with tears.\u201cIt\u2019s unfair\u2026 It\u2019s unfair, Senior. You know how hard I tried to be a formal disciple.\u201dAt that moment, Andrew pushed Tom toward the wall.\u201cWake up! Get a hold of yourself! I told you, it\u2019s already decided! And this match is a rather good thing for you. If there was a guy with a talent like that, even if you became a formal disciple, you\u2019d one day be pushed out!\u201dTom\u2019s expression grew even darker.He thought of everything he did to get on the good side of Andrew.He stole the sausages from the factory, sold them in the back alley, and gave him all the money, but now instead of helping, he\u2019s getting preached, he couldn\u2019t help but feel wronged hearing it.But there was nothing Tom could do.Since this was the world of black magic.A world where power was everything,Andrew said again.\u201cAgain, it was you who would have got pushed out in the first place. But I persuaded the master along with the other senior disciples to decide it with a match. So you should rather thank me.\u201dTom said nothing, but he was still filled with disappointment.Andrew opened his mouth again with satisfaction.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.I understand you\u2019re hurt, but I think it\u2019s an opportunity.\u201d\u201cOpportunity?\u201d\u201cYeah, opportunity. You see\u2026 that Oliver or something. How talented do you think he is?\u201dTom replied after thinking for a while.\u201c\u2026I think.\u2026he has great talent.\u201d\u201cYeah, but black magic is not just about talent. If you\u2019re going to step on him, there\u2019s no better chance than right now. Think. If someone with that talent is taught in earnest, he\u2019ll someday stand above you. Can you stand a situation in which a guy who just came in, order you around?\u201dTom shook his head firmly.Just being from the streets didn\u2019t mean that he had no pride.No, he was more obsessed with that because he was from the streets.\u201cIt would be hard to hurt him now because the Master is watching him now. Then, you should trample that bugger head-on and proudly.\u201dTom understood the meaning and asked cautiously.\u201cTo trample proudly\u2026\u201dAndrew handed two small glass bottles to Tom.A special glass bottle that had a strange magic line drawn on the outside, and the black light inside it was shaking vigorously.\u201cNo matter how talented he is, all he could have learned right away is the basic skills, Hate Bullet and Black Shield. So, you have to use this. If you open the lid and throw it at him, it will be over.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cMy specialty, Las Bomb. It can completely destroy the simple black shield made by beginners. I wanted to put in stronger black magic, but I compromised as much as I could because it could raise suspicion.\u201dTom\u2019s squeezed the bottle tightly in his hand.\u201cThat guy Oliver is said to be brought from a mine, and he\u2019s actually dull, so he won\u2019t be able to respond to the sudden situation. Then, you can pretend as if you made a mistake and kill him.\u201dTom calculated.If he used the black magic Andrew gave him during the fight, the guy named Oliver would surely be confused by the tremendous firepower, and if he attacked again then, it would be possible enough to make that guy disappear.\u201cThen you\u2019ll be a regular disciple, and the troublemaker will just disappear. Our peace will be preserved. If everything goes well, I\u2019ll take responsibility for you, and raise you to an Intermediate disciple\u2026 no, maybe a senior disciple.\u201dTom\u2019s eyes grew bigger hearing about the position like a nobleman attended by his servants.When it comes to senior disciples they were paid high wages, and they could learn to run a business.It was Tom\u2019s goal, his dream.Farewell to the garbage life\u2026!Tom was suddenly encouraged and motivated.Andrew smirked looking at Tom\u2019s feelings.\u2018As expected, people are easy to handle. The more stupid they are, the easy handling them will be.\u2019Andrew said again.\u201cSo make sure you knock down Oliver. Then I\u2019ll definitely watch your back. OK?\u201dTom nodded, clutching the bottle Andrew handed him.The last day of the month May.Originally, this day was supposed to be the day for the appointment of the new official disciple.The nominee was Tom.It should have been a day where everyone except Tom should have looked sad.However, a small unexpected event occurred, and the day of appointing a formal student suddenly turned into a match day.The match between Tom and Oliver.The prize for the winner was the official disciple position.It was a position that was created thanks to the death of one of the low-level junior disciples due to food poisoning, and no one knew when the seat would be created.Therefore, Tom\u2019s expression was tense.Because he knew how grave the situation was.Oliver, on the other hand, had his usual blank expression.\u00a0As if he didn\u2019t know how much privilege he will be getting if he win the battle!Tom looked around.There were about 30 informal disciples, about 20 low-level junior disciples, about 10 intermediate disciples, and 5 senior disciples.The senior and intermediate disciples laughed and talked leisurely, treating the match as entertainment, and what was even more annoying was the eyes of the informal disciples.Their eyes were shining cold with insidious expectations, expecting Tom\u2019s downfall.This made Tom\u2019s rage rise up.\u2018Let\u2019s see who\u2019s going to go down?\u2019Tom fiddled with the two bottles of glass that were in his pocket while thinking.He thought that if he used it properly, Oliver, the guy who came in just a week ago, would be finished in an instant.He thought maybe he might get caught in the eyes of the master and be taught more by him.If that happens, Tom thought he might become a senior disciple, and one day, he might become a true warlock and say goodbye to his life at the bottom of society.After thinking about it, Tom came up to the podium with courage and desire.Oliver came up next.\u201cWell then, we don\u2019t need useless rhetoric, do we? Prove your worth with force. Start the Match!\u201dTom, hearing the words of Joseph, extracted the emotions from the test tube he was given and shot Hate Bullet immediately.Since he learned the basics, Oliver managed to prevent the attack by making a small black shield.\u2018Of course. No matter how talented you are, it\u2019s hard to learn black magic in such a short time!\u2019\u2018I can win!\u2019\u2018I can win. Yes!\u2019Tom screamed inwardly, extracting emotions from the test tube again and shooting Hate Bullet.Although it was the basics of the basics, it was a powerful and efficient attack.Oliver seemed like giving his all to block the attack, let alone counterattacking.Tom didn\u2019t lose his momentum and continued to shoot Hate Bullet.Bullets of hate flooded in, and Oliver spread a small black shield every time.A black bullet that cuts through the air, a black curtain that blocks the bullet.At that moment a voice was heard in the head of Tom who was on the offensive.-Stop! you\u2019ve already used a lot of emotions. Be careful!Tom stopped at that moment.He heard Andrew\u2019s voice in his head.It was a kind of telepathy.Tom paused the attack, as Andrew advised, and examined the emotions left on the test tube.Surprisingly, as Andrew said, only one-third of the emotions were left in the test tube.Maybe it\u2019s natural because he kept attacking like that.However, what was surprising was Oliver\u2019s condition.Even though he attacked so hard, there was not even a scratch on him.Far from being hurt, there was no expression on his face, and the emotions left in the test tube were similar to what they were when they were first handed out.At that moment Tom realized.Oliver was not in a hurry to stop his attack, he just stopped it moderately.He was just playing around with him.Like a thug fighting a weak child.At that moment Tom felt a surge of anger.He felt humiliated.Tom took out a glass bottle hidden in his pocket.Then he shouted.\u201cLet\u2019s see if you can stop this and get away with it! Las Bomb!\u201dTom threw a fist-sized black bead at Oliver.Oliver hurriedly spread the black shield in surprise, but it was meaningless.The moment the bomb of anger touched the black shield, a huge explosion erupted, and the basement shook.The people who were sitting close to Oliver fell backward, while screams and admiration poured out from here and there.\u201cDid you just see that?\u201d\u201cHow did an informal disciple learn the Las Bomb\u2026!\u201d\u201cHow did he learn that?\u201d\u201cYou have to be in the intermediate disciple level to learn it?\u201dTom smiled.He imprinted his presence on every one.He thought that the master now had no choice but to keep an eye on him.\u2018ha! Look at that. You bragged about your talent, and see where you eventually\u2026 Huh?\u2019The smile on Tom\u2019s face started disappearing.It was because as the smoke gradually cleared up, he saw Oliver standing there leisurely.\u201cWow\u2026..how did you do that?\u201dOliver said, looking at Tom.Far from being afraid, there wasn\u2019t a hint of surprise.He was rather pleased.\u2018What? How? No way\u2026.This is Senior Andrew\u2019s spell. How can he..?\u2019Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!Tom felt a strange feeling \u2014 A feeling he never felt\u2018Yes, something must be wrong. There\u2019s no way a kid who just came in can stop this attack\u2026\u2019Tom hurriedly pulled out the last remaining Las Bomb without noticing the situation he was in.He opened the glass bottle and threw it at Oliver once again, and when Oliver saw it, he shot Hate Bullet at that bottle, and in an instant, it exploded in the air.Once again, a huge roar swept the area.However, the difference this time was Tom also got swept away as he couldn\u2019t overcome the shock and fell backward.\u201cHuh? Ugh?\u201dUnlike his usual self, Tom groaned when he looked at Oliver standing still with a black shield.\u2018What the hell is that? What kind of monster am I fighting with?\u2019Along with fear a lot of questions popped up in his head.\u2018Why?? This should be the day I get appointed as a formal disciple\u2026Why?\u2019\u2018Why?? This should be the day I will be eating a proper meal rather than the tasteless bread and soup\u2026Why?\u2019\u2018Why?? This should be the day I will be starting to learn black magic rather than working in the factory\u2026.Why?\u2026 What the hell is this?\u2019\u201cAre you all right?\u201dOliver said as he approached.All Tom could do was scream and look around.\u201cPlease\u2026. help me.\u201dBut, there was no one to help, and all he could see were cold eyes sneering at him.It was the gaze that he received while wandering the streets.Anger rose inside Tom.Anger at the world, anger at the sudden appearance of a hurdle.Tom tried to fight again using this anger as the source, but at that moment he heard the voice of the devil.\u201cOh, that\u2019s a relief. You\u2019re all right,\u201dSaying that the devil reached out.And soon the devil started extracting Tom\u2019s anger\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dTom opened his eyes wide, but Oliver immediately stopped paying attention to Tom and began processing the extracted anger.\u201cIt\u2019s called, Las Bomb\u2026right?\u201dTom\u2019s instinct shouted asking him to run away, but the body didn\u2019t move.\u2018What the hell is he?!\u2019Oliver once again processed the Las Bomb.He compressed the bomb to the size of a fist and placed it on hate bullet.He aimed at Tom in that state.\u201c\u2026.. Aren\u2019t you going to defend yourself?\u201dInstinctively Tom deployed the Black Shield, praying to God.\u2018Please, just this once, help me, save me.\u2019As he was praying, the devil opened his mouth and said,\u201cLas Bullet.\u201dThe bullet of anger flew at the chant in a straight line and penetrated the black shield.The bullet penetrated through Tom without any mercy and exploded inside Tom\u2019s body along with him.BOOOOMRed showers started pouring down at the sound of the explosion which was incomparable to that of Tom\u2019s Las Bomb.When everyone\u2019s gaze was fixed on the podium, someone\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cThe winner, Oliver.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Tiles on the floor, pipes connected to the walls, steam in the air.Oliver, who won the showdown, went to wash in the shower in the basement after being declared the winner by Joseph.Washing with warm water was quite unfamiliar as this was the first time in his life, but it wasn\u2019t too bad nonetheless.It was much easier to wash in warm water than in cold water, so just by bringing his face to the stream, the hard blood droplets easily fall offAfter washing up, Oliver wiped himself with a towel and went outside.The clothes he had put in the basket were gone, and instead, there was a new set of clothes which he saw for the first time.\u201c\u2026..\u201dOliver stood still, not sure what to do thinking where the hell did his clothes go?He wanted to go out and find his clothes, but at that time he heard a voice coming from outside the door.\u201cThat\u2026 Did you finish washing up?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDid you finish washing up?\u201dThis is the first time he heard this voice, but he answered,\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOkay then. Get dressed and come out. I\u2019ll tell you where you will live from now on.\u201dOliver turned to the strangely trembling voice and said,\u201cThere is a problem.\u201d\u201cProblem?\u201d\u201cYes, my clothes are missing?\u201d\u201cThat rag\u2026 no clothes?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI threw them away. I have placed new clothes into the basket, so just change into them. Even as a low-level disciple, you have to consider our master\u2019s face and should have some dignity. Why? Is it, by any chance, an important outfit?\u201d \u201d\u201cNo. No.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201dA sigh of relief can be heard through the door.Oliver took out the new set of clothes from the basket and put them on, as the voice said.A white shirt, jeans with suspenders, and a black jacket.It was a little bigger than Oliver\u2019s body, but there was no problem.Rather, it could be said to be a blessing.It was the best outfit Oliver had ever worn, although the party involved didn\u2019t really care much.After getting dressed, he opened the door and went out.Outside the door stood a young man who looked about five years older than Oliver,\u201c\u2026.Are you done changing?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d\u201c really? Then\u2026 follow me.\u201dThe strangely rigid man spoke and moved awkwardly.He seemed to be treating him as his subordinate, but he was still cautious, but when Oliver looked at his feelings, he could see that he was scared.Oliver didn\u2019t understand what was wrong with him, but he didn\u2019t care to know about it.After passing through an ant-hill-like hallway, they arrived at a huge dormitory.There were about ten people.The number of people was similar to when he was an informal disciple, but the size and quality of the room were completely different.Although crude, there was one proper iron bed according to the number of people, and next to the bed was a cabinet table and a small desk where personal items could be stored.It was incomparable to a barn that had only a damp mattress.\u201cThis is your dormitory.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dOliver turned his head and stared.The young man who said those words was sweating as if his gaze was burdensome.Even Intermediate disciples are not qualified to have a private room, it\u2019s only possible if you become a senior disciple.Oliver asked, \u201cDo I stay here? Do I\u2026? \u201d\u201cHuh? Uh, now that you\u2019re a junior disciple, shouldn\u2019t you stay here?\u201dOliver tilted his head as if he didn\u2019t know because he really didn\u2019t know.The only reason he wanted to become a junior disciple was to learn black magic, and it didn\u2019t include any improvement in life or treatment.No, it would be more accurate to say that he didn\u2019t even think about it at all.Oliver asked again, just in case.\u201cCan I really stay here?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s your seat.\u201dThe young man pointed towards the worst place in the corner.Oliver approached and looked at it.A bed that was neither damp nor moldy, a warm-looking blanket, sturdy cabinets, a hanger, etc.\u201cAh, if you don\u2019t like the seat\u2026\u201d\u201cI like it.\u201d\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dWhen Oliver expressed his gratitude, the young man breathed a sigh of relief, and then opened his mouth again with courage.\u201cThen\u2026..Let me tell you about some rules\u201dRules.Oliver pricked up his ears.There were rules in the orphanage, there were rules in the Mine, and also in the factory above.If you break the rules, you will be beaten hard and will be kicked out.Oliver felt he can finally learn black magic, so he thought it would be unfair if he got chased out.\u201cWhat are the rules?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026it\u2019s not a big deal, it\u2019s about the role you have to play as a junior disciple. First of all, I\u2019m the leader of this room. So you have to follow my instructions.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026Sir.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to \u2026\u2026 Anyway, I\u2019ll explain again. A junior disciple is considered an official disciple, but still in the lowest rank of the family. Informal disciples and servants are not formal family members. Do you understand?\u201dOliver didn\u2019t know what a servant was or what a family was, but still, he nodded.\u201cOkay, the servants do the chores, such as preparing meals and cleaning the room, but we have to clean important places. For example, the classroom, labs, workshops, study rooms, etc. Master likes clean things, so you have to clean them every morning. Did you understand?\u201dOliver nodded again.\u201cAside from that, it\u2019s our duty to run small errands for our seniors and to help with experiments\u201d\u201cExperiment?\u201d\u201cYeah, you just have to do what they tell you to do.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 I see. But, sir, can I ask you something?\u201d\u201cWhat, what is it?\u201d\u201cWhen will I be able to receive our master\u2019s instruction?\u201d\u201cUh, junior students are usually educated once every two weeks. In some cases, classes are conducted once a month, still, most of them are self-study based on the content of the class.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dA strange disappointment flashed across Oliver\u2019s corpse-like-blank face.Originally he was happy to be able to attend classes regularly, but there were still so few.He thought he would be able to take a new class every day.Perhaps aware of such feelings, the room leader spoke to comfort him.\u201cMaster is busy teaching seniors and managing the business, so there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. And don\u2019t work too hard.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dOliver asked sincerely, he had just become a junior disciple, so why he shouldn\u2019t work hard.The leader didn\u2019t answer, kept his mouth shut, and then mumbled.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 um, no, just don\u2019t worry about it. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to tell you. Do you have any more questions?\u201d\u201cThere is none.\u201d\u201cOkay. So, let\u2019s get along well from now on\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s right. Check the drawers and check all the stuff. Make sure there are notebooks and pencils, if you say there isn\u2019t later, they won\u2019t be given out except at regular distribution times.\u201dOliver opened the drawer and checked, and just as the room chief said, there was an old, yellowish notebook, a pencil that looked like it had been used, and a messy eraser.\u201cWhy are they here\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Don\u2019t you have to write something to learn black magic in earnest?\u201dDuring his personal time, Oliver left the basement and went up to the surface.Unlike when he was an informal disciple, he did not work in the factory, so he had more time to utilize than he expected, but that didn\u2019t mean he came to the ground for no reason.Oliver came out to the workshop through the sausage box and junk and visited the factory workshop where he used to clean up.There were a lot of crushed meat crumbs and trash on the floor, and when the informal disciples who were cleaning them found Oliver, they quickly lowered their eyes and bowed their headsNow that Oliver is an official disciple, he was above them.Of course, it wasn\u2019t just that.When Oliver saw the sudden change in the attitude of his fellow workers, he tilted his head.They were jealous and envious of Oliver, at the same time they also had fear and anger.He saw the light similar to that of the room leader, so he couldn\u2019t really understand.Oliver approached one of the informal disciples.\u201d Can I ask you something?\u201d\u201cuh, yes?\u201d\u201cWhere is Supervisor Marie?\u201dThe worker said that Marie was in a corner of the factory, and when Oliver actually went to check it out, she was standing alone behind a huge, red, rusted, unused grinder.Oliver subconsciously examined her emotions.She looked very sad and depressed.\u201cSupervisor Marie?\u201dOliver called her politely while tapping her shoulder.Marie, who was lost in her thoughts got startled, and she looked at Oliver with a surprised expression, and then she quickly furrowed her eyebrow.\u201cOliver\u2026 sir.\u201d\u201cYes, hello?\u201dOliver said hello.But her frown only deepened further.She extruded unpleasantness in the form of light, and Oliver had no way of knowing why, and she was a little perplexed.She then opened her mouth again.\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to ask you a favor.\u201d\u201cFavor? Ha\u2026 Are you kidding me now?\u201d\u201cWhat? No.\u201d\u201cSo, how can someone who became a formal disciple within ten days of entering the factory ask for a favor from me, who has been an informal disciple for 6 years?\u201dShe meant to be sarcastic, but unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work for Oliver, who didn\u2019t understand the sarcasm and just answered honestly.\u201cIf I want to learn black magic formally, I have to learn letters and numbers. But I\u2019ve never learned anything like that. So, can you teach me?\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dMarie was silent. She found it ridiculous.Oliver asked cautiously as if he had noticed something.\u201cDid I make a mistake?\u201d\u201cmistake\u2026 No, you didn\u2019t make a mistake. What kind of mistake would an official disciple make against someone like me?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cUgh! Relief, What\u2026!\u201dIn the end, Marie exploded at Oliver\u2019s frustrating attitude.Her shout echoed throughout the factory, but Marie, who realized it late, covered her face in anguish, but Oliver remained the same.\u201cI must have done something wrong\u2026 I don\u2019t know what it is, but I\u2019m sorry?\u201dMarie sat down on her seat with a powerless expression, it\u2019s hard to say whether she was tired or exhausted.\u201c\u2026. No. I was at fault. I was born in a shrewd corner and I\u2019m rotting here because I didn\u2019t have talent in magic. Who\u2019s at fault, It\u2019s all my fault. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201dIt sounded like a resigned voice, but Oliver saw something.It was the emotions of her obsession.Yet at the same time the emotions of nervousness and fear, it was like a vortex of light, which looked a little pretty.Oliver didn\u2019t know how to react, so he stood still until she regained her composure, and after a moment Marie spoke.\u201c\u2026. Do you want me to teach you how to write and calculate numbers?\u201d\u201cYes. so, can you do it? Have you ever studied them?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I studied. You have to study them too. But, why are you asking me to teach you? Most of the Junior disciples you will be living with from now on know how to write.\u201dOliver answered, looking into the air, wondering as if it was difficult to answer.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s a little,\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain. The way they see me is like a child standing in front of the supervisor.\u201dMarie frowned again at the incomprehensible words, but Oliver soon followed up with further explanations.\u201cI\u2019m from the mines, and I was scared of the supervisor there. All the kids there were scared when they saw the supervisor, so they lied about anything to avoid getting in trouble no matter what the supervisor asked them. And, the junior disciples are also looking at me with the same light as the children in the Mine look at the supervisor.\u201dIt was a brief explanation, but fortunately, Marie understood the meaning.Is it normal that junior students are afraid of Oliver?Tom, who was soon to be a junior disciple, was killed by Oliver.But there was something even more surprising.\u201c\u2026\u2026. No way. Can you read emotions?\u201dOliver tilted his head.\u201cMaybe? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cOh my God\u2026 That\u2019s the second stage of [Mind\u2019s eye]. The first stage of the [Mind\u2019s eye] is looking at emotions? It\u2019s not fair\u2026 Since when did you start reading emotions?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 from the beginning?\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s blunt answer, Marie only smiled dejectedly, as if she was exhausted from being angry.She knew that the world is unfair. And she too admitted it, but today she realized it was a mistake.\u2018How could it be so unfair?\u2019She felt it was so sad and hopeless that she couldn\u2019t even cry.At that moment, Oliver asked again without noticing anything.\u201cThen, what about Words and numbers?\u201cAww! really\u2026.! Why do I have to help you? I don\u2019t even know when I\u2019ll be demoted to a servant! I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll get another chance! Why should I spend my precious time with you?! Why?!\u201dMarie spoke with her emotions, not her head.After some moment, when she regained her composure, Oliver opened his mouth\u201cBefore coming here, I heard you were a servant. What is a servant?\u201dSilence filled the space for a while.Marie, who was no longer in the mood to be angry, simply answered in a weak voice.\u201c\u2026\u2026It means a slave who will take care of the handsome official disciples. It\u2019s the end of being an informal disciple. People like me who haven\u2019t been promoted for a long time, become servants, who cook and clean until they get old.\u201d\u201cAre you sad now?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m sad. Damn it\u2026! Do you think I came here to be a maid for the rest of my life? Of course not, I\u2019m here to be a warlock. I really don\u2019t have enough time now! But you want me to use that time for you. For you who have talents, I don\u2019t have?! That\u2019s \u2026.\u201dAs soon as Marie finished her words, she covered her face with her hands as if she was in great pain.Her invisible lump of sorrow seemed to crush her.Perhaps, if it was left as it is, after a few days, she wouldn\u2019t have borne the weight and might have become wretched.Fortunately, nothing like that happened.\u201c\u2026\u2026Didn\u2019t Supervisor Marie say? Next time if I were to ask for help, I had to bring something?\u201dMarie tilted her head slightly.\u201cIf Supervisor Marie teaches me letters and numbers, I will teach you too.\u201d\u201c\u2026.. What?\u201d\u201cBlack magic.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Oliver adapted himself to the life as a junior disciple without difficultyIn fact, the word \u201cadaptation\u201d was ridiculous.All he had to do was to get up early every morning and clean the classroom, laboratory, workshop, and study.It was just like when he used to be an informal disciple, and the amount of work was frankly incomparably small.After cleaning, it\u2019s breakfast.He couldn\u2019t eat to his heart\u2019s content because he ate it after the Senior and Intemediate formal disciples, but nevertheless, he was able to enjoy a plentiful meal that could not be compared to when he was an informal disciple because he received sausages, ham, thick soup, and freshly baked bread every day.What was rather painful was that he was suddenly freed with improved life and a plethora of personal time.Oliver asked the room leader when he would be able to attend class, just in case.\u201cThat is what the Master decides. Since the last class was taken a while ago, I don\u2019t think there will be any class soon.\u201dOliver sighed and asked when the study would be available.Oliver hasn\u2019t fully learned how to write yet, but if he read it properly, he thought it would be possible to self-study with a book.However, this question also returned with a disappointing answer.\u201cIt won\u2019t be available. Only the master can use the study. Anyone can\u2019t open up valuable knowledge, right? At the very least, Sir Andrew could use something??\u201dAndrew is a disciple who carries out Joseph\u2019s orders.Oliver was about to ask what he had to do to become a senior disciple, but he gave up.Maybe it\u2019s because of one of the instincts that helped him survive at the orphanage and the mine?This question seemed to endanger him.As such, Oliver had a dull and boring day, and he went to see Marie in his spare time to learn letters and numbers.Even though he didn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll ever need it.\u201cOh, that\u2019s fast\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dMarie spoke, and Oliver questioned.She spoke again in a tone of admiration.\u201cIt\u2019s about the speed of learning\u2026. you started learning the alphabet a while ago, and now you know how to use not only words but also sentences correctly\u2026. It\u2019s amazing.\u201dShe praised Oliver sincerely, but he was not particularly pleased.Learning the letters was not his goal.Letters are just a road that leads to learning black magic.Can a person be happy if they reach the road and can\u2019t reach the destination?Oliver felt the same when he heard that he can\u2019t use the study freely.Obviously, Joseph\u2019s goal was to train a good warlock, but something didn\u2019t make sense.Marie, who noticed Oliver\u2019s condition, asked.\u201cAre you okay? You look weak?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I became a junior disciple, but I couldn\u2019t attend classes or use the study room.\u201dOliver said without thinking.It was too much to say to Marie, who was in danger of not being able to become a lower-level disciple.Even so, as if Marie had gotten used to it now, she just accepted it bluntly.\u201cAbsolutely. The study is like a treasure trove of black magic wisdom. You can\u2019t let a lower-class disciple use it, right?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s question, Marie was speechless for a moment, thinking about how to explain it in an easy way.\u201cAh! It\u2019s to make a difference.\u201d\u201cDifference\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, making a difference. You can\u2019t treat superior people and inferior people the same way, right? Because the values are different.\u201dOliver didn\u2019t answer, but it wasn\u2019t an expression of understanding.No, it was an expression that did not understand a single word of what Marie said.Marie described it as if she was treating a three-year-old child.\u201cUh, how do I explain this? Ummm\u2026 ah! How is life these days? Sleeping or eating?\u201dOliver replied.\u201cA clean bed, a small desk, and sausages, hams, and bacon for every breakfast.\u201dAfter hearing his answer, Marie said with a bitter expression on her face.\u201cIt\u2019s just like that. If even the informal disciple gets sausages every morning, do you think I and the other kids will try and work hard? Furthermore, we would not have tried to become a warlock at all.\u201dOliver tilted his head once more.\u201cUh\u2026 So, is Supervisor Marie learning black magic to eat sausages?\u201dAt the stupid question that flew in again, Marie was dumbfounded and touched her forehead.It was an incredibly disrespectful gesture for an informal disciple to do to a formal disciple, but seeing Oliver\u2019s stupid attitude, she couldn\u2019t help it.\u201cNo. Do you think people learn black magic for sausage and ham? Ah\u2026 I\u2019m really curious, why is Oliver learning black magic?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s fun\u201dAn answer without a single hesitation.Marie was so confused that she didn\u2019t even dare to argue.Marie shook her head and spoke again.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t learn for that. There is a more practical reason.\u201d\u201cPractical reason?\u201dOliver was interested.Originally, Marie wouldn\u2019t have answered, but for some reason, she answered without knowing,\u201cBecause this is my only hope,\u201d said Marie,\u201cHope?\u201d\u201cYeah, it was the only hope for someone at the bottom of society like me. If I become a warlock, I can become strong enough to live without anyone looking down on me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 I think you wouldn\u2019t be able to relate. And most of the people here practice black magic for the same reason as mine rather than the reasons like Oliver\u2019s.\u201dOliver didn\u2019t bother speaking.He looked at her feelings and knew she was sincere.Of course, he didn\u2019t sympathize with her words, but her emotions were interesting.\u201cSo, does Supervisor Marie want to become a warlock to become stronger?\u201d\u201cOf course. I wouldn\u2019t be belittled for being a woman, and I could wipe out all the as*holes who look down on me by myself. I can make a lot more money\u2026The warlock, although people are wary of them, at least they aren\u2019t ignored.\u201dOliver listened to Marie with interest.While Marie was speaking, her emotions fluctuated, and the light in which many emotions were intertwined looked quite pretty.\u201cHave you seen it by yourself?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201d You said Warlocks are strong\u2026 Have you ever seen them fight?\u201dMarie pondered for a moment, and then she opened her mouth very carefully. It was as if she was opening a gift wrapper.\u201c\u2026. once, when I was picked up by the master. The fearless neighborhood b*stards had an argument, the master didn\u2019t even flick an eyebrow and finished it all. On the spot\u2026 It was amazing. Up until that point, no one could ever say anything to them even though those bastards did all sorts of things, at that time I was completely shocked. So I\u2019m trying to become a warlock. To become strong like our master.\u201dOliver nodded his head curiously.Marie smiled humbly as if embarrassed by the delay.\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about this anymore. It\u2019s a bit embarrassing.\u201d\u201cYeah, okay.\u201dHe had already heard everything he wanted, so Oliver graciously accepted.Marie narrowed her eyes as if displeased with the reply.\u201c\u2026 Is there any problem?\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 No. It\u2019s alright. Then, can you help me with my studies now that you\u2019ve finished learning to write?\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dOliver answered right away, pushed the notebook and pencil to the side, and sat down on the floor cross-legged.His posture was quite stable, and Marie also sat cross-legged just like Oliver did.\u201cWell, excuse me for a moment.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs soon as Oliver got an answer, he reached out to Marie and extracted her emotions.A small group of light gathered at Oliver\u2019s fingertips, and the light regained its stability in an instant.His control over the light was as skillful as breathing, and he seemed to have already surpassed even an intermediate disciple in controlling the emotions.Admiring the ghostly skill, Marie put her hands together, and Oliver placed her emotions on them.\u201cTry to stabilize it.\u201dAs soon as Oliver said it, the emotions that had stabilized fluctuated and tried to unravel. Marie frowned and focused her mind on her fingertips.The emotions were more difficult than dealing with the emotions extracted from the flask, but the emotions slowly regained their stability showing that her efforts so far were not in vain.Marie took a shallow breath, and sweat appeared on her forehead. But it was just the beginning.\u201cNow make a shape. Uh\u2026 conical?\u201dWithout saying anything, Marie immediately manipulated the emotions.The emotions which floated in the air fluctuated for a moment, and then slowly began to change into a cone.\u201cWell, this time make it a diamond.\u201dHe threw another demand, Marie reinvigorated herself and tried to change the emotions, it was harder than the first, but Oliver didn\u2019t mind and the order continued.\u201cNow square.\u201d\u201cCircle again.\u201d\u201cThis time in the shape of a star.\u201d\u201cIn the shape of a donut.\u201d\u201cWell, this time\u2026\u201d\u201cWait a minute!\u201dDrenched in a cold sweat, Marie said urgently. She breathed heavily, feeling exhausted. It seemed difficult for her to stabilize the emotions any longer.\u201cNow, can we just take a break for a second? It\u2019s hard.\u201d\u201cThis time, let\u2019s make it into the shape of a cobweb.\u201dOliver ignored Marie\u2019s words, and she tried to say it again, but Oliver spoke adamantly.\u201cThe cobweb.\u201dThe pressure was hard to explain. Marie, who was exhausted, concentrated her mind and crudely created the shape of a cobweb.But before long, the shape began to collapse, and at that moment, Oliver placed his hands around Marie\u2019s hands as if they were overlapping.\u201cWhat now\u201d\u201cNothing, just Concentrate.\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s words, Marie focused again.The unstable emotions regained their composure and turned into a cobweb, with which she felt a surprising sensation.Through Oliver and his folded hands, she could indirectly feel how Oliver helped, it was a mysterious experience that she had never felt before.If she had to compare it, it was like someone holding you from behind when you were learning to ride a bicycle.\u201cThe cobweb is complete,\u201d said Marie.Although the lines were thick and the spacing between the lines was wide, it was just a clumsy cobweb, but still, it was completed somehow.Marie looked at Oliver cautiously, which was unlike her.As she was in the position of being taught, she started looking at him without her knowing, and fortunately, Oliver seemed to be somewhat satisfied.\u201cUm\u2026 well done.\u201dThe compliment surprisingly pleased Marie.\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d\u201cWould you like to relax your hands for a moment?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dAs soon as she answered, her hand trembled.Upon inspection, it turned out that Oliver was manipulating emotions through Marie\u2019s hands, while he was making a web.Not a clumsy cobweb, like the one Marie made, but a very sophisticated cobweb with hundreds of fine threads intertwined.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cConcentrate.\u201dMarie shut her mouth and focused her attention according to Oliver\u2019s instructions. And as if indulging, she felt the cobwebs being made one by one.It was a delicate and beautiful feeling that cannot be described in words.As the layers of the cobwebs formed, Oliver opened his mouth.\u201cDo you know roughly how to do it?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 yes. Even though I did not understand everything, I think I understand a little bit.\u201d\u201cThen, when you are alone, keep reminding yourself of that feeling, and imagine it in your head.\u201d\u201cImagine?\u201d\u201cYeah, that would be of some help. Remember, we will only practice this next time.\u201dOliver finished talking and looked at his watch. He still didn\u2019t know how to see time, but he could tell the difference between small and long hands.\u201cThe small needle\u2026is on 1. The long needle\u2026 is on 4. I\u2019ll get going. The leader told me to come to the back side of the factory when the small needle reached 1 and the long needle reached 6.\u201d\u201cWhat? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. They said they were going to gather ingredients.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 the ingredients?\u201d\u201cYou know something?\u201d\u201cProbably, they are going to gather ingredients for a product.\u201d\u201cYou mean for sausage?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s a real product. Probably, you will be moving with the intermediate disciples\u2026. Listen carefully and be careful.\u201d\u201cOh, okay. Then, I will go.\u201dOliver walked away without looking back. Seeing this, Marie felt strange.\u2018Is that it?\u2019Without realizing it, she called him.\u201cOliver!\u201d\u201c\u2026. Yes?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026.. Be careful, and\u2026 Thank you for teaching me.\u201dOliver looked at the face of Marie and replied.\u201c\u2026.Yes, Supervisor Marie too worked hard.\u201dAnd then he walked again.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Behind Joseph\u2019s sausage factory, several children gathered.They were about 16 to 19 years old.Their attire varied, but the common thing was, that they were not well dressed.Some wore dresses that were out of fashion a long time ago, and some wore dresses that did not fit their body.The children talked to each other without caring about their dress as if they were already used to it.\u201cHasn\u2019t it been a long time since we went to gather ingredients?\u201d\u201cYes, there was the Master\u2019s trip and so on, thus the schedule got delayed.\u201d\u201cWould you like to walk around for a while?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m fine, but is it okay to go out?\u201d\u201cMaybe, it\u2019s alright.\u201d\u201cIf we\u2019re lucky, we can save some money and eat something delicious. I want to eat something called ice cream. I heard that it\u2019s popular in Landa, right now.\u201d\u201cIs there a place that sells such things in this neighborhood?\u201dIt was noisy, and the two Room leaders who were checking the number of people suddenly shouted.\u201cWhat the f*ck? It\u2019s one person short, Who\u2019s it damn it!\u201d said the room Leader, irritatingly.Although ingredient collection is a chore, it\u2019s definitely an important part of the family business.So they couldn\u2019t believe that one of the junior disciples hadn\u2019t taken the job seriously.Thus the room leader had no choice but to lose his temper.They are the ones who will get in trouble if they are caught by intermediate disciples.Leader A raised his voice more irritatingly.\u201cWhich one is late? Everybody, get up on your feet! Let me check!\u201dThen, Leader B interjected. \u201cCalm down, I know who\u2019s late.\u201d\u201cWho? Which f*cker messed with the rules.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201dHearing the words Leader A\u2019s anger cooled down sharply.Recently, there was only one person who\u2019s referred to as \u2018him\u2019 by the junior disciples.He became a formal disciple in less than 10 days after he came in, and literally killed one person in the process.And when everyone was silent hearing who wasn\u2019t there, a voice was heard.\u201cHello,\u201dOliver trudged in and greeted.All the junior disciples who had come first didn\u2019t open their mouths in response.Originally, it would have been right to be angry that the youngest disciple was coming late, but no one did.They were pretending not to be angry, remembering the last duel between Oliver and Tom.But there was a courageous man among the group.The person in charge, Leader B, managed to open his mouth.\u201cWhy, why are you so late?\u201dOliver said, showing the watch on his wrist.\u201cShort needle on 1, the long needle on 6\u2026 Didn\u2019t you say that was the time to gather?\u201dThe room Leader looked at the watch.\u201cThat\u2019s true, but as the youngest member, you have to come out earlier.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 I\u2019m sorry,\u201dOliver bowed his head immediately and begged for forgiveness.Begging really didn\u2019t mean much for Oliver.This was normal in the orphanage and Mine.However, the room Leader smiled faintly because he thought he had kept his dignity.\u201cWell, be careful next time\u2026\u201dAs soon as it was about to end well, a third voice intervened.\u201cWhat do you mean by be careful next time?\u201dEveryone turned their heads in the direction of the sound.There were intermediate disciples there.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dSLAP\u201cWhat do you mean by that? Tell me what do you mean by be careful next time?\u201dThe intermediate disciple asked, hitting the Leader again in the face.\u201cSince when has discipline in our family been this lax? If it were me, I would have beat the sh*t out of the guy for being a little late. Like this!\u201dThe intermediate disciple kicked Oliver in the chest.\u201cI\u2019m just curious, is it supposed to be like this? Or are you only soft on this guy? You\u2019re not scared, are you?\u201dThe intermediate disciple who kicked Oliver asked interrogatively.The Leader was almost in tears when another intermediate disciple intervened.\u201cCome on, stop, we got work to do today.\u201dOnly then did the intermediate disciple who kicked Oliver stopped.The mediator briefly explained today\u2019s schedule to change the mood and reached out to Oliver, who collapsed.\u201cAre you all right?\u201dOliver looked at him.A man with dark brown hair who gave a likable impression on the outside, though not at all on the inside.\u201cYes, thank you,\u201dOliver replied, holding hands.Ingredient collection is the collection of emotions and materials necessary for the family business, and the work was done by intermediate and junior disciples.It was done in a group of three \u2013 One intermediate disciple, and two junior disciples.In principle, a group of three had to travel around each assigned area, while the actual work was done by the intermediate disciple, the junior disciple should learn the process, and was also in charge of miscellaneous work.\u201cDo you understand?\u201d said an intermediate disciple who helped Oliver and the Leader.The intermediate disciples\u2019 name was Rasso.While being scolded by other intermediate disciples, he not only helped the Leader and Oliver but also nominated them for assisting him with ingredient collection.The room Leader bowed his head in a panic.\u201cOh, thank you so much for your help,\u201dOliver bowed his head along with the Room Leader.\u201cThank you very much.\u201dRasso said, waving modestly.\u201cNo, no, no. I chose it because I wanted you to be comfortable. Peter, you\u2019re famous for your hard work, and Oliver\u2026 who\u2019s famous these days. Are you okay where you got hit?\u201dOliver replied with a nod.\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine. Thank you for your help.\u201d\u201cNo, no. If you really feel thankful,\u00a0 you can pay me back when you get out in the world. You look very talented,\u201dRasso said, waving his hand and laughing.But Oliver kept on bowing.\u201cWell, okay, let\u2019s start. Since everyone left. The schedule is not tight, but just in case. Have you got everything we need?\u201dThe room Leader immediately checked and answered.\u201cYes. I\u2019ve got the test tube bag, and here\u2019s the money, and here\u2019s the mask.\u201dRasso checked his arm, and then he said,\u201cLet\u2019s all wear the mask.\u201dPeter looked at the leather mask and handed the most handsome one to Rasso, and the other one to Oliver.Oliver looked at the leather mask, and then noticed something strange.It was not just a leather mask, but a face that seemed to be peeled off from a person\u2019s face.\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d\u201cJust put it on.\u201dOliver looked at the mask and put it on his face casually.Then a startling sensation arose.Not only his face but also his whole body felt the touch of a leather mask.Oliver looked at his hand unconsciously.The pale and thin arms disappeared completely, and instead, black and thick forearms were there.Oliver pressed his arm with curiosity. It was similar to adding a mask, but it felt somewhat strange, and it was not uncomfortable.\u201cIt\u2019s a black magic item called [Fake Face]. It not only changes your face but also your body. It\u2019s more like a mask all over your body.\u201dWith Rasso\u2019s kind explanation, Oliver was intrigued.He couldn\u2019t believe that something like this could be done with black magic.A thump was felt in Oliver\u2019s cold heart.\u201cIs this the product?\u201d\u201cThe product? Oh, to a certain extent? But it\u2019s not the main item. Fake faces are expensive, so bank robbers and gangsters buy them every once in a while. The main product is separate.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dOliver asked again.Peter stopped Oliver as if saying it was inappropriate, but Rasso smiled and gestured as if it was OK.\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. If you want to be a black wizard, you have to have that much desire to explore. But not everyone thinks it\u2019s good, so you have to be careful.\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll teach him properly.\u201dPeter bowed instead of Oliver.Nevertheless, Oliver wanted to hear an answer, so Rasso thought for a while and opened his mouth.\u201cUh\u2026 We have work to do. I\u2019ll let you know on the way. What do you think?\u201dOliver bowed his head and answered yes.Rasso laughed and said as if he liked the look very much.\u201cOkay, follow me, we\u2019ll go to our area.\u201dOliver followed with a briefcase containing the test tubes.Oliver didn\u2019t know where the area was, but he followed diligently, and suddenly Peter approached Oliver and whispered in a small voice.\u201cYou\u2019re lucky.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dPeter looked at the back of Rasso and said again quietly.\u201cYou\u2019re lucky, Junior disciples should never talk back to an Intermediate disciple. Since Sir. Rasso was nice, he didn\u2019t mind it. Don\u2019t do that again.\u201d\u201cNice\u2026.\u201dOliver looked at Rasso.No, his feelings, exactly.\u2018Hmm\u2026 nice?\u2019\u201d Why shouldn\u2019t the junior disciples talk back?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the rule. Our family values rules and order. Subordinates must obey their superiors.\u201dOliver nodded.It was the same in the orphanage and the Mine.However, unlike then, there were so many questions that Oliver wanted to ask now.\u201cWhat are you whispering about?\u201d asked Rasso, who was walking in front of them.Peter answered hastily,\u201cNothing Sir,\u201dRasso smiled as if he was fine.\u201cHaha, don\u2019t be so nervous. Just think that we\u2019re going for a walk.\u201d\u201cYes Sir.\u201d\u201cMoreover, Oliver. I told you earlier that I would tell you what the product is.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain right away, so first, Let\u2019s begin our job.\u201dSaying that Rasso took a notebook out of his pocket and examined it.\u201cShall we start here? Let\u2019s see\u2026 112A on Paul Street.\u201dRasso murmured, examining the cluttered inn, and went into a small, dirty place, and as soon as he entered, a strange stench reached everyone\u2019s nose.\u201cWho is it?\u201dAn old woman who is believed to be the owner came out and asked.The age spots around her eyes were quite repulsive.Rasso replied to her naturally.\u201cIs the fruit ripe?\u201dThe old woman\u2019s eyes flinched and she replied.\u201cI\u2019ve cooked three.\u201d\u201cCan you show me around? I\u2019d like to have a taste of it.\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201dThe party of three followed the old woman up to the second floor in a narrow hallway.There were three small rooms and the sounds of children could be heard from each room.The old woman knocked on the door.\u201cIt\u2019s me, Are you there?\u201dAfter a while, with a squeak, the door slowly opened.Someone peeped out through the crack in the door.\u201cLandlord Madam. What brings you\u2026?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, nothing, The one I told you about before. That one. They\u2019re here. Open the door,\u201dOliver saw a faint emotion through the small gap.The emotion was trembling with fear.However, as soon as she was ready, the door opened, and a woman who was just before the transition from girl to woman appeared.There was a baby in her arms, and it seemed like she was breastfeeding until a while ago.\u201cThese people\u2026,\u201d she asked, frightenedly.The old woman reassured her.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. As I told you earlier, it\u2019s not dangerous for the baby. Think of it as just blood donation.\u201dThe woman looked afraid but soon closed her eyes tightly as if she had no choice.\u201c\u2026..Please\u201d\u201cHehe. How is it? Is it okay?\u201dWhen asked by the old woman, Rasso raised two fingers so that only the old woman could see them.The old woman nodded in acknowledgment, and Rasso ordered Oliver.\u201cCan I have a test tube?\u201dOliver opened the briefcase and held out an empty test tube.After receiving the test tube, Rasso reached out to calm the woman.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt, there are no side effects, so don\u2019t worry,\u201dRasso said, extracting her emotions.The emotions was none other than love for the baby\u2014motherhood.The light was very beautiful and warm.Oliver admired for a moment, and when the test tube was about a \u2153 rd full, Rasso stopped extracting.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dThe woman sat down, exhaling an unfamiliar sensation and a somewhat absent-minded feelingHowever, when she saw the bundle of money offered by Rasso, she soon came to her senses.\u201cIs this\u2026?\u201d\u201cWe told you, we\u2019ll pay you a lot, didn\u2019t we?\u201dThe woman, distracted by the bundle of money, nodded.Rasso after greeting politely handed over the extracted motherhood to Oliver.\u201cThen, I look forward to your kind cooperation next time.\u201dThe woman clasped the bundle of money and nodded her head.As the party came out of the room, they went to the other two rooms to extract motherhood from the single mothers in the same way.When they came back down from work, Rasso gave the old woman more money than what he had given to three single mothers.\u201cThank you, huh? The money is less than before?\u201dRasso replied to the old woman\u2019s question.\u201cDidn\u2019t you know? As much as we pay the right price, we\u2019re picky about quality. The lady in the last room isn\u2019t very good anymore.\u201d\u2018That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Okay, she\u2019ll be out of the room sooner or later, looking for another mother, right?\u201d\u201cYes, if you get the right stuff, I\u2019ll give you extra.\u201dThe old woman nodded her head and said,\u201cOkay.\u201dRasso came out after greeting her, and after coming out, he said to Oliver.\u201cDid you take care of the emotions?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the ingredient to make a product. Do you know what it is?\u201dOliver shook his head.Rasso said with a smile.\u201cIt\u2019s called Pilgaret.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Pilgaret.It was said to be the main product of the Joseph family, no, for the majority of the warlock family.\u201cWhat\u2019s a Pilgaret?\u201d\u201cDo you happen to know about cigarettes? It\u2019s similar to that. But it\u2019s only similar in appearance, the contents are very much different. I don\u2019t know how to explain it because there\u2019s so much to talk about.\u201dRasso pretended to be worried as he talked like a salesman.Then he opened his mouth again.\u201cPilgaret is a kind of health drug. The quality varies depending on the maker, but it\u2019s a great thing. Pleasure is greater than most drugs, and there are few side effects. No, it\u2019s a special medicine for depressed patients these days, so it\u2019s rather good for their health?\u201dOliver didn\u2019t understand, so Rasso explained again, pointing to the briefcase.\u201cHow\u2019s the emotion in there? The motherhood of beautiful mothers who are alone but didn\u2019t abandon their children.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 beautiful.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it? Once it\u2019s processed and inhaled, it\u2019s even better than a potion-boiled stimulant. On top of that, there is little fear of being caught and no side effects.\u201dIt was hard to understand because it was something completely unknown to Oliver, still, his curiosity arose, thinking that emotions can not only be used for black magic, but also for something like this.Oliver became curious about the production process and the actual effect.\u201cIs this the only ingredient we will be extracting?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. There are many different kinds of Pilgaret. And it\u2019s not only the Pilgaret that\u2019s our source of income. I\u2019ll tell you more about it as we move.\u201dAs soon as Rasso finished, he started moving again, and Oliver followed him.This time, they went to the basement in a back alley.The basement was filled with a pungent smell, and at a distance, they saw a locked iron door and a bald guard guarding it.While looking at a book with a naked woman on it, the guard grunted at the appearance of strangers.\u201cWho is it? Get out of here.\u201dThe bald man picked up blackjack at his waist as if it were not just a warning.Blackjack with a metal ball on one end.As long as the person wasn\u2019t a fool, he could easily guess that even if he was hit once by it, his head would explode.Rasso said.\u201cHave you collected enough dried leaves?\u201dThe bald man lifted his face and put in the blackjack.Then he pressed the buzzer on the wall.Inside the basement, a little beep was heard!As soon as the sound was heard, the locked iron door opened.The security guard beckoned inside, and Rasso bowed politely and went down.Further down Oliver saw a cellar.There was nothing to pay particular attention to, except for the musty sweet smell.\u201cYou are here?\u201dA man in his 50s with half gray, half black hair and gold-rimmed glasses greeted them.\u201cHow are you? Pharmacist.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Welcome. I thought it was time for you to come.\u201dAs if they knew each other well, Rasso talked to the man called pharmacist, and then he guided Rasso somewhere.Of course, Oliver and Peter followed whispering and chatting along the way.\u201cWho is he?\u201d\u201cWho? Pharmacist? I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s our family\u2019s big dealer. I\u2019ve heard that he\u2019s also dealing with other families.\u201d\u201cAre there other families?\u201d\u201cOf course there is. How can it be just us?\u201dKACHAK\u201cHere you go,\u201d said the pharmacist, opening the door at the end of the hallway.When he opened the door, Oliver saw a room that was like a warehouse.There was only one white light bulb lit up in the room, and beneath it were the shabby people sitting on their knees.\u201cAll the dried leaves I\u2019ve got. The books are here, so check them yourself.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAfter finishing his conversation with the pharmacist, Rasso looked at people and books alternately as if he was looking at things.It seemed quite familiar, and in the meantime, Oliver asked Peter what the dry leaves were.Peter answered kindly.\u201cDebtors with no money to pay off their debts. All they have is their body. So we\u2019ll pick the one who\u2019s in good condition, and we\u2019ll pay off the debt and extract a little bit of Life-force instead.\u201dAs Oliver was about to ask what Life-force was, Rasso opened his mouth.\u201cThis person, this person, and\u2026 everything except this person is on us.\u201d\u201cWhat, what?\u201d asked the person not picked by Rasso in bewilderment.But instead of answering, only a rough touch returned.He was dragged away somewhere, looking very frightened.Of course, it wasn\u2019t like the chosen ones were relieved.They also looked around as if they were afraid, but nevertheless, they were overwhelmed by the atmosphere and did nothing.Rasso smiled at them and said,\u201cHello, everyone. Nice to meet you all. I can\u2019t tell you who I am because of personal reasons, but I\u2019d like to make a good offer to you. Before I get to the point, everyone owes a lot of debt here, right?\u201dSome people nodded looking around.\u201cWe\u2019ll pay back all those debts for you, right now. Instead, give us a little bit of Life-force.\u201dLife-force.The heavy word surprised the debtors.Then, the pharmacist stepped in.It looked skillful and familiar.\u201cDon\u2019t be so afraid. You\u2019ll just be losing some energy. If you eat well and rest well, you will be able to recover.\u201dStill, the debtors looked at each other as if they were not relieved.Then a timid-looking fat man quietly raised his hand and asked.\u201cLife-force\u2026 Is it dangerous?\u201d-\u201cIt\u2019s okay as long as it\u2019s not taken too much. Rather, it is more dangerous if you don\u2019t pay off your debts while your interests continue to accumulate. This is my choice\u2026 if you don\u2019t like it, you can pay back your debt right away and leave.\u201dThe debtors couldn\u2019t say anything at the pharmacist\u2019s words.They were sold here because they couldn\u2019t pay their debts.As the atmosphere became gloomy, Rasso stepped in once again.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel uncomfortable for a while, but you won\u2019t die. We don\u2019t want to kill people. If you don\u2019t like it, tell me. I won\u2019t force you. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a lot more profitable in the long run if you pay off your debts now.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t much, but it was enough for those who owed a lot of money.Eventually, reluctantly, everyone agreed, and Rasso reached out and began extracting Life-force one by one.Oliver took a closer look at the figure.Unlike emotions, Life-force was not around the body, but on the inside of the body, and it was similar to emotions but strangely different.\u201cOkay. It\u2019s over.\u201d\u201cHiii! Hick\u2026 Hick\u2026\u201dThe man whose Life-force was sucked out breathed as if he was exhausted.Rasso said, closing the test tube in which the extracted Life-force was filled.\u201cTake a good rest for a while, eat and get enough sleep. Yes, you\u2019ll recover soon.\u201dThe person involved was too tired to listen, while Rasso approached the second person without caring.The frightened debtor said urgently.\u201cNow, wait a minute.\u201d\u201cYes, it will be over in a minute.\u201dRasso interrupted and started extracting the Life-force.The people whose Life-force was sucked out lose weight in real-time, and the bizarre sight made the debtors tremble.It was scary, but there was no hope since they had no way for paying off the debt.Rasso, who also completed the second extraction, said as he passed over the test tube.\u201cIt\u2019s your first time seeing Life-force?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThis is the mystery of dark magic. When one ends, another one comes out.\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s true.\u201dPeter answered flatly.Oliver just stared curiously, and Rasso suddenly made a suggestion, as if on a whim.\u201cDo you guys want to try?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dPeter was surprised.\u201cHaha. Sir. Rasso is good at joking, too. Don\u2019t you know we haven\u2019t learned it yet?\u201dAt that moment, Oliver asked, with a sparkle in his eyes.\u201cCan I really try?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dSomeone\u2019s surprised voice was heard.The one who was surprised was not only Peter but also Rasso.\u201c\u2026why?? Can you do it? Did you learn?\u201d\u201cNo, but I can do it from what I just saw.\u201dUnlike Oliver\u2019s usual absent-minded attitude, his voice felt confident, no, more than that \u2013 it was so determined.Rasso asked earnestly.\u201cCan you really do it? It\u2019s not a game, you can\u2019t just say, \u2018I made a mistake,\u2019 later.\u201d\u201cThen I can do it if I did it without making a mistake?\u201d\u201cYes, but\u2026 All right, you\u2019re so confident. Try it. Instead, never make a mistake. Pharmacist. May I ask this child?\u201dThe pharmacist only shrugged.\u201cAs long as you compensate for the damage.\u201dRasso showed the books and the test tubes as if he really intended to make Oliver do it, and told him how much Life-force he had to draw depending on the debt.Oliver just nodded as if he really understood.\u201cOkay, then try it.\u201dDebtor, who instinctively noticed the dangerous situation, looked at Oliver with a scared look.But, Oliver didn\u2019t care a bit and extended his hands in the air.\u201cWait, not that many\u2026\u201dBefore Rasso could finish his words, the Life-force of all the remaining debtors was extracted at the same time.The extracted Life-force which spread in the air was brought together.SHUSSSSSHAs the number of people was large, the Life-force was large, huge, and shiny, and it was not easy to control, not only for the intermediate disciples but also for the senior disciples.For some reason, Oliver did not have a hard time at all, after extracting the Life-force, he stabilized it in his hands, and said,\u201cIs this okay?\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s usual expression, Rasso nodded with a silly face.Not only successfully extracting the Life-force that he hasn\u2019t learned, but Oliver was also good at handling it all at once.Rasso had no idea of what to say.\u201cSir. I\u2019m sorry, but can you open the lid of the test tube?\u201dPeter, who was mesmerized, got surprised and opened the lid of the test tube hearing the voice of Oliver.Oliver filled the Life-force exactly to the point, while Rasso looked at the debtors who were losing their life.The amount of Life-force extracted was exactly as mentioned in the books.Even though he picked ignorantly all at once, there was no problem with precision.No, this precision was difficult even if Rasso did it one by one.\u2018Talent\u2026 Can this really be categorized as Talent?\u2019Rasso felt as if he was watching a monster at work.Oliver transferred the Life-force to the test tube without any hesitation.In the eyes of Rasso, the figure of Oliver felt like a monster that would break down the existing family order at once.\u201cSir. Rasso?\u201d\u201d Yes\u2026Yes. What? Do you have something to say?\u201d\u201cYes, what is this Life-force used for?\u201dTo the question of the monster, which was filled with nothing but curiosity, Rasso replied with a smile.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you on the way.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13\u201cNutritional supplements?\u201d asked Oliver, who was walking with a briefcase.Rasso nodded.\u201cYes, all of this Life-force will be processed into nutritional supplements. It\u2019s not always possible to make it as a nutritional supplement, but these days, it\u2019s efficient to make it.\u201dOliver, an outsider, didn\u2019t understand much about the business.Rasso kindly explained in more detail.\u201cDo you know who the main customers are?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the rich in Landa. You know where Landa is, right?\u201dOliver fumbled.He had heard of it once.When he arrived here in Wineham with Joseph, he talked about Landa once.Wineham\u2019s factories are all moving to Landa.\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d\u201cReally? So you know that now Landa is developing rapidly, eating up here and the surrounding cities?\u201dOliver nodded again.\u201cIn a rapidly developing city, there are a lot of rich people. Of course, there are more poor people, but anyway, most of Landa\u2019s rich are older fat people, and they\u2019re not very healthy even though they\u2019re rich. So they pay a lot of money to buy nutritional supplements made with Life-force. After all, life is more important than money.\u201dOliver nodded as if he understood roughly.\u201cSo this Life-force is one of our family\u2019s major products, like Pilgaret. As demand continues to grow, this market has a bright outlook.\u201dRasso said like a confident businessman.Meanwhile, Peter carefully intervened and flattered.\u201cHaha, that\u2019s great. The bright market outlook means that demand will increase. The family is going to be more prosperous.\u201dPeter was just trying to make him look good, but Rasso took it more seriously than he thought,\u201cYes, but just an increase in demand is not good. We need to increase the supply to meet demand.\u201d\u201cSupply?\u201d\u201cYeah, a bottle of nutritional supplements costs a fortune, but that\u2019s also when the product is perfect. If the quality is lowered to increase the quantity, the deal will get cut off immediately. So we have to be careful.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\u201cActually, it\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe point is whether we can get the ingredients right, but it\u2019s pretty hopeful given the situation in this city.\u201dIt was ironic.The only city streets they\u2019ve seen on their way were closed shops, factories, and houses that exude poverty, but Rasso said it was hopeful.Rasso continued,\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. The word hopeful doesn\u2019t belong to this poor city. But that shows how immature you are. Poverty is surprisingly good for black magicians. Tell me. What would happen if all the factories in this city moved to Landa?\u201dPeter answered seriously like a disciple in a class.\u201cUh\u2026 there\u2019ll be many poor, won\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cYeah. So, will everyone leave for Landa looking for a job? That\u2019s not the case. Many will leave, but nonetheless, there will be many left here. It\u2019s not that easy to leave for another place. Then we can use reliable brokers to pay them some money and extract Life-force. Soon the whole city will be our ingredient.\u201dHearing that Peter\u2019s eyes shone.\u201cThat\u2019s a great insight. As expected, an intermediate disciple is different from the lower class disciples like us.\u201d\u201cActually, I only heard it from Andrew. I got beaten by the atmosphere and wanted to brag. Now, I\u2019m a little embarrassed.\u201d\u201cNo, Senior is still amazing.\u201d\u201cAnyway, don\u2019t tell this to anyone, I specially told you guys, keep it to yourself. It\u2019s not a secret, but there\u2019s nothing good if a lot of people knew about it.\u201dPeter smiled slightly at the word'special.\u201dFor Peter, who served as a Room Leader for most of his life, the words of Rasso, an outstanding disciple among intermediate disciples, were like a great praise.In reality, even if it meant nothing.\u201cWe\u2019re almost there. That\u2019s a relief. We arrived before dinner. By the way, what\u2019s going on over there?\u201d said Rasso, looking at the busy crowd in front of the factory far away.It was chaotic, and everyone seemed scared and confused.\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on?\u201dRasso approached and grabbed a busy and moving informal disciple and asked.When he looked at him, there was some blood on the informal disciple\u2019s work clothes.\u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s\u2026. I don\u2019t know what it is, but someone attacked the official disciples.\u201dThe conference room in the basement of the sausage factory.Joseph, the family boss, and five of his senior disciples gathered there.Everyone had a serious expression, and it was Joseph who opened his mouth first.\u201cReport,\u201dAndrew, the best among the senior disciples replied.\u201cYes, Master. An unidentified mysterious group attacked our family today during the ingredient collection. Three out of ten teams were attacked. In total, one junior disciple was injured and two junior disciples died, fortunately, all the intermediate disciples are fine.\u201dAndrew\u2019s voice was relatively bright.In fact, in a way, it was natural.The junior disciples were of little use because they could barely use black magic, whereas the intermediate disciples were practical forces that could be used in actual combat.Moreover, even if the junior disciples died, they could be roughly selected from the informal disciples and would be able to fill the vacancy immediately.Joseph thought it over and opened his mouth.\u201cHow did they get attacked?\u201d\u201cIt was done the same way. As they walked through the street, suddenly someone appeared, shot at them, and ran away.\u201d\u201cThey couldn\u2019t even catch a single one?\u201d\u201cYes, they were already gone when they followed them. I think they know the geography of this place very well, and maybe one of the families is picking a fight with us?\u201dThe other family that Andrew told was two other Warlock families here in Wineham.The Anthony Family specialized in manipulation, and the Dominic Family specialized in disease.In the past, Joseph had a dispute with the two families, but after reconciling with the pharmacist\u2019s involvement, they were now quietly operating in their respective areas.\u201cIsn\u2019t it an attack because our family continues to grow?\u201dJoseph shook his head.\u201cNo, this kind of half-assed raid isn\u2019t their way. It\u2019s annoying, but it didn\u2019t do much damage, did it? If it\u2019s them they would have made a more proper attack.\u201d\u201cSo who?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know that yet. I heard that there are all kinds of bugs running around because of the noise of Landa\u2026The concern is whether to catch this bug or not.\u201dIf there was enough time, Joseph would have ordered them to catch these fearless guys, considering the status of his family, but now, things weren\u2019t good.The product delivery date was nearing.Considering the business, he had to hand it over in time, so he had to use the available force to focus on production.\u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s focus on production. We can catch a bug later since it has nothing to do with our business.\u201dA senior disciple raised his hand.\u201cI don\u2019t think the attack will end with this one time, can we really focus on production? Moreover, we have not yet received enough ingredients, and if something were to happen to an intermediate disciple, we will be short-handed.\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u201dAndrew raised his hand when Joseph was immersed in his thoughts.Andrew\u2019s eyes flashed as if he had an idea.\u201cThen, why don\u2019t we leave the collection of the ingredients to the lower class and put the intermediate disciples into production like us?\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes were on Andrew.In the past few years, ingredient collection has been conducted under the leadership of intermediate disciples along with the junior disciples, but Andrew\u2019s proposal was to break that tradition.\u201cHow come?\u201d\u201cIf we put intermediate disciples in the production of products, we\u2019ll be able to meet the deadline faster, and we can prepare for the unexpected.\u201dWhen Joseph remained silent, Andrew continued to persuade him.\u201cI\u2019ve heard from some intermediate disciples that junior disciples can extract some ingredients. At this time, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea to increase their role. Above all\u2026..there won\u2019t be a great deal of damage even if some of the lower disciples die, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHis words were way over the line, but no one denied it, because junior disciples were only slightly better than the informal disciples and their position could be filled at any time.Then, a senior disciple raised his hand.\u201cI honestly think it\u2019s okay. However, there\u2019s one big issue.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s emotion, I can understand that the low-level disciples can extract it, but what about the Life-force?\u201dAndrew smiled brightly at that moment as if he was waiting for someone to ask this question.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I heard an interesting story from Rasso.\u201dAfter dinner, everyone had a personal maintenance time.Usually, most of them rested at this time while some chatted with the people they are close with, but the atmosphere right now was somewhat dark, perhaps because of what happened today.It wasn\u2019t so strange, because someone was after the family.Since they might be the ones who could get killed tomorrow if they were unlucky, it was a grave concern for everyone, except for one.Oliver, who was speaking to Marie\u201cAh, that\u2019s why he got hurt a lot.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen a person getting shot a few times in my hometown, but it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d\u201cOh, really? But it\u2019s getting out of shape,\u201dOliver said, looking at Marie\u2019s web.Marie came back to her senses with a blunder.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s better than the first time.\u201dThe strangely divergent conversation meant that the two had different interests.Marie focused on today\u2019s attack, but Oliver focused consistently on black magic \u2013 Like a fire moth that only responds to light.\u201cYou really don\u2019t care about anything.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026nothing. How about this?\u201dMarie said, showing the finished web.It\u2019s noticeably better than before, and she didn\u2019t just imitate the form, it looked like a real spider web.It could be said to be a great development.\u201c\u2026.. it\u2019s good,\u201dMarie smiled hearing Oliver\u2019s reply.She felt like her efforts were appreciated.Marie knew that it was not just her own effort that made it possible, it couldn\u2019t have been possible without Oliver\u2019s help than her own effort.Oliver continued to help her, corrected her, and improved the wrong parts so that she could achieve the current level.Indeed, it was amazing.The results she achieved over the past few days were way more than what she achieved with her efforts alone in the past six years.It was really great.\u201cBut this part is better,\u201dOliver said, pointing at Marie\u2019s web.The central axis of the spider web was divided into five branches, turning into a more complex and robust form.\u201cThis is better. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cOh, yes\u2026 Thank you.\u201d\u201cNo, thank you. If you don\u2019t mind, can I borrow it for a while?\u201dOliver took Marie\u2019s emotions back in his hands.The barely made model of Marie\u2019s web quickly regained stability when it got transferred to Oliver\u2019s hand.In the past, Marie was jealous of Oliver\u2019s talent, but as she kept looking at him, she didn\u2019t feel that way anymore.Jealousy is possible only when there\u2019s a certain level of difference.Marie said again as she looked at Oliver making the spider web.\u201cThank you very much.\u201d\u201cNo, thank you. I get help with this and that.\u201d\u201cYou already learned letters and numbers, right?\u201dOliver has long learned everything Marie can teach, such as writing, reading, and number calculation at an amazing learning speed.Nevertheless, he continued to teach Marie.\u201cAh\u2026 not about that, but this one.\u201dOliver said, pointing at Marie\u2019s emotion in his hands.\u201cI can practice little because Supervisor Marie lets me extract her emotions,\u201dOliver replied, removing the spider web model and making a sphere.\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a small amount.\u201d\u201cNo, I can\u2019t even extract that small amount from me.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI can make a shape at my fingertips, but I can\u2019t extract my emotions. Before coming here, the Master said that my emotions are weaker than others. I think I can\u2019t extract it because of that.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dIt was the first time Marie heard about it.\u201cSo I had to extract other people\u2019s emotions, and Supervisor Marie helped me with that. It would have been depressing if it weren\u2019t for Supervisor Marie.\u201d\u201c\u2026 speak comfortably without honorifics. Now, you are in a position higher than mine.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m comfortable with honorifics,\u201dOliver said sincerely.From his experience in life, he felt that anyone who spoke formally could avoid getting beaten.But regardless, Marie seemed to be somewhat disappointed.\u201cWell, then, feel free to tell me whenever you want to extract emotion.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dA short, emotionless answer.Soon Oliver became silent and focused all his attention on the emotions in his hand.Marie also followed Oliver and looked at the emotions, and there was nothing special, except for the slight flinch of the sphere.Eventually, Marie said, unable to bear the silence.\u201cHow was it today? You went to collect ingredients, right?\u201dOliver replied calmly about how he followed Rasso, how Rasso extracted the maternal love of unmarried mothers, and about the pharmacist, where he extracted the Life-force of the debtors.\u201c\u2026. Wait a minute. Did you extract Life-force? Oliver?\u201dOliver nodded.\u201cHow? You wouldn\u2019t be able to learn to extract Life-force until you\u2019re an intermediate disciple?\u201dOliver couldn\u2019t reply since he felt like she was asking as if how is he breathing.It seemed so obvious that he couldn\u2019t explain it, but Marie was amazed and worried at the same time.\u201cHey, Oliver?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBe careful.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI know Oliver is a genius, but it\u2019s dangerous if you reveal all your talent too early.\u201dOliver turned his head and made eye contact with Marie.\u201cDangerous?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dMarie stopped talking and looked around.\u201c\u2026 No one knows if the junior disciple, who was originally in Oliver\u2019s place, really died of food poisoning,\u201dMarie said with a frown when Oliver didn\u2019t understand.\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201dBeep! Beep! Beep!Suddenly, a broadcast signal rang out throughout the factory.[Ugh! ugh! Oliver! Oliver! Come to the Master\u2019s office right away. I\u2019ll repeat again, Oliver\u2026\u2026\u2026]Oliver got up from his seat, looked at Marie, and said,\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh, yeah, have a safe trip.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14A few days later, the collection of ingredients resumed.However, there was one thing that was different, it was the junior disciples instead of the intermediate disciples who were assigned for the job.The reason for that was the improvement in the efficiency of production, responsibility improvement, and training for junior disciples by expanding their duties.But the junior disciples knew that it was nothing but an empty excuse.They know that the burden of collecting ingredients was handed over to the junior disciples in order to save the lives of the relatively valuable intermediate disciples.They felt like if they were going to replace the duties, they should have at least told the truth.However, there was nothing the junior disciples could do just because they knew what was going on inside.In the world of Warlock, if the superiors gave an order, it should be followed, not questioned.They had to just bow down their heads to express their gratitude for the increase in missions, and for the chance to practice how to extract emotions.But there was one exception, Oliver, who was glad that he could practice more black magic.SHOOOWWUU\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201dOliver said while closing the test tube that contained the Life-force.He handed over the test tube to Peter, who put the tubes into his bag, took a few round bundles of money from a sling bag, and gave them to a man with gold teeth and sunglasses.The man who called himself a loan shark laughed with an eerie smile, then took out a couple of bundles of money as a commission, and then handed three or four bills to the person whose Life-force was drained.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cHuh. Goodbye, I hope to see you again next time.\u201dPeter felt uncomfortable at the attitude of the loan shark, so he took Oliver and hurriedly paced his steps.After they left the shabby building and walked for some time, Peter sighed and looked through the list.\u201cHa\u2026\u2026. Oh no.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cAfter eating in the morning, we\u2019ve started doing the work, and we\u2019ve been running around the clock all day, but still, I don\u2019t see a way to reduce the workload.\u201dOliver and Peter had a workload that was several times more than that of other junior disciples.The reason for this was, except for Oliver, there were no junior disciples who were able to extract Life-force.Oliver was okay because the work itself was fun, but it was never okay for his sidekick, Peter.Not long ago, he saw two junior disciples drenched in blood after getting attacked by the raiders.He felt very uneasy.The range of movement was wide, so there was a high possibility of being attacked.Above all\u2026 his stomach was growling.Peter checked the time when he felt his stomach growling.It was 1:20 p.m.He missed lunchtime because he was working.Peter took Oliver out of the back alley and into the main street.The once crowded streets were noticeably less crowded, more than half of the buildings were empty, and the house with boards on the windows filled the street.Still, there was one thing that didn\u2019t change, the hot dog booth in the square was still there.\u201cWait a minute,\u201dPeter told Oliver and went to the hot dog booth.After a while, he came back with a hot dog with mustard and pickles on it.\u201cHave one of these,\u201dOliver ate as Peter said, while Peter filled his stomach with hot dogs.While eating, there was no conversation between the two, but Peter looked at Oliver, who was silent, and thought that geniuses were supposed to be like this.He came in as an informal disciple and became a formal disciple in less than 10 days, easily surpassing him who had been here for several years.However, what bothered him the most was that he didn\u2019t know what was going on inside Oliver\u2019s head.Appearing gloomy and sometimes even stupid, he usually seemed like any other informal disciple, but he was odd at times, which makes even a junior disciple like him shiver.His ability can surpass intermediate disciples, and even Andrew\u2019s man Rasso was nervous around him.Suddenly he remembered the astonished Rasso\u2019s face when Oliver pulled out the Life-force.It was impressive because he always kept his poker face.Peter felt that maybe it was a conspiracy that Oliver took this job, expecting him to meet the attackers and misfortunately die.It was nothing big of a shock.It was the law of the Warlock world \u2013 to cut off the buds that might threaten their place.That\u2019s also the reason why Peter\u2019s been the Room Leader for a long time.But despite his efforts, now getting involved with Oliver might put his life in danger.If Oliver was really pushed into this job with the intention of getting him killed, then Peter might die as a bonus\u2026 yes, as a bonus.He felt frustrated because until a few days back, his life was smooth but now it felt like a ship that is getting swept away by the waves.\u201cWhat is that?\u201dWhile Peter was in deep thought Oliver asked suddenly, pointing in one direction with a childlike innocent, stupid face, where workers were protesting in shabby clothes, dragging out their worn-out shoes.\u201cMoving factories is death!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s death!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s death!\u201d\u201cGive us our job!\u201d\u201cOur job!\u201d\u201cOur job!\u201d\u201cOur job!\u201dThe protest by the 40-50-year-old workers seemed somewhat sad and difficult, but Peter frowned and shook his head.\u201cDo you remember what Senior Rasso said a few days ago?\u201d\u201cWhich one?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026The city factories are moving to Landa.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThey are protesting not to do that since they will lose their job.\u201dOliver nodded indifferently as if he really understood.The appearance made Peter uncomfortable because he didn\u2019t know what Oliver was thinking.\u201c\u2026 Then, can\u2019t they just go to Landa? Looking for a job?\u201dPeter opened his mouth after an unusual silence.\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy.\u201d\u201cIs it?\u201d\u201cYes, it is. First of all, it\u2019s not easy to leave your home for some people, and even if they did leave, going to Landa doesn\u2019t really make things better.\u201d\u201c\u2026Can you explain it in detail?\u201dPeter thought for a moment, about whether to tell him or not, but it was not easy to refuse while looking at the curious expression on Oliver\u2019s face.Eventually, he opened his mouth thinking he was crazy.\u201cLanda used to be a growing city, but now it\u2019s growing faster. It\u2019s like a monster, so the map changes every day. A monster that eats the surrounding cities, towns, and fishing villages. Do you think people who get eaten by such monsters will be happy?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, 12 hours a day is a given, and sometimes they are made to work 18 hours a day. The kids are no different, but the money they give isn\u2019t good enough to fill even a rat\u2019s stomach, while most of the money is stolen in the name of rent. They will be squeezed from everywhere.\u201d\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve lived there,\u201d said Peter, even though he didn\u2019t want to say it.\u201cI originally lived in a small fishing village above Landa, and eventually got kicked out when a fishing factory came in. Our whole family went to Landa to find a job, and that\u2019s when hell began.\u201dPeter\u2019s eyes suddenly darkened when he recalled that time \u2013 the poverty and the suffering.\u201cThen did you follow the master and come here?\u201dPeter\u2019s eyebrows wriggled.It wasn\u2019t because he felt bad about Oliver interrupting him, it was because he was amazed by the boy who did not feel any empathy even after listening to his story.\u201cHuh\u2026? Yes. Master was looking for a talented child\u2026 He offered us money that we couldn\u2019t refuse, and eventually I got handed over to the master, but don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m here. Life is much better, and there is hope. If I learn black magic here, I will be able to run my own business someday.\u201dWhat Peter said at the end was a lie.He once dreamed of becoming independent as a black wizard, but now it\u2019s all in the past.The reason is none other than internal competition.Competition in the Warlock family was more intense and shady than he imagined, especially because of the faction that centered around Andrew, the family\u2019s second-in-command, and it was virtually impossible to get promoted.Realizing this, Peter effectively gave up his dream.Now he just wanted to spend his days in peace \u2013 like not getting food poisoned.Peter suddenly became disgusted, maybe because of the dislike of this situation, or perhaps at him getting swayed around doing nothing.\u201cLet\u2019s get back to work now,\u201dPeter said, returning to work to dispel the depression.Peter entered a multi-family house with Oliver and solved the rent issue of those who were behind in rent, by taking away their Life-force.Next, he went to the underground office of a small private loan shark to solve the debts of the debtors by extracting the Life-force.While working around constantly like that, Oliver talked to Peter once again.\u201cSir, can I ask you about something I\u2019m curious about?\u201dOnce again Peter didn\u2019t want to answer, but he was still afraid of Oliver, so Peter asked Oliver what he was curious about.But to Peter\u2019s surprise, a more shocking question came up than what he thought.\u201cAm I in danger?\u201dPeter\u2019s foot stopped in the dark back alley.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cSomeone told me that I\u2019ll be in danger if I show too much talent. Is that right?\u201dPeter couldn\u2019t open his mouth.The reason was that he didn\u2019t know what to answer.Peter thought to himself whether he should answer the question, or Should he say, he doesn\u2019t know, Or Should he lie saying he\u2019s safe.When he thoughts of the usual Oliver, with his stupid appearance, he thought it would be okay if he lied, but he couldn\u2019t answer easily when he thought of a sharp Oliver who sometimes shows his face.\u2018What if he responds badly, and then takes out his anger on me?\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t think I can win.\u2019As he was thinking Oliver suddenly approached as if he had lost all his patience.Peter raised his hand in bewilderment to calm him down, but Oliver did not care and grabbed Peter by the shoulder.Although there was not much strength in the grabbed hands, Peter could not resist because he had already lost his balance, and Peter, who was dragged backward like that, was stuck between a huge trash can and a protruding cement wall.\u201cWait, hold on\u2026\u201dOliver opened the lid of the test tube without listening to Peter.The word death flashed in Peter\u2019s head.He couldn\u2019t believe that he was going to die without being able to do anything.At that time, Oliver extracted his emotions and chanted.[Double Black shield]Two Black shields spread out on the front and back.And soon Gunshots rang out.BANG\u2014! BANG\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!The sound from the gun felt familiar.It was the sound of a shotgun, a sound that was often heard in the slums.It\u2019s also a modified shotgun, which is mainly used in gang protests.\u201cIs this an attack?\u201d\u201c\u2026uh!\u201dPeter exclaimed embarrassingly.As soon as he answered, Oliver condensed the black shield in the back and shot at the attacker.[Hate Bullet]A crashing sound was heard.Peter poked out his face and saw the masked attacker.Although he could not see his face, he could see that he was confused.Peter shouted involuntarily.\u201cWe have to catch him. Alive!\u201dThe attacker began to flee hearing the words.As he was about to go into the alley, Oliver blocked his way and shot Hate Bullet.BANG!QUACK!\u201cOh, f*ck!\u201dA bewildered swearing could be heard from behind the mask.\u201cShould I catch him alive?\u201d\u201cYeah! Alive!\u201d\u201cAlive\u2026\u201dOliver mumbled as he extracted the emotions from the test tube and began to fiddle.However, the attacker did not stay still, he, who had no place to escape, pulled a scroll out of his arms.Peter knew instinctively what that action meant.The attacker is going to use the teleport scroll to get away\u201cDamn it\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s late. Goodby\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dJust as the attacker was about to use the scroll something came rushing toward him and disabled him from moving.It was a Black magic from Oliver, a Black magic that Peter had never seen in his life.From its appearance, it looked like a spider web.It is a spider web that flies like a net and holds people tightly.\u201cOh, this works?\u201dOliver said as if it was nothing.Peter looked up at Oliver with surprise and asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s that\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s called Cling Web.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15\u201cUh\u2026 Cling Web?\u201dFinishing his words, Oliver approached the web-bound attacker.The attacker tied to the black spider web was hardened like a rock in the posture of spreading the scroll as if time seemed to have stopped and he couldn\u2019t even speak.His entire body was in a frozen state except for one \u2013 his eyes\u201c\u2026 uh\u2026.\u201dThe attacker looked at Oliver with eyes that were about to burst into tears.Oliver checked his condition once and turned off his attention as if he was not interested.\u201cNow\u2026 What should we do?\u201dOliver looked back at Peter and asked.Peter still had a blank look on his face, with mixed feelings of fear, awe, and confusion.Then he opened his mouth with difficulty as if he had barely recovered his mind.\u201cWe\u2019ll take him to Master. Well, it might be good if he had fainted\u2026\u201dWhile Peter was looking around, Oliver picked up a piece of brick that was scattered along the road and hit the attacker\u2019s head.The spider web, which bound the attacker, disappeared due to the external shock, but fortunately, the attacker fainted, so there was no problem.Looking down at the fallen attacker, Oliver said.\u201cI knocked him out.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNow\u2026how do we take him to Master?\u201dIt was a ridiculous question, but it wasn\u2019t a strange question either.The attacker is an adult male, well-built, while Oliver is skinny.\u201cHmm, shall we carry him together?\u201dPeter staggered up and said.Peter, who was relatively well-built, lifted the attacker\u2019s upper body, while Oliver lifted his lower body, but soon, the two got exhausted and dropped the attacker to the floor.\u201cIt\u2019s harder than I thought?\u201d\u201c\u2026By the way, can you answer me, now?\u201d\u201cHuh? What?\u201d\u201cThe previous question. Am I in danger?\u201dPeter was silent once again.Even though he was just about to die, he was worried about Andrew and the faction below him.Peter thought about how funny his situation was.About five seconds later, Oliver opened his mouth once again.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer if you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m sorry I asked you a question.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Why did you help me earlier? When we were attacked.\u201dIt was Oliver who was silent this time.Peter asked again while wondering why Oliver helped him.The warlock world is a place where the weak become the meat, while the strong eat the meat. The weaker a Warlock is the quicker he gets abandoned. That was the reason why two junior disciples died during the last raid.Oliver answered\u201c\u2026.Why did you tell me about your life as a junior disciple and why did you answer when I asked this and that. So I helped you because you got something, don\u2019t you?\u201dPeter wondered at the answer that came with a question mark.However, the answer felt sincere.\u201c\u2026\u2026.. You asked if you were in danger, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYes, you are in danger,\u201dPeter answered without thinking.\u201cAs you know, for a Warlock, strength is rank and justice. In other words, if a strong Warlock suddenly appears, no matter who he is, everyone must consider him as a superior. Because of that, the people who are already at the top keep the talented Warlocks in check to the fullest extent, since he will be a threat to his place one day.\u201dOliver listened silently.There was no expression or movement in the eyes.\u201cIn that sense, you\u2019re better than anyone else. So you\u2019re on the lookout. Within ten days of coming in, you killed a junior disciple and took over his position. A person who was Andrew\u2019s man.\u201d\u201cAndrew\u2019s man?\u201d\u201cFaction. I mean, he\u2019s close to Andrew.\u201dOliver tilted his head as if he didn\u2019t understand.Peter went into more detail.\u201cIt\u2019s profitable to be close to each other. Andrew can consolidate his position, and the people at the bottom have someone to back them. It\u2019s been a long since this kind of structure solidified.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026, aren\u2019t there any other talented Warlocks?\u201d\u201cNo, Didn\u2019t you listen to what I said? A brilliant Warlock is not a welcome thing in the warlock community.\u201d\u201cBut Master\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster? What?\u201dOliver tried to answer, but shook his head and said nothing since it felt strange.The reason was obvious, when he first met Joseph, he said his goal was to raise strong warlocks, but there was a strange gap between reality and what he said.Peter said again.\u201cSo be careful\u2026 No one knows if the junior disciple who was in your place really died of food poisoning in the first place. That\u2019s all I can tell you.\u201dPeter stopped speaking as if he had repaid his favor.Along with that, he felt a strange satisfaction of doing something on his own with a sense of weakness that seemed to drain his energy.Oliver replied, looking at Peter.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThank you for answering the question. It helped.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026Okay, that\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cNow shall we go back to work?\u201dPeter and Oliver once again lifted the attacker and started walking.The attacker was still heavy but Peter\u2019s heart felt light as he recalled Oliver thanking him.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while. You wouldn\u2019t have come just to see my face, what\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cI came here to talk.\u201dIn the basement of Joseph Sausage Factory, there were many rooms like an ant cave, and two men talked in the most colorful reception room.One was Joseph, the owner of the place, and the other was Pharmacist, his dealer.No, not a mere dealer, Joseph\u2019s biggest dealer.He digests all of Joseph\u2019s products and supplies raw materials at the same time.So even Joseph, one of the best Warlocks in the town, was careful with him,\u201cWhat, do you want a drink?\u201d\u201cNo, thanks. We\u2019re busy, so I\u2019d like to get straight to the point.\u201d\u201cI like it. What\u2019s the matter?\u201dThe pharmacist bent his upper body slightly forward and opened his mouth carefully.The eyes over the gold-rimmed glasses shone sharply.\u201cHave you been attacked recently? During the collection of ingredients.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 How did you know?\u201dThe pharmacist answered, pulling his upper body.\u201cIt\u2019s more of an assumption. The Anthony family, and the Dominic family, were all attacked. Oh, by the way, I\u2019m also included. The truck that was going to Landa with products was attacked and robbed.\u201dJoseph\u2019s eyebrow went up.The pharmacist was a person who looked like a normal guy on the surface, but in reality, he was a scary person who wouldn\u2019t lose footing with Joseph or other Warlocks in the city.The city\u2019s big man, who pretended to run a drugstore on the outside, while controlling all the transactions with warlocks from behind.It was safe to say that at least there was no one in this city who would go against him.But such a person\u2019s truck was robbed?Then, there was only one conclusion.\u201cDid the bugs crawl in from elsewhere?\u201d\u201cProbably. Landa is rapidly developing and the losers in the survival race are spreading around. Chances are high that the bug is one such kind.\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201dJoseph laughed.\u201cWhat is it? Regular gangs? Or Warlocks?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know that. I\u2019m just here to figure things out and explain the situation so that there won\u2019t be any misunderstanding between families.\u201dJoseph nodded.In the past, Pharmacist was the one who mediated between the warlock families that fought against each other to eat this small city and were on the verge of collapse.And since then, they have been strangely listening to the words of the Pharmacist.\u201cAnyway, thank you for telling me, we\u2019ll search as soon as we can to find out who the culprit is. Can I ask you if we need any help?\u201d\u201cYes, of course\u2026 It\u2019s our enemy anyway. If we find any trace, we\u2019ll contact you.\u201dAs the conversation was coming to an end, they heard a knock on the door.Tock Tock Tock Tock\u201cWhat? I\u2019m talking to a customer right now, if it\u2019s not urgent, talk to me later.\u201dA panicked voice was heard through the door.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry Master. But there\u2019s something I need to inform you about.\u201dJoseph spoke when the pharmacist winked at him as if he was fine.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 Oliver came.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cOliver came with a guy who attacked them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJoseph and the pharmacist looked into each other\u2019s eyes without saying a word.Oliver joined forces with Peter to drag the stunned attacker.They couldn\u2019t carry him for a long time, so each grabbed one leg and dragged him, and thanks to this, the attacker\u2019s back was all split.Oliver and Peter, who were breathing hard and wiping their sweat, were resting for a while near the main gate, and before they knew it, informal disciples, junior disciples, and even intermediate and senior disciples started to gather.\u201cWow,\u2026 does it make sense?\u201d\u201cDid they really catch the attacker?\u201d\u201cThey say so?\u201dBut the moment when Joseph came out with the pharmacist, the disciples who stuck like flies around\u00a0 Oliver and Peter, scattered around.\u201cDid you catch the guy who attacked us?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026yes, Master,\u201dPeter, who was tired from moving, answered.Then, the pharmacist who followed said with admiration.\u201cOh my God, You really caught the attacker. I thought you must have made a mistake, but you really caught one\u2026 What a bunch of great disciples. Who caught him?\u201dPeter looked sideways at Oliver when asked by the pharmacist.The pharmacist, who understood the meaning, laughed loudly once again.\u201cHahahaha\u2026 Is it him again? I think I\u2019ve seen that face. Your recent disciple, right?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d replied Joseph,\u201cYou\u2019ve brought some amazing kid. I knew he was exceptional when he took out Life-force, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be this much. How old is he now? 13 or 14, right? And yet, he\u2019s like this. Everyone from the other family will be jealous if they heard it.\u201d\u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201dContrary to the answer, Joseph\u2019s expression was not very good.But the pharmacist didn\u2019t care about it and kept talking.\u201cThis is the attacker, huh?\u201d\u201cYes, We caught him while he was trying to run away with a scroll.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dEveryone, including Joseph, was surprised at the word scroll.Needless to say, Scrolls are expensive items that wizards make.In particular, Scrolls which can use tricky magic like teleport are very expensive.Proper items cost hundreds of thousands and hundreds of millions depending on safety and distance, even though dozens and hundreds of items were illegally made and sold on the black market.The pharmacist who was listening quietly intervened.\u201cScroll, huh\u2026 Joseph, if you don\u2019t mind, can I take this attacker?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it suspicious to see him run away using an expensive scroll? I want to find the mastermind behind this attack as the person responsible for the peace of this community. Please allow me. I\u2019ll let you know everything in a week, and I\u2019ll give you anything in return.\u201dJoseph nodded after a moment of thought.The pharmacist has never lied before and in addition, the product production had been delayed due to the scuffle with the attacker.When the permission was given, the pharmacist smiled happily and ordered the bodyguard to take the fainted attacker to the car.Then he thanked Joseph once again and left the factory, but before he left, he greeted Oliver lightly.\u201cYou did a great job, little friend.\u201dWith the Pharmacist gone, the factory became quiet, and Joseph opened his mouth and broke the silence.\u201cOliver.\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201d\u201cHow did you catch the attacker? Your seniors couldn\u2019t even catch their tail\u2026 Well, it\u2019s understandable if they\u2019re running away using Scrolls.\u201d\u201cSir. Peter helped me catch him, Master.\u201dJoseph\u2019s eyebrow narrowed.Joseph felt something was terribly wrong, but there was no further questioning since he made a contribution.\u201cOkay, good\u2026 whatever it is it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you made a big contribution.\u201dNo one denied it.\u201cIf a disciple makes a contribution to the family, I have to give the disciple a reward. Thanks to you, I\u2019ve got to relieve some stress. Well, let\u2019s see\u2026 It\u2019s unusual, but do you want me to make you an intermediate disciple?\u201dEveryone was surprised, including the intermediate disciples and the senior disciples.The number of disciples has always been fixed, but suddenly Joseph was trying to break it, just for one person.But no one was against it.In the first place, even the rules were set by Joseph, the owner of the family.If they objected to it, it might be considered a betrayal to the family.Thus everyone thought Oliver would become an intermediate disciple, but Oliver, the party concerned, expressed his refusal.\u201cI\u2019m fine being a junior disciple, Master\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes were on Oliver.\u201cWhy?\u201dOliver said with his peculiar blank look.\u201cUh\u2026 I just want to be able to learn black magic. Thank you for making me a junior disciple. I just want you to teach me more often. And\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cThere is a favor I\u2019d really like to ask Master. I\u2019d like to see how you make the product, so could you let me do some chores in the place where you make products? \u201d\u201c\u2026Are you asking me to put my junior disciples into production?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Of course, I can do it myself.\u201dJoseph burst out laughing at Oliver\u2019s answer.Joseph thought for a while and opened his mouth slowly.\u201cOkay, there\u2019s no harm in increasing the number of workers anyway because the schedule is urgent.\u201d\u201cHuh??!?!?!! \u201d\u201cHuh??!?!?!! \u201c\u201cHuh??!?!?!! \u201cStanding behind Joseph, the intermediate and senior disciples exclaimed in surprise.When Joseph turned around and asked what was wrong, they shut their mouths tightly.Joseph looked down at Oliver again.\u201cAs you ask, I will increase the number of classes for the junior disciples and put them into production. Now, go and get some rest.\u201dJoseph went back, while Oliver bowed his head and said.\u201cThank you\u2026.Master\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Genius 16Joseph\u2019s sausage factory basement.Among the rooms in the basement, the room called the studio was truly unbalanced.It was like a slum where luxury cars were built.Why?The studio itself is shabby, while the work tools, flasks, calves, hoses, dryers, distillators, and other iron tools, were well managed and shiny.Well, it was obvious.Oliver and other junior disciples cleaned it twice a day every morning and evening, whether there was work or not.\u201cOkay, it\u2019s starting to boil!\u201dOne of the intermediate disciples shouted in front of a large distiller.Of course, water was boiling under the distiller, and just above the water was full of herbs in a net.It\u2019s a kind of groundwork to permeate emotionsThe distiller grew hotter and hotter, and a small amount of water began to drip along the long tube.It could be said hot just by looking at it, and Oliver never took his eyes off it, while working, sitting on the floor, and observing production.The voice of an intermediate disciple was heard.\u201cDon\u2019t spill a thing and collect it properly. Master gave us permission to participate in the production. Do it properly.\u201dThe job of junior disciples was to tear up cigarettes bought on the market and put them in one barrel.It was an annoying task, but not a difficult task.Pick up a white cigarette, cut the piece of paper with a knife, and then take out the tobacco leaves inside and put it in one container.Oliver did this without much difficulty, and he could do it without looking at it.Oliver once again observed the work of the intermediate disciples.When the distilled liquid in the tube collected to some extent, they took the barrel and began pouring the distillate through the hose in front of a round flask larger than a man\u2019s head.At the same time, they added the extracted emotions in another lid of the round flask, mixed the distillate with the emotions, and started boiling it.Then, with\u2026..TAPOliver grabbed his head.As Oliver turned his head, the intermediate disciple, who had been overseeing the work of the junior disciple shouted looking at Oliver.\u201cFocus on your work! Stop glancing like a thief!!\u201dIn fact, it was a little unfair.Oliver may have been peeping, but he wasn\u2019t negligent in his work.However, the intermediate disciple stared at Oliver as if he didn\u2019t care and shouted again, and Oliver soon bowed his head and apologized, and immersed himself in the work.This was Oliver\u2019s secret to surviving in the Mine and Orphanage.But the problem happened elsewhere.Several junior disciples, including Peter, looked at the intermediate disciple with discontent.It was as if asking how can a person who doesn\u2019t have skills like Oliver treat him like that just because he was below him in rank.To be honest, it was not wrong, but the intermediate disciple felt tremendous anger at the eyes of the junior disciples looking at him and distorted his face thinking at the fact that the mere junior disciple had the nerve to look at him like that.\u201cWhat the hell?! What the hell with those eyes! huh!\u201dPeter and the other junior disciples shook their heads and tore up the cigarette again and threw the cover of the cigarette in the barrel.The intermediate disciple grabbed Peter by his collar, thinking that he had been ignored.The intermediate disciple was irritated at the situation where the inferior junior disciples who never dared to make eye contact with him, now looked at him with discontent.The intermediate disciple raised his fist to show Peter his place, but\u2026.At that moment, someone grabbed the intermediate disciples\u2019 arm.\u201c\u2026! Who the f*ck dare to\u2026 Huh? Master?\u201dThe intermediate disciple opened his mouth and eyes wide as if he had seen a lion.Joseph asked, looking at the intermediate disciple.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cAh.. Master, these guys dared to ignore my order and tried to attack\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u2026 How dare a low-level disciple try to attack an intermediate disciple?\u201dWhen questioned by Joseph, Peter and other junior students shook their heads.\u201cNo, Master. It was Sir who slapped Oliver on the head.\u201d\u201cReally? Why did you hit him?\u201d\u201cMaster, it\u2019s\u2026 he kept looking over there, and I was telling him to focus on his work.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201dJoseph placed his hand on the chin and thought for a while.\u201cDid Oliver ever slack off in his work?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cIf not, let him be. They were willing to work for the family after finishing all their work. If they didn\u2019t slack off, don\u2019t fret about it.\u201dJoseph said generously like a wise man.In fact, some of the junior disciples were moved by this kindness, while forgetting the fact that it was Joseph who created this hierarchical culture.\u201cLet\u2019s see. You look a little tired, go outside and rest for a while.\u201dThe intermediate disciple said with a confused expression.\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m fine. Master.\u201d\u201cNo, you look tired to me, Come on.\u201dThe intermediate disciple tried to deny it again, but he went out like a puppy whining, at Joseph\u2019s angry eyes.There was an awkward silence in the studio.\u201cWhat are you doing? WORK.\u201dRUSTLE RUSTLE.The junior disciples resumed work at Joseph\u2019s words.Oliver, who decided that the situation had improved to some extent, turned his head again and peeped at the process of producing Pilgaret.Of course, he didn\u2019t stop his hands, which kept working like a machine in auto-pilot mode.\u201cAre you curious?\u201d asked Joseph looking at Oliver.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cDo you want to know why we take the distillate and mix it with emotion over there in the flask?\u201d\u201cUm, yes Master\u2026 I\u2019m curious.\u201d\u201cTo mix emotions better with water. That distillation is extracted by boiling a drug called [solu] with several herbs, and it acts as a solution that permeates emotions better than just water. After the distillate is drained, it is mixed\u00a0 with the emotions in that round flask.\u201dOliver listened to Joseph\u2019s explanation while staring at the huge flask.\u201cWhen it gets mixed, it\u2019s heated and brewed again. The amount gets reduced, but the quality is even higher.\u201dOliver\u2019s eyes followed Joseph\u2019s finger that was pointing to a spinning flask tube and a secondary distillation liquid dripping from the end.The liquid in the huge distiller moved into a bucket and then into a cup.\u201cBring the cigarette barrel,\u201dOliver followed Joseph with a barrel filled with cigarette covers.When Oliver went inside, he saw senior disciples who were using black magic in the distilled liquid that had finished the second purification.\u201cThis is the last step. It\u2019s a step that uses black magic based on obsession to completely unite emotions and distillate. At this step, the actual quality is determined.\u201dOliver felt difficult to understand the words, but it felt easy to understand while looking with his eyes.Emotions that were still moving separately in the distilled liquid spread rapidly after the black magic processing stage, and then completely mixed with the distilled liquid and turned into a lump of emotion.Of course, this weakened the density, but the drug increased exponentially, and Joseph spread the cigarette from the barrel Oliver had brought in a wide tray, similar to an oven tin, and poured the finished distillate.\u201cYou can soak it in a cigarette like this, ripen it for a few hours, and put it in the dryer over there. Then, the Pilgaret is done.\u201dJoseph said, pointing to a dryer that looked like a concrete mixer.Just in time, a finished batch of Pilgaret came out, and one of the intermediate disciples carefully moved it and placed it on a workbench.There were other intermediate disciples in front of the workbench.They carefully weighed the Pilgaret using a scale, carefully placed them in the mold, pulled the lever, and started filling it in the empty filter-made cigarettes.The cigarettes thus made were piled up like mountains on one side, while the rest of the disciples filled the empty cigarette packs with 20 pilgarets.Joseph picked up a cigarette and said,\u201cThis is what Pilgaret is. It\u2019s no different from cigarettes on the outside. No one knows unless they do a close analysis. Usually, a piece sells for 100,000 grand. It\u2019s 2 million per pack. They usually sell between 50 and 100 packs a week. What do you think?\u201dJoseph stretched the Pilgaret he was holding to Oliver and Oliver took it in his hands.Through the paper wrapped around the cigarette, Oliver could see dew-like maternal love, and he instinctively knew that if he inhaled it, he could feel that emotion indirectly.Oliver instinctively wanted to have it.There was no reason.It was just a primal desire.When Oliver\u2019s eyes were blazing with greed, Joseph snatched Pilgaret from Oliver\u2019s hands.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dOliver exclaimed without realizing it.\u201cThere are three types of Pilgarets in total. Sedation based on motherhood or love, indirect pleasure based on sexual pleasure or drug-induced pleasure, and stimulants based on anger or hatred\u2026 How is it, is it fun?\u201dOliver replied flatteringly.\u201cYes, it\u2019s fun, Master.\u201d\u201cNice. So if you\u2019re asked to join us right now, can you do it?\u201dJoseph\u2019s sudden question made both the intermediate and senior disciples who were working turn in their direction.Oliver replied as usual.\u201cYes,\u201dOliver looked at the surroundings.The entire room which became silent was filled with various emotions of wariness and hatred.However, the heavy silence in the room got broken by the huge bang-a-door knock.Joseph smiled and asked, looking at the door.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cMaster. Someone came from the pharmacist\u2019s place. They finally found out about the guys who attacked us.\u201d\u201cNo, what the hell happened with our family discipline?\u201d\u201cI know. Did you all see the Master explain the work to that guy? F*ck.\u201d\u201cHe even asked him if he\u2019d like to do it himself. F*ck. It took me 7 years to get to the studio.\u201d\u201cYeah, this isn\u2019t fair.\u201dIn a corner of the basement where no one enters, Senior disciples and some intermediate disciples gathered and complained to each other.Today, they were the ones who benefited more from the Joseph family than anyone else, but ironically, they discussed injustice and equity.Well, maybe it\u2019s not that weird.They made some kind of contributions and came up to the place they were in a legitimate way, and Oliver\u2019s pace of growth was intimidating.He became a junior disciple less than ten days after he entered, and was even given a chance to be an intermediate disciple.However, their real dissatisfaction was not really equity.The real complaint is that their positions are threatened.The culture of a warlock who seeks power and establishes ranks based on their strengths has ironically changed to a form of preserving their place by killing the talented subordinates as soon as possible, and Oliver was now a direct threat to them.Everyone didn\u2019t admit it, but everyone knew.Oliver\u2019s talent is unrivaled.Now, it is barely suppressed by class differences, but if it is left as it is, there will be a time when it can no longer be checked by class alone, and then it will be for them to get pushed out of their positions.Before they knew it, everyone\u2019s eyes turned to Andrew.Joseph\u2019s most trusted disciple, the second-in-command of the family, and their de-facto leader.A senior disciple and a colleague asked Andrew cautiously.\u201cAre we going to leave him alone? At this rate, everything we\u2019ve built will be in vain.\u201dAndrew thought quietly and opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026\u2026. Don\u2019t rush.\u201d\u201cBut\u201d\u201cMaster is watching him now. We\u2019re the ones who\u2019ll die if we get caught after moving clumsily. We\u2019re still weaker than Master.\u201d\u201cWell?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s wait for the right time. This is a busy time, so if we wait, there will be a time when no one can doubt it. You know, I\u2019m lucky.\u201dNo one denied that.Andrew was lucky.He was talented as a Warlock, but he easily became a disciple thanks to a series of talented superiors fleeing from the family.On top of that, he had his own subtlety and craftiness.Andrew said convincingly.\u201cIf we wait patiently, the time will surely come.\u201dAs if it was a sign, suddenly, an intermediate disciple came and informed Andrew that the master had called.Andrew got up, picked up his coat, and left.He reassured the same faction once again before leaving.\u201cWait, there\u2019ll definitely be a chance.\u201dThen Andrew went through the ant-cave hallway and arrived at Joseph\u2019s room.When he knocked on the door, he heard a call to come in, and when he entered, Joseph had just finished talking to the person sent by the pharmacist.\u201cHere you are?\u201d\u201cYes. What\u2019s the matter, Master?\u201d\u201cThe pharmacist said to have identified the man who attacked us. Well, it seems the guy wants to eat this whole Wineham.\u201d\u201cWhat? Who\u2019s that fearless b*stard, Master?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s WIZARDS.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dAndrew asked again, questioning his ears.\u201cWizard. Wizard from the Tower. They seem to have come here with some Landa\u2019s scoundrels.\u201d\u201cWizard is here\u2026? Is that possible? Aren\u2019t they doing well in Landa? Plus, there is the Tower.\u201d\u201cWell, I can\u2019t believe it yet, but considering the expensive scrolls and the pharmacist\u2019s information, I guess we have to believe it. There are rumors that Wizards are also struggling because of fierce competition these days.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cIf our opponent is Wizards, things might get messier. Full-fledged Wizards are like living weapons. Maybe it\u2019s hard to deal with just the force of the pharmacist.\u201d\u201cThen, are we going to help the pharmacist?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s our enemy anyway, so we\u2019d better work together and eradicate them before the other flies come in and the situation gets twisted\u2026 Anthony and the Dominic family also decided to help.\u201dAndrew nodded knowing the meaning \u2013 Things seemed to have gotten bigger than he thought.\u201cThen\u2026should I also have to join the battle?\u201d\u201cI guess so. Do you have any complaints?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t, Master. That\u2019s what I was hoping for.\u201dAndrew told the lie as if it was true.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re willing to accept it. I wouldn\u2019t worry if it\u2019s you, I\u2019ll give you plenty of people to support. Take 2 fellow senior disciples, 4 intermediate disciples, and 6 junior disciples. That should be safe.\u201dAt that moment a flash of thought passed like a lightning in Andrew\u2019s head.Yes, the opportunity has already come.\u201cMaster. May I ask you a little favor?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cMay I pick the people who will join the support team?\u201dAndrew thought of Oliver and said so.As expected, he was lucky.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17In the evening when the sun went down.A huge six-wheeled truck was driven down the road of Wineham.This is the truck that transports goods between Landa and Wineham, it was large and sturdy, but the compaction compartment has been remodeled so that it can also be used as a luggage truck or a transport truck that can transport people depending on the convenience.Some of the junior disciples, including Oliver, were riding on this truck as if to prove the facts about the truck.\u201cYou\u2019ve probably already heard the explanation, but I\u2019ll still explain it again! The opponents we are going to fight this time are wizards!!\u201dThe man in front of the truck compartment spoke.The man was Pharmacist\u2019s subordinate, employee A, who was carrying a submachine gun T-series on his arm.The junior disciples, who came along without knowing what was going on, were all suddenly surprised by the sudden revelation.\u2018We\u2019re going to fight?\u2019\u2018That too Wizards?\u2019Employee A in the front spoke after seeing their reactions.\u201cOh my gosh\u2026 you didn\u2019t hear anything?\u201dOne of the junior disciples opened his mouth and asked.\u201cWhat do you mean by we are going to a fight?\u201d\u201cAs far as I heard, there are some people who were attacking all of us, including you guys? Apparently, they\u2019re mobs from Landa and there were also some wizards mixed among them.\u201d\u201cThis is crazy\u2026why are the wizards even here? They\u2019re all supposed to be super-rich, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cOh my god\u2026. I felt something was wrong.\u201d\u201cHow can they not even say a word\u2026\u201d\u201cF*ck\u2026\u201dThe junior disciples mumbled one after another and expressed their anxiety.It may be strange for a Warlock to feel anxious like this, but considering that most of them are 16 to 19 years old, it was understandable to some extent.Moreover, they only knew how to use black magic, and they were lacking in skills when it comes to actual combat.However, Employee A screamed as if he didn\u2019t like their reactions.\u201cShut up everyone! I am trying to treat you nice because you guys are still a warlock, but why are you guys whining like a moron? The conversation with your boss is already over! If you want to live, get ready to fight with us! Okay?!\u201dEveryone was dispirited and went silent.Except for one \u2013 Oliver.Oliver, who was sitting quietly raised his hand.\u201c\u2026.what?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s a wizard?\u201dEmployee A, who had been frowning suddenly relaxed his expression and made an absurd expression as if he had seen a fool.Everyone looked at Oliver with a dumbstruck expression.\u201c Wizards are people who can use magic. Not black magic, but the original..Real magic\u2026Ah\u2026. Why the f*ck am I even explaining this?\u201dOriginal?Real Magic?When Oliver tried to question what the real magic was, someone intervened.\u201cAre they really wizards? How is it possible? Why would a wizard come here to fight with us?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was just saying what I heard. Anyway, the other side is said to be having wizards, that\u2019s why we\u2019re taking you guys.\u201dOliver still didn\u2019t know what a wizard was, but he could see they are someone who is dangerous looking at the sweating face of his companions.In the front corner, Employee-A stood without talking.He took the wooden box that was there and opened its lid.The wooden box had pistols and knife.\u201cBoss told me that you guys are still short on firepower, so we prepared some weapons for you guys. Everyone, come and pick one up.\u201dThe guys in front received their guns in order.There was even a small quarrel amongst themselves to grab the stronger-looking gun.Oliver watched the scene as if it had nothing to do with him, and quietly asked Peter next to him.For your information, Peter was also very nervous due to the circumstances.\u201cWhat does he mean by the wizards who use real magic?\u201dPeter looked at Oliver who had an earnest eye.Peter felt like if he was in a situation where he was about to die, Oliver would ask questions in the same way.\u201cHuh\u2026 Literally. Wizards use real Magic. Black magic is a kind of sub-division that sees and imitates real magic.\u201d\u201cHo\u2026\u201dOliver was astonished.The black magic that looks strong and beautiful enough to him was just an imitation of real magic.He wanted to know more about the Real magic.\u201cTell me more.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Aren\u2019t you curious about this situation? We\u2019re going to fight soon. If we were to do something wrong, we could all die. Aren\u2019t you afraid of dying?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid of dying.\u201dIt was a sincere answer.Oliver was also afraid of death, and he didn\u2019t want to die.However, his curiosity about black magic and emotions was greater than the fear of death.Like a moth leaping into a fire on its own will.Peter was even more astonished at Oliver and said.\u201cYou\u2019re really\u2026 amazing.\u201d\u201cThank you\u2026.well? Then, what about the answer?\u201dIt was then.The truck stopped.A voice was heard from outside, and Employee A shouted and asked them to get off the truck along with him, so Oliver and Peter had no choice but to get out of their seats.Peter answered on the way to walking down.\u201cIf I don\u2019t die and come back alive, I\u2019ll answer whatever you want.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026, then it\u2019s okay.\u201dAs they got off the truck, they saw senior and intermediate disciples getting off the other trucks.Because they were with Andrew, they seemed very relaxed, unlike the junior disciples.In addition to them, there were 20 gangsters with shotguns, automatic rifles, and baseball bats, along with a group of Warlocks they had never seen before.Peter looked at them and explained to Oliver that they were from Anthony and the Dominic family\u201cOther\u00a0 family?\u201d\u201cYeah, there are two other families besides us in Wineham. That one is the Anthony family and the other one is the Dominic family. One specialized in manipulation and the other in disease.\u201dOliver saw a man in a trench coat and a man in leather work clothes.\u201cManipulation and disease?\u201d\u201cOh, you haven\u2019t learned it yet? Manipulation means manipulating people, animals, and even corpses, while disease means strengthening and weakening the body. Roughly that\u2019s how it is.\u201dOliver nodded happily at the new fact he had learned.He felt like he wanted to go directly to the people over there and ask what manipulation or disease magic was.But he couldn\u2019t because Andrew was talking to them.He couldn\u2019t hear what they were talking about, but it seemed like they were talking about something very serious.A muffled conversation could be heard from the other side.\u201cIt seems like\u00a0 Wizards are really here. Otherwise, it is impossible for the three families to come together like this?\u201d\u201cIs it because the pharmacist asked for help?\u201d\u201cMaybe\u2026.?\u201d\u201cHonestly, I just wish we hadn\u2019t taken on such a dangerous mission.\u201dThey were all frightened, and at that moment Andrew, who finished his conversation, approached in the direction of junior disciples.As soon as he approached them, he opened a test tube he had and casted black magic on everyone.[Eavesdropper][Mouth whispering]A thin black light entered everyone\u2019s ears and mouth.\u201cAh, is this\u2026?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I just prepared this just in case there was something urgent to say. Just tell me when you are in need of something.\u201d\u201cOh oh\u2026.\u201dSome people were amazed.After all, Andrew is Joseph\u2019s best disciple and the second-in-command in the family.Looking at everyone Andrew began to speak.\u201cEveryone must have heard of it on the way, but still I will say it once again, from now on we are going to fight against the raiders who attacked us a while ago.\u201dOne of the junior disciples raised his hand cautiously.\u201cAre we really going to fight against wizards?\u201dAndrew stayed silent for a moment, which made everyone nervous.\u201c.\u2026.Yes.\u201d\u201cAh really\u2026.\u201dWhen the terrified voice leaked out, Andrew spoke strongly.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of\u00a0 wizards, everyone! The pharmacist indeed said that there are wizards, but it was only three of them. And even those three of them are the ones who got kicked out of the Magic Tower, so there\u2019s no need to be afraid. Other than that, there\u2019s just a bunch of gangsters from Landa and a bunch of third-rate gangs that they\u2019ve pulled from here\u2026By the way, compared to them we are double in size, and three families of warlocks are also united. So there\u2019s no way we\u2019ll lose.\u201dAt Andrew\u2019s confident remarks, the faces of the junior disciples softened.Andrew nailed it there.\u201cMoreover, the Anthony family has already released the rats to find the enemy\u2019s hideout. We have already found out how many troops there are and where the traps are. The fight has already been won. You guys just need to go there and cover for them.\u201d\u201cThen? Are you not coming with us, Senior Andrew?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m leaving, I\u2019m just going to a different location.\u201dAndrew made a brief outline of the map in the air using black magic.The map was modeled after a closed factory area on the outskirts of this place.\u201cThis factory is their hideout, you just have to go to the front door with the guys over there and get their attention.\u201d\u201cThen what about you, Sir.Andrew?\u201d\u201cI will go through the back door along with these guys and hit the enemy from the back. It\u2019s a two-way operation. The wizards will definitely watch the situation and will try to retreat, so we\u2019ll wait in the back and make a surprise attack. If we pour out all of our firepowers at the same time, the wizards will die for sure.\u201dIn other words, Andrew was in charge of the most troublesome wizards.All of the junior disciples pretended not to be happy, but their faces brightened.If they were to fight against the wizards with the help of\u00a0 Andrew, they thought their chances of surviving would increase dramatically.Andrew asked as if he knew what was going on in their minds.\u201cYeah, are you okay now?\u201d\u201cAh, yes, yes.\u201d\u201cStill, I can\u2019t just let you go yet. I\u2019ll send this guy along with you. Think of him as me and listen to everything he says carefully.\u201dAndrew said while pointing to a fellow senior disciple standing next to him.Everyone answered at the same time.\u201cYes!\u201dWhen Senior Disciple 1 was about to move with the junior disciples, Andrew suddenly grabbed Oliver\u2019s shoulder.\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dPeter asked in surprise.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI gave you part of my strength. So it is natural for you to give me one of your strengths. And it\u2019s this guy that\u2019s most useful. What? Do you have some problems with it?\u201dPeter didn\u2019t say anything.There were some things that didn\u2019t add up, but Andrew\u2019s eyes were terrifying.Andrew asked Oliver.\u201cWhy? don\u2019t you want to follow me?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, if it\u2019s Sir\u2019s command. I will follow\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026 Then you guys go over there. Once you guys\u00a0enter, we\u2019ll go too. Come on, move it.\u201dThe number of people in the main gate group was approximately thirty.Most of them were armed with guns, knives, and sticks.Objectively, the firepower wasn\u2019t strong, but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t talented.For example, the black magic that the Anthony family is preparing now was something like that \u2013 A magic that wasn\u2019t strong but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t useful.Anthony family brought three skinny dogs from somewhere, took the emotions out of the test tube, and casted a black magic spell.[Fighting Spirit][Obedience]Then the dogs, which had been starving for days, began to growl in anger, and at the same time, like a trained dog, they began to obey human commands.Andrew, who was watching this scene from afar, muttered as if he knew everything.\u201c[Fighting Spirit] is to bring out the rage of the target, and [Obedience] is a kind of spiritual domination that makes them obey. This way, even an ordinary dog can be used as a good weapon\u2026\u201dEveryone nodded as if they understood what he was saying.Oliver was one of them, but after a while, a more interesting scene unfolded.The warlock on Dominic\u2019s side, dressed in leather overall, was casting black magic on Anthony\u2019s dog again.[Lifron][Muscle Up]With that, the dog began to roar loudly.The body seemed to swell like a bread dough, the hair fell out and the red skin underneath expanded rapidly.No, it wasn\u2019t the skin. It was the muscles and bones which grew so fast.The neck suddenly finished expanding and the dog changed into another creature that resembles a dog, and the casters of the black magic smiled in satisfaction as if they had achieved their goal.Oliver looked at the scene with great interest.It was amazing that one can use black magic in many ways, not limiting it by just shooting it.It was very interesting to create a greater synergy with the superposition effect.However, it was disappointing that they did it in such a way that the subject would be ruined afterward due to the side effects.Oliver thought he would have improved it and wondered why the other warlocks are not doing it.The leader of the main gate group waved his hand and announced that he would enter.Andrew nodded and was preparing to break through the back door.TAK TAK TAKThe main gate group headed to the main gate of the factory along the alley.After a while, a blue flash of light could be seen along with a squeaking sound, followed by screams and gunshots.Andrew watched the scene for a moment and then slowly started moving while saying.\u201cNow that the meat shield has gone over there, shall we make a move?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Genius 18Oliver and Andrew together with the crew members walked along the back alley towards the back of the factory.Even while moving, blue lights kept flashing from the front door along with the screams and gunshots.At that moment someone spoke.\u201cEven after coming here I had doubts whether Wizards would be here, but now it seems to be true. Looking at those well-made magic traps\u2026.they seem to be real Wizards.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s more advantageous for us if they can keep drawing attention like that. We don\u2019t need to care about the back.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t they have set a trap in the back?\u201dAt that thought, Andrew paused for a moment.If you think about it, it was a very natural assumption.It was highly likely that a trap was set up on the side where the defense was poor.After a moment of thought, Andrew abruptly turned his head to look at Oliver.\u201cOliver, take the lead.\u201d\u201c???\u201d\u201cYou have a sharp sense, so I think you can avoid traps, right? So, you will be at the forefront.\u201dA ridiculously far-fetched reason.However, Oliver had no choice but to nod his head.If he were to reject the command here, he instinctively knows that something will happen.From the time Andrew grabbed him, Oliver felt something unusual, and now when he was looking around, he was surrounded by people with hostility.These are people who will do harm at any time if anything goes wrong.Oliver had fallen into a well-established trap that even he wasn\u2019t aware of.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAndrew spoke while standing behind Oliver, who had been forced to lead.Naturally, Oliver moved again according to his instinct, but he could feel Andrew\u2019s murderous intent behind his back even though he couldn\u2019t see it.Andrew was now as hostile to Oliver as he was to the enemies.Oliver couldn\u2019t understand why Andrew was doing this to him.However, this curiosity also disappeared due to Oliver\u2019s survival instinct.The important thing now was not knowing why Andrew is doing this, but getting out of this tricky situation.Oliver felt that there would be a very high probability that he would be in danger if he stayed near Andrew like this.Still, Oliver didn\u2019t show any suspicious movements and kept moving forward.Oliver kept thinking about how to get out of this crisis.While he was thinking about it, all of a sudden, the sparsely lit street lamp around the group suddenly went off.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cwhat?\u201dIn an instant, the surroundings got swallowed up by the darkness and at that moment everyone could see several beams of light coming, flying from the upper floor of the factory building.[Magic Missile]A mass amount of magic poured out like a rain shower.Andrew and his party, who were already moving through a narrow alley, could not dodge the attack since they were trapped like a mouse in a cage.They had no choice but to stand there stupidly.At that moment, Andrew exclaimed.\u201cEveryone Defend! Black Shield!\u201dEveryone came to their senses at the shout and opened a black curtain toward the direction from where the magic missile came flying.PAPANG! PAPTANG!! PANG!The high-speed magic missile was blocked by a black curtain and the missiles exploded like firecrackers in the air.The surroundings became bright for a moment due to the colorful sparks.At that moment, gangsters hiding in front of them suddenly came out and fired their guns all at once.\u201cScrape it! Grind it! Kill them all!\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dDoo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo\u2014\u2013!!!Muzzle blazed flashing with a loud noise.The Black Shield deployed to block the magic missiles that were falling from the sky made it difficult for them to block bullets from the front.The darkness surrounding them also made their response to get delayed.Under normal circumstances, allied warlocks would have collapsed due to the forefront attack from the flashing muzzle flames.But that didn\u2019t happen.It was because Oliver, who noticed them first, deployed a huge black shield towards the front.Ting! Tak! Tading Dang\u2014\u2014! Tak!Perfect block!With a dull sound, all the bullets were blocked by the black wall.But Oliver was not satisfied with just that.He quickly extracted the emotions and initiated an attack on the gangsters who attacked from the front.[Target]The extracted emotions flew like smoke and turned into a target mark searching for the enemies.As soon as he saw the target, Oliver fired a Las bullet right away.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cwhat!\u201d\u201cKek!\u201dThe bullets of hatred accurately struck the enemies.Many members of the gang fell all at once and at that time the one who seemed to be the commander shouted.\u201cDamn! It\u2019s a Counterattack. Get back. Get back.\u201dFar from being successful, they were suddenly counterattacked which made the gangsters run away without looking back, but at that very moment, Andrew shouted.\u201cThe enemies are running away. Go after them! Charge! You cover! Don\u2019t miss them!\u201dIn accordance with Andrew\u2019s instructions, half of the allies of Warlocks jumped in unison to attack the fleeing gangsters while the other half covered the allies by blowing the Las bullet towards the Wizard, who shot Magic missiles from the upper floor of the factory.\u201cDamn it!\u201d\u201cF*ck-!\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201dThe gangsters who ran away with their backs were hit by Las bullets and fell one after another.Everyone got excited because of the sudden battle, but Oliver did not join them, instead, he leaned into the darkness and looked around calmly.Although his vision was blocked due to the darkness, his third eye for emotions, the warlock\u2019s eye, worked. So he had no trouble understanding the situation.\u201cUh\u2026 um?\u201dOliver noticed something strange.It\u2019s not due to the gangsters who obviously got scared and ran away, but it was because of the wizard who was exchanging attacks with the warlocks from above the factory was very calm.As if he was waiting for something.Although he couldn\u2019t figure out what it was, Oliver didn\u2019t feel very good, so he spread out the black shield and wrapped it around his body like armor.It is to be prepared for any emergency.At that time, an unusual energy arose from the front door.A flash of blue light flashed like before, and then, suddenly, a huge stalk of thorns rose from the ground to the sky, illuminating the entire surroundings.RUMBLE RUMBLE\u2014\u2014-!!!\u201c\u2026\u2026!!!\u201dEveryone stopped and turned towards the front door, they were startled by the threatening yet alien sight.However, that was an obvious mistake.They had to prepare rather than be standing idly.\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on? What\u2019s going on?!\u201dAndrew placed his hand on his ears and inquired at the front, but instead of answering, the bright blue lightning he saw in the front door spread out from the front door to the back door within a few seconds.Before everyone could react, it exploded and swept the surroundings in an instant.It swept away the warlocks and gangsters on both sides.DUD DUD DUD\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!!!\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..!!!\u201d\u201cAww\u2026!\u201dNaturally, Oliver was also swept away by the lightning strike, and an excruciating pain that he felt for the first time in his life hit his spine, to the point his head almost went blank.It was fortunate that he had a black shield around his body, and if he didn\u2019t, he would have been baked brown like the numerous bodies scattered on the street now.If struck, immediate death was inevitable.Oliver lay down with the bodies and pretended to be dead.Oliver seemed to have got a vague understanding of why everyone was afraid of the wizards.At that moment, a man wrapped with lightning bolts around his body came down to the messy ground.Apparently, he is a wizard.\u201cHeh! I was looking forward to seeing what the fake wizards are capable of, but it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? There\u2019s no way anyone can deal with you, no, it doesn\u2019t make sense in the first place. You\u2019re a genius even at the Tower.The wizard, who was holding the warlocks in check from the upper floor of the factory, said gently descending in the wind.The Lightning Wizard spoke again.\u201cStill, I thought there would be someone. I heard there\u2019s a tough guy in this town. It\u2019s too boring for the first fight away from the Tower.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same for me\u2026.what else can we do? Our side suffered damages too.\u201dsaid the wizard, pointing to the brown-fried gangsters around him.The Lightning Wizard was calm.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. They are the ones bought to fill up the numbers anyway. If the news of our victory goes around, guys like this will swarm. It\u2019s not a bad idea to change to some sturdy tools.\u201dOliver knew what he meant.Oliver still didn\u2019t know what kind of being a wizard is, but he could tell that the thoughts of wizards were different from those of ordinary people.It felt like they were self-centered people.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s fine. we\u2019ve cleaned up here, so let\u2019s go to the front door to clean up\u2026\u201dBANG!A black bullet suddenly flew in, and the wizard stopped what he was saying and deployed his magical powers to spread the shield.At the end of the attack, there was Andrew, standing surrounded by black curtains everywhere.It\u2019s no wonder that he\u2019s the second in rank in the family.When everyone got attacked by the lightning, he was the only one to protect himself by spreading a shield.He even tried to attack the wizards, but, it didn\u2019t bring any change in the eyes of the wizards\u201cHey\u2026 look, there\u2019s a guy who defended my attack.\u201d\u201cCan I help you?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I want to see some of the skills of a black wizard, the so-called warlock. Since I\u2019ve put together a rough estimate on the front door, it doesn\u2019t really matter even if we didn\u2019t go.\u201dWith those words, the Lightning Wizard once again gathered his magical powers.Clear blue magic power gradually gathering could be seen, and Andrew immediately attacked as if telling, he was an idiot to let him gather his powers.[Hate Bullet!][Las Bomb!][Black Javelin!]Bullets of hate, bombs of rage, and black javelins flew swiftly and struck the Lightning Wizard.But unfortunately, instead of spreading a shield, the wizard once again covered his body with lightning and quickly avoided it.An effective strategy to prevent meaningless magic consumption.After dodging, the lightning around him disappeared.[Lightning!][Black Shield!]A blue lightning current flew along with a piercing sound, but it was blocked by a black curtain.However, it was not completely blocked.Despite being blocked, due to the unique nature of lightning, it spread out and indirectly caused damage.Andrew felt pain continuously, though not fatal, eventually making him spread the Black Shield wide, creating a round, full-body shield once again.[Black Marvel!]It was then.The wizard quickly narrowed the distance as if he was aiming for it and struck the shield with his magical hand.[Lightning Explosion!!]Once again, a flash of huge lightning burst out and lit up the surroundings.As the flashes subsided, all that could be seen was Andrew, whose body got burned and had his arm blown off.\u201cHa\u2026Is this the level of fake wizards?\u201dThe Lightning Wizard said, looking down at Andrew.Contrary to his disappointing appearance, he was drenched in a sense of great superiority on the inside, and he glanced at his own victory with great satisfaction.The other fellow wizard was also off-guard and relaxed.At that moment, Oliver, who had been lying dead, got up and fired hate bullets with both hands.Since it was an attack that came at an unexpected time, the Wizard who was nearby could not react and his body got pierced in vain.\u201cColin\u2026?\u201dUnfortunately, the most dangerous wizard quickly evaded the attack.The Lightning Wizard, who had escaped the attack, approached the fallen wizard and checked the condition.The Lightning Wizard\u2019s emotions were fluctuating with shock and sadness, while Oliver slowly and quietly walked away, creating a small orb called a \u2018minion\u2019.Oliver knew that it was very difficult to deal with that wizard alone right now, but at that moment the wizard called Oliver.\u201cSTOP.\u201dOliver stopped and looked back.The wizard, whose magic and emotions were fluctuating, glared at Oliver with eyes filled with rage.\u201cYou\u2026 I\u2019LL KILL YOU.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 That\u2019s troublesome.\u201dOliver answered, scattering the minions in the air unnoticed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19\u201cDIEEEEE!\u201dThe Lightning Wizard shouted and threw a block of blue lightning at Oliver.Oliver recalled the wizard\u2019s battle with Andrew, so instead of blocking it with a black shield, he fired a Las Bullet and shot the lightning down before it even came to him.As expected, the lump of lightning exploded as soon as it got hit by the Las bullet scattering the blue lightning around it.It was a difficult attack to block because it was fast and dealt indirect damage to the counter.Even though the lightning attack was blocked, the wizard quickly approached Oliver in a flash without panic, as if he had expected this.Once again, the first attack was to steal the attention for a while, which was similar to his previous fight with Andrew.The difference is that Oliver can see the flow of emotions and magical powers while anticipating the path before the lightning Wizard approaches and countered it.[Las bomb][Double Las Bullet]He fired a [Las bomb] ahead towards the predicted path to interrupt the opponent, then fired one Las bullet on both sides.Thanks to this, the wizard was perplexed for a moment and the question of how he predicted his movement appeared on his mind.It was even difficult for Oliver to explain the principle behind his attack.For a brief moment before the opponent\u2019s body gets covered with lightning, He could see small stalks of lightning extending out from the wizard in accordance with the direction of attack.Also, he could predict how the opponent would move according to the fluctuation of his emotions.In that way, by predicting the direction of attack and the movement of the opponent, Oliver was able to fight against the wizard.[Lightning][Las Bullet]As they circled around each other, the Lightning Wizard fired electricity, and Oliver immediately fired a bullet of hate.But it was a deception.The wizard turned to the side as Oliver\u2019s vision was blocked like a flash of lightning.Oliver didn\u2019t even turn his head instead he stretched out his hand and fired several shots toward the right.It happened almost simultaneously which made the wizard quickly deploy the shield to block all hate bullets.BABABANG\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!!The Lightning Wizard successfully blocked the attack and retreated due to the shock.He looked at Oliver without saying a word, thinking about the number of attacks they had exchanged.Oliver looked at him silently.To be precise, he pretended to be looking while observing his emotions.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHis emotions, fluctuating with hatred and anger, soon regained its composure, which was not good news for Oliver.The more intense the emotion, the easier it was to understand what\u2019s inside that person.As he was contemplating what to do next, the wizard spoke to him.\u201cWere you the Leader of this group?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs it you the real Leader? Not him.\u201dThe Lightning Wizard pointed at Andrew, who had fell in a miserable state.\u201cNo\u2026he\u2019s the Leader. He was a disciple at the highest level. I\u2019m just a low level disciple\u201dOliver lengthened his words to extend the amount of time.\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cCan I ask you something too?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but from what I\u2019ve heard, Wizards don\u2019t come here often, why did you guys come here?\u201dIn a time-consuming manner, Oliver asked sincerely.Oliver\u2019s words seemed to have stabbed the Lightning wizard in a sensitive spot, and the corners of his mouth twitched as he looked at his colleagues who had been hit by the Las bullet and had collapsed.The Wizard\u2019s emotions seemed to fluctuate again.\u201cAh\u2026 I think you came with the colleague over there? Was he a precious person to you?\u201dThe wizard quietly turned his head to look at Oliver again.His emotions started scorching again, but it was also calm and controlled due to a strong reason.Just like A cold fire.It was the first time Oliver had ever seen a person who controlled his emotions like this, so he was amazed, but after a while, he found out the cause.Starting at his feet, a blue lightning current ran through the ground in an instant.It was directly aimed at Oliver.Jijijijiji\u2014\u2014!Oliver quickly fired a Las bullet to stop the lightning from approaching him, and then targeted the wizard.Oliver\u2019s black magic [Target] dramatically increases the accuracy by targeting the opponent based on hatred.A dartboard appears on the wizard\u2019s body, and Oliver scatters a dozen small blades of hatred in the air.[Black Dart]It was a magic that mimics Andrew\u2019s [Black Javelin] from earlier, and its power was weak, but due to that Oliver was able to create a lot more darts.When targeting magic was combined with darts magic, dozens of black darts scattered in the air flew toward the wizard as if it was attracted to a magnet.In a normal case, the opponent would have suffered from not being able to respond properly, but Oliver\u2019s opponent was a wizard, not an easy-going opponent, he immediately surrounded his body with lightning and started to run again.But it didn\u2019t matter.The black darts were obsessive and were made to chase the target till the end\u2026\u201cAh!\u201dAt that moment Oliver noticed his mistake.Black darts are magic that chases the target. However, the speed was not comparable to that of the Lightning Wizard.Knowing this, the Lightning Wizard who was running, suddenly turned and ran towards Oliver.Oliver tried to change the direction of the wizard by attacking, but they were countered by the Lightning Wizard\u2019s attack.[Lightning][Lightning Ball][Magic Missile]Oliver fired a consecutive round of Las bullets as he had done before, but as soon as the attack collided, an explosion occurred, instantly blocking his vision.Oliver quickly deployed the Black Shield.At that moment, the lightning wizard passed through the smoke, and with him, there was the black darts that pierced the black shield.Pak! Pak! Paba Bak\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!The Black darts that pierced the black shield did not penetrate the shield completely but the black shield was pierced to some extent and it was at that moment, a bolt of lightning flashed from behind.The Lightning Wizard attacked Oliver from the back in the brief moment when Oliver was focused on the front.Oliver fell face down, unable to control himself due to the shock from the electricity.His body wasn\u2019t blown away or burned, but he was completely defenseless.With the sound of footsteps, Oliver could feel that the Wizard was approaching.\u201cApart from personal resentment, I do recognize your skills. A self-proclaimed lower-class disciple. It was a little fun to fight against a fake wizard.\u201dHe turned Oliver with his feet and looked down.The Wizard was still furious at the death of his comrade.\u201c\u2026Sir, can you spare me?\u201d\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t hurt my friend, I could have pretended not to know anything.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026then\u2026. he must have been a very precious person to you.\u201d\u201cUh, he just came out of the Tower with me.\u201d\u201cWhy did you come out of the Tower?\u201dThe wizard didn\u2019t answer.Instead, he gathered magic power in his hand and created blue lightning.\u201cI don\u2019t want to tell someone like you.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s a pity. But I\u2019m fine\u2026.. because I\u2019ve bought enough time.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what?\u201dThe moment the Wizard asked, a small Las bullet flew out of nowhere and made a small hole in the wizard\u2019s neck.The power was mediocre, but the location was fatal.The wizard staggered while spewing blood bubbles, and Oliver was able to overcome the crisis.\u201cNuk-Kuk\u2026!\u201dOliver couldn\u2019t hear anything because of the blood dripping from his throat and the amount of blood-filled in the Wizard\u2019s mouth.But, Oliver understood that he was asking how he got attacked and explained it to the best of his ability.\u201cAh, It\u2019s all thanks to this.\u201dOliver said while pointing to the small sphere orb floating in the mid-air.It was smaller than a fist, and it looked like a meatball, but strangely, there were only chapped lips.\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018minion\u2019, I made this with reference to \u2018Eater\u2019 which my master once showed me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s slow and weak in power, but it\u2019s pretty handy, isn\u2019t it?\u201dOliver asked genuinely without mocking, wondering what kind of evaluation the wizard would give.However, the wizard, instead of giving a rating, tried running away somewhere while holding the blood-filled neck.Confusion and fear could be seen in the usual confident eyes of the Wizard.Oliver found the test tube, which he had dropped earlier when he fell but unfortunately it was broken.\u201cHa\u2026I\u2019m sorry, but can you please wait a minute. Just a moment.\u201dSaying that to the fleeing wizard, Oliver searched through the arms of the dead Senior and Intermediate disciples.Fortunately, he was able to find three healthy test tubes, and the wizard sat down after hearing Oliver\u2019s words.As the Wizard sensed the approaching death, he gathered his magical energy in his hand.He could not collect much of his energy as blood spurted from his neck like a fountain again.\u201cKeuk \u2026\u2026 Surely \u2026 definitely \u2026 Neeudro \u2026 Zugskuu \u2026\u2026. Neue \u2026 Neuah.\u201dOliver extracted emotions from the test tube and aimed at the wizard.The Wizard\u2019s Life-force gradually faded, and his emotions started to cloud with the fear of death.He really thought this was the end, but at that very moment, a completely unexpected change occurred.In that brief moment when the Wizard\u2019s Life-force completely disappeared, the emotions of the wizard, which had been clouded with fear, shone more beautifully than any emotions Oliver had ever seenOliver was more shocked than when he was attacked by the wizard.Oliver instinctively tried to extract that emotion, but it was already too late and the Wizard had already died.\u201cAhhhhh\u2026\u2026..\u201dIn shock and sorrow, Oliver sighed.That beautiful light had disappeared and Oliver didn\u2019t know what it was.Oliver looked through the magician\u2019s body as if trying not to leave any lingering feelings and he got his hand on something.There was something inside the vest the wizard was wearing and when he opened and checked it, there was something covered by leather.It was a notebook.When Oliver opened the notebook, he found that it was a diary.A diary that was written by the wizard.Oliver stuffed the diary into his pocket as if he had found a treasure.He wondered if it could tell him about the beautiful emotions he saw a moment ago.BIIP BIIPAt that time, the sound of a machine came from somewhere.Oliver walked in the direction of the sound.The sound came from the wizard that Oliver had killed first, and when he searched the body of the wizard, he found a small metal machine.The word \u2018Hermes\u2019 was written on the outside of the metal machine.[BIIP! BIIP! Wizard. Wizard! This\u2026 BIIP! Front\u2026 BIIP! BIIP! Requesting support\u2026!]Oliver came to his senses as soon as he heard those words.The battle still hasn\u2019t ended.Oliver was sad because he had lost such a beautiful light, but that didn\u2019t mean it was all over.He was still on a mission.Oliver got up and went into the factory.He focused his attention on the eyes and looked around, but there was no emotion from within the factory.He thought it would be because of the fierce fight that everyone might have went out of the factory, just as the wizards did, so Oliver climbed upstairs and looked down at the battlefield from the front door.There were destroyed materials and dribs everywhere, and there were quite a few corpses of allies.Even though they were losing, the remaining allies somehow managed to hold out by using the shield.One of the gangsters gladly raised his hand, as if he had mistaken Oliver for someone.\u201cWizard! I sent the message! Here. Support\u2026!\u201dOliver provided support as requested.He opened all the test tubes to extract emotions and the targets he selected to use the black magic were the gangsters that called for support.\u201cHuh? Wizard?\u201dBefore the gangs could even respond, Oliver made dozens of small [Las bombs] and covered them with black darts, then scattered them in the air.Oliver used quite a bit of emotions, but it wasn\u2019t difficult with enough ingredients.The small darts, which was spinning suddenly flew to the designated place as if it were attracted to a magnet, and a small bombing took place where the gangsters are located.The untimely bombardment left the gangs confused and terrified.There was only one person who showed a confident grasp of the situation.He was the last Wizard standing.Oliver jumped out of the window while throwing cling webs on the ground.The Cling web spread out on the surrounding objects and walls and caught the falling Oliver like a safety net.As Oliver jumped off from the net he shot seven pre-loaded Hate Bullets at the same time.In a sudden attack, the wizard was confused and defended himself by deploying a magic shield, but unfortunately, it lacked strength.When the seven Las bullets were thrown at the same time, the shock resonated and the power was multiplied several times, and the whole shield shook and broke like a plate.\u201cCome on, help\u2026!\u201dThe Wizard cried out in fear.For a moment, Oliver hesitated thinking whether this wizard would emit a beautiful light like the Lightning Wizard, and somehow it felt he wouldn\u2019t, still, Oliver shot a Las bullet.The Las bullet flew through the wizard\u2019s body, and the wizard squirmed like a bug, spouting blood.After a while, the surrounding smoke lifted and silence fell.The pharmacist\u2019s men and other warlocks, who had barely managed to fight the wizard and the gangsters, came out one by one.They looked silently at Oliver, who had attacked and killed the enemy alone.Oliver looked at them and said.\u201cAre you all okay?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I will use this as my first stepping stone.]FLAPFLAPFLAP FLAP.\u201c\u2026what are you reading?\u201dMarie, who approached Oliver all of a sudden, asked.\u201cIt\u2019s a diary.\u201d\u201cDiary?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I got it from a wizard.\u201cah\u2026\u2026.\u201dMarie was silent for a moment as if she didn\u2019t know what to say, and then asked again.\u201cWas there anything interesting\u2026?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 not really.\u201d\u201cThen why are you reading it?\u201dOliver turned his head slightly and looked up at Marie.\u201cI\u2019m curious.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe wizard who was the owner of this diary\u2026 Before he died, he radiated a beautiful light which I have never seen before\u2026 So I was wondering if I could find out if I read his diary.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 So that\u2019s why. Did you find out the reason?\u201d\u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t find it. There\u2019s nothing special about him\u2026..what did you come here for?\u201dMarie smiled slightly at Oliver\u2019s question.\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to tell you\u2026..I finally got promoted to a junior disciple.\u201dOliver didn\u2019t show much of a reaction.Marie had a bitter expression on her face at his reaction.\u201cA lot of the intermediate disciples died during the last battle, so the junior disciples were promoted in large numbers, and thanks to that, I was able to fill the vacant position.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 congratulations?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026It\u2019s all thanks to Oliver.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYes! Thanks to Oliver, I have definitely developed the skills more than enough to become a junior disciple. Master was also impressed.\u201d\u201cMaster?\u201d\u201cYeah, while he was checking the skills of the informal disciples earlier, he saw my skills had improved so much and asked what happened, I said that it was because of you, who helped me. He was very impressed.\u201dJoseph knew\u2026.At a glance, it doesn\u2019t sound like a serious thing, but Oliver had a bad feeling about it.He can\u2019t say for sure, but he had a very uncomfortable feeling.Joseph once said that his goal was to train powerful warlocks but the disciples here are not educated properly.Oliver had a feeling of discomfort seeing the disciples fight and check each other, but unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t say anything concretely.In the midst of such anguish, Marie said one more thing.\u201cI have one more piece of good news. I\u2019m not quite sure yet, but I think the news was pretty certain.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI think Oliver might become Master\u2019s direct disciple.\u201dA sudden news surfaced that Oliver, a junior disciple, might become a direct disciple, a position held by Andrew, circulated in the family.But looking back, it wasn\u2019t that strange.A few days ago, the fight with the wizards was so fierce that the battle exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations, as the pharmacist, Joseph, Anthony, and the Dominic family all suffered considerable damage.It reminded once again just how strong the wizards were, especially the ones who used lightning magic, who went back and forth while dealing a lot of damage to everyone.Right now, the Joseph family alone has lost a lot of the senior and intermediate disciples that the family worked hard to raise, while Andrew, the second-in-command of the family was seriously injured.According to the survivors, it would not be strange for them to have got wiped out.However, only one person, Oliver, was able to win against the wizards miraculously, which allowed Oliver\u2019s presence to impress everyone beyond the family.Everyone thought that soon Oliver might replace the injured Andrew.Looking at Oliver lost in thought, Marie asked with an incomprehensible expression.\u201cAren\u2019t you happy? If you were to become the master\u2019s direct disciple, you can receive education directly from the master at any time and use the study.\u201d\u201c\u2026No. I\u2019m indeed happy. But, I think other intermediate and senior disciples would start to hate me because of it.\u201d\u201cHaha, what are you saying\u2026Of course, they don\u2019t like when others barge in, but you are an exception. You have become so powerful, while Andrew\u2019s faction is almost wiped out.\u201dYes. Most of the warlocks who died during the battle with the wizard were Andrew\u2019s supporters.Andrew brought almost all of his supporters just to get rid of Oliver but unfortunately, it turned out to be a poisonous move and he ended up losing everything in an instant.Well, even if some supporters did remain, does it mean anything?Andrew, the core member of the faction had already lost one arm and was lying on the floor with burns all over his body.Recalling that fact, Marie said.\u201cActually, there is no one left in the family who can keep Oliver in check now. You are the only disciple who is eligible for the vacant direct disciple position when judging from your skills and merit. So Congratulations.\u201dMarie rejoiced as if it was her own business.Her attitude was a surprise to Oliver, but he didn\u2019t bother to ask.He wasn\u2019t particularly curious, and then there was no conspiracy or scheme in her emotions.So Oliver asked another question.\u201cMarie, can I ask you something?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026? Ah, yes! Please ask me. I will tell you anything I know.\u201d\u201cMarie, you said that you came here six years ago. Is that right?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d\u201cAt that time who was the direct disciple?\u201d\u201cAndrew. Why do you ask?\u201d\u201cWell, I was just curious. Then, was Andrew the direct disciple from the beginning?\u201d\u201cWell? I don\u2019t know\u2026..because I\u2019ve never been curious about it.\u201d\u201cThen, among the other disciples, was there anyone who suddenly disappeared?\u201d\u201cUh-huh\u2026 maybe you can find some if you look for it. There are people who sometimes steal what they need or steal some money and then run away.\u201d\u201cDid you see it yourself?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI mean running away.\u201d\u201cNo, they were running away, would they tell anyone if they were going to run away?\u201d\u201cWell, I guess not.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksMarie asked with an awkward smile as if she didn\u2019t understand what was going on.\u201cWhy are you asking such things?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 just curious.\u201dAfter that, some time passed.As Marie said, the vacancy was immediately filled after the battle against the wizard.Marie easily became a junior disciple, and Peter also rose from the Room Leader position to become an intermediate disciple.They were all delighted.However, Oliver did not become a direct disciple as Marie predicted.Instead, he skipped the intermediate disciple rank and went straight up to a senior disciple rank.This was also exceptional treatment, and no one objected nor was dissatisfied with this decision.Looking at the talents and achievements that Oliver had shown so far, it was not strange to make him a Senior disciple.Rather, those who were hostile or jealous disappeared, and those who tried to impress Oliver began to appear, even Andrew\u2019s men joined them.Although Andrew was still alive, he has already lost one of his arms and had suffered severe burns all over his body.Even the illegal healer said that he did everything he had to save Andrew\u2019s life but Andrew had to live the rest of his life in pain.So, despite the slight bruise of self-esteem among the disciples, they approached Oliver with a trembling heart to cling to the future power.\u201cI will do this.\u201dA man said with a heavy grin to Oliver, who is currently working on steam extraction of medicinal herbs.It was a basic task of mixing herbs, scooping water, and checking temperature according to a set ratio, but Oliver said he would do it all by himself.Although it was the job of intermediate disciples, Oliver did it because he knew that there would be no problems in the future if he had learned the basics.Oliver, who has been sweating after a long time due to physical exertion, spoke.\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d\u201cHaha, though\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine.\u201dWhen Oliver refused, the man trembled as he stepped back with a bewildered expression on his face.He tried his best to pretend that he was fine, but his emotions kept staggering.\u201cHehe, then, if you need any help, call me anytime.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dOliver replied mechanically.When the interrupter disappeared, Oliver started his work again.After extracting the medicinal herbs, a new medicinal herb was placed on the net, and when the water was lowered to a certain level, the separately heated water was emptied.The water temperature was also measured in the middle, and Oliver checked the condition every 30 minutes.It was a simple procedure but it demands diligence.\u201cDo you really have to do this work?\u201dPeter came quietly and asked.Oliver answered while looking at the concentration of the herbal extract.\u201cYes.\u2026\u2026 Do you have anything to say?\u201d\u201cAh, yes, that\u2026 Master is calling you.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOliver tilted his head.He can\u2019t believe that Master is calling someone who has been working while knowing how tight a Warlock\u2019s schedule is.It was impossible for him not to leave, so Oliver nodded his head once and headed to the master\u2019s room.\u201cOh, wait a minute.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou should go to Andrew\u2019s room instead of going to the Master\u2019s room since he is now there. And while you go, I will take care of here.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, I got it.\u201dOliver answered without thinking and went to Andrew\u2019s room.Oliver reached Andrew\u2019s private room which has now effectively become a hospital room, and when the door was opened, the characteristic musty smell of the patient rushed out.\u201cYou are here?\u201dAs soon as Oliver entered, Joseph, who was taking care of Andrew, spoke.\u201cYes, I heard you called me Master.\u201d\u201cYeah. Is the job you are doing worth it?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s fun.\u201dOliver was sincere.It was a joy for Oliver to learn the process of making the portion step by step.\u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re sincere. Actually, that\u2019s a good attitude. But unlike you, some children are frightened. In fact, that\u2019s what happens normally when a warlock meets a wizard in person.\u201d\u201c..can I ask you a question, Master?\u201d\u201cSure, Ask me.\u201d\u201cBefore in our conversation. I think you said that black magic was stronger than Real magic\u2026 Then, there is nothing to be afraid of Real magic, right?\u201dJoseph raised one corner of his mouth.\u201cYou may look dumb, but you\u2019re sharp in some weird ways. Yeah, I said that when I first brought you here. Actually, such a warlock does exist. Like the Piper or the Chef\u2026 However, there are many cases where this is not the case. Do you know why?\u201d\u201cno.\u201d\u201cIt was because wizards are systematically educated with great resources, whereas warlocks grow themselves in the shadows. So the average level of a warlock was lower than that of a wizard.\u201d\u201cYes, I remember. That\u2019s the reason why the Master took me in.\u201d\u201cYou remember well. To be precise, I brought you and the other talented children. I also heard from the other children. They said you defeated all the wizards by yourself, is that true?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I just got lucky.\u201d\u201cIf you knocked down a wizard who made Andrew like this just by relying on luck, then that luck is indeed a skill.\u201dFor a moment, Oliver saw Andrew, who was suffering from burns.\u201c\u2026can\u2019t it be cured?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you heal Andrew with the Life-force?\u201d\u201cIt can be done in normal cases, it is used at the level of energy recovery and treating minor trauma. It is difficult to treat such a serious injury. And, that\u2019s not my area of specialization. That\u2019s also the reason why I called you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, Master?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to take Andrew to Landa. There are wizards out there who specialize in healing and I know someone who will heal Andrew.\u201d\u201cah\u2026.\u201dA healing wizard, Andrew, who stored the information in his head exclaimed.\u201cIf I go there with Andrew, I will be away for a while. In the meantime, you will have to manage the family for me.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dOliver asked again with a completely unexpected remark.\u201cWhy? It\u2019s one of the roles of the direct disciple. Managing the family while I\u2019m away.\u201d\u201cBut master\u2026\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI cherish Andrew, but because of me, he is no longer the direct disciple. In terms of skills and performance, you are the direct disciple at this moment. The reason why I haven\u2019t officially revealed it is because you are straightforward.\u201dOliver had a lot to ask, but Oliver didn\u2019t dare to ask, because his instinct said it would not be safe.\u201cI heard you taught Marie. Like that, you can control the children well. Would you like to take care of the family while I\u2019m away?\u201dOliver answered.\u201cIf it\u2019s Master\u2019s order. I will\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Oliver opened his eyes.He looked at the clock and it was the same time as usual.The only difference was that he was in a private room provided to senior disciples, so there were no other people around.It was pleasant and quiet, something everyone in the family would dream of, unfortunately, Oliver didn\u2019t find much joy in this room.Of course, it could not be denied that it was warmer and more comfortable to live in, but it was Oliver\u2019s personal experience that was not enough.Just being a senior disciple means he had to stay here according to the rules.Sometimes he even thought that the dormitory where several people lived was better.At least there, as soon as he woke up, he could see various emotions, so he wasn\u2019t bored.Until a few days ago, this kind of regret was evident, but not now.Now when he puts strength in his eyes, he was able to see the emotions of the people in the other room through the wall, even though it was faint.His eyes started to grow stronger during the few days of rest after returning from a battle against the wizard.At first, it was like there was someone beyond the wall, but after the departure of Joseph, it got stronger.He wondered if he could only read the emotions that are near him, but now he can cross several walls and briefly read the emotions of people in other rooms.This kind of change was completely unexpected, but it was so interesting that Oliver woke up every morning and focused his attention on observing the emotions of others.It was fun to use this power, and the more he practiced, the better his eye\u2019s ability seems to get.As his eyes grew tired, Oliver rubbed his eyes.That\u2019s all for today.After relaxing his eyes, Oliver got up, washed up in the sink installed on one side of the room, and took out the wizard\u2019s diary that he kept under the bed.As a senior disciple, he was excluded from chores such as cleaning, so he had more time in the morning.He had read this book several times already, but he still continued to read this diary, remembering the faint but beautiful light he had seen at that time.He wondered if he could get any clues.\u2026\u2026.KNOCK KNOCKOliver raised his head. A voice came through the door.\u201cAh, Senior Oliver?\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s meal time\u2026We have to go to work right after the meal. Is there anything wrong?\u201dOliver checked his watch.It was literally meal time.He didn\u2019t notice the passage of time because he was looking at the diary, but he quickly put the diary under the bed and replied politely.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, yes, thank you.\u201dThe voice behind the door spoke in a flustered manner.The owner of the voice was a senior disciple who had dissatisfaction and jealousy toward Oliver, but he still supported Oliver well because he feared him even more.Oliver soon got dressed, walked out the door, and ate, then he immediately assigned people from the production to delivery.The junior disciples were entrusted with the tasks of breaking cigarettes, collecting tobacco, and finally collecting the empty cigarettes in a barrel, while the intermediate disciples worked on the primary and secondary distillation.Lastly, the process of completely merging emotions into the herbal extract was left to the senior disciples, and Oliver took part in making the secondary distillate, which was carried out by the intermediate disciples.The intermediate disciple he was working with suddenly spoke.\u201cI will do these chores.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m doing this because I want to. I\u2019ve become a senior disciple, but I\u2019m not completely familiar with this job\u2026 Will me doing this disturb your work?\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s question, the intermediate disciple widened his eyes and shook his head and hands.\u201cNo, no\u2026! It\u2019s not a disturbance. It\u2019s just that\u2026 I felt sorry for Senior Oliver, who was taking care of the family on master\u2019s behalf.\u201dOliver looked at the intermediate disciple\u2019s feelings.There was a mixture of fear and discomfort, but to some extent what he said was true\u2026Oliver saw a group of junior disciples working on the ground, the intermediate disciples extracting distillate, and a senior disciple casting black magic on the distillate that had been processed.\u201cI won\u2019t disturb you anymore. Then\u2026\u201dOliver continued his work while suddenly asking a question to the intermediate disciple.\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\u201cYes!?\u201dThe Intermediate disciple exclaimed loudly, wondering if he had done something wrong, he was frightened, but Oliver asked, gesturing that it was okay.\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cWhat? Question?\u201d\u201cYes, A question.\u201d\u201c\u2026. I will try my best to give you an answer.\u201d\u201cHow did you end up here?\u201dAfter that, Oliver helped various people with their tasks in the production of distillate, and secretly asked questions one by one to the people responsible for those tasks.How did you come to this place and how was your life before coming here?Oliver himself didn\u2019t know the reason behind these questions.If he had to explain it, he could only say it was his gut feeling.Oliver thought if he were to listen to other people\u2019s stories, maybe he\u2019ll be able to get a better understanding of the Diary of the Lightning Wizard.Most of them were wary of Oliver\u2019s sudden question, but Oliver did not force them to answer, and just asked them to speak comfortably.Most of them had no choice but to speak to Oliver since he held the title as Joseph\u2019s proxy while their backgrounds were both unfavorable and poor.Thus, it was normal for them to answer.Oliver listened to the stories of many people while he immersed himself in the work, till the work was almost finished.Oliver looked at the document about the target and looked at the finished cigarette packet in front of him.Most of the emotions were well absorbed, but some of them appeared to be in poor condition.\u201cThis and this. And that and that were of relatively inferior quality, is it okay?\u201dOliver\u2019s question was answered by an assistant senior disciple.\u201cWhich one are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThat, that, that and that and that.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dAs the senior disciple answered, he picked up the pack of cigarettes Oliver had pointed out and took a closer look.It didn\u2019t seem like everyone could see it as easily as Oliver, but the senior disciple who had completed the confirmation opened his mouth.\u201cI think it will be fine.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s thoughtless question, the senior disciple swallowed his saliva.\u201cUh\u2026 Yes, it is inevitable that the quality will deteriorate a bit during the work process. Master said that this level was okay.\u201dWhen the disciple spoke about Joseph, Oliver immediately stopped asking.If Joseph said it was okay, then it wasn\u2019t an issue anymore.Of course, he was personally a little bit dissatisfied, since he didn\u2019t like to sell something like that as a product that didn\u2019t perfectly permeate with emotions?It\u2019s such a shame that he couldn\u2019t finish the job properly.No, to be exact, the product he now produced was not up to his satisfaction.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksIt was a strange thing at first, but after he understood the process of making it and the principle of making it, there were doubts in his mind.He thought that he could make a better product if he were to make a few changes to the way they were producing.What if you mix more emotions?For example, You can maximize the product\u2019s potential even more by mixing different emotions.If we do that, we can make a product that is much better than the product produced with a lower-grade emotion.The Senior disciple, who saw Oliver indulging in daydreaming like that, said.\u201cSenior\u2026 Oliver?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cCan we wrap it up like this?\u201d\u201cAh, yes, I think you should.\u201dAs soon as permission was given, the senior disciple ordered to put the cigarette packs into the box, and the junior disciple picked up five or six packs of cigarette packs and put them in the box one by one.\u201cIf this is the case, will we be able to meet the delivery date without problems?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019ll not be late, so I think we can finish it leisurely.\u201dAt that answer, Oliver nodded with satisfaction.He didn\u2019t want to act as Joseph\u2019s representative, but he wanted to carry out his assignment without any problems.There were also issues about his relationship with Joseph and black magic studies, but he had made a promise anyway.\u201cI think Senior Oliver can rest now.\u201d\u201cOh, is that okay?\u201d\u201cYeah, as I said before, as master\u2019s representative you only need to do this.\u201dOliver nodded and replied.\u201cYes, I understand. Then please clean the rest up.\u201dAs Oliver was about to leave, suddenly a senior disciple asked a question.\u201cSenior Oliver, if it\u2019s okay with you, can I ask you something?\u201d\u201c\u2026what is it?\u201dOliver looked closely and asked, and the senior disciple replied with a slight sign of discomfort.\u201cAh, it was nothing, you asked other people how they got here today, can I ask why?\u201d\u201c\u2026Why are you curious about that?\u201d\u201cAh, there had been no person who asked that kind of question\u2026 so I got curious.\u201dHis emotions staggered while he spoke.It was a lie.Why was he lying?Oliver instinctively knew.Perhaps, he wanted to report it to Joseph.Oliver\u2019s actions seemed contradictory in a place where everyone seems to believe in Joseph.Oliver replied.\u201cI was just curious.\u201d\u201cah\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard once about how Marie and Peter got here, and I just got curious and asked others how they got here.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 is that so.\u201dThe senior disciple nodded his head as if he understood roughly.Soon, Oliver asked.\u201cDo you have any more questions?\u201d\u201cNo, no, no. Sorry to bother you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. If you need anything, please ask me.\u201dAfter saying that, Oliver headed to his private room.The stories of the Lightning Wizard and the disciples had some similarities.A chance during an unfortunate past.Oliver was not particularly surprised because he knew there were some similarities.Then there was a question.Even though they had a similar past, why did the Warlocks not emit the same light as the Lightning Wizard when he died?Recalling stories about the past he had heard from others, Oliver tried to read the diary of the wizard once again.In the process, he did not know whether he would be able to find the difference between a wizard and a warlock, and he did not know whether he could find the cause of the beautiful light in that difference, so Oliver\u2019s interest grew more and more.\u2018If I could see that same light again\u2026\u2019\u201cOliver! Oliver!\u201dMarie knocked at the door and hurriedly called Oliver.Oliver slowly came back to his senses and asked what was going on.she answered\u201cI think you should come out now.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThe pharmacist \u2026 the pharmacist has arrived.\u201dWhen Oliver went up to the factory with Marie, he could see the pharmacist who had visited with his men.His half-striped gray hair and gilt-rimmed glasses seemed like his trademark.The pharmacist greeted Oliver as soon as he saw him.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you.\u201dOliver bowed his head politely and greeted him.\u201cHello, Mr. Pharmacist.\u201d\u201cYeah, how are you? It seems like it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen you since you caught the raider. Are you okay?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, I just stopped by to check due to the delivery date. Where\u2019s Joseph?\u201d\u201cMaster has been away from work for a while. Now I am taking his place.\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s amazing. You are the youngest in terms of age and time, but you\u2019re given the position of Joseph\u2019s representative.\u201d\u201cI just got lucky.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s luck what you need these days.\u201dOliver tilted his head.He couldn\u2019t figure out why the pharmacist came.Obviously, he said he had come to meet Joseph due to the delivery date, but his gut feelings were telling him that it wasn\u2019t the truth.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euOliver threw the bait.\u201c\u2026the product is being manufactured smoothly, so you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad if that\u2019s the case, but I\u2019m a worried person, so can you show it to me for a moment?\u201dAt that moment, the pharmacist\u2019s emotions shone coldly, as if he had captured the prey.\u201c\u2026..Yes, I understand.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22The pharmacist left his men on the ground floor and went down to the basement alone.No\u2026 he wasn\u2019t alone.Oliver, Joseph\u2019s proxy guided him.As soon as they reached the workshop, Oliver opened the box of pilgarets that had been wrapped, while the Pharmacist checked the contents inside.\u201cUm, the production seems to be going smoothly as you said. You are managing things better than I thought.\u201d\u201cIt is because of everyone\u2019s hard work.\u201d\u201cEveryone? Oh, you mean the other disciples?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe pharmacist smiled a little.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. Those are some rare words from the mouth of a Warlock\u2019s subordinate. I\u2019ve never seen any warlock giving credit to his subordinate in such a polite manner.\u201dOliver didn\u2019t bother to answer.It\u2019s more of a habit than a courtesy. And Oliver knew it too.The pharmacist opened a pack and took out a Pilgaret.He looked at the pilgaret, which looked just like a regular cigarette that was sold in the market, and carefully put it on his nose and sniffed it.As the pharmacist\u2019s squishy nose inhaled, his cold eyes shined.Oliver simply observed the scene silently.It was a little interesting that one could check the quality of the pilgaret by smelling instead of seeing it with his eyes.\u201cUm, um. This time, the product is pretty good\u2026 I think it will work just fine in Landa. Do you know where these Pilgarets are sold?\u201d\u201c\u2026I heard that they were sold in other pharmacies and hospitals that do business with Mr. Pharmacists.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026You know. That\u2019s right, we mix it with other medicines and deliver them to the big hospitals and pharmacies in Landa. Your stuff is of good quality. They are mainly bought by high-profile, white-collar, high-income capitalists and artists. Isn\u2019t that funny? People over there see warlocks as the cancer of society, but they love the products you make more than anything else.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dOliver said as if he wasn\u2019t interested because he really wasn\u2019t interested\u2026Seeing Oliver\u2019s reaction, the pharmacist just smiled bitterly.\u201cYour reaction is dry. Do you have any questions? Like how we distribute this drug?\u201d\u201c\u2026Actually I want to ask you something else, can I ask you about it?\u201d\u201cSomething else? Tell me.\u201d\u201cCan you check the quality of a product just by smelling it?\u201d\u201cYeah. We don\u2019t have good eyesight like you guys. But, we can tell the quality of a product in other ways. Dealing with drugs is my job, so I have the ability to do that.\u201dOliver didn\u2019t show it, but he found it interesting.According to the pharmacist, the quality of pilgarets can also be distinguished by their smell. It was a skill Oliver wanted to have even though he doesn\u2019t need it right now.Oliver thought maybe he could smell the emotions.The pharmacist asked as if he noticed Oliver\u2019s thoughts.\u201cAre you interested in learning?\u201d\u201c\u2026.Yes.\u201d\u201cDo you really want to learn it? Our staff also know how to do this.\u201d\u2018Then please teach me.\u2019These words stopped at Oliver\u2019s throat.It was clear that he wanted to learn, but no matter how much he thought about it, it seems that the right thing was to first ask for Joseph\u2019s permission.The pharmacist said with a smile as if he understood.\u201cIf you can get Joseph\u2019s permission, then I will teach you.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cInstead, can you answer one of my questions?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not fair if you were to be the only one to get a favor? So let\u2019s go by the business rule of give and take.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Then what should I answer?\u201dThe pharmacist held up a pillgaret.\u201cDo you think this product is great? Be honest.\u201dThe pharmacist\u2019s eyes shone sharply, and the emotion that used to stumble slightly moved.\u201c\u2026Yes, it is. Master\u2019s products are the best. Didn\u2019t Mr. Pharmacist also say it\u2019s a good product?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026but, as a businessman, I also want to handle better products. Especially since the competition in this market is getting fierce these days.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 then let me ask about this to master.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right. I was just asking just in case\u2026 Anyway, do you really think it\u2019s a great one?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026Then let\u2019s go. I\u2019ve confirmed the production of the product, so I don\u2019t need to be here anymore. It was nice meeting you.\u201dThe pharmacist held out his hand.It was the first time someone had asked him for a handshake, so Oliver looked at that hand for a moment before holding it.The pharmacist with a smile that was the characteristic of a middle-aged man spoke.\u201cIt was nice meeting you. See you next time. If you ever need help, just tell me. I\u2019ll help you if I can.\u201dOliver looked straight at him and answered.\u201cYes, I will remember.\u201dAfter the pharmacist left, the time passed as usual again.Oliver got up early in the morning and would go to eat, then would work together with junior, Intermediate, and Senior disciples to make pilgarets.The production of pilgaret got finished without any setbacks as expected, and it was packaged and delivered to the pharmacist.With this, the most essential task that Joseph entrusted to Oliver was completed safely.From there on, everything went as usual while everyone was waiting for Joseph to return.Informal disciples grind meat to make sausages while the Junior, Intermediate, and Senior disciples studied black magic through self-study.It was very lax and inefficient in Oliver\u2019s view, but he didn\u2019t mind because he didn\u2019t have any powers.Above all, Oliver had his own work to do.\u201cUghhh\u2026\u2026!\u201dOliver groaned as if he had found something while looking through the diary.Marie, who was watching the figure from the side, asked.\u201cWhat happened, Senior Oliver?\u201d\u201cI think I finally found it.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe difference between us and the Lightning Wizard. It\u2019s true that both of us had a miserable past and wanted to have a better life, but the lightning wizard had another goal.\u201d\u201cwhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cAfter the wizard got kicked out by his family, he aimed to succeed in life, but the main reason was not to prove it to the family by succeeding in life. He wanted to succeed because of someone else. Her name is\u2026.. Rachel? To confess to this woman named Rachel, he wanted to succeed.\u201dSaying so, Oliver pointed to a paragraph in the diary.There were lines written about a woman named Rachel, the lightning wizard tried to hide it, but Oliver found the lightning wizard\u2019s strong affection for her\u2026 An obsession that went beyond affection towards her.Oliver hypothesized that a special emotion behind this simple relationship might be the source of the beautiful light shown by the Lightning Wizard.Oliver\u2019s mind spun quickly with numerous questions and answers \u2013 concluding that it was not just a materialistic wish, but a spiritual one, or something more, that gave birth to such a beautiful light.Marie asked a question.\u201cYou must have been quite impressed\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe light that the Lightning Wizard showed\u2026 You just keep looking for it.\u201dOliver answered without thinking.\u201cYeah, it was really beautiful.\u201dMarie\u2019s expression softened slightly.There was a slight tingle of jealousy formed in her.Oliver didn\u2019t understand the reason behind her jealousy, and honestly, he didn\u2019t even care.At that moment Marie spoke again.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not often that we get this kind of free time, and at a time like this, shouldn\u2019t you just go to the library and study about black magic?\u201d\u201cI can use the study only if I officially became a Direct disciple, but I\u2019m not a Direct disciple yet, and moreover, when the master is out traveling, even a Direct disciple can\u2019t enter the study, right?\u201d\u201cI know. But, Andrew and some other senior disciples often sneak in. So isn\u2019t it okay to enter if the master is not here?\u201dMarie\u2019s words were not wrong.Due to the nature of the family head who did not even provide proper education in the first place, the disciples thought that it would be better to accumulate knowledge somehow when the opportunity comes.But Oliver\u2019s reaction to this was different.\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m not interested, not because of the rules. Rather I\u2019m more interested in that light right now more than anything else.\u201dOliver spoke with a resolute tone and eyes.Marie\u2019s eyes widened as if she had committed a crime.\u201cAh\u2026sorry, I\u2019m really sorry. I didn\u2019t mean anything\u2026\u201d\u201cNo\u2026It\u2019s alright, by the way, can I ask you a question?\u201d,\u201cYes, anything.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s break time, so why are you here?\u201dOliver asked, out of curiosity.During personal maintenance time, it is normal to rest or study alone, and Marie, who had been working hard during recent practices didn\u2019t rest but kept staying beside Oliver, almost every day.\u201cUh, it was to help you if you ever need anything\u2026 After all, it was thanks to Senior Oliver, I became an official disciple, and I wanted to help you with anything\u2026 \u2026is that disturbing?\u201dMarie had a longing expression like a child looking for her mother.Oliver could catch a glimpse of how sad she felt while seeing her emotions, but unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t understand why.\u201cNo. If you want, you can stay.\u201dMarie smiled happily, like a child who was about to be abandoned, but not abandoned.Oliver turned his gaze and started reading the diary again, and soon began to formulate his own hypothesis in search of the source of the beautiful light that the Lightning Wizard showed before he died.When Marie saw Oliver\u2019s interest and desire for exploration, she suddenly remembered something.Marie opened her mouth.\u201cSenior Oliver?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWill my story be helpful?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYes, my story\u2026 I told you a little bit about it last time\u2026\u201dMarie said shyly.Oliver recalled the memories of that time\u2026.but, that\u2019s an old thing of the past.Compared to the beautiful light from the lightning wizard, Marie\u2019s story was comparatively inferior.\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to tell me\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026Just in case, if it helps\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s alright.\u201dOliver refused because he didn\u2019t want to waste his time on something he didn\u2019t care about right now.Marie put on a wounded expression again, and at that moment a knocking sound was heard from the door.KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK\u201cSenior Oliver?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dOliver, who was reading the diary and theorizing in his mind, asked.\u201cMaster has sent a letter to Senior Oliver.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.What?\u201dOliver stopped what he was doing and asked.A letter?Oliver took the envelope that had just arrived and looked at it.The envelope had a blue line on the border and had a stamp engraved with a woman in a crown in the upper right corner,There was the logo [The Great Empire Post Office] which was engraved underneath it.Oliver, who had never received a letter before, looked at the envelope for a while, then ripped it apart and pulled out a paper from inside, and started to read it.\u201c\u2026what happened?\u201dThe senior disciple who brought the letter asked.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWait.\u201dOliver read the letter again from the beginning to the end and after a long time, Oliver finally spoke.\u201cMaster wants me to come?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cMaster doesn\u2019t have enough money for Sir. Andrew\u2019s treatment, so he asked me to take some money and bring it to Landa.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23Oliver entered Joseph\u2019s room according to the contents of the letter.The room in the basement was the most luxurious room, and Oliver went to a place as mentioned as if he wasn\u2019t interested in anything else.Right next to the bed, there was a small group of drawers and a lamp that worked with magic stones.Oliver put away the lamp as the letter instructed, then with great effort pushed the chest of the drawers aside.There, Oliver saw a small safe stuck to the wall, just as mentioned in the letter.\u201cUm\u2026\u201dOliver pulled out the letter again and checked the password.\u201c4\u2026\u2026.7\u2026\u2026.8\u2026.1\u2026.2\u2026\u2026..2\u2026\u2026..1\u2026 \u2026.5 \u2026\u2026.\u201dThe dials were in the middle of the huge lump of iron that moved along with each other.There was a gap in the tightly locked safe, when Oliver pulled the door open, he could see three metal storage boxes piled up one after the other.Out of the three, Oliver grabbed the third numbered box.A storage box that came with a smooth finish as if painted with oil.It was so long that Oliver couldn\u2019t see the end of it, and the long storage box was tightly packed with bundles of large amounts of cash.A large amount of money that most people cannot accumulate in their lifetime was filled in just one box.However, Oliver wasn\u2019t even excited to see such a large sum of money, he just put the money in a prepared bag.\u201cThirty 100,000 bill bundles\u2026 One, two, three\u2026\u201dThe piles of money piled up gradually filled the bag.\u201c\u2026twenty-nine\u2026thirty.\u201dAfter taking the money, Oliver triple-checked the backpack, which became quite heavy.Oliver shoved the storage box back into the safe, then he closed the safe, and moved drawers and the magic stone lamp back into place.It was the same as the first time, and now he put the bag on his back, then tied the locking strap at the top, and went outside.As he went outside of the factory, Marie, Peter, and other disciples had gathered.\u201c\u2026what? Why is everyone together?\u201dOne of the senior disciples answered.\u201cAh, you are taking orders from the master, so it is only appropriate for everyone to come together to send you off\u2026.Are there any problems?\u201dOliver replied.\u201cNo, there isn\u2019t any\u2026\u201dAt that time, Marie approached cautiously and fixed the wrinkles on Oliver\u2019s coat.Then she carefully placed the newsboy cap over his head.\u201cIf you put this on, you won\u2019t stand out.\u201dOliver touched the hat once and nodded.Now it was the time to depart.\u201cFollow me. A truck is waiting in the front for you.\u201dThe truck was none other than the pharmacist\u2019s truck, and Oliver decided to ride in it since he was going to visit Landa.Oliver was just going to follow along, but he suddenly had a question and asked the disciples who came along with him.\u201cI have a question, can I ask?\u201cSure, what\u2026\u201d\u201cDoes Master always run errands for money like this?\u201dThe disciples who were standing, including the senior disciples, looked at each other.Everyone tilted their heads as if this was the first time.\u201c\u2026There wasn\u2019t. He usually takes as much money as he needs. If he really needs more money, he will tell us to send it through the bank or send it in a letter.\u201dThis was an unusual case.It was then another senior disciple spoke.\u201cBut in the first place, this kind of situation itself is a special, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t wrong.The reason Joseph left in the first place was to treat Andrew, who suffered a serious injury.The lack of money made sense, and it was impossible to send such a large amount through a bank or a letter.If you make a mistake, you might attract unwanted attention.Oliver moved again, somewhat convinced.\u201c\u2026I see. I\u2019ll go then. Goodbye.\u201d\u201cYes, goodbye.\u201d\u201cGoodbye.\u201dOliver went to the truck and waited at the front door.It was a six-wheeled truck that he rode when he went to fight a wizard which had a black Porter tent on the luggage compartment.Oliver stared blankly at the luggage compartment for a moment, not knowing how to climb.He was relatively short, and there was no place to put his legs.\u201cAre there any ladders?\u201d\u201cTake my hand.\u201dAn unknown voice replied to Oliver\u2019s question.Oliver looked up and saw a man within the luggage compartment.He held out his hand and spoke again.\u201cTake my hand.\u201dAs soon as Oliver took his hand as instructed, the man pulled Oliver up with great force.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while?\u201dSaid the man looking at Oliver.Oliver looked at his face and remembered the face in front of him.It was Employee A, a subordinate of the pharmacist.It was the man who was present in the truck along with Oliver when he went to fight the wizards.\u201cAh, hello.\u201dOliver greeted him as he recalled his memories.A smile appeared on the man\u2019s angular face, as he made a gesture to take a seat.\u201cSit. There aren\u2019t any places to sit because of the luggage.\u201dAs if to prove that, Employee A sat roughly on top of the piled-up luggage.Oliver also followed him and sat on one of the luggage.\u201cWow, that\u2019s really awkward.\u201dEmployee A looked at Oliver for a while and then spoke up.Oliver didn\u2019t understand what was awkward, but Employee A kept talking.\u201cAre you normally this quiet?\u201d\u201cYes. I don\u2019t talk unless I have something to say.\u201d\u201cwhy?\u201d\u201cThis way, I don\u2019t get hit by the supervisor.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 that\u2019s right. Most of the kids in your place are like that, aren\u2019t they? But isn\u2019t all that a thing of the past? After all, you are now the second-in-command of a Warlock organization, right?\u201d\u201cNo. The person second in command is still Sir. Andrew. He is currently receiving treatment.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t he going to be kicked out anyway? After all, he got beaten by a wizard while you won against the wizard? Isn\u2019t everything in the world of Warlocks based on skills?\u201d\u201c\u2026how do you know?\u201d\u201cWell, if you\u2019re in our organization, you will find it easy to get a little bit of information about you guys. Other than that, I also have a lot of experience traveling the world. I\u2019ve met a lot of people here and there.\u201dLooking at Employee A\u2019s emotions, what he said seemed to be true to some extent.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksAlthough there was a bit of bluff, it was within the acceptable range,\u201cAnd finally I settled in this town.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201c\u2026are you curious about that?\u201d\u201cA little.\u201d\u201cYou are a funny guy\u2026 Well, a lot of things happened here and there. I was getting old and I wanted to settle down somewhere a little safer. In that sense, I envy you.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cOh, seriously. Don\u2019t take me wrong because I don\u2019t have any ulterior motives. I survived because of you. When we were about to die, you saved us. If you hadn\u2019t come, we would have become prey to the wizards. Fortunately, that didn\u2019t happen.\u201dEmployee A\u2019s feelings were sincere.There was also a bit of envy.\u201cWhy are you jealous?\u201d\u201cKuk, are you kidding me?\u201dWhen Oliver didn\u2019t respond, Employee A frowned and asked.\u201cYou really don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026are you for real? Why are we envious of you geniuses? It\u2019s because of black magic.\u201d\u201cJust for that?\u201d\u201cYou punk! You\u2019re hitting on a sore spot! I\u2019ve personally seen how you fought. I even see you in my dreams every now and then. Dozens of black blades fell like rain and the whole area exploded. It was freaking cool. Isn\u2019t life way easier for you geniuses?\u201dOliver didn\u2019t react.No, it would be more correct to say that there is nothing to react to.The easy life of genius \u2013 to Oliver, these words didn\u2019t really mean anything.Because Oliver\u2019s greatest concern has always been survival, the only recent additions were black magic and the beautiful light and there was nothing else.Employee A\u2019s words about money or power did not impress Oliver.When Oliver didn\u2019t react, Employee A spoke in dismay.\u201cHa\u2026Is it what they call a genius\u2019s leisure? Or is that how genius was supposed to be?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honestly, I still don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2026. In short, are you saying that you are envious of me because of black magic?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026that\u2019s what it is. If I knew black magic I wouldn\u2019t bother carrying a gun around?\u201d\u201cThen, why don\u2019t\u00a0 Mr. Employee try learning black magic?\u201d\u201cEmployee? Oh, I still didn\u2019t tell you my name\u2026 By the way, what do you mean learning black magic? Do you think I have talent?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026.what\u2019s the meaning of learning if you don\u2019t have a talent?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that better than not learning it?\u201dOliver said these words without much thought, but at those words, Employee A\u2019s eyes widened slightly and he gave a strange smile.\u201cWhy? Would you teach me?\u201d\u201cIf Master allows it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..Are you serious?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. Warlocks and Wizards generally don\u2019t teach their knowledge to others, as they only like to suck on the blood of ordinary people.\u201d\u201d Oh, there\u2019s also a condition.\u201d\u201cOf course, of course. What is it?\u201d\u201cWhen we first met, I thought you knew a lot about wizards, can you teach me what you know about them?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAbout the Wizards\u201d\u201cNo, no, no. I heard what you said. Do you mean it? You\u2019re not kidding?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dEmployee A stared at Oliver, then said seriously.\u201cI only know a little bit more about wizards than other people.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Some stories you heard will also do.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay. Let\u2019s talk more about it later.\u201dOliver nodded his head.Employee A then nodded with a strange expression on his face.\u201cCome look, your destination has arrived.\u201dOlive didn\u2019t know how many hours had passed when Employee A said while raising the tent slightly.Between the slight opening of the tent, the background of Landa came into view, and Oliver took a closer look at it while trying to adapt to the new environment.The first thing he saw was a big road that was filled with cars.It was so glorious and so humongous that it could not be compared to Wineham.And the difference did not end there.Airships flew casually in the sky, and there were strangely many people moving under the tall and huge building.Compared to this the quiet wineham was like a den of cockroaches.Compared to the people in Weinham who wear only normal tops and pants, the people here were wearing very colorful clothes.A man in a cape wearing a silk hat, a man with goggles in the place where his eyes should be, a woman with a mechanical arm on one side, a woman in tight-fitting clothes that showed off her bosom, and a man with a cross on his back.It was a completely different world.\u201cYou look surprised.\u201dEmployee A spoke softly as if guessing roughly what Oliver was thinking.\u201cYes\u2026there are a lot of people.\u201dOliver said, looking at the place filled with lights everywhere.\u201cOf course. This city is a city that has grown rapidly by consuming the many cities and rural areas around it.\u201cDo you know this place well?\u201d\u201cWell, I used to live here.\u201d\u201cHmm.. then\u2026\u201dAs Oliver was about to ask more, the truck stopped and they heard a voice from the driver\u2019s seat.\u201cCome on, we have arrived. Get off.\u201d\u201cHey, I guess it\u2019s time for us to part,\u201d said Employee AIt was a bit disappointing but Master\u2019s job was the first priority, so Oliver nodded too.As he was about to get off the truck, Employee A reached out and said.\u201cI wasn\u2019t bored on the way here. I want to continue our conversation later.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, thank you for taking care of me.\u201dOliver answered, cupping his hands.As Oliver tried to let go of his hand after the handshake, Employee A grabbed Oliver\u2019s hand again and said,\u201cOh, by the way, my name is not Mr. Employee, it\u2019s James. Call me James from now on.\u201d\u201cUh, yes.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThen tell me your name.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI know your name, but I want to hear it from you\u2026 What is your name?\u201dOliver looked at James\u2019 face for a while before answering.\u201cOliver.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Oliver got off the truck and walked straight along the yellow exterior wall, as the letter said.Thanks to this, he was able to not waste time wandering in an unfamiliar environment.After a while, he was able to see a huge square with a fountain built in the middle.A baby angel statue was peeing in the middle of a large fountain, and around it were benches, hot dog booths, and ice cream booths.The visitors were elders, women, and children, and there seemed to be no threat.After looking around, Oliver went near Exit 3, as written in the letter.Even though he was walking, Oliver did not stop looking around, and the place looked completely different from Wineham.It wasn\u2019t just the crowd or the flashy colors.More than that, the emotions of the people were also different.In Wineham, negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, anger, sadness, and hatred were predominant.But in contrast, at least in the square here, there were more positive emotions in people\u2019s minds, such as relaxation, serenity, kindness, and mercy.Sometimes it felt like an emotion of profound superiority, and when viewed as a whole, it was much brighter.Oliver wondered what was the difference between this place and Wineham and what was the reason behind people\u2019s emotional states being so different.And what was even more interesting than this was the other side of the city which was not far from here was exuding more negative emotions than Wineham.Oliver couldn\u2019t see the details with his eyes right now, but he could feel them vaguely.There was a feeling of darkness that was incomparable with Wineham.Although there was a wall, it was definitely the same city, and there was such a huge difference like light and shade.\u201cHere you are?\u201dWhile observing the city, Oliver turned to one side and bowed his head politely.Standing in front of him was Joseph in a flashing silk hat and cloak.They were very similar to the people of Landa, and Oliver probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed if he had distinguished people by appearance rather than emotions.Joseph was amazed.\u201cYour eyesight has become sharper?\u201d\u201cThank you for the compliment, Master.\u201d\u201cMoney?\u201dOliver patted the bag firmly behind his back.Joseph laughed and started walking with Oliver.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was originally careful not to run money errands like this, but this time the situation is special.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 by the way, can I ask you a question, Master?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhere is Sir. Andrew?\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026he\u2019s being treated right now. It\u2019s not legal, it requires a lot of money, but it\u2019s from a warlock who possesses great skills.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dOliver answered while looking at Joseph\u2019s feelings to see whether he was lying.It staggered as if he was lying but soon it stopped.Oliver frowned at the rare sight he saw for the first time, and at that moment, Joseph brought his face closer to Oliver and said,\u201cFor now, let\u2019s go to the hotel.\u201d\u201cHotel\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah, hotel. It\u2019s a very nice place.\u201dJoseph\u2019s words were not a figure of speech or a metaphor.They went to a huge hotel near the square.The hotel was large and splendid, and there were a lot of wealthy-looking people, and the word [Bluemoon] was written on the front door in an old-fashioned way.Joseph seemed familiar with this place, the hotel gatekeepers, bellboys greeted Joseph warmly as soon as they saw him.\u201cHello, Mr. John.\u201d\u201cHello, Mr. John.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dOliver looked at them without saying a word, and Joseph turned his head and looked at Oliver.\u201cAre you surprised?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI asked if you were surprised that I was used to such an expensive hotel.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026not at all.\u201d\u201cHuh, Really? To be frank, I myself was surprised. The reason I\u2019m used to this is because of my regular visits to Landa when looking for disciples. And I used to stay here every time I visited. Do you know why I stay here?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Because it\u2019s great?\u201d\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s not entirely wrong, but it\u2019s not entirely correct either.\u201cIt\u2019s because I have bad memories in this place.\u201d\u201c\u2026Bad memories?\u201d\u201cYeah, really bad ones\u2026 Well, hold on for a second.\u201dJoseph said, stopping in front of the iron gate.There was a large needle and numbers embedded on the wall above the iron gate, and the direction the needle pointed changed from 6 to 5, and then to 4, 3, 2, 1.DINGWhen the \u2018ding\u2019 sound was heard the iron gate opened automatically revealing a small space where there was a bellboy standing.\u201cWelcome. Sir. What floor would you like me to take you to?\u201d\u201cPlease go to the third floor. Jackson, the gloves look cool. Did you get new ones?\u201d\u201cYes. Thanks for the compliment, Sir. John.\u201dJoseph brought Oliver inside.When the bellboy pressed the button next to the door, the door closed and the space began to move.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an elevator. It\u2019s safe, so don\u2019t worry. Isn\u2019t that right Jackson?\u201d\u201cYes, of course, Sir.\u201dAfter a while, the elevator stopped and the door opened.Joseph took out a bill from his pocket and gave it to the bellboy and took Oliver to his room.Oliver got distracted as soon as he entered the room, and Joseph spoke at that moment.\u201cFirst of all, let me check if the errand was carried out well? Put your bag here.\u201dJoseph pats the table.Oliver took off the bag as instructed and placed it on the nearby table.Joseph opened the bag and took out bundles of money one by one, then he began to stack them on the table.\u201c\u2026twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, 30 bundles of 100,000 Landan bills. You bought the exact amount.\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201d\u201cYou did a great job. There aren\u2019t many kids who can do this kind of errand.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, bills have magical powers. When they pile up in bulk, it clouds their thinking abilities. It might make you end up unhappy.\u201dOliver tilted his head, not understanding.\u201c\u2026\u2026What kind of black magic is it, Master?\u201d\u201cBlack magic? Ha\u2026well, it\u2019s similar to Black Magic.\u201dOliver tilted his head again.The conversation was subtly out of focus, and Oliver didn\u2019t dig deep into it.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksOliver paused for a moment, then opened his mouth carefully.\u201cMaster. Then, is my work over here?\u201dOliver asked Joseph who was putting the money back into the bag.\u201cFor now? Why?\u201d\u201cThen, can I go back?\u201d\u201cWhy? Why are you trying to go back already?\u201d\u201d I thought it would be inconvenient for Master if I stayed without anything to do, Or, is there anything for me to do here, Master?\u201d\u201cYeah, of course, there is. I\u2019m going to pick up Andrew tomorrow and I need someone to help me.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll stay.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026but before that, there\u2019s one more thing I need you to help with.\u201d\u201cTell me, Master.\u201d\u201cYou should have a grand dinner with me today.\u201dThose words were not a figure of or a metaphor.In the evening, Joseph bought Oliver a decent suit, and he was taken to a restaurant.Then they sat down together in the best seat overlooking the beautiful scenery outside.\u201cYou look pretty good when you dress up like this. Is it uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cSlightly.\u201dOliver answered, glancing at the suit he wore for the first time.It wasn\u2019t really that uncomfortable, but it felt like his posture was restricted according to the clothes.\u201cI\u2019m glad that\u2019s the case\u2026Ah, Just bring me the usual, Joey.\u201dAfter ordering the Waiter, Joseph looked back at Oliver.The two looked at each other silently, and after a while, Joseph opened his mouth.\u201cOh my gosh\u2026Why are you so quiet today? Even when we first met, you kept on asking a lot of questions.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Master. I was so excited back then.\u201d\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m not scolding you, I\u2019m just asking if you have anything to say. When you\u2019re alone with me, you can say anything. Ask a question or even flattery will do\u2026\u201dOliver recalled the children who used to flatter the supervisor in the mines in the past.\u201cToday, Master\u2026 you look cool?\u201d\u201cMy head\u2019s spinning. I\u2019m not really asking you to flatter me. Also, why did you ask with a question mark at the end?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, master.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026really, ask me anything. For example, when I brought you to the family, why did I just leave you as an informal disciple? Although you didn\u2019t ask this, hasn\u2019t this always been in your heart?\u201d\u201cI think there must be a deep \u2026 meaning.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s how flattery works. And you\u2019re right\u2026 Come to think of it, I never really gave you a proper class since there was a lot of work. Thinking that I have prepared this place today, so answer me. What do you think is the basic qualification for being a warlock?\u201dOliver was lost in thought when asked a sudden question.The qualification\u2026It was a difficult question for Oliver, who easily became a Warlock.\u201cAspiration.\u201d\u201cRight!\u201dJoseph said while snapping his fingers.\u201cIt\u2019s the aspiration. The reason doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 Whether it\u2019s a desire for money, power, or black magic. A desire for something. That\u2019s the greatest quality of a Warlock.\u201d\u201c\u2026if so, then why did you take in Marie and Peter?\u201d\u201cWhy? Did you hear something?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I just happened to hear it.\u201dJoseph leaned thoughtfully on the back of his chair.\u201c\u2026I remember. Marie lived in a place where the filth of a dye mill was pouring out. She almost got herself raped when I first met her?\u201d\u201cWas she scared?\u201d\u201cYeah, they were neighborhood thugs. I was just passing by, so I saved her. At that time, the poison in her eyes was impressive. She didn\u2019t have much talent, but she had a great desire for power, so I bought her.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dOliver said numbly.Joseph spoke again as if lost in memory.\u201cPeter lived in a single room with three other family members besides his family, and every day was hell. Thanks to that, he had a great desire for success and he also had some talent, so I took him in.\u201dOliver nodded and asked.\u201cThen\u2026 Are the other disciples also similar?\u201d\u201cYes. The more desperate they are, the more eager you are to learn black magic and the more you can immerse yourself in it\u2026. But you lacked that.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cA desire for black magic. You thought it was fun and was willing to learn, but you thought nothing more. What can I say\u2026 There was no other way. So I put you in as an informal disciple. I thought you might fall into despair when you got pushed around. But, it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\u201cSorry for my incapability, Master. I will study hard.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026.., if Andrew returns and asks you for the position of Direct Disciple again, are you planning on offering it?\u201d\u201cYes, all I need is to learn black magic\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. A warlock is all about power. Power is Absolute. A person who easily yields his place to others, no matter how talented he is, he will soon be eaten.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did Master become a warlock that way?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. I asked a question without permission\u2026 I was curious.\u201d\u201cDid you ask how I became a warlock?\u201d\u201cYes, please forgive me if I made a mistake, Master.\u201d\u201cWell, not to that extent\u2026 Actually, Like you, I was picked up by my master and I became a warlock.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah. I learned how to run a family from my master. And at first, I wasn\u2019t a very enthusiastic disciple. I was satisfied in life without begging or stealing.\u201d\u201cthen\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause I got to see a wider world. That\u2019s right, this hotel.\u201dJoseph exaggeratedly stretched out his hands and pointed to the hotel.\u201cWhen I came to this hotel while helping my master, it was the first time I knew that there were such wonderful places in this world. And I also learned a sad fact.\u201d\u201cWhat is that Master?\u201d\u201cIf I live like this, neither during this life nor after death, I would never be able to taste this world\u2026.So I tried to become a capable warlock like my Master, this is how I became a great warlock.\u201d\u201cThen, Master must have developed a passion for black magic after coming to this hotel.\u201d\u201cYes! That\u2019s right. I decided to become a great warlock by any means. And, God helped me.\u201dIt was ironic.Oliver wondered how God helped Joseph to become a warlock.\u201c\u2026if it\u2019s okay with you, may I ask how your master taught you?\u201dAt that moment, Joseph\u2019s emotions flickered as if that question stabbed him at his sore spot.\u201cthat\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou must have been waiting, Sir. The food has arrived.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euA waiter appeared just in time.He skillfully put down the plate.On a pure white plate, there was a dish of white fish with a dipping sauce, which smelled very good.Joseph patted his mouth.\u201cFirst eat, let\u2019s talk after eating, I\u2019m hungry.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25The next morning.After having breakfast with Joseph, Oliver went out of the hotel, changing into his plain and inconspicuous clothes.Oh, of course, he also brought the money bag along.Landa was full of people in the morning, and there were as many cars as people.\u201cThere are a lot of people here.\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s both an advantage and a disadvantage. Come on, follow me.\u201dJoseph took Oliver to the road.Joseph raised his hand, and within a few seconds, a yellow car that looked like a giant beetle stopped.There was a triangular marker on the top of the car, and on it was the phrase saying Dobb Taxi Association.\u201cGet in.\u201dJoseph opened the door and said.Oliver got into the car as directed, and Joseph closed the car door afterward.\u201cWhere can I take you, Sir?\u201dThe driver, dressed in a neat uniform, raised his hat slightly and asked.\u201cDistrict X\u2026 just go to the entrance.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about District X\u2026? Yes, I understand.\u201dA Darkness passed over the taxi driver\u2019s face for a moment, but soon he started driving the car without asking.As the car started moving and the landscape changed rapidly outside, Oliver looked outside for a moment and then asked Joseph.\u201cMaster. I\u2019m sorry to ask, but where are we going?\u201d\u201cWe are going to meet Andrew. It\u2019s a pretty interesting place.\u201dWhat Joseph said was not a lie.They rode in the car for a while, and as time passed the tall and long buildings started disappearing, and instead outdated streets appeared one after another.They had traveled farther from the place Oliver had entered the car, and the interesting thing is, the number of people Oliver saw kept increasing rather than decreasing as they moved farther.The car soon stopped.The driver in the uniform turned his head toward Joseph and spoke politely.\u201cSir, this is the entrance to District X. I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t go any further than this.\u201d\u201cI know. It\u2019s hard to get here. This is the taxi fare, and this is for your tips.\u201dIn addition to the taxi fare, Joseph gave him a decent bundle of money.The taxi driver raised his hat saying thanks and went away as soon as Oliver and Joseph got off.Oliver vaguely seemed aware of the reason.Although the street looked lonely, there were people everywhere, and they all showed cunning and venomous emotions as if they were waiting for prey.Oliver knew, if he showed any weakness, he\u2019d become their next prey.\u201cMaster?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cIs this place also in Landa?\u201d\u201cYes. The high-ranking people in Landa don\u2019t even care about this place, but indeed, it\u2019s a part of Landa. They don\u2019t\u2026 Why did you ask?\u201d\u201c..I asked because I was curious.\u201dJoseph smiled mischievously.\u201cWhat are you curious about?\u201d\u201cIt is the same city, but the emotions of people here and there are very different.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that strange. After all, This is District X.\u201d\u201c\u2026.District\u2026..X?\u201d\u201cI will tell you on the way. First, let\u2019s get going.\u201dAfter saying that, Joseph began to walk and Oliver followed him.The street, where clumsy cement buildings and shanty houses are mixed together, was as complicated as a maze, with profanity and graffiti painted everywhere.A perfect place for rogues.Going deeper, Oliver saw more than simple graffiti, blood-drawn blasphemous graffiti, and there was also a totem made of animal bones and skins.\u201cMaster\u2026what is that?\u201dOliver asked while looking at the totem that had been erected in the middle of the street.It was made by weaving the skulls of a bird and a mouse.\u201cWell\u2026 It\u2019s also my first time seeing it, and it was probably made by a shaman or warlock who doesn\u2019t have much to do. Or the beggars could have made it as a threat.\u201d\u201c\u2026do you know this place, Master?\u201d\u201cOf course. I have visited here a few times due to business reasons. Above all, this is the place where I was born.\u201d\u201cah\u2026\u201dOliver groaned and nodded at the story he heard for the first time.\u201cThere are 26 Districts in Landa. And for convenience, they have divided them into A, B, C,\u2026etc. Now, say Oliver. Which District do you think is more prestigious?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know, Master?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s a problem that can be answered right away if you had known about Landa. Of course, the more prestigious District is A. The higher the District in alphabetical order the better security of the District. Of course, not all of them are like that, but overall it\u2019s the same.\u201dOliver nodded without saying a word.\u201cSo in other words, Districts like Z, Y, X, W, which are at the bottom of the alphabetical order, don\u2019t have proper security. What do you think?\u201dOliver looked around.As they went deeper, the streets seemed more and more outdated and dangerous. However, what bothered Oliver more was the dangerous emotions that he felt as he went deeper.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a little\u2026 Ominous.\u201d\u201cHaha! Do you think so?\u201d\u201c\u2026Then did you meet your master here, Master?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dJoseph\u2019s emotions twitched.It seemed like an unexpected question.\u201cUm, well, yes. He used to be a warlock here.\u201d\u201cAre there any warlocks in Landa?\u201d\u201cAre there any warlocks in Landa? That\u2019s a stupid question. This place has more warlocks than Wineham. Wineham has a single digit of warlocks even if you include everyone from the small warlock organization, but here, there will be a three-digit when you add up the warlocks that belong to the big organizations and the small organizations. No one knows how many warlock organizations are there in Landa. They are scattered all over the place.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201dOliver was intrigued by the new facts.If he thought about it, it wouldn\u2019t have been that strange.This land has far surpassed Wineham in every aspect, such as the size and development of the city, and the number of people.Rather, it would be strange if there were few warlocks.Oliver realized that the world was wide, and he was just a frog in a well.This simple fact gave Oliver great joy.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksHe had a lot to learn and a lot to explore, so how could it not be enjoyable?Oliver asked for more information.\u201cThen why did Master come to Wineham?\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026? It\u2019s honestly embarrassing to say this, but the competition here became too fierce.\u201d\u201cCompetition?\u201d\u201cAs I said before, there are a lot of warlocks in Landa, and that\u2019s why they fight with each other every day. A lot of warlock organizations form and disappear every day. It was that intense. So I was worried and I left to build up my own strength?\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019m a coward?\u201d\u201cNo, I think you are smart.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026thank you. Let\u2019s stop, we\u2019re here.\u201dJoseph stopped abruptly and said.The place Joseph stopped was in front of a fenced building, which looked like a building that used to be a hospital.\u201cAndrew is here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026it looks like a closed hospital, is it still in operation, Master?\u201d\u201cHalf right, half wrong. The building being closed is right, but someone else is running it. Come on, follow me.\u201dOliver followed Joseph through the side door behind the fence.\u201cIt\u2019s not that way, it\u2019s this way.\u201dJoseph called Oliver, who was on the way to the hospital.\u201cBut the hospital is over there\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe hospital is closed. The actual operating place is the warehouse over here.\u201dJoseph pointed to the large warehouse at the back of the hospital.Oliver followed Joseph there, and next to the warehouse was a large door leading to the basement.\u201cIs Sir. Andrew treated here?\u201d\u201cYeah, It\u2019s a little funny, right? A warlock treating people in a hospital.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026.\u201dCREAAAK\u2014\u2014\u2014As Joseph opened the heavy basement door, the sound of echoes could be heard from everywhere.Oliver went in first, then Joseph followed him, and there was no light, it was dark everywhere.At that moment, Joseph snapped his hand and the torch hanging on the wall got lit up.\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t it fascinating.\u2026. Master\u201d\u201c\u2026.what?\u201d\u201cYou said you were going to heal Sir. Andrew with black magic. I thought it would be impossible to heal with black magic because Master said that it would be difficult.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026was that fascinating.?\u201d\u201cYes. I thought that all Warlock organizations were similar to us.\u201d\u201cWell, it is true that there are many who are similar to us. However, the realm of Warlock is wide and deep, and the warlock shows different professions depending on their inclinations and talents.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOliver and Joseph continued to talk as they walked down the hall.\u201cActually, in terms of economic efficiency, it is best to make pilgarets or nutritional supplements using Life-force. The profit is high and the risk is surprisingly low.\u201d\u201cIs there a risk?\u201d\u201cYes, there are risks. From the government\u2019s point of view, we are people who shouldn\u2019t be left alone since we use other people\u2019s emotions and Life-force to make products. First of all, what we do is illegal. To them, we\u2019re subjects that are to be tracked down and eradicated\u2026 But, they don\u2019t try to corner us completely.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThere are many reasons, but if I were to pick the main one, they are consumers. Because the aftereffects and addiction of Pilgarets are incomparable to that of cigarettes. Even though the nutritional supplements are made from other people\u2019s Life-force, they are life-saving drugs for the Rich\u2026 So, on the surface, they do formal monitoring, but they have no intention of eradicating us.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dOliver was intrigued by the unexpected remark.Initially, he didn\u2019t think pilgerets or nutritional supplements would be illegal, and he was surprised to know that the surveillance was done only in name despite knowing it\u2019s illegal.The history of the world was as interesting as black magic.As Oliver walked, hearing the story from Joseph, he saw skeletons scattered across the hallway.It was rotten and had dark red flesh on the outside.\u201cAnd wherever you go, there are people with unique personalities. There are people who are far from efficiency, safety, and rationality. They don\u2019t just make drugs or nutritional supplements, they also work in other industries.\u201d\u201c Can you tell me more about it, Master?\u201dOliver asked as he looked at the growing number of skeletons.\u201cWell, first of all, there are people who were able to heal people like the warlocks here. There are also people who use Life-force for manipulation and creating diseases based on black magic. Surprisingly, there are also many high-ranking customers for these types of people. That makes them more profitable, and in some cases safer than us.\u201d\u201cIs there any other type of Warlocks, Master?\u201dBeyond a pile of skulls came a pile of half-corrupted corpses. It seemed that some time had passed, and the corpses were infested with maggots.\u201cThere are people who like fighting and live as mercenaries and solvers. If you have the skills, you can have a good income and safety, and you can also develop your skills quickly. No matter what, practical classes will always be the best.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026.\u201d\u201cCome on, turn right here.\u201dAt Joseph\u2019s words, Oliver went to the right of the hallway.As he went further, he found a large room.There were quite a few corpses piled up around the room, the brown and dry blood was scattered all over the walls, floors, and ceilings proving that they were all murdered here.But the most striking thing was the altar opposite to the door.Three rectangles and nine circles were carved on the altar that was stained with red blood.\u201cIs there any other type, Master?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cAre there any warlocks who have taken a different profession other than medicine or mercenary?\u201d\u201c\u2026there are some who make religions.\u201d\u201cReligion?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOliver asked as he approached the altar.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master. Can you explain it more in detail?\u201d\u201cCreating a religion for a Demon, worshiping that demon and offering tribute to that Demon\u2026 Unlike the previous examples, it is a very difficult and also a very dangerous profession.\u201d\u201cIf it is difficult and dangerous, why are they doing that, Master?\u201dOliver asked, checking the body lying on the altar.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe body was horribly dismembered.\u201cThe more dangerous a fruit is, the sweeter it is. The Demons are evil but at the same time they also give great blessings.\u201dOliver looked at the body lying on the Altar\u2026No, Oliver looked at the corpse of Andrew lying on the Altar and asked.\u201cIs that why you killed him, Master?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Oliver asked, raising Andrew\u2019s torso slightly.Maggots squirmed between the waist section that had been cut.Joseph was silent for a moment and then opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026are you curious?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026yes, it\u2019s okay if the master doesn\u2019t want to say anything.\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s outrageous remarks, Joseph laughed silently, then spoke.\u201cYou are half right and half wrong. I killed Andrew to obtain the Demon\u2019s blessing, but it wasn\u2019t just for that. He\u2026offended me.\u201d\u201cOffended you?\u201d\u201cYeah, it was very unpleasant. Despite the fact that I was there, he thought of my organization as his own and\u2026 as if that was not enough, he created his own group and dared to challenge my authority. It\u2019s very unpleasant.\u201dOliver nodded.Oliver knew to some extent that Andrew had those thoughts.\u201cI see\u2026.\u201dOliver put Andrew\u2019s body back on the Altar. The maggots squirmed even more due to the impact.\u201cMaster\u2026 Can I ask you something if it\u2019s okay?\u201dJoseph answered while taking out a pilgaret and putting it in his mouth.\u201cOkay\u2026\u2026Go ahead.\u201d\u201cHave I also offended you, master?\u201d\u201c\u2026. no. You taught Marie magic in exchange for learning letters from her. I understand. Above all, you are not like Andrew.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m glad you understood, Master.\u201d\u201cBut that can\u2019t save you.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThere are no personal feelings. Just for a bigger goal\u2026Answer me. What is my goal?\u201dOliver remembered the first time he had met Joseph.\u201c\u2026You said that your goal was to train excellent warlocks\u2026..to survive, to become strong. Ah\u2026\u2026\u201dOliver made a sound as if he understood what Joseph really meant.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The goal of wanting a strong warlock is to make a bigger sacrifice to the Demon. Just like you.\u201dOliver raised his hand.\u201cI\u2019m curious, Master. How did you meet the Demon?\u201dJoseph looked at Oliver and said while looking at the half Pilgaret that was left.\u201cWhen I wasn\u2019t even a third-rate warlock. The Demon whispered to me, who had no talent. He said he\u2019ll give me strength if I were to do what he tells me to do. Hence, I made this altar as the Demon told me to and offered my Master and my fellow disciples as sacrifices.\u201dOliver looked around again.It seemed like Joseph knew a lot about this place, maybe it was because this place was the Warlock family that Joseph belonged to in the past.Oliver wanted to ask what he was doing here and who Joseph\u2019s Master was, but he suppressed his curiosity and focused on the situation in front of him.\u201cCan I ask one more thing, Master?\u201d\u201cOnly one. I\u2019m done smoking now.\u201d\u201cThank you. Could you please spare me? There are things I want to do personally and I will be grateful to the Master. You taught me many things. If you spare me, I will serve you for the rest of my life.\u201dJoseph threw the finished pilgaret on the floor and spoke while stepping on it.\u201cSeriously it is a good offer but I have to turn it down. I can\u2019t imagine what kind of reward there will be if I were to make a great sacrifice like you, and above all\u2026\u201d\u201cAbove all?\u201d\u201c\u2026If it\u2019s not now, I don\u2019t think I can defeat you ever again.\u201dWith those words, Oliver could see a flash of murderous intent for a moment.Oliver rolled to the side as his instinct told him, soon a shadowy tentacle jumped out from the place where Oliver was a few seconds ago.RUMBLE RUMBLE!If Oliver\u2019s reaction were to be a little late, he almost could have gotten caught.\u201cYou can see through my emotions even if I tried to hide my emotions. You have good eyes. More than anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dJoseph soon extracted emotions from the test tube and shot a Las bullet.Oliver also took out a test tube and deployed a black shield to block the attack.However, the process was time-consuming.While Oliver was busy blocking, Joseph took out a Life-force test tube from his pocket and chanted aloud.[Revive]According to the spell, the Life-force that had been filled in the test tube got split into dozens and entered into the corpses and skeletons scattered on the ground.Oliver observed the scene silently.One by one, dim light came from the eyes of the corpses, and they began to stagger from their seats.When joints and muscles that had been hardened for many years started to move again, a crackling sound resounded throughout the room.Oliver witnessed the bizarre, terrifying sight, and exclaimed in shock.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cManipulation-based black magic. Revive. It can bring a corpse back to life in a moment. Even though it\u2019s not my specialty, still I can do it to some extent.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really look like a threatening thing, does it Master?\u201dOliver asked while looking at the corpses that had just been resurrected without any hostility.\u201cRight. It\u2019s not over yet.\u201dWith those words, Joseph opened a test tube filled with emotions and used a new black magic.[Inject Hate]The feelings of hatred in the test tube gushed out and flowed through the air.It then went straight into the torn and resurrected corpses.Then a wave of hatred rose from the faces of the dead bodies and then they turned their heads to look at Oliver and then rushed towards him with a squealing noise.\u201cWoooooooooooooooooomuh!!!\u201d\u201cUhhhhhhhhhhh!!!\u201d\u201cKyaaaaaaah!\u201dA herd of 30 zombies approached Oliver.After identifying the approaching zombies, Oliver extracted minimal emotions from the test tubes and used them in his shadow.[Shadow Vine]This was the first black magic used by Joseph.Oliver mimicked it, and it wasn\u2019t just the same thing.By making it thinner than Joseph\u2019s tentacles, Oliver caught the zombies pouring out from all directions at the same time.The zombies stopped moving.They were screaming to get rid of it somehow, but Oliver pulled his hands together as if strangling them.The shadow tentacles dug into the flesh and then cut the zombies into pieces like cheese.When the damage was severe the remaining Life-force scattered into the thin air and without missing the timing, Joseph made a fierce attack.\u201cAs expected, you\u2019re amazing! I\u2019ve picked up someone amazing!!\u201dLas bullets poured out while Oliver deployed the Black Shield by extracting only a minimum of emotions.However, as expected, Joseph fired Las bullets with different emotional densities to force Oliver\u2019s consumption of emotions.There were even attacks from different angles which further amplified the emotion consumption of Oliver.[Quiet Snake]Four venomous snakes appeared at Joseph\u2019s feet and crawled silently toward Oliver.Oliver, who was defending Joseph\u2019s attack, fired Las bullets as soon as he caught sight of the snake.If anyone saw Oliver now, they would surely be amazed.Joseph, who was pouring out attacks with numerous test tubes was blocked by Oliver with just one test tube.However, that didn\u2019t mean Oliver had an advantage.While Joseph\u2019s test tube was overflowing with emotions, there was only \u2153rd of the emotions left in Oliver\u2019s test tube.[Black Javelin]A black javelin, not comparable to the one Andrew was using, flew and pierced Oliver\u2019s black shield.The Black Shield that was broken and the Black Javelin that had fulfilled its role disappeared like a mist.Oliver, who barely escaped a piercing wound, observed everything silently as if time had stopped.\u201cIt\u2019s over now.\u201dJoseph said while looking down at Oliver\u2019s test tube.\u201cAt best one bullet?\u201dOliver looked at Joseph without saying a word.Oliver suddenly lifted his hand and tried to extract Joseph\u2019s emotions.Oliver thought he would be able to pull out some emotions, but when Joseph swung his hand vigorously, the extraction stopped, and another attack flew in.Even the extraction of emotion, Oliver\u2019s last hope, failed.But Oliver didn\u2019t give up.He gathered the last drop of emotion that is enough to make a Las bullet and then shot towards Joseph\u2019s Las Bullet.Two Las bullets crashed into each other in the air and the emotions started disappearing.Oliver focused his attention at that moment.Suddenly, time passed slowly, it was as if the time had stopped, but Oliver didn\u2019t care about it.Oliver increased his concentration to the maximum.What was important now was the emotions that were disappearing into the thin air.Surprisingly, when he showed extreme concentration, the emotions that were about to disappear like his smoke condensed once again little by little, and a small amount entered Oliver\u2019s hand.Oliver shouted as soon as he got the emotions.[Black Shield]A thin black shield formed.The thin shield narrowly stopped Joseph\u2019s attack.Of course, it was broken at the end due to the lack of emotion, but it cannot be denied that Oliver managed to save his life.It didn\u2019t end here.Oliver, who had mastered extracting emotion, extracted the residual emotions from the broken black shield and blocked hat bullets in the air, and stabilized the emotions with his hands.Joseph looked at it without saying a word and shouted.\u201c\u2026\u2026What the hell are you? OLIVERRRRRR\u201dOliver pretended to be exhausted and manipulated the emotions in his hands.Joseph, noticing this, extracted every bit of emotion from the test tube and poured it into an attack.Las bullets, black javelins, poisonous snakes, and black flames all poured at the same time.Oliver shoots and strikes hat bullets according to the order of flight, deploys a black shield to prevent desperate attacks, and re-extracts emotions that are about to disappear.It was a very dangerous and breathtaking task.Missing a single beat in the sequence would have resulted in death, but strangely, Oliver felt excitement at this moment.He even thought it was strange.If he died here, he won\u2019t be able to see that beautiful light again and he won\u2019t be able to find out the secret within that light.Nevertheless, Oliver enjoyed the moment very much and his head began to spin accordingly.Oliver chanted at the same time as he blocked the attack.[Shadow Spike]A spiky stake of shadows rose under Joseph\u2019s feet, who was completely immersed in his assault.A black magic that reinterprets Shadow Vine inflicts a severe wound to one side of Joseph\u2019s face.And, if it had been a little faster, it could have pierced Joseph\u2019s face.\u201cAhhhhhhh\u2026! You f*cking dog sh*t\u2026!\u201dJoseph lost his composure in confusion.It was easy to see how deadly the attack was.Oliver missed the attack, but he wasn\u2019t disappointed.Because it wasn\u2019t the real attack.\u201cWhat?\u201dJoseph looked at the dartboard on his body and shouted.Joseph watched the black darts curve sideways and fly towards the dartboard on him.\u201cB, Black Shield!\u201dJoseph unfolds the shield in confusion.The Black Dart, an improved version of the Black Javelin, could not penetrate the shield and only got stuck to the shield, but that wasn\u2019t the end.\u201cuh?\u201dJoseph looked at the black dart with a sense of alienation.As the owner of a family, he immediately recognized the difference in its texture.\u201cFU*K\u2026!\u201dBOOOOOOOOM\u2014\u2014!The Las bomb planted in the black dart exploded.The power itself wasn\u2019t that great, but thanks to the outrageous timing, it was strong enough to break the black shield and managed to blow off Joseph\u2019s one side of the shoulder.The test tube that was in Joseph\u2019s arms fell to the floor and broke.Joseph grabbed the flying arm and screamed as if his world was destroyed.\u201cAaaaaaaaah! Aww-! FU*CK FU*CK. YOUUUU Co*ck su*ing dipsh*t\u1173\u1173\u1173\u1173! I\u2019M GOING TO FU*KINGGG KILLLLLLLLLL YOUuuuuuuuuu\u201dRed blood ran down the floor and the smell of burning meat spread in the air.Joseph couldn\u2019t calm his emotions and emitted them into the air.Oliver extracted those emotions and approached Joseph, who was gone mad due to pain and fear.Joseph screamed and crawled on the floor while running away from Oliver as he bled.\u201cFu*k! Fu*k!! Fu*k you!! Don\u2019t come! Don\u2019t come! Don\u2019t come!!!\u201dOliver observed Joseph.He could see emotions like an obsession that went beyond simple fear and pain.It was something more than a simple emotion for survival and Oliver didn\u2019t know what to call it right now.Only one thing is certain, the light is getting more and more beautiful.THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.Oliver felt his heartbeat and soon he started to search for an intact test tube from the group that had fallen on the floor.\u201cMaster. Wait a minute, please wait a minute. Please.\u201dJoseph felt even greater fear towards Oliver as he crawled on the floor.While the red blood left traces like a snail, Oliver found a test tube in good condition.\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201dSeeing Oliver approaching with a test tube, Joseph mumbled as he crawled away.\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t want to die here\u2026\u201dAt that moment, Joseph felt a strange emotion from somewhere.An unusual aura that surprised even the excited Oliver and Joseph, who was a step away from death.When Joseph turned his head, he could see the dead bodies clinging to each other, strangely and horribly.The entangled corpses got transformed into a crude form.Oliver instinctively sensed that this was similar to black magic but was something on a higher level.\u201cHahahahahahahahahahahaha! Indeed! There is no way he will leave me like this!!\u201dJoseph started laughing madly as if he had forgotten about the pain from the arm that had been torn off.His laugh was that of a madman deprived of his sanity.He bursts into madness forgetting pain and fear.What Oliver saw in Joseph was relief and trust that was close to faith.When Oliver turned his head again, the lump of meat woven together had a more plausible appearance, and it was similar to\u2026\u201cOld man on horseback ?\u201dOliver tilted his head and muttered.The rotten flesh and skull of the zombie were merged together to form a small horse, while the intestines were merged to form the figure of an old man.In particular, the mustache and hair made from the intestines looked bushy.Under normal circumstances, it was time to attack quickly, but Oliver instinctively realized that it was pointless.Looking at the bizarre figure, Joseph suddenly shouted.\u201cHelp me! Old man on horseback!! Help me just once! Then I will bring more sacrifices for you\u2026!\u201dAs if Joseph\u2019s wish reached him, the Old man on horseback came up to Oliver.TAK TAKOliver looked at the scene without a word, and the Old man on the horse slowly raised his hand to his chest and bowed his head.It looked like a polite greeting to anyone who sees it.Joseph, who was in a bigger shock than when his arm flew away, tried to argue with something, but before he could even speak, the mass of dead bodies collapsed and the Old man on horseback disappeared..Intestines and maggots pouring out stained Oliver\u2019s shoes and one side of Joseph\u2019s face.Oliver asked Joseph politely.\u201cMaster\u2026what was that just now?\u201dBut Joseph just muttered in despair, as if he had not heard anything.\u201cI can\u2019t admit this\u2026 I can\u2019t admit this\u2026 I can\u2019t admit it\u2026! My fu*cking life\u2026!! I CAN\u2019TTTTTTTTT\u2026!!!\u201dJoseph screamed louder and louder as if he had been possessed by something evil.At one end Joseph\u2019s emotions shone beautifully and Oliver extracted them with excitement.It wasn\u2019t that much but Oliver was really happy.As if to prove his joy, Oliver patted his master Joseph\u2019s chest and thanked him.Even though Joseph was dead.\u201cFor everything until now\u2026 Thank you very much, Master.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27When Oliver returned to the sausage factory, everyone welcomed him.But that\u2019s only for a moment.Everyone was silent when they saw Oliver.Maybe it\u2019s a normal reaction.Walking from Landa to Wineham didn\u2019t make any sense to anyone.Oliver\u2019s face and hands were covered with dust and something black, while his clothes were soaked in sweat and dirt and were in a state of rags.The shoes that were sturdy got eroded slightly due to walking.Overall, Oliver looked like a beggar.After a long silence, someone spoke.\u201cUgh, Senior Oliver? What the hell happened\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to get here from Landa. I just walked. I didn\u2019t get lost because it was a single road.\u201dA very natural answer.But, that is not what everyone wanted to hear.Everyone wanted to know why Oliver came alone without Joseph and Andrew.Everyone instinctively felt something unusual, and at that moment, Marie stepped forward and said,\u201cFirst, why don\u2019t you wash up? Senior Oliver.\u201d\u201cOh, that would be good.\u201dOliver said, touching the back of his hand and face.He was in a bad state as he had been walking day and night for several days.Oliver, guided by Marie, headed to the shower room, but suddenly stopped on the way and spoke to the disciples who were present.\u201cAh, right. Are you all busy?\u201dThe disciples looked at each other and someone answered.\u201cOh, no\u2026 Not really.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll go wash up quickly, so could you all gather around? Don\u2019t leave anyone out. Is there a good place to gather together?\u201d\u201cI think the studio would be good enough.\u201d\u201cThen, can you gather in the studio as Marie said? Please,\u201dWith that said, Oliver left.No one rebuked Oliver\u2019s request.As Oliver asked, not only formal disciples but also informal disciples to gather in the studio.Oliver was the one in charge of the family while Joseph was away.However, even so, they couldn\u2019t get rid of the awkwardness.Apparently, Oliver came back a long time after he went to see Joseph.No, it didn\u2019t matter that he came.The real problem was that he returned alone.No one made a fuss, but the Senior and intermediate disciples gathered together and whispered.\u201cWhat the hell is going on? Where the hell is Master?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, I wonder if he went on another trip. It\u2019s always been like that. He leaves all of a sudden, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cThen, Andrew? Most importantly, even if he went on a trip, he wouldn\u2019t have let Oliver return by walk.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026.\u201dThey didn\u2019t know what happened, but everyone instinctively buzzed, feeling something was wrong.But all the buzzing lasted only for a while.When Oliver, who had finished taking a shower in a hurry, came out, everyone shut their mouths.\u201cThank you for waiting.\u201dOliver came back with a bag on his back.When everyone looked at it closely, they realized that it was the money bag that Oliver took when he went to meet Joseph.When Oliver opened the bag, there were countless bundles of money bills.Oliver dragged the table and poured out the bundles in the bag.\u201c\u2026.!!!\u201dEveryone was astonished at the amount of money they had never seen in their lives.\u201cMarie, can you organize this for me?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026yes, I will.\u201dMarie who froze for a while nodded awkwardly at Oliver\u2019s request.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but could you please follow me?\u201dWhen Oliver said that, those who were in a frozen state looking at the bundle of bills looked at each other and followed Oliver one by one.After a while, they brought more banknotes than the ones spilled from the bags.(\u2026\u2026!!!!!!!!!!!)Everyone was so shocked that they screamed silently, but Marie\u2019s hands were arranging the bundles on the table as fast as the bundles of notes kept falling.This happened several times.Eventually, the number of bundles of notes piled up overflowed the table because they couldn\u2019t fill the table.Oliver looked at everyone in that condition.Oliver realized that what Joseph said was true.It is just as he said when a huge amount of bills were gathered, they give off magical power, and everyone who sees them can\u2019t take their eyes off the bills.Oliver noticed various emotions such as great greed, fear, and anticipation.A senior student asked in a trembling voice.\u201cHey\u2026. what the hell is this\u2026?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 it\u2019s from the secret safe in the master\u2019s room.\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s words, everyone was astonished and they took a deep breath in shock.There were many rules in the family, but the most important thing was not to touch Master Joseph\u2019s possessions.Especially books, work tools, and money.In fact, those who violated this disappeared one day without any trace.\u201cNo, no! Are you out of your mind?! Master\u2026! You brought Master\u2019s money from the safe! Are you crazy!?\u201dThe senior disciple who shouted, stepped back as if he had unwittingly been caught up in a crime.The rest of the people also reacted similarly with only a small difference but Marie was the only one who kept her composure.Oliver calmly raised his hand.\u201cEveryone, calm down\u2026\u201d\u201cCalm down?! Calm down! If the master comes, he\u2019ll kill us all?!!!\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. He\u2019s already dead.\u201d\u201cHow on earth are you\u2026? Huh?\u201dThose who were frightened and surprised suddenly stopped in unison as if someone threw cold water on their faces.Then they looked at Oliver silently with a silly look.Oliver stayed silent just to give the people a break until they had completely calmed down, and after a while, a senior disciple who came to his senses asked.\u201cWha, what do you mean? I can\u2019t believe the Master is dead. By whose hand did he die?\u201cIn my hands\u2026 I killed him.\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s calm reply, everyone faltered a little.This time their reaction was different.Some frowned as if they had heard a bad joke, some were frightened, some did not believe what Oliver said and there were also those who denied it.Among everyone, only Marie\u2019s eyes shone brightly.Suddenly a senior disciple said.\u201cLie\u2026.. It\u2019s a lie.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a lie. It\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cThen, show me the evidence that you killed Master.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Do you need proof?\u201d\u201cYes, of course! How can you not bring any evidence with you when you\u2019re saying this nonsense!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201dOliver scratched his head as if he had belatedly realized his mistake.That reaction made everyone terrified.In such a ridiculous situation, everyone was out of breath and sweating as if they had reached their mental limit.Oliver scratched his head and thought, and suddenly opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026.Master was the one who helped me a lot, so wouldn\u2019t it be inappropriate if I were to cut off his head just for everyone to see?\u201d\u201cThen, why did you kill our Master!\u201dEventually, the senior disciple, whose mental state reached its limits, asked like a scream.Everyone stood aside in fear.It wasn\u2019t weird to think a fight would erupt.But, Oliver treated everything calmly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that, too. I didn\u2019t want to kill him either. I got some help from Master and there were many things I wanted to learn from Master.\u201dThe sadness buried in the calmness seemed to be something foreign rather than humane and the listeners who heard this were horrified.\u201cBut believe me. I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you help it?\u201d asked Marie, who was watching the situation quietly.There was faith in Oliver in her eyes.\u201cHe tried to kill me. He was going to offer me as a sacrifice.\u201d\u201cSacrifice?\u201d\u201cYes,\u00a0 I heard that it was a sacrifice for the Demon. Sir. Andrew was already killed as a sacrifice, and I think Master has also given a lot of other people as a sacrifice.\u201dThe horrific truth was conveyed with a calm expression and this disparity caused the disciples to turn their faces white with fear that surpassed their shock.Everyone felt like they had been cattle who thought they were human while looking in the mirror.In the meantime, someone denied it.\u201c\u2026 Lie, it\u2019s a lie. Why would Master do that?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s to be strong. The stronger the offering, the stronger the power\u2026 and the more the disciples were given.\u201d\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense! Master bought you only a while ago. No matter how genius you are, how can you beat a man who came to Wineham alone and built a family?\u201d\u201cAs you said, Master was strong and I almost died. I was a bit lucky,\u201dAfter thinking for a while, Oliver murmured as if it was the most appropriate answer.A very consistent attitude, but surprisingly, that attitude made people slowly start to believe it, even though he didn\u2019t show proper evidence.Everyone started to believe that Joseph was dead and in Oliver\u2019s hand.Oliver clapped his hands when everyone was overwhelmed by the overwhelming situation and couldn\u2019t take any action.\u201cThen, may I speak again?\u201dOliver resumed as the silence returned.\u201cI have no intention of leaving here for now. Not yet. I have a lot of things I want to study,\u201dOliver said, pointing in the direction of the study.\u201cSo I\u2019m going to stay here and study for a while, and I think you might feel a little uncomfortable. There are people who don\u2019t like me.\u201dSome flinched.Even ordinary consideration and thoughtfulness seemed alien and bizarre when they came out of Oliver\u2019s mouth.It was rather frightening and horrifying.\u201cThis money is\u2026 It\u2019s Master\u2019s property, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll need it anymore. If you don\u2019t want to be with me, why don\u2019t you take your share and leave? If you want you can even take my share.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026what?!\u201dEveryone asked back in shock.Oliver answered in surprise.\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave yet\u2026 There are too many books in the study. Is that too much to ask?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. Can we really take this money? Are you serious?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Yes, Master is not here anyway. Can\u2019t we share it?\u201dThe focus of the conversation was strangely out of place.All of the disciples looked startled.The people here once dreamed of becoming powerful Warlock like Joseph and forming their own families, regardless of what they have ended up doing now.Everyone\u2019s ultimate goal had been Power and Money.Only the form was different, but the fundamentals were similar.Oliver\u2019s proposal was a shock to them.His approach was completely different from their Master Joseph, who only thought of increasing his own wealth and never thought of sharing.Everyone thought it might be a trick to get rid of impurities.When everyone was in the midst of confusion, Marie raised her hand.\u201cOh, does Marie want her share? Let\u2019s see. One, two, three\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, Senior Oliver. I raised my hand to ask you a question.\u201d\u201cOh, really? What is it?\u201d\u201cWhat happens if we stay?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Can\u2019t we just do what we do?\u201d\u201cMaster\u2026 No, Joseph\u2019s dead. The family can\u2019t function in Wineham like it used to. In the first place, this peace was maintained by Joseph\u2019s power.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. Some other family might try to take control of our base when they find out Joseph\u2019s gone. If we resist, a fight might ensue.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026will make it difficult for me to read books.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019ll be difficult. To avoid such a difficult situation, Senior Oliver, who defeated Joseph, should be the new Master of the family.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSurprised Oliver looked at determined Marie, whose eyes sparkled.Oliver said, scratching his cheek.\u201cBut\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\u201cYou can lead the organization and teach us, just like Joseph did. If you want to read a book comfortably in the study, you should become our master.\u201dOliver approached Marie and stared at her face.It wasn\u2019t a threat, but it was quite intimidating to the party involved and the people watching.After a while, Oliver replied.\u201c\u2026. If it\u2019s a must, it can\u2019t be helped. I\u2019ll be the Master\u2026\u201dMarie breathed a sigh of relief and smiled with joy.Oliver didn\u2019t know why she was so happy.At that moment Peter cut into the conversation.\u201cThen, I think I know what to do\u2026.\u201d\u201cWait a minute,\u201dOliver raised his hand, stopped Peter, and spoke to everyone who kept staring at him.\u201cWhat would you do? Do you want to stay here? Or do you want to leave?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28As the beautiful bell rang, the door of the pharmacy store opened.An old woman with her back bent and wearing a worn-out scarf came in.\u201cwelcome.\u201dA middle-aged man with a half-bald head and gold-rimmed glasses welcomed the old woman.The middle-aged man who was the owner of the pharmacy was wearing a white robe over her suit.\u201cAh, pharmacist, how are you?\u201dThe wrinkled old woman greeted him very warmly.The pharmacist also welcomed her kindly.\u201cMadam, How have you been?\u201d\u201cYes, I have always been well.\u201dThe pharmacist went towards the old woman who was uncomfortable because of arthritis and helped her move.Feeling his kindness, the old woman thanked him.\u201cGod, thank you. Mr. Pharmacist. That\u2026 Ah! The chicken dish you sent me a while ago was really delicious and I enjoyed eating it. It was the most delicious food I\u2019ve ever eaten in my life. Thank you so much.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m rather glad that you enjoyed it.\u201dThe pharmacist spoke skillfully.After the greeting was over, the old woman took out a crumpled bill from her pocket.\u201c\u2026 I know it\u2019s a really silly thing to say, but is it even possible to buy a painkiller with this money? Mr. Pharmacist?\u201dThe pharmacist looked at the money.The old woman who had no clue about this asked again.\u201cIt\u2019s getting harder and harder to move around. After all, this\u2026\u201dThe pharmacist raised his hand.Then he went inside the store and took out a pain reliever that had just arrived.It was a painkiller made by John Snow.\u201cTake this. It is a recently released pain reliever, and it seems to be effective.\u201d\u201cBut it looks pretty expensive\u2026.\u201d said the old woman, bewildered.The pharmacist said kindly without giving up.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s call it a birthday present.\u201d\u201cMy birthday is still far away\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t give you one last year, right? Just accept it. Give that money as a gift for your grandchild.\u201dThe old woman felt apologetic, but in the end, she decided to accept the pharmacist\u2019s consideration.The old woman continued to say thank you for a while.The pharmacist smiled kindly and said it was okay again and again.\u201cBy the way, how old is your grandchild, Madam?\u201d\u201cHe.., he\u2019ll be about fifteen now.\u201d\u201cIf you are ok with it then I can arrange a job for him, please let me know if he has any ideas. I also need help in the warehouse and I have some connections in some restaurants and factories in Landa.\u201d\u201cThank you. Thank you very much. You will definitely be blessed.\u201dThe old woman was about to leave after saying thanks almost bumped into the people who had just come in.\u201cOh, my\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you okay?\u201dThe black-haired, pale-skinned boy asked, supporting the old woman who nearly fell.His behavior was kind, but his lifeless skin and dynamics created a sense of rejection rather than friendliness.As if the old woman was no different, she hurriedly greeted him and ran out of the pharmacy.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe customer who had just entered and the pharmacist looked at each other without saying a word.After a while, the pharmacist felt something unusual, so he trudged over, locked the door, and hung a sign that reads {close} in front of the door.\u201c I\u2019ll ask you just in case, you came here because you have something to do with me, right?\u00a0 You didn\u2019t come to buy medicine, right?.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Oliver answered.\u201cOkay.\u201dThe pharmacist led Oliver and his attendants, Marie and Peter, to a small room inside the pharmacy.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, there are only two chairs. The only thing I can give is water since it wasn\u2019t originally expecting to welcome any guests.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dAfter pouring the water into the cup, the pharmacist drank and asked.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get to the point. No matter how urgent it is, I\u2019m cautious of not closing the door for more than 20 minutes, so what do you want?\u201d\u201cI came here because I wanted to ask you something.\u201d\u201cRequest?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s Joseph\u2019s request, he should come. Why did you come?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s my request?\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dThe pharmacist looked at Oliver without a word.He tried to guess what he was trying to do, but unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t find anything.When he came to extract the Life-force or even when he captured the attacker, Oliver was the same, as he was now.There was no hostility, no favorability, no bad intentions.\u201c\u2026According to the rules, I should kick you guys out without listening, but anyway, since you helped my staff in the last battle with the wizards, I\u2019ll listen\u2026 Oh, wait, you must have asked Joseph for permission before that, right? I would not be able to do anything without his permission.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case then you don\u2019t need to worry. He\u2019s already dead.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..What?\u201d\u201cHe died. At Landa.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did you see it yourself?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow did he die?\u201d\u201cHe got hit by a Las bomb, lost one arm, and died because of excessive bleeding.\u201d\u201cDid he get attacked by another warlock? Then, why are you still alive\u2026.ah, don\u2019t tell me\u2026. Did you kill him yourself?\u201dThe pharmacist asked as if he understood.Oliver answered calmly.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dAlthough the pharmacist should have been surprised, he wasn\u2019t surprised.For some reason, seeing the boy in front of him seemed like everything was possible.\u201c\u2026\u2026Why did you kill him?\u201d\u201cHe was trying to kill me. To be exact, he tried to sacrifice me to the Demon\u2026. So I had no choice but to do it.\u201dThe pharmacist was not surprised.He had been dealing with warlocks for several decades.In particular, it wasn\u2019t too strange for a warlock as strong as Joseph to have a deal with a Demon.There was nothing new about it.But the boy in front of him was a little different.A warlock who made sacrifices to the Demon was definitely a terrifying monster.However, the boy who was about fifteen or sixteen standing in front of him was saying that he had defeated such a monster.The boy wasn\u2019t happy or angry about it at all.There was no malice, arrogance, cruelty, and other disparities.\u201cOkay, I understand. Joseph wanted to kill you and you killed him to live, right?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I hope you understand.\u201d\u201c\u2026What I don\u2019t understand is why you came to me, what\u2019s the problem?\u201dOliver whispered a few words to Peter and answered.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I happened to succeed as the Master and took over the family, and it is said that the other family could attack us when they find out that the Master is dead.\u201d\u201cCould it be\u2026Did you come to ask me to mediate between the families?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right. Can you help us?\u201dIt was a naive question.The pharmacist felt something more than simple malice or cunningness.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 can I ask you why?\u201d\u201d I\u2019ve been doing business with Joseph for a long time. Do you think I can help just because the staff under him asks for help? Moreover, what you said can be a lie too, right?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026that\u2019s possible too?\u201dOliver said as if agreeing with the pharmacist.Peter spoke to Oliver again.\u201c\u2026But I would like your help. If the warlocks fight with each other, wouldn\u2019t it be the pharmacist\u2019s business that gets disrupted?\u201d\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d\u201cNo, absolutely not.\u201dOliver spoke while shaking his hands.The pharmacist sighed and said.\u201cHahaha\u2026you are right to some extent, but this kind of mediation isn\u2019t worth anything and it\u2019s a loss, and it will spark an unnecessary misunderstanding, that\u2019ll be even more damaging.\u201d\u201cBut I heard you mediated between families in the past?\u201d\u201cAt that time, everyone wanted to stop fighting and it was in everyone\u2019s interest.\u201d\u201cThen, if you can benefit, will you help me?\u201dThe pharmacist wanted to say stop talking nonsense, but as soon as he looked at Oliver\u2019s eyes, he shut his mouth.His businessman\u2019s instinct told him that it wasn\u2019t a bluff.\u201c\u2026even if I can\u2019t help, I will arrange a place for you to have a conversation at least once. From there on, it\u2019s up to you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Thank you.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t said I\u2019ll do it yet. So, What can you give me?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dOliver took out a Pilgaret and started talking.Two days after his meeting with the pharmacist, as promised, the pharmacist arranged a meeting for Oliver between Warlocks Anthony and Dominic in the tavern that he owns.Anthony was a pale, thin-skinned man with brown hair combed to the right, while Dominic boasted his chiseled chin and stout body like a manual laborer.They both were about the same age as Joseph, so they really didn\u2019t like Oliver who looked only around fifteen at most.Nevertheless, since the pharmacist invited them, they kept quiet and watched the situation.\u201c\u2026..\u201dAn awkward silence turned the atmosphere a little weird.At that moment, Oliver stood up and greeted everyone.\u201cHello everyone. Thank you for coming.\u201dNo one answered back.However, it\u2019s not that there was no response, it\u2019s just that they didn\u2019t want to respond.Their emotions showed active reactions such as questioning, irritability, confusion, guessing, observation, and cunningness respectively.As Oliver tried to speak again, Anthony raised his hand.\u201cYes, what do you want to say\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026There are so many things I want to ask you, but let\u2019s start with the most basic question. Who are you?\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been in this kind of situation\u2026 My name is Oliver.\u201d\u201cOliver?\u201dDominic, who caressed his hair asked while touching his ragged beard.\u201cOh\u2026! You\u2019re Oliver?\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHaha! As I heard, you really look like a weakling! Did you really kill the wizard?\u201d\u201cI was just lucky.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a funny guy\u2026but we came here because Joseph called us, so why are you here?Dominic suddenly stopped laughing and frowned.Rather than being really angry, it was intended to intimidate people.In fact, Marie and Peter, who were following as attendants, suddenly flinched.Apparently, the man named Dominic was really good at these kinds of threats.\u201cPharmacist. You tell me. Surely, you are the one who said Joseph would come? I didn\u2019t come here to be teased.\u201dDominic\u2019s arrogant and intimidating attitude made the pharmacist\u2019s staff feel the sensitivity of the situation.Dominic\u2019s men roared along with him.The atmosphere quickly became gloomy.The pharmacist calmed everyone as he answered.\u201cI said for sure that the owner of the Joseph family will see you.\u201d\u201cSo. Why Joseph..?\u2026 then\u2026 huh?\u201dInstead of speaking, he looked at Oliver as if he had noticed something.Anthony, who was watching the situation also looked at Oliver with sharp eyes and at that time, Oliver said:\u201cHello. My name is Oliver, the new owner of the Joseph family.\u201dOliver greeted them politely, but their reaction was cold.They froze as if they were not able to process the information but Dominic grinned with the corners of his mouth extending from one ear to another.\u201cI don\u2019t understand what kind of dogsh*t situation is this?\u201d\u201cI am the Joseph family\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, no, fu*k it\u2026 that\u2019s not it, damn it, the family head should be Joseph, so why is a b*stard like you suddenly became the owner of the family?\u201d\u201cah\u2026\u201dOliver looked at the pharmacist.Seeing the pharmacist shaking his head, Oliver understood the situation and explained it again.\u201cMaster is dead.\u201d\u201cWhat? That person died?\u201dAnthony was a little surprised as if he couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWho killed him? Who has the skills to kill Joseph in Landa?\u201d\u201cI killed him. Since he was trying to kill me.\u201d\u201cYou killed Joseph?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOliver honestly answered, but the situation did not improve.Dominic\u2019s expression grew even worse while Anthony laughed slowly and asked a question.\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201cMy Age?\u201d\u201cYeah, your age.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I used to work in a mine and before that, I was in an orphanage, so I don\u2019t know my exact age.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026All right. You are a friend who worked in the mine and was from an orphanage, then I will ask you again. You killed Joseph?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIs there any evidence?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026it didn\u2019t seem appropriate for me to cut off the Master\u2019s head no matter what.\u201d\u201cThis guy completely crazy?\u201dDominic shouted hearing the answer.Oliver didn\u2019t understand what he meant by that.\u201cPharmacist, did you call us just by believing the words of this madman?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s a lie. Also, he made some interesting suggestions and it may be hard to believe, but it\u2019s a proposition that benefits everyone.\u201d\u201cDamn it, really now.\u201d\u201cFor now, let\u2019s hear it.\u201dAnthony said while calming Dominic who was about to get angry.\u201cAfter we\u2019ve heard everything. It isn\u2019t too late to get angry? Hey, Oliver? I\u2019ll listen to you, so tell me what you want to say.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAfter Oliver expressed his sincere thanks, he spoke again.\u201cThe reason I\u2019m here is because I want to ask everyone a favor.\u201d\u201cfavor?\u201d\u201cYeah, even though my master is dead, I want to be in peace as we are right now. I don\u2019t like fighting.\u201dDominic and Anthony\u2019s men burst out laughing.\u201cIf you can agree to this then I will repay you as much as you want.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the reward?\u201dOliver pulled out a pilgaret from inside his pocket.\u201cI will share with everyone the recipe to make a pilgaret of a better quality.\u201dDominic and Anthony reflexively looked at the pilgaret that Oliver had pulled out.The light around it was definitely different.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cThis is a pilgaret that I made and it is of better quality than before. The pharmacist also approved it.\u201dThe pharmacist nodded his head as if acknowledging it.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the case. Why does this pilgaret seem to be a bit strange?\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s a combination of maternal love and anger. About 8 to 2.\u201dEveryone looked up at Oliver in silence hearing those words.\u201cOf course, it is okay to have only one emotion, but its effect gets better instantly when you mix it with the opposite emotion. Also, in the process of mixing emotions, the amount of success rate also increases. So you can make more and it will definitely benefit you.\u201dEveryone went silent while disregarding Oliver\u2019s enthusiasm.Their reactions were unusual and Anthony suddenly raised his hand and asked.\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea, but why did you think we didn\u2019t think about it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Indeed? Why?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. Emotions are very delicate energy. Mixing emotions of different tendencies are not easy even for someone who\u2019s familiar with it\u2026.\u201dAnthony didn\u2019t finish his speech because at that moment Oliver took out two test tubes and synthesized two different emotions in the air.The two emotions, of different personalities, had a partial-repulsive reaction but they soon regained their composure in Oliver\u2019s hands and beautifully blended into one.\u201c\u2026Is it difficult?\u201dNo one spoke.Oliver looked at the reaction around him and spoke again.\u201cOr, you can provide me with emotions and I will synthesize them and deliver them regularly. If we were to make a better pilgaret then everyone here would get a big profit.\u201d\u201cFU*K it!\u201dSomeone cut off Oliver\u2019s words.A muscular man who was Dominic\u2019s subordinate started to babble like a ferocious dog.\u201cEven if you have some talent, you dare try to match our master? Don\u2019t get full of yourself!\u201dOliver looked at the man who suddenly stood up.Outwardly, he seemed angrier than anyone else but on the inside, he was cunning and calculative.He threatened to see how far he could squeeze Oliver.The muscular man pulled out a test tube of Life-force potion.He then added a muscle-up spell to the Life-force and quickly drank it.As soon as he drank it, the muscles all over his body started to swell greatly.\u201cAh, if you drink the Life-force potion and add muscle-up, then side effects will be offset.\u201dAs Oliver thought about it in his head, the muscular man came screaming toward him.\u201cDon\u2019t teach us, you little b*stard!\u201dAnthony, Dominic, and the pharmacist didn\u2019t intervene and just watched the situation.As the muscular man approached the only person who responded was Marie.\u201cWhen the Master is talking, how dare you intervene!\u201dThe muscular man grabbed Marie\u2019s neck as if it was nothing.His hands were so big that one hand was enough to grab the neck, then he said tauntingly.\u201cLet me ask you one thing. If you\u2019re really the Master of the Joseph family, why did you bring this? huh? Were you scared?\u201d\u201cYeah, I was scared, that\u2019s why I told them to just stay.\u201d\u201cHahaha! Look at this crazy b*tch.\u201d\u201cExcuse me. Can you let go of that hand? It looks like she is in a lot of pain.\u201dOliver said while looking at Marie, whose complexion started to turn blue.The muscular man shook Marie and mocked Oliver.\u201cWhy are you asking? You said you knocked down Joseph? So, why don\u2019t you just take me down too? hahahaha!!\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dOliver responded with a shrug.Soon black tentacles came out from his shadows on the floor and instantly subdued the muscular man.His arms, legs, waist, shoulders, and neck were wrapped around tightly, and the muscular man was very confused.\u201cHuh? Huh?\u201dWithout looking at the muscular man Oliver asked Marie if she was okay.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cKuk! Kuk-! Yes\u2026 But what\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cI learned this when I was fighting Master.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a lie, both Anthony and Dominic knew it was true because they all have fought against Joseph.They remembered that when Joseph fights he unconditionally outsmarted his opponents using this Vine Shadow.\u201cWho, who did this\u2026!\u201dThe muscular man tried to break the shadow tentacles with force, but the tentacles pierced back with greater force.His muscles were torn apart and his bones broke.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah! Ahhh!\u201dThe muscular man couldn\u2019t even scream.Oliver apologized as he saw him in pain.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. But can you please don\u2019t push yourself too hard? Then, it\u2019s difficult to control the power\u2026\u201dThe members of each family, who sensed an unusual situation, took out their test tubes at once and took a fighting stance.Oliver spoke while taking out the test tube.\u201cHuh, after all that, do we still have to fight?\u201d,Surprisingly, Anthony and Dominic couldn\u2019t answer as easily as before.After a while, Anthony asked.\u201c\u2026why? If we said we would fight, would you fight?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like it\u2026 but If I was left with no choice then I have\u00a0 to do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026You don\u2019t like it but can\u2019t help it?\u201cYes. Because I don\u2019t like killing people. More than anything else, if I were to fight then I would be wasting the time to study\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but is there any peaceful way to end this?\u201dThe situation suddenly changed into a life-or-death battle.Oliver spoke as if it had nothing to do with his life.Even more appalling was that this did not stem from stingy self-esteem or false arrogance.They all looked at Oliver with eyes filled with tension.The tension builds up over time like a bomb that\u2019s about to go off.At the moment when it felt like it was about to get out of control, someone hastily spoke up.\u201c About the Pilgaret\u2026! Shall we talk again?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29[The origin of black magic is still unknown. Decades after the birth of magic, warlocks were born one by one. There are several theories about the birth of warlocks, but the most supported hypothesis is that of magic. It is said that black magic started from imitating magic.\u2014A wizard\u2019s observation of black magic]Oliver turned the book cover and read it.This book describes black magic from the point of view of a wizard, it also explains why black magic is called wicked and why it should be eradicated in 200 pages, and the first reason why black magic is so evil is that it was a way for the inferior people to use magic without mana, so it was against the logic of nature.In order to prevent such a catastrophe, they said that an institutional approach was needed to forcibly isolate humans without magical powers and to naturally cull inferior genes by eliminating fertility.It may have been that Oliver was wrong because of his short learning, but it seemed to be a very narrow-minded and absurd argument for him.That\u2019s why it also felt pretty fun for Oliver.When Oliver was thinking about the book he read, suddenly someone knocked on the door.Oliver raised his head and asked.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cMaster. I\u2019m sorry, but\u2026 it\u2019s time to work.\u201dAt Marie\u2019s voice, Oliver checked his watch.She was right.It was time to work.\u201cYes, wait a minute.\u201dAfter putting a bookmark on the book he was reading, Oliver went out of the study and saw Marie waiting for him with her back bent.\u201cEmotions have been sent from the Anthony and Dominic families. They have been moved to the studio.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAfter saying that, Oliver walked toward the studio.Countless people had already gathered in the studio which was the largest space in the Joseph Family headquarters.Everyone from the senior disciple to the informal disciples was present.\u201cI greet the Master!\u201d\u201cI greet the Master!\u201dAs soon as Oliver entered, all the disciples bowed to Oliver with Peter as the main lead.Respect comes from the heart, not simply by force.It wasn\u2019t too strange.After all, Oliver actually negotiated with Anthony and the Dominic family on his own.But it was not just because of this that their attitude changed.\u201cIs everyone here?\u201d\u201cYes! Master!\u201dEveryone was present including the informal disciples and the servants who had been doing chores all this time.Oliver provided them with as much education as possible.Somehow, having taken over the family, it was Oliver\u2019s minimal sense of responsibility to do something like a Master.\u201cBefore class, I will do the task. You may not be able to help me right away, so please watch everything I do.\u201dThe eyes of the informal disciples, junior disciples, and some intermediate and senior disciples, who received the opportunity for education were excited.\u201cWhere are the ingredients?\u201cOh, wait a minute, Master.\u201dMarie made some informal disciples get the box.Inside the box, partitions were tightly divided, and test tubes with emotions were placed in each box.\u201cMaternal love and anger, 8 to 2 ratio. We checked it accurately.\u201dOliver took a look at the box.It was indeed 8-2.\u201cCan you open the test tube lid?\u201dMarie beckoned and all the informal disciples became busy opening the lids.\u201cEverything is open.\u201d\u201cThank you. Can you step back for a moment?\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s words, Marie and others in the vicinity quickly retreated.After some space had cleared up, Oliver stretched out his hand in the air and after a moment, each test tube tossed and the emotions within them rushed out.\u201cOh my God\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.ah.\u201d\u201cAww, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201dEach disciple looked in admiration at the scene unfolding before their eyes.Oliver understood how they felt.Oliver also felt that it was beautiful to look at.It was truly beautiful to see so many emotions coming together.The two emotions with different personalities caused repulsion when they were combined, which was quite intimidating due to a large number of emotions.Big and small sparks spread all around which made even Oliver feel that it was beautiful.What would happen if Oliver were to make a mistake here?Perhaps not just the basement, even the entire factory might explode.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs the reaction between the two emotions grew bigger and bigger, everyone felt that it was not unusual, but at that moment, when Oliver clasped his hands as if they were holding hands, the fluctuating emotions regained stability, as if the previous reaction was just a lie.Oliver lifted his hands tightly and dropped the synthesized emotion into each test tube.\u201cEveryone, close the lids, and check the quantity to make sure the emotions are in the right place?\u201dThose who had been immersed in the magical sight that was in front of their eyes came back to their senses and quickly closed the lid of the test tube as Oliver said, and checked the amount of emotion.\u201c\u2026..There is nothing wrong here.\u201d\u201cThere is no problem with this box here.\u201d\u201cNo problem here either.\u201d\u201cNo problem!\u201dAll the test tubes in the box were appropriately assigned with emotions.Oliver went straight to class after ordering the finished emotions to be set aside.\u201cAs I said before, divide into groups 1, 2, and 3.\u201dAt those words, everyone stood apart.Informal disciples and some junior disciples were in the third group, some junior disciples and some intermediate disciples were in the second group, and some of the intermediate and Senior disciples were in the first group.For you information, Marie and Peter were also placed in group 1 and Oliver had them practice by taking out a test tube that had been prepared beforehand.\u201cGroup 3 has to make shapes with emotions. Don\u2019t make it sloppy, just do it right and when you make it, try to change the form of the emotions faster than you speak.\u201dThe third group members followed Oliver\u2019s words without saying a word.\u201cGroup 2, use basic black magic such as Las Bullet and Black Shield using the emotions but try to hold them in your hand until the end. Then, when you can\u2019t hold it any longer, release the black magic and use those emotions again to practice other black magic.\u201dThe second group also followed Oliver\u2019s orders without saying a word.\u201cGroup 1, did you see what I did before?\u201dIt was the mixing of maternal love and anger.Everyone got scared and nodded their heads.\u201cMix the emotions in the test tube.\u201dOliver\u2019s words felt like a lightning bolt to the disciple in group 1.However, there was no one who raised their concern.After all, the achievements achieved through Oliver\u2019s class cannot be described in words.It was like a miracle for them.It will vary from person to person, but one class of Oliver\u2019s teachings was worth more than the months of Joseph\u2019s teaching.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. If you use a small amount, the backlash will not be too great and it will be a lot easier because you will be mixing emotions with the same tendency.\u201dIt was true.Currently, the emotions in the test tube of group 1 were hate and anger.It wasn\u2019t that difficult to mix the slightly different but identical emotions.In this way, the three groups gathered and practiced.Oliver walked between them, pointing out those who made mistakes.\u201cIt\u2019s out of shape. Do it right.\u201d\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry, Master\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be swayed by the emotions, take control. Don\u2019t waste the emotions.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand! Master\u201d\u201cA little faster. You are still slower.\u201d\u201cI will fix it, Master.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re making this mistake again, please correct it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll fix it, Master\u201d\u201cIf mixing didn\u2019t work properly. Separate them and try again.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you, Master\u201dOliver corrected every mistake they made and gave them tips whenever necessary.Compared to their days with Joseph, they were able to get a very soft and generous education.Thanks to such a soft and generous education, the disciples were able to practice more actively, and their skills also improved quickly as much as they made mistakes.Although Oliver was the youngest one here, the disciples who received education from him began to regard him as their true teacher and Master.As time went on everyone\u2019s practice began to get on track to some extent.With nothing more to point out, Oliver walked around the disciples observing them and then he suddenly grabbed someone and asked a question.\u201c\u2026can I ask how you got here?\u201dThe informal disciple who was practicing in group 3 asked back in surprise.\u201cI, Are you asking me, Master?\u201d\u201cYes, the form of the emotion is breaking down. Get it right.\u201d\u201cAh! I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026how did you get here? Oh, if it\u2019s hard to say, you don\u2019t have to force it.\u201dThe informal disciple thought about it for a moment and then opened his mouth.\u201cThat\u2026 I lived with a gang of beggars in the countryside and I was running away after hitting the chief of the beggars, and at that time I met Mas\u2026no, I met Joseph.\u201d\u201cI see, so that\u2019s how you met Master.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201dOliver then asked the other disciples randomly how they joined the Joseph family.Orphanages, construction sites, slums, etc.Everyone told their stories and Oliver nodded mechanically whenever he heard them.\u201cThen, this time tell me your story\u2026.\u201d\u201c Master.\u201dMarie interrupted Oliver who was asking questions.She had a cold sweat as she was mixing two different emotions.\u201cYes, Marie.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s practice time is over.\u201dOliver looked at his watch.\u201c\u2026.that\u2019s right. Okay. Everyone has worked hard, let\u2019s stop the training here today. Please clean up.\u201dAs soon as hearing Oliver\u2019s words, those who were controlling the emotions in a cold sweat gasped in relief and put the emotions back into the test tube.They all looked very exhausted but nevertheless, Oliver could feel a sense of satisfaction from them that he had never seen before.That\u2019s right, now that they\u2019ve been practicing every day, they\u2019ve built up their skills as a warlock.If it goes on like this, becoming a real warlock was no longer a dream for them.\u201c\u2026Then, is the work done for today?When Oliver asked Marie about the schedule, she pulled out her notebook and checked it like a secretary.\u201c\u2026Yes, Master. Since you have finished processing the emotions, we can give them to Anthony and the Dominic family through the pharmacist, and there is nothing more for you to do.\u201dAt that moment, Peter intervened.\u201cThen, Master, I have a suggestion for you.\u201d\u201cHey, what are you talking, Master needs to rest\u2026.\u201dOliver stopped Marie and asked Peter.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2026, I didn\u2019t mean to bother you, Master. However, I think we need to gather ingredients again\u2026 So if you give me permission, then I will go with the other kids. I will come back soon.\u201dOliver thought for a moment, then said.\u201cI will come with you.\u201d\u201cWhat? No, Master. We don\u2019t want to trouble you.\u201d\u201cNo, I am coming because there is something that I want to see. Can you prepare?\u201dOliver put on the black magic item \u2018Fake Face\u2019 and teamed up with Marie and Peter to collect emotions.The first place they went was suggested by Oliver, which was none other than an inn.It was the place Oliver first visited to extract emotions.When Peter knocked on the door, an old woman came out.\u201cHuh? Who are you?\u201d\u201cAre the fruits ripe?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I thought it was time. I\u2019ve cooked three. Come in.\u201dThe old woman beckoned them to come in.Then, just as before, they climbed up the narrow hallway through the stairs to the second floor where they heard sounds of the children from three small rooms.Up to this point, it was the same as back then.\u201cIt\u2019s me. Are you there?\u201dSomeone opened the door slowly and they saw a woman poking her face through the crack in the door.She was not the woman Oliver remembered.\u201cLandlord Madam?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The usual.\u201dShe opened the door as if she was familiar with it.Her eyes were lifeless and the child was lying on the bed and crying.\u201cAaaawawawawawawawaaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201dThe baby\u2019s loud voice was heard.While Peter was counting the money while checking the woman\u2019s condition, Oliver approached the old woman and asked.\u201cWhere is she?\u201d\u201cHuh? Who?\u201d\u201cThe lady who was here before.\u201d\u201cThe girl before\u2026? Ah, that one? I kicked her out. She said that she needed money because she was sick and so she sold her feelings on her own and she was of no use anymore, so I kicked her out. It\u2019s an empty can anyway. Why?\u201dOliver listened and stood still.Peter and Marie looked into Oliver\u2019s lost gaze instead of extracting maternal love.When they came out of the inn after work, Oliver remained silent for a moment.Marie asked cautiously.\u201cMaster\u2026what happened\u2026?\u201dActually, objectively speaking, it wasn\u2019t such a big deal.It didn\u2019t mean that her feelings were particularly beautiful or anything like that.But Oliver couldn\u2019t say what it was.To Oliver, she was the first mother from whom he extracted maternal love.For some reason, he felt like he wanted to see her.It was not necessary to see her, but Oliver\u2019s unique curiosity got triggered.He had a painful sensation as if unable to scratch the itchy area.Oliver closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them while adding strength to both eyes.Then, the blurred emotions around him became clearer and the range also expanded.Soon his eyes started to hurt as if he was looking at the sun with the naked eye.However, Oliver didn\u2019t care.It hurts more for Oliver for not being able to do what he wants than his eyes hurting.Oliver\u2019s field of vision widened and as he began to cross an area, he found emotions that were dim, but similar to the woman\u2019s.\u201c\u2026.found it.\u201dWith those words, Oliver suddenly began to move.Marie and Peter followed him without even knowing what was going on, and after walking along the main road for a long time they entered a side road.In the place where the beggars and the homeless were gathered, Oliver found the woman.She had a bottle of wine and a dying child that was left behind, covered in ugly and dirty rags.She was the woman from whom Oliver first extracted maternal love.\u201c\u2026.uh?\u201dThe skinny woman looked up at Oliver with empty eyes.She couldn\u2019t remember who he was, but it didn\u2019t matter to her.As if she was used to being a beggar, she brazenly showed her dying child and begged for money.\u201cThe child is sick. Please, give me some money. The child needs medicine.\u201dEven if it wasn\u2019t for the smell of her alcohol, Oliver could easily recognize that the woman was not normal.Peter noticed the situation and whispered in his ear.\u201cIt looks like an empty can, Master.\u201dOliver didn\u2019t say anything.He just stared at the woman for a long time as she held out her child like a bowl and soon, a feeling that was hard to describe welled up within Oliver.Oliver didn\u2019t know whether it was sadness or emptiness, but it was something that was hard to explain.\u201cPlease, benevolent one, give the child a penny. I haven\u2019t eaten in several days. The child is sick. Please\u2026\u201dOliver deeply looked at the empty woman and the dying child.After a long silence, Oliver barely opened his mouth and said.\u201cGive her some money.\u201dPeter looked at Oliver and threw a small amount of money.The woman threw the baby away and picked it up with her face like a dog.Oliver looked at it for a moment and then went back in the way he came.Oliver muttered at the time when no one could speak anything in that unusual atmosphere.\u201cAaaah\u2026it was beautiful.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Several weeks have passed since Oliver went to collect ingredients.As if to wash away the shock from that time, Oliver started to read the books in the study while cutting down on meals and sleep, just like a child who tried to ignore the facts that are difficult to accept.Everyone was worried about Oliver\u2019s behavior but they did not dare to say anything due to two reasons.The first was Oliver\u2019s atmosphere, which was different from usual and the second was, Oliver took care of all the necessary schedules such as emotion synthesis and classes.Even while doing his duty, Oliver still reads the book frantically, and he was able to uncover some interesting facts.For example, the consumption of emotions.Oliver stumbled upon the fact that emotions, which are energy derived from the soul, possess a kind of expiration date from the time of extraction, and the expiration date can be dramatically increased through special storage methods or black magic but eventually, it cannot avoid evaporation or deterioration.Oliver was shocked by this fact and looked whether there was any way to avoid expiration.However, even after reading almost all of the books in the library, he could not find a way to do it.What was more shocking was that even if the emotions were extracted from the human body, these emotions are like fluids so they can change over time according to their surrounding environment.Oliver felt a sense of emptiness and loss rather than joy at the above facts, even though he had studied a lot about black magic which he wanted to learn so much.Oliver felt similar to a man who had money and fame but suddenly realized that everything he had was useless once he died.Oliver felt a crisis as he thought that if emotions were to change someday, wouldn\u2019t the beautiful light that he saw in the Lightning Wizard and Joseph will also disappear someday?As Oliver silently watched the beautiful emotions in his arms that were collected from Joseph, he felt an emotion that could not be described in words.Oliver regretted that he couldn\u2019t keep this beautiful light that he barely got on his hands forever.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOliver thought for a moment.Oliver kept thinking about why he wanted to have this emotion in the first place.Once he thought about it then it felt very strange, since he had never thought of what to do with this.Oliver\u2019s action was similar to that of a child who picks up and keeps the stones without knowing what to do with them.It was literally an instinct.Oliver suddenly started agonizing thinking about what he should do with this emotion.Oliver understood that if he kept the emotion like this, it would disappear someday.Oliver thought of how he can make the best use of it.As he continued to ponder like that, he suddenly heard a knock on the door.\u201c\u2026\u2026Who is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me, Master. Marie. It\u2019s time to make pilgarets. Shall we make it ourselves? Or would you like to participate too?\u201dOliver did not answer and stayed silent.Suddenly, Oliver felt a spark in his head.Oliver rummaged through the bookshelf.\u2018It must be here somewhere.\u2019\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAfter a while, Oliver found the book which he was looking for.It was a handwritten note rather than an official book and it turned yellow because it was old.The information about the pilgarets was written in it in an easy-to-understand manner.The actual use of pilgaret, which is currently used as a drug, is a kind of sharing tool that allows someone to indirectly feel the emotions that were conveyed through the ingredients.Storing the emotions in a pilgaret will extend the expiry date of emotions by several times.Oliver looked at the writings and looked at the emotions he had extracted from Joseph as if he had finally found a way to use the emotions.Seeing that there was no answer for a while, Marie spoke again.\u201c\u2026 Master? Is there something wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026No. No. I am coming.\u201dOliver visited the studio with Marie.As he got ready to work, Oliver noticed something strange.He hasn\u2019t been paying much attention to anything since he had been distracted by something else, but he realized that he should say something before it was too late.\u201cMarie?\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201dMarie put her hand on her chest and bowed her head while answering politely.\u201cDid we originally have this much work?\u201dOliver spoke seeing more cigarettes and test tubes with emotions greater than he remembered.\u201cNo, Master. There weren\u2019t this many in the first place.\u201d\u201cThen why\u2026.?\u201d\u201cPilgaret made by Master Oliver\u2019s emotion synthesis process has been well received. So, the number of orders has increased over the past few weeks. Hence, the amount of production has increased along with the number of emotions delivered to the pharmacist.Oliver scratched his head.He entrusted Marie and Peter with the family\u2019s work as he went to read books, but something extraordinary had happened in the short time he was absent.Somehow, besides Anthony and the Dominic family, the number of people who requested to synthesize emotions kept increasing.Oliver listened to the story in one ear and let it go in another ear since it had nothing to do with black magic.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll try to finish these as soon as possible.\u201dWith those words, everyone began to do their work.Even the informal disciples were put into the work so that they could be in charge of the sub-tasks.The senior and intermediate disciples were assigned to the chemical process of mixing the secondary distillate with the emotions.Instead of directly participating in the work, Oliver observed the work of others as they were in the class and pointed out their mistakes and corrections from time to time.\u201cAdjust the fire temperature.\u201d\u201cPlease transfer the distilled liquid immediately.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not how you should cast a spell, you have to do it this way for the emotions to blend better.\u201dSubordinates in charge of each task responded to Oliver\u2019s corrections each time and carried out his orders.Of course, pointing out just once doesn\u2019t completely improve their performance but they seem to be getting better little by little.Thanks to this, the work speed was also much faster compared to Joseph\u2019s time, and it was similar to the speed of a machine, and when the work had stabilized to a certain extent, Oliver turned his head to look at the finished pilgaret.Most of the evaluations about the pilgaret were that it was of a higher quality than the one Joseph made and it was probably true since not only the other families but also the pharmacist acknowledged it.When taking the first sip of Oliver\u2019s pilgaret everyone felt a surge as if blood boiling from anger but soon the surge gets suppressed due to the calming effect brought in by the maternal love.Oliver soon realized that he, as the creator of the new pilgaret, had never tasted it.Obviously, he wanted to smoke it once before but he decided not now.Why?For the first time, Oliver wanted to taste the pilgaret using Joseph\u2019s emotions that were in his hands.Oliver wondered how to make the most of Joseph\u2019s emotions.He saw everyone working for a while but then he shook his head.That was not the best way.It was a delicate work to prevent the loss of emotions as much as possible but in any case, it was a work of mixing emotions with water to increase the quantity.Oliver wanted to taste every ounce of this emotion, even if the quantity of the emotions collected were small.Oliver felt that if he didn\u2019t make it in such a way, it was an insult to Joseph\u2019s emotions.\u2018Then how should I make it?\u2019\u2018Should I fuse the emotion directly into the cigarette? No, that would be a little difficult.\u2019\u2018There had to be a medium to prevent the leakage of emotions and bind them.\u2019As he was contemplating what to do, a memory popped into Oliver\u2019s mind.It was the time when Anthony and the Dominic family attended the meeting.At that time, a muscular man took a drug in order to get rid of Oliver.A drug made from injecting the muscle-up spell on the liquefied Life-force.Oliver found what he needed.After a while, as time passed, the work came to an end.Everyone seemed exhausted and Oliver gave them formal words for their hard work and ordered them to rest after tidying up.Everyone was happy to clean up.While everyone was cleaning, Oliver approached Marie and talked to her.\u201cMarie.\u201d\u201cYes, Master?\u201d\u201cCould you bring me some Life-force that you are keeping? If possible, bring me a fresh one.\u201d\u201cOh, yes, I\u2019ll bring it soon.\u201dFor some reason, Marie went away with great joy and soon she brought a test tube with active Life-force.\u201cHere it is, Master.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026if it\u2019s okay, can you tell me where you are going to use it?\u201d\u201cNo, Marie doesn\u2019t need to know.\u201dIt was Cold.No, it wasn\u2019t objectively cold, it was just a formal tone as usual.It was a mixture of reasonable distance and politeness but for some reason, Marie felt great disappointment and sadness at that answer.Oliver couldn\u2019t understand why she suddenly became like this since she showed her disappointment not only in her emotions but also in her expression.At that moment, Peter intervened cautiously.\u201cMaster\u2026 I have finished cleaning up everything.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it faster than usual?\u201d\u201cAh, that. We all worked together, so we finished it quickly. Do you have any other orders?\u201dOliver looked around and answered.\u201cNo. Go back and have some personal time.\u201d\u201cYes, We understand.\u201dPeter bowed his head and told the other disciples to rest and sent them out of the manufacturing room as if he knew that Oliver had work to do here.On the other hand, Marie stood there like a stone.\u201cMarie\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, Master. Is there anything you want me to do?\u201d\u201cNo. You can leave.\u201dMarie once again radiated a glimmer of disappointment along with extreme loneliness and a rather serious obsession.\u201cIf there is anything I can do to help\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. Not at all. Please go out.\u201dThe same words were repeated over and over again.In the end, Marie bowed her head and backed away.She had been like that since the time he personally taught her black magic but somehow Oliver felt like it was getting worse and worse.Soon, Oliver pushed every distracting thought out of his head along with Marie who disappeared from the room.At this moment, Oliver\u2019s greatest concern was to make Joseph\u2019s emotions into a pilgaret without any loss.Oliver took out the pack of cigarettes he had prepared in advance, the Life-force that Marie had brought, and Joseph\u2019s emotions.\u201cUm\u2026 no, no.\u201dExcited Oliver murmured as if he had realized something.He was so excited that he thought of making a pilgaret using Joseph\u2019s emotion right away without a trial.The way Oliver wants to make a pilgaret now is actually a way that no one had ever done before.He didn\u2019t know what kind of problems would arise when he actually tried to make them without a trial.Oliver felt it was a stupid idea to use Joseph\u2019s emotions right away for this dangerous experiment.Oliver took out some emotions from the studio locker.Then, he opened the test tube with emotions and Life-force, and then he started practicing it on the spot without any specific theory.The first thing he extracted was Life-force.Beautiful Life-force gathered in Oliver\u2019s hand and when Oliver clenched his fist, the life force condensed and gradually turned into a slime.Then Oliver began to extract emotions and mix them with the Life-force.Surprisingly, the Life-force blended with the emotion much better than processed distillate, and they seemed to be like one.No, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise in the first place because both of them are soul-derived energies.Rather, it made more sense to mix them together.Oliver stored this information in his head and further condensed the emotion and Life-force which had been united.As if they were boiling, they simmered and condensed to become an essence and Oliver injected the essence into one of the cigarettes.\u201cAwwww\u201dOliver looked at the Pilgaret.The emotions were successfully stored in the pilgaret with little loss and they had a strong effect because of the combination with Life-force.As soon as Oliver confirmed that this worked, he practiced it again and again.Once, twice, thrice\u2026to the point of being greedy.As a result of practicing like that, Oliver did not have much Life-force or cigarettes left, so Oliver decided to go into action.All the last remaining Life-force was extracted, energized, and Joseph\u2019s emotions were put into it.Surprisingly, as Joseph\u2019s emotions blended with the Life-force, the beautiful light that he had seen back then came back to life and Oliver looked at it as if he was possessed.At Oliver\u2019s fingertips, the Life-force absorbed all of Joseph\u2019s emotions and condensed them just like in the practice as if nothing could be lost.It boils in the air and becomes a thick liquid and Oliver puts the essence in the last cigarette.\u201cWow\u2026.\u201dThe finished pilgaret was in Oliver\u2019s hand.Oliver looked at the pilgaret without saying a word.Thump \u2026. Thump \u2026His heartbeat was heard as if they trembled slightly as he picked up the pilgaret.Oliver bit on the pilgaret and searched for a lighter.\u201cah\u2026.\u201dLater, Oliver realized that he didn\u2019t have a lighter.When Oliver was in a disappointed state, Peter started knocking on the door,\u201cmaster.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dOliver, who was furious, asked in a voice louder than usual.Peter got surprised but he calmly said.\u201cThat\u2026A guest has arrived.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Guest?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s James, the pharmacist\u2019s employee.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31When Oliver went out, he saw James waiting for him.The pharmacist\u2019s employee A, who was in the same truck as him during the decisive battle with the wizards, and the person who accompanied him while he was going to Landa.James had been waiting for Oliver at the factory.He stood out because of his distinctive chin, brown hair that was tucked back, and his stout shoulders.As soon as he saw Oliver, he warmly reached out and approached him.\u201cAh, you finally came out.\u201dOliver reflexively grabbed James\u2019 hand.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cYeah, nice to meet you. This is our first time meeting after we split up in Landa. I worked there for a while and as soon as I came here I heard some interesting stories. Is it true?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you have heard, but I think it\u2019s true.\u201dJames laughed.\u201d haha\u2026.It\u2019s amazing\u2026I didn\u2019t expect this to happen. It\u2019s really great. Should I call you Sir Warlock?\u201d\u201cNo, not really\u2026 What brings you here?\u201dOliver asked, remembering the Pilgaret he prepared.\u201cHuh? Ahhh\u2026it\u2019s not a big deal, I came to check if things are being produced properly. Boss is recently worried. Actually, there should have been a lot of orders these days. I know it\u2019s rude to ask but is there any problem?\u201cIf that\u2019s the case then there is no need to worry. We are preparing everything properly.\u201dOliver looked at Peter.Peter nodded as if nothing was wrong.\u201cI see\u2026That\u2019s good.\u201dJames nodded mechanically and scratched his chin as if he had something to say.\u201cIs there\u2026anything else?\u201dJames felt deeply embarrassed, but built some courage and then opened his mouth with determination.\u201cDo you remember the conversation we had when I took you to Landa?\u201d\u201cWhat conversation?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s because I can\u2019t really remember.\u201d\u201c\u2026You told me that if I were to teach you about wizards, you would teach me black magic\u2026..!!\u201dAt James\u2019 words, Peter and some other disciples around him were startled, while Marie watched Oliver from afar.The party involved, Oliver, was calm.\u201c\u2026Yes, I did. I remember.\u201dOliver slowly nodded his head in affirmation while James said with his arms crossed.\u201cI came here to keep that promise\u2026?\u201dAs Oliver was about to answer, Peter interrupted.\u201cMaster? What\u2019s he talking about\u2026?\u201d\u201cAs you heard. Mr. Employee\u2026\u201d\u201cJames, my name is James. Didn\u2019t I tell you last time? Call me James. Don\u2019t be so mean.\u201d\u201cAs James said, he knows a lot about wizards and if he were to teach me what he knows about wizards, I promised I would teach him black magic.\u201dAll the disciples, including Peter, were astonished to hear Oliver\u2019s decision, to teach black magic just like that.\u201d Master\u2026 that\u2019s a nonsensical deal. How could you teach black magic just like that and above all, that person isn\u2019t even a real wizard, we don\u2019t know whether what he says is true or not\u2026!\u201dPeter\u2019s behavior was understandable enough.Although the barrier to black magic is lower than real magic, the opportunity required to learn black magic was actually huge.Most of them lived a slave life under Joseph in the past and the reason why they stayed here until the end was because for them being chosen by the warlock itself was a miracle.To them, black magic was something that they can barely learn by spending a large part of their lives as slaves and servants but James was trying to touch on that noble knowledge with the ignorant things he had learned on the street.James opened his mouth in a hurry to tell them about the facts he knows.\u201cI know a lot of interesting stories about wizards because I have a lot of connections\u2026.If that\u2019s not enough, there are other stories too\u2026..\u201d\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t make sense either way.\u201d\u201cWhat do you know?Oliver interrupted Peter and said.\u201cWell? I know quite a lot about street life and Landa\u2019s back alley\u2026\u201dJames smiled awkwardly knowing that it was nonsense.But Oliver had an unexpected reaction.\u201c\u2026Yes, That\u2019s good enough.\u201d\u201cMaster?!\u201dPeter said in a hurry.\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. That man is cheating.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 but a promise is a promise\u201dPeter didn\u2019t say anything after that since he knew Oliver\u2019s thinking systems were completely different.Leaving Peter alone, Oliver said to James.\u201cThen, when will you start learning?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind learning right now.\u201d\u201cUm . . . Alright. Follow me.\u201dOliver took James down to the classroom in the basement.As he went, everyone looked at this sight strangely but no one dared to speak.After arriving in the classroom, Oliver took an emotion for the educational purpose from the shelf.\u201cFirst, let\u2019s see what you can do, shall we?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..What?\u201d\u201cAs I said, I can\u2019t do anything\u2026 No, no, not just that. I can\u2019t condense the emotions on my fingertips. I can\u2019t even see them.\u201dBoth looked at each other in an unexpected situation, unable to say anything.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026can I be honest?\u201d\u201cYes, please.\u201d\u201cI have no talent for black magic.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something I didn\u2019t tell you. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t have any opportunities to learn black magic. At that time, I simply had no talent for it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Then why?\u201d\u201cWell? Still, is there a way to learn something? I may be old, but my heart is still passionate\u2026 How? Is there no way? Aren\u2019t you the warlock who won against Joseph?\u201dOliver understood what James meant.James had the faint hope that if it was Oliver, he might have a way to teach him.Right now, Oliver was also confused.He looked for education-related books in Joseph\u2019s library to teach others but he couldn\u2019t find any.Because of that, all Oliver can do is point out other people\u2019s problems and sometimes help them indirectly.It was fine with the disciples because they were all able to open their third eye and were able to extract emotions, at least clumsily.Oliver didn\u2019t know how to teach someone who couldn\u2019t even do the basics.Looking at Oliver, James asked with disappointment.\u201cWhy\u2026. is there no way?\u201dOliver looked at him without saying a word and then suddenly stretched out his hand and covered both eyes of James.\u201cAhhhh! What are you doing\u2026!?\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201dOliver struck James\u2019s weakly resisting hand down and covered his eyes again.Oliver focused his attention on James\u2019 eyes making him enter a strange state.As Oliver began to see James\u2019 emotions more and more clearly, Oliver extracted some of the emotions stored in the test tube and then once again placed his hand on James\u2019s eyes in the same way.\u201cWhat the hell\u2026?\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dWith those words, Oliver gave strength to the hands pressing Joseph\u2019s eyes once again.The normal vision weakened as his vision as a warlock grew stronger and as the boundary was about to be crossed, Oliver forcibly shoved the emotions he was holding in his hand into James\u2019 eyes.\u201cAaaaaaaaah!\u201dJames felt a sharp pain in his eyeball and began to struggle.Oliver didn\u2019t let go of him.\u201cIt hurts! Damn, Fu*kkkkkkkkk\u2026\u2026 it hurts!!\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. It\u2019s fine. Wait a minute.\u201dJames struggled as if the pain had reached its max, after screaming for a long time Oliver finally let go of him.\u201cAaaahhhhhhhhhhh\u2026!\u201dJames fell to the floor while holding his eyes closed, he crawled on the floor moaning in pain but still he couldn\u2019t open his eyes as if he had seen a flash bomb.\u201cEyes\u2026! My eyes\u2026! What the hell did you do?!\u201dJames exclaimed as he held his burning eyes.However, as time passed, the pain gradually subsided and his vision began to get restored.\u201cWhat does this look like?\u201dOliver raised his finger in front of James who managed to barely open his eyes and asked.James replied blankly.\u201c\u2026\u2026.circle?\u201d\u201c\u2026 So, you\u2019re saying that Landa was built by wizards?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u00a0 it was built by capitalists and wizards to be exact. However, the people say that it was built by the wizards. Well, that\u2019s not a lie either. Capitalists only gave money. Rebuilding Landa was the skill of the wizards. Even a three-year-old knows.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cWhat I meant is.. almost everyone knows it\u2026Don\u2019t you know about a metaphor?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHaaa, You really don\u2019t know\u2026 Anyway, the point is that the status of the wizards in Landa is great. Their status is even greater in other places that are better than Landa.\u201d\u201cOkay. But how do you know about wizards, Mr. James?\u201d\u201cAh? Ahhh\u2026 First of all, there are many stories about wizards going around in pubs and the streets, then I\u2019ve also been hired by wizards a few times. When they needed a solver.\u201d\u201cSolver?\u201d\u201cWhen they needed someone to set fire to a fellow wizard\u2019s business or when they wanted to assault their employees.\u201d\u201c\u2026do the wizards fight a lot?\u201d\u201cUh. Smart people hate Smart people like them. It\u2019s the fear of the same species. Can I ask you a question this time\u2026.?\u201d\u201cWhat?.\u201d\u201cHow long do I have to do this?\u201dJames asked while gathering his emotions into his fingertips in the form of a squiggly circle.It can\u2019t be called a circle, in fact, it was something that anyone would be embarrassed to call a circle.\u201cUntil you make a perfect circle.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 can\u2019t you just teach the black magic right away?\u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to make a proper circle then even I can\u2019t help it.\u201dAt those words, James was greatly disappointed.James was overjoyed about successfully taking the first step in black magic so he wanted to take the next step in a hurry but Oliver calmly advised him each time.\u201c\u2026Also the true power of black magic is not in its powerful strength.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you look at the master\u2019s books in the study, it says that the true power of black magic is the third eye that pierces through the inside of the opponent and the precise technique using those eyes to pierce the enemy. That\u2019s what I think too. It will be of no use if you only think about the strength of the black magic.\u201dThere was considerable dignity in the words of a boy who looked around only fifteen years old, and James stared at him without joking like he usually does.\u201cthen\u2026.\u201d-Mr. James! Everything has been moved!Workers came out of the sausage factory and loaded the boxes of pilgarets into trucks and shouted from afar.\u201cOkay! Wait a minute!\u201dJames suddenly returned to being pharmacist\u2019s employee A, while taking a cigarette and placing it in his mouth.\u201cThat\u2019s all for today. Keep practicing circles and if you succeed try making squares.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026Square\u2026By the way, can you increase production? We will prepare the required emotions.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Aren\u2019t we already manufacturing a lot?\u201d\u201cYes, we are indeed manufacturing a lot but we might need more.\u201dMore?Oliver was a little worried.At first, the production of pilgarets which had been increasing little by little suddenly doubled and then it tripled, now it has quadrupled.That meant that Oliver\u2019s workload would increase, and it was not a happy thing for Oliver who wanted to spend his time studying black magic.Well, He almost finished reading all the books in the library anyway, so it wasn\u2019t a big problem, but still\u2026\u201c\u2026can I just think about it for a moment? The workplace now has reached its limit.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll tell the boss that way. But if it\u2019s possible, think about accepting the offer. Your items are very popular now, so you should row when the water comes in.\u201dIt was not a good offer for Oliver, who was not particularly interested in money.And there wasn\u2019t any interesting part in it.\u201cIs it popular?\u201d\u201cYeah, didn\u2019t you know?\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think the production has increased? Of course, it is because of the high demand. Supply is not coping with the demand. Your items are very popular now. No wonder the clients try to buy it from other vendors. It might be a little bit of exaggeration but it has the potential to even threaten the Black Smoke.\u201d\u201c\u2026what is black smoke?\u201d\u201c\u2026don\u2019t you know what black smoke is? Are you kidding me?\u201dWhen Oliver shook his head silently, James was stunned.\u201cYou are a warlock who sells pilgarets but you don\u2019t even know what a Black Smoke is?\u201d\u201cBecause I never learned about it.\u201d\u201cBlack Smoke is the most popular pilgaret brand\u2026 A really high-quality pilgaret. And your stuff being compared to that tells how awesome it is.\u201d\u201c\u2026.okay.\u201d\u201cCome on!! I can\u2019t even get a reaction even when I compliment. How many compliments do I need to give to get a satisfied expression on your face\u2026? Anyway, I\u2019ll tell the boss your opinion. See you next time.\u201dOliver nodded and saw James off, but James suddenly stopped and asked with a very serious face.\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\u201cPlease speak.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s funny that I\u2019m asking this now\u2026.why did you teach me so easily? Black magic. To be honest, you could have ignored me.\u201dOliver thought deeply and opened his mouth.\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I teach you?\u201dJames paused, then said with a low smile.\u201cHaha\u2026you\u2019re really a weird person.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cAnyway. See you next time.\u201dSeveral cars were marching towards the backward city of Wineham.It was the F-series, a vehicle for mass distribution and it was a model that was not strange looking from anywhere.Thanks to this, it was very popular among the middle class, who were short on money, and those who performed secret missions.They all stopped at once.After a while, a woman got out of the car.Porcelain-like skin, distinct facial features, and brilliantly blonde hair.She was a beautiful woman who looked like a painting, and her looks expressed her beauty and intelligence.No, not just beautiful, she looked holy.\u201cIs this the breeding ground for that stuff?\u201d\u201cYes, Knight.\u201dThe woman who was called knight by her subordinate spoke as she touched the cross hanging from her neck.\u201cThen, let\u2019s hurry. To destroy the evil that\u2019s spreading the evil drug.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32The pharmacist who was working at the pharmacy looked at the records of his \u2018side job\u2019 while waiting for a customer who might not come.Even if it was a side job, the income there was much higher than his original job.\u201cUhm\u2026\u201dThe pharmacist groaned as he saw the rapidly increasing number of orders in recent years.It\u2019s been long since he was engaged in this work, but this was the first time there was such a boom.The pilgaret made by combining maternal love and anger went beyond common sense as it healed the anger in the people\u2019s hearts, so orders came from all over the place.It was a situation in which they were reaching out to new customers beyond the existing ones.Some places were even willing to give them extra money so that they would sell the product only to them.Of course, he rejected all those arrogant offers, but it was good news \u2013 more people wanting the product means more business options than just profits.However, it was difficult for the pharmacist to be happy because of two reasons.One was that the supply could not be increased to meet the increased demand, and the second was that this dazzling achievement was achieved because of a boy, not by his own ability.A third-class businessman would be happy just to make a few bucks, but that wasn\u2019t the case for the first-class businessman.An achievement was something that has value only if it was achieved with one\u2019s ability.Fortunes obtained by chance could be lost by chance at any time.If Oliver suddenly disappeared, then the currently circulating Pilgaret would be discontinued, and the reputation and trust he earned until now would go down the drain.So the pharmacist couldn\u2019t be truly happy.He didn\u2019t know how long the transition would last.\u201cHmm\u2026 I want to get to know him, but I don\u2019t know how.\u201dWhen the pharmacist was thinking about the stable production of synthetic pilgaret, a jingle bell sounded.It was a guest\u201cHow are you?\u201d said the bald middle-aged man as he walked in.At a glance, he was just a man with a big belly, but his atmosphere was different.There was something strangely intimidating while seeing him smirk.\u201cInspector Harry, what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cThere seems to be something wrong with the lunch I ate, I feel so bloated\u2026 Can I get a glass of digestive medicine?\u201dThe pharmacist pulled the lever in front of the machine on one side of the counter and took a glass of digestion medicine.Then he handed it to Inspector Harry.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to help those who are working hard for the city.\u201dInspector Harry leaned forward and whispered softly as he took the cup of the digestive medicine.\u201cA firefly has appeared.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Have fireflies ever appeared in this city?\u201d\u201cNo, but it showed up yesterday.\u201dInspector Harry pulled back his upper body and gulped the digestive medicine.\u201cKya\u2026! That hits the spot. I feel like I\u2019m intentionally getting sick just to drink this.\u201d\u201cYou can have another drink.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019ll give you the money.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You are people who serve the community.\u201d\u201cEven so, he has to pay. Whatever you do, you have to pay a fair price. That\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dA third voice suddenly interrupted the two.The pharmacist and Inspector Harry turned their heads at the same time.At the door, a beautiful woman was standing with her companion.\u2018When the hell did she come in?\u2019The woman spoke again.\u201cIf you do something, you have to pay for it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know who the lady is, but I\u2019m fine, so don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not much.\u201d\u201cI am not talking about money, I was talking about justice and order.\u201dThe pharmacist was able to guess her personality through just a few conversations \u2013 The one who never bends when she thinks it\u2019s right.She seemed like the kind of person who knew only one thing and would believe that it was the truth of the world.In today\u2019s world, there are very few people like this.The pharmacist glanced at Inspector Harry and asked a silent question, and he nodded as if answering yes.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Ha, you\u2019re right, miss. It seems you have to pay, Inspector.\u201dAs the pharmacist said, the inspector took out a bill from his worn-out wallet.As he left the seat, the woman asked while blocking his way.\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cPeople of this town come here often. People who need medicine, people who need a companion for a while, or people who need a place to rest\u2026 Isn\u2019t it a small town?\u201dThe pharmacist suddenly interrupted and spoke.The woman looked at the inspector and the pharmacist for a moment, then pulled herself out of the way.\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah. Pharmacist. Have a good day.\u201dInspector Harry left the store, leaving only the pharmacist and an unidentified woman in the pharmacy.They looked at each other without saying a word, and after reading the atmosphere, the pharmacist asked.\u201cIs there anything you need\u2026?\u201dHe spoke as the woman walked over towards him.\u201cYes, I need your help.\u201d\u201cWhat medication do you need?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a drug that I need.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026 Then?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Joanna, a paladin from the Landa branch of the Parter Church. If it\u2019s okay with you, can I talk to you for a moment?\u201dAfter the pharmacist put the {close} sign on the door, he led the paladin Joanna to the resting area.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, there are only two chairs, the gentleman there\u2026?\u201dThe one who came in following Joanna shook his head as if it was okay.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. Do you want anything to drink? All I can offer is water, if not, a cup of digestive medicine. What does the Lady\u2026.Oh my, It\u2019s not appropriate to call you a lady\u2026 Should I call you Knight? Or Dame Joanna?\u201d\u201cCall me Joanna. And water is fine.\u201dAfter hearing the answer, the pharmacist sat down.It was a cramped space, so the seat was unexpectedly close.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Originally, it was a place for me to rest alone\u2026 By the way, why did a person from the Peter Church come to see me?\u201d\u201cI have a few questions for you.\u201d\u201cPlease tell me what you want. You are all the people who protect the human world from evil. If I can help you\u2026 But, I hope you can finish it within 20 minutes. It\u2019s my little pride as a pharmacist.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try to do that. The first thing I wanted to ask you is your real name. Is it Donald Mattson?\u201d\u201cYes, Joanna. But just call me Pharmacist. Everyone calls me that.\u201d\u201cI heard that you own five drugstores named Yuji (\u6709\u5fd7) and a building in Wineham, is that correct?\u201cThe name of the pharmacy is right, the land and the building are also right.\u201d\u201cYou seem to have a high reputation?\u201d\u201cI just donated money here and there to help people in need. We live in the same city, so we have to do that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. The generosity of giving one\u2019s own thing. I think it\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cThank you. My father taught me to live a life of sincerity and diligence while giving money and protecting from evil.\u201d\u201cYou are a wonderful person.\u201d\u201cNot at all. Can I know why you are asking this?\u201d\u201cAh, I just thought it would be good to get at least some basic information about the city before starting the investigation.\u201d\u201cInvestigation?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026if it\u2019s okay, may I ask what the investigation is about? It\u2019s a quiet city, as you can see.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s indeed quiet. Too quiet. But, that\u2019s unexpectedly a better location for evil to sprout.\u201d\u201cSince the paladin came, then it wouldn\u2019t be normal evil, did you find a Demon worshiper?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t tell you that. It\u2019s confidential\u2026can I ask you more questions?\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I am the one who has to answer\u2026 Please ask me.\u201d\u201cIt may sound rude, but as far as I know this city is going backward.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I want to deny it, but I can\u2019t deny it. It\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIs there any special reason why you stayed here without disposing of your property?\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026 can you tell me why you asked such a question first?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just everything is different from what I heard before I came to this land. Landa is the fastest-growing land. Everyone is gathering in Landa to look for opportunities, but the pharmacist doesn\u2019t, so is there any special reason for it? If it\u2019s a sensitive topic, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cNo. No. Not to that extent. There are many reasons, as you could see, I am not young anymore. It\u2019s hard to go to a crowded and unfamiliar land like Landa by disposing of all the properties that won\u2019t amount to much. Above all\u2026 I like the place where I was born and raised. I have memories of my father. That\u2019s why I am staying here.\u201d\u201cStill, if you hold on like this, won\u2019t the maintenance cost be higher?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. However, here I have the support of my father\u2019s friends along with my friends. They\u2019ll buy some medicines and tell me where to invest \u2013 like a restaurant or a theater. Thanks to them, I\u2019m living happily\u2026 Is that answer enough?\u201dThe woman named Joanna looked at the pharmacist with her sapphire-blue eyes and nodded her head.\u201cYes, it is\u2026 The time has come, I\u2019ll get going. Thank you for your time.\u201d\u201cYou are welcome. I\u2019m glad it was helpful.\u201dThe pharmacist opened the locked door and send off Joanna.\u201cGoodbye.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026ah! I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThe reason why I came here. Mr. Pharmacist seems to be a trustworthy person.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right if it\u2019s important.\u201d\u201cNo, I want to tell you the truth. My colleagues and I are here to find a warlock who distributes drugs.\u201d\u201c\u2026.drug?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a horrible drug that\u2019s made by squeezing emotions from people and putting them into a product called pilgaret. Lately, I\u2019ve heard that these drugs are being mass-produced here.\u201d\u201cAh, I have heard about this news\u2026but it\u2019s weird.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf there is a drug like that, then it would be more heavily distributed in Landa. If you wanted to stop it, shouldn\u2019t you have first stopped the distribution network? I don\u2019t know why you came all the way here\u2026 I think that would be much more effective for the future.\u201dJoanna\u2019s expressionless face twitched slightly.\u201c\u2026 Doing justice is not about efficiency.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I think you\u2019re right\u2026That\u2019s justice. I wish you success.\u201dAt the cemetery located on the outskirts of Wineham.There was a big commotion in the secretly installed basement.\u201cHurry up! Hurry up!\u201dAnthony, the owner of the Anthony family, quietly urged his disciples.Despite the shouting, the junior disciples hurriedly took the money out of the safe and shoved it into the glutton\u2019s pockets.Glutton \u2013 A black magic item made from human flesh, teeth, and emotions of greed.It was a useful item that could be used to carry loads that are several times heavier.Anthony asked.\u201cIs it still not over?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master\u2026we have too much money.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dAnthony couldn\u2019t say anything.He\u2019s been making huge profits lately by trading with a boy named Oliver, so he even bought another safe.Not long ago, he was very happy making profits, but now they are like the shackles holding his ankles.What\u2019s even more upsetting was, even after knowing it, he couldn\u2019t throw it away.Anthony urged again.\u201cHurry up. Faster.\u201dAt that moment, an intermediate disciple who was watching the outside through a mouse shouted.\u201cMaster! An unidentified outsider is approaching this way.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dAnthony froze in surprise.As soon as he heard from the pharmacist that a firefly (Paladin) came, he immediately prepared to evacuate, but their movement was much faster than he expected.\u201cMotherfu*kers. It\u2019s really hard to live diligently these days\u2026 Intermediate disciples share the vision with senior disciples, and senior disciples activate the prepared black magic.\u201dThe senior disciples who were waiting in line at those words got down on their knees and put their hands together as if praying.The intermediate disciple immediately put his hand on the shoulder of the senior disciple and shared his vision.Soon, through the eyes of a mouse, the senior disciple was able to see the outside world and identified that there were ten intruders.They had a large formation and were armed with high-level weapons, and they all looked like professionals.After checking the outside situation, the senior disciples used black magic as instructed by their master.[Revive]When the spell was cast, the test tubes planted around the cemetery reacted and spewed out Life-force in the magic circle that had been prepared in advance.The Life-force that has been released was used to revive the bodies that were irregularly buried around.Though the number was not sufficient, that was not the end.The senior disciples chanted the spell again.[Inject Hate][Burning Life][Terror Angry]The magic circle that reacted with the spell once again caused the test tube to release emotions, and the emotions gave hate and explosive power to the corpses.All the corpses ran towards the intruders, who were the targets of [Inject Hate].The speed was considerably fast thanks to the burning of Life-force.However, the opponents were also not easygoing.[Holy Light]Suddenly, a brilliant light erupted from within the camp and that made the attacking zombies stop all at once.The zombies that got engulfed by fire screamed in pain, while the intruders swept away the zombies with huge guns that were out-of-standard, axes and swords.\u201cMaster\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m watching. Have you got all the money?\u201d\u201cYes, we have got everything!\u201dThe junior disciples said as they carried the glutton bags which were gathered like a mountain.\u2018As the pharmacist said earlier, I should find a way to keep the money safe.\u2019\u201cAttack with the corpses again.\u201d\u201cWould it be of any use, Master?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s enough to buy some time\u2026and we will bring that.\u201d\u201cYou mean that?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. We shouldn\u2019t just run away. No matter how many paladins they have, we have to teach them not to invade the territory of a manipulation-type warlock.\u201dThe senior disciples who understood the meaning of the word revived the corpse again, strengthened it, and then attacked.This time, too, they were destroyed in the same way, which convinced Anthony.\u2018Even if there is a paladin, there is no one who can annihilate all the zombies at once.\u2019\u2018After all, it\u2019s a fairly high level. According to the pharmacist, the new girl with blue eyes probably didn\u2019t have that much skill. If she did, then she\u2019d be a genius.\u2019\u201cMASTER, we ran out of emotions and Life-force that we installed in the graveyard.\u201d\u201cThe intruders have entered through the entrance.\u201dUrgent voices poured from here and there.It was then, the voice they had been waiting for was heard.\u201cMaster, we have brought it.\u201dWhat the intermediate disciples struggled to bring was a very large coffin that could fit a giant.It was something made in preparation for any possible war.\u201cDid you take all the money?\u201d\u201cYes, we have everything. Master.\u201d\u201cGo to the place as I said. Everyone.\u201dThe senior disciple Han suddenly spoke.\u201cWhat? Master, but\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be in the way.\u201dIn the end, at Anthony\u2019s words, all the disciples ran into the secret passage.Each wore a bag full of money, and Anthony waited patiently for the intruders.He wanted to see the intruder\u2019s blood to restore his self-esteem as a warlock.After a while, the uninvited guests appeared.\u201cThere he is!\u201dBullets flew towards Anthony with muzzle flames.[Meat Shield]Anthony covered himself with the corpse.In some cases, it was more effective than Black Shield, which immediately uses a large amount of emotion and Life-force.[Revive][Obedience][Burning Rage]At those chants, the huge coffin tied in chains shook, and with a loud banging sound, it opened.From inside, rose a corpse golem made by fusing several corpses.\u201cCarrrrrrrrr\u2014\u2014!!\u201cCareeeeeeeeeeek!\u201cUghhhhhhhh\u2026!The huge central head and the eight heads around it cried as if they were one.At Anthony\u2019s call, the corpse golem stood up, and the joints that had been stiff for a long time let out a terrible scream!There were six huge pairs of arms together with several hands, each with a hammer, a knife, and an ax.It looked so vicious that it would break one\u2019s courage just by looking at it.In particular, it would be difficult to avoid it due to the narrow hallway.Anthony ordered the corpse golem to kill the intruder.DUDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!The corpse golem ran.Suddenly, as Anthony was about to get out, he felt an unusual energy.[Rest In Peace]A brighter light that could never be seen in the cemetery came out.Anthony nearly thought he went blind.He could see the corpse golem that he had put so much effort into had turned into a handful of ashes.\u201c\u2026.?!!!\u201dAs the corpse golem turned to ashes and disappeared, a woman appeared from the end of the hallway.She had an extreme beauty that did not match reality, and she wore a long coat, a circular shield in one hand, and a mace in the other.Anthony made eye contact with her in fear, but soon she disappeared from his sight like a flash of light, and suddenly she appeared right in front of him.\u201cI forgive your sins.\u201dWith those words, Anthony\u2019s eyes saw a mace.And after that, he couldn\u2019t see anything.Nothing ever after.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33\u201cNow that we have come all the way here, we\u2019ll be safe.\u201dA senior disciple muttered those words.He was someone who was in charge of the senior disciples since Joseph\u2019s time, so in a dire situation, he showed a more mature appearance than others.For example, in the current situation.\u201cIs this\u2026 a secret safe house?\u201d\u201cYes, Mast\u2026 Joseph built this place, and we\u2019ll be safe here.\u201dOliver looked around.This building was located in an ordinary housing street and appeared to be in good condition with regular maintenance.\u201cIt\u2019s a place prepared by Joseph in case of an unexpected attack or the raids of the Paladins. No one knows this place except us.\u201dOliver nodded and then asked Marie and Peter if they had evacuated everyone as ordered.Marie answered.\u201cOne, two, three\u2026yes! Everyone has followed me here.\u201d\u201cEveryone has followed us.\u201dAfter hearing the report of Marie and Peter, he went to his own room, unpacked his luggage, and ordered everyone to take a rest.This was the first time everyone was in an emergency situation, so they didn\u2019t really know what to do.There was nothing they could do other than pack up as quickly as possible according to the pharmacist\u2019s advice, and prepare according to the advice of the senior disciples.\u201cWhat\u2019s a firefly?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a paladin.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cPaladin. A knight of God made by the Parter church.\u201dOliver tilted his head.Parter church, God\u2026Oliver has never heard of it.The supervisors at the mine would sometimes say something like that whenever they see children like Oliver, [Without God\u2019s blessing, trashes like you will go to hell].Even though he knew the situation was quite urgent, Oliver still was curious nonetheless.\u201cWhat is Parter church, what is paladin, and what is a God? Can you explain?\u201dConfusion bloomed on the face of the senior disciple.It was like having difficulty with a child, who keeps asking what the sun is and what\u2019s water.\u201cUh\u2026that\u2019s\u2026so\u2026\u201dThe Senior disciple didn\u2019t know how to properly explain it.Oliver, who grasped the situation, said it was okay, and ordered him to rest.\u201cMaster?\u201dWhen the senior disciple left and Oliver was about to rest, Marie quietly approached.\u201cWhat Marie? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWill it be okay like this, Master?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 we\u2019re running away without taking any money or books?\u201dAs soon as the note saying [Fireflies has arrived. Get everyone out of the base] came from Pharmacist, Oliver ordered everyone to pack a minimum amount of luggage and get out of the base.He didn\u2019t know what the details were, but the pharmacist just told them to go, so he just depended on his own judgment and feeling.The first thing that came to his mind was to take emotions.Of course, the money he has recently earned was thanks to that.He didn\u2019t even take the books.Well, he had already read almost all the books, and he had enough money to spend, but Marie doesn\u2019t seem to think so.\u201cIf we leave like this, we will definitely lose all our money and books, so why not go and get it now\u2026? If the studio gets destroyed, it would be difficult to do business for a while.\u201dAt Marie\u2019s suggestion, Oliver shook his head.\u201cUm\u2026 No. Money is important, but life is even more important, right?\u201d\u201cI, I will go.\u201dOliver tilted his head.\u201cMarie? Why?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I want to be helpful to Master.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cMaster, I want to help you. If it goes like this, the damage will be huge. It costs quite a bit of money to set up a manufacturing room. If it continues like this, all of Master\u2019s hard work will go to waste.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u2018Hard work?\u2019Oliver looked at Marie, unable to understand what she was trying to say.He couldn\u2019t understand why she wanted to do it.Oliver remembered what he had done until now.When he returned after killing Joseph, he somehow managed to take over the family in a short time, he then spent most of his time reading books, making Pilgaret, and teaching black magic.Everything was easy as if he was lucky.He did everything to read books.There was not any hard work or anything.So, he couldn\u2019t understand why Marie was thinking about the studio over her life.He realized that perhaps it has something to do with the emotions of obsession and adoration that she exudes now.\u201cUm\u2026 it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cHa, but\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really okay. It\u2019ll be alright. Rather than that, could you go with someone and check where the secret passage is leading? Just in case.\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s words, Marie bowed her head in response.\u201cYes. I will, Master.\u201d\u201cOkay, thank you.\u201dAfter Marie left, Oliver thought to himself.It\u2019s not like Oliver didn\u2019t understand anything of what Marie was trying to say.He got enough money, but that was according to Oliver\u2019s standards.Even Oliver knew that it was a very small amount when compared to the whole.Nevertheless, Oliver decided not to care.Oliver didn\u2019t know what kind of existence the firefly (Paladin) was, but from the words of the people around him, from the message of the pharmacist, and from the records of Joseph, he could deduce that they were like a kind of natural enemy that was quite opposite to the warlocks.So Oliver was just going to wait for the predator to disappear.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. But, on the other hand, he was also curious.What kind of existence are they to be called the natural enemies of the warlocks?Maybe they are beings who can tell him about the beautiful light that he saw.These two conflicting thoughts collided inside Oliver.One was the survival instincts that wanted him to lay low to survive.The other was the curiosity to satisfy the desire for knowledge.Both greatly influenced Oliver.As the two thoughts collided, a silent war broke out within Oliver, and at that moment, someone approached him.\u201cMaster\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026what is it?\u201dBecause of the little war that broke out in his head, Oliver responded later than usual.The disciple misunderstood that Oliver was upset, so the disciple who was about to speak was even more scared.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. But, I really think I should tell you the news.\u201d\u201cOkay. Please feel free to speak. What is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Dominic, the owner of the Dominic family has arrived.\u201dOliver thought the disciple must have been mistaken, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case.Dominic, the owner of the Dominic family, who controlled the wineham along with Joseph and Anthony was in the basement of the safe house that Joseph had prepared.They were confronting Marie and the others in the basement with only four of them.They didn\u2019t appear to be fighting with emotions or black magic.In fact, Oliver greeted them warmly when he went down.\u201cHey, you\u2019re not dead, you\u2019re still alive.\u201d\u201cYes, how are you?\u201dOliver spoke as if he had met a neighbor.Marie and the others, who were nervous, quickly found peace at Oliver\u2019s appearance, which made them relieve their guard.\u201cI think you came here to say something\u2026 is that right?\u201d\u201cOh, You knew it.\u201d\u201cBefore that, can I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cMay I ask how did you find this place?\u201dDominic had a puzzled look when he heard Oliver\u2019s question.\u201cAre you curious about that in such a situation?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026yes.\u201d\u201c\u2026haaa, Fine. It\u2019s not a big deal. Every safe house has a basement and a tunnel. In most cases, they are connected to each other so that you can run away when needed. I came by searching for such places through the sewers.\u201d\u201cI see. Did you use black magic?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes. We used [Sensible Nose], a specialty of our disease-based black magic. It can dramatically enhance the sense of smell. Using this we can follow the smell of people even in the stinky sewer.\u201dOliver stored that information in his head.Although he neglected to explore black magic due to many recent curiosities, he couldn\u2019t deny that exploring black magic was fun.\u201cWow\u2026..\u201dDominic\u2019s face showed dissatisfaction looking at Oliver\u2019s pure admiration.His impression of Oliver kept worsening, but still, he didn\u2019t show outright displeasure.Instead, his emotions turned more cunningly than before.\u201cSo, can I tell you why I came, now?\u201d\u201cOf course, feel free.\u201dDominic looked at Oliver for a moment, then opened his mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t know whether you know, they got Anthony.\u201d\u201cYou mean the head of the Anthony Family?\u201d\u201cYes. Is there anyone else other than him in this situation? The paladin or something went straight to his place, so he couldn\u2019t avoid them. I\u2019m pretty sure since I heard it directly from the disciples who escaped.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I see.\u201dOliver responded without showing any interest in the news.Dominic, who didn\u2019t like Oliver\u2019s response, blew up with anger.\u201cWhy are you acting as if it\u2019s someone else\u2019s business!! After Anthony, we\u2019ll be next.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t everything be fine if we just hide?\u201d\u201cNo. Those Paladin fu*kers are mostly tenacious. After all, they are God\u2019s fu*king noble hounds, once they were given order, they would follow it blindly until finishing it?\u201d\u201cUm, I see\u2026 Do you happen to know about the Paladins?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cCan you tell me about them? Because I don\u2019t know much about them.\u201dBANG!Dominic smacked the wall with his bloodshot eyes.The force with which he punched the wall was so strong that a minor dent formed on the wall, and the building shook slightly along with crumbled dust falling from the ceiling.\u201cAre you kidding me now?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I was really curious.\u201dDominic glared at Oliver hearing his answer, frowning even more.A cold silence filled the space.After a while, Dominic spoke again.\u201cAnyway, the paladins are ruthless motherfu*kers. They won\u2019t leave this place easily. Even Anthony got hit. So, we don\u2019t know when this sh*t will come to an end.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hit them first.\u201d\u201cBut the pharmacist told us to hide because he\u2019ll solve it himself\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre we that old man\u2019s servants?!Dominic was half right and half wrong.It was true that the pharmacist made a lot of money thanks to the warlocks, but at the same time, the warlocks were also able to procure the ingredients and easily cash out the product without much difficulty, thanks to the pharmacist.In addition, he also took care of all the other small cleaning up, but it was not a matter of arguing, so Oliver asked without dwelling much into it.\u201cThen\u2026 are you going to fight?\u201d\u201cYeah! Why should we have to be afraid of those fu*kups in the first place?!\u201d\u201cBut, I heard they have the upper hand when fighting warlocks\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, if we work together, we can win. All the disciples from Anthony\u2019s side came to my side, so the actual combat power will be equal. If Oliver\u2019s family also joins us then we can bang those motherfu*kers\u2026 what do you say\u2026.?\u201dDominic stopped speaking after looking at Oliver raising his hand quietly.Oliver answered calmly.\u201cAh, I have a few things to tell you. First of all, the name of our family is not the Oliver family but the Joseph family.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026. What?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t change the name. First of all, it\u2019s a family established by Master, and I\u2019ve only been in charge of it for a while.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of dogsh*t\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd secondly, I have no intention of fighting.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026! Why?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous enemy, do we really need to fight?\u201d\u201cAre your ears clogged?! I said they are going to chase us to the end?!\u201d\u201cThen, why don\u2019t we keep running until they go away?\u201d\u201cFU*KING CHICKENSH*T!\u201dPTOOEYDominic growled and spat in Oliver\u2019s face.Oliver didn\u2019t show any reaction despite getting spit on his face.He just wiped off the spit on his face.If being a coward could keep him alive, Oliver didn\u2019t mind being called a coward.Dominic changed his posture.\u201cThen what? While we fight them covered in blood, are you guys going to have a tea party?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so, but I\u2019m grateful\u2026 Maybe, I\u2019ll repay you in some other way\u201d\u201cThis fu*ker. I\u2019m going to Fu*king kill him right now\u2026!\u201dDominic, who approached Oliver not being able to contain his anger, stopped suddenly.A shadow tentacle was holding his ankle.\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m not sure, are you planning to fight with me now?\u201dOliver said politely, showing his palms as if calming the other person.His demeanor was very polite, but the shadow tentacles that wrapped around Dominic\u2019s ankles were as strong as the roots of a thousand-year-old tree.All of a sudden, the disciples of both sides took a fighting stance and the tension between them grew.Oliver asked again.\u201cCan you please try to understand?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Everyone, let\u2019s go back.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get going! We have to fight against the paladin soon, so we don\u2019t have time to play with these cowards.\u201dAt those words, the disciples of the Dominic family loosened their posture reluctantly, and the disciples of the Joseph family also followed them.Oliver released the shadow tentacles that were holding Dominic\u2019s ankles.\u201c\u2026Once I deal with those motherfu*ers, it\u2019ll be your turn. JUST WAIT.\u201d\u201cThank you for your understanding. I will greet you differently next time.\u201dDominic looked at Oliver with a disgusted expression as Oliver greeted them, after which, everyone from the Dominic family returned through the secret passage they had come through.Ultimately the visit came to an end and all the disciples in the basement took a deep breath.\u201cIt\u2019s all good. I thought something serious was going to happen.\u201d\u201cMe too\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have any problems.\u201d\u201cGet ready to go.\u201dIt was the voice of Oliver who intervened softly.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t feel good about this, and it could be dangerous to stay here, so pack the bags again and get ready to leave this place.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dNo one said anything.Everyone looked at Oliver with strange expressions on their faces.Marie came to her senses and opened her mouth.\u201cWhat are you all doing?! Master says we should move!\u201dHearing Marie\u2019s words, everyone came to their senses and began to move.Peter came over and asked.\u201cWhere are we going, Master\u2026?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Are there any other safe houses?\u201dThe senior disciple nodded at Oliver\u2019s question.\u201cYes, there are two or three. They are less well maintained and farther away from here.\u201d\u201cGood. Take everyone there.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 I have somewhere else to go.\u201d\u201cWhere, Master?\u201dMarie cut into the conversation and asked with startled eyes.\u201cI\u2019m going to follow the Dominic family.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThey said they\u2019re going to fight with the paladins, so I\u2019m going to see what kind of beings they are.\u201dMarie gave Oliver an absurd look, but for Oliver, it was a revolutionary idea.Observing the paladins who will be fighting the Dominic family while secretly hiding.It was the best compromise that could satisfy Oliver\u2019s curiosity while minimizing the risk.However, for some reason, Marie didn\u2019t seem to think so.\u201cMaster, but it\u2019s too risky.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m confident that I can hide well. Everyone, please take shelter in a safe place.\u201dMarie\u2019s emotions fluctuated rapidly.Negative emotions such as confusion, fear, worry, etc. started popping up one after anotherIt was on the same level as a person fighting a battle or a person on the verge of death.Oliver couldn\u2019t understand why Marie was exuding such emotions.\u201cI will only take a few test tubes, so you can take the rest with you. Where is the test tub\u2026\u201dSomeone grabbed Oliver\u2019s hem.It was Marie.\u201cMarie?\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll come with Master. At least take me with you. It\u2019s too dangerous to go alone.\u201dOliver looked at the hem of his robe.Surprisingly, Marie\u2019s emotions shone brighter than ever before.Her emotions flowed through her fingertips and even made contact with Oliver\u2019s body.It was an interesting reaction.Oliver didn\u2019t know why, but he wanted to know more about it if he had time.But now there was something even more important than that for Oliver.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Marie.\u201d\u201cThat, but\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m more comfortable being alone. I have to move quickly and covertly.\u201dAt those words, Marie\u2019s hands dropped down.\u201c\u2026are you saying that\u2026. me\u2026. I\u2019ll be\u2026 getting in the way?\u201dMarie\u2019s emotions fluctuated fiercely.Negative emotions started shining more than before.Disappointment, despair, fear, self-hatred.Muddy feelings from unknown roots rose up.Oliver looked into Marie\u2019s eyes and said.\u201cUm\u2026 that kind of interpretation is also possible\u2026. Everyone, please evacuate carefully.\u201dSaying those words, Oliver left.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34As soon as he stepped out of the building, Oliver concentrated the energy on his eyes.As pressure intensifies, the vision of a normal human becomes more and more blurred, but, the vision of a warlock who sees emotions becomes more and more clear.As if looking down the street from the sky, Oliver could feel all the emotions inside the sewer.As Oliver concentrated even more without stopping, he was able to find Dominic and his men, who were moving along the underground sewer system.Dominic\u2019s men exuded intense emotions, such as discontent, anger, regret, etc., which made it easier for Oliver to track them.The more intense the emotions were, the easier it was for Oliver to track them, and using those favorable conditions Oliver caught up with Dominic.Oliver moved in the ground while following Domic and his men moving in the sewer, and soon Dominic and his men reached a street that Oliver had never seen before.It looked more like a maze than an alleyway, and it seemed like a place that felt somewhat similar to a place that Oliver had seen before.As Oliver thought about it, he soon remembered that it was similar to District X in Landa which he visited with Joseph.A slum with weak security.Though it can\u2019t be compared to District X in Landa, it was still a dangerous place.Soon, Dominic stopped moving.No, he came up from the sewer.CREEE\u2014\u2014\u2014K!Dominic came out by opening the huge manhole in the corner of the slum.Oliver hid in the alley and completely erased his presence using black magic.[Erase Exit]A Stealth magic using the emotion shame.Oliver first encountered it in Joseph\u2019s study, although it was an ambiguous black magic that erases one\u2019s presence, its effect was surprisingly great.Oliver just tried to see if what was written in the book was correct, but to his surprise, even Dominic couldn\u2019t feel his presence and just looked around.\u201c\u2026 Hmm?\u201d\u201cWhat is it? Master?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026no, nothing.\u201d\u201cBy the way, it was very unfortunate, Master. I thought we would be fighting together.\u201d\u201cWell, it can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s a little messed up, but we\u2019ll go as planned. If we can take down that Paladin, the momentum will be ours, then using that momentum we\u2019ll strike down that Oliver basta*d as planned.\u201dAs planned?Dominic\u2019s subordinate spoke carefully.\u201cHowever, no matter how sudden the situation is, even the Anthony family ended up like that, would it be easy for us, Master?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of compatibility.\u201d\u201cCompatibility?\u201d\u201c Manipulation-type\u2026. Especially, command black magic that Anthony specializes in is particularly weak against paladins. Because that magic can be easily purified by the Paladin\u2019s Law of nature power. But, that doesn\u2019t work on us. Since we will be using living beings instead of corpses. We can resist the Law of nature to a certain extent\u2026\u00a0 you all have prepared enough drugs, right?\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026 We have collected enough drugs as well as gangsters to fight. Since our profits have increased a lot recently, there were no problems with the recruitment of gangsters.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good, but it\u2019s also sad at the same time. I never intended to use the money in this way, but, in this situation, it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d\u201cMaster. Is it really okay without the firepower of the Joseph family?\u201d\u201cIt would be great if we had the support of Joseph\u2019s guys, but it is out of option now. The lack of firepower can be filled with doped gangsters\u2026 It\u2019s fine this way. I was planning to capture Oliver anyway, now I can use the pretext that they didn\u2019t do anything as a reason to capture him and there will be no one to argue with us.\u201d\u201cWhat if the pharmacist made a move?\u201d\u201cA guy who did nothing but stood still when the Paladin attacked has no qualification to speak. Even if he tried to move, things would be different when he realized the situation. Think about it. Soon, we\u2019ll be the only black wizards they can ask for help. How can they attack us?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cOnce we kill the paladin and then catch Oliver, we\u2019ll be the only ones who can make Pilagaret. He\u2019ll have no choice but to follow us. After all, he\u2019s a guy that moves based on profit.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s brilliant, Master. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re using this crisis as an opportunity.\u201d\u201cYes, Master. It\u2019s a really great plan. You\u2019re thinking of killing the paladins to increase the family\u2019s reputation, and then capturing Oliver and making him a slave. It\u2019s like killing two birds with one stone.\u201dDominic pointed to his forehead and said.\u201cThe real power of a warlock comes from here. Oliver is a cheeky guy, but he has a knack for making pilgarets. We will kill all his men and take him after breaking both of his legs. Then, the high-quality Pilgarets that\u2019s being produced now can only be made by us.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great\u2026but Master, wouldn\u2019t there be any backlash if we kill a paladin?\u201d\u201cWe can bribe the top through the pharmacist. When it\u2019s settled, we just need to leave this town and move to another place. As long as we have the name of killing a paladin and the skill to produce high-quality pilgarets, we can settle down anywhere. Once we expand our power, the next step will be to increase our influence in Landa.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026!\u201dAt Dominic\u2019s words, all his men exclaimed in admiration.Oliver only nodded his head after silently hearing the details.He doesn\u2019t know why, but he felt that Dominic\u2019s words were an empty pipe dream.However, Dominic\u2019s men, who were persuaded by those words, immediately gained courage.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s move, this will be the first chapter of Genius warlock Dominic\u2019s legend!\u201d\u201cYes, Master!\u201dDominic and his men entered the alley.Oliver also moved along with them.However, he thought it would be dangerous to just follow, so he decided to pursue them in a different direction.Oliver carefully extracted the emotions.He casts obsession-based targeting magic towards the top of the building where he was currently hiding and then casts the same obsession-based targeting magic on his own body.Then, the two targeting magic attracted each other like magnets and slowly lifted Oliver to the top of the building.After reaching the top of the building, Oliver directed his power to his eyes and followed Dominic\u2019s movement.He followed him through the buildings until Dominic entered a condominium.There was laundry hanging between the buildings, but it looked like an abandoned place.About 20 people were gathered inside the building, and there were about 50 people around the building.The condition of everyone looked very strange.They exuded a sense of pressure and exhalation, that\u2019s normally found before the beginning of the battle.It seemed like fighting against a paladin was not easy as Dominic said.\u201cUmm\u2026\u201dOliver was troubled.At first, he tried to watch in moderation and leave, but seeing how much preparation they had made, he became curious.Oliver lay down on top of the building.From that position, he extracted the emotions and created a minion.He made it smaller than the usual minion so as not to be detected and cast [Erase Exit] and [Eavesdropping ears] magic on it.Soon, the minion\u2019s presence faded and a pair of ears sprouted.\u201cLook around and listen.\u201dOliver sent the minion down along the shady wall with those words.After a while, he could hear the conversation around the building.\u201cReally, it\u2019s not a big deal, right?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear about it? It\u2019s like we\u2019re dealing with as*holes.\u201d\u201cThen why are they giving us so much money?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with having a lot of money? It\u2019s good, right?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem right\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think too deeply about it. From what I heard, the warlocks here seem to have made a fu*king load of money lately, and there are rumors that they are planning on creating an organization. It\u2019s a kind of admission test.\u201d\u201cAdmission test?\u201d\u201cYeah, just checking whether we are doing what we\u2019re told and checking whether we have the strength to fight\u2026 What\u2019s the problem? They\u2019re even giving money, weapons, and potions. If you\u2019re really scared, get out now. I\u2019m trying to fix my life now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2026 What kind of potion is this?\u201d\u201cThis is a drug that makes you stronger and this is a drug that eliminates fear. As long as you don\u2019t overuse it, there are almost no side effects.\u201d\u201cDo you believe it?\u201d\u201cThis basta*d really\u2026 Did you forget that everyone around here buys doping drugs at this place? If you\u2019re going to be a pus*y then get out of here!\u201d\u201cOkay. Okay. I\u2019ll stop.\u201dOther than this, the conversations in other places were also similar.The gangsters outside the building were apparently here without even knowing the details.If they think a little, they might notice something strange. However, the fact that they can join a stable organization with a lot of money seems to have clouded their judgment.Oliver found it interesting since it seemed possible to deceive people with such a hollow method.Oliver overheard the stories around him and waited for a while in the building.The sun started setting down.\u201c\u2026 Oh, it\u2019s cold.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t you feel the cold?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Shut up, the warlock told us to stay like a dead mouse, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cOkay, okay.\u201dAs the sun went down and night fell, the hired gangsters waited while conversing a little.Everyone was very bored while some even snored.Oliver understood how they felt.It was harder than he thought to just sit still and do nothing.At that moment when Oliver thought that the paladin was not coming today, he felt a strange presence.Oliver opened his half-closed eyes and focused again.A strange emotion appeared in the distance.The number was twelve.I was not a normal passerby.They all had a sense of tension and exhalation,similar to the gangsters here, but at the same time they were calm and composed as if they were confident that they would win.There was a unique type of emotion felt from among the group.It felt like an emotion that Oliver had never experienced before.An emotion that\u2019s filled with very pure belief and self-confidence.The emotion was so pure that it felt like a white drawing paper.Oliver was immediately intrigued by the clean emotion he had seen for the first time, soon his dull mind and body immediately revived.Oliver wondered what it was.[Shade Cloak]Oliver extracted a small amount of emotion and made a thick, dark cloak and flipped it over like a blanket.It was a stealth black magic that hides the body in the dark.It has the disadvantage that it can only be used at night or in the shade, but at the same time, it was a good magic that had the maximum effect with the minimum emotion if the conditions are met.Oliver poked out his face and looked down.Oliver wasn\u2019t the only one who noticed the stranger\u2019s arrival, the gangsters woke up one by one due to the loud noise.\u201cDid they come? Is it those guys?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, don\u2019t be scared. How many people are there?\u201d\u201cWe can do as we\u2019re told. But why is there a woman among them?\u201cA gangster, who seemed to be the captain, came out into the street alone and blocked the path of the strangers.\u201cHey, stop. Who are you?\u201dThe strangers stopped.The gangster spoke again.\u201cThis is not a place for anyone to enter. If you\u2019re on the wrong road then go back quickly. If you have something to do, then come back tomorrow.\u201dThe strangers showed no reaction.\u201cHey, are your ears clogged?\u201dAt that moment, a woman, who possessed a pureness different from the others, came forward and opened her mouth.\u201cIs there a warlock here?\u201d\u201cFu*k\u2026 What the hell? Who are you?\u201d\u201cDid you come here knowing that there is a warlock here? If you\u2019re just hired then we\u2019ll give you a chance to repent your sins with God\u2019s mercy. Everyone drop your weapons and get down on your knees.\u201dAt the woman\u2019s suggestion, the gangster\u2019s emotions slowly changed from tense to anger.\u201c\u2026you have such a pretty face, but you turned out to be such a crazy bi*ch? What are you?\u201d\u201cPaladin Joanna from the Parter church of Landa branch. In the name of God, I\u2019ll tell once again. Including you, all sinners around here, please drop your weapons and surrender. Then, God will forgive your sins and show you mercy.\u201d\u201cAh, really\u2026. What fu*king God are you talking about? Is it that dogsh*t God who gave us this miserable lif\u2026.\u201dBang\u2014-!Suddenly, with the sound of gunfire, the gangster, who the strangers were talking to, fell to the floor.The bald man who was next to Joanna made the shot.\u201cHow dare someone like you disgrace our God\u2026\u201dAs soon as the gangster turned into a dead body, the surroundings became quiet as if it was struck by a cold storm.However, it was only for a while.Soon, someone shouted.\u201cIt\u2019s an attack!\u201dFollowing the shout, the gangsters who were watching the situation jumped out toward the strangers with their weapons.They intended to tear the strangers to death, but the strangers remained calm, which showed that they are far from being frightened.One of the strangers shouted.\u201cLady Knight!\u201dThe woman named Joanna, surprisingly, showed an emotion of sadness, but soon it got overlaid by her inner resolve.[Ready For Battle]A brilliant light covered the surroundings at the woman\u2019s spell.Everyone was dazzled by the dazzling light, but as soon the light faded, all they could see was the strangers heavily armed with iron coats and various weapons.Joanna who was holding a shield and a mace said.\u201cIn the name of God, I forgive your sins.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35The battle was one-sided.It couldn\u2019t even be called a battle?It could be said, it was a fight between a child and an adult.The number of paladins was twelve, whereas the gangsters were fifty.However, the flow of the fight went in favor of the one in fewer numbers.The Paladin\u2019s side crushed the gangsters with physical abilities that could easily surpass any ordinary people.Each time the Paladins wielded their weapon two to three gangsters fell by default, and whenever their unique cross-shaped gun fired, at least four to five gangsters had holes in their bodies.On the other hand, all the attacks of the gangsters were blocked.The gangster\u2019s crude guns and clubs were intercepted by the paladin\u2019s hexagonal shield before they even reached their bodies, hence causing no damage.In other words, it was a one-sided battle.After more than half of the gangsters were defeated on all sides, the remaining gangsters realized the seriousness of the situation and drank the drugs in a hurry.\u201cEveryone! Take the drugs! They\u2019re not the fu*king idiots!\u201dOne of the gangsters shouted and drank two drugs at the same time.Gulp. Gulp. Gulp.After a while, the drugged gangster\u2019s skin turned red, he started to grow taller, and his muscles swelled to an astonishing extent.It reminded Oliver of the skinny dog that he saw in the battle with the wizards.Other gangsters hurriedly drank drugs in response to his overbearing appearance.\u201cUmm\u2026that looks a bit dangerous.\u201dOliver thought as he looked at the drugged gangsters.Obviously, their strength has increased by leaps and bounds, but it was so severe that he could tell by looking at the body that it was all worn out.It seemed like Dominic thought of using these gangsters only once.\u201cThese poor people\u2026\u201dSurprisingly, paladin Joanna, as if knowing what was going on, showed a sympathetic expression towards the gangsters who were trying to attack the paladins.She was truly a strange woman in the eyes of Oliver.Before and during the fight, she neither did feel exaltation nor anger during the battle, only had emotions of duty and sorrow.Oliver wondered.How can she have such emotions on her, and why does she fight even though she doesn\u2019t want to fight?Oliver found her fascinating.The drugged gangsters began to run, half lost and salivating.Joanna looked at them calmly and brought the mace to the shield.[Lamp light]With those words, a light strong enough to blind the eyes for a moment engulfed the space.Even Oliver who stood afar closed his eyes, not to mention the drugged gangsters.They clasped their eyes in agony, and at that moment when they became defenseless, Joanna and her companions moved swiftly and cleared all the gangsters.\u201cPlease rest in our father\u2019s arms\u2026 Mallelujah.\u201dShe said as she drew a holy cross with the blood-stained mace.As Oliver saw her, she felt more and more strange.Just a while ago she resolutely smashed the heads of the gangsters, but now she was drenched in sorrow and regret, reciting prayers to comfort the dead.It felt like something unnatural \u2013 Like carnivores eating grass and herbivores eating meat.Oliver became more and more curious.What is Parter church, what is a paladin, and what is that woman named Joanna?More and more questions piled up like a mountain as Oliver began to think.Oliver felt a kind of joy surging inside him.It was the joy of living in the world trying to solve your questions and doubts.Then, suddenly, a question came to him.Is the Dominic Family so confident with only this much preparation?At that moment, the surrounding wall broke, and a human-like monster came out from the rising dust.\u201cWatch out \u2014\u2013!!!!\u201dThe monster was someone Oliver knew.It was Dominic\u2019s subordinate.The subordinate who previously grabbed Marie\u2019s neck.He had grown almost four times that of his original body, and with his muscular arms bulging out with blood vessels, he swung his iron fist towards the paladin.His powerful wall-breaking fist shattered the hexagonal shield and smashed the opponent to one side of the wall, while another warlock jumped out of the opposite wall and kicked the paladin who came running, down to the floor.BANG\u2014\u2014!\u201cRichard\u2026!!!\u201dSomeone shouted as he looked at his colleague who had fallen to the floor like a bursting tomato.But there was no time for mourning.Because the people doped with various black magic and drugs by the Dominic family poured out from all directions.The Paladins, who showed an overwhelming strength and fought against the gangsters up until now, struggled and hesitated.The Anthony family also joined in and casted [Revive] magic on the dead gangsters and turned them into zombies.The only one who wasn\u2019t struggling was Paladin Joanna.Others other than her were struggling due to surprises, sieges, and melee attacks.Right at that moment, Dominic appeared.[Inject Hate!!][Inject Fury!][Burning Life!!][Abnormal Built!!!][Inject Anger!!][Muscle Up!!!]Oliver couldn\u2019t count the number of enhancement magic used by Dominic.Life-force and emotions spurt out of the test tube that Dominic held in both hands, then they mercilessly strengthened not only the zombies but also Dominic\u2019s subordinates.The dark and red energy covered all zombies and gradually turned them into inhuman monsters, and they all rushed toward the paladins.It was a mud fight with numbers and strength.The Holy Paladins were pushed to the defense one by one, and it seemed that it would be difficult for anyone to be safe.Oliver was able to understand where Dominic\u2019s confidence comes from, but he soon realized that this thought was also a mistake.[Divine Protection]Joanna shouted, stacking her shield and mace.In response to her call, a strong protective shield was created not only for herself but also for her colleagues.Contrary to its pretty appearance the soft yellow shield was as strong as the sun making even Dominic\u2019s subordinates as well as the zombies who had lost their senses falter.But there were also those who had courage.A warlock gathered energy into his fist and threw out a dark red fist.BANG\u2014-!A sound loud enough to shake the world resounded, and Joanna\u2019s shield shook.But unfortunately, it was the attacker\u2019s fist that got burned.As if seeing a possibility of defeat, Dominic cast another round of spells.[Reduced Intelligence][Berserk]Again, intense emotions erupted from the test tubes and covered all the allied zombies and warlocks.The warlock\u2019s intelligence dropped noticeably, and with the drop of intelligence their fear disappeared, and soon their muscles stretched beyond their limits while ripping through their skin.It was like they can tear a person apart with bare hands.Dozens of zombies and augmented warlocks began to attack the group of paladins in a berserk state without stopping.Even when they burned and melted.bang \u1173! bang! bang! bang! bang \u1173! bang\u2014! bang! bang! bang! bang! bang! bang \u1173! bang! bang! bang! bang! bang! bang \u1173! bang! bang! bang! bang! bang !The shield gradually shook at the successive attacks, and the burning of the attackers continued.Although, while attacking, both the zombies and the warlocks burned and turned into a terrible shape, it will be difficult for the paladins to be safe if it went on like this.It was clearly a difficult situation but strangely, the paladins were surprisingly calm.After a while, Oliver found out why they were calm.[Purify]With that cry, the holy shield burned and exploded in all directions.The yellow light was beautiful but also so powerful that it instantly turned the zombies and the doped warlocks into ashes.Not only that, but it also burned a significant number of Dominic and Anthony\u2019s families\u2019 disciples that stood far off.The minions Oliver placed all around them also burned down and all of this happened in an instant.Seeing the overwhelming firepower, Dominic hesitated and at that moment, Joanna came out through the holy flame.She resolutely swung her mace and crushed Dominic\u2019s head.Puck \u2014\u2013!The details were unknown because the minions were already burned, but it was clear that Dominic had lost.\u201cUm\u2026\u2026.\u201dOliver looked down at the building.The few surviving warlocks abandoned their dead masters and fled.There was no longer any will to resist.Oliver thought that the paladin Joanna and her party will finish the day by chasing after the fleeing remnant.Oliver understood why the pharmacist told him to run away.The Paladin named Joanna was the strongest being Oliver had ever met.\u201cNo\u2026she isn\u2019t the strongest?\u201dOliver muttered as he recalled the unidentified being he encountered in his battle with Joseph.\u2018Was it the old man on horseback?\u2019Either way, Oliver\u2019s judgment was not wrong. As the pharmacist said, she was an opponent to run away from, at least for now.Oliver was about to go back after achieving his goal, but at that moment, he got goosebumps from the back of his neck.[Black Shield]As soon as the Black Curtain was deployed, a powerful bullet flew and hit the shield.Oliver was shocked.The black shield that blocked many attacks got destroyed in a single attack.Another shocking thing was how they found out he was here.As Oliver wondered since he completely erased his presence, suddenly someone answered the question in Oliver\u2019s head.\u201cThe [lamp of God] was able to track all evil beings.\u201dSuddenly, he heard a sound and when he turned his head, he saw Joanna who came flying over to him.The woman, who far surpassed the human limits, swung her mace as she spoke.\u201cI forgive your sins.\u201d[Black Shield]x3Oliver created the black curtain once again.It was a triple shield, however, as soon as the mace touched the shield, the shield surprisingly easily broke.It was the same Black Shield that had withstood guns as well as many bombs.\u201c\u2026!\u201dOliver widened the distance in surprise and asked.\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d\u201cIn the face of the power of the Holy God, all your skill is powerless.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 is that so?Oliver saw the light on the tip of the mace.\u2018Is that God\u2019s light?\u2019Joanna aimed at Oliver with a mace.\u201cAre you a warlock?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI speak with divine mercy. Surrender.\u201d\u201cSurrender?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Repent for your sins, and receive salvation to wash away your sins.\u201dJoanna\u2019s words were sincere, but Oliver did not understand what sin he had committed.He wanted to ask but soon realized that he had no time for it.Joanna\u2019s companions were flocking towards him right now.\u201cCan I ask what happens if I say no?\u201cI will be giving judgment on behalf of God.\u201dAt Joanna\u2019s resolute words, Oliver nodded.\u201cUm, then\u2026 Cling Spider Web.\u201dOliver shot a black spider web from his hand.Joanna responded right away.[Holy Light]The holy light burned the web in the air, but it didn\u2019t matter.Oliver just wanted to earn some time.Oliver jumped out of the building while casting targeting spells on the building in the distance and on his body.Oliver quickly flew to the building, as if pulled by a rope.Bang -!The building and Oliver collided with each other as he moved in haste and fell straight down.[Spider Web]Before falling, a web of emotions was spread underneath, and he soon fell on it as if it was a safety net.And then he started running away.His whole body ached from the shock, but he was in a situation where he could die if he stopped, so he forcibly endured the pain.Tolerating pain was also one of Oliver\u2019s specialties.\u201cThis!\u201dOliver lowered his head as he entered the corner.All of a sudden, a Paladin appeared while wielding a sword and almost cut off Oliver\u2019s head.\u201cYou rat\u2026.\u201d[Hate Bullet]Oliver fired three bullets of hate toward the one who was about to swing his sword.Surprisingly, before the bullet of hate pierced the body, a hexagonal shield spread and blocked it, and the paladin got thrown away due to the impact of the attack.Oliver ran away again in the meantime.\u201cHe is here!\u201dThe paladin got up again as he shouted and followed Oliver right away.Oliver fell behind in terms of physical abilities, so he turned again and took a stance to attack.\u201cIt won\u2019t work!\u201dA shield was deployed in front of him.It seemed to be impossible to break through with the same attack as before.So, Oliver used a different attack than before.[Las Bomb]The bullets of hate containing the bomb of rage flew quickly and set off an explosion.The scream could be heard along with the explosion.\u201cAaaaaaaaaah__!\u201dOliver could avoid the pursuer, but he ended up giving his location.The paladins who had been scattered around the area rushed to the place all at once.With Oliver\u2019s running skills, he thought he would be soon caught.So, he decided to take a gamble.Oliver covered his body with the black shield as if he was wearing a black suit, and then casted the target spell on the tallest building close to him, and then put a target spell on his own body.The two targeting spells pulled each other as intended and led Oliver to the top of the building.At that moment.Bang\u2014\u2013!With a loud gunshot, Oliver\u2019s chest felt excruciating pain as he fell.Thanks to the black suit he wasn\u2019t seriously hurt but the gun and the fall hurt his whole body.But it didn\u2019t matter.So far, it was within his expected range.Oliver looked around and started running again.More and more pursuers came, and then he ended up in a dead-end alley.Oliver, with his back against the wall, extracted a mass of emotions, he made a mass of minions along with Las Bomb and Las Bullet and hid them in a corner.Not only that, he also applied black magic to the shadows to prepare shadow Vines and shadow spikes, and he prepared to pour out dozens of black darts by placing target magic everywhere.Soon, Oliver sensed a large number of Paladins approaching.He was going to pour all the magic all at once and crush the shield with overwhelming firepower.But as they came a few steps closer, they suddenly stopped.As if waiting for something.Oliver noticed that something, a bit late.\u201cThere is nowhere to run anymore.\u201dJoanna appeared from the building.She radiated intense light from her entire body.The intense and sacred light destroyed all the black magic that Oliver had prepared and Oliver who had not been flustered under any circumstances was astonished at this moment.\u2018Why such a thing is even possible?\u2019As the light faded, Joanna\u2019s companions appeared and surrounded Oliver.Oliver saw no way out.After a long time, the word death came to his mind, and at that moment, the pilgaret made with Joseph\u2019s emotions came to his mind.\u2018Ahh\u2026 if I had known it would be like this, I would have tasted it sooner.\u2019\u201cAh\u2026 that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be hard on yourself. We would have found you anyway.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2026..\u201dTHUDSuddenly, something fell between Oliver and Joanna.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026 This?\u201dOliver covered his eyes with his arm.A flash of light burst out in front of him.\u201cThis way! Master! Here!\u201dA familiar voice was heard.Oliver ran in the direction of the sound.As he walked a little, something grabbed his ankle.\u201cGet down, get down! Get down!\u201dAs instructed, Oliver lay down and crawled somewhere.\u201cMarie\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, It\u2019s me, Master. This is the sewer! Are you safe? Follow me!\u201dOliver followed Marie and ran through the sewer.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Patter! Patter! Patter! Patter!Oliver closed his eyes due to the aftermath of the flash bomb and continued to follow Marie\u2019s hand.Fortunately, thanks to covering his eyes early on, his vision soon returned.When he opened his eyes, all he could see was a damp stone wall, stagnant water, a rat that was scurrying around, and Marie who was supporting Oliver.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Marie?\u201d\u201cYes, Master!\u201d\u201cHow come you are here\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry for breaking the order to run away, Master. If there is a punishment then I\u2019ll accept it after we get out of here safely.\u201dOliver looked at her feelings and knew she was sincere.She was genuinely feeling guilty for not listening to Oliver\u2019s orders even though she eventually saved Oliver\u2019s life.\u201c\u2026how did you get here?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t escape leaving Master, so I followed you. The pharmacist found out the location of this place, and I got the sewer map and some supplies.\u201dIt was only then Oliver understood.It was the pharmacist who supported Marie with the flash bombs earlier.\u2018Did he foresee this situation?\u2019\u201cBut I was lucky. I met Master when I arrived just in time\u2026 God must have helped me\u201dOliver felt it ironic.A God trying to kill him and a God that was trying to save him.Suddenly, Oliver recalled the unidentified being he saw at Joseph\u2019s Secret Altar.Something embodied by fused corpses.\u201cOld man on horseback\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat Master?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 nothing. You did something dangerous.\u201d\u201cI will take the punishment as soon as we escape.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. You saved me.\u201dAt those words, Marie\u2019s eyes widened, and her face turned red.Oliver\u2019s words made even her ears turn red.\u201cWe have to go back through this side.\u201dMarie said as she went down a side road.\u201cHere\u2026?\u201d\u201cWineham sewerage is complicated because of several rough developments. With a little twist, they won\u2019t be able to catch up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 It doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s the case.\u201dOliver said as he concentrated with his eyes, checking the paladins who were chasing him from various directions.They seemed to know the geography of the sewer quite well, so they spread out and chased after them.\u201cIf we go this way, we will meet them soon. Is there any other way?\u201dOliver asked while stopping Marie who continued walking.Marie hurriedly took out the map and checked it.\u201cUh, then\u2026 this way!\u201dOliver followed Marie\u2019s instructions.Fortunately, they were able to avert one crisis, but that didn\u2019t mean they were completely out of the crisis.Whenever they thought that they had widened the distance, another paladin party narrowed the distance and came in their direction.If it continued like this, Oliver and Marie will be caught in the end while continuing to play tag.Something more aggressive was needed.\u201cMarie, do you have any emotions left? I almost used mine.\u201d\u201cYes, I have brought one.\u201dMarie pulled out a test tube.As soon as Oliver received the test tube, he focused his attention on his eyes.There were 10 people in total.They came in groups of five, but fortunately, because of the support, Paladin Joanna was chasing after her comrades from the very back.It wasn\u2019t a bad idea, but thanks to that, she was actually in the back.Oliver extracted the emotions, mimicking the [Obedience] spell he had once seen in the past, he applied it on a rat that was running around.Squeak! Squeak!Fortunately, it was not very tricky magic, and Oliver continued to indiscriminately apply the obedience spell on the rats he saw and created a small group.Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!\u201c Is this\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt might get us some time.\u201dWith those words, Oliver stopped walking and cast the spells again toward the rats that were moving around him.[Fighting Spirit]The rats under the spell had the courage to attack people, and at Oliver\u2019s gesture, they split into five groups and ran towards the chasing enemies.As he said earlier, it bought some time, and that was enough for Oliver.\u201cMarie!\u201dOliver started running like crazy with Marie.He ran so fast that he himself was shocked, but nevertheless, he did not neglect preparations in the meantime.Six Hate Bullets and three Black Javelins.After a while, as he turned at the corner, he could see a group of three paladins trampling on the rats in confusion and Oliver shot out the prepared six Hate bullets.\u201cDamn it!\u201dThe paladins defended themselves by deploying the shield.As expected, the Hate\u00a0bullets were blocked, but Oliver didn\u2019t mind and threw a Black Javelin one at a time.The Black Javelin with a penetrating effect pierced through the enemy\u2019s shield and dealt damage while Oliver and Marie ran past them.As everything went smoothly, Marie said with respect.\u201cAwesome, that\u2019s great, Master!\u201d\u201cNo, they are coming this way. Can we get out if we just pass through this passage?\u201d\u201cYes, Master! There is a way to the ground, and it is safe to hide there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad. Then\u2026\u201dOliver started making several minions by extracting emotions to slow down the enemy\u2019s pursuit.He prepared Las Bullet, Las Boom, and Creepy Scream, respectively, and scattered them on the floor like land mines.\u201cMaybe this could buy some time.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dMarie exclaimed with joy.\u201cThis way, Master. If we turn around here, we can go out\u2026 huh?\u201dAfter running for a while and turning at the last corner, Marie\u2019s eyes grew wider as if the eyeballs would pop out.This was because the passageway through which they could get out was blocked by a hard iron gate.\u201c This is\u2026\u201dMarie made a bewildered expression when she saw the huge iron door that didn\u2019t seem ordinary.Oliver tried knocking on the iron door, but it seemed like a very thick door.Oliver soon felt perplexed.He couldn\u2019t break this huge lump of iron with the emotions he currently possesses, and even if he were to take out Marie\u2019s emotions, it was dangerous to use black magic with that much power in such a closed space.In short, they were like a mouse trapped in a prison.As if to signal this, a small explosion was heard along with a terrible scream that broke people\u2019s will.Kyaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahhahahahah.Kwagwang\u1173\u1173\u1173! Bang\u2014\u2013!Minions sprinkled by Oliver worked.It seemed like they did a lot of damage to the paladin\u2019s side, but it did not stop them from chasing.\u201cMaster, Master!\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cUse my emotions.\u201dOliver looked at Marie.She was sincere and determined.However, as Oliver thought of using black magic, a paladin who turned all black magic into nothing came to his mind.She was able to neutralize all of Oliver\u2019s black magic for a moment with her dazzling light.\u201cUm \u2026 No, it won\u2019t be of any use anyway. There is a paladin who just negates the dark magic. So, It\u2019s just a waste to extract emotions from Marie.\u201d\u201cBut we can\u2019t just sit around like this.\u201dThat was true. However, that was the reality.Paladins\u2026.were strong, very strong, while warlock\u2019s compatibility with them was the worst, very worst.Oliver felt very strange, even though he was about to die.What he felt was more of a regret than fear.There were still so many things he still wanted to know. As Oliver tried to recall the things he wanted to know, suddenly an important fact popped into his head.\u201cMarie\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes?! What is it\u2026 Master?\u201d\u201cDo you have any lighters or matches?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cA lighter or a matchbox.\u201d\u201c\u2026ah, yes, but why?\u201dOliver pulled out the Pilgaret that he had kept in his pocket.It was the Pilgaret made with the beautiful light that Joseph emitted before his death.\u201cCan I borrow a lighter?\u201dMarie showed an absurd expression at Oliver who was trying to smoke a Pilgaret in this dire situation, but still, she nodded her head as if she was prepared for anything.\u201cThat\u2026if it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019d like to light it up, Master.\u201d\u201cAh, well\u2026 Okay.\u201dOliver answered and put the Pilgaret in his mouth, Marie suppressed her trembling hands, and politely ignited the Pilgaret.It was Oliver\u2019s first time tasting Pilgaret.As he took a deep breath, Joseph\u2019s emotions, along with the smoke of the cigarette, entered Oliver\u2019s body.\u2018Is this how it feels?\u2019There was a deep silence, and Marie opened her mouth more cautiously.\u201cEven though we have come this far\u2026.it was truly an honor to have met you master\u2026.thank you so much.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOliver did not answer and remained silent as if he was thinking deeply about something.After a while, the footsteps got louder and louder and soon a group of people appeared.Paladin Joanna came along with her companions.It seemed like everyone had a hard time with the minions that Oliver had planted, while a few seemed to have had a worse time.Maybe that\u2019s why except for Joanna everyone seems to be in a state of anger.\u201cWe got you, you rat\u2026 You knew this would happen, and you still plugged some ratholes in the sewer in advance.\u201d\u201cStupid guy\u2026 Did you think we have never dealt with guys like you?!\u201dMarie thought they weren\u2019t very good at cursing, but she had no thought of pointing that out.In any case, it was true that Oliver was in danger.Marie pulled out a crude gun and stood in front of Oliver.She was pointing a gun at those who wiped out gangsters and warlocks.\u201cHaa\u2026 Haaa\u2026\u2026\u201dMarie\u2019s breathing became rough due to tension.Reluctant to see her like that, one of the paladins quickly grabbed a cross-shaped gun and pulled the trigger.Bang \u1173\u1173\u1173\u1173\u1173\u1173\u1173\u1173!Gunshots echoed from the sewer, blood splattered, and\u00a0people fell.The two warlock\u2019s heads fell into the pool of water.It should have happened like this, but, surprisingly, it didn\u2019t.An unknown tentacle sprouted from the bottom of the sewer and protected Marie.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.uh?\u201dMarie and the paladins both saw the unidentified tentacles and shouted out loud.It didn\u2019t seem like shadow-based black magic\u2026?It was similar but different.Upon closer inspection, it wasn\u2019t just a simple shadow, it was something way darker.It was like an abyss in the night sea.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone felt this change and retreated back due to the unknown existence.Of course, not everyone.Oliver stood still.\u201c\u2026 Ahhh. This\u2026what is this?\u201dOliver murmured.His expressionless face trembled strangely, and he continued to say something incomprehensible.\u201cWow, really\u2026is this? Pilgaret?! I can feel it. I can feel it\u2026! The sadness, anger, hope\u2026 longing! Joy!! Regret!!! Everything\u2026 ! I can feel it all!!!\u201dOliver\u2019s dead fish eyes widened, and he looked at the Paladins.Even though they knew it was a shameful act for them, for a moment everyone felt fear when they saw Oliver\u2019s maddening appearance.Including Paladin Joanna.Everyone, including her, instinctively noticed that Oliver was different from other warlocks.Although they couldn\u2019t explain it in words, everyone thought of him as an ominous creature that must be killed as soon as possible but no one could act hastily.It was like they saw an unidentified entity, so they moved with utmost caution.In the midst of such a heavy and terrifying silence, a man with a cross-shaped gun shouted and raised his gun.\u201cAaaaah-! Die! You devil!\u201d[Hell Summon]Oliver extracted his emotions in an instant and scattered them on the sewer floor.Dark emotions covered the entire sewer as if they were multiplying, and it not only covered the sewage but also the paladin party.It covered everyone as if applying paint.The speed was so fast that there was no time for anyone to pull the gun or resist.They were all just eaten by the darkness.[Divine Protection]It was only paladin Joanna, who resisted by activating the Holy Light.It was the sacred shield that was used when fighting the Dominic family.Furthermore, it was a powerful technique that could protect not only herself but also her allies, but for some reason, the shield became meaningless in front of Oliver.The light shone for a moment to save those who were eaten by darkness, but soon, the light lost its power and disappeared.Everything was swallowed up in darkness again.Joanna saw it and cried out again.[Purify][Imprison]The holy flames which could burn everything were about to burn the darkness, but the darkness enveloped the explosion at Oliver\u2019s gentle gesture.Then Joanna got swallowed by the darkness, and all that was left was her mouth and one eye.\u201c\u2026\u201dOliver walked over to her and looked at her without saying a word, waiting for her to say something.Joanna\u2019s emotions swallowed up in the darkness were instantly tinged with fear, but still, she opened her mouth as if she was prepared.\u201c\u2026 Oh, our Holy Father. Thank you for sending your children to this earth and for giving them duties. Although I cannot fulfill the glorious mission that you have given to me, I believe in you and ask for mercy. Therefore, please have pity on these children and hold them in your arms, and I earnestly hope that you will take care of the children that will be left behind.\u201dLooking at Oliver with the only remaining eye, Joanna said proudly.She excluded a beautiful light different from what Oliver had seen from the lightning wizard and Joseph.Oliver stretched out his hand towards her and said.[Deep Sleep]Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37In a dark place, behind the alley, Oliver was sitting while waiting for someone.People didn\u2019t come here because of the fighting that took place during the night, but it was only for a while.Oliver thought he could hear the humming of a car, and soon a headlight shone through the alley.\u201cIs he here?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe car stopped, and the two people got off as they spoke.Both were familiar voices, one was Marie and the other was the pharmacist\u2019s subordinate, James.\u201cWe are here, Master.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 damn, so it was true, and here I thought it was fu*king bullshit.\u201dJames with a mask on his face looked at Oliver and said tiredly.To be precise, he saw the group of Paladins piled up behind Oliver.\u201cHello, James.\u201dOliver got up and greeted him.James greeted him nervously while looking at Joanna and her men still in disbelief.\u201cUh\u2026 is everyone dead?\u201d\u201cNo, They just fell asleep.\u201d\u201cSleep? No, okay. Don\u2019t explain\u2026 How the hell did a warlock defeat the paladins\u2026 And why didn\u2019t you kill them?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want to kill him.\u201d\u201cOh? You don\u2019t want to kill them? They were trying to kill you, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cStill, I didn\u2019t want them to die. That\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t things turn difficult if a paladin were to die?\u201dOliver said as he recalled the conversation of the Dominic family.Those brave people also assumed that they would have to leave the city after killing the paladins.It was not wrong, so James couldn\u2019t deny it.\u201cWell, okay. That\u2019s not wrong. If a paladin dies, it\u2019ll be a lot more annoying\u2026 But if we were to let them go like this, that would also be troublesome. What are you going to do?\u201dOliver looked at Joanna, who was in a deep sleep.\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m going to talk first.\u201d\u201cTalk? Are you trying to convince them not to pursue you?\u201d\u201cWell, I want to do that too, and I also have a question that I want to ask her personally.\u201d\u201cYou are seriously going to talk. Don\u2019t get me wrong, listen\u2026 Are you crazy? She is a Paladin while you\u2019re a Warlock, both are like a cat and a mouse. How on earth are you going to talk?!\u201d\u201cWhen we first met, we exchanged a few words, but now we\u2019re having conversations\u2026 wouldn\u2019t it be possible like that?\u201d\u201cOh, my God.\u201dJames has found a god.It was ironic indeed.Oliver really seemed like he was seeing everyone equally.\u201cHow are you going to convince them?\u201dSuddenly, a third voice intervened.However, this was also a familiar voice.It was none other than the voice of the pharmacist.\u201cBoss\u2026\u201d\u201cThey look fine. Aren\u2019t they sleeping like a bird over there?\u201dThe pharmacist took off his mask effortlessly.Despite James\u2019s reluctance, he approached and spoke to Oliver.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you once again, how are you going to convince that girl? I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the kind of person who\u2019s easy to communicate with.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026well? Actually, I didn\u2019t really think much about this part.\u201dIt was a shameless answer. However, the pharmacist didn\u2019t get angry, instead, he just smiled like it was funny.\u201cThat\u2019s like you. Well, fine. Playing tricks is my specialty\u2026 First of all, let me make one thing clear. You shouldn\u2019t have come in contact with the paladins. If you had run away as I told you, it would have ended in a much more peaceful way. In a word, you are stupid. \u201dAt his words Marie got angry.\u201cPharmacist, mind your words. Master isn\u2019t your subordinate. He doesn\u2019t need to do what you say?! They were persistent, and would it have been resolved just by running away?!\u201dMarie got angrier when Oliver was insulted.When James tried to say something, the pharmacist raised his hand and stopped him.\u201cOh, my, I made a mistake. I apologize. Surely, I spoke too harshly to my business partner\u2026 But, there\u2019s also the unfairness. I didn\u2019t just tell you to run away. It was to buy time. Did you think that I\u2019ll keep my hands in my pocket and wait until my precious business partner goes bankrupt?\u201dMarie gave a look as if what he was saying doesn\u2019t make sense while Oliver just had his normal face.The pharmacist turned his head toward Marie and said.\u201cWhy, lady? Is it surprising? I was negotiating with the Parterians by hiring someone on my own. So I wanted you to stall the paladins.\u201d\u201cIs that possible?\u201dOliver asked in a surprised tone.Oliver couldn\u2019t think that such a deal would be possible when he saw Paladin Joanna.\u201cThere are bound to be weaknesses in any organization. Especially, if it\u2019s an organization that has been existing for more than two thousand years. It doesn\u2019t make sense for them to dispatch Paladins here in the first place. Is it possible to send a precious paladin to such an underdeveloped place because some pilgarets were sold? That too, a girl who could be a genius? No.\u201d\u201cA genius?\u201d\u201cYeah, genius. I heard that she was a genius girl raised at the Parter school. She possesses a lot of strength and faith. The fact that she knocked out Dominic and Anthony in an instant is proof of that. Those guys are not easy opponents.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026, I see.\u201d\u201cYeah, for such a genius girl to come here, this is nothing but a conspiracy by another competitor who didn\u2019t like our growth. Some political forces inside the Parter church took bribes, and dispatched them to stop our business.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I see\u201dOliver nodded as if he wasn\u2019t interested in the story.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m so glad that you didn\u2019t kill her and just suppressed her. If you had killed her, then it would have led to irreversible results, but since you captured them, it\u2019s a negotiable deal\u2026 No, we are the ones who have the upper hand now. If that girl fails, there are quite a few people who will bleed.\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand\u2026so what\u2019s the point?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to take that girl and negotiate with the head of the Landa branch. At this point, it\u2019s possible to get rid of the paladins and tell them to leave our business by giving a small amount of money. And, we won\u2019t get hurt any more than this. What do you say?\u201d\u201cOkay, fine.\u201dThe pharmacist smiled at Oliver\u2019s quick response.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you answered quickly\u2026can I say one more word?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnyway, Since I\u2019m here to help you, can I take this as you owing me a favor?\u201d\u201cOwing a favor?\u201d\u201cIt means that we are friends. A friend who helps another when in need\u2026\u201dOliver looked silently at the pharmacist and Joanna.After a while, he answered.\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201dOliver was in a safe house owned by the pharmacist.In addition to Oliver, there was also Marie, a senior disciple, and James, who was a subordinate of the pharmacist.Oliver watched paladin Joanna and her men along with James and Marie while the pharmacist was negotiating with the Parterians.James and Marie were nervous at first, but now they have relaxed a little.Of course, it was not like they were being careless with the passage of time.It was because of another reason.\u201cDamn, can you really see all the rooms at the same time?\u201dJames said as he practiced extracting emotion while sweating hard.\u201cYes, it may be a bit confusing, but I can indeed monitor everyone.\u201dOliver answered with one eye closed.Currently, Oliver synchronized his vision to the visions of the minions and watched over paladin Joanna and her team who were bound in solitary confinement.In addition to the minions that were sharing their vision, Oliver also placed 3 minions each with Las Boom and Las Bullet, and perhaps because of that, they were relatively relaxed.James, who succeeded in extracting emotions said.\u201cAhhhh\u2026 How can you do all that alone\u2026? Here I am having a hard time just to stabilize these emotions?\u201dThe emotion in James\u2019 hands got stabilization.At that moment, Oliver indirectly helped James by giving him a hand.\u201cThis is how you do it. Can you feel it?\u201d\u201cOh, I can feel it. Thank you.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a big deal. You couldn\u2019t extract emotion until recently, but isn\u2019t it possible now? If you keep going, you\u2019ll be able to do what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\u201cAww, thank you. I wish I was stupid enough to believe those words\u2026.\u201dAfter saying sarcastically James once again focused on the emotions in his hands.\u201cOkay. Now try to maintain the emotions that way.\u201cHow long!\u201d\u201cAs long as you can.\u201d\u201cIs that not difficult?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s okay?\u201dAs James and Oliver talked like that, someone knocked on the door.\u201cIs it you Marie?\u201d\u201cYes, Master. May I come in?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen permission was granted, Marie carefully opened the door and entered.\u201cI have something to report to you, Master.\u201d\u201cIs the paladin awake?\u201dOliver, who was looking through the minion, asked.Marie nodded her head gloomily in surprise.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Did they talk?\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be willing to talk, but they seem to be in good shape.\u201dOliver nodded mechanically.\u201cExcuse me, James. I have some business to do. Can you practice on your own?\u201d\u201cUh, of course\u2026but I\u2019m very curious, what are you going to talk about with the paladin?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to touch her?\u201d\u201cTouching her\u2026what do you mean?\u201d\u201cSo. You\u2026 no, I was wrong.\u201dJames waved his hand as if asking Oliver to forget it, and as Oliver was about to leave, James called Oliver once again.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry to bother you, but can you please answer me this? I\u2019m very curious. Why didn\u2019t you kill the paladins, and why do you want to talk with her? Is there any special reason?\u201dOliver paused as he thought for a moment and then opened his mouth to answer.\u201cBecause it was beautiful\u2026\u201d\u201cBeautiful\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s true, but\u2026 I never thought you would be a character who gets attracted by beauty\u2026.. No, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sorry that I asked. Ahh\u2026 I feel weird when I am talking to you.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes! Just don\u2019t cause problems.\u201d\u201cOkay, I understand.\u201dLeaving James in the room, Oliver went with Marie to the basement where paladin Joanna was located.Since they were on the second floor they had to go through the hallway and the first floor, and while passing through, the disciples and the pharmacist\u2019s subordinates bowed their heads as soon as they saw Oliver.Most of them were sincere, not pretentious, and Oliver reflexively asked Marie.\u201cWhy is everyone doing that?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Master.\u201d\u201cThey seem to be having respect towards me.\u201d\u201cBecause you are a great warlock who defeated the paladins single-handedly.\u201d\u201cIs that a big thing?\u201d\u201cYes, Master\u2026 I swear this is a huge thing.\u201dMarie\u2019s words were sincere.Oliver recalled the words of the Dominic family, who also said something about gaining fame by killing paladins.\u2018Um, it might be because they are strong people.\u2019Oliver exhaled, not knowing the weight of his achievement.He didn\u2019t know how great it was to defeat the Holy paladins by himself.\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cYes, Marie?\u201d\u201cCould you please allow me to ask a question?\u201dOliver stopped because he could feel the seriousness in Marie\u2019s voice.\u201cPlease speak.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of black magic was that you used in the sewer?\u201dIt was an unidentified black magic that conquered the paladin Joanna and her party at once.Absolute darkness that dominated the space and suppressed those who opposed it.Oliver, who had a faint memory of that time, tried to use the same black magic again but was unsuccessful.It seemed like it can be used only by using Oliver\u2019s own emotions.\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d\u201c\u2026you don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMarie became silent.Oliver looked at her and asked.\u201cWhy are you asking such a question?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about what kind of person you are, master.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t know much about Marie either.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dOliver looked at Marie\u2019s feelings.It was difficult for him to understand her, but he could see that she had emotions of regret, disappointment, and sadness.He would have ignored her normally, but Oliver could not ignore Marie who came to his rescue during a desperate crisis.\u201cUm\u2026 we\u2019ll talk later.\u201d\u201cMaster?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk about who I am and who Marie is. I also have something to thank Marie for.\u201dMarie didn\u2019t answer but kept her mouth shut and she bowed her head.She was happy, but Oliver didn\u2019t know what she was happy about, he felt that she was truly an incomprehensible person.\u201cExcuse me, can I go now?\u201d\u201cYes, yes Master! Sorry for wasting your time.\u201d\u201cNo. Thanks to you, I survived. Take a break.\u201dMarie bowed her head at those words, and Oliver entered the paladin Joanna\u2019s room which was at the far end of the basement.\u201cHello?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38\u201cHello?\u201dOliver said as he opened the door and walked inside.Joanna, who was on the bed, looked at Oliver without responding.But he didn\u2019t care because he could see her anger, resentment, and doubt through her emotions.Oliver brought a stool next to her and sat down next to her, and greeted her again.\u201c\u2026 Hello?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hello, how are you?\u201dSQUEAK.Joanna answered by raising her arms that were bounded by chains.\u201cSorry. I thought it was exaggerating too, but other people say that this is the only way to put their minds at ease\u2026 Are you feeling very uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cNo, not really. I can break them whenever I want.\u201d\u201cWell, since you are a paladin you could do that. However, in that case, the black magic prepared here in advance will be activated along with the ones in other rooms, and it will be your subordinates that may get hurt.\u201dJoanna noticed this too, so she looked at Minions with a bitter expression.She wanted to get out of here right away, but she couldn\u2019t because she was worried about her colleagues.This made Oliver curious.How did such a person fight, how could she be so brave in the face of death, how did she radiate such a beautiful light\u2026There were so many things he wondered about.\u201cFirst of all, Let me introduce myself formally. My name is Oliver. Nice to meet you.\u201dOliver stretched out his hand, introducing himself as kindly as he had practiced. However, the only thing that came back was a cold gaze.\u201cWhat are you doing right now?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I just want to talk.\u201d\u201cTalk\u2026? I don\u2019t know what you are trying to do, but it\u2019s useless if you\u2019re trying to get some information out of me or mess around with me. I will not be deceived, and I will not yield to any form of torture.\u201dShe spoke in a thorny tone, what she said was sincere and for some unknown reason, she was very wary of Oliver.\u201cI didn\u2019t come to get any information.\u201d\u201cHow can I believe you?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Is it possible that you are being wary of me because I am a warlock?\u201d\u201cYes, could there be any other reason?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really curious, is there anything wrong with being a warlock?\u201dJoanna, who had turned away from Oliver\u2019s gaze, frowned and met his gaze. For some reason, she felt very uncomfortable.\u201cDo you see me as a fool? Or, are you making fun of me right now?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m not thinking of you as a fool or mocking you. I just want to talk.\u201dJoanna stared at Oliver without saying a word.She then slowly opened her mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t you know that you make harmful drugs and put people in a pit of sickness?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 are you talking about Pilgaret?\u201d\u201cYeah, you mean you really don\u2019t know how many people are being harmed by the drugs that you make?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 It\u2019s only been a little while since I became a Warlock.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lie!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a lie. Whether you believe it or not, that\u2019s the truth\u2026 Anyway, as far as I know, Pilgaret isn\u2019t all that harmful. At best, it is said to be used as a replacement for the cigarette\u2026. as a medicine.\u201d\u201cEven so, drugs are drugs, and don\u2019t tell me that you don\u2019t extort other people\u2019s emotions to make them?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not extortion, we buy with money only from people who want to sell them.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that it is alright to lure the poor with money to take their emotions out?\u201dAt that moment, Oliver thought about the woman who had lost herself and her child due to the excess extraction of all maternal love.\u201cUm\u2026 no. I don\u2019t think so. They took out too much, and she became broke due to that. It\u2019s indeed sad.\u201d\u201cSo.\u201d\u201cSo in the future, when extracting emotions, I will try to extract an appropriate amount without harming them. Like people donating blood.\u201dAnger and disgust appeared on Joanna\u2019s face.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d\u201cIs that so? I\u2019m sorry. But I\u2019m glad I could talk to you\u2026 Just in case, if the warlock didn\u2019t produce such drugs, you wouldn\u2019t hate them anymore, right?\u201d\u201cAre you seriously asking me that?\u201d\u201cUm, yes\u2026 I want to know why you hate warlocks so much.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like Warlocks because they don\u2019t hesitate to harm people and worship evil demons for their own desires. Their very existence itself represents evil.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026wouldn\u2019t there be some kind-hearted warlocks too?\u201d\u201cIf there are winged pigs in this world, maybe there would be good warlocks.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I have never seen pigs with wings\u2026 Ah, is it a metaphor? Sorry, I don\u2019t quite understand such things.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. There is no such thing as winged pigs or good warlocks in this world. Why? Are you going to deny it?\u201dOliver pondered for a moment.\u201cNo, Even though I don\u2019t worship Demon, I still kill people when I need to.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026!\u201dJoanna scoffed at his words.\u201cBut everyone is like that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you too kill people when you needed to?\u201d\u201c\u2026 What kind of nonsense are you saying?\u201d\u201cUm, I\u2019m sorry if I offended you. However, the orphanage director, Mine supervisor, Innkeeper, Warlocks, Wizards, Master\u2026 all of them were trying to kill me if necessary.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo I thought it was fine. Killing people if necessary\u2026 So I killed the waitress, Tom, the gangsters, the wizards, and my Master. Is it wrong?\u201d\u201cOf course! What do you think of life?\u201d\u201cBut, didn\u2019t you Paladins also kill all the gangsters?\u201dAt that moment, Joanna\u2019s heart skipped a beat briefly, as if his words stabbed in a sore spot.\u201cIt was\u2026 it was inevitable. They were sinners who worked with a warlock, and they didn\u2019t even listen to my last advice to surrender, which I ordered upon God\u2019s mercy. It was inevitable.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dOliver nodded his head. Then he spoke again.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but who judged that it was inevitable?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cDid God say that?\u201d\u201cAre you blaspheming our God now?!\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t really know anything about it\u2026 But, isn\u2019t God someone who sees everyone equally, whether they are Paladins or Warlocks or Gangsters.\u201d\u201cHow dare you speak as if you know everything?! Are you ridiculing the will of us Parters who dedicated our lives to protect the human world from warlocks and demons? Even all the countries agree!\u201d\u201c\u2026 In other words, God didn\u2019t specifically tell you anything? At least you haven\u2019t seen it?\u201dJoanna\u2019s beautiful face got twisted in anger, but she couldn\u2019t say anything.She was very agitated because someone had asked her the very question that had been troubling her all this time.\u201c\u2026 Is your goal to destroy my faith with that sassy tongue of yours?\u201d\u201cNo, no\u2026 To tell you the truth. I like the way you are now.\u201dJoanna frowned and looked back at Oliver.Oliver couldn\u2019t organize his thoughts, so he quickly gave a rough explanation.\u201cUm, I don\u2019t know how to explain this, but I really like you, Miss Paladin. You looked beautiful.\u201d\u201cHow dare you say such dirty words\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? Ah, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with it, but I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that your emotions were so beautiful, and it looked amazing\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhy did you become a paladin?\u201d\u201c\u2026 what are you trying to ask?\u201d\u201cAs you may know, I\u2019ve been looking at Miss Paladin\u2019s battle with the gangsters. You don\u2019t even like to fight, so why do we fight so much? Whenever someone goes to a battle, they all tend to get drenched in the pleasure of victory, the superiority of being strong, and the desire to destroy, but Miss Paladin had only a blank paper-like belief. You were sad even when you defeated the gangsters.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cI wonder what the reason is. Why are you fighting?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I do not fight because it\u2019s fun, but because it\u2019s a duty. Because someone has to do it.\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s why you were able to stay calm when you were about to die?\u201dJoanna was agitated at that moment.She remembered when Oliver\u2019s emotions swallowed her in the darkness except for one eye and mouth.\u201c\u2026what the hell was that?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe darkness that covered the sewers. Although this is my first official mission, I\u2019ve never heard of anything like that.\u201d\u201cUm, You don\u2019t know either. Actually. It\u2019s my first time extracting such emotions, so there are many things I don\u2019t know. So, I\u2019m sorry if I offended you in any way.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why you are talking to me like this.\u201d\u201cBecause I want to know about the beautiful light.\u201d\u201cBeautiful light?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a beautiful emotion to be precise, it shines brightly before a person dies. I\u2019ve seen it three times, but you\u2019re the only one who exuded the beautiful light while being alive\u2026 So I just wanted to know, what were you thinking in the end?\u201dOliver adjusted his posture and sat down properly to listen.The figure was like a curious child waiting for an answer.Joanna looked at Oliver for a long time and then spoke.\u201cBefore answering, can I ask you a question? Why are you curious about that?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 because it\u2019s beautiful.\u201dAn emotion that he doesn\u2019t know.There was no specific reason for Oliver for learning black magic or finding the beautiful emotions.That itself was the goal.\u201cYou are putting so much effort into it just because of that beautiful emotion?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 So, do you know?\u201dAs soon as she heard his answer, Joanna loosened her anger and hatred for Oliver and looked at him from a new perspective.It was sympathy.\u201cYou are\u2026broken.\u201d\u201cBroken?\u201d\u201cYes. Answer me. How many times have you felt sad or angry?\u201dOliver thought about it quite seriously.Has he ever been sad or angry?Did he feel sad or angry when he was framed in the orphanage and got hit by the Orphanage Director?No.Did he feel sad or angry when he got tricked and sold to the mine?No.Did he feel sad or angry when the children in the mine bullied him?No.Did he feel sad or angry when the mine supervisor spit in his face and called him a motherless bastard?No.Did he feel sad or angry when he almost died in the inn?No.Did he feel sad or angry when he was slapped in the cheek by the intermediate disciple?NoDid he feel sad or angry when Andrew tried to kill him?No.Did he feel sad or angry when his master tried to kill him?No.\u201cUm\u2026not much. Ah! I was a little sad when the beautiful light could not be extracted and disappeared. I also felt sad when I saw the woman who lost all her maternal love.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t sadness, it is regret. Like a child who couldn\u2019t have the toy he wanted.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 is that so?\u201dOliver crossed his arms at those words and thought about it.Then, Joanna spoke again.\u201cYou\u2019re broken. You don\u2019t feel the right emotions. That\u2019s why you seek black magic or those beautiful emotions.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cAt least in my opinion that\u2019s how it is. So, let me help you.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 how?\u201d\u201cStop what you are doing now, ask for forgiveness, and pay for your sins.\u201d\u201c\u2026What should I do after I pay for it?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t stay in this darkness, come out into the world. Meet a lot of people out there and learn to live like a normal person.\u201d\u201cHow do you live as a normal person?\u201d\u201cWake up early, work diligently, make friends, chat with neighbors, laugh together, grieve together. That\u2019ll help.\u201dOliver understood that what Joanna was saying was sincere.She truly felt pity for Oliver and wanted to help him.She was a kind woman, Oliver had never seen anyone with such beautiful and warm emotions.\u201cBeautiful\u2026 that\u2019s an interesting story. Seriously. But it will be difficult.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI want to give it a try, but now I can\u2019t, because there are things I promised and things I owe. There is an order for everything.\u201d\u201c\u2026do you think holding us like this will solve the problem?\u201d\u201cNo. But I think there will be negotiations soon. So, I think it will be fine.\u201d\u201cNegotiations?\u201d\u201cAh, sorry\u2026 It was a secret, so please forget it.\u201dOliver rose from his seat, while Joanna tried to get up feeling flustered, but the chains tied to her hands creaked and interrupted her.\u201cThis\u2026!\u201dAs he was about to leave, Oliver turned and looked at Joanna.\u201cMiss Paladin\u2026 Thank you very much for your words today. I think I got a bit of what I needed. So, thank you so much.\u201d\u201cHey\u2026!\u201dJoanna tried to say something to him, but Oliver left without listening to it.He almost got everything he wanted.After that, a week passed, and Joanna was released.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39After negotiating with the Parter church of the Landa branch, the Paladins were released.Contrary to the worries, the Paladins followed the orders of the branch and left Wineham, and a few days passed.The city was quiet again as if the uproar had been a lie, but that was not without a price.Two of the three great warlock families in Wineham were gone.Of course, this in itself was not a big problem.The real problem was that the small and medium-sized warlock families and the remnants of the destroyed families, who mistook this for an opportunity and ran wild.There were chances that it might draw attention again if their competition were to become fierce, but the cautious pharmacist didn\u2019t want such a situation, so he decided to strike first.\u201cHow many people are there?\u201dIt was a slum in Wineham.James lowered his voice and asked.Oliver glanced at the abandoned building and answered.\u201cThere are eight. It seems like they don\u2019t even know we\u2019re here yet.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dJames beckoned and ordered his men to stop them from escaping.The pharmacist\u2019s subordinates moved quickly and blocked all the escape routes and Oliver, who saw this extracted a small amount of emotion and made two minions.\u201cMarie.\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s call, Marie immediately extracted the emotions and created a Las bomb in each of her hands.She was holding it in her hand without throwing or bursting, and when she saw Oliver\u2019s minions that were sucking her Las bomb, she pouted her lips.\u201cIt\u2019s better than before.\u201d\u201cIt was all thanks to Master.\u201dOliver\u2019s calm praise made Marie blush.Oliver ordered the minion that had swallowed Marie\u2019s Las bomb to enter the building with caution.\u201cGo.\u201dA minion flew low and entered the building unnoticed.After a while, there was a loud sound and a sudden explosion inside the building.Some warlocks inside had been wounded, while others fell into a state of confusion and fear.When Oliver nodded to signify a successful surprise attack, James signaled everyone to enter.At that moment, the employees armed with firearms and baseball bats entered simultaneously.A loud noise could be heard, and soon, one of the employees who had entered came out hurriedly and shouted.\u201cFu*k! There was a doped man.\u201dWith those words, the other employees ran out followed by a remnant of the Dominic family who had strengthened his body with drugs and black magic, came out by breaking the wall.\u201cHey, you bastards\u2026! I\u2019ll squeeze you all to death!\u201dHis skin turned red which may be due to too much anger injected or too much reinforcement black magic.He picked up a shaft and threw them to the side of the wall.\u201cUgh! Fucking as*holes! Kill him before he takes more drugs!\u201dJames shouted and shot at him with his men.Bullets poured from all directions.However, ordinary bullets could not pierce through the strengthened muscles and couldn\u2019t inflict fatal injuries.At most, it was enough to stall some time.\u201cMarie.\u201d\u201cYes, Master!\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s call, Marie came forward with the test tube.Then she casted a targeting spell towards the besieged Dominic remnant as she had practiced hundreds of times.Then she fired three bullets of hate.[Hate Bullet]\u00d73Bullets of hate flew all at once towards the target.However, she noticed that the enemy was not an idiot as he crossed his arms to defend himself.As his steel forearms collided with the hate bullets, there was the sound as if something broke.\u201cYou f*king short hair\u2026! It hurts.\u201dSurprisingly, it damaged only one of the warlock\u2019s arms.It seemed true that he specialized in disease magic and drugs.Whether it was from pain or anger, the dark wizard\u2019s muscles swelled even redder and with great strength, he kicked the debris towards the pharmacist\u2019s employees to keep them in check and then ran toward Marie.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you! Bi*ch\u2026!!\u201dHe screamed like a bewildered animal.As a bad memory resurfaced, Marie got frightened and flinched but at that time Oliver, who was behind her, placed his hand on Marie\u2019s shoulder and stretched out his hand.[Hate Bullet]The bullet of hate which was shot calmly flew swiftly towards the head of the oncoming enemy.The red warlock, who grew stronger due to the drugs smiled confidently as he raised one of the remaining arms to block the bullet but to his amazement that single bullet shattered his arm and pierced through his head.\u201c\u2026.!!!\u201dThe red warlock fell down with his head bursting like a watermelon.It was a sight that was a great shock when you consider the number of people who were hurt by him.However, Oliver, the party involved looked at Marie\u2019s condition as if nothing had happened and gave advice.\u201cTargeting speed and Hat Bullet have improved\u2026.are you okay?\u201dMarie came to her senses and nodded.\u201cYes\u2026 I am fine, Master.\u201d\u201cOkay. Then, I\u2019ll say it again. It was good. Casting skills and speed have been improved. However, it is a bad habit to lower the density of the bullet for making multiple bullets. If I were to make such a shot I would have pierced both of his arms along with his body. So, it\u2019s meaningless if you don\u2019t do it right. Do you understand?\u201dOliver slowly explained like a teacher teaching a student while Marie listened carefully.It would have been a pretty good sight if there wasn\u2019t a corpse in front of them.After James made his men clean up, he approached Oliver and spoke to him.\u201c\u2026 It feels good to see you getting along with someone.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s ironic. Don\u2019t ever do it in front of a corpse. It\u2019s creepy.\u201dAfter saying that James cut off the dead warlock\u2019s head with a machete and put it in his bag.Fortunately, it was a specially processed bag, so there was no blood leakage, and Oliver who saw James taking the head asked.\u201cWhy are you taking his head?\u201d\u201cThe remnants of Dominic and Anthony\u2019s families along with all the other small warlocks can\u2019t be caught or killed easily, right? So to make all those bastards surrender we have to show them something like this\u2026.well, even though it was smashed, it\u2019s all right.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 is that so?\u201cYour reaction is very consistent. Have you ever been surprised in your life?\u201d\u201cThere are many times?\u201dJames shook his head in disbelief.\u201cMr. James, we\u2019ve finished cleaning up. We\u2019ve taken their drug production equipment, and we\u2019ve also found the stolen goods and money.\u201d\u201cOkay, don\u2019t touch it and put them in the car. We have to share it with the Warlock\u2026 If it\u2019s okay, send the lady to check.\u201dOliver saw Marie, and Marie went straight to the cleaning area.James spoke to his subordinate again.\u201cAfter everything is done, you can call the police and finish everything properly, can you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dThe conversation ended like a flowing stream.Oliver looked at James and asked.\u201cThen\u2026is this the end for today?\u201d\u201cYes. Would you like a smoke?\u201dJames stopped smoking but he still recommended it.Oliver shook his head.\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. Today, I don\u2019t think there is much to do.\u201d\u201cWell, of course. You\u2019ve been fighting continuously for the past few days\u2026 I personally thank you.\u201d\u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m talking to you. Thanks to you fewer people died which made our work a lot easier and everything is thanks to your help. If it were to be others then they would have gotten arrogant, but it\u2019s nice that you\u2019re quiet.\u201d\u201cWell, I also needed your help.\u201dThat was true.Oliver helped with the pharmacist\u2019s job, but it was never free.The pharmacist was helping Oliver with many tasks, including the reorganization and stabilization of the Joseph family with a new hideout, safe houses, and even the expansion of the pilgaret production facility.Not only that, Oliver also received books of the Dominic and Anthony families in exchange for the goods that were taken in the course of negotiations with the Parters.\u201cMaster, I have checked everything. I have written down everything about the production equipment, stolen goods, and cash. It seems like we would get our share later.\u201dMarie said while showing the meticulously written notes in her notebook like an accountant.\u201cUm\u2026 Okay. James, since you said we don\u2019t have anything else to do today, can we just go back?\u201d\u201cOh, wait a minute. We fought together, but you\u2019re leaving just like that?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDamn, you\u2019re replying too quickly? Do you hate me? I\u2019m sorry, but could you stop by our base for a moment? Boss wants to see you.\u201dMarie was about to say something, but Oliver stopped her first.\u201cYou mean the pharmacist?\u201d\u201cUh, yes, I think he has something to say. Are you okay?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026yes, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dOliver, along with Marie and James, rode a truck to visit the warehouse built on the outskirts of Wineham.It was said that all drugs supplied to Landa were supposed to go through this place including the legal drugs as well as the pilgarets and suspicious stimulants.Perhaps because of that, it looked sloppy on the outside, but in reality, there were actually quite a lot of security personnel deployed.\u201cWhy did he call us to meet here?\u201dMarie asked James.\u201cI don\u2019t know, Miss. I\u2019m just an employee who gets paid and does what I am told to do, so don\u2019t be too harsh. It hurts my heart.\u201dWhen Oliver calmed Marie saying that it was fine, she quickly calmed down.She seemed to be dissatisfied with the situation where the pharmacist calls Oliver at will.After a while, the car stopped.James, Oliver, and Marie got off in order and those who were carrying luggage and guarding the warehouse came to James and Oliver.They made a salute.\u201cWhere is the boss?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s waiting for you in the warehouse office over there.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026 Come with me, I\u2019ll guide you.\u201dJames took the lead.Oliver and Marie followed James without saying a word but along the way, Marie lightly grabbed Oliver\u2019s shirt cuff.\u201cMaster?\u201d\u201cYes, Marie?\u201cLook over there.\u201dOliver turned his head as Marie told, just to see the remnants of the Dominic and Anthony families gathered on one side.Although they looked gloomy, they didn\u2019t look like prisoners.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dMarie asked nervously.Oliver, on the other hand, was calm.\u201cWe can go and ask.\u201dThey entered the warehouse where the boxes were stacked, and soon they arrived at the office, built on the second floor.In front of the warehouse office, there were two fierce-looking men standing as guards, who checked Oliver before giving him permission to enter.As Marie was about to snap again, Oliver calmed her down.\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cThanks for your cooperation. Come in. Sir Warlock.\u201dThe guards politely opened up the large door.As they entered through the door they could see the pharmacist sitting at the desk.He got up and greeted Oliver politely after Closing the papers he was reading.\u201cThank you for coming. I have been waiting for you. First, let\u2019s shake hands.\u201dA middle-aged man and a boy in his mid-teens held hands.\u201cWould you like to sit down? Do you need anything to drink?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cWell, then, was the job difficult?\u201d\u201cNot really. It was alright.\u201d\u201cAlright?\u201d\u201cYes, I get to train Marie.\u201dThe pharmacist looked over the door.\u201cAs expected, you brought that girl. That\u2019s why I told you to come alone. Every time I say something, she gets really mad, and it\u2019s scary.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that, but anyway, don\u2019t take her often with you.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s not really important. Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you. Thanks to you, things are progressing easier than I thought.\u201dThe pharmacist\u2019s words were sincere.Among the remnants of the Dominic and Anthony families, there were some skilled Warlocks who gave a lot of headaches, but when Oliver joined, it wasn\u2019t a problem anymore.Thanks to Oliver, the pharmacist was able to save countless resources such as time, manpower, and money.\u201cI\u2019m glad I was helpful.\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I prepared a present for you.\u201d\u201cAre there any new books?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. We already gave all the books we had to you last time.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Then?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you see something on your way when coming inside?\u201d\u201c\u2026 The disciples of the Dominic and Anthony family?\u201d\u201cExactly, the remnants. The head of both families is dead\u2026 By the way, we didn\u2019t catch them, it was they who came here to surrender by themselves. So, please take care of them.\u201d\u201cSurrendered?\u201d\u201cYeah, they have been fighting for wineham for a long time, so they know \u2013 To survive you have to fight and win, if you can\u2019t, you have to leave or you have to kneel.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 So.\u201d\u201cI will give them all to you.\u201d\u201cGive them?\u201d\u201cThey all have promised to surrender to you.\u201dOliver didn\u2019t even react because Oliver wasn\u2019t particularly interested in them.The pharmacist also noticed this and explained how important of a decision this was.\u201cThey may not be a big deal to you, but it\u2019s a pretty big deal for me. If you were to accept them then you can make your pilgarets more efficiently.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m willing to give them to you because I want to protect my relationship with your family.\u201dAt first glance, it may seem like a great favor, but it wasn\u2019t.The only thing that the surrendered warlocks can make at best was the widespread and common pilgaret.Oliver, on the other hand, was able to make pilgaret with unparalleled quality, to the point of perfection.In other words, the pharmacist\u2019s favor was of no great value in the first place, and Oliver was also aware of this fact to some extent, so he stayed silent.Just looking at the emotions of the pharmacist, it was full of ulterior motives, so Oliver silently kept looking at the pharmacist without saying anything.After a while, the pharmacist sighed and spoke.\u201cWell\u2026 the pilgarets they made in the first place are not worth much, but anyway, it\u2019s my belief in you guys.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 you don\u2019t have to do this but thank you.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cYes, I know you helped me a lot.\u201dThe emotion of relief emanated from the pharmacist.\u201cI\u2019m glad you know\u2026 In that sense, I would like to ask when will you be able to start full-scale production of pilgarets?\u201d\u201cIf I want to make it, I can start making it right away, but I think it will take a little time because other people have to practice.\u201dRight now Oliver was training some of the senior disciples including Peter to synthesize emotions.\u201cIs there any reason to do that? It would be much better if you were the only one who could do it.\u201d\u201cI have a lot of work\u2026\u2026it would be better for a stable production.\u201d\u201cWell, yes, but\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We will start production and deliver like we promised.\u201dUpon hearing the answer, the pharmacist walked over to Oliver and held out his hand.\u201cI am getting more and more worried as I get older, can you confirm the promise again?\u201d\u201c\u2026the pharmacist will look after the family, protect the family, and provide the necessary raw materials required for production, so all our dealing will be with the pharmacist?\u201d\u201cThank you, I\u2019m embarrassed to say this, but I want to keep a good relationship with you for as long as possible. If possible, for the rest of my life.\u201dOliver looked at the pharmacist\u2019s hand without saying a word.When the silence became so long, the tension grew, but soon Oliver grabbed the pharmacist\u2019s hand.\u201cYes, I hope so too\u2026.\u201d\u2018In the time I\u2019m here.\u2019Oliver answered, deliberately omitting the last part.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Booaaaang\u2014Three trucks stopped in front of a factory.There was a sign that read {Ham Sausage Factory} above the factory\u2019s front door.When the door of the truck in the front opened, everyone who was working inside, came out and greeted.\u201cWelcome Master!\u201d\u201cWelcome Master!!!\u201dThe disciples led by Peter bowed their heads to Oliver who stepped out of the truck.\u201cYes, I am back. And, you don\u2019t have to do this every time.\u201dOliver showed a blunt expression.However, Peter did not give up.\u201cBut still you are our Master\u2026 And\u2026, who are they, Master?\u201dPeter asked as he watched some people get off the truck following Oliver.At first, Peter didn\u2019t realize who they were, but soon he recognized that they were the remnants of the Anthony and Dominic family.\u201cAren\u2019t they the members of the Anthony and Dominic family, Master?\u201d\u201cUm, yeah\u2026 Pharmacist said that they wanted to join our family. So I brought them here. So, Please tell them where they are going to live and the rules they have to follow.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPeter couldn\u2019t reply as he was stunned looking at the warlocks who had surrendered.Everyone was in a state of dejection.\u201cUm, is there anything wrong?\u201cWhat? Oh, no! No. Of course, you can\u2026 But, Master.\u201d\u201cYes, Peter.\u201d\u201cHow would you want us to treat them?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cActually people who come into the family like this are usually given the lowest treatment.\u201dOliver looked at the members of the Anthony and Dominic family.As soon as they felt Oliver\u2019s gaze they soon lowered their eyes.A lot of small and medium-class warlocks have also surrendered to Oliver without making a fuss.It was due to the terrifying existence called Oliver, who was similar to Joseph, Dominic, and Anthony in the past.\u201cIs there any reason to discriminate? Peter will work with others to classify them according to their skills and let them receive treatment according to their class.\u201d\u201cAh, Yes, Master\u2026 Everyone! Follow me this way.\u201dPeter summoned the frightened remnant warlocks and took them somewhere along with the fellow senior disciples.They followed him with depressed expressions on their faces.\u201cWow\u2026 that\u2019s great.\u201dJames, who came along with Oliver suddenly spoke as he got off the truck.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Now you look more like a real owner of a warlock family. You can control everything with just one word, right?\u201dThat was true.After subduing the paladins alone and becoming the owner of Wineham\u2019s biggest warlock organization, the respect and loyalty of the family members towards Oliver have increased noticeably.However, it wasn\u2019t just for that.In addition, Oliver gained respect for expanding and organizing education time while distributing weekly wages and special privileges to all disciples.There was no special reason, Oliver simply thought it was the right thing to do, but the results were outstanding.At this point, anyone would be proud of themself for achieving such a great feat, but there was no such thing in Oliver\u2019s expression,\u00a0 which disappointed James\u2019 expectations.\u201cUm\u2026 it\u2019s because of everyone\u2019s hard work.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dJames laughed.Oliver\u2019s words were sincere, so it felt even more alien and frightening to James.Oliver had established an unprecedentedly powerful organization in Wineham\u2019s history but still, he was calm as if it was no big deal.Oliver reached out his hand toward James.\u201cYeah. Thank you for helping today, and you did a great job today.\u201d\u201cThank you, James too did a great job.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026. When is my next class?\u201d\u201cCome when it\u2019s convenien\u2026 No, try to come as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cWhat? What\u2019s the rush?\u201d\u201cNo, I just thought, it\u2019s about time I finish things.\u201dAt the incomprehensible words, James tilted his head, but he didn\u2019t bother to ask.Oliver saying something he couldn\u2019t understand was not a new thing, so, he just let it slide.After a handshake, James drove back in the same truck.Not long after, James understood the true meaning behind Oliver\u2019s words.Nothing much had changed since Anthony and the Dominic family disciples joined.Oliver got up in the morning, cleaned, ate, and went straight to black magic training, the same routine when he used to run the family.Each class disciples were trained separately and Oliver trained intermediate, junior, and informal disciples while rotating with some Senior disciples to decrease his time.Normally, after that, he would have gone to read the books, but now he didn\u2019t do that, instead, he gathered the Senior disciples separately and gave them intense training.Currently, there were 14 senior disciples in the Joseph family (Oliver did not change the family name) through the reorganization.Oliver trained them separately in two groups according to their characteristics.The first group practiced synthesizing emotions that were required for preparing the current pilgaret.At a glance, it doesn\u2019t look like much, but everyone was having a hard time due to the synthesis process and the great backlash when it failed.\u201cUghhhhhh!\u201dJust then, a senior disciple who failed to synthesize the emotions sat down and screamed in pain.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I am fine, Master.\u201d\u201cThen get up and practice again\u2026 Black Shield.\u201dOliver moved his hands to block the attacks coming from three different directions.Now, Oliver was training the second group in combat training.The second group with Marie as the leader was filled with people who were more interested in the firepower of black magic than the production of pilgarets.Oliver dealt with them properly on the spot and taught them the necessary senses and skills required for battle.Of course, he also trained the Senior disciples who synthesized emotions at the same time.It was a bit of a crazy sight but considering the lack of time, it was inevitable.\u201cEveryone, don\u2019t give up and focus until the end. If you get distracted when you\u2019re almost done then the emotions will immediately rebound. Stay focused until the end, and don\u2019t let your guard down even after you\u2019ve completed it\u2026. Hate Bullet.\u201dThe bullets of hate that flew in seven directions hit the stomachs of Marie and other senior disciples.Due to the moderate reduction in power, no one had a bullet piercing through their body.They just grabbed their stomachs and moaned as if they had been kicked very hard.\u201cArghhhhh\u2026!\u201dA senior disciple, who could not bear the pain threw up.For some reason, everyone stopped what they were doing and watched it in silence, and soon, only the sound of breathing and a strange silence remained in the training ground.\u201c\u2026\u2026 What are you all doing?\u201dWhen Oliver asked, a senior disciple said.\u201cIt\u2019s a little\u2026hard, Master.\u201d\u201cUm, there are recovery potions and healing ointments given by the pharmacist. If you are injured or tired, use it as you like.\u201dRestorative potions and healing ointments, although they are made for supply and are relatively inexpensive, those things are said to cost a lot compared to basic items.Oliver\u2019s attitude of generously giving away such things as he trains the disciples were rare in Wineham\u2026. No, not just Wineham, it was also a rare thing in Landa, and also in the magic tower.If we think about it in common sense, everyone should be happy, but as the intensity of the training was so high, everyone got tired and eventually became far from being happy.\u201c\u2026 What are you doing? Faster.\u201dThe senior disciple whose body was drenched in sweat asked.\u201cHow about taking a little break? Master?\u201d\u201cWhy? Everyone has their limits, so, don\u2019t you have to practice more, so that your skills can improve faster? I really don\u2019t understand,\u201dOliver asked in a puzzled voice.\u201cEveryone is so tired\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t we have medicine? Then\u2026.\u201dOliver realized what was going on and shouted.\u201cAre you saying that you want to quit? Just because you are tired?\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s question, everyone shook their heads.\u201cOh, no. It\u2019s not like that, Master. But, if we were to overdo it like this then we might seriously get injured\u2026\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t get hurt.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cGroup 1, you guys are only following the training schedule that I specified, right?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 yes, yes Master.\u201d\u201cThen, even if you were to fail in the middle, you will only get some light burns on your hands.\u201dOliver\u2019s voice had a sense of intimidation even though it was not intended, but hearing his firm tone, all the Senior disciples bowed their heads and said nothing.They acted like a child who gets scolded for being lazy.While such a heavy and uncomfortable silence was pressing down on the space, Oliver spoke once again.\u201cIf you want to stop, then you can stop.\u201dEveryone shook their heads at Oliver\u2019s unexpected answer.After a small pause, Oliver spoke again.\u201cI have no intention of forcing you to do anything. I just want you to learn, and this is the best way to help. If you don\u2019t want to then you can quit anytime. But before that, I want to ask you something. Didn\u2019t everyone come here because you want to become powerful warlocks? In that case, is it okay to be like this? Are you guys really going to stop here?\u201dAs soon as Oliver finished speaking, Marie, who had been sitting still while sweating profusely got up with her trembling body along with other senior disciples, applied medicine and ointments, and came back.Peter\u2019s group 1, who synthesizes emotions, also started extracting emotions again, Oliver spoke again as he watched them.\u201cNow\u2026 let\u2019s start again, shall we?\u201d\u201cYes! Master!!\u201dAfter the training was over, the Senior, intermediate, junior, and informal disciples ate in the newly prepared Eatery.Unlike the previous place, the new one was very spacious, so it was enough for everyone to eat together.Not only that, the quality and quantity of the meals were also abundant, so, everyone was able to eat without discrimination.Is it because of that? Although the training was difficult, unlike in the past, everyone was full of energy and the atmosphere was not gloomy.No, it became bright.\u201cToday\u2019s training was really hard\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it difficult only today? Yesterday and the day before yesterday, maybe, tomorrow too?\u201dAll the senior disciples who had undergone Oliver\u2019s rigorous training burst into laughter.It is true that the training was difficult but no one was dissatisfied with it.Everyone called Oliver who was younger than them as Master from the bottom of their hearts.In fact, it was natural.Since the standard of living has increased, they have been building up their skills beyond comparison to the past.If it goes on like this, it wouldn\u2019t be a dream to be reborn as a true warlock and become independent.\u201c\u2026are you all going to be independent?\u201dA senior disciple asked.\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke, but if we were to practice for a few years like this then we might be able to become independent\u2026 Are you all going to be independent?\u201dEveryone was silent.The term \u201cdisciple\u201d means a subordinate, and they were nothing but a slave to their master.Therefore, the word independent was a word they can dream of but can\u2019t think of.In fact, the majority of Masters either don\u2019t accept them or don\u2019t teach them properly.However, if they go on like this, then the word independent might become a reality for most of the Senior disciples.When everyone was thinking about it, one of the senior disciples spoke.\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s not that I haven\u2019t thought about it, but I haven\u2019t seriously thought about it in this environment.\u201d\u201cEnvironment?\u201dNow, they could buy most of the things they wanted using the weekly pay they receive every week.Although it\u2019s not a huge amount of money to play and eat for the rest of their lives, they could be able to raise enough to build their own family based on their current situation.However, ironically, when such an environment was created, the senior disciples\u2026 No, the disciples of all classes, including the senior disciples, were losing their will to become independent.They\u2019ve been through a lot of things lately and realized that they couldn\u2019t become successful just by learning black magic, and they are satisfied with their life right now.Above all, they were all ignorant of fear and has the utmost respect for Oliver.Everyone knew it, but they couldn\u2019t agree with it boldly and in such an awkwardly silent atmosphere, someone spoke to change the subject.\u201cBy the way, where is Marie? Is she sick?\u201d\u201cNo, She went to get Master\u2019s meal.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Knock, knockA knocking sound was heard.Oliver, who was reading a book in the library, answered without turning his head.\u201cCome in, Marie.\u201dAs soon as permission was granted, Marie came in through the door.In one of her hands, there was a tray with sandwiches.\u201cHello, Master.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cIt looks like you are not eating, so I brought them.\u201dOliver turned his head slightly and looked toward Marie.\u201c\u2026\u2026..thank you.\u201dMarie smiled as if it was a big thing, and set the tray down.She looked at the book Oliver was reading.Various other books were piled up including the books of the Anthony family.\u201c\u2026\u2026. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cAh, sorry, Master. I was just wondering what kind of book you were reading.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m reading Anthony Family\u2019s black magic book. It\u2019s about manipulation-type black magic. Animal manipulation, human manipulation, corpse manipulation, etc.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t Master already know about it?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026what I did was just an imitation, I don\u2019t know how to do it. For example, it\u2019s harder to control the living than to control the dead, and it\u2019s even harder to control people than animals. I know about this only after reading the book.\u201dOliver continued on, placing his hand on Dominic\u2019s book.\u201cI learned that there are various applications of disease-based black magic depending on the interpretation and application.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really great, Master.\u201d\u201cNot really. The books that were in Master Joseph\u2019s study, contained a lot of information, but unfortunately, the books here have only traces of them, and nothing is written properly.\u201dOliver said while looking at the books that were piled up on the nearby bookshelf.\u201cI see\u2026 Have you finished reading most of the book, Master?\u201d\u201cNot all, almost all? Soon, I would finish everything.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 aren\u2019t you pushing yourself too hard, Master?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cRecently, you\u2019ve been overworking without eating or sleeping properly, so I\u2019m worried.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Did I do something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that! Quite the contrary! We all respect you for what you\u2019re doing from the bottom of our hearts\u2026!\u201dMarie spoke hurriedly.\u201cEveryone is having a hard time, but we really respect Master. Master gave us everything that we dreamed of, including proper education, money, and meals\u2026.you can tell just by going to the Eatery right now. Master is really\u2026awesome.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I see.\u201dOliver replied bluntly and began to read the book again.It was a natural reaction.In Oliver\u2019s standards, it wasn\u2019t important to earn respect or love.It was just a sense of duty to do his job.This was his minimum obligation since he was freed from the troublesome chores.So Oliver was not very pleased with the respect and loyalty he had earned.He just did what he had to do.At Oliver\u2019s unkind reaction, Marie felt frustrated.There was frustration toward Oliver who didn\u2019t understand how great the thing he had done.She also felt frustrated that he was not able to recognize how valuable he was.The frustration gradually grew, and soon began to fluctuate in a negative form of emotions.Irritability, obsession, craving, self-hatred, and\u2026\u201cMarie.\u201dOliver suddenly closed the book.Marie replied in surprise.\u201cYes, Master\u2026\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, I made a promise to you, right?\u201dPromise?Marie thought for a moment and remembered.\u201cAh\u2026yes, you said we will talk about each other.\u201dMarie\u2019s pale face turned bright red.At that time, she unknowingly complained to Oliver, who showed interest in the paladin named Joanna.She didn\u2019t know what he was thinking\u2026Still, Marie had a certain sense of anticipation.She wondered if she could share something special with Oliver\u2026\u201cI have to keep my promise\u2026but before I start my story, can I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Master.\u201d\u201cWhy does Marie want to know about me?\u201dOliver was just curios. However, it was a question that was difficult to answer for Marie.Marie was silent for a while.She couldn\u2019t even figure out how to answer that innocent question.As the silence grew longer, she opened her mouth since Oliver had interpreted it otherwise.\u201cUm, if you don\u2019t want to say about it, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that!\u201dMarie said in a loud voice without realizing it.\u201cNo \u2026 it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to say it, Master \u2026 can you wait a moment for my answer?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Yes, take your time.\u201dOliver waited as promised.After a long silence, Marie barely opened her mouth.\u201cI\u2026 want to always be by Master\u2019s side.\u201d\u201cYou want to be with me?\u201cYes, I want to be with Master.\u201dOliver thought she wanted to be with him like a direct disciple.It was true, but it was also wrong.Oliver was right about Marie wanting to be close to him, but what she wanted was more than that, and Marie just couldn\u2019t say it.\u201cYou may not know, but no one has ever helped me as much as you did, Master.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 you are the only one who taught me black magic and trained me like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Didn\u2019t I teach you that as a condition for learning how to read from you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 But, those two are really incomparable.\u201d\u201cIncomparable?\u201d\u201cYes, I was very grateful for the help you did. In fact, I almost gave up on becoming a Warlock. But, thanks to Master, I got hope that I could be a Warlock. Thank you very much.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Um, I have to thank Marie too, you have saved me once. And you don\u2019t have to thank me for becoming a warlock. After all, Marie\u2019s first step into becoming a warlock was thanks to Master, right?\u201d\u201cMaster\u2026? Are you talking about Joseph?\u201d\u201cYes, Master Joseph.\u201dWhen he talked about Joseph, Marie\u2019s emotions fluctuated like a turbulent light, and then the emotions of anger surfaced.\u201cObviously, he gave me the dream and stole it, \u2026 he is incomparable to Master Oliver.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYes, he labeled me as an informal disciple because of my lack of obedience! If Master Oliver hadn\u2019t come, I would have been preparing meals in the kitchen all my life!\u201dMarie\u2019s breathing became unstable, and her emotions fluctuated as if she was flustered and also as if she was shaken by anger and betrayal.However, soon, she regained her composure when she saw Oliver.\u201cSo, My Master will be always Master Oliver, who truly reached out to me.\u201dShe expressed her earnest words.However, there was no change in Oliver\u2019s reaction.Neither did he understand her nor did he feel empathized with Marie.\u201cUm\u2026 Still, isn\u2019t it Master Joseph who saved you back then?\u201d\u201cHe wasn\u2019t, Master. He was trying to sacrifice us to the Demon! He was just trying to take advantage of us!\u201d\u201cIs that so? Um\u2026but, isn\u2019t it also true that he helped you when you were about to be raped by the gangsters?\u201dMarie was shocked.Her eyes widened as her emotions fluctuated.\u201c\u2026 \u201d\u201cUm\u2026 did I say something wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 How did you know that, Master?\u201d\u201cOn the day I met with Master Joseph at Landa, he told me about it during the conversation.\u201dMarie groaned a little.It was because Oliver learned about a secret that she never wanted him to know.She exuded a myriad of emotions like displeasure, shame, anger, and sadness, and Oliver observed her emotions in silence.It looked like he made a mistake, but he didn\u2019t know what he did wrong.\u201cIf I said something wrong, I\u2019ll apologize.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 No, you don\u2019t need to apologize, Master. You are my Master, and you are correct\u2026.. Have I ever told you about my past, Master?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026you said you wanted to become a warlock and wanted to become strong.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 that\u2019s right. My parents and I were both weak people.\u201dMarie started telling her story to Oliver.She told him the story of her days in an illegal shantytown near a dye factory.When the factory released its dirty sewage right next to her house, she couldn\u2019t do anything about it.When her mother collapsed from illegal labor, she couldn\u2019t do anything,When her father got beaten to death by the local gangsters, she couldn\u2019t do anything.Eventually, when she went to get revenge on those gangsters, she suffered something that became traumatic.She was calm at first, but as the story progressed, Marie\u2019s emotions started to fluctuate and tears welled up in her eyes.\u201c\u2026that\u2019s how I get to meet Joseph, and that\u2019s why I am here now.\u201d\u201c\u2026. I see.\u201d\u201cYes, so I once thought of Joseph as my savior but after some time I realized that it was all just an illusion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026. That\u2019s unfortunate?\u201d\u201cNo Master, I was fortunate. Thanks to that, I met Master Oliver. Master gave me a new chance to live, so I want to be always with Master and serve you.\u201d\u201c\u2026. I see.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Then\u2026., can you tell me about yourself, Master?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSince I have told you my story. I also want to hear the story of Master\u2026 Can\u2019t I?\u201dOliver was silent for a moment.\u201c\u2026\u2026 No. It\u2019s just that there wasn\u2019t much to say, but I\u2019ll tell you if you want.\u201d\u201c I want to hear it, Master.\u201d\u201cWell then\u2026\u201dSo Oliver began his story.The story began from the time when Oliver was living in an orphanage.He described how many children were there and how strict the director was, without showing any emotions.The robot-like explanation was more like reciting a rule book.Still, Marie paid great attention as she listened to the story.When Oliver said about the time he got bullied or received unfair punishment, she got sad and angry.Oliver did not show any emotions during his narration.Although he had not much to say, Oliver still recounted his life in as much detail as Marie wished.A day wasn\u2019t enough to completely hear the story, so Marie visits the library every day as if she had promised to listen to Oliver\u2019s story \u2013 Like a fire moth chasing light.Meanwhile, Oliver\u2019s Joseph family also found stability as time passed.Soon, Peter and some senior disciples were able to naturally synthesize emotions, and they even reached a point where they could produce pilgarets even without Oliver.\u201cAh, so Master was able to see emotions from the beginning?\u201d\u201cYes, I thought it was normal, but it wasn\u2019t, so it felt nice when I got to meet someone like our master.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dNow, Marie and the other disciples were able to stand against Oliver to some extent when they come at him together.As evidence, they were able to subdue any gangsters or small and medium-sized warlocks even without the help of Oliver.\u201cAh\u2026the pilgaret you smoked at that time was Joseph\u2019s emotion right before his death, right Master?\u201d\u201cYes, it was an emotion that shined with a very beautiful light.\u201d\u201cAre you still interested in that light, Master?\u201d\u201cYes, I haven\u2019t fully figured out what it is yet\u2026 I want to see it again.\u201d\u201c\u2026 If you want it then just give a command, Master. We will risk our lives to find it and dedicate it to Master Oliver\u2026 Yes, you can order us to find it. This is Oliver\u2019s family.\u201d\u201cUm, that\u2019s not\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. We are Oliver\u2019s disciples. You can order anything you want, Master. We will dedicate our lives to making your wish come true, Master.\u201dTime passed by and autumn came.Loyalty towards Oliver further strengthened the unity of the organization,Unable to endure any longer, the small and medium-sized warlock organizations threw away all their pride and surrendered to Oliver through the pharmacist.Joseph family became the only Warlock family in Wineham.Marie got up from her bed with great joy.After washing and dressing, Marie went to wake Oliver as usual.It was a privilege that only she had.\u201cMaster, it\u2019s time to wake up.\u201dThe answer did not come back.Normally, the answer \u2018Okay, Marie.\u2019 would have come, but it didn\u2019t todayMarie felt something strange, so she soon opened the door and looked inside.Marie\u2019s eyes saw an empty bed and a note lying on it.[I\u2019m not needed here anymore, so I\u2019m leaving.][P.S. Everyone can do whatever they want to.]Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42\u201cUm\u2026.\u201dA dark space with the smell of rotting corpses.Oliver was sitting there.And opposite him was a corpse with one of its arms being torn off, leaning against the altar.\u201cYeah, I think this is the right thing to do\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAs Marie said, I could use the family for my needs, but I think it\u2019s right to just leave.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is not easy to find about the beautiful light\u2026 And above all else, I don\u2019t want to use them like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMarie and Peter. They are both talented in their own way. They have the will to do something\u2026 which is good. So before I left, I tried to take care of them, but it got weirder.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAt first, they were doing everything for themself, but strangely as time went on they stopped thinking for themselves and started to wait for me for everything.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo I decided to leave. I think it would be better for them without me. It will be easier for me to know about the beautiful light if I\u2019m on my own. Being part of an organization, I have a lot of work, so it\u2019s difficult to focus on the other things.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAside from that, I\u2019m also very interested in the word that the Paladin mentioned. It was the woman I happened to meet last time. Her name\u2026 I think it was Joanna.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShe said that I was broken.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI was a little surprised. There are very few people who looked at me and said that, and it was the first time someone showed genuine sympathy and wanted to help me\u2026 What do you think, Master? Am I broken?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo I suddenly started to wonder. Am I really broken? So I\u2019m trying to find out about it too. I want to meet people and live the world according to what she said\u2026 Then I can figure it out, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cI wonder if I am a pitiful being as she said\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI think this is the right path for me. Beautiful lights, black magic, me\u2026 There are a lot of things I want to know, and it would be difficult for me to know about them if I were to be a part of an organization.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cJames said that the pharmacist is trying to expand his business\u2026 It\u2019s interesting. They already have enough money, but they still want to make more money. There must be a reason to make money, but I don\u2019t know why they keep spending most of their time making money.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cUm, it may be difficult for everyone because I disappeared, but still, other people can synthesize emotions, so there\u2019s no big problem, right Master? Moreover, I left a note too\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you for listening master. My mind has been cleared up after talking to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOliver got up and politely bowed his head to the corpse\u2026 No, to the dead Joseph.Of course, he didn\u2019t actually have a conversation, it was Oliver\u2019s one-sided talk, but it was helpful enough.Oliver thanked him once again and went back the way he had come.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore leaving Oliver stopped and turned his head without saying a word.Then he looked at the altar on which Joseph was leaning.On the altar, there was a carving with three rectangles and nine circles.Old man on horseback\u2026The unidentified presence that emerged when Oliver defeated Joseph.No, he wasn\u2019t an unidentified existence.Joseph said he was a demon.However, that was the only information Oliver had about him.A demon named \u2018Old Man on horseback\u2019 could not be found in Joseph\u2019s library.All that Oliver found was the stereotyped information about the demons threatening the human world, and that warlocks can trade with them to increase their power.Oliver, who wanted more specific information wasn\u2019t interested in such tangible information which was not of much value.\u2018What was that?\u2019Oliver could not forget the foreign yet familiar feeling he had when he encountered that demon.However, what was more unforgettable was the fact that it bowed to him.The demon was polite and friendly, and Oliver didn\u2019t feel anything awkward about it.What was that? Was that the demon which empowers the warlock and threatens the human world?Oliver had a lot of questions about it.He asked James and the pharmacist about this, but they just replied that the demons are originally like that.When he asked if they could get him some books related to demons, they just shook their heads.Oliver recalled what the pharmacist had said as he climbed up from the underground.\u201cThe information and books related to demons are too dangerous. They are directly managed and monitored by the Parter Church. It is not something that can be acquired by just looking for it at will. A huge amount of capital is a must, and you must have information and risk management skills. You can only see it in a huge cult or in a black market.\u201d\u2018A big cult\u2026 a black market\u2026\u2026\u2019To be honest, his interest in demons had been declining relatively, but it\u2019s true that he was curious about them.If there was an opportunity, he thought it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to look into it once.Humans possessed unparalleled power and knowledge, so perhaps Oliver thought they could satisfy his curiosity.Of course, that\u2019s only after some personal exploration.\u201cUm\u2026 by the way, where should I go?\u201dOliver asked himself when he came out of the underground and walked out of the fence away from the hospital building.It was a pretty serious issue.Why?Because this was the first time Oliver had come out to the world, that too on his own accord.Before this Oliver grew up in an orphanage and lived in a mine.There was no free outing there.The first time he came to the outside world was when he was sold to the mine, and the second time was when he left the mine and was sold to Joseph.Oliver had never thought of going anywhere of his own will, nor had he had the opportunity to do so.So Oliver felt confused now.Where should he go now?He left while thinking it was right for him to leave, but now he had no idea where he should go.He had a goal that he wanted to achieve, but he had no idea how to reach that goal.Oliver opened his mouth after contemplating.\u201cUm\u2026 first, shall we go there?\u201dHe murmured to himself as he recalled the park where he previously met with Joseph.Unlike most of the places he had witnessed, that place was full of positive emotions such as kindness, leisure, and happiness.He thought maybe if he go there, he might find a way.Oliver took a step forward after making such a decisionTAP TAP TAPOn the way, Oliver observed Landa\u2019s District X.It doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s been that long, but it seems a lot has changed since he came with Joseph.There was more graffiti on the walls of the street, an increase in blood stains, and the totem standing on the side road was terribly broken.Even though it seems to be quiet on the outside, it was like a town full of emotions, but there was one thing that didn\u2019t change.That was, many people hiding in the dark as if looking for prey.They had been observing Oliver who had visited this place alone, for a long time.Malice, cunning, sadism, anger, and many other malicious emotions could be seen.Oliver stopped his steps.The reason was none other than because of a group of people on the corner of the alley.They were aiming for Oliver.They were waiting for Oliver to come, with nervousness, anticipation, and a bit of tension.\u2018Um\u2026\u2026\u2019Oliver pondered on what to do.Apparently, they were like the gangsters he faced at Wineham\u2026 No, they were below them in terms of capability.Oliver placed his hand into the pocket and checked the test tubes placed inside.When he decided to leave Wineham, he saved some test tubes for his personal use.Perhaps, if he were to use black magic he could have easily gotten rid of them\u2026 But he looked reluctant for some reason.He thought of the time when he extracted the Life-force during ingredient collection.Oliver thought, that if he stood out like that time, he might once again end up in trouble and he didn\u2019t want to end up in one as soon as he came.Currently, Oliver has limited knowledge about the outside world.He wanted to avoid friction as much as possible, at least for now.So Oliver made a third choice \u2013 Going back.Turning around, Oliver went on a different path.After seeing this, the people in the back alley were startled, and then they hurriedly started chasing Oliver.Oliver pondered on what to do.It was the first time he came out into the world alone, so he had no idea what to do in such a situation, and soon, the people who were chasing him surrounded Oliver.\u201cHa\u2026 Is it nice to have the sense of a dog?\u2026.\u201d\u201cBrother, I think this bastard is scared, huh?\u201d\u201cShut up, fu*ker. Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m talking? Hey\u2026you\u2019re not from here, right?\u201dOliver answered.\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYeah, you bastard\u2026.what the hell are you? You\u2019re not even from here, so why are you sneaking around?\u201c\u2026\u2026 I came to meet someone.\u201d\u201cMeet someone? Who are you going to meet? Who?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026. Someone I\u2019m indebted to\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m asking? Who the fu*k is that?\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cBrother, this guy is not answering. He\u2019s suspicious. I think he was sent by Freckle?\u201d\u2018Freckle\u2026\u2019Oliver tilted his head with an incomprehensible expression.It didn\u2019t seem like they were just looking for money, and the one who seemed to be the leader of the group pulled out a club from his hand and waved it in front of Oliver\u2019s face.\u201cHey! You! Are you going to open your mouth now or after you get a few hits?! Huh?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 It\u2019s hard to answer who I am\u2026 and who is Freckle?\u201d\u201cHow dare you pretend to be innocent! Just looking at you, it looks like you are sent by Freckle to spy on something! If you tell everything, we will end in moderation!\u201dThe situation did not make any sense to Oliver.At that moment, when Oliver felt like he couldn\u2019t stay like this, an unfamiliar voice intervened.\u201cWhat are you all doing?\u201dTAK TAK TAKOliver turned his head to see a man approaching him.A middle-aged man, wearing a shabby long coat and beanie.He was limping on one leg while holding a long wooden stick.The people who surrounded Oliver seemed to know him.\u201cQua\u2026 Quarterstaff Kent?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s me. I\u2019m Quarterstaff Kent, thanks for the kind introduction\u2026 I asked you, what\u2019s going on.\u201dThose men around Oliver were stunned.Apparently, this man called Kent seemed to be someone who has some kind of influence on them.\u201cThere was a suspicious person, and we caught him\u2026. Rather, why is Quarterstaff Kent here\u2026?\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026 I delivered some trash.\u201dWith those words, Kent took out a bundle of money from his pocket and shook it.It was the appearance of a drunken customer bragging about money, but Oliver could see that it was an act.\u201cI see. Then please take your leave\u2026\u201d\u201cAh? Why are you so desperately trying to kick an old man out? How about we have a chat.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s because I have some work to do\u2026\u201d\u201cWork? By work do you mean\u2026 Interrogating a kid who seems to have some mental issue? Let\u2019s see\u2026.\u201dKent came close to Oliver, then scratched his bearded chin while looking at Oliver.\u201c\u2026 you think he\u2019s sent by Freckle?\u201d\u201c\u2026. We don\u2019t know, maybe? There have been several cases like that these days.\u201d\u201c\u2026well? From my point of view, he looks like a kid who doesn\u2019t know anything about the world. He\u2019s also a lost kid. How old are you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you see that? He doesn\u2019t even answer about his age. Hahaha!\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t it suspicious? Furthermore, it may get more dangerous. You know, how sneaky Freckle is. Thinking we might not doubt a kid, he might have sent him here.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s possible, but\u2026\u201dWith Oliver in between them, the two people had a serious conversation.Oliver watched them silently, then quietly raised his hand.The two, who were having a frantic conversation even though it was nothing particularly special, suddenly noticed Oliver.As their eyes gathered, Oliver opened his mouth.\u201cWho is Freckle?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43\u201cWho is Freckle?\u201dEveryone looked at Oliver without saying a word to his innocent question.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter a long silence, someone burst out laughing.\u201cHahahahahahahaha\u2026 you don\u2019t know who Freckle is? \u201d\u201cUm, yes. Who is Freckle? I think he\u2019s a human, right?\u201d\u201cYou think he\u2019s a human\u2026? Haha-! Of course, he\u2019s a human. He\u2019s a famous human around here\u2026 Hey, do you really think this guy is Freckle\u2019s subordinate? He doesn\u2019t know who Freckle is?\u201d\u201cNo, he could also be lying.\u201d\u201cYeah, maybe he is lying. Maybe he really doesn\u2019t know him, look at this guy\u2019s face. Does he look smart enough to lie?\u201dThe man named Kent said as he grabbed Oliver\u2019s face with both callus-studded hands to make sure that there was no sense of distance.Contrary to his appearance, he was very strong.Seeing Oliver\u2019s blank face, they were a little discouraged because they were persuaded.\u201cWell\u2026, maybe he doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cYes. Maybe he doesn\u2019t know. Still\u2026.\u201d\u201cKent\u2026we owe you a lot but to send him like this is still a little bit\u2026don\u2019t you know?\u201dOliver couldn\u2019t understand what they were talking about, but he could see that everyone was feeling anxious, flustered, and afraid.The man named Kent was also in agreement to some extent.\u201cUgh\u2026 I understand what you guys are saying\u2026how about this?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to take in this friend.\u201d\u201cWhat? What are you talking about\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m taking this dude, and if there\u2019s anything suspicious, I\u2019ll scold him. With this!\u201dKent waved his wooden stick and said.The pursuers were confused at his statement.\u201cNo, you can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you saying you can\u2019t trust me?\u201d\u201cOh, no, how can we say such a thing?\u201d\u201cThen, what\u2019s the matter? I\u2019m going to monitor this guy. Then, you guys can be relieved, right? I will ask you again. Do you guys trust me? Believe me, if you say no it\u2019s going to make me really sad.\u201dIn the end, without being able to cope with Kent\u2019s pressure, those who followed Oliver hesitated and then backed off.\u201c\u2026 I understand. We owe Kent a lot. I\u2019ll trust you, but if something goes wrong with him, then we can\u2019t just let it slide.\u201d\u201cThank you! Thank you\u2026! As expected, I knew you would trust me. I think I am going to cry, come on, this is my personal thanks to you. Accept it. Accept it.\u201dKent took out some bills from his pocket and forced them into their hands.They said no but still accepted it after Kent\u2019s repeated push.\u201cAh\u2026 you really don\u2019t have to. Well then, we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d\u201cYes, good night. If you have any difficulties don\u2019t forget to come to me, and it\u2019s always nice to see you guys.\u201dKent saw them off with an attitude that was neither bright nor gloomy.When they disappeared, only Kent and Oliver were left on the street.Oliver saw the emotions of people who were leaving one by one and then turned toward the man named Kent.He seemed not to be a normal person.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026 Look, hey? Hey! Can\u2019t you hear me?\u201dOliver came back to his senses.He looked forward and saw the man named Kent snapping his fingers.\u201cDo you space out often like that?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I was just scared.\u201d\u201cYou are scared? Ugh\u2026 I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cI was a little\u2026 Anyway, thank you for your help. I survived thanks to you.\u201d\u201cOh, I guess you are aware of that. If you were a person that Freckle had sent then you would be beaten to death, and even if not, your items including your underwear would have been stolen. Of course, you should be grateful.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dOliver immediately bowed his head and said thanks.It was a skill that he learned in the mine and orphanage.Fortunately, it worked on the man in front of him.The man named Kent raised the corners of his mouth.\u201cIn that sense, may I ask, where did you come from?\u201d\u201c\u2026from Wineham.\u201d\u201cWineham? Oh\u2026there are people still living there. But, why did a guy who used to live in Wineham come to Landa? That also to District X?\u201d\u201cThere was a situation\u2026\u201d\u201cSituation? It is a situation\u2026\u201dKent muttered and looked at Oliver.Long-worn shiny jackets and dusty shoes.Kent nodded as if he had guessed something.\u201c\u2026 Where are your parents?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have one.\u201d\u201cWhat? No parents\u2026 Then, why did you come here? I\u2019m very curious\u2026 No, actually, outsiders don\u2019t often come to District X, so I\u2019m very curious.\u201dOliver didn\u2019t answer right away but looked into Kent\u2019s eyes.He was a very handsome man who had not shaved his beard properly, but his eyes showed the same sharp insight as the pharmacist and James.Oliver had a gut feeling that he shouldn\u2019t answer roughly.\u201c\u2026 A person who took care of me in the past said, he was living here\u2026 I wondered if I could meet him again.\u201d\u201cWho is that person?\u201d\u201cHe was the one who took care of me in the past.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Is that so? Did you meet him?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 no.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Why did you come to meet him?\u201d\u201cI wanted to ask him something.\u201d\u201cWhat did you want to ask him?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 This is my first time out in the world alone, so I wanted to ask him some questions. There are a lot of things I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201c\u2026 First time coming out to the world? You seem a little silly, but your intentions are very noble, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThank you?\u201d\u201cHa\u2026! You don\u2019t have any parents, so you came to Landa\u2026 Did something happen?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 this and that.\u201d\u201cThis and that\u2026? Haha, what a strange and suspicious kid.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYeah, yes\u2026 I\u2019ll ask again. I\u2019m asking this very, very seriously, so answer seriously.\u201dOliver looked into Kent\u2019s eyes and answered.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou really don\u2019t know who Freckle is?\u201dTwo sharp eyes light up which contained the same insight as the pharmacist.\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know\u2026who is that?\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 A very bad guy\u2026 So, where are you going?\u201dOliver looked at the other side of District X, the park where he met Joseph.It had hot dog booths and ice cream booths, fountains and baby angels, and people full of joy and relaxation.Obviously, he decided to go there, but when he saw the unidentified man in front of him, he suddenly lost interest in the park.\u201cUm\u2026 no, no place to go.\u201d\u201cYou have nowhere to go\u2026 Surely there is no place to stay tonight, right?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026yes.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Ha\u2026\u201dThe man named Kent grazed his beard in confusion.He felt a little conflicted.\u201cUm\u2026ha, I must be really crazy. You don\u2019t even look alike\u2026 Little boy, If you have nowhere to go then follow me. It\u2019s going to get cold soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t like it, you don\u2019t have to follow me.\u201d\u201c\u2026if it\u2019s okay with you, could you please allow me to ask you a question?\u201d\u201d That\u2019s very polite. You don\u2019t have to be so polite, child. Just ask. Are you wondering if I am kidnapping you or trying to sell you?\u201cNo\u2026 I know you don\u2019t have any malicious intent. I know you are genuinely trying to help. Thank you very much.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019ve never met such a person\u2026 Can I ask why you are trying to help me?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026why? I don\u2019t know. Maybe because I felt good about making a lot of money today. What are you going to do? Are you going to follow me or not? Just say it.\u201dOliver looked at Kent once again.His emotions showed that he had no ulterior motive.\u201c\u2026 I want to follow you if it\u2019s alright with you.\u201d\u201cYou speak so beautifully. Then, follow me.\u201dOliver followed Kent.Every time Kent walks, there was a tak-tak sound due to the quarterstaff hitting the ground, and people who met him by chance on the street greeted him warmly or turned their heads in disbelief.\u201cHello! Kent.\u201d\u201cOh, nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cAre you coming from work?\u201d\u201cThe job is to get some money.\u201dWhile passing by so many people, Kent turned his head and asked.\u201cAre you wondering where we are going?\u201d\u201cUm? No\u2026 not really.\u201d\u201cYou sure are a\u2026\u2026\u2026 fearless one?\u201dKent\u2019s question was legitimate one.Even after leaving District X and coming to the relatively better District W, the low-security slum remained the same, and wherever Kent goes there are more and more sparsely populated and eerie places.Those are situations in which children should be suspicious and fearful of the adult they are with.Obviously, Oliver didn\u2019t show the slightest bit of suspicion.From Kent\u2019s point of view, it could be said that Oliver was a very strange child.\u201c\u2026 I have a lot of fear.\u201d\u201cOh, really? For your information, I hate lies.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a lie. I don\u2019t like getting sick, I\u2019m afraid to die, and there are many things I\u2019m scared of.\u201d\u201cUsually everyone is afraid of getting sick or dying. There are some weird people who like them, but that is an exception.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, my God\u2026 do you normally talk like that? I think something\u2019s wrong with your head.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Someone looked at me and said that I am broken.\u201d\u201cBroken? He got that right. Who was that?\u201d\u201cUm, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cOh my!\u201dAs Oliver was about to answer, a loud voice interrupted them from somewhere.He turned his head in the direction of the sound just to see a man and a little boy.The man was a middle-aged man with wrinkles, a wide nose, and a head with no hairs.The boy had light blonde hair and was wearing a large, unfitting coat and shoes.\u201cKent! Kent! Kent! Our beggars\u2019 light Kent!\u201dThe man came over to Kent, throwing away the boy he had been carrying.He had an innocent smile but when you look at his red nose one could easily guess that he was an alcoholic.He hummed and continued to speak.\u201cYou\u2019re finally here. You\u2019re finally here\u2026 I\u2019m so glad that you came back safely!\u201d\u201cYes, nice to meet you\u2026 Are you on your way to work?\u201d\u201cWork? I? Haha! I haven\u2019t worked since 20 years ago! It\u2019s a joke!! He did it. He did it! Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dThe red-nosed man pointed to the blond kid and said.The blond little boy smiled innocently and bowed his head to Kent, and Kent accepted it\u2026\u201cIf you came back safely, it would mean that our leader has received the money, right? Now, show this red nose how much you got. Come on.\u201d\u201cLooks like you\u2019re running out of booze.\u201d\u201cI am always short on alcohol! So how much did you earn?\u201d\u201cLater. Later. We have to check this when everyone is together so that no one can talk behind the scenes.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026! Okay, I admit it! That\u2019s right. Can I ask you another question instead?\u201d\u201cI always feel that you talk a lot, but now you are talking a lot more. What is it?\u201d\u201cWho is this kid?!\u201dThe red-nosed man exaggeratedly pointed at Oliver and asked.Kent looked at Oliver without saying a word and soon opened his mouth.\u201cThis little kid? Uh\u2026 On my way here. I found this kid.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying like you picked up a dog\u2026 Kid, what\u2019s your name?\u201dThe red-nosed man moved his face so close that Oliver felt burdensome.Contrary to his innocent expression, that man\u2019s eyes were shining quite sharply, though not as much as Kent\u2019s.It\u2019s as if he could see through whether Oliver was lying or not.Oliver looked straight into his face and answered calmly.\u201cMy name is Oliver. I came from Wineham.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44After introducing himself, Oliver went with Kent and his comrades to their abode, the beggar\u2019s den.It was in an abandoned building with a few people, and it seemed Oliver\u2019s presence was not a welcoming one to all of them.\u201cHuh, why the hell did you bring such a troublesome guy?!\u201dA stocky, thick man who was called Bigfist shouted, looking at Oliver.Although he was dressed like a beggar, his fists looked big and stiff, and Kent smiled shamelessly and comforted him.\u201cHmm\u2026why? I felt good today because my income was pretty good, and I met that guy at that time. If it wasn\u2019t for either one, then I wouldn\u2019t have brought him. Isn\u2019t this God\u2019s will?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean god\u2026? There are already a lot of useless mouths, so why are you expanding the mouths?\u201d\u201cUgh, don\u2019t get too mad. I\u2019m just following the will of that senior. If you have any dissatisfaction then tell the man who left a will and asked me to do it. Guess what, I don\u2019t like it either.\u201d\u201cWhat, then why not stop it!\u201d\u201cOh, my friend. How can I break a promise so easily just because I don\u2019t like it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a promise\u2026 it\u2019s just a request.\u201dKent rubbed his cheek.After a long silence, he pulled out a bundle of money from his pocket.\u201c\u2026 Stop nagging. I just came back and I\u2019m tired. Aren\u2019t you curious about how much I have earned today?\u201dMoney has magic.The words that Joseph had told Oliver were true here as well, as soon as everyone saw the bundle of money, their anger subdued in an instant.But when Bigfist stretched out his hand for the bundle of money, Kent took it back.\u201cAh\u2026..\u201d\u201cBy the way, it may be me who got the money, but it\u2019s them who turned the garbage into money. So don\u2019t call them useless again.\u201dBigfist kept his mouth shut.Still, he seemed to have something to say.Dark emotions such as greed and dissatisfaction were all visible in Oliver\u2019s eyes.\u201cIsn\u2019t it me who bought you here, Bigfist? Look at you now, you have become the person I can rely on the most\u2026 This friend will also learn and soon, he\u2019ll be able to pay for his own meals.\u201dKent said while patting Oliver\u2019s head.In the end, Bigfist reluctantly opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026 Yes, I\u2019m sorry. I was a bit rude.\u201d\u201cThank you for your understanding. Thank you! Now, here\u2019s the money. Check it together and bring it back. I\u2019ll put it in the joint safe.\u201d\u201cOkay, Kent\u2026 By the way, what was that kid\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cOliver. It\u2019s Oliver. He doesn\u2019t have parents, and he says he was from Wineham.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cOliver?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cSay hello. They are the Sticks that protect us beggars.\u201d\u201cSticks?\u201d\u201cYeah, Stick. It\u2019s a term for those who protect the beggars Union to which they belong.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 hello?\u201dOliver bowed his head.However, the expression of strong beggars including Bigfist and other sturdy beggars didn\u2019t look good.The emotions of wariness and displeasure shone brightly.In a way, it was similar but slightly different from the time when Oliver first went to the Joseph family.\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cOkay. Now that the greetings here are over, I will introduce you to others. Follow me.\u201dOliver followed Kent\u2019s lead.Both came to the old man called Rednose and the boy they met on their way.\u201cDid you remember the two you met on the way?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026Mr.Rednose and\u2026\u201dRednose burst into laughter.\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve been called \u2018Mr.\u2019 in my life. Even though you look gloomy, you are polite!\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAs soon as Oliver\u2019s conversation with Rednose was over, Kent spoke again.\u201cAs you said, this man is Rednose, and he is his grandson Harmonica\u2026 just call them Grandpa and Grandson.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 grandson?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cShe is a woman, so why are you calling grandson?\u201dHis words made Kent and Rednose look at Oliver in surprise.The first one to open his mouth was Rednose.\u201cThis guy\u2026 I thought he would be stupid, but who thought he would have a pretty good eyesight, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cUm, why?\u201dOliver shrugged.\u201cUh\u2026 How?\u201dKent looked at Oliver for a moment before opening his mouth again.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026 Yes, she is a girl. But, don\u2019t say such things in the future. The streets are hard for women to live in. If you were to open your mouth freely outside,\u00a0 then you\u2019ll get hit on your mouth.\u201dOliver nodded his head knowing what Kent meant to say.His words not only contained his anger, but also his concern about the child.Kent seemed to really care about other people here.\u201cThe grandson is good at playing the musical instrument harmonica, and Rednose is good at selling matches. Rednose and his grandson walk the streets together begging.\u201dOliver nodded mechanically.Kent wondered if Oliver understood what he was saying, but he didn\u2019t bother explaining it again.\u201cThey regularly provide a source of income for our beggar Union through begging. They are the precious benefactors that keep us from starving. So, treat them with respect when you are here.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201dKent stared at Oliver silently for a moment and then took Oliver to a corner.The place had living quarters on one side of the abandoned building, and the only dwellings were roughly built tents and old household items.There were more than dozens of people who looked like beggars, and among them, some of them were old men, women, and children.Another unusual thing was the piles of garbage that were wrapped around the walls on both sides.\u201cThese are the ordinary beggars of our beggars Union\u2026. they don\u2019t have a fixed role, but they are no different from the people you have met before. They are our comrades.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Is that so?\u201d\u201cYes, they will be friendly when needed, and when an intruder appears, they fight together.\u201d\u201cWill there be intruders?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Landa isn\u2019t very kind towards the poor. Everywhere things are the same, but it\u2019s worse here. But don\u2019t worry. Nothing happened until recently. Hmm\u2026well, that\u2019s all there to explain. You have to work with them from now on. Anyway, you\u2019ve joined our beggars Union. Just in case, don\u2019t whine if the work is hard. You might have not known, but it\u2019s not easy to join our beggars Union. So, pay your bills by working as hard work as you can.\u201dOliver knew that everything he said was the truth.There was neither cunning nor lies in Kent\u2019s emotions.\u201cYes\u2026 I will do my best. By the way, what should I do specifically?\u201d\u201cWell, if you think you can do anything, then you can do a lot. Whether it\u2019s digging through garbage, getting aids, getting old clothes, running errands\u2026 Since it\u2019s your first time here, I\u2019m going to teach you the easy things you can do.\u201d\u201cOkay, I understand.\u201d\u201cIs there anything else you would like to ask? I accepted you into our Union on a whim, but you still have to do your part and earn your meal.\u201d\u201cYes, I will work hard.\u201d\u201cGood, that\u2019s the attitude. Let me see how long that attitude of yours lasts.\u201dAs Kent was about to leave, Oliver called to him.\u201cUm, wait a minute. Mr. Kent.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me earlier if I had any questions to ask you?\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah\u2026 It\u2019s just a figure of speech, but why? What are you curious about?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Why are you helping me like this?\u201d\u201c\u2026.. Ah\u201dKent looked at Oliver without saying a word, and Oliver looked at him as if he was longing for an answer.After a brief silence, Kent spoke.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll let you know when you become a part of us.\u201dOliver answered with a nod.\u201cYes, I understand. I will do my best.\u201dFrom that day on, Oliver\u2019s unintentional beggar life began.It wasn\u2019t his intention, but it wasn\u2019t too bad either.In the first place, he only had a vague purpose, and there was neither a compass nor a map to his goals.Rather, he thought that he should learn about life in this city.Even though it was a beggar\u2019s life, he thought he might be able to learn something here.And it wasn\u2019t a bad idea.\u201cHey, wake up\u2026 What? Are you awake already?\u201dA fellow beggar who had come to wake Oliver up looked at him and asked in surprise.\u201cYeah, you told me to get up early\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, yes, I did. Still, it\u2019s rare for someone to get up early on their own\u2026.. great!?\u201d\u201cI usually get up early\u2026 Now, what should I do?\u201d\u201cYou have to go to the Church right away. They will give you bread today. So, get dressed and come out right away.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201dAs soon as Oliver answered, he put on a rag that had been folded next to him.He got it after joining\u00a0 Kent\u2019s gang, and it wasn\u2019t really useful, but he would be able to get some money while begging for sure.Without even washing his face, Oliver immediately followed the senior beggars to a place called church.From among the beggars, a beggar who was two or three years older than Oliver murmured.\u201cUgh\u2026 I\u2019m sleepy. I haven\u2019t woken up yet. Hey, rookie. Aren\u2019t you tired?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m tired.\u201dAlthough Oliver replied that way, that was actually a lie.Although just sleeping, eating, and washing was incomparably inferior to what he was doing when he was leading the family, it wasn\u2019t too much of an inconvenience for him.Oliver didn\u2019t know exactly why.He did not feel any discomfort in the first place, maybe because he was already accustomed to the harsh environment during his time in the orphanage and mine, or maybe because he was the type who was not very concerned about what job he did.Oliver wasn\u2019t interested in that, so he didn\u2019t think deeply about it, and if there was any inconvenience, then it was the fact that he can\u2019t wash, but that too he got used to quickly.Therefore, Oliver was neither uncomfortable nor dissatisfied with his life as a beggar.Rather, he even thought that it would be very beneficial to remember the little knowledge he learns every day.\u201cIs this Church?\u201dOliver asked looking at the building with brown bricks, dusty windows, and a rusty iron cross.It looked like a collection of three boxes, and there was a black iron fence around the building.However, what stood out more than the desolate building were the numerous beggars waiting near the fence.\u201cYeah, this is Church. Look at the dirty people standing there.\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhhh\u2026.. Damn it, Even though they are beggars, everyone is uselessly diligent.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s time for everyone to get hungry\u2026 Don\u2019t be sleepy and stand in line.\u201dAt his urging, Oliver lined up with the fellow beggars.Well, it can\u2019t be said he was standing in line, he was just standing near the door rather than in a line.Everyone in that place was dressed in tattered clothes, clutching their hungry stomachs, and waiting for the servants of God to open the door.Oliver suddenly became curious and asked.\u201cWhy is the Church giving away bread? That too for free?\u201dThe old beggar raised his finger pointing to the sky and said.\u201cIt\u2019s because that heavenly Father considers it a virtue, to be kind to the poor.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d\u201cInstead, we should humbly say that we love that father very much.\u201dA young beggar intervened suddenly.The old beggar spoke again.\u201cBut, why are you asking about that?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026it\u2019s my first time being a beggar and begging.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s right. You\u2019ve been scavenging through the garbage all this time, haven\u2019t you?\u2026. But, aren\u2019t there any beggars in Wineham?\u201d\u201c\u2026Um. I wasn\u2019t interested in it back then.\u201d\u201cTch tch.\u2026.. That\u2019s why Kids these days are so fu*ked up. You don\u2019t become beggars like us because you are taking life for granted. Your parents are not going to take care of you for the rest of your life, so you have to look around and learn how to live in the world.\u201d\u201cUn\u2026 I see. Thank you, I\u2019ll learn it properly.\u201dOliver said with sincerity.Oliver didn\u2019t feel it when he was at the orphanage and mine, but when he went through a Warlock organization and came out to the world alone, he realized how ignorant he was.In a sense, it could be said that he was more ignorant than a beggar.The beggars felt conflicted by Oliver\u2019s sincere reply, so they didn\u2019t talk back to him.Originally, everyone was disappointed because Oliver came in suddenly, but since he had done everything he was asked to do without a fuss, they felt it was all right.Of course, there were those who didn\u2019t feel like that.Oliver asked.\u201cThen, they are giving this because God thinks it is a virtue to give us this bread?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 that\u2019s the official reason, and there are the other direct and indirect reasons as well.\u201d\u201cWhat are the direct and indirect reasons?\u201d\u201cthat\u2019s\u2026\u201dDING DINGAt that time, the sound of the ringing bell spread through the church.At the sound, the beggars, who had been waiting, raised their heads like dogs that were ready to eat.Soon the staff brought the bread out of the Church.The smell of old bread was faint, but all the beggars were drooling, and soon a man in a stiff priest\u2019s uniform came out.\u201cWe will begin the distribution.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45The gate opened at the priest\u2019s words.The black gate made a squeaking noise and the beggars who were dying outside poured in all at once.It looked like water flowing into a sewer.Oliver, too, was swept away by the crowd and went into the church and was able to get in the line after a few mishaps.\u201cI\u2019m glad. It looks like we can get it\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve eaten bread.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dThe beggars who lined up looked at the pile of bread and said to each other.But the whispers were not loud enough to be deafening.Looking back, everyone was looking at the man who was handing out bread and the priest in charge.Nevertheless, the priest and the church staff had a sense of disgust, discomfort, and a strange sense of superiority toward the beggars.It felt like if they were offended then the beggars will be kicked out.\u201cHey\u2026don\u2019t stare at them.\u201dThe old beggar lowered Oliver\u2019s head and said.\u201cBend your head. Look at the ground. Only the ground\u2026 They hate people like us looking at them or making eye contact with them. Don\u2019t blame me if you were to get caught.\u201dOliver lowered his head as soon as he told him to.But that didn\u2019t solve his curiosity.\u201c\u2026can I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cQuestion\u2026? Make it shorter.\u201dThe old beggar looked in the direction of the priest and said.\u201cA while ago, you said there were other reasons for distributing bread\u2026what is that?\u201d\u201c\u2026you want to know that now?\u201d\u201cYes, please.\u201dThe polite yet sincere request made the beggar moan.He looked at the line decreasing, and then he looked at the foot of the priest who was getting closer.\u201cOkay\u2026 I\u2019ll explain it later. Later.\u201d\u201cThank you, Mr. Botti.\u201d\u201cThis bastard\u2026.. Ugh, he strangely makes it hard to refuse.\u201dMeanwhile, the line gradually decreased, and it was Oliver\u2019s turn.Oliver followed Botti by lowering his head and bowing his back while looking down at the ground.Yet, he could still see the staff and the priest giving the bread with a face full of disgust.Is it because of the distance getting closer? Their feelings of looking down became more vivid.\u201cHere you go.\u201dBotti placed the bread in a pre-prepared sack and thanked the priest.\u201cMallelujah. Thank you. Thank you. You will surely be blessed.\u201dThe Priest stood without answering.However, as if it was familiar, Botti took the party and went out of the Church.\u201cWhat a relief. There\u2019s not much bread left. If we had come late, then we wouldn\u2019t have gotten it.\u201d\u201cExcuse me? What happens if the bread runs out?\u201d\u201cWhatever happens, what\u2019s the matter with you? If we can\u2019t get it then we have to just go back\u2026. You have a lot of questions.\u201d\u201cUghh\u2026 we have to go back empty-handed?\u201d\u201cYes. They don\u2019t have any bread, so what should we do? We just have to suck our fingers. Do you think we woke up and prepared to go before sunrise for nothing? Don\u2019t be lazy even if you\u2019re a beggar. Then you\u2019ll get hungry and end up dying.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I see.\u201dOliver replied with a nod of his head.Clearly, beggars associated with Kent were far from lazy.Harmonica and Rednose also went to beg at a preset time.Other ordinary beggars collected garbage here and there throughout the back alleys or collected food waste to eat.The people who took everything for free were the Sticks that were protecting the beggar\u2019s den.Contrary to the contents of the journal he saw in Joseph\u2019s study, Kent\u2019s beggars were very diligent and hardworking.The book described beggars as foolish and greedy creatures who were willing to commit all sorts of horrific crimes, such as selling friends for a penny.So, they were good resources for a warlock to use, but the reality Oliver encountered was different.It was quite interesting \u2013 The gap between books and reality.\u201cAh, everyone stop.\u201dBotti stopped suddenly and said.He looked outside.There were quite a few people walking around.\u201cHey\u2026it seems like it\u2019s been a while since we came from our territory. So, let\u2019s go back.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are we going back?\u201d\u201cYeah, if we take a long walk for no reason, we will only get tired. We have to go a long way, so we have to move now.\u201dEveryone frowned at Botti\u2019s words, but no one denied him.Oliver had seen this a few times before.When collecting trash, beggars avoided crowded places and moved mainly through the alley behind the crowded places.Oliver wondered whether it was because they would become targets of people if they were caught by people\u2019s eyes.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go. Anyway, we\u2019re lucky that everyone got bread, right? Let\u2019s go\u2026 Oh, right. Oliver.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou asked a question before, about the other reasons, right?\u201d\u201cUm, yes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you this only once, so keep it in mind. You\u2019re a member of our den, so I\u2019m telling you specially.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because they want to let the world know that they\u2019re agents of God and saviors.\u201d\u201cSavior\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah, bread is precious to people who are hungry. The people who receive the bread have no choice but to listen to the people who have given them bread\u2026. Besides that, they can also create a good image of helping the poor.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 but why does the Priest didn\u2019t seem to like us?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026, It seems it\u2019s true like Rednose said, you do have pretty good eyesight.\u201d\u201cAccording to the overall flow of the organization, individuals have to follow the rules even if they don\u2019t want to. There are a lot of people like that in that place\u2026.there are even worse people who steal the relief supplies organized for the poor and take it for themselves.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026!?\u201dOliver exclaimed in admiration at the new fact, which was obvious.The Paladin named Joanna he saw was surprisingly clean and clear, but the priests were more different on the outside than he thought.Of course, Oliver didn\u2019t meet all the Paladins and Priests, but he did somehow see through some of them \u2026 It was interesting.Oliver felt fun learning about new facts.The irony about things made him feel curious.\u201cUm, how do you all know about that?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s nothing. We were just bragging, but it was something we heard from someone.\u201d\u201cSomeone?\u201d\u201cFrom the Priest\u2026\u201d\u201cPriest?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a real priest, but that\u2019s what we called him\u2026 Now he\u2019s dead, but he treated us equally and taught us this and that. He was a good guy.\u201dOliver saw respect in Botti\u2019s emotions.The same emotions could be seen in others which was a rare thing.It felt strange for Oliver, he believed that once you die then it\u2019s the end, but here a dead person was respected.Someone said it as if to prove it.\u201cI don\u2019t know if what he said was real or not, but anyway, he\u2019s a great person. He taught us how to have a conversation with other beggars without fighting, and he even brought Kent along.\u201d\u201cMr. Kent?\u201d\u201cYes, actually, it was the priest who brought Kent here. He\u2019s gotten a lot sassier now, but his personality wasn\u2019t normal at first.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. He looked like a corpse, he would get angry like a seizure even with the slightest touch. But now he is different.\u201dHe is different now.Oliver\u2019s curiosity got turned on.He was different now and Oliver wanted to know why.Botti suddenly interrupted Oliver who was about to ask more questions.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s stop talking about it, let\u2019s not talk about others behind their backs, especially among beggars like us. There\u2019s no human being in this place who doesn\u2019t have a story. Everyone, stop talking.\u201dAt Botti\u2019s words, everyone closed their mouths along with Oliver.Oliver thought it was a sensitive question.Nevertheless, he wanted to somehow resolve his curiosity.It was like he want to scratch the itchy place.\u201cUm\u2026what is there?\u201dOliver asked one of the party members while pointing at a narrow street in the distance.There were several beggars gathered there.\u201cThat\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Freckle\u2019s group\u2026\u2026\u201dBotti said softly.Freckle.Oliver has heard about him a few times but does not know who exactly it was.Oliver took a quick look at them to satisfy his curiosity.There were many people who looked as fierce as Bigfist, and among them, there was an old man who was holding big dogs.There was a gloomy atmosphere.They looked more like gangsters than beggars, and some of those who got caught by them were being robbed of the bread which they had received from the Church.Oliver watched them silently.\u201c\u2026what should we do? Botti? Shall we go back?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 No, we came too deep, and we even made eye contact. It could be even more dangerous if we were to show our fear. So, let\u2019s go forward confidently.\u201dWith those words, Botti walked forward.It was obvious that they were pretending to be strong, and they seemed to be in a much more dangerous situation.Suddenly, Oliver remembered the time when he first met Kent, he remembered that the men who had followed Oliver were also very wary of Freckle.\u201cStop there.\u201dA man with a shaggy beard stopped Oliver\u2019s group.He was wearing a hat that was ripped off.\u201cYou have to pay the passing tax here. You\u2019re all on your way back from the Church, right? Give us half of your food.\u201dAn absurdly imposing attitude.Botti protested against him.\u201cI\u2019ve been living here for over 30 years, I can\u2019t believe I have to pay taxes. What does that mean?\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026! You\u2019ve been a beggar for a long time. And you\u2019re even bragging about it.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you also a beggar?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not just any beggars. Don\u2019t put us in the same group as you guys, I will nauseous\u2026 Anyway, until a while ago, there was indeed no owner in this alley but now it\u2019s different. You have to pay tax to get through.\u201d\u201cHow could there be an owner for the alley?\u201d\u201cIt has an owner from now on. It\u2019s our Freckle. What are you doing? Do you want us to take everything away? Or maybe you will just give half of the bread personally like the one before. My hands are itchy.\u201dThe beggar waved his hands to threaten them.The way he behaves was reminiscent of the Dominic family, and Botti spoke courageously while trembling with fear.\u201cHey, how dare you.\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201dAn old man who was on the side of the Freckle group intervened.He was squatting with several large dogs beside him.Dogs were panting when they were stroked.The old man opened his mouth and spoke.\u201c\u2026 Priests\u2026 No, you are from the Kent gang?\u201dBotti hastily answered.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right\u2026 Aren\u2019t you Olddog?\u201d\u201cI see, just let them go, Henry. They belong to the Kent gang.\u201d\u201cKent? Ah\u2026 the person with a quarterstaff and the one who was once a Solver?\u201d\u201cYes, let them go.\u201dThe beggar called Henry narrowed his eyebrows and said.\u201cQuarterstaff Kent\u2026. Contrary to what I heard, his subordinates are not young, and they all look like weaklings. Especially, that guy.\u201dHenry said while pointing towards Oliver.Looking at it from the outside, it sounds like a true statement.\u201cThey are the people below that fellow\u2026 just let them go. Freckle doesn\u2019t want to bump heads with him yet.\u201dThings seemed to be going well, but the beggar named Henry opened his mouth in dissatisfaction.\u201cOh, I also want to let those guys go, but I don\u2019t like the look on that old timer\u2019s face?\u201dHe looked down at Botti and said.\u201cYou dare to compare me with you sh*tholes, Oldtimer.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that true?\u201d\u201cWe are not dirtbags like you guys. How about we check that out, Oldtimer?\u201dAfter those words, the other beggars who were watching the situation began to surround Botti and others with clubs and bats.\u201c\u2026 Hey, Did you forget Freckle\u2019s orders? What are you doing?\u201d\u201cWhat if I\u2019m doing it on my own?\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 It\u2019s not on me. Whatever you\u2019re going to do has nothing to with me. Do whatever you want to?\u201dThe old man stroked the whining dog and started smoking something.Henry spoke while tilting his head.\u201cHey, did you hear that? Do whatever you want.\u201dAll of a sudden, they were surrounded.Everyone felt very tense, but at that moment, a finger-snapping sound was heard.\u201cThen, it means I also can do whatever I want. Is that right?\u201dKent appeared from the other side.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46The atmosphere changed in an instant when Kent appeared.The face of Botti who pretended to be brave brightened noticeably along with the other fellow beggars.Their emotions and their expressions changed from nervousness to calmness and from fear to relief and joy, it was a sight that looked very interesting to Oliver.He wondered how could such a change in emotions happen with just the appearance of a single person.Joseph and the pharmacist also had this kind of influence on the people under them but it was a completely different change. They merely provoked tension in others, but Kent, on the contrary, relieved tension and provided genuine relief.Kent was different from the first time he saw him.Oliver wondered and even became more curious about why Kent was so popular and why he was supported by everyone.There was no one who was unhappy on his arrival and Kent gave a lot of them relief and faith.Oliver pondered whether it had anything to do with him always helping them for no reason.Oliver felt an intolerable curiosity starting to itch.\u201cNow, what are you going to do? Young friend.\u201dKent walked over to beggar Henry and asked.Kent extruded a sense of intimidation that did not suit his limp legs, shabby appearance, and wrinkled face.Olddog, who was petting the dog, started to step back along with the other beggars.They didn\u2019t show it outwardly, but they looked flustered on the inside as they slowly backed away.Except for only one person, Henry.Hot emotions such as anger surged through his heart.\u201cYou\u2019re the quarterstaff Kent? Once known as a famous solver? Really? It doesn\u2019t look like that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care whether you believe it or not, Young friend. After all, Now I\u2019m just a beggar. In that sense, I\u2019m giving you some advice as a senior.\u201d\u201cAdvice?\u201d\u201cYeah, advice. Like you, once I used to use my fists pretty well, but now I forgot about those days because I am just a beggar. Even if you use your fists well, in the end, you\u2019re still a beggar.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t compare me with an old man like you. Looking at those limping legs, it seems like you were forced to become a beggar, but I\u2019m the opposite.\u201d\u201cOh, you are stupid my friend, whether you become a beggar voluntarily or unwillingly, a beggar is a beggar, but rather than that answer my question. What were you trying to do?\u201d\u201cYeah, What am I trying to do? Umm\u2026 Let me see\u2026 Ah! Fu*king that bastard. I was going to beat those bastards with my fists and going to hang them naked even without their panties. Exactly like this!\u201dHenry shouted and swung his fists.There was a knuckle in his hand that no one knew when he wore it.Kent\u2019s face would have been broken like a rotten watermelon if it was right on the mark.But before Henry\u2019s fist touched him, Kent pulled his neck back slightly, thrust out the quarterstaff he was using as a cane and hit the attacking arm.Then, to Henry\u2019s surprise, his fists were stopped.Kent blocking the attack made Henry\u2019s face turn red, he rushed towards Kent once again, and Kent, like before thrust the quarterstaff and this time reached to Henry\u2019s neck.Kent\u2019s actions were fast and free-flowing.If Henry hadn\u2019t grabbed his neck, the quarterstaff might have struck his throat.\u201cIt seems like I Underesti\u2026.\u201dHenry couldn\u2019t finish his words.Because Kent swung the quarterstaff and hit him in the temple.Henry collapsed like a puppet with threads cut off.Seeing that Freckle\u2019s gang of beggars rushed toward Kent.However, it was meaningless.When the first two who rushed in collapsed in the same way as Henry, everyone hesitated to approach Kent.\u201cDo you want to continue?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dAs the sense of tension increased someone intervened.\u201cLet\u2019s stop here.\u201dThe speaker was an old man surrounded by dogs.He said crouching down.\u201c\u2026Olddog. When did you go under Freckle?\u201d\u201cWhat can I do on my own?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a bit surprised. I know you weren\u2019t the type to work under someone?\u201d\u201cSurprised? Type? Huh\u2026 If you want to make a living, you have to do unexpected things. Rather, your skills are still the same. You are still like a ghost?\u201d\u201cMe\u2026 Ghost? You\u2019re saying that because you haven\u2019t seen a real ghost. I\u2019m barely able to protect my own body. Are you going to fight me?\u201dAt those words, the big, ugly dogs that the old man was petting growled.Olddog whimpered even though he was sulking.Something seemed very uneasy.\u201c\u2026no, Freckle has ordered me to occupy this alley. I don\u2019t mean to fight with you.\u201d\u201cGO BACK.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026. Hey, what are you looking at? Pick \u2018em up.\u201dAt the words, Freckle group beggars lifted the fainted Henry and the fallen fellow beggars with mixed feelings of dissatisfaction and fear.Olddog got up.\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll get going\u2026 and, I have to report this to my boss.\u201d\u201cBoss. Is it Freckle?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right\u2026 Just in case, how about joining Freckle\u2019s group like me? Then, your Union will be able to live well.\u201dKent\u2019s emotions swelled up with concern for a moment, but it was only a brief moment.\u201c\u2026 To be honest, it\u2019s tempting, but I can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou fool. Well, I knew you would say this.\u201d\u201cI know I\u2019m a fool. If I weren\u2019t one, I wouldn\u2019t have accepted that damn will of that guy\u2026.\u201dOliver couldn\u2019t understand the conversation.However, he could see that Kent shares the same emotions as the olddog.Judging by the context of the story, it seemed that Kent was talking about the priest, who led the beggars union before Kent.Oliver wondered again, how can a person who is already dead have such an influence?Doesn\u2019t the dead lose their influence once they die \u2013 Like Joseph, Anthony, and Dominic?Oliver got more and more curious.Once olddog left with his men, Botti spoke.\u201cHa\u2026you came at the right time. How did you get here?\u201d\u201cI was just walking around and heard that there were people stealing the bread here. I came just in case. Is everyone okay?\u201d\u201cAre we okay? Of course not! How long have you been living in the streets? Even loaves of bread aren\u2019t safe here.\u201dBotti said while raising a bag full of bread.Kent also opened the sack that he brought.The sack was full of damaged onions, potatoes, carrots, and corned beef.\u201cGood. We can have a proper meal today\u201dAs soon as they got back, the party started preparing for dinner.No, to be exact, it was prepared by Kent.He started a fire with broken furniture, then crouched down on the floor and started slicing those ugly vegetables.Whether it was to cook them easily or to share them evenly, he cut the minced meat into small pieces and put the corned beef in a hot pot, and greased it with oil.After applying some oil, Kent cooked some potatoes, followed by vegetables such as carrots and onions.Inside the abandoned building, which was the beggar\u2019s den, a faint smell of food filled with warmth spread.After the vegetables were cooked to some extent, Kent drained the water, then the hard biscuits were crushed with a knife and poured in. Then, the corned beef was put in.\u201cKent\u2026.\u201dBigFist, who stood as a guard outside, approached Kent who was cooking\u201cAh, welcome. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026 I have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026Rednose and harmonica are back.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s good. We can all eat together.\u201d\u201cYou know this isn\u2019t good news, right?\u201dBigfist spoke in dissatisfaction while Kent didn\u2019t say anything.Silence filled the space because they know what it means to some extent about this profession.However, knowing that silence would not solve anything, Bigfist spoke first.\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s a beggar crackdown period again. Our income is getting smaller and smaller.\u201d\u201cWe can do more side jobs. I got a lot of work just in time. I was asked to look for some trash at the three-way intersection right in front of us.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a penny compared to what was offered by the old factory owner, the grumpy restaurant owner, or the gangsters. It\u2019s a regular job, and it\u2019s more money. If we continue this, then we will only have to eat and live.\u201d\u201cEat and Live. Isn\u2019t that a good thing? We won\u2019t be starving.\u201d\u201cKent\u2026!\u201dBigfist roared.The voice was so loud that everyone in the den heard it, but everyone pretended not to hear it understanding the serious mood.Bigfist regained his sanity and whispered again.\u201cIt can\u2019t be like this. No \u2026. If the crackdown is severe, there won\u2019t be any income. Tightening the belt can\u2019t be a solution. We need to be more active.\u201d\u201cBe active. . . . didn\u2019t we decide not to talk about it?\u201d\u201c\u2026.don\u2019t think of it as going down, think about it as cooperating. Freckle wants Kent, and if we cooperate, he will guarantee money and safety.\u201dKent looked at Bigfist while cooking.His eyes were soft, yet powerful.The power to crush those who want to make the wrong move.\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. You\u2019re right\u2026 Going under Freckle will definitely make life easier and more stable than it is now.\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say to go under him. Just cooperate with him.\u201d\u201cYeah, it would be easier to cooperate with Freckle than going under him, but\u2026 you do know what that Freckle is doing, right?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it just a rumor?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no smoke without fire. Especially the one regarding, crippling children and human trafficking.\u201d\u201c\u2026.Even if the rumors are true, why does it matter? If the rumors are true, we should cooperate more. If we stay still, without doing anything, we\u2019ll be eaten by that guy.\u201dDog eat dog world.It seemed like the world of beggars here also had conflicts like the warlocks in wineham.So everyone seemed to be on the lookout for Freckle.Kent thought for a moment, then spoke again.\u201cIf we go under Freckle, we can stay in a decent inn with a roof and get a decent amount of money every week\u2026but, it doesn\u2019t suit me.\u201d\u201cKent\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m tired of living like that. I\u2019m fine just by eating and living what I have. If it\u2019s frustrating for you, I won\u2019t stop you from leaving. But that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t drag me in. I\u2019m serious.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, I see. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThinking that there was no point in persuading anymore, Bigfist answered meekly.He seemed to be convinced on the outside, but on the inside, he was full of dissatisfaction.Like Bigfist, Oliver also didn\u2019t understand Kent.Most people are attracted to more money, comfort, and safety\u2026at least that\u2019s what Oliver has seen.However, Kent resisted this temptation.The important thing here was, that Kent was interested in that.He was obviously not swayed by the temptations of money, comfort, and safety.He understood the sweetness of those temptations, yet still, he pushed it away with his own will.Oliver wanted to know.Why he was giving up on something that attracts him more?Oliver thought, that maybe it was the driving force that drew positive emotions to other people.Oliver really wanted to know.Oliver opened his mouth as he pondered over the conversation he had heard through the minions.\u201cUm\u2026\u2026. I need to know about Freckle?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47There was a small fight with the Freckle\u2019s gang, but Oliver\u2019s daily life did not change much.To make a living, Oliver woke up every day early morning and went scavenging on the streets.As the days got colder, the number of streets Oliver and other beggars went scavenging increased.\u201cAre you all here?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe sweaty and stinking beggars answered.\u201cThen, pour it out!\u201dThousands of garbage poured out of the sack.There were old pots, broken furniture, old clothes, and bent tableware, all of which can be reused.But the most important of them was paper waste.To be exact, it was paper waste that was cut or torn.The garbage collectors crouched down and began sorting the paper wastes.They carefully sorted it so that it did not mix with other garbage collected from elsewhere.After sorting it out, they brought it to the old man crouching in the corner and the middle-aged beggar with glasses.\u201cIt was collected from the restaurant in the front.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cThis was collected from the dog house in the back.\u201d\u201cLeave it there\u2026\u201d\u201cThis was collected from the factory trash can.\u201dWhite and yellow paper wastes piled up like a mountain in an instant.The old man and middle-aged beggar just nodded their heads each time making a squeaky sound.They looked very tired, but nevertheless, they didn\u2019t stop working on the paper.Oliver has asked in the past why they are doing this, and they answered that they were making money out of trash.From the documents of the rival stores or factories, they try to understand what they do and with whom they partnered to do their business and who their clients are.The price of that information usually ranges from several hundred to several thousand bucks. Even though it can\u2019t be called a side job, it was quite an important source of income.Oliver asked curiously later.\u201cWhy are they the only ones doing that? Shouldn\u2019t we help them too?\u201d\u201cHuh? How can we help them? Can you read?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, that\u2019s right.\u201dOliver suddenly remembered a fact which he forgot \u2013 Everyone can\u2019t read and write.Even he himself learned how to read and write, just a few months back.It was a great thing that Marie and the people around him knew how to write.Then a new question arose.\u201cUm, how do they know how to write?\u201d\u201cYou have a lot of useless questions. Still, you\u2019re not lazy, so I\u2019ll answer you\u2026.. The former head, Priest taught them.\u201d\u201cPriest?\u201d\u201cUn, yeah. Thanks to Priest, they got to know about this job, and these days, we\u2019ve got competitors, so the price has decreased a little, but anyway, we\u2019re not starving.\u201d\u201c\u2026If they learned it from the former head, then does it mean that they have been here for a long time?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. They\u2019ve been here longer than Kent, so they are very knowledgeable people.\u201dAt that time, an angry voice was heard.\u201cWhat are you all talking about? Hurry up and collect the useless garbage!\u201dAt those words, the beggars who had been lazily standing around began to move quickly.Usable garbage was left in the corner, and the remaining garbage was put in sacks and taken outside.After that, they threw it in the trash can that they had brought with them, and once it was completed, it would be the end of a single task.It was a simple job, but it was hard enough to make Oliver\u2019s stomach feel strange, so he was guaranteed some rest after work, and usually, Oliver only took a break to recover his physical strength.However, today that was not the case.\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dOliver walked over to the group of beggars and spoke to them.They looked at Oliver with a mixture of tired and annoyed eyes.\u201c\u2026what is it? I\u2019m busy.\u201d\u201cCan I help you?\u201dAt that, everyone stopped what they were doing and looked up at Oliver.Everyone had an absurd expression on their faces, Oliver noticed that and opened his mouth first.\u201cI know how to read. I learned it.\u201dEveryone was silent.Their emotions shone with wonder, displeasure, doubt, and vigilance.The beggar with glasses asked.\u201cDo you know how to read?\u201d\u201cYeah, I learned it a long time ago.\u201d\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you said anything about it until now?\u201d\u201cBecause nobody asked\u201d\u201c\u2026. a plausible reason. Then, why did you suddenly talk about it?\u201d\u201cThere is something I want to ask you, and\u2026 I learned that, if you want to ask for something, you have to give something.\u201d\u201cYou have learned well. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to help. This is not possible just by reading texts\u2026 look.\u201dThe beggar with glasses lifted a small piece of paper.It was about the size of a finger, where two small letters were embedded.\u201cReading is basic, you have to analyze the shape of torn paper and match it like a puzzle, and then you also have to infer sentences and words by looking at the blank letters. Just reading the text doesn\u2019t help.\u201d\u201cAnalyze, infer, analyze, infer\u2026.understood.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dThe beggar with glasses felt ridiculous\u2026No, he looked at Oliver with slightly annoyed eyes.\u201cOkay\u2026 You just don\u2019t back down. Then, guess what\u2019s on the paper over there. However, if you don\u2019t get it right, you\u2019ll be slapped in the ear. Since we\u2019ve been distracted by you.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201dOliver replied bluntly and went to the front where the papers were piled to one side.It looked like it had thousands of pieces that were torn apart very carefully.Everyone looked at Oliver.Oliver quickly focused on the immediate task at hand.\u201cAnalyze, infer, analyze, infer\u2026\u201dOliver muttered and suddenly began to line the torn paper one by one on the floor.Then, as he had heard before, he focused his attention only on analyzing and inferring.After a long silence, Oliver finally began to move.He picked out a few pieces of paper and began to fit them noticeably fast.More than half of it was right, and Oliver looked at the context of the paper, took out one of the papers, and re-arranged it.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026\u201dThose who were looking around spit out admiration one by one.A newcomer was doing a job that takes a few days to complete in just one day.Oliver completed a sheet of paper before he knew it.Looking at Oliver, the beggar with glasses said\u201c\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s fast.\u201dHe talked like it was normal.It was so heterogeneous that he didn\u2019t know how to react just like everyone.As an awkward silence fell, the beggar with glasses opened his mouth.\u201cWell\u2026 that\u2019s good. We have a lot of work anyway. Can you help us more?\u201d\u201cOf course\u2026 then can I ask you something instead?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dThe eyes of the beggar with glasses shone sharply.As if trying to pierce what\u2019s inside.\u201cI almost got beaten up by some beggars a while ago.\u201d\u201cI heard. Kent helped you\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, by the way, who is this Freckle?\u201d\u201cWhy are you curious about that?\u201d\u201cJust because I kept hearing this name in the neighborhood and I too almost got beaten up? Don\u2019t you think I should know?\u201dEveryone looked at Oliver quietly.Their eyes were full of vigilance.They wondered why he was asking and whether it was a natural curiosity.They felt weird looking at Oliver, who was curious about the predator rather than fearing it.Oliver was unaware of this, and a silence that Oliver could not comprehend continued to descend.After a while, the beggar with glasses slowly opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026\u2026 The guy who settled in this neighborhood last year. He is called Freckle.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026.\u201d\u201cRumor has it that he is a Solver, a former soldier, and a gangster.\u201d\u201cIs that why everyone says, he is dangerous?\u201d\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t like that until a year ago. He was just a bit violent, nothing much. But he had changed all of a sudden in the last few months.\u201d\u201cHow? Can you be specific?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know where he got the money from, he suddenly recruited beggars who were good at using their fists, and then pulled the beggars in the neighborhood into his gang one by one\u2026 He even crossed to the other beggar union\u2019s zones.\u201d\u201cHe was such a jerk\u2026\u201dSomeone mumbled low.\u201cIn places that had been suppressed by such force, money is stolen every month in the name of taxes. Also, using that money he hires gangsters\u2026 and\u2026 there are also dangerous rumors about him these days.\u201d\u201cDangerous rumors?\u201d\u201cYeah, rumors like kidnapping and selling the beggars. Somewhere like slaves or lab rats.\u201d\u201cAh, I heard that too. There is even talk of him having a deal with a warlock?\u201dSomeone interrupted.However, the beggar with glasses dismissed it as a false rumor.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not possible. That\u2019s too far\u2026why would a warlock come here?\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cRight\u2026.\u201dOliver observed everything in silence.The beggar with glasses spoke again to Oliver.\u201cAnd you can\u2019t talk about a warlock even if you\u2019re curious. You shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause they are very dangerous.\u201d\u201cDangerous?\u201d\u201cYes, they say that warlocks use people as ingredients, and they even interact with demons if necessary. They are very dangerous people\u2026\u201dOliver immediately thought of Joanna.She also said something similar.Oliver thought about whether what Joanna said was true.He was also convinced that it didn\u2019t seem completely wrong when he thought of Joseph, Andrew, and Dominic\u201cBut why are you interested in that?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 just curious.\u201dThere was an awkward silence again.At that time, someone opened their mouth.\u201cAnd what will happen in the future?\u201dOliver and the beggar with glasses turned their heads.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou know, Freckle is expanding his power these days. Not only small beggar unions but also large beggar unions have joined him\u2026 To be honest, I\u2019ve heard that Freckle\u2019s group is not called beggars these days.\u201dWith those words, anxious emotions rose everywhere.It was as if they had recalled a fact they had forgotten long ago.\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cBottie said, Olddog ended up going over there\u201d\u201cReally? That Olddog?\u201d\u201cI heard that he blocked the street and asked us to pay the taxes. If we don\u2019t like it, they told us to move into their union.\u201d\u201cUh-huh, I heard it too.\u201d\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to go into such a union?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThey are doing better than anyone in all of District W, so do we need to fight? Kent is worth his name, so if we go in, I think they\u2019ll treat us well\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026 Maybe our livelihood and Kent\u2019s will get better if we join them.\u201dAlong with the murmur, numerous opinions and many emotions shone from all over.There were those who said that they would rather change with the time, while others said that they felt uncomfortable, and there was also a sense of obedience to just follow what Kent decides.The old man who had been working silently at the corner in the midst of such a disturbance spoke.\u201cIDIOTS\u2026 If Kent wanted to just live a comfortable life, he would have long left this place.\u201dAt those words everyone shut their mouths as if they agreed to what he said, a kind of belief in Kent\u2019s character.\u201c\u2026\u2026does it have anything to do with the former head?\u201dEveryone looked at Oliver at the sudden question.\u201cWhy are you asking that?\u201d\u201cI am curious?\u201d\u201cWhy are you curious about that?\u201dA voice intervened from behind.When Oliver turned around, he saw Kent holding a quarterstaff in one hand.Oliver spoke while looking at Kent.\u201cUm, hello?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48\u201cYou\u2019re done already?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIn the backdoor of a bar, a muscular man looked at the papers glued together.He was the owner of the bar.\u201cHmm\u2026 was there such a store? It looks like a new one?\u201d\u201cAn illegal brewery in the back alley often looks like a mushroom after rain.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 Thank you. We should make a deal with this store too.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want your thanks, I want you to just pay for it.\u201dKent said while rubbing his thumb and index finger.The bar owner smiled and pulled out a bundle of money from his pocket.Just as he was about to hand it over, the owner of the bar took the money back and asked.\u201cHow did you do it so quickly? It usually takes a few weeks to complete a normal request, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIs it a problem to be fast?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem, but I\u2019m curious.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re asking for someone else\u2019s business secret, and I wish you could give me my money.\u201dThe bar owner looked at Kent for a moment and then gave the money.\u201cCould you work one more time at the same speed?\u201d\u201cHuh? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou know, we\u2019ve got a lot of customers here and there, right? You made it just in time and there is a guest who needs your talent.\u201d\u201cWho is the client?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a solver.\u201d\u201cWhat about the sheet?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 about 40 sheets?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the price?\u201cIt\u2019s a big one under the premise of restoring everything. Normally, I\u2019d have to get a commission, but I decided to wave it off for you. Also, it should be done in a single week. My guest is in a hurry.\u201dThinking about the generous conditions, Kent showed interest.But instead of accepting it right away, he looked at Oliver.Seeing Oliver nodding his head, Kent opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026 Great. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\u201cAll right. Wait a moment.\u201dThe bar owner brought a bundle of garbage in a bag as if he had been waiting for the moment.It was quite bulky and Kent wrapped it lightly.Before Kent was about to leave, the man spoke as if giving a warning.\u201cNow I\u2019m going to tell my guests not to worry. That means if you fail, I fail, which means I will lose my credibility. I warn you, never fail. I value my credibility.\u201d\u201cAll you have to do is prepare the money. Don\u2019t bullsh*t me like you used to.\u201d\u201cWhen did that happen, and you still remember that?\u201d\u201cTime doesn\u2019t matter. What\u2019s important is what you did.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 Keep your promise. Now, get out.\u201dThe bar owner slammed the back door after saying that.As Oliver and Kent started walking, Oliver asked Kent.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cHuh? Ahhh\u2026 Someone kept stealing my money when I was working here. So I made a lot of fuss.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d\u201cFor some reason, it almost turned into a big fight, but in the end, everything turned out well. And the stealing was gone.\u201d\u201cI see. Did your money got stolen a lot?\u201d\u201cYes, quite a lot\u2026 That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to work, but more than that, it\u2019s important to protect your money. How miserable would it be if you can\u2019t even touch a single penny of your hard-earned money? You need to be vigilant so that they won\u2019t take what\u2019s yours.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Was it the same when you were a solver?\u201d\u201cHuh? Well.., yeah. At times, you may lose something more important than money.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, now it\u2019s my turn to ask the question. What happened after you escaped the crisis thanks to the Paladin?\u201dTo understand the conversation now, we had to go back in time, a few days ago.When Oliver first helped with organizing and inferring the shredded papers in the trash, Oliver, while pretending to be asking about Freckle, asked about Kent and the former head, and got caught.Kent called Oliver privately and asked why he was asking that.Oliver judged that it was not possible to avoid the question, so he answered honestly because he was curious.He said that everyone here knows about Kent and the former head, and he was so curious because he didn\u2019t know anything about them.Kent looked at Oliver without saying a word and then ordered him to put the papers together again.Oliver thought of this as a kind of opportunity and used his best abilities to complete more documents faster than everyone else combined.As soon as Kent confirmed his talent, Kent gave him a suggestion.\u201cIf you keep helping, I will answer your questions. Instead, you have to answer my questions too.\u201dThus, Oliver was formally qualified to question Kent.Of course, Oliver also had to answer Kent\u2019s question, but it was not a big problem.He told him about his experience by making a slight change to the existing facts.For example, the fact that he was brought from the mine by Joseph was honestly told, but he omitted killing Joseph.He only told some facts about Joseph being dedicated to a strange ritual, and when his life was in danger, he was saved thanks to the Paladins of the church who came to catch the warlock at that time.Hence, a great lie was born with just a few omissions.\u201cUm\u2026 I ran away. And I hid in a truck parked on the side of the road, and somehow I ended up here.\u201d\u201cUh-huh\u2026\u201dKent looked at Oliver with a doubtful look.His emotions showed that Kent didn\u2019t believe everything Oliver had said, but he didn\u2019t question it.Oliver didn\u2019t know why.Oliver can read emotions but not thoughts.The undeniable fact was, that Kent now thinks Oliver is suspicious, but he didn\u2019t dig deeper into it.Why?Maybe because Oliver is doing a job that makes money?However, something was not quite right.It was because Kent showed a faint glow of pity towards Oliver.Oliver wondered, why would Kent show those emotions toward him.He wanted to ask about it right away, but he didn\u2019t.Oliver knew Kent\u2019s emotions were hidden so deep that he wouldn\u2019t easily answer that question\u2026So Oliver drew Kent\u2019s willingness to answer by asking relatively easy questions.Kent asked again.\u201cThere is something I don\u2019t understand, why did you run away alone without asking the Paladins for help?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I was so scared after seeing them beating and killing Warlocks.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026In a way, it was a good thing. After getting picked by a lunatic, this time, you might have been caught by a fanatic.\u201d\u201cFanatic?\u201d\u201cYeah, even though most of the Paladins have common sense, there is a considerable number of Fanatics, who lacks common sense among them\u2026 After all, this is the age of Wizards rather than Gods.\u201dAge of Wizards rather than Gods\u2026Oliver found the word interesting.\u201cMr.Kent, do you happen to know about Paladins?\u201d\u201cHuh? No, it\u2019s just something I happened to see and hear while working as a solver in the past. I\u2019m not at the level of being familiar with them.\u201d\u201cI see. Can you tell me what a Paladin is?\u201d\u201cThe guardian of mankind who protects the human world from evil according to the will of the great God\u2026\u201dIt was a boring answer.Oliver\u2019s interest dropped sharply, but soon rose, hearing Kent\u2019s words.\u201c\u2026and at the same time, they are the private forces of the Parter religion, and a group of powerful people, spread all over the world claiming to be a guardian of mankind. However, there is nothing wrong with them being the guardians of mankind.\u201dThe guardians of mankind\u2026\u201cIn what sense do you call them guardians of mankind?\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I saw them fighting. They killed warlocks without any hesitation, regardless of what group they are under, and most of them were even proud of it. So, why are they the guardians of mankind?\u201d\u201cThere are cases where the Paladins and the Servants under them misuse their power\u2026 But it\u2019s also true that they are the guardians of mankind. Every time a crazy warlock tries to summon a demon, they unite everyone and block it.\u201d\u201cA demon summoning?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 well, it\u2019s a legend these days.\u201dDemon summoning\u2026Oliver discovered that Warlocks not only trade with demons but can also summon them.It was not even found in the books in Joseph\u2019s study.Oliver gradually realized how ignorant he was.This time, Kent asked.\u201cI understand why you came all the way to Landa, but how did you come to District X? That too, pretty deep?\u201d\u201cI just got off in a hurry and walked around, and I ended up there before I knew it\u2026. I\u2019m sorry that I lied to you the first time we met. I know you don\u2019t like lies.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s okay. If you want to live in a place like this, you should be able to tell lies.\u201d\u201cThank you. Then, can I ask you another question?\u201d\u201cOh my God. You really have a lot of questions.\u201d\u201cUm, yes\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026what do you want to know?\u201d\u201cHow did Mr.Kent end up in this place? You know a lot, and I heard you were an excellent solver?\u201dKent\u2019s emotion fluctuated for a moment.Oliver seemed to have touched a sensitive part, and after a long silence, Kent opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026 If I had to answer, I would say I was unlucky.\u201d\u201cUnlucky?\u201d\u201cYeah, all of a sudden misfortune came, and I rolled over here. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a common, very common story.\u201dKent was telling the truth.However, even though he pretended to be calm on the outside, a deep sadness shone on the inside.In fact, Kent talked about something he hid deep inside him, but it was only a fraction of it.Oliver wanted to know everything.\u201c\u2026 I think you have another question?\u201d\u201cUm, yes.\u201d\u201cIs it about me again?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really curious, why do you have so many questions about me? Are you a homo?\u201d\u201cHomo\u2026? I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. It\u2019s better not to know.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just curious.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cEveryone in the beggars union believes in Mr.Kent so much. They obey everything Mr.Kent says, so I wonder how did you get so much trust.\u201d\u201cHa! I have a bit of a reliable personality. Isn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s my first time seeing someone like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cWithout you hitting them or threatening them, they trust you and follow you\u2026. That\u2019s why I\u2019m curious.\u201dKent looked at Oliver sadly.\u201c\u2026it\u2019s not that great. I\u2019m just taking over what my predecessor did. I\u2019m just maintaining his deeds.\u201d\u201cEven maintaining it, isn\u2019t an easy thing to do, right?\u201dKent stopped his steps and looked down at Oliver.\u201cYou are a very strange child.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt that moment, another question came up in Oliver\u2019s mind.The question was none other than why Kent was keeping him close, even though he finds him strange.Usually, those who felt something like that about Oliver, either resorted to violence or kept their distance, and while Kent also felt something strange, there was no sign of him doing either.Rather, Oliver felt that he was trying to help him while showing emotions of little longing and regret.The emotion was so deep and so secretive.It was like a gem in the underground, so Oliver wanted to know more.Why did he help him without any purpose when they first met, and why does he still help him even when he feels suspicious about him?Why would he discard a comfortable life and protect the fellow beggars?Kent spoke as Oliver pondered with so many questions in his mind.\u201cBy the way, can this request be completed in a week? Judging by the amount of money, I think it\u2019s going to be a few months\u2019 worth.\u201dOliver said while looking at the paper-filled garbage bag.\u201cYes, I think it\u2019s possible.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. Winter is coming soon, so we have to make a lot of money so that we don\u2019t freeze to death.\u201d\u201cFreeze to death?\u201d\u201cYeah, on a cold day, you have to stay in the church, and we need money to stay there too. It\u2019s much harder\u2026..!! What\u2019s happening over there?\u201dKent stopped talking all of a sudden as he looked at the people wandering around at the entrance to the residence.They were Kent\u2019s gang beggars, and they were all in a state of panic.It seemed like something had happened.\u201cKent, Mr.Kent\u2026!\u201dSensing the unusual atmosphere. Kent put off his usual playfulness and asked.\u201cWhat? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cUgh, it\u2019s bad\u2026 Harmonica has been kidnapped.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHarmonica got kidnapped! She was attacked on her way back with Rednose while escaping the crackdown..\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m really sorry\u2026\u201dRednose kept grieving, unlike his usual cheerful attitude.His expression was not a lie.He was really full of guilt for what happened to Harmonica, and couldn\u2019t raise his face in front of Kent.His face was a mess.Since Kent understood how he was feeling, he remained calm despite his anger.\u201cTell me what happened, we can feel sorry about it later.\u201dRednose grabbed his swollen face and opened his mouth.\u201cUgh\u2026 The crackdown officials came, so we ran off to a byway like we usually do.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a byway, it\u2019s a byway that only we know, right?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I hate to say this, but it seemed like they knew that we would come in that way\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t dare say anything you\u2019re not sure about. Then what happened?\u201d\u201cSorry\u2026 Then on our way, a gangster came out and slapped me in the face with something like a stick.\u201dRednose said while pointing to one side of his face, which was severely swollen.\u201cAfter that\u2026 I hardly remember anything. I was too busy getting punched and kicked here and there. However.\u201d\u201cHowever?\u201d\u201cI remember the guy wearing a torn fedora hat spitting on my face and stepping on my stomach while dragging Harmonica.\u201dA torn fedora hat\u2026.Oliver remembered someone.He was the beggar of Freckle\u2019s group that got beaten up by Kent some time ago.Oliver was not the only one who thought of it, soon there was a buzz around.\u201cIsn\u2019t he Freckle\u2019s\u2026?\u201d\u201cMaybe\u2026 Is it because of what happened with Kent?\u201d\u201cWhat are they planning?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I guess it\u2019s because of the humiliation at that time.\u201d\u201cSo, are they holding a grudge?\u201d\u201cMight be, I heard that they\u2019ve got more men, and they\u2019re making a lot of money.\u201dThe anxious emotions grew as they exchanged stories, and soon the emotions turned to fear.Suddenly, rather than worrying about Harmonica who had been kidnapped, they feared that they would suffer the same thing.Except for Kent.\u201cEveryone calm down\u2026. Rednose, how long has it been since she has been kidnapped?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 three or four hours?\u201dIf it was long, then it would have been hard to save but if it was only three hours, then there was a possibility of rescue.Unlike the confused beggars, Kent immediately made a decision.\u201cEven if they had kidnapped the child, they wouldn\u2019t have taken her far away. Bigfist, gather everyone, and start looking for the child right away.\u201dAt that time, a beggar spoke.\u201cAre we going to look for the child?\u201d\u201cOf course, we should. After all, she\u2019s a kid from our gang.\u201d\u201cThe one who kidnapped Harmonica belongs to the Freckle gang, so wouldn\u2019t it be better to go to their place and talk?\u201d\u201cIf it was something that could be resolved by talking, then I wouldn\u2019t have fought them in the first place. We\u2019ll think about it later, but now we have to find our Harmonica first.\u201dKent looked very angry.Although he seemed calm on the outside, he was greatly angered by the fact that Harmonica was kidnapped.Because of that, no one could say anything to Kent.Except for one person, Bigfist.\u201cHey, Kent\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very good idea for everyone to go and look for Harmonica.\u201d\u201c\u2026. What?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that right? If you take the guys out, who\u2019s going to protect this place? It may be an exaggeration, but while we\u2019re away, they may come here.\u201dThe faint anxiety everyone felt suddenly began to turn into fear.Everyone knows that Freckle\u2019s group continues to expand its power.\u201cKent\u2026 I don\u2019t think Bigfist is wrong\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, let\u2019s calm down first\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe you are telling me to calm down\u2026everyone has heard the rumors and knows what happens to the children who were kidnapped by Freckle. We made a living with the money she earned.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, but\u2026\u201dPeople couldn\u2019t say more than that.Even the insensitive Oliver understood roughly what they were trying to say.They were more concerned about their own safety than Harmonica who had been kidnapped.Of course, that was a natural reaction.What Oliver couldn\u2019t quite understand was Kent\u2019s attitude to save Harmonica while putting everyone in danger.It was a very incomprehensible emotion\u2026And, perhaps because of that, Kent was someone unique in Oliver\u2019s eyes.Kent was similar to the Paladin named Joanna, but also different.Amid Oliver\u2019s thoughts, Bigfist made a suggestion.\u201cThen, Kent, why don\u2019t we leave most of the guys here and search for the kid with only you and me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHonestly, you wouldn\u2019t be convinced by letting things go like this, would you? So let\u2019s go find her alone\u2026 It would be better to let the experienced people handle these than those who don\u2019t know how to handle the situation.\u201dTo Kent, who was suffering from internal conflict, Big fist\u2019s opinion was like an oasis in the middle of the desert, and so Kent immediately accepted it.Others felt uneasy about Kent\u2019s departure, but knowing Kent\u2019s personality no one could say anything.Just as Kent and Bigfist were about to leave, Oliver raised his hand.\u201c\u2026\u2026what?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026can I follow you?\u201d\u201cYou?\u201d\u201cYeah, there\u2019s absolutely nothing for me to help by staying here anyway, so if it\u2019s okay, I want to go with you.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll just get in the way, so you can just stay here.\u201dBigfist intervened, but Oliver denied it head-on.\u201cIf you take me, I will definitely be helpful.\u201d\u201cYou will be able to help us out? Hey, kid. I know you\u2019re talented, but this is different. It\u2019s not something that you should get involved with. Try to understand the situation when I\u2019m saying it in a good way.\u201d\u201cOkay, follow me.\u201dKent looked at Oliver quietly and said okay.Bigfist was startled and tried to argue, but Kent simply ignored him.\u201c\u2026 Anyway, there is nothing wrong with taking one more person. However, we are not going to play. If you interrupt us, then we will leave you alone.\u201d\u201cYes, I will make sure that never happens.\u201dKent nodded at Oliver\u2019s affirmation, and Bigfist frowned.Looking at Oliver and Bigfist, Kent said\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201dAlong with Kent and Bigfist, Oliver arrived at the byway where Rednose got beaten.Soon, they found the bloodstains, and it seemed that someone had been attacked there.Oliver looked at the blood splattered here and there representing the intensity of the violence but suddenly he felt something was strange.They were the people who kidnapped Harmonica and beat Rednose without hesitation, but he didn\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t kill Rednose.The person with a torn hat named Henry did seem like a person who would cross the line\u2026and kill a person.Oliver looked towards Bigfist.He wondered if this situation had anything to do with Bigfist\u2019s emotions which looked like a snake.\u201c\u2026there are no traces here. Kent, what did you find there?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026Ah! I found the harmonica that she uses.\u201dKent spoke, as he picked up the harmonica which had fallen in the corner.He was happy for a moment looking at the instrument he had found, but soon resented the fact that it was just an instrument.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else.\u201d\u201cLook here.\u201dBigfist spoke while pointing between the cracks in a building.It was full of dirt and dust, and there were footprints of someone who was presumed to have stood there for a long time.\u201cIt looks like they had been waiting here\u2026 This mark here looks like a stick on the ground\u2026 I think there\u2019s really a traitor in our beggar union.\u201dKent\u2019s emotions subtly shone.He was shocked but still, he expected it.\u201cThey\u2019ve decided to go after us. Ha\u2026 Any other signs?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s nothing more than this. There are only the marks of being dragged and bloodstains\u2026\u201d\u201cUm, Mr.Kent\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? Oliver.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, can I see the harmonica?\u201dKent looked at Oliver strangely at the inappropriate question and then handed the harmonica to him.Oliver took the harmonica and pretended to look back and forth for a moment and look for traces.The truth was, he pulled out the test tube and extracted the emotions in them.[Sensitive nose]Oliver used the extracted emotions to cast black magic on himself.With that, Oliver\u2019s sense of smell grew stronger, and Oliver had to close his eyes tightly at the intense smell he had never felt before.The familiar smell such as the smell of dirt, excrement, rotten food, sweat, and dust smells was combined into one and went straight to his head.It made him remember the black magic that Dominic used in the past.As it had been written in the book, disease-based black magic seemed to put a lot of strain on the body.Oliver rubbed his sticky nose and sniffed the harmonica.He searched for the girl\u2019s smell ingrained in the instrument.Sniff SniffOliver sniffed like a dog.The intense smell bothered his nose, but soon he found the smell of Harmonica, which was fading faintly in the thread of the countless tangled smells.He was lucky.If he had waited a little longer, it would have completely disappeared.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dKent asked while looking at Oliver, who was sniffing into the air.\u201cI found it. Follow me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI found where Harmonica is. Please follow me.\u201dOliver sprinted forward.This was to prevent Kent from asking unnecessary questions, but there was also the reason that the smell was about to disappear.Fortunately, Kent noticed that something was serious, so he followed Oliver without saying anything.Bigfists rushed up and asked.\u201cGeez, where is he going now?\u201d\u201cHe found traces of Harmonica.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the girl?\u201d\u201cYeah, the girl.\u201d\u201cDo you believe it?\u201d\u201cYou can ask questions later, so chase after him. There\u2019s no point in arguing right now, right?\u201dKent interrupted Bigfist\u2019s words like that and limped.Sniff SniffOliver, who was running while sniffing, suddenly stopped in front of a large trash can on the roadside.The huge trash can was bizarrely dirty.The surface was rusty here and there, and there was something like a sticky, smelly black mucus on it, and even beggars would be reluctant to approach it.It even felt like someone made it this way on purpose.Oliver tried to open the lid of the trash can, but he couldn\u2019t open it easily because of the rust, and then Kent, who came after him, helped him to open the lid without asking anything.CREEEEKThe trash can opened with a creepy sound of iron.There was an unpleasant odor and black, sticky mucus all over the place.\u201cOh\u2026 that\u2019s a little harsh.\u201dKent, who almost throw-up, spoke while covering his nose.It was even worse for Oliver, who had a stronger sense of smell due to the black magic [Sensitive Nose]It felt like an explosion exploding inside his head, but Oliver went near the trash can nonetheless.Because the smell of Harmonica remained in that terrible stench.After entering the trash can, Oliver squatted down and searched the floor by dipping his hands in the squishy mucus.Bigfist shouted hastily.\u201cWhat the hell are yo\u2026?\u201dSHUDDER!Oliver pulled out something hidden deep in the floor.With that, the bottom of the trash can opened, and there was a secret passage in which an adult man could enter.\u201c\u2026 Harmonica seems to be down here? And there are other kids too.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50With their bodies covered in sticky mucus Oliver, Kent, and Bigfist descended into the trash can.Their clothes were so sticky and smelly that despite being a beggar, they have to throw away their clothes, but that wasn\u2019t the big problem right now.The smell of the sewers under the ground was much worse than the smell on Oliver, Kent, and Bigfist.As Oliver slowly started to get a headache from a sore nose, he released the spell [Sensitive nose].The smell was still bad, but it was much better than before. At least it didn\u2019t feel like his head was going to break.\u201cArgh\u2026Not again, I never thought I would see another secret sewer.\u201dKent spoke as if he had seen a familiar place, and Oliver upon hearing these words asked.\u201cIs there another place similar to this?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Although Landa suffered major destruction in the past, it was still a city with a long history. It was also an outpost created by the ancient empire and has since served as an important city and stronghold. Over the years as the empire evolved, they developed the underground system, from the ancient sewer systems to the medieval sewer system and modern sewer system. So there are two or three sewers.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why they say there\u2019s a city underneath the city of Landa. Usually, it is used by gangsters, solvers, and some big shots of the underworld.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026don\u2019t the beggars use it? It does smell bad, but it\u2019s warm, so it looks good to use, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good point. But the beggars don\u2019t use it. Most of the sewers are connected to each other, so if you make a mistake, you may encounter a vicious group. A beggar dying is not a big deal for the people, but it\u2019s a big deal for the beggar.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Then, how is the Freckle gang using this place?\u201c\u2026it\u2019s either they\u2019re out of their mind, or they have reliable someone backing them.\u201d\u201cWhat if it isn\u2019t a reliable someone?\u201cWell\u2026they have a lot of brains, so they should either be more confident or they have a deathwish.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dWhile the pointless conversation between Oliver and Kent continued, Bigfist who was following them cut into the conversation.\u201cWait\u2026 Oliver, you\u2026!\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHow do you know there is a secret passage here?\u201d\u201cUm, can I tell you later??\u201d\u201cNo, answer me now. You are very suspicious.\u201d\u201cUm, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing Oliver having a troubled look, Kent said.\u201cFor now, let\u2019s talk about that later.\u201d\u201cKent?\u201d\u201cThe important thing now is to rescue Harmonica. It doesn\u2019t matter how he found this place?\u201d\u201cNo, no matter what\u2026\u201dBigfist tried to argue with Kent, but as soon as their eyes met, he shut his mouth and bowed his head.Oliver could see the anger boiling within him, and it looked like it was going to explode at any moment.\u201cOliver, do you know where Harmonica is right now?\u201dOliver nodded.Oliver released the [Sensitive Nose], not because of the smell, but because he reached near the location, and [Sensitive Nose] wasn\u2019t needed anymore.Oliver began to concentrate with his eyes.Soon, his further strengthened Warlock vision got activated, and various emotions shining in the dark could be seen.Deep inside the sewer, he could see 10 adults guarding some children.\u201cOver there.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cAnd, there are other people besides children.\u201dProbably, the guys who kidnapped the children.As if he had expected it, Kent spoke while holding his quarterstaff tightly.\u201cI don\u2019t care. Guide me. Be as quiet as possible.\u201dOliver nodded and began to walk cautiously.Though it was dark everywhere, it wasn\u2019t a big deal for Oliver who moved with his warlock vision.Kent followed perfectly as if he was familiar with the place, and surprisingly, the one who had a hard time following them was Bigfist.It was like he couldn\u2019t get used to the darkness.\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201dBigfist whispered in a low voice.His face showed annoyance and shame, but strangely, his emotions had more of a snake-like craftiness than a bright light.It was as if he had a different idea, but Kent didn\u2019t notice that, so he ordered Oliver to keep going, and Oliver went deep into the sewer as instructed.TAP. TAP. TAP.As they got closer, they could hear the faint sound of footsteps.Kent grabbed Oliver\u2019s shoulder and stopped him, then he put a finger to his mouth signaling to be silent.The sound of footsteps soon became clear, and even the sound of words they spoke could be heard.\u201cAh\u2026damn it. How long do we have to keep an eye on these sh*ts?\u201d\u201cWhy the fu*k? We can make money by just monitoring these bastards. It\u2019s not hard.\u201d\u201cI get annoyed whenever I hear the sound of the children\u00a0 crying, it makes my head throb\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that why you gave a beating to them a while ago? Keep it in moderation\u2026. Didn\u2019t you get scolded by Henry the other day for that? Don\u2019t damage the products.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t hit them that much. Aren\u2019t children supposed to be raised by hitting them? More than anything, I just hate being in a place that smells like this.\u201d\u201cGet used to it already.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something you could get used to.\u201d\u201cAh, stop complaining\u2026. By the way, where are they going to sell them?\u201d\u201cWell? Maybe they\u2019re going to be sold to a factory or a farm?\u201d\u201cWhat about those girls?\u201d\u201cAh! That\u2019s troublesome. With those ugly faces, they can\u2019t even be sold to a brothel.\u201dAt those words, the person next to him started to laugh.Oliver looked at Kent.His emotions were burning with hatred and anger, but he still kept his composure and did not do anything reckless.He quietly placed his finger on his lips.Then he pulled a knife from his pocket.Holding the long quarterstaff in one hand and knife in the other, he slowly approached them, silently like a cat that was about to catch its prey.Kent was as quiet as a beast, but when he got close enough, he thrust the quarterstaff and stabbed one of them deep in the throat while he struck the other with the knife in the neck.\u201cUrg\u2026!\u201dThe man who got hit by the quarterstaff opened his eyes and tried to resist.But Kent didn\u2019t panic, he twisted his knife to put an end to one, and immediately thrust it into the back of another beggar.His movement was as natural and uninterrupted as a flow of water.What was even more surprising was that there was not a single scream even though the two were killed at the same time.It wasn\u2019t that difficult to achieve it through black magic, but Kent accomplished it with his hands.It was something new for Oliver.\u201cCan you help me clean it up?\u201dAt Kent\u2019s request, Bigfist hid the body in a place where no one could find it.The group moved forward again.The deeper they got, the more the magic lamps had been lightened up.It was hard to move because there were too many people, but with Kent\u2019s skill, they were able to sneak in.Soon, they reached their destination.There were beggars armed with sticks, blackjack, and the children were crouching to one side in fear.\u201cDamn\u2026\u201dKent muttered in a low voice as he looked at their faces.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Kent.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s Harmonica over there.\u201dBigfist looked ahead and asked Kent.\u201c\u2026They got quite the numbers, what are we going to do?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re outmatched, wouldn\u2019t it be better to go out and come with others?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Nah, I don\u2019t know what will happen on our way out, and I have already killed two of them. We have to solve everything right here and right now.\u201d\u201cAh, but.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go ahead and draw their attention. You and Oliver get out of here after rescuing Harmonica. Let the other kids follow you when you escape.\u201d\u201cOther kids?\u201d\u201cYeah, even if all of them cannot escape, some of them may manage to escape\u2026can you do it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Yes, I can.\u201d\u201cThen please.\u201dWith those words, Kent took the knife and went forward as before.Then he threw the knife at the beggars to catch them off guard, and surprisingly, the knife pierced a beggar\u2019s neck with just one shot.\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026 What?\u201dEveryone got flustered.Kent didn\u2019t lose the momentum and went straight into the center of the beggar\u2019s group and began to swing his quarterstaff.He did not just simply swing the wooden stick, his every move had a standardized technique, and Oliver who had never seen such a thing looked at every detail of the skill.The quarterstaff was both his weapon and shield, Kent slashed and pushed the approaching enemy with the staff.\u201cFu*k! Where did he suddenly come out from\u2026\u201d\u201cSurround him! Surround him!\u201d\u201cDamn it! This fu*king bastard!\u201dThe enemy beggars also tried to resist by swinging the clubs and bats, but they failed to take advantage of the numbers due to their lack of strength and skills compared to Kent\u2019s quarterstaff.When surrounded, Kent invariably swung his quarterstaff vigorously breaking the siege, and started knocking down the beggars one after another.Even though he was alone, he overwhelmed many enemies, and at that moment\u2026BANG!A gunshot rang out, and everyone\u2019s eyes turned towards the direction the gunshot came from.A beggar wearing a fedora hat appeared.\u201cHenry.\u201dWhen Henry appeared with the gun, the beggars around Kent ran away, fearing getting hit.\u201cHm\u2026ah! I remember you. You were the one who got beaten up by me recently.\u201dHenry became furious at Kent\u2019s provocation which had scratched exactly where it hurt.He shouted angrily while swinging his gun like a sword.\u201cYou motherfu*er\u2026! You\u2019re acting strong until the end. Let me see if you can act strongly with holes in your body. Huh?!\u201d\u201cWhat? Do you want to shoot? I don\u2019t think you know how to shoot properly, do you? You\u2019ll be more embarrassed if you miss the shot. You\u2019re trying to attack a limping old man with a gun \u2013 That\u2019s very masculine of you.\u201dKent slowly closed the distance with those words, and Henry pointed the gun at Kent\u2019s forehead and said.\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that. Everyone has their own beliefs.\u201dHenry said with a strange smile on his face.Kent felt something was off and looked back.Then, his eyes met Oliver.To be precise, he saw Oliver who was captured by Bigfist.\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201dHenry laughed mockingly.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit off the plan, but it doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 I thought there were only morons under you, but I was wrong, there was also a pal who belonged to this side. A pal who could see the bright future ahead of us.\u201dKent asked while looking at the Bigfist who had betrayed him.\u201c\u2026why are you doing this?\u201d\u201cKent\u2026 thank you for supporting me until now, but just for that, I don\u2019t want to look after those fu*king beggars for the rest of my life. I don\u2019t want to live under you as a beggar for the rest of my life. I\u2019ll do anything to get out of this sh*thole! So throw away your weapons now.\u201dBigfist threateningly shouted at Kent and his voice resounded in the sewer as if he was possessed by evil.Kent dropped the quarterstaff he was holding onto the floor while emitting a surprisingly fragile but pretty light.\u2018\u2026\u2026..why?\u2019Tang-!At the lonely sound of the quarterstaff falling, everyone broke out into laughter one by one.\u201cFuhahahaha\u2026 what a loser, he let go of his weapon for a useless beggar!\u201d\u201cHahahaha\u2026if you asshole die then everything will be over. You know what? Your gang must be already dead by now! That was the original plan. Ah! Our gang would have already reached there by now!\u201dOliver looked at the scene without saying a word.The one who gave up his weapon because of him and the kidnapper who laughed at him for his action.To be honest, Oliver felt the same way as the kidnappers.The act of Kent abandoning his weapon was not a reasonable action even in Oliver\u2019s eyes.Oliver wondered why Kent was exposing his life to danger for someone who had nothing to do with him.No, it was rather like a thing that Kent would do.After all, he was the one who helped Oliver without any motives and brought him to the beggars union.Consistent but incomprehensible self-sacrificing attitude, altruism\u2026 Oliver wanted to know the reason for his action right at this moment.\u201cFu*k\u2026. I want to bully you for a few more days because of my personality, but as you can see I\u2019m also busy here. So, I will finish it off soon.\u201dHenry said as he took a few steps while pointing his gun, and then he pulled the trigger.BANG!\u201c\u2026. What?\u201dEveryone made a dumbfounded noise.They looked at the mysterious black curtain that suddenly appeared and protected Kent.At that moment someone spoke.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there is still something I want to ask him.\u201dEveryone looked in the direction of the sound.They saw Bigfist who lay dead getting pierced by black spikes, and Oliver who was standing in front of him.Everyone looked at him without saying a word while trembling in fear.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51In an abandoned building in District W.There was a loud noise going around.\u201cAhhhhhh\u2026\u201dThe reason for the disturbance was none other than intruders, who came in while the head of the union, Kent was absent.There were many people who were armed with clubs while some of them had an old and rusty rods, and some among them even had shotguns.Because of that, the beggars without their leader could not even resist and were beaten up unilaterally.\u201cHa\u2026! You fu*kers! Come on raise your heads. Raise your heads like you did when you had that fu*ker Kent on your side. RAISE\u2026 YOU MOTHERFU*KERS.\u201dThe intruder with a shotgun said while waving his gun, while the beggars of kent\u2019s beggars union kept looking down.The gun looked like a piece of garbage in which the bullets were not likely to come out properly, but to the beggars who were on the streets, this kind of existence alone was a huge threat.All those who were in Kent\u2019s beggar union were beaten to death, except the weak children, women, and the elderly.They were moved into a corner like a sheep which was surrounded by wolves as they hugged each other.\u201cKeukkeuk\u2026 Cute. Don\u2019t worry. We won\u2019t hit you. You will soon become Freckle\u2019s fodder.\u201d\u201cCome with us when we are talking nicely\u2026 Freckle doesn\u2019t like a product that\u2019s bleeding\u201dSaying that the intruders grabbed the hair of the woman and the children and dragged them somewhere.Some brave old men blocked the intruders, but that resulted in only the brutal beating of the old men.\u201cFuck\u2026! You useless old-timer. How dare you put your fu*king corpse hands on me!!\u201dAn old man sputtered after getting beaten by an intruder.His decrepit body was unable to move after a single attack.Still, he stumbled and clung to the intruders.It was not because there was no other way.It was kind of a rash action that he just have to do.The old man spoke as he was bleeding and panting.\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026 Don\u2019t you who our head is? Once he comes\u2026.comes, yuck!\u201dThe intruder kicked the old man.The old man grabbed his chest at the hit and his body twisted as if he was in great pain, and he looked even more pitiful because of his skinny appearance.However, the intruder seemed not to have even the slightest bit of pity in his heart when he looked at the old man, and as if that was not enough, he even trampled on his neck with his foot.\u201cHey, old timer\u2026 Do we look like idiots? We know who your head is. We came here knowing that he was not here. Do you want me to tell you something more interesting?\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201d\u201cListen to me carefully, old timer. Your head\u2019s head must have been chopped by now by our guys. From now on, everyone here is our possession. Our possessions\u2026! Do you understand?! Consider this news as my gift before I break your head. So be thankful.\u201dWith those words, the intruder who was stepping on the old man raised the wooden club he was holding and aimed it at the old man\u2019s head.The other beggars of Kent\u2019s beggar union just shook their heads and did not raise their heads.\u201cTake a good look, everyone! From now on, District W will be dominated by our Freckle. Everyone who rebels against us will end up like this! One\u2026two\u2026three.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 BANG!At the count of three, the head of the intruder who was holding his bat high in the sky flew off to one side.The damage was much worse than being shot by a gun, and the sudden situation surprised not only the beggars of Kent\u2019s group but also the intruders.\u201cWhat, what the fu*k?!\u201d\u201cCrazysh*t!! Was he attacked?\u201dThe intruders were not able to respond to sudden situations, proving that they too were not properly trained, and ultimately they were just beggars.At that moment, Oliver\u2019s minion approached secretly and shot the beggars armed with shotguns in the head.Everyone froze in fear and terror as if they had met with a ghost.[Creepy Scream]A face with a terrible shape suddenly appeared in black smoke form.Everyone\u2019s attention was focused on the face and at that moment, the face made of black smoke distorted and screamed.KYAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA\u2026\u2026!The air-ripping scream broke the will of the listeners to fight.The intruders, who had been in good spirits until a while ago, were literally frozen at the incomprehensible situation which drove them mad one after another.After all, they weren\u2019t violent people in nature and their courage came from the weapons in the first place, so they had completely lost their will to fight.Two people emerged after the situation was perfectly sorted out.Oliver with a test tube in one of his hands and Kent with a quarterstaff.Kent opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026 Throw away all your weapons and kneel down.\u201dA pile of clubs and a few shotguns were piled at one side of the beggar\u2019s den.The intruders, who had been in high spirits until a while ago, were all trapped in fear.They were all looking down at the ground trembling, and sometimes when they looked up, they saw the minion floating around them and immediately lowered their heads again.They saw the thing that looked like a small meatball blow a person\u2019s head off, so everyone kept trembling as if a muzzle was aimed at their head.Everyone had their fighting spirit and fear in their minds when they came to Kent\u2019s beggar union\u2019s den.Now that their fighting spirit was broken, the only thing that remained in their mind was fear.This made it easy for Kent and Oliver to take care of their fellow beggars.\u201cFortunately, he wasn\u2019t seriously injured.\u201dThe beggar with glasses said looking at the old man who had been beaten.He may not be a doctor with specialized knowledge, but because he had lived as a beggar for a long time, he could roughly see if a human\u2019s bone was broken or if there was something wrong with the internal organs.Kent nodded without any thought.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cNot necessarily. He can\u2019t do anything for a while. He needs to rest for some time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s alright. It\u2019s fine as long as there are no serious injuries.\u201dThe beggars who were frightened were soon relieved by Kent\u2019s words.Then, the beggar with classes carefully opened his mouth.\u201cBy the way\u2026what the hell happened? That guy\u2026 is he a human.\u201dThe one the beggar with glasses pointed at with his fingertip was Oliver.Kent looked at Oliver without a word and after a moment of silence opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026 As you all have seen, he is a warlock.\u201d\u201cWarlock\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Warlock. He said he is a Warlock, and he also showed me the evidence. He was indeed a Warlock.\u201dEven though everyone understood it in their heads, they still couldn\u2019t help but be shocked.For people like them, who were at the bottom of the social pyramid, wizards and warlocks were an otherworldly existence.\u201cThen\u2026 Kent, why the hell did you bring a Warlock?\u201d\u201cI too didn\u2019t know he was a Warlock.\u201d\u201cWhy did a warlock stay here?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I will have to ask.\u201dA woman hugged her child and asked.\u201cIs he going to kidnap our children?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t have helped us if he was going to do that?\u201d\u201cStill, you never know, do you?\u201dThe woman who spoke had a child with her, and she hugged the child tightly in anxiety.Everyone looked at Oliver with anxious eyes.Then someone spoke.\u201cUh\u2026\u2026 Where is that girl going?\u201dEveryone watched as Harmonica approached Oliver alone.The girl bowed her head and thanked Oliver.Oliver looked at it silently and raised his hand and then nodded.It was truly an awkward sight.However, strangely enough, people\u2019s anxiety gradually subsided when they saw this.Kent didn\u2019t miss this opportunity and spoke.\u201cI know everyone\u2019s nervous right now, but leave this to me for now. Oliver is a warlock, but he\u2019s also the person who helped us. He even helped those kids.\u201dKent said while pointing at the 20 or so beggar children, they were the children Kent brought along with Harmonica.Small and messy children filled with anxiety were gathered in one corner.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI know everyone has a lot to say, but first of all, we need that person\u2019s help. Absolutely.\u201d\u201cHelp?\u201d\u201cYeah. Freckle has now started threatening us directly, so we can\u2019t stay still anymore, can we? If we have to fight back, we have to borrow someone\u2019s hand\u2026 Are there any disagreements?\u201dNo one could say anythingUntil a while ago, they were about to be kidnapped by Freckle\u2019s gang.In the end, they were pushed by the situation and the atmosphere, so everyone left everything to Kent.Kent approached Oliver.\u201cCan we talk for a moment?\u201d\u201cUm, yes\u2026 I have been waiting.\u201dOliver responded immediately to Kent\u2019s words.Kent took Oliver to talk privately, even though Kent looked calm on the outside, he was very nervous on the inside, though he did not harbor hostility like others.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dKent carefully pulled a cigarette out of his pocket.\u201cWhoa\u2026\u2026ha-! I hope you can understand. I\u2019m a smoker. Would you like to smoke one?\u201dOliver shook his head.Kent spoke as he smoked again.The words came out along with the white smoke.\u201cFirst of all, let me say thank you again. For helping me in the sewer\u2026.and for helping me like this again. Thank you.\u201d\u201cUm, I got some help too, and I didn\u2019t just help\u2026 it\u2019s all right.\u201d\u201cI know. I know\u2026 It was for answering your questions. Anyway, thanks.\u201dKent was sincere.He felt a great sense of fear and guilt thinking about the fact that he could have lost his comrades.When they were saved, he felt a corresponding sense of relief and joy\u2026\u201cYeah\u2026what do you want to ask?\u201d\u201c\u2026why did you drop your weapon? Throwing it away wouldn\u2019t have helped much in that situation.\u201d\u201cAre you curious about that?\u201d\u201cOther than that\u2026 Why did you help me the first time we met, and why do you keep protecting the people here? I heard that you could have gone on a more comfortable path.\u201dKent closed his eyes slightly and then opened them.\u201c\u2026 Then let me ask you, you look like a skilled warlock, so why did you come into the beggar\u2019s den? It\u2019s been a while since I retired as a Solver, but a warlock of your level would have a much more comfortable way to live.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 there\u2019s something I want to find out.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then I would say I did it because I wanted to.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI just wanted to\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cThere are people in the world who do things that are incomprehensible. There are people who bring, feed, nurse, and comfort those who have given up their lives for no reason. It\u2019s just that I saw it as God\u2019s will.\u201d\u201c\u2026do you happen to be talking about the former head, Mr.Priest?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the story about him and me. To be exact, he brought me and took care of me. And he didn\u2019t expect anything from me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Didn\u2019t Mr. Kent succeed him? Is that his will?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a will. He asked for help, but he told me to leave whenever I wanted to. I\u2019m staying here because I wanted to. After all, it\u2019s a life that I threw away once, I don\u2019t mind if it goes for a Kid or for the people here\u2026\u201dKent smiled a little, and Oliver nodded his head in silence.It wasn\u2019t a convincing answer, but it didn\u2019t seem like a bad answer either.\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s not a very convincing answer, but thank you for your answer\u2026 Then, did you help me in the beginning because of your promise with Mr.Priest?\u201d\u201cTo some extent\u2026but, there is one more reason.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201c\u2026it may sound strange in the current situation, but you look like Dave.\u201d\u201cWho is that?\u201d\u201cMy son who died because of me.\u201dKent looked at Oliver and said.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t care if you think it\u2019s a lie. I just wanted to tell you about it. So I said it.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand\u2026.\u201dAn awkward silence gradually settled down, and Kent looked down and asked again.\u201c\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but can you help us?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026sure.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so glad\u2026 Then, I\u2019ll have to interrogate them first. So, Can you stand behind me for a bit? I think you just standing will help.\u201dKent pointed to the tied-up intruders.\u201c\u2026what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cWell? We should first ask about the den where Freckle is hiding.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand. If they knew you are targeting, won\u2019t they be on guard?\u201d\u201cMaybe, but we can\u2019t help it.\u201d\u201cWhat if you know the location of the den, and there\u2019s a way to let them lower their guard?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Then it\u2019s the best. Why? Is there a better way?\u201dOliver answered while creating black magic in his hand.\u201cYes.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52\u201cSo you couldn\u2019t help it\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, yes! There was no place for us after being chased out by Freckle\u2026 You know too, right!? What happens to the beggars union whose territory gets stolen? We had no choice but to go under him.\u201dOliver, who was watching from behind Kent, asked the Rednose.\u201cWhat will happen if the territory is taken away?\u201d\u201cHuh, uh? Well, I mean\u2026that is, sir\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can speak comfortably.\u201d\u201c\u2026 well, living becomes risky\u2026 if the space to accommodate were to disappear, they would have to either go under another beggars union or have to live in really dangerous locations. If you stay in such places, there are high chances of getting dragged away to Concentration camps.\u201d\u201cConcentration camps?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a place where beggars and poor people are sent\u2026\u201dRegardless of the conversation between Oliver and Rednose, Kent went on with his interrogation.\u201cSo, what you are saying is, you were forced into joining the Freckle gang and were forced to lay hands on my people?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 please understand. Some of my colleagues are held hostage by Freckle, so I had no choice, I couldn\u2019t refuse Freckle\u2019s orders.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026 So, what were you planning on doing after taking everyone from here?\u201d\u201cThat, I don\u2019t\u2026Kek!\u201dThe intruder\u2019s sight blurred as Kent tightened his hold on the intruder\u2019s neck.The other intruders got frightened seeing Kent\u2019s action.In such a chilly atmosphere, Kent lowered his voice and spoke.\u201cDon\u2019t answer my question by saying you don\u2019t know. I hate being fooled, you know what I\u2019m talking about, right?\u201dAs Kent\u2019s intimidation worked, one man opened his mouth.\u201cWe really don\u2019t know, we do know that they are getting sold somewhere\u2026 but we don\u2019t know where. It\u2019s TRUE\u2026 Please believe us.\u201dKent looked at them with a sharp glare in his eyes.As everyone became nervous at that gaze, Kent opened his mouth and spoke.\u201c\u2026 Release them all.\u201dThe intruders as well as fellow beggars looked at Kent in surprise at the completely unexpected answer.Oliver released the intruders at the instruction of Kent.The intruders felt relieved at the sudden situation, but they were also puzzled.One by one, they got up.\u201cReally, are you really going to release us\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah, just deliver my words to Freckle instead.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what he believes in, but if he keeps acting like this, we won\u2019t stand still\u2026 Next time, we\u2019ll come for his head. Tell him what happened and get me his answer within a week. Did you get it?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, yes! I understand! I promise.\u201d\u201cBUZZ OFF.\u201dHearing Kent\u2019s words, the intruders fled the place.All the beggars of Kent\u2019s union looked at those running figures anxiously.Except for Kent and Oliver,\u201c\u2026is this enough?\u201d\u201cYeah, I added [stalker] and [eavesdropper] when you let them go, so it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s rude to ask this, but is there any chance of your magic getting caught?\u201d\u201cUm, maybe not.\u201d\u201cMaybe?\u201d\u201cYeah, It had never been seen through till now\u2026.From the book I read, unless the other person was a warlock who was better than me, he wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 Then, I guess it should be fine. Aren\u2019t you the better one?\u201d\u201cUm, of course, that would be great too, but\u2026 If he was someone who\u2019s better than me, then I can learn something from him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat? Did I say something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re really strange. I\u2019ve met a few warlocks in the past, but never saw one like you.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know a lot about warlocks, but at least the people I\u2019ve met were kind of\u2026 snobs. At best, they were realistic people.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by realistic?\u201d\u201cThey were obsessed with safety and security\u2026 like most humans.\u201dOliver thought about warlocks, including Joseph, Andrew, Marie, and Peter.They were also like that.\u201cAre most of them like that?\u201d\u201cWell, There are warlocks who are not interested in such things, but I don\u2019t want to meet them\u2026\u2026 Because there is a high probability that those kinds of warlocks are dangerous.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not talking about you\u2026\u00a0 By the way, can you help me with something?\u201d\u201cYes, what is it?\u201d\u201cThe fight with Freckle is inevitable. So we need to gather some troops.\u201d\u201cTroops?\u201d\u201cYeah, no matter what, I can\u2019t just rely on you and stand still. If we want to survive on this street, we have to win by ourselves.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026How are you going to gather them?\u201d\u201cI have to buy them. If I had done this by myself, other beggar unions would have complained a lot, but that isn\u2019t the case now.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you are saying, so if you ask for help with me, will they help you?\u201d\u201cThere is a popular saying among solvers.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou can convince people if you have enough money. But, if you place a gun along with money, then you can convince them more efficiently\u2026 Do you not like your face being known?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 maybe?\u201d\u201cThen use this hood.\u201dKent pulled out a hood with eye holes from his pocket.\u201cThis\u2026?\u201d\u201cUse this and come with me. I need your help.\u201d\u201cUm, okay.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Hey, someone get the money from the vault. All of them.\u201d[So what\u2019s the matter\u2026?]There was a man in an abandoned sewerage in the District W of Landa.He was called by the nickname Freckle instead of the name his mother gave him.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 things got messed up and the delivery of the products will be a little late.\u201d[\u2026]\u201cMister. Warlock?\u201d[Delivery will be late?]\u201cha\u2026.\u201dFreckle sighed in annoyance.Although the name Warlock was useful, the authoritative attitude and the tone of speech were hard to endure.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 Yes, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d[I think I told you to set the delivery date correctly?]An arrogant voice that could be heard through the walkie-talkie made Freckle even more irritated.\u201cYeah\u2026 I know. Again, I\u2019m sorry. There was a minor problem.\u201d[I don\u2019t care about your problem. What I want is performance. Not an excuse.]\u201cIf you listen to this, you will change your mind.\u201d[\u2026 Tell me.]\u201cTo put it simply, intruders entered the warehouse and stole the products. However, it seems that one of the intruders was a warlock.\u201d[\u2026\u2026.]Silence came from the communication device.Freckle raised the corners of his mouth thinking that the person on the other side was disturbed.After a while, the voice was heard again.[Are you sure?]\u201cI didn\u2019t see it myself, but my men saw it. They were attacked by a Warlock while they were working.\u201d[Be more specific.]\u201cSuddenly, something like a bullet flew and exploded in the head, and he summoned a face that screamed horribly\u2026 ah, he even made something like a weird meat dumpling.\u201d[Hate Bullet, Creepy Scream\u2026. I don\u2019t know the last one.]\u201cWhat? Even Mister. Warlock doesn\u2019t know?\u201d[\u2026 I don\u2019t know everything about black magic. Maybe it\u2019s a unique black magic that the guy developed on his own.]\u201cAnyway, you freak\u2026\u201dFreckle murmured in a low voice and spoke back into the communication machine.\u201cIs he dangerous?\u201d[I don\u2019t care how dangerous he is. He\u2019s nothing compared to me.]\u201cYes, of course, I don\u2019t doubt it. Of course\u2026 But, the guys under me rely mainly on weapons. If there was someone like that, it would be hard for us to deal with alone, so\u2026 we need help.\u201d[help?]\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry. But don\u2019t get me wrong. I didn\u2019t mean to bother you. But you said you\u2019d help us if we provided what you needed, don\u2019t you think you should help us in this case?\u201d[Be careful with your mouth, Beggar\u2026 Who do you think made that shitty kingdom of yours?]\u201c\u2026 It was all thanks to Mister. Warlock. I will always remember it. Thanks to your support, I gained this strength. But, don\u2019t you know that there\u2019s not much we could do against a Warlock?\u201d[\u2026]\u201cThere, I think the warlock was brought in by none other than Kent\u2026 I don\u2019t know how he got a warlock, but this could delay the District W\u2019s integration that Mister. Warlock ordered.\u201d[Are you threatening me?]\u201cNo, no\u2026.how could I do that? Unfortunately, this Freckle needs the help of the great Mister. Warlock to take care of the sloppy warlock brought in by Kent.\u201d[\u2026]\u201cI have to take control of the beggars in District W so that I can deliver products regularly to you.\u201d[\u2026]\u201cI need to deliver products regularly so that Mister.Warlock can join the \u2018Black Hand\u2019\u201d[STOP IT.]A voice filled with anger could be heard through the communication device.Even Freckle, who was showing a somewhat cheeky attitude, was noticeably nervous at that sound.Although warlocks were called talentless beings, they are still someone who could sweep away everything on their way.Freckle still hasn\u2019t forgotten the zombies he saw back then.[You talk too much without knowing anything]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d[The reason I told you about the big plan is for the sake of progress. Nothing more, nothing less. So, don\u2019t you dare say anything like that? If you want to live as the king of that garbage kingdom, that is.]\u201c\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. Mister. Warlock.\u201d[It\u2019s okay\u2026 Anyway, some warlock intervened\u2026 I wonder who dared to stand in front of Me, the disciple of Puppet Master. Interesting.]\u201cThen\u2026.\u201d[I\u2019ll send my disciple.]\u201cThank you.\u201d[Don\u2019t let anything happen before that?]\u201cThat won\u2019t happen. Kent has now become much weaker. The best proof is that he just sent away the captured prisoners. He\u2019s trying to avoid a fight because of his injured subordinates. He is waiting for my answer now, so there\u2019s no problem until then. If there is any problem, there is still the present given by Mister. Warlock, so there is nothing to worry about.\u201d[\u2026 That\u2019s right. Then, call me back when you need.]\u201cYes, please take care. Mister. Warlock.\u201dA crackling sound came from the communication device.Feeling tired, Freckle placed the communication device aside.\u201cYou did it, leader.\u201d said a subordinate who was standing next to him like a piece of furniture.\u201cHenry, that idiot\u2026\u2026If you can\u2019t do it properly, don\u2019t do it. Because of that idiot, everything is a mess. If he was alive, I would have killed him with my own hands\u2026 Are you sure he\u2019s really dead?\u201d\u201cYes, Leader\u2026the guys who went to look said everyone was dead. It was like they were stabbed by something.\u201d\u201cFu*k\u2026! Where did it go wrong? How the hell did they get a warlock?\u201d\u201cLeader, Kent is a former solver, so maybe he used the people he had made contact with at that time?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026even if that\u2019s the case, a warlock wouldn\u2019t help just like that. Were the reports that they didn\u2019t have any money to feed those useless mouths false? Did they know about Bigfist from the beginning? Or did they pretend just like me?\u201dFreckle was troubled because the plan didn\u2019t go the way he wanted it to.He understood the usefulness of a warlock more than anyone else, and the cost was relatively insignificant.All he has to do is bring the beggars scattered on the streets and offer them.It was a very easy way for someone like him to live.Of course, sometimes the warlock wanted a human with difficult conditions, but that was a problem that could be solved at a small cost.Compared to what he got from having a Warlock behind his back, the lives of beggars who he threw away were nothing.\u201cBy the way, is it all right, Leader? I\u2019m sure the Warlock will ask for something more after helping you.\u201d\u201cOf course, he\u2019ll ask for more\u2026but that doesn\u2019t matter. At best, he is going to ask us to give him more kids and girls. Let\u2019s just pay and clean up the entire District W at once.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI know that Kent is stupidly kind, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a guy who would let go of the enemies.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about middle-aged brothers, leader?\u201d\u201cYeah, if it were me, I would have killed them.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026. I searched through their bodies, but there was nothing to be found. Maybe they were just released out of goodwill? After all, Kent is that kind of a human?\u201d\u201cThen, I guess it\u2019s fine\u2026\u201dAt that moment, the sound of footsteps of someone rushing in came, and soon someone opened the door.Due to the nature of the basement, the sound got even louder.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cFreckle! We are fuc*ed. It\u2019s Kent\u2026Kent came in with the beggars from other unions.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53\u201cGo go go\u2026!\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u2014\u2014\u2014!\u201dAt the entrance of the huge sewer in District W, dozens of beggars could be seen fighting.Even though they were using weapons like clubs, swords, and knives, none of them were good at fighting.They were desperate to survive in this merciless world.\u201cGo through! Go through! Go through!\u201d\u201cI liked it when he said there were a lot of people! But, each and everyone is fu*king useless!\u201d\u201cCome on! Don\u2019t fall back.\u201dPigibib from 2nd street.Eren from 17th street.Baldhammer from 25th Street.Scavengermouse from 42nd Street.Countless beggars led their men to attack Freckle under Kent\u2019s command.It was natural that many gathered at Kent\u2019s call.Freckle expanded his power while building grudges all over the place, so when the popular beggar Kent came with all the money and suggested fighting against Freckle together, they couldn\u2019t refuse the offer.Other than money and revenge, there was a realistic reason, because of which they couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201cMax, butter, buddy, milk, BITE!!\u201dOlddog, who had gone under Freckle appeared and shouted.The gentle dogs turned into wild beasts as soon as they heard their owner\u2019s command and ran to show their strength.Grrrrrrrrrrr! Rrrrrrrrrrrr!\u201cWait, wait a minute\u2026Argh! My legs! My legs!\u201d\u201cFu*k! My dick! My dick! Stop itttttttt! Get this off! Urggggggghhhh\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhhhh\u2026\u2026\u201dThe union beggars, who had been pushing forward, staggered for a moment at the advent of fierce dogs.They couldn\u2019t do anything in front of olddog, who had been a powerful beggar in District W for a long time.Soon, six beggars appeared from the inside, armed with shotguns, revolvers, and pistols.\u201cYou bastards! Did you think you could take us down with those toys!?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make you all fu*king dog meat!!\u201dSaying those words, they pulled the trigger with his hand\u2026 No, they tried to pull it.[Shadow Spike]A shadow stretched out and moved towards the gunman.The spikes that rose from the floor, pierced the bodies of beggars with guns at the same time.Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk! Puk!Oliver, wearing a hood on his face appeared from among the frightened beggars.As soon as Freckle\u2019s beggars saw Oliver using black magic, they were immediately terrified.The only one who had the courage was olddog\u201cGuys! Bite!\u201dHowever, it was only the owner who had the courage to face Oliver.The ferocious dogs were terrified as soon as they saw Oliver.Their condition was way worse than Freckle\u2019s subordinates, they folded their ears, curled their tails, and crouched down.Kiii Kiiiii\u201cHey, guys. What happened?\u201d\u201cThe dogs are also afraid of warlocks.\u201dQuarterstaff Kent came close to Olddog and spoke.\u201cHa, you\u2026.you brought a warlock, that too a real one.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re half right and half wrong.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll explain later, for now, go to sleep.\u201dKent swung the quarterstaff in his hand and knocked out Olddog.Oliver stared at it silently, but Kent said an excuse.\u201c\u2026because he was once Priest\u2019s friend.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dSomeone came out from among the beggars.He was a beggar from 25th street with a bald head, a bushy beard, and a large hammer.\u201cGood! Good!! It was really great!!! You actually brought the Warlock!\u2026 Kent!\u201dThe bald head with a sledgehammer in his hands looked into Oliver\u2019s eyes and said.\u201cIf there was someone like this, you should\u2019ve brought him out soon! That way we wouldn\u2019t have had a hard time.\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds.\u201d\u201cHaha! That\u2019s right. Come on, everyone! Let\u2019s clean the pest that has been spoiling our district!\u201d\u201cWoahhhhhhhhh!\u201dThe beggars led by Baldhammer, entered the den of Freckle.The beggars of Freckle gang who were guarding the sewer passage were immediately taken down, thanks to which Kent\u2019s gang of beggars directly flowed inside.And, Kent followed along with Oliver.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. I didn\u2019t believe Freckle would have made a base here when you said it.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dKent said while looking at the dry sewer wall.\u201cDo you remember the last time when I said Landa had a big disaster in the past.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026what is that disaster.\u201d\u201cWell, there are many hypotheses, such as divine punishment, demon summoning, failed magic experiments, etc. Until the wizards and capitalists came together to rebuild this city, it was a cursed ruin.\u201d\u201cYes, I know that.\u201d\u201cBut, it\u2019s not like it has been completely rebuilt. Contaminated creatures sometimes appear in places where there are few people, or in a place that had been abandoned for a long time. It was the same here once.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026once, then?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the problem\u2026 If Freckle has been using this place as his den, it must mean that there is a force behind him that was strong enough to clean up the contaminated creatures living\u2026.\u201d\u201cAaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dBefore Kent could finish speaking, a scream was heard right in front of him.More specifically, it was from the huge space at the end of the sewer passageway, and to everyone\u2019s shock, there was a monstrous creature that was many times bigger than a human.Hihihihihihihhihiihihihhhihihhihhi_____!]HihihhhaihihihihihihiA creepy and disgusting cry was heard.The appearance of the creature was like a hairless mouse.The height was between 2 to 3m.There were wrinkles all over its body, and it had reddish skin that made it look like it had a skin disease.Its orange front teeth were very long and horrifying, but not comparable to the open belly, the pus, and the maggots that flowed throughout its whole body.It was so monstrous that the huge iron nail that was struck on its head and the flask containing Life-force was relatively less noticeable.\u201cOh my God\u2026\u201dBaldhammer, who was leading the way, trembled in fear.In a way, it was a natural reaction after seeing the nameless and terrifying creature that was digging and eating the belly of a fellow beggar alive.SPLASH SPLASH SPLASH SPLASHThe flesh, intestines, and blood of the person who had been slaughtered flowed out through the open stomach.At that moment someone shouted.\u201cYou bastards\u2013 You dare to intrude into my kingdom?\u201dA man with a small baton in one hand and an eyeball necklace around his neck appeared with a group of similar monsters.People called him Freckle.The monstrous creature which was preying on the beggar wrinkled its hideous nose as if it was hungry and pushed its jaw towards Freckle, and at that moment.Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii_!!The monster shook its head in great pain when it tried to bite Freckle with its jaws.\u201cHey, you are controlling that monster\u2026\u2026 Aren\u2019t you?\u201dSomeone asked in surprise.Freckle replied in high spirits.\u201cYeah, you motherfu*kers. Did you think I would have trusted only those bi*ches who beg for money? It\u2019s better this way. I\u2019ll clean up everyone right now. Hey, since you guys are hungry?! Eat!\u201dAs soon as Freckle finished his words, dozens of contaminated creatures rushed in.The beggars shouted desperately as they ran around the way they came.\u201cWarlock! Yes! Call the Warlock!\u201d\u201cWarlock?! Hahaha-! I don\u2019t care what kind of guy you have brought! But he can\u2019t kill all of these guys with his clumsy firepower. He is no match for the guy behind me!\u201d[Vine Shadow]The contaminated creatures that had been running wild got tied by the shadow tentacles.Hiiiiiihihihihihiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!HiihhiihiihiiiihihihihihiiiiiThe monsters growled and groaned, but the more they struggled, the more the shadow tentacles that rose from the floor put pressure on the monsters.The monsters were so easily suppressed that not only the beggars who came along with Freckle, Freckle himself was dumbfounded by the sight he was seeing.They couldn\u2019t understand the situation in front of them.\u201cUm\u2026?\u201dWhile everyone was silent at the unbelievable scene, someone spoke up.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dOliver with a hood on his head stepped forward.He politely asked the beggars to move and went forward.The beggars froze and walked away as Oliver told them to, and Oliver thanked them each time.Oliver appeared in front of the mysterious creature, he then looked at the monster and asked.\u201cOh\u2026what is this?\u201dKent replied, feeling a little absurd and afraid.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a naked rat. A contaminated creature that lives in the abandoned sewers. It\u2019s only a low grade, but it\u2019s a dangerous creature that preys on people.\u201dOliver nodded and looked at the naked rat.He looked at it as if he didn\u2019t mind its bad smell or its hideous look.No, it was not like he didn\u2019t mind those things, it was just that his mind was somewhere else and was unaware of those things.\u201c\u2026interesting? It is designed to make it easy to control its movements like zombies and the control could be also passed on to someone who couldn\u2019t use magic. It was designed to be more stable and sustainable with hunger rather than anger or hatred. Impressive. \u201dOliver said while tapping the iron nail on the creature\u2019s head, and the flask that contained condensed Life-force tied to the iron nail.The naked rat that was suffering from starvation, pushed its big front teeth to bite Oliver who was observing him, but Oliver looked even that with great interest.\u201cThey\u2019re zombies and their stomachs were split so that their hunger for food never dies. An unfulfilled desire becomes their driving force. It was a simple but effective method. I think the person who thought about this is an excellent Warlock.\u201d\u201cHey, the word you should use is terrible, not excellent.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cWell, from our point of view\u2026 we feel sorry for those creatures, so, can you get rid of them? Everyone\u2019s scared.\u201dOliver stretched out his hand in the air while looking at the naked rats.Then, the Life-force of the naked rat zombies got extracted.\u201cIt was completely subdued, and yet it was a great creature. The person who created this didn\u2019t realize the true value of the creature, but\u2026!!\u201dOliver turned his head and looked towards Freckle.\u201cUm, Mr. Kent, I\u2019d like to ask him some questions, is it possible?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Nothing is impossible if it was Sir. Warlock\u2019s will, I\u2019ll half-kill him and bring him to you.\u201dKent spoke while pointing his quarterstaff at Freckle\u2019s neck.Soon, the heads of other unions stood next to Kent.Freckle, who they believed to be invincible, was subdued so easily which made them a little disappointed, but they did not lose courage.\u201cUgh-!\u201dAfter every beggar head finished venting out their anger by beating Freckle, Kent grabbed Freckle by the neck and asked.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have controlled the monster like that by yourself. Who the hell are you holding hands with? And what are you going to say if everyone finds out what you did?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 Why should I worry about what those losers think about?\u201d\u201cOnly answer the questions asked.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026 Okay, that\u2019s right, I handed over the overflowing garbage here, and with that money, I got those monsters.\u201dAt those words, Kent grabbed Freckle\u2019s neck.He was very angry, but nevertheless, Freckles murmured.\u201cCome to my side Kent! I\u2019ll recommend you to the person behind me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s join hands Kent\u2026 I feel sorry for you right now and that\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing. The warlock you brought doesn\u2019t seem like an ordinary one, but the person behind my back is an even greater person. So let\u2019s work together from this point.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of bullshit are you talking about.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bullshit. The person behind me is someone who can get rid of every one of us if he wants to. He\u2019s just supporting me because he hates being exposed. He is not a normal warlock!\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Excuse me, what kind of Warlock is he?\u201dOliver interrupted suddenly.The other beggar heads retreated not intervening with the warlock, who had shown an overwhelming performance.\u201cHaha\u2026 hahaha\u2026 He\u2019s someone who is about to join the Black Hand.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What\u2019s black hand?\u201dFreckle gave off a ridiculous look.\u201c\u2026 As a warlock you don\u2019t even know about the black hand? Stop lying.\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t know. Do you know what it is, Mr. Kent?\u201dKent, too, made a face similar to that of Freckle.\u201cUh\u2026 Simply put, it\u2019s a criminal organization that mainly consists of warlocks, and they are a huge pillar of the underworld. You really don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Is that a wrong thing?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that\u2026\u201dFreckle intervened.\u201cReally\u2026 Really Kent? He didn\u2019t even know what black hand was, and you have brought such a warlock to the support\u2026 If you dare to kill me, the warlock behind me will come and take revenge for me on every single one here.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201dOliver suddenly intervened.\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d\u201cThat was a lie. You don\u2019t even know if he\u2019ll get revenge if you die. You don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll do it or not.\u201d\u201c\u2026are you pretending that you saw through my emotions just because you have some skills?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t pretend, I really looked through\u2026 How can I meet him? The person who wants to join the Black Hand.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Haha, it seems like you got overconfident after overpowering me. You want to meet him?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHe comes only when he wants to. And he won\u2019t come just to meet anyone. When he shows up with his horrendous work\u2026 What\u2026 What are you doing?\u201dFreckle looked at Oliver who took off his necklace.Oliver stared at the necklace intensely.\u201cUm\u2026 As expected.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThis is not a normal necklace. It\u2019s the eye of the watchdog.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen it in books. It\u2019s made of human eyeballs so that you can see this place from afar.\u201dAfter the explanation, Oliver looked at the eyeball stuck in the middle of the necklace.The stuffed eyes didn\u2019t respond, but Oliver\u2019s eyes clearly felt something.A being that\u2019s spying on him from the outside through the eyeball.As Oliver\u2019s concentration gradually increased, the vision of an ordinary human disappeared, and the vision of the warlock became clear.When his concentration reached a certain level, Oliver could feel the presence of the person looking at him from the distance.It was the like the only white line connected in a black world.Perhaps, the other party also felt Oliver.Kent looked at Oliver with worried eyes and asked.\u201c\u2026are you all right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Yes. I\u2019m going to see this person for a while.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54\u201cThis is District X. Sir. Warlock.\u201dA beggar, who guided Oliver said, and Oliver looked around the streets that looked a bit similar than District W but looked much more dangerous.\u201cIs this the place\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, this is District X\u2026. I\u2019m sorry, but if it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll just\u2026\u201d\u201cUm, It\u2019s all right, you can go back now.\u201d\u201cAh, thank you. I wish you all the best. Sir. Warlock.\u201dThe beggar, who was trembling in fear, bowed his head to the point where his back was completely visible and went back the way he came.Originally, Kent was supposed to bring Oliver, but due to problems such as cleaning up, he had to stay there and guide everyone to do the post-processing.Oliver didn\u2019t care.No, rather, he felt more comfortable being alone.He was the first warlock Oliver was going to meet after leaving Wineham.If possible, he wanted to see him alone.If what he saw through the eye of the watchdog was right, there must be a warlock here, the one that backed Freckle.Oliver couldn\u2019t explain it in detail, but he could feel it.The presence of the person he saw through the eyeball.\u201cThe question is, where exactly is he\u2026\u201dThe approximate location was identified, but the specific location was not.But that wasn\u2019t a big deal, Oliver focused his powers on his eyes.Before long, he could feel a lot of emotions from everywhere.From among the emotions he felt, there was someone who approached Oliver with ulterior motives.Oliver understood that the person who came was the one he was searching for and asked.\u201cIs there any reason for you wanting to see me?\u201dSomeone came out through the dimmed streetlights.\u201cYou have noticed it.\u201dThe one who popped out of the darkness was a woman, a beautiful one in a very fancy dress.\u201cUm\u2026\u201dIf Oliver were to paraphrase her appearance, he would compare her to a doll.High-heeled leather shoes, a puffy skirt full of lace, while her chest was half revealed, her waist was tight.A ribbon was tied around her neck, and a colorful feathered hat was worn on top of her head,Her skin was as white as paint, and her lips were as red as fire.It was the first time Oliver saw someone like this.While Oliver was looking at the woman, the woman spoke.\u201cAre you the warlock brought by the beggars?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026yes, my name is Oliver.\u201d\u201cOliver\u2026.. My great master, Puppeteer Glyph, has seen you fight. Surprisingly, he even showed interest in you. He wants to see you. Think of this as your honor.\u201dHer arrogant attitude reminded Oliver of a theater actor.However, Oliver didn\u2019t mind, because he wanted to see him too.When Oliver nodded, she went back the way she had come and started to guide the way.Only the sound of footsteps echoed quietly, but Oliver looked around without saying a word.Landa\u2019s District X.The place where Oliver\u2019s master, Joseph once lived. This was his third visit to this place.As Kent said, unlike District V and W, which were the den of beggars, District X seemed like a den for criminals and fugitives.To be precise, it was like a border between Y and Z where real monsters live.In any case, it was true that it was very dangerous compared to District W.As if to prove this, Oliver could feel the presence surrounding him.The woman who was walking with a loud noise came to a sudden halt.\u201cOh, Mr. Oliver, My great master told me to test you once more. He doesn\u2019t deal with inferior beings.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 then?\u201d\u201cFirst, prove your worth.\u201dThe woman snapped her fingers like an actress, and at the signal, zombies who were hiding between the alleys came out.RUMBLE! RUMBLE!Each of the zombies had a sword and an awl.As Oliver concentrated his energy on the eyes, he figured out that the number of zombies was around fifty.It reminded him of the fight he had with Joseph in the past, where Oliver used Vine Shadow to catch zombies and then sliced them up like cheese.That was back then.[Hate Bullet][Hate Bullet]The bullet of hate crashed into the air and disappeared.The woman holding a test tube covered her mouth with her hand and laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. The basics are okay\u2026.to be able to use basic firearms-based black magic even though you are a master at manipulation magic.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dOliver tilted his head.He wondered if he was a master at using manipulation-type black magic.\u201cI saw through the necklace of Freckle. Your specialty is manipulation. Probably mastered the shadow-based skills to the core. If you\u2019re that skilled\u2026 Who\u2019s your Master?\u201cWell, can you answer my question if I answered yours?\u201d\u201cHo-ho\u2026 that\u2019s interesting. You\u2019re going to ask me a question. All right. I\u2019ll answer it.\u201d\u201cUm, thank you. The name of my Master is Joseph?\u201d\u201cJoseph\u2026 I have never heard of that name before. Maybe he was a third-rate warlock.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Since I answered your question, may I ask you a question this time?\u201d\u201cSure, let me guess? You were going to ask why my Great Master is interested in you, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026? No. I want to know why you\u2019re controlling a corpse and pretending to be a woman. Is it much easier to control this way? Is this some kind of a trick?\u201dWoman\u2026 No, the female zombie\u2019s expression got distorted mercilessly.\u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s great. I\u2019ve seen stories in books about being able to control a corpse like a living person beyond just a zombie, but it was my first time actually seeing one in person. Does imitating the characteristic of the target make it much easier to control the body?\u201c\u2026 Shut up.\u201dHer (his) emotions fluctuated in displeasure, shame, and anger as if Oliver had touched something that he shouldn\u2019t have touched.\u201cI tried to test you in moderation because you had a great talent, but you dare mock me?\u201d\u201cWhat? No, that\u2019s wrong, I think it\u2019s really amazing\u2014\u201d\u201cShut up! Hate Bullet!\u201dThe woman extracted emotions and attacked.Oliver equally shot the bullets of hatred and met the incoming bullets.PHUT!PHA BANGBANG\u2014\u2014!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!Bullets of hate exploded in the air like firecrackers.The shock caused Oliver\u2019s hair to flutter, but Oliver didn\u2019t mind and looked at the woman in front of him.What she did was really mysterious.Even if he can make her look similar to a living person through processing, Oliver didn\u2019t know how he made her use black magic.\u2018Can manipulation-type magicians use black magic through the corpse?\u2019\u201cUm\u2026 no, they can\u2019t. That\u2019s right.\u201dThere is only one conclusion that can be drawn.\u201cThat corpse, was it a warlock?\u201d\u201c\u2026you! How?!\u201d\u201cI saw it in a book. Lich\u2026 It is similar to that but also different. Calling it a Doll seems more appropriate. Vine Shadow.\u201dShadow tentacles wrapped around the woman\u2019s arm.Oliver tied her up like the Naked rat and closely observed her.\u201cHa-! Stupid!\u201dAs soon as her arm was caught, the woman cut off her own arm.It fell like a lizard\u2019s tail.Her arm fell, and soon, a blade similar to that of a praying mantis came out of her hand.And then she came running at a very high speed, and when looked underneath her puffy skirt, there were several spider legs.\u201cI\u2019ll cut off your limbs and take you away!\u201d\u201cMinion.\u201dAt those words, the minion in Oliver\u2019s arms jumped out and shot [thrust] at the woman who came running.It was a black magic that destroys and pushes the target by firing a shock wave.\u201cUghhhh!\u201dContrary to her appearance, the doll was a lot stronger than Oliver expected and was simply pushed back, but for Oliver, that was enough.[Targeting] x 9[Hate Bullet] x 9Nine bullets of hate pierced into the body, four bullets pierced the lower body, two bullets in each shoulder and chest, and one bullet went straight into the mouth.Wherever the bullets of hatred hit, the embalmed skin, flesh, tendons, and bones got scattered all over the floor.She was so damaged that she couldn\u2019t even move anymore, and Oliver closely looked at the Doll in its current state.\u201cUm\u2026 I knew it was being remodeled, but seeing it this way, it looks different. The legs are replaced with spider legs to increase its mobility, the arms and chest have a knife and an awl, and guns in its mouth\u2026 That\u2019s not a common skill. The name Puppeteer really suits him.\u201dWhen Oliver identified the specifications of the opponent so naturally, her only intact eyes moved.She looked aghast.Oliver wondered why the puppeteer didn\u2019t reveal himself and instead why he came posing as his own disciple.Is it because he thinks that his workmanship is poor? Or is it because it wasn\u2019t good enough?Oliver couldn\u2019t understand.Oliver decided to see it for himself.Oliver looked into the doll\u2019s eye and focused his attention on it, as he did with Freckle.The corpse doll tried to close her eye, but Oliver forced it to open her eye and looked into its eye.This time Oliver was able to locate the location of the puppeteer faster than before.It was a warehouse building at the end of the alley he was in.Surprisingly, he was very close.As soon as he finished his business, Oliver pulled out all the Life-force of the corpse doll and put it in the test tube that he had used earlier.Then he headed straight towards the place where the Puppeteer was.Although he was a little farther away, Oliver looked quite nervous.Why?It was because Oliver wanted to ask about his amazing skills as soon as possible.The Puppeteer\u2019s handling of corpses, such as Naked rat and Doll, was excellent.Oliver wanted to know how he could join a machine and a body like that.Oliver wanted to ask how he came up with this idea and how he learned it.Oliver also wanted to be taught if possible.But it seemed like the other person didn\u2019t think the same way.\u201cUhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u201dWhen Oliver reached the end of the alley and was in front of the warehouse, a drug-enhanced muscular giant appeared by breaking the wall.It had a nail in its head and a rotten body.He was also the Puppeteer\u2019s corpse doll.Unlike the women, there was no embalming treatment, and he soon found out why.[Burning Life][Muscle Up]Another corpse doll appeared and casted black magic on the muscular one.Upon receiving the power of vitality and anger, the rotten muscles swelled even more.It seemed like Puppeteer Glyph could handle multiple corpse dolls with precision.There were also animals.GRRRR\u2014\u2014!URRRRRRR\u2014\u2013!Two dead dogs, with six legs and steel teeth, came running at an incredible speed and attacked both sides of Oliver at the same time.It was so fast that it was difficult to hit it even with the Hate Bullet.The Warlock\u2019s corpse Doll even supported it with a ranged attack.Attacks came from all directions.[Black Marvel]PABANG\u2014\u2014\u2014!Tang!Cyaruk!Tang!Creuk!The shield of sphere that rolled around his body saved Oliver from danger.If he had moved a little late, the dogs would have bitten his legs, or he would have been attacked from a distance.But it was still too early to be relieved.\u201cUhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dAs expected, the muscular corpse doll swung a hammer at Oliver, whose mobility was sealed due to the defense magic.When black magic was added to its original strength, it became so powerful that the thin Black Marble ended up getting crushed at once.\u201cUHHHHHHHHH!\u201dTUNGCREEEK!TUNGCREEEK\u2013!Oliver looked around as the shield kept cracking.The muscular corpse doll pushed straight in from the front.The Puppeteer\u2019s corpse Doll that was in charge of support, and the Hunting Dog\u2019s corpse Doll hovers around as if looking for a chance to attack.Although they were inferior to the previous female corpse doll, they showed much superior fighting power just by focusing on only one particular characteristic.It seemed like the Puppeteer was used to this kind of battle, and it was no coincidence that Oliver was on the defensive.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dAfter organizing his thoughts, Oliver took out the Life-force he had extracted earlier and drank it.He then cast black magic on his body.[Burning Life]It was a black magic that burns life force to increase overall physical ability.Probably, there would be no problem if it only burns the life force that he had drunk.Oliver released the shield and faced the muscular corpse doll head-on.It would have been difficult in normal times, but with the help of black magic, Oliver narrowly avoided the doll\u2019s attack.BAM\u2014!The hammer passed in front of his head and his hair fluttered at the wind pressure.The corpse dog hovered around while chasing after him, but Oliver didn\u2019t care and ran towards the muscular corpse doll.[Hate Bullet]\u00d720Twenty bullets of hate shot at close range and struck the muscular corpse Doll.Of course, the corpse Doll also tried to defend, but it was no match in front of Oliver\u2019s firepower.They were thoroughly destroyed, and Oliver immediately turned around and cast a black spell at the hound that came close to biting him.[Obedience]Basic black magic that allows one to control the resurrected corpse.Oliver tried to plant his control over the body that was already in someone else\u2019s control.CRACKLE\u2026!SCREEEEE\u2026!To Oliver\u2019s surprise, the dog shook its head in agony.According to the book, it was said that to control a corpse one must have superior skills than the opponent.Oliver was able to see the emotions of the terrified warlock out there through the muscular corpse doll.[Las Bullet][Hate Bullet] x 6Oliver fired a few bullets at the support corpse doll which stopped moving in confusion.All the corpse dolls got shattered to pieces, while the dogs were only broken to the point where they stopped functioning.But Oliver didn\u2019t stop there.He went into the building to meet Puppeteer Glyph.He opened the door and said.\u201cHello?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can

    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55The blue moonlight shone through the opened door, revealing the inside of the warehouse.There was a dead body hanging from the ceiling and an operating table on one side.Surgical tools were placed next to it.Rather than a warehouse, it was a sight that seemed suitable for a kind of laboratory and workroom.All Oliver could hear in the room was the sound of rough breathing.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026who the hell are you?\u201dOliver looked at him.A man surrounded by zombies which were sewed here and there like a rag.Oliver instinctively noticed that the man was Puppeteer Glyph and greeted him politely.\u201cHello?\u201dOliver wondered whether the way of greeting was wrong, as the Puppeteer looked at Oliver with a sense of alienation and confusion.Oliver also observed him, and he could understand why he was talking through the doll.He was fat enough to be deformed, almost to the point where he could not help but fall off like bread dough.It was definitely a body shape that was not suitable for a dangerous battlefield.Skinny Oliver was also similar to him in some ways.Oliver stood still and looked at him until the Puppeteer opened his mouth first, and fortunately, he opened.\u201cYou\u2026 you, what the hell are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Oliver. Didn\u2019t I say it to you earlier\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026Who\u2019s your Master?\u201d\u201cHuh? Didn\u2019t I tell you earlier?\u201d\u201cDo not lie!\u201dPuppeteer shouted to the point where his drooping cheeks shook.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anyone named Joseph in Landa. I can tell you\u2019re only a few years old, but my doll\u2026 Who is it, your Master?!\u201dOliver was silent.He told the truth, but the other person did not believe him, so he did not know how to persuade him.However, as if the silence itself worked, Puppeteer Glyph murmured in confusion.\u201cHey, You\u2026 What you said is not a lie?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. He was a native of Landa but he moved out. I just came here.\u201dGlyph sweated as he gave strength to his eyes.He was probably trying to read Oliver\u2019s emotions, and Oliver knew it because he had done it too often.\u201cYou, what are you?\u201dGlyph looked intently at Oliver, stumbling backward as he asked.Oliver seemed to understand what he was talking about.\u201cAh, my Master said that I have a very weak emotion. So\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dOliver asked, but the puppeteer did not answer.The Puppeteer\u2019s emotions were clouded with confusion, fear, and terror.It was as if he saw something unbelievable for a moment.Amid the chaos, the Puppeteer managed to calm himself as the fear and terror got overshadowed by courage and cunning.\u201c\u2026why? are you against me?\u201dPuppeteer Glyph asked, not to observe Oliver\u2019s reaction, rather he was genuinely curious.Oliver answered as it was because he was also curious about something.\u201cUm, somehow it ended up like that. Can I ask you a question?\u201c\u2026 Tell me.\u201d\u201cThe first doll that I saw on the way here, how did you make it?\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the corpse doll?\u201d\u201cYes. That was amazing. From the outside, it really looked like a living person.\u201dHe complimented him wholeheartedly, but Puppeteer Glyph was rather horrified, let alone delighted.He felt like he was in front of a wild beast.Oddly enough, there was a willingness to seize the opportunity between such tension and fear.Puppeteer wondered what Oliver wanted.\u201c\u2026 I learned it from my Master.\u201dThe Puppeteer was saying the truth.\u201cDid you learn it?\u201d\u201cYes, from my great Master, whom the world calls Puppet.\u201dPuppeteer Glyph seemed to be expecting some kind of reaction, but Oliver\u2019s reaction was very bland.\u201cPuppet\u2026? Puppet? That\u2019s a unique name.\u201dPuppeteer Glyph\u2019s emotions shone with bewilderment and absurdity.\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t you know who Puppet is?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026do I need to know?\u201d\u201cOf course. Of course, if you are a warlock then you should know about him! He is a legend in the world of black magic, a person who lived for hundreds of years.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. It hasn\u2019t been that long since I learned black magic. So, I don\u2019t know much about the world of black magic. My Master\u2026 he couldn\u2019t teach me properly because of his work.\u201d\u201cHow long has it been since you started learning black magic?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 how many months?\u201dOliver counted the number of months using his finger to answer his question.He couldn\u2019t remember the date when he was sold to Joseph, so he could only guess.But Puppeteer Glyph did not seem to be satisfied with Oliver\u2019s answer.\u201cLie\u2026don\u2019t lie! No matter how much of a genius you are, the corpse doll that consolidates all the knowledge I\u2019ve acquired throughout my life\u2026 is not something that a person who learned black magic for only a few months could defeat!\u201dHe was genuinely angry and denied accepting the reality.However, that was the truth.\u201cAre you\u2026 a contractor?\u201dContractor.It was a word Oliver knew.A being who gained power through a contract with a Demon.According to what he saw in Joseph\u2019s study, it was said that the Contractor could gain talent and strength that exceeds far beyond a lifetime of one\u2019s hard work.By analogy, it was like an evolution that transcends species.Although they had to bear the consequent price, many Warlocks fall into temptation because the fruit was so sweet.That was why warlocks were rejected.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but no.\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cYes, I want to see a Demon, but I\u2019m not a Contractor.\u201dGULP.Puppeteer Glyph glanced at the opportunity and swallowed his saliva.He made up his mind on something and asked Oliver.\u201c\u2026 Do you want to be a contractor?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m not interested in being a Contractor, but I do want to meet a Demon. I have some questions to ask.\u201dOliver answered, remembering the \u2018Oldman on horseback\u2019 who greeted him.He wanted to know why he bowed to him.And why did it feel so familiar?Oliver wanted to know.\u201c\u2026 You want to ask Demon something?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you interested in my\u2026 corpse doll?\u201dOliver looked back and answered.\u201cYes\u2026it\u2019s interesting.\u201d\u201cYou must have a lot of questions, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cHow did you know? I have so many questions.\u201dSuddenly, Puppeteer Glyph\u2019s expression had a faint smile.It was as if he had picked up a lump of golden nugget.\u201c\u2026 Then I\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201cWill you?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll help you. To satisfy your curiosity. From what I can see, you have great skills, but you lack common sense\u2026 How about it? If you help me, I\u2019ll help you.\u201dOliver looked at Puppeteer Glyph.He was telling the truth.Although there were hidden intentions in it, he was sincere about helping him.\u201cUm\u2026 is it something to do with the organization Black hand?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 did that fu*ker Freckle tell you?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I heard it\u2019s an organization made up of powerful warlocks, right?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s a lot bigger than that, but it\u2019s roughly right. It\u2019s a powerful organization in charge of an axis in the afterlife. An organization that belongs to living Warlock legends. Here, they deal with a lot of resources and forbidden knowledge. If you were to become a part of such an organization\u2026\u201d\u201cDoes Mr. Puppet, the Master of Mr. Glyph, also belong to this organization?\u201d\u201cYeah! Now you understand the power of Black Hand, right!? But when referring to Master, call him \u2018Sir. Puppet\u2019.\u201d\u201cUm, okay\u2026 But there\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhy are you trying hard to join the organization when your master belongs to it?\u201dAt that moment, the emotions of Puppeteer Glyph shook.He felt like he was stabbed in a sore spot, he flustered\u201cWell, that\u2019s because of my master\u2019s teaching \u2026 Yeah, because of his teaching. I need to prove my worth. Like a test!\u201dIt was a Lie.Oliver saw through the inside of Puppeteer Glyph.But it didn\u2019t bother him much.It didn\u2019t seem like there was anything special about it, so he asked for something else instead.\u201cBlack Hand seems like a great place.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen, it won\u2019t be easy to join, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026What the hell are you trying to say?\u201cUm, nothing special, does asking Freckle for beggars has anything to do with joining the Black Hand, like the people down here?\u201dOliver said while pointing to the warehouse basement.Underneath the warehouse, there were many emotions filled with fear.At that question, Puppeteer Glyph\u2019s expression darkened.\u201cYeah, what about it?\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me that a Warlock like you cares about such things?\u201dOliver thought about whether he cared about it.He rubbed his forehead and thought.He thought about why he left Wineham.He forgot about his purpose for a while, when he was wondering about Kent.\u2018Why did I leave Wineham?\u2019It was nothing other than to quench his curiosity.To quench his curiosity about beautiful emotions, black magic, and demons.Because he thought it would be difficult to find an answer to those questions while running an organization.\u201cNope\u2026\u201dOliver murmured.Obviously, that was his main reason, but there was a separate reason that became a small spark and made him leave.It was a small passing word, however, those words were decisive in making Oliver leave Wineham.At that moment, a woman\u2019s voice echoed in his ears.-Don\u2019t stay in this darkness, come out into the world. Meet a lot of people out there and learn to live like a normal person.\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201dOliver let out a sigh as if it had scratched the itchy spot accurately.And in that process, he met Kent.He helped Oliver without any ulterior motives.Just because he felt pity for him, he helped him without any ulterior motive.Oliver had never received such help in the past.Besides that, he protected the beggars and even him at the risk of his life.Although his emotions were not without temptation or frustration, he nevertheless carried out his will till the end.His emotions weren\u2019t as dazzling as the beautiful emotions, but nonetheless, that soft light\u2026 was very\u2026\u201cAnswer my question!\u201dOliver came to his senses at the sudden loud noise.Puppeteer Glyph in front of him had an angry expression on his face.\u201cAnswer my question\u2026.does a Warlock need to care about those little scums?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026a little?\u201d\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d\u201cHow should I say\u2026 I can\u2019t express it well, but it\u2019s amazing. To endure something and keep your will\u2026 It\u2019s pretty.\u201d\u201cPretty?\u201d\u201cYeah, if you were a warlock, you should know about those emotions\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\u201c\u2026I will tell you once again. If you cooperate, I will help you get the knowledge you want. If you join Black Hand, you can get knowledge and teaching from the organization, and you can also use the black market by using the personal connections you made there.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026Black Hand\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but to do that, do I have to hand over the beggars, like Freckle?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll let you join, in return for giving up on them. You can get tremendous power and knowledge by giving me the beggars on the street.\u201dOliver was lost in agony.Demons, black magic, beautiful emotions.There were so many things he wanted to know, and Oliver didn\u2019t know how to get them.And, the man in front of him was speaking the truth.He could help Oliver.With that help, Oliver could gain the knowledge he wanted.The first step was to turn in the beggars.It was a very cheap price. It was undeniable that they were huge in numbers, and they had no power, and Oliver could get away with it if he wanted to.But Oliver didn\u2019t like it.\u201cThat\u2019s a bit too much.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit\u2026 Well, I definitely want knowledge, but I don\u2019t think I can do that.\u201d\u201cDo you know how stupid you are right now?\u201d\u201cYes. Still, I can\u2019t help it. I got some help, and I don\u2019t hate them.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re missing out on this great opportunity for an insignificant reason? It\u2019s the Black Hand\u2026the chance every warlock dreams of!\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t help it. I guess I\u2019ve to reject the offer.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201d I got to meet you because of that insignificant reason, isn\u2019t that itself feel interesting? Coming out into the world, meeting different people, hanging out with them\u2026 It\u2019s pretty interesting.\u201d\u201cReally? Then, go die with them!\u201dFilled with rage, Puppeteer Glyph ordered the remaining zombies to attack Oliver.Oliver targeted the zombies\u2019 heads and then fired\u00a0 Hate Bullets.Unlike the previous corpse dolls, the zombies were just helplessly destroyed because the Puppeteer didn\u2019t add any special features.[Meat Shield][Bone Sphere]Puppeteer Glyph created a shield from broken zombies, and created spears made of bones.However, when Oliver shot a hate bullet, his counterattack was thoroughly shattered to the point of being meaningless.\u201c\u2026Kuck!\u201dThe bullet went through the shield and hit him in the stomach.Puppeteer Glyph fell down, he said hastily looking at Oliver.\u201cUghhhhhh, I understand\u2026! I give up\u2026I\u2019ll leave like this. I won\u2019t do anything to those beggars\u2026\u201dOliver came closer and said,\u201cI know it\u2019s a lie.\u201d\u201cFu*k\u2026if I die, that person\u2026 My master\u2026 The great Puppet will come and avenge\u2026.\u201cI know that\u2019s a lie too, you aren\u2019t sure?\u201dPuppeteer Glyph\u2019s expression distorted in shock.He was full of shame as if he had been stripped off by the person in front of him.Oliver approached him and knelt down on one knee and asked politely.\u201cI know it\u2019s a lie that your master, Sir. Puppet gave you a test. Why did you lie?\u201dPuppeteer Glyph\u2019s expression got distorted to the point that it could not be distorted anymore.His final emotions were only fear, shame, and despair.As he gasped and died, he was filled with fear and shame.Oliver groaned as he looked at his corpse.He thought maybe he could see the beautiful light again.For some reason, fear played a bigger role than will at the last minute.He felt a little bit of regret.Oliver then concentrated his energy on his eyes.Then he saw the secret passage device that he had seen in Joseph\u2019s factory in the past.Oliver approached the place and touched the wall with the emotions in his hand.The black light slowly moved a few times, and then the secret passage opened.As he made his way down the stairs, he saw a bed and a table, some books, a safe, dark magic tools, and a group of people who were locked in the iron cage.Oliver looked at them and asked.\u201cDo you need any help?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56When Oliver returned, the Beggars Union was in the midst of a party.Dozens of beggars fought over small clothes, watches, and valuables.However, that too only for a moment. As soon as Oliver appeared, the commotion subsided as if it had never happened, and everyone shut their mouths and bowed their heads.\u201cAh\u2026 Sir. Warlock.\u201dSome beggars took off their hats and opened the way to show their respects.Oliver bowed slightly and went forward.When he reached the end of the passage, he could see Kent and other beggars union heads.They seemed to have found Freckle\u2019s secret safe and were sharing quite a few bundles of money.\u201cAll right. Everyone is okay, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201d\u201cWell then\u2026 Huh? Sir Warlock!\u201dWhether it was the sloppy-looking one or the small and cunning-looking one, or the good-looking one, everyone got up and greeted Oliver.Everyone trembled in fear looking at Oliver.Even with headcount and weapons, they were pushed back by Freckle, and it was only thanks to Oliver\u2019s existence that they were able to win this war overwhelmingly.If Oliver had not been there, they would have been hit by olddog and gunmen at the entrance to the den, and they would have been badly injured.Then, the next day, they would have been counterattacked by Freckle, and everything would have been over.Thanks to Oliver, they were able to make it through without much damage.Kent stood up from his seat and said.\u201cHave you dealt with the warlock who supported Freckle?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOliver nodded and showed the gluttonous pouch that he had taken from the Warlock as evidence.It was a black magic item made with teeth, and emotions of greed.Everyone nodded their heads in relief after seeing the evidence.Meanwhile, Kent looked behind Oliver and asked.\u201cGreat job. But\u2026 what\u2019s with the people behind you\u2026?\u201dOliver looked back.\u201cUm\u2026these are the people captured by the Warlock.\u201d\u201cCaptured?\u201d\u201cYes, they said they were sold to him from somewhere.\u201d\u201cI see, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Sir. Warlock! You took down the warlock who was behind Freckle\u2026 Oh! Here you go.\u201dSomeone interrupted.It was Pigibib, head of beggars from 2nd street of District W.He gestured cheerfully to the stack of money stacked to one side.\u201cIt\u2019s Sir Warlock\u2019s share.\u201dHis share\u2026For a moment, Oliver didn\u2019t understand the meaning behind his words.In the first place, he helped only because Kent asked for it, so he didn\u2019t understand why he was giving him money.However, Oliver did not refuse the money. Because he indeed needed some money.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cNo, no, we should be thanking you\u2026 And, there is something I want to ask Sir. Warlock\u2026?\u201dPigibib immediately brought up his real intention.\u201cWe have a pimp who fights with us over a gang issue. If it\u2019s okay with you, can you show your face? Sir Warlock\u2019s appearance alone is just enough \u2026\u201dOliver, who was not interested, answered with silence.Then, the quick-witted Pigibib hurriedly shut his mouth.Everyone was very nervous about Oliver\u2019s strangely changed attitude.\u201cExcuse me, if you don\u2019t mind, can I talk with Mr. Kent?\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh, yeah! Yeah! Hey, hey. Let\u2019s all go outside.\u201dAll the nervous beggar heads nodded and happily left.Thanks to this, only Oliver and Kent were present in the room.\u201cMr. Kent.\u201d\u201cYeah, what?\u201d\u201cCan you take these guys in?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThese people were captured by the Warlock, and they said they had nowhere to go. Is it okay for you to take them into your beggars union?\u201dKent\u2019s expression darkened slightly.Including women and children, there were almost 20 people.It was quite a big number.It will be a burden even if there was the money taken after knocking down Freckle.\u201cHa\u2026 May I ask why you brought them here?\u201d\u201cThey were locked up in an iron cage, and I thought they would starve to death if I left them there. I heard that the Warlock was trying to hand them over to Black Hand\u2026 If there was anyone who might help them, I thought it would be Mr. Kent. Or do you want me to send them back?Kent felt anguish at Oliver\u2019s remarks and tightly closed his eyes.\u201cUgh, well.., it\u2019ll work out somehow. I\u2019ll take them in.\u201dUpon hearing the answer, the beggars who had followed Oliver sighed in relief.If they were rejected by Kent, they would have been driven to the streets and starved to death.Oliver asked them to go out and wait for a while, then called out Kent again.\u201cMr. Kent.\u201d\u201cAll right, do you still have anything to ask?\u201d\u201cYes, I have a question. Can you spare me a moment?\u201d\u201cSure\u2026tell me.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dOliver took off his hood and thanked him.Knowing it was something unusual, Kent asked nervously.\u201cOkay, what do you want to say?\u201d\u201cCould you tell me what you know about the organization Black Hand?\u201d\u201cBlack Hand?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m suddenly curious. I wanted to know a little more about them.\u201d\u201c\u2026 As I said before, it\u2019s an organization from the underworld, dominated by warlocks. It forms one of the pillars of power.\u201d\u201cYeah, I remember that. I heard that it\u2019s an organization with a lot of forbidden knowledge, and I\u2019ve also heard that it\u2019s the dream place of every warlock\u2026 Do you know any more details?\u201dKent couldn\u2019t understand the reason behind Oliver\u2019s question. However, unlike before, there was a sense of pressure.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know the details. I\u2019ve only heard a few rumors about them. Is that okay?\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201d\u201c\u2026as far as I know, they are a group of powerful warlocks. And half of what I heard was like legends talked on the streets.\u201d\u201cLegends?\u201d\u201cYes. People who make Pilgaret, life-saving elixirs, people who are mercenaries, people who run illegal operations, sponsor a criminal syndicate, and worship the Demons. They are active in a wide range of fields, but their true nature has never been revealed. Still, everyone is afraid of them.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a rumor, but it\u2019s said that the Black Hand has a lot of high-risk criminals as members.\u201d\u201cHigh-risk criminals?\u201d\u201cThe worst criminals in the world that are defined as evil. Those guys are pure evil, there are no other words to describe them. They can be killed without any trial and has huge bounties on them. Many think of them as the enemies of the world.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Do you know anyone?\u201d\u201cImmortal Puppet, Kidnapper Pied Piper, Eternal-child Fuan, Human Meat Chef\u2026 By the way, they are like legendary beings in the underworld.\u201d\u201cUm, I see.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but can I ask why you\u2019re interested in that? It\u2019s a little scary.\u201d\u201cAh, sorry\u2026it\u2019s nothing, The Warlock who was behind Freckle gave me a proposal.\u201d\u201cWhat proposal?\u201d\u201cHe asked me to join hands with him and join the Black Hand. If I did that, he said he will give me what I want.\u201dKent\u2019s expression remained calm, but not his heart. He was confused and scared inwardly at the same time.\u201c\u2026 your answer?\u201d\u201cI declined.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for asking such a rude question.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s okay. I was actually going to accept it. I am someone who has a lot of questions, so I thought it would be easy for me to get answers if I were to enter the organization. They seemed to have a lot of knowledge, and they would also let me have access to the black market.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Then why did you refuse?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s kind of like an organization, and I don\u2019t like being a part of an organization\u2026.. And,\u00a0 can you tell me more about the black market?\u201dKent answered amicably this time as well.\u201cBlack Market\u2026. It\u2019s a semi-legendary organization similar to the Black Hand.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201cAt least to me, it\u2019s a place where you can get everything including books, drugs, animals, plants, magic stones, information, people, manpower, etc. that you can\u2019t find anywhere else.\u201d\u201cHow can I get access to that place?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s not available to the public. Even if you try to find it, you wouldn\u2019t be able to find even its shadow, and in the worst case scenario you might even end up dead.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026really? I don\u2019t like dying. Do you know any ways to get access to it without dying?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not sure, but I do know a way to get into it.\u201d\u201cOh, can you tell me what it is?\u201d\u201cBefore that, tell me why you want to use the black market.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 there is something that I want to know?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about black magic and demons. And about the beautiful emotions.\u201d\u201cBeautiful emotion?\u201dKent\u2019s emotion fluctuated again with the light of confusion.He felt fear creeping up on him, but he still tried to keep up his composure with great effort. He tried to find Oliver\u2019s true objective as much as possible.\u201cHa\u2026 You are a warlock, so it\u2019s understandable for you to be interested in black magic, but why are you interested in the demons? Do you know what a demon is?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s a being who trades with a warlock?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 but it also asks for more in return. It asks to do things that threaten the human world, it demands sacrifices, it incites crimes, and even worse, it orders you to summon them.\u201d\u201cOh, I see. But why do demons threaten the human world?\u201d\u201c\u2026? Because that\u2019s what the demons do. A being who is against God and hates humans.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is that so? Did they do that just because they are demons\u201d\u201cShould there be more?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I just don\u2019t understand. Because they are demons, they threaten the human world. How could that be a reason?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like rain falling from the sky and fire burning everything. What else do you need?\u201d\u201cI want to know the reason behind that, so I want to use the black market.\u201d\u201c\u2026why do you want to know that?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m curious? So I want to know.\u201dKent looked at Oliver with a blank expression.He looked similar to the others. He doesn\u2019t understand Oliver and sees him as someone alien.However, his curiosity was greater than disgust or fear.\u201c\u2026can I ask you one more question?\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201d\u201cIt has been long since I retired as Solver, but I haven\u2019t seen a Warlock as good as you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not just saying this to appease you, it\u2019s the truth\u2026 Why did you follow me? No, why didn\u2019t you fight the people who were arguing with you? You could have ended their lives in an instant\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I particularly don\u2019t like killing people. I would kill if I needed to, but I\u2019m really not interested in killing\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Then why did you follow me?\u201d\u201cI was curious. You helped me for no reason\u2026 I wanted to know the reason, so I followed you. Even though it\u2019s not perfect, I\u2019ve solved it to some extent.\u201d\u201c\u2026you\u2019re really weird.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Well, that person also said that I\u2019m broken.\u201d\u201cThat person?\u201d\u201cJoanna, the one I met in the past. She said she\u2019d help me, but somehow I turned her down. She said that I was broken. She told me to meet people and get along, that\u2019s why I came here.\u201dWhen Oliver said that, to his surprise, a sense of guilt rose from Kent\u2019s emotions. Oliver didn\u2019t know why.\u201c\u2026I apologize. I got your help and I have mistaken you.\u201d\u201cYes? What\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not weird. I don\u2019t think you are broken. It\u2019s just you\u2019re different .\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t care about being called weird or broken.\u201d\u201cI care\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s all right.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 The answer to your previous question is,\u00a0 you have to become a solver.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cTo use the black market, you have to be a solver, a great solver.\u201d\u201cWhy a great solver?\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to be a Solver in the back alley, but a Solver whom the capitalists, factory owners, politicians, and the heads of crime syndicates seek for. Those people try to find a great Solver. Then, you can use your personal connections and reputations to gain access to the black market, but I\u2019m not certain about that because I didn\u2019t get to that level.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 that\u2019s enough. So, how should I become a Solver?\u201d\u201cLet me introduce you to a broker. The place where I used to work, and it won\u2019t be a bad start. And that person is a good guy.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d\u201cBut there are conditions.\u201d\u201cConditions?\u201d\u201cYeah, get some knowledge from me for a few weeks.\u201d\u201cKnowledge?\u201d\u201cIf you are going to step into the world, you need to know at least some common sense. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re likely to be used or betrayed and end up dead. I know your skills are the real deal, but\u2026 the world is a place where you can\u2019t be safe just because you are skilled enough. I will teach you everything I can\u2026 including the quarterstaff. The more tricks you possess the better it would be for your survival. What do you think?\u201dOliver thought for a moment. It didn\u2019t sound like a bad idea. He thought it wouldn\u2019t be bad to learn how to use quarterstaff, considering that he had a hard time in the physical battle with Puppeteer Glyph\u2019s corpse dolls for a while.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Yes, I\u2019ll be in your care. Thank you.\u201d\u201cNo, I should be the one thanking you. You took care of Freckle and the warlock.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Then, can you teach me right away?\u201d\u201cCan you wait a minute? I want to help you right away, but I have a lot to do. I have to think about the kind of treatment I should give to the people you bought.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. Mr. Kent.\u201dOliver called Kent and handed him a glutinous bag.\u201cHuh? What is this?\u201d\u201cIt was the money from the Warlock\u2019s Vault.\u201d\u201cMoney?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s quite a big amount, but Mr. Kent can have it.\u201dKent spoke with a surprised expression.\u201cUgh, why\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve got enough money. So, I don\u2019t think I need this money.\u201dOliver pointed towards the bundle of money he had received from the beggars.An amount that could last for several months. However, compared to the money stolen from the puppeteer, it was not worth a penny.\u201cWhy are you giving it to me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 but, this is your money, isn\u2019t it? The money you earned by yourself.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it right now. You can use it.\u201dKent looked at Oliver as if he couldn\u2019t understand.\u201cWhy are you doing this? I knew you weren\u2019t interested in money, but\u2026 it\u2019s still your money.\u201d\u201cI want to see what you would do.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI want to see what Mr. Kent would do with this money. So just accept it.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57Time passed and the snow began to fall.Oliver learned a lot from Kent.He learned what kind of job the Solver is. He also learned the principles of the job, human groups, points to pay attention to, basic knowledge, etc.Aside from that\u2026TAK TAKKent said while swinging the quarterstaff.\u201cI retired around 20 years ago\u2026 so to be honest, I don\u2019t know how much things have changed.\u201dTAK TADUKOliver answered, wielding a quarterstaff.\u201cI see.\u201dThe two swung the quarterstaff together.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a skill-oriented market and Landa has also developed, so everything must have changed a lot. I do not know how useful the knowledge I have taught will be. In particular, you\u2019re not trying to make money in a sh*thole like me, you\u2019re going to a higher place.\u201dWhat Kent said was true.A solver who can take advantage of the black market without being affiliated with an organization. Even Kent didn\u2019t have a sense of what kind of reputation or connections were needed to achieve that.He had heard that such beings existed, but every single one was legendary.But, ironically, Kent thought that it wouldn\u2019t be impossible for the fifteen or sixteen-year-old boy who was sweating right in front of his eyes.He didn\u2019t know why. Maybe it was his excellent black magic skills. Or, his surprisingly quick learning ability?No, there was a more fundamental reason before that.Kent couldn\u2019t explain it in detail, but he was convinced that this kid, who was different from everyone else, could get his hands on anything he wanted.It was the first time Kent felt this way when he saw a person, so he couldn\u2019t explain anything more.\u201cHa\u2026 Okay, let\u2019s stop here.\u201dKent lowered the quarterstaff and stepped back. Following that Oliver also stepped back in the same manner as Kent.Just three months ago, the skinny guy, who didn\u2019t even know how to hold a quarterstaff had now changed completely and mastered all the basics.To the point where he can fight against Kent.Although Kent controlled his strength moderately, it was still a scary learning speed.\u201cHow is it? Mr. Kent.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s enough to not get beaten up by a passerby. But don\u2019t let your guard down, keep practicing just like I told you. Don\u2019t forget to eat and exercise.\u201dAt Kent\u2019s nagging like a parent, Oliver nodded.\u201cYes, I understand.\u201dAfter answering, Oliver wiped himself with a towel and started getting dressed.Brown cotton pants and a khaki overcoat, it was an old outfit he bought specifically for this day.\u201cAre you going now?\u201d\u201cYes, I should.\u201dOliver answered while carrying his bag.\u201cOkay\u2026 Your voice has power. Your voice is important for the work. It gives trust\u2026 I wish I had done a little more work on your facial expressions.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t understand how to put an expression on my face.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. There\u2019s no one who can be good at everything\u2026 Can you stand in front of me for a moment?\u201dAt Kent\u2019s request, Oliver went and stood in front of him.It was not too stiff and not too flattered, so he exuded natural yet relaxed confidence.\u201cWhy do you want to use the black market?\u201d\u201cIn order to obtain books related to black magic.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you interested in books about the demons?\u201d\u201cI am not interested in that yet.\u201d\u201cOkay. Excellent\u2026 Even if you are at the bottom of the league, anyone who is interested in the demons will be a target of caution. Keep answering only that much. However, never deny anything strongly. It\u2019ll look more suspicious. So always deny it on a moderate level.\u201d\u201cUm, yes, I understand.\u201d\u201cAgain, don\u2019t ask too much about this and that. No matter how curious you are, be patient if it\u2019s not the right time. At the same time, you have to be careful with your mouth. If you ask a lot of questions, you will be exposed, and there will be people who want to use it. No matter how curious you are, be patient until the right situation arises for you to ask. Chance will come to the one who waits for it. If it\u2019s a warlock like you, then it will definitely come.\u201d\u201cYes. By the way, when is the right time?\u201d\u201cWhen they feel afraid of you or desperately need you. Then, naturally, it will be easier to get the answer you want.\u201d\u201cYes, I will keep that in mind.\u201dHearing the answer, Kent handed out a letter to Oliver.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cThe letter of introduction. This is the letter of introduction to the broker I told you about. It\u2019s sealed, so don\u2019t open it. If it\u2019s opened, he might suspect it\u2019s been tampered with. He\u2019s kind of a nitpicker, but he won\u2019t be a bad choice for the first person for you to work with. He has a great sense of work.\u201dKent said sincerely.Oliver nodded and put the letter in his pocket, then headed out of the beggar\u2019s den.\u201cWhat should you do before you go to meet the broker?\u201d\u201cPut on a leather mask.\u201d\u201cYes, he\u2019s a good man, but still don\u2019t reveal your identity. It will become a burden on your safety and activity.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Then, goodbye Mr. Kent.\u201dOliver said while leaving the beggar\u2019s den under the snowy sky.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026 Here, take this.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026?\u201dOliver asked while looking at the quarterstaff that Kent extended towards him.\u201cIt\u2019s a gift. I\u2019ve received a lot of stuff, so I can\u2019t just send you back with bare hands.\u201d\u201cA gift?\u201d\u201cYeah, it might be an old quarterstaff, but it\u2019s the most important thing to me. Please, accept it.\u201dOliver looked at the quarterstaff without saying a word.The handle was smooth, and it was bandaged in the middle where it was tattered revealing how old it was.More than anything else, Kent\u2019s feelings were in it since it was something that he shared his whole life.\u201c\u2026 Are you not going to take it?\u201d\u201cAre you really giving this to me? It\u2019s a precious thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s why I am giving it to you.\u201dOliver took the quarterstaff with a more blunt expression than usual.Then, Kent said.\u201cJust remember one thing. You\u2019re not weird or broken. You are just different. Just keep that in mind and live your life.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dOliver answered and left the beggar\u2019s den. Kent waved his hand until he couldn\u2019t see him anymore.SCREECHA gloomy gray taxi came to a rough stop on the side of the road.If you look closely, you could see that the exterior of the car was rusty and dusty.\u201cDistrict T, 27th Street. We\u2019re here, sir.\u201dThe driver in plain clothes said while drinking a bottle wrapped in a brown paper bag.\u201cHere you go, Sir. Thank you.\u201dAfter handing over the money, Oliver greeted him as he practiced.Fortunately, it was natural, so the driver smiled and waved his hand.\u201cI hope you have a good day, Sir.\u201dThe taxi left as soon as Oliver got off.It was a good start.Oliver first went straight into a dark alley, and then he took out a leather mask from his bag and placed it on his face.It was a mask that Oliver took from Puppeteer Glyph.After a while, after confirming that even his hand had changed, Oliver took out a note and looked.District T, a working-class residence in Landa.It certainly looked better than District X or W, and although it was inferior to the center of Landa, there were many people on the street, and most of the buildings were in use.There was no strange graffiti or totems on the buildings.Oliver started walking along the main road starting from the entrance of 27th street according to the direction drawn on the note.After a while, he came to a three-way intersection.\u201cUm\u2026.\u201dOliver\u2019s eyes stopped at one place.It was a restaurant with a signboard saying FORREST.TRING.As soon as he opened the door, a simple-dressed staff came.The staff had distinctive red-colored skin and a name tag saying Al on the chest.\u201cHello, Guest. Are you here alone?\u201d\u201cI heard you were looking for an employee.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, Guest. We are already full.\u201d\u201cI have a letter of introduction.\u201d\u201cIntroduction?\u201d\u201cYes, here.\u201dOliver pulled out the letter of introduction that Kent had given him from his pocket and held it out.The employee received the letter with a soft smile.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but could you wait for a moment?\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201d\u201cThank you. I will come back as soon as possible.\u201dThe staff greeted him and went somewhere for a while.After a while, he returned to guide Oliver.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, could you follow me? Sir.\u201dOliver nodded and followed him.They crossed the restaurant and bar, entered the staff aisle, and stopped in front of a gate.\u201cBoss, I brought the person here.\u201d\u201cLet him in, Al.\u201dThe waiter opened the door and gestured for Oliver to go inside.Oliver greeted the waiter lightly and went inside, where an old man was sitting.He looked pretty well-dressed in a waistcoat, pants, and gloves, and he looked pretty sturdy too.At least he was the first old man Oliver had ever met to be so strong.\u201cHello\u2026.my name is Dave.\u201d\u201cDave?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you. Dave, I\u2019m Forrest. Excuse me for the rudeness, can you show me that quarterstaff?\u201dOlive looked at his quarterstaff and asked.\u201cThis one?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the one, Dave.\u201d\u201c\u2026here.\u201dOlive handed the quarterstaff which was a gift from Kent.\u201cHmm\u2026 it\u2019s really Kent\u2019s quarterstaff. I didn\u2019t expect him to be still alive. And it\u2019s even more amazing that he send a letter.\u201dThe old man glanced at the letter.\u201cI don\u2019t like wasting time, so I will ask straight-forward. Did you come here because you want to be a Solver?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAre you a warlock? Are you a talented one?\u201dOliver recalled a conversation he had with Kent.\u201cI think I have some basic skills.\u201d\u201cWell, okay\u2026 There\u2019s no point in talking with one\u2019s mouth anyway. Do you mind if I test you?\u201d\u201cA test?\u201dOliver asked.Kent said if he took the letter of introduction, he would be accepted right away.Forrest kindly explained.\u201cI don\u2019t want you to misunderstand. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to deceive or make you work for free. I\u2019ll pay the price. However, this field has changed a lot since Kent worked.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes, the competition in the Magic Tower has become fierce, and the wizards started to enter this field, and there are also quite a few Reinforced humans who had strengthened their bodies. From the colonial war soldiers to retired soldiers\u2026 This field is now full of powerful people.\u201dForrest\u2019s words were sincere.Oliver nodded.\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\u201cThank you for understanding. There are some guys who don\u2019t understand, rather they don\u2019t listen.\u201d\u201cCan you tell me the details of the test, Sir?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a polite person. I like it. First, let\u2019s start with a simple task that has no penalty for failure, like catching a person who has a bounty, retrieving the stolen items, or\u2026 Ah! I will ask again. Are you confident with your skills?\u201dOliver replied according to Kent\u2019s advice.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen, bring me an animal.\u201d\u201cAn animal?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 it\u2019s more like a beast than an animal.With those words, Forrest pulled out a file folder from the cabinet.Oliver opened the file folder and checked, and he could see clear texts along with a black-and-white photo.\u201cIt\u2019s a strange animal.\u201d\u201c\u2026? Of course, it\u2019s strange. It\u2019s a chimera\u2026\u2026it seems like it came out from its training station in the underground.\u201dOliver looked at the animal in the picture without answering.It looked like a fusion of all kinds of creatures starting from the base of a giant dog, with a chicken-like wing on its back and claws of raptors on its front paws.But the thing that stood out the most were the thorns on its side.\u201cA chimera made by the Magic Lab Mattel, and they said it escaped to the sewer during an experiment. The lab secretly placed a bounty on the creature.\u201d\u201cShould I capture this thing?\u201d\u201cYeah, but don\u2019t kill or injure it in the process. They said they would hold you accountable if you injure the creature since it was an important sample.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cThe current reward is 42 million. It\u2019s quite high. It\u2019s been almost two weeks since it escaped, and no one can catch it because it\u2019s a biological weapon. It\u2019s sneaky, it\u2019s strong, and it\u2019s tricky because it shoots the thorns in the side. Even though not much experienced, Four Solvers have already died, and civilians are also in a state of panic because the creature had already experienced the taste of human meat in the process. The area where it is running rampant is the slums of District V, and if it were to go on like this, the police department would smell it too, so the guys in the Lab are starting to get nervous. Do you still want to try? I can recommend something else if you want.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ll give it a try.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cYes, but I have one question.\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cAfter capturing it there, should I have to bring it all the way here?\u201d\u201cI forgot to explain about this. You don\u2019t have to do any of that. The lab officials will be on standby near the place where Chimera is currently rampaging. Once you capture the creature, you just have to find them and tell them my name. Well, I\u2019ll give you the other details you need to know to track it down.\u201dOliver nodded at Forrest\u2019s sincere words.\u201cI will ask again. Are you really okay? I\u2019m not belittling you, but it could be a big deal. I\u2019m asking you, as Kent\u2019s acquaintance.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t want to die, but I think it\u2019ll be okay. Above all, I want to see the creature called Chimera.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58District V, 42nd Street.As Forrest said, it was an abandoned place.Crude brick houses and shacks were densely built around, similar to a hill, and there was also a garbage dump that was irregularly located like pimples in the middle.If looked at its appearance from the middle of the street, it would be similar to District X and District W.Nevertheless, the difference was that there were far fewer people who lived in hiding and exuded craftiness.Rather, there were more people who were anxious and afraid.If the people in District W &amp; X were like predators, the people in District V were like prey?\u201cAre you from Magic Lab Mattel?\u201dOliver approached a man sitting at the entrance of District V and asked.Although he was dressed in a relatively ordinary dress, he looked very different from the people who belonged to this place.His clothes were clean, his posture was also not bent down, and the most strange thing was his emotional state.Oliver didn\u2019t know if it was because of the chimera, but the people living here had some fear, while this man only had relaxed emotions like annoyance and irritability.He acted like a stranger who doesn\u2019t empathize with the worries of the neighborhood. And Oliver\u2019s prediction was right on the mark.\u201cWho\u2026.?\u201d\u201cMy name is Dave. Mr. Forrest has sent me.\u201dThe man and those around him nodded their head as soon as they heard Forrest\u2019s name.They seemed to be the officials hired by Mattel Research Lab, and Forrest told Oliver to go to them as soon as he arrived.Forrest told Oliver to first officially announce that Oliver had come to work, and the second was to get the necessary supplies.\u201cCan I get a sample?\u201dSample.At that word, the man took something out of the barrel.It was a hair.\u201cGiving to people like you is of no use. There are already people like you who chased after that beast with this hair, but they either lost it or died.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dOliver answered with a short answer.It was because Kent deliberately told him to keep his answers short.He said that the longer one talks, the longer he reveals himself.At a glance, the job of a Solver may seem like one where one has to develop trust with the client, but in reality, it was the other way around.The thing they should develop was not trust but fear, which grows when one doesn\u2019t know the other side\u2019s true intentions.But the person in front of Oliver had either of those towards him.This was because he did not show any emotional fluctuations even though the chimera was not caught.Oliver thought of what Forrest said about things getting difficult for the client if they didn\u2019t catch the chimera quickly.Oliver thought whether the emotional state of the person in front of him was like that because he was hired, and has nothing to do with the Lab.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Now, take this.\u201dThe Lab employee handed him a stick that looked like a fountain pen, with a bright red button on top.\u201cIf you caught it successfully don\u2019t bring it back, just press this button. Then, we\u2019ll come to collect it.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dOliver responded obediently and picked it up, but as Oliver was about to leave, the Lab employee called Oliver once again and said.\u201cI\u2019m just asking this because I\u2019m worried that you are new to this field. Will you be okay? Most people have already given up on this job,\u00a0 while you are going in alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Um, yes, It\u2019s all right. Thank you for your concern.\u201dOliver answered politely and went on his way.The man just looked at Oliver without saying anything.Not long after entering the neighborhood, an uphill road came.The road was quite unfriendly, and it was rough because there were many damaged places.However, the biggest problem was that there were too many side roads through buildings beside the main road.It was kind of like a maze, and a first-timer like Oliver was destined to lose his way.It seemed like what Kent said was right.Power was essential to become a Solver, but power alone was not enough.At least to achieve his goals, Oliver needed to develop a variety of other talents.\u201cUm\u2026 Practice\u2026\u201dOliver murmured as he pulled out the sample he had just received.Chimera\u2019s fur.No matter how complicated the road was, he would be able to reach the target with just this.If he were to cast [Sensitive nose] then he would be able to find traces of the chimera among the many branches of scents.However, what he was hesitant about was,\u00a0 using black magic directly.When he was looking for Harmonica in the past, he realized that the disease-based black magic takes a toll on his body.It was not a very pleasant experience for Oliver.Smelling so many smells at the same time was more tiring than he thought, and he didn\u2019t know that it would restrict his actions because of its side effects like headaches.So Oliver decided to try another method.\u201cMinion.\u201dAfter making a minion naturally as if breathing, Oliver casted [Sensitive nose] with the opposite hand and applied it on the minion.Then, the minion, who looked like a meatball, suddenly had a human nose, through which it started to wiggle and sniff.\u201cPlease find this smell.\u201dOliver took out the fur of the chimera and asked.The minion sniffed the chimera\u2019s fur and looked around for a moment before suddenly moving in one direction.Oliver followed the minion while extracting emotions from the test tube.TAP TAPAs Oliver walked, he realized that there were hardly any people around, he wondered whether it was because it was a slum but when he focused his powers on his eyes, he realized that it wasn\u2019t the case.The people inside the building and the surrounding streets were deliberately avoiding Oliver. Like people who don\u2019t want to be swept away by dangerous things, they looked at Oliver with fear and annoyance.And that wasn\u2019t the only strange thing.The minion who was enchanted by [Sensitive nose] chased after the smell as Oliver asked, but it could not find the chimera, the only thing it found was its feces and hair.And while repeating the same process, Oliver had entered the slum so deeply that he did not know where he was, and he had reached the deepest part of the slum.At that moment a thought occurred to him.\u201c\u2026 Am I being lured?\u201dIf it were a normal person, they would have denied this.Although the chimera was highly intelligent and cunning, it was still a beast.How can a beast lure a man?Beyond simple logic, there was also a problem with self-esteem, and Oliver, who was not too concerned with self-esteem, immediately took this fact seriously.Even after chasing the smell, the bait continued to come out, and the body of the creature was nowhere to be seen.Oliver stopped the minion as he fell into deep thought.\u2018What should I do?\u2019He immediately decided to activate his Warlock eyes and made a wide-range search.The emotions of humans and beasts were different, so Oliver thought it would definitely help with the search.However, at the same time, he started to hesitate.Kent advised Oliver to develop various talents if possible.Oliver also thought that it was right, so he thought about whether it was right to use a convenient method immediately or to develop his experience by using a different search method, and at that moment he heard the sound of a creature.CAKIIIIIINNNNNN!Oliver ran straight in the direction where the sound of the beast was heard.In the place he reached, there was a skinny dog that was stabbed to death by an unknown thorn.The surrounding was filled with blood.It was as if the beast had killed the dog just to lure Oliver here, and it wasn\u2019t just a wild guess.GURRRRRRRR!There was a strange cry and a whimper that was not too distinct from Oliver.Oliver turned his head to look at it.It was the monstrous beast Chimera that he saw in the black and white photo.It was much bigger than it looked in the picture, with tiny chicken wings on its back and menacing thorns on its sides.It was a brief moment, but Oliver could see the veins sprouting from its side as if it was trying to shoot thorns.It was very interesting.Oliver wondered how can a beast lure a person and try a surprise attack.He wondered if it was the power of magic.\u201cWuuuuuuuuuuu\u2026\u201d\u201cUm?\u201dA strange thing happened.The fierce beast, who was about to attack right away, was strangely scared when its eyes met Oliver\u2019s.The beast\u2019s eyes widened, it began to sweat and its tail curled up, and it began to run away desperately before getting into battle.TAKOliver reflexively pounded his quarterstaff on the floor and used [Vine Shadow], since he thought it would be hard to catch the Chimera if he missed it.Surprisingly, however, the Chimera had a much better sense than other beasts, and as soon as the shadow tentacles came out, it ran away with an agility that was not suitable for its size.Oliver didn\u2019t know why, but the Chimera seemed to hate Oliver quite a bit.Fortunately, this worked to Oliver\u2019s advantage.TAK[Black Cube.]Oliver made six black curtains.As an image was drawn on his head, the black curtains got connected to each other without any distortion, making it a huge hexagonal prison.WURRRRR\u2026!The Chimera felt flustered, and it resisted by attacking the curtain with the raptor\u2019s claws, teeth, and even thorns on the side. The chimera looked extremely ferocious.Oliver brought the Black Cube in front of him and looked at the Chimera.WUUUUUUWUUUUUUWUUUUUU.The Chimera\u2019s state of emotion was not normal, it was as if it had faced a natural disaster.Oliver thought that at this rate it would end up running again, so he took action right away.[Deep Sleep]Oliver extracted the emotions and applied a small portion of them on the end of the quarterstaff given by Kent, then he tapped on the Chimera.They told Oliver not to harm the beast, so he thought that this much would be fine.Contrary to his expectations, the Chimera did not fall asleep immediately, it resisted a lot before falling asleep.After making sure that the Chimera was asleep more than three times, Oliver took out the fountain pen-like device he had received and pressed the red button.If what the man he met at the entrance said was right, someone will come soon.Now, all that Oliver had to do was to wait for the people to come.\u201c\u2026 Um.\u201dOliver took a step back and looked at the sleeping Chimera.It wasn\u2019t too difficult to catch, but apart from that, this creature in front of him was really an interesting creature.This creature was created by stitching several animals together.The crude wings on its back seemed to be the sign of a failure, but in Oliver\u2019s eyes, it still had plenty of potential.But the most impressive thing was its ability to lure people and attack them by surprise.Oliver wondered if he could make something similar to that with black magic, and at that moment he saw something which made Oliver\u2019s eyes shine.Oliver wasn\u2019t sure because it was very faint.\u201cThis\u2026.?\u201dOliver reached out his hands towards the Chimera\u2019s body.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dOliver turned his head in the direction of the sound and there he saw the person he had met before.Even though he was covering his face, Oliver could identify him through his emotions.He showed a vigilant look at Oliver who was about to touch the Chimera, Oliver immediately took his hand off and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I just wanted to check if there was a wound here.\u201dThe man silently looked at Oliver, and Oliver did not avert his eyes.This, too, was one of Kent\u2019s teachings.Act as if you trust them, but never back away.Fortunately, the advice worked, and the man spoke first avoiding Oliver\u2019s gaze.\u201cWhat wound were you talking about?\u201d\u201cHere\u2026.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026ah, this is fine.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fortunate.\u201dThe man looked up at Oliver again and beckoned his colleagues who followed him.At his command, they took out a huge bag and put the Chimera inside, and Oliver could see the magic flowing through the bag.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cIs this the end?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s our job from here on\u2026 Was it Mr. Forrest who sent you?\u201cYes.\u201dThe man nodded as he took out his notebook, and wrote it down.\u201cHmm\u2026 well, we\u2019ll get in touch, and we\u2019ll try to give you the reward as soon as possible. You can receive it through the broker.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYou are better than other people. The other Solvers ran away or got carried away\u2026 Thanks to that I had been on standby for two weeks.\u201d\u201cI was just lucky.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026you were lucky?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOliver responded moderately.Even though the person in front of him didn\u2019t have any malice, he was still calculating something on the inside.\u201c\u2026if it\u2019s okay, can I go now?\u201d\u201cOh, of course.\u201dAs soon as he gave the answer, Oliver bowed his head and turned.Then, the man spoke to Oliver once again.\u201cGood job, Dave. See you later if we had a chance.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59When Oliver returned to District T from District V, the time passed from evening to night.The streets were quiet compared to the daytime, but it was not very quiet either.Unlike Districts W and X, large and small pubs in alleys and main roads were opened to welcome guests.And it was the same with Forrest Restaurant.TRING.As Oliver opened the door and entered, the red-skinned Al appeared and greeted him just like the first time he had visited.\u201cHello. Mr. Dave. Welcome. Nice to see you again. Boss is waiting for you.\u201dHe guided him as if he knew everything, and Oliver didn\u2019t ask any questions.It seemed true that it was like a savage market, but it unexpectedly was systemic and detailed.As Al said, Forrest, the owner, and broker of the restaurant was sitting in the middle of the cleaned-up restaurant, waiting for Oliver.\u201cNice to meet you. I was looking forward to seeing you again, but I didn\u2019t think it would be today.\u201dForrest got up and greeted Oliver politely.Oliver also matched with it and greeted Forrest with high courtesy.\u201cWow, It was really great. I expected that you would take some time to catch it, but it\u2019s a bit unexpected that you could catch it in one day\u2026\u201d\u201cI was just lucky.\u201d\u201cThen, it\u2019s really your lucky day. Have you had your dinner?\u201dOliver thought and answered\u201c\u2026 No, I haven\u2019t yet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s late, but if it\u2019s okay, I\u2019d like to treat you to a meal, will you allow me?\u201dOliver tried to say no because he wasn\u2019t hungry, but he quickly stopped saying that and agreed.It seemed like Forrest only favors the people he likes, and Oliver felt maybe he was treating him well because Kent has asked in advance, so he decided it was better to just accept whatever he gives.As soon as Oliver accepted, the staff in relatively neat clothes brought the dishes.It was a fish dish with sauce.\u201cDo you hate fish?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 I will eat, thank you.Oliver skillfully cut the fish meat with a fork and knife.Forrest also ate at a similar pace and pretended not to observe Oliver.\u201c\u2026you eat pretty well.\u201d\u201cUm?\u201d\u201cOh, excuse me. I apologize if you feel offended. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen someone who eats with dignity like you, so please don\u2019t mind it.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, instead of the proper meal, most of them prefer alcohol or a big chunk of meat. Kent was the former.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026that\u2019s why it\u2019s amazing to see people who eat so politely.\u201d\u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201dOliver responded briefly and politely according to Kent\u2019s advice.So far it was going well.Forrest stared at Oliver, with a piercing gaze on his face similar to Kent, Pharmacist, and James.Oliver did nothing but look at him as usual.Forrest took away his gaze and resumed eating.\u2018Did he just move on?\u2019Oliver ate while thinking about it.CLATTER CLATTER.About the time the plate was half empty, Forrest stopped eating and beckoned the waiter and told him something.After a while, Al brought 42 million reward, or 35.7 million to be exact.\u201cThe reward is 35.7 million. I have replaced the large bundle with the highest denomination bill so that it\u2019s easy to carry around. Originally, the reward was 42 million, but 15% of it, which is 6.3 million, was deducted, as my commission. Do you have any questions?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s short answer, Forrest\u2019s eyebrows rose slightly.It was the same reaction as someone who didn\u2019t get the answer they had been waiting for.It was then that Oliver understood the situation and said.\u201cI don\u2019t care if the fee is a little higher. Mr. Kent said that Mr. Forrest takes a 15% commission, 1.5 times higher than other brokers, but he deserves it.\u201d\u201c\u2026did he say that?\u201d\u201cYes, he said, there are dark corners, but when it comes to working in this field, you have a strong sense of responsibility, and you also provide various services. So he said that I could do business with you with confidence.\u201dAt that moment, Forrest\u2019s emotions fluctuated slightly.Regret, guilt, sorry, longing.Oliver felt that these emotions had something to do with Kent, but soon, Forrest recovered his composure.He seemed to have a strong will.Forrest clasped his hands and said.\u201cThank you for your kind words\u2026 Shall we get down to business now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOliver also stopped eating and showed that he was concentrating.\u201cFirst of all, I would like to say congratulations on passing the test formally. I will be your broker as promised. Al?\u201dAt Forrest\u2019s call, the employee named Al brought the documents.\u201cIt\u2019s a formality, so please fill it out. It\u2019s a simple employment contract.\u201d\u201cCan I read it once?\u201d\u201cOf course, of course. The basic fee, the provisions you must abide by, the penalty for breaking the law, and the duties and services that should be provided to you by me were all written down.\u201dOliver read through the papers while listening to his words.Perhaps it was thanks to reading a lot of books, he was able to read the documents smoothly without clogging.There was no problematic content in the contract. As Forrest said, the commission, the distribution of responsibilities that arise during the mission, and the provisions to be observed between each other were written down.It wasn\u2019t much different from what Kent explained.There were parts that were too strict and complicated, and there were parts that looked unfriendly, but it was rather perfect because the responsibility could be clearly identified.The contract was as if a representation of Forrest\u2019s personality.\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dOliver pointed to the protection clause written at the bottom.\u201cWhat is this part?\u201cAs you can see. Brokers like me are all over Landa. Even in the political and administrative Districts A, B, and C, we belong to one union, so we check and help each other.\u201d\u201cYes, I heard about that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad. Then you might also have known that our brokers\u2019 union is lobbying the police department. Thanks to that, the Solvers who do business with us get some benefits. For example, they will ignore crimes committed by a person under a certain threshold. Of course, it shouldn\u2019t be an issue, but they will close one eye in most cases.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cAnd the same goes for a warlock like you. Warlocks are people who use humans as their material. In fact, you can be arrested for being a Warlock.\u201dOliver nodded.He already knows about this through Joseph\u2019s books and from Kent.He learned that the warlocks hide either in the shadows or through fake identities.Of course, if the police department tried to catch them, it would be pretty easy to catch them, but because of the enormous cost, danger, and uproar involved, they just don\u2019t do it.It was similar to catching a cockroach when you can\u2019t see it and can\u2019t beat it to death when you do see it.\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cYes, but while you\u2019re working with me, there won\u2019t be any problems as long as you don\u2019t cause any major problems. Even if you had an accident while working, I\u2019ll protect you to some extent as long as you don\u2019t exceed a certain level.\u201d\u201cI understand. So, all I have to do is not do things in this category?\u201dThe category Oliver pointed at included demon worship and illegal human experimentation.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s something that should never be done, and if you do even one among them, then the contract with me will be automatically terminated. Besides, it also does not protect you against crimes that occur during missions that do not go through me, and the same goes for other disturbances in your daily life. Did you understand?\u201dOliver nodded.It seemed like he was protected only when he stayed quiet and performed his duties.To be honest, it wasn\u2019t bad. Oliver didn\u2019t have any plans to do anything right away, and he didn\u2019t have any intention of causing a fuss. So, there was no problem.However, it seemed like it will take a while to experiment on the human body. Oliver wondered if the carcass of a dog or other animals would be included in this clause.The book he obtained from Puppeteer Gylph described how to preserve a corpse, remodel it, and control it from a distance.Personally, he wanted to experiment with it right away if he could afford it because he was curious about it to some extent.Unfortunately, he could only try it with the animal body at this moment\u2026 Of course, he wanted to try it with a human corpse if possible.However, seeing the contents of the document, it seemed impossible right now.\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing.\u201dOliver delayed the answer, thinking that it would be inappropriate to ask right now.Oliver thought it would be okay to ask once he gained more experience and raised the value of his name.Forrest looked at him suspiciously, but he didn\u2019t pry into it and moved on to the next topic.\u201cWhy? Did it feel too grandiose? Don\u2019t take it seriously. You and I signed a contract out of our necessity, and accordingly, we have a minimum obligation to protect each other. That\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\u201c\u2026do you have any more questions?\u201dOliver wanted to ask him about the black market right away, but he suppressed his desire.Oliver thought that it would be inappropriate to talk about the black market right away.As he decided earlier, he thought he should ask once he gained enough experience and had learned about the field.Perhaps, if Oliver was to mention the black market, then Forrest would definitely ask why. As he had already practiced it several times, Oliver was planning to answer, \u201cTo find a book about Black Magic.\u201dIt was perfect.Oliver felt pity that it will take some time, but encouraged himself that there will definitely be something to learn in the meantime.Oliver was determined.\u201cNone.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026that\u2019s the end of it. Let\u2019s do our best from now on.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you. Ah, that\u2019s right\u2026\u2026\u201dOliver took out ten bills from the bundle of paper money he received as a reward.Oliver asked Forrest to take the 100,000 denomination bills and exchange them for 50,000 and 10,000 bills.This was because, more than 50,000, the 100,000 bills stood out, because it was the highest denomination currency.\u201cYou want to change it?\u201d\u201cYes, I heard from Mr. Kent that Mr. Forrest offers such a service.\u201d\u201cThen, you must have heard that the exchange fee is 10 percent.\u201d\u201cYes, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cAll right, Al.\u201dForrest picked up the 100,000 bills and handed them to Al, and Al went to the office for a while and brought the equivalent amount, half in 10,000 and the other half in 50,000 bills respectively.Al gave Oliver a friendly smile, and Oliver also bowed politely and received the money.When Oliver was done, he ate the remaining food, wiped his mouth with a napkin, and got up.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201d\u201cOf course, you did a great job.\u201dForrest rose from his seat and reached out to Oliver.Oliver held the hand and quietly stepped back.Oliver left the restaurant while greeting all the employees he met on his way out.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dAfter Oliver left, Forrest, who stayed behind, ate the fish while sitting and asked the employee, Al.\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of innocence, like a kid who came out to the world for the first time, but basically, he seems like a good guy. He can communicate, there are no eccentric parts, and from what I heard from Mattel, he certainly seems to have skills.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. I\u2019ve never seen a warlock with good skills and a good personality. He was born as a Warlock, but his fundamentals are similar to that of a wizard.\u201dAl laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s not a story that other warlocks would like very much.\u201d\u201cIs that so? But that\u2019s the truth.\u201dThere was a clattering sound of dishes again\u201cWhat would you like to do, Boss? Mattel asked to share Mr. Dave\u2019s information, are you going to accept it?\u201dForrest remained silent.Mattel Research Institute, founded by the School of Life Magic, was a large research group built by combining capitalists\u2019 money and Wizard\u2019s technology.It was a huge organization that had numerous patents and had a considerable amount of influence in the medical field.The official image was good too, but in reality, they were madmen who are obsessed with magic supremacy and eugenics.According to the rumors, the chimera which had escaped this time seems to be released on purpose, and it did not actually escape.This was in order to extract data on how well the biological weapon they are developing works.Of course, it was at the level of rumors, but it was also a story that was possible if it was Mattel.Such people were interested in a warlock, a young 20-year-old who came in for the first time today.\u201c\u2026for once, let\u2019s refuse.\u201dEmployee Al nodded at Forrest\u2019s answer.\u201cYes, but will it be okay?\u201d\u201cIf we look at the way they have spoken, they are just poking. There\u2019s no need to react to that. For now, let\u2019s watch.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201dAl answered and disappeared after taking the plate that Oliver had emptied.Only Forrest was left behind in the hall, and he muttered with a meaningful smile.\u201cIt seems like I won\u2019t be bored for a while?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60While Forrest was talking to Al about Oliver, Oliver had already entered the second step of his new life.The first step was, of course, to become a Solver by signing the contract with Forrest, and the second step was just as important as the first one in some sense and was more difficult than the first.It was none other than finding accommodation.It may sound like bullshit, but, in the case of Oliver, it was true.Finding accommodation was unexpectedly difficult for Oliver, who lacked common sense about things such as buying or having normal conversationsIt may sound silly, but for him, it was more difficult than catching a chimera, but fortunately, it wasn\u2019t as difficult as he thought.It was because Kent had already taught him how to find a decent accommodation, and he had told Oliver how to get a room and how much the room prices can be lowered in case of a long-term stay.After several trial and error, Oliver was able to get a room at a decent lodging, a few steps away from the Forrest restaurant, more easily than he expected.As it was a place that does business all night, he was able to find a room without much noise, and as Kent advised, he was able to reduce the price of the room by paying one month\u2019s rent in advance.CLICK.Oliver opened the door and looked at the room.It wasn\u2019t a very good room for the price, but it was still quite spacious.It was a good enough room for Oliver, who had been sleeping in the beggar\u2019s den until yesterday.After entering the room Oliver unloaded his bag, put the quarter-staff against the wall, took off his coat, and felt a little satisfaction.It was a very successful first day after leaving the beggar\u2019s den.It was different from what he expected, but anyway, he met Forrest and became a Solver, and he also got a place to stay.It was pretty good by Oliver\u2019s standard.But the joy was short-lived.Because this was just the starting point.Oliver\u2019s goal was to get the books and knowledge he wants by using the black market.However, compared to that goal, what he did today was a mere starting point\u2026. No, this couldn\u2019t even be considered as a starting point.As Kent said, the black market is an unknown territory that ordinary people could never get access to.Even though Oliver had some experience with the underworld, he would still need to put a lot of effort to get there from here, and even if he were to become qualified enough to use it, that\u2019s not the end. Because he needed money to buy things.Kent said that he did not know the details because he had never used the black market, but considering its reputation, he said that it would require a huge amount of money just to use it once.If Oliver wanted to buy a rare book about black magic or a book about demons, Kent said that he would need a lot more money.Oliver also agreed with that, since it was natural that the rarer and more dangerous the books on black magic and the books on demons are, the more expensive it would be, and when these thoughts hit his brain, Oliver couldn\u2019t sleep even though he was a little tired.Instead of falling asleep his mind became clearer.If he didn\u2019t put this issue back altogether, it would get hard to sleep well today too.So, to organize his thoughts, Oliver took off his coat and lifted the quarterstaff that was placed against the wall.He grabbed the end and stretched it forward until it reached the opposite wall.Oliver then began to pull and swing the quarterstaff as he had practiced with Kent.He could hear the sound of striking the air, which could be said as a major development compared to the beginning.Oliver continued to repeat the movements mechanically while thinking about what to do next.The first thing he thought of was his goal.Needless to say, his goal was the black market.Although he got to know about it by chance, the black market was essential to learn about the beautiful light, black magic, and demons.To use it, Kent said that he had to become a skilled Solver, build up a reputation, and form a connection with influential people like the capitalists, politicians, or the heads of the big criminal gangs who rule Landa.Kent said not to worry about it too much because Oliver\u2019s ability would be sufficient to meet the demand, but frankly, for Oliver that was still a question.Because Oliver didn\u2019t know whether he was strong or weak.Of course, out of all the warlocks he had met so far, Oliver has never been beaten by anyone and that didn\u2019t make Oliver feel prideful or confident.In the past, some people almost killed Oliver, such as the Lightning Wizard or Joseph, and especially, the moment he met \u2018old man on horseback\u2019 was still unforgettable.Despite the crude appearance of flesh and intestines intertwined, Oliver had no idea of how he was going to win if he were to fight him.Of course, unknown familiarity was stronger than fear, and it did not attack instead it greeted him, Oliver found this certainly out of place.It was a baseless instinct, but he was more certain.It could be said that Oliver was lucky enough to survive that.That was why Oliver tried to be as careful as possible. Kent also said that, and of course, Oliver too didn\u2019t want to die.Dying was a scary thing for Oliver, and it was even more frightening to die while there were so many questions unanswered like now.Kent advised him to collect more information to avoid such a scary situation.That\u2019s why Kent didn\u2019t die and survived, and of course, Oliver was going to follow that advice unconditionally.As advised by the broker Forrest, Oliver planned to solve the requests one by one to build a career, gain trust, and learn about this field.Oliver was a little impatient, and he still has a lot of work to do, because Forrest said that this field was different from when Kent was working.Oliver thus planned to slowly but surely approach the black market by learning and conquering this field.Oliver wouldn\u2019t have thought so deeply if it had been in the past, but thanks to Kent\u2019s constant explanation, he was able to recognize what was necessary right now.It was to minimize the risks as much as possible to reach the goal.-Well, if you want to be a Solver who can use the black market then facing risks is inevitable.Kent\u2019s unconfident voice suddenly rang in his ears.Kent had been teaching Oliver hard for the past three months, but nevertheless, he always said uneasily that the road to the black market was an unknown territory he had never been to.It was like he wanted to stop Oliver if possible.Oliver stopped swinging the quarterstaff and shook his head.It was a pointless act to recall what Kent said.Anyway, this was the path Oliver chose.Curiosity was not something he could give up even if it was something he could hold it in for a while.\u201cAh\u2026 money is also a problem.\u201dOliver murmured with sweat all over his body.Then he put the quarterstaff on one of the walls and pulled out the gluttonous bag and the bundle of money he had received from Forrest today from the inside of the hanging jacket.The gluttonous bag, which was made of the beast\u2019s teeth, eyeballs, and emotions of greed opened its eyes from the desk and looked around to make sure that there was no money or precious metal nearby.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe gluttonous bag turned towards Oliver.It checked him.Then, limbs sprouted out from the gluttonous bag and it ran towards the currency bundle that Oliver had.As the gluttonous bag was about to pick up the bundle of currency notes, Oliver blocked it with his hand.The gluttonous bag looked up at Oliver with dissatisfaction.Oliver spoke with a smile.\u201cGluttonous bag. I\u2019m sorry, but could you take out all the money that was placed in?\u201dAt first, the Gluttonous bag swung its arm in anger, but when Oliver looked at it silently, an unknown fear took over it, and it began to spit out the money by forcing its arm into its mouth.GURRR! GURRRR!It made a bizarre sound, as if it was vomiting, and poured out a bunch of currency notes.The money it vomited was the money Oliver received from the Beggars Union.Oliver picked up the piles of money one by one and calmly organized them.He included the money he received from Forrest as remuneration after finishing the mission.Altogether, it was about 80 million.It was a huge sum considering the fact that he was an orphan who had been a miner a while ago.Oliver agreed too, but now it was not enough for him.There are things that he needed to buy at the black market, and there are other things that Oliver wanted to do personally.For example, making a corpse doll.Among the books he got from Puppeteer Glyph, there was a small number of books describing how to preserve a corpse, control it remotely, and transform it into a corpse doll.Oliver read this and kept thinking about it since he wanted to try it himself.Of course, the human body could be difficult, but the animal body would be fine, but the problem was that it would also require a lot of money.Puppeteer Glyph was meticulous, so he wrote down the cost that would be needed for the work.Starting with the cost of finding a workplace, everything, such as preservatives, various drugs, mechanical devices, work tools, emotions, and Life-force, was expensive.Even with rough calculations, it can be concluded that the initial cost of making a corpse doll would at least cost from tens of millions to hundreds of millions.Stabilizing the workplace would reduce costs, but whatever comes next will take a lot of money, which means that Oliver can\u2019t make a corpse doll right away.There was something he wants to do, but he can\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t have money.Oliver seemed to understand why Peter and others crave money so much.For everything money was essential.There was no part where money did not intervene, from simply wanting to sleep and eat.This natural fact that he knew in his head felt real for the first time in his life.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Interesting.\u201dOliver muttered silently without realizing it.Until now, when he was in the orphanage, mine, warlock organization, or beggar\u2019s den, all he had to do was obey the order, but not anymore.Whether Oliver wanted it or not, he had to keep thinking for himself.To be honest, he was annoyed just thinking about it and wanted to pass it on to others, but nevertheless, Oliver felt a different emotion than before.The feeling of thinking about what to do in the future was quite interesting.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOliver took only two million of his fortune and then spoke again to the gluttonous bag.\u201cTake the rest.\u201dAt that, the gluttonous bag, which was suffering from hunger, immediately ran to the pile of money, climbed on top of it, and began to devour the money.It was very cheesy, but Oliver looked at it without saying a word and muttered.\u201cI have to make money first. Like this.\u201dThe next morning.Oliver got up early as usual.Compared to the beggar\u2019s den where he had stayed, this place can be called a palace, so there was no discomfort at all.After washing his face, getting dressed, and having a light breakfast provided by the inn, Oliver left the lodging and headed for the Forrest restaurant.Fortunately, the restaurant has been open since early in the morning, and the employee named Al welcomed him as usual.\u201cMr. Dave\u2026what are you doing here this early in the morning?\u201dOliver looked at Employee Al\u2019s emotions.There was no malice, but he seemed to be hiding something.Kent\u2019s words were right, this was a place where everyone has a secret.\u201cHello, Mr. Al. I came to see if there was any job.\u201d\u201cI see. Then, I\u2019ll guide you to the boss\u2026 Oh, and you can call me Al comfortably. Come on, follow me.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61Even though it was early in the morning, there were still customers at the Forrest restaurant.There weren\u2019t many, only two or three, but when Oliver looked at them closely, they didn\u2019t look like ordinary customers.\u201cThey\u2019re all Solvers.\u201dAl who was guiding Oliver quickly explained it to him.\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cYes, some industrious Solvers come early every morning to find out if there is anything good. There are also people who just come to eat. So our restaurant opens early in the morning.\u201d\u201cI see. Thank you for the kind explanation.\u201dOliver thanked him sincerely.There are few people who were so kind as to explain things to Oliver.Oliver thought Al was a good person.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. It was just part of my job.\u201d\u201cHey, Al. Who is that person?\u201dJust before Oliver and Al could enter the staff corridor, a woman spoke.She was sitting alone at a table covered with a white tablecloth.On the table, there was warm tea and pancakes, but she only ate half of it and left half of it as if she didn\u2019t like it.The woman was dressed in a ladylike dress, but her leather corset that accentuated her waist and chest gave off a somewhat provocative vibe.Of course, Oliver didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201cHello, Ms. Coco. This is Dave, the new Solver who came yesterday.\u201d\u201cA new Solver?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201dShe expressed her interest with a bright smile.She had a very bright smile, but on the contrary, her insides showed anomalous movements, as if she was thinking a lot.\u201cThat\u2019s the new solver that the old man Forrest accepted\u2026 that\u2019s interesting.\u201d\u201cHe has proven to have sufficient credibility and skills.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 credibility, so he was introduced by someone Old man can trust? And if he has proven himself, then\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me he was the one who caught the chimera that was making a fuss in District V?\u201dOliver raised his eyebrows slightly.He did catch a Chimera yesterday, but he wondered if the information can be spread this fast.\u201cHahaha. Don\u2019t be too surprised. That\u2019s my area of expertise. My name is Coco. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cMy name is Dave.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Dave. See you later.\u201dShe got up with a gentle, feminine gesture and left her food on the table.\u201c\u2026 Who is she? Is she also a Solver?\u201d\u201cNo. She is an information dealer who has dealing with the boss.\u201d\u201cInformation?\u201d\u201cYes, she is a person who handles information. Apart from that, she runs many other businesses\u2026 I will guide you back to the boss.\u201dKnock. Knock.When Al knocked on the door, Forrest was filling out the papers.When Oliver opened the door and came in, he signed the papers and organized them.\u201cHey, it\u2019s an unexpected guest early in the morning.\u201d\u201cI am sorry if I have caused you any inconvenience.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. I was just surprised.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cUsually, if people earn 40 million in a day, then they won\u2019t come back for at least a few weeks. They would just take a long rest.\u201d\u201cI had a good rest last night.\u201dForrest raised his hands and nodded as if he understood what Oliver meant.\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough chattering. It\u2019s obvious, but still, I\u2019ll ask. You\u2019re here to take a new job, right?\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cUm, okay. Before I arrange a job, is there anything you want to do or stay away from?\u201dSearching through the filing cabinet, Forrest asked.Oliver thought for a moment before opening his mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t really have anything that I want to do or stay away from, but I want to avoid harming the public.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad. It\u2019s the same for me. It\u2019s relatively easy, and the profit is decent, above all we can avoid being the subject of an investigation. I\u2019m glad that you have the same tendency.\u201dIt was as Kent said.Brokers were also tasked according to their personal preferences, and the nature of the solvers belonging to them also varies.It was obvious that it would be hard to work with a broker who didn\u2019t fit one\u2019s preference for a long time.\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t have anything to entrust to you at this moment.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, well, there are small things like hunting bounties and killing or capturing contaminated creatures, but the pay on these missions is low. You don\u2019t have to do something like this that has no return other than a penny? Especially since that\u2019s not the goal for you.\u201dOliver answered with silence because what he said was right.Making money was important, just as important as increasing connections and entering the black market.Suddenly, Oliver wondered whether he ever talked about this to Forrest.\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised. As you can see, I\u2019m pretty old, and I\u2019ve got a lot of experience in this field. I know that it\u2019s not just for money that a talented warlock like you would become a Solver. If you really needed money, you would have made drugs or gone to a Crime Syndicate.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Amazing.\u201d\u201cThank you for the compliment. I apologize if you were offended because I pretended to know you.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not offended. If it\u2019s okay with you, can you continue talking?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d\u201cTalk about things based on your experience.\u201dForrest looked at Oliver silently.\u201cOh, did I say anything wrong?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s fascinating, are you normally that curious?\u201d\u201cIt thinks so.\u201dForrest looked at Oliver for a moment before opening his mouth.\u201c\u2026. Warlocks who usually work as Solvers are divided into two main categories. The former are the poor ones who lack the skills, or those who have learned so much that they feel like they do not belong to a family.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cAnd the latter tends to be more diverse. Either they become a fighter who enjoys fighting, or they get tired of being with warlocks and want to gain more power. When he proves that he is a great warlock, many giants give him a hand. If you are confident enough, it is possible.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t think you\u2019re either one. The atmosphere is different. It\u2019s not something you can hide. I\u2019m just asking out of curiosity, and you don\u2019t have to answer if you don\u2019t want to. Why are you working as a Solver?\u2026 Again, if you don\u2019t want to say it, it\u2019s fine. I understand totally. It\u2019s good to keep your distance.\u201dOliver thought for a moment and spoke.\u201c\u2026because I want to use the Black market.\u201d\u201cBlack Market?\u201d\u201cYes, do you know?\u201d\u201cNo, I know similar places, but I don\u2019t know much about the black market. Why do you want to use it?\u201d\u201cNothing much, It\u2019s because I want to buy black magic books. I want to study black magic, but I don\u2019t want to be bound to an organization. Since I have to do things I don\u2019t want to do, and it takes a lot of my time.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dForrest nodded slowly. He wanted to ask something more, but he persevered from asking.Oliver suddenly wondered if he had made a mistake.Kent advised him to be as careful as possible, but it seemed like he had talked a lot this morning, in spite of yesterday\u2019s efforts.But he had no choice because Forrest\u2019s words were quite amusing.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you would tell me such an important secret within two days of our meeting. I\u2019m glad that you believe me.\u201d\u201cBecause I can\u2019t control myself when I become curious.\u201d\u201cI think so too\u2026.so your goal is the Black market\u2026then how about this job? To be honest, it\u2019s not the right thing to do, but I think it would be okay if we approach it with the concept of increasing connection.\u201dWith those words, Forrest held out a folder to Oliver.It was a stiff brown paper file folder, and the letters CF-M were written in a stylish font on the outside.Oliver opened the file folder.On one side was a black-and-white photo of a fat, middle-aged man, and on the other side was the information related to him.\u201cSubject name Herbert. Former Assistant Professor of Alchemy at the Magic Tower. Request to retrieve alive?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. By the way, the client is currently a member of Crime Firm.\u201dCrime Firm.Oliver had heard about them from Kent.They were a huge criminal organization that encompasses all of England, including Landa.In fact, they were the ones said to be ruling the underworld.Of course, it was not perfect domination due to internal conflicts and friction with other non-affiliated gangs, but it overwhelms others with sheer numbers and size, so it can be called the ruler of the underworld.Kent told him to avoid anything that could cause friction with them as much as possible, and to have a solid backing to fight them if it was unavoidable.\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand what it means by retrieve, can you explain?\u201d\u201cOf course, I was going to explain it anyway. The person in the picture was an Assistant professor, as written in the document. To be exact, he was a former Assistant professor.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that he was a professor before and not now?\u201d\u201cYeah, he quit. To be exact, he got fired because he stole some goods from the Tower to make illegal Magic wine. He ended up getting caught and was kicked out. \u201c\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cBut it didn\u2019t stop him. He had an unexpected talent and the product he made was pretty good too, so, our client approached him first and suggested doing business together. The Magic wine business.\u201dMagic wine.A generic term for alcoholic beverages processed by adding potions.It was a dangerous alcohol that could cause death or side effects if it was made incorrectly, and it was an illegal product, but if made properly, could have a tremendous taste and addictiveness that cannot be felt with conventional alcohol.Production and distribution were all considered illegal because of various reasons, such as moral reasons, the risk of production and consumption, and the sacredness of the potion, but they were traded at an expensive price because they were illegal.Oliver remembered what Kent said. He said he enjoyed drinking it when he was young.\u201cThe Assistant professor was also a person with wide social connection, so he didn\u2019t immediately bite into it, but in the end, the desperate client paid a small amount as an advance and signed a contract with him.\u201dOliver seemed to know how the story would flow.\u201cBut the problem was, after receiving the money, he disappeared. He ran away. The client worked hard to find him, and he found out where he was just a few weeks ago.\u201dOliver checked the file folder.\u201cIt\u2019s District X.\u201d\u201cYeah, no matter how big the crime organization he joined was, District X is not their territory. It\u2019s a lawless area full of non-affiliated gangs and mercenary groups. The Assistant professor is smart, he has money, so he thinks of running his own business from there.\u201dOliver thought for a moment. Suddenly, the Lightning Wizard came to his mind.\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAre there many people coming out of the tower like this?\u201dForrest thought for a moment, then answered.\u201cUm\u2026it\u2019s been like that lately. Although the status and economic influence of wizards have developed tremendously, at the same time, competition among them has intensified. Thanks to that, wizards poured into this field as well, and it\u2019s been a bit of a mess.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not there yet, but some witty, ambitious, and powerful people are noticing that a change will take place. Like two sides of the same coin, where there is light there always exists shadow. The wizards who were once called lights are slowly starting to show the shadow side, so they think they should be prepared accordingly. So those who are on the top are looking out for a good Solver.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that I can stand out if I do this job?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but there\u2019s a possibility. At least you can form a relationship with a member of Crime Firm. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll appreciate you if you were to help him because he\u2019s in a hurry.\u201dForrest\u2019s words were sincere, and they seemed logically correct.\u201cBut I\u2019m not forcing you. To be honest, this work itself doesn\u2019t fit the bill.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, the pay is 20 million, and it\u2019s a solo mission without any support. The conditions are also very strict. It would be easy if it was simple destruction or assassination, but the client is asking you to bring the Assistant professor as safely as possible.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like the Chimera job.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also different. Chimera was alone, but he isn\u2019t. He hired nearby gangs with the money he got from selling magic wine, and according to another investigation, he also seems to have hired professional mercenaries. By the way, the mercenaries are warlocks. .\u201d\u201cWarlocks?\u201d\u201cYeah, the number of warlocks has increased a lot lately. I don\u2019t know for sure why, but\u2026the risk is quite high.\u201d\u201c\u2026will this job make it easier for me to work in the future?\u201d\u201cAs the rumor spreads, the value of your name will also go up.\u201dAfter thinking seriously, Oliver answered.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll do it.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62As soon as Oliver accepted the mission of retrieving Herbert, an ex Assistant professor from the Magic Tower, he took a taxi straight to the entrance to District X.The good thing about Landa Taxi was that the drivers don\u2019t talk more than necessary to customers who are going to District X.The driver seemed to know from experience that Oliver was doing something dangerous, or at least getting involved in something like that.With such consideration from the taxi driver, Oliver skimmed through the information he had received from Forrest and recalled the explanation he gave.As soon as he accepted the job, Forrest gave him more detailed explanations different from the brief explanation he gave before.\u201cAll right, you have officially accepted the mission, so I\u2019ll explain the details of the job. First of all, you don\u2019t have to worry too much about the guy Herbert. Although he was from Magic Tower, his field of specialization is alchemy and herbal medicine, and his Magic skills are very poor. They are so poor that it\u2019s hard to believe that he was an Assistant professor at the Magic Tower.\u201dMagic skill.It was a word that encompasses a wizard\u2019s practical skills, such as the number of magic spells that can be used, skill level, and magic heart capacity, and it can be said that it was necessary to have excellent magic skills to be a strong wizard.Conversely, Herbert, who had low magic skills was deemed to have low combat powers, so Forrest said it was not necessary to be very careful against him.\u201cAnd the same goes for the gangsters gathered by him. There were about twenty to thirty people\u2026 Rather than being security guards, they are more like scarecrows that prevent the thieves and idiots from approaching the place. If there was a fight, they would probably run right away.\u201d\u201cUm??\u201d\u201cYeah, they have no proper skills, and they won\u2019t stake their life. They are just flies that gather to enjoy the sweet taste of violence and don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening around them\u2026. Well, sometimes it\u2019s a gift that you don\u2019t know too many things.\u201dForrest\u2019s words seemed like one with a deep meaning.\u201cBut the problem is these people.\u201dForrest said after taking three black and white photos from the drawer.\u201cFrom the left\u2026 No, from my left. Yeah, there\u2026 From the left \u2013 Knuckle Joe, Nico, and Bigjaw. These guys are the problem.\u201dOliver looked at the pictures one at a time and asked.\u201c\u2026 This guy looks a bit odd.\u201dOliver asked pointing at Bigjaw in the third photo.As the name suggested, he had a big jaw, and in addition to that, his forehead was protruding, and his eyes were more black than white.It may be a bit too harsh, but he looked more like a blind dog than a human.\u201cThat\u2019s right. That guy is a little unique\u2026because he\u2019s a mutant.\u201dMutants.Oliver also has heard about them from Kent.They are corrupted human beings who were born as a result of environmental pollution caused by factories or the aftermath of a magic experiment.Most of them look different from humans, and because of that, most people treat them as cursed humans or like a different species.Kent told that mutants were born in the poor or worker\u2019s residential area near the Dames River, where the factories mostly dump the wastewater.Most of them have poor intelligence, but some show amazing physical abilities.Kent also added that legally, they are arguing over how to deal with them.\u201cAll of them belong to the Fighter Crew.\u201d\u201cFighter Crew?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a new warlock organization that has emerged recently, with the structure where the members relatively have a horizontal relationship, contrary to the traditional vertical relationship composed of owners and disciples. Of course, it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have a hierarchy.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I see.\u201dOliver answered, storing the new information in his head.\u201cAnyway, this fighter crew is a relatively new warlock organization, and instead of making drugs, they do mercenary jobs. Uh, anything to do with violence \u2013 Raids, destruction, assassinations, bodyguards, guards, etc. Because of that, they are steadily increasing their power without competing with the existing warlock families. I guess they are aiming for some kind of niche market.\u201d\u201cAmazing. Mr. Forrest, how do you know all that?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m a broker. This is pretty basic. Anyway, thank you for the compliment.\u201dAfter summarizing the information, Forrest moved back to the main topic again.\u201cAll three of them are members of the Fighter Crew. Needless to say, they specialize in close combat. Knuckle Joe, just like his nickname, specializes in close combat as well as disease-based black magic.\u201dOliver looked at his quarterstaff.\u2018Close combat\u2026.\u2019\u201cNico can use firearms-based and disease-based black magic at the same time. He has pretty threatening firepower. Be careful\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAs you can see, the third Bigjaw, he bites everything with that jaw and it will be destroyed. One bite means the end, so be careful, especially against this guy\u2026. Do you have any other questions?\u2019\u201cUm\u2026\u2026 Can I ask you a question that has nothing to do with the job? It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to answer.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What is it?\u201d\u201cCan you tell me how you gathered this information? I\u2019m just curious about the system.\u201d\u201cWhy? Is there something you want to investigate?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m just asking because I\u2019m really curious. It\u2019s like magic, knowing a lot of information.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that great. That\u2019s why I am getting a 5% commission more than other brokers.\u201d\u201cStill, It\u2019s amazing.\u201dForrest looked at Oliver for a moment and then opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026..Okay, fine. I\u2019ll tell you since you are taking a job that doesn\u2019t fit your bill. But, there is a condition, I\u2019ll tell you when you come back from the job safely.\u201d\u201cUm, that\u2019s great. Very good. Then, I\u2019ll be back as soon as possible after finishing the job.\u201dWith that, Oliver got up from his seat, left the restaurant, and caught a taxi.And\u2026The time had stopped and Oliver returned to reality.\u201cSir, we have arrived at the entrance of District X. I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t go any further than this.\u201dOliver put the documents back and took the money out of his pocket.\u201cNo. Thank you for driving me all the way here.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2026. Huh? You gave me a lot of money, Sir.\u201d\u201cI added a little more to thank you for taking me to this dangerous place. If it\u2019s okay with you, can I ask you something?\u201d\u201cPlease? What is it\u2026?\u201d\u201cCan you come here around 9 a.m. tomorrow? Then, I\u2019ll give double this amount on the return trip.\u201d\u201cDouble?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s not easy to get a taxi here. Oh, of course, if it\u2019s troublesome then you can refuse.\u201dOliver said softly.When Oliver got out of the taxi after talking to the taxi driver, Oliver looked around as he took out the test tube filled with emotions.He was a little afraid the first time, but now he was somewhat used to the place by the second and third time.On the contrary, he was glad to see it again.Oliver walked forward pretending nothing was wrong while extracting the emotions he had contained in his arms.Then, as he passed through a shaded area, he casted the stealth magic [Erase Exit] on him.It was a stealth magic based on shame \u2013 magic that erases one\u2019s presence, and since it had a significant effect in the past, Oliver kept using it.In fact, to some extent, it still worked.As Oliver wandered around using this black magic, no one was able to spot him.That was a good thing, he hadn\u2019t even started his mission yet, and there was nothing good that could come from being noticed.After judging that he came inside the district safely without getting followed, Oliver checked the data given by Forrest again and headed to the magic workshop where Assistant professor Herbert was.It was 20th Street in District X which was not very deep, but it was quite deep for Oliver.Oliver managed to get there after wandering through the maze several times.Probably because of a lot of unauthorized buildings, District X appeared to be different from the map.\u201cUm\u2026.\u201dOliver murmured while looking at Herbert\u2019s magic workshop from afar.White smoke came out from the chimney of the square brick-like house, and it seemed like it was the workshop for producing magic wine.As evidence, several gangsters could be seen roaming around the place.Oliver observed the gangsters.As Forrest said, they seemed to be far from being a threat, at best they were better than the beggars.They were equipped with low-tier equipment and there was no unity among them.Oliver thought of creating many minions and then feeding them with Las bomb to shake the whole place all at once.But, that had chances of hurting the target, so it didn\u2019t seem like the right approach.Other than that, Oliver thought of many other ways. Such as the one, where instead of a powerful Las bomb, he thought of feeding minions with Creepy scream that could break the opponent\u2019s will and then fire at the same time with\u00a0 [Hate bullet], this way the gangster\u2019s will to fight could be broken all at once.He also thought of a much simpler way of just injecting a lot of minions with [Hate bullets] and killing every single gangster with certainty.All these thoughts once again reaffirmed to Oliver that black magic was very interesting.Just by combining a few basic black magic, he thought he could create endless combinations.It was not the mere firepower that made it interesting, it was the infinite possibilities based on those combinations.Suddenly, Oliver remembered the contents of a book he had read in Joseph\u2019s library.Unlike wizard magic, which uses firepower to crush and subdue the enemy, the main weapon of black magic is the ability to see through the enemy and the craftiness that pierces the enemy\u2019s willTherefore, it said that black magic was a more detailed and high-level study than Wizard magic.Oliver, who didn\u2019t know what real magic was, couldn\u2019t judge it easily.\u201cOops\u2026 Once again, I started thinking of something else.\u201dOliver, who came to his senses belatedly, comforted himself and returned to reality.Once assigned, it was important to complete the mission. As Kent emphasized that the mission\u2019s success and credibility were important.Oliver decided to focus on the task ahead of him.So he changed his mind, Oliver sat down and contemplated how he should complete the mission. As if trying to figure out how to solve a problem in the most effective and fun way.The goal was none other than to capture the magic winemaker Herbert safely.Then, the use of black magic with strong firepower should be avoided as much as possible.The target shouldn\u2019t get hurt or killed by any chance.If Oliver made a lot of noise, there are chances of him just running away.The client would be quite upset if Oliver missed him now since they seemed to have gone through a lot to track him down.\u2018\u2026 Um. If I remembered all the emotions out there, maybe it would be a lot easier to find the target later, right?\u2019Oliver focused his attention right away on the Wizard\u2019s workshop and looked at the emotions of everyone around the place.The total number of people was 60.Oliver tried to remember the emotions of not only the gangsters but also the workers who were working inside the workshop.It seemed a bit exaggerated, but since Kent asked him to be very careful, Oliver thought there was nothing wrong with it.Oliver carved the light of emotions into his eyes one by one.After checking all the emotions, he fell into thought again.\u2018How should I take them out?\u2019As Oliver thought before, there were countless ways, but he wanted to try a different method if possible.He wanted it to be a different way from shooting with firepower.It wasn\u2019t because he was suddenly intoxicated with his powers and was trying to do something for fun.It was because of Kent\u2019s advice.He advised performing the tasks in as many ways as possible to increase his adaptability.He said it would be good to make him get to adapt to various types of situation, since there will be times when one have to work in a different way than usual in certain situations, for example, when the use of powerful firepower is limited.That\u2019s why he told Oliver to try working in various ways, at times, when he can afford it.To Oliver, it didn\u2019t sound like a wrong thing. Kent\u2019s words were logical, and the emotions when he spoke showed that his words were sincere without lies.The situation felt as if someone was giving him a chance to give it a try.In the end, on Kent\u2019s advice, Oliver decided to approach the mission in a different way.Oliver came up with a new plan.His new plan needed darkness, so Oliver decided to wait for the night to come.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63As the sun disappeared over the horizon, Oliver secretly spied on the magic workshop by sending a minion who shared the view.The bored gangsters just wandered around, and those who were lazy just drank or played card games.Forrest\u2019s words about the gangsters who had nothing to worry about life came to his mind again.In the middle, there was an old truck that seemed to be loaded with 20 boxes of what was presumed to be magic wine.When Oliver realized the need for money due to the black market, he even wondered how much would a box cost.After a while, when the sun was completely gone and the darkness covered all the area, Oliver came out from the stealth state as he took out the test tube he had in his pocket and extracted the emotions.Then he cast three black magic on himself.[Eraser Exit][Shade Cloak][Sneak Step]A magic that erases one\u2019s presence, a magic that hides one in the dark, and a magic that eliminates the sounds of footsteps.A normal person could be completely deceived by these three combinations.Oliver didn\u2019t stop there, as a precaution he casted [Deep sleep] on his quarterstaff.After getting ready, Oliver began to walk slowly.Along the way, he released the minions again and placed them around the magic workshop.He thought the chances of the target noticing and running away are low, but he still prepared just in case.Oliver slowly approached the workshop while hiding himself in the dark.When he focused a little power on his vision, he could see the emotions of the gangsters that were deployed everywhere.Even though it was not long before the end of the shift, their concentration remained as low as during the day.All they wanted was to go back quickly and satisfy their desires.Thanks to this, Oliver was able to combine the mission and practice with a relatively low burden.Someone walked over to Oliver\u2019s side.Oliver pressed himself close to the wall and controlled his breathing.Moments later, steps drew closer and a gangster appeared.The gangster did not notice Oliver, who was right in front of him, and turned to the opposite direction.Even though the opponent\u2019s concentration was low, it was still a bit strange that someone wasn\u2019t able to sense the person in front of them.Oliver felt that the three combinations of black magic could be more useful than he thought.Oliver maintained his composure as much as possible as he picked up the quarterstaff and slammed it on the back of the gangster.The deep sleep spell applied on the quarterstaff partially entered the gangster\u2019s body, and the gangster fell like a broken doll.Oliver quickly caught the falling gangster.There were still gangsters nearby, so if he even made a small noise then everything could go wrong.Oliver picked up the sleeping gangster and took him to the spot where he stood previously and laid him down.The gangsters didn\u2019t patrol this area well because it was dirty, so if the gangster were to be laid down here, Oliver thought no one would be able to find him.Oliver wondered as he looked at the fallen gangster.The gangster wouldn\u2019t get up until the sun rises, but Oliver thought it might be better to kill him just in case.But killing an opponent that has already been suppressed felt kind of bad to Oliver.It wasn\u2019t a matter of conscience, but it was because of Kent\u2019s words.-Violence and murder are part of this job. But please don\u2019t abuse it and keep them under the right line. This is a personal request.\u201cUm\u2026\u201dOliver groaned and pondered over where the right line was.At that time, he had no idea, so he just nodded, but now that he thought about it there seems to be a problem.If he had known this would be the case, he\u2019d have asked about the right line in detail.Of course, there was also the option of completely ignoring Kent\u2019s words, but Oliver didn\u2019t want to do that.To ignore Kent\u2019s request\u2026 he felt a little uncomfortable.So Oliver came up with a rather neutral solution.It was extracting the Life-force from the fallen gangster, which makes it less possible for him to wake up early and there was also the possibility of him never waking up.Even if he woke up, he would not be able to move properly for a while due to his lack of energy.In other words, it could be said that the gangster couldn\u2019t get in the way of Oliver.It was a pretty good idea.A great solution to both safety and the request of Kent.And he could get free Life-force.In one stroke Oliver accomplished three goals.Oliver moved again after filling an empty test tube with Life-force.The patrolling gangsters usually moved only in one to two, and they patrolled at their will without any fixed path, so it was perfect for taking them down one by one.Oliver secretly moved around while hiding himself in the dark and whenever a gangster passed by, he pounded on them with his quarterstaff and put them to sleep one by one as he had done before.After that, he laid them down in a deserted place and extracted some of their Life-force.Thanks to this, Oliver was able to fill the test tube with Life-force.\u201cUm\u2026 Maybe I can use this way to acquire Life-force or emotion if I ran out in the future. It\u2019s not bad.\u201dOliver leisurely thought as he got rid of the gangsters one by one, who was patrolling the area, but that leisure did not last long.As the patrolling gangsters disappeared within a short period of time, the others began to notice something strange.\u201cHey, where did all the bastards that went out on patrol go?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why the fu*k are you freaking out on me!\u201d\u201cNo, because you\u2019re the only one here\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh, the only one? Something seems wrong. Fu*k, everyone who was patrolling over here is gone.\u201d\u201cDamn them really\u2026 what the heck?\u201dOliver groaned inwardly.\u2018Stupid\u2026\u2019The new method of subduing enemies was so interesting, and he also got free Life-force, so he let his guard down.He should have knocked everyone down as quickly as possible, but he was so distracted which made the enemies notice something was wrong.It wasn\u2019t a big deal, but still, Oliver felt a small regret that he couldn\u2019t achieve his goal.\u2018No. No.\u2019Oliver shook his head and reorganized his thoughts.He remembered what Kent said,-Don\u2019t fall into despair even if you fail on a mission. In the first place, nothing in this field goes according to one\u2019s will.Kent said that it was common for clients to cheat, colleagues to make mistakes, and things to go wrong because they are unlucky.In this case, Oliver made a mistake, and even if things were to go wrong, the priority was to correct them without getting caught.Therefore, Oliver focused his attention on his eyes to see whether the target escaped or not, and also to find out the location of the other gangsters.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..uh?\u201dOliver groaned as he looked at the wall, behind which he was hiding.Something approached him quickly, it broke the wall and came out to attack.BAMFortunately, Oliver quickly deployed the black shield to avoid a direct hit, but he was pushed back and flew back.And that wasn\u2019t the end.[Hat Bullet]\u00d712Twelve bullets of hate flew swiftly out of the dust and came straight towards Oliver breaking the wall.BANG BANG BANG.Oliver spread the Black Shield with his quarterstaff as he landed on the floor.The bullets of hate simultaneously hit the black shield and the shield shook.Fortunately, Oliver\u2019s skill was a bit higher, so the shield did not break.\u201cOkay! I think this guy is firearm-type! Push it!\u201dAt those words, something came out of the dust.It was a monster with chains tied around its neck and had a very huge body, but when Oliver looked up at its face, it was a face that he knew.It was the third person in the picture that Forrest showed him.Fighter Crew\u2019s mutated Bigjaw.He was much larger and more muscular than what Oliver saw in the picture, and the most overwhelming part of him was his deformed big jaw and his sharp fangs.He looked more like a beast than a human, it seemed like it would be over with one bite.\u201cBite him! Bigjaw! Bite him!\u201dWarlock Nico, who sat on top of Bigjaw, shouted.Oliver contemplated on whether to avoid it or not.It would be too close if he tried to avoid the attack with his athletic ability.Even if he dodged it, the Warlock on the top of Bigjaw would attack, so instead of avoiding Oliver chose the other option.He swung his quarterstaff in the air and casted a deep sleep spell on it.\u201c\u2026..!\u201d\u201cUhhhhh?\u201dTrue to the name of an organization that specializes in combat, Nico reacted quickly and jumped off from Bigjaw.Thanks to that he managed to avoid Oliver\u2019s attack, and the only one who fell into a deep sleep was Bigjaw, but from Oliver\u2019s point of view, that was more than enough.It was enough for him to remove the aggressive warlock that stood in front of him.A third voice was heard when Oliver was about to end the battle by concentrating his firepower on Warlock Nico.\u201cThere he is!\u201d\u201cShoot! Grind!\u201dTA-DAAADADDADADADADA!Suddenly, the gangsters broke in and fired at Oliver.Oliver hurriedly opened the Black Shield and fired Hat Bullet to counterattack.\u201cAhh!\u201d,\u201cHide! Hide!\u201dThe gangsters immediately dispersed. Then suddenly Hate bullets rushed toward Oliver from the side.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dTo stop the incoming attack, Oliver once again unfolded the black shield, then, the dispersed gangsters regrouped and started firing tenaciously once again.It was a clumsy cooperation, but it was quite annoying, and on the other hand, Oliver felt it was interesting.The gangsters were not a threat, but when they worked together with a warlock, it was annoying.It reminded him of the fight he had with the dolls in the past.Oliver thought maybe he should try this later.At that moment.SHA SHA SHHHH \u1173!Something jumped out of the gangsters and approached Oliver.Ignoring the pouring bullets and the bullets of hate, he drew close and then swung his fists fiercely.BANG!Oliver saw the Black Shield that was cracked with just one punch.\u201cOh\u2026 you\u2019re pretty strong, aren\u2019t you?\u201dBoom\u2014\u2014! Boom\u2014\u2014! Boom\u2014\u2014!The one who quickly approached was the Knuckle Joe.Just like how Forrest described, he constantly swung his knuckle fists after they had been doped with black magic.As if to acknowledge his skill, the guns and bullets of hate that were fired from a distance stopped, and as if responding to this, Knuckle Joe swung his fists in succession with the intention of killing Oliver.In the end, the black shield got broken by the rapid fist attack.It seemed that the shield was weak against melee attacks.Or maybe because melee attacks are generally more powerful than ranged attacks.Oliver instinctively leaned back. Then, something suddenly grabbed him.\u201cDon\u2019t miss it.\u201dKnuckle Joe said, raising his eyes.Looking into his eyes, Oliver understood that he seemed to have killed a lot of people.\u201cMinion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s words, the minion that was hidden in his arms came out and opened its mouth.It vomited a shockwave.[Thrust], a black magic that pushes and destroys enemies.Knuckle Joe was not hit hard but was blown away by the shock wave, and the gangsters were also indirectly damaged.Nico immediately fired a Hate Bullet to attack Oliver, but luckily Oliver was faster this time.[Lasbomb]x5He detonated a bomb of rage, which filled the area with dust.\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cWhere is he?!\u201d\u201cDamn it, we missed that fu*ker!\u201dOliver had a lot of thoughts as he ran.Even though he had experienced it in the battle with Puppeteer, the idea that warlocks fight in many different forms enthralled him.He was taken aback, but it was a pretty enjoyable experience.Oliver understood the meaning behind the words of Kent asking him to try different fighting methods felt.Perhaps, if Knuckle Joe, Nico, and the Bigjaw had been a little more talented, Oliver might have been taken down without being able to perform at his best.Oliver could think of many scenarios, like when, as soon as the Bigjaw came out, if he had bitten him right away, it would be a game over. A similar thing could have happened if Nico pierced the shield with a powerful firearm-based black magic at once,Or if Knuckle Joe pierced the shield with a single punch.Oliver felt he was lucky, and he felt the need to learn different styles of fighting.It seemed like an essential element to survive in this field, which was necessary to reach his goal of entering the black market.Oliver stopped running, turned his head in the direction he had run from, and looked back.In the middle of the night, with the dust all over the place, everyone was confused and couldn\u2019t chase after him quickly.Oliver took out two test tubes.One was a test tube filled with emotion and the other with Life-force.He pulled out both so that he can use them right away.Once again feeling lucky, Oliver casted\u2026[Black suit ver.2]Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64[Black Suit Ver.2]With Oliver\u2019s chant, the emotions and Life-force contained in each test tube were extracted like strands and began to be entangled into one thick thread.Emotions and Life-force bound together.Oliver has thought about it a few times, but this was the first time he actually made it, and the backlash from combining emotions and Life-force was less than he thought.It rather mixed well when it was combined into one.Maybe it was normal.According to what Oliver saw in the book, Life-force and emotions were, after all, something derived from the soul.Surprisingly, no one paid any attention to this fact, and the same was true for Oliver until now.Oliver felt something more than pleasure.Whether intentionally or unintentionally, Oliver learned something new from this situation.For some reason, Oliver thought it was a good choice to become a Solver.And for that, he felt grateful to paladin Joanna\u2019s advice.He was able to come out to the world and meet someone like Kent thanks to her advice.He somehow felt happy.Oliver surrounded his entire body with a combination of emotions and Life-force.They covered his body like wearing clothes or a coat.An intricate entanglement of emotions and Life-force protected not only Oliver\u2019s whole body but also his quarterstaff.Oliver threw the empty test tube on the road and then took out a new one from his pocket.Oliver tried to work as a Solver while using as minimum emotions as possible.But now, he decided to put aside that thought aside for a while as he wanted to test a new black magic.He wanted to know how far will this new black magic will work on a warlock like Knuckle Joe.Knuckle Joe seemed like a disease-based warlock similar to the Dominic family, but the application of power was different, so Oliver wanted to check it out.Oliver opened the lid of the test tube.And then he casted black magic on him\u2026 no, he casted black magic on the black suit.[Burning Life], which strengthens the whole body by burning Life-force, [Muscle-up], which uses Life-force to increase muscle strength, and [Endurance Skin], which uses the emotion of patience to make the skin tough and firm.Three magic spells.It felt different from when he used it himself.Oliver, who lacks expressiveness, felt something that he felt difficult to explain, there was a difference between touching the skin directly and touching it through the clothes.From Oliver\u2019s point of view, this was much better.It felt a little awkward and compared to when he casted the spells on his body, there were no side effects.Oliver learned new facts and felt a little bit of joy and satisfaction from the fact that he created a new black magic.\u201cHe\u2019s here! Motherfu*ker is there!\u201d\u201cEveryone this way!\u201dWith an urgent cry, many gangsters came rushing in the direction where Oliver was.Oliver suppressed the satisfaction he had felt before and decided to focus this time.Oliver knew luck won\u2019t come in succession.Oliver focused his powers on his eyes and looked at the gangsters that came running toward him.Among the gangsters, he spotted Knuckle Joe, who approached while mixing with the crowd, and beyond the crowd, he also saw Bigjaw and Nico coming toward him.\u201cUm, first\u2026\u201dOliver kept the warlock\u2019s vision and casted a targeting spell on the gangsters and Knuckle Joe coming in front.It was much easier to cast with the Warlock\u2019s vision since his eyesight doesn\u2019t get limited by obstacles such as walls.Oliver threw black darts into the air according to the number of people.Black blades scattered in the air like petals.Then, as if attracted to a magnet, they flew towards their target, and not long after, screams could be heard all over the place.A few quick-witted gangsters caught up with Oliver and fired, but after a few shots, they were struck by the dart thrown by Oliver and died.\u201cFu*k!\u201d\u201cShoot, shoot that goddamn motherfu*ker!\u201d\u201cIt hurts\u2026! What is the fu*k is this-!\u201dGangsters kept falling one after another.The flames from the muzzle fired from their guns lit up the surroundings, revealing the surroundings like an afterimage.Then Oliver looked.While hiding in the dark with the gangsters and looking for an opportunity, Knuckle Joe quickly narrowed the distance.He hid behind the gangsters and hid his presence, while smashing the flying black darts, and then using his leg, which was strengthened using black magic, he narrowed the distance at a single leap.Everything happened in a split second, but in the eyes of Oliver, which could see the emotions, everything was clearly visible.\u201cYou should have run away when you had the chance.\u201dIn an instant, Knuckle Joe grabbed Oliver and said.Then, he swung his fist with great force toward Oliver.BANG!!!Along with the loud noise, a heavy silence filled the space, just like the artificial silence that comes after a person dies.After a few eternity-like seconds, Knuckle Joe said in a low voice.\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201dHis voice was small, but he was agitated.His fist, strengthened with black magic was blocked by a weak-looking warlock.And it was not stopped by black magic like Black Shield, but with an old quarterstaff.\u201cNo\u2026do you know how to use disease-based black magic?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOliver pushed away Joe\u2019s arm with an answer and wielded the quarterstaff as he learned from Cant.Joe raised his defense with black magic and blocked Oliver\u2019s attack head-on.Rather than trying to avoid it, it seemed like he was trying to confirm something.TING! Tak\u2014\u2014! Bang!!There was the sound of iron and iron clashing.It was a hard blow, but Joe blocked Oliver\u2019s quarterstaff perfectly.Although, he could not withstand the shock and flew far back.\u201c\u2026\u2026!!!\u201dJoe, who was blown away and fell, got up immediately and looked at Oliver.He felt emotions of embarrassment and confusion, which eventually burned as firewood of intense emotions such as anger and hostility.\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s Dave.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.?What?\u201d\u201cDave. Didn\u2019t you ask before, who I was?\u201dIt was the time when he was surprised that his attack was blocked, and Joe made an absurd expression on his face. As if, this was the first time someone has mocked him like this in his life.\u201c\u2026are you kidding me now?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 did I say something wrong? I\u2019m sorry. I just thought it would be good to answer your question since I had some questions for you.\u201d\u201cQuestions\u2026.?\u201d\u201cYes, I wanted to know\u2026 Ah\u2026\u201dBefore asking the question, Oliver turned his head toward the nearby wall and took a defensive stance.Then the wall broke and someone jumped out.It was Bigjaw and Nico, who was on top of Bigjaw.\u201cYou barely woke up with an awake spell\u2026! Bigjaw! Tear down that sh*t!!\u201d\u201cWooooooooooooooo\u2014!\u201dBang! Bang!Bigjaw pushed Oliver with a stronger force than before.Bigjaw grabbed both shoulders of Oliver and pushed him against the wall, his strength was so powerful that he smashed two walls.If Oliver hadn\u2019t wrapped his body in a black suit reinforced with [Endurance skin], his bones would have been shattered.Standing on the back of Bigjaw, Nico was surprised to see Oliver in good shape.\u201cWhat the fu*k is this bastard\u2026why is he fine after taking that!\u201dA cry filled with questions.Joe shouted and answered.\u201cHe can even use disease-based black magic! More powerful! Way better than me!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dNico looked at Oliver with his eyes wide open, genuinely surprised.Oliver was still caught in the hands of Bigjaw.Even though Oliver indirectly strengthened his strength through [Muscle-up], the difference in basic strength was so great that he could not get out.\u2018I\u2019m running out of Life-force\u2026. How many more minutes?\u2019Oliver had to end the battle quickly.\u201cDamn\u2026.Bigjaw! Bite and chew that bastard\u2019s head!\u201dWhile shouting at Bigjaw, Nico extracted the emotions and casted black magic on Bigjaw.After receiving the instructions and black magic, Bigjaw opened his mouth wide. Enough to swallow Oliver\u2019s whole head in one bite.\u201cAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201dJust as Bigjaw was about to bite Oliver, Oliver desperately resisted and thrust his arm into the jaw of Bigjaw.At the unexpected resistance, Bigjaw groaned!\u201cThat fu*king bastard resisted\u2026 Bigjaw! Chew that little arm first!\u201dAt the instructions of the warlock on his back, Bigjaw bit Oliver\u2019s arm.It wasn\u2019t cut right away because the whole body was covered with a black suit but Oliver could feel the durability gradually dropping.Perhaps, if he stayed still like this, his arm would be cut off.If he stayed still.[Las Bomb]Oliver exploded the emotions in his hands.With that, the head of Bigjaw exploded, and the body that had pushed Oliver lost its strength in an instant and collapsed.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dJoe and Nico were surprised again.In particular, Nico, who was riding on the top of Bigjaw, seemed to have received a stronger shock, so he panicked and widened the distance, but Oliver did not allow it as he immediately narrowed the distance.\u201cHow\u2026!?\u201d\u201cI strengthened with Burning Life.\u201dOliver swung the quarterstaff with those words.As soon as he was about to slap Nico\u2019s body, Joe intervened in the middle.He became a shield and protected Nico.\u201cNICO, Keep your distance and support me!\u201dWith those words, Joe engaged in close combat with Oliver.Perhaps he judged that a fight with firepower would not be in his favor, so while maintaining a distance favorable to him as much as possible, he swung his knuckled fists and attacked Oliver.At the anomalous and fierce attack, Oliver was unable to block everything and allowed most attacks.After all, in simple melee combat, Joe was better than Oliver.Every time the attack touched Oliver\u2019s body, a squeaky sound echoed through the air.Even though he didn\u2019t take any damage from the hits because of the black suit, Oliver could sense through the impact he felt that a single punch would break all his bones.Black suit\u2019s defense was not infinite, so Oliver hurriedly swung his quarterstaff to counterattack.\u201cYou\u2019re good at black magic, but you\u2019re a beginner at close combat, aren\u2019t you?\u201dJoe lightly dodged Oliver\u2019s attack and then fired the counter.BANG!Oliver didn\u2019t fall, but the shock made him stagger.At that moment, Joe grabbed Oliver\u2019s collar again, as if he wasn\u2019t going to let go this time.\u201cNico!\u201d\u201cOkay! Muscle Up!\u201dNico supported Joe with black magic.Joe concentrated his energy on his fist, which made his fist glow in dark red.\u201cIf you do that, your fist might break, right?\u201d\u201cShut up\u2026 Did you think that I came to this field without such determination?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThis is the end of the road for you.\u201dWith those words, Joe swung his fists as hard as he could.There must have been a huge sound that shattered everything, but that didn\u2019t happen.\u201cWHAT?\u201dJoe screamed in confusion.It was a natural reaction when suddenly something pulled one backward.He didn\u2019t know what was happening, so he looked behind his back, there he saw Nico flying backward, just like him.To be exact, he wasn\u2019t exactly flying, he was being pulled by something.\u201c\u2026Dartboard?\u201dJo said while looking at the black dartboard on Nico\u2019s body.\u201cYes, it\u2019s called [Targeting], to be precise. Mixing emotions of obsessions and make them attract each other.\u201dWhile hearing Oliver\u2019s answer, Joe and Nico collided in the air.Oliver, who followed them closely, swung the quarterstaff as hard as he could at them, who were defenseless.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is the end of my road.\u201dOliver said while gathering the energy of the black suit to the quarterstaff.Quarterstaff wielded by Oliver smashed Joe and Nico.Both of them couldn\u2019t withstand the shock, flew to one wall, and crashed straight into it.A huge crack appeared on the wall as if to represent the shock.Joe managed to strengthen his body with black magic, but Nico\u2019s body broke like a doll.All of the fighter crew members were down.Oliver, who was the only one standing approached Joe, who asked the same question he asked before.\u201cUghhhh\u2026 Ugh\u2026 Who the hell.. are you\u2026\u201dJoe asked, breathing heavily. His eyes were unfocused.\u201c\u2026 Dave.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026Kill me.\u201dJoe said with determination.\u201cUm\u2026\u201dOliver contemplated whether to kill him or not.He recalled Kent\u2019s advice of asking him not to kill anyone without thinking twice.Kent also advised him to kill the strong enemy without sympathy, saying clumsy sympathy and carelessness might result in death.When Oliver thought about it, some of Kent\u2019s teachings were very contradictory.In the end, the decision was entirely up to Oliver.After thinking for a while, Oliver extracted the emotions and enchanted his quarterstaff with black magic.Then he brought the quarterstaff to Joe.[Deep Sleep]Knuckle Joe fell asleep as if fainting.Oliver thought, maybe if he ran out of energy, he might not be able to get up forever, but if he had the will and stamina, he would survive.Thanks to the Fighter crew, he did a good experiment, and there was a small question he wanted to ask, but he thought this was enough for today.After making up his mind, Oliver started moving again.Towards the target, Assistant Professor Herbert.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65BAM-BAM-BAM.Oliver used the quarterstaff to knock out the enemies and headed towards the Wizard\u2019s workshop, where Assistant Professor Herbert was.It wasn\u2019t too far away, and along the way, he could see the traces of the gangsters who were knocked down by black darts or who managed to escape with their lives.Perhaps because of that, when he focused the energy on his eyes, he could no longer see any gangsters.In addition to those who were spying on him, the number of people wandering around has decreased sharply.He could see a mixture of emotions such as curiosity, interest, and a little bit of fear from one or two people, but he decided not to care about it.There were a lot of people in District X who used to spy on others like this.Kent said there was no end to people who spy on each other, so he told Oliver not to worry about them unless it affects his safety.On the contrary, Kent said that it might help to increase his fame depending on how he used the situation.Oliver touched his face, just in case. To be more precise, the black magic item [Mask] that he wore over his face.Fortunately, there were no torn or broken places.After checking, Oliver left the spies and went forward.As long as he walk around with this face, he thought there was a hole through which he can escape even in case he messes up things, so Oliver decided to gain as much experience as possible.While thinking so, Oliver arrived at the wizard\u2019s abode.\u201cUm\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dOliver looked around the four buildings that were used as workshops.There were eight, eight, six, and nine people in each building, and all of them were not in a rational state because they exuded emotions such as extreme fear, and confusion.The most noticeable of them were those in the largest workshop, where there were a total of nine people, one of them seems to be in a different emotional state than the others.As with everyone else, that person also seem to be confused by the sudden situation, but that didn\u2019t mean that person was in a panic.He had the courage, as he rolled his head while hoping to somehow get out of the current situation.Oliver also saw a glimmer of blue light within him, and that blue light was neither emotion nor Life-force.It was similar to those two and also different, and Oliver felt that he had seen that light somewhere.\u2018When was that\u2026 Ah! Lightning Wizard.\u2019Oliver immediately recognized that the light was magic.\u201cThen is that person a Wizard?\u201dOliver went straight inside as soon as he saw the target.He went straight into the workshop at once because he did not see any hostile person.As soon as he entered, he could smell the dry dust and sour alcohol at the same time.In addition, there were complex pipes connected along the ceiling, multi-purpose water tanks, and distillers could also be seen.Potatoes and corn were piled up on one side of the wall, and the undiluted liquid potions were filled in a box.While observing the surroundings slowly, Oliver found two people, one hiding under a desk and the other behind equipment.\u201cI know you are there. Come out.\u201dSilence returned as the answer. Silence and fear, to be precise.\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you, so please come out.\u201dThis time, perhaps persuaded, one person slowly came out with both hands raised.He wore a dirty work uniform and a hat, and he seemed to be a normal worker because he had no will to fight.\u201cUhh\u2026 I, please\u2026don\u2019t kill me\u201d\u201cYou may go.\u201dOliver said politely while pointing towards the door.Instead of feeling relieved, he felt confused and ran out like being chased by a monster.\u201cAh\u2026.!!??\u201d\u201c\u2026 How about you?\u201dThen the other worker, who was watching the situation, slowly came out and looked at him before running away while screaming just like the first person who had left.Oliver couldn\u2019t figure out why, but he somehow was able to sort out his plans.Oliver looked around and headed deep inside the workshop where the wizard was.He arrived at a narrow and messy office after passing through boxes containing distillation liquids, various machines, and red fluorescent liquor that were piled up on one side of the wall.Oliver reflexively looked around the empty office.From the opened huge window the cold outside air came in, and the wind cluttered the books and documents on top of the desk.Not only that but the safe inside the office was left half open with a little bit of cash.If any normal person had seen this place, they would have thought that someone had stolen the money and run away.But, Oliver wasn\u2019t that stupid.Given the circumstances, that was a reasonable inference.Perhaps, if Oliver hadn\u2019t had the warlock\u2019s vision, his thoughts would have steered that way too.\u2018That\u2019s interesting.\u2019Oliver thought to himself and then blinked to change from his normal vision to the warlock\u2019s vision to take a look at Assistant Professor Herbert, who was hiding in a corner of the office while holding his breath.He could not be seen in the normal human\u2019s vision, but he could be seen in the warlock\u2019s vision.Perhaps because he casted a magic that hides one\u2019s presence like the [Shade cloak], and the performance itself seemed much better.Shade Cloak needed absolute darkness to work, whereas the magic that Assistant Professor Herbert used didn\u2019t seem to have such restrictions.But, it was not perfect either.His emotions and Life-force, along with his magical powers, were noticeably diminishing in real-time.Probably, it was to maintain the invisibility magic.Whether it was because of his lack of magical power, or whether his magic spell consumed a lot of magic, it seemed as if he would soon lose his magic powers and lose his invisibility.So as time passes Assistant professor\u2019s tension and fear grew, and Oliver walked towards the safe after thinking for a while.TAK TAK TAK.Every time the quarterstaff touched the ground, a sound rang out.Oliver crouched down and looked at the money in the safe.There was quite a bit of cash in it, and to be honest, it wasn\u2019t like Oliver wasn\u2019t interested in it.Even though he didn\u2019t know exactly how much money was there, Oliver will be needing a lot of cash in the future, so he thought the more money, the better.However, what Oliver found more interesting than the money was the reaction of Professor Herbert, who watched the situation behind his back.There was also a way to put him in deep sleep with quarterstaff, but Oliver was looking at him for a reason that even he could not explain himself.As if he was expecting something.Oliver asked himself.Was it because he was the first wizard he had met since the Lightning Wizard?Or was it might be because he expected that he would show the beautiful light that the Lightning Wizard had shown him?Oliver observed the Assistant professor with expectations that he himself could not explain.As if to answer Oliver\u2019s curiosity, Assistant Professor Herbert showed many emotions that changed from greed to fear, fear to courage, wisdom, and anger as soon he came to a decision.He was a professor, so he didn\u2019t seem to have any experience in fighting.Herbert moved carefully, but the sound of footsteps could not be hidden at all.Oliver wondered whether there was no spell in magic to cancel the sound of footsteps like the one he was using now.As he was thinking about it, Assistant Professor Herbert came all the way behind Oliver.Oliver waited nervously expecting what kind of attack the Assistant professor would make, a person who was said to be from the Magic tower, and after a while, an unbelievable sound was heard.TRRR-BAM!As soon as Oliver heard the sound of a gun being loaded, he turned around and knocked Assistant Professor Herbert with the quarterstaff he was holding.He didn\u2019t hit too hard, but the deep sleep spell he had cast on the quarterstaff made him instantly knockdown, and Oliver\u2019s interest quickly cooled down the moment he saw him.It wasn\u2019t what he expected\u2026 He expected something different from him because he was from the Magic Tower.Oliver thought he would put up a good show.Oliver went back to work soon, after making sure that the target was not hit too hard.First, he used the gluttonous bag to collect all the money stored in the safe, then he packed the documents and scattered books that looked important, although it was not ordered by anyone.Then, Oliver took the undiluted potion he had seen on the way. The potion was filled in a round pot and had a red seal stamped on it.\u201cUh\u2026 are there no gluttonous bag?\u201dOliver muttered as he put two or three potions into his arms as if he had no choice.He wanted to take more, but it was cumbersome and difficult to bring back, and while he was looking to see if there was anything more he could bring, a signal came from the minions scattered around the place in advance.Oliver closed one eye and shared the field of view with his minion.Some people showed up, and it felt like they were warlocks.It seemed like there was not any particular hostility, but he decided that there would be nothing good about staying here any longer than this, so he decided to move.Oliver approached the fallen Assistant Professor Herbert and immediately cast [Obedience], a black magic that governs and controls the minds of zombies, animals, or living beings that were brought back to life. He picked up the hat that had fallen on the floor, put it on him, and left Wizard\u2019s workshop.Then, he walked in the opposite direction of the strangers.He still kept his eyes on them just in case of any possible attack, but luckily they only took the fallen Knuckle Joe.When he looked at their emotions, rather than feeling anger at the situation, they showed only interest and pleasure in seizing the opportunity.Oliver continued to observe them as he moved forward, and the next day when the sun came up, he came to the entrance of District X.Fortunately, the situation he feared did not happen.BEEP! BEEP!A loud horn sound was heard.When Oliver looked in the direction of the sound, the taxi driver who had brought him here yesterday was looking this way with the window down.He said with an awkward expression on his face, narrowing his brow slightly.\u201cI came as promised. By the way, it seems like you\u2019ve had a very busy day?\u201dIt was only then that Oliver realized that he had been covered in dust.\u201cAh, yes. I had a bit of a noisy and fun night. Thank you for coming.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m here because you said you\u2019d double the money\u2026 Get in the car. Is he your friend?\u201dOliver looked at Herbert.\u201cAh, yes\u2026 that\u2019s right, he is my friend.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s Mr. Herbert, Boss.\u201dAl said after confirming the identity of Herbert, who had been manipulated by Oliver.Al didn\u2019t just stop after checking his face, he also checked his fingerprints, drew blood, and even tried putting the blood in some small device.\u201cIt\u2019s an identification method based on blood magic. It\u2019s the latest technology. Faces and fingerprints can be changed, but blood can\u2019t be changed.\u201d\u201cBlood magic?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a new school from the School of Life Magic. It\u2019s understandable if you are unfamiliar with it since it\u2019s only recently that the new division was formed. The official birth of this division is about 12 years ago, and it has been only 2 or 3 years since it had made a name for itself.\u201dForrest was usually kind, but he seems to have become a lot kinder now.Even before Oliver asked the question, he explained the reason with his own mouth.\u201cBy the way, you\u2019re really great. I thought you were amazing during the chimera job, but I didn\u2019t expect you would succeed in this job in a day.\u201d\u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not praising you, I\u2019m speaking the truth. Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong. I never wanted you to fail. It\u2019s truly amazing.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cOf course, Fighter Crew is a new organization, but it is an organization that has already proved its skills. Not only non-affiliated gangsters, but also some members of the Crime Firm do business with them. You took down three of them, not one. That itself is a great deal.\u201dOliver nodded silently. He didn\u2019t know how strong he was, but he admitted that they were really strong.Oliver wasn\u2019t seriously injured, but it wasn\u2019t an overwhelming victory either.Rather, there was a slight difference.If they had understood black magic better and hit at the right areas from the beginning, it might have been Oliver who ended up losing.Kent\u2019s words that carelessness leads to death came to his mind again.\u201cThanks to you, the client is also very happy. I thought that it would be a risk to entrust the task for the small money, but I never imagined it would be completed so easily.\u201d\u201cYou seem happy.\u201d\u201cOf course, since you finished the job successfully.\u201d\u201c\u2026 If you don\u2019t mind, may I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cAsk for anything. Ah, I also have a gift for you.\u201d\u201cA gift?\u201d\u201cOkay, before I tell you about the gift, let me ask you a question. How many emotion test tubes do you have with you? I don\u2019t think there would be many.\u201dForrest was half right.The emotions that he had before leaving the Joseph family were already half exhausted.He used it sparingly, but it was natural because he kept using it since he had been a beggar, and he used way more emotions than he thought during this job, and he also used the emotions that he took from Puppeteer Gylph, so Oliver had the half the reserves he had when he came out of Wineham.Oliver answered after a lot of thought. It was the answer Forrest wanted.\u201cI have about half left of what I had.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to make up for it.\u201d\u201cYes, but I\u2019m a little confused. It was written in the contract not to extract emotions, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. To be precise, from the general public. Neither I nor our union can protect you if you do that.\u201d\u201cSo I was thinking about extracting the emotions of the enemies during the mission.\u201d\u201cDuring a fight\u2026? That\u2019s great. But, a small miss, you will either die or get hurt.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I want to know why you are talking about this.\u201d\u201cI would like to introduce you to a place.\u201d\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cGray Market.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66\u201cGray market?\u201d\u201cYeah. Do you remember the last time when you asked whether I know about the black market?\u201dForrest poured the wine and handed one to Oliver, and asked.\u201cYes\u2026 you said you knew something similar.\u201d\u201cYou have a good memory. The Gray market is very similar to the Black market. Technically, it\u2019s more like a side branch of the black market than being something similar.\u201d\u201cA side branch?\u201cYes, I understand that you don\u2019t know about them, because they came into existence recently. It\u2019s a kind of sales strategy for low-grade products.\u201dForrest went on with his explanation. From the way he spoke, he seemed to know a lot about the Gray market.\u201cA gray market is a place that sells small or low-grade goods among the items distributed in the black market.\u201dAfter thinking for a while, Oliver took a sip of the drink that Forrest gave him and then asked.\u201c\u2026What kind of low-grade items are you talking about?\u201d\u201cSmall items like low-tier information, drugs, moonshine liquor, magic items, human emotions, and Life-force, and even sometimes black magic books.\u201dOliver was intrigued at that moment.\u201cBlack magic books?\u201d\u201cYes, but it won\u2019t be that great. It might be just some basic books.\u201dForrest said in a passive tone, but Oliver did not care about it.He was rather excited.Even if he did not get a satisfactory result right away, he thought he could take the first step toward his goal.It felt like a clue to the puzzles in his head, and Oliver felt great pleasure in this process of solving the puzzle by taking one step at a time.\u201c\u2026are you okay?\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh, yes\u2026 Then, are there places that handle high-grade items?\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s divided into black markets and gray markets just for convenience, but on the inside, they are subdivided into invisible grades. There are definitely places that handle higher-grade items. The problem is, it\u2019s not easy to find. Security is tighter.\u201d\u201cHow can I gain access to the higher-rated market?\u201d\u201cYou have to spend a lot of money to get an invitation, or you have to befriend a tycoon who has ties with the black market. For example, a person involved with Crime Firm. They are the people most certain to get access.\u201d\u201cIs it because Crime Firm is the one that\u2019s managing the black market?Forrest paused for a moment at Oliver\u2019s question.\u201c\u2026 You are half right and half wrong.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt is true that Crime Firm is deeply related to the black market, but they do not manage all of them. The black market is more abstract and complex. It\u2019s not controlled by a single entity, but a cluster, so it\u2019s not easy to understand all about the black market\u2026 It\u2019s dangerous.\u201dOliver examined Forrest\u2019s emotions.He didn\u2019t know whether the story itself was true or not, but Forrest\u2019s emotions were sincere.It was unexpected.He knew a lot more than Oliver thought, even though he said he didn\u2019t know anything when Oliver first asked about the black market.\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cYes, anyway, let\u2019s get back to the point. The place I\u2019ll introduce won\u2019t be a bad place for your first time. The quality of the products may be a little inferior, but it\u2019s not too dangerous. You can also replenish the emotions.\u201dWith those words, Forrest gave a note with a rough map along with a strange business card.The \u2018F\u2019 sign of Forrest was drawn on the business card.\u201cThis is a map with the location and an entry ticket. Use the map once and burn it. If it leaks, you may lose your credibility.\u201dOliver nodded and put the note and business card into his pocket.\u201cThank you for the gift.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I introduced you to the gray market because you handled the job well. So, I hope you like it.\u201d\u201cYeah, I like it very much\u2026 Then, may I speak this time?\u201d\u201cOh, yeah, you said you wanted to ask something, right? What is it?\u201d\u201cYou said that you will briefly tell me how Mr. Forrest gathers information when I complete the job and return successfully. So can you tell me now?\u201d\u201cOh, right. I made that promise, didn\u2019t I? Well, all right, it\u2019s not that great anyway.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dBefore speaking, Forrest poured some drink back into his glass and Oliver\u2019s.\u201cUm\u2026there are many ways to get information, and it\u2019s surprisingly easy, very easy.\u201d\u201cOh, is it?\u201d\u201cYou can think of it as a kind of snowball. When you met some conditions to gather information, you roll it. Then the information gathers on its own\u2026 In my case, the condition was being part of the broker\u2019s union.\u201d\u201cAre you from the broker\u2019s union?\u201d\u201cYeah, because of the nature of this job, everyone is interested in the information. The rapidly changing situations, accidents, emergence of new characters, etc. So the brokers of the same union just share information at a certain level.\u201d\u201cSharing?\u201d\u201cOnly certain levels of information, while more confidential, and detailed information is traded between individuals. Money or information is the basic to build connections between people like them.\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026 I see. So, do you get all the information through the broker\u2019s union?\u201d\u201cNo. They\u2019re business partners but at the same time, they are also competitors. If I solely rely on them then I\u2019ll fall behind. Everyone has their own information line. In my case, I use Solvers and information dealers.\u201d\u201cInformation dealers?\u2026 Are you talking about Ms. Coco?\u201d\u201cAh, I guess you two have already met.\u201d\u201cYes, on my way here yesterday.\u201d\u201cShe is one of the information dealers I do business with. If there\u2019s information worth selling, they will come to me, or I\u2019ll go and ask for it.\u201dOliver nodded with interest like a child listening to a fairy tale.\u201cThen\u2026 do you get information only from brokers\u2019 union, solvers, and information dealers?\u201dOliver asked while looking at the Forrest. To be exact, he looked at Forrest\u2019s emotions.\u201c\u2026 No. I don\u2019t use it often, but there is another line.\u201d\u201cUm, where?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an organization called Heimdal.\u201d\u201cHeimdal?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a group of magical hackers dealing with the World Tree.\u201d\u201cWorld Tree\u2026? Magical Hackers\u2026?\u201dAs Oliver asked a new question, Forrest laughed a little.\u201cI don\u2019t know that much about both. Well, no one really knows about them. Even the warlocks in the underworld probably don\u2019t know much about them.\u201d\u201c\u2026can you tell me what you know?\u201dForrest checked his watch.\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but can we do it later? I have an appointment with an important guest.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dOliver exclaimed in regret.He checked his watch, and obviously, quite a bit of time had passed.Even though he was very curious, Oliver still nodded obediently.Having already heard enough interesting information, he thought it was inappropriate to bother anymore.\u201cYes. I understand.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll answer you later when I have time.\u201d\u201cNo. You have helped a lot\u2026ah!\u201dOliver began to search through his pocket as Forrest got ready to leave.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cWait a minute. I have something to give you. I don\u2019t know if it will be of any help to Mr. Forrest.\u201dWith those words, Oliver took out a bottle of potion, books, and documents that he had obtained from the wizard\u2019s workshop.Forest showed interest as he looked at the items.\u201cIs this\u2026?\u201d\u201cI found it at the Wizard\u2019s workshop. I don\u2019t know for sure, but I thought it would be useful.\u201dForrest looked through the books and documents more actively. The emotions of joy and pleasure shone, and among them, there was shock and surprise when he saw the potion.\u201c\u2026 Did you really get this from the workshop?\u201d\u201cYes, I just picked it up because it was there. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s all right.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right\u2026 I thought it was a gift-giving day, but it turned out to be a gift-receiving day.\u201d\u201cI am glad that you liked it.\u201d\u201cThank you very much. Will you come again tomorrow?\u201dAfter thinking for a moment, Oliver shook his head.\u201cNo. Since Mr. Forrest told me about a good place, I think I\u2019ll go there tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOkay then, see you later.\u201dAfter shaking hands with Forrest, Oliver came out of the restaurant.As he stepped out onto the street, he looked at the map that Forrest gave him.The map showed a marketplace in District T.It was a little strange that the Gray market was located in a normal marketplace.But, that was not important for Oliver.The important thing was that he finished the job successfully, and although it wasn\u2019t a black market, he was still able to gain access to the Gray market which was a side branch of the Black market.He wanted to go right away, but he was tired because he had been working all night, so he decided to go to bed tonight.He could not believe that he got a lead already, he was really looking forward to tomorrow.If the expectations were high, the disappointment will also be higher.This was a passage that Oliver read from Joseph\u2019s journal in the past.It was a phrase Joseph wrote when he couldn\u2019t conquer Wineham due to the intervention of the pharmacist and had to share it with the Dominic and Anthony families.At that time, Oliver could only understand the meaning of this phrase, but could not sympathize with it, and right at this moment, he understood how Joseph felt.He was sorry for Forrest, who took the best care of him, but it was just that the Gray Market he introduced to Oliver was a huge disappointment\u2026Or maybe Oliver was expecting too much.His heart raced with anticipation while walking around the busy marketplace in the district, and he gave the business card to the gatekeeper who was disguised as a fruit vendor, but as soon as he walked in, his excitement turned into utter disappointment.The first thing that came to Oliver\u2019s mind was \u2013 it\u2019s way too ordinary.The Gray market, which was secretly installed inside the marketplace, was very similar to the marketplace on the outside.It was just the same thing.A stand with stacked fruits, a butcher\u2019s shop with meat on it, and a wagon parked with strange herbs.No, that was not the big problem.The biggest problem was, the products sold here did not meet Oliver\u2019s expectations.As Forrest said, in the gray market, people who looked like warlocks were selling emotions and Life-force extracted, in small stalls, but the quality of these emotions was very poor.It was as if they were forcibly squeezed out.And it was the same with black magic items like gluttonous bags, leather masks, watcher\u2019s eyes, and energy supplements.Compared to what he saw in the workshop of Joseph Family and Gylph\u2019s workshop, the items here were very crude.He had never made some of these, but he thought he could make better than this if he was asked to make it right now.In a way, it was obvious.What was in this market was at best a trumpet for third-class thieves.Oliver was expecting too much because it was connected to the Black market.In the end, a side branch was just a side branch.Still, Oliver decided to purchase some items for his experience since it was a waste to go back empty-handed like this.He bought one of each of the extracted emotions and Life-force, a leather mask, a gluttonous bag, and a watcher\u2019s eye.Oliver had the same things now, but they were well-made items, so he was afraid to use them for experimentation, so he bought these items for his research.When he thought like that, he felt good in some ways.So, after putting the emotions and black magic items in the bag, Oliver decided to spend the rest of his time exploring the gray market.He found nothing of interest, but he still looked around to familiarize himself in case the next time he visited another gray market or black market.As he went deep inside, he could see something different.There were also places selling old watches, stuffed animals with strange looks, elixir made from the Life-force of animals, cheap Pilgarets, and even books.It was not books about black magic or demons, but it was strange books with pictures of naked women.Anyway, Oliver looked around the gray market and bought more leather belts and cases to store test tubes and left the gray market.Although he frequently got tired after leaving the Joseph family, he was never bored or disappointed.Oliver headed to the accommodation feeling that way.He felt like he was exhausted.Just as Oliver was about to leave he felt something.It was only for a fleeting moment, but he definitely felt something.It was something similar to the Lightning Wizard he had met in the past.It was definitely not an illusion, and when he turned his eyes he saw an old man sitting at the end of the market.\u201cHello, mate. How about reading a book?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67The old man\u2019s appearance was ugly.Of course, Oliver wasn\u2019t the type to care about that, but objectively he was ugly. At least compared to Forrest, who runs a restaurant.An old coat, sunken cheek, an egg-like top on the head, long hair around it.He even reminded him of Kent, and the old man opened his mouth again.\u201cDid you come to see a book, mate\u2026?\u201dAt that moment, Oliver came to his senses and asked.\u201cAh, yes\u2026 What books do you have? Mister.\u201d\u201cHahaha!.\u201dAt that moment the old man burst into laughter.\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve been called Mister\u2026. You have good manners even though you are a young man\u2026. There are many books. Since I was young, I have been collecting books as a hobby. Would you like to take a look?\u201dThe old man pointed toward the little bookstore beside him.It was a small space between his shop and the next shop, and it looked dark, cramped, and dusty.Oliver understood why there were no people even though there were many people in the market.But, fortunately, Oliver didn\u2019t care about that.The dark, cramped, dusty place was already part of his past life.Rather, he was more interested in the books that are tightly packed inside them.Of course, he was also interested in the old man, who radiated a tremendous magical power for a second.So, Oliver nodded his head and entered the store.\u201cThen, can I take a look?\u201d\u201cOf course, mate. Feel free to take a look.\u201dOliver bowed his head in response to the old man\u2019s kind words. Kent said that kindness should be rewarded with kindness.When he entered the narrow bookstore he felt that it was much narrower than it looked from the outside, and it was difficult to even for a single person to pass through.If you are a person with a good physique then you will be suffocating as soon as you entered.However, Oliver focused his attention on the old man while pretending to look at the books.To be honest, there was nothing about the old man that stood out.His emotional state was as common as other merchants, and he did not see the magical powers he had seen in the Lightning Wizard or the magic tools.It was as if the powerful magical power that Oliver had felt before was just a momentary illusion.However, Oliver could assert that it was not an illusion, like how one could not make a mistake about natural disasters such as typhoons.Oliver thought he would not be able to win against the old man if he had to fight him in his current state.\u201cIs there anything interesting, mate?\u201dThe old man asked suddenly.Oliver replied, surprised to find out that the old man was looking.\u201cNo, these are books I\u2019m seeing for the first time, so it\u2019s a bit unfamiliar\u2026 huh?\u201dOne thing caught Oliver\u2019s eyes as he peered through the books.Just like other books, it had a boring title stereotyped with difficult words, but one word caught Oliver\u2019s eye.\u201c\u2026 World tree?\u201d\u201cAre you interested, mate?\u201dOliver answered the old man\u2019s question while lost in his thoughts.\u201cA little\u2026 I heard about it once at work.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that great, mate? It\u2019s rare for ordinary people to mention the world tree. Can I ask what job you\u2019re doing, mate?\u201dOliver thought.\u201c\u2026a waiter at a restaurant.\u201d\u201cWaiter?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I happened to overhear when the customers were talking.\u201dThe old man nodded his head in understanding.\u201cHmm\u2026 I see. You are a waiter who can read\u2026 Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to mock you, mate.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine\u2026 instead, can I ask you a question?\u201dThe old man at the bookstore laughed again.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been asked a question\u2026 Tell me, mate.\u201d\u201cYou seem to be knowledgeable, do you know what the world tree is?\u201d\u201cThe world tree\u2026.it\u2019s a little hard to explain. The concept is so diverse, and the role is vast.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, to put it bluntly, it\u2019s a very large encyclopedia.\u201d\u201cEncyclopedia?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. If I had to compare it, I\u2019d say that\u2019s the most appropriate word.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t understand it, isn\u2019t the world tree just a tree?\u201d\u201cYes. And it is the biggest tree in the world.\u201dThe old man at the bookstore said with confidence.His words were sincere, but Oliver couldn\u2019t understand them.He said the tree was an encyclopedia, and then he said it was the biggest tree in the world.Oliver used his imagination.He imagined a huge tree where people look for information.He wondered whether the information was written on the leaves.It felt like a puzzle he could not solve. Forrest said that he gets information indirectly through the world tree, but the old man\u2019s words that it was an encyclopedia felt contradicting.An encyclopedia was just a document of pre-recorded events or things, and Oliver did not understand how it can have information on Fighter Crew.All of a sudden, Oliver forgot about his disappointment with Gray Market and was now feeling intense curiosity.Oliver wanted to satisfy this curiosity as much as possible, and at that moment the old man at the bookstore gave him a piece of appropriate advice.\u201cYou seem to have a lot of questions, then how about buying this book, mate?\u201d\u201cThis book?\u201d\u201cYes. Although it\u2019s not very interesting and difficult, I think it will be fine if you have the will to learn. It\u2019s worth finding knowledge on your own rather than listening to it through someone else\u2019s mouth\u2026\u2026huh, think of it as some old man\u2019s grumbling.\u201dAlthough he said it in a humble tone, Oliver felt like he had heard the right thing to clear his head.He felt what the old man told was right.It was for the exact reason he came out into the world on his own instead of using the Joseph family disciples to satisfy his curiosity.He could not believe that he asked about the World tree while the book about it was in front of him.\u201cNo, that\u2019s a wonderful saying\u2026 Can I ask how much this book is, Mister?\u201dThe old man at the bookstore looked at Oliver.Even Oliver, who could see through others\u2019 emotions to some extent, was not able to easily read what he was thinking.\u201cIf it\u2019s okay, can I take a look at the book, mate?\u201dThe old man stretched out his hand and asked. Oliver handed him the book.\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 Although it\u2019s a bit old, it\u2019s in good condition, and it\u2019s not easy to obtain. So if you add the storage and maintenance cost\u2026 \u2026please pay me 200,000. \u201c\u201c200,000?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201dOliver tilted his head while thinking inside.This was the first time he had bought a book.However, if it was 200,000, then according to Oliver\u2019s personal opinion, it was worth it.Although it was four times the price of an existing book, Oliver did not know, and even if he knew, 200,000 or 20 million was meaningless to Oliver if it could solve the questions he had.The old man looked at Oliver and asked.\u201cIs it expensive?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Mister, pack it up.\u201d\u201cDoes a restaurant waiter make a lot of money these days? That amount would be enough for my week\u2019s pay.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I get a lot of tips\u2026\u201dOliver said while recalling the story of a man at the beggar\u2019s den, who used to work as a waiter in the past.\u201cTip? Oh, you should be working in a good restaurant.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.it\u2019s a nice place.\u201dOliver answered and took out the money from his pocket.He tried to give the 100,000 Landa bills, but he changed his mind and took out 20 of 10,000 Landa bills.\u201cHere you go.\u201dThe old man at the bookstore folded the bundles of banknotes without counting and put them in his pocket.\u201cTake it. It\u2019s your book now.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cThank you too. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen a guest, even though it was brief, it was enjoyable. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been since I had a conversation with someone, Goodbye.\u201d\u201cYes, goodbye, Mister.\u201dOliver bowed politely and prepared to leave. But he suddenly stopped and looked back at the old man.Perhaps it was an action that would pose unnecessary risks, but, as always, his vigilance could not stop his curiosity.\u201cMister.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why did you come back? Refunds are not accepted by the store policy.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it\u2026 If you don\u2019t mind, can I come and ask you if I had any questions after reading this book?\u201dThe old man grinned.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be easy for an old man like me to give a good answer.\u201d\u201cAny answer is better than no answer.\u201dThe old man grinned.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll think about it if you meet one of my conditions.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of conditions are you talking about?\u201cBuy me some alcohol and snacks. I don\u2019t answer for free. It comes with a charge, mate.\u201dSaying those words, the old man laughed again.After returning to the inn, Oliver had a light meal.In the past, when he was in the Joseph family, he would skip meals to increase his time to read books. But now, he couldn\u2019t help but remember Kent\u2019s advice to eat properly.Nevertheless, the fact that time was scarce was inevitable. So Oliver came up with a good idea.\u201cSimple food to eat?\u201dHe asked the innkeeper with a good appearance.\u201cYes, Madam hostess. Can you send some simple meals to my room to eat?\u201d\u201cWhy? Is the food that I carefully prepared taste bad?\u201dThe hostess asked back while putting her arms around her waist. She looked very displeased now.\u201cNo. Thank you for the food you always serve. It tastes great.\u201dOliver felt a bit of discomfort.\u201cBut, sometimes I have to do things in my room, so I need something to fill up my stomach.\u201d\u201cOh! You don\u2019t even have time to come down and eat because you\u2019re working?\u201dThe hostess spoke sarcastically with a strong attitude.However, Oliver wasn\u2019t offended.He didn\u2019t react in the first place, and he had to consider the fact that most of the people who stayed at this inn were people who were engaged in dangerous things.Emotions are contagious, and it would affect people around them whether they want to or not.There were positive examples like Kent, but there were also negative examples.In other words, she had no choice but to be rough.\u201cI want to study.\u201d\u201cStudy?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I quit for some reason, but now, I want to study again.\u201dThe word of study softened the hostess\u2019 heart.She didn\u2019t know Oliver\u2019s situation, but she seemed to understand something when she used her own imagination, hearing the word study.\u201cWell\u2026it seems like there is a situation, but it\u2019s still difficult.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 is that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, you\u2019re not the only person staying here, so we can\u2019t give you special treatment, right? If we allow you to take food to your room, then everyone will ask us to bring their food to their rooms too. Then, that boy and I will be treated like maids. I don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201dThe hostess said while pointing to the straw-haired, skinny boy, about the same age as Oliver.\u201cUm, I see.\u201d\u201cYes. I can cook food as a hostess, but I don\u2019t like to play the role of a maid.\u201dOliver was silent. It certainly wasn\u2019t something that he could force a person to do.He nevertheless made a suggestion, as she remained a little apprehensive.\u201cWhat if I pay more?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll pay more?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen the story of money came out, the hostess showed interest. Everyone makes money to make the ends meet, so it was natural.It was essentially the same with Oliver.All of a sudden, Oliver was focusing on the conversation itself, not on the food he could eat in the room.It reminded him of the merchants and customers bargaining at the market he visited earlier.The act of eliciting desired opinions through dialogue between people.He wanted to try it, but it was a pity that the opportunity did not come, he suddenly felt like this was the moment he was waiting for.The hostess knocked down at the table.\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense, eat your food in the restaurant space! Don\u2019t waste any more time, do you know how difficult and troublesome it is to prepare food?!\u201d\u201cUm, yes.\u201dContrary to his expectations, the bargain ended easily.Apparently, Oliver did not have the talent for bargaining.After Oliver finished eating, he put the price of the food on the table and went upstairs.On the way up, a straw-haired boy who helps the hostess came up to him and asked.\u201cSir\u2026 Were you a student?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cBecause you said that you wanted to study\u2026 Did you go to school?\u201dOliver thought for a moment and said.\u201cI didn\u2019t go to school. I just learned a little from someone.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Then\u2026 can you read articles?\u201cYes, why?\u201dThe boy who works at the inn hesitated.The emotion of longing shone, and with it came shame and fear.Then, as soon as the boy tried to open his mouth, he heard a scream from downstairs.\u201cRosbane! Where the hell did you go, you runt?\u201dStartled Rosbane bowed to Oliver at the voice of the ferocious hostess. Then, he went down.Scathing shouts could be heard from below, but Oliver did not pay attention to them and went into his room.Then, he pulled out today\u2019s purchases on the bed.Low-quality emotions and Life-force, poor-quality black magic items, and an unintentionally purchased book.Oliver picked up the book, went to the desk, and opened it.He wondered what the world tree was.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68World Tree.Oliver now seemed to understand why Forrest didn\u2019t answer right away, and why the old man at the bookstore found it hard to explain.Because it was something that could not be explained quickly or in a few words, World Tree was something bigger than anything Oliver had ever seen, and its concept was vague, in a word \u2013 unknown.It was in the present progressive tense.It was only about 30 years ago that a proper book about World Tree came out, and it was still being researched.Even Oliver who read the book didn\u2019t know how to explain it.\u201cUm, yes\u2026\u201dHe felt that the explanation of the old man at the bookstore was pretty good.A very large encyclopedia and the largest tree in the world.This was something that Oliver agreed with.First of all, regarding the World Tree, it was true that it was the largest tree among the trees that have been discovered so far, but it has never been confirmed by the naked eye.The reason was, the World Tree was not on the ground.Because it was a tree that was right under the ground.It was said that the main body of the World Tree was under the ground people are stepping, called Root, and with Root as pivot many trees grow around the world like side branches.In other words, it was reasonable to view the World Tree as a cluster of many trees centered on a huge Root, rather than a single huge tree.Although it has not yet been revealed how the World Tree came into existence, there were two hypotheses that seemed credible.One was the theory that the huge body (Root) in the center of the earth spread out all over the world to get nutrients such as sunlight and became the World Tree.Another was that the roots of many trees were intertwined and naturally merged into one to become the World Tree.Both had strong support from academians and the supporter of each hypothesis were fighting each other that their hypothesis was right, so there was no definitive conclusion saying \u2018this is the origin of the World Tree\u2019, and this was not a very important issue because there was something more fascinating than the origin story.The World Tree was not just a tree, it was just the appearance that resembled the tree. The amazing thing about the World Tree is that it has huge natural magical powers. Using those powers it remembers what was happening around the trees that have spread all over the world and stores that information in the abyss world called \u2018Rootnet\u2019.If one could use the Rootnet, they could see not only what was happening around them but also on the other side of the world.In other words, the world tree could be said to be the eye that sees the world.And, that was not the end.Wizards and Druids have developed technologies that can artificially enter this \u2018Rootnet\u2019 through magic and sorcery to store, manage, and print information. This was called \u2018Rootnetsailing\u2019 or simply \u2018netsailing\u2019.Using netsailling, they have stored and managed all the limitless information of over tens of millions of volumes in the World Tree and were able to retrieve and check it whenever needed.Oliver found it quite extraordinary.It didn\u2019t take a single piece of paper to store that much information, and it doesn\u2019t take much effort to find the information you need.It was very convenient and efficient to just go to Rootnet and get the necessary information.For this reason, it was said that some \u2018blessed countries\u2019 including England, are gradually showing a movement to actively use the world tree in national administration and politics.At this time, Oliver was also naturally aware of the dangers and disadvantages of the World Tree.Where there was light, there always exists shadow.For example, exploitation of the World Tree by organizations such as Heimdal.Not only that, but it was also a serious problem that it was very difficult to learn netsailing.Basically, considerable magic skills were required, and most importantly, mental strength, strong enough to maintain consciousness on the Rootnet, a sea of numerous information, was also required.The book warned that users\u2019 consciousness could get engulfed in the sea of information and could cause great damage if done wrong.In other words, it was powerful and convenient, but it was difficult to use, and thanks to that, only a small number of wizards and Druids were using it.Oliver came out of the inn to check whether what he read in the book was correct.After wandering a long time between District U, the end of the workers\u2019 residence, and District V, the beginning of the slum dwellings, Oliver was able to find a branch of World Tree, in a place that was at the border of the two places.\u201cIs this the world tree\u2026?\u201dOliver mumbled as he looked at the tree standing alone.At a glance, it was just an ordinary tree, but thanks to the iron fences and signposts around it, he could tell that it was one of the trees of the World Tree that was spread around the world.[World tree certified by the Magic Tower. In case of damage, you may receive strong punishment according to the law, so please be careful-Landa Police Department.]Oliver looked at the sign on the iron fence and once again saw a tree called the World Tree.No matter how hard he tried, it looked like an ordinary tree \u2013 A tree that could be commonly seen on the streets of Landa.Oliver had seen fenced trees like these previously, but he never paid attention to them.Oliver regretted why he didn\u2019t recognize the existence of the World Tree sooner.It was probably because of his narrow field of vision, where he doesn\u2019t see anything other than what he wasn\u2019t interested in.\u201cI need to fix it.\u201dOliver was aware of his shortcomings and thought of correcting them as he focused his energy on his eyes.The vision of ordinary human gradually blurred, and the vision of a warlock that could see emotions,\u00a0 Life-force, and even magic got activated.\u201cThis\u2026?\u201dOliver tilted his head at the sight in front of him.With the warlock\u2019s eyes, the world tree looked more like a pipe than a tree, and through the pipe, various magical powers were moving at great speed.The blue, yellow, red, and purple colors moved very fast and in a bizarre pattern.Oliver touched his face.Just in case, to check whether he had the mask on his face.Fortunately, he was wearing the leather mask properly. He thought it would be okay if his face was exposed with this one.Confirming safety, Oliver shifted his gaze downward.Under the world tree, towards the roots.\u201cUm\u2026.\u201dOliver groaned in bewilderment.He could clearly under the ground, but it was getting blurry because he couldn\u2019t see the end.It felt like a puppet show from a hundred steps away, and it felt frustrating for Oliver because he couldn\u2019t see anything.As written in the book, Root seems to be in the deepest part of the ground.\u201cha\u2026\u2026.\u201dOliver sighed.He came here because of a book he read out of curiosity, but now, he wanted to check out as many things as possible.Origin theory, seeing the tree with many magical powers and learning about the function and purpose of the World Tree.But, the most important thing that Oliver wanted was, to use the World Tree.He wanted to get a taste of what it has by accessing the unknown world of Rootnet, which was connected by numerous roots.Of course, this was extremely dangerous, and in a sense even foolish.Without getting anything, there were even chances of him getting tangled in some kind of risk.Still, Oliver wanted to give it a try.Because he wanted to do it.When he came to his senses, Oliver was able to climb over the fence and find himself close to the World Tree.Soon, he took out the emotions from the test tube.Then he wondered.In the book, it was said that one can enter the Rootnet through magic.Oliver stretched out his hand that was filled with emotions to the World Tree, thinking of it as an experiment.Seeing that there was no content related to this in the book, it was almost meaningless, but he just gave it a try.\u201cIt worked?\u201dmurmured Oliver, slightly startled.It was similar to entering the secret space at the sausage factory and Puppeteer Glyph\u2019s workshop.When he touched the tree with the emotions in his hand, it felt as if he had put a key into the keyhole.Of course, it didn\u2019t open right away since the keyhole was designed in an unknown shape like the one at Puppeteer\u2019s place, but that wasn\u2019t an issue for Oliver.Oliver scanned the surrounding of the keyhole using the emotions, stored the information in his head, and processed them \u2013 Like the World Tree.Of course, it was quite different and slightly difficult compared to the one at Puppeteer\u2019s workshop, but Oliver did not give in, tried, and forcibly pushed the emotions into the keyhole.At that moment, a crackling sound resounded in his head, and then there was a rattling sound.With that, an unfamiliar scenery unfolded before his eyes.An empty world with no sky and no ground.A world on a black background like the night sky.The only thing that moved was the colorful magic that flew like a meteor.Oliver instinctively sensed that this world was a Rootnet.A world that was made up of the roots of the World Tree, a sea of information containing countless knowledge.Oddly enough, Oliver did not panic, even though it was strange and interesting.He was just calmly looking around, observing, and understanding this place.As said before, the surroundings were as black as the night sky.Oliver instinctively looked at his hand.It was made up of white lines, and the shape of the body seemed to be different because it was the virtual world of the abyss.If there was anything else that bothered him, it was the noise that kept buzzing in his ears.A number of unwelcome voices shouted and pressured Oliver, who simply closed his ears and looked around.\u2018Now, what should I do? Should I leave?\u2019But there was a problem.He luckily got in, but he didn\u2019t know how to get out.Even the book he read only had information about the World Tree, and there was no instruction on how to use it.Oliver wondered whether he had to burn his brain in the drifting sea of information like said in the book\u201cUm, then\u2026 it\u2019s unavoidable.\u201dOliver was calmer than he thought. Of course, if such a situation happened, one should normally be terrified, but since there was nothing he could do about it Oliver remained calm.After a while, Oliver decided to experiment rather than ponder over the question with no answer.It was said in the book that if you handle Rootnet properly, you can get the information you want just by thinking, so he wanted to check if that was true.\u2018So, what information should I look for?\u2019\u2018The Demon? Black magic? Beautiful emotions?\u2019Oliver was tempted, but since it was his first time, he decided to try something lighter.He thought there will not be any major problems, so said something that would be good for practice.\u201cForrest.\u201dThere was a slight creaking sound, and in an instant, some of the magic that moved around like a meteor flew in front of Oliver\u2019s eyes and spread like fireworks.Along with that, unknown characters lined up in the air, all of the characters were something he had seen for the first time.\u201cWhat is this\u2026 huh?\u201dOliver exclaimed in amazement.As he continued to look at the letters he saw for the first time, he thought if he concentrated for a while,\u00a0 he could understand what it was about.\u201dAs Oliver was about to get used to it, he felt an intense gaze from somewhere.\u201cWhat?\u201dOliver turned toward the gaze.An eye made of immense magical power was staring at him.[Who are you?]Oliver looked silently at the Eye.The Eye cried out once again.[Who are you?!]As Oliver was about to answer, his vision suddenly turned to darkness.When he closed his eyes and opened them, he had come back to reality.Oliver confirmed that the emotions he had in his hands were gone.It seemed like he was thrown out because he ran out of emotion.\u201cUm\u2026\u2026.\u201dOliver processed the new interesting facts that he got to know.Oliver recalled the Eye that he had seen on Rootnet and soon realized that he had to get out of here.He thought there might be chances of him getting into trouble if he stayed here anymore.He escaped from the place by running as hard as he could while wearing a black suit made by mixing Life-force and emotion.He was curious about many things, and he thought he had to take care of himself first to find answers to those curious things.After that, a week passed.Oliver did not return to the inn immediately.He stayed near the place from where he first accessed the World Tree and observed the surroundings for a week.The reason was none other than the Eye he met at the Rootnet world.He didn\u2019t know what it was, but he knew that something observed him, so he stayed around to see what happened.If he got caught by a troublesome entity, he was thinking of giving up his current identity and going somewhere else.Fortunately, nothing happened.For a week, not even a single ant came near the World Tree, let alone chase after Oliver.In the end, Oliver, who came to the conclusion that it was not a big deal, left the area and returned to his lodgings, and went to the restaurant of Forrest, who he had forgotten for a while.It felt like it had been almost ten days since the last job was over, so he was even worried that he might have forgotten about him.Kent said that one of the few advantages of this job was freedom, but still, Oliver, who was still a rookie, was a little skeptical.As he opened the rattling door and entered, the red-skinned Al welcomed him.He smiled gladly at Oliver.\u201cMr. Dave, thank you so much for coming. Are you here to see the Boss?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good. Boss was also waiting for Mr. Dave. Come along. I\u2019ll guide you.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Oliver followed Al\u2019s lead. However, for some reason, he led him through the small door next to the warehouse instead of going into Forrest\u2019s office.\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\u201cBoss is waiting for you downstairs.\u201dIt was a different place than usual.\u201c\u2026 Can I ask you why he is waiting for me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Dave. I don\u2019t have the authority to answer that. I\u2019m truly sorry.\u201dAl was sincere. He couldn\u2019t answer even if he wanted to answer.Normally he would have just let it go, but today, Oliver opened his mouth again, recalling the bargaining he had seen in the traditional market.\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cYes, the boss will tell you the details when you go down. I\u2019m sorry again.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026well, instead of that, can you answer another question?\u201d\u201cOther question?\u201d\u201cYes, can you tell me what a restaurant waiter usually does?\u201dAl tilted his head as if he didn\u2019t understand what Oliver was trying to say.\u201cYes, of course, it\u2019s not that difficult, but\u2026 can I ask why?\u201cUm, I suddenly became curious.\u201dOliver said as he thought of the old man at the bookstore.Al didn\u2019t seem to understand what he said, and he didn\u2019t think much about it.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll let you know early in the morning, or at the end of the evening business.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dOliver sincerely bowed thanking Al\u2019s favor.Al greeted the same way, and soon took a key out of his pocket and opened the door next to the food warehouse.When the door with the sign saying \u201cNo entry to outsiders\u201d was opened, a staircase descending down was reflected in Oliver\u2019s eyes.Oliver made his way down the stairs that were lit dimly.The passage seems to be deeper than when he saw it from above, and it didn\u2019t seem like a normal place.Oliver somehow felt that it was unusually deep compared to other buildings.Still, it wasn\u2019t endless, as he finally reached the bottom floor.After getting off the stairs with a small sigh of relief, Oliver moved along the narrow corridor.It reminded him of when he used to live in the basement of Joseph\u2019s sausage factory. The only difference here was that the walls and floors are well finished.Eventually, he reached the end of the corridor.There was only a small door at the end of the corridor, but compared to the way down, it was a very ordinary door.Oliver knocked on the door.\u201cCome in.\u201dWhen permission was given, the door opened immediately.Oliver could tell right away that the basement was not the room for restaurant owner Forrest, but the room of the broker Forrest.A table and a set of chairs to one side, a huge counter, and a pile of filing cabinets were placed behind it.Oliver always had a question about how he managed to work as a broker in that small office, and his question was resolved today.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to call you to such a gloomy place.\u201dForrest spoke as he organized the material he had just pulled out from the cabinet.\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. But what are you doing?\u201d\u201cI suddenly found out something. It has nothing to do with you, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not a big deal.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like it was true when he said it wasn\u2019t a big deal, but Oliver didn\u2019t ask about it.It was said that if you ask too much about an individual in this field, you would rather become a target of caution.\u201cMr. Al said you\u2019ve been waiting for me, can I ask what\u2019s going on?\u201dAfter finishing the paperwork, Forrest nodded and took some money out of the drawer.It was 200 bills of 100,000 Landa bills.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I got paid for my last job.\u201d\u201cAdditional reward. Looking at the books and documents you brought along with the undiluted amount of potion, the client was quite pleased. Can I speak with you for a moment?\u201dOliver politely nodded and sat across from Forrest.Forrest poured out a drink as usual, and Oliver sniffed it slightly and then shoved it into his throat.\u201cIs it edible? You drink better than I thought, so I picked that out.\u201dOliver, who had no sense of taste, nodded his head without thinking.\u201cI\u2019m glad\u2026the documents and ledgers you brought with you indirectly helped the client\u2019s business.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes, he got more information on the price and where to supply magic wine stocks through the clients and prices on the raw material. If you had taken something like this to the black market, it would have sold for a high price.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dOliver nodded again at the new information.\u201cI originally planned to sell that at a high price, but the client paid for it first. As you can see, it\u2019s 20 million.\u201d\u201cWhat about Mr. Forrest\u2019s fee?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t take it this time. There was nothing I did in the first place, and the other side offered the money first.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter if Forrest took the fee, but Oliver didn\u2019t open his mouth because he said it was okay.The money was piling up step by step.Oliver felt a bit of relief.Oliver didn\u2019t know when he would need it, but he had to earn it as much as possible.Suddenly, a question came to him.\u201cBy the way, do they usually give money like this?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good point. Let\u2019s get down to business. The money is certainly the price of your fair labor, but at the same time it\u2019s also a bribe.\u201d\u201cA bribe?\u201d\u201cYeah. The money is a fair price for the job you did. So even if you take the money, you never owe it to anyone.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\u201cHowever, the client who commissioned the job wants to meet you in person.\u201d\u201cMe? Why does he want to meet me?\u201d\u201cHe said he wanted to thank you in person. But, the real reason might be wanting to meet the skilled warlock. It\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d\u201cAm I a skilled warlock?\u201d\u201cYes, you are. Why?\u201cNo. Nothing. Is he willing to give this much money for that?\u201dIt was a valid point.Among the contents of the last request, Forrest said that the client had barely met the minimum level of remuneration.It means that the client was either a miser trying to get things done cheaply or someone who was short on money.But, that person willingly offered the same amount as the salary that he barely matched, just to thank him.It didn\u2019t make sense to Oliver.\u201cOf course, no. It seems like he wants to ask you two things.\u201d\u201cAsk me?\u201d\u201cYeah, don\u2019t bother about the money too much. When a talented solver appears on this floor, all kinds of organizations try to make a connection.\u201dOliver nodded his head without saying a word.Apparently, it seemed like he was getting recognized for his skills as a solver.\u201cWhat is he going to ask?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that great. Since you\u2019ve been to the Wizard\u2019s workshop, he wants you to give him a rough outline of what it looks like.\u201d\u201cSince he has Professor Herbert, wouldn\u2019t it be quicker to ask him?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. The problem is he has already lost the trust in that guy after getting stabbed in the back once. So, he needs someone to crosscheck.\u201dIt seemed right\u201cI think that will be fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad. And, the second one is a request.\u201d\u201cRequest?\u201d\u201cYeah, to be exact, a job.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of job is it?\u201d\u201cHe wants you to protect the wizard workshop that he is building. The duration is only a few months.\u201d\u201cWhy does he want to meet me and ask that? If it\u2019s an official request, shouldn\u2019t it be delivered through Mr. Forrest?\u201d\u201cI refused.\u201d\u201cRefused?\u201d\u201cYeah, because it\u2019s an unacceptable one by my standards.\u201dOliver was intrigued.He wondered what was the job that Forrest couldn\u2019t agree to, and why did Forrest bring up this story to him if he rejected it.\u201cAre the conditions too tight?\u201d\u201cRumors have started spreading about a Solver who defeated 3 Fighter Crew members while you weren\u2019t here, so your name has become a little known. Although it\u2019s like a Dark Horse that comes out every year, there are still quite a few people paying attention.\u201dForrest spoke the truth without any exaggeration or undermining.It made sense since Knuckle Joe, Nico, and Bigjaw were quite well-known mercenary Warlocks.It did not seem that strange.\u201cThe condition suggested by the client is 15 million in advance in addition to paying your daily expenses. He said that he would give another 15 million if you finish the job safely.\u201d\u201cI think it looks pretty good, what\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d\u201cOf course, that\u2019s the case in general. Do you remember what I said earlier? The client belongs to Crime Firm.\u201d\u201cYes, I heard.\u201d\u201cAs you know, it\u2019s pretty great to be part of Crime Firm. You can get protection and help from the organization. But sometimes you get involved in internal competition.\u201dOliver nodded.He had heard about that from Kent and knew it.Many organizations belonging to the Crime Firm compete with each other, so Kent asked him to be wary of them.\u201cThe magic wine industry is a money-making business. Demand is always abundant, but supply is scarce. That\u2019s why it makes money, and where there is a lot of money, there is always conflict.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean that the wine production workshop could be attacked by the members of the Crime Firm?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not unconditional, but there is a pretty high probability. That\u2019s not the end of it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the end?\u201dForrest took out a round glass bottle from inside.There was a seal stamped on the outside, and it turned out to be something Oliver had given him in the past.\u201cIsn\u2019t this the potion I gave you last time?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll ask again. Was this really something you found at Assistant Professor Herbert\u2019s workshop?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThis thing belongs to Magic Tower.\u201d\u201cMagic Tower?\u201d\u201cYeah, this seal is the proof. It\u2019s stamped on objects that are under the management of the Tower. I\u2019ve done my research.\u201dOliver asked, contemplating.\u201c\u2026why was something that belongs to Magic Tower there?\u201d\u201cThere are two possibilities. Herbert surprisingly raided and robbed the items being transported to the Magic Tower, or he was secretly dealing with an insider of the Magic Tower.\u201d\u201cIt will be the latter.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. If the property of Magic Tower had been stolen, there would have been a lot of noise, but there were no signs of that, so it must have been stolen. Well, it\u2019s not that rare.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, as its name suggests, Magic Tower is a place where a lot of magical knowledge and resources are dealt with. If you have bad intentions, you might think about stealing things that are sleeping in the warehouse or tampering with the resource a few times. Therefore, big professors and students of Magic Towers come to the back alley to find thieves. Surprisingly, the elite people of Landa, who are proud of the country, are also the main customers of the back alleys.\u201dForrest looked so happy.\u201cDoes that mean that not only the rivals in Crime Firm but also the officials of the tower might attack the workshop?\u201d\u201cThe probability is low, but it is not impossible. After examining Herbert\u2019s ledger, a significant proportion of the money went to unidentified people, probably someone inside the Magic Tower.\u201dOliver nodded as he recalled the potion he had seen in the Wizard\u2019s workshop.\u201cOf course, unless the people from the Magic Tower are reckless, nothing will happen.\u201d\u201cIn other words, although the probability is low, it is also undeniable that the client can be attacked.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I refused, fighting a Wizard belonging to Magic Tower is dangerous, and it\u2019s not worth 30 million.\u201dOliver nodded.Everything Forrest said was sincere.Kent was right when he said Forrest knew the Solver\u2019s skills and gave them the safest and most efficient job.Still, there were parts he didn\u2019t understand.\u201cThen, why are you saying this to me?\u201dForrest leaned forward slightly.\u201cThe client asked for a chance to persuade you directly. So I\u2019m asking for your opinion.\u201dThere was sincerity in Forrest\u2019s emotion.\u201cAlso, depending on your personality, you might want to meet someone who belongs to the Crime Firm, and of course, the final decision is yours.\u201dOliver thought, what should we do?The job, the crime firm, the rival gang, and the person related to the Magic tower \u2026 It was a little interesting.Oliver answered, glancing at the man waiting in the next room.\u201cUm, I\u2019m fine with meeting him.\u201d\u201cOf course, you can just say no after you meet him, hey, come in.\u201dWith those words, the secret door on one side of the office opened and a man entered.He said looking at Oliver.\u201cHello, Mr. Warlock. My name is Murphy Kimbell.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70Murphy Kimbell.The first impression of the man in Oliver\u2019s eyes was a man who looked like a stone statue.His shoulders were wide open, his body was stiff, and his eyes and expression were rigid like a lifeless stone.He felt more like an artificially made human than simply a well-trained human being.He ruffled his hair to one side and spoke again.\u201cHello. Mr. Warlock. My name is Murphy Kimbell.\u201dOliver got up from his seat and greeted him the same way.\u201cYes, hello? I\u2019m Dave.\u201dAn awkward greeting along with a strange sense of tension.At that moment, Forrest also got up from the seat and opened his mouth.\u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you, please sit here. Even though the two of you have already greeted each other, still I\u2019ll do the introduction\u2026 Dave, this is Murphy Kimbell. He\u2019s the boss of the Kimbell family which holds shops from the 40th to 45th Street in District T\u2026. \u2026 Mr. Kimbell, this is Dave, the warlock who captured Herbert.\u201dOn Forrest\u2019s introduction, Oliver once again greeted Murphy.Once again, Oliver felt a strange atmosphere.Maybe it was just a feeling, but somehow Oliver felt that the person in front of him had faced more near-death experiences than all the people he had met.It includes the Lightning Wizard, Master Joseph, and Paladin Joanna.Forrest explained as if he read Oliver\u2019s thoughts.\u201cMr. Murphy is a Veteran Soldier. A true patriot who fought during the colonial and continental wars.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026 That was all a long time ago. Right now, I\u2019m just a person who runs a small business\u2026 Anyway, nice to meet you. Mr. Warlock, I personally wanted to thank you for your help this time. Thank you very much.\u201dMurphy was very polite despite his overbearing appearance. However, his heart had different thoughts compared to his words.He was currently making numerous speculations about whether Oliver was truly the person who completed this job.Oliver reminded himself of Kent\u2019s advice of asking him to be always on guard against gangsters.\u201cNo, I just did my job.\u201d\u201cStill, thanks a lot. The books and documents you brought were also very helpful.\u201d\u201cI received a reasonable price, so it\u2019s fine. Rather, I heard that you have something to say to me.\u201dWhen Oliver got to the point, Murphy followed right away.Forrest took a step back and watched the situation.\u201cYeah, as you may have heard, we don\u2019t fully trust this Assistant professor. Once a traitor will always be a traitor.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I can\u2019t trust the wizard\u2019s workshop he\u2019s talking about. So, could you give me a brief description of the workshop you saw in District X? I don\u2019t know what other tricks he may try to pull on me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve only looked around once. There were four workshop-like buildings, but I was only able to visit one of them. Why don\u2019t you go there and take a look yourself?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already gone there. But, the workshop was empty.\u201d\u201cEmpty?!\u201d\u201cYes, it wasn\u2019t a simple break-in, someone intentionally emptied the workshop.\u201dAt that moment, Oliver recalled the strangers who were detected by the minion when he escaped with Herbert.It felt like they were related.\u201cUm\u2026 did I make a mistake?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m grateful to Mr. Warlock for exceeding my expectations for the little money I provided. I\u2019m just trying to get some help.\u201dHe looked at Forrest. He shrugged as if nothing had happened.Oliver thought for a moment, then asked Forrest if he had a paper and pen.\u201cDo you have Paper and pen?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dForrest was puzzled, but still, he gave him a piece of paper and a pen.Upon receiving the pen and paper, Oliver started to draw the sketch of the workshop that he saw. He drew the water tank, pipes, and materials he saw in the place.Within the scope of his knowledge, he identified what kind of material it was, how much capacity it had, and what was its role in the device, and briefly wrote them down.Making Pilgarets and reading magic-related books was helpful for Oliver in identifying and remembering things.\u201cIt was roughly like this. I can\u2019t remember more than this.\u201dIt was not perfect, but nevertheless, Murphy and Forrest couldn\u2019t help but open their mouths wide at the great drawing by Oliver.Both of them were startled.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Is there any problem?\u201d\u201cNo. No\u2026 it\u2019s great\u2026 It\u2019s wonderful. Really, is this picture right?\u201d\u201cAs far as I remember?\u201dMurphy carefully folded the paper Oliver had drawn and placed it into his pocket without any further questioning.Murphy opened his mouth again with great satisfaction.\u201cAnd I have one more request.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the security issue?\u201d\u201cYeah, yes, I was going to talk about this. Soon, I\u2019m planning on opening a magic wine factory\u2026 To be frank, this is a very big thing in this field of business.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. The market for magic wine is as large as it is for legal alcoholic beverages. Although there is a high risk in manufacturing and consumption, there is always a steady demand for these products. If we can continue to mass-produce these products then we can make a huge profit.\u201dWhat Murphy said was the truth. When Oliver saw Forrest, he too nodded.Murphy was a lot kinder at explanation than he expected, and Oliver soon understood the reason for it.The man in front of him right now was in desperate need of Oliver.As Kent said, a situation where the Solver had the upper hand appeared.Of course, he could cut Oliver when the job was done, but at least until then, he was going to satisfy Oliver\u2019s needs as much as possible.Murphy continued.\u201cHowever, the bigger the business, the fiercer the competition is, and the competition in the back alley is accompanied by violence. So I need someone to protect the factory until it\u2019s finished.\u201d\u201cUm, if it\u2019s okay with you, can I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cA question?\u201d\u201cYes, if it\u2019s okay with you.\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s something I should do. So, What do you want to know?\u201d\u201cYou said until it\u2019s finished, does that mean it will be all right after it\u2019s finished?\u201d\u201cYes, from then on, it will be fine. If we prove to our superiors the benefits that will be gained through the quality and production of the product, then our organization will naturally protect us. So now is the most crucial time.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t very convincing, but still, Oliver nodded.There were a lot of things that Oliver didn\u2019t quite understand about the so-called organization in the first place.Still, he could see what it means for an organization like\u00a0 Crime Firm to compete and cooperate.\u201cHonestly, I know it\u2019s rude to ask like this. So, at first, I tried to stop them with just me and my family. It\u2019s not something I want to brag about in front of a Warlock, but I\u2019m actually pretty confident in fighting.\u201dWhat he said was true.\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of Herbert and the officials that were backing him in the Magic Tower.\u201dMurphy mentioned the most sensitive part of the job.\u201cIt\u2019s the wizard. If the Wizards decide to act, we won\u2019t stand a chance. That\u2019s why I came here to ask for help.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that I can beat the wizard, right?\u201d\u201cIf the word that a skilled warlock like you is guarding the place goes out, maybe they will hesitate to make a move. Even they don\u2019t want to make a big deal out of this.\u201dOliver nodded.Murphy didn\u2019t want Oliver to stop the wizards. He just wants him to be a scarecrow to threaten the Wizards.\u201cI know it\u2019s an inappropriate proposal. It doesn\u2019t really make sense to ask for someone to fight against a wizard with only 30 million that too a wizard from the Magic Tower. But, as far as I know, the only person who can do this is Mr. Warlock. If you agree to it I\u2019ll add more rewards.\u201d\u201cMore?\u201d\u201cYes, we can\u2019t pay more than this due to lack of cash right now, but on the premise that the factory is operating safely, we will add another 30 million by the fall of next year. A total of 60 million.\u201dOliver looked at Forrest.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t take jobs with such uncertain payment.\u201d\u201cWell, I also understand Mr. Forrest\u2019s position. He prefers to do solid business. But I\u2019m serious.\u201dOliver saw Murphy\u2019s feelings. As he said, he was sincere. Of course, in order for that sincerity to become a reality, the factory had to be successfully completed and operated.\u201cAside from that, we can do our best to help you in other ways as well.\u201d\u201cOther ways?\u201d\u201cAnything I can help with, like the black market.\u201dOliver looked at Forrest again. Forrest shook his head this time.\u201cMr. Forrest didn\u2019t say anything. It was just my guess. It looks like I got it right.\u201d\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been to several places on the battlefield. I\u2019ve met a few warlocks. It\u2019s rare for a skilled warlock to wander alone.\u201dWhen he heard the story, Oliver thought he should make a companion. The warlock wandering around alone seemed to stand out more than he thought.\u201cEven if it\u2019s not a black market, we can provide you with a bridge so that you can use the services of the Crime Firm, such as identity cards and buildings.\u201d\u201cIdentification card? Building?\u201d\u201cYes, it would be more convenient to have an ID to work in Landa, and it would be cheaper to rent a room for a long time than to stay at a dormitory or inn. Crime Firm is involved in all these businesses.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying this because we desperately need the help of Mr. Warlock right now. If you help us, we will not forget the grace. It may sound like a bluff, but if I get to a higher position in Crime Firm, I can help you a lot more than this.\u201dOnce again, he was sincere. Although he felt more determined than confident, he was also planning on having a long-term relationship with Oliver in mind.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but can I have a conversation with Mr. Forrest, just the two of us? I would like to discuss with him for a moment.\u201d\u201cOf course. Of course, you have to. Then I will be out in the next room for a while, so please call me after talking.\u201dMurphy gladly accepted and got up.Oliver and Forrest were left alone.Oliver was the first to speak.\u201cIs that true? If he gets a higher position in the Crime Firm, he can help me?\u201d\u201cThat must be true. As I said before, I am also keen to find a new force within the Crime Firm. You can ask him for a reasonable favor. He seemed like he will do anything to get your help.\u201dIt didn\u2019t sound too bad.It was like doing something and getting something in return. It has always been like this for Oliver.\u201cWill Mr. Murphy grow that much?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t even know. A person who is likely to become a giant floats dead in the Dames River the next day, and a person who was like a drunkard becomes a giant\u2026 But, if you ask my opinion, I\u2019ll say there is a possibility. \u201d\u201cPossibility?\u201d\u201cYeah, it takes a long-term plan to survive in this place, and Murphy has it.\u201d\u201cIs it because of the Magic wine Factory?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s because Murphy is a Reinforced human. A human whose body is strengthened with the power of medicine and magic. It\u2019s a basic surgery that costs thousands of millions, but he got it for free. In the military.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026for free, how?\u201d\u201cBecause he willingly accepted being a test subject. Thanks to that, he became a Reinforced human for free and after being discharged, he used that power to dominate five streets in District T. He knows when to step back and when to take risks.\u201dOliver understood exactly what Forrest was trying to say. Although this request may be of low value from the standpoint of a broker or a Solver, it seemed like a good investment for Oliver.However, he couldn\u2019t decide on his own, so Forrest offered Oliver an option.\u201cTo be honest, if you want short-term gains, you could just ignore this and I\u2019ll put you on other lucrative jobs\u2026.\u201d\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m just suggesting options. The choice is yours. Murphy seems to be in a hurry, so he won\u2019t give you much time to think.\u201dOliver nodded. He didn\u2019t know what the odds were, but it seemed like a good deal for a long-term investment.It didn\u2019t seem too bad to make an acquaintance with a person who might become an influential figure at the Crime Firm.Upon the news that a decision had been made, Forrest called Murphy, and Murphy opened the door.\u201cDid you decide, Mr. Warlock?\u201d\u201cYes, I will do it. Instead, I have a favor.\u201d\u201cPlease? What?\u201d\u201cI heard that there might be a fight with Wizards, so it takes a lot of emotion and Life-force. Is there any place I can get it? I know one gray market, but the product quality is poor.\u201d\u201cYeah, If that\u2019s all you need, I can provide that. Do you need anything else?\u201dOliver pondered whether he should ask for more.\u201c\u2026There is nothing other than that. Can I tell you later?\u201d\u201c\u2026..of course.\u201dCLAP!Forrest clapped his hands and pulled out the contract.\u201cOkay. Then, let me write the employment contract.\u201dAfter that, Oliver bought emotions and Life-force in bulk through the new gray market that Murphy introduced him to.The Gray Market he was introduced to this time was pretty good.When he talked to Forrest and Murphy about this, they said it was because of the nature of the gray market.Although it was connected to a huge black market, it was relatively poorly managed because it was not close by, so sometimes good things come in and sometimes bad things come in.Then, they said Oliver would be able to know when a good product would arrive by accumulating experience and would be even able to purchase a good quality product at a lower price.It really seemed like a normal marketplace, and Oliver decided to do it that way.\u201cIs it here?\u201dOliver checked the address on the note.[No13, 42nd Street in District T.]Oliver reached a place after a long wandering through the densely populated area with factories and warehouses, but all he could see was a shabby warehouse surrounded by factories.He really wondered if this was the place where the magic wine production facility was, and then he heard a familiar voice.\u201cYou are here. Mr. Warlock.\u201d\u201cMr. Murphy.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry for not coming to pick you up, I\u2019ll show you around. Please follow me.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71Oliver followed Murphy\u2019s guidance and went into the shabby warehouse.The exterior of the warehouse was stained with dirt and some of the paints on the wall were peeled off, and the interior was in as bad shape as it looked outside.Old, dusty wooden boxes were piled up like walls here and there, and black tents were scattered here and there.Oliver didn\u2019t know what to say, but it looked like this warehouse hasn\u2019t been maintained for a while.Or it was made like this on purpose.Murphy said as if he read what Oliver was thinking.\u201cIsn\u2019t it very messy?\u201c\u2026. a little bit?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m happy to hear that.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe main goal of this is to make people think that way. Messy warehouses like this are common, and they don\u2019t check this kind of place that much. Everyone hates getting dust on their clothes.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026.\u201d\u201cMurphy, who is he?\u201dA third voice intervened.It was a female voice, and when Oliver turned his head, he saw a middle-aged woman with a file folder in one hand, coming in their direction. Next to her was a teenage boy whose age was similar to Oliver.\u201cAunt Maggie, this is the Warlock I told you about last time.\u201d\u201cThis person\u2026? He looks younger than I thought\u2026\u201dHer expression flickered for a moment, but she quickly regained her composure.Oliver also observed her as she greeted her politely with no arrogant demeanor.She looked kind of strong, and she could be said to be more like Marie from the past, a person who fights against the storms of the world.\u201cYou\u2019re so young? Are you really the person who captured the Assistant professor?\u201dAs the boy next to Maggie muttered, Murphy immediately swung his arm and smacked the back of the boy.The boy who got hit was annoyed and said,\u201cMurph.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Mr. Warlock. He is the youngest, so he\u2019s a little rude.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s fine. By the way, is he your brother?\u201d\u201cYes, he is the youngest one named Milo.\u201dApparently, unlike the usual Warlock family, the Kimbell family seemed to run an organization as a family.This seemed like an important piece of information, so Oliver stored it in his head.\u201cI also apologize for the rudeness of my nephew. Sir Warlock. Thanks to you, we were able to resume business sooner than expected. Thank you.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s all right because I got paid for the job.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, can I ask for your name? Since we will have to stay together for a while. I think it would be good if we knew each other\u2019s name.\u201d\u201cMy name is Dave.\u201d\u201cDave?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThank you for telling me. If you ever need anything during your stay here, please let me know. I will do my best to accommodate it\u2026 I have work to do, so if there is nothing, shall I take my leave?\u201dAs soon as Oliver nodded, Maggie pulled her nephew Milo\u2019s ear and walked out.\u201cAh! Ah! Aunt, Aunt! My Ear!\u201dMaggie left with Milo.Oliver spoke to Murphy while looking at Maggie.\u201cShe seems pretty strong.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. She\u2019s a strong person\u2026 Shall we continue?\u201dOliver nodded at Murphy\u2019s words.\u201cThank you. Then, this way\u2026\u201dMurphy took Oliver inside the warehouse.There was a lot of luggage in the warehouse that was piled up along the wall.It was at a level where the walls and pathway were covered in luggage.As Oliver looked around, Murphy went through the pile of boxes.\u201cThis way.\u201dOliver went through the pile of a box that was about to collapse.It was deeper than he thought, but he soon realized that this was intentionally made this way.\u201cHere it is.\u201dMurphy said as he opened the secret door in the huge wooden box.\u201cDid you make a workshop in the center of the warehouse?\u201d\u201cYeah, I originally planned to make it in the basement, but I couldn\u2019t find a factory that fits the size.\u201dAs he opened the door and went inside, Oliver saw a workshop similar to the one he had seen in District X.It had not been completed yet, but several workers have already gathered and are in the process of completing it.\u201cMr. Murphy?A worker with greasy hands took off his hat and greeted Murphy.\u201cI\u2019m here because of something else. Don\u2019t worry about me. How about that drawing? How about work?\u201d\u201cI looked at the drawing Mr. Murphy gave me and made some changes. There\u2019s no big problem with the production itself, but it\u2019s more efficient to switch. Thanks to you, our workload has increased, but I think we can finish it in time if we struggle somehow.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201dMurphy was truly relieved to hear those words.\u201cBy the way, who is this?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 he is the one who\u2019ll be guarding the factory.\u201dAt those words, everyone\u2019s eyes turned to look at Oliver, and each started to mutter in an uneasy manner.\u201cWarlock\u2026\u201d\u201cHe looks young?\u201d\u201cWill it be all right?\u201dThe noise was so annoying that the foreman who was talking to Murphy shouted loudly.\u201cStop gossiping and get back to work! I\u2019m not giving you money to make a fuss!\u201dAt those words, the workers went back to what they were doing. As soon as the place got a little quieter, the foreman whispered to Murphy.\u201cIs that the warlock you spoke of?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Isn\u2019t he a little young?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure of his skills\u2026 Moreover, Mr. Forrest has guaranteed him.\u201d\u201cWell, since there will be gangsters and even a real wizard may show up\u2026we have no other choice.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. The probability of that happening is very low. I brought a warlock to lower the chance of that happening, so don\u2019t worry about that, and just take care of your work. As long as this workshop properly operates, you won\u2019t have to work in other factories anymore. Do you understand?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, I understand. Boss.\u201dAfter the conversation, the foreman returned to work and Murphy approached Oliver.\u201cThis is the place which Mr. Warlock has to protect. To set up a workshop in the center of the warehouse, I have bought the entire warehouse and gathered all the surrounding lands to disguise it.\u201dOliver skimmed through the fairly large workshop. It was several times larger than the one he saw in District X, and this workshop also had a ventilation system above it.Calling it a Workshop was an exaggeration. It did seem like a factory.\u201cWhere is the entrance?\u201d\u201cIncluding the way we came, there are two entrances. One is for people and the other is for moving luggage.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cAnd I have a favor to ask you.\u201d\u201cIs it about security?\u201d\u201cYes, we usually deal with the small gangs that come to disrupt the business, but while you\u2019re here, I want you to do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying to push Mr. Warlock to work. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it about spreading rumors?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes. I\u2019ve hired a warlock to increase the defense. As long as this rumor spreads, the clumsy attacks will decrease, and it will be much easier to work. Would that be all right?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 was he a colleague?\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cThe one you just talked with earlier.\u201dOliver pointed to the foreman.\u201cAh, yes. He was one of my colleagues in the Military. He was a mechanic\u2026 Now, we\u2019re working together.\u201d\u201cUm, I see\u2026. As you said, I will take care of all the intruders.\u201dMurphy was delighted with Oliver\u2019s attitude.\u201cAh, thank you. I would appreciate it if you could show your face often around the factory and use black magic a few times.\u201d\u201cUm, will the Wizards not come if I do that?\u201dMurphy\u2019s expression darkened when the word wizard came out.It wasn\u2019t that he was intimidated by the name Wizard. There was something more deep in that expression.\u201c\u2026if they hear there is a skilled warlock, they probably won\u2019t rush things. They don\u2019t want things to get bigger, and we don\u2019t want to make a fuss.\u201dOliver was honestly skeptical. Even though the only Wizard he had spoken to was the Lightning Wizard, he wondered if the Wizards would really care about a Warlock.And that wasn\u2019t the only thing that bothered him.Murphy didn\u2019t seem to expect that Oliver would win a fight against a wizard, despite calling him a skilled Warlock.Oliver knew a little bit about the warlock\u2019s being looked down on as fake wizards, but even so, it was a bit strange to see such a reaction.\u201cMr. Murphy, have you ever seen a wizard in person?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cYou seem to know something about Wizards.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I saw them a few times when I was in the military.\u201d\u201cThen can you explain? About the Wizards you saw while in the military. I think it will be of great help for me.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026, If it\u2019s that much I don\u2019t mind.\u201dWar Wizards.That was how Murphy referred to the wizards who took part on the battlefield as soldiers.He said that there were Wizards who were officers, and there were also Wizards who enlisted like him, but for the sake of convenience, they called the enlisted Wizards, War Wizards.All war wizards acted as an individual unit, and the range of their activities also varied depending upon the differences in individual abilities.He also said that the Wizards with high levels of magic firepower are grouped together to increase their firepower by many folds.According to Murphy, the War Wizard unit formed like that could use ridiculous magic that could evaporate thousands of people.It was a pretty surprising story even for Oliver, who has limited emotions.Oliver thought it might be a bluff, but after seeing Murphy\u2019s emotions, he gave up on that thought.He was sincere. Perhaps that was why he had a lot of anxiety even if he pretended to be calm on the outside about the current situation where he might clash with a wizard.After that, Murphy continued.\u201cWizards who give hope to their allies and fear to their enemies are also active in resource exploration and various academic fields.\u201dAs soon as Murphy finished his story, Oliver decided to ask all the Veteran Soldiers in the factory about Wizards.Looking at Oliver, who was curious and obedient, even while being on guard, everyone answered what they knew about Wizards, including Veteran soldiers, warehouse workers, security guards, and even Murphy\u2019s brothers Martin and Meyer.According to them, the main role of the wizards was to break One\u2019s will to fight by inflicting heavy blows to the enemy with powerful firepower.In particular, they said that their activities were more seen in new continents where there were no wizards or in uncharted lands to the east.In a legendary tale, it was said that a single wizard once defeated more than 5,000 troops with only three magic skills by inflicting heavy blows.Oliver once felt that defeating a wizard would be easy, but now it seemed like the wizards are difficult opponents to face.Oliver was a little scared, but, that didn\u2019t stop him from feeling curious.He thought of giving his best since he had accepted the job.Oliver soon roamed around the warehouse while guarding, as he familiarized himself with the terrain in his mind, he contemplated an expected intrusion route.Oliver was now at a level where he started thinking about how he would break in if it was him.After much deliberation, Oliver selected seven intrusion routes that were the most convenient way to break in and planted the emotions he purchased from the gray market accordingly.The range varied from near the warehouse to the top of a distant building.He didn\u2019t forget to engrave a black magic circle on the test tube.The black Magic Circle is an auxiliary device that helps to activate black magic from a distance and it was something Oliver learned from Anthony Family\u2019s books.Originally, it was exclusively used for manipulation-based magic, but Oliver arbitrarily changed it to increase its versatility.In terms of firepower, black magic can be pushed by Wizard\u2019s magic, but these tweaks brought in by Oliver were able to fill those gaps.It took Oliver a few days to defeat all the gangsters and prepare to face the wizards, but the people that worked in the factory still seemed to be unsure of Oliver.They were afraid of being attacked by a wizard.\u201cThat warlock is stronger than you think? He chased out the gangsters three times, all by himself, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cI was worried because he was so young, but I was surprised when I saw his strength.\u201d\u201cHis personality is also very strange, and the warlocks I have seen on the battlefield were worse than the enemies, they were all dangerous.\u201d\u201cHey, is it all right? He stopped the gangsters, but can he stop a Wizard?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s been a few days already, the workshop is almost finished, so, probably they won\u2019t show up.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s good, but what if a Wizard shows up?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it okay because there is a warlock?\u201d\u201cAre you stupid, how can black magic stand a chance against real magic? Did you forget the reason why they call a warlock a fake wizard?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the Warlock staying here pretty famous one, the one who defeated three warlocks?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. His power might have an effect on Warlocks but it won\u2019t even itch a Wizard. Moreover, if he was really a skilled Warlock, he wouldn\u2019t have become a Solver.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u201dOliver sat in a space on the side of the warehouse and overheard what the workers were talking about.He had planted [Eavesdropping ears] throughout the warehouse for security purposes, but by chance, he was able to hear the people chatting.It was fun, so he left it on.Everyone seemed to have some trust in Oliver than when they first met him, but they were still anxious about the Wizard.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dMurphy, who Oliver had not seen for a while suddenly appeared and spoke to him.\u201cUm, Mr. Murphy. Hello. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cYeah, It\u2019s been a while, since I was on a business trip.\u201d\u201cEveryone is wondering when we will start the production\u2026 Has everything been going well here in the meantime?\u201d\u201cYes, there was nothing.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s good.\u201dMurphy replied with a relieved expression looking at Oliver\u2019s attitude.It was kind of weird. Oliver saw him fight once when the gangsters broke in, and he was no ordinary man either.With a power, agility, and reflex that Oliver could gain only by using black magic, Murphy killed the gangsters that came into the workshop during the night with just one knife, and it was a little strange that such a person was treating Oliver very respectfully.Oliver understood that\u2019s how much important the Wizard workshop was to Murphy.Suddenly, Oliver got curious.\u201cMr. Murphy.\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Warlock.\u201cBy any chance, do you have a special reason for making this magic wine factory?\u201cSpecial reason?\u201dMurphy frowned at the out-of-the-box question, but that didn\u2019t mean he tried to avoid the question.He thought of Oliver, who worked beyond Murphy\u2019s expectations for the past two weeks.\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. Warlock, but may I ask what the intent of your question is?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just curious.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m curious. I heard people say that you spent a lot of money to make this magic wine factory, but isn\u2019t it a risky choice considering there was a chance of it getting destroyed? I wondered why you decided to invest in this while taking such a risk. Is the money you earn from the shops in 5 streets, not enough?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMurphy took a cigarette without answering Oliver\u2019s question right away.He contemplated whether to say it or not and then, after a while, he opened his mouth while exhaling the cigarette smoke.\u201c\u2026 Does Mr. Warlock know why I enlisted into the military?\u201d\u201cUm, because you\u2019re a patriot?\u201d\u201cNo, because there was no exemption fee.\u201d\u201cExemption fee?\u201d\u201cYes, if you can pay 300 million, you will be exempted from military service. I was not able to afford that money.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cYeah, for not having 300 million, all the people here were forced to run around the battlefield filled with bullets and shells, and roll in the mud. Then the state gives us the title of patriots. And then do you know what happens?\u201d\u201cI do not know?\u201d\u201cUnlucky people come back without limbs or with a shaky head. They may say they are happy\u2026 \u2026but they are not as happy as they used to be\u2026 While they were in the military, their house becomes poorer, and their wife lives with another guy. There are even cases where wives sell themselves as a business. No matter how hard you try to live your life, they will try to cut wages by saying that you can live just by eating potatoes. If you were to protest for a raise, they would send a gangster like me to your doorsteps\u2026 \u2026In this damn country if you don\u2019t have money, you\u2019re just a corpse.\u201dMurphy was saying the Truth.There was a strong sense of sincerity and anger which was more than anything Oliver had ever seen.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m starting this business. To become rich. To get richer. Then, I don\u2019t have to send my children to the military, and I can provide decent jobs to my comrades who don\u2019t have enough money.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have to work under people I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I have built this place while working so hard.\u201dOliver nodded convincingly.He thought money was the reason, but he saw a more fundamental problem from another angle.It was quite interesting.He thought that money was the only concern of the gangsters, but now he understood that there was something more\u2026At that moment, there was a reaction from the minions Oliver had laid around.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dOliver closed one eye and focused his attention on his other eye.\u201cSomeone is coming.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72\u201cSomeone is coming.\u201dAt that one word from Oliver, Murphy instinctively noticed that something was wrong and sent a hand signal to the surrounding subordinates.Thanks to many of them being veteran soldiers, they moved in harmony with one light hand gesture and spread the warning signal around them as if they had been trained in advance.\u201cRed light! Red light! Everyone get back to your positions!\u201dThe sound of guns being loaded, along with the sounds of running could be heard everywhere.Murphy also took off his jacket and took a knife and pistol in his arms, despite him being the boss.It was a relatively simple armament, but considering his physical abilities, it was sufficient.As a reinforced human he had the physical ability that was many times higher than ordinary people, but he never let that go to his head. It was as if he knew that there were so many people way stronger than him in this world.\u201cWho is coming? Mr. Warlock.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dOliver said while focusing his attention on one eye.He checked the minions which were placed a few hundred meters away, around the warehouse one by one. After checking every single one, he finally caught on to something. He synced his sight to the minion that sent the signal and constantly checked everything around the minion.It was late at night, and there weren\u2019t as many people as they were during the daytime, but there were still workers, vagrants, and beggars sleeping in the corner of the factory.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not one of them\u2026 Um!\u201dOliver saw something. Someone was moving quickly and coming towards this way through the building around the warehouse.Surprisingly, there was only one person, and he was radiating powerful magical energy, something similar to lightning from his entire body.Oliver had seen that kind of magic before. It was similar to the Lightning Wizard who attacked him in Wineham. The person who was rushing towards the factory right now was very much similar to the lightning wizard.And the strangest thing was, there was no tension or fear radiating from the person even though he was about to fight the gangsters. Rather, he was rejoicing it, like a child on a picnic.Underneath the joyful emotion was endless confidence that was hard to describe. He possessed an abnormal degree of confidence\u201cThere is only one intruder. It\u2019s a wizard.\u201d\u201cA wizard?!\u201dMurphy asked with a puzzled expression. It was true that there was a threat from the wizards, but he never thought they would make a bold move of attacking the factory.\u201cWhy? Is he here to rescue Herbert? Or did he come just to blow up this place?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but looking at the amount of magical power, I don\u2019t think he came to blow up this large warehouse. It\u2019s kind of hard for that person to destroy this warehouse, I think I can do something about it while using defensive spells. Don\u2019t worry too much, I\u2019ve placed some test tubes around this place.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dLooking at the gaze of Murphy filled with surprise Oliver asked.\u201c\u2026? Did I make any mistake?\u201d\u201cOh, no\u2026 So what should we do now?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. This is my second time fighting a wizard\u2026 huh?\u201dOliver suddenly stopped speaking. It was because the number of emotions around the wizard suddenly increased. He was sure that there was only one wizard who strode through the building, but when that wizard took out some magical device and operated it, the magical energy suddenly surged in the air, and 3 more wizards appeared out of nowhere.\u201cThe number of wizards has increased. Now there are three more people.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cHe activated some kind of magic tool, and two people appeared suddenly. Do you know what that was?\u201d\u201cSpatial magic\u2026? They must be belonging to the Spatial magic school. Fu*k! Why are they here\u2026?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy, what\u2026?\u201dMurphy asked urgently, but Oliver couldn\u2019t answer.It was because the situation seemed urgent because one of the wizards suddenly spread the magic power around the warehouse like a strand.It didn\u2019t do any direct damage, but the minute the strand disappeared by colliding with buildings and obstacles, the information about everything and everyone inside the building went to the wizard.It was quite a surprising magic to Oliver. He had always thought that the wizard\u2019s power was mainly their huge firepower, but now they used their magic in a way he never expected. However, his admiration didn\u2019t last long.As soon as the wizards figured out the geography and number of people in the warehouse, one wizard started condensing his magic into one hand.The amount of magic he condensed was not a large amount, but it was quite dangerous. Oliver had seen this type of magic before.\u201cMagic Missile\u201d\u201cThe attack is coming.\u201d\u201cEveryone! take cover! The enemy is attacking!\u201dMurphy shouted as loud as he could, even though everything that was happening didn\u2019t make any sense to him.When Oliver saw the condensed magic he thought it was some kind of bomb.It was not at a level that was intended to break a wall.\u2018Are they really thinking about blowing this whole place?\u2019As Oliver was thinking, a change occurred in the magical power used by the wizard.For Oliver, who did not receive any professional training, it was a bit difficult to express it, but if he had to put it in words, it was like a huge lump of magic power that was divided into dozens.The magic missile turned into a thicker bullet when the wizard used more magic.It was similar to Oliver\u2019s [Targeting], which targets the location where magic darts could be fired, except that, unlike Oliver, who directly targets people, the wizard targeted the coordinates of the person\u2019s location.Oliver wondered if there was any need for that.\u201c\u2026wouldn\u2019t that be inefficient?\u201d\u201cWhat? What are you saying, Mr. Warlock? You should also hide somewhere\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can stop it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dBefore Murphy\u2019s word could end, the wizard fired the magic missiles from the building hundreds of meters away.Unlike the magic missiles Oliver had seen in the past, it was difficult to visually judge the trajectory, but fortunately, for Oliver, it was not a big problem.TAK[Black Shield]When Oliver hit the floor with his quarterstaff, the test tubes that he planted around the building reacted to his Black Magic and released emotions.Then, at Oliver\u2019s will, every emotion turned into a black curtain that effectively blocked all the incoming magic missiles.BAM! BAM!THUD! THUDBOOM! BOOM!The Black Shield did not break, but the attack was quite more powerful than Oliver expected.Murphy spoke as he looked at the magic missile that was blocked by the Black Shield and exploded in midair.Oliver didn\u2019t know why, but he seemed to be taken quite a shock for some reason.\u201c\u2026 Did you just block it?\u201d\u201cPerhaps?\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we should let our guard down yet. It seems like blocking the magic missile increased the anger of the wizard.\u201dThe wizard whose attack got blocked was angry as the other wizards laughed at him.Everyone seemed to be not in a rush, and Oliver wondered what they had prepared to be this relaxed.He wondered whether it was because of the confidence that comes from being a wizard or whether because of the thought that unlike the magic power generated from one\u2019s body, the amount of black magic is limited.Oliver still had a considerable amount of emotions left, but it was obvious that he would lose at this rate. He had to counterattack as soon as possible. But the question is how to do it.The angry wizard regained his composure and started firing numerous magic missiles again.Unlike before, the firepower was greatly reduced, and it was not targeted, but the number of magic missiles was much higher, and Oliver once again defended the warehouse by deploying a black shield as before.He couldn\u2019t block them all because he couldn\u2019t predict the path of the attack, but so far he hasn\u2019t had any problems in blocking the attacks on the warehouse.It was then.PAKICHA sound different from that of the magic missile was heard.An unknown object entered the warehouse using the gap between the pouring magic missiles.It looked like an arrow, finished with copper on the outside, and embedded with blue magic stone in the middle.\u201cIs that\u2026?\u201dBefore Oliver could clear his curiosity, the magic stone lit up and spewed out powerful magic.The output was quite high, and along with it, a small crack appeared in the air, through which someone appeared.It was one of the wizards who was at the top of the building earlier.He came over here in an instant through the unidentified object.\u201cHello everyone! Nice to meet you and GOODBYE!!\u201dA huge explosion occurred around him with a loud sound. Explosions of pure magical power engulfed the place.The speed of activation and the power of magic was so fast that the workers around Murphy flew away without being able to respond.\u201cWhere\u2019s the Warlock?! I heard you brought a pretty funny guy\u2026! He really was pretty fu*king funny! Let me see his face-!!\u201dHis behavior was as relaxed as his emotions.He blasted his massive magical power without resting, destroying the guards and even the walls of boxes. Thanks to that, the warehouse became a mess as if it had been bombed, and a magic missile flew through the wall throwing the troops into a panic.Facing the wave of offensive firepower and the vast magical power, everyone felt fear.Finally, Murphy, who couldn\u2019t see this anymore, spoke.\u201cMr. Warlock, spread your shield and keep defending the warehouse. I\u2019ll catch the bombing maniac somehow.\u201dOliver stopped Murphy as he was about to move.\u201cMr. Warlock?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in charge here. Mr. Murphy, please take the others out of my way.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dOliver didn\u2019t answer Murphy\u2019s question, instead used black magic.[Creepy Scream][Las Bomb]Then, from afar, the sound of an explosion rang out with a scream.Kyayyayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayyayayayyayayayayayayayyayayayayayay.BOOM!The test tube planted near the wizard who had been attacking from a distance with a magic missile was triggered, and the wizards were struck and staggered as they were attacked by the explosion of anger and the laughter that shook their brains while breaking their will.The magic missile which kept coming from far away stopped.In the meantime, Oliver decided to take care of the wizard who was making a fuss inside the warehouse.\u201cNow that you have time, Mr. Murphy, please take the staff to the wizard\u2019s workshop. I\u2019ll deal with the wizard. It would be comfortable for me this way.\u201dMurphy looked startled, but immediately came back to his senses and obeyed Oliver\u2019s words. He instinctively knew what to choose.\u201cPlan B! Everyone! go to the designated place!\u201dAs soon as the order was given, the workers started to run away in unison.The wizard, who caused a disturbance inside the warehouse, shouted in confusion.\u201cWhere are you all going? You have to play with me!\u201d[Imprison]Oliver used black magic again.The test tube planted near the place where the violent wizard went on a rampage released emotions, and the mud-like emotions covered the violent wizard and bound him from moving.It was a black magic that Oliver used only once when he was fighting the paladins in the past, but contrary to what he thought, it was quite disappointing.Oliver was barely able to use this magic at that time, but still, he was confident that he could restrain anything, however, this one was so poorly performed that it was garbage compared to that.\u2018Is it because it\u2019s not my emotions?\u2019In fact, as if to prove this, the violent wizard tried to escape from the sphere with just the amount of magic power around him without using any spell.\u201cSomething like this\u2026! Something like this\u2026!!\u201dIt seemed that the restraints would be broken at any time, but Oliver had no intention of waiting, so he quickly used black magic.[Black Suit ver. 2][Burning Life]Oliver wore the armor made by combining Life-force and emotions and indirectly improved his overall physical abilities by burning the Life-force.Oliver narrowed the distance with the wizard with a tremendous speed as if he had changed into a different person.\u201cSuch a trick\u2026!\u201dBAM!The violent wizard caused a huge explosion and eventually got released from the restraints.Although he himself had suffered some damage, he did not mind, and he only had animosity towards Oliver.[Chain Explosion]At the spell cast by the violent wizard, a chain of explosions occurred, and the scale was so great that it engulfed not only the section where Oliver was running but also the surrounding area. There was no place to escape.\u2018With the defensive power of the black suit\u2026 No. Then I will be attacked once again.\u2019Oliver recalled Knuckle Joe and concentrated the energy of the black suit on his legs.And then he jumped as hard as he could.Oliver escaped into the air without getting caught in the explosion, and at that moment, his eyes met with the eyes of the smiling violent wizard.\u201cDIE You bastard!\u201dAs if he was aiming for this in the first place, the wizard once again used explosion magic on Oliver, who floated defenselessly in the air.[Mana Explosion][Targeting]Oliver, who was floating in the air, targeted the wall of the building and himself, and then increased the output.Thanks to this, he was able to avoid the attack by moving toward the wall.The wizard who kept attacking didn\u2019t expect this kind of move from Oliver and was bewildered.For a brief moment, there was a lapse in thought.The wizard stopped attacking.Oliver didn\u2019t miss that opportunity.He immediately concentrated his energy on his legs again and rushed from the wall towards the wizard with all his might.\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe Explosion Wizard tried to counterattack with a belated spell, but Oliver was faster this time.Before he could cast the spell, Oliver\u2019s quarterstaff slapped his face.With a creek sound, the wizard\u2019s neck turned to one side.Just as Oliver was about to finish the Explosion wizard with certainty, an attack came from afar.[Black Shield]BANG!The attack was blocked.Oliver looked at the wizards on the building, who came to their senses. He didn\u2019t know why, but they seemed very angry.\u201cUm\u2026That\u2019s troublesome.\u201dOliver shouted loudly.\u201cMr. Murphy\u2026\u2026can you help me for a moment?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMurphy appeared at Oliver\u2019s call.\u201cHuh, \u2026 did Mr. Warlock catch him?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe explosion was so loud\u2026 how the hell?\u201d\u201cI beat him with the quarterstaff. Rather than that could you help me now?\u201d\u201cOh, yes\u2026 tell me what can I do for you.\u201d\u201cCan you hold him as a hostage?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201d Maybe it will be helpful if we hold him as a hostage.\u201dOliver said with certainty. As proof of that, the wizards who were standing away from the warehouse were not attacking this place even though they were in a very angry state.Their emotions fluctuated with displeasure, shame, embarrassment, and anger, but at the same time, they also had concerns and fears about the situation of the Explosion wizard captured by Oliver.They were thinking that the Explosion wizard got caught because he was overconfident and attacked the place recklessly.It seemed like they never expected that they would be caught here. It was not because they were courageous, it was because they were not afraid.In other words, they were not prepared to deal with a situation where someone gets caught.\u201cThey won\u2019t be able to attack the warehouse as they did before if we have the hostage.\u201dMurphy and other workers who were previously soldiers, immediately understood what Oliver was trying to say and nodded.\u201cWell then\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the meantime, I\u2019ll be dealing with the wizards outside.\u201dOliver answered as he handed over the wizard.Contrary to the calm demeanor Murphy had shown so far, he treated the wizard carefully as if he was dealing with some kind of beast. All the people working in the warehouse were once soldiers, so they had a certain amount of courage, but when it came to wizards, they were scared to death.\u2018Um\u2026 Is it because they saw the power of wizards on the battlefield?\u2019Awe and fear were reflected when they talked about them.Oliver felt, maybe this was the reason why wizards go to the army. They wanted to demonstrate their powers and instill fear in people.It seemed like a groundless thought, but from the attitude of the workers, it didn\u2019t seem wrong either.Well\u2026, that wasn\u2019t important right nowOliver told Murphy, who was still uneasy.\u201cMr. Murphy.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, Mr. Warlock.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry to ask the client this\u2026but I have no choice but to ask you. We need Mr. Murphy\u2019s strength to protect the warehouse.\u201dAt those words, Murphy\u2019s agitation slowly started calming down. Oliver added a few more words to give him relief.\u201cI\u2019ve broken a few of his ribs, so it will probably be hard for him to move even when he wakes up. So don\u2019t worry too much. I don\u2019t know why, but the other wizards seem to care quite a bit about this wizard right now.\u201d\u201cI think I know the reason.\u201d\u201cYou know?\u201dInstead of answering, Murphy pointed at the Explosion Wizard\u2019s cuff button.The button was engraved with a picture of a roaring lion.\u201cThis is the symbol of the Lore family. It\u2019s a prestigious military wizard family.\u201d\u201cAre they war wizards?\u201d\u201cYes. As a prestigious family with many wizards, they actively participated in the colonial and continental wars and made many achievements. They also seem to be moving towards politics these days.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u2026.\u201dOliver sighed and nodded his head.\u201cBut why did they come here?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 Wizards have a very eccentric side to them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not eccentric. It\u2019s to save the Assistant professor.\u201dA strange voice along with a huge noise interrupted the conversation between Murphy and Oliver. As they turned their heads toward the direction where they heard the sound, colorful mana floated in a square shape.\u201cThis?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a communication magic [Speaker]. It delivers the will and voice with magic power\u2026.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026you seem pretty smart for a gangster.\u201dUnlike before, the noise was much reduced, and the voice was heard clearly. It seemed like a very young voice.\u201cI know you have kidnapped our Assistant professor. So release him right now, and also release John. If you do that, we\u2019ll leave without causing any more damage.\u201dIt seemed like the name of the Explosion Wizard was John.Everyone hesitated at the sudden words of the wizard, even Murphy kept his mouth shut.In an instant, fear rose in Murphy\u2019s heart. Nevertheless, in the corner of his heart, he also showed courage and was carefully calculating what would benefit him.Oliver looked at him without saying a word and observed.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe wizard spoke again.\u201cCan\u2019t you hear me, Scums? Release Assistant professor and John right now. If you refuse, I\u2019ll wipe every single one of you. But, if you follow my request, I\u2019ll leave everyone alive.\u201dWhether it was because of the one-sided notification or the voice that was young, his way of speaking made him look quite dignified.It\u2019s not just a simple pressure, it gives off a feeling that resonates with people\u2019s minds and bodies, creating a strong mental and physical pressure.For some reason it didn\u2019t work on Oliver, but, the workers in the warehouse were quite agitated by the wizard\u2019s remarks.It wasn\u2019t strange for them to show such a demeanor. Although they blocked the attack once, the magic missile and explosion magic were still life-threatening.The firepower the wizards showed before was enough to blow up the entire warehouse.Oliver looked at his employer, Murphy. Since he was the owner of the business, Oliver decided to do whatever he asked, but as Murphy looked around the mess, he felt more and more troubled.He was conflicted about whether to retreat or fight the wizard.To be honest, objectively speaking, the latter seemed like a nonsensical thing.The firepower on both sides was the same, but the range was not matched. After being unilaterally attacked, it felt obvious that this side would eventually fall out first.Black magic seemed less likely to win with limited emotions as raw materials.It certainly seemed that both in resources and firepower, the black magic was lacking compared to the real magic.Oliver looked at Murphy as he struggled. He was still in conflict.Oliver wondered whether he would back down or fight back.It seemed interesting because he was fighting a sense of humiliation, and frustration, as he would miss the chance of making money.At that moment what Murphy said a while ago came to Oliver\u2019s mind.\u2013 In this damn country if you don\u2019t have money, you are a corpse.\u201cUm\u2026 Mr. Murphy, may I say a few words as an employee?\u201d\u201cYes, what\u2026\u201d\u201cFirst of all, what the wizard was saying is not true.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re going to blow up this warehouse the moment you release both of them.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t very good news, so soon, Murphy and other workers in the warehouse were agitated.The speaker was silent and seemed to be listening to Oliver.Meanwhile, Oliver ordered the minions he had laid around to gather the emotions he had planted throughout the warehouse. He still had to drag a little longer.\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but they seem to be so angry that they don\u2019t want to just back off. Rather, if you release them, then they will attack you even more actively.\u201dAt those words, Murphy\u2019s eyes, which had been clouded with confusion, started to gain clarity.The speaker intervened.\u201cAre you saying that I\u2019m lying?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but your emotions and words are very different. You keep using your magic power to spy on this side.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026! A mere Warlock who works as a Solver feels the magical power of a Wizard. Do you think anyone would believe that? How dare a fuc*er like you say that you can see the wizard\u2019s emotions? That\u2019s too much even for a bluff!\u201d\u201c\u2026 It isn\u2019t a bluff. Anyway, that\u2019s my opinion. The choice is Mr. Murphy\u2019s. All I can say is, if you want to protect the warehouse, you must never let them go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMurphy was silent as if he had decided something.The speaker said\u201cHey, faker!! Do you think you can win just because you were lucky enough to beat one person?\u201dEveryone looked at Oliver.\u201cIt\u2019s true that I was lucky. But, it\u2019s my job. If my employer wants to keep fighting, then I\u2019m going to keep fighting, too. Well, what are you going to do, Mr. Murphy?\u201dFor unknown reasons, Oliver\u2019s words encouraged Murphy and other workers.\u201c\u2026 Mr. Warlock. You just want me to take this wizard as a hostage, right?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019ll be enough.\u201dThe speaker shouted.\u201cHey, YOU DUMPSTERS! Do you think we\u2019ll care about the hostage?!\u201d\u201cYes, you seem to care a little. Of course, if you are very angry, you will just ignore him, but\u2026.. We\u2019re in a difficult situation. As long as you try to save the hostage safely, won\u2019t the warehouse will remain safe?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we do this? I will go out of the warehouse, and I\u2019ll fight you outside. If you can take me down, why don\u2019t you go and negotiate with Mr. Murphy again?\u201dAt that moment, Oliver felt a cold rage simmering from the wizard far away.\u201c\u2026do you think that you, a FU*KING WARLOCK can defeat the Wizards of the great Magic Tower?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be hard, but wouldn\u2019t it be okay if I put some effort into it?\u201dThe wizard was furious, and Murphy\u2019s men covered their mouths in surprise.\u2018Did I make a mistake?\u2019A heavy, awkward silence engulfed the surroundings.Oliver was silent on the outside, but inwardly he placed the minions that had finished collecting emotions at the designated points.He has to play tricks like this to increase his chances of winning.One second, two seconds, three seconds.The silence grew longer, and as the tension reached its peak, a calm voice was heard through the speaker.\u201cOkay\u2026 Then I\u2019ll play with you, come over here. I\u2019ll let you know the difference between a wizard and a pest called a warlock.\u201dOliver replied.\u201cThank you for the offer. You are such a kind person.\u201dThe speaker was silent but filled with anger. Soon, the signal disappeared, and the communication was cut off.Oliver, who saw it, took out three test tubes, each with Life-force and emotions.[Black suit ver. 2]\u00d73He put on three layers of black suit and then pulled out more test tubes.He brought them with a considerable amount of money, and the end of each test tube was already visible. He might die if he didn\u2019t do this right.[Animal Build Up][Burning Life] x 3[Muscle Up] x 2[Endurance Skin]\u00d73Oliver used the emotions in large quantities to add all kinds of disease magic to his black suit so as not to die.Thanks to this, Oliver\u2019s body was surrounded by translucent darkness, and dark red energy floated above it.It was like a living shadow, and everyone in the warehouse felt nervous just looking at it.\u201c\u2026 Mr. Warlock?\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Murphy. What\u2019s the matter?\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s innocent question, Murphy nervously swallowed his saliva.\u201c\u2026 Can you defeat the wizard?\u201d\u201cWell? I guess I\u2019ll have to figure it out. I won once in the past, but that time I was just lucky too.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Thank you for your help.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s a job that I\u2019m doing for money, so it\u2019s fine. More than that\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cPeople trying to change something\u2026 I don\u2019t hate it. Can I ask you something?\u201d\u201cYes, go ahead.\u201d\u201cIf this wizard is from a prestigious family, is there a high probability that the wizards out there were also from the same family?\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s probably right.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Then we\u2019ll be in trouble if they die, Right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Honestly yes. It is much more profitable to catch them alive.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I see. Please hold on to that wizard.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dAs he was about to leave the warehouse, Oliver turned around and said.\u201cUm, by the way, don\u2019t worry about those things.\u201dOliver said while pointing at some of the minions that had suddenly settled near the workers.It was only then Murphy and the workers recognized the minions and were surprised.\u201cUgh\u2026! What is this\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I left it for safety, so don\u2019t touch it.\u201dThe workers could hardly calm down after looking at the minion\u2019s ugly appearance, which looked like a meatball. Then, Murphy said.\u201cYes, I understand. We will do as Mr. Warlock said.\u201d\u201c\u2026 thank you.\u201dOliver greeted Murphy and walked out.When he came out, he could feel the wrath of the wizards in the distance, and the wizards seemed to be ready to fight just like Oliver.RUMBLE RUMBLEOliver muttered as he looked up at the pulsing sky.\u201c\u2026 Lightning?\u201dA blue light flashed upon him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBlue lightning struck the ground with a flash. If it wasn\u2019t for Oliver\u2019s reflexes and the body that was strengthened with black magic, the attack would have landed on him.Oliver was able to dodge the attack thanks to a thin streak of magical power that came down first to find the target just before the lightning struck.As soon as Oliver felt the magic, he instinctively ran forward and was able to dodge the lightning by a hair\u2019s breadth.WURRRR!The ground shook as a flashing blue spark jolted on the ground. And a few seconds later, with a roar, dust scattered all around the place.With tremendous power, another lightning landed on the ground.\u2018This is magic\u2026\u2026\u2019Oliver continued to run forward while thinking about the Lightning Wizard he fought in the past.The lightning reminded Oliver about him not because he used the same lightning magic as the wizard right in front of him, but because the way he handled magic and the feeling he gave off was similar to the wizard in front of him.Oliver thought about the relationship between the two, but he couldn\u2019t think for long as the number of lightning that poured down kept increasing.\u2018It\u2019s dangerous. I can understand why Mr. Murphy and others were that much afraid of wizards.\u2019Oliver thought while looking at the ground filled with dents.An electric shock spread several meters the moment lightning touched the ground. In addition, there was a loud noise every time lightning came to the ground. The noise created great fear in the people around the area. As evidence of that, the people in the warehouse covered their ears while shaking in fear.Oliver used [Targeting] to climb over the building.The wizard who stood on top of the building looked down at the approaching Oliver and started attacking him, but Oliver avoided every lightning that came his way and approached closer to the wizard.He also didn\u2019t forget to replenish the emotions while rushing toward the wizard. He absorbed the emotion from minions that he had placed all around in advance.As the distance between Oliver and the wizard was cut in half, a bolt of silent lightning reached him.[Targeting]WSSHSHHHOliver pulled himself to the target and once again evaded the lightning.Oliver could now understand why the Lightning Wizard who he fought in the past didn\u2019t use this kind of magic.The magic was powerful, but it felt it was inappropriate for an individual to use it. It felt more like a magic that could take down a large number of enemies when attacked in a group.It seemed to consume a lot of stamina and could be avoided if the trajectory of the lightning was known in advance.As if confirming Oliver\u2019s hypothesis, the power of lightning has decreased a lot compared to the first time. It seemed like the lightning could hit Oliver only if someone grabbed his ankle.\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026? Black Shield.\u201dImmediately after using [Targeting], Oliver felt a mass of magical energy flying toward him and he opened a black curtain to avoid it.Three magic missiles collided with the shield.However, this was not the real thing. The coordinates of a lightning strike stabbed Oliver just before the shield was opened.It was too late to avoid.\u2018I wore three black suits, so I can survive at least once or two lightning.\u2019After finishing his judgment, Oliver quickly extracted the emotions and created a small minion to disturb the coordinates of the lightning bolt.He threw the minion to the side in an attempt to create an illusion that it might be him, and shortly after that a blue bolt of lightning struck.As if the lady luck was with him once again, somehow, the defense method that Oliver thought of on the spur of the moment worked, as the coordinates shifted in an instant, and lightning struck the minion next to him, not Oliver.Although it did additional damage to the surrounding area, luckily, thanks to the black suit, there was no direct damage to Oliver.The magic that was hovering in the sky also disappeared, and it felt like an additional bonus.While Oliver felt like he was at an advantage, a magic missile came in his direction. The magic missile was more powerful than the one before.\u201cDid he recover his power already? How\u2026Hate Bullet.\u201dOliver turned the emotion into a bullet of hate and then hit the magic missile.It exploded in the air with a loud explosion sound.From where he was, Oliver couldn\u2019t see properly the wizard\u2019s expression, but when he looked at his emotional state, there was a bit of a shock.Aside from that, there was one more thing that stood out.The wizard was drinking some kind of blue potion.\u2018Um, is that how he recovered\u2026?\u2019As soon as the wizard drank the potion, Oliver could see the magical power centering around his heart recovering at an unusual speed.Rather than a miracle drug that helps recover the magical powers, the Potion seemed more like a drug that put a strain on the body of the one who drinks it.While Oliver was thinking about the Potion, a magic missile that was way stronger than the one before flew toward him.[Targeting][Las Bullet]Oliver used two black magic spells at the same time.A black dartboard got formed on the wizard\u2019s body as a bullet containing a bomb of rage collided with the magic missile.As soon as they collided, the bomb of rage exploded in mid-air and canceled out the magic missile that flew towards Oliver.Soon, the whole surrounding got engulfed in the sea of smoke.As the smoke that obscured the vision cleared, the wizards on the top of the building panicked for a second, and at that moment Oliver used his black magic against the pre-set target.[Hate Bullet]Several bullets of hate poured out like bullets from a machine gun. The wizards were startled and deployed their shields to defend, but they could not completely block it, and some painful mourns were heard.The emotions of the wizards were shining with embarrassment and fear.The leisure they had when they first came was gone, and they couldn\u2019t believe the reality unfolding in front of their eyes.Oliver concentrated the energy of the black suit on his legs and jumped at once, narrowing the distance with the wizards.\u2018With melee battle, I might get a chance to knock them out like the explosion wizard\u2026 huh?\u2019At the moment, in front of Oliver\u2019s eyes, lightning-clad hands protruded along with the cracks in the air, similar to what he had seen in the warehouse.It was a fine hand without calluses. The hand that suddenly appeared covered Oliver\u2019s face and slammed him to the ground.Despite the huge shock felt on Oliver\u2019s body, due to the black suits, there were no broken bones.\u201cDare you\u2026! How dare you, a fake wizard\u2026challenge me!! Electric shock!\u201dAt the wizard\u2019s chant, Electricity covered Oliver\u2019s body.If lightning magic was a good attack against many, Electric Shock was an appropriate attack against one person.The wizard concentrated the magical energy used during the lightning strike on one person.The principle was simple and it was effective. As proof of it, the power of the black suits kept dropping.\u201cI\u2019ll roast you like this, you IMBECILE!\u201dAs the wizard shouted with rage, Oliver tried to move and counterattack, but the black suit did not move freely due to the power of electricity.Anyone would panic in a situation that seemed like a crisis, but Oliver calmly looked around and analyzed the situation.While the lightning Wizard seemed to have rushed in to wage close combat, the other two wizards who were next to him could not be seen anywhere.It would have been really dangerous if they cooperated and attacked Oliver now.When Oliver focused the power on his eyes, he tracked, where the other two wizards were.Just like the Explosion Wizard a while ago, they were moving toward the warehouse through magic.\u201cDid you see where my friends have gone? They\u2019ll sweep away all the gangsters who you\u2019re trying to protect! Die after them in despair!\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u2026Thank you.\u201dOliver thanked the wizard and then turned to the warehouse. As the Lightning Wizard said, the two wizards moved into the warehouse and tried to attack the bewildered gangsters.At that moment, Oliver gave a signal to the minions he had placed in the warehouse.\u201cMinions, please.\u201dAt those words, a small explosion was heard from the warehouse, and the condensed magic power of the wizards disappeared without any trace.The minions placed inside the warehouse exploded and spread the cling spider web all over the warehouse.It was a black magic that disable the movement of the body.Except for being weak against external shocks, it was capable of binding the captured targets perfectly, and it seemed to be the case with the two wizards.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe lightning wizard who misunderstood the situation burned with rage and anger.The intensity of the electricity that was jittering around Oliver kept increasing as the lightning wizard used all the energy he recovered using the potion!The black suits around Oliver began to melt at a faster rate than before.Even though the lightning wizard\u2019s anger made him stronger, Oliver just looked at him without clearing the misunderstanding by telling the truth.There were two reasons for that.The first was because the minion carrying emotions had almost arrived, and the second was because the wizard\u2019s field of vision got narrowed due to his anger.TZZZZ!With a creepy sound, the second black suit got shredded, and the third black suit started taking damage.Now Oliver indirectly felt the electricity.\u201cDIEEEEEEE! YOU FU*KING PIECE OF SH*T!\u201d[Imprison]As soon as Oliver ordered, the minion who came closer vomited out a huge chunk of emotions.The black and sticky emotions which got spurted out by the minion tangled with each other and turned into viscous mud.\u201cThis\u2026!\u201dThe lightning Wizard was taken aback by the turn of events.The bewildered expression of the lightning Wizard reminded Oliver of the lightning wizard he met in the past. He also paid no attention to the surrounding once he felt he had won.Oliver was intrigued by the really interesting coincidence.The sea of emotions became a whirlpool and tried to cover the lightning Wizard.The Lightning Wizard attacked the emotions and resisted, but was unable to exert his power as he used too much power to burn Oliver to death.Even if he attacked, the siege got lifted only for a moment, and the pressure grew stronger. In the end, the lightning wizard squeezed out his strength and tried to flee with a lightning bolt around his body as before.However, it was no use. As he tried to jump, the squeaky emotions caught his ankle.Oliver remembered the battle with the Explosion Wizard before.He broke free from the Imprison while blowing himself up, and it could be quite dangerous for Oliver if the same thing happened again, so Oliver continued to manipulate the [Imprision] as if his life was depending on it.He didn\u2019t just activate it, he continuously controlled it.The Lightning Wizard spurted electricity from his body, consuming all the magical powers left in him and Oliver manipulated the [Imprision] to devour the wizard. In the tug of war, half of the emotions used in [Imprision] got exhausted, and the wizard shouted with joy at the fact that he could win.\u201cA fake wizard bi*ch like you dare to stand in front of me!\u201dAt that moment, Oliver stretched out one hand in the air.Soon, the wizard\u2019s countless emotions such as the fighting spirit, anger, and embarrassment got pulled out.\u201c\u2026\u2026!!!\u201dThe Wizard got surprised, but, it only added the amount of emotions that could be extracted.[Imprision] became stronger than before and the wizard felt a wave of shock and fear. He felt like he was sinking into a swamp.Thanks to the wizard\u2019s emotional state, Oliver extracted his emotions more efficiently and strengthened the [Imprision], and the lightning Wizard lost all the momentum he had a while ago.Oliver didn\u2019t miss the timing and pushed the emotions, which swallowed the lightning Wizard at once.The lightning wizard was slowly getting exhausted, and at that moment, the magical power concentrated around the captured Lightning Wizard fluttered in all directions trying to break the [Imprison].The lightning wizard scratched the floor and spit out every bit of his magical energy.\u201cYour sh*tas* tricks would never! NEVER!\u201dOliver extended his quarterstaff and hit the wizard with the [Deep sleep] spell.The wizard resisted but eventually stumbled and collapsed.\u201c\u2026\u2026Whoa. It\u2019s hard.\u201d Oliver said with a sigh while looking at the unconscious wizard.Carrying the fallen Lightning Wizard on his shoulders, Oliver returned to the warehouse.As expected, the Cling web was spread throughout the warehouse, and everyone in the warehouse got tangled in it.The only thing that moved was everyone\u2019s rolling eyes.Oliver saw the wizards who were surprised to see him. Or maybe surprised to see the captured Lightning Wizard.Among the wizards, one was a woman with short hair and the other was a man with curly hair. Oliver put down the lightning Wizard and stabbed the imprisoned wizards with the quarterstaff cast with [Deep Sleep].With this, all the wizards were captured.Oliver sighed, thinking that he had finished his job safely, and released Murphy and the others from the Cling Web.He then asked the surprised Murphy.\u201cIs everyone fine?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because the other guys also said that lightning struck! wow\u2026\u2026 Seven times? Here, bang! Over there! Bang! \u2026. say it again! How did you subdue the wizards?! \u201dA boy talked to Oliver, who was a little far away from the warehouse so as not to interfere with the repair works.The boy\u2019s name was Milo Kimbell, the youngest brother of Murphy Kimbell.He went home with his Aunt Maggie before the wizard\u2019s attack, and a few days after the raid, he and his aunt came to the warehouse and heard about Oliver\u2019s achievement.From then on Milo hung around Oliver for several days, asking questions about the battle.\u201d I avoided the lightning, went forward, blocked the magic missile, disturbed the lightning, and then got close.\u201dOliver numbly explained what he did during the battle.He should have fallen asleep just listening to the explanation that felt like reading an encyclopedia, but Milo\u2019s eyes were sparkling more than ever.\u201cOh my gosh\u2026 that\u2019s great\u2026 I should have been here to see that. Aww\u2026 I missed it, Damn!!\u201dThe boy was filled with emotions such as ecstasy, longing, envy, and excitement. He believed in whatever Oliver was saying, and didn\u2019t have an ounce of doubt in what Oliver said. He would have even believed that the potatoes grow on trees if Oliver said so.In a sense, his reaction was normal, because, he had seen the magic tower wizards who were in deep sleep with his own eyes.And, by the way, the wizards were now transferred to a family with high status at the Crime Firm in exchange for protecting the Kimbell family.The help of the higher class family in the Crime Firm was indispensable to negotiate with other families and with the Magic Tower to which the wizards belong and to demand compensation for the damage.Some members of the Kimbell Family felt that it was a waste to give the big fish they caught to the top, but Oliver, the one who caught them did not feel disappointed.Of course, he felt disappointed that the opportunity to talk with the wizards had disappeared, but considering their emotional state, there was a high probability that they would start to swear at him rather than talk with him. He thought there would be another chance.\u201cSir Warlock!\u201dOliver turned his head at the loud voice.Milo, who was unable to control his excitement, asked.\u201cPlease tell me! How was it when you were fighting the wizards?!\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 well, I was a little scared and trembling.\u201d\u201cEh? Really?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou knocked down four of them by yourself, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThanks to luck, I was able to succeed. Everyone was careless and didn\u2019t care about me. I don\u2019t know what would have happened that day if they had attacked unitedly from the beginning.\u201dOliver spoke frankly about how he truly felt.It was true that he won, but the situation might have been different if the wizards had decided to attack together from the beginning.The same was the case with the Lightning Wizard\u2019s Electric Shock. If he hadn\u2019t been a little lucky, Oliver wouldn\u2019t have won the battle.Oliver then looked at Milo wondering if his words would disappoint him, but the boy\u2019s eyes shone with admiration.\u201cDamn\u2026. That\u2019s so cool. Is this the attitude of a strong person? Acknowledging the opponent\u2019s strength?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dMilo kindly patted Oliver on the arm and asked, Posing as a kid whining for a toy.\u201cSir Warlock! Can I learn that, too? The Black Magic! I can get money from my brother!\u201dThe boy\u2019s emotions shone with pure curiosity and desire.As Oliver was about to answer, a hand appeared and pulled Milo\u2019s ear.It was someone Oliver had seen before.It was Maggie.\u201cAh! Ahhh! Aunt! Aunt! My Ears! My Ears!\u201d\u201cStop bothering Sir. Warlock and stay away.\u201dMaggie said to her nephew with a tray in one hand.On the tray was a hot dog with chopped onion and pickles, along with french fries and a cup of juice.Maggie swung her hand strongly letting go of Milo\u2019s ears, who then walked away while rubbing his sore ears.\u201cWell, Sir Warlock. I\u2019ll come back later!\u201dAt Milo\u2019s words, Maggie tried to pull his ear again, but Milo had already run quite a distance.It became quiet in an instant, and Maggie suggested Oliver eat while putting the tray on the small table.\u201cCome on, eat something.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAbout eating halfway through the hot dog, Maggie opened her mouth cautiously.\u201cI\u2019m sorry if he bothered you, Sir Warlock. I\u2019ll apologize if you were offended.\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh, Mr. Milo\u2026 it\u2019s fine. I know what it\u2019s to be to have a lot of questions.\u201d\u201cYou are kind.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Everyone says that Warlocks are scary, but Sir Warlock seems to be a little different.\u201dWarlocks are scary\u2026Oliver thought of his Master, Joseph, and other warlocks.Marie, Peter, Dominic, Anthony, etc.\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Anyway, you don\u2019t have to scold Milo. I don\u2019t have anything to do anyway.\u201dAfter defeating the wizards, other gangs and Solvers who had been attacking from time to time did not appear anymore.When Oliver asked Murphy about this, he said, \u2018It\u2019s all thanks to the rumors about you defeating those wizards.\u2019Of course, there were a lot of people who didn\u2019t believe it and thought of it as a half-cooked lie, but they didn\u2019t dare to attack the place.Thanks to that, Oliver was earning money by just sitting and eating the food.\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cQuestion?\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Murphy said he was going to negotiate by handing the wizards over to higher-ups in the organization, what does that mean specifically? I heard that the wizard and the tower are going to consult, but I don\u2019t understand well. \u201c\u201cAh, that\u2019s what it means literally. The Mattel Research Institute to which the higher-up belongs and the family the wizards belong will negotiate about this matter.\u201d\u201cNegotiation? Are you talking about the ransom?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s also included. There are also other things like hush money and compensation for the damage.\u201d\u201cHush money?\u201d\u201cTo put it simply, it\u2019s to save face. Can I be a little honest with you?\u201d\u201c\u2026? Yes.\u201d\u201cWizards used to have great status in the past, but now their social position and reputation are at their peak. In the early days of Landa, they were in a position where they helped the capitalists, but now they are in a position to fight with that capitalists for supremacy. In particular, Magic tower has a unique position in the hearts of such wizards. They\u2019re also famous for producing great wizards of this time. What happens if they\u2019re rumored to have lost to a Solver?\u201d\u201cUm, is it a matter of pride?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a practical problem beyond just pride. If this is revealed, it\u2019s not just a disgrace, it\u2019s a matter of loss of reputation and trust. For example, in the case of undergraduate departments, grants and sponsorships will be reduced, and the competitive wizard family may even get pushed out of the internal competition. To be honest, attacking the warehouse is not a big deal. Losing is the big problem.\u201dOliver nodded.It wasn\u2019t something that he could sympathize with, but he got a rough idea of what she meant.\u201cThat\u2019s why we handed over the wizards to the higher-ups of the Crime Firm who can negotiate with the tower officials and the family of the wizards. Then they\u2019ll get a mountain of damage compensation on our behalf\u2026 Most of the compensation will be eaten by those higher-ups in the name of the commission, but we will also benefit greatly. To the point where our financial situation will continue getting better due to excessive expansion of business. In that sense, we sincerely thank you, Sir Warlock. I\u2019ll tell Murphy to thank you further for this.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I just did my job.\u201dOliver shook his hand. He had thought of making a lot of money, but only as the payment for the job. There was nothing more dangerous than free money.\u201cCan I ask you to do something else instead?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s request, Maggie asked kindly.Of course, it was a calculated favor rather than a favor with a kind heart.\u201cI think the workshop will be completed safely. Then, Mr. Murphy said he would give me an additional 30 million by the fall of next year.\u201d\u201cYes, I think it\u2019s a reasonable price.\u201d\u201cYes, but can I get it in a different form other than money?\u201d\u201cOther than money? What specifically are you talking about?\u201d\u201cLike I.D. or something.\u201dActually, Oliver hadn\u2019t planned on using the ID yet, but he thought he\u2019d prepare something like this in advance.Forrest said that a fake ID was not cheap. He said on average, it would be around 30-50 million.Oliver brought this up right now because he knew he had made a contribution.Fortunately, Maggie answered with a smile.\u201cYes, I think it would be possible. I\u2019ll try to talk to Murphy and get back to you as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Maggie spoke again.\u201cSir Warlock?\u201cYes?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Please take good care of us for the rest of the time.\u201d\u201cUm, yes, I will.\u201dWhen the contract period with the Warlock ended, the warehouse repairs and the Magic wine Factory were completed.The factory\u2019s production facility finally started operating with Herbert tied in chains, and the red steam generated during the production process rose up into the sky through a huge pipe.Maggie asked her nephew, Murphy.\u201cWon\u2019t we get caught because of this smoke?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Auntie, we have installed a vapor filter on the ceiling, so it won\u2019t be noticed at all. It\u2019s expensive, but still, it\u2019s worth it.\u201dMaggie nodded at her nephew\u2019s words and looked at the liquor, potatoes, and corn stacked on one side of the studio.And what stood out the most among them was the box in the corner of the warehouse.The box contained potions that were supplied directly by the Magic Tower.It was a miracle drug that treats any trauma in an instant. The problem was its price was very expensive.\u201cIf it\u2019s worth that much, wouldn\u2019t it be worthwhile to just sell it on a black market?\u201d\u201cIf we process and sell it as Magic wine, we will get a lot of money, which is not a small amount. There are only a few companies that make proper magic wine\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can use that much for months, right?\u201d\u201cYes, even if it\u2019s magic wine, it dilutes the potion a lot. The people above said that it would be delivered on a regular basis.\u201dIn the process of safely returning the wizards that attacked the warehouse, Crime Firm made a huge profit.They also received a huge ransom for the captured wizards and the hush money, as well as a promise to secretly sell potions managed by the Magic Tower on a regular basis.Magic Tower Potion was something that could not be easily obtained even if you wanted to, so it was a great thing just getting sold.Naturally, Murphy was not very convinced by the rewards but Maggie comforted him by saying.\u201cEven if it\u2019s a waste, thanks to that, we\u2019ve become safer, right? If it\u2019s just that, it\u2019s more than enough to support our production.\u201dThe amount Murphy received will hold up to three months\u2019 worth of production.Maggie smiled lightly because it was enough to supply magic wine to all of England.Their business scale could be compared to that of the influence of the Crime Firm.It was a pretty risky choice, but Maggie didn\u2019t hate her nephew\u2019s ambition.To run a company, you need not only money but also power.Originally, She was going to invite Dave to be their family as an exclusive warlock.She knew that a warlock with that skill wouldn\u2019t even look at the contract that won\u2019t be beneficial to him, but Dave looked a bit immature, so she thought she might as well just try to persuade him.For example, by handing over a stake of the company, or by giving away a certain percentage of the net profit of the Magic Wine Factory.However, when she was actually trying to put her plan into action, Maggie unknowingly quit it.She didn\u2019t know whether she was frightened by the warlock who defeated the wizards, but an unknown fear crept over her.She felt like some kind of monster was hidden under those foolish looks.She felt strongly that the monster should not be touched prematurely.So Maggie quit recruiting Dave.It was an uncertain risk, and it was too ominous\u2026 even though it was a relationship that was too precious to miss in this way.Murphy said as if noticing Maggie\u2019s thoughts.\u201cDid you talk to the Warlock? Did you ask him to become our exclusive Warlock?\u201d\u201c\u2026 No. I was going to, but I quit it.\u201d\u201cYou did a good job.\u201d\u201cWhen you talk about him\u2026you make the same expression like when you talk about wizards.\u201dWhen Murphy returned from the army, he talked a lot about the wizards he saw on the battlefield. Although the change in his expression was extremely limited due to the surgery to transform him into a Reinforced human, Maggie could still see the fear, and despair he felt.It was like being a human being, and feeling the indescribable sense of deprivation and inferiority when confronted with a superior being.\u201cWell\u2026yes, He defeated not one, but four wizards.\u201d\u201c\u2026.Did that person really knock down the wizards? I didn\u2019t see it, so I\u2019m having a hard time believing it. To be honest, he didn\u2019t feel like someone who could fight. Milo had been bothering him for hours, but he didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dMurphy smoked.\u201c\u2026well, warlocks and wizards are hard to understand from our point of view anyway. All you have to know is, we got his help at the decisive moment. He said he wants an ID, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen, I have to prepare for a first-grade card. It\u2019s expensive, but the profit we got from that person is greater than that.\u201d\u201cBecause he defeated the wizards?\u201d\u201cYeah, no matter how much you hide, in this field, rumors spread somehow. Some of the people above are already showing interest in knowing the truth about his identity. Well, after all, A warlock defeating wizards is an amazing feat.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s going to get busy.\u201dMaggie said sincerely.Although she didn\u2019t know much about the field, from the back alley pub to the Kimbell family secretary, having lived in the back alley all her life, the rumors she heard did not lose to anyone.In the case of a solver, the stronger the solver, the higher their price, and at the same time, the possibility of getting caught up in a commotion was also high.Excessive demands beyond one\u2019s ability, or dirty work that even the city is reluctant to do.If he was useful, politicians, capitalists, and other organizations that will try to exploit him will increase exponentially along with the bundles of money he will receive.There was nothing to be sad about that. In fact, it was such a world in the first place.Above all, she was curious, she wondered what kind of existence the warlock named Dave would be if he survived after overcoming all those hurdles\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter work, Oliver visited the Forrest restaurant on the 27th Street of District T and headed back straight to his accommodation.He was tired, so he was just going to report about the job and return right away, but he ended up returning faster than he thought.The reason was nothing but the absence of Forrest and Al.When he went to the restaurant, a different employee came out and welcomed Oliver. He said that Forrest was not able to come to the restaurant because he had some important appointment.When Oliver asked for the reason, the employee said Forrest went to a regular meeting at the broker\u2019s union in Landa and said he didn\u2019t know more than that.Oliver didn\u2019t ask any more questions since he just asked one reflexively.After a while, the employee brought a document and asked for a signature. Oliver signed the document as requested by the employee and left, leaving the official document that said he had completed the job.As soon as he formally filled out the paperwork, Oliver felt like the job was finally over, and the fatigue he had accumulated over the past month came rushing in at once.It wasn\u2019t that serious though, since Murphy took care of his bedding and meals, and Oliver had experienced worse life than this.Oliver was a little sleepy, and it felt like if he rested for a day, he would be refreshed as if he had washed up.Oliver arrived at the accommodation, opened the door, and entered.\u201cWho\u2026ah! It\u2019s you.\u201dThe inn hostess, who was preparing food in the restaurant, said as soon as she saw Oliver.\u201cYes, hello. It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s been a long time. Is your work finished?\u201d\u201cYeah, roughly\u2026 How was everything?\u201d\u201cHow was everything? Except for the increase in egg prices, everything was good. How in the world can the price of eggs go up?\u2026 Have you eaten anything? Would you like a meal?\u201d\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dAt that time, someone shouted.It was none other than the boy who works at the inn. He had a basket full of potatoes in his hands, and the boy\u2019s whole body was covered in dirt.He was surprised as soon as he saw Oliver.The image of someone suddenly came to Oliver\u2019s mind,\u2018um\u2026 Ah! Marie.\u2019\u201cRosbane! I told you to bring the potatoes! The basket doesn\u2019t walk on its own!\u201dAs usual, Rosbane was startled by the inn hostess\u2019 shout and began to move the basket full of potatoes.He had something he wanted to say, but Oliver did not dare to ask.The first reason was, he wasn\u2019t particularly curious, and the second reason was, he was busy as well as sleepy. So, Oliver climbed up the stairs and went into his room.He returned to his room after a month, but nothing had changed. There were not many personal items, and even if there were, they were put in a personal storage box.Although he knew from experience that the owner of the inn was not the type of person to go through the guest\u2019s belongings when cleaning, he was cautious.\u2018Um\u2026 even so, it\u2019s kind of weird to stay here for a long time.\u2019Oliver thought for a moment.It wasn\u2019t that he was dissatisfied with his life here, but after considering some of the information he had recently received, he thought it would be good in many ways to leave this place and find a new place to stay.Even if the price was low, staying in an inn felt like a waste of money in the long run, and he realized that it would be more profitable if he just rented or bought a house even if he had to spend a lot of money initially.\u2018I\u2019d rather buy a house on a long-term lease. It costs less money, and I would be less bothered. Above all else, I need a house.\u2019Oliver came to the conclusion that he needed a decent place to live, not a house as an asset.Above all, Oliver wanted to have some personal space.He wanted a house with a private workshop where he could experiment with black magic, and if that didn\u2019t work he thought it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to get a warehouse in a shady place like Puppeteer Glyph.\u201cEven if human bodies are not available, wouldn\u2019t the bodies of dogs or cats be okay?\u201dJust as Oliver was thinking of asking Forrest about this, he heard a knock on the door.KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKOliver turned his head.He saw the emotions on the other side of the door, and it was something he saw a while ago.\u201c\u2026 Rosbane? What\u2019s going on?\u201dOliver\u2019s words surprised Rosbane.A trembling voice was heard through the door.\u201cCan I speak to you for a moment, Sir?\u201d\u201cUm, wait a minute.\u201dOliver got up from his seat and opened the door.The anxious boy with green-colored hair was fidgeting while looking down.\u201cAh, hello.\u201d\u201cYes, hello. What do you want?\u201d\u201cSir, Madam asked if you are going to have anything for dinner.\u201d\u201cDinner? Umm\u2026 Yes, I will.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201dRosbane didn\u2019t go back, just stood there fidgeting, even more. His emotions were tinged with nervousness and fear, and his hands were shaking.A thin, yet tough willpower kept the boy standing.\u201c\u2026what? Do you have something to say?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe boy\u2019s emotions fluctuated even more.Resentment and frustration filled the boy as he struggled to stand up with his small, tenacious will.Then the boy spoke in a trembling voice.\u201cCan you teach me to read and write, sir?\u201d\\nIn the evening, Oliver ate and went out right away.He headed towards the marketplace where the gray market was located.It was a normal market that would be present in every corner of the district. Perhaps because of the sunset, the traditional market was colored orange, people were quiet, and the stores started closing one by one.Even the market was going to sleep when night came, but fortunately, Oliver\u2019s destination seemed to be the one that goes late to bed.\u201c\u2026 Oh my, it\u2019s been a long time, young mate.\u201d Said the old man at the small used books store.He was sitting in front of the store reading today\u2019s newspaper, just like the first time Oliver saw him.\u201cHello, Mister.\u201dOliver greeted the old man politely, thinking he should do this much since he had learned the knowledge about the world Tree from the book he had recommended.The old man smiled as if he liked Oliver\u2019s attitude.\u201cThe waiter boy has become more polite. Thank you, but it\u2019s too much for this old man, mate.\u201d\u201c\u2026? I read an interesting book thanks to you, so what does that have to do with being an old man?\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s innocent question, the old man smiled and shrugged.It was a gesture not to talk anymore about this topic.\u201cMore than that, what did you come here for? Seeing that you came from afar, it doesn\u2019t seem like you came here on a business trip?\u201dHe looked back the way Oliver had come. Despite his old age, he seemed to have very good eyes.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Can I make a guess, mate? Here\u2019s the reason. Maybe you came to me because you were curious about some of the contents of that book, right? By the way, it\u2019s a shame that you came with empty hands.\u201dThe old man spoke in a confident tone.Oliver answered honestly without any malice.\u201cNo, I came here because I thought there would be a good book to teach letters to a child.\u201dThe old man looked at Oliver without saying a word.He pretended to be calm on the outside, but on the inside, embarrassment was creeping up.Oliver looked at him as if he made a mistake, and there was an awkward silence for a while.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Did I say something wrong, Mister?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 no. Just stay still for a moment. I need to drink some medicine of courage.\u201dWith those words, the old man drank a bottle of wine from a brown bag. He took another deep breath, but still, his embarrassment did not subside.\u201cIt\u2019s a little better\u2026.I think. What kind of book are you looking for?\u201d\u201cA good book to study letters for a child who\u2019s about\u202614 years old? Maybe 15? It\u2019s for a child to learn. Um! It would be great if you have a math book too, do you have it, Mister?\u201d\u201cFourteen or fifteen years old\u2026 books to learn letters and arithmetic\u2026 it\u2019s strangely specific.\u201dThe old man said as he slowly got up from his chair. The old man\u2019s stiff knees creaked like a broken tree as he stood up.\u201cPerhaps, yes. But young mate\u2026if it\u2019s okay with you, may I ask why you\u2019re buying this book for?\u201dSince there was no need to hide anything, Oliver answered immediately after thinking for a while.\u201cThe kid who works at the inn where I\u2019m currently staying asked me to teach him.\u201d\u201cThe kid at the inn\u2026? Is it the innkeeper\u2019s child? Are you teaching him to lower the rent a bit?\u201dThe old man went deep into the bookstore and opened a huge book and asked. It seemed to be a list of book locations.\u201cUm\u2026 can you save rent like that?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cNo? He is just a kid who works there.\u201dThe old man grinned.\u201cTeaching without receiving anything? Why?\u201d\u201cWell? Because he asked me to teach him?\u201dThe old man stopped looking for the book and turned his head slightly. His expression seemed grim, maybe because of the darkness inside the bookstore.\u201cAre you telling me that you are teaching him just because he asked you to teach him?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026can\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that you can\u2019t\u2026 but it\u2019s kind of weird. Most people don\u2019t.\u201d\u2018Certainly\u2026\u2019Oliver pondered why people seem a little impatient when it comes to teaching someone what they knew and why he accepted the boy\u2019s request.He questioned his own choice.It took quite a while, and in the meantime, the old man took out the book that Oliver had ordered from the corner.It seemed like a very old book, and with a gentle wind, brown dust flew from it.\u201cFortunately, there is a book here. I don\u2019t know why it exists, but it\u2019s an old and dirty book. In total, please give me 10,000 Landa currency.\u201dOliver continued to ponder and took the money out of his wallet.And the moment he handed the money, he opened his mouth.\u201cBecause he is great.\u201d\u201c\u2026? I\u2019m sorry. What did you say?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a great kid.\u201d\u201c\u2026what\u2019s so great about him?\u201d\u201cHe has a lot of fear when he works at an inn every day, and when he was about to ask me to teach letters, he was so much scared, but he still asked courageously\u2026 I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to teach him, because, his will to learn is so great.\u201dOliver spoke like a three-year-old with a poor vocabulary.However, it was also the most candid answer, enough to convince the old man.The old man grinned and took out a pen from under the counter.\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d\u201cService. I\u2019m also proud of that little mate. He is very willing to learn. You are right.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dOliver thanked the old man for his kindness and took the pen along with the two books.When he achieved his goal, Oliver\u2019s mind became free.\u201cUm, can I ask you a question about the book you gave?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 After all, you do have something to ask me. Then why did you not say it back then? Why are you saying it now? It\u2019s so late, mate.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cOkay. What\u2019s your question?\u201d\u201cI read the book about the World Tree that you recommended last time.\u201d\u201cOh, You read it all\u2026 What did you not understand?\u201d\u201cIt is said that the world tree stores, manages, and prints information from all over the world, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes. What about it?\u201dOliver spoke as if he had already thought about it.\u201cThe whole world has different languages and texts, so how does the World Tree manage this? If it just leaves it as it is, it doesn\u2019t look like proper management.\u201dThe old man\u2019s eyes widened slightly, and he looked at Oliver, with a subtle but small admiration.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a pretty interesting question, mate.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. Usually, even the kids studying about it don\u2019t ask such questions. Were there one or two?\u2026 Anyway, that\u2019s right. Texts and languages are different around the world, and if you keep them as they are, it can\u2019t be called management. So the information stored in the World Tree goes through processing.\u201d\u201cProcessing?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s called \u2018code language\u2019. The World Tree processes the extracted information in its own way. The principle is not yet known, but all the informations are converted and stored as code.\u201dOliver recalled the unknown characters he saw when he went into the World Tree and searched for information on Forrest.\u2018That was codes.\u2019\u201cThen, how do you access the information?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to ask? Of course, you should learn the code language, mate.\u201dWith these words, the old man held out an old and very thick book.On the outside of the book, the words [Basic Code Learning (Part 1)] was embedded in bold letters.\u201cI can sell it for 300,000. It\u2019s such a precious book, mate.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There is nothing specific. The people from Districts A, B, C, and D seem to know something, but\u2026 they were not willing to share anything\u2026.\u201dAl apologized, but Forrest shook his head.Al was a capable guy, especially considering the fact that he was a slave brought from one of the colonies of the New World. This made the wizard\u2019s statement that the superior genes of human beings are predestined from the beginning, a big lie.It wasn\u2019t Al\u2019s fault that he couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on. Rather, it was because of Forrest\u2019s position, which was low in the circle.It wasn\u2019t an absolute rule, but the brokers were also ranked. Of course, most of them maintained a horizontal relationship, but there was a subtle power superiority like a leader created even when three people gather.The rank of a broker was determined mainly based on the customers they were dealing with.The closer they were to the Districts of powerful politicians and wealthy capitalists the higher their ranks, and the closer they were to the Districts of gangsters and beggars the lesser their ranks.Naturally, the influence and capitals available to those in the top ranks were completely different from those who were running around for pennies in lower ranks. The order of brokers was also divided by that difference.In that sense, Forrest was weak.He was a Broker from District T, which was filled with worker\u2019s residences. There was once a time when he too had the chance to settle down in the top ranks, but now, it was just a thing of the past.\u201cForrest!\u201dA man appeared in front of Forrest who was lost in thought.It was N, the Broker in charge of District N.The name N was not his nickname, it was a name he changed by himself after becoming the representative broker of District N.\u201cLong time no see, N.\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been a long time, Forrest.\u201dN, who had a big knife mark on his face said with a grin.Unlike Forrest, he did not become a Broker right away, instead, he became a broker while working as a Solver.Because of that, unlike Forrest\u2019s place, the brokerage house of N was more like a mercenary organization.N approached Forrest, looked rudely at him, and spoke bluntly as he sat down\u201cBy the way, tell me something. I heard some interesting rumors these days.\u201d\u201cInteresting rumors?\u201d\u201cCome on, Pal\u2026Don\u2019t play dumb. It\u2019s noisy these days, and there are rumors saying that you found a pretty good Warlock\u2026. Rumor has it that he even won against a Wizard, that too one from the Magic Tower, is it true, Pal?\u201dUnlike his rugged appearance and tone, his behavior expressed quite a bit of sarcasm.Even though it was frustrating, Forrest did not express it.The rumors in this field spread so fast that even Forrest who was away from District T knew about it.When he heard that there was a battle near the warehouse where the magic wine factory was being built, he knew that there was a high probability that it was a wizard.\u201cNothing is confirmed yet.\u201d\u201cOh, man! Is there anything definite in this field? How the hell did you survive in this field for this long, Pal?\u201dHow did he survive this long?Forrest asked himself. At that moment, he suddenly remembered the letter of introduction that he received from Kent.\u2018Is this some kind of fu*king joke fate is playing with me\u2026\u2019\u201cWoah man!!\u2026.so you ain\u2019t going to open your mouth? Well, all right, then I\u2019ll tell you an interesting piece of information. Hmm\u2026 It won\u2019t change anything even if you know right now, but still, it\u2019s better to know beforehand than getting hit out of nowhere, right, Pal?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, N?\u201d\u201cOh oh oh, look at this docile friend?! He responds back when he hears a story that is advantageous to him\u2026 What a cunning Pal!\u2026\u2026.. It seems like the \u2018cleaning season\u2019 is here.\u201d\u201cWhen you say cleaning season\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, the contaminated area is going to be cleaned.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand. There are still a few months left for the cleaning season, right?\u201d\u201cSuddenly, the number of zombies and contaminants in the area increased dramatically. So, the schedule has been moved up, and\u2026 that\u2019s not the problem.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cUnlike usual, they said they would hire mobilized manpower directly from the city instead of employing their own manpower. This season is our group\u2019s turn, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cA\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cB\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right again.\u201d\u201cC\u2026.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s great. What next?\u201dOliver was teaching Rosbane in the corner of the restaurant.Contrary to his expectations, Rosbane had a hard time remembering the letters.Originally, Oliver was going to teach him vocabulary and move on to grammar. But now, they were still stuck on the vocabulary.Although Rosbane\u2019s study speed was not fast, the boy\u2019s will to learn did not weaken, rather it only strengthened. As if, he will never miss this opportunity to learn.At that moment, the inn hostess, who was filling out the books at the checkout counter, shouted.\u201cRosbane! Five minutes left.\u201dRosbane was startled by the sound of the clock ticking.With Oliver\u2019s persuasion, he was allowed to study during the break times after business hours, but the hostess warned him that if he was late by a minute, he would have to take a permanent break.He couldn\u2019t complain because she had already given him a lot of concessions. So, Rosbane began to recite the next alphabet one after another.\u201c D, E, F, G\u2026\u2026\u201dAs his mind urged, the fear he had decreased, and the hesitation in Rosbane\u2019s voice disappeared. Thanks to that, he began to recite the alphabet one after another more fluently.Not only his reciting speed was increased, but his pronunciation was also clearer.He proved that he could recite the alphabet in less than five minutes.\u201cHow did I do? Teacher?\u201d\u201cYes, you were great. If you have a little more confidence, you\u2019ll learn even faster.\u201dAt those words, Rosbane\u2019s gloomy face brightened a little.Oliver\u2019s words lit up Rosbane\u2019s somber face.He just told the truth, and he couldn\u2019t understand why it made him so happy.Soon, the voice of the hostess\u2019 was heard once again.\u201cRosbane! Time is running out!\u201dAt those words, Rosbane ran away after taking the book and pen that Oliver gave him.Oliver also got up and headed towards the room, because he had finished today\u2019s work, and at that time, the hostess\u2019 called Oliver.\u201cHold on, Mr. Dave.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201c\u2026 First of all, thank you for the chocolate and flowers.\u201d Said the chubby middle-aged woman.The old man at the bookstore said, in order for the child to study, Oliver had to ask the hostess\u2019 permission and also advised him to buy the above gifts to persuade her.\u201cNo, I just wanted to thank you for giving Rosbane the opportunity to study.\u201dThe hostess\u2019 looked at Oliver with a suspicious look, and she eluded doubtful emotions while looking at Oliver.\u201cI\u2019m not the type of person to ask questions.\u201d\u201cYes, I know.\u201d\u201cBut now I want to ask. Why are you spending money and time teaching that child?\u201dIt was the same question that the old man at the bookstore asked, but this time, Oliver answered more skillfully.\u201cBecause I can teach and Rosbane wants to learn.\u201d\u201cIs that all?\u2026maybe?\u201dThe doubts in the eyes of the hostess\u2019 did not subside, but she did not show any signs of hostility or hatred.After an awkward silence, Oliver spoke.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, can I take my leave now?\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for taking your time.\u201d\u201cNo. Then, have a nice day.\u201dAfter saying that Oliver went up to his room and immediately got ready to go out.It was because today was the day he heard Forrest was returning.According to the staff, he would be back at lunchtime, and it was already past lunchtime.Oliver left the inn and headed straight to the restaurant.Oliver slowly got used to this street, and the people in the stands, selling apples or hot dogs, looked at Oliver and bowed or smiled as if they knew him.One such person was a beggar. He raised his worn-off hat and spoke to Oliver as soon as he saw him.\u201cHello, Sir. You look great today. Can you spare a penny for this poor friend?\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAs usual, Oliver took a small bill from his pocket and put it in his hat.\u201cOh, thank you! You will be blessed, sir.\u201dThe beggar thanked Oliver, and Oliver bowed his head in return.After walking in the streets for a few minutes, Oliver finally arrived at the restaurant.\u201cWhat?\u201dOliver saw the restaurant with a sign that said <closed> hanging in front of the door. The windows and curtains were also closed.It was the first time he had seen the Forrest Restaurant closed. Usually, Forrest opens the restaurant early in the morning and doesn\u2019t close until late at night.Oliver had never even seen the door closed.Oliver tried to go back, wondering what was going on.It was then.The restaurant door opened with a rattling sound.\u201cMr. Dave.\u201dIt was a calm tone, but Al took a deep breath as soon as he came out.\u201cHello, Mr. Al. You were inside. How did you know I was here?\u201d\u201cI heard footsteps\u2026. Did you come to see the boss?\u201d\u201cYes, but I thought it was closed. Can I come in?\u201d\u201cOf course. In fact, we were waiting for you to come.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026if it\u2019s okay, would you please come in?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll excuse myself then.\u201dOliver politely responded to Al\u2019s words and entered the restaurant.There were no customers inside the restaurant, but in their place, people who seemed like Solvers were seated.There were about ten people, and among them, there was a face that Oliver knew.It was Coco.\u201cOh, my God, Mr. Dave. It\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it?Coco looked at Oliver and spoke.Oliver simply bowed his head and greeted her politely, and she spoke half-jokingly as she looked at Oliver.\u201cYou\u2019re polite, and do you know, polite guys like that will have a hard time capturing a woman\u2019s heart.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes, I will let you know a lot about women if you ever had time to visit our store.\u201dHer words were half lies and half sincere.As Oliver looked at Coco\u2019s complex emotions, she asked.\u201cDid you also come because you were called?\u201d\u201cCall? No. I just came.\u201d\u201cOh, really\u2026 Al? You didn\u2019t even give this Warlock a pager?\u201d\u201cAccording to the rules, it\u2019s not yet time to give one. It was planned to be delivered soon.\u201d\u201cForrest\u2026that old man is very inflexible. Well, it\u2019s that inflexibility that\u2019s saved his reputation till now. But, he shouldn\u2019t be like that this time. What if the Dark Horse is stolen by another broker?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something that I, an employee can answer. It\u2019s the boss\u2019s job.\u201dOliver was at a loss, but he could feel a little bit of irritation and anger in Al.His loyalty to Forrest was extraordinary, and Coco also apologized as if she had noticed it.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I went a little too far. But understand me, Al, he\u2019s also a human, right?\u201dCoco said while looking at Oliver.When Oliver was about to ask Coco what she was referring to, an employee called Coco.She entered the Boss\u2019s office with a graceful smile while lifting her feather hat.It seemed like she had come to work, not just to play.As Oliver watched the door through which Coco went, Al spoke.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, can you wait a moment, Mr. Dave?\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201dOliver looked around. Every solver sitting around the restaurant was restless. Everyone seemed to have something on their minds.\u201cMr. Al, can I ask you what\u2019s going on? Oh, if it\u2019s hard to say, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cNo. I will tell you.\u201d\u201cHuh? Really?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026because it would be better if I explain it to you in advance.\u201d\u201c\u2026..? What happened?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Cleaning season.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCleaning season.It was said to be an informal event that takes place in Landa regularly.As the name suggests, it was about cleaning, but of course, it was not about cleaning using a broom or a mop.\u201cWhere is this cleaning taking place?\u201d\u201cIn a contaminated zone in District F.\u201d\u201cContaminated zone?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s a restricted area in District F. Dangerous contaminated creatures and zombies appear periodically at this place.\u201dDistrict F, was the Hub where many of Landa\u2019s research labs were gathered, and it was also a place where the high-class people lived.Oliver wondered why such a dangerous zone existed in the upper-tier, high-securitized District F.\u201cCleaning means dealing with the rampaging zombies, contaminated creatures, and mutants by entering the contaminated area. Cleaning takes place whenever the contaminated area possessed a high risk to the District. According to a secret agreement between the Brokers union and Landa, we occasionally provide manpower whenever it was needed.\u201dOliver nodded.Then, he looked around the Solvers. Everyone looked unhappy.This made Oliver curious.\u201cIs this job, an individual\u2019s choice?\u201dAl closed his eyes and shook his head slowly.\u201cNot this time.\u201dCoco came out, and then a few other Solvers went in and out. Finally, it was Oliver\u2019s turn.When he entered Forrest\u2019s office inside the restaurant, he saw Forrest with his collar loosened as if he was tired.As soon as he saw Oliver, he straightened up his clothes and returned to his usual form.\u201cHello, Mr. Forrest.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Dave, nice to meet you.\u201dHis words were half true and half lie.For some reason, he was having a bit of trouble telling Oliver something.\u201c\u2026 Did you hear what was happening?\u201d\u201cYes. I asked Mr. Al and he told me about the contaminated area and the cleaning season. Can you tell me more in detail?\u201d\u201cOf course. Please sit down.\u201dOliver sat down at Forrest\u2019s suggestion.Forrest, as usual, poured him a glass of wine.\u201cSo, you heard about the contaminated area and cleaning season?\u201d\u201cYes, I heard that it\u2019s a place infested with zombies and contaminated creatures.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s also a place where criminals who run away from society and dangerous Warlocks hide.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, besides that, it\u2019s also a dumping site where hard-to-handle corpses are thrown away\u2026that\u2019s the reason why zombies appear there on a regular basis.\u201d\u201cBut Mr. Al said it was a place close to District F? Doesn\u2019t those places have high security?\u201d\u201cThat may be the case on the ground, but not below.\u201dForrest pointed towards the ground.Kent\u2019s words that there was another city underneath the city of Landa came to Oliver\u2019s mind.\u201cJust because it\u2019s District F, not everything is perfect, every organization has loopholes. If you give some money to the city\u2019s defense forces, they let you throw corpses in the contaminated area.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 How come such a dangerous place formed in District F?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good question. There are a lot of rumors, some say it was the aftermath of a magic experiment, while some say it was the trace of a disaster that happened in the catastrophe era, but no one knows the exact reason.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s Landa\u2019s for you. Even if something huge and terrible happens, they would spread a lot of lies and crumble the truth like flour dough. Most people are busy and don\u2019t care about those things, so\u2026 Truth is more valuable and dangerous in this city.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Thank you for explaining everything kindly to me, Mr. Forrest.\u201dForrest smiled bitterly.\u201cI have a favor to ask of you, Dave.\u201d\u201cIs it about the cleaning in the contaminated area?\u201d\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know why, but the city officials named people for this cleaning. They said that the cleaning last time was not done properly because most of the people designated by the brokers were incompetent.\u201dOliver asked calmly as if the story had nothing to do with him.\u201cWas it true?\u201d\u201cAbout half? It\u2019s true that most of the brokers tried not to send their talented force since it was a dangerous job that paid practically nothing\u2026 But\u2026\u201d\u201cIs the cleaning not done properly, a lie?\u201d\u201cYeah, even though they were hesitant to send their talented workforce, they still send people who could do the cleaning properly. Because it will be checked, and if not done properly, the brokers get summoned by the city officials. So, everything went as usual last time, but suddenly they\u2019re forcing us like this. We have no choice but to accept.\u201dThere was a slight sense of resentment and helplessness in Forrest\u2019s emotions.Apparently, in the relationship between the city and the broker union, the broker union\u2019s position seemed to be trailing a lot.Forrest opened his mouth again.\u201cAnd the city officials asked for you.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYeah, it seems like they\u2019ve heard rumors about you killing a wizard. It\u2019s close to a rumor, but that alone is enough to make you stand out\u2026 Originally, I didn\u2019t intend to let you go on this kind of job, but now that the situation has turned out like this, please. I need you to go to the cleaning \u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Dave.\u201dForrest\u2019s words were sincere.He felt sorry for Oliver and felt guilty.Oliver found Forrest\u2019s reaction incomprehensible.Oliver wondered what was the problem with him even though he himself had no complaints about it.Above all, he was interested in the contaminated area after hearing that Warlocks could be hiding there.After thinking for a while, Oliver asked a question just in case.\u201cWhat if I say no?\u201d\u201cIf you break the secret agreement with the city, you will either be fined a huge amount or\u2026 I will lose my broker status. You will automatically become a criminal.\u201d\u201cUm, then I should participate.\u201d\u201cThank you for the wise judgment. Well, I will now explain some things, considering you\u2019ve accepted the request\u201dForrest said while pulling out a file. He didn\u2019t seem to want to let Oliver go empty-handed.\u201cPlease.\u201d\u201cOkay, let me make sure about one thing first. There\u2019s a lot suspicious about this year\u2019s cleaning season.\u201d\u201cSuspicious?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s strange that they are naming the participants directly, but above all, the timing is too early. It was originally supposed to take place 4 months later, but they suddenly notified us that it\u2019s happening now. It means, there are a lot of wild zombies in the contaminated area.\u201d\u201cWild zombies?\u201d\u201cYeah. I checked it with Ms. Coco and Heimdall. In the past month, the number of rampaging zombies has increased exponentially.\u201d\u201cIs there a World Tree in the contaminated area?\u201d\u201cOf course\u2026 Wait, did I tell you about the world tree?\u201d\u201cI studied.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI said I studied\u2026\u2026 Is there any problem?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not, but how\u2026? No, it\u2019s fine. Anyway, there is a World Tree in the contaminated area. If we knew that the number of zombies increased in the contaminated area. Then, we can guess three reasons for it.\u201d\u201cThree reasons?\u201d\u201cYeah, the first reason, maybe many people died this year, resulting in numerous corpses dumped into the contaminated area without permission. Surprisingly, this is a common reason\u2026 The second is, the black plague has spread and infected numerous people living in the contaminated area.\u201dBlack plague.Oliver read about it once in a book he got from the Dominic Family.It was a contagious disease that was caused by a mixture of numerous corpses, germs, and the energy of black magic, which turns people into zombies.It was said to be more malignant and fatal than general diseases, causing uncontrollable disasters in severe cases.\u201cWhat about the third?\u201d\u201cIn case a dangerous warlock suddenly established a nest.\u201d\u201cA warlock?\u201d\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t mean to belittle you, but there\u2019s no better place for a warlock than the contaminated area..\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dOliver nodded as if he understood the meaning.The contaminated area was a restricted area, meaning, it was a kind of free area where the laws and rules of the city do not apply.In addition, there were a lot of corpses. There wouldn\u2019t be a comfortable place like this for a Warlock.Even Oliver sympathized with it and wondered if there was a way to enjoy those benefits.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cUm? Oh, yes. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026Anyway, my current guess is that zombies have increased due to these factors. It\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s just as dangerous as the Districts Y and Z.\u201dIt was as dangerous as Districts Y and Z, which were virtually lawless places\u2026\u201cMr. Forrest, if it\u2019s okay with you, can I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cYeah, what is it?\u201d\u201d Um\u2026 I still don\u2019t understand why they are leaving such a dangerous place. Even if it\u2019s still under the city, doesn\u2019t it pose a threat to the city? Instead of cleaning, why not destroy the place?\u201d\u201cRight. That\u2019s how anyone would think. But sometimes, those common sense is useless. In the early days, there were voices for the complete extermination of the contaminated area, but not anymore, now, it\u2019s not just a simple contaminated area.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.?\u201d\u201cFirst, it\u2019s well controlled, and the lab can get decent samples from there\u2026Above all, it\u2019s a good place to throw away the specimens from illegal lab experiments.\u201dOliver understood what Forrest meant when he said the contaminated area was not simply a contaminated area anymore.It was a kind of field to secure the specimen samples, and at the same time, it was a convenient garbage place to hide illegal experiments.Because of its convenience, the contaminated area was left untouched.\u201c\u2026these are purely rumors, and there are also rumors that the contaminated area and District F have an unspoken agreement. As long as you don\u2019t go too deep, they\u2019ll never do any damage.\u201d\u201cWho made such an agreement?\u201dForrest replied with a grin.\u201cNo one knows. So it\u2019s just a rumor. Oh, look at me. Take this.\u201dForrest handed over a dozen documents.\u201cIt\u2019s the minimum amount of work that one person has to do when cleaning the contaminated area and the compensation for it. It\u2019s a sh*tty price, but it\u2019s better than getting nothing.\u201dOn the first page of the papers that Forrest gave, there were details about the minimum amount of work that one solver had to do.It was classified in detail, based on how many zombies were caught, and how many zombies or contaminated creatures were killed. It was said that if the quota was met, additional compensation other than the basic salary can be received.It was said that everyone had to bring the head of the zombies or contaminated creatures as evidence in order to receive the bonus, and also said that they would provide a magic bag for this purpose.It also warned the participants to be careful with the magic bag.It said that the participants should pay compensation if they lose or damage the Magic bag.\u201cHuh? What does it mean by capturing? \u201d\u201cThe literal meaning. If you catch the zombies and take them alive, you\u2019ll get money.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s cleaning, so why do you want to capture it?\u201d\u201cThey will be using it as a sample for the Magic Lab. It\u2019s an indirect request from the Magic Tower. So the price is four, no maybe five times higher.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dOliver nodded.It always seemed that way, and it certainly seemed that the status of the wizards here in this land was unusual.They had the power to indirectly commission the city officials.Oliver kept flipping through the papers.On the back was a document with an unknown map and black and white photos.\u201cThis\u2026?\u201d\u201cA brief map of the contaminated area and dangerous places and groups within the contaminated area are marked.\u201d\u201cDoes the city offer things like this?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s something made by the brokers, including myself. We worked together to make it. It\u2019s a crazy job, so we thought we might as well prepare for it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Amazing.\u201d\u201cThank you for noticing\u2026 Can you see the skull sign on the map?\u201dOliver searched for it.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the places with the most zombies and the dangerous warlocks. Those are the most dangerous places in the dangerous contaminated area. Be sure to avoid it.\u201dOliver checked the number of skull markings on the map.As Forrest said, there were phrases marked as zombie haunting area, Warlock family, and Looters.Oliver thought there would be no people since it was a polluted area, but there were also people living in that poor environment.\u201cIsn\u2019t it great to be human? There are people who live in places like that. But they are not the only ones who are at risk.\u201d\u201cUm..?\u201d\u201cWell, besides Solvers, the mercenaries who are active in the city are also participating this time. Be careful with them too.\u201d\u201cMercenaries?\u201d\u201cBe careful even with the other Solvers, it\u2019s rare, but sometimes there are bad guys.\u201dA glimmer of concern shone in Forrest\u2019s emotions. The odds were low, but it could be dangerous.Oliver nodded and asked.\u201cHow many Solvers are participating?\u201d\u201cNine people from my side, including you. Including the Solvers from Districts B, H, and N, it should be around a hundred people.\u201d\u201cUm, when is the cleaning?\u201d\u201cFive days from today.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You can use it to communicate directly with me.\u201dOliver spoke while looking at the communication device that looked like a beetle.\u201cA communication device?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s something that I bought from a friend who has excellent performance among the solvers I\u2019ve contracted with\u2026.. Originally, I was supposed to give it to you sooner, but there are also some procedures.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I\u2019m glad to receive it now.\u201d\u201cGood to hear that. Call me if anything happens.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026 Can this be used in the contaminated area?\u201d\u201cWell, no, that\u2019s going to be hard. I don\u2019t know the cause, but the contaminated area is sometimes subject to communication restrictions, so it won\u2019t work\u2026. Regarding the job, the place that\u2019s going to be cleaned will be decided after two or three days. At that time, I will call you.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand. Then, excuse me.\u201d\u201cWait, just one more word.\u201d\u201cYes? What.\u201dForrest didn\u2019t answer right away, instead, he took a sip before opening his mouth.\u201c\u2026maybe, there will be a meeting with the Solvers before you start the cleaning. They will explain about the job before sending in Solvers.\u201d\u201cUm, okay\u2026!?\u201d\u201cSome Solvers will approach you. Some might even use my name.\u201d\u201cMr. Forrest\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cYes, you have to make your own decision and don\u2019t trust anyone too easily. You get what I\u2019m trying to say, right?Of course, he remembered because this was something Kent also mentioned before.\u201cIn addition to zombies and pollutants in the contaminated area, I should also be careful against mercenaries and solvers.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll call you once everything is decided.\u201dSoon after, Oliver left the Forrest restaurant and headed straight to the gray market.There were still five days left before going to the contaminated area, but Oliver decided to prepare sooner than later.Oliver decided to visit the gray market introduced by Forrest and the underground gray market introduced by Murphy to buy the necessary items.The necessary items were emotions, Life-force, and black magic tools such as glutton bags.In Forrest\u2019s words, the contaminated area was not just a place for corrupted creatures to run rampant, it was also a lawless zone where wanted Looters and warlocks took shelter.Oliver was planning to visit such a contaminated area, so he wanted to purchase some useful stuff.If there was a warlock family, there was a good chance that there would be books on black magic or books about demons.That was why Oliver readily accepted the cleaning job.\u201cDo you have a bigger glutton bag?\u201d\u201cHuh? Bigger one?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOliver asked the warlock who was selling items on one side of the gray market.He looked old, to the point where it seemed difficult for him to even walk.\u201cThis is big enough. How much bigger do you need?!\u201dThe old man said in an angry tone, but what he said wasn\u2019t wrong.Gangsters, pickpockets, and thieves are the main customers who come looking for black magic items in these places.For them, a wallet-sized glutton bag should be more than enough.At best, they\u2019ll just put in stolen goods like watches, rings, and bills.However, What Oliver wanted was more than that.He needed a glutton bag that can store Books, surgical tools, work tools, etc. easily\u2026\u2026.So, he was in need of a large glutton bag.Oliver explained his situation and asked the old man if he had anything else, but the old man told him to go away as if he had nothing to sell.Oliver then went looking for a glutton bag in other shops in hope of finding one, but everyone shook their heads just like the old man.It felt more like the people here\u2026.weren\u2019t much enthusiastic about a bigger glutton bag.It might be a misunderstanding because Oliver had only been there once or twice.When Oliver was thinking like that, a man suddenly interrupted him.\u201cHey, bro!\u201dOliver turned his head in the direction of the sound.The sound came from the corner, the worst area to set up a stall.A chubby man came out of the stall and looked at Oliver cautiously. When his eyes met with Oliver\u2019s, he said excitedly.\u201cYeah, you!\u2026this way!\u201dOliver walked over to the man, not because he called him but because he was curious about him.The chubby man was smiling happily with his plump cheek on the outside, but his insides were trembling violently.Even at this very moment, he was constantly questioning himself, but nevertheless, he desperately mustered up his courage and smiled while pertaining to be calm.\u201cI\u2026have been watching you, m..man, it seems like\u2026 you are loo\u2026looking for a big glutton bag, right? Huh\u2026is it right?\u201dThe man\u2019s voice was shaking, and his face was sweating profusely.Oliver didn\u2019t pay attention to such things, and just explained what he wanted as before.After listening for a while, the chubby man took out his notebook.\u201cPlease explain again, bro. What specifically do you want, huh?\u201d\u201cI want a bag that can hold books and work tools. It would be nice if it could hold a lot, and it would be nice if it could be folded for easy carrying.\u201dThe chubby man wrote down Oliver\u2019s requirements one by one, like a professional, in fine handwriting.\u201cWhat is the specific size?\u201d\u201cSize\u2026How about the size of a person?\u201dOliver said thoughtlessly, but the chubby man looked up at him in amazement.\u201c\u2026are you serious?\u201d\u201cI think it can hold a lot if it is about the size of a person\u2026 Why? Is there any problem?\u201d\u201cNo, I think you\u2019re missing something.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cDid you think\u00a0 of the Glutton bag as something\u2026tha\u2026that can be used to carry around whatever you want like a magic bag?\u201dThe chubby man gave up on the man-made attitude and spoke in a more natural manner.\u201c\u2026is it not?\u201d\u201cOf course not! That\u2019s why amateurs are\u2026 Bro, it\u2019s not dangerous if the glutton bag is the size of a wallet. The glutton bag\u2019s danger level increases as its size increases.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dOliver was interested. He wanted to hear more, as none of the books he read had dealt with such a subject.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThe glutton bag is close to an artificial organism with an ego. That\u2019s why it moves on its own\u2026 When it\u2019s small, the size of a wallet, it\u2019s weak, so it\u2019ll follow whatever orders you give, but when it\u2019s as big as a human, it won\u2019t listen to what you say, got it?\u201dOliver recalled what had happened in the past, the time he met Forrest and became a Solver, his first stay at the inn.At the time, when he ordered the glutton bag to vomit money, it resisted.He didn\u2019t think it was something special, but it turned out to be something more interesting than he thought.\u201c\u2026you know quite well. That\u2019s great.\u201dOliver said sincerely.\u201cOf course, bro! I live on this, and this is basic.\u201dThe chubby man said as if it was nothing, but it didn\u2019t seem like he hated it.The artificial attitude he had created earlier disappeared without a hitch.\u201cThen, let\u2019s talk again. I\u2019ll try my best to match your requirements. You know what, bro, I have a knack for making magic tools\u2026 I\u2019m not lying, bro! I have been making this since I was a kid. What size do you want, bro?\u201d\u201cThe size of an adult.\u201dOliver spoke in a more confident voice than before.\u201cAre you serious, bro?\u201d\u201cYes, can\u2019t you?\u201cOf course, I can, bro\u2026but it\u2019s really dangerous. There are quite a few cases where rebellious glutton bags that had eaten its Master.\u201dRemembering the greedy figure of the glutton bag swallowing banknotes, the story seemed plausible.Glutton bag.Oliver thought it was just human skin and teeth processed with emotions, but maybe it was something more interesting than that.\u201cYes, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dThe chubby man sighed at Oliver\u2019s unwavering attitude. Now he seemed to have given up trying to convince him.\u201cOkay\u2026.but it takes a lot of time and money to make something like this. How much money do you have?\u201d\u201cHow much do you need?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 Including the cost of materials, labor, and risk allowance\u2026 you have to pay 3,000, no, at least 40 million. Don\u2019t even think about cutting it, bro.\u201dThe chubby man was very adamant at that moment, showing a glimpse of his pride in his abilities.40 million\u2026 It was an amount that Oliver could earn only after doing 3 to 4 jobs as a Solver. But he decided it was well worth the money, given that it was a necessary item and could satisfy his curiosity.Having made his decision, Oliver took out a glutton bag from his arms, then forcibly put his hand into its mouth and pulled out 10 Million.While taking it out, the glutton bag shed tears with a strange sound.CUCKUKOOOO\u201cHow about I give an advance payment now, and give the rest after the product is finished?\u201d\u201cReally?! Oh, no. I\u2019m fine, bro.\u201d\u201cBy the way, when can I receive the product?\u201d\u201cIf you include the time to get the ingredients and make it\u2026.. a week?\u201dOliver needed it in 5 days, so for him, it had to be done in 3 or 4 days?\u201cNo, bro. I have another livelihood, I can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cHow about if I give you an additional 10 million?\u201dAs soon as he heard Oliver\u2019s words, the chubby man jumped up from his seat and suddenly began to close his stall.Looking at it, Oliver asked.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a given, bro? If you say you need something quickly. Then I should make it quickly!\u201dTime passed.The chubby man kept his promise. When Oliver went on the third day, he received Oliver with dark circles all around his eyes.He made a human-sized glutton bag according to Oliver\u2019s order and gave him a foldable leather case and belt for storage purposes.It was a big expense, but it was worth it.It was the money he had saved for these kinds of things in the first place.Before leaving, the chubby man warned Oliver.\u201cIt\u2019s a tough one, bro. As its size is that of a human being, it has as much strength as a human being, and it\u2019s a lot more ferocious than a human being. If it attacks you, don\u2019t come and complain later, bro. I warned you.\u201dOliver nodded and thanked the chubby man.In fact, when he touched the glutton bag in the leather case that was folded over and over again, he felt quite a bit of rebellion and viciousness.It didn\u2019t seem like something that could be used easily.The chubby warlock spoke again.\u201cBe careful, bro. I don\u2019t want to hear that my first customer got eaten by the stuff I made and died.\u201dOliver nodded again and said it was fine.After coming out of the gray marker, Oliver went straight to the place that Forrest told him in the communication device.\u201cIs this right?\u201dOliver said while standing in front of an entrance near the contaminated area.District F had many large and strangely shaped buildings like a hub where various research facilities were gathered, but such places disappeared as they got closer to the contaminated area.Around the 500-meter radius of the contaminated area, it was being guarded by the City Security Guards, and unlike the shiny District F, it looked very dark due to the soldiers armed with firearms.\u201cAre you from the Brokers\u2019 union?\u201dFrom the entrance, someone appeared and talked to Oliver.Looking at his outfit, he was a soldier, and Oliver nodded while holding out the business card he had received from Forrest.As soon as he checked the business card, the soldier opened a small door and took Oliver somewhere as if dragging him.\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\u201cThe place where the solvers gather. Please follow me quietly.\u201dAfter passing several cement obstacles, watch towers, iron fences, and barbed wire fences, they arrived in front of a building.It was a bunker-like building that seemed to have focused on defense instead of aesthetics, and Oliver could see a lot of emotions gathered on the inside.It was filled with solvers.\u201cGo inside.\u201dThe soldier said to Oliver, and Oliver did as the soldier told him to.He opened the door and entered the building.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There seemed to be more than a hundred people who all seemed to be solvers.As if to prove that, every single one of them was armed with large and small weapons. There were people who were simply armed with guns, there were people who were armed with modified firearms, armor, knives, and iron coats, and there were even Reinforced humans like Murphy.Compared to the gangsters in District X and the members of the Kimbell family, everyone here seemed to have a unique personality.And even among them, there were some who stood out. For example\u2026\u201cAs expected, you have a good eye.\u201dA voice suddenly interrupted.Oliver turned and looked to the side.Standing there was a shabby man with a broad forehead, a slender chin, and a wart on his nose.\u201cYou were watching him, weren\u2019t you?\u201dThe shabby man asked as he pointed at the wretched man.It was the man Oliver was looking at, a man with stone hands.It wasn\u2019t a joke or a metaphor, it was literally a stone, and each stone had magical energy flowing through it in a sophisticated way.\u201cYes\u2026 what\u2019s that on his arm?\u201d\u201cHaha. Is it your first time seeing one? That\u2019s a golem prosthetic arm.\u201d\u201cA golem prosthetic arm?\u201d\u201cYes, golem prosthetic! It\u2019s a new product made by the Golem Guild, and\u2026 Oh, look at me, I have talked too much without even introducing myself, it\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019m Jaby. A Warlock.\u201dThe self-proclaimed warlock had a flattering smile like those who make a living with laughter. It was almost as if he was doing it on purpose to make everyone look down on him.Oliver looked at the shabby man for a moment and then politely greeted him.\u201cNice to meet you. Mr. Jaby. I\u2019m Dave.\u201d\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I talked to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026? Do you know me?\u201d\u201cOf course! Aren\u2019t you the dark horse who\u2019s the talk of the town these days? Someone from District T who was considered as the new hope of Half-Retiree Forrest.\u201d\u2018Half-Retiree? New Hope?\u2019The information on Forrest that he read inside the World Tree flashed through Oliver\u2019s head.He was sure that he heard something similar before, but he couldn\u2019t remember it.\u201c\u2026 What do you mean by a new hope?\u201dThe man who introduced himself as Jaby wiped the cold sweat from his forehead with a helpless smile.\u201cWhy are you humble? Or are you testing my intelligence? Aren\u2019t you one of the young dark horses on the rise? A dark horse who would bring a great fortune to the broker he was affiliated with\u2026 just like that guy.\u201dJaby pointed at another man this time, who was far away but still clearly visible.He was over two meters tall, a uniquely dyed green hair, and had a tattoo on his face.Jaby immediately explained as if he understood Oliver\u2019s gaze.\u201cDavid, the Druid, a prominent dark horse from District H. Since he claims to be following the new Druid religion, Enjoyment, he is being called a Half Druid. \u201c\u201cEnjoyment?\u201d\u201cOh, you don\u2019t know? It\u2019s a religion that was created during the battle between the old and new druid religion followers. An open sect that seeks to use the power of Druids to fulfill their desires. And because of that, they are treated as Half Druids.Oliver, who knew nothing about the existence of Druid, had no choice but to nod.Still, it was quite interesting, which made Oliver pay more attention to the man in front of him.\u201cYou know a lot of things.\u201dThe man smiled flatteringly.\u201cHa ha\u2026 It\u2019s my specialty. Thank you for the compliment.\u201d\u201cDo you know anyone else?\u201d\u201cAbout others?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dTo Oliver\u2019s question, Jaby hesitated for a moment before answering.\u201cThere are other dark horses out there. Do you remember the guy who had the golem prosthesis before? The one over there.\u201d\u201cYes, I remember.\u201d\u201cHe is Arthur, a Veteran. I heard that he was a veteran soldier who also received medals, and it was said that his arms were blown off during a war. He retired and lived like a rat while receiving a pension. But then he received a golem prosthesis transplanted and is living a second life as a Solver. He is now called Stonefist Arthur, and he has made a name for himself in District N. It\u2019s said that he wiped out a gang by himself in one night.\u201dOliver looked at the man named Arthur. Around him, there were about a dozen of solvers who seemed to have come from the same soldier background.Oliver had seen a lot of veterans in Murphy\u2019s warehouse, so he could tell them apart now.After looking at them for a while Oliver turned and asked Jaby once again.\u201c\u2026 Then who is the Dark Horse in District B?\u201d\u201cOh, did you know that District B is participating?\u201d\u201cYes, I heard that four Districts, B, H, N, and T, are participating in the cleaning. Druid David from District H, Veteran Stonefist Arthur from District N\u2026 So, do you know anything about Dark Horse from District B?\u201d\u201cOf course, that\u2019s him.\u201dJaby pointed towards a man who was sitting alone in a distant corner.The man was wearing a thick cloak with a hood.\u201cThat\u2019s the Dark Horse from District B. Sir Colin, who belongs to the Mattel Research Lab!\u201d\u201cHe belongs to Mattel?\u2026 Is he not from Magic Tower?\u201d\u201cYeah, he is from Mattel, but he\u2019s still a member of Magic Tower. He was just going out for a while to fulfill the school\u2019s teachings and build up his foundation. He was fundamentally different from us.\u201dThe man named Jaby was blatantly flattering Colin.\u201cSo, what do you say? How about joining him with me? If I introduce you, he\u2019ll definitely accept you.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t get me wrong. Contaminated zones are dangerous places. You know, what we\u2019re going to face are not just zombies and contaminated creatures. There are many predators who are looking for good workers like us. There are also Looters aiming for items or organs\u2026 So don\u2019t you think it\u2019s better to stick together?\u201dOliver looked at Jaby silently.For some reason, it was not easy to see his emotions compared to others, but Oliver was able to see his cunningness, even though it was blurry.Jaby smiled and said without hesitation.\u201cHaha\u2026don\u2019t stare at this insignificant warlock. I\u2019m serious. Druid David has already agreed to cooperate with Sir. Colin. It\u2019s the most efficient and safe group. How about joining us?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Can I ask you a question before answering?\u201d\u201cQuestion?\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Jaby, how did you get to work with such people as Druid and Wizard?\u201d\u201cOh ho ho\u2026 that\u2019s a sharp question. It may sound a bit questionable, but I know a little bit about the inside. Inside the contaminated Zone.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve participated in cleaning more than 10 times. So I\u2019m a little quick when it comes to things on the inside. A safe road, a place to rest. I even know where the zombies appear. So, I joined them in exchange for providing this information. So you can join us too. You\u2019ll be able to work much more comfortably and efficiently.\u201dOliver pretended to be concerned.\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I appreciate your words, but it\u2019s difficult to work with people I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cHaha. What\u2019s hard about it? It\u2019s about joining forces with strong people. What do you think I\u2019m trying to do? Yes, of course, I\u2019m trying to build a good relationship with the Dark Horse from District T, and it won\u2019t hurt to be friends with me. Even if I\u2019m not skilled, I\u2019m an expert when it comes to this contaminated zone.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was taught to think a lot when working with people I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking like a kid.\u201dA third voice intervened.It was the wizard from District B who came all the way to the front.He radiated magical energy from his body, which was purer and vaster than the wizards Oliver met at Murphy\u2019s warehouse.The air became heavy, and the solvers, who had been engaged in a strange war of nerves for a while also felt the unusual atmosphere and retreated.Regardless, the wizard continued to look at Oliver.\u201cHey, fake wizard\u2026 Do you think you\u2019re some kind of big di*k?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cListen, a fake wizard like you had an opportunity to work with the real one, but you declined. Just because you\u2019re getting attention like a whore don\u2019t think you\u2019ve become great.\u201dLike the wizards Oliver had seen in the past, he showed great pride in being a wizard.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not thinking like that. I\u2019m just doing what I\u2019ve learned.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe wizard came closer to Oliver and made eye contact.He had blue-gray eyes, and he was ready to take down Oliver if he could.He asked in a voice full of rage.\u201cI have a question. Did you really knock down 4 wizards from the Magic Tower?\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes turned to Oliver.\u201cUm\u2026well, it\u2019s something that happened during a job, so I don\u2019t know if I can talk about it.\u201d\u201cI think I know how to make a big pus*y like you speak\u2026\u201dAt that moment, Oliver detected the movement of magical power in the Wizard. He wondered if there was going to be a fight here, but then he heard the sound of trudging and weary footsteps.\u201cAww\u2026 everyone is in good spirits.\u201dA calm, yet strong voice came from the side.When Oliver turned his head, a city official in a suit was coming in with soldiers armed with exoskeleton gloves.He climbed up to the top of a small podium, then opened his mouth with a voice full of irritation.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s hurry up. Solvers.\u201dThe wizard thought for a moment looking at the official, and then returned to his seat.Warlock Jaby also followed the wizard with a smile and looking at that figure some of the solvers\u2019 emotions shone with jealousy, envy, and disgust.Apparently, the warlock who had teamed up with the Wizard was unsightly and displeased.The atmosphere started buzzing again.Without minding about those things, the official kept explaining.Although there were emotions of nuisance, he explained everything without omission about the amount of work that the solvers had to do and the compensation for it and the compensation for damage in case of an unexpected situation.\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s all. Do you have any questions?\u201dAs if they had promised, the solvers became silent without asking anything.When the solvers didn\u2019t ask any questions, the official tried to get off the stage.At that moment, someone raised a hand.It was a Solver with a large scar on his face, he looked like a man of malice befitting his appearance.\u201c\u2026 what is it?\u201d\u201c I\u2026 I\u2019m Chip from District H.\u201dAs soon as the people gathered heard the name Chip, they started muttering something.There were some who were vigilant, while others muttered nicknames.\u201cDemolisher Chip,\u201d\u201cPlunderer Chip,\u201dAs if he wasn\u2019t interested in what they were talking about, Chip continued.\u201cI heard that there are people hiding in the Contaminated Zone, and what happens if we hurt them when we sweep contaminated creatures and zombies, Sir civil servant?\u201dThe city official, who thought he would go without a question, answered with a bored look on his face.\u201cFirst of all, let me make one thing clear. There are no people living in the contaminated zone. Officially\u2026 it\u2019s a restricted area. So, you just need to focus on cleaning. There are no people living there, so there is no way anyone would get hurt.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cRemember that you have not officially entered this place. So you should be careful inside. Even if you get hurt or die, it won\u2019t be investigated and the city\u2019s compensation is still cheap. Do you have any more questions?\u201dThis time, everyone answered in silence.After hearing the answer, the official ordered the soldiers in a calm tone.\u201cThen, please check the number of people and make them sign the informal employment contract.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201dThe soldiers nodded and began to get the signatures from the Solvers.The Solvers lined up, but it turned out that they were not the only people who came here, Mercenaries also lined up along with them.Oliver lined up, signed the papers and took the magic bag provided by the soldiers, and entered the contaminated zone.As he went inside, the ruined part of District F unfolded before his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although they were abandoned by their original owners, new residents were nesting in distant alleys, in buildings, and even under the ground.There seems to be something strange about the place.Oliver didn\u2019t make his move right away, instead, he checked the map and photos he had received from Forrest.It was intended to understand the geography and move based on the situation, and at that time, a loud voice was heard.\u201cLet\u2019s go, boys\u2026\u201dWith a loud shout, a group of Solvers armed with swords, axes, and firearms started to move.The man at the forefront was a man who had a big scar on his face, and it turned out that it was Chip, the person who asked the official what would happen if he harmed someone.For some reason, it didn\u2019t seem like they were here to just catch zombies and contaminated creatures.\u201cYou better be careful.\u201dSomeone said to Oliver.When Oliver turned his head, he found it was Arthur, a famous solver from District N.\u201cHello? Mr. Arthur\u2026 isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cYeah. Didn\u2019t you ask about me inside?\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026 I\u2019m sorry if I have offended you.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that bad. Even if everyone pretended as nothing, we are after all Solvers that stood out. Anyway, It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201dArthur held out his stone hand with those words.Oliver, who found that he had no ill intentions, took his hand and to his surprise, the Golem prosthetic arm felt strangely warm rather than cold.\u201cAre you thinking of going alone?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBefore, I couldn\u2019t ask because the mood was not good. What\u2019s your specialty in black magic?\u201dHis specialty\u2026There was no particular specialty when it comes to Oliver. So, he answered vaguely.\u201cI specialize in firepower.\u201d\u201cOh, firepower? That\u2019s great. We didn\u2019t have long-range firepower on our side at the moment\u2026 How about it? If it\u2019s okay with you. There are several other Solvers from District X beside you who work with us.\u201dArthur pointed at the few solvers, around a dozen or so behind his back.The composition was quite diverse, including female snipers that wore silk hats, men wearing mechanical arms and goggles, and soldiers armed with exoskeleton gloves.They all seemed to be someone who made a name for themselves.\u201cAh, I hope you don\u2019t misunderstand.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look at those guys lightly just because they are following me.\u201dHis words were sincere.\u201cThese guys have earned themselves a name on this field. If the city hadn\u2019t ordered them, no one would have taken this low-level job in the first place\u2026 unless it was urgent.\u201d\u201cUm, I see.\u201d\u201cAs for us, our goal is to just fill the quota in moderation and get out of here as fast as possible. What do you think? There are some talented people here, so it\u2019s better to work together and finish it quickly.\u201dAll of Arthur\u2019s words were sincere.Everyone here had their own self-confidence as a Solver.The only suggestion he said to Oliver was to make it safer and more efficient, and honestly, it was a tempting one.Kent said that, while working he will meet a lot of Solvers, and if they aren\u2019t enemies then it was not bad to make some friends.-If you make friends with people in the same industry, you can hear good things and information.It was okay to get close to people, and it was good to hear information. There were people who tried to take advantage of him, but Arthur didn\u2019t seem like one. However\u2026..\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m very grateful for your offer, but I have to refuse.\u201dArthur was surprised rather than disappointed. The same was true for the Solvers behind him.\u201cWell, you\u2019re free to choose\u2026 and it\u2019s great to know someone like you. Let me give you a word of advice. Be careful of not only zombies and contaminated creatures, but also people. There are a lot of guys here who target people. So, be careful.\u201d\u201cYou mean like Chip?\u201d\u201cYeah, he\u2019s more interested in robbing residents and warlocks than the zombies. There are some wealthy people out there\u2026 there are also some mercenaries with the same thoughts, so it\u2019s best not to associate with them as much as possible.\u201d\u201cThanks for the advice.\u201d\u201cYup, I hope you get through this safely.\u201d\u201cUm, yes, Mr. Arthur too. Finish your work safely.\u201dAfter a brief conversation with Arthur\u2019s group, Oliver paused for a while and then started moving.Before he moved on, several Solvers approached him and suggested joining hands, but Oliver politely declined everyone just like before.Oliver\u2019s real goal to participate in the cleaning was to look around the contaminated zone and pick up useful items.It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to team up with Arthur and the others if he were to participate just to clean the contaminated zone, and Oliver thought he would have a chance to work again with them someday if he were to stick to his original plan.Uuuuuuuuuu!Uuuuuuuuuu![Hate Bullet]Along with the chant, bullets of hate hit the head of the approaching zombie.The zombie\u2019s neck got twisted like a chicken\u2019s neck making the head and body get separated. Along with that, the zombie collapsed and returned to being a corpse, and the only thing that moved was its jaw, in greed for Life-force.The naturally born zombies were very different from the man-made zombies created by the warlock. The zombies resurrected by the warlocks were just dolls that had no will to do anything unless they cast additional black magic and give orders, but the zombies that are born naturally moved on their own and constantly sought Life-force.Oliver read about this in Anthony\u2019s books, but it was just a description of the phenomenon and there was nothing about the cause.Oliver was curious.\u201cBut still, work comes first.\u201dOliver smashed the zombie\u2019s jaw with his quarter-staff and carefully placed the zombie\u2019s head in the magic bag given to him.Although it was only the size of a small bag, there were already fifteen zombie heads in it, and surprisingly, he did not feel any significant increase in weight.Oliver understood the reason why they said that even cheaper ones would cost billions.That was also the reason why the Looters hiding in the contaminated zone were willing to steal it, even at the risk of being attacked by the solvers.\u201cWhy is there no one?\u201dOliver looked around and muttered.In addition to safe roads and dangerous areas, cleaning precautions were written in the data given by Forrest, and among them, there were clear details about the Looters inside the contaminated zone.It said that they do not appear near the few hundred meters of the barrier that surrounds the contaminated zone, but once he crosses that point, he has to be on his guard.It said that they appear from time to time and aim for careless or injured Solvers, but strangely, Oliver hasn\u2019t seen them until now.Of course, it wasn\u2019t that he wanted to meet the Looters, but because he felt something strange.When he first entered the contaminated zone, he looked around with his warlock eyes, and there were only zombies and contaminated creatures, there were no living creatures.He didn\u2019t see anything even after going pretty deep into the contaminated Zone.The strangest thing was not just that.As soon as he entered the contaminated zone, zombies started attacking him, but all of a sudden, only one or two remained on the outskirts while the rest of the zombies all flocked deep inside the zone and could not be seen.He was not sure. The reason they wanted to clean them in the first place was because of zombies and contaminated creatures that had grown so much that they were trying to get out of the contaminated zone, but as soon as the Solvers appeared, they all rushed inside.Natural-born zombies were hungry for Life-force, so when they see a Solver, they should run toward them instead of running away from them\u2026 All of this didn\u2019t make sense.As Oliver was thinking about it, he suddenly remembered what Forrest said.-There is something suspicious about this cleaning. The cleaning should have originally started 4 months later, but suddenly, zombies and polluted creatures started to appear exponentially.Oliver wondered if some dangerous warlock was playing a prank, just as he said.Then he wondered if this was also the work of the warlock.[Hate Bullet]Oliver jumped up and fired the bullet of hate toward the floor.At the same time, a giant rat with yellow teeth appeared from the broken dirt floor and rushed toward Oliver.Jjijijijijijijiki\u2013!A mouse with an ugly appearance and a noise that pierces the ears.Oliver has seen it in the past.It was the contaminated creature called a naked mouse he had seen in the Freckle\u2019s hideout.Puck!The Naked Rat was shot down by Oliver\u2019s Hate Bullet, but Oliver did not let down his guard, he re-extracted the emotions and injected them into his shadow.Then he commanded the shadow to stretch forward, and he used Vine Shadow to catch the ugly dog and cat that were about to attack him from behind the collapsed wall, and then cut off their throat.It was quite organized that it was difficult to say that it was just an attack by some ferocious contaminated creatures.Oliver investigated the dead contaminated creatures by touching them.Contrary to his expectations, the mechanism used by Puppeteer Gylph was not seen in their bodies.\u201cIt\u2019s strange. Am I wrong? And was it only controlled by hunger?\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, can you come out? I\u2019m concerned.\u201dOliver spoke to the thin air.He got no answer for a few seconds, but after a while, someone showed up.It was a group of mercenaries hiding behind the building, about less than ten people, and one of whom was someone Oliver knew.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while. Mr. Knuckle Joe.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Dave.\u201dOliver confronted Knuckle Joe.He was someone Oliver met while doing his first job as a Solver.Oliver used the Vine Shadow to strangle the contaminated creatures and then put them in the magic bag.Fortunately, Knuckle Joe and his comrades waited with minimal vigilance.\u201cThank you for waiting.\u201dOliver wiped his hands, walked over to Joe, and greeted him.It was because he didn\u2019t see any ill or evil intention from them.Knuckle Joe looked at Oliver for a while and then opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026 Are you really that brazen in the first place?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBecause you are being friendly with a person you nearly killed last time.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 that\u2019s right, but I thought you would understand. I\u2019m sorry if you were offended.\u201d\u201cUnderstand?\u201d\u201cYeah, last time when we were fighting, you said you came into this field with some resolution, right?\u2026 So I thought it would be okay. It\u2019s all part of the job, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cWell, I hope you understand. That\u2019s the best thing for me too\u2026.and technically, it was Assistant Professor Herbert who broke his promise first and my employee was only exercising his legitimate rights. Anyway, I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201dKnuckle Joe let out a small sigh and muttered\u201cCrazy\u2026\u201d.It didn\u2019t seem like there was much more to argue about.\u201c\u2026what brings you here?\u201d\u201cFor the cleaning.\u201d\u201cI know you came for the cleaning. You must have come to clean the contaminated zone. My question is, why did you come here among the vast zone?\u201dOliver was silent.Joe\u2019s question was so sharp.The area around here was managed by a group of Warlocks called the Otul Family.According to the information provided by Forrest, they were the ones who collected the corpses and zombies dumped in the contaminated zone and converted them into weapons, and then sold them outside the contaminated zone.It was quite a unique skill, so Oliver planned to surprise them and steal their books and surgical tools.However, it seemed that Oliver was not the only one who had such an idea.\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I see. So, did you get the Otul family\u2019s books?\u201dJoe slowly shook his head.\u201cNo, it had already been stolen.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTAK TAK.Oliver headed towards the area of Otul family along with Joe and his group.It was said that in addition to dozens of members from the family, there were also residents (Looters) living under their protection, and it was safe to say that it was a small village.Nevertheless, when Oliver entered the area there was no human trace, and as Joe said, they seemed to have been robbed by someone.\u201cJust like you, we were also planning to raid the Otul family and steal their books and the technics they were deploying. As you might have heard, their skills are considered pretty good.\u201dOliver agreed.Aside from remodeling zombies, it demands a fair level of skill to be able to hand over the control of the zombie to a third party.It was true that they had some pretty decent skills.\u201cOkay. So, did you hire these mercenaries?\u201d\u201cNo, officially the mercenaries hired us, but in reality, we are collaborating. While we raid the Warlocks and Looters, the mercenaries will take the monetary loot, and we\u2019ll get the books and tools.\u201dOliver nodded.It seemed like a pretty good deal, that is if they could trust each other.Because of the nature of the contaminated zone, Oliver just didn\u2019t have the right person to protect his back.\u201cUm\u2026But there\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t understand, Mr. Joe.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cMr. Joe specializes in disease-related magic, so why do you covet manipulation-related black magic? Oh, are you going to study that as well?\u201d\u201c\u2026 No, it\u2019s not for me, I\u2019m going to provide it to my crew members. In the first place, even if I study other magic, the efficiency wouldn\u2019t be good\u2026.. Unless I am an insane person, I won\u2019t do something like that.\u201dAs Joe finished speaking, he looked at Oliver.\u201cUm\u2026 you\u2019re offering it to the crew members?\u201d\u201cYeah, because there are warlocks in our crew as well. We could help each other and become stronger.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dOliver was quite amazed.It felt quite impressive for Oliver, who had never experienced anything other than the Joseph family as a Warlock organization.Ironically, the family which got gathered to learn black magic and become stronger did not want the same family members to become stronger than a certain amount, and in fact, breaking this was considered quite dangerous.But the Fighter Crew helps each other to become stronger.He doesn\u2019t know the details, but from what he has heard so far, it seemed to be a more productive organization than the existing Warlock family.\u201cThank you for your kind explanation.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. I\u2019ve my motives for explaining this to you.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cWe are here.\u201dInstead of answering the question, Joe pointed forward.At the end of where he was pointing, there was a destroyed small shanty town, and the barricades around the village were mercilessly broken.Scattered pieces were all over the place.Judging from the damage, it could be concluded that it was not a simple zombie attack.There were traces of explosions in the building at the center of the village.\u201cJoe, who\u2019s that guy?\u201dPeople who camped near the destroyed village approached and asked.There were twenty mercenaries armed with protective gear, regular firearms, and a warlock.Joe told his colleagues.\u201cHe\u2019s Dave\u2026 Remember the time when I almost died?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026the guy who killed Nico and the Bigjaw?\u201d\u201cYes. That was me. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha.\u201dHearing Oliver\u2019s polite and sincere apology, the unknown warlock began to laugh.\u201cHahahahahahaha.\u201d\u201cHahahahahahahahahahaha\u201dFollowing him, the other mercenaries also began to laugh, and suddenly the unknown warlock took out a gun.BANG!The bullet passed right next to Oliver\u2019s head, and the atmosphere became as quiet as a mouse at the sudden sound of the gunfire.The friendly atmosphere suddenly disappeared, leaving only a deathly silence.After a long silence, the unknown warlock opened his mouth.\u201cWow\u2026.you got some balls? You didn\u2019t even blink\u2026 I guess you\u2019re not afraid of death, and that\u2019s what made you kill my friend?\u201d\u201cNo. I am scared of death\u2026 I\u2019m sorry about Mr. Nico and Mr. Bigjaw. If I didn\u2019t kill them I\u2019d have been the one who died that day. Mr. Nico failed to control his power and\u2026 Anyway, I\u2019d like to apologize once again.\u201dThe unknown warlock smiled and pointed his gun toward Oliver\u2019s head once again.\u201cCan I also shoot a bullet in your head and apologize?\u201dThe tension grew, but this time it was a bit serious.Oliver\u2019s polite apology seemed to have irked the unknown warlock.Oliver didn\u2019t understand the situation and looked around.The mercenaries were getting ready to fight Oliver following the warlock.Oliver didn\u2019t want to fight in a fight with no gain, and just then Joe intervened.The unknown warlock lowered the muzzle looking at Joe standing in front of Oliver.\u201cCalm down, Sam. First of all, I brought him here as a guest.\u201d\u201cGuest? This bastard killed Nico and Bigjaw, didn\u2019t he? Thanks to that you, I, and the others are struggling here.\u201d\u2018Um\u2026\u2019Apparently, the Fighter Crew wasn\u2019t a great organization either.When Oliver first heard Joe\u2019s explanation, it seemed that his colleagues were cooperating to grow together, but as he heard Sam\u2019s words, it felt like they were forced to come here against their will.Oliver wanted to ask them about this, but Joe and Sam\u2019s conversation was so serious that it wasn\u2019t easy to intervene.\u201cWe have to work with that guy.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026why?\u201d\u201cBecause he is strong enough to kill both Nico and Bigjaw, and almost killed me. You know there\u2019s something unusual going on here right now, right?\u201dSam hesitated for a moment as if he understood something, and at that moment, Oliver intervened.\u201cExcuse me. What\u2019s going on here, what are you talking about?\u201d\u201c\u2026 The cleaning this time is different from usual. It\u2019s also very dangerous.\u201d\u201cWhat part are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThe zombies usually run toward the Solvers as soon as they come in, but this time they are running away as if they were trying to lure them. And I don\u2019t see any Looters.\u201d\u201cLooters?\u201d\u201cYeah, if you go a little deeper, you would encounter one or two, but this time there are no traces of them. No, not just Looters, there are no traces of humans, we can\u2019t see anything except zombies. In addition\u2026\u201dJoe continued after pausing for a while.\u201cIn addition to this, I visited two other Warlock families, and they were also in a state similar to the one here.\u201d\u201cYou mean they were all attacked by someone?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s not zombies, it\u2019s something a lot more dangerous than that\u2026 That\u2019s why I brought you here and explained this kindly\u2026 Let\u2019s work together for a while.\u201d\u201cWork together?\u201d\u201cYeah. The situation seems serious, so how about working with us?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m a little confused. It\u2019s an unexpected offer\u2026 But why me?\u201d\u201cBecause you have the skills\u2026 it\u2019s not a bad suggestion for you either. In a situation where some kind of unknown danger is looming around, it isn\u2019t bad to have someone to protect your back.\u201dOliver thought seriously.Oliver couldn\u2019t understand the situation, but he could tell that Joe had no intention of harming him. At least for now.\u201cI believe you, Mr. Joe.\u2026\u2026 But, are you really okay working with me?\u201dJoe answered after a momentary silence.\u201c\u2026Uh, Yes. For some reason, I think you\u2019re not the kind of person who breaks his promise.\u201dOliver would have refused, but the original plan he\u2019d had turned upside down, and there was definitely something unusual.\u201cUm\u2026 In the process of working together, if we get something like a black magic book, how will we share it?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s a matter that we have to think about, but let\u2019s share it as fair as possible.\u201dJoe\u2019s words were sincere.Then Sam, who had been listening quietly, intervened.He asked him why he said things like that, but Joe said that the situation was serious, so strengthening the power was the first priority.Oliver thought for a while.A party to look after his back, and a promise to share black magic books didn\u2019t sound too bad.As Oliver was about to open his mouth to answer, a crackling sound echoed.Oliver looked at his communications device, but it wasn\u2019t his. It was the sound from Joe\u2019s communication device.\u201cWhat?\u201d[Kiik\u2026! Kiik\u2026! Fuck\u2026 support\u2026! Please\u2026\u2026. Kiik\u2026 Zombies appeared\u2026 Kiik! They\u2019re having weapons\u2026! Fu*king zombies are having weapons, guns.]Oliver doubted whether what he had heard was correct.The voice that came from the communication device kept saying that the zombies were wielding weapons and shooting guns.\u201cSh*t Sh*t Sh*t Sh*t Sh*t Sh*t Sh*t Sh*t GODDAMN FU*KING SH*T\u201dColin from the Magic Tower\u2026 No, to be precise, Colin McLaughlin from the Mj\u00f6lnir School of Magic Tower, spit out swear words.He entered the Mj\u00f6lnir school, a traditional school specializing in elemental magic, without hesitation under the determination to become a powerful wizard.The reason was simple.Because the essence of a wizard is power.In recent years, under the influence of industrialization, fields such as magic engineering, alchemy, life school, and golem technology have been in the spotlight, but he believed this was only a brief fad that would disappear in the flow of time.For Colin, the truth of the world was power, and for him, the Wizards were the epitome of power.It was because of their Power, the wizards who we once oppressed were respected and considered the Leaders of society today.When he came out into the world under the teaching of the Mj\u00f6lnir school, he once again confirmed that Power was everything in a world that was ruled by violence.He learned the dark side of the world that he had not learned in the Magic tower.He had seen with his own eyes how much violence rages behind a world that seems to be run by law and order.The knowledge gained from experience \u2013 an area that was never known to ordinary people who only read books in the tower. Colin was not one of them, he did not stop with just learning, he became a part of that world.He wiped out a gang in his first job, defeated a veteran solver in the second, slaughtered a warlock in the third, and defeated the street wizards in the fourth.Although he struggled with unexpected things several times, he overcame it with his natural talent and knowledge, and in return, Colin was able to gain a title called, Dark horse of District B, even though he had taken off the title, Wizard of the Magic tower.It was not bad.To be recognized for his own abilities.The customers with money and power approached him with courtesy and caution to get his help.All of that made Colin happy.Of course, thanks to that, he got put into the annoying cleaning job.A job he thought he could have finished single-handedly.But, for the first time, the world that went the way he expected didn\u2019t go the way he wanted\u2026\u2026.\u201cWhat is this?!\u201dColin shouted and fired a Magic missile.He had to use a complicated technique, but in terms of overall power and efficiency, this was the most effective.As Colin expected, the magic missile that was surrounded by flame magic collided with dozens of zombies and exploded, setting everything on fire.\u201cUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU\u201d\u201cGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU\u201dAs if to prove that the zombies were weak to fire, the zombie swarms were swept away all at once.If it was the normal world he knew, everything should have ended with that attack. But it didn\u2019t\u2026\u201cSir. Wizard!\u201dA Solver armed with a reinforced shield came to Colin\u2019s side and put on the shield.After that, there was a small explosion.The shield that was deployed prevented Colin from the explosion, and to Colin\u2019s surprise, it was a zombie that threw a bomb at the opening.It would have been fortunate if it had ended with just that.\u201cWizard. Are you O\u2026.\u201dBANG!From a distance, a zombie with a sniper rifle fired and hit the Solver who helped Colin, in the head.The zombie was fresh as if it had died a while ago, yet it succeeded in sniping.The zombie even reloaded the rifle to shoot again.[Magic Missile]Colin fired a magic missile at the zombie that was holding a rifle on top of a building and knocked it down.\u201cGUUUUUUUU!\u201d\u201cSir. Wizard\u2026! I think we should step back.\u201d said one solver who got exhausted from fighting for nearly two hours.Colin agreed.The zombies were definitely not a big deal, but the problem was that there were too many.\u201cBear\u2019s forearm!\u201dDruid David borrowed the power of nature and blew up a horde of zombies armed with clubs and guns with tremendous might at once.Zombies armed with clubs and guns\u2026 Everyone felt the situation as some kind of vicious joke.\u201cEveryone this way! Zombies are coming again!\u201dAt David\u2019s call, everyone rushed in his direction.Everything felt really weird.Up to the outskirts, there were only small zombie swarms, but suddenly zombies swarmed in from all directions.It was as if they were waiting.\u201cDamn\u2026! They are already chasing us from behind. Zombies!\u201d\u201cHold on! I found a safe place\u2026 There it is!\u201dThe safe zone that Druid David found was a building inside the contaminated zone, with high walls around it, and the only way to get in was the way through which Colin and the others had entered.Colin, who secured the safety of the side and rear, extracted his mana and gathered Magic in the air.Then, he entered the formula to create a magic circle, and at that moment, a swarm of zombies chasing the group from behind appeared.There were almost a hundred of them.There was even a corpse golem that had been modified by weaving several zombies together.[Flame Thrower]Powerful flames got sprayed from the magic circle created in the air along with the chant.The red flame mercilessly burned the zombie swarm in front of the group and turned them into ashes in an instant.After barely escaping from a horde of zombies armed with knives and guns, Colin sighed and finally came to his senses and headed toward someone.It was none other than the fake wizard who brought him here.\u201cHey, you\u2026 how the hell did this happen? How the FU*K did this happen!\u201dThe warlock named Jaby mumbled with a frightened expression on his face.Thanks to that, his shabby appearance looked even more shabby.\u201cUhhhhhh, Sir. Warlock. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been here more than ten times, but this\u2026 this is the first time this has happened\u2026 I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry!\u201dTo Colin\u2019s surprise, he burst into tears. Looking at his pitiful appearance even made the anger inside him disappear.At that moment, a solver came forward after clearing his mind.\u201cHmm\u2026Mr. Wizard. I agree that this is a strange case. I also participated in the cleaning three times, but this\u2026. is something I\u2019m seeing for the first time.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about zombies that shoot and throw bombs?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before. There are too many of them. No\u2026 there were a lot previously too, but they weren\u2019t organized like this.\u201dColin tacitly agreed.Naturally occurring zombies were nothing more than evil, inferior beings greedy for Life-force.It made no sense for them to use such an organized movement.There was only one thing that could explain this case.Warlocks.It seemed not only Colin but also other solvers came to the same conclusion.However, the mere fact a Wizard like him was being hunted by fake Wizards made Colin\u2019s emotions boil up.\u201c\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s probably a Manipulation-type.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s someone behind this, then it would definitely be manipulation-type warlocks, those guys are the only ones who can control zombies like that. Those annoying fu*kers.\u201dManipulation-type warlocks were the type who hides in a safe place and sends only zombies to target their opponents.A textbook example of cowardly guys.\u201cThis\u2026. this is not about cleaning anymore. Looking at the systematically moving zombies, it must be a group of warlocks rather than an individual. Maybe it\u2019s a group of demon worshipers\u2026 We should report this and make the city move its forces.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true, but the problem is how to get there. Zombies are swarming everywhere. It seems like some solvers have already been hit.\u201d\u201cIf we take a breather here and move\u2014\u201d\u201cNo, there is no time for that.\u201dDruid David spoke with his hand on the ground.He was listening to the earth\u2019s voice to detect who was around, and his expression darkened sharply as time passed.\u201cThe zombies are flocking this way and a lot of them\u2026 it\u2019s not just zombies, there are corpse golems and even contaminated creatures.\u201dAt those words, the solvers who were suffering from fatigue and fear were agitated, including ColinAs a Wizard Colin needed some time to recover his mana, but at this rate, both his mana and stamina would dry out.CREEEEKEveryone\u2019s attention got drawn toward the sound of the door.Jaby, who was on one side of the building, opened an old secret door and said.\u201c\u2026for now, how about running away from here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When the screams were heard, the zombies that were coming toward Oliver\u2019s direction stopped and all moved to the place where Creepy Scream was heard.As Oliver nodded, Joe and the mercenaries armed with swords, axes, and shovels began to sweep the hordes of zombies that had barely survived the explosion, with no difficulty.The scary thing about the zombies was, they were in an overwhelming amount.Oliver opened his mouth after shattering a few of the heads of the Zombies.\u201cI think it would be good to move quickly. I dispersed them with [Creepy Scream], but once they found there is no one, they will come back here again. I think the zombies here are all smart.\u201dThe mercenaries just nodded their heads without showing any reaction to those words, but the expressions of the warlocks, including Joe, were unusual.It was basic common sense that zombies are stupid, and the words zombies and smart doesn\u2019t fit in the same sentence. It couldn\u2019t be even considered a pun.And if it wasn\u2019t a pun, it was meant to be a terrible disaster.At this moment, Joe and his party including Oliver were in the middle of such a disaster.Oliver decided to help Joe and his party to see whether zombies were really attacking the solvers with weapons, and somehow he was able to confirm that it was true.\u201cAll right, then let\u2019s move again.\u201dEveryone started walking at those words.The place they were currently going to was where Joe\u2019s other colleagues are, and according to the communication device, they are currently in an abandoned building inside the contaminated zone.The voice that came from the communication device said that they were attacked by a swarm of zombies while searching for the Looters and warlocks hiding in the contaminated zone and were forced to defend themselves.It seemed like a pretty dire situation.Each zombie was not a big deal, but as their number increased, the danger increases exponentially.They were in a state where they only had supplies that they prepared for simple cleaning.If the bullet and emotions were consumed, they would have to fight the zombies with their bare hands, which was no different from telling them to die.\u201cNo matter how you look at this, it seems like we are being hunted\u2026 and it\u2019s pretty well-organized.\u201dAs Oliver was figuring out the situation, Joe came up to him and said,\u201cFirst of all, let me say thank you. For following me willingly.\u201d\u201cNo. I was just curious to see the zombies attacking with weapons, that\u2019s why I followed you.\u201d\u201cWell, okay\u2026 So, what do you think about this? Zombies forming troops, wielding weapons, and moving systematically?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly not a normal case.\u201dOliver said with a very euphemistic expression.Even if the zombies were given orders, they could basically only attack and wait, but looking at them moving like this, they seemed more like beasts.The bigger threat was not the fact that zombies wielding weapons, it was them wielding weapons skillfully.A simple command was enough to make them attack someone, but to make them use the weapons skillfully, continuous and precise control was needed, which could not be done without a considerable number of warlocks.With those thoughts in mind, Joe asked.\u201cHow many do you think are there?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201dOliver thought for a while.According to Anthony\u2019s research book, giving and managing such detailed orders was possible only with a senior disciple, and the average limit that one senior disciple can handle was 20. If it goes beyond that, the movement of the zombies becomes sloppy, and their efficiency decreases.\u201cThere are more than a hundred or two hundred zombies we saw as we passed by\u2026 Then, does that mean that there will be at least dozens of warlocks targeting us?\u201d\u201cUm? I don\u2019t know the details either\u2026 But, that would be the case only if we are lucky.\u201d\u201cIf we are lucky?\u201dAt that moment, a mercenary shouted a little.\u201cEveryone, stop! We\u2019ve arrived there.\u201dAt that shout, Joe and Oliver, who were moving quietly, stopped.As the communication device said, hundreds of zombies were surrounding a huge building, and the problem was that they were not just screaming and messing around, but they were attacking properly.It was an unbelievable sight.Some zombies were pulling a ladder and trying to climb the building, there were ones that went to the top of the next building and tried to jump from there, and there were zombies that were trying to break windows and doors with axes and sledgehammers.\u201cFu*k\u2026 am I dreaming or something? Are we at war with those hordes of zombies?\u201dA mercenary said as if he was exhausted mentally.Anyone would have said that if they saw hundreds of zombies moving like an army. It was a natural reaction.Oliver also wondered how that was possible, and at that moment, he detected something.Oliver looked back.\u201cUm\u2026?\u201dSomething was detected under the ground at a distance of about 200 meters.It was a large number of zombies who awakened suddenly.\u201cFirst of all, we need to plan a strategy. Does anyone have a good idea?\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t think there will be time for that.\u201d\u201cLook at this guy\u2026 Thank you for your help, but don\u2019t try to act like our boss.\u201d\u201cAh, sorry. The reason I said this, is because of the number of zombies that are behind us now. There is quite a lot.\u201dAt that moment, one zombie moved and pulled another, and slowly one after another the zombies started to come up to the ground.It seemed like they were positioned here from the beginning to attack those who came to help.\u201cWhat, what? What now?\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201dJoe calmed the bewildered mercenary and focused his energy on his eyes like Oliver. The other warlocks also activated their warlock eyes.\u201cDamn\u2026 we need to move right now! A horde of zombies has really caught up with us. There is a fu*king lot of them!\u201d\u201cWhat?! You said there wasn\u2019t anything nearby.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t sense anything a while ago!\u201dOliver intervened.\u201cIt\u2019s like a cellar, someone prepared the bodies and activated the magic to turn them into zombies as soon as someone comes here. I think it\u2019s a trap. It seems like we were being lured.\u201dHearing that, the mercenaries were agitated, but without minding them, Oliver asked Joe and his gang.\u201cCan you lend me some emotions? Two flasks.\u201dThe warlock named Sam was terrified.\u201cCome again?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll pay you back later. If we make a mistake now, we\u2019ll be surrounded by zombies.\u201cGive it,\u201d said Joe, and Sam frowned.\u201cWhy should we give ours to that damn guy\u2026. He..\u201d\u201cDoes anyone else have the firepower to wipe out those zombies with that amount right now?\u201dAt Joe\u2019s words, Sam clenched his teeth and gave two flasks of emotions to Oliver.Oliver immediately extracted the emotions from the flask.[Targeting][Las Bomb][Black Dart]Oliver created a massive [Las Bomb] after targeting the zombie swarms surrounding the building.Then, after putting [Las Bomb] on the black darts, he shot them toward the target.The black darts pierced the wind and went toward the zombies who looked at them dumbfounded.BOOM! BOOM!\u2014\u2014! BOOM!A small explosion occurred.After extracting the remaining emotions, Oliver ran forward with Joe and his party.Due to the explosion, the zombies who were only concerned with the building suffered great damage and the formation was disturbed.Using the gap created, Joe and his party ran toward the building following Oliver.Oliver arrived at the front of the building filled with the cries of zombies, and Joe who arrived after him shouted out in front of the tightly closed building.\u201cIt\u2019s me. Joe! Open the door!\u201dA crack appeared in the front door, which had been blocked with all sorts of things, followed by the sounds of things being removed.As soon as the door opened, Joe and others quickly entered through the door.Oliver turned and looked at the fallen zombies outside the building.Seeing that Joe hurriedly called Oliver.\u201cWhat are you doing? Come inside!\u201dWhen Oliver entered the door, the people who opened the door, quickly moved the things and blocked the front door.\u201c\u2026were there only this many people in the group?\u201dOliver looked at the few people and asked.\u201c\u2026..no.\u201d\u201c\u2026..!\u201dWith those words, someone came down from upstairs.He was wearing a protective suit similar to the mercenaries of Joe\u2019s gang but had an additional shoulder guard.He was a man, and he seemed to be a Reinforced human.\u201cThank you for coming! After all, you didn\u2019t abandon us and came to save us.\u201d\u201cNo, we were also locked up. Suddenly, a swarm of zombies poured out.\u201dAs if to prove Joe\u2019s words, someone shouted.\u201cOh, damn it\u2026! Another horde of zombies appeared around the building!\u201dThe screamer was a woman with a uniquely shaped shotgun, and a silk hat on her head.\u201cUh, aren\u2019t you the one who was with Mr. Arthur?The silk hat woman looked at Oliver.\u201c\u2026?\u2026ah! The Warlock from District T who said he didn\u2019t want to be on the same team as us?\u201d\u201cUm, yes, that\u2019s right. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to be on the same team\u2026 Anyway, nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to meet you like this, but anyway, nice to meet you\u2026 Was it you, who attacked the zombies a while ago?\u201dShe spoke normally but her emotions were in a mess, and it wasn\u2019t just her, the emotions of everyone inside the building were in a mess.\u201cYes, it was me.\u201dWhen Oliver answered, the woman with a silk hat said something to another colleague who was sitting next to her and then headed somewhere.Oliver wondered where she was going, but at that moment, the mercenary who had been talking to Joe spoke to Oliver.\u201cHey, hello. My name is Hugh. I am the captain of the Goodman mercenary. It is really nice to meet you in such a situation.\u201dHe said in an urgent voice. It seemed like he desperately needed Oliver\u2019s help.\u201cNice to meet you too.\u201d\u201cThe situation is urgent, so I will ask you straight-forward. The bombardment that happened before. Did you do it?\u201dOliver nodded.\u201cThen please help us! Once again, use that black magic to open the way.\u201dJust as Oliver was about to say something, the woman with a silk hat who had just gone somewhere came with a man.It was Stonefist Arthur.\u201cHey, Dave, nice to meet you again. Help us.\u201dNot just Arthur, but several people came from different directions of the building and asked Oliver to help.Oliver, who heard everyone, looked around and said calmly.\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m curious\u2026can I ask you a question?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs the heated atmosphere subdued, Oliver asked his question.\u201cI heard the fighter crew and the mercenaries ran into this place while exploring the contaminated zone, but how did Mr. Arthur get here?\u201dArthur, who had a golem prosthetic arm, smoked a cigarette and answered.\u201cWuu\u2026 I happened to get here while getting rid of zombies with my guys.\u201d\u201cCan you explain a little more?\u201dArthur looked at Oliver for a moment, then pulled out a map from his arms.He had a more detailed map than Oliver had, and he pointed to a skull mark.\u201cWe went here, and we were attacked by a horde of zombies.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a dangerous place where zombies appear in large numbers?\u201d\u201cYeah. Originally, we never planned on going there, but we couldn\u2019t catch as many zombies as we thought for the number of people on our team\u2026 So, we decided to take the risk\u2026\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like a bad idea.As long as they had the necessary equipment and numbers, it felt like they could deal with the zombies.However, it felt possible only if the conditions were normal.\u201cWhen we entered the area we couldn\u2019t see the zombies, but suddenly\u2026 zombies started shooting guns or throwing bombs from above the building. They rushed toward us from all directions as if they were waiting for us.\u201dIt was as Oliver had expected.\u201cWe were perplexed, yet we responded properly, but the real problem was the swarm of zombies kept coming. In the end, we decided to\u2026 run away, and somehow reached this place.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Did Mr. Arthur come first? Or did Mr. Hugh come first?\u201dGoodman mercenary battalion commander Hugh answered Oliver\u2019s question this time.\u201cWe came in first, then those friends, then these solvers, and lastly, those guys. Ah, no\u2026 you guys are the last.\u201dSam said to Hugh as he repaired his gun.\u201cWow\u2026I never thought you were the kind of person who shared his things?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s called thinking smart, warlock. If we alone had kept this place, we would have been captured. We lacked manpower and supplies, so how do you expect us to fight those zombies?\u201dHugh\u2019s judgment felt right. It was thanks to the increase in manpower and supplies they seemed to have put up a proper fight against the zombie hordes.\u201cBut now, we\u2019re at our limit. We almost ran out of bullets and bombs.\u201dHearing that, Oliver nodded his head without saying anything.Their situation seemed really bad.Having run out of bullets, bombs, and emotions, all that was left for them was to fight with their bodies.Of course, there were those who had excellent physical abilities, but even so, it was only a matter of time before they died against a large number of zombie armies.It really was a catastrophic situation.For everyone inside the building, the situation did not make any sense, but for Oliver, there was something else that did not make any sense.He did not understand how the zombies are controlled so meticulously, and above all, he did not understand why the Solvers and mercenaries were targeted.As these thoughts kept circling in Oliver\u2019s mind, suddenly\u2026, Joseph\u2019s image popped into his head.His Master, who made him come to Landa with a lie and tried to lure him to the offering altar.\u201cMr. Warlock, Please. Please once again use that powerful firepower to sweep away the zombies and open a way out. Then, we will take responsibility and protect Mr. Warlock.\u201dHugh\u2019s words were sincere, and he seemed to want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.As Hugh was trying to persuade Oliver, a mercenary rushed down from upstairs and screamed urgently.\u201cCaptain, come quickly!\u201d\u201cWhat? Why?! Are the zombies attacking again?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not\u2026 Please come up and see this yourself.\u201dAt those words, Hugh stopped the conversation with Oliver and went up, followed by Knuckle Joe, Sam, Arthur, and many others.Of course, Oliver was one among the many others.\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d\u201cMore zombies have come. That alone is absurd, but the problem is there\u2019s that fu*king thing among the zombies.\u201d\u201cWhat the fu*k are you talking about?\u201d\u201cDo you remember the Battle of Dunken Forest?\u201d\u201cSadly, I do.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat similar to what we saw back then.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Fu*k.\u201dHugh rushed to the top of the building while swearing.On the top of the building, a mercenary armed with heavy weapons, a Solver, a Wizard, and a Warlock were on alert, and all of them were looking at one place.Their gaze was on a group of zombies that looked fresh as if they had just died.Those zombies were not just armed, they possessed intelligence, unlike ordinary zombies.It was faint, but they had emotions, and it was the first time Oliver had seen anything like that.It was like the zombies that failed to be zombified.But\u2026 unlike Oliver, others seemed interested in something different.\u201cIs that Lich?\u201dOliver turned his gaze to where the man was pointing.Among the hordes of zombies, there was a zombie wearing a colorful cloak, with a mummy-like shriveled face.Hugh asked Joe while pointing to the zombie in question.\u201cDo you think\u2026\u2026it\u2019s a Lich?\u201cI don\u2019t know, does Lich exist?\u201dOthers also asked nearby warlocks and wizards whether it was Lich, and at that time, Oliver spoke softly.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like a Lich\u2026, it\u2019s more like a Corpse doll.\u201d\u201cCorpse doll?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s like a zombie doll made with black magic, adding mechanical parts, and special processing, that\u2019s what it looks like.\u201dOliver said confidently.He saw a similar one in the past when he was dealing with Puppeteer Glyph, and the ones standing outside the building felt very similar to those Corpse dolls.It had the same unique sense of alienation of someone entering and controlling another person\u2019s corpse.No one doubted Oliver\u2019s words and Hugh even asked as if he had lost interest in them.\u201cThen, can you sweep that as well?\u201dOliver focused his gaze on Hugh\u2019s eyes and shook his head.\u201cNo\u2026it seems difficult. In addition to those corpse dolls, if you include the ones hiding, there are seven more in total. Even if the small zombies are swept away by bombing, the corpse dolls will come out and stop us. Even if we get stopped for a moment, the zombies will come from all directions and surround us.\u201dIt was not certain, but everyone went silent as if they understood instinctively.Oliver did not know who was behind all this, but this was enough to gauge the other person\u2019s skills.Sam asked, casting black magic on the bullet.\u201cCan\u2019t we just kill those Corpse dolls and move forward?\u201d\u201cThe Corpse doll is stronger than you think, so it will not be easy. In particular, the corpse doll down there seems to be made in a much better than what I had seen before.\u201dOliver said that based on what he learned from Puppeteer Glyph\u2019s book.\u201cThen, what should we do? Just wait until the bullets and emotions run out and the zombies enter the building?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026, can\u2019t we get help from the soldiers guarding the area around the contaminated zone?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s impossible. The City Defense Force guys out there care for only themselves, the reason they sent us here in the first place was to avoid taking any risks.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 But isn\u2019t the situation unusual right now?\u201d\u201cYeah, but they will only move after everyone here die. Above all, there is no way to contact them to come. Communication device doesn\u2019t work well in the contaminated zone.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you communicate with Mr. Joe earlier?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because it was inside the same contaminated zone. Communication with the outside is difficult.\u201dAs if to prove his argument, Hugh showed Oliver a crackling communication device. There was absolutely nothing to be heard other than noise.They were trapped inside a building surrounded by swarms of zombies with no way of communication, no bullets, and no emotions.The whole situation did not have a single advantage. Oliver thought he\u2019d better take everyone and try to break through.Even if he could not save everyone, Oliver thought at least he would be able to run away.\u2018What will happen if I focus on running away while covering my body in [Black suit]\u2026\u2019\u201cFu*k\u2026 Do we have to stake our lives on the basement side then?\u201dHugh said in frustration.\u201cIs there a basement?\u201d\u201cThere is an underground passage connected to the sewer in the basement of this building, so I have sent some to explore where it leads to.\u201dSam said gladly.\u201cOh really?!\u201d\u201cUh, but it\u2019s so deep and complicated that everyone is having a hard time. It\u2019s so dark that it\u2019s even staggering, so it\u2019s hard to differentiate between the left and right, up and down, as if someone was playing a prank.\u201dAs it became difficult to escape from the building, everyone placed their hopes on the last straw, and in the midst of that, someone came up from the lower floor as if he brought a message from God.The person who came was covered in dust, and he looked very happy.\u201cCaptain! Come downstairs! Looks like we\u2019ve found a way to live!\u201dHearing the news, everyone went downstairs.As Hugh said, there was a basement under the building, and it was dark and dusty.It did not seem like it was simply due to the aging of the building.It had a strong sense that the basement itself was built just as a pass-through with no use and a group of people could be seen through the pit of dust.Most of them were mercenaries and soldiers, and there was one face that Oliver knew.It was the warlock who spoke to Oliver as soon as he entered the Contaminated zone.\u201cMr. Jaby\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026It\u2019s nice to see a familiar face here.\u201dHugh who was next to Oliver said to his subordinate.\u201cMake the lantern brighter\u2026 I can\u2019t see anything properly!?\u201dThe light grew stronger, and with that Jaby\u2019s face became visible. His face was bruised as if he got beaten.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cWe met this guy while checking the escape route along the underground passage.\u201d\u201cWhy were you there?\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026it\u2019s because Sir. Wizard ordered a search.\u201d\u201cSeems like the situation isn\u2019t perfect there either.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t die. I originally followed as a guide, but I couldn\u2019t even do that\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere are they? Wizard and Druid.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re recovering in a safe building. Zombies are pouring in endlessly, and they\u2019re exhausted\u2026\u201d\u201cYou guys are also in the same situation as us, huh\u2026\u201dWhile Hugh was thinking, Jaby spoke to him.\u201c\u2026\u2026If it\u2019s okay with you, how about joining us?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll guide you. Everyone, unless you\u2019re an idiot, can understand what situation we are in, right? Something is terribly wrong here. Zombies are pouring out from everywhere, they have guns and are shooting, and doing everything.\u201dNo one had any concerns or objections to Jaby\u2019s proposal.Of course, it was a natural reaction when surrounded by hordes of zombies that kept coming. Everyone thought they had to work together to survive.\u201cWell, okay\u2026 If we join forces with a powerful Wizard, our chances of survival will increase. But can we all move at once?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019ll be a bit difficult. There will be so many people and there is a limit to the number of people that can go along the dark narrow underground aisle.\u201d\u201cThen what shall we do then?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a problem too\u2026who wants to go last?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 then, should we draw lots?\u201dWhile everyone was exchanging opinions about this and that, Jaby intervened and gave advice.\u201cIf possible, I would like talented people to come first. For example, Mr. Hugh, Mr. Warlock, and Mr. Arthur\u2026. Sir. Wizard is sensitive right now, so I think it will be best if he sees the talented guys first. You know, young wizards, how eccentric.\u201dSoon, everyone decided to go with Jaby\u2019s plan and thought about how to move, and at that moment, Oliver walked over and stopped in front of Jaby.Everyone looked at the scene with a dumbfounded expressions on their faces, including Jaby.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cMr. Jaby, where is the wizard?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Hiding in a certain building. Avoiding zombies.\u201d\u201cCan you tell me specifically what kind of building it is?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026I don\u2019t know about that either.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you are familiar with this contaminated zone?\u201d\u201c\u2026I know it well, but I don\u2019t know everything.\u201dOliver nodded as if he understood.Hugh tried to ask what was going on, but Joe stopped him as if he noticed something.\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m curious. Can I ask you a question?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, what?\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Ja\u2026\u201d\u201cNot the outside, I\u2019m asking the one who\u2019s controlling the inside.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA deadly silence surrounded the whole place.\u201cHuhuhuhuhuhu\u2026 Interesting.

    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHuhuhuhuhu\u2026 Interesting. When did you notice?\u201dJaby\u2026 No, the unidentified warlock jumped back and quickly extracted emotions.The speed at which he extracted the emotions was faster than any warlock Oliver had ever seen.The emotions extracted like a thread from the flask became beautiful black magic in his hands.It was so natural as if the emotions were living and breathing, but fortunately, Oliver was also as fast as the unidentified warlock.[Hate Bullet][Hate Bullet]BANG\u2014\u2014\u2014!Bullets of hate collided and exploded in the air.The power was so great that everyone around the two got pushed back in shock.As the smoke created from the explosion cleared, Jaby who was relaxed and had eyes filled with admiration said looking at Oliver.\u201cHuhuhuhu\u2026You\u2019re pretty\u2026 good.\u201dJaby mumbled as he fired a [Hate bullet] while preparing [Black javelin] with the other hand.If Oliver deploys a Black Shield or attacks with a Hate Bullet, he would probably try to kill him with a [Black Javelin] with penetrating properties added.Oliver calculated in his head and fired a Hate Bullet to block Jaby\u2019s first attack.Jaby smiled and when he was about to throw the Black Javelin\u2026 his hand stopped.\u201c\u2026. What?\u201dOliver\u2019s [Vine Shadow] grabbed Jaby\u2019s arm.\u201cHuhuhuhu\u2026 this is more than I expected.\u201dJaby said with a gleam of admiration.Soon, with a \u2018clack\u2019 sound, his hand fell off like a lizard\u2019s tail.The principle seemed very similar to Puppeteer Glyph\u2019s corpse doll.As soon as the arm fell, a blade filled with green liquid came out and headed straight for Oliver.\u201cAs expected\u2026\u201dOliver didn\u2019t panic and fired Hate Bullet like a machine gun.The first [Hate bullet] smashed the blade, the second [Hate bullet] shattered his shoulder, the third and fourth broke his knees, and the fifth made a huge hole in his stomach.TADAKAlong with a loud noise, processed skin, flesh, machinery, and springs scattered on the floor.All of this happened in an instant.All the people in the basement couldn\u2019t respond and just stared blankly at the scene in front of them.It was like they can not believe the situation in front of them right now.\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dEveryone was silent, and ironically, the person responsible for this situation broke the silence in a very bright and cheerful voice.\u201cHuhuhuhuhuhuhuhu\u2026! This\u2026, this is very unexpected. It is unexpected to meet such a fun chap in a place like this.\u201dThe half-shattered Jaby spoke leisurely.No, it was not like Jaby Oliver knew. It was a completely different person, from his voice to his tone and atmosphere.\u201c\u2026 .Isn\u2019t it painful?\u201dThe shattered Jaby answered Oliver\u2019s question.\u201cNot really\u2026 Seeing you fight, it seems like you know a little bit about\u00a0 corpse dolls, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve seen it once, and I don\u2019t know for sure. I didn\u2019t get the chance to learn about it\u2026 So, Do you not feel the pain?\u201d\u201cYeah, if you synchronize the senses, you\u2019ll be able to feel it, but I\u2019m not that kind of pervert you see.\u201dIt was a truly bizarre scene.The scene of watching two people who had just attacked each other as if they were going to kill each other, having a conversation in such a calm way.It was bizarre and unnatural, which made everyone even more horrified, but then the mercenary captain Hugh mustered courage and interrupted.\u201cHey\u2026 .. What are you?\u201d\u201cHohoho? Ah\u2026 Look at me, I forgot to introduce myself. I\u2019m sorry young chap, I hope you understand. As you get older, your memory and manners fade. Hey there little chaps, Hello\u2026\u2026 Hmm\u2026What was my name again, ahhh\u2026 It\u2019s been such a long time since anyone called me by my name, so I myself forgot about it\u2026huhuhuhu.\u201dEveryone including Oliver remained silent as the unidentified warlock kept talking.\u201cOh\u2026 there was this name which people call me often. It was a nice nickname and I personally like it. Hello young folks. Let me introduce myself. I\u2019m a very old warlock who goes by the name PUPPET. Nice to meet you.\u201dPuppet.Everyone opened their mouths wide as soon as they heard the wordOliver knew the reason for their shock to some extent.He had heard that Puppet was one of the executives of a very large organization called the Black Hand, and a high-risk criminal wanted by the world.While everyone was shocked, one denied it and said,\u201cTha\u2026, that\u2019s a lie. If it\u2019s Puppet, he was killed a few years ago\u2026 ..\u201dPuppet laughed.\u201cHuhuhuhuhu\u2026Every ten years, there are two or three stories like this, that I died. Let me tell you something\u2026 IT\u2019S FAKE NEWS. There are times when I suffer like now. But, even if I suffer, I do not die. That\u2019s why they call me Eternal Puppet. Oh, by the way, I don\u2019t care whether you believe it or not, Young fellows. Think of whatever you are comfortable with. Whether you believe it or not, reality will not change.\u201dEveryone could not refute looking at the self-centric and relaxed attitude of Puppet.All of a sudden, everyone believed that the person in front of them was the real Puppet.Of course, Oliver believed.He couldn\u2019t see through them all, but at least he knew that his words were sincere.\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dEveryone got frightened by the sudden appearance of the great villain in the history of the world and could not open their mouths hastily, and at that moment, Joe opened his mouth.\u201cAre you really Puppet\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right., half-warlock of the Fighter Crew. You must have something to ask.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Do you know about me?\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing that I don\u2019t know. My eyes and ears are everywhere. Huhuhuhuhuhu\u2026.\u201dIt was half bluff, but the confidence was real.Even though he was in a broken state, he was able to subdue the people with just a few words.Not just the name, but the relaxed attitude and a few words brought fear in people.It seemed like an attitude that was worth learning for Oliver. So, Oliver continued to observe Puppet.\u201c\u2026are all the zombies outside this building yours?\u201d\u201cYeah, huhuhuhu\u2026 do you like it? I prepared it specially\u2026 for young chaps like you. It was a bit annoying, but it was quite fun.\u201dJoe intervened and asked.\u201cWhy are you doing this to us? Everyone here has no affiliation with you.\u201dPuppet burst into laughter.\u201cHuhuhuhuhuuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuuhuhuh\u201dAt the sound of his laughter, everyone except Oliver had no choice but to shake with goosebumps that spread all over their body.\u201cHu\u2026 huhu\u2026 hu\u2026 Ah, excuse me, I couldn\u2019t help myself. It was so funny.\u201d\u201c\u2026. What\u2019s funny?\u201d\u201cAh, well. It\u2019s funny that people who make a living by butchering people that had nothing to do with them are asking me this question\u2026 You talk as if you\u2019re good people but no, you\u2019re not\u2026 You guys are nothing but human butchers.\u201dIt was a blatant description of mercenaries and Solvers.Puppet spoke with all his sincerity, and because of that, everyone felt a rage that made them forget the fear for a moment.\u201cOh, I\u2019ll ask apology if I offended you, little fellows. But it\u2019s true? Well, it\u2019s the truth that makes one even more upset\u2026 Anyway, I\u2019ll answer your question.\u201d\u201cQuestion?\u201d\u201cYeah, you asked why I\u2019m doing this, right? It\u2019s simple. I\u2019m doing this just because I need humans like you\u2026 Something like ham from slaughtering a pig. Do you get it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand? It doesn\u2019t matter. Death isn\u2019t a concept that seeks understanding anyway\u2026 Since you guys made me feel some fun after a long time, I\u2019ll give you guys an option.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cA proposal that only some of you will die and the majority will live.\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve almost reached the number of solvers I wanted\u2026 I\u2019ve reached my goal. So, some of you just follow me and die. Then I\u2019ll release the rest. Safely\u2026 What do you say about it?\u201d\u201cDo you asking us to believe that?\u201dWhen someone muttered, Puppet replied.\u201cI don\u2019t care whether you believe it or not, young fellows\u2026 In the first place, I can tear down a shabby building like this at any time. If you\u2019ve any doubts, go upstairs again, and look. You can see the army of zombies multiplied by several times.\u201dThere was no lie in Puppet\u2019s words.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, tell me now. I\u2019ll prove my power right away. I\u2019m just making a suggestion that the little chaps can afford. Seriously. For each other, how about easing the troubles?\u201dIt was a truly bizarre sight.It was a situation where all famous solvers were intimidated by a corpse doll that couldn\u2019t even stand up.They were intimidated so well that most of them were terrified.The emotions stained with fear, the shaking eyes, and the cold sweat on their foreheads were proof of that.At some point, the control of the situation had passed to Puppet.The only thing the solvers and mercenaries could do at this point was, make a choice.Then, with a trembling voice, someone asked carefully.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Who do you want?\u201d\u201cOh, huhuhuhu\u2026 A smart chap has appeared\u2026 That chap and that chap. Other than that, about ten other people. Don\u2019t kill them, but leave them alive.\u201dPuppet said, pointing to Oliver and Arthur.Oliver could feel a lot of eyes focused on him.Arthur was tense and was ready to fight right away, and as if in response, the others contracted their muscles and were ready to move at any time.The emotions of most of them were fear, anxiety, and a little hope.It was a sudden situation where the allies decided to fight each other.At that moment, someone strode forward in front of Puppet.It was Oliver.\u201cMaybe\u2026 if it\u2019s okay with you, can I make another suggestion?\u201d\u201cHuhuhhuhuhu\u2026. Another suggestion\u2026 Interesting?\u201d\u201cYes, if you allow it.\u201dEveryone looked at Oliver in amazement, even Puppet.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say about this. In the years I lived I haven\u2019t seen anyone giving me a suggestion in this situation\u2026huhuhuhuhuhu\u2026 Tell me, I\u2019m curious about what you\u2019re going to say.\u201d\u201cIt seems like you want me and other people to come somewhere. As much as possible, you want us alive, right?\u2026 I\u2019d rather come there by myself, and why don\u2019t you try fighting me?\u201d\u201c\u2026You would like to fight me?\u201dPuppet asked as if it was funny.\u201cYeah, if I win, you\u2019ll just let us all go, and if I lose, you do whatever you want. As you said before, doesn\u2019t Mr. Puppet have the power to do that? Above all else\u2026 you\u2019re going to kill everyone anyway.\u201dThe atmosphere turned cold at Oliver\u2019s last words.\u201cHuhuhuhuhuhu\u2026! I never thought you could see through my lie.\u201d\u201cI just saw it.\u201d\u201cYou saw\u2026? Geez! I made a mistake with this. I\u2019ll apologize! I shouldn\u2019t have treated a person with skills like that. But trust me. Usually, most people are fooled by such obvious lies. If you show them the difference in skills and instill a little hope\u2026BANG\u2026they fall into your trap. Isn\u2019t humans pretty interesting?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m not in a position to judge others\u2026.. So, what do you say about my suggestion? If you don\u2019t accept it, I\u2019ll just run away on my own right now. It seems like if I concentrate my everything on running away, I will be able to escape somehow.\u201dPuppet looked at Oliver.\u201c\u2026Huhuhuhu, you\u2019re serious. I never dreamed I\u2019d be threatened like this. Well then, shall I give you guys some more hope? Come through the underground passage. Yeah, by any chance if you beat me, I\u2019ll set everyone free. I mean it, it\u2019s nice to have a young chap who is provocative like this\u2026\u201dUpon hearing the answer, Oliver reached out and placed a finger on Jaby\u2019s temple.\u201cOkay, then, I\u2019ll take this for now. Because I won.\u201d\u201cOh, I like that attitude.\u201dWith those words, Oliver fired a small [Hate bullet] and pierced the corpse doll\u2019s temple.The light disappeared from the doll\u2019s eyes like a thread was cut, and it was scattered all over.Everyone was silent, but Oliver opened the leather case wrapped around his waist and pulled out a folded glutton bag.\u2018Come to think of it, is this my first time actually taking it out?\u2019Seeing that someone asked\u201cThat. What the hell\u2026\u201dThe glutton bag that had been folded began to swell like bread dough.Oliver ordered a human-sized one, but it was slightly larger than a human because of the swelling.As it took shape, traces of several human skins and eyeballs attached to it in all directions became visible.The glutton bag was self-aware that it had grown in size, but it was feeling a bit confused about the current situation because it was suddenly called.\u201cGlutton bag.\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s call, the glutton bag turned toward Oliver.Looking at it moving it seemed like it was far from being agile.\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Dave, your owner. If it\u2019s okay with you, can you swallow some of that?\u201dOliver pointed to Puppet\u2019s corpse doll, Jaby.The glutton bag seemed reluctant as if it didn\u2019t suit its taste.Oliver remembered the words of the warlock who made the glutton bag saying that the glutton bags mostly like money and precious metals that have a monetary value.The glutton bag looked at the corpse doll and then saw Oliver.It reminded Oliver of a snake with limbs, but it didn\u2019t show any signs of rebellion.Rather, it was obedient.The glutton bag shrank again when Oliver ordered it after swallowing the corpse doll, and Oliver folded it up and put it back into the leather case.After putting it in, Oliver asked the people who were standing blankly and staring at him.\u201cWould anyone like to come with me to fight Puppet?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWould anyone like to come with me to fight Puppet?\u201dEveryone looked at Oliver with surprise at that question.It was like witnessing a dog trying to attack a tiger.And, maybe that was the correct expression.Oliver, who had just become a Solver, was nothing more than a puppy when compared to Puppet.Seeing everyone\u2019s reaction Oliver suddenly remembered something Kent once told him about Puppet.Eternal Puppet.One of the greatest warlocks of this time and one of the executives of the Black Hand.It was said that it is impossible to even estimate how long he has lived and some even say that his lifespan was longer than that of the empire.Because of that, there were no fields he left untouched such as drugs, weapons, mercenaries, and illegal medicine, and it was said that he had connections with high-ranking people in every country.All of them were rumors without substance, so half of them were treated as false rumors, but anyway, right now, Oliver asked for a duel with such a person.\u201cAre you\u2026 insane\u2026?\u201d said one solver, who was terrified and at the same time desperate.\u201cYes? What\u2026?\u201d\u201cWho makes a bet like that\u2026! Your opponent is Puppet!? And you bet with our lives?!\u201dOliver looked at the man and said.\u201cUm\u2026. I think you didn\u2019t hear the conversation before, he was planning on killing us anyway. He just wanted to make us fight among ourselves and take us apart.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2026you can\u2019t know that for sure?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m sure. There was absolutely no intention of releasing us.\u201dThe man, frightened by Oliver\u2019s calm and composed attitude couldn\u2019t say anything back. It was the same with other solvers.Oliver opened his mouth, checking the flask he had in his arms.\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you got offended by my behavior. But if I had stayed still, Puppet would have instigated a fight between us, and in the end, we would have fought each other without any purpose. So please understand\u2026\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to fight or kill anyone without any reason.\u201dAs if Oliver\u2019s persuasion had worked, no one complained after that.But still, they seemed to be reluctant to fight with Puppet, and Oliver didn\u2019t really care about it. He was planning on moving alone from the beginning.Just as he was about to move, Knuckle Joe spoke up.\u201cHey\u2026..\u201d\u201c\u2026? Yes, Mr. Joe.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t keep adding those honorifics, it\u2019s creepy. Just call me Joe..\u201d\u201cUm\u2026.. Yes, I understand. Did you call me to say that?\u201dSam grabbed Joe\u2019s shoulder, but Joe pushed back Sam\u2019s hand and spoke again.\u201cAre you\u2026 going to fight Puppet?\u201d\u201cYes, because I made a promise? \u2026If I break it, maybe he\u2019ll send all the zombies here right away.\u201d\u201c\u2026.Is it true that if you win, he\u2019ll release us?\u201d\u201cYes. What he said was true, at least when he answered. Didn\u2019t you see his emotions?\u201d\u201cNo, with my level I couldn\u2019t see it. Only you saw it. Are you confident of winning?\u201dOliver thought for a while before answering the question.\u201cUm\u2026 well. I can\u2019t honestly say for sure, because he\u2019s kind of a person I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\u201cA kind you never saw?\u201d\u201cYes, usually everyone is interested in winning against the opponent, but Puppet seemed different. He seems to be interested in some other thing. I don\u2019t know what that is.\u201dThen, someone muttered.\u201cAh, in rumors I\u2019ve heard that Puppet was said to be interested in immortality.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Immortality?\u201dThe murmurer carefully answered Oliver\u2019s question.\u201cWell, it\u2019s just a rumor\u2026\u201dImmortality\u2026\u2026It seemed like a plausible reason for Oliver.According to Joseph\u2019s book, there were quite a lot of warlocks who were obsessed with that part.He had also seen in books that even non-warlocks research or invest in immortality, and of course, there has never been a single case of success.However, even if it was a plausible story, in Oliver\u2019s eyes, Puppet didn\u2019t seem like a person who was just obsessed with immortality.Oliver felt like the scattered puzzles in his head don\u2019t fit together.While Oliver was in the midst of deep thought, Joe interrupted.\u201cHey, sorry to interrupt the conversation, but answer my question first. Can you win? \u2026If you can\u2019t win, we\u2019d rather take you down and negotiate with the Puppet.\u201dAt Joe\u2019s words, the fellow solvers and mercenaries took a stance.His words were sincere to some degree.\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I can win or not, but I will fight with the intention of winning.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 okay? All right, then I will come with you.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cI said I\u2019m coming with you to fight Puppet.\u201dOliver went into the basement passageway to keep his promise to Puppet.In addition to Oliver,\u00a0 Knuckle Joe, Dual-Pistol Sam, and Solver Stonefist Arthur also joined.Joe said he would follow him, and Sam followed because he couldn\u2019t let Joe go alone, but why Arthur followed him, even Oliver did not know the answer.When Oliver asked about this, Arthur answered.\u201cThe reason? It\u2019s better to be with a real man who wants to fight than to be with bastards who tried to sell me.\u201d\u201cUm..\u2026.\u201dOliver groaned.He understood why Arthur felt that way. Even though it was for a moment, they fell for the Puppet\u2019s trick.And of course, Oliver couldn\u2019t blame them for that, because each word Puppet uttered had something that shook people\u2019s hearts for some reason.His words had something that digs into a person\u2019s weak spots.\u201cHey\u2026\u2026 Can I ask you something?\u201dSam with a pistol in both hands intervened and asked.\u201cYes, tell me.\u201dSam looked at Oliver and spoke with a troubled look.\u201cUgh\u2026 There are so many things I want to ask you, but I\u2019ll ask you the thing I\u2019m most curious about. How did you find out?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow did you find out Jaby was a corpse doll\u2026 .. I didn\u2019t recognize it, even though I have good eyes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOliver went silent, not knowing how to respond.Puppet\u2019s Corpse doll certainly belongs to the well-made category. It looked like a living person even though it pretended to be one, and it felt natural because it was well synchronized.However, when Oliver looked a little closer, he was able to differentiate them.Oliver want to say it was because of the difference in skills, but he felt that it would not be an answer that would convince Sam, given his emotional state.So he answered in a roundabout way.\u201cI once met a person who was a disciple of Puppet.\u201d\u201cDisciple?\u201d\u201cYes, his name was Puppeteer Glyph, he said he was Puppet\u2019s disciple, and I\u2019ve seen him pretend to be a human using a Corpse doll. So I could tell the difference.\u201d\u201c\u2026.Where did you meet him?\u201d\u201cAt the place where I stayed before, unfortunately, we disagreed on something and fought.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did you win?\u201d\u201cUm, yes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll ask you again. You knocked down Puppet\u2019s disciple?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.. I was lucky.\u201dSam, Joe, and Arthur looked surprised.Oliver didn\u2019t quite understand why they were surprised.\u201cThen\u2026 do you have any concrete plans to take down the Puppet? I\u2019d like to hear it because we\u2019ve been following you this far?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no plan. Just meet Puppet and try to take him down? If I kill him, it will naturally neutralize the zombies outside.\u201dJoe, Sam, and Arthur\u2019s expressions got distorted as if they did not like Oliver\u2019s plan. But, they couldn\u2019t say anything. There was no other way for them to do this on their own.Arthur, who had been silent for a while, spoke, as the conversation between Sam and Oliver came to an end.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know whether this will work, but from the warlocks I\u2019ve seen, they are a kind that was weak in direct combat.\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes turned to Arthur.\u201cDo you know something?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve met some warlocks on the battlefield a few times.\u201d\u201cA warlock? Were they a mercenary?\u201d\u201cThere were mercenaries, and there were warlocks who just came to pick up the corpses\u2026. Even while collecting the corpses, there were those who sometimes tried to kidnap living people.\u201d\u201cHave you ever fought with them?\u201d\u201cI have\u2026 It was when one of our squad members got kidnapped. It wasn\u2019t a very pleasant memory. There were a lot of traps, and I think this time too there will be multiple traps\u2026 And by the way, Why did you guys come?\u201dArthur suddenly asked, looking at Joe and Sam.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cNo, as for me, I followed this guy because I was pointed out by Puppet along with him, but I don\u2019t know why you guys are coming. Especially, the guy with the knuckles there.\u201dArthur asked, pointing to Knuckle Joe.Sam replied in a displeased tone instead of Joe.\u201cWhat? Are you asking whether we\u2019re up to something?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.. All I know is rumors, and there are rumors that Puppet had a lot of disciples. So, huh?\u201dSam grinned displeasedly, tightening his pistol, but Joe stopped him and calmed him down. And then he turned to Arthur and said.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s definitely not like that.\u201d\u201cis it?\u201d\u201cYeah, unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find a good teacher like Puppet. I, too, have to take risks to live. In my experience, it\u2019s most dangerous to stay still, so I just followed.\u2019\u2019Joe\u2019s words were half sincere, and Sam added one more word to Joe\u2019s.\u201cWell, if we fight Puppet and survive, the value of our name will increase.\u201dSoon, the quarrel subsided, but the fear still prevailed.Everyone didn\u2019t express it, but they were anxious. Even though it had been a while since they entered the basement, they couldn\u2019t see anything.Since Puppet accepted Oliver\u2019s offer, they thought he\u2019d come out soon, but they hadn\u2019t even seen a single trace of life since they started walking in the passageway.They wondered if Puppet had changed his mind, but there was nothing they could do right away, so the anxiety within them kept increasing.Oliver, who understood that everyone was getting anxious when there was nothing to talk about, brought up a topic to speak about.\u201cUm\u2026 the basement here is very well-maintained than I thought.\u201dOliver said as he looked around. As a matter of fact, the basement passageway they were walking through was in a neat condition built with cement and bricks.At that moment, someone said.\u201cOriginally, the basement passageway was built by the owners of this city, Wizards. It cost them some huge chunks of money.\u201dIt was an unfamiliar voice.Everyone got startled and turned their heads in the direction the sound was heard.There stood a man with a saber on his waist.\u2018Puppet\u2026 . But how?\u2019Oliver thought for a moment.He had been using the warlock\u2019s eyes and had been browsing around the area since they entered, yet he didn\u2019t notice.While Oliver was bewildered by the situation he was experiencing for the first time, Arthur, Joe, and Sam moved first.Arthur gathered magic into the Golem prosthetic arm and then slammed his fist at Puppet who suddenly appeared.The golem prosthetic made of stone and magical power flew like a cannon, and it was as menacing as a huge boulder.However, surprisingly, Puppet swung the saber only once to cut off the Golem prosthetic arm.Arthur said in amazement as he looked at his flying arm.\u201cHuh\u2026 Even though those hands crushed a golem they can\u2019t handle a corpse doll\u2026!!\u201d\u201cHuhuhuhu\u2026.. Even though Golem is a B-class weapon, it\u2019s a little sad that you compared my work to such a thing, don\u2019t you think so? How about calming yourself guys? I\u2019m just here to talk-\u201c\u201cJoe.\u201dSaying those words Sam pointed his guns at Puppet and shot him.The bullets filled with black magic flew piercing the air toward Puppet.Oliver was surprised by the unfamiliar but creative attack method but was even more surprised to see Puppet\u2019s action of slashing the bullets using the saber and avoiding them.The fighting power increased incomparable to that of Jaby\u2019s time, and it seemed that the combat power as well as the fighting style differs depending on the corpse doll.DUDUDUDUUDUDUDUDUDUDUDDUUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDU.Sam kept firing the bullets, but Puppet avoided every single one of them and dug closer to him in an instant.\u201cMaybe if at least one person dies, you\u2019ll listen to me?\u201d\u201cYes. And that\u2019s gonna be YOU.\u201dWith those words Knuckle Joe cut between his colleague and Puppet.He fortified his body with black magic and attacked Puppet with sharper movements than when he had fought with Oliver in the past.But the problem was Puppet\u2019s attacks were sharper than his.Not only did he lightly dodge Joe\u2019s fists, but he also did a surprise lower kick, and then swung his saber again, which went straight toward Joe\u2019s head.BAM!Just before Joe\u2019s head got decapitated, Oliver in a black suit blocked Puppet\u2019s blade with his quarterstaff.The blade was not strengthened with emotions so Oliver was able to block it, and if it had been strengthened, the quarterstaff would have got cut like a loaf of bread.\u201cHuhuhuhu\u2026It\u2019s you. Can you move away, I don\u2019t want to kill you yet.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to die either.\u201dAlong with his reply, Oliver swung his quarterstaff.Puppet skillfully stepped back, and his body movements were completely different from when he was inside Jaby.Oliver wondered if that could be possible just by simply changing the Corpse doll, but for now, he decided to put the question aside.Oliver used [Hate Bullet] while targetting Puppet.Puppet cut every bullet of hate that came his way with his saber, then he said as if he finished analyzing it.\u201cNot only do you use manipulation and disease-type black magic, but you also use firearms skillfully\u2026. What is your true identity?\u201dBANG\u2014\u2014\u2014!Oliver quickly closed the distance and spoke while swinging his quarterstaff.\u201cI\u2019m also amazed. I also have a lot of questions about Mr. Puppet. How did you erase your presence a while ago, how can you use different attack styles, and where is your main body?\u201d\u201cHuhuhuhu\u2026. My main body?\u201dPuppet said with a laugh.\u201cWe have a lot of questions for each other. Then, shall we talk for a moment?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s fine with me.\u201dOliver said while pushing away Puppet\u2019s saber and trying to stab him with his quarterstaff.Puppet skillfully stopped Oliver\u2019s quarterstaff that tried to stab him with his saber, but that was not enough to stop Oliver.[Las Bomb]BOOMA [Las boom] that was formed at the end of Oliver\u2019s quarterstaff exploded and shattered Puppet\u2019s Corpse doll.Processed skin, flesh, bones, and springs got scattered on the floor. But it didn\u2019t bring any change to Puppet\u2019s emotional state, he was as relaxed as when he was inside the shattered Corpse doll Jaby.\u201cHuhuhuhu, even if I had lost two Corpse dolls in one day, this is the first time in a while that I lost to the same person twice.\u201dOliver asked, pointing the quarterstaff at the Corpse doll.\u201cShall we talk now?\u201d\u201cYes, but not here, let\u2019s change location.\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, Puppet placed his hand on the floor, from where the faded emotions in his hands moved quickly through the crevices of the floor.Oliver felt a floating sensation beneath his feet, and soon the floor on which Oliver was standing collapsed.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve met a fun chap like you. Let\u2019s have a Lon~g chat\u2026 huhuhuhuhu.\u201dOliver fell into the bottom of the basement along with Puppet\u2019s Corpse doll.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I put a lot of effort in preparing this, and it\u2019s a bit embarrassing looking at someone able to respond like this\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you lie?\u201d\u201cHuh? What?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019d release me if I win?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026that\u2019s right. But, you didn\u2019t win, did you? Surely, you beat this body, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you won over me.\u201dPuppet shook his head.\u201cOh, please\u2026 Please, don\u2019t do that. I met a funny chap after a long time. Don\u2019t be like other idiots. Those idiots who injure my finger and go out to brag that they killed Puppet.\u201dPuppet\u2019s words were sincere.He didn\u2019t care much about winning or losing, but he didn\u2019t think he lost either.He was not taking things seriously, as if he wasn\u2019t even interested in fighting, but his words were sincere and he was not bluffing.He was different from all the people Oliver had seen so far, and it sparked a curiosity in Oliver.\u201cUm\u2026Why are you doing this?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s call it curiosity. To get to know more about Humans, it\u2019s best to put them in a crisis, at least from my experience\u2026 It\u2019s embarrassing, but can I ask you a favor? Can\u2019t you just come down thinking you\u2019ve been beaten? I want to have a conversation with you. Please.\u201dOliver looked up.\u201cUm\u2026what will happen to those guys?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re doing what solvers do. Fighting hard. They\u2019re resisting well, but I\u2019ll be able to subdue them soon.\u201dJoe, Sam, and Arthur were resisting, but the number of zombies was endless.It seemed like they would be suppressed soon due to the nature of the narrow space.\u201cAre you going to kill them?\u201d\u201c\u2026 not right now. Why? Do you want me to kill them now?\u201d\u201cNo, I hope you don\u2019t kill them if possible.\u201dPuppet made a surprised expression.\u201cHey\u2026. were you that kind?\u201d\u201cI was taught to take care of my colleagues.\u201d\u201cA colleague? Huhuhuhu\u2026.you talk like a ten-year-old kid. Who taught you that? Well, okay, how about this? I won\u2019t kill them, instead, you have to come down. Please come. Don\u2019t worry, there are no traps down there. I just want to talk.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 It\u2019s a tempting suggestion, I also have a lot of questions for you?\u201d\u201cOh, well? I\u2019ll answer you when you come down.\u201dOliver nodded after thinking for a second. He released the [Targeting] and fell straight down.The ground seemed a lot below despite it being below the basement, and fortunately, there was no shock when he landed. It was thanks to the black suit, but it was also because there was something like a cushion underneath.The whole place was dark and Oliver couldn\u2019t see much, so he lit up his surroundings with a small amount of emotion, which revealed the mass of seriously rotten flesh beneath Oliver\u2019s feet.\u201cYou have a good stomach? Colin and David vomited as soon as they saw this. Especially, you should have seen that brat Colin\u2026 Huhuhuhu\u2026 I don\u2019t know how he can be like that even though he was a member of the Mj\u00f6lnir school.\u201dOliver didn\u2019t cry or vomit, but he could understand it.It was because this mass of flesh was more than just rotten, it was so terrible that it could not be described in words.It looked like the flesh of people mixed like flour dough.The pain and despair were evident in the twisted faces among the mass of flesh.As Oliver was observing that rotten piece of flesh, he noticed something interesting on the wall.It was a pattern, and he had seen similar a pattern in the past.It seemed similar to what he saw on Joseph\u2019s Secret Altar.\u201cA circle. Two crescent moons, an X pattern, a candlestick, and a cross\u2026..Is this a place where a Demon is worshiped?\u201d\u201cHalf wrong Half correct.\u201d\u201cThis piece of flesh\u2026Did Mr. Puppet do this?\u201d\u201cUmmm\u2026no, I\u2019m getting old and shameless, but as a scholar, I have no intention of taking credit for other people\u2019s work. It is the work of the owners of this city.\u201d\u2018Owners of the city?\u2019\u201cAre you talking about wizards?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a correct answer. You\u2019re surprisingly quick? Talking about it is very frustrating.\u201dOliver accepted Puppet\u2019s words without question.Not because his words were sincere, but because he expected a good reason in his own way.\u201c\u2026do wizards do business with demons?\u201d\u201cYes, they research and sometimes trade. Demons are terrifying creatures who want to sicken and destroy the human world, but at the same time, humans have a lust for unfathomable wisdom. It cannot be denied that they are convenient and useful beings.\u201dOliver was not particularly surprised. It seemed a bit discriminatory from the beginning to think that only warlocks could use demons\u2026 and now, he came to know that wizards also use Demons if necessary.He still didn\u2019t know how they could do it though.Oliver nodded as if convinced, and Puppet smiled when he saw that.\u201cHuhuhuhu, you\u2019re really amazing\u2026..if I say wizards have something to do with demons, most people don\u2019t believe them, even warlocks.\u201d\u201cis that so?\u201d\u201cOf course. Common sense is so scary. It prevents free ideas and rational guesses.\u201dAs Oliver explored the room he was in, he once again saw a chunk of flesh and the many patterns painted on the wall.He had no idea what the experiment was, but it seemed like something that had to do with life.When asked about this, Puppet said:\u201cWell, I can tell you, but not here. Can you come to the place I ask you to? I want to talk face to face.\u201dWithout thinking about it, Oliver left the room he was in and started walking down the hallway as Puppet told him.Oliver focused the energy on his eyes and looked around, but saw nothing.He couldn\u2019t sense anything like when he first came down to the basement.\u201cI can\u2019t see anything?\u201d\u201cI have a lot of love for my lab and I care about security. I put in some protection.\u201d\u201cIs this also a laboratory?\u201d\u201cMost of the basements of District F are labs. It\u2019s usually used for an illegal experiments. I always feel that the land under Landa is useful to both the poor and the wealthy. They use it as a place to hide their personal fetish.\u201dOliver listened quietly.The way he was talking seemed like he know a lot about this world. After all, it was said that he has been living for a very long time, so it may be natural.\u201c\u2026can I ask what you\u2019re doing here?\u201dOliver asked as he passed the lab.Numerous bodies were found in the laboratory.There were traces of surgery rather than a simple corpse, and some of which were masses of flesh skillfully woven to form a human body.It was like the one Oliver saw in the room he first fell into.The only difference was that this one had a much more similar appearance to a person.\u201cOf course, I was doing an experiment.\u201d\u201cExperiment?\u201d\u201cYes, then why would I, a scholar, be wasting my precious time here?\u201dPuppet kept calling himself a scholar several times.From what Oliver had heard, a scholar was a person who was proficient in academia or a person who studies science.It felt like irrespective of being a wizard or a warlock, one can be a scholar.\u201cOf course, people call me a high-risk criminal, an underworld tycoon, a great warlock, but that\u2019s a big mistake. I just want to do research. It\u2019s just that, sometimes it feels a bit insulting, y\u2019know.\u201dHis words were sincere.It seemed like Puppet had a great attachment to his research.Oliver wondered what kind of research he was doing.\u201c\u2026\u2026Can I ask what kind of research you\u2019re doing Mr. Puppet?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026well, it\u2019s not fun to answer right away. Let\u2019s turn the tables for a bit. Why are you working as a Solver? From my point of view, you don\u2019t seem like a person who wants to easily make money with crude black magic skills?\u201dOliver himself thought why he was working as a solver.His thoughts became complicated.After coming out to the world following the advice of the Paladin Joanna, he met Kent and decided to become a solver in order to use the black market without belonging to any organization.After organizing his thoughts he briefly said about this, and hearing that Puppet asked as if he didn\u2019t understand.\u201cWhy are you not interested in being a part of an organization? If you want to use the black market, you\u2019d be better off belonging to an organization.\u201d\u201cUm? When you belong to an organization, there will be times when you have to force yourself to do something you don\u2019t want to do?\u201dOliver said as he recalled Puppeteer Glyph, who was collecting beggars and women to supply the Black hand.\u201cThen, how about attacking a large family and making it yours? After that, the subordinates will do whatever you want to and you don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026That won\u2019t work either.\u201d\u201c\u2026what do you mean?\u201d\u201cI have been in a similar situation in the past. My colleagues work hard, but as time goes on, they stop thinking about themselves and only try to do what I want.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a good thing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s comfortable, but.. How to say it? Um\u2026 Everyone had their own pretty light, but as they just do whatever I want to\u2026 those lights started disappearing.\u201d\u201clight\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, light. Don\u2019t you know about it Mr. Puppet, since you\u2019re also a warlock\u2026 have you ever seen it? A pretty and beautiful light that some people emit\u2026 I left the organization to explore it, and I\u2019m working as a Solver to find out about it. Well, now that I think about it, it seemed like a good choice.\u201dOliver said with sincerity.He hasn\u2019t really learned anything about the beautiful light after leaving the organization, but still, it was quite an enjoyable journey for Oliver.He met Kent and met a lot of other people in pursuit of that beautiful light.In the process, he was able to learn some things about the world, such as Brokers, Solvers, Underworld, gangsters, and Veterans.He even found that a chore boy at the inn could learn to read if he had the courage.Oliver felt that the world was full of such fun things.Listening to Oliver\u2019s story Puppet asked if he was interested.\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand. What is this beautiful light?\u201dOliver didn\u2019t know how to respond or how to describe the beautiful light.\u201cBeautiful light is\u2026.beautiful light.\u201dHe even knew that he himself won\u2019t understand what he just said, but, that was all he could think of.In the past, he had an opportunity to hear from Joanna about this, but unfortunately, he did not get any answer this time.Oliver recalled what Joanna said to him.\u2013 You\u2019re broken.Suddenly, Oliver wondered what Joanna was doing.He heard from the pharmacist that she returned to the Parter church Landa branch safely after negotiations, but did not know what happened to her after that.As Oliver was reminiscing about the past, Puppet said.\u201cYou look like a moth.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cWhen there is light, a moth flies towards it. The funny thing is, it doesn\u2019t even know why it does that. It\u2019s just an instinct\u2026 But you know what\u2026 I don\u2019t hate that kind of attitude. It\u2019s a necessary skill for a scholar.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad. So, now, can you tell me, Mr. Puppet? What are you researching here?\u201dOliver did not expect him to answer, but to his surprise, Puppet responded more docilely than he thought.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m researching how to make a human.\u201d\u201cHuman?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 it\u2019s about resurrecting to be exact, but even after researching for a very long time, none of them I resurrected is a perfect human.\u201dOliver asked with interest.\u201cPerfect Human?\u201d\u201cYes. Oh, let\u2019s go back to the left here\u2026 A perfect Human, a creature that is full of flaws and gets swayed by all the emotions inside them. I imitate the shell, but the inside\u2026\u2026the soul\u2026 it\u2019s just the realm of the gods.\u201dOliver turned to the left as Puppet told him to.There was a door at the end, and it felt similar to going to the Secret Altar with Joseph in the past.\u201cThank you for your kind explanation. By the way, it is strange to ask such a question after asking many things\u2026, but, can I ask why you are answering me so kindly?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it good to be polite? If you live for hundreds of years, life is boring.\u201dPuppet sighed.\u201c\u2026But at the same time, I want to check it out.\u201d\u201cUm, what do you mean?\u201dPuppet did not answer the question, and suddenly the Corpse doll in Oliver\u2019s quarterstaff fell limp like a marionette whose thread got cut.Oliver opened the door without much surprise, and on the inside was a man.A man lying down in his chair.The man lifted his head slightly and said:\u201cWhether I should hand you over to the Demon, or should I use you for myself.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His skin was pale, his nose was hooked, and had prominent cheekbones which gave the impression of a skeleton.Oliver stared at him and asked.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, too\u2026 You have a very unusual body, don\u2019t you, Mr. Puppet?\u201dPuppet smiled slightly.Then he got up from his seat and moved his skinny hand like a skeleton.Along with him, some of the body debris scattered around the room moved, completely blocking the only entrance of the room through which Oliver entered.The entrance was not simply blocked. The teeth, jawbones, and skeletons that were blocking the entrance showed intent to attack and tear anything that approach its way.To Oliver, the figure felt similar to the entrance to hell that the mine supervisors used to about.Oliver said calmly.\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant. Using emotions of hunger and greed on the meatshield, you created such an amazing obstacle.\u201d\u201cAfter all imagination is the basis of black magic\u2026 But it\u2019s you that\u2019s amazing. You understood it as soon as you saw it. I think you\u2019re about 20 years old at most\u2026 Who\u2019s your Master?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fascinating.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s?\u201d\u201cYour disciple asked the same thing. A warlock named Puppeteer Glyph.\u201dOliver said deliberately. He wondered if that could sway Puppet. However, Puppet\u2019s emotions were just as calm as they were at the beginning.\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t know who it is. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve lived for hundreds of years and taught countless disciples. It\u2019s hard to remember every single one. Since I can\u2019t remember, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a worthless guy.\u201dAs soon as he heard those words, Oliver recalled the conversation he had with Puppeteer Glyph.Oliver didn\u2019t remember much, but he clearly remembered the pride Glyph had when he said he was the disciple of Puppet.Thinking about the contradictory nature of the emotions between the two, Oliver said.\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s a little sad.\u201d\u201cSad? What?\u201d\u201cPuppeteer Glyph had a lot of respect for Mr. Puppet. But, Mr. Puppet doesn\u2019t even remember him, it\u2019s\u2026 a little sad.\u201dPuppet stared at Oliver as he slowly approached him.\u201cHuhuhuhu\u2026 Interesting. Looking at you, it seems like you don\u2019t even know what the emotion sad feel like, but still, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s sad\u2026Very interesting. It\u2019s like seeing an animal that mimics humans\u2026 What is your true identity?\u201dWhat is your identity?Oliver didn\u2019t know how to answer this question, so he pondered for a while before answering.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m Dave, a Solver from District T.\u201d\u201cSo, you won\u2019t tell me? Well, I\u2019ll know once I check you out.\u201dWith those words, Puppet lifted his hand, the hand that was engulfed with creepy black emotions.[Thrust]Fortunately, Oliver\u2019s actions were quicker.He fired [Thrust], by converting emotions into shockwaves that results in knocking and destroying the opponent.Oliver fired [Thrust] with its maximum output. He knew instinctively that his opponent wasn\u2019t someone he could deal with in moderation.And, that prediction was correct.\u201cUm\u2026 That body\u2026 what is that?\u201dOliver asked as he watched Puppet recovering his shattered body in an instant.Life-force that could not be thought of as a single person\u2019s, emanated from within Puppet\u2019s body, and the wound healed, it was a truly bizarre sight.But what was even more bizarre was the countless people that popped out from Puppet\u2019s body.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u201cHelp me! Get me out! Kill me!\u201d\u201cHahahahahahahahahahahaha\u201d\u201cKILL KILL KILL KILL KILL KILL KILL!!!!!\u201d\u201cHehaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahaha!!\u201d\u201cOhhhhhhhh! Let\u2019s kill! Let\u2019s kill!\uff01\u201d\u201cMom! Mom! Mom!\u201d\u201cGueeeeek! Gueeeeeeeeeeee!They howled as if they wanted to get out of Puppet\u2019s body. Countless faces and hands protruded from Puppet\u2019s belly, and all they could do was just that and they couldn\u2019t get out of his body.This scene created a strange unpleasantness that could not be expressed with just the word \u2018creepy\u2019. It was at a level that would cause pathological disgust in ordinary people just by looking at it.Of course, Oliver was more curious than disgusted.No matter how much he looked at it, the thing in front of him was a different level of black magic from what he had experienced so far.Oliver was curious as to how such a thing was possible.\u201cWhat\u2019s that body? Is it a combination of a Corpse Doll and Glutton bag?\u201dPuppet looked at his body and answered.\u201cLet\u2019s say that half of your answer is correct.\u201dWith those words, Puppet drew a large amount of emotion from his body.Unlike the warlocks Oliver had met so far, Puppet extracted emotions directly from his own body\u2026 No, that word may be misleading.Rather than from his own body, he forcefully extracted emotions from countless people trapped inside his body.Oliver felt the idea pretty surprising \u2013 the idea of combining a Corpse doll and glutton bag to trap people and extract their emotions.It felt like something that was outside the scope of common black magic.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cHuhuhuhu\u2026. I\u2019m really curious about your identity. You\u2019re not even agitated after watching \u2018This\u2019\u2026 Well, I guess I\u2019ll just have to figure it out slowly from now on, right?\u201dPuppet chattered and slowly turned his emotions into black magic, but without missing the timing, Oliver fired [Hate Bullet].The gathered emotions were destroyed by Oliver\u2019s swift attack.When it comes to firepower battles, the victory goes to Puppet, who had an overwhelming amount of emotion, so Oliver had to push him as hard as he could whenever there was a gap.Puppet, whose attack got counterattacked, said, raising one eyebrow.\u201cHuhuhuhu\u2026 You\u2019ve quite the sense\u2026\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014SHIK!CHURRRRR\u2014\u2014!Oliver\u2019s shadow spikes pierced Puppet\u2019s body.It did not end with that, more thorns sprouted around the pierced spikes, giving another blow from the inside of the body, but\u2026 it didn\u2019t seem like there was any damage to Puppet.Even though his whole body got pierced, he did not scream, but rather broke the shadow spike and escaped on his own, and was recovering again.Each time, the people inside the body screamed horribly.Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!\u201cUm\u2026 It\u2019s not simply physically locking a person in your body.\u201d\u201cCorrect\u2026 Is this the end of your attack?\u201d\u201cno.\u201dOliver said as he pounded his quarterstaff to the floor.A black cube surrounded Puppet, and on the inside of the black cube, it wasn\u2019t just Puppet.In addition to Puppet, there was a minion inside the black cube.A minion that was fed [Las Bomb] and [Explosion Fury] to the max.\u201cMinion, please.\u201dAt those words, the minion that was trapped along with Puppet exploded inside the black cube.It was a huge explosion, and perhaps Oliver would have been swept away with it if he hadn\u2019t limited the firepower by wrapping it in a black cube.The smoke that emanated due to the aftermath of the explosion made it impossible to see inside the Black Cube, but Oliver was sure he had knocked down Puppet.Because he couldn\u2019t see any emotions.However, that was just an illusion.Something flew toward Oliver passing through the black cube.Oliver reflexively fired a bullet of hate and hit it, but to his surprise, it pierced through the bullet of hatred, it even pierced his black suit and hit his shoulder.BAM!This was the first time Oliver had gotten injured after leaving Joseph family.Oliver pulled out what was stuck in his shoulder and checked.It was none other than a finger.Puppet had shot his finger that was filled with black magic, and before Oliver could even think about it, he felt another black magic.As Oliver turned his gaze straight ahead, the remains of corpses lying in the corner of the room suddenly gathered together to form a giant claw arm.An arm that was made of rotten flesh and fingers made of ribs rushed toward Oliver.Oliver hurriedly raised the output of the [Hate Bullet] to the maximum and shot it, but it did not do much damage to the giant arm due to its overwhelming size.BANG\u2014-!!!Claws made of rotten flesh and ribs grabbed Oliver and then slammed him against the wall as hard as they could, causing the wall to crack with a loud noise.In addition, the ribbed fingers of the giant arm were so sharp that if Oliver hadn\u2019t worn the black suit he would have been a lump of chopped meat.Oliver\u2019s spine got broken, his ribs were shattered, and his intestines were crushed.His condition was pretty dangerous, and he could hear the sound of the black suit cracking.\u201c\u2026how did you do it?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dPuppet, who broke the black cube asked.He suffered burns in the aftermath of the explosion and was recovering surprisingly fast, although much of his body was destroyed.Puppet stood as if nothing had happened.\u201cI couldn\u2019t see any emotions for a moment. Whether it\u2019s up there or in the basement here\u2026 How did you do it?\u201d\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t answer it if it was normal, but I\u2019ll answer it this time because your attitude of asking questions even in this situation amazes me. It\u2019s a skill I learned to deal with warlocks with good eyes like you. Surprisingly, it works well in battles between warlocks. Since they mostly rely only on their eyes.\u201d\u201cYou learned?\u2026 Did you learn it from Demon?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 you\u2019re smart.\u201d\u201cYou can hide your emotions, and your body can\u2019t be seen with normal black magic\u2026 Did you get it by worshiping the Demon?\u201dOliver asked, recalling Joseph\u2019s power and talents that were acquired through the Demon.Oliver had no intention of insulting, but for some reason, Puppet\u2019s face suddenly distorted.It was as if Oliver had unintentionally touched his sensitive part.\u201c\u2026. It\u2019s wrong.\u201dPuppet came closer and Oliver could see his emotions, which had always been calm and relaxed, wavered with displeasure.\u201cI\u2019m not serving the Demon\u2026 It\u2019s just a deal. When I do a lot of research, I sometimes get stuck\u2026.. So sometimes\u2026.. It\u2019s just a deal from time to time. \u201d\u201c\u2026 Um, I see.\u201dOliver answered, exploding the emotions in his hands.It was an imitation of the explosion caused by the Explosion Wizard he fought at Murphy\u2019s warehouse. It caused a series of explosions and shattered the giant arm that grabbed Oliver.Without panicking, Puppet flicked his finger and put the shattered corpses back together again.But it didn\u2019t matter. Because Oliver was faster this time.He cast [Targeting] on Puppet\u2019s body and on the ribs and teeth that scattered around.Soon, ribs, bones, and teeth came rushing from all directions and pierced various parts of Puppet\u2019s body, like gunshots that came from all directions.PAP PAP PA APAP\u2014\u2014!!!Thanks to the bones densely embedded in Puppet\u2019s body, Puppet\u2019s movement was sealed for a moment.\u201cTechnique is good, but in the end, it isn\u2019t enough. For me, these are small attacks\u2026.\u201d[Las Bullet]Oliver fired a bullet of hatred mounted with Las Boom that was compressed as much as possible, at the crack in the puppet\u2019s body.Puppet, whose movements got slowed down due to the bones stuck in his body couldn\u2019t defend himself.\u2026. Or, maybe he just didn\u2019t defend himself.BANG\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!It was less powerful than the previous Las Bomb, but there was a strong explosion, and it was more effective because it exploded inside Puppet\u2019s body.The smoke soon got cleared and Puppet\u2019s condition became visible, his upper body had got half blown away due to the explosion.However, it made no sense. His upper body which got shattered by the explosion was recovering at the same time.\u2018No..\u2026. That recovery is not without cost.\u2019Oliver was indeed right.Since the damage was so great, Puppet used the Life-force of the people inside his body to a great extent, which meant that there was definitely a limit.If Oliver could constantly attack him like this, he could knock him down. However, the problem was\u2026\u2014BAM!Puppet\u2019s arms stretched out and grabbed Oliver\u2019s neck.The grip was so strong that the weakened black suit broke at once, making Oliver look like a tortoise that had lost its shell.\u201cI guess you are running out of emotions\u2026 Right?\u201dOliver affirmed Puppet\u2019s question with silence.The grip on Oliver\u2019s neck got stronger.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity. Well, basically, this is the weakness of being a warlock. You\u2026it\u2019s kind of fun, but that\u2019s all. You\u2019re just another genius that comes once in a while. Goodbye Genius Warlock.\u201dWith those words, Puppet brought Oliver in front of his face and opened his mouth.He opened his mouth so wide that it could swallow a whole man, and at that moment, Oliver saw something that could not be found in a human body in Puppet\u2019s mouth. It was\u2026\u201cThis is the entrance to Hell. I\u2019ll swallow you as a whole.\u201dWith his reddish-black mouth, Puppet tried to swallow Oliver.It was not known whether it was real hell or not, but Oliver was engrossed by it as if he was fascinated by the sight that unfolded before his eyes.He even felt something nostalgic.Oliver felt like he was back in his hometown\u2026 And maybe that was why he reached out to it without realizing it himself.And soon, he extracted the fluctuating emotions that were at the entrance of Hell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\u201dPuppet screamed as the emotions got extracted by Oliver through his mouth.He screamed as if someone was forcefully pouring hot molten iron into his mouth, which was an amazing response compared to how relaxed he has been in the face of any attack so far.The scream was so loud that the dirt that had been stuck on the wall fell down. Nevertheless, Oliver did not stop and continued to extract the emotions of Hell through the mouth of Puppet.Oliver didn\u2019t know if this was really the emotion of Hell, but Oliver instinctively got attracted to it, and he extracted as much emotion as possible.\u2018More\u2026more\u2026!more\u2026\u2026!!\u2019\u201cHak!\u201dEventually, the impatient Puppet swung his hands and pulled Oliver out to forcibly stop Oliver\u2019s extraction, but Oliver, who had already extracted a considerable amount, wasn\u2019t satisfied and wanted more, so unknowingly he felt slightly annoyed.BANG!!!!!!\u201cExcuse me, could you please open your mouth one more time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.. Cough!\u201dOliver put the extracted emotions into the test tube and stabbed Puppet\u2019s throat with his quarterstaff.Although it was a light stab, the sounds of the bones cracking inside the throat could be heard.\u201cWhat\u2026? Why is it powerful?\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dAt those words, a [Las bomb] took off from the end of Oliver\u2019s quarterstaff.BOOMBut strangely, the Las Bomb used now somehow felt more powerful than the ones Oliver used before.Oliver wondered whether it was because of the difference in the emotions used.And at that moment, the flesh of Puppet which got scattered all around the place like mud began to come together and merge to form a new body.BAMOliver approached Puppet and asked.\u201cWould you mind opening your mouth again?\u201dThe half-recovered Puppet, who was lying down asked a question instead of answering Oliver\u2019s request.\u201c\u2026\u2026 I apologize. You weren\u2019t a Genius Warlock that comes once in a while. What is your real identity?\u201d\u201cWould you mind opening your mouth again?\u201d\u201cHuhuhuhhuhuhu\u2026\u2026.\u201dPuppet let out a burst of gloomy laughter, then he put his hands on the floor which transferred the emotions in his hands to the floor.The black emotions moved quickly through the cracks of bricks, and Oliver readily moved as if he had predicted it.However, it was not the ground under Oliver\u2019s feet that collapsed this time. The ground under Puppet started to crack, and at the same time, the walls on the four sides creaked as cracks appeared in them.Through the cracks, Oliver could see the zombie army he had seen on the ground.[Shadow Spike][Vine Shadow]Some of the emotions Oliver had extracted were poured into the shadow along with chant.With that, the shadow stretched out like a weed in all directions and began to rip off all the surrounding zombies.Rumble! Rumble\u2014\u2014!Pababat\u2014!\u201cUUUUUUUUUUU!\u201dZombies got shattered in an instant.But it wasn\u2019t that all were broken.A handful of corpse dolls used the zombies as a springboard to narrowly dodge Oliver\u2019s attack and then attacked.\u201cMinion.\u201dAt the same time as the Corpse dolls tried to attack, Oliver made a minion in an instant and intercepted the rushing corpse dolls in midair.The minion quickly approached the corpse dolls at close range and fired bullets of hate to blow the heads of the corpse dolls.Oliver cleared the zombie horde and immediately chased after the puppet down the hole.It was then.\u201cEyaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaea\u2014\u2014\u2014!!!!\u201dAs if it was predicted, at the same time as Oliver descended, a corpse doll came up climbing the hole.The Corpse doll was made of the upper bodies of a woman and a man connected back to back in a grotesque shape like a centipede.As if they were tailored for a weapon, the woman\u2019s eyes were embedded with guns, and steel tongs were planted in her mouth.\u201cEaheheheeawawawwaw\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Bang!!!!Oliver hit the Corpse doll\u2019s face with his quarterstaff without any hesitation.The muzzle stuck in her eye socket and the steel tongs planted in her mouth got shattered, which was personally disappointing for Oliver. If it had been a normal time, he would have caught it and researched it as much as possible.However, he was more curious about Puppet right now than that.\u201cUm\u2026?\u201dWhen the head of the woman was smashed and unable to move, the male upper body attached to it fell off and started to attack Oliver.It stretched out several arms and held on to Oliver tenaciously.Soon, various other corpse dolls started appearing from behind and stretched out dozens of arms and began to wrap Oliver like a ball.As soon as he got covered by corpse dolls in all directions, Oliver heard a sound.Tick-Tick-Tick-Tick-Tick-The sound of a clock was heard inside the body of each corpse doll.Oliver instinctively knew what it was.That\u2019s right, it was a bomb.BOOM BOO BOO BOOM BOOM\u2014-!A big explosion went off.It was a normal bomb, not black magic, and thanks to that, Oliver reacted a bit late.Well, it didn\u2019t matter anywaySince he was wearing a black suit, Oliver didn\u2019t take any damage.As Oliver escaped the explosion and stepped downstairs, he could see a number of corpse dolls.They all seemed pretty well-made, at least as good as the Corpse doll with a saber.\u201cUm\u2026 that\u2019s quite a lot?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s C-class.\u201dThe answer came from one of the corpse dolls among the many corpse dolls that ran toward Oliver.Rather than simply running, they moved in harmony in an organized manner, as natural as a living person.The Warlock and the Sniper corpse doll from the rear provided long-distance support with black magic and guns, respectively.Armed with a saber and an axe, the corpse dolls rushed for close combat.Seven or eight attacks came flying at the same time.Oliver looked around, feeling the illusion as if the time was flowing slowly.Oliver knew which corpse dolls were more dangerous.Shadows, Bullets, Hate Bullets, and Black Javelins were shot by the corpse dolls hiding in the dark.A looter and a mutant corpse doll rushed toward Oliver breaking through walls and ceilings.It would have been fairly intimidating if it had been normal, but Oliver felt a sensation as if his body was floating and was very calm, perhaps it was due to the emotions he extracted from Puppet.No, he was more relaxed than calm.Oliver first used [Vine Shadow] to shatter the shadows of enemies approaching him, then fired [Hate Bullet] to shatter the enemy\u2019s attack.Maybe because of the difference in the quality of emotions, Oliver could easily pierce the enemy\u2019s corpse doll even with a moderate shot.Oliver didn\u2019t stop and naturally swung his quarterstaff as if someone was moving it for him, dealing with nearby enemies.He lifted the head of the mutant corpse doll that rushed up through the wall and crushed it and killed the other corpse dolls who rushed at the same time using [Hate bullets] and [Shadow spike].When the corpse dolls in close proximity got shattered, the corpse dolls in the rear retreated, but Oliver didn\u2019t miss the timing, he concentrated his strength on his legs and narrowed the distance in one breath, then swung his quarterstaff to smash them all.As soon as every Corpse doll got broken into pieces, a clicking sound was heard.The bombs inside the broken corpse dolls got activated at the same time.BOOMAnother explosion erupted in the basement.However, Oliver was not hurt even in the storm of dust. He augmented the black suit by extracting Life-force from the less damaged corpse doll.\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dOliver looked around slowly.The fact that there was another city under Landa seemed to be true.By this point, Oliver couldn\u2019t even fathom the size of the basement, and he wondered what kind of research they were doing there.\u2018I think I can infer about it a little bit.\u2019Oliver thought as he looked at the faintly visible emotions, Life-force, and mana.It was invisible at first, but after nearly being eaten by Puppet, he slowly started seeing them.\u201cUUUUUUUU\u2026\u201d\u201cEakakaha\u201d\u201cAyayayayayaha\u201dThousands of zombies rushed toward Oliver again.Apparently, Puppet seemed to be trying to make Oliver use as much extracted emotions as possible.Oliver gathered the emotions into his fingertips with the idea of doing what he wanted.Kwagwagwang\u2014\u2014!QUAJIK!DODDDDOOODOODO!BOOM!After defeating numerous zombies, Oliver entered a room.There were so many zombies, contrary to what Oliver thought, he almost used up the emotions he barely extracted, and fortunately, Puppet no longer ran away and welcomed Oliver.\u201cHuhuhuhu\u2026 You came?\u201dHe was swallowing people with his mouth wide open like a glutton bag.Judging by the aura he felt inside Puppet, he didn\u2019t seem to have swallowed one or two people.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry for running away. I hope you understand. It\u2019s my principle not to fight when I\u2019m at a disadvantage.\u201d\u201cNo, I understand. I think the same way\u2026 This place is\u2026?\u201dOliver looked around the room and asked.\u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s a laboratory. Coincidentally, the original owner of this place\u2026. the wizard studied a field similar to mine. So I\u2019m borrowing it for a while.\u201dPuppet spoke with sincerity.\u201cWhat experiments did you do here?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? I did experiments to revive people.\u201d\u201cOh, did you? Were there any results?\u201d\u201c\u2026. Somewhat? However, there was a block, so I tried to hand over the solvers to the Demon for some help, but unfortunately, it crossed paths with you. I\u2019ll ask you again, what are you? I\u2019ve seen all kinds of people in my more than a hundred years of life, but this is the first time I\u2019ve ever met a chap like you.\u201d\u201cMe. I\u2019m just a solver from District T\u2026 I have a question for you. By any chance, does the experiment to resurrect a human include the experiments of creating a human soul?\u201dPuppet paused for a second.Apparently, Oliver seemed to have asked the right question.\u201cAs expected, I shouldn\u2019t just hand you over to the Demon. How the hell did you know?\u201dOliver said while looking up.\u201cUm? I can see them now.\u201dWith those words, Oliver pounded the quarterstaff to the floor.Through the quarterstaff, emotions moved toward the ground and from there to the brick gap and soon reached the ceiling.With that, the ceiling bricks moved and opened.Without hesitation, Oliver jumped towards it.\u201cStop!\u201dPuppet shouted as he stretched out his arms.But Oliver was faster.Oliver climbed the wall and entered the hidden secret room, which contained a number of gigantic flasks.Each of the flasks contained emotions, Life-force, and mana, and the amount was quite substantial.Oliver understood what happened to all the warlocks and looters in the contaminated zone.The most notable flask among the large number of flasks kept in the room was the largest flask that was connected to all the flasks.In the center was a circular flask, in which human emotions, Life-force, and mana got mixed and agglutinated together to form a Soul.Of course, it wasn\u2019t a real soul, it was a fake one, but the perfection was pretty good even in Oliver\u2019s eyes, who was seeing it for the first time.\u201cYoung Chap, that\u2019s rude. To enter someone else\u2019s lab\u2026 I hid it perfectly, how did you find it?\u201dPuppet came up and warned. He harbored doubts and curiosity along with intense anger.\u201cUm\u2026 How? Because I was able to see it. I\u2019m sorry for barging in. I\u2019ve used a lot of emotions right now. I have to make up for the unfavorable fight since it\u2019s also my principle not to fight in an unfavorable fight.\u201dWith those words, Oliver swung the quarterstaff to break the test tube containing the unstable \u2018artificial soul\u2019.BANG\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u201dWith a loud explosion sound accompanied by Puppet\u2019s grief scream, the glass covering the artificial soul shattered, exposing it, and Oliver reached into the air and extracted the soul.Oliver threw away his usual temperance and recalled the life-threatening fight he had with Joanna in the past.At that moment the vast emotions of the artificial soul that got concentrated in his hands scattered all around the place.\u201cWhat\u2026 this is\u2026\u201d[Shadow Spike]From the black emotions that dyed the surroundings, a shadow spike sprouted and attacked Puppet in response to Oliver\u2019s cry.Due to the huge chunk of emotions, the spell had a lot of power and it literally tore Puppet to pieces.Up until now, Oliver has always used the least amount of energy to save emotions as much as possible, but at this moment there was no need for that.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!\u201dHumans entrapped in Puppet\u2019s body screamed, and Puppet\u2019s body recovered in an instant.The recovery rate had increased tremendously, and he also seemed like having no intention of dealing with Oliver in moderation anymore.Puppet squeezed the humans within his body and drew in a ton of emotions.Probably, it would have ended up being dangerous for Oliver if he hadn\u2019t found the secret laboratory.Puppet cast a lot of black magic, scattering the corpses inside him in the air.[Finger Gun][Bone Bullet][Lip Spear][Skull Bomb][Contagion Hand]He activated black magic that uses emotions and corpses.It was a mix of the manipulation series and the firearms series, and due to that, it was much more efficient and powerful.And of course, it didn\u2019t mean much to Oliver right now, so instead of dodging the dozens of attacks flying toward him, he just swung his hand.\u201cEat and clean up. EATER.\u201dWith those words, an amorphous existence with only human teeth jumped out of the black emotion that dyed all sides of the room and swallowed up Puppet\u2019s attack.\u201cWhat the FU*\u2026\u201d\u2014Pooh![Shadow Spike]Before Puppet could finish his words, Oliver used a shadow spike once more.Dozens of sharp, slender spikes of shadows protruded from all directions and pierced Puppet, along with dozens of thorns sprouting from the spikes.Chuck Chuck Chuck Chuck \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014!!!!Puppet, whose body is pierced with thorns was relaxed.\u201cI\u2019m glad\u2026it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\u201cYou will still take damage, right?\u201dOliver pounded the ground with his quarterstaff.With a tick-tock sound, the shadow spikes exploded, and just like in the first fight with Puppet, Puppet\u2019s flesh got scattered everywhere.When the flesh got scattered, Oliver attacked as much as possible to accumulate damage.Puppet pretended to be preoccupied with Oliver\u2019s attack, but in fact, he was trying to attack Oliver from behind.However, when he tried to attack\u2026 Oliver blocked it\u201cHOW? I hid my emotions.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? I can see it now.\u201dWith those words, Oliver concentrated his strength on the quarterstaff and smashed Puppet.His body got dented and took damage, but it was still solid.Puppet\u2019s body clung to Oliver\u2019s quarterstaff like mud, as if he wouldn\u2019t let it go.\u201cI came here to play, but now I feel like I\u2019m working.\u201d[Explosion Fury]Although the range was narrow, a more powerful and condensed explosion erupted inside the puppet\u2019s body.Everything perished within the explosion range, as if being devoured, and the recovering puppet staggered back.\u201cUgh\u2026.. ! You\u2019re strong. I can\u2019t win.\u201d\u201cThanks for the compliment. It must be a little tough with that body.\u201dWhen Oliver said that, he fired [Hate Bullet] like a machine gun.Instead of piercing the body, he shot with the intention of turning Puppet into a rag, and in the fear that Puppet might run away, Oliver grabbed his leg with [Vine Shadow] and stabbed him with [Shadow spikes] from all directions, literally trying to kill him.Oliver thought he had to do something like this to suppress Puppet.The whole lot of emotions that filled the room slowly started to show the bottom.Fortunately, the effort didn\u2019t betray Oliver, the recovery speed of Puppet\u2019s body started to slow down, and his body turned into a rag.It was then\u2026With the swelled flesh all around his body Puppet rushed toward Oliver, throwing his broken body as if he was peeling off his skin.Due to the speed, Oliver\u2019s response got one beat delayed, but fortunately, he was able to respond.\u201cMinion.\u201dThe minion he had kept in his arms abruptly popped out and fired a [Hate bullet] at the rushing Puppet.The power wasn\u2019t particularly strong, but it was strong enough to damage Puppet\u2019s weakened body.BANG\u2014!With an explosion Puppet\u2019s upper body and lower body got separated.Puppet smiled and said while looking at his body\u201cHuhuhhuhuhu\u2026 In my long lifetime, this was the first time something like this has happened. I lost to a warlock who has been on this field for less than a year.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to Mr. Puppet\u2019s courtesy of using only one hand.\u201dOliver looked down at Puppet and thanked him sincerely.\u201cHuhuhuhu\u2026 did you notice it?\u201cJust a while ago. Where is your real body\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s a sensitive question that I can\u2019t answer.\u201d\u201cUm, It\u2019s ok\u2026 and I\u2019m also sorry for ruining the lab. I didn\u2019t want to die.\u201dPuppet looked at Oliver in wonder, with eyes that couldn\u2019t understand what kind of being was in front of him.\u201cApology\u2026 I\u2019ll take it. Things got messed up, but I saw something interesting\u2026 Are you really not going to tell me who you are?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just a solver from District T.\u201d\u201cHuhuhuhu, I can\u2019t believe I got rejected three times\u2026 Anyway, I\u2019ll believe you. Little chap, let\u2019s meet again next time.\u201dWith those words, the light slowly faded from the eyes of the body, which turned into ashes and faded away.Oliver didn\u2019t mean to stop him and he just mumbled sadly.\u201cUm\u2026I\u00a0 didn\u2019t ask why he was trying to resurrect a perfect human.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 90": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the fight with Puppet, Oliver searched the basement.It was a natural procedure.As an executive of the Black Hand, there was a high probability that there would be books on black magic and demons in his hideout that he used to sweep through the contaminated zone.Oliver searched the place desperately in the hopes that he would find books that would quench some of his curiosity.However, the world doesn\u2019t always work out the way you want it to.He searched the basement as hard as he could, but unfortunately, contrary to his expectations, he could not find anything.He expected that there would be quite a few books, but the whole place was empty as if it was cleaned by someone.In the end, Oliver decided to compromise himself with some relatively less damaged Corpse dolls, laboratory tools, emotions in a flask, and a notebook with instructions on how to make Corpse dolls.\u201cIt\u2019s really sad\u2026 Well, it was a fun experience, so it wasn\u2019t regrettable?\u201dOliver murmured as he recalled the entrance to hell and the artificial soul he saw thanks to Puppet.It was something that he still did not understand, but he instinctively knew that it was something great.If there was an opportunity, he thought he should ask Puppet to teach him about that.Leaving behind such regrets, Oliver took out some emotions and brought them close to a wall.It was to explore the structure of the basement, which was like a huge ant den.Ant dens that were purposely built as large and complex.It felt like they were trying to hide something, and at that moment, Puppet\u2019s words came to Oliver\u2019s mind.It was the words about the many illegal experiments that were conducted in the basement of District F, and how, among them, some of which were related to demons.It was something that had nothing to do with Oliver at the moment, but he felt it a little bit interesting \u2013 the fact that the Wizards also try to communicate with the Demons.Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk.Oliver climbed up the secret staircase and placed the hand that had emotions against the wall.Black emotions moved through the cracks in the bricks, and a door suddenly appeared.From the door, something suddenly came rushing toward Oliver.BANGIt was the fist of Knuckle Joe.\u201c\u2026is everyone okay?\u201dOliver asked, blocking Joe\u2019s fist with his quarterstaff.Joe\u2019s body was wet with blood and sweat, and his eyes widened when he saw Oliver as if he saw someone who died come back to life\u201c\u2026you, how\u2026?\u201d\u201cI came up the stairs. Are you okay?\u201dJoe frowned and clenched his fists.He was still surprised to see Oliver and behind him, there were Sam and Arthur, who lay down on the ground, in a state similar to Joe\u2019s.They didn\u2019t die, but their whole body was drenched in sweat, and their clothes were torn here and there like a rag.But what stood out more than that was the swarm of zombies that were scattered around as if the connection to control got cut off.\u201cYou fell down and all of a sudden\u2026 zombies appeared from everywhere.\u201d\u201cYes, I saw it.\u201d\u201cWe fought hard, but in the end, we were suppressed, but they didn\u2019t kill us\u2026. And then we suddenly collapsed. So, what happened?\u201dOliver pondered for a moment.He thought about how he should explain.The part which he felt would be hard to explain was the entrance to Hell that Puppet showed him when he tried to swallow him.Oliver managed to escape the crisis by extracting the emotions from there, but it seemed impossible to explain it as it is.It felt like Hell was also something similar to the books about Demons \u2013 topics that should not be spoken to anyone carelessly, and if he did, it seemed like it would put his life in danger.Most of all, it also seemed like if he said that he knocked down Puppet alone, the whole thing would become very complicated and annoying.It was true that he needed a reputation as a Solver, but this one seemed like something he would not be able to handle right now.And, it wasn\u2019t just his skills that took down Puppet.For that reason, in the end, Oliver decided to tweak the truth \u2013 to Lie.\u201cPuppet released me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.What?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 He lured me down and took me somewhere, then he restrained me, and then he suddenly let me go.\u201d\u201cHe just let you go?\u201d\u201cYes, he said he wanted to look at me in person and then let me go\u2026 funny guy, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!!!!!!\u201dJoe, Arthur, and Sam all looked at Oliver without saying a word.Their reaction said that they could not believe the story, but their emotions were dyed with nothing but suspicion.Arthur gasped and said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but are you serious?\u2026 He could have killed us all, but suddenly he just let us all go?\u201dOliver spoke calmly to be persuasive.\u201cUh, yes. He said he got everything he needed and had fun, so said he\u2019ll just let us go.\u201d\u201cHmm, I see.\u201dJoe responded as if he understood, but Arthur shook his head as if he was still confused.\u201cDoesn\u2019t this feel very strange?\u201dTired Oliver passed Joe and walked over to Arthur.One of his golem\u2019s hands was completely shattered, and the other was also half broken.\u201cI think it\u2019s very strange, too, but isn\u2019t it good that we\u2019re alive for now?\u201dArthur looked at Oliver in amazement, and then he sighed.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I apologize for the stupid question.\u201d\u201cNo. Thank you for understanding\u2026 Then, shall we go up now?\u201dJoe, Sam, Arthur, and Oliver went back the way they came and climbed to the top.As they climbed up and opened the door, a group of Goodman mercenaries and a group of Solvers greeted Oliver\u2019s party.\u201cDamn! They were alive!\u201d\u201cHow\u2026!\u201d\u201cI won! Give me your money.\u201dWhen they saw Oliver\u2019s group, they were surprised.There were those who were genuinely surprised, there were those who did not believe, and there were those who were happy to win the bet.But what stood out the most was the greedy expression, as if they had discovered gold, like the captain of the Goodman Mercenaries.\u201cI\u2019m glad everyone came back safely\u2026 What the hell happened down there?\u201dAs Oliver was about to answer, Joe intercepted.\u201cFirst of all, getting out is the first priority\u2026. The number of people has decreased. What happened?\u201dHugh replied while hesitating as if he got pushed back in the fight.\u201cAh\u2026that is, when the zombies on the outside suddenly collapsed, most of them ran away. We\u2019re the only ones left here.\u201dHugh spoke proudly as if to prove their friendship, but it did not matter to Joe.\u201cI can\u2019t believe we went down for those guys.\u201d\u201cBut, isn\u2019t it good that everyone left safely?\u201dOliver said without thinking, but Joe looked at Oliver with emotions of dissatisfaction and incomprehension, and then he lowered his eyes.\u201cHuh\u2026 that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell happened? Puppet?\u201dHugh interjected again.He asked, expecting an answer while looking into Oliver\u2019s eyes, but when Oliver tried to answer, Arthur intervened.\u201cFor now, let\u2019s move, the explanation comes later. Hey, you guys, get ready to move quickly. It might be okay right now, but zombies may appear again later\u2026 Hey, buddy. Get ready to move too.\u201dArthur advised Oliver to move, and there was a bit of greed, along with concern for Oliver in his emotions.Oliver did not know why, but he nodded his head to Arthur\u2019s question and prepared to move with him.Shortly after, Oliver came out of the building along with members of the Fighter Crew, Goodman Mercenaries, and Arthur\u2019s Solver Team.As Hugh said, all the zombies outside the building had collapsed, and Puppet seemed to have kept his promise.Oliver felt that Puppet was kind enough to let them all go, but still, the vigil in the eyes of everyone did not disappear. After all, everyone suffered a great deal from the zombie army.As they passed through the hordes of fallen zombies, finally they saw a group of soldiers in the distance.At first, everyone rubbed their eyes wondering if it was a mistake, but it wasn\u2019t a mistake.The city\u2019s defense force, which was guarding the contaminated zone, was coming in their direction.There were not just one or two, but a well-formed squadron of several hundred men. In addition to ordinary soldiers armed with rifles and heavy weaponry, there were also about thirty soldiers armed with exoskeleton armor and two War Wizards.At first, everyone was delighted to see the defense force, but soon, they hardened their faces looking at the eyes of Soldiers coming toward them, the eyes that looked at them as criminals rather than victims.It felt like they were marching toward them to arrest them rather than rescue them, and as if to prove their suspicion was true, once they got closer to a certain extent, the soldiers surrounded Oliver\u2019s group.Oliver understood why the Solvers and Mercenaries did not trust the city\u2019s defense force and why they hated them.Arthur pulled his tired body forward and shouted.\u201cWhat the fu*k is the meaning of this\u2026 We Solvers are the janitors who fu*king clean your sh*ts, and this is how you\u2019re gonna treat us!\u201dAt that moment, a man emerged from among the trained soldiers.He was wearing a suit in contrast to the soldiers in military uniform, and he had a very tired expression in contrast to his youthful appearance.He was someone everyone knew.It was none other than the city official who gave a brief explanation before entering the contaminated zone.He took out his speaker and said.\u201cAh-! Ah! Hello, Solvers\u2026 I came here directly after a report came in. I\u2019m sorry but throw away the weapons you have. I say again. Please disarm yourself.\u201dAfter disarming as the city official said, Oliver was led into a building by the soldiers and was confined in a room.The room wasn\u2019t narrow, but it was dark, not just normal dark, very dark, where nothing could be seen.There was magic in the darkness, the magic power to weaken people\u2019s minds.Of course, it wasn\u2019t much of a problem for Oliver, but Oliver stayed still.Oliver knew that someone was monitoring the room through a surveillance device secretly embedded in the side of the room, so he did not show any suspicious or hostile movements.Was it because of that, after a while, someone finally came in.It was the city official who asked everyone to disarm.\u201cHello, Mr. Dave.\u201dThe official sat down with a formal greeting.He still looked tired, but his tired eyes with dark circles contained a sharp light.\u201cHello?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, sorry for bringing you here. I received a report tha\u2026\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 What\u2019s your name?\u201dThe conversation got interrupted.The city official\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? I\u2019d been taught that I need to know the name of the person in order to talk to that person.\u201dThe city official looked at Oliver silently. It was as if he was trying to figure out what Oliver was trying to do.\u201c\u2026Sorry, in this place, I\u2019ll be the one who asks the question. You answer it. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 yes.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then I\u2019ll ask you. First, according to the Solvers who came in, a high-risk criminal named Puppet dug a trap in the contaminated zone and attacked the Solvers, right?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThen you got locked up in a building?\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI heard that you were the first to recognize Puppet, is that true?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s true. However, I didn\u2019t recognize that it was Mr. Puppet. I just noticed that it was a Corpse doll. Afterward, Mr. Puppet just revealed his identity.\u201dHearing the answer, the city official muttered.\u201cCorpse doll\u2026.a high-performance zombie made with the human corpse as a base.\u201d\u201cHuh? You know?\u201d\u201cIf you want to work for the Landa Department of the Interior, you need to know the basics. And, as I said earlier, I ask the questions.\u201d\u201cAh, sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026how did you find out?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen someone who used a Corpse doll in the past.\u201d\u201cNot everyone can use a Corpse doll, it\u2019s amazing that you met one by coincidence.\u201d\u201cOh, is it? It\u2019s a fun technique, but I didn\u2019t know it was like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026?Is something wrong with my answer?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026why did you go down to fight Puppet?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it dangerous to stand still? So I just said I would fight, and he accepted it\u2026.Mr. Puppet was kind.\u201dThe city official laughed.\u201cPuppet is kind\u2026 What did you do when you got down?\u201dOliver said about going down with Joe, Sam, and Arthur, being ambushed and falling into the trap, and going down alone.\u201cDid you meet Puppet over there?\u201dAs he told his companions, Oliver told the story he came up with without a single error.As if his story actually worked, the city official quickly processed the information in his head and nodded.\u201cSo\u2026 he just released you?\u201d\u201cYes, after restraining me, he looked at me, and then released me saying that it was enough. He told me it was fun.\u201d\u201cHe said it was fun?\u201d\u201cYes, I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I feel like I know.\u201d\u201cReally? What is it\u2026 Ah, I\u2019m sorry. Officer will be the one who will be asking questions.\u201d\u201c\u2026Can I ask you a simple question? It\u2019s a personal curiosity.\u201d\u201cYes, tell me.\u201d\u201cWhy are you attaching Mr. whenever you\u2019re calling Puppet?\u201dThe city official blatantly narrowed his eyes. It was more of an inquiry than a question.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a habit.\u201d\u201cHabit?\u201d\u201cYes, I was taught to be respectful from a young age. If it makes you uncomfortable, I\u2019ll stop.\u201dInstead of answering, the city official stared at Oliver as if judging something.He was constantly calculating something in his head and was in a state of deep trouble.\u201c\u2026you said you talked to Puppet, what kind of conversation did you have?\u201d\u201cThis and that.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHe told me that there are a lot of illegal laboratories in the basement of Landa.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s a public fact. Other than that?\u201d\u201cWell, we also talked about his research.\u201d\u201cResearch?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA light shone in the eyes of the tired city official.\u201cBe specific\u2026\u201d\u201cGet out of the way. When it comes to black magic and demons, our Parter Church has priority. It\u2019s written in the city agreement, so you have no right to stop us.\u201dAt that moment, the sound of someone arguing came through the door.Oliver and the city official turned their heads toward the door, and the door opened with a bang.A man and woman came in, and among them, one was someone Oliver knew.It was Paladin Joanna.\u201cPaladin Elton from the Parter church Landa branch. We\u2019ll take over from here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe appearance of Paladins Elton and Joanna caused outright irritation in the emotions of the city official.The reason was unknown, but he did not seem to like the Paladins very much, yet he stood up and greeted them formally.\u201c\u2026. Nice to meet you, Sir. This is Paul Carver from the Landa Department of the Interior. It is a pleasure to meet the Paladins who are the guardians of mankind.\u201dThe city official, no, Paul Carver lied naturally.As if to repay this, the Paladin named Elton also answered with a lie.\u201cNice to meet you too.\u201d\u201cSir, there must have been a guard outside, how did you get in?\u201dUpon hearing the question, Elton put his hand under his iron coat and pulled out a piece of paper.The paper was whiter than the clouds as if it was emitting light.\u201cI came in justly according to the provisions of the city contract. You\u2019ve worked hard so far. From now on, we\u2019ll be interrogating this warlock. You can leave.\u201dThe man named Elton spoke in a hard, coercive tone befitting his solemn appearance.But Paul did not lose either.\u201cI think you\u2019ve misunderstood something, Sir, we\u2019re not interrogating. We were just investigating. This person\u2026\u2026is not a criminal, but a worker from the Solver\u2019s guild that belongs to the city.\u201dAt the unexpected words, Oliver looked at Paul.He did not have any particular feelings for Oliver but spoke that way due to his hatred against the Paladin.Paladin Elton answered.\u201cI know. But, Puppet has appeared, and it\u2019s up to us to decide whether the subject is an investigation or an interrogation. I\u2019m sorry, but please step back.\u201d\u201cIt is true that we have to cooperate according to the city agreement, but we are investigating first, so please wait for a while.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a request. There\u2019s nothing in the city contract that says we have to give the subject we\u2019re investigating right away. I\u2019m sorry, Paladin. This is Landa.\u201d\u201cDo you plan on interfering with a Paladin\u2019s work?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just doing my job. Just like you, Paladin.\u201dThe atmosphere got tense.Oliver did not know why, but the city official and the Paladin seemed to hate each other, which created a sense of tension that seemed to break any second, and Oliver watched the scene with interest.As the tension gradually increased and reached the limit, a woman opened the door and entered.She had short hair and wore a suit, and Oliver instinctively understood that she was a city official like Paul.The atmosphere was very similar.She approached Paul and whispered.It was hard to hear what she was talking about, but after a moment of annoyance in Paul\u2019s emotions, he relaxed his impression as if he had accepted the situation.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 I guess I made a mistake, Sir. Since something unpleasant happened in the contaminated zone, I got too emotional. I\u2019m sorry, Paladins.\u201d\u201c\u2026No. It\u2019s good to be zealous about one\u2019s work. I think it\u2019s a virtue that our holy Father bestowed upon us, humans.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Well then, I\u2019ll take my leave, Paladin\u2026 Dave?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cPlease faithfully participate in the investigation of the Paladins.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026, yes. Nice to meet you. Officer Paul.\u201dOliver replied calmly.City official Paul left, leaving the two paladins in the room.The tension quickly faded, and instead, a sense of hostility and hatred towards the warlock took its place.It was clearly visible without even looking at the emotions of Paladin Elton.\u201cName.\u201dPaladin Elton asked as he sat down.Appearing to be middle-aged, he had voluminous hair and a beard, and his facial features perfectly resembled a stone sculpture.Emotions also became hard and rigid, as if following his appearance.Oliver observed him calmly and answered.\u201cMy name is Dave. I\u2019m a solver from District T.\u201dFLUTTER FLUTTER.Paladin Elton spoke, as he scanned the files.\u201cWho is the broker in charge?\u201d\u201cMr. Forrest on Street 27.\u201dThe file folder fluttered once again.\u201cHow did you come into contact with him?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOliver didn\u2019t answer and just looked at Elton.He looked like a lion because of his thick hair and beard, and he glared at Oliver as if he was looking at his prey.It looked like if Oliver showed the slightest weakness, he would bite him.Maybe it was a normal reaction. After all, Paladins are beings that fight warlocks.\u2018No, was it the Demons?\u2019Oliver felt absurd looking at the situation where a Paladin unconditionally opposes a Warlock.He felt that it would be nice if he could talk without hostility even if he could not be friendly.Oliver unconsciously looked at Joanna, who was sitting next to Elton.\u201cHey, Answer?\u201dAt Elton\u2019s anger-filled words, Oliver asked cautiously.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but do I have to answer? I think it\u2019s getting a bit personal.\u201dHearing Oliver\u2019s answer, Elton said, putting his hands together and leaning his torso slightly forward.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t tell me. Then, I can arrest you and take you away according to the city agreement.\u201d\u201c\u2026.Can you do that?\u201dElton muttered in a low, resentful voice.\u201cOf course, you are a warlock. You are a scum that corrodes society. A potential danger that threatens the human world\u2026.\u201dWhatever he said, he was sincere, so Oliver explained everything. He was also afraid of being arrested.\u201cOkay\u2026.. I\u2019ll answer. I got introduced to him.\u201d\u201cIntroduced? Who?\u201d\u201cFrom a Solver who worked with Mr. Forrest in the past. He introduced me, and thanks to him, I was able to easily get into a contract with Mr. Forrest.\u201d\u201cWho is that solver? How did you meet?\u201dOliver pondered whether or not to answer.He did not want to give Kent\u2019s name\u2026.. But, the situation deemed it.Elton was asking for confirmation rather than being curious. Oliver did not know how, but he seemed to already know about Kent\u2019s existence, and if Oliver lied, he was ready to bite him.\u201cAnswer?\u201d\u201cHis name is Kent.\u201d\u201cKent?\u201d\u201cYes, he was the person who bought me and taught me about the outside world.\u201dOliver lied.It was not a lie on the spur of the moment, it was a lie that was made after talking with Kent.Kent suggested that it would be appropriate, and Oliver who wanted to hide the fact about his Master and his life in the Joseph family also felt the same way, so he accepted it.Fortunately, the Paladin did not have any doubts.\u2018Are there many such children?\u2019\u201cWhere were you before you got sold?\u201d\u201cI was in a mine.\u201d\u201cMine? Where?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. It was just a Mine.\u201d\u201cWhat are the features of that mine?\u201d\u2018Features\u2026..\u2019\u201cIt was dark and deep, and there were a lot of kids. The supervisor hit the kids frequently. May I ask why you are asking that?\u201d\u201cThe question is mine. Warlock\u2026, is it true that you met Puppet alone?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy? As a warlock, you do know how evil Puppet was, right?\u201dElton\u2019s emotions shone strongly with suspicion.Oliver responded as he did with Paul earlier.\u201cIt was because it was the only way I could survive.\u201d\u201cSo you went alone to deal with the infamous Puppet?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t go alone. I went with other colleagues.\u201d\u201cYeah, I know. One soldier Solver and the two warlocks hired by the Goodman mercenaries. I\u2019ve already investigated them all. Thanks to that, I know that you\u2019re the only one who actually met Puppet\u2026 What did you do with Puppet?\u201d\u201cWe talked, we fought, I lost, but he let me go.\u201d\u201cDid he release you?\u201d\u201cYes, he released after saying it was fun.\u201d\u201cFun? What?\u201d\u201cUm? We talked about something before we fought, maybe he liked that?\u201d\u201c\u2026 What did you talk about?\u201d\u201cThis and that. He talked about his research.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of research?\u201d\u201cHe said that he was doing research on making a Perfect Human\u2026. to be more precise, resurrecting them.\u201d\u201cYou mean resurrecting people?\u201d\u201cYeah, at least that\u2019s what he said with his own mouth.\u201dElton, who was skeptical, took out a notebook from his pocket and began to write.The sound of scribbled letters reverberated quietly, and then Elton asked.\u201cBy the way, I have a doubt. Why did Puppet tell you about his research?\u201d\u201cUm? Maybe because I asked him?\u201d\u201cHe said because you asked him?\u201d\u201cYes, he was kind.\u201dKind. At those words, Elton\u2019s expression hardened.He showed disgust as if he was looking at a human sh*t.\u201cDid I say anything wrong?\u201d\u201cWrong\u2026 The wrong you did was to learn black magic. Do you know about the notoriety of Puppet?\u201d\u201cTo a certain extent\u2026 He lived for hundreds of years, there are rumors that he\u2019s immortal, and I also heard that he was active in various fields such as drugs, weapons, illegal medicine, and demon worship.\u201d\u201cYeah. Besides, he has done countless human experiments around the world. I saw those horrific experiments and the victims. He once took control of a small rural village and used dozens of humans living there as guinea pigs.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s calm response, Elton\u2019s expression grew more serious.Oliver didn\u2019t understand what he was dissatisfied with.It was said that it was an open secret that numerous human experiments are carried out in the laboratories by Wizards in District F.Oliver wondered whether the Paladins did not know about this, or was it okay if it was a human experiment conducted by a wizard?Oliver still did not understand what people were thinking.Despite the situation being the same, they are sensitive at times and insensitive at other times.It felt like everything was too fickle, inconsistent, and jagged.Oliver found it interesting.\u201cThat\u2019s why we Paladins chase after Puppet. His mere existence is dangerous for good people. I actually defeated him a few times, but he reappears laughing every time\u2026 My goal is to get rid of him and make the world safe. \u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really strange in that sense\u2026 a guy like Puppet showing mercy on someone.\u201d\u201cAs I said before\u2026\u201d\u201cYou want me to believe that? That he even gave you a lecture about his research. Very funny.\u201dElton said with a twinkle in his eyes.If he could, he wanted to beat the sh*t out of Oliver right away.\u201cCan you prove that you have nothing to do with Puppet?\u201d\u201cProof?\u201d\u201cYeah, proof that you have nothing to do with him.\u201dOliver tried to think logically.\u201c\u2026. Can you prove that I\u2019ve something to do with him?\u201d\u201cI might. If I use my hands to speak with you.\u201dIt was a bluff.He wanted to do it, but because of something he could not torture Oliver.So, he was hoping that Oliver would say something suspicious by putting pressure on him like this.\u201cI can only tell you that I have nothing to do with him.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then answer me this. Aren\u2019t warlocks a species that would do anything if they could be strong? Did Puppet not suggest anything?\u201d\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t. However, I got an offer like that from another warlock some time ago.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 what\u2019s the suggestion?\u201d\u201cHe said he would make me join the Black Hand if I handed over the beggar children and women to him. He said I would be able to improve my skills in no time.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, I said no. I thought it would be easy to learn black magic if I entered Black Hand, but I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201c\u2026. why?\u201d\u201cI did not want to offer the kids and women.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026 A warlock refused the opportunity to enter Blackhand because he didn\u2019t want to sacrifice some mere beggars?\u201d\u201cYes, even mere beggars are humans like everyone\u2026 like Mr. Paladin, aren\u2019t they?\u201dBANG\u2014!Elton smashed the table with his fist.Even though his hands were not strengthened by Paladin\u2019s powers, the table got split into two, and Oliver, who has no emotions, was in danger of being stabbed to death if this man attacked him now.Oliver hated being in pain or dying, and fortunately, no such tragedy occurred.Joanna whispered something to calm Elton, and he quickly regained his composure.Oliver wondered what she talked about, and he regretted that he couldn\u2019t talk with Joanna or ask her questions about his current status.It was very regrettable. He wanted to thank her for giving him advice, the advice that made him come to the outside world, because of which he was having so much fun.\u2018It\u2019s a pity.\u2019While Oliver was regretting that he couldn\u2019t talk to Joanna, Elton sat down and asked again.\u201cIn short, you and Puppet have nothing to do with each other?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dElton stared at Oliver for a moment, then got up and left.After remaining in the room for a few more hours Oliver was able to get out.Looking at the attitude of the city official and Paladin, he thought something serious might happen, but fortunately, nothing like that happened.He wanted to experience a lot more, so he didn\u2019t want to get caught up in this kind of commotion.There was also the option of throwing away his identity, but he didn\u2019t want to use that method as much as possible because of the things he had accumulated so far.\u201cHere\u2019s your stuff.\u201dA woman handed a bunch of luggage over the tempered glass-covered counter.She didn\u2019t do anything special with Oliver\u2019s luggage.There was an empty test tube after use, a wallet-sized glutton bag, and a glutton bag in a leather case.The woman said to Oliver who was checking his items.\u201cIt\u2019s illegal to carry such glutton bags undetected. This is a special case, so we\u2019ll leave it, but in other cases, it can be annoying for both of us.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll keep that in mind. Thanks for the kind explanation.\u201dThe woman looked at Oliver with a slightly startled look.Oliver asked.\u201cUm\u2026 can I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBy any chance, do you know where my quarterstaff is?\u201d\u201cQuarterstaff?\u201d\u201cYes, a wooden staff. It has a bandage in the middle.\u201d\u201cIs it important?\u201dA voice asked from behind.Oliver answered.\u201cYes, it\u2019s something important. Because I got it as a gift\u2026 Paladin Joanna?\u201dOliver answered, looking at Joanna holding Kent\u2019s quarterstaff.\u201cDo you know my name?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Didn\u2019t we see in the room earlier?.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you my name.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026.. you didn\u2019t tell?\u201d\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t tell you.\u201dJoanna answered firmly.\u2018Um..\u2026.\u2019Oliver was in a pinch.He wondered whether he could get out of the situation by saying she looked like a person named Joanna he knew, but thought it would be more suspicious and decided not to say it.In the end, Oliver decided to change the topic of the conversation.\u201cBy the way, it\u2019s mine. Ms. Paladin.\u201d\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I borrowed it for a while. I wanted to know if it had any kind of evil spell.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 did you find it?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s clean\u2026 Can I talk to you for a moment\u2026\u2026\u2026 Oliver?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was 27th Street in District T.Just yesterday, Puppet appeared in the contaminated zone and killed many Solvers, but the streets here were as peaceful as ever.People felt upset when they heard that a lot of Solvers died, but no one felt any remorse. After all, Solver was a profession where death looms in every step the Solvers take.However, Oliver felt the People\u2019s reaction was fascinating.Even though the City officials and the Paladins made quite a fuss about the appearance of Puppet, the majority of people didn\u2019t know either what happened or the existence of Puppet.It was like they were living in another world, despite sharing the same time zone and same space.Tring Tring.Oliver opened the door to Restaurant Forrest and went inside.Even though not much time had passed, he felt like he was visiting after a long time.\u201cWelcome. Dave. Thank you for visiting.\u201dAs usual, Al came and greeted him.He was normally kind and courteous, but today it seemed like the kindness went up by one notch.\u201cYes, hello. Mr. Al\u2026What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cNothing. Did you come to see the boss?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m here to report that I\u2019ve finished the work in the contaminated zone.\u201dIn fact, Oliver could have done it with the communication device he received, but since he had something to ask Forrest, he came directly to the Restaurant.Oliver felt like these kinds of things should be done face to face.\u201cOkay. If you don\u2019t mind, could you please wait for a while? Boss is working right now. It\u2019ll just take a minute.\u201dAl asked so carefully that Oliver wondered whether he was being polite or nervous.Even though he didn\u2019t understand the reason, Oliver just nodded his head without asking the reason\u201cYes, I understand. He must be busy.\u201d\u201cThank you for your understanding. Then I will guide you to a place to wait.\u201dOliver nodded his head and followed Al.Al led him to a table in the restaurant, and when Oliver looked around, two-thirds of the restaurant was already filled with people.Among them, there were people who were well-dressed in suits and at the same time, there were also those who appeared to be solvers.It felt strange and convincing at the same time.\u201cAre you okay with coffee?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAl brought a cup of coffee within a few minutes as soon as Oliver answered.Oliver tried to give him the coffee price and tip, but Al politely declined.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cUm? But\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s presumptuous to say, but I\u2019ve heard of what happened in the contaminated zone. Please, it\u2019s on the house.\u201dAl\u2019s words were sincere.Oliver nodded his head and drank the coffee, and when he was halfway through, Al came back and said:\u201cBoss says you can come in now.\u201dOliver descended deep underground where Forrest\u2019s real office was.Now he was used to the place, and when he arrived at the office, Forrest could be seen busy talking with someone through a large communication device the size of a human head.However, after a while, when Oliver showed up, he quickly ended the call and greeted Oliver.\u201cHey, Dave. Come on in.\u201d\u201cHello, Mr. Forrest.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 Is everything fine?\u201d\u201cPardon? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cI heard the story. Didn\u2019t you fight with Puppet? Are there any problems with your body?\u2026 Oh, excuse me, I called a guest and kept you standing. First, take a seat.\u201dOliver sat down, pounding on the floor with his quarterstaff.As usual, Forrest offered him a glass of booze, and as Oliver took it, he looked around.There was definitely a change.He didn\u2019t put that much energy into his eyes, but he could see the emotions beyond the building as well as on the ground, and in the case of Forrest in front of him, the emotions were much more detailed than before.He was full of admiration and pride for the present Oliver.It must have been because he had survived after fighting with Puppet, but at the same time, he harbored a slight sense of guilt.He himself denied that feeling, but he couldn\u2019t shake it off easily.Seeing that, Oliver spoke.\u201c\u2026 .There\u2019s no problem with my body, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it. I couldn\u2019t come yesterday because I was tired.\u201dAfter his battle with Puppet, Oliver couldn\u2019t get an ouch of rest and was interrogated for hours.As a result, he was so tired and went straight to the inn and fell asleep.\u201cI understand. You must have been very tired.\u201d\u201cYes. When the Paladins showed up, I thought something big was going to happen, but they released me more easily than I thought.\u201d\u201cOf course, they should. No matter how great a Paladin is, they are ultimately tied to the Church. The pact between the Church and Landa cannot be unilaterally ignored. As long as there is a Brokers guild, you cannot be dragged away without any evidence.\u201d\u201cI see. That\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cBut don\u2019t let your guard down. Even without evidence, if the number of cases against you piles up, they can take you as they please.\u201dOliver nodded his head thinking about the Paladin named Elton, who actually wanted Oliver to make a mistake.Thinking about that, Oliver asked Forrest.\u201cCan I ask you a question, Mr. Forrest?\u201d\u201cYes, anything.\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, Paladins are people who protect the human world, and they have very strong powers. Then why can\u2019t they take a Solver like me as they please?\u201cAs I said before, it\u2019s because of the agreement between Landa and the Church. Landa, even though it has a small number of people who believe in the Parter religion, makes a huge donation to the Church every year.\u201dOliver asked back with surprise.\u201cIs it because of money?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s because of money. This is what happens when there is a clash between sacred and profane. It\u2019s not too bad. Thanks to that, the Church gets a good operating cost, and Landa can enjoy safety and freedom at the same time. That\u2019s how the adult world works.\u201dOliver only understood half of what Forrest said, but he nodded his head, not wanting to say anything.After taking a short breath, Forrest opened his mouth once again.\u201cIs that all you want to ask about?\u201d\u201cNo, there is one more.\u201d\u201cSay it. I have something to tell you too. I\u2019ll tell you after answering your question first.\u201dOliver nodded his head.\u201cCan you tell me how a wanted criminal like Puppet entered the contaminated zone? No one answered when I asked.\u201dForrest hesitated as he took a sip of the drink, but soon answered.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you. You deserve to ask\u2026 The story is complicated and I\u2019m not sure, but our sources suggest that a high-ranking city official working for the Landa Department of the Interior was bought by Puppet.\u201d\u201cBought?\u201d\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know whether he knew he was dealing with Puppet, but I heard that the official who got bought by Puppet owed a lot of money to gambling recently. At that time, I\u2019m guessing he got bribed. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s under investigation. It\u2019s pretty funny, right?\u201dOliver agreed. It was indeed pretty funny, and as proof, a small smile even formed on Oliver\u2019s face.It was not certain, but Oliver heard that the number of people involved in the cleaning was between two hundred to three hundred, including the solvers and mercenaries.However, only a hundred of them survived, and it was really interesting that the starting point of all this was the gambling debt of a city official.It was so absurd that it made Oliver laugh.It was so out of the ordinary and irrational that he even wanted to study it.\u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous, too. But, this is Landa\u2019s daily life.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, Landa\u2026 No, most of the world is run by a herd of fools. And, regarding this cleaning, the Brokers Guild will fight the city for a while over this. Of course, in the form of negotiation, not a fist fight.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of negotiation?\u201d\u201cThe compensation for the deceased solvers\u2019 families and the cost of damages for the brokers who lost a lot of manpower. We\u2019re going to revise some of the rules we made with each other. The city and the Brokers guild are in an agreement, and we still need each other\u2026 Every time an incident arises, we grab each other\u2019s collars and try to take an advantageous position. The city was at fault this time, so if it\u2019s not excessive, they will accept our demands to some extent.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\u201cAside from that, there will be strife within the Brokers guild as well. Most of the Brokers who participated in this cleaning suffered great damage. They will fight each other for territory.\u201d\u201cIs it a big deal?\u201d\u201cFor some, they may lose their competitive edge and have to retire.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that same for Mr. Forrest?\u201dOliver said sadly, but Forrest\u2019s expression shone brightly as if he had been waiting for this question.\u201cNo, I am the opposite.\u201d\u201cOpposite?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t lose that much manpower. Most of the Solvers from District T worked with Arthur.\u201dOliver recalled the solvers he saw at Arthur\u2019s party.\u201cAbove all, didn\u2019t you come back alive?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYes, you. Of the solvers I manage, you are the best solver. You avoided a lot of damage just by coming back safely. In addition to that, rumors of surviving after fighting Puppet are spreading, so it is rather a plus on my side.\u201d\u201cPlus?\u201d\u201cYeah, just because you survived after fighting puppet, a lot of big shots are starting to show interest in you\u2026 Even if this field is all about skill, you need an event that stands out, that\u2019s why everyone tries to avoid doing jobs like cleaning, but ironically, because of the cleaning your name has become quite well known.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 It sounds like a good thing, but I don\u2019t understand. I didn\u2019t win, I lost, and I barely survived?\u201d\u201cSurprisingly, people aren\u2019t interested in such details. You survived after facing Puppet. Only this fact matters\u2026 In fact, right now, you have received many nominated commission requests.\u201d\u201cNominated commission request?\u201d\u201cYeah, what you\u2019ve done so far is a general commission. A general commission that distributes work and remuneration to brokers at random. However, a Nominated Commission is a little different from that.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s different?\u201d\u201cThe customer appoints you and commissions you. They choose a competent solver themselves because they judge their work as important and difficult. The work will be difficult, risky, and demanding, but the pay is basically high. On average, from 10 million to Sometimes even billions.\u201d\u201c\u2026I think I\u2019ve already worked for 10 million.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019ve done a lot of difficult things\u2026 You\u2019re very special. Sometimes you\u2019re sharp as if I can\u2019t understand what you\u2019re thinking, but most of the time you\u2019re too easygoing.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like that kind of attitude, but be careful. There will be people who want to take advantage of you. Maybe I might too.\u201d\u201cYou are kind.\u201dForrest laughed.\u201cSpeaking like that builds trust in me. Still, be careful, because all shrewd people are like this.\u201d\u201cYes, I will keep that in mind. Thanks again for the kind advice.\u201d\u201c\u2026. In any case, the Nominated commission request is highly paid. In some cases, you may be able to negotiate the pay. You can simply increase the amount, or you can ask for something else.\u201d\u201cWhat specifically can I ask for?\u201d\u201cUseful items, information, drugs, etc. Of course, they don\u2019t do everything you ask for, but sometimes they do. For example, they might find out about the black market and get some black magic books.\u201d\u201cA black magic book?\u201d\u201cYeah. Surprisingly, there are quite a few people who collect black magic books from among the wealthy.\u201dGetting more Money was interesting, but the second condition seemed even more interesting for Oliver.Oliver felt like the clients he could meet through the Nominated commission would be better than meeting some random clients.\u201cUm\u2026 it seems a lot beneficial.\u201d\u201cBut it also increases the risk.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s about the work, didn\u2019t you already say it\u2019ll be difficult?\u201d\u201cNo, It\u2019s not just about that. The requests in those cases are highly likely to be important to the client, and there will be a lot of politics involved in it. There are intermediaries like me who prepare for this kind of thing, but to be honest, we can\u2019t protect you from everything.\u201dAt a glance, it may seem irresponsible, but in reality, it was not.If Oliver learned something from the contaminated zone incident, it was that the world was more based on lies than he thought.When a lie is exposed or the case becomes bigger, they hastily try to organize it, but they don\u2019t seem to have any intention of getting rid of the lie itself.It seemed like it was relatively easier to erase something than get things sorted out.And it was no different from a Broker or a Solver, they also seem to be doing it to make a living.The reality was that even if an incident that ridicules professional ethics occurs, it can be subdued if it was perceived with power and profit beyond that.On the contrary, Forrest\u2019s attitude to accurately point out the disadvantages was remarkable.At least Oliver thought so.\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Kent warned me about this a little bit. I hope it doesn\u2019t happen, and it\u2019s my job to be careful.\u201d\u201c\u2026. If it\u2019s a direct request, the person you meet will be even more dangerous. They may not be high-risk criminals like Puppet, but there are still a lot of strong people here.\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s fine.\u201dHearing Oliver\u2019s answer, Forrest put on a troubled expression on his face.\u201cIt\u2019s the attitude I expected, but I feel a bit drained after hearing the answer. So, do you like to hear about the Nominated commission requests you received?\u201dOliver refused.\u201cNo. I will excuse myself for today.\u201d\u201cHmm? That\u2019s surprising. I didn\u2019t mean to rush it, but I thought you\u2019d ask me to show it to you right away.\u201d\u201cYes, I would have asked if I didn\u2019t have an appointment, but I have one right now. I\u2019ve to meet someone.\u201d\u201cMeet? That\u2019s strange. If you don\u2019t mind, can I ask who it is?\u201dOliver stood up and said.\u201cSomeone who gave me a good advice.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 93": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 93Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTak Tak TakOliver walked for a long time to visit District P.District P was a factory zone and just like the worker residence of District T, it seemed relatively safe compared to other worker residence Districts because it was close to the middle and upper-class residential Districts.However, that was true only for the central part of the district.When Oliver went to a small church located on the outskirts, the whole area was very lonely.It was like an abandoned place where only beggars could be seen occasionally.Oliver handed the beggars one or two shillings and looked around.Fortunately, there was nothing suspicious.Oliver was excited.It was because he will soon be able to talk to Joanna.Oliver entered the entrance to the church where an old cross had been erected.The rectangular shape of the interior of the cathedral was filled with uncomfortable long chairs.Oliver wondered if it was because of this that no one was inside the church.Of course, he didn\u2019t care about it.Oliver took some bills from his arms, put them on the offering plate, and went inside.Then he sat down behind a woman with long blonde hair, sitting alone in the cathedral.Following her, Oliver also interlocked his hands, brought them close to his chest, and said quietly.\u201c\u2026. Ms. Paladin?\u201d\u201cShhh. Wait a minute.\u201dOliver remained silent as instructed.As he remained silent, he listened to Joanna\u2019s prayer.\u201c\u2026.Holy father. Grant us strength, courage, and wisdom when we are weak, and watch over us as we fulfill the glorious mission you have given us. So please make me a proud child of yours. Father\u2019s children pray\u2026 . Mallelujah.\u201dAfter the prayer, a solemn silence enveloped the surroundings. After a while, Joanna slowly opened her mouth.She had a calmer voice than what Oliver heard before.\u201c\u2026 Is that Oliver?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThank you for coming.\u201d\u201cThank you for calling me. I learned how honorable it was to have a conversation with a Paladin. I sincerely thank you\u2026 And, can I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow did you know that it was me? As you can see, my face has changed, hasn\u2019t it?\u201dOliver asked, stroking his face covered in the leather mask.Oliver wondered whether there was something that only paladins could recognize.Joanna maintained her characteristic silence and opened her mouth after a while.\u201c\u2026. I just found out.\u201d\u201c.\u2026Pardon?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the only one with that kind of attitude and tone of voice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dOliver was shocked and went silent.He did his best to be a normal, common-sense person in his own way and felt that all of his efforts were denied.\u201cUm\u2026 I should try harder?\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cUm? Oh, I tried to look like a normal person, but I guess I didn\u2019t put in enough effort.\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking\u2026 what are you doing here.\u201d\u201cUm? Of course, because Ms. Paladin called me here\u2026 Oh, you were asking why I\u2019m working as a Solver?\u201dJoanna, who had been staring as if she was at the limits of her patience, shook her head and answered.\u201cYes, yes. Why are you working as a solver? You\u2026 were the head of a warlock family, right?\u201dThere was no hostility in her emotions.Rather, it was filled with confusion, doubt, and hope. The reason for these emotions was unknown, though.Oliver answered looking at Joanna, who was rubbing between her eyes as if tired.\u201cI was just following Ms. Paladin\u2019s advice.\u201d\u201cAdvice?\u201d\u201cYes, didn\u2019t you say to go out and hang out with people? That\u2019s why\u2026.. Of course, that\u2019s not all, but it was a pretty big reason. Thank you. I wanted to say this all this time, and I finally could.\u201dJoanna gave a puzzled look as if she couldn\u2019t believe it.It was a look Oliver had seen a lot. A look that meant that she couldn\u2019t understand what he was talking about.Oliver wondered why all the people he talked to had that kind of expression once in a while.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was an awkward silence for a while, and it was Oliver who broke that silence.She was the person he wanted to meet, so he felt bad to spend the time in silence.\u201cHow were you?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. I heard from the pharmacist that you returned safely, but I was a little worried. How are you?\u201dHearing Oliver\u2019s question, Joanna\u2019s pure white face turned slightly red.Oliver could see the emotions shy, shame, and guilt rising within her, and somehow she seemed to feel shame and guilt about her work at that time.\u201c\u2026. Did I say something wrong?\u201dAfter a short silence, Joanna answered.\u201c\u2026Regrettably, I\u2019m doing good.\u201d\u201cUm?\u201d\u201cYeah, I failed my mission and I couldn\u2019t even eradicate the evil drug, but I got rewarded for successfully completing my mission and was officially assigned to this place.\u201dHer words were sincere.\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you tell the truth?\u201dOliver asked without thinking due to curiosity, and Joanna flinched hearing it.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 A lot of people who helped me told me to keep quiet. They said that it would be better for the world and for everyone so that they can devote themselves to the holy mission.\u201d\u2018Um..\u2026.\u2019Oliver admired the pharmacist.Everything went as he said. It seemed like he was right when he said that Joanna\u2019s failure would not go unnoticed due to the complex interests of the people within the Parter Church and that it would make Weinham safer.He was a really clever man.\u201c\u2026But Ms. Paladin still doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201dJoanna answered with silence.Her emotions were churning, and it didn\u2019t seem like she accepted it simply because of the recommendation from those around her. There seemed to be another reason for her to make this choice \u2013 Something very precious was involved.Just when Oliver was about to ask again, Joanna opened her mouth half a beat faster than him.\u201cThen it\u2019s my turn now.\u201d\u201cUm?\u201d\u201cWhat has happened since you left your Warlock family?\u201dOliver stared blankly at Joanna at the unexpected question.He wondered whether he could tell her.It was Joanna who gave him the advice in the first place, so it felt she deserved the answer.Above all else, there was no malice in her emotions.\u201cUm, I don\u2019t mind answering, but the story could be a bit long.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we still have plenty of time.\u201dOliver nodded his head and then started his story.He told the story of leaving the Joseph family secretly, visiting District X, and meeting Kent.The story about Kent\u2019s actions and the beggars who followed him was detailed, but not overly exaggerated.Seeing Joanna, Oliver thought she might tell what she felt, something he couldn\u2019t explain, but contrary to his expectations, Joanna just nodded her head and didn\u2019t say anything.Afterward, Oliver told the story of leaving Kent and becoming a solver.He told the story of a veteran soldier and a brave boy who asked him to teach him to write while omitting the contents that would hurt others, and Oliver suddenly realized that he had met a lot of people.It was hard to describe, but it was pretty satisfying.Joanna said while looking at the expression on Oliver\u2019s face.\u201c\u2026. You seem to be having fun.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026.. Yes, it\u2019s fun. The world\u2026 It\u2019s a pretty fun place.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m glad\u2026.. But is there any special reason why you became a solver?\u201d\u201cUm, I got an offer, and it\u2019s the best thing I can do to make money, right?\u201dOliver answered vaguely since didn\u2019t want to tell a Paladin about wanting to buy books on black magic and demons.\u201c\u2026.So you make money by swinging her fists?\u201d\u201cYes, no matter how hard I work at a restaurant, they say it\u2019s hard to buy a book\u2026 Um, wouldn\u2019t it be okay to choose a job that doesn\u2019t harm the general public? There are also Solvers who clean the contaminated zone, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad job .\u201dJoanna remained silent again, as she had nothing to say.She looked at Oliver with a very complex expression.\u201cI have a question for you.\u201d\u201cYes, tell me.\u201d\u201cDid you really have nothing to do with Puppet?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 what are you talking about?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve heard that warlocks will follow someone stronger than themselves as their master.\u201dOliver recalled what had happened to him at the Joseph family in the past.\u201cUm, I guess so.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you save your life in exchange for being Puppet\u2019s slave?\u201d\u201cUm, no\u2026 But I\u2019m curious, so, what if that happened?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t let you roam freely.\u201dJoanna spoke firmly with intense eyes. Her words were sincere.\u201cUm, is that so?\u201d\u201cYes, Puppet\u2026 he\u2019s a heinous criminal who has lived hundreds of years and committed numerous crimes. Above all, he has trained many warlocks and created numerous criminal organizations to cause chaos around the world. He is also an executive of an evil organization, which is absolutely unacceptable.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Is Black Hand also trying to destroy the human world?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 why are you asking that?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u2026 I just knew that Black Hand was made up of a group of criminal warlocks and a large organization, but I didn\u2019t know that they were trying to destroy the human world.\u201d\u201cAccording to the church\u2019s investigation, yes.\u2026\u2026 They periodically try to summon Demons into this world. \u201d\u201cDo you know about the Black Hand?\u201d\u201cTo some extent.\u201d\u201cCan you tell me what kind of organization it is?\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just curious. As I said before, I had a chance to join. The conditions for entry were not to my interest so I refused, but I\u2019m curious about what kind of place it is.\u201dJoanna looked at Oliver again.Deep doubts and faint belief \u2013 a mixture of two conflicting emotions could be seen swirling like a bizarre.Oliver felt this was the good thing about emotions \u2013 Anomalous, conflicting, and contradictory. So it was beautiful and fun.\u201cBlackhand is a loose coalition of powerful warlocks.\u201dOliver pricked up his ears.It was a group with very little information that even Kent couldn\u2019t tell him the details about, but he heard valuable information from a completely unexpected place.\u201cAccording to the investigation conducted by the Church, it is not an organization led by a single head, but an organization that is actually led by many executives, called Fingers.\u201d\u201cFingers?\u201d\u201cYeah, it refers to the Black Hand executives, like Puppet.\u201dOliver suddenly had a basic question.\u201cWhy? Why is Black Hand called Black Hand?\u201dIn fact, it wasn\u2019t a question he was expecting an answer to, but to his surprise, Joanna answered it.\u201cBlackhand means death. And like a shadow, they\u2019re everywhere.\u201d\u2018Hand of death\u2026..\u2019\u201cEverywhere?\u201d\u201c\u2026Sadly, that\u2019s the truth. Puppet and many other fingers stretch like a spider\u2019s web all over the world. They even have connections with corrupt high-ranking people in each country. We monitor and investigate them.\u201dOliver heard some interesting information. From what Kent said, he expected it to be a fairly dangerous and powerful organization, but Joanna\u2019s explanation seemed to be more concrete.And suddenly, he felt regret.He thought it would have been great if he had just accepted Puppeteer Glyph\u2019s offer.Maybe he could have met Puppet, not as an enemy, and would have had a proper conversation.But again, it was not possible when he thought about the conditions.Maybe he would have accepted the conditions if he hadn\u2019t met Kent.He felt a bit complicated.As Oliver daydreamed and fell into his own world, a small beep sound was heard.When he looked ahead, Joanna was looking at a machine, which seemed like some kind of communication device.Joanna checked the machine, pressed the button to turn it off, and got up.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve to go\u2026 Something came up.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s unfortunate. There were a lot of things I wanted to ask.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2026 I\u2019ll see you from time to time to check on you.\u201dThe tone was mixed with a warning, but Oliver was happy.Since it meant that he could meet her again and have a conversation.\u201cI\u2019m glad. Thank you very much.\u201d\u201cGlad?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be able to see the beautiful you.\u201dJoanna flinched at Oliver\u2019s words, and her face got flushed in anger.\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t say anything strange.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I was being serious? That beautiful light\u2026 . It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJoanna frowned and looked for something in her arms.Oliver looked at her unconcernedly, and after a while, she pulled out a little booklet of hers.\u201cThis..\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a scripture of\u00a0 Parter church. You seem to like books, so please read it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 94": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOliver received an unexpected gift from Joanna.He liked books, and he wanted to know the meaning behind the emotions of expectations and hopes with which she gave him the book as a gift, and he also wanted to know what she intended to do by giving it to him.Oliver decided to ask Joanna about that after reading this gift, hence he decided to read the Pater scripture that Joanna gave him as a gift.Oliver read the book when he was not dining, when he was not teaching Rosbane math and letters, when he was not reading the book about the Corpse dolls, when he was not learning the code language, and when he was not doing personal black magic experiments.As a result, it took a pretty long time to finish the book and when he finally finished it, he found the book quite bizarre.The book was a composition of texts that includes instructions, stories, poetry, and prophecies, but a major part of the book was an interpretation of them to provide guidelines on how people should live.The problem was that this was pretty vague to Oliver.It wasn\u2019t that the stories and instructions were bad, the problem he had was with the interpretations which could be interpreted differently from person to person, but the Pater Church came up with arbitrary interpretations and insisted that those were right.Books are about gaining knowledge and expanding the scope of thinking, and in that sense, this Pater scripture did not function as a book.In addition, contradictory, incoherent, and self-denial actions were rampant, which consumed more time and effort to understand the book.Still, since it was a gift from Joanna, Oliver took a break for a while from what he was doing and read the scriptures.In the meantime, there was no word from Forrest, who said he would call Oliver once he found a perfect job for him.Time went by slowly without much change in Oliver\u2019s life, and one day he heard surprising news from Forrest \u2013 the city decided to provide compensation for the people involved in this year\u2019s cleaning.It was said that the Brokers guild obtained it after persistent negotiations with the city officials.Originally, compensation would have been given only to the deceased, and that too would have been given in batches, but the city administration made a concession this time since the nucleus of the problem was the poor handling of things by the city officials and also because of the damage caused to the brokers, which was larger than expected.It was also said that the solvers who participated voluntarily will receive three times the amount of compensation written in the contract, while in the case of the solvers who were designated by the city and forced to participate, it was said that they would be paid differently according to the tasks they have accomplished.The negotiation worked out in the favor of not only the dead but also Oliver.\u201cHere\u2019s your 30 million.\u201dOliver looked at the 300 bills consisting of 100,000 Landa notes.\u201c\u2026do they normally give this much?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely not. It is true that Landa has a large budget, but they never waste a penny of that money. Rather, they might try to squeeze it out from the citizens if they had a chance. The worst evil business in Landa is the city itself.\u201dThere was no filter in Forrest\u2019s words.\u201c\u2026 But this\u2026 it\u2019s both an advantage and a disadvantage. Under the guise of compensation, this is a pretty big investment on the city side.\u2019\u2019\u201cInvestment?\u201d\u201cYes, investment. For example, the compensation you receive right now is much larger than what the other solvers receive.\u201d\u201cUm?\u201d\u201cYeah. This compensation is kind of a gesture in wanting to keep a good relationship with you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m honored, but why does it sound a little burdensome?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s not a very good thing. It means that if they get a chance they will make you work your ass off. Of course, there is a way to take this opportunity to go under some big names and go higher, but you don\u2019t like it, right?\u201dIt was true. Oliver\u2019s goal was to establish ties with influential people, but not to go under them.It was his belief that once he goes under someone or an organization, he may have to prioritize their work, and may end up doing things he doesn\u2019t want to do.\u201cUm\u2026 Just in case, is there a way to refuse it?\u201d\u201cAre you going to refuse the compensation?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s a little burdensome. I don\u2019t have a lot of money right now, but I do have some money.\u201dForrest pushed the bundle of money toward Oliver.\u201cNo, just take it. The city administration doesn\u2019t like it when people refuse their favor, irrespective of their intention.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Isn\u2019t that a bit unfair?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s unfair. That\u2019s Landa for you. What did you learn after staying in this city all this time?\u201dWith no way out, Oliver eventually took the money as per Forrest\u2019s recommendation. He thought that if things went out of hand, maybe he should abandon this identity.\u2018\u2026I should use it as a last resort. There\u2019s so much I\u2019ve built up so far.\u2019Oliver thought about the path he walked as a solver, the people he met as Dave \u2013 Forrest, Murphy, the old man at the bookstore, and Joanna.As Glutton bag sweetly swallowed the money, Forrest took a few files and placed them in front of Oliver.\u201cAre you done with resting?\u201dOliver answered, checking the files.\u201cNo, not yet.\u201dThe file consisted of Nominated commission requests for Oliver.As Forrest said, the conditions were generous, and the commission price ranged from 5 million to up to 100 million.And the type of work was also varied. There was a request to destroy a glass factory in District U, a request to terrorize a smuggling market in District V, and a request to kill an unaffiliated gang in District X.\u201cHow come things are more aggressive than the ones I did before?\u201d\u201cAs the money grows, they start making outspoken demands. But that\u2019s not all there is to it.\u201dIndeed, as Forrest said, in addition to sabotage and assassination jobs, there were also jobs to guard things and objects, the most notable of which was to protect an auction house and auction items in District L.The auction items included the mummy of a king brought from one of the colonies of the Great Empire, a golden crown, and a throne. Although Oliver found it interesting, the job was not appealing to him.No, rather than not appealing, Oliver wasn\u2019t in the mood to go to work right away.Money was good, but still, it was just a tool for Oliver \u2013 a tool to get what he wanted.Rather than working, right now, Oliver wanted to repair and remodel the Corpse dolls that he took from the contaminated zone as soon as possible.Oliver wasn\u2019t trying to repair the Corpse dolls just to satisfy his curiosity, he was also thinking that hopefully, he could make a decent tool that could also be used in his work as a Solver, but the problem was, it was not as easy as it sounds.In order to experiment, a safe space separated from the outside world was essential. However, it was not possible to procure something like that\u00a0 immediately due to Oliver\u2019s situation.\u2018Um..\u2026. It\u2019s a pity, maybe I should postpone the experiment and start working to save money. It would cost more than just a penny or two to buy a warehouse. Or should I ask him to negotiate for a warehouse?\u2019As Oliver slowly devised a plan to buy a warehouse, a person\u2019s face flashed in his head.It was the face of Murphy Kimbell. In order to buy a warehouse, Oliver needed an ID along with money, and Murphy had offered to provide Oliver with an ID in the past.\u201cMr. Forrest.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHave you been contacted by Mr. Murphy by any chance?\u201dHearing Oliver\u2019s question, Forrest\u2019s eyes widened slightly.\u201cHow? How did you know? Murphy called me this morning, and said that he has something to tell you.\u201dForrest\u2019s emotions were filled with awe, and when Oliver asked about the reason for Murphy contacting him, Forrest answered.\u201cHe said he prepared the reward he mentioned last time. He asked you to stop by his pub when it\u2019s convenient.\u201dIt was a starry night, and Oliver was walking in a street adjacent to the factory area in District T.The street was crowded with people who varied from workers to residents, and most of them entered the street taverns or mysterious shops with red roofs.Occasionally there were screams of women, swearing, and even fighting.It was a kind of place Oliver had never seen before.It was as if the whole street was full of emotions, so full that Oliver felt that he could extract emotions without causing any damage to the subject.\u2018Maybe if I hide the extraction process, I might easily secure emotions. Then, maybe I can save some money.\u2019It didn\u2019t seem like a bad idea, and Oliver thought it was worth giving it a try. However, he put this thought aside for a moment and went to the meeting place.Through Forrest, Murphy informed Oliver that he had made the ID he asked for, and he asked Oliver to come to his pub and pick it up.Murphy politely apologized for not being able to come by himself due to the busy business, and Oliver accepted the apology without any complaints since he was giving him a nice gift.And to be honest, Oliver was also curious about the pub Kimbell was running.\u201cIs it here?\u201dOliver said as he looked down the stairs between the red brick buildings.It wasn\u2019t very deep, but there was a small door at the end of the stairs, and quite a few people kept going in.According to Forrest, this was a secret pub run by the Kimbell family, but from the appearance, it didn\u2019t really seem that secret.-If you give the local police some money, everything becomes a secret.Forrest\u2019s words came to Oliver\u2019s mind.Oliver looked at the pub for a moment and then entered along with the crowd.TAT TAT.Oliver descended the stairs and entered the pub in the basement.Contrary to the exterior, the pub had a rather ornate interior.Of course, it wasn\u2019t a luxury hotel like the Blue Moon that Joseph liked, but it was the most glamorous of the shops in District T.Although it was a brick wall, it was dust-free, the tables and chairs were properly furnished, and behind the counter where people ordered drinks, there were a lot of colorful liquors.Among them, the liquors that glowed with various fluorescent lights had mana in it, though only a minuscule amount.\u201cGive me a glass of Palm Escher.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d\u201cGive me a Ibe Beji. A whole bottle.\u201d\u201cSorry, sir. We don\u2019t sell it that way.\u201d\u201cDamn\u2026! Then give me a peg first!\u201d\u201cGive me five Shuk Pieks. I\u2019m going to have it here with my friends.\u201dSkillful bartenders poured magic wine into glasses according to the orders of the flocking customers.They gladly handed the bills and drank alcohol, and they all looked very happy.\u201cInteresting.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting?\u201dOliver turned his head in the direction of the voice, and at the place where his eyes met, stood Murphy with his head turned to one side.A neat suit, a gold watch on the wrist, and shiny shoes.He looked much richer than before.Looking at the changed Murphy, Oliver answered.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the bottle has a label. Technically, it\u2019s a processed magic potion, but why does it have a label?\u201d\u201cI ordered it. The product is important, but so is the packaging. It\u2019s like a woman putting on makeup. It elevates the quality to the next level.\u201dMurphy said with conviction.It was certainly persuasive, and Oliver seemed to understand why Forrest was keeping an eye on him.\u201cAmazing.\u201d\u201cThanks for the compliment. I want to sell a product, not some booze\u2026 By the way, thank you for coming here. I\u2019m sorry for calling you\u2026 and it must have been really difficult after all those contaminated zone stuff. \u201dOliver knew that rumors would travel very fast in Landa, but never thought it would be this fast.\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine. Can I get it now?\u201d\u201cI have the ID in the office room, could you please follow me for a sec? I also wanted to share a few stories with you\u2026 please.\u201dFor some reason, Murphy seemed more cautious than before.There seemed to be some hidden intention, but it didn\u2019t seem malicious. So Oliver agreed and followed him to the office inside the Kimbell family\u2019s pub.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe office inside the pub wasn\u2019t that big.It was about the same size as the office at Forrest Restaurant, but it felt more cramped because the office inside was not organized.With just two people the room felt full, and if there was one more person, it felt like it would be hard to breathe.As Oliver looked around the room, Murphy spoke while organizing the messy papers on the desk.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been busy lately, so it\u2019s kind of messy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201dOliver said, recalling the bustling pub. It was packed, and many drank the magic wine while spending a lot of money on a single drink.\u201cThere you go.\u201dMurphy pulled a brown paper bag from the drawer and handed it to Oliver.Oliver opened the paper bag and checked the contents.On the inside, there was Oliver\u2019s fake birth certificate and an ID in the form of a notebook.Oliver opened the ID, and there he saw the name \u201cDave Wright\u201d along with a face that subtly resembled Oliver\u2019s face right now.In addition, there was personal information such as his place of birth and his date of birth.\u201cIs this\u2026?\u201d\u201cThis is your new ID. Do you like it?\u201dOliver checked his ID and birth certificate.\u201cYes. I like it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it. It\u2019s worth preparing a first-grade ID.\u201d\u201cFirst-grade?\u201d\u201cAh, I guess you don\u2019t know. Fake IDs are also classified. There are various types, but they are usually divided into three classes.\u201dOliver showed interest. He was able to get a glimpse of people\u2019s wisdom from these trivial stories.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, can you tell me how it\u2019s divided?\u201d\u201cOf course. There\u2019s nothing to lose. Do you like alcohol?\u201d\u201cI only know how to take a sip.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dWith those words, Murphy took a magic wine that was on one side of the office and poured it into a glass.It had a green fluorescent color, and unlike what was sold at the bar, the concentration of mana was quite strong.Murphy murmured while extending the glass toward Oliver.\u201cFake IDs are divided into three main categories: Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3\u2026 Grade 3 is a toy that only imitates the appearance of an ID, and is garbage that even the police can see through if they look closely. Grade 2 is something obtained by bribing the city officials. Using those IDs won\u2019t be a problem and it will be helpful in your everyday life, but if you get investigated, there is a high chance of getting caught.\u201dOliver nodded his head as he heard the delineation.\u201cGrade 1 is a bit different. It\u2019s not artificially created, it\u2019s more of bringing an original identity.\u201d\u201cOriginal identity?\u201d\u201cYes, there are quite a few people who waste their lives even among those who are born with proper identities. Most of them go into debt that they can\u2019t afford, and the Crime Firm confiscates their identity instead of their debt.\u201dOliver looked at his ID.\u201cThen, does this ID have a separate owner?\u201d\u201cYes. So unless they meet and check every single person in Landa, there is no fear of being caught. The person who owned the ID is definitely a real person. It\u2019s like living a different person\u2019s life.\u201dOliver saw the face on his ID.\u201cAmazing. Does he have a face similar to mine?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because they did plastic surgery with magic. With a reasonable excuse and bribe, you can get a reissued ID anytime. Taking this opportunity, they change the name along with the face to match the customer\u2019s convenience.\u201d\u201cho\u2026\u201dOliver responded like a kid listening to a folk tale.\u201cAlthough the method is simple, First-grade IDs are a little expensive because of the cost of plastic surgery, bribery, and the clean up after finding someone who meets the right conditions.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard about it from Mr. Forrest. He said it would cost hundreds of millions to make one. Thank you for doing this.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that great compared to what Mr. Warlock did. I benefited a lot from what happened last time\u2026 How did the wine taste?\u201d\u201cUm, I didn\u2019t drink it yet. Wait a minute.\u201dOliver answered and took a sip of the green fluorescent Magic wine.It was quite edible.\u201c\u2026.It\u2019s delicious.\u201dSeeing Oliver\u2019s reaction, which was not what he was expecting, Murphy felt a little disappointed.\u201cOh, I\u2019m glad to hear that. Do you like it?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s delicious.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. I\u2019m glad. It\u2019s made especially for the rich.\u201d\u201cThe rich?\u201d\u201cYes, as I said earlier, my goal was not to make booze but to make a high-quality Magic wine. That\u2019s why even though it cost more, I put labels on the bottles to package them and give them a plausible name. Having a label and name gives a class to the product.\u201dAfter taking a sip of the Magic wine, Murphy opened his mouth again.\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to maximize our profits by making the quality different for customers of various sections. This is a luxury item that\u2019s only sold to politicians, wizards, and capitalists in the city. Its name is Gut Oggau.\u201d\u201c\u2026What does that mean?\u201d\u201cIt means a drop of water from God in Gallo language.\u201d\u201cGallo?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a continental country under the Great Empire. I\u2019ve fought a lot during the war with that side. They can\u2019t fight, but they\u2019re good at making food and alcohol.\u201d\u201cIs there a reason why you named the product in that language?\u201d\u201cYeah, doesn\u2019t it look cool? Most people like it when the product\u2019s name is in a foreign language they don\u2019t even know about.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dOliver nodded.There was some truth in Murphy\u2019s words, and Oliver felt the trivia quite interesting.Oliver drank the magic wine once again.Compared to the alcohol that Forrest gave, it was definitely addictive \u2013 like something inside the drink that made him want to keep drinking.At that time, Oliver suddenly thought that it would taste better if the alcohol was processed using emotions like Pilgaret.\u2018No, it will be a waste. It would take a huge amount of emotion just to make the liquor sold at the pub.\u2019\u201cI have a question, can I ask you, Mr. Murphy.\u201d\u201cYes, speak comfortably, Mr. Warlock.\u201d\u201cYou told me last time that the Crime Firm also runs a real estate company, so, how long does it take to buy a warehouse or something like that? I don\u2019t have money to buy it, so I want to know whether I can just rent it.\u201dSince he had an ID, Oliver thought maybe it wouldn\u2019t be bad to prepare one by one.He knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to get one right away, but he thought it wouldn\u2019t be bad to find out the price.Hearing Oliver\u2019s words, Murphy smiled.\u201cWhat a great coincidence.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cI was going to tell you about that, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cMr. Warlock, what if you could have a warehouse? A warehouse that is free from external surveillance and eyes. I just got one at a bargain price.\u201d\u201c\u2026Um.\u201d\u201cWell, I guess one glass isn\u2019t enough for the conversation, how \u2018bout another one?\u201dOf course, quite naturally, Murphy wasn\u2019t planning on giving the warehouse to Oliver for free.There was a corresponding request.\u201cTruck problem?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDoes Mr. Murphy run a truck business?\u201d\u201cNo, not me. The family that\u2019s above our family is running it, the Hoffman family. They do a lot of business, but their main focus is transportation.\u201d\u201cTransportation?\u201d\u201cYes, Hoffman Transportation Company, which carries goods in huge trucks and delivers anything anywhere. Flour, alcohol, canned food, clothes, fuel\u2026 Sometimes drugs, smuggled products, magic wine are also loaded.\u201dOliver just listened while nodding his head.Listening to Murphy\u2019s detailed explanation, the Hoffman family didn\u2019t seem like a small family.In addition to legal transportation, they delivered Crime Firm\u2019s goods, and it was said that they had a high delivery success rate due to their connection with the cops.In other words, it was a family that has a huge share in the distribution of illegal goods, and such a family was experiencing some difficulties recently.\u201cWhat\u2019s the trouble?\u201d\u201cSomeone keeps attacking their truck.\u201d\u201cAttacking? Who?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know that for sure. It\u2019s a field where it\u2019s not weird to get backstabbed at any time. There are many reasons and suspects, including personal resentment, business, and politics.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 can\u2019t you guess?\u201d\u201cActually, there are a few. If Hoffman doesn\u2019t do the job properly, the Crime Firm board will hand over the business to the others\u2026.. There are four or five families aiming for that. But I\u2019m not sure. We don\u2019t even know what kind of mercenary they\u2019re using.\u201d\u201cSo, you want me to catch the attackers?\u201d\u201cYes, for your information, Hoffman has already tried a few times. They spend a lot of money on famous solvers. But still, they couldn\u2019t stop them, and just lost all their money\u2026.. Oh! And there\u2019s one more thing. \u201c\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cRight now, the truck drivers are going on a strike.\u201d\u201cWhy? Is it because they were attacked and their colleagues died?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s that, too, but the major thing was, the company tweaked the documents and stole half of the insurance money that they were supposed to receive.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026isn\u2019t that a bad thing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very bad thing.\u201d\u201cSo, what do you want me to do?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that the drivers went on strike, they were also supported by the union, who are even providing them support by hiring Solvers. They\u2019re determined. I\u2019d like you to help me with that, too.\u201dOliver shook his head.\u201cI don\u2019t want to do that\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to get involved with ordinary people. Since I\u2019m a Warlock, I might go to jail if something went wrong. No, I might even die. I don\u2019t want that.\u201dThere were also other things that Oliver didn\u2019t like about it, but he didn\u2019t bother talking about them.\u201cOh, my explanation was lacking. I\u2019m not asking you to kill the drivers, I\u2019m asking you to help me with the negotiations.\u201d\u201cNegotiation? I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know anything about negotiation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s enough if someone like Mr. Warlock stands by my side. The situation isn\u2019t easy on the company side either, so we\u2019re trying to reach an agreement at an appropriate level by paying 65% of the insurance premium.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t look very good.\u201d\u201cThis is normal. Regular businesses often do this. You can think of 35 percent as a kind of fee.\u201dIt still didn\u2019t seem good for Oliver but he didn\u2019t bother to argue.He knew that Murphy knows better than him about how things pan out in Landa.\u201cThen why aren\u2019t the workers negotiating?\u201d\u201cOriginally, they would do it, but the labor union members who are helping them keep intervening. They\u2019re asking us to double the compensation. The people in the Union just want to fill their pockets. Even if we doubled the compensation, the share that drivers get will not be much different. In other words, I want you to stand by my side so that my persuasion can have little force in it. Of course, I might need your strength if a situation arises, but I\u2019ll try to end it as peacefully as possible.\u201dMurphy explained very gently, in a much more careful way than before.\u201cI don\u2019t know if my presence will help?\u201dMurphy took a sip of the magic wine.\u201c\u2026I saw Mr. Warlock fight the Wizards. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be helpful. In particular, more interesting rumors have spread recently.\u201d\u201cRumors?\u201d\u201cYeah, the story of a warlock from District T who survived after fighting against Puppet. The city officials are trying to block the spread as much as possible, but eventually, the rumors will spread.\u201d\u201c\u2026 . I didn\u2019t survive, he just spared me.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. What\u2019s important is that you met Puppet and survived.\u201dOliver pondered whether this was a good thing.It was true that his goal was to increase his reputation as a Solver, but for some reason, he thought this was not the right way.The defeat of Puppet was not solely due to Oliver\u2019s power, but rather due to powerful energy sources such as the entrance to hell and artificial soul.After pondering for a while, Oliver gave up thinking about it since it had already happened and there was nothing he could do about it.\u201cBy the way, are you going to give me a warehouse if I help you with the Hoffman Transportation Company?\u201d\u201cYes, we can customize the warehouse to your liking, whether it\u2019s a purchase or a long-term rental.\u201d\u201cThen, can I see the warehouse? I\u2019d like to check it out.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMurphy took Oliver to a warehouse near the factory area. It was quite deep, and there were a lot of other warehouses around, so the warehouse couldn\u2019t be seen easily.It was like a tree hidden in the forest.Looking at Oliver\u2019s expression Murphy asked.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty quiet, isn\u2019t it? Mr. Warlock.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s actually a quiet place. Some of the warehouses here are owned by gangs, and a few people, including myself. We collect money and give them to the cops on a regular basis, so they don\u2019t usually come in. Of course, it\u2019s a different story when there are a lot of cases.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cYes. But usually, they don\u2019t even come close. Of course, even if that happens, it might be for some petty thieves, you don\u2019t have to worry about it. Security is tight around this area, so even thieves don\u2019t come often.\u201dOliver understood the meaning behind Murphy\u2019s words \u2018security is tight\u2019 as he looked around. It was not often seen, but he did see some security guards and warehouse workers, who don\u2019t look like one, loitering around the place.The place looked perfect for Oliver \u2013 Separated from the outside, even neighbors don\u2019t care about each other. It was perfect for doing black magic research.\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201dMurphy stopped in front of a building.It was a shabby two-story house in the corner, and it was not conspicuous, but it was a building whose first floor was arbitrarily demolished and converted into a warehouse.Oliver went inside and looked around.It was crude and narrow but he didn\u2019t think it was that bad.On the contrary, it even looked good.\u2018How should I make it a place to do experiments?\u2019As Oliver was figuring out how to turn this place into a laboratory, Murphy spoke up.\u201cMr. Warlock?\u201d\u201cUm, yes?\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. Did I interrupt you?\u201d\u201cOh no, I was just thinking about how to use this space.\u201d\u201cHere? This is the highlight feature. Come this way.\u201dOliver didn\u2019t know what he meant, but he soon understood the meaning behind those words.As they exited through the narrow byway of the passage up to the second floor, Oliver saw a secret entrance going down, and below it was a refreshingly spacious basement.\u201cThis?\u201d\u201cThis is the real warehouse. The entrance is narrow, so it\u2019s hard to see, and I think it\u2019s a good place for Mr. Warlock to use.\u201dOliver nodded his head.It was spacious, and there were three large tables that could be used as a laboratory table and a bookshelf shelf to put things on.\u201cI can use this.\u201d\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\u201cYes. I really like it.\u201dOliver said what he thought as words.The environment was comfortable enough, and the surrounding location was not bad.He didn\u2019t know anything about real estate prices yet, but from what he had been picking up, it seemed like a place that would be very expensive.But he wanted this warehouse.\u201cUm\u2026. May I ask you a few questions?\u201d\u201cYes, tell me.\u201d\u201cIf you had a request, you could have done it through Mr. Forrest. Why are you talking to me about it yourself?\u201d\u201cI hope you don\u2019t misunderstand, Mr. Warlock. I\u2019m not trying to do anything strange here. I just wanted to get some help from Mr. Warlock, so I said it myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we last met, and Mr. Warlock\u2019s reputation has grown even further. Well, it\u2019s not something I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve seen Mr. Warlock\u2019s skills\u2026 . And, since there is a high probability that my request will be rejected, I took the liberty of talking to you directly.\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t understand\u2026 This is a problem of the Hoffman family, why is Mr. Murphy trying so hard for it?\u201d\u201cBecause\u2026 helping them with this might increase the profit of my business.\u201d\u201cProfit?\u201d\u201cYes. Currently, the Magic wines I\u2019m producing are not only sold in our pub but it\u2019s also sold in other places.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cFor the places in this district, I make a deal myself, but for selling to a district or city other than here, I sell it through Crime Firm since I don\u2019t have a sales network.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause it goes through an intermediary, the profits get reduced, and the quality also gets disturbed because there are some people who play with things during the distribution process. This affects my business motto.\u201d\u201cSo you want to help the Hoffman company?\u201d\u201cYeah. If I try to create a sales network by myself, it will be difficult and risky, but it\u2019s much safer if an intermediate organization like the Hoffman family is involved.\u201d\u201cAn intermediate organization?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the organization that\u2019s right below the director of the Crime Firm who manages this district. It\u2019s also above the sub-organizations like mine. In short, they have quite a bit of a say in District T.\u201dMurphy\u2019s voice grew stronger.\u201cTo make this work, I need the help of Mr. Warlock.\u201dIt seemed like a far-fetched story, but Murphy\u2019s words were sincere.Not only was he richer than before, but his ambitions were also even more blazing.And, it didn\u2019t seem bad in Oliver\u2019s eyes.Although it was a little different, it was a beautiful light similar to the early Marie, Peter, and Rosbane.\u2018He seems to have some other reason as well.\u2019Murphy asked with a slightly nervous look.\u201cMr. Warlock?\u201d\u201cUm, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI think the conditions are fine. I\u2019ll help and get a warehouse.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d\u201cCan I also add a condition?\u201d\u201c\u2026? \u2026Yes, tell me.\u201d\u201cPlease set a reasonable fee and commission it via Mr. Forrest. Then, I will accept the request\u2026.. It\u2019s not a big deal, but I\u2019m just scared.\u201dScared, Murphy didn\u2019t seem to believe Oliver\u2019s words, but he nodded.\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want anything to do with the general public. It won\u2019t be good if I end up meeting the city officials and Paladins once again.\u201dMurphy was about to say something, but then he withdrew. Instead, he asked.\u201c\u2026.Okay. However, if you think they will use violence during negotiations, can you protect me?\u201d\u201cYes, I will.\u201d\u201cThank you. Then I\u2019ll tell them that\u2026 If we have to put a formal commission request to Mr. Forrest, it will take some time\u2026\u201dIt was like Oliver heard. In the case of Forrest, he formally investigates the commission he receives.Kent said that it was a cumbersome process and some brokers skip it, but Forrest doesn\u2019t. Thanks to that, it was said as a Broker Forrest was safer even if he was inefficient.\u201cIt will take two or three days at the earliest, is that okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026 .To be honest, it\u2019s a waste of time, but it\u2019s not a waste of time either.\u201d\u201cUm, may I ask you a favor?\u201d\u201cPlease?\u201d\u201cUm, can I use this warehouse from now on? There were some things I wanted to do, but the situation didn\u2019t work out. Maybe it\u2019ll help with the job\u2026..\u201dFour days after his conversation with Murphy, Oliver was sweating in the underground warehouse.He took off his jacket, wore jeans and work gloves that he bought from a secondhand clothing store, and wrestled with the Corpse doll on the table.Oliver\u2019s experiment failed on the first day, but now he has learned some tricks thanks to his repeated practice without sleeping.Oliver thought, rubbing his sleepy eyes.\u2018Sorry, Mr. Kent. You told me not to skip meals and sleep, but I couldn\u2019t stop this because it was fun. Please understand.\u2019Oliver repaired the \u201cWarlock\u201d and \u201cSniper\u201d Corpse dolls to some extent, and after that, he looked at the \u201cRag\u201d and the \u201cSwordsman\u201d Corpse dolls, which had been half-renovated.All of these were Puppet\u2019s corpse dolls, which Oliver picked up. There were several other Corpse dolls besides this, but most of them were completely dismantled as materials to fix the [Warlock], [Sniper], [Rag], and [Swordsman], and it was not a waste.It was clumsy, but it was Oliver\u2019s own corpse doll.\u201cAnd I was able to do a fun experiment.\u201dOliver thought as he looked at the test tube near the corpse doll.Inside the test tube, there was something like a black sphere. It looked like a minion, but in truth, it was not an ordinary minion. It was a minion made by mixing Life-force and emotions.Oliver took out a flask of emotion and Life-force and fed the Minion in the test tube. The Minion gleamed with a faint emotion of joy and devoured the emotions and Life-force.\u2018Interesting. I was just mimicking Mr. Puppet\u2019s artificial Soul\u2026 never thought something like this would come\u2026 By the way, how should I name this? I can\u2019t differentiate if I keep calling it Minion. What should I use? Um\u2026 It\u2019s not disposable, so I think there needs to be a proper name\u2026.. Let\u2019s just call him [Child].\u2019Oliver pondered for two seconds and came up with a name, and at that moment, he heard a beeping sound in his ear.Oliver picked up the communication device that Forrest provided from the workbench.It was his first time using it. Oliver pressed the green button on the device and took it to his ear.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s me. Can you hear me ?\u201d\u201cYes, I can hear you, Mr. Forrest\u2026.. How have you been?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not doing fine. Thanks to you, I suddenly have a job. I would have just ignored it if it wasn\u2019t for what happened in the contaminated zone.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. And you don\u2019t have to feel that way. It was not Mr. Forrest\u2019s fault. Even if it wasn\u2019t for the Contaminated zone I know Mr. Forrest would have kindly helped me. Even if I\u2019m ignorant, I know that much. Thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dForrest was silent.Oliver couldn\u2019t see the emotions because it was a conversation through a communication device, and for some reason, Forrest seemed pleased.Soon, Forrest\u2019s voice was heard again.\u201cFirst of all, the investigation is over. Most of what Murphy said is true.\u201dOliver didn\u2019t really respond. Because he knew from the conversation that most of what he said was true.For the most part.\u201cWhy did he talk to me directly? If he was giving me a warehouse, I think I would have accepted even if he gave it through Mr. Forrest.\u201d\u201cI did some research on that, too. It\u2019s not entirely false to say that he did it in the fear of rejection, but the most important reason for doing it this way was showmanship.\u201d\u201cShowmanship?\u201d\u201cRather than hiring you through me, what would others say if he were to come forward and hire you himself\u2026. It would look as if he has a closer relationship with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cTo put it simply. He could say to his colleagues [Hey look here, I know a great Warlock who\u2019s the talk of the town and I can personally ask him for a favor]\u2026.. It seems like Murphy wants to imprint this impression on the Hoffman family and higher-level organizations within the Crime Firm. People with a powerful force behind them are respected everywhere\u2026. It\u2019s a shallow trick, but it\u2019s not a bad one to work with\u2026.. Are you uncomfortable with it?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dOliver answered the truth. He had seen and experienced more like this in the orphanage and Mine, so it wasn\u2019t entirely alienating one for Oliver.And above all, he could use a warehouse, so he had no complaints whatsoever.Forest once again asked.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSometimes I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re nice, or stupid, or scary. Whatever it is, it\u2019s up to you\u2026.. So, are you going to officially accept the job? There\u2019s no problem if you refuse now.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll accept it. I\u2019ve already benefited a bit.\u201d\u201cWell, then okay\u2026 Now, moving on, Murphy wants you to come now. He said Jimmy Hoffman was running out of patience.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s Jimmy Hoffman?\u201d\u201cThe young boss of the Hoffman family who runs the transportation company. Murphy asked you to come as soon as possible. It seems like they\u2019re going to have a fight with the drivers. There are also Solvers protecting the drivers, so if you do something wrong, you will only bleed for no reason.\u201dOliver wiped the sweat from his body and hurriedly put on his clothes.\u201cDo you know anything about the Solvers who are protecting the truck drivers?\u201d\u201cYeah. Well, it wasn\u2019t that difficult, it\u2019s Arthur from District N and other veterans-turned-solvers\u2026 Come to think of it, haven\u2019t you guys already met?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter getting ready, Oliver went straight to the place informed by Forrest.It was the Hoffman Transportation Company on 35th Street, a company that handles a small part of Crime Firm\u2019s logisticsThere was a low wooden fence around the open site, and there were dozens of trucks that seemed to be unused.It was quite old, but it was still good compared to the ones in the innermost part of the site.It wasn\u2019t known when the building at the site was built but it was worn out like a naked mouse.In addition, in front of the building, a group of people was arguing loudly.\u201cLet go of me, you piece of sh*ts! I\u2019m gonna take this opportunity to kill those b*tches! If they get a bullet in their head, they\u2019ll learn something!!!\u201dA man who seemed to be in his mid to late 20s could be seen shouting, and some people who seemed older than him were stopping him.He was filled with all kinds of emotions such as anger, anxiety, and irritation. He was literally in a state where he was swayed by his emotions.On the other hand, others around him were trying to suppress emotions such as Irritation, Disappointment, and frustration, while trying to stop the man.\u201cAh, I understand, Boss. But, let\u2019s wait a little longer. Murphy says someone is coming soon.\u201d\u201cDo you fu*kers think I can\u2019t blow the heads of some puss*es by myself?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that, Boss. Don\u2019t you know, it\u2019s noisy in the city these days. It\u2019s not good to stand out at such a time\u2026 When it\u2019s appropriate, let\u2019s re-educate those fu*kers. Now is not the time for that.\u201dOlder men took turns persuading the young man.Interestingly, the young man who was consumed by anger was also wary of the eyes of the older men who were persuading him, and the scene felt quite amusing to Oliver, who was watching.Even though they could be seen exchanging their thoughts, they weren\u2019t talking about what they were really thinking.\u00a0 It was as if they didn\u2019t want to show anything on the outside.\u201cUm.\u201dOliver saw Murphy, who was standing still from afar, watching the situation. He patted his chin and watched them quarrel without saying a word.He was thinking deeply about something, and suddenly his eyes shone with a cunning light.\u201cMr. Murphy.\u201dOliver approached and talked to him.Murphy frowned with his brows narrowed, but soon loosened his expression and politely greeted Oliver.\u201cOh, Mr. Warlock. You\u2019re here. I\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201dAll eyes turned towards Oliver.They all looked at Oliver with a sense of welcome, but soon those emotions turned into questions and doubts.An awkward silence fell for a moment, then a fat middle-aged man spoke.\u201cHey, Murphy\u2026.. Is this the Solver you were talking about?\u201dA fat, middle-aged man asked Murphy with emotions that shone with contempt, to which Murphy responded with firm faith.\u201cYes, his name is Dave, the warlock I was talking about. I owe a lot to him.\u201dEveryone couldn\u2019t open their mouths hastily because of Murphy\u2019s guarantee, but Oliver could see that they didn\u2019t seem to have any trust in him.They just didn\u2019t show it on the outside, and at that moment, someone said.\u201cI knew this would happen. I told you before, didn\u2019t I?\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes were focused on someone. At the point where everyone\u2019s sight converged, stood a man in his 40s in a neatly dressed suit.His appearance was that of one in his mid-30s, in attractive all-white hair and a neat beard, which seemed to be one that had been cut at an expensive barbershop.\u201cUm\u2026 Who is that?\u201d\u201c\u2026 This is Hilton, a warlock who signed an exclusive contract with the Hoffman family. He has been around since the time of the previous Boss.\u201dWhile Murphy answered Oliver\u2019s question, the man named Hilton pointed to Oliver.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me everyone believes in this kid who doesn\u2019t even seem to be in his 20s. Are you really thinking this brat could take care of Stonefist Arthur? If you send him, those drivers will look down on us even more. They\u2019re already in high spirits with the support from the Union\u2026..If you send a guy like this, it\u2019s like pouring oil on it.\u201dAs soon as his words ended, muffled voices could be heard here and there.\u201cIs that kid really a warlock?\u201d\u201cI think Stonefist Arthur would send him flying in one punch.\u201d\u201cHe would look like a puppy in front of those veteran Solvers.\u201dOliver wasn\u2019t particularly angry or displeased since this has been the reaction of all those people who met him for the first time. It was natural because they did not know him and therefore they lacked trust.It wasn\u2019t that serious because Oliver just had to work hard and instill faith in them, but Murphy does not seem to think that way, he looked at Oliver\u2019s expression with a flustered expression and said urgently.\u201cEveryone. Once again, I\u2019ll vouch for Dave. He\u2019s a real deal. I\u2019ve seen it myself. I\u2019m sure of his skills. So, please don\u2019t be rude to the person that I\u2019ve invited. As I\u2019ve said earlier, I was the one who asked for him to come personally.\u201dMurphy spoke in a polite manner, but he did not hide his displeasure.The people of the Hoffman family fluttered a little and looked away.Oliver had heard that the Hoffman family was a senior organization, but looking at the scene that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\u2018Or is there some secret that I don\u2019t know?\u2019It was nothing serious, but Oliver was curious, he wondered whether Murphy would answer if he asked.\u201c\u2026Shut the fu*k, Murphy. How dare a newbie like you yell at our family? I couldn\u2019t have imagined such a thing when Mr. James was around.\u201dHilton said with malice. He seemed to be doing this on purpose, and as he expected, the atmosphere became serious, but at that moment, a chubby, soft-looking man intervened.\u201cHey, hey. Let\u2019s all calm down\u2026 Murphy, I understand that you\u2019re trying to help us, but don\u2019t you think you are being a little rude here?\u201d\u201cWhat do you expect me to do? I brought the young Warlock to deal with the serious situation, and do you want me to stay still when you guys disrespect him? I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Hilton, but this Warlock is the man who has been the talk of the town recently. Didn\u2019t I tell you a few times already?\u201d\u201cHow long do you think I was in this business, Murphy? Half of a Solver\u2019s reputation is just an illusion. Do you know how many Geniuses I\u2019ve seen appear and disappear\u2026 Boss, let\u2019s just go with my suggestion. Give me some money, I\u2019ll get my old friends and thrash those cheeky truckers as well as catch those robbers who are trying to threaten our business.\u201dHearing Hilton\u2019s words, a few people gathered around the young Boss and started discussing. It seemed to be about the lack of money, and there also seemed to be some other conflict.There were a lot of things Oliver wanted to ask Murphy, but he decided to do his job first.Work had an order, and he knew that he could ask for something only if he did something first.\u201cExcuse me?\u201dAt those words, all the eyes in the open site turned toward Oliver.\u201cSorry while you are busy. Everyone seems to have doubts about my skills, so why don\u2019t you test me? Then, I guess we don\u2019t have to quarrel with each other.\u201dEveryone looked at Oliver with emotions of wonder as if they couldn\u2019t believe what Oliver had just said.They felt like seeing something out of place that doesn\u2019t fit the situation.At that moment, the well-dressed warlock named Hilton spoke. He showed hostility for some unknown reason.\u201cHa\u2026 Look at a youngster in good spirits. So, how are you going to prove it?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t know. How can I prove it?\u201d\u201cHahahaha! He\u2019s just a fool. There\u2019s a simple way.\u201dWith those words, Hilton extracted emotions from his test tube at once.Soon, a black magic circle got formed in the air, and hate bullets filled with murderous intent got loaded.The black magic circle was used as the central axis for condensing the emotions instead of the fingers, and Oliver found the idea pretty interesting.It was inefficient, but if done well, it might give you a surprise.\u201cThen, let me see your strength\u2026.!!\u201dBAMFaba Baba Bang\u2014\u2014\u2014!Oliver\u2019s shadow tentacles instantly rose from under Hilton\u2019s feet and smashed the ready-for-launch hate Bullets.It was an instant, less than a second, and everyone who saw this scene couldn\u2019t keep their mouths shut.Hilton, Hoffman Family members, and Murphy, everyone was dumbfounded.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Was I mistaken? I thought you were going to test my skills with a light match.\u201dOliver spoke softly, but the mood showed no signs of improvement.Eventually, Oliver whispered to Murphy.\u201cShall I just go?\u201d\u201cNo! No! No! Don\u2019t go.\u201dThe one who intervened was the young man who was holding a gun and wrestling with the older men a while ago.He came to Oliver and introduced himself as the boss of the Hoffman family, Jimmy Hoffman.\u201cI\u2019m taking over the family in the footsteps of my father, James Hoffman. Nice to meet you\u2026 Murphy, you\u2019ve brought the right person. Thank you.\u201dAll of a sudden, their interest in Hilton faded away, and everyone flocked around Oliver instead.They looked at him like a boat they met while drowning.\u201cAre you going to help us?\u201d\u201cYes, I signed a contract with Mr. Murphy.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026.Very good! Murphy, I\u2019ll grant you all the terms and conditions you want as long as this case works out. I promise you in my father\u2019s name.\u201d\u201cThank you, Jimmy.\u201d\u201cWell, please help me right away. First, let\u2019s get rid of those arrogant truck drivers and then the Solvers who help them.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dOliver looked at Murphy in silence since what Jimmy Hoffman said right now was something that was not in the contract.As if to prove it, Murphy had a perplexed look on his face due to the situation, and he begged Oliver for his pardon, then took Jimmy to a corner and said something.The conversation turned into a shout-out in the middle with one or two swear words heard every few seconds. The man named Jimmy screamed nervously as he did when Oliver saw him for the first time. The emotions were very unstable, but Murphy persuaded politely and persistently.It seemed like Murphy was in control of the situation. There were words like believe and trust that could be heard, and soon after Murphy came alone toward Oliver.\u201cJimmy has allowed me to negotiate on his behalf. Can you help me, Mr. Warlock?\u201dOliver followed Murphy to the parking lot where the drivers of the Hoffman Transport Company were on strike.It wasn\u2019t far, and on the way, Murphy gave a brief overview of the Hoffman family, about the temperamental Jimmy who succeeded his father as the boss of the family a few months ago, and the fact that he succeeded his father, who had an excellent reputation and skills, and also the fact that he was a little impatient.\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s why he was so angry. I hope you understand. After all, nervousness is every young man\u2019s characteristic.\u201dA plump man with a wrinkle on his face said as if he was in agreement with Murphy.His name was Frank. He was the one who stopped Hilton when he taunted Oliver.He was the one Jimmy sent for help and surveillance, and somehow he seemed very close to Murphy.\u201cBy the way. That\u2019s amazing. Murphy\u2026 I can\u2019t believe you brought someone like this! No, I heard the story and believed it, but it\u2019s even more amazing to see it in person. Thank you very much. You have relieved our urgent financial need\u2026 .. you\u2019re amazing even though you\u2019re young.\u201d\u201cNo. I also need the Hoffmann Transport Company\u2019s sales network, so you don\u2019t have to praise me for what I did.\u201dHis words were kind, but when Oliver looked at the emotional state, it was more cunning.It was a little bit shady, but Oliver thought he knew what it was.\u2018But it\u2019s not the time to ask yet.\u2019\u201cBy the way, Mr. Dave. You said you knew one of the Solvers on the driver\u2019s side, right?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s Mr. Arthur.\u201d\u201cAh, I see. Isn\u2019t he that strange person with a stone-like arm? what was that\u2026 .?\u201d\u201cA golem prosthetic arm?\u201d\u201cAh! Yes. Yes. It smashed some of our kids. It\u2019s a complete boulder\u2026 He hit the truck with his fist and it rolled a few laps. Oh my god\u2026 We came back rolling our tails when we saw that, and it hurt Jimmy\u2019s pride. Hilton, that guy keeps talking nonsense. He was docile when Mr. James was alive, but as soon as he died, he started acting like he was the boss of the family.\u201dFrank\u2019s words were mixed with complaints and dissatisfaction.Murphy knew and pretended not to know, and somehow Oliver found the whole thing pretty interesting.\u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re still in charge. I think Arthur is in charge there, and knowing that Mr. Dave is familiar with him, it\u2019ll at least make it easier for us to start a conversation.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll like it. I haven\u2019t talked to him much\u2026and, besides, I\u2019m not good at negotiation.\u201dOliver said as he recalled his negotiation with the inn hostess. It ended with a shout.\u201cI\u2019ll persuade them. Mr. Warlock, you have to just open a window for us to talk, and protect our backs in case of any unforeseen circumstances.\u201dMurphy said so secretly with excitement and ambition.Apparently, his purpose was not simply to help the Hoffman family and secure a sales network.Somehow, it seemed like everyone connected to Jimmy Hoffman has some kind of ulterior motive with them, and Oliver found these kinds of human emotions interesting and worth a study.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mr. Arthur. Nice to meet you again.\u201dOliver greeted Arthur politely and looked around.In addition to trucks, there were a lot of truck drivers around the parking lot, all with bats or blackjacks in their hands.Oliver thought it would hurt quite a bit if he got hit by that, and he understood why the Hoffman family couldn\u2019t control it prematurely.In the loud noisy atmosphere, Arthur spoke again\u201cIt\u2019s the first time since the contaminated zone, right? Are you hired by Hoffman?\u201d\u201cActually, I was hired by Mr. Murphy. Did you get a new prosthetic arm?\u201dOliver asked, pointing at the new Golem arm.The arm looked stronger than the one he had before looking at the amount of magic that was flowing through it.\u201cYeah. Sadly, thanks to that, the debt has increased\u2026 But what\u2019s even sadder is that I met you now. Jimmy, did that kid ask you to beat us?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Wait, it\u2019s not like that.\u201dMurphy interrupted the conversation between the two. He seized the opportunity like a fox and bit like a wolf.\u201cWe\u2019re here to negotiate. So let\u2019s put down what we\u2019re holding and have a conversation. Aren\u2019t we all Landa citizens?\u201d\u201cThe conversation ended in the fu*king evening\u2026if you wanted to talk, you shouldn\u2019t have broken Huff\u2019s arm.\u201dWhen someone from the crowd spoke those words, the word [Right] echoed through the space.Oliver asked Jimmy\u2019s subordinate, Frank.\u201cWho\u2019s Huff?\u201d\u201c\u2026He is one of the employees here. I broke his arm as he was talking back to the boss.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dOliver understood the reason for people\u2019s anger, and why there was no atmosphere for conversation.When everyone thought there won\u2019t be any progress with the current situation, a helping hand came from an unexpected place.\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s all calm down a bit and talk.\u201dIt was Arthur.\u201cHuh? What did you just say, Mr. Arthur!? Did you forget what these guys did?!\u201d\u201cYes, there will be no conversation until they accept the terms that we put out first!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that they\u2019ll say they\u2019re going to negotiate but in the end, they will just bark at us like they did last time, and why are you taking their side?\u201dDespite the angry cries from the crowd, Arthur was calm. He slowly lifted his golem prosthetic arm, pointed at Oliver, and said.\u201cIt was because they didn\u2019t have that guy at that time\u2026 I came here to help, not to put my life on the line.\u201dHearing Arthur\u2019s words, a young man approached Arthur. He also gave off a unique aura of a person who lived with violence.\u201cHe looks like a fu*king child, Arthur. Why are you acting like a coward? It\u2019s very disappointing.\u201dArthur reacted as soon as he heard the word \u2018Coward\u2019.\u201c\u2026Listen up, you motherfu*ker. When you were sucking your mom\u2019s titties, I was killing natives in the New World with my fu*king hands. Next, I went to the Eastern Company and put a flag of the Great Empire the size of 40 times your di*k on top of the unknown kingdom. If you call me a fu*king coward just one more time, I\u2019ll rip off your fu*king di*k and shove it into your rude mouth, so trust this uncle and don\u2019t mess with that guy. Do you understand?\u201dWhen the calm Arthur growled with anger, not only the young man but also other Solvers and truck drivers felt discouraged.Everyone went silent and after a while, Arthur slowly came toward Oliver and said.\u201cHey, Dave.\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Arthur.\u201d\u201cNow that I\u2019ve saved your face, I\u2019ll ask you a favor. We\u2019ll listen to you, but if it\u2019s outrageous, we\u2019ll turn it down. Promise me that you\u2019ll go back then and won\u2019t make a fuss. Is it possible?\u201d\u201cYes, of course. From the beginning, I have had no intention of harming the people here. I just came for my client\u2019s security.\u201d\u201cAll right, then. Follow me, I\u2019ll show you around.\u201dArthur guided Oliver to a place on the corner of the parking lot that looked like an office.Because of the narrow space, it looked like a place where it would be difficult to breathe even if only three people went in, but right now, at least five people were inside it.Jimmy Huffman\u2019s negotiating agent, Murphy, his overseer Frank, and their bodyguard Oliver. Opposite them was Denny, the truck driver\u2019s representative, and his bodyguard, Arthur.They were so close that they could hear each other\u2019s breathing.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\u201cNice to see you, too.\u201dMurphy and Denny greeted each other first and then followed by others.Everyone kept their manners, but they were busy trying to figure out each other\u2019s intentions, and this was similar to a battle, only in a different form.It was Denny, the truck driver\u2019s representative, who struck first.\u201cLet\u2019s get straight to the point. What are you here to negotiate? I\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019ve already said the terms.\u201d\u201cYes, I know because I\u2019ve heard it. Double the compensation for the drivers who died during delivery. And after that, wage improvement, right?\u201d\u201cThere are a few other small things, but the most important thing is those two.\u201dThen Frank stepped in. He was covered in a cold sweat and busily gestured as if to represent the feeling of nervousness.\u201cLook at this, Denny. Are you crazy? Twice\u2026 I don\u2019t even know if you can get 65 percent.\u201dThe voice rose in the narrow space.Frank said 35 percent of the insurance money is usually eaten by employers, and Denny called it a bad habit and shouted that they should receive twice as much as compensation for the damage they received.The voices kept getting higher and higher, and it seemed that there won\u2019t be any agreement, but at that moment, Murphy intervened.\u201cEveryone, calm down\u2026 Let\u2019s find an Agreement that\u2019s good for both parties.\u201d\u201cAgreement?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ve never seen you before, so listen carefully. The point of agreement went out of hand. Jimmy, when that kid stole more than half of our insurance money and broke Huff\u2019s arm\u2026. that insurance fee was also deducted from our wages.\u201d\u201cIf you continue to go on a strike like this, won\u2019t you lose money? Do you think the cost of living would go down from next week?\u201dDenny paused for a moment as if he had pinpointed their weakness correctly.As Forrest told Oliver, the workers seemed to be creatures that face life-or-death situations every once a week.He also mentioned that if their wages get pushed back by even once in their weekly pay, they could be kicked out of their house and would be left with nothing to feed their families.Understanding this weakness, Murphy pushed.\u201cWhat about next week\u2019s rent and living expenses? Don\u2019t you have to feed your kids?\u201d\u201cIf we tighten our belts\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll starve to death. Of course, that would be the case only if Jimmy leaves you alone until then.\u201d\u201cAre you threatening us? Fu*k it, so what! The Union will look after us!!\u201d\u201cEven if they watch your back, you\u2019ll still bleed\u2026.. Do you really think they\u2019re helping you out of care? They\u2019re the same as the guys in Pinkman. One of the things I\u2019ve learned in my life is that I\u2019m the only one who cares about myself. I pretend to help now, but I\u2019ll sneak out if there\u2019s any danger or greater benefit\u2026 Just accept Jimmy\u2019s terms. 65 percent compensation, a 5 percent increase per day. It\u2019s unconventional, especially in this city. Of course, this won\u2019t be enough. So I\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 .What do you mean?\u201dMurphy pulled out a silver cigarette case and took a cigarette. Then he recommended one to Denny.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s expensive. Let\u2019s have a smoke.\u201dDenny hesitated and picked up a cigarette, Murphy lit the cigarette and continued.\u201cOnce the commotion is over, the Hoffman family and our Kimbell family will do business together. It\u2019s about distributing Magic wine all over the country. Have you ever tried out Magic wine?\u201d\u201c\u2026.Yes, it tasted pretty good.\u201d\u201cThank you. I have faith in my product. I don\u2019t make trash to earn another penny. I\u2019m not those piece of sh*ts who try to make money with anything and everything. I\u2019m going to make a proper product, a product that would make everyone want to drink it. There\u2019s going to be a lot of money.\u201dMurphy rubbed his thumb and index finger. Before they knew it, everyone except Oliver fell in love with the story.\u201cBut to do that, I have to pay attention not only to the product but also to the distribution. You guys are excellent at delivery, so I will give you incentives based on the amount of Magic wine you deliver every week.\u201d\u201cIncentive?\u201d\u201cYeah, Jimmy and I decided to split 4-6 each, and I\u2019ll provide for you from my share. If the size of the business grows, the insurance money can be ridiculous.\u201d\u201c\u2026are you serious?\u201d\u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m doing this here? Although I\u2019m not familiar with you guys, I\u2019m also a veteran. On the honor of being a soldier, I never lie\u2026.. Think about it yourself after you\u2019ve tried my product. Whether this business will fail or succeed.\u201dMurphy\u2019s words made a lot of sense. The room filled with silence was evidence of that, but Denny was still hesitating.\u201cPlease wait a moment\u2026.. I think I should talk to the labor union.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we don\u2019t have time. I\u2019ve barely persuaded Jimmy to come here.\u2026. And, of course, isn\u2019t it obvious that the union will tell you not to fall for such sweet talks? Since, if we make an agreement, they won\u2019t get anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026We\u2019re in trouble, too. If we agree with you like this, the union will no longer help us. What if you break your promise? We should also have a minimum safety net.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019m lying?\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one we\u2019re talking about here. Jimmy is included. We know his personality, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll retaliate.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll help. I put the safety and interests of my co-workers first.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you know how the floor works. As long as you belong to the Crime Firm, you\u2019re limited in what you can do when Jimmy pushes you, right?\u201dMurphy tried to say something, but soon he shut his mouth.He was confident in blocking Jimmy, but it seemed that he couldn\u2019t say anything, and thanks to that, the meeting fell into a stalemate again.Everyone exuded emotions of confusion and frustration, and it seemed that the meeting would come to an end if it went on like this.And if that happens, Oliver could be pushed into a situation where he would not be able to use the warehouse.\u2018I got an ID and a warehouse, and Murphy seems confident enough to stop Jimmy\u2026 Um.\u2019Oliver quietly raised his hand.\u201cExcuse me, how about I help you then?\u201dEveryone saw Oliver.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt, I thought I could help you with that.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Who are you?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s Dave. A Solver who made a name for himself in District T.\u201dArthur whispered to Denny.\u201cHelp\u2026 what do you mean?\u201d\u201cIf Mr. Murphy or Mr. Jimmy breaks their promise and retaliates against you, I\u2019ll help you for free. Maybe once or twice?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dEveryone went silent and looked at Oliver. They kept blinking as if they could not understand what Oliver was trying to do here, and at that moment, Murphy pulled Oliver\u2019s hand and whispered.\u201cMr. Warlock, what are you doing now?\u201d\u201cI thought I\u2019d try and help you out a bit because the negotiation seemed not progressing. Aren\u2019t you going to keep your promise?\u201d\u201c\u2026I intend to keep it.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s fine\u2026. Or should I stop?\u201dMurphy looked around for a moment and said.\u201cNo. Please continue.\u201dDenny spoke.\u201cAre you serious now?\u201d\u201cYes. Is there a problem?\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s a problem\u2026. Arthur admits your skills, but I honestly don\u2019t know who you are. I don\u2019t like making deals with a warlock\u2026 I once almost got killed by a Warlock who came to pick up dead bodies during trench warfare. He almost killed everyone by releasing some black magic rats. If it were you, would you trust a Warlock after all that?!\u201dIt made sense in its own way.From his experience, Oliver knew that people trust when money is involved or if they spend some time together.However, he did not know how to build trust in someone who he barely knew and with the money he barely had.After thinking for a while about how to persuade, Oliver spoke.\u201cUm\u2026 Then, how about signing an official contract through an intermediary?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou can officially sign a contract with me through my broker. If I don\u2019t fulfill my promise, it will hurt my broker too, so I have a reason to keep my promise. What do you think?\u201dOnce again everyone went silent, and once again they did not know what Oliver was trying to do here.\u201c\u2026are you serious?\u201d\u201cYeah, I also have something to gain from this job, so I want to finish it as well as possible.\u201d\u201cBut your skills\u2026\u201d\u201cI guarantee his skills.\u201d\u201cArthur. I believe in you, but our survival depends on it too, so I can\u2019t just trust you, can I?\u201dAt that moment, Oliver had a good idea.\u201cThen, how about I take down the robbers that are attacking the truck to prove my skills? That\u2019s a problem that needs to be solved anyway, so I think it\u2019ll be convenient if we tie it up together. Mr. Denny, if you want you can follow me and check it out for yourself.\u201dEveryone continued to make absurd expressions on their faces as Oliver kept talking.\u201c\u2026Arthur, is he always like this?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was this much\u2026 Dave, I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s a bit difficult.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThe attackers are quite good. The attack happens and they escape in the blink of an eye. Already, 12 drivers have died\u2026.. This guy is the father of a family. He can\u2019t go to a place where he might die.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I can protect him.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the point dammit\u2026 Above all else, you don\u2019t have enough people to do it. You need to have at least three or four trucks to lure out the robbers, and you can\u2019t just drive them all by yourself?\u201d\u201c\u2026 .If I learn, wouldn\u2019t I be able to drive?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal. You don\u2019t understand\u2026 What about the other three?\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t Mr. Murphy, Mr. Arthur, and Mr. Denny be perfect?\u201d\u201cWhat? Me?\u201d\u201cDamn, I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d\u201cIs he really someone we can trust?\u201dAs the conversation kept circling around in a way that tired everyone mentally, Arthur desperately continued the conversation.\u201cPhew. . . God of patience, be with me\u2026 All right, I can drive, but we need manpower to fight the attackers. At least four talented people are needed. How are we going to procure this? From Hoffman\u2019s side?\u201d\u201cI think I can provide that.\u201dOliver spoke as if it was a simple matter. Then, before others could refute it, he took people outside.\u201cCan you follow me outside for a moment?\u201d\u201cWhy outside?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t show you because it\u2019s narrow inside.\u201dAs soon as everyone went outside, Oliver pulled out a glutton bag from his leather case.The glutton bag, which opened slowly, swelled up like bread dough. Seeing that Denny and Frank retreated back in fear.The glutton bag rolled its eyes and looked at Oliver.\u201d Glutton bag. Could you take it out, please\u201dReluctantly, the glutton bag began to force its hand into its mouth as soon as ordered.Because of its actions, the glutton bag\u2019s stomach rumbled and soon it started to vomit something.OhwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaOhwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaOhwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaOhwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaThe glutton bag spat out 4 corpse dolls.Everyone got startled, while Arthur mumbled as if he had noticed something.\u201cHey, is this?\u201d\u201cI took some when we cleaned the contaminated zone. I repaired the broken ones, and I forcefully put other parts in them. My skills are somewhat clumsy, so it looks a bit like that. Please understand.\u201d\u201cWere you picking them in that situation?\u201d\u201cYes, it was such a waste.\u201dWith these words, Oliver took out four test tubes that were kept separately in his pocket.There was a piece of paper attached to the test tubes, with the words First, Second, Third, and Fourth, written on them respectively.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cIt was made by imitating.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dOliver skipped the answer and opened the top of the test tubes.\u201cCome out, Children.\u201dHearing Oliver\u2019s words, First Child, Second Child, Third Child, and Fourth Child, which were similar to a minion, but definitely different, came out.Everyone shivered while looking at the alien sight, but Oliver didn\u2019t mind and ordered the four to do their part.As soon as the order was given, they approached the head of the corpse dolls and went inside the head through the hole Oliver made.At that moment, something similar to \u2018Life\u2019 began to circulate in the eyes of the corpse doll.squeak\u2026squeak\u2026Queek\u2026Queek\u2026Oliver had named them Living corpse dolls.\u201cIf manpower is the problem, each of them will do their part. What do you think?\u201dOnce again everyone went silent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhoo! Whoo!As the sun set over the horizon, three old trucks could be seen running on the highway road of District T.Thanks to Oliver\u2019s efforts, the truck drivers eventually accepted Murphy\u2019s offer.In addition, they promised to stop the strike if Oliver really caught the robbers raiding the trucks.Afterward, Murphy informed Jimmy of this and negotiated further to obtain three trucks needed to capture the robbers.Even though what they received was barely a piece of scrap metal, it was enough.The trucks ran in line, with Murphy and Oliver in the first, Arthur in the second, and Denny in the third.In fact, Oliver also learned how to drive within half a day and was able to drive a truck, but when he was about to execute the operation, Murphy and Arthur decided to get Oliver out of the driver\u2019s seat.In order to prepare for an unexpected attack, they felt that it was better for the warlock Oliver to be relatively free.Thus, Oliver was now sitting next to Murphy and watching him drive.The appearance of systematically turning the steering wheel while pressing a stick called gear felt somewhat attractive and Oliver kept looking at it while Murphy was driving.\u201cAre you still offended?\u201d asked Murphy, who was driving in his work clothes.\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m not, but it\u2019s a bit disappointing. I wanted to try driving.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Mr. Warlock has to focus on the attackers rather than driving\u2026 If it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019ll let you drive my car later.Oliver nodded his head as if he understood.Murphy, who was very confident and more ambitious, was especially wary of Oliver, who he still couldn\u2019t figure out.From Oliver\u2019s point of view, he was just a warlock who knows how to fight a little, and he found Murphy way more interesting than himself.Murphy had specific and clear goals, and although he has a sense of inferiority, he had the fighting spirit to surpass them.In addition to the friendship and compassion he had with the veterans, he also had a big plan that encompasses them.Negotiations with drivers who were on strike were also impressive.And that was why Oliver could not quite understand why he was having a hard time with him.He wondered whether it was because he was a little bit stronger.As Oliver was contemplating whether to ask about this, Murphy suddenly mumbled.\u201c\u2026. By the way, will they come? I\u2019m worried that the robbers won\u2019t come out because we suddenly decided to run the trucks. It will be difficult for us to continue doing this.\u201d\u201cPersonally, I think we would meet some truck robbers today, and what if that happens?\u201dMurphy thought for a moment before answering Oliver\u2019s question.\u201c\u2026Then, there must be a traitor in the Hoffman family.\u201dMurphy said in a calm voice, which was proof that it was within his expected range.\u201cDoes betrayal happen often in the family?\u201d\u201c\u2026. I can\u2019t say no.\u201dMurphy explained.\u201cBetrayal and power struggles are common in Crime Firm. It doesn\u2019t happen every day, but it does happen sometimes.\u201dOliver instantly remembered the days he spent in the Joseph family. It was a pretty old memory now.His master, Joseph, offered his disciples to the Demon to gain strength and talent, while Andrew, the immediate disciple, increased his followers and his influence over Joseph in the family.It felt like a cycle, where someone tried to drag the feet of another when one\u2019s survival and security were at stake.Oliver wondered whether there was such a person when he took over as the owner for a while. He wished someone like that was there.As he was thinking, he thought of Marie, Peter, and the other disciples, and wondered what they were doing now.After immersing himself in his thoughts for a while, Oliver asked Murphy.\u201c\u2026 .If there was a traitor, who would it be? In the eyes of Mr. Murphy.\u201dMurphy glanced at Oliver.\u201c\u2026 Quite a lot.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes, the former boss, Mr. James, was a wonderful man, but his son Jimmy\u2026 he\u2019s not as capable as him\u2026 If the leader cannot prove his abilities, the subordinates have no choice but to stab the back. It\u2019s like the sun rising in the east. You can\u2019t change it.\u201d\u201cUm. I see.\u201d\u201cAnd Mr. Warlock. I may sound arrogant, but I hope you don\u2019t talk like that. It\u2019s a question that can lead to bloodshed if done wrong.\u201dMurphy said, illuminating his embarrassment and concern.\u201cYes, I understand. But isn\u2019t it dangerous to answer that? Why are you answering me?\u201dAt Oliver\u2019s question, Murphy flinched as if stabbed by a valid point.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Mr. Warlock helped me a lot with this. If Mr. Warlock hadn\u2019t come forward, I\u2019d be still negotiating, or Jimmy would have been fighting with the truck drivers. It\u2019s out of my gratitude for you.\u201dMurphy lied.Of course, what he said was not a total lie, but he didn\u2019t reveal his real intentions.And Oliver did not bother asking back since it wasn\u2019t the answer he wanted to hear.But, ironically, as Oliver backed away, Murphy became impatient and opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026. I told it because it was Mr. Warlock who asked. After all, you are the Dark Horse of District T.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cLiterally what I said\u2026. The reason I\u2019m answering bluntly is that\u2026 Mr. Warlock is a very talented person who can hold against four wizards alone and does amazing things constantly. \u201dHis words were sincere.Oliver looked at Murphy without saying anything.\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you\u2019re offended by my snobbish attitude. But please understand. I\u2019m not the only one who tries to keep a friendly relationship with a talented solver.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t feel bad. I also help Mr. Murphy because of the warehouse. Everyone has their reasons\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you understand. But, I hope you still see me in a positive light.\u201d\u201c\u2026? I like Mr. Murphy, the light around you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhatever it is. Mr. Murphy\u2019s emotions are always on fire. A sense of inferiority, triumph, ambition, will\u2026 I like that.\u201dMurphy had a cryptic expression on his face as if he didn\u2019t fully understand Oliver\u2019s words, but at the same time, as if he had understood something, he pondered.After a while, he said as if he had decided on something.\u201cI may be crazy because I didn\u2019t have a coffee and I\u2019m driving at night. Mr. Warlock, I\u2019ll say it\u2026.. The reason for me doing all this\u2026 The thing is I\u2019m planning on absorbing the Hoffman family within a year.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cJimmy doesn\u2019t have full control over his family. Right before his father\u2019s death, he was more interested in drinking and fu*king bi*ches than helping the family. Thanks to that, he doesn\u2019t know everything about the organization, thus he couldn\u2019t earn the respect of the people in the family.\u201dOliver remembered the first time he saw Jimmy.He had a gun in his hand and was shouting that he would kill the drivers while being desperately stopped by those around him, whose emotions shone with disappointment and irritation.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf our Kimbell family and Hoffman family work together in earnest, our family will eventually eat from the bottom up. First, the drivers, then general members, then managers\u2026..\u201dMurphy\u2019s words were full of conviction.\u201cIf that happens, the Kimbell family will be the next-level organization in District T. This could raise my status in the Crime Firm, and I\u2019ll be able to help Mr. Warlock even more.\u201d\u201cMe? Thanks, but why are you helping me?\u201d\u201cAs I said before, Mr. Warlock is a very talented person. The reason I say this is to ask for your help in the future. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a coincidence, but Mr. Warlock plays a decisive role in every important turning point of my life.\u201dOliver looked at Murphy. He was sincere, and it also seemed that Kent\u2019s words were true.\u2013 Maintain trust with the clients and do your best in your job, then people will come to you on their ownMurphy sighed in relief as Oliver nodded his head in agreement.\u201cUgh\u2026 .. How amazing. I\u2019m not the type to talk like this easily.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah, Mr. Warlock seems to have a knack for pulling things out of people\u2026 oh my, it\u2019s time to enter the forest road. You have to be careful from here. A lot of attacks happen\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Please drive slowly.\u201dAs soon as they reached the forest road, Oliver grabbed Murphy\u2019s shoulder and said.Murphy slowed down slightly as if noticing something, and through the communicator, instructed the truck behind him to slow down as well.Oliver focused the energy on his eyes and looked ahead.He could see the emotions hidden in the forest in the distance, and there were about 30 people in total.They held their breath and waited for someone with murderous intent.\u201cMr. Warlock?\u201d\u201cKeep moving forward.\u201dMurphy drove as he was told.There was a strange tension. Soon, Oliver opened the window and took out emotions from his test tube.Those who were hiding were centered on the road in front, and everyone was looking at a particular point on the road.Oliver, who had transformed the extracted emotions into black magic, pulled his arm out the window and said:[Hat Bullet]The bullets of hatred pierced the air as fast as a machine gun.Then there was a small explosion.Bang! BOOM\u2013!\u201cland mine?!!\u201dThe one who got surprised was not just Murphy but also those in the hiding.Thanks to that, their reaction got delayed, and Oliver targeted those caught in that brief moment by throwing [Black dart] into the air.In the darkness with only the headlights of the car, the sharp ripping of the wind resounded, and then screams echoed all over the place.\u201cAwwwwwwwwwwwww-!\u201d\u201cMy shoulder! My shoulder!!\u201d\u201cWhat?! What!\u201dSome panicked people turned on the lanterns, and Oliver sniped at them like a ghost, shooting a projectile of hatred toward them.And that wasn\u2019t the end.Oliver gathered the emotions at his fingertips and remotely commanded the Children.\u201cFourth, please protect Mr. Denny and everyone else go outside.\u201dAs soon as the order was given, the Corpse dolls, which cleverly hid in the truck, began to move.First, which entered the Warlock Corpse Doll came out of the truck\u2019s luggage compartment, extracted its emotions by making a sound, and began to fire at the enemies.The screams in the darkness grew louder.Meanwhile, eight attackers armed with axes, hammers, and shotguns rushed into Denny\u2019s truck, the relatively vulnerable target.Denny\u2019s scream seemed to be heard all the way to the place where Murphy was, and at that moment, Fourth Child, who was in Denny\u2019s truck, moved.Fourth entered the swordsman Corpse doll armed with several sabers.For fun, Oliver put two additional arms around the shoulders of the Corpse doll during the repairs.Each of the arms was holding a saber, and with those arms, Fourth slashed the approaching assailants with bizarre movements that were far from humans.\u201cKyaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!\u201dSecond, which entered the sniper Corpse doll, climbed up on Arthur\u2019s truck and aimed its gun, using which it was able to hit and knock down all enemies without missing a single shot.Third, which entered the Rag Corpse doll, crawled like a cockroach, grabbed the enemies one by one, and bit them to death with its steel teeth.\u201cEwwww, what the fu*k-! What kind of monster is this\u2026! Aaaaaaaa!\u201d\u201cMax! Hey, such a ca\u2026 aaaaaaaah-!\u201d\u201cHuh, retreat. Everyone-!\u201dThere was literally a commotion, and Murphy who was watching the scene opened his eyes wide and placed both hands in his mouth as if overwhelmed by the sight in front of him.Soon after, Oliver got out of the truck and started tying up the injured truck robbers with [Vine Shadow].\u201c\u2026. What are you doing?\u201d\u201cI thought it would be good to interrogate at least once to find out who\u2019s behind them. So I\u2019m tying them up\u2026 Do you have any ropes?\u201dArthur silently held out a string with a peculiar knot.Oliver thanked him and started tying the robbers with it.It was so one-sided that Oliver felt that they were lacking something to be called the robbers who harassed a fairly large organization in District T.\u2018Or were Puppet\u2019s Corpse dolls that strong?\u2019Arthur, Denny, and Murphy got out of the car and looked around as they thought the fight was over, but at that moment\u2026\u201cI came to make some easy profit, but never heard about this in the plan.\u201d\u2026. With a rattling sound, something came flying and spread out in front of Oliver.It was the Rag Corpse doll within which Third entered.Its face was in a mess as if it had been hit hard, and it\u2019s all 12 limbs were torn off like worms.When Oliver looked ahead, a warlock as big as Arthur appeared, scattering the limbs of Third that had been torn off.He dyed his whole body with dark red energy, exuding a sense of upliftment unique to those who strengthened themselves by disease-based black magic.\u201cFu*k you bastard Hilton. You said I could earn some quick bucks, but what the hell is this?\u201d\u201cHilton?\u201d\u201cAs expected\u2026 that motherfu*ker!\u201dMurphy and Denny were furious as if they had expected Hilton would betray someday.Oliver asked the man in front of him.\u201cIs it okay to say the name like that?\u201d\u201cNah-! It\u2019s fine. After all, it would get buried along with you guys, right here\u201dWith those words, the man cast several black magic spells on himself.He seemed to have tremendous confidence in his physical abilities, and in the aftermath of the spells, his skin became darker, his muscles swelled, and his bones grew bigger.He seemed to be a disease-type warlock with considerable skills.\u201cI\u2019ll tear you in shreds and then charge that Hilton nigga\u2026 ugh!\u201dThe man felt a sharp pain and looked at his leg.Third\u2019s arm was embedded in his thigh.He was stabbed by a blade hidden in the joint of the Rag Corpse doll, and it was not a normal blade that stabbed him, it was a blade with a disease-based black magic spell [Exhaustion] cast on it.[Exhaustion] was a black magic that exhausted one\u2019s energy and dulled the body and mind. It was a basic, simple black magic, so the effect was weak, but thanks to that, it was easy to cast it in things for a long time, and there was no problem with the weak effect because that could be covered by increasing the numbers, just like right now.puck-! puck-! puck-! puck-! puck-! puck-! puck-! puck-! puck-!Blades protruded from the limbs of Rag Corpse doll, like dragonfly wings, and abruptly stabbed the man, who staggered and fell to his knees.Nevertheless, the man attempted to offset the effect of [Exhaustion] by casting additional black magic, but at that moment the fallen Third stood up and after it, the other corpse dolls also appeared one after another and surrounded the man.The man resisted, wielding his arms helplessly, and slowly fear engulfed him.First, Second, Third, and Fourth turned to Oliver and waited for permission.\u201cUuuuuu\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cAuauauauuuuu\u201d\u201cKihihihihihi\u2026\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 just eat enough so that he doesn\u2019t die.\u201dAs soon as permission was granted, the four Corpse dolls opened their mouths and brought them closer to the man.With that, a large amount of emotions and Life-force got extracted from the man\u2019s body and entered into the Corpse dolls\u2019 mouth.ShuuuuuuuuuuuShuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuShuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuShuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuThe man\u2019s muscular body dried up in real time,When Oliver ordered them to stop eating, the four Corpse dolls shut their mouths, stepped back, and bowed clumsily.Oliver approached the man who had wrinkled like dried fish and asked.\u201cAre you alive\u2026? Ah, you are alive.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Genius WarlockCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cNoooooooooooo-!!\u201dIt was the Hoffman family\u2019s office, and what was heard from the office was the loud cry of warlock Hilton, who signed an exclusive contract with the Hoffman family.As soon as he saw the evidence Murphy had brought, he denied and groaned, and soon extracted emotions in an attempt to attack, but Oliver subdued him with a [Shadow tentacle] before he could do anything.By mixing [Vine Shadow] and [Shadow Spike], Oliver was now able to both capture and attack the target at the same time.As evidence of that, Oliver\u2019s shadow tentacles pierced Hilton\u2019s arm and grabbed him by his neck, subduing him in an instant.\u201cKeuk\u2026Keuk\u2026\u201dHilton, a skilled warlock who received money in millions for a week, let out a suffocating sound.Jimmy and the members of the Hoffman family were frightened by the sightMurphy drove the momentum to persuade him, like a raging wolf.\u201cLook here, Jimmy\u2026 A list of truck timings and supplies found in the robbers\u2019 hideout. It\u2019s an insider, and the culprit is Hilton.\u201d said Murphy, holding out an additional handwritten letter with instructions for the attack.Someone muttered that it was Hilton\u2019s cursive handwriting, and Hilton denied it with a breathtaking sound.\u201c\u2026oh, oh, no. Sir, I\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with\u2026? That\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhen I questioned a robber, he said that Hilton was saying that there was no reason to stay in the family anymore, especially when he was under a young boss, he also seemed to have said that his pride won\u2019t allow it.\u201dMurphy lied.To be precise, he did not say young boss, but an incompetent bast*rd.However, Jimmy\u2019s face turned red as if he understood the meaning behind those words.He was still confused, but he almost believed it.After all, there was solid evidence in front of him.\u201c\u2026where are those fu*kers?\u201dWhen Jimmy asked, Murphy signaled outside.At the signal, Arthur grabbed three truck robbers in both hands and dragged them.He threw them down on the floor, and they were all terrified, especially looking at Oliver.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s with this guy?\u201dJimmy asked, looking at the man crumpled like a jerky.Hilton seemed to know him, too.\u201cBa, Barron. . .! Howwwwwwww\u2026!\u201d\u201cThis jerky guy told us everything. He said everything was planned by Hilton and the plan was to squeeze as much money as possible from you.\u201dAs if convinced by those words, Jimmy, whose anger reached its max, said,\u201c\u2026 Mr. Warlock.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBreak the arms and legs of this son of a b*tch.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dAlong with Oliver\u2019s answer, there was a crackling sound in the room.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u201dHilton, who was dressed in a neat suit and with a well-groomed beard, collapsed on the floor crying like a baby, and everyone watched it silently.No, everyone except for Jimmy.He held a shotgun like a club and began to strike Hilton, whose limbs were broken.The emotions of shame, betrayal, anger, and nervousness could be seen swirling around him, and he was in a state as if being cornered.The pressure of being the young boss seemed to be weighing a lot.The sound of the shotgun hitting Hilton echoed inside the room for a long time, and Jimmy stopped when Hilton\u2019s entire face and the floor was covered in red blood.\u201cHaaa. Haaa. Haaa. Lock this dog and that dog. I\u2019m going to sell them to a lab.\u201dAt Jimmy\u2019s voice filled with rage, Hoffman family members dragged Hilton along as they were told.There was a red line on the floor along the path with which they were dragged, and Oliver sensed that his work was over.Things worked out better than he thought.\u201c\u2026thank you, Murphy.\u201dJimmy lit a cigarette and said.\u201cNo, I\u2019m glad I was helpful.\u201dJimmy looked at Murphy with a subtle gaze.It was true that he was grateful, but at the same time, he was wary of Murphy.\u201c\u2026where\u2019s the hideout?\u201d\u201cYes, I checked the location, and I put some of my guys there. They\u2019ll guide you as soon as you\u2019re ready.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief\u2026Was there anything in the hideout?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s not all of them, but there were some things that they couldn\u2019t sell.\u201d\u201cWhat about money?\u201d\u201c\u2026We\u2019ve secured it. It\u2019s not a lot, but it\u2019s an amount that will reduce the damage to some extent.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cHowever, I have one thing to tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dMurphy saw Oliver and Arthur.\u201cHey, Jimmy, half of the money we found will be taken by Mr. Warlock and Arthur.\u201d\u201cWhat the\u2026 Why?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the common practice. Solvers take some of the goods or money that they capture while working. Or I should have paid them more and made a contract where they should return whatever they find during the job\u2026.. It\u2019s my fault.\u201dWhen Jimmy was about to say something, Frank and other old members of the Hoffman family stepped forward and stopped him.It was as if saying that they solved the headache for free, so you should at least pay that much for their hard work.Jimmy forced himself to accept this fact, and the job was slowly coming to an end.\u2018Now I can go back. There was a small accommodation above the warehouse. Maybe I should get ready to move there first.\u2019While Oliver was planning what to do next, someone interrupted.Suddenly Jimmy came to Oliver and spoke.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you talking to me?\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2026.. You look like a pretty good Warlock. Do you need a job?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cJust in time, we have a job available. What do you think? If you\u2019re going to work in District T, you should work with us. Why don\u2019t you join our family? I\u2019ll treat you in a way you won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201dOliver wondered what he should say. Even though the intention was good, the timing was bad.\u201cI\u2019m honored, but I\u2019ve to refuse the offer.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay with my life now. More than anything, I don\u2019t like being part of an organization.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say such a cliche, you want more mon\u2026\u201d\u201cWait a minute, Jimmy.\u201dMurphy intervened and whispered softly.As if he was persuaded by Murphy\u2019s words,\u00a0 Jimmy\u2019s emotions, which had been seething, gradually eased.\u201c\u2026Well, good. Then, I hope we can maintain a good relationship in the future.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOliver answered without putting much thought into the question, and soon after, Oliver came out of the office with Murphy and Arthur as everything came to a smooth end.It was really over, and as soon as they came out, Murphy thanked Oliver and Arthur.\u201cThank you both for your help. In particular, thank you, Mr. Warlock. I was prepared to get hurt, but everything went easier than I thought.\u201dThat was true. Things would not have ended this easily if it was not for Oliver, he destroyed the trap, attacked extensively with black darts, and after that, his Corpse dolls did everything.But Oliver denied the fact.\u201cNo, thanks to Mr. Arthur\u2019s help the negotiations went easy, and I also got a chance to test the Corpse dolls, so it wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d\u201cWell, me too. Thanks to you, I have a good additional income, so I don\u2019t have any complaints. With this, I can almost fix the cost for getting this new prosthetic arm.\u201dThe truck robbers had quite a lot of money, but it seemed like the Golem arm was quite expensive than what Oliver had initially thought. Still, it didn\u2019t seem strange because it had a complicated structure that Oliver had never seen before.\u2018Continuously flowing mana, synchronization with the user, great power.\u2026.\u2019Oliver wanted to learn about it when he had time and wondered whether there was a book about it in the bookstore.\u201cMr. Warlock, I\u2019ll complete the paperwork and hand over the payment no later than three days.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll excuse myself first. I think I\u2019ll be busy starting tomorrow. By any chance, can I give you a ride on my way?\u201dJust as Oliver was about to answer, Arthur put his hand on Oliver\u2019s shoulder and said.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, can I borrow this friend for a while?\u2026. I have something to tell him personally.\u201dMurphy looked at Arthur and then withdrew.\u201cYes, sir. Mr. Warlock, see you again next time.\u201dMurphy stepped back tactfully.Thanks to this, only Oliver and Arthur remained, and Arthur paused for a moment and reached into his arms to take out a small business card.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dOliver asked, looking at the business card. There was the word [Labor Union] engraved in block letters and under which there was an image of workers holding hands.\u201cIt\u2019s an organization where I\u2019m currently temporarily employed. It\u2019s an organization that helps the oppressed workers in this city, a little bit.\u201d\u201cDo you get paid?\u201d\u201cA little bit\u2026 I have to eat to live. Come and see me if you need work. Of course, a guy like you won\u2019t run out of jobs, but there\u2019s no law that requires you to do business with Mr. Forrest\u201d\u201cUm, I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\u201cAll right, that\u2019s enough\u2026.. And can I give you a piece of advice as a fellow Solver?\u201d\u201cYes, go ahead.\u201d\u201cThose Corpse dolls\u2026 You said you picked \u2018em up in the contaminated zone, right? And those were Puppet\u2019s Corpse dolls, weren\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cUm, I just picked up what was sprawling around, and I\u2019m not sure if Mr. Puppet was the one who made them?\u201dArthur\u2019s emotions shone with suspicion, but he didn\u2019t put them into words.\u201cWell, all right, it\u2019s none of my business. But\u2026 don\u2019t use them often in broad daylight or in crowded places. There\u2019s a high chance of getting caught by the cops because it\u2019s a human corpse. Well, people have a lot of misconceptions about Corpse dolls, so it may cause many misunderstandings\u2026 Use it moderately.\u201dArthur\u2019s words were out of pure goodwill, so Oliver thanked him.\u201cThank you for the advice.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Thanks to you, I saved my life once and now I made a good additional income. And\u2026 it\u2019s not some kind of virtue\u2026 In this field, everyone will be or at least try to be kind to a talented guy.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cVery much so. Well then that\u2019s it, see you next time.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026. It\u2019s really sad to part ways with you.\u201d said the inn hostess of the place where Oliver stayed.\u201cYou pay on time, too, and you\u2019re not particularly picky\u2026 You\u2019re a bit unusual, but you were an okay customer.\u201d\u201cThank you for saying that,\u201d replied Oliver, who finished preparing to move.Well, there wasn\u2019t much to prepare for moving, he only packed one bag at the most.\u201cI\u2019m serious. It\u2019s really unfortunate\u2026 Rosbane would be disappointed. Rosbane, come out! Mr. Dave says he\u2019s leaving now.\u201dAfter a while, Rosbane, who was engulfed in emotions such as disappointment, sadness, and regret, came out timidly.The boy, who knew about reality, tried to suppress his sadness, but it overflowed when he saw Oliver.Oliver couldn\u2019t quite understand it. He just asked him to help with a few things, and now he can read, write and do some simple arithmetic, but yet he was still relying on him.Suddenly, the image of Marie came to Oliver\u2019s mind.\u201cUh, goodbye, Teacher.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dOliver scratched his cheek.If it was normal, he would have gone back just by saying goodbye, but right now, for some reason, he wondered what Kent would have done if he was in this situation.\u201c\u2026.Yes, goodbye\u2026. I\u2019ll come by\u2026 and.. visit you once in a while.\u201dRosbane\u2019s eyes rejuvenated, and Oliver continued.\u201cThe food here is delicious.\u201d\u201cHo-ho, I\u2019m flattered. Why didn\u2019t you say this often?\u201dSuddenly the inn hostess intervened,\u201cI\u2019ll say from now on. I don\u2019t know how to cook anyway\u2026 So let\u2019s meet once in a while, Rosbane.\u201dThere was a smile on Rosabe\u2019s face, which was about to cry.\u201cAh, yes, yes! I will be waiting, Teacher.\u201dAfter saying goodbye, Oliver left for his new accommodation, the warehouse.As he thought, this seemed right. For experimenting with new black magic, and researching Corpse dolls including [Child], the warehouse felt like the best place.\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201dWhen Oliver reached the warehouse, Murphy, who was waiting at the door, welcomed him.He opened the file he was holding and held it out to Oliver.It was the formal contract for the warehouse.\u201cIf you hold it as an asset, you may be exposed, so I\u2019ll give it to you in the form of a long-term lease. Since it should look like a legitimate contract, I specified the deposit and monthly rent, but you don\u2019t have to worry about that. After all, I want to skip the contract and make it easier for you to use, but I also have a risk. Please understand.\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re right.\u201dIndeed it was. In the warehouse, Oliver will be conducting research experiments related to black magic, and if the owner\u2019s name on the document remained as Murphy, he could be in a difficult situation where he could not escape later.This consideration itself was excessive enough.Oliver flipped through the documents and signed it with a pen, in Oliver\u2019s official alias, Dave Wright.\u201cOh, you have nice handwriting. It\u2019s just like an aristocrat\u2019s.\u201d\u201cAn aristocrat?\u201d\u201cYes, they care a lot about looking cool, so they spent quite a bit of time in their life practicing handwriting. I don\u2019t mean to be sarcastic, but your handwriting is really cool. Did you practice?\u201d\u201cNo, I just wrote it like this from the beginning.\u201dMurphy squinted his eyes for a moment.\u201cWell\u2026 I see. Congratulations anyway. From now on, this warehouse will be yours.\u201d\u201cThank you very much. I\u2019m glad.\u201dOliver said so and looked at the warehouse.He really liked it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
