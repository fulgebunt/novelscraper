Wah!\u201dIn the early morning, Vincent was roused from his sleep by the sound of a baby\u2019s cry echoing through the mountain.\u201cUgh.\u201dThe sad sound of the infant continued to be heard as he ran his hands through his disheveled hair.\u201cGod, what have I done so wrong?\u201dThe hunter\u2019s muscles strained in the dark as he kicked the blanket off of the bed.\u2018Who on earth is that this early?\u2019Vincent looked at his sleeping wife, hoping she was having a good dream.If she heard that, there would have been some measure of trouble.\u201cHaah\u2026\u201cThe couple, who had been married for seven years, had no children.They had visited the clinic once with a large sum of money, but all they said was that the cause was unknown.\u2013There\u2019s a thing called compatibility in bed. It\u2019s just the way it is. Olina and you don\u2019t seem to have a problem, so keep trying. Haha!Vincent smiled through it at first.However, the situation did not improve over time. By the time they entered their fifth year of marriage, he had no choice but to admit it.He couldn\u2019t have children.His wife, Olina, didn\u2019t speak of her disappointment. But at times, she would get a lonely expression on her face. And at those times, Vincent couldn't help but be resentful towards his lower body.\u201cWhat kind of rascal is it? It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to rub salt into the wound!\u201dPutting his complicated feelings aside, Vincent left the house with his single-edged axe.\u201cWho is it?! Who\u2019s the one causing all this ruckus, at this time of the night?!\u201dHis shout echoed through the mountains.There was no response, and Vincent\u2019s expression hardened at that silence.\u2018Perhaps it\u2019s a trap?\u2019Most hunters built their houses in the mountains.This was due to the fact that they would have to check the traps they set at night early in the morning, and it sometimes became necessary for them to spend days in the mountains when they were tracking large animals.Of course, safety was his responsibility, and there were a lot of bandits looking for vulnerable prey.On the other hand, it could have been a merchant from another country. However, there was no torch in sight in the dark of the night.\u201cThat rotten\u2013! I\u2019ll cut you to pieces!\u201dIn the worst case scenario, there would be no choice but to shed blood.He slowly approached the stable the noise was coming from. Then he quickly flung open the door.The hunter\u2019s excellent vision scanned the interior.Neigh.He heard the horse whinny.Because animals do not lie, the impulsive Vincent\u2019s heart relaxed a bit.\u2018There\u2019s nowhere to hide.\u2019There was also no sign that anyone had broken in.\u201cBut, how\u2026?\u201dVincent looked at the bundle laying on the straw bed.The baby, who seemed to be about two months old, was crying with a frown on their face.Vincent hurriedly hid the axe behind his back.When he went down to kneel in front of the bundle, he threw the metal somewhere in the corner.\u201cWah! Wah!\u201dThere was a baby, as pretty as the moon.A baby who didn\u2019t know anything yet, who\u2019d just been born, and would one day spread his name around the world.At that moment, the baby saw the adult\u2019s face and stopped crying, a smile spreading across his face.Vincent\u2019s lips trembled.Then, as if he was struck by lightning, he stood up and ran out of the stables.\u201cWho is it?! Who\u2019s pulling a prank on me?! Abandoning a child! You bastard, come out!\u201dHis roar rang throughout the mountain.\u201cCome out! Really?! How can you abandon a child?! You\u2019re a monster! You know that?!\u201dThere was still no answer.\u201cYou\u2019re really abandoning the baby? I\u2019m giving you no more chances! If you show up in front of me, I\u2019ll turn your face into a rice cake!\u201dVincent shouted with all his might.He didn\u2019t want to have any regrets when he looked back on this day in the distant future.\u201cHaah. Haaah\u2026\u201dVincent, after a few moments of staring into the darkness, went back into the stable, breathing heavily.The baby was asleep, perhaps exhausted from crying.Holding the baby in trembling hands, he gently pressed his ear to the baby\u2019s little chest.\u201cOh\u2026\u201dHis heart was beating much faster than an adult\u2019s.\u201cHoney, what\u2019s going on?\u201dHis wife, who had run outside after hearing him shouting.Vincent showed her the sleeping child in his arms instead of answering.\u201cWhat\u2019s with the baby?\u201dVincent hesitated, as he wasn\u2019t sure how to explain the situation.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s our child.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen ][Proofreader \u2013 Harley ]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *It was early summer.The stream was cold and the wind was cool.With a dead water deer draped across his wide shoulders, Vincent hurried home.Rather than catching good prey, he was excited to go back to his family, waiting for him at home.\u201cShirone! Dad\u2019s home!\u201d\u201cDad!\u201dThe 12-year-old boy came running to the front door with a big smile.Unlike Vincent, who was as rugged as a rock, the boy\u2019s face was reminiscent of a specially processed jewel.His hair was as smooth as gold and his blue eyes shone from afar.Whenever he saw his pretty son, who looked like a doll, Vincent could not hide his happiness.As soon as he threw the water deer on the floor, he buried his face into his son\u2019s shoulder.\u201cYes, my precious son. How have you been? Have you been good?\u201d\u201cYes! I helped Mom cook and also read a lot of books.\u201dCooking and reading.Vincent, who felt the incongruity between the two words, was slightly perplexed but didn\u2019t show it on his face.\u201cHaha! Do you like books that much?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s just nothing to do.\u201dVincent felt sorry for his son whenever he saw him flinch, as if he had done something wrong.In fact, he knew it.He knew that this miraculous child from heaven was smarter than his peers.He read books with the letters he learned from his mom, and now he had reached the point of reading difficult books alone.\u2018And that was a little pitiful.\u2019It wasn\u2019t easy to raise enough money for hunters to educate their children.The only thing Vincent could teach him was his lifelong hunting skills.\u2013The most stable life for the son of a herbalist is to be a herbalist, and for the son of a hunter to be a hunter.Because even the most trivial job required knowledge and tricks that couldn\u2019t simply be spoken of.But Vincent couldn\u2019t bring himself to say that.\u201cNo. Good job, Shirone. No matter what you do, you have to learn to succeed. I\u2019ll buy you a book when I go into the city next time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve read the books you\u2019ve bought me, but there\u2019s nothing special or interesting about them.\u201dVincent laughed at his son\u2019s boast.Popular books were expensive, so he couldn\u2019t even think about buying one of those. So he would go around the antique shops and buy books that were used and thrown away by the nobles, which were a bit cheaper.He did guess that the content was not enough for a child to digest, anyway.\u2018What a considerate boy.\u2019Vincent was moved to tears by Shirone\u2019s thoughtfulness, who was considerate of his parent\u2019s situation.\u201cRight! Anyways, what do you think? Do you want to go cut some trees with me? It\u2019s important to learn, but you also have to have the physique and stamina. Today, dad will teach you how to chop some wood.\u201d\u201cWow! Then, are you going to be giving me an axe?\u201d\u201cOf course! Just you and me, why don\u2019t we go cut down all the trees!\u201dVincent presented Shirone with an axe, as if he had been waiting for this moment.\u2018After all\u2026 I guess he'll become a mountaineer.\u2019In any case, it was important to build some muscles in his tiny body from now on.\u2018But is it really?\u2019He had a sudden doubt.\u2018Shirone looks like a child from a wealthy family, with his soft face and hair. Maybe he was the child of a noble family?\u2019Vincent shook his head. Whenever he had such suspicions, he felt overwhelmed. He felt like he had received a precious gift, but on the other hand, he suffered from guilt.\u2018It\u2019s a useless thought. Shirone is my child. Not a child brought in from the stables, but a child who has my blood flowing through him.\u2019With a firm heart, Vincent headed for the logging area, a kilometer away from the cabin.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a demonstration, so watch carefully and follow along.\u201dVincent spat on his palm and began to chop the tree with ease.Not long after, with the sound of splitting wood the tree crashed down with a snap.Although it wasn\u2019t particularly important, a lumberjack\u2019s ability was measured according to the number of swings it took to cut down a tree.Because he was not a lumberjack, Vincent had to swing 10 times, but that alone took great skill.\u201cAfter hitting the same area several times, the tree will start to tilt and fall down, as it can\u2019t hold its own weight. Can you do it?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll try.\u201dAs Vincent picked out a tree for Shirone, he started to copy what his dad did by spitting on his hand.Even though he only saw it once, his positioning, posture, and even the way he rubbed his palms was a spitting image of his dad.Just as expected of Shirone, who was especially intelligent. Vincent watched his son in satisfaction.But as Shirone raised his axe high, it was a bit sloppy.\u2018It\u2019s not something you can do with intelligence alone.\u2019While the weight of the axe was considerable, muscle strength was essential when cutting down a tree.\u2018He needs to start training himself, so that he can get married and have children later in life.\u2019No woman would want to marry a guy who couldn\u2019t make money.\u201cEek! Eck!\u201dShirone clenched his teeth and swung, but every time he missed and hit somewhere different.Vincent gave some tips.\u201cDon't use up all your strength. Instead, try to decrease your power and replace it with accuracy.\u201dHowever, no matter how much he continued to aim and hit, there was no sign of the tree being cut down.\u2018Is my son really this weak?\u2019Vincent was a little sullen.\u201cPhew, it\u2019s hard.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. No, I\u2019m sorry. To be honest, I know you are not fit to be doing a job like this. However, being a hunter\u2019s son, there is no choice\u2026\u201dVincent was choked up.\u201cYou\u2019re a really smart boy. More than the herbalist\u2019s son, Barone, or the fruit seller\u2019s daughter, Stella. You are smarter than them all. Don\u2019t get rattled just because you lack physical strength. My greed for you\u2026\u201dTears began to gather in Vincent\u2019s eyes.However, Shirone, who was busy with other thoughts, spoke without care.\u201cMore importantly, Dad, how can I cut down trees well?\u201dVincent was slightly embarrassed.He was also surprised. His son, who he had assumed would have no interest, was intent on cutting down trees well.\u201cYou really want to try and learn?\u201d\u201cYes, teach me. It\u2019s fun.\u201dVincent, who was encouraged by his son\u2019s words, led Shirone to the dent of the tree he made.\u201cAlright, look at this. Strength will work when you become an adult, but this doesn\u2019t really require much power. It\u2019s the tricks that count. I told you to hit the same spot earlier, but if you tilt the angle a little bit and hit around the spot you aimed before, you will be able to cut down the tree easier.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201dVincent finally looked at the dent his son had made, away from the spot he was supposed to hit.\u2018This is\u2026\u2019It was quite surprising.It was hard to look at it and think that it was done by a beginner, as the blade had been driven into the same exact spot, over and over.If this continued, it would have been more difficult to knock down the tree without brute strength being used. The trick to easily cut down a tree was to hit around the target spot, instead of aiming at the same place repeatedly. Because of Shirone\u2019s frightening accuracy, it would have been impossible for his current self to cut it down.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI\u2019ll try again.\u201dVincent stepped back, but Shirone remained motionless and observed the dented spot on the tree.Vincent, who briefly thought he might just be goofing off, shook his head to dismiss the thought.\u2018He\u2019s not the kind of kid who would play cheap tricks on his parents.\u2019He waited, holding back his impatience, but Shirone made no move to continue.\u2018What in the world is he looking at? When it comes to chopping down trees, using your body instead of your head is much more important. Come on, pick up the axe, Shirone. You just have to hit the tree as hard as you can.\u2019Contrary to Vincent\u2019s restlessness, Shirone felt a light tremor travel through his body.\u201cI see.\u201dHit the same spot, but with a slight twist to the angle.It was complicated to explain the principles, but it was probably one of the oldest realizations in human history.And that realization was evolving into a more powerful form in Shirone\u2019s understanding.\u2018I think it\u2019ll work. Hit here, like this.\u2019Finally, Shirone pointed to the base of the tree, where he made the dent.\u201cDad.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cShould I break it in one hit?\u201d\u201cHahaha! You\u2019re not even halfway through yet. Do you think it\u2019ll break with one swing?\u201d\u201cWith a bit of luck, who knows? It might work.\u201dOf course, an experienced lumberjack could break a tree in only a few hits by targeting the vulnerable part of the tree.\u201cAlright! Let\u2019s trust my son\u2019s luck!\u201dRegardless, Vincent went along with whatever his son had in mind.That was because he was proud of Shirone\u2019s ambition, regardless of whether he did it right or wrong.\u201cIf I break this, please grant me a wish.\u201d\u201cA wish?\u201dVincent was anxious.\u2018What if he says that he wants to study? What if he asks me to send him to an academy like the nobles?\u201d\u201cTake me to the city with you this time.\u201dTo be honest, his request frightened Vincent out of his wits. However, he didn\u2019t reveal it in his expression and laughed back.\u201cIf it\u2019s just that, then that\u2019s not too hard! I\u2019ll grant this wish of yours!\u201dShirone smiled while holding up his axe.Then, after a while, the smile disappeared from his lips. Vincent felt a little appalled.The sight of Shirone staring at the tree was eerie. It seemed as if he was looking at something only he could see.The axe swung.This time, although he aimed exactly where the previous dent was located, there was a slight alteration that normal humans would not be able to discern.Craacck!Vincent\u2019s eyes widened as a sound resembling thunder rang out.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026?\u201dFissures appeared in the place the axe was struck. The tree, unable to handle the weight, fell.\u201cYay! I did it!\u201dVincent couldn\u2019t believe it.What Shirone succeeded in doing was called a \u2018Thunder Strike\u2019, which was considered a legend among lumberjacks.\u2018It\u2019s a skill that even I succeed in performing only once in a blue moon or so, and by luck, that is.\u2019There must have been a weak or a vital spot.A very small probability, one that existed with variables such as shape, weight, or formation deficiency.Most lumberjacks experienced it once, but to do it consciously would be like a dream come true.It\u2019s not like you had to cut down a tree that way, but if you swing your axe with that thought in mind, expecting and hoping for something, you\u2019d only get tired and give up.It was different from the world of swordsmen, where they focused on the importance of swinging technique.Vincent didn\u2019t know the details, but it was a phenomenon that had already been studied amongst them. Even so, beginners among those swordmasters could not even think of attempting something like this.\u201cI did it! I did it!\u201dShirone was more delighted to be able to enter the city than about what he\u2019d done.\u201cDad! You have to keep your promise, okay?\u201dVincent\u2019s mind, while staring blankly at his son jumping up and down, became conflicted.\u2018What do I do?\u2019He felt lost at sea, unable to figure out whether he should be raising this child as a lumberjack or not.* * *The cart crossed the city gate.As Vincent grabbed the reins, Shirone was sitting in the luggage compartment, eyes sparkling in excitement.\u2018It been so long.\u2019Just looking at the number of people passing by on the street made his heart race.\u2018We still have a lot of time.\u2019The luggage compartment where Shirone was seated was filled with materials and resources from the mountains.Leathers for weapon stores, meat for the market, and intestines for herbalists or magic shops.The road was quite long, and they would have to sell and haggle over their goods. That would take a good 4 hours.When Vincent arrived at the market, he took a bag of meat and looked at Shirone.\u201cYou have to come back before sunset.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve memorized all the roads.\u201d\u201cOnly walk on the main roads. Don\u2019t go wandering into secluded places. If someone comes and asks why you\u2019re alone, point to the nearest store and say you\u2019re waiting for your dad.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Plus, nothing happened the last time I came here.\u201dVincent was heart-stricken because it seemed like he was neglecting his son, but it was inevitable because his family\u2019s livelihood was at stake. Their bargain would have to do, for now.The first place Shirone found himself, once he stepped outside of the shopping district, was the largest library in Creas.The boy\u2019s heart, looking up at the huge and magnificent building, began to beat fast.\u2018Knowledge.\u2019Did that place hold all the knowledge written down since the beginning of history?The way to satisfy one\u2019s curiosity was to take a look at it for yourself, but access was prohibited to everyone except for nobles.Two girls came out with a book in their arms, and Shirone hurriedly stepped aside.\u2018They\u2019re nobles.\u2019There were wicked people everywhere in the world, and among the nobles, good people existed as well.However, when speaking about nobles, Vincent always spoke as if they were the same type of threat as goblins.\u2014Never oppose them or speak out of turn.The nobles had money and power that could easily crush the lives of a commoner\u2019s family.\u2018They could. But\u2026\u2019Shirone looked back at the schoolgirls, who walked past him indifferently.\u2018I just want to read a book.\u2019With a little bit of obstinance and eagerness, he followed the two towards the aristocratic area.\u2018What kind of life are they living?\u2019However, that initial thought was overwhelmed by the aristocratic energy of the buildings. He couldn\u2019t raise his head.\u2018This was built for people to live in?\u2019Among them, the best academy was as large as several mountains combined.Shirone stopped walking and read the antique inscription on the arch of the main gate.Alpheas Magic Academy.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u2018Magic\u2019That one word was the only word that Shirone could not perfectly understand.That was because, although that term was mentioned in numerous books, none could accurately describe the principles.Unless you were a mage, explaining the workings of magic was futile. You\u2019d only be seen as an arrogant being who thought they knew everything.\u201cWhat the\u2026?! You, who are you?\u201dIt was the security guard guarding the gate that shouted.Shirone\u2019s shabby clothes were at fault, as they stood out more since this was an aristocratic district.\u201cGo back! This is no place for a kid like you.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dShirone ran away in a hurry, but no matter how much he ran, the wall did not end, which led Shirone to stop.\u2018How wide is this thing?\u2019Just then, an old man\u2019s voice was heard over the wall.\u201cWell, let\u2019s talk about what magic is today.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to! Show us magic. Show us one more!\u201d\u201cFire! The one with fire, headmaster!\u201dShirone stared at the wall.Spotting the beautiful tree peeking from the top of the wall, Shirone realized that the headmaster seemed to be teaching under the shade.The voices sounded young.Of course, that wasn\u2019t strange, since nobles were taught from the moment they were born.\u201cHohoho, we\u2019ll get in trouble if we start a fire in our academy. Instead, if you get this question right, I\u2019ll show you a fun magic trick.\u201d\u201cYay! What\u2019s the question? Hurry up and quiz us!\u201dCurious, Shirone listened.\u201cWhat talent do you need the most when learning magic?\u201dThere was a pause.It was quite a subjective question in Shirone\u2019s opinion, but those children were recognized for their magical talents. They came up with answers, one after another.\u201cEffort. Magic is so extensive that you won\u2019t be able to learn everything, even if you study your whole life. So effort is important.\u201dIn addition, there were other plausible answers\u2014such as concentration and memory, but none really reached the headmaster.He was probably harboring a smile of recognition.\u201cMoney. You would need to buy a lot of stuff in order to learn magic.\u201dThe children burst into laughter, and the headmaster\u2019s laughter was also mixed in.\u2018If it\u2019s neither effort, knowledge, nor money\u2026 Then what talent do you need the most to learn magic?\u2019At last the headmaster spoke.\u201cThe most important talent for learning magic is perspicacity. This is more simply known as insight.\u201dA second pause.\u201cWhat is an \u2018insight\u2019?\u201dThe headmaster made a groaning sound, but soon explained with a kind tone of voice.\u201cInsight is more accurate than knowledge, and faster than effort.\u201d\u201cWoah! Then that\u2019s like, the greatest magic.\u201d\u201cHaha! I guess it could be seen that way. No, you\u2019re right. All magic that exists in the world began with insight. Let me give you an example. Do you know what one plus one is?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s two.\u201dThe children answered in unison, as if they were wondering how he could ask such a question.\u201cI see. Can you explain why one plus one equals 2?\u201d\u201cHuh? Of course\u2026\u201dThe children said nothing.They couldn\u2019t figure out where to start, what to explain, and how to explain it.Alpheas smiled.\u201cThat strange feeling you feel now is \u2018insight\u2019. Long ago, there was a time when you didn\u2019t know that one plus one equals two. But it\u2019s been verified with a lot of knowledge and effort combined. But don\u2019t you guys understand perfectly that one plus one equals two, without going through that process?\u201dShirone slowly immersed himself in the story.\u201cMagic is a phenomenon that exists from scratch. Like the way that you know the answer is two, even when you didn\u2019t know that one plus one equals two. The way someone puts effort and knowledge to figure it out, and the way someone, like you guys, comes to understand and realize it naturally. As such, insight is the quickest way to understand certain rules.\u201d\u201cSo that means we don\u2019t have to study or try?\u201d\u201cHohoho, is that so? Does it end up being like that? But to be honest\u2026 that\u2019s the truth.\u201dIt\u2019s normal for common sense to be to one\u2019s liking, but in some cases, it is common sense because it\u2019s easy to understand.Shirone could guess the pressure the headmaster was feeling while speaking of this cruel reality.\u201cInsight is not something you can acquire with a flick of a finger. The reason why one plus one is two is because scholars have verified it over many years. Of course, there are cases where someone might realize the correct answer without going through such a process. I would call those people geniuses.\u201d\u201cMy mom said I\u2019m a genius.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not wrong. Every human being is born with talent, and if they sharpen that talent of theirs, anyone can be a genius.\u201dThe moment he heard that, a lump formed in Shirone\u2019s throat. He felt overwhelmed.\u2014Anyone can be a genius.But, was that really true?Would he be given the opportunity to climb over that far-off wall?\u201cYes. There, the one standing behind the wall. I\u2019d like to hear what you think.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShirone jumped back in surprise.\u2018Wh-What should I do?\u201d\u2018Should I run away, or should I answer? No. Do I, a commoner, even have the right to answer?\u2019Alpheas continued.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to panic. Come over here. I would like to see your face.\u201dShirone, who continued to question himself, walked to the wall as if possessed.If he didn't cross that wall right then, he felt like he would never be able to cross it.As Shirone climbed the wall, he saw a white-haired, elderly man who would look quite common on the street.In truth, he was a certified Grade 4 mage, recognized by the kingdom. He was well known in other countries for his high virtue.Alpheas, sitting on a rock, waved.\u201cCome. Are you here to be my friend?\u201dHaving gained confidence from his kindness, Shirone jumped over the wall and entered the academy.Under the shade of the tree, children around Shirone\u2019s age sat in a circle.One child frowned.\u201cHeadmaster, he\u2019s not a nobleman. I think he\u2019s a commoner.\u201d\u201cHuh? Really? Commoners aren\u2019t allowed here. Hey, get out of here!\u201dAlpheas looked puzzled for a moment, as if he was expecting someone who was of noble status, but soon spoke warmly.\u201cIt\u2019s all right, come this way. So, what part of this old man\u2019s words drew your heart?\u201dShirone hesitated.He wanted to get closer to Alpheas, but the eyes of the children were preventing him from doing so.\u201cShow me magic.\u201d\u201cHoho, have you never seen magic?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve read about it in books, but I\u2019ve never seen it in person.\u201dA child pointed his finger at Shirone.\u201cAs if! What kind of commoner can read?When Alpheas looked into Shirone\u2019s eyes, it certainly didn\u2019t seem to be a lie.However, it was the nature of children of that age to deceive adults.\u201cOkay. What kind of magic do you want to see?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t care. Anything is fine, so show me. Please.\u201dShirone realized his situation, so he lowered his head. Then Alpheas waved his hand and laughed.\u201cThis old man\u2019s one and only joy is to show his magic to his honey buns. Alright! Then this time, I\u2019ll show you magic that creates wind.\u201d\u201cWooaah! It\u2019s wind, wind!While the children clapped their hands in awe, Shirone clenched his fist in tension.\u2018Wind? How can I\u2026?\u2019In that instant, when Alpheas raised his hand, Shirone\u2019s eyes opened wide in shock.\u201cWhoa!\u201dThe weight of his body disappeared and flew up to a height of more than 20 meters.The numerous buildings of the magic academy, and the mountain ranges that were situated beyond it, were noticeable with a glance.\u201cAHHHH!\u201dScreaming broke out as a matter of course, but the other children were enjoying it while cartwheeling around the sky.After a while, the children start to drop, one by one.The speed of the drop was so great that Shirone closed his eyes tightly at the sight of the fast approaching ground.\u201cWha\u2013?\u201dThere was none of the impact Shirone was expecting.Feeling strange, Shirone opened his eyes slowly and saw that his body was floating a little above the ground.When the children burst into laughter at the sight of Shirone, Alpheas also laughed mischievously.\u201cWhat do you say? This is magic.\u201dOf course he was kind at times, but he wasn\u2019t boring enough to not enjoy the child\u2019s reaction.That may be why he came on a bit stronger than usual, but Shirone could not answer him.The beating of his heart was all he heard.\u2018This\u2026 is magic.\u2019This sensation he experienced for the first time in his life was completely beyond the nebulous boy\u2019s fantasy.Shirone, once he came to his senses, spoke.\u201cWhat is magic?\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s see. Magic is\u2026\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t understand. Please tell me the truth.\u201dThe children\u2019s expressions hardened.Even though they were young, they knew what position Alpheas had in the magical world. Therefore, even the children of the prominent noble families laid low and acted like obedient children in front of him.\u2018Our teachers can\u2019t say things like that to him.\u2019Alpheas also thought it was bold at first, but after a while, he changed his opinion.\u2018He\u2019s a smart kid.\u2019He was not trying to understand things right away.\u2018I know what kind of opportunity I have right now. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not trying to understand it easily, at an elementary level. I would rather have difficult, but accurate information so that I can study it myself!\u2019If he hadn\u2019t had an education on magic before this, then this child\u2019s judgment had to be excellent.\u2018But really? Does he believe he can do it alone?\u2019So far, Alpheas, who was deep in thought, looked at Shirone with a different look from before.He was tense, as if his life was on the line.\u201cHaha! Listen comfortably, it\u2019s not a difficult thing to understand. But if you would like, I can raise the difficulty a bit. Magic is something that deviates from common sense. In other words, it\u2019s the mental process of exploring the truth of a phenomenon.\u201dShirone was engrossed in thought.\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand, you can just say so.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s not an easy phenomenon to explain, but you\u2019re saying that is the truth?\u201dAlpheas blinked.\u201cWhere did you learn that?\u201d\u201cOh, well, in a book.\u201d\u201cThere was a book with content like that?\u201d\u201cNo, I just thought about why books are used. Even if someone goes out their way to write down something that everyone knows, no one would bother looking at it. Truth is something that is different from the common sense we normally know, that\u2019s probably the reason why books are written and are read.\u201d\u2018Anyone can memorize and recite. However, understanding the concept of a book requires an inherent characteristic\u2026 insight. Is he really a commoner? What a shame!\u2019Looking at his appearance, it was highly likely that the commoner was from the lowest of the low, living outside the city.Shirone asked another question.\u201cHow can I learn magic? Does it require special powers?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what special powers you\u2019re talking about, but it does take a lot of mental strength.\u201dIt was an unexpectedly lackluster answer.\u201cThat\u2019s really it? Does that mean you can fly in the sky when you think of the wind?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s difficult to answer. But to add a little exaggeration, yes. Of course, it\u2019s not just ordinary thoughts. The mage\u2019s consciousness must coincide with the world. An extremely sensitive state of mind, for instance.\u201dAlpheas\u2019 serious expression prevented the children from intervening.\u201cWhat is a sensitive state of mind?\u201dAlpheas smiled.\u2018This isn\u2019t curiosity. He\u2019s really planning on learning magic!\u2019On the contrary, it was concerning.\u2018It\u2019s unfortunate, but he\u2019s a commoner. He won\u2019t be able to get a formal education. If I were to encourage him further, he would only be more dejected later on.\u2019Alpheas looked back at the students, with the intention of cutting off the flow of the conversation before it went any deeper.\u201cWhen a mage focuses, his mind becomes sensitive enough to sense everything around him. Mages call this as entering the Spirit Zone. I\u2019ll show you a demonstration, so watch what this child does. Shuamin, would you like to enter the Spirit Zone?\u201d\u201cYes, headmaster.\u201dA girl with braids answered confidently.It was natural for them to show off their skills, because they were born with extraordinary talents.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Harley]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Shuamin closed her eyes and the other children created a reverent atmosphere on their own.As if such an attitude proved their own superiority.\u201cI entered the Zone.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s get started.\u201dAlpheas, who took out a coin, shook it in his hand. Suddenly, he clenched his hand and held it out.\u201cNow, how many coins are in my hand?\u201d\u201cSix.\u201dWhen he opened his hand, there were exactly six silver coins.Alpheas repeated it for a second time as Shirone watched with a surprised look.\u201cThree.\u201dOnce again, that was the correct answer.After that, Alpheas tried a few more times, but the result was the same.\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Shuamin, you did a great job.\u201d\u201cHaaah.\u201dShuamin let out a long breath.The only thing she did was guess the number of coins, but her forehead was covered in cold sweat.Alpheas looked back at Shirone.\u201cThat, right there, was an example of an extremely sensitive state of mind. The moment they enter the Spirit Zone, a mage can perceive the outside world with extrasensory perception. Excellent mages can even guess the number of leaves at a long distance. Of course, the skill Shuamin showed us was great, too.\u201dShirone, who succeeded in performing the \u2018Thunder Strike' by relying on his senses, could vaguely feel and understand it.\u2018She wasn\u2019t counting the number of coins!\u2019She was sensing the totality of the primitive data that existed long before that.To sense the entire state of affairs in front of you\u2026It was not an empty assertion to say that a master of the Spirit Zone could guess the number of leaves from far away.Then a question naturally followed.\u201cCan I as well\u2026 No, perhaps I can\u2019t?\u201dAlpheas replied.\u201cAnyone can do it.\u201dThe Spirit Zone could be reached by anyone, but also at the same time, not just anyone could achieve it.The grand total of constant effort and talent to test human limitations\u2026 That was magic.\u201cPractice in a quiet place. You first have to feel yourself, and then dismiss it. If that happens, a different world will unfold. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dShirone understood.\u201cIf you don\u2019t feel yourself, it will be impossible to erase yourself.\u201dAlpheas couldn\u2019t help but admire him again. That was not an insight that a 12-year-old could easily put forward.Two cases occurred to him.Either he was a natural talent, or a mischievous acquaintance of Alpheas sent the kid to pull a prank on him.\u201cWould you like to give it a try? Here.\u201dThere was no reason to refuse, so Shirone nodded without hesitation and closed his eyes.\u2018Recall back to the \u2018Thunder Strike\u2019 incident.\u2019Except when he started to focus, it was on another level from back when he was trying to find the vital spot hidden in the grooves.How much do we know about ourselves?\u2018Who am I?\u2019Shirone realized for the first time how difficult it was to clearly define himself.\u2018I was mistaken!\u2019\u2018There is just too much of me to delineate, and none of it is accurate.\u2019\u2018Me. What actually am I?\u2019At that moment, Shirone felt a very simple truth springing up like a fish.An extremely sensitive state of mind.Alpheas\u2019 previous claim was frighteningly accurate.\u2018Brain.\u2019It\u2019s not an organ of the body.\u2018I\u2026 I don\u2019t know the world beyond the brain.\u2019The concept of the brain.The truth was that all the senses and realities he accepted were actually arbitrary.\u2018There\u2019s no need to define it. Just feel it. It\u2019s not that my existence gets sensitive\u2026\u2019Only a keen mind would remain.Instead of trying to define it, Shirone erased everything he thought was \u2018himself\u2019.Because if you erase it like that, eventually there would be nothing left.And finally.\u2018.......\u2019Even Shirone\u2019s thoughts disappeared.At one point, Shirone\u2019s eyes opened wide.\u201cHaah. Haah.\u201dThe scene in front of him was peaceful.The children were yawning in boredom and Shuamin was playing with her hair.Shirone did not notice that 10 minutes had already passed.Alpheas wasn\u2019t expecting much.He acknowledged the concentration that lasted 10 minutes, but that was not enough to succeed.\u201cYes, I heard it.\u201dAlpheas raised his eyebrows at the unexpected answer.\u201cOh, what did you hear?\u201d\u201cSounds. I heard everything.\u201d\u201cHoho, I see.\u201dAlpheas nodded as if he was expecting that result.\u2018As expected, it\u2019s not possible!\u2019It seemed like his senses had become extra sensitive, but the things that happen in the Spirit Zone were different.First, you experienced synesthesia.From sound, you could smell. From light, you could taste. And from the shape of the landscape, you could feel it touch your skin.\u2018That\u2019s too bad. He was talented.\u2019If he was a noble, wouldn\u2019t he have achieved something similar to the children here if he was trained from an early age?\u2019Of course, that alone wouldn\u2019t have caught Alpheas\u2019 eyes.That was because there were many children in the world who had superior skills to those of the children there.\u201cWell done. If you practice hard in the future, you\u2019ll be able to hear more.\u201dAlthough reaching the Spirit Zone was not successful, that concentration training would be of help in the child\u2019s life.\u201cWell, that\u2019s the end of the special class today. You all go back, too.\u201dWhen Alpheas walked away with the children, Shirone jumped over the wall without delay.He was feeling disappointed in Alpheas.He was trying to be considerate when he walked away first.\u201cHaah. Haah.\u201dShirone, who crossed the wall, sat on the floor and breathed heavily.His heart beat to the point that it started to hurt.\u201cIt really worked. It really did.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe had heard a huge sound.Maybe it wasn\u2019t a sound, but Shirone couldn\u2019t think of any other way to express it.It felt like a mouth was attached to every object around the world and had conveyed something to Shirone. All the sounds came together and eventually became one.\u2018I\u2019m not who I thought I was.\u2019It was the world itself.As he was recalling what the world had conveyed to him, one enormous truth hit his head.\u2018I\u2019m Infinite.\u2019\u201cHeuk. Huk.\u201dShirone, who was immensely moved, closed his eyes and dashed off.He needed to run.Despite being trapped in his earthly body again, his mind still remembered what it was like being in the Spirit Zone.\u2018I\u2019m free.\u2019\u2018How much time has passed?\u2019Shrine, who wasn\u2019t paying attention to his surroundings, suddenly felt something impact his face.\u201cUrgh!\u201dWhen he fell on his back, he looked around and saw a sickening scene in an alley.\u2018How did I get here?\u2019He was so affected by his emotions that he couldn\u2019t remember what happened a while back, but now reality had woken him up.\u201cWhat the hell?! So annoying.\u201dA group of tramps were staring at Shirone, eyeing him like how a predator would eye prey.The guy pushed by Shirone grabbed him by the collar.\u201cHey, you! Are you crazy?\u201d\u201cS-Sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2018Sorry\u2019 doesn\u2019t cut it! Be honest, you were sent by the Wolf Gang to humiliate me, weren\u2019t you?!\u201d\u201cNo! I wasn't!\u201dThey noticed through Shirone\u2019s eyes that he was a kid who didn\u2019t even seem to have the courage to hit a person, let alone use a knife.All that was left was to go through his pockets, but they didn\u2019t think he would even have a dime with that attire of his.\u2018Even so, with that face of his, he could be sold for quite a lot of money.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s one of the lower commoners out there\u2026 That\u2019s even better! I won\u2019t have to take responsibility for anything that happens!\u2019While engrossed in their thoughts, a woman\u2019s voice was heard outside the alley.\u201cWhat are you guys doing? Did something fun happen?\u201dThe men all turned at the same time.\u201cMiss Amy!\u201dShirone looked at Amy as if he had met his savior.\u2018So young!\u2019She had red-colored bangs covering one eye. She also seemed to be a girl of his age.\u201cHehe, what brought you here? Are you bored again?\u201dHe talked in a light tone, but the hands of the man approaching Amy were modestly clamped together.It was a natural behavior for those who knew her identity.Amy Karmis.She was part of the Karmis family, a family labeled to be just below the royal family in terms of hierarchy. They were the 1st-ranked nobility.It was out of the ordinary for the youngest daughter of such a family to hang out with tramps, but for the adolescent girl who was tired of living, being defiant was her only joy in life.\u201cThis kid tried to kill someone, so we\u2019re just trying to teach him some lessons.\u201d\u201cN-No! I bumped into him without realizing it.\u201d\u201cHa! As if! You want me to believe that?\u201dWhen the burly man raised his foot to kick Shirone\u2019s stomach, Shirone curled up in panic.\u201cUgh.\u201d\u201cYou got to compensate, boy! Where\u2019s your mom? I said go get her!\u201dShirone was shocked.Don\u2019t they have parents as well? How could they curse the parents of other people like that?\u201cThe look in your eyes has changed. Are you upset?\u201dThe tramps who noticed the anger in Shirone rushed in and started beating him down.\u201cStop it. You\u2019ll hurt him too much.\u201dAs soon as the tramps backed away, she jumped down from the wooden box and approached Shirone.\u201cYou okay?\u201d\u201cI-I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cNobody said anything. I\u2019m asking if you\u2019re okay.\u201dAmy stared at Shirone\u2019s face.\u2018Don\u2019t make such a face with just that. It\u2019s as if someone just kicked your puppy. I\u2019ve lived a much harder life than you!\u2019In the eyes of others, being the only daughter of the Karmis family would seem like a privilege.\u2018I\u2019ve lived a harder life than you. I worked my ass off to get to where I am today, so why must I sympathize with you?\u2019It was also her who conquered the tramps in this back alley, where all kinds of crimes were prevalent.Even if it was a childish thought, the story changes depending on one\u2019s status.Amy turned her head to the tramps.\u201cWhat are you going to do now? Do you have anything more interesting in mind?\u201dShirone, who thought he was going to be let go, was surprised.On the other hand, the tramps, who knew of Amy\u2019s bad temper, spoke calmly.\u201cWe were planning on just checking for money then selling him away to a brothel after.\u201dAmy smirked.Of course, she had no intention of going through with what the backstreet tramps were planning to do.She was planning on moderately bullying him then sending him home.\u201cHmm.\u201dAmy, who was carefully examining Shirone\u2019s appearance, came up with a sadistic prank.\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any defects on a male prostitute. Why don\u2019t you take off your clothes so we can check for any?\u201dShe was actually a bit curious about him, and considering the fact that Shirone was a lowly commoner, she wouldn\u2019t have to take any responsibility.\u2018And to be honest, he has the looks.\u2019His looks were certainly decent.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cTake it off. Who knows? If you do as I say, I might let you go.\u201dShirone was absent-minded.He couldn\u2019t believe this was happening to him. These so-called humans in front of him looked like demons in his eyes.\u201cHow could you? That\u2019s a really bad thing to do.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know? This is how the world runs. After all, you\u2019re just labeled as a victim because you\u2019re being harassed. Whether it\u2019s this or that, it\u2019s all the same for weaklings. Everyone only cares about themselves.\u201dThe leader of the tramps snorted.Because if you were to blame the world, you\u2019d feel like you\u2019ve become an adult, you\u2019d feel like you\u2019ve outsmarted others.\u2018You\u2019re wrong, you immature girl!\u2019\u2018You talk about artifice when you haven\u2019t seen nothing. You talk about pain, yet you haven't experienced true pain.\u2019\u2018You don\u2019t know anything.\u2019\u2018Life lasts much longer than you think.\u2019\u201cHey! She told you to take off your clothes! You wanna get beat up again?\u201dAt some point, Amy began to feel a little uneasy at the unresponsive sight of Shirone.\u2018Did he go crazy?\u2019However, Shirone didn\u2019t go mad.Rather, he was focused on the changes in his brain more than ever before.He entered the Spirit Zone as his strained mentality became extremely sensitive to the violence he experienced for the first time.\u2018This is\u2026?\u2019It was definitely different from the first time he experienced it. This second time he experienced it, he was levelheaded enough to understand the information flooding his mind.He could almost hear eyes blinking.With the boundary between himself and the outside world torn down, Shirone sent his consciousness along the instinctive path.The place his consciousness ended up in was at the memory of Alpheas teaching magic at the magic academy.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHis insight began to collect superficial information about Alpheas\u2019s emotions, senses, mind, actions, demeanor, and attitude.The information was combined in a limitless pattern that went on forever. And eventually, the essential information was brought into Shirone\u2019s consciousness.\u201cHey! Quickly get out of your clothes! The miss says she wants to see!\u201dAs the tramp grabbed him by the collar and shook him, Shirone almost got thrown out of the zone.The Spirit Zone, which required high concentration to enter and maintain, was vulnerable to outside influence.The danger was comparable to someone shaking the tightrope you were walking on.Amy shouted as she detected the change in Shirone\u2019s eyes.\u201cWait! Wait a minute!\u201dHowever, it was already too late. Shirone\u2019s will strongly distorted nature.\u201cBOOOM!\u201dAs the ferocity of the winds rose, all the physical things in the alley came to mind.The wooden crates, the pebbles on the street, the thugs, and Amy, were no exception.\u201cAHHHHH!\u201dThe scream brought Shirone to his senses.A desolated empty alleyway appeared before him as things began to drop from the sky.Thud! Thud! Thud Thud! Thud!The heavy sound that gave Shirone goosebumps drummed the ground.As gravity was a familiar thing, it was often overlooked. But the force called gravity was a much more powerful force than most people of this time could imagine.The tramps who fell on their limbs, hoping to use them to survive the fall, experienced first-hand the pain of fractured limbs.\u201cAuughhhh\u2026\u201d\u201cM-My arm\u2026 My leg\u2026\u201dTheir legs were grotesquely bent and the bones of their forearms pierced through their skin.Shirone was taken aback.He didn\u2019t expect to produce such a disastrous result.Meanwhile, the only person who had their body intact and in good health was Amy.Nobles have their bodies honed from infancy, so it goes without saying that 1st-class nobles were the best skill-wise.Amy, who came down while holding her fluttering skirt, turned to Shirone with dumbfounded eyes.\u201cYou\u2026 Who in the world are you?\u201dThe scene created by Shirone a while ago clearly showed why mages were existences to be feared.Even Amy, who often boasted about her unique athletic body, could not resist against the brief appearance of a whirlwind.\u201cAnswer me! Where did you learn that magic?! How could a commoner\u2026!\u201dAmy stopped talking.The guards came running to the site after hearing the screams in the alley.Amy clicked her tongue because she knew her family. If she were to get caught, they wouldn\u2019t let this one go.\u201cTsk.\u201dShe stepped on the building, leaping and zig zagging up the walls.Shirone, who had been staring blankly at those impressive, inhumane movements, quickly snapped back to reality.\u2018I\u2019m in trouble.\u2019If the guards saw him here, they would interrogate him about what exactly had happened here.\u2018Dad!\u2019Shirone realized on that day in the city\u2026 That the world was cruel to the weak.\u2018No one would believe me!\u2019Shirone turned away and frantically ran towards the only person who he could trust.* * *The Karmis Family.A 1st-class powerhouse of the kingdom.Although they were not nobility from the capital, the outstanding individuals produced by the family spread throughout Thormia.The only Karmis\u2019s now left in their estate were Lord Shakora, the family leader who had retired, and Amy.\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d\u201cWhere have you been? I heard you skipped your training again.\u201dAlthough he was over 60 years old, he had the visage of a man in his prime.He was tall, had intelligent looks, and wore glasses. Yet despite the scholarly look, knowing he was the best in the kingdom, he could not hide his pride.\u201cI\u2019ve learned everything I needed to learn. It\u2019s not even fun.\u201d\u201cSo you played around with the tramps? No matter how much of a tramp you think you are, if you continue with that attitude of yours, kids of your age will end up catching up to you. Even gemstones have to be polished to become jewels. If you let your guard down, one day, you will come to regret wasting those days away.\u201d\u201cGosh! That nagging of yours.\u201dShakora smirked.He understood the peculiar, pubescent child. He also understood the dissatisfaction she had toward the family.\u2018The grass always seems greener on the other side.\u2019The reason he was not correcting her behavior was because, unlike her brothers, she had inherited his talents.\u2018When you realize what you have, your tilted axis will automatically find its place, for that is the fate of a genius.\u2019Amy suddenly stopped. Thanks to her dad\u2019s nagging, she remembered the morning incident from before.\u201cWho the hell was that?\u201dShe trained wholeheartedly because she hated the rumors that insisted she was where she was only because she was born into a prestigious noble family.\u2018He looked to be around the same age as me.\u2019\u2018He definitely wasn\u2019t taught how to fight, so how did an uneducated individual master magic?\u2019\u2018An accident\u2026 Or is it perhaps the awakening of talent\u2026\u2019That was the only thing she could think of.\u2018\u2026If you let your guard down, one day, you will come to regret wasting those days away.\u2019Amy bit her lower lip.\u2018I will never lose!\u2019She swore to herself that she would never lose against someone from that social class.\u201cDad\u2026\u201dIt was a surprise to hear Amy starting up a conversation with her dad first. So to sincerely show that he was listening, he lowered the newspaper in his hands.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not really saying that I want to fully get into it\u2026 But there is a subject I\u2019m interested in.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dShakora\u2019s eyes shone in excitement.She was a bright kid who could understand with just half a word.\u201cTell me. I will actively back you up.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not saying I want to devote myself to it, I\u2019m just interested in it.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll support your interest.\u201dAmy was a bit bitter.\u2018Yes, I know!\u2019There was nothing difficult in the world if you had the power and wealth of a 1st-class noble family.\u2018How foolish of me to think that my parents would exert any effort in trying to raise me themselves\u2026 But I have no choice but to go with it.\u2019Amy did not understand how childish it seemed to other people to deny the Karmis family until she was beaten by a commoner.\u2018I\u2019m gonna become the best!\u2019Amy, who made her decision, spoke.\u201cMagic.\u201d\u201cMm? What was that?\u201d\u201cIf you know anyone from the magic academy, please introduce me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShirone kept quiet about what had happened in the city.It was not a simple matter. Because once he brought it up, he would have had to tell them about what happened at the magic academy.Shirone thought back to the incredible experiences that day brought forth.Whether it was a blessing or a misfortune, it was clear that since he had crossed the line, there was no going back.Geniuses know if they are a genius, and Shirone had more or less realized that he was a bit different from others since he was young.And although he had never felt superior, his desire to overcome limitations was stronger than anyone else.But he couldn't reveal it.His parents were the most precious things in the world to Shirone, and he didn\u2019t want to burden them with such things, as despite the fact they were poor, they never forced him to go through a hopeless path.And due to that, daily life didn\u2019t change.He helped his mom with housework and went to the nearby forest to cut down trees.However, Shirone now spent most of his time meditating, not wielding an axe.Every single day since the awakening, Shirone had been secretly training the Spirit Zone.Thanks to this, by the time a month had passed, Shirone managed to cut down the time it took him to enter the Spirit Zone.There were some parts that were not as easy as he thought.No matter how familiar he was with the Spirit Zone, he could not reproduce the magic from the alley.\u2018It\u2019s to be expected.\u2019He only subconsciously managed to do it due to his instincts kicking in.So even if a similar situation were to occur, and the same emotions were to surge forth again, he knew it\u2019d be difficult to do it while being aware of it.\u2018If I want to rationally cast magic, I\u2019ll have to skip over insight and instead learn the middle process to know everything!\u2019But there was no information available to Shirone, who had not formally learned magic.Instead, he focused on digging into the Spirit Zone which was the only thing he could do.When he finished meditating, he practiced the Thunder Strike.Unlike the first time, the success rate dropped as he began to be conscious of the skill.\u2018The power of insight is incredible!\u2019Sometimes, beginners succeeded not because of knowledge, but because of insight.However, cutting wood was different from magic, as you were able to practice doing it.With each swing, Shirone corrected his mistakes one by one.Craaack!The tree fell satisfyingly.But Shirone continued to swing his axe without a look of satisfaction or happiness.He was just correcting a mistake he found.\u2018Tomorrow, as well as the day after that\u2026\u2019That was how he repeated the basics.\u2018For the chance to practice magic will come one day.\u2019While dragging the logs home, Shirone\u2019s eyes shone with intensity as this was the most motivated he had ever been.* * *Standing by the window, Shirone looked at the magnificent view of late autumn leaves flying through the mountains.3 years had passed, and he was now a 15-year-old boy.He still wore childish clothing, but he had a face handsome enough to turn heads.\u201cI\u2019ll be back, mom.\u201d\u201cTake it easy. We have plenty of wood.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be winter soon. We have to be prepared.\u201dHe let out a cold breath as he left the cabin.Since seasons arrived faster in the mountains than in the cities, snow was already piled up at the top of the mountain.\u201cI\u2019ll have to walk quickly if I want to be back before sunset.\u201dShirone wasn\u2019t scared of the cold as he spent three years training in the Spirit Zone, and due to this, his mental fortitude had already exceeded the level of normal adults.After his shy character disappeared, he hung out with the other children, but he had no particularly close friends.They were different from Shirone.The children of the mountain were all rough, and most of the girls thought the same way as well.For example, a year ago, a woman named Hauran from a Hwajeonmin Village once seduced Shirone.TL/N: Hwajeonmin Village refers to a place where people who practice the slash-and-burn agricultural technique live.When she, who was six years older, tried to approach physically, Shirone freaked out and refused.Then she suddenly changed and threatened to ransack his house if he told anyone about what happened.Shirone, who recalled the event, burst into laughter.It didn\u2019t end up happening, but he remembered being really perturbed about her coming.\u2018I\u2019m sure she\u2019s doing well!\u2019Arriving at the logging area, Shirone found a suitable tree and lightly swung his axe. Afterwards, he took a careful look at the dent he had made.\u2018......\u2019If you were thinking of the commonly referred concept of \u2018seeing\u2019, he was actually not looking at anything.\u2018It\u2019s not something you can find with your eyes!\u2019You may automatically realize the principle if you repeat the same action or thoughts over and over.Shirone, who had swung his axe in numerous ways over the past three years, was finally catching on.\u2018Feel with my eyes.\u2019It was a method called Inner Eye.Shirone\u2019s eyes changed for a moment as he swung at the dent with strong force, unlike before.Following the sound of thunder, the tree fell down.\u2018That succeeded with just two tries!\u2019Although luck was on his side this time, he had succeeded with 10 tries before anyways.\u2018Whoo.\u2019After finishing his quota, Shirone sat down on the stump of the fallen tree and entered the Spirit Zone.Currently, his Spirit Zone\u2019s domain was a sphere with a diameter of about 40 meters, which was the level of an upperclassman at the magic academy where those who were talented gathered.The shaking of the bushes was felt, the sounds of worms wriggling, and the sound of osmosis from the trees entered his ears vividly. It was as if the earth had assimilated into him.Nature changed constantly, and Shirone felt it.The five hours of savoring the dynamic world went by in an instant.\u201cHuh? It\u2019s already dark?\u201dAfter completing his meditation, Shirone split the wood into pieces and carried it to the Jige.TL/N: Jige is a traditional Korean A-framed carrier used in the past to carry heavy materials.Arriving home, Shirone found a carriage in the yard and examined the stable.Two white horses he had never seen before were eating the fodder.\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201dNo usual greeting welcomed him.The atmosphere was strange.His mother\u2019s face was dark, and in the living room, an old man he saw for the first time was talking to his father.\u201cHuh? Dad? When did you come back?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re home?\u201dFor someone who left at dawn to go sell materials, he returned fairly quickly.In addition, he would have drowned him with kisses, but this time he remained seated in his chair.\u201cSay hello, Shirone. He is the deputy butler of the Ogent family.\u201dThe old man approached.\u201cHello, I\u2019m Temuran.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cNice to meet you. My name is Shirone.\u201dShirone politely greeted.Shirone, who lived deep in the mountains, also knew about the noble family, Ogent.They were 2nd-class nobles located in Creas. They were known for producing skilled warriors and soldiers.\u201cI came to see you.\u201dAlthough the deputy butler was a commoner, Temuran\u2019s tone was imbued with the characteristic sensibility of a noble.The status system of Thormia was divided into nobles and commoners, but in reality, it wasn\u2019t as simple as just that.Those who worked closely with the aristocracy were more authoritative, and those who lived outside the castle, like the Vincent family, were often called and treated as the lowest commoners.\u2018Even so\u2026\u2019Why did someone of the highest status among commoners come all the way to this valley in the mountain?\u201cThen I\u2019ll be taking a look.\u201dTemuran felt around Shirone\u2019s body and examined his appearance, physique, and eyes.Shirone was offended for being treated like livestock, but while Shirone was thinking that, Temuran said something.\u201cDo you know how to read?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ve been reading since I was young.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dShirone\u2019s patience has also reached its limit.\u201cI\u2019d like to know what\u2019s going on. Can you tell me?\u201dTemuran\u2019s eyes grew cold\u201cYou have a pretty good reputation. Being the son of a mountaineer, you know how to read, and you\u2019re very devoted to your parents.\u201dTemuran said in a borderline mocking tone.\u2018What the\u2014\u2019As soon as Shirone tried to reply back, a shocking proposal left Temuran\u2019s lips.\u201cWould you like to work for the Ogent family?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dShirone felt as if he had been struck by lightning.\u2018What now?\u2019No, that didn\u2019t matter because it would mean working for a 2nd-class noble family.\u201cThe family is relocating the Great Library. It\u2019s not work just anyone can do. There are about 10,000 books that cannot be leaked. The porters will do the heavy work, but the classification work will only be done by you and me. It\u2019ll take about two years.\u201d\u2018Library!\u2019Shirone\u2019s heart almost burst.His excellent insight had a gut feeling that something ominous lay behind the suggestion, but he felt like he could take on any poison.Temuran told Shirone the kind of poison he had to drink.Which was his pride to not use cheap tricks against a commoner.\u201cYou and your family are the only ones who know of this. If for any reason a book is leaked, or if rumors spread, you and your family are dead.\u201dShirone then understood why the expressions of his parents were dark.Even if he promised not to reveal anything, no one knew what could happen in those 2 years. It was like entrusting your life to someone else.And yet, the reason why Shirone couldn\u2019t turn down the offer was probably because\u2026\u201cWe\u2019ll compensate you with enough money to live a good life. You will earn a lot more compared to your father. Hah, thanks to having a good child, it looks like the family is going to make a living.\u201dVincent spoke with a red face.\u201cI didn\u2019t hear your proposal because of the money! I just wish that Shirone\u2026 That he\u2026!\u201dTears welled up.A rare opportunity brought by a loving father who wanted only to help his son achieve his dreams\u2026 And yet said opportunity could end up killing his son.\u201c...My only wish is for my son to achieve his dreams.\u201dTemuran snorted.\u201cWhat are you thinking? Aren\u2019t you getting ahead of yourself? Wake up. I\u2019m only hiring. You were the one who asked me to use your son. There\u2019s no reason for such a request unless it\u2019s for money.\u201d\u201cYou said he can read books!\u201d\u201cOf course he can read books if he\u2019d like. But I\u2019m not asking for him to read it, I\u2019m saying that it\u2019s impossible to perfectly keep an eye on him. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying you\u2019re dead if anything is leaked. It\u2019s a minimal safeguard.\u201dVincent clenched his teeth.He heard, when he went to sell goods, that the deputy butler of a noble family was looking for a commoner who could read.He thought it was an opportunity from heaven, so he ran to Temuran and begged him to use Shirone.But he didn\u2019t expect him to say that.Imagining his son getting hurt\u2026 Was the thing that frightened him the most. What if he thinks that his dad sold his child away because he was blinded by money?\u201cPlease leave. We don\u2019t need any money. If I knew this was gonna happen, I wouldn\u2019t have begged. So please, leave.\u201d\u201cDad, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u201cShirone!\u201dTemuran looked back at Shirone, not expecting that.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to risk your life.\u201dIt was quite the frightening job for a 15-year-old boy.\u201cAre you sure? I\u2019m not trying to scare you. I\u2019m telling you in advance that even a small rumor will lead to a blade next to your throat.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll do it. I won\u2019t ever leak anything, and I'll not blame anything or anyone if a rumor were to spread for some reason. So let me do it.\u201dTemuran couldn\u2019t help but trust him.All the conditions were perfect.He was a lowly commoner that could be killed anytime, had deep filial piety, and intelligence.Feeling his travel was worth the effort, Temuran turned around.\u201cI\u2019ll come pick you up in a week, but if you change your mind in the meantime, you can always tell me. But remember, once in the mansion, you won\u2019t be able to leave until we\u2019re done.\u201dTermuran opened the door and walked out, but his family wasn't in the mood to open the door for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why did you\u2014 That was a very dangerous thing to do! No, it\u2019s all my fault! It\u2019s because this father of yours is ignorant! Let\u2019s just turn it down!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right, dad. The only thing we have to do is to keep our mouths shut.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple! How can you keep your job a secret? It\u2019s crazy no matter how much I think about it! I will take responsibility for the refusal!\u201dShirone shook his head side to side.He was fortunate that he had good parents.\u201cFather.\u201dVincent abruptly stopped, looking dazed at the sudden way Shirone addressed him for the first time.What was more shocking, however, were the tears falling from Shirone\u2019s eyes.\u201cSh-Shirone.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dSaid Shirone, who opened his arms while having a big smile on his face.\u201cYou gave me the biggest gift in the whole world.\u201d\u201cHeuk!\u201dVincent cried, not caring whether he\u2019d lose face or not.In his entire life, had he ever seen his son\u2019s face filled with that much joy?\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Shirone! No matter what happens, I will protect you! Don\u2019t worry about anything and work hard! I will protect you for sure!\u201d\u201cDad, I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d\u201cYes, my son! My precious son!\u201dAnd the mother, Olina, was also wiping away her tears of happiness at the touching sight of her husband and son.* * *A week later.The butlers of the Ogent family came to pick up Shirone.It was a project that would take more than two years, but Shirone, who lived a simple life, only packed one bag.Temuran decided to give 20 gold a month on the condition that Shirone would live with him. In comparison, the monthly income of Shirone\u2019s family was only four gold, so it was a huge increase for a hunter family.\u2018Will this house be a little more luxurious when I come back?\u2019He knew what his parents were like, but Shirone tried to imagine something happy and shook off his sorrow.The butlers proceeded with the contract in a hurry, and a distracted Vincent had to send his son away in the carriage without a proper farewell.\u2018It\u2019s just the beginning!\u2019Contrary to his worries, Shirone\u2019s mind was calm.He didn\u2019t show his parents, but he had decided that from now on, he would only make calculated, logical decisions that were not dependent on emotions.Entering the Spirit Zone, Shirone felt his anxious parents through synesthesia.PR/N: Synesthesia is a fancy name for when you experience one of your senses through another.\u2018Don\u2019t worry!\u2019In that instance, Vincent and Olinas\u2019 hearts suddenly warmed.\u201cShirone\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t magic.It was just that their son\u2019s feelings were conveyed.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dThe moment the carriage rattled, Shirone bounced out from the Spirit Zone, but his closed eyes did not open.\u2018Let\u2019s not get shaken up!\u2019 Have to stay focused!While entering the Ogent family was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, it also came with huge risks. The opportunity was a double-edged sword.Could he survive two years while living amongst the rich and powerful?\u2018I have to concentrate!\u2019Leaving himself to an unknown future, Shirone plunged back into the Spirit Zone.* * *The Ogent family was a household that produced nation-approved Grade 3 swordsmen, which in the military corresponded to the rank of General.\u201cThe family leader, Lord Bischoff Ogent, is a nation-approved Grade 4 knight. He is currently serving as a military commander in the city of Creas. In short, he is a big shot who commands this city\u2019s military.\u201dUpon their arrival, Shirone, while listening to a butler\u2019s explanation, looked at the main gate of the Ogent family.\u201cWow!\u201dIn the center of the enormous mansion, a huge road opened up.\u2018That\u2019s the Ogent family\u2019s Broad Way. When you think of the Ogent Family, you also think of the Broad Way.\u2019The road that stretched far without any obstacles revealed the characteristics of the family.\u201cHehe, are you scared? You\u2019re not already surprised, are you? They\u2019re the real deal.\u201d\u201cWatch your words. You want your head to fly?\u201dAn old male servant snapped.However, due to the fact that he could relate to some extent, the butler said no more.\u201cCome this way.\u201dThe Broad Way was not a road for butlers or servants.Shirone turned to the garden path next to the road and bypassed the mansion.The place where the male workers were situated was a four-story, circular building. And in the office of said building was where the deputy butler, Temuran, resided.\u201cYou\u2019re here? Follow me, I\u2019ll explain the work.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201dTemuran, who did not even receive a greeting, headed to the library with thick documents.As soon as the old iron gate was opened, a scenery that Shirone dreamed of unfolded.A world of books.On the second, third, and fourth floor, all he could see were bookshelves filled with books.\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201dSmelling the rich scent of paper, Shirone clenched his fist.It was worth risking his life.\u201cWe will be moving the books here to the new library. All you have to do is sort the books. I\u2019ll give you a list every week, so find and gather those. You work from 9 in the morning to 6 in the evening. You can\u2019t go outside and you can\u2019t enter the mansion without special orders. But other than that, you\u2019re free to do what you want. As for the worker rules, another butler shall tell you of them. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes. When do I start?\u201d\u201c Tomorrow. Unpack and rest for today. In the meantime, make sure you understand all the rules a male worker needs to follow.\u201dThe next day, Shirone went to the library to get to work.When he started working, he finally realized why only one person had to do this job.The list given by Temuran contained hundreds of titles, and among those, the classification criteria was subjective.For example, it was unclear whether the book History of Swordsmanship should be classified as a history book or a book for swordsmanship.\u2018Mr. Temuran has set the framework anyway. As long as it doesn\u2019t go far off from the criteria I set!\u2019Shirone had set his order of priorities.Since history was comprehensive and swordsmanship was technical, the History of Swordsmanship was classified as a book under the swordsmanship category.It took as much as two weeks to set his own criteria in this way.Of course, even this kind of work was beneficial.This was because in the process of establishing his own category system, Shirone had realized a fact that he had not known before.All knowledge was connected.The work gradually became easier, and soon afterwards, he was able to reach the targeted quantity each day in time.\u2018I\u2019m going to start reading now!\u2019He wanted to use his time efficiently as all the knowledge here would become a huge weapon for him in the near future.\u2018Okay, there are 10,000 books in front of me.\u2019Even with the approximate two years left, it was impossible to read all the books.\u2018Where should I start? Would it be best to just start off with a random book?\u2019Suddenly, a thought came to mind.\u201cRight!\u201dAll knowledge is connected, so as long as you dig into one field first, you\u2019ll be able to strengthen another later.\u2018Then which field should I study first?\u2019After repeatedly thinking over it, the corner of Shirone\u2019s mouth went up.\u201cHistory.\u201dIt was the core of all knowledge. Events and discoveries were recorded in chronological order.Shirone imagined the concept of history as a horizontal line.If zoomed in, the line would contain all human knowledge, including religion, science, magic, mythology, literature, arts, politics, war, and economy.\u201cLearning history will greatly shorten the time it takes to reinforce other fields of study. History is truly the Core of Knowledge.\u201dAccording to his self-written classification list, there were approximately 850 books.Shirone made up his mind.\u2018I\u2019ll read all the 850 books in the two years I have left. This will be my foundation!\u201dFrom that day on, Shirone read books without going back to his lodging, even after his work was over.He could skip the roll call using overtime as an excuse.In fact, except for Temuran, the deputy butler, there were no workers who cared about Shirone, a temp.\u2018It\u2019s difficult!\u2019Reading history books was a pain in the neck for Shirone.The specific names of places on the continent, famous figures, and the events that occurred could not be easily memorized by a boy who grew up in a mountain for 15 years without ever hearing about them.\u2018Should I just memorize the whole thing?\u2019Shirone shook his head.\u2018While it\u2019s important to memorize it, it\u2019s more important to be able to pull it out of my mind anytime. Understanding even a single event is the quickest way to building a proper foundation!\u2019It wasn\u2019t easy understanding history.This was because he had to identify in depth why such an incident was inevitable and how it had affected the future.Efficiency had dropped significantly and it had reached a point where Shirone couldn\u2019t finish a book even after a week.Naturally, the days he slept in the library became more frequent, and he would, at times, collapse as if he were about to faint.Four in the morning.The iron gate opened and Temuran with a crystal lamp came in.Temuran would come in at this time every day to check on Shirone, who was oblivious to this fact.His eyes turned to the book at Shirone\u2019s feet.\u2018It\u2019s the same!\u2019Even though it was not a difficult one to read, the book had not changed for the past 15 days.Temuran snorted.If Shirone was furiously mastering those practical books, he was going to ban him from accessing the library aside from working hours.But it was complete nonsense. He was a fool who dreamed an absurd dream.\u201cOf course. Being a child of lowly commoners, what kind of success could you have?\u201dWhile you have to be smart to get ahead in terms of studies, you also have to be clever and know how to think intelligently.Temuran, who only thought of Shirone as a child with a nonsensical, grand dream, thought he was far from promising.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Three months later.Shirone gradually got more used to the classifying job. He also learned several pieces of information through the male servants.The most shocking fact of all was that the nobles didn\u2019t care if the books were leaked.In any case, the busy nobles who already had a lot on their plates were not interested in whether or not a few books were to disappear.But that did not indicate less danger.An aristocrat could only have a laid-back attitude if he had the loyalty of the commoners.Servants, to prevent even the tiniest of mistakes, could become cold and heartless.Commoners had to risk their lives in order to not catch the attention of the nobles.Shirone could tell just how different the two lines of thinking were from each other.Then one afternoon, the library door opened and he heard an unfamiliar boy\u2019s voice.\u201cHaah\u2026 That old man. On a day like this, who cares if I rest a bit.\u201dShirone blinked as an uninvited guest had made a sudden appearance.\u2018That person is\u2026\u2019It was Rian Ogent, the youngest son of the Lord.Having the blood of a mighty knight, he had a masculine, rugged face, and even though they were the same age, he was a head taller than Shirone.Shirone's train of thought was suddenly interrupted by a shout coming from outside the library.\u201cRian! How dare you run away! Once I catch you, you\u2019ll be made to run another hundred laps!\u201d\u201cArgh! Damn it!\u201dRian, who was running between the bookshelves, finally found Shirone.Rian, who was running towards Shirone, grabbed Shirone\u2019s shoulders suddenly and said.\u201cHey! Don\u2019t tell him I\u2019m here, okay?\u201dThen, whilst he hid himself under the bookshelf, an old man\u2019s thunderous roar shook the library.\u201cRian! I know you\u2019re hiding here!\u201dAlthough he was a gray-haired old man, his shoulders were wide. He was also tall enough to remind Shirone of a giant.\u201cYou! A boy as tall as a peanut with blue hair came in here, right?\u201dShirone thought about it.He did know the blue-haired boy, but if the blue-haired boy was the size of a peanut, what did he look like in the eyes of this old man?\u201cFrom what I saw, he looked like the youngest young master. But excuse me, who are you?\u201dShirone intended to change the subject, but the veteran saw through the boy\u2019s mind.\u201cI\u2019m a swordsman instructor! I\u2019m saying that I\u2019m the teacher who has the right to beat up that peanut. You\u2019d better tell me quickly, unless you wanna get beat up.\u201dShirone pursed his lips.Anyone who taught the young master under the orders of the Lord was not a person who could get fooled by the words of a boy.\u201cOh, I see. The youngest young master is hiding under that bookshelf over there.\u201d\u201cHey! Are you crazy? You wanna die?\u201dRian crawled out with a frown.Then, he discovered his swordsman instructor, who came up close to him. He started to tremble in fear.\u201cMaster! This is a misunderstanding!\u201d\u201cYou rascal!\u201dThe swordsman grabbed Rian by the collar and threw him to the ground.As soon as Rian\u2019s body fell, Shirone closed his eyes.Rian hit the floor with a loud noise, as his limbs were spread out on the ground due to the shock.\u201cFollow me, you punk! Forget training! You need to be mentally trained again!\u201dHis instructor dragged him out with his legs. With an upside down view, Rian faced Shirone.And mouthed something.Even though no voice was heard, and only the shape of the mouth was passed on, Shirone heard it clearly.\u2013You\u2019ll pay for this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter that day, the back of Shirone\u2019s head itched almost daily. But Rian did not show up.According to the rumors, he got caught by his instructor and was taken to the mountains.It wasn\u2019t until a month later that Shirone relaxed.Humans were oblivious creatures. As long as nothing big or significant occured, it would soon be forgotten.\u2018No way he has a grudge simply because of that.\u2019With a light heart, Shirone started reading about the founding of the Kingdom of Thormia, his country.The number of books he had read over the past four months was 82.Though not a large number, his reading speed gradually sped up as the number of completed books increased.\u2018My prediction wasn\u2019t wrong!\u2019The first book took 20 days to complete.However, after fully understanding the first book, many things got easier for Shirone.No books he read, following the first, had any completely new information.There was only a difference in degree of complexity, but the same information would repeatedly appear.\u2018No need to be scared. It\u2019s only hard the first time!\u2019If he were to lay the foundation with about 200 books first, the remaining 650 books would be much easier to take in.Shirone\u2019s favorite part of history was definitely the mages\u2019 active role in it.If a scholar studied a theory, the mages were the ones who implemented said theory.According to this relationship, the occupations of mages were as diverse as the many fields of study.Nevertheless, the reason why all scholars were not mages was because they could not enter the extremely sensitive state of mind: Spirit Zone.In addition to the variety of knowledge, a mage must have sensitive senses.Therefore, Shirone, who had already mastered the Spirit Zone, was even more frighteningly immersed in building up his knowledge.He suppressed his curiosity towards more miscellaneous subjects, and dug through only history.\u2018I have to hold myself back!\u2019Shirone suppressed his urges in order to gain the endless efficiency that would come with the Core of Knowledge.When that efficiency finally arrives, just what kind of mage would Shirone become?It was a waste of time to think about stuff like that.\u201cWhoo.\u201dAfter reading the last page of the founding history, Shirone closed the book with a satisfied expression.At that moment, the door burst open.\u201cHey, you jerk! I went through hell while waiting for today to come!\u201dIt was Rian Ogent who returned from hell.To call him an incarnation of the devil with that malicious face of his would not be an understatement.\u2018So persistent!\u2019He harbored the same amount of anger as when he was dragged by his swordsman instructor a while back.If Shirone was to point out any difference, it was that his eyes were sunken and his body appeared thinner.\u201cAre you really here for that?\u201d\u201cOf course. Do you know how much trouble I went through? I climbed and climbed the cliff countless times. Everytime I thought I would fall to my death due to my waning strength, I managed to hold on as I NEEDED to get my revenge!\u201dShirone was anxious.If he had been growing that hatred everyday, then Shirone must look like a sworn enemy to him.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to answer? You thinking about saying empty words? I\u2019m asking why the heck you snitched on me that day, you coward! I feel sick when I see guys like you!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t rat on you, I just told the truth.\u201d\u201cI asked you for a favor. Why didn\u2019t you tell me that you weren\u2019t going to help me? I trusted you.\u201dShirone gave up persuading because he couldn\u2019t deal with the reasoning of an aristocrat.\u201cThen what should I have done?\u201dRian looked slightly taken aback by the unexpected attitude.He looked like a butler who had just started working for his family, but he looked so calm.\u201cAlright, you\u2019re ignoring me too, aren\u2019t you? You must have heard something from somewhere, but I\u2019ll show you clearly who I am. Follow me.\u201dShirone followed Rian.Judging from the degree of his anger, he seemed to be thinking of taking him somewhere to beat him to the brink of death.\u2018It\u2019s better than dying. Let\u2019s just let him do whatever he wants to do to me. Whether it be hitting or mistreating me.\u2019He couldn\u2019t throw away the opportunity that his parents risked their lives for.Whenever he felt fear, he imagined his parents enjoying their meals.It was a small exercise hall where they arrived.Since the family revered martial arts, there were several large and small exercise halls in the mansion. But the place they were now was a place dedicated to Rian, and no one would hear if they screamed.Shirone waited with a dry mouth while Rian lit the torch.He wished they could just start quickly because each passing second made him more and more uncomfortable.Maybe it was on purpose.But if Shirone were a swordsman, he would\u2019ve known this level of tension on a battlefield was normal.\u201cHere, take this.\u201dAs the training ground lit up, Rian threw a wooden sword towards Shirone.The wooden sword, which clung to Shirone\u2019s hand with a loud slap, had a handle thicker than that of an axe's.\u201cWhy are you giving this to me?\u201d\u201cA duel. I\u2019m not as cowardly as you. I\u2019m destined to become the greatest swordsman in the future. But enough about that, This is my way of paying you back for snitching on me.\u201dShirone thought that was ridiculous.\u201cHow was I cowardly?\u201d\u201cAs a servant of the Ogent, you have to protect the Ogent. You sold me out to my master because you were afraid of getting beaten. Someone was in trouble, and yet you sold them out. No matter how much I\u2019m ignored by my family, I cannot be treated the same way by a guy like you, so bring it on. Considering the gap between us, I\u2019ll allow you to come at me three times before I start.\u201dRian\u2019s look changed.Although he seemed to have a simple, ignorant personality, those eyes of his were certainly Ogent.Shirone, who responded to the fighting spirit, was holding the wooden sword tightly with both hands.In other words, after his three chances were up, he knew his bones were going to be broken.Various thoughts crossed his mind.\u2018What do I do? What can I do?\u2019In the midst of despair, Shirone did not give up.No matter how unlikely it was, he couldn\u2019t just not try.\u201cHere I come!\u201dShirone\u2019s spirit, which was showcased through his raised sword aggressive rush, was unexpected, but Rian simply snorted.\u2018His posture is awful.\u2019\u2018He\u2019s never wielded a sword!\u2019As Rian blocked Shirone\u2019s attack, he shouted.\u201cOne!\u201dSmack! A satisfying sound spread through the training ground.To Shirone, it sounded like the footsteps of a lion strangling someone\u2019s neck.He transformed the fear in his stomach to a loud shout and tried to slash his sword horizontally.\u201cTwo!\u201dThis time, one corner of Rian\u2019s mouth rose as he easily blocked the slash.Shirone choked up, he pulled himself together and entered a state of extreme concentration.\u2018Spirit Zone!\u2019As all kinds of information were integrated into synesthesia, a light bulb went off in his head.Rian snorted.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u2018Vertical slash, horizontal slash, vertical slash?\u2019No matter how new a beginner was, it would have been harder not to block such a simple pattern.Rian, who raised his wooden sword to block Shirone\u2019s attack, took a step and shouted.\u201cNow it\u2019s my tur\u2014\u201dCRAACK!The center of Rian\u2019s wooden sword shattered, and Shirone\u2019s wooden sword broke as well.Fragments of wood flew past Rian who had a face of astonishment.\u201cHuh?\u201dRian quickly came to his senses and took a good few steps back to look at the wooden sword.The grain of the cross sectioned part of the sword stood up rough.This was a characteristic that occurred when the force of impact was not released properly and remained inside.\u201cThat\u2026 That was Sword Smash, wasn\u2019t it?\u201dA skill to destroy weapons.Just as there was an infinite amount of ways to perform a slash in swordplay, there was also more than one method to destroy weapons in every school.The Ogent family called theirs Sword Smash, and it was a Secret Technique that was only handed down directly.The reason why it was labeled a Secret Technique was because it was not a skill that one could master with strength alone.In close-quarters combat, the absorption of power is as diverse as the weight of it.In order for Sword Smash to succeed, one needed to perfectly pinpoint the area in which the shock would not be spread. It was also necessary to understand the opponent as to ensure they could not dissipate it themselves.Rian was shocked.Even Rian, who had been wielding a sword ever since he was born, never succeeded in executing Sword Smash.Most of all, he was offended because he was the only member of the family who had not yet mastered the technique.\u201cWho the hell are you? Where did you learn that swordsmanship?\u201dShirone dropped his broken sword.He sensed with the first blow and analyzed Rian with the second blow.And on the third blow, he did it, The Thunder Strike he had practiced for three years.\u201cI never learned any swordsmanship!\u201d\u201cShut up! You\u2019re rotten to the core! How did you succeed in doing Sword Smash?! If you\u2019re trying to make fun of me, I won\u2019t let you off so easily!\u201d\u201cThat was Thunder Strike.\u201d\u201cThunder Strike?\u201d\u201cMy father is a hunter. Since I used to live in the mountains, I used to cut down a lot of trees. Since I was neither big nor strong, I had to learn how to cut down trees in a more technical way. It naturally came to me. Among the lumberjacks, this skill is called Thunder Strike.\u201dRian\u2019s thoughts were all tangled up.\u2018Mountaineer? You went around cutting trees? What the hell are you talking about? I\u2019ve been holding a sword for 15 years now. Sword Smash is not a skill you can learn through cutting trees.\u2019\u2018None of my peers ever succeeded in casting Sword Smash. But if I had to name someone who could\u2026\u2019Rian thought of one.\u2018Rai Ogent!\u2019He was the second son of the Ogent family. He was two years older than Rian.He was also a genius in swordsmanship. He\u2019s considered to have the greatest talent in the history of the Ogent family.Rian clenched his fist tightly because he envisioned his brother laughing at him.\u2018Damn it!\u2019Rai first succeeded in executing Sword Smash at the young age of 12.His family gathered to celebrate and their father held a week-long party.Rian clearly remembered his emotions on that day, as now, even the child of a mountaineer had surpassed him.\u201cI can\u2019t accept it!\u201dHe let out a thundering cry as he needed to vent his emotions.\u2018But\u2026why?\u2019\u2018How come he became something\u2026 While I\u2019m still a nobody\u2026\u2019\u201cYoung master, I\u2019ve shown grave disrespect\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up! Nothing\u2019s over yet! No one\u2019s lost!\u201dRian headed to the outskirts of the training grounds.There, equipped with various weapons, he returned with a high-class long sword used by aristocrats.The sight of the sword gave Shirone shivers.\u2018Perhaps\u2026\u2019The sword, which made a ringing sound as it was drawn, reflected the torch.Once he finished checking the blade, Rian put it back in the sheath and threw it to Shirone.Raising his head in confusion, he stepped forward in order to catch the sword with both hands.Rian spoke while stretching out his fingers.\u201cSince both of our weapons broke, let us consider this match a tie. If you really mastered Sword Smash, then we\u2019ll have to account for that. One month from now on, let\u2019s compete here with real swords.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dShirone\u2019s heart dropped.He just wanted to survive, but he somehow made the situation worse.Wooden swords and real swords were on totally different levels. In addition, Rian would not be giving him three chances like before.\u2018I might actually die this time!\u2019The faces of his parents came to Shirone\u2019s mind, as he felt the fear of death for the time.\u201cYoung master, please change your mind! I never even learned swordsmanship!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m giving you a month. You learned Sword Smash while cutting down trees? Although I can\u2019t believe it, if you\u2019re that smart, you should be able to come up with something in a month.\u201dRian didn\u2019t think it was unreasonable. It would have been possible for Ogent Rai.He saw his brother in Shirone.\u2018Yeah, I just didn\u2019t have enough resolve.\u2019\u201cDon\u2019t even think about running away. Regardless of my personal feelings, I will definitely surpass you.\u201dRian's last words tied Shirone down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe following day.Shirone, with a tired face, went to work in the library. He couldn\u2019t sleep a wink due to what happened yesterday.Due to having a lot on his mind, he couldn\u2019t speed up his work.\u2018Let\u2019s calm down.\u2019After struggling to calm himself down, Shirone was eventually able to regain his composure.\u2018I\u2019m not dying now. I still have a month. I\u2019ll be able to figure something out.\u2019First of all, background check.According to the information he gathered, Lord Bischoff had three sons and one daughter.The eldest son was a certified Grade 6 swordsman. The second son was also a genius swordsman who followed in his brother\u2019s footsteps.The eldest daughter was also talented, but she chose music over swords and was working as a royal pianist.And after figuring out all that, he noticed Rian was the only one who failed to stand out in the end.The Lord even provided him an exclusive teacher, but the reports claimed he was not talented.\u201cHaah, I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I should have just accepted the hits when he was adamant on beating me.\u201dIt was natural that Rian, who had been compared to his brother all his life, was angry at the Thunder Strike.It seemed that not all nobles were born to excel.\u201cNow what? I\u2019m in big trouble.\u201dAgitated again, Shirone stared blankly at the real sword, which had been left unattended under the desk.\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this.\u201dShirone jumped up and headed for the study.\u2018Whether I fight or not, it\u2019s always better to be prepared!\u2019Since he lived in the mountains, Shirone was confident in his stamina and level of fitness, so if he were to learn self-defense, he would be able to at least save his life.After putting aside the history books for the time being, he collected all the books related to swordsmanship.While there were technical books like the Sword Textbook, there were philosophical books such as What is Sword? and Only Humans Are Afraid of the Sword.Practical books such as Let\u2019s Win With Bluff and The Stronger Individual Is the Survivor were also seen.Shirone opened a book with the simple and clear title of Swordsmanship.It was a book that contained the history of swordsmanship as well as overall knowledge about it.It was also an interesting book in the eyes of the aspiring mage, Shirone.If mages had the Spirit Zone, swordsmen had something called the Schema.Schema was both an imaginary body and a schematic of the human body.Every human had their own body image, and the Schema was an extreme embodiment of it.Masters of Schema would say that they could fully understand their body and be involved in how their cells moved as well as how their nerves sent signals.Shirone put down the book and slapped his knee.\u201cIt\u2019s nearly identical to Spirit Zone.\u201dA mage would erase their existence and assimilate with the world, but a swordsman did the opposite and further dug into themselves.Shirone attempted Schema.Feeling an imaginary self while maintaining the senses just before entering the Spirit Zone.\u2018As expected, it\u2019s not too difficult yet.\u2019However, the imaginary body was dark as a shadow and could not be felt.\u2018If I were to remove this dark curtain, it would become Schema. It's truly incredible.\u2019Shirone picked up the book again.It was written that the method of mastering Schema varied widely from family to family and that prioritizing specific parts to strengthen it depended on the method.While there were families that unlocked Schema to simply develop the mind, there were also families that drove the body to the limit.Some families focused on muscle strength, some speed, and some used Schema to strengthen nerves.\u2018Come to think of it\u2026\u2019Shirone recalled the red-haired girl from the alley three years ago.At that time, the situation was hectic, but when he thought about it back at home, her movements were not something a normal human could do.\u2018She unlocked Schema. She was about the same age as me\u2026 What great talent.\u2019Shirone closed the book and ruminated.Rian couldn\u2019t have mastered Schema anyways, but Shirone wanted to try doing so, even if there was a barrier.\u2018Schema is not exactly swordsmanship. Just like how Spirit Zone is not exactly magic.\u2019Just like how knowledge was significant to a mage, a strong body was essential for a swordsman.\u2018If one\u2019s body is not supported, the width of reinforcement is extremely narrow. I already have the Spirit Zone, so it would be faster to find a solution to swordsmanship rather than trying to accommodate two completely different concepts!\u2019It was a strategy to learn some useful swordsmanship with the Spirit Zone as the base.\u201cGood.\u201dShirone opened a beginner\u2019s textbook in swordsmanship.Knowing that his life was on the line, Shirone\u2019s concentration was at its highest ever despite having to suddenly study swordsmanship, a subject he previously did not have much interest in.* * *\u201cARGH! ARGH!\u201dDust rose in the Great Training Grounds. Rian\u2019s legs were the culprit.His heart was about to burst. No oxygen was being inhaled, so the chyme in his stomach flowed back up.\u201cBlaaargh! Blaaargh!\u201dHis lunch came out, but Rian did not falter and continued to run.\u201c100 laps! Pass!\u201dThe swordsman, Kite, shouted. Rian looked different today, and as his instructor, he couldn\u2019t have been any more proud.\u201cNew record! But what happened to you? Why just start to flow with the training now?\u201d\u201cDamn it! You call this training?\u201d\u201cWhat did you say, you punk?\u201dKite looked at him with slit-eyes.He complimented him for the first time in a while, but old habits die hard. All Rian did was complain and grumble.But today\u2019s whining was different.\u201cI\u2019m still standing on my two legs! Master, is there anything harder?\u201d\u201cOho?\u201dKite was quite surprised.\u2018It\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s shown such zeal.\u2019It was the first time in two years since he knelt before the genius of Rai Ogent.\u201cYou. Something happened, right?\u201dWith his hands on his knees, Rian raised his sweating head.\u201c...There\u2019s nothing like that.\u201dKite did not believe him.With the eyes of his disciple staring ahead in such a frightening way, Kite knew something was definitely bothering him.\u2018Is it Rai again?\u2019No matter how much he thought about it, the only person who could make Rian this way was the second son of the family.Did Rai accomplish something again? But what? Didn\u2019t Rai already unlock his Schema?It didn\u2019t matter. His disciple was Rian, not Rai. And currently, he was bearing his neck, allowing him to push Rian to his heart\u2019s content.\u201cGood! Let\u2019s go hard today! Even if you were to die, I want you to know that I won\u2019t be responsible for it!\u201d\u201cBring it on!\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Rian swung an iron bar twice as heavy as a longsword.There was no limit on the number of times he had to swing, for if you couldn\u2019t realize Schema with your insight, then the only way was to push your body to its limits.\u201cHa! Ha! Ha!\u201dKite watched his student repeatedly cut vertically with satisfaction.But not long afterwards, his expression hardened.At last he realized and ran towards Rian with his eyes wide.\u201cYou crazy! Stop it! You\u2019ll burst your muscles!\u201d\u201cThey haven\u2019t burst yet!\u201dKite stopped himself.Tears were flowing down from Rian's eyes as he clenched his teeth and continued to swing the iron bar.\u201cDamn it! Why aren\u2019t my muscles exploding! Why can\u2019t I break my arm? I can do more! This isn\u2019t the end! I\u2019m not done yet!\u201dTears welled up in Kite\u2019s eyes.He was a teacher who was as upset as his student.\u2018How come it\u2019s not working? He\u2019s pushed his body to the limits\u2026 So why can\u2019t he open Schema?\u2019Kite wiped away the tears with his thick arms.This shouldn\u2019t be the case. What would become of Rian if even his own teacher were to doubt him?Kite intercepted Rian\u2019s iron bar.This time, Rian did not protest and stopped moving because his teacher had stopped him with his own hand.\u201cRian, that\u2019s enough. Let\u2019s call it a day.\u201dRian\u2019s madness disappeared with that warm voice, and with that, his arms gave out, and without even knowing that the bar had fallen to the ground, Rian replied with his head down.\u201cOkay. Thank you.\u201dKite wrapped an ice towel around Rian\u2019s shoulders. Seeing that the bones were not damaged, he was surprised at the sturdiness of Rian\u2019s bones.Sitting on the hill of the training grounds, Rian was staring at the distant mountain with a fierce expression.\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d\u201cThat my arms are killing me.\u201dThere was a small smile on Kite\u2019s face.\u201cRian, I\u2019ve never written about your talent in a report.\u201d\u201cTsk, did I ask?\u201d\u201cBut I think you\u2019re talented. Achieving something quickly is not the only indicator of talent. Reaching for the unachievable is a talent as well.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to comfort me. It\u2019s only those words that are sweet. Frankly speaking, I\u2019m only working this hard because I\u2019m not talented.\u201d\u201cIs it really though? A genius knows that they\u2019re a genius, so they are clearly aware of what they can do. Have you ever thought of that?\u201d\u201cWell, I do know what I can\u2019t do.\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s why you\u2019re not a genius.\u201dRian looked back at Kite with a ridiculous look.He was adding fuel to the fire. He was a teacher who made both his arms and heart hurt.\u201cStop it. I already know that.\u201dLooking at his pouting student, Kite smiled.\u201cBut Rian, do you know what a genius is afraid of? They\u2019re afraid of effort. Geniuses work hard, but their level of effort is different from normal people. They may experience setbacks and pain, but there exists no doubt as they only do what they can. So effort is a powerful weapon for those who aren\u2019t geniuses. You\u2019re trying because you\u2019re not talented? Don\u2019t even start with that. While talent guarantees you something, effort can grant you something talent can\u2019t. And that thing is will.\u201dKite grabbed Rian by the shoulder and squeezed.\u201cYou have the will to challenge the nigh-insurmountable. That will is something not everyone has. Simply put, will power is the natural enemy of a genius.\u201dRian liked that. It didn\u2019t matter to him if they were just words of comfort.Yeah, he didn\u2019t have talent, but he knew that despite the fact he wasn\u2019t born with a road to success, he could pave it himself.\u2018I\u2019ll definitely win.\u2019He was determined to put everything he had into training.* * *Shirone knew clearly what he could and couldn\u2019t do.And due to that, he began to study swordsmanship without hesitation when he realized the concept of Schema.Selection and concentration.Talent efficiently designs the shortest distance to a destination through these two.Shirone set aside all the miscellaneous techniques and dug into the basics of swordsmanship.* * *A month passed.During that time, Shirone trained in only two things: the eight ways of cutting and the eight ways of blocking.\u2018This is my best!\u2019Satisfied with his performance, Shirone finished his training.And finally, he asked a question that would show what he had learned over the past month.\u201cWhat is swordsmanship?\u201dWhile It was a sport that was made with the purpose of taking lives, it was also a sport that required high-levels of wits and intelligence in order to come out alive.Shirone aimed the sword forward.He learned from the books that the enemy could move in every way imaginable, but he knew that was not the truth.\u2018The sword that comes in to cut me is real. So there are eight places I need to block!\u2019He responded with his imagination.Eight blades that overpowered eight defenses turned to hundreds as one addition was made.\u201cUrk!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t possible to calculate all the ways a sword could move.\u2018I\u2019m not counting numbers. I\u2019m feeling as a whole.\u2019Just like how you couldn\u2019t see the whole forest when staring at a single tree, Shirone needed to focus not only on the individual aspects of what he learned, but to look at them as a whole.That was insight.But it was easier said than done.As various patterns spread out like fractals, he kept focusing on a specific spot.\u2018It\u2019s okay if I don\u2019t make it. Let\u2019s observe for now. I\u2019m just fixing errors right now!\u2019Free from tension, Shirone completely let go of his thoughts at some point as he delved into his mind.Then the whole thing was visible and all kinds of possibilities began to appear at once.\u2018What?\u2019Shirone\u2019s eyes were filled with astonishment.\u2018There\u2019s no end to it.\u2019His sword and Rian\u2019s were filling up the scenery around him.Shirone, who dropped the sword, stumbled backward.\u2018Haa.\u2019Swords, too, were infinite. Shirone saw the infinity of their swords.\u2018I see the swordsmen chose this kind path!\u2019Shirone chose the infinite path of magic, so being able to relate swordsmanship to that made him feel good.\u2018Mom, Dad, I\u2019m sorry. I might not be able to go back!\u2019He had no regrets.And the same was true for Rian.Despite his life being on the line, Shirone was happy that he was able to see such a wonderful side of the world.Ding Ding Ding\u2026The bell rang signaling eleven o\u2019clock.Rian, who wanted to have what he couldn\u2019t have, did what he could.The clash between the two boys in stark contrast to each other was now just an hour away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Great Training Grounds.Arriving on time, Shirone saw Rian waiting for him.The two stared at each other\u2019s swords without moving from their spots, as if the battle had already begun.\u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201dRian\u2019s weapon was also a longsword.The subversive and vigorous swordsmanship of the Ogent family was originally more suitable for greatswords rather than longswords\u2026 Until Schema came about..Therefore, the reason why they chose the longsword was because it was more suitable with Schema, not for consideration towards the opponent.Rian carefully observed the Stillness Encompassing Movement learned by Shirone in the beginner level of swordsmanship.His center of gravity was better than before.\u2018Is that really possible?\u2019Rian, who discovered Rai\u2019s genius traits in Shirone, suddenly had a thought.\u2018That guy might really not have learned swordsmanship.\u2019\u2018But\u2026 How can you be so calm when you\u2019re holding a real sword for the first time? Aren\u2019t you afraid of death?\u2019Rian also feared death. Therefore, he trained endlessly in order to gain the courage to face it.\u2018No matter how talented you are, catching up to me this quickly is impossible\u2026 So how?\u2019Of course, Shirone knew.As a beginner, he couldn\u2019t flexibly control this life-and-death duel as well as Rian could.Therefore, he developed a special training.\u2018If you can\u2019t beat fear, then simply understand it.\u2019It\u2019s called \u2018jumping off the cliff.\u2019Human beings were capable of jumping off cliffs if they didn't imagine what would happen after.\u2018Fear exists in the future, and the future is just an illusion that doesn\u2019t exist yet.\u2019Like a dictator of absolute power enjoying a dinner calmly before a rebellion, Shirone imagined himself standing on a cliff.His body remained in the air when his right foot stuck out in front of the cliff as his left foot followed.\u2018You\u2019re not falling until you fall. You\u2019re not dead until you die.\u2019Understanding the essence of danger, Shrione knew that that cold intelligence was sometimes scarier than a warrior\u2019s bravery.And the cool-headed consciousness of Shirone boosted the Spirit Zone\u2019s sense of stability drastically.\u201cHere I come!!\u201dRian was approaching before Shirone knew it.There seemed to be a flash of light in front of Shirone, and it was definitely a whole different level of swordsmanship compared to his meager level.\u2018But\u2026 I can feel it.\u2019Recognizing the trajectory of the sword through synesthesia, Shirone calmly titled his upper body.Rian stared in shock as his sword was dodged, both of his eyes opening wide.\u2018He\u2019s looking at the sword?\u2019To dodge a real sword required one to stare at it, which was something most trainees couldn\u2019t do.However, swords were also infinite.As the number of attacks gradually increased, Shirone\u2019s synesthesia began to develop blind spots.The moment the blade cut his chest, the Spirit Zone suddenly wavered.Shirone\u2019s heart sank.\u2018Dang it!\u2019At this rate, he would be beaten.Contrary to expectations, however, Rian still continued with his big attacks.Thanks to this, Shirone, who predicted the next trajectory, jumped away to avoid the danger of death.\u2018How come\u2026\u2019If Rian had slashed at his side, the duel would have ended then and there.However, Rian continued to make big moves as if he didn\u2019t realize Shirone was taken aback.Only then did Shirone realize.\u2018My understanding of swordsmanship is quite lower than I expected.\u2019Although Rian was skilled at using techniques, he didn\u2019t seem to be putting much thought into his attacks.\u2018Then\u2026\u2019Shirone realized he had overestimated Rian\u2019s skills.It was dangerous to let your guard down, but to label the enemy as too strong was also a mistake as one would become too defensive.\u2018I\u2019ll attack.\u2019When Shirone suddenly changed his strategy and launched an offensive, Rian got staggered.\u201cKeuk!\u201dAs such, dozens of combinations rained down on Rian, and due to the tension, his defense started to drop.\u2018Damn it! This is not happening! This can\u2019t be happening!\u2019\u2018Those are definitely basic swings\u2026 But why are they so hard to block?! I can\u2019t even clearly see the attacks!\u2019Rai suddenly came to his mind.The detestable face that overpowered him with one hand and sneered at him in a match two years ago.\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh!\u201dRian shouted.\u201cI\u2019m gonna become the best swordsman in the world!\u201dShirone thought it was strange.He acknowledged the spirit of Rian, who continued to fight back despite fighting a losing battle, but in this way, his only ending would be death.\u2018Does he not want to live? Why are you being so stubborn? Does he even think?\u2019\u2018Huh?\u2019At one point, Shirone realized that he could no longer read Rian\u2019s movements.Predicting a swordsman who emptied their mind and swung blindly was quite difficult.\u201cI won\u2019t lose! I\u2019ll definitely surpass you!\u201dAs Shirone\u2019s stamina bottomed out, Rian realized he had a chance at victory.Shirone had saved his stamina as efficiently as possible, but there was still a huge difference between the two. Shirone\u2019s sword began to feel heavy.\u201cThis is it!\u201dRian, who came running with his longsword hanging down, swung it up towards Shirone\u2019s chin.\u201cKEUK!\u201dShirone responded by swinging his sword down with all his might.With the sound of the clashing blades, a sword soared into the sky and embedded itself far away from the training ground.Silence.The two who breathed in harsh, rugged breaths stared at each other.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Rian lowered his gaze first.He saw Shirone\u2019s sword pointing at his stomach.\u2018Just before our swords clashed\u2026\u2019Shirone swung his wrist and struck Rian\u2019s sword from the bottom.In addition to the force brought about by Shirone\u2019s swing, Rian, who was also low on stamina from having to block the continuous strikes from Shirone, eventually lost his grip on the sword.\u2018Is that even possible?\u2019It was not a technique Rian could attempt with confidence.His sole purpose was to win, and due to his cool-headedness, Shirone won the duel. However, he did not relax.\u201cHaah\u2026 Haah.\u201dHe wanted to immediately lay on the ground, but he couldn\u2019t let Rian nullify his hard-earned victory.And in the next moment.\u201cDang it. I lost\u2026\u201dRian passively admitted his defeat.\u201cAh, I lost. I lost again.\u201dHis malice disappeared, and instead, Rian just scratched his head roughly.He trained past his limits and fought as best as he could, so he didn\u2019t have any regrets.\u201cYou won. I have nothing else to say, so you may now kill me.\u201dHow could someone be so immature?\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou think I\u2019ll survive if I kill you? What a ridiculous thing to say.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? We fought with our lives on the line, and there was a clear winner.\u201d\u201cYoung master, you\u2019re the only one who laid your life on the line! I just fought FOR my life! What makes this ridiculous duel more absurd is that this only started because you hid from training, and then blamed me for snitching on you.\u201dRian was taken aback.After a fierce battle, even if there wasn\u2019t a heartwarming atmosphere, shouldn\u2019t there be at least some passionate emotions left?\u201cHey, you jerk! Who put the blame on you? It was because of that petty, mannerless attitude of yours! Despite the fact we had met for the first time that day, you should have had at least a small pinch of loyalty!\u201d\u201cHAH?! Loyalty?!\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say, you punk?\u201dShirone could not put up with it anymore.He turned a blind eye to it considering his life was on the line, but since the problem was now solved, he couldn\u2019t keep his temper in check.\u201cYou call that loyalty? Did you ever consider the position I was in? I had to choose between the Lord\u2019s son and a teacher assigned by the Lord! Yet you asked me for such a favor despite knowing that?!\u201d\u201cHuh? Of c\u2014\u201d\u201cIf you want loyalty from me, then you should show you're worth it! You should be ashamed of yourself for putting that much pressure on a servant! You should have stepped in front of your swordsman instructor! Isn\u2019t that a true act of loyalty?\u201dRian pursed his lips in embarrassment.Shirone figured Rian out as he did not argue or make excuses.He was not someone to make up stuff. He just didn\u2019t speak because he had nothing to say.However, hating that attitude more, Shirone stopped nagging and sat down.\u201cSigh! I almost died!\u201dRian stared at Shirone carefully.The boy who overcame the fear of death and pushed him back was long gone.Who was he? It was obvious that he was a genius, but he wasn\u2019t Rai.Unlike his brother, who wielded a sword with one hand accompanied by a smile, this boy gave his all against him.\u201cHey, what\u2019s your name?\u201dShirone raised his head. From his sitting position, Rian looked bigger.\u201cMy name\u2019s Shirone Arian.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Rian Ogent.\u201dIt was funny how two people from different social stratas introduced themselves, but that wasn\u2019t what shocked Shirone.\u2018Does he think I wouldn\u2019t know the name of the family\u2019s youngest son?\u2019Irrespective of that look on his face, Shirone\u2019s head raised higher as Rian approached.A hand the size of a cauldron lid was shoved into his face.\u201cLet\u2019s be friends. What do you think?\u201d* * *It has been a year since Shirone first started working under the Ogent family.By the time Shirone turned 16, more than 7,000 books from the Great Library were taken out.Temuran was blown away by Shirone\u2019s amazing speed, but Shirone already predicted that much.This was because it was natural that as the number of books to classify decreased, efficiency accelerated.Constant velocity was only a theoretical concept, yet every event in this world was influenced by acceleration.Therefore, even if the start was slow, as long as one didn\u2019t give up and continued to work hard, one could achieve their goal much quicker than expected.Of the 850 historical books that he targeted, only about 200 remained.The average number of books he read per day was over three, and in a few months, the Core of Knowledge that Shirone dreamed of would be completed.In addition, he experienced swordsmanship and understood the essence of fear.Thanks to this, the durability of the Spirit Zone had also increased dramatically.Therefore, the one year he spent here was fruitful and valuable\u2026 However, none of the benefits could compare to making a good friend.\u201cThere are an extreme amount of books. Do you think my family has read all this?\u201dRian, who became Shirone\u2019s friend after the match, spent the freetime he had in the library.Infact, unlike his size, he was affectionate and winsome.He fit the role of youngest son of a noble family.\u201cOf course. The family leader and the young master often stop by the library.\u201d\u201cTsk, smart people are lucky since they have so much to read.\u201dRian, who was sitting on the floor, started rummaging through books.Shirone came down from the ladder and picked up the books. After doing so, he began to nag.\u201cDon\u2019t throw them around so carelessly. If you damage anything, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s going to have to pay for it. Probably with my life.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like that either. Does it make sense that books are more important than human lives? Even if you burn the library to the ground, I\u2019ll protect you, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cJust stop doing what you\u2019re doing, then nothing bad will happen, so the solution is just to be careful.\u201dPlayful words never came out of Shirone\u2019s mouth.But that was who Shirone was.He was firm and strict, but he wasn\u2019t cold.Rian liked that about Shirone.\u201cIt\u2019s fun to be with you, but it\u2019s stifling to be stuck in the library.\u201d\u201cWhy are you even here? What about your training?\u201d\u201cBasic training only. I told him I wanted to study in the library.\u201dShirone\u2019s body shook.\u201cThen you should hurry up and study! What are you doing?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m bored! I\u2019m bored! I\u2019m bored!\u201dRian was lying on his back, flailing his limbs about as he acted like a baby.Regardless, Shirone turned away and went to his desk.He wasn\u2019t particularly worried about Rian\u2019s laziness.If Shirone\u2019s tendency was water, Rian\u2019s was fire. A fire that grows out of control once it burns.\u2018He just needs a trigger!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I found an interesting book.\u201dAfter finding a book to read, Rian was amazed at the speed Shirone was turning the pages.Once upon a time, Rian had taken over 10 hours to turn a page.He was definitely reading a book, but by the time he blinked, it was morning.Rian sat quietly beside Shurone to avoid disturbing him and opened his own book.Swordsman vs. Mage was the title of the book.\u201cIntroduction. You may have asked this question at least once before, but if a swordsman and a mage were to face off, one-on-one, who would win?\u201dShirone\u2019s hand paused as Rian read aloud.It was also an interesting topic for aspiring mages.\u201cI have traveled all over the world to find an answer. Even now, when I close my eyes, those thoughts flicker in my head. On the Artusna Mountain, 6,000 meters above sea level, there are carnivorous trees that eat wild birds\u2026\u201dRian closed the book.\u201cHow terribly boring.\u201d\u201cWhat? I was having fun!\u201dRian jumped at the sudden shouting.He pretended not to be interested, but he must have kept his ears perked up.\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018fun\u2019? There are no pictures, and there\u2019s no mention of swordsmanship.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t even finish a single page! What are you even talking about?\u201d\u201cA writer should be considerate of his readers. He should start with a fun beginning and a touching conclusion.\u201d\u201cThis is not a novel. Give me the book. So, who\u2019s going to win?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of knowing who wins or who loses? For what absurd reason would a mage and a swordsman need to face off? If it's favorable to one side, they would want to fight and if it\u2019s disadvantageous to the other, they would flee.\u201dShirone opened the middle part of The Swordsman vs. The Mage and searched through the pages.\u201cThere may be times when they have no choice but to fight. If that happens, who will win?\u201d\u201cMay I make a rough prediction?\u201dAbruptly, a sharp voice was heard over the bookshelf.\u201cOf course, the swordsman would win.\u201dA man with a cold impression appeared.He wasn\u2019t as bulky as Rian, but he was much taller, and his limbs were slim and long.He was the second son of the Ogent Family, Rai Ogent.Although they were brothers, his atmosphere and appearance was quite different from Rian\u2019s. First, his hair was pitch black.There were two undiluted characteristics that descended from the Ogent family. Bischoff, the head of the family, the eldest son, and the second son inherited black hair. The light blue hair was passed on to the eldest daughter and the youngest son, Rian.In addition, Rian\u2019s grandfather, a nationally recognized Grade 3 swordsman, also had blue hair.The family had a strong bond, but it was interesting how they would sometimes be divided according to mere hair color.Which heritage stands out depends on the generation, but this time, black hair was leading as Bischoff and Rai had black hair.\u201cAh! Hello.\u201dShirone quickly bowed his head.No one knew that he was friends with Rian, so if Rai had heard the conversation a while ago, he would be in trouble.\u201cThe swordsman wins? How can you say that with such conviction? Because you\u2019re one?\u201dRian knew that, so he tried to get on Rai\u2019s nerves with a sarcastic tone.\u201cConviction? Is it necessary to use such a dramatic word? It\u2019s a fact that can be acknowledged just by knowing where mages and swordsmen lie on each continent.\u201dRai didn\u2019t seem to care about his brother\u2019s relationship with the male servant, but Shirone could not relax.He felt this every time Rai came to the library. He was a difficult man to read.\u201cWhatever the position, it\u2019s a face-off. You\u2019re not going to talk like that on the battlefield, are you? Imagine saying things like \u2018It\u2019s over, I have the high ground!\u2019\u201dRian laughed, satisfied.But Rai didn\u2019t even respond and looked at Shirone with indifferent eyes.\u201cWhat do you think, kid?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 assuming we\u2019re talking about the highest level, magic is definitely powerful enough to inflict fatal wounds on a swordsman. But swordsmen have excellent physical abilities, so if they attack before magic is casted\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong. A mage cannot beat a swordsman.\u201dShirone choked up. Although he was only an aspiring mage, he was still undoubtedly working towards becoming a mage.Rian was pissed that his friend was ignored.\u201cWho are you to say something like that, huh? You think you\u2019re some kind of swordsman representative?\u201dThe corner of Rai\u2019s lips went up. It was the infamous smirk that Rian detested.\u201cNot just anyone can gain the dignity of a swordsman. However, money can buy just about everything you need to become a mage.\u201dThere was a hidden criticism behind Rai\u2019s words.In fact, swordsmen had a way to defend against magic. It was an artifact called \u2018Anti-Magic.\u2019A special mental wavelength contained within Anti-Magic can disturb a mage\u2019s Spirit Zone.In other words, the artifact reduces concentration.Artifacts were usually processed in the form of crystal balls and could be installed on armor, shields, and even swords.The price was also quite high, considering one key material was a dragon\u2019s heart as it emitted the waves required.However, wearing up to ten artifacts, with each having 10% efficiency, did not equal to 100% efficiency.This was due to the nature of the waves.If a new additional wave was to be added to the already existing wave of Anti-Magic, an overlap would occur.Therefore, the more artifacts one had on, the lower the efficiency.The best artifact by far to exist was the \u2018Armor Set of the Five Gods\u2019 created by the Archmage Yakra.Artifacts were embedded in helmets, chest plates, gauntlets, boots, and shields. Each with a maximum of 20% efficiency.The Armor Set of the Five Gods reached an overwhelming 65% efficiency worn all together, which was fatal to a mage.The percentage was a result of bypassing the overlap of the waves as much as possible.Another problem was the \u2018Essence of the Spirit.\u2019Four types of essence could be found in nature: fire, water, wind, and earth. And when Anti-Magic is put into the equation, magic activation, along with the elements listed above, could be completely blocked.The total number of essences known to exist so far was 17. 2 for fire, 3 for water, 5 for wind, and 7 for earth. The value of just a single one exceeded the budget of a small kingdom.Shirone tried imagining it.What kind of wizard would be able to win against a master of Schema, equipped with each kind of essence in the Armor Set of the Five Gods?Of course, it was still all theoretical.The armor set was scattered all over the world, and the locations were all unclear. Adding to that, it was nearly impossible to obtain an Essence of the Spirit unless you were given explicit permission from a nation that had one.There was also a problem with installing several Anti-Magic artifacts.Even Yakra, an expert on wave equations, spent 10 years trying to coordinate the waves of the Armor Set of the Five Gods.In short, if the waves of Anti-Magic were clumsily coordinated, the ingredients, along with the produced item, would become worthless.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Efficiency did not increase unless the interaction between the waves, the resonance frequency, and the mana relationship was fine-tuned.It wouldn\u2019t be a joke to say that half of an aristocrat's wealth could be blown away trying to raise Anti-Magic efficiency by 1%.But that\u2019s where the dilemma begins.Rather than investing a huge amount of money to raise the efficiency of Anti-Magic, it was much cheaper to carry around a mage who knew anti-magic spells.That was what Rai\u2019s words implied.That a mage was just a subordinate of a swordsman, and that his knowledge could be bought with money.In fact it was mages, not swordsmen, who developed Anti-Magic.Even now, numerous mages were studying the effect of dragon mana on the Spirit Zone.This was because if one ended up with good results, one could gain tremendous wealth and honor.It was ironic. Mages were creating a weapon that could only do harm to them.Rai pointed out that dishonorable situation.Mages would do just about anything for money. This also meant that they could not win a swordsman in terms of pride and honor.\u201cWhat do you think? You seem to like history books. You know the position mages in this world. Magic can be sealed off with money, but money cannot stop a sword.This was a biased, swordsman point of view, but Shirone understood what he was trying to say.\u201cThat is what a mage is.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRai raised an eyebrow.Rai thought of the boy as someone who liked magic. So he should have lost his temper, however, contrary to what Rai thought would happen, Shirone admitted it was true\u2026 Sort of.\u201cA mage is a person who persistently digs into the balance of all things. So it\u2019s not strange to study how to suppress magic. What they find important is not whether they win or lose, but whether they know it or not. Artifacts are a result of that never-ending search. For that reason, I think claiming that mages are at a disadvantage is wrong.Unlike Rian, Rai had a personality that wished to beat his opponent using his brain.Nevertheless, the reason why he kept his mouth shut was because he couldn\u2019t refute.Rian struggled to hold back his laughter.\u2018Ehehehe! Serve you right! My friend has a way with words! I\u2019m telling you, he has the sharpest tongue. If his tongue were a sword, it would be the sharpest sword in the world!\u2019Rai\u2019s face gradually began to distort as he could not find a way to refute.He couldn\u2019t just make up ideas that were never there.\u201cWell, that is in an ideal world, but the reality is different. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that a mage can\u2019t win against a swordsman.\u201dRai coldly turned around and left the library. Rian had a hard time suppressing his laughter.\u2018Reality is different? That\u2019s it? Ugh, he reeks of stupidity. Get away from here. Quickly, get lost!\u2019Then, when the door finally closed, he grabbed Shirone and bursted out laughing.\u201cPUHAHAHA! Shirone, that was awesome! I\u2019ve never seen my older brother make that kind of face before!\u201dWhile being dragged around by Rian, Shirone\u2019s eyes were staring at the place Rai left through.\u2018Swordsman vs. Mage!\u2019Maybe the reality was different, as Rai had said, but Shirone believed he was right.He believed that the mindset of a mage who explored the boundaries of knowledge without hesitation, despite the fact his weaknesses may show, would overcome a swordsman.That cold will was the reason for the existence of intelligence in this world.* * *The Great Library was cold enough to make one feel chilly.The bookshelf, which used to be filled with knowledge, was now empty. The luminous lamp that had once brightened up the inside was now also turned off.Only a single ray of sunshine from the 4th floor window shone on Shirone.Under the sunlight, Shirone turned the pages.One page after another\u2026 Until finally\u2026 he finished the last page and closed the book.Shirone stroked the cover gently.It was easy work to flip a book.However, to finally turn the last page after swimming through a sea of books? Now that wasn\u2019t something anyone could do.850 books of history.Shirone read all the history books in the Great Library.\u2018I\u2019m done\u2026 This is my Core of Knowledge.\u2019It was warm.He felt the light filling up his heart.Although he was a hunter's child, he could now confidently say he knew nearly everything about the whole world!\u2018A year and six months!\u2019Although it was a slow start, after reading and reading, Shirone started to accelerate, and once he did that, he never slowed down again. He sped up so much that he finished his work six months ahead of schedule!Now, he could go back home any time and there would be no reason for his family\u2019s life to be in danger.\u2018It\u2019s like a dream!\u2019His mind was filled with the numerous experiences he went through the past year and a half.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why are you still here?\u201dAs he opened the door, Rian fanned his hands and coughed due to the dust.Shirone just smiled.\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning behind that expression? Something good happen?\u201d\u201cRian, show me around your house.\u201d\u201cHuh? What?\u201dRian\u2019s eyes swung wide open with shock.He wanted to enter his family\u2019s house. Knowing Shirone, Rian was sure he wasn\u2019t kidding.At that moment, Rian found a book lying next to Shirone.\u201cYou\u2026 are done, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYeah, there\u2019s nothing left for me to read. At least not in this library.\u201dThere was nothing more to read.Even Rian, who stayed away from reading, seemed to understand how cool that sounded.\u2018Really?\u2019The sunlight that shone through the window seemed to be just for this moment.\u201cHahaha! Did you really? You\u2019re a real piece of work, dude!\u201dRian congratulated Shirone as if sharing in his friend\u2019s accomplishment.Though, he did it as the aggressive swordsman he was, and due to that, Shirone\u2019s eyes went in circles.\u201cAhh! I\u2019m dizzy!\u201dEven after pushing him away, Rian watched Shirone turn in circles.\u2018He\u2019s an amazing guy!\u2019He felt like he finally understood Shirone.Knowing who Shirone was and despite his background and status, Rian was only thankful.\u2018Honestly, I would have been quite upset if he had treated me as a Lord\u2019s son.\u2019Rian agreed without hesitation.\u201cGood! If you want to come to my house, you\u2019re always welcome! My family isn\u2019t at home either!\u201dIt didn\u2019t really matter to him, but it was much better for Shirone.After arriving at the mansion, Shirone was overwhelmed by the size of the building.\u2018It\u2019s really big.\u2019He could guess why ancient people built buildings to honor the glory of God.\u201cCome on in.\u201dHowever, Rian, who lived in said house, pushed the door open using his shoulder as if he were too lazy to even open the door.Shirone asked with an uneasy look.\u201cRian, what if we get caught?\u201d\u201cWhat are you so worried about? The library relocation work is done anyways, so you\u2019re not tied down by the contract. Besides, my family won\u2019t be back until the evening. Alright, alright, come on.\u201dAs they went up to the second floor, Shirone\u2019s eyes were greeted by the countless rooms littering the hallway.As they approached the very end of the corridor, Shirone saw the family\u2019s room.Although there was no special decoration like a family crest, the interior was especially pink.Instead of swords and shields, piano and unknown instruments were on display.From the musical instruments littering the room, Shirone could tell It was the eldest daughter\u2019s room.The number of rooms were overflowing, so there would have been many options, but Rian decided on the last room.Shirone felt like he had seen a side of the alienation Rian must feel despite being part of the family.\u201cWell, here it is. This is my room.\u201dAs a passionate swordsman, wooden swords were piled up in the room and books related to swordsmanship were also visible on the bookshelf.However, there were no professional books. Most of them were novels about myths.\u2018I wanted to come here at least once!\u2019Thought Shirone, as he considered Rian a friend.Rooms were said to represent a person\u2019s character. And that saying was not incorrect.\u2018He really has no interest in decorating at all!\u2019For Rian, who was always covered in dust, this place seemed meaningless except for when he wanted to sleep.The two chatted away because they had nothing to do. But when that got boring as well, they played a card game.The game ended in just 30 minutes.It was a complete defeat for Rian.Shirone asked while sweeping the chips.\u201cOne more round?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not doing it! Damn it. It\u2019s a gamble based on luck anyways. I guess I\u2019m just unlucky.\u201dShirone spoke again while organizing the chips.\u201cYou have a habit of moving cards outside when the ace comes in. And the time you take to bet is different depending on whether you have a pair. I\u2019m guessing the reason why is because when you have a pair, you\u2019re taking the time to think of a strategy, but when you don\u2019t have a pair, you just give up. But if there\u2019s a time difference, it stands out. Just knowing those two things gives me the higher probability of winning.\u201dRian had a blank look on his face as if he had been cheated.\u201cHow can you find such things?\u201d\u201cObservation often achieves its purpose when you are not obsessively trying to observe forcefully. If you try to observe multiple things at once, you will never find what you\u2019re looking for. Just appreciate and acknowledge them as a whole. Only then will something stand out.\u201dRian placed his chin on his hand.\u201cDon\u2019t be obsessed with what you\u2019re trying to get? Maybe this will help me find my own Schema.\u201d\u201cMaybe. I took that into consideration when trying to understand my Spirit Zone.\u201d\u201cHmm. To not be obsessed\u2026\u201dRian echoed Shirone\u2019s words.His brain was itchy. He felt like he was close to something, but the thoughts eluded him.He felt sleepy and got tired, perhaps because he thought about something deeply for the first time in a long time.\u201cWhatever.\u201dRian stretched out on his back.\u201cI have nothing to do, so let me sleep a little bit. I\u2019m so tired because I ran 100 laps this morning.\u201d\u201cThen get some sleep. I\u2019ll be reading a book.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dRian fell asleep as soon as he closed his eyes.Smiling at the sight of his friend who laid down comfortably, Shirone pulled out a novel.\u2018Bloody Fight With the Snake Queen!\u2019After only reading history books for about a year and a half, he didn\u2019t notice the passing time as he read an adventure story.On the other hand, it seemed like Rian enjoyed something quite different from Shirone\u2019s. Key sentences were underlined.\u2013The snake queen\u2019s weakness is her head.\u201cHahaha.\u201dThey didn\u2019t do much of anything, but he was happy to just be at his friend\u2019s house for the first time.An hour passed just like that.With Rian still not up, Shirone closed the book and organized the room.\u2018He said his family was coming back in the evening.\u2019\u2018When the sun goes down, the inside of the manion will get noisy\u2019Shirone thought it best to leave now.While walking down the hall, Shirone heard the sound of a piano leaking out from a room.For him, who had grown up in the mountains, the music filled with the composer\u2019s inspiration shook his heart more strongly than thunder.\u2018That\u2019s so cool!\u2019Shirone followed the sound as if drunk, and stopped in front of Rian\u2019s sister\u2019s room.A woman with blue hair that flowed like the ocean waves was playing the piano.It was truly a heavenly sound.Although not the youngest, she was a woman of talent who became a court musician at the age of 19, so to say she was talented was an understatement.The harmony that gradually accumulated and the variations that blended within.Shirone\u2019s consciousness abided to Reina\u2019s fingertips like a marionette caught in a melody.And only after the performance did Shirone finally realize where he was.Perhaps the emotional whirlwind went on for too long as Reina found Shirone. She smiled and waved at him.\u201cHi, how was it? My piano sonata?\u201dHow was it?He learned information about music through books, but what he heard with his ears was beyond what he had imagined.\u201cUhh, it was\u2026\u201dHe didn't dare to speak his mind.Reina patted the piano chair and spoke.\u201cYou can come over here and take a look. I\u2019ve never seen your face here before. Are you a new worker?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m in charge of sorting out the library. It\u2019s been over a year since I joined.\u201d\u201cAah! You\u2019re the one. I\u2019ve heard about you before. You must be very smart. Classification work can\u2019t be done by just anyone.\u201dMaybe it was because she majored in art, but Reina was not authoritative, instead, Shirone felt consideration in the way she spoke.Entering the room awkwardly, Shirone hesitated for a moment and pointed to the sheet of music papers.\u201cThis is called sheet music, right?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s titled \u2018In the Dark\u2019, which is the third movement of the piano sonata composed by Schreiman. Have you ever played the piano?\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cNo, never.\u201d\u201cReally? Then sit this way. I\u2019ll teach you. It\u2019s not a difficult song.\u201dShirone was nervous because the inertia of working while risking his life under the Ogent name remained.In particular, he was even more concerned because he heard from Rian that his sister was a wicked witch.\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Nobody is going to rebuke you because I allowed it.\u201dShirone, feeling somewhat relieved, sat down in front of the piano with much curiosity.\u201cNow, from here, Do, Re, Mi\u2026\u201dAfter hearing the most basic things, Shirone pressed the first chord, paying attention to her fingerings.Baaam.The sound that rippled through the heart.Feeling the tension gradually dissipating, Shirone continued by connecting the sound with a second chord.Reina\u2019s eyebrows rose.\u201cWow! You catch on quick! Despite this being your first time playing, your sight-reading is really good.\u201dTo play new music for the first time is called sight-reading.Like how athletic ability was more important than emotions, the faster the thinking speed, the better.Reina\u2019s compliment made him feel good, but he couldn\u2019t move himself to smile while looking at her eyes.Shirone, who was staring at the keys, raised his head when something came to mind.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cCan you please play it again?\u201dEven in their brief encounter, Reina discovered the unique temperament Shirone had.\u2018He is an active child!\u2019An average servant of the house would have spent their time currying favor with their masters, but Reina could tell Shirone wasn\u2019t like that.Reina readily agreed.\u201cOkay.\u201dTo say that artists were obsessed with talent is false. These were just words made up by fake artists.\u201cThen I\u2019ll play properly this time.\u201dWhat artists loved the most was passion.Reina encored \u2018In the Dark.\u2019Even to a non-professional Shirone, He could tell it was an extraordinary performance that was incomparable to the first.\u2018Schema.\u2019Her nervous system\u2026 It was twice as sensitive as the average person. Shirone could tell she understood her body.After her performance, Reina looked satisfied.On the other hand, Shirone was lost in thought with a serious expression, even after the music was over.\u201cCould I try again?\u201d\u201cHmm? Oh, sure.\u201d\u201cPlease understand even if it\u2019s difficult to listen to.\u201d\u201cHaha, of course. It\u2019s like that for everyone at first.\u201dShirone raised his hands gently over the keys.As soon as he thought his posture was acceptable, Shirone quickly started playing.Reina, who was listening to this unspecific music, bore an awkward smile.However, as Shirone was midway through, she realized something.\u2018Who is this child? What in the world is he trying to do?\u2019All the notes were off. Completely wrong. But to her surprise\u2026All the notes were similar.It may not be called music, but it seemed to convey Shirone\u2019s feelings.\u2018Whatever he\u2019s playing, he\u2019s not doing it as a performance\u2026\u2019Reina was correct. Shirone wasn\u2019t trying to perform, instead, he was in the process of going deeper in order to understand the concept of playing an instrument.\u2018A little more!\u2019Shirone focused even harder.Take in the whole music sheet, analyze it with your head, and command your ten fingers.Even in the midst of many different notes, the feeling was getting clearer.\u2018More, more. I need to get closer.\u2019As his concentration rose high, the Spirit Zone opened.\u2018I\u2019m almost there.\u2019Reina swallowed.Pleasant chords mingled between the gritty dissonance.Dun Dun Dun Dun!At the moment when the score and the performance reached its climax, there was a thrill that shocked Reina\u2019s body to the core.Shirone began an authentic cadence.\u2018It\u2019s here!\u2019Raising both his hands, Shirone hit the perfect 5th and then pressed upon the 1st interval with the greatest degree of passion\u2026BAAMM!!The harmony, which started 4 minutes ago, extinguished into seven notes, spreading an infinite, inexhaustible aftertaste.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShirone let out a heavy breath. Four minutes felt like eternity.Reina looked amazed.Since it was not quite a performance, she could not evaluate the pitch, but she had the insight to realize the essence.Who was he?\u2018Why did a child like this become a servant under my family?\u2019\u201cSeriously?! Shut up, you old hag!\u201dThe emotional atmosphere of the room shattered, and Shirone and Reina turned their heads at the same time.\u201cIf you\u2019re here, just wash your feet and go to sleep! Or even play a nice lullaby to listen to! Why the heck are you being so hysterical!\u201dFrizzy hair, and half-closed eyes.Rian, still half asleep, came into the room while scratching his washboard abs.Then after he locked eyes with Shirone, he tilted his head.\u201cHuh? What are you doing here?\u201d\u201cUh, no. I was\u2026\u201dIf it were to be revealed that Rian and Shirone were friends, it would create problems. But fortunately, Reina took the lead.\u201cSo, do you guys know each other?\u201d\u201cShirone? Yeah, he\u2019s my friend.\u201d\u201cRian! What are you saying?\u201d\u201cHahaha! It\u2019s okay. Although she has a nasty temper, she doesn\u2019t really care about things like this.\u201dDoes she really?He knew she was pretty open-minded, but there was a high barrier between the aristocrats and the commoners that should\u2019ve been hard to ignore.\u201cSo your name\u2019s Shirone. Don\u2019t worry about it. Any friend of Rian\u2019s, is also my friend. Even though he\u2019s a little pathetic, he still takes responsibility for what he says.\u201dShirone wasn\u2019t looking any less suspicious.From the receiving end, that could have been perceived as rude, but Reina accepted it rather well.Genuine trust is born from doubts and suspicions.\u201cBut you are one of a kind. Really, how did you think to play like that?\u201d\u201cWhat? Shirone was the one who did it? And here I was thinking it was your hysteria acting up again.\u201dShirone frowned slightly.He couldn\u2019t understand how words such as \u2018witch\u2019 and \u2018hysterical\u2019 were used to call such a pretty and friendly sister.\u201cRian, why did you lie to me? Your sister is a kind and nice person.\u201d\u201cShirone! Don\u2019t be fooled! This woman is a witch! She might eat you one day!\u201dRian\u2019s expression looked really serious, so Shirone could not reply back.Reina spoke.\u201cHoho, I\u2019m sorry. My little brother is extremely immature, but I\u2019m relieved to see that he has a friend like you. Take good care of him for me.\u201d\u201cOh, no. I don\u2019t\u2026\u201dReina\u2019s eyes sparkled at the sight of Shirone, who lowered his head shyly.Despite having an abundance of knowledge, Shirone was still an innocent child in regards to emotion. After all, he is still only sixteen years old.\u201cYou\u2019re quite the cutie.\u201dRian, who gulped down a cup of water from a table, said while pouring himself another glass.\u201cIf he\u2019s so cute, why don\u2019t you just take him and live together. I would love to have Shirone be part of my family. Muhahaha!\u201dShirone was even more embarrassed at Rian\u2019s joke, but what he was feeling didn\u2019t seem so bad either.Reina realized something from her brother\u2019s words.\u201cOho, it looks like you\u2019re close enough to even give your sister away.\u201dRian retorted, looking flabbergasted.\u201cWhat are you talking about? Of course. Shirone is like a brother to me, but I don\u2019t mind giving a witch like you to just about anyone. Rather, Shirone is worth too much. You\u2019re not worthy of Shirone.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dAs soon as she finished talking, Reina jumped high enough to the point where it could easily exceed a person\u2019s height.While still frozen in surprise, she landed in front of Rian and pulled her brother\u2019s ear.\u201cOWW! It hurts! It hurts!\u201d\u201cI went easy on you because you were cute, but it seems like you are trying to walk all over me now.\u201d\u201cIt hurts! I said it hurts!!\u201dAlthough she was now a musician, Reina was once a talented swordsman equivalent to Rai.The strength of her pinch was so great that Rian turned his head with watery eyes.\u201cShirone! Run away while you still can! If you get caught by this witch, you\u2019re done for!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t tell if he was joking or not, but one thing was sure, He couldn\u2019t leave Rian like that.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t think you meant any harm.\u201dReina, who was staring at Shirone and Rian with a grim stare, pulled his ear roughly one last time and let go.\u201cOuch!\u201d\u201cJust know that your friend was the one who saved your life. Tsk tsk tsk, do everyone a favor and learn a thing or two from your friend. Such an immature kid.\u201d\u201cTsk, it was only because you held me in a sensitive spot.\u201dRian grumbled while rubbing his ear. Then he looked back at Reina again.\u201cWhy the hell did you come home? Weren\u2019t you on vacation?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard? The news regarding Rai?\u201d\u201cWhen did I ever care?\u201d\u201cRai is taking a certified exam this time. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here to pick him up. I left with grandfather, but he said he was going to meet a friend halfway.\u201d\u201cA certified exam?\u201dRian looked shocked.Of course, his brother was a genius, so he accepted the difference in skill\u2026 But how did it reach this extent?A certified license was the dream of all nobles, regardless if you were a swordsman or mage.The exam was held once a year, with only a few applicants being allowed to take the test. And out of those few, the ones who obtained official recognition were less than 30.Of course, there was also the non-certified license.It was issued by an institution designated by the royal palace, and in Creas, an example of a representative was the Alpheas Magic Academy.After graduating from the magic academy, you automatically became a non-certified Grade 10 mage. You could then increase your grade by accomplishing various quests through associations or guilds.\u201cHmph, he must be happy. Geniuses sure are different. He even shoves me around at home, too.\u201dReina ruffled Rian\u2019s hair.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *He was a cute little brother, despite his lack of talent. She just hoped he would not be hurt by this.\u201cFirst, I have to go prepare dinner. It\u2019s fresh seafood from the royal palace, so we\u2019ll have to dress and clean those ourselves. It was nice meeting you, Shirone. Don\u2019t forget to say hi the next time we meet.\u201dShirone bowed his head, pushing away the sad feeling.\u201cYes. Goodbye.\u201dAlthough the chance to see Reina again may never come again, one thing was clear\u2026He would never forget the moment he played the piano with her.Perhaps that is why Shirone, who was to leave the mansion tomorrow, was able to gather up a lot of courage.\u201cRian. Does she\u2026 your sister, I mean.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201c\u2026Does she have a boyfriend?\u201dAs soon as he asked that question, a huge amount of regret washed over him, but there was nothing he could do as the words had already left his mouth.Rian blinked, then smiled widely, his teeth showing.\u201cShirone. Do you\u2014\u201d\u201cN-NO! Forget what I just said! I was just\u2014\u201d\u201cHAHAHA! Big sis! Big sis!\u201dRian ran out of the room in a flash, he grabbed the railing on the second floor, making Shirone pull him back by the waist.\u201cBig sister! Shirone asked if you have a boyf\u2014\u201d\u201cGosh! Stop it!\u201dShirone, who barely managed to cover his mouth, dragged Rian back into the room with all his strength.\u201cHuh? What am I hearing now? Boyfriend?\u201dThe maids working in the kitchen looked up at the second floor, but Reina just laughed.\u201cThey\u2019re just messing with each other. Alright, all we have to do is steam it. I removed the poison, so please do the rest.\u201d\u201cOf course, miss.\u201dWhen the cooking began in earnest, the maids were back to being absorbed in their work.However, the attention of the man in charge of the mansion\u2019s affairs did not leave the 2nd floor.Head butler Louis.He was a person who rose to the head of the butlers at a young age due to his calculation skills and thorough personality.That was 5 years ago and he was still in his mid-thirties. He was wearing rimless glasses with a cold expression.\u201cShirone, they called him?\u201dThe maids may not be able to remember, but he, the head butler, remembered very clearly.He was the contract boy brought in by Temuran for the relocation of the Great Library.\u2018Why is he with the youngest young master\u2026?\u2019For him, who decided to devote his life to the prosperity of the Ogent family, it was not a matter that could be simply overlooked.His glaring eyes turned to a butler near him.\u201cTell the deputy butler to come to my room. Now.\u201d* * *Early morning of the next day.Shouts rang out.After hearing that Rai was taking a certified test, Rian increased the intensity of his training.\u201cHA! HA!\u201d\u2018I will definitely catch up.\u2019The news added fuel to a fire, and Kite became sure as he watched his student\u2019s sword dance.\u2018His skills have improved!\u2019Stamina, vitality, technique, everything.With that level of skill, he would be able to easily defeat a bandit group near the city.However, If he were to have a match against someone who learned official swordsmanship, he still had a long way to go.The problem was Schema!Rian\u2019s impulsive, wild style was his biggest advantage, but it also acted as his biggest weakness.\u2018His swordsmanship is too tactless and honest.\u2019There were times when he would have to look back with a cold mind, but he was only moving forward.\u2018Everyone has their own way. The downside of not having a clear mind becomes nothing compared to that heating power of his. It\u2019s obvious that we have no choice but to continue like this!\u2019\u201cHA! HA!\u201dHe was wielding a club that was twice as heavy as a longsword with only his physical strength.Kite couldn\u2019t imagine how much Rian would improve if he were to learn how to activate Schema.\u201cStop! 10 minute break!\u201dRian came back panting like crazy, but his eyes were on fire.\u2018That also happened back then!\u2019\u2018...Yes, it happened around a year ago, although it went away quite quickly too.\u2019This time was different. Rian\u2019s flame did not fade.\u201cYoung master! Young master!\u201dA butler came running.Arriving in front of Rian, who was taking a drink of water, the butler spoke before he could catch his breath.\u201cThere\u2019s a big problem. Miss Reina is asking you to come to the mansion immediately!\u201d\u201cBig sister did? What\u2019s going on? If it\u2019s because of my big brother, I don\u2019t care. He can do whatever he wants.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it, a contract boy named Shirone is on the verge of being executed.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u2018Shirone\u2019s in danger?!\u2019He was even more taken aback because he was about to see his friend off in a few hours.\u201cShirone? Why? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWell, the thing is\u2026\u201d\u201cHurry up and tell me! What\u2019s going on?!\u201d\u201cLouis seems to have reported something to the Lord. I don\u2019t know the exact details, but I heard it revolved around a sort of friendship between you two\u2026\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dKite asked as he watched Rian hurriedly pick up the dry clothes he placed on a rock.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Who is Shirone?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a friend. I didn\u2019t go around announcing it because of his commoner status, but Louis must have found out about it and reported it to father.\u201dKite remembered a boy he had met briefly in the library a long time ago.Kite liked the shine in his eyes, but he wasn\u2019t that interested as he was a servant of the family.\u2018That\u2019s what happened?\u2019Rian spoke who was now neatly dressed.\u201cMaster, let\u2019s finish our training for today. I have to see my father. I have to go to the mansion.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, you cannot.\u201dRian looked at him weird.\u201cWhat are you talking about?! My friend is in danger!\u201d\u201cDid you not say he was a commoner?\u201d\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?! Master, are you that kind of person?! You said it too! Anyone who can converse with a sword can become a friend!\u201dKite clicked his tongue.His student, who did not understand the ways of the world, had gotten someone into trouble.\u201cWhat are you going to do when you get there? Are you going to wail and cry like a baby?\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201d\u201cRian, anyone can be a friend. But this is a matter between the people directly involved. Bad rumors can affect the position of the Ogent family. They\u2019ll do anything they can in order to ensure those rumors never see the light of day. Your foolishness will not be of any help in this situation.\u201d\u201cSo I should just stay still?! I reached out to Shirone first. I will not give up on him! I am no coward!\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dKite stared at his student\u2019s eyes.\u2018Such fine eyes. No lies, only passion. And above all, they are pure.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But don\u2019t make a step if you\u2019re not determined enough. It will only make things worse. This situation is already out of your control.\u201d\u201cMaster.\u201dWhile looking at Kite with fierce eyes, Rian smiled.As he bowed his head down politely, he held out his hands and grabbed the sword from Kite in silence.\u201cThank you. I will never forget this favor.\u201d\u201cRemember, abandoning a friend is equivalent to abandoning another you. Don\u2019t you dare half-ass this.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWith a stern nod, Rian ran to the manion with a sword strapped on his waist.There was nostalgia in Kite\u2019s eyes.\u2018My part is over!Although the time to say goodbye was short, he was happy he was able to leave his mark.\u2018May the future of my student be filled with good fortune.\u2019* * *The atmosphere inside the mansion was cold.All work stopped momentarily, and the male servants and maids kept their mouths shut.Louis, the head butler, wiped his glasses behind the sofa where the immediate family members were sitting.Next to him, Temuran, the deputy butler, was staring at Shirone, his stress plain for all to see.He was kneeling under all the gazes of hostility and contempt.He felt like he was standing in the middle of a Colosseum.\u201cReport, head butler.\u201d\u201cYes, my Lord. Shirone, a servant hired by Temuran, is accused of damaging the prestige of the Ogent family during his year-and-a-half-long stay here. The workers have witnessed the youngest young master and Shirone mingling, and I also heard Shirone talking to him carelessly. Attached are the testimonies of the workers in regards to the case. Temuran wrote for them.\u201dAs Bischoff silently raised his hand back, Louis passed the document into his hand.Flap! Flap! While the papers were turning, Reina sneakily went up to Shirone.\u201cShirone, don\u2019t worry too much. I\u2019ll try and convince my dad. Nothing\u2019s going to happen.\u201dContrary to expectations, Shirone looked so calm that it gave Reina chills.Not a speck of anxiety was seen in his eyes.\u2018He was not pretending to be calm! He really is looking at the situation calmly!\u2019Shirone was not afraid.This was because the future was just full of possible outcomes. Nothing had been decided yet.After looking through the file, Bischoff spoke.With a cold impression along with his pitch-black hair, he had the power to petrify with his words alone.\u201cShirone Arian, is what is written in this file true?\u201d\u201cDad, Shirone and Rian\u2026\u201d\u201cReina, I did not ask you. I\u2019ll give you a chance to speak. Stay quiet for now.\u201dReina knew this was not gonna be easy.Bischoff, a logical man who followed fundamental principles, was not a person who could be persuaded through mere emotions.Shirone opened his mouth.\u201cI would like to ask a question.\u201dAll the servants who were watching were surprised at how composed Shirone was. However, it did not phase Bischoff one bit.\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cIf the youngest young master and I are actual friends, what would happen to him?\u201dReina\u2019s eyes turned affectionate at Shirone\u2019s selflessness. He thought of his friend before himself, even in such a situation.\u201cNothing will happen. Right now, we\u2019re here to question you, a commoner. Whatever misdeed Rian has commited, as long as he\u2019s part of this family, we will continue to protect and support him.\u201dBischoff\u2019s words had thorns, but Shirone was satisfied.Shirone, who let a little loose, told the truth with a bright smile.\u201cThen I\u2019m glad. Rian and I are friends. We\u2019ve been friends for a year, and we\u2019ll continue to be friends.\u201dNo one dared to speak up or express themselves, but Shirone\u2019s words actually caused a great stir.In particular, the male servants who lived with him were the most shocked as his friendship with the youngest young master turned out to be true.\u2018Stupid boy. He doesn\u2019t understand how scary this world is.\u2019A son of a noble family and a son of a mountaineer have been friends for over a year.What seemed like a baseless rumor that had been passed around ended up being true.\u201cYou must take the name of the Ogent family quite lightly. Shirone, I will execute you as the Lord of this house. Since you came here signing such a contract from the beginning, you must have been ready for such a possibility.\u201dReina stepped up.\u201cDad! Listen to me for a second! You said you\u2019d give me a chance to talk!\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cThat was when there was room to make judgment. He has already confessed. It\u2019d be pointless to drag this out. Head butler.\u201d\u201cYes, my Lord.\u201d\u201cContinue the matter at hand. Also, this should never leak out.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dReina became nervous. Even in this situation, seeing as how Shirone continued to maintain his calm and composed exterior, Reina felt bitter.But how could they prevent this? Bischoff\u2019s decisions as Lord of the house had never once been reversed.\u201cWith whose permission?!\u201dRian opened the door and barged in.The temperature of the room increased with just his appearance alone.\u201cWho\u2019s going to execute my friend without permission?\u201dBischoff said flatly.\u201cMe.\u201d\u201cWhy the hell? He didn\u2019t commit a sin that deserves death, we only became friends! Just friends!\u201d\u201cOne does not die just because he has committed a sin worthy of death. The intricacies of aristocracy are much more complicated than you think. And those complicated circumstances are handled and resolved by the family, hence you, as a son of a nobleman, were also raised and brought up with preferential treatment.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I refuse such a privilege if it means I have to abandon my friend.\u201d\u201cYou are immature, Rian. Friendships are a mutual thing. What you can share with them is fixed and certain. That is a definite relationship. Does that kid think of you as a friend? How can I believe that? Let\u2019s say he approached you for money, how could you know? How can you trust him?\u201d\u201cShirone is not like that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. How do you know that? Prove it. Bring some kind of evidence that proves Shirone is not that kind of person.\u201dReina chewed on her lips.\u2018He\u2019s totally caught up!\u2019There was no evidence that could prove Shirone was a true friend because nobody could look into a person\u2019s heart.Feeling a chill from his father\u2019s words, Rian slowly grabbed the handle of the sword strapped on his waist.Something hot flooded into his heart.\u2018I understand now, Master!\u2019Rian, who understood what Kite meant, burst into laughter.\u201cHAHAHAHA!\u201dThis was not a staring contest between father and son, it was a battle of wills.\u201cAs expected, I can\u2019t beat my dad. I almost fell for it. Prove that we\u2019re friends\u2026 My proof is that I believe in him. Even if Shirone does not think of me as one, he is my friend as long as I believe we are. That\u2019s the best proof you can have in this situation! Trust!\u201dThis time, Bischoff was at the losing end.After all, what Rian said was also true.\u201cSo you are going to disobey me, the Lord of this house? This is not a matter between just you and me. It is a matter that involves the house. Noble houses can fall and collapse, even now it still happens. I have to make sure we don\u2019t crumble and fall. I am responsible for leading this house. Don\u2019t underestimate the situation. Even a son of a noble can be ostracized.\u201dBischoff burned his bridge.To kick out his own son.Not only the servants, but also the members of the Ogent family were shocked at the last remark.But Rian didn\u2019t budge.Instead, he answered politely with unprecedented courtesy, as if building a wall between him and Bischoff.\u201cIf that\u2019s the only way to protect my friend, I\u2019ll happily leave.\u201dBANG!Bischoff slammed his foot onto the floor.Unacceptable. A mere 16-year-old surviving an ostracism?\u2018That foolishness of his\u2026 His rude, mannerless actions\u2026 He\u2019s only unreasonable due to the fact that I am his father.\u2019\u201cThen draw your sword. To be ostracized means to be abandoned by your family. If your friend is really worth the fight, then you must risk your life.\u201dRian drew his sword without a word. The action angered Bischoff even more.\u201cAre you really planning on pointing your sword at me, your father?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not pointed towards you, father. You don\u2019t believe me, so I have no choice but to do this. I draw my sword because I believe in myself and my decisions.\u201d\u201cSince when did you cherish your friends? You never once made connections with other aristocrats your age. You said it was because they were dazzling in your eyes. You\u2019re only friends with this commoner because he doesn\u2019t shine. Because he is lower than you.\u201d\u201cFor the first time, you are wrong, father. Shirone is a friend who shines brighter than me. I want to help Shirone shine even brighter.\u201dBischoff was despondent.What did this Shirone do to dazzle his naive son to such a degree?\u201cIs it you? Did you make Rian like that? How did you persuade him into believing that a commoner and a noble could be friends?\u201dShirone spoke.\u201cAlthough I did not persuade him, since you think that is the case, maybe I did do something like persuasion.\u201dRian stood between the two.\u201cShirone, stay quiet. I\u2019ll take care of it. No matter what happens to you\u2014\u201d\u201cRian.\u201dRian turned his head as Shirone spoke with a cold tone he had never heard him use before. Shirone was staring straight at him.\u201cYou are responsible for what you are responsible for.\u201dNot only the family, but Rian, too, felt chills at the impassive words that were comparable to Bischoff\u2019s.\u201cHuh? W-Well, yes. Of course.\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to take responsibility for things that you shouldn\u2019t be responsible for. This situation was created by the two of us. We\u2019ll just have to get through it together.\u201dShirone looked back at Rian and smiled.\u201cEven if I die on this spot, I don\u2019t regret being your friend.\u201dSilence ensued.Not only the servants, but also the members of the Ogent family couldn\u2019t help but turn solemn in the moment.And for Rian, it was like pouring fuel into an already burning flame.\u201cYeah! That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying! Even if I\u2019m ostracized, we\u2019ll still remain friends!\u201dThe servants started to murmur amongst themselves.They were cynical at first, but now they couldn\u2019t figure out who to side with.Reina, who was resting her chin using the back of her hand, smiled.\u2018You are really amazing, Shirone!\u2019He silenced the adults with indisputable logic.The reason why Shirone\u2019s words could not be refuted was because they were all human beings. And all human beings had to deal with a thing called \u2018emotion\u2019.\u2018I\u2019m sure everyone here has had a friend like Shirone. A person they wish they could be friends with forever.\u2019The stone-cold logic of the Ogent family was also something that a human created. And as much as one would like to separate emotions from the equation, such a thing was simply not possible for humans.\u2018He\u2019s smart. In a sense, he\u2019s similar to dad.\u2019Nevertheless, the reason why he didn\u2019t dislike Shirone was because sincerity preceded calculation.\u2018Well, you never know. That\u2019s the power of sincerity. It makes you want to believe. And Shirone definitely has that power.\u2019Perhaps that was Shirone\u2019s greatest weapon, Reina thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySuddenly, a loud voice from the second floor was heard.\u201cHAHAHA! Such a masterpiece! I didn\u2019t expect to see this kind of a spectacle in my later years! Being young is indeed the best!\u201dThe startled maids screamed, while the family members sighed as they looked behind.There, an old man with blue hair stood, leaning against the balcony of the second floor.Shirone stared absent-mindedly.Even if Shirone were to consider this man as what Rian would eventually become, he couldn\u2019t imagine Rian having muscles that looked like they were about to explode.The old man was Rian\u2019s grandfather, Klumph Ogent.\u201cGrandfather!\u201dReina stood up with a look of happiness.Considering Reina and Rian were definitely not enough to persuade the black-haired Lord, he came at the perfect time.\u2018It\u2019s all good now. If it\u2019s grandfather\u2026\u2019Turning a blind eye to his daughter\u2019s expression, Bischoff asked.\u201cI see you\u2019ve arrived, father. I heard from Reina that it should have taken a few more days.\u201dChuckle!\u201cI came early because my friend ran away with a young maiden. Anyways, this place is as noisy as ever. As expected, youth is a fine thing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a good thing in this case. The face of our family has fallen to the ground.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not jump to conclusions here. I\u2019ve been watching behind the scenes for a bit now, and it\u2019s evident that everyone here has a lot they want to say. So, why don\u2019t we decide after hearing each other\u2019s opinions about whether we have lost face or not?\u201dReina screamed inside, \u2018Grandfather is the best!\u2019Although Klumph left the position as the Lord of the house to his son, his voice as a Grade 3 swordsman was still influential.Reina gained courage and stood up.\u201cI\u2019ll go first. Although I only met Shirone for the first time yesterday, I noticed he was a smart and talented child. Also, Shirone has completed all the contract requirements and was supposed to leave the house today. Given these circumstances, it\u2019s quite difficult to say that Shirone approached Rian with particularly malevolent intentions. Furthermore, I do not believe his actions have tarnished the family\u2019s reputation.\u201dWith her attitude packed with conviction, she sat down proudly.Though it was only now that the two opposing sides balanced, the tide still did not turn.Compared to those with black hair, it could be said that the bonds shared between those with blue hair was stronger. So Klumph, who was a previous Lord, was fair.Hence, Rai was given the floor to speak his opinion.\u201cWhat are your thoughts, my second grandson?\u201dRai replied in a polite, frosty tone.\u201cI do not like that kid.\u201dThe opinions of the servants were shaken once again by the remark of the family\u2019s most promising prospect.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to care anymore. This matter has nothing to do with me.\u201dBischoff asked him.\u201cWhat do you mean? You say you dislike him, but you don\u2019t want to be bothered anymore?\u201d\u201cExactly. I don\u2019t like that kid. But with the only reason being that I dislike him, I don\u2019t want to give false opinions. So I\u2019m just speaking the truth. I don\u2019t care because I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t care who Rian befirends, I simply want this matter to be done with so that we can head to the royal palace.\u201dReina held her tongue.Although he was her younger brother, he was egocentric to the core.However, at least in this instance, his personality seemed to work in Rian\u2019s favor.Klumph giggled like a schoolgirl.It amused him to see that his family members had their own unique personalities.\u201cThen to conclude, let\u2019s hear the opinion of the deputy butler who must\u2019ve observed the boy, Shirone, for the longest time.\u201dAs Temuran took a step forward, Louis sent a sidelong glance towards him, warning him that he had to pick the correct side here.What kind of words cannot be said between family members? But what was important to the servants was their masters\u2019 thoughts and preferences.\u201cShirone did the work I ordered him to do and he did it perfectly. \u201dLouis\u2019 forehead wrinkled.\u2018You can\u2019t even change up a few words or make up a lie. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t go higher and escape that position of yours as the deputy butler.\u2019\u201cDid you know that they were friends?\u201d\u201cI knew he was frequently hanging around with the youngest young master, but I did not know they were friends. But in my opinion, if he were such a child, I do not think he would have been able to sort those 10,000 books.\u201dShirone\u2019s eyes widened, as if surprised. He did not expect Temuran to speak of him that way. The head butler Louis stepped up.\u201cAre you taking sides now?\u201dThere was anger in his voice, but Temuran shook his head calmly.\u201cNo, I am also shocked that Shirone, a contract worker, managed to befriend the youngest young master. But as a deputy butler, I\u2019m only telling the truth.\u201dThis split the sides a bit.Bischoff was the only one who insisted on punishing Shirone, and even he, who was the Lord, could not ignore the rest of the family\u2019s opinion.After all, he became the Lord for his family.Rian let loose a breath as the tension left his body, and Shirone\u2019s expression as well seemed a bit lighter.\u201cI cannot approve.\u201dKlumph made the final decision.\u201cFather.\u201d\u201cGrandfather!\u201dBischoff and Rian shouted at the same time, but the reason why they called out were polar opposites.\u201cI understand that they recognize each other as friends. But it ends now. If the relationship continues, rumors will eventually spread and this might become a weakness for the political opponents to snatch and use against us. It is not good for Rian\u2019s future either. So just think that you guys built enough of those good memories together, and end the relationship here. I think that\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dOn the one hand, Reina was disappointed with her grandfather. But on the other hand, she also understood why.Family matters were important. In fact, they were more important than anything else.The family members were still active on duty, and above all, Rai had his certified exam coming up.It was their natural duty to get rid of any room for political strife.\u2018He should be grateful that he even gets to keep his life!\u2019But Rian\u2019s thinking was different.Klumph responded with a bright smile to his youngest grandson, whose eyes burnt with hostility.\u2018I see you\u2019ve got pretty splendid energy, Rian\u2019Although he understood the feelings of his grandson, who was the apple of his eyes, a lot of lives were at stake.No one objected to Klumph\u2019s opinion. The decision seemed to have been made by the looks of it.\u201cShirone, what do you think? I would like to thank you for teaching my naive grandson true friendship, but can you end it here? It\u2019s hard for nobles and commoners to be friends.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Shirone, who thought about it for a moment, spoke.\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201dHis unexpected answer shook not only Bischoff, but also Reina and Rai.But the one who was the most taken aback was Rian.\u201cSh-Shirone.\u201d\u201cIf I am a hindrance to Rian\u2019s future, I don\u2019t mind not seeing him ever again.

Right, Shirone?\u2019Rian raised his sword high and shouted.\u201cI declare\u2026\u201dReina\u2019s face was filled with anxiety.\u2018Don\u2019t do it.\u2019Rian was different from Shirone, when Rian became worked up, trouble always occurred.And her uneasiness was proven correct.Turning to Shirone, Rian stabbed his sword onto the floor before anyone could say anything.Rian knelt on one knee as his family stared blankly at the sword that pierced the marble floor.\u201cI, Rian Ogent, the third son of the Ogent family, will become Shirone\u2019s sword as of this time.\u201d\u201cWhat?! You fool!\u201dBischoff threw his image out the window as the Lord and shouted. Even if Rian really meant it, it wasn\u2019t something that should be said at his young age.With an absurd look, Reina asked him.\u201cDid you just take a knight\u2019s oath?\u201dA knight\u2019s oath.It was an oath that could not be overturned and was a decision one could only make if they were resolved enough\u2026 Resolved enough to become a sword for the one they swore to.Even in the noble society full of all sorts of slander, the reason why this oath was always kept was because honor was everything to a knight. The more honor a knight had, the longer their noble house could stand proud.Once in a lifetime. Rian had made that frightening promise to Shirone.Bischoff was speechless.The moment one took the knight\u2019s oath, it was impossible to withdraw it. Even if you don\u2019t go through the entirety of it, the minute one withdraws it, they become someone respected less than a rabid dog.\u201cRian, what in the world are you doing?\u201dShirone couldn\u2019t hide his shock, but Rian thought this was enough.\u201cYou thought I would choose not to see my friend forever? What do you think? Now, you\u2019re in a double bind.\u201dWhen Rian turned his head, his family saw something they had never seen before.\u2018Master, it looks like I made quite the splash this time around.\u2019However, to Klumph, it was refreshing nonetheless.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dKlumph rubbed his large chin.\u2018To be honest, I did not expect him to be this immature, but his actions do not annoy or anger me\u2026 He reminds me of myself.\u2019\u2018Well, if he\u2019s planning on being immature all the way through, might as well go all the way.\u2019Hiding his true feelings, Kumph asked sternly.\u201cRian, when you say you are going to be his sword, does that mean that boy has the qualifications?\u201d\u201cI believe he\u2019s overflowing with it.\u201d\u201cThen answer me this: Is he overflowing due to his own brilliance, or does he shine bright to you because you feel inadequate?\u201dRian thought.\u2018Is Shirone the one shining brilliantly, or does he simply shine because I feel inferior? Why did Grandpa ask this question?\u2019He replied.\u201cA sword does not judge. They simply protect.\u201dHe made a sound of admiration.Klumph was satisfied.\u2018Thank goodness his basics are strong!\u2019As Rian said, a sword does not think.Its only job was to cut in the direction its owner wanted.\u201cYou\u2019re quite good with your words. But with that lame swordsmanship of yours, I feel sorry for your friend who got a sword like you.\u201dRian shot daggers at him.\u201cGrandfather!\u201dOf course, all tension had dissipated at this point.It was partly because they went on a path no one could reverse, but more than that, it was more so because they did not have the energy to care anymore.Klumph felt that things came to a satisfying conclusion.\u201cAll right, that\u2019s it. Help that master of yours stand up. Oh, and Shirone, though he\u2019s not the most polished sword yet, he will never strike against you. Take good care of my grandson.\u201dShirone bowed his head. He felt that he had to at least show some respect, after all, his actions had damaged the pride of the Ogent family.\u201cThank you for your approval.\u201d\u201cIt was all him. I did nothing. I heard that you\u2019ve completed your work here? You\u2019re planning on going back home, correct?\u201d\u201cYes, my parents should be waiting.\u201d\u201cYou must miss them. However, since the two of you promised to be friends for life, it must be sad to go back like this. Hey, Louis.\u201d\u201cYes, your Grace.\u201d\u201cThe carriage that Shirone was supposed to take to get back home? Take his parents here instead.\u201d\u201cRight away.\u201dThe head butler immediately left the mansion.The situation with Shirone was no longer something he could deal with.Louis realized again at that moment that a noble\u2019s way of thinking was completely beyond his understanding.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Did you see their faces?! That felt sooooo good!\u201d\u201cBut are you really okay? That knight\u2019s oath\u2026 I think you overdid it because of me.\u201dRian\u2019s expression became serious. Despite how immature he was, he understood the weight of the knight\u2019s oath.\u201cShirone, I did not take the oath because you are my friend. You\u2019re different from my brother. You have the power to attract people.\u201dShirone felt the sincerity.But listening to such praise made him feel awkward, so to lift the mood a bit, he tried to joke around.\u201cHaha! I feel too much pressure. But if you want to protect me, you\u2019ll have to improve by several folds.\u201dRian flinched.\u201cHey, don\u2019t poke where it hurts. I already know that. By the way, you surprised me there. Saying what you wanted to say in front of my whole family. Weren\u2019t you scared?\u201d\u201cHehe, there\u2019s a secret to that.\u201dShirone explained how he imagined jumping off a cliff, which he realized before his sword battle with Rian.Thinking it would be of some help towards improving his swordsmanship, Rian was puzzled once he heard the story.\u201cJumping off a cliff? Why would you do that? Are you perhaps\u2026 An idiot?\u201d\u201c\u2026An idiot?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t believe Rian called him an idiot.\u201cNo, just listen carefully. I don\u2019t mean you should actually jump off a cliff. Simply imagine it. You aren\u2019t dead until you fall flat on the ground. It means that you need to focus on the present instead of needlessly imagining the future.\u201d\u201cBut if you jump off, you\u2019re dead. It\u2019s you who needs to think it over. If you jump, you\u2019re as good as dead.\u201d\u201cArgh, seriously! If you don\u2019t even jump off the cliff, ultimately, you\u2019ll end up not being able to do anything!\u201d\u201cAha, then I can do it. For example, I would jump without any hesitation to save you. Because that\u2019s what a knight does.\u201dShirone blinked.It was completely different from what he wanted to convey, but he thought that was who Rian was.\u2018You really are the polar opposite of me.\u2019At that moment, someone came in. Someone who he thought he would never meet again.As Reina peeked her head inside the room, she let out a small sigh. Shirone\u2019s face flushed at the sight of her.\u201cHi. The atmosphere on the opponent\u2019s side was too fierce, so I came to my ally\u2019s base to evacuate.\u201d\u201cGet out. We were having a man-to-man talk.\u201dShirone waved his hands around hurriedly as Rian was sending Reina away.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, Rian? Your sister helped out a lot. You're welcome to come in, Reina.\u201d\u201cHey, you just don\u2019t understand. That witch must be\u2026\u201dRian, who was spitting out slander, thought for a while and closed his mouth.Shirone and Reina. Reina and Shirone. Those two names were coming and going in his head.Reina came closer, walking briskly like a cat, and sat between the two.\u201cAnyways. Rian, you were pretty cool back there. I can\u2019t believe you took out the knight\u2019s oath card. I really can\u2019t beat you.\u201d\u201cHow come you sound like you\u2019re teasing me?\u201d\u201cHeheh, did I get caught?\u201d\u201cAre you serious?! Why the hell are you even here?! Did you just come here to annoy me?!\u201d\u201cWhat do you take me for? I just accomplished my job as the spy of the team. There\u2019s a pretty serious conversation going on over there on the opponent\u2019s side.\u201d\u201cWhat can be worse than what just happened?\u201d\u201cActually, dad was thinking of sending you, along with Rai, to the palace.\u201dIt was Rian\u2019s first time hearing this.Besides, despite the fact he was a genius, nobody knew whether Rai would get the approval, so why would he tag along?\u201cWhat are you talking about? They want me to go on a field trip or something?\u201d\u201cNo, they want to enroll you into the Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy. You know, the largest one in the Kingdom of Thormia? The academy that produced 10 certified Grade 1 swordsmen in 200 years?\u201d\u201cWhat? Why did you guys decide that without discussing it with me? I thought I could play around with Shirone as much as I liked, but now I have to go to an academy? What about my Master?\u201d\u201cYour instructor already knows. That\u2019s why he ended his contract yesterday and went back to his hometown this morning. I heard you guys even said your goodbyes. You didn\u2019t know about this?\u201dRian looked at Kite\u2019s sword. It was thanks to this sword that he was able to carry out his will.\u2018Master!\u2019He was someone who cared about Rian more than anybody else.The reason why he ended the contract with no opposition was because he wanted his student to grow a bit more.\u201cBut this is too sudden. What about Shirone?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why the family is talking. They are thinking about sending you and Shirone to the academy together. You said yesterday that Shirone is better at wielding a sword than you.\u201dShirone was startled.Due to Rian\u2019s personality, he wouldn\u2019t have spoken about it first, and Reina seemed to be puzzled by this too.\u2018Why me\u2026\u2019While delusional ideas and thoughts flashed through Shirone\u2019s head, Rian was thinking more realistically.\u201cWell, that\u2019s true. But Shirone\u2019s not going to the swordsmanship academy. There\u2019s something else he wants to do. Actually, I was thinking about something\u2026 But since it has come to this, you should ask our grandfather for something.\u201d\u201cHuh? What do you mean?\u201dReina turned her head to face Shirone, but Shirone didn\u2019t open his mouth. It was not something he could openly talk about.In the first place, it was unrealistic to even try and enroll a commoner in a swordsmanship academy.However, no one in the Ogent family was currently opposed to supporting Shirone.Since Rian had made his knight\u2019s oath, even if it was only for the honor of the Ogent family, Shirone had to succeed. He had to become someone special.When Rian saw Shirone\u2019s hesitation, Rian spoke up in his stead.\u201cBecause Shirone is going to become a mage. He\u2019s not interested in swordsmanship.\u201dReina\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cWhat? A mage? So you actually lost to an aspirant mage in a sword fight? Rian\u2026 That\u2019s pathetic.\u201d\u201cShut up! I know! But Shirone is really a genius! I\u2019m positive he\u2019d be a lot better than Rai if he were a swordsman.\u201d\u201cOho, he\u2019s that strong?\u201dRian was not the type to disparage even his enemies, so to him, Shirone looked different. Special.\u201cN-No. How could I\u2026\u201dSensing Reina\u2019s gaze, Shirone didn\u2019t know where to look, so he ended up lowering his eyes.\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll propose that to the other side. But you might still be enrolled in the swordsmanship academy, Rian. Dad is someone who uses his opponents\u2019 weaknesses thoroughly.\u201d\u201cTsk! Whatever. I\u2019ll think about it.\u201dAfter all, for the sake of his master, he would not only take on the academy, but an army if need be.\u2018Actually, this is important to me, too!\u2019He won\u2019t be able to protect Shirone with his current sword skills.Following a knock, a butler entered.\u201cYoung master Shirone\u2019s family has just arrived. They are supposed to be escorted to the mansion, but if the young master would like to greet them, I was ordered by the Lord to guide you to them.\u201dRian slapped his knee.\u201cOh! Shirone\u2019s parents? What do you want to do, Shirone?\u201dThe answer was obvious.Shirone was bouncing up and down in excitement, his eyes were already stuck in the direction of the front gate of the mansion.Chuckling, Reina told him.\u201cBring them here, Shirone. My family will be waiting in the living room. Please, lead Shirone to his family.\u201d\u201cRight away, miss.\u201dShirone followed the butler out of the mansion.\u201cThis way. The stairs are high, so please be careful.\u201dThe butler\u2019s attitude made him uncomfortable. Just a day ago, they didn\u2019t even bother with him, but now? They were treating him like a noble.\u201cExcuse me, you can just act the usual way you do. It\u2019s not like I became a nobleman or something.\u201d\u201cNo! Please don\u2019t say that. My head may fall off.\u201dShirone, who once risked his life for mere books, knew the stress servants experienced better than anyone else.\u201cEven if you make a mistake, I won\u2019t tell anyone, so don\u2019t be like that.\u201dThe butler\u2019s eyes showed a bit of relief, but he was still on his toes.\u2018No matter.\u2019Shirone didn\u2019t care anymore. No he couldn\u2019t care less.This was because a carriage arrived at the end of the Broad Way.When he saw his parents\u2019 faces, his vision got blurry. The tears he suppressed while living in such an uncomfortable environment poured out.Not even hearing the butler\u2019s shout, Shirone ran towards the front gate.\u201cMom! Dad!\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Shirone took his parents to the reception room. Their eyes were swollen. They could not hold in their emotions.It took them some time to get their emotions together.The meeting was pushed back, perhaps due to Klumph\u2019s consideration, and due to this, Shirone was able to release the emotions that he had bottled up inside.\u201cLet me take a look at you, son. Your face is all pinched and worn out. I can tell you\u2019ve been through much, my son. You did a good job. Such a good job.\u201dTears formed in Vincent\u2019s eyes once again.Shirone\u2019s complexion had actually improved, but from his parents\u2019 perspective, it looked like he didn\u2019t eat or sleep enough during his stay here.\u201cIt wasn't bad, I was able to read a lot of books. I had a lot of fun. How have you been, father? Everything has been good, I hope?\u201d\u201cOf course! We\u2019ve both been doing well. Well, maybe a bit too well, perhaps? Look at your mom. She ended up becoming so pretty that you almost ended up having a younger brother.\u201d\u201cHoney, what are you blabbering on about in front of our son?\u201dShirone smiled ruefully.His parents were much thinner compared to when he left.How would they be able to eat properly when they were busy worrying about their child everyday?When he considered those thoughts, he choked up again.Suddenly, Vincent became curious.At first, he was very nervous thinking something had happened to his son. But after seeing Shirone\u2019s relaxed form, he felt like nothing bad had occurred.\u201cSo, why were we brought here? If you finished your work, you should have been allowed to come home right away. Surely they aren\u2019t stopping you from going back, right?\u201d\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s nothing like that. It\u2019s just that I managed to take advantage of a nice opportunity.\u201d\u201cHm? A nice opportunity?\u201dShirone told them the story of what had happened this morning.He was able to tell them the story without any trouble because he had already put together an outline of how he should tell the story in his head.But from the listener\u2019s standpoint, the story was so mind-blowing that it left them speechless.As Vincent continued to listen, he became more and more astonished.To be honest, he stopped listening to Shirone past a certain point.He couldn\u2019t comprehend what his son was talking about.He became friends with the youngest young master of the Ogent family? And that same person promised a knight\u2019s oath to him? Furthermore, the family accepted it and allowed them to carry on being friends?The story continued to break apart his common sense, it felt like thunder was reverberating inside his head.When the story came to an end, Vincent scratched his head in silence.He knew he was a smart and bright kid. But even so, this story made no sense.Maybe something went wrong inside his brain? Did he go delusional after being tormented here for a long time?\u201cShirone, be honest with me. This dad can, and will, do anything for you. What in the world happened to you? Who the heck made you like this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all true, dad. Why would I lie about something this?\u201d\u201cOkay! You are not a liar. So tell me, who bullied you?! Who treated you harshly?!\u201dVincent was genuinely angry.He\u2019s heard of numerous cases where commoners were wrongly entangled with nobles and became forever handicapped.Even Shirone thought the story was ridiculous, but he couldn\u2019t think of a better way to explain it to them.While he was stuck between a rock and a hard place, trying to think of a way to answer, the Ogent family entered the reception room.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m Bischoff Ogent, the family head.\u201dKlumph and Rai did not come, but instead, Rian and Reina accompanied him.Rian bravely stepped forward.\u201cHello, father! I am Rian, Shirone\u2019s sword. In time, I will become the best swordsman in the world. Hahaha!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Reina, Rian\u2019s older sister. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201dAfter staring blankly for a while, Vincent quickly realized the situation and lowered his head.\u201cHello! I\u2019m Shirone\u2019s father. Why are such important people, such as yourselves, here\u2026?\u201d\u201cOh my, did you not hear from Shirone?\u201d\u201cYes? What do you mean?\u201dThe only thing that came to Vincent\u2019s mind was his son\u2019s nonsensical story.\u201cSo you\u2019re saying the story is true?\u201d\u201cOh, I see. We should have come sooner. Anyways, what Shirone said is true. My little brother, Rian, and Shirone are bonded together due to the knight\u2019s oath. That\u2019s why we called for you two.\u201dWhen Vincent became aware that the whole story was true, his heart skipped a beat.His joy was brief as fear rushed in, quickly replacing it. How could his innocent son cause this much trouble? What was he thinking?\u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s eat. We can talk about the details after.\u201dBischoff turned around after their short conversation.Bischoff was not particularly friendly, so Rian could only imagine how uncomfortable Shirone's parents felt.Even after the rest of the Ogent family left, Vincent could not leave his spot for a while. Only when Shirone slightly pulled him by his shirt did he come back to his senses. Once that happened, he headed for the living room.\u2018Is this real? Our Shirone? Staying with the Ogent family?\u2019Everything confused him, and Olina, still terrified of the situation, grabbed onto her husband\u2019s arm tightly. But little did Olina know that even Vincent was terrified. His legs were shaking as if they were leaves being ravaged by the wind. He couldn\u2019t even walk properly.\u2018NO!\u2019Vincent shook his head.If Shirone\u2019s words were true, he could not show any weakness. For his son, he had to stay strong.Various delicacies were placed on the square dining table. Even Vincent, who was a hunter, saw foods he had never seen before. The ingredients were transported from the royal palace by Reina.As for the seating arrangement, it went according to one\u2019s rank. Lord of the house, Bischoff, sat at the head of the table, on his left sat Klumph, while Reina was at his right.Seated at the very end of the table, Vincent was finally snapped out of his stupor when he saw the delicacies in front of him. Head butler, Louis, and deputy butler, Temuran, unconsciously puffed out their chest in pride.But Vincent couldn\u2019t openly show his enthusiasm. He had to save face for his son. He had to finish the meal quietly, but his eyes couldn\u2019t help it. When he saw over seven different dishes around him, his eyes twinkled.Most commoners were able to eat whole boars with just a fork. However, the dishes in front of Vincent were all of different sizes. There were even foods in shapes he had never seen before.Although the Vincent family could not take their first bite, the butlers and maids made no move to help them. This was because acting rashly in this unprecedented situation will only harm them.Of course, such a decision was also mixed with a little contempt for the Vincent family.Bischoff placed down his tableware and spoke.\u201cEat comfortably. You do not have to follow the formalities of the nobility.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cFormality is just a discipline necessary to put respect into action. Seeing as how you are having a hard time, and considering my family and I can sense enough of your respect and consideration, please eat comfortably.\u201dVincent slightly shuddered.Whether it was true sincerity or the pride of a noble, from the family\u2019s perspective, his words showed great kindness and favor.Then the maids\u2019 faces turned pale.The Ogent family\u2019s feelings toward Shirone were genuine. They were really thinking of accepting Shirone.The bewildered maids hurriedly taught the Vincent family how to use the tableware.In fact, it only looked complicated, but in reality, how could using utensils and eating be complicated? The Vincent family, who now had an inkling on how to use the utensils, finally ate comfortably.After all that trouble, Vincent was worried about his son this time. What was this family going to do to Shirone?He had heard an explanation of what the knight\u2019s oath was, but that made no difference to what Vincent was thinking.Shirone was still the son of a mountaineer, and aside from the fact he was brilliant, his future was not guaranteed.Did they perhaps have something else up their sleeves?He didn\u2019t want to doubt the people who did his child a favor. But he did not want to risk anything in regards to his son.\u201cI\u2019m grateful that you are thinking of him in a good light, but at the same time, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not worried. Isn\u2019t the Ogent family one of the most prestigious ones in Creas? And I still can\u2019t believe that a young master of such a family made a knight\u2019s oath to Shirone.\u201d\u201cHaha! You don\u2019t have to worry. Shirone and I\u2026\u201dBischoff cut Rian off.\u201cIf I am to speak honestly, it is a little unpleasant.\u201dThe room suddenly became quiet at Bischoff\u2019s statement, But Bischoff continued to eat with the knife in his hand.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cBut it\u2019s a knight\u2019s oath. A knight's oath is a sacred thing, especially in a family like ours. It binds people together for life. If I were to keep holding on to these unpleasant feelings just because the only difference between us is status, that would tarnish Rian's pride. So don\u2019t be too uncomfortable by it as we will continue to use honorifics in the future.\u201dShirone realized.Bischoff was a cold and cruel man. A man cold and cruel enough to demand the execution of a commoner\u2026 But only for the sake of his family. His loyalty towards his family was beyond imagination.\u2018Fighting for their beliefs. That is nobility.\u2019Now that he couldn\u2019t choose an easy path, all he had to do was fight against the world.\u2018There will be innumerable difficulties and criticisms\u2026 But I\u2019m not afraid.\u2019This, too, was the pride of the Ogent.Klumph spoke while chuckling.\u201cIt has been quite a bit since our family head has said something right. But won\u2019t you die of loneliness if you send your last son away just like that? Why not just spend another year before doing that?\u201dBischoff was not provoked.\u201cRai has unlocked Schema as well as learned the swordsmanship of Ogent. Hence why he is more than likely to win official approval. On the other hand, Rian has yet to unlock his Schema. I have no choice but to enroll him in this Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy.\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re subtly taking the black-haired approach. However, we blue-hairs have passion, and that passion never withers away. If you look down at our burning passion, you will be in for a rude awakening.\u201dWhile munching on a lamb, Rian sent a thumbs up to his grandfather.Bischoff snorted. His father\u2019s playfulness was nothing new.\u201cHair color does not matter to me. As long as they have the same blood flowing in their veins, they are family. And that family is\u2026\u201dSitting up straight in their chairs, all the family members placed down their utensils and spoke in union.\u201cOgent.\u201d* * *After the meal, everyone returned to the living room and sat down.They began to discuss Shirone's situation.Reina broke the news that Shirone was interested in learning magic, which everyone agreed was alright. Due to his physique and his tendencies, Shirone would eventually reach a ceiling in terms of swordsmanship.Unlike the friendly atmosphere Klumph had during the meal, he told Vincent with a serious expression.\u201cAs you know, our family intends to support Shirone. It sounds like he wants to become a mage, so we\u2019re thinking of sending him to Alpheas Magic Academy. The academy is also one of the top five prestigious academies in the Kingdom of Tormia. The Headmaster, Headmaster Alpheas, is also an old friend of mine. It\u2019s an institution appointed by the kingdom, so if one graduates from there, they will receive an unofficial license\u2026 Which means they can become a mage.\u201d\u201cM-Mage\u2026\u201dVincent gulped.Mages were symbols of intelligence, so needless to say, most were nobles. However, it was a very unique occupation as, due to the ability-based nature of it, status did not dictate how far one could reach. And once they earned their license, they were highly sought after everywhere.In the world, there were country bumpkins who realized magic on their own. There were also commoners who learned magic by learning under a mage.Those kinds of people typically became mercenaries. However, there was also the alternative of getting a job in an association and obtaining a mage\u2019s license that way.Though, of course, those cases were extremely rare. And so for commoners, becoming a mage was merely a fantasy.But it wasn\u2019t merely a fantasy for Shirone\u2026 And as such, the offer wasn\u2019t something Vincent could refuse.As Olina was moved to tears, Shirone embraced his mother.It was a warm sight, but unexpectedly, Klumph\u2019s face was gloomy.Clearly, the fastest way to become a mage was to enter a magic academy\u2026 But the problem was status.Unlike other routes, a magic academy strictly allowed only nobility to enter for the most part. And despite the fact there was special admission for exceptional talents, to cut past that standard was like finding a needle in a haystack.Trying to achieve this was not easy, even for the Ogent family who was the 2nd-class noble in the kingdom.In fact, the magic academy also regularly got enrollment requests from the 1st-class family.\u201cAs you may already know, Shirone\u2019s current status does not qualify him for the magic academy. Even if we do aid him in terms of school materials, fees, and other such expenses, there will still be problems with getting him accepted.\u201dVincent snapped out of his dream.\u201cAh, of course\u2026 I know. Yes\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201dDisappointment and shame tinged Vincent\u2019s voice.\u2018My son was acknowledged by a noble family\u2026 But he can\u2019t enter the academy because of my status\u2026\u2019\u201cThere is one way. No, it\u2019s actually the only way.\u201dVincent\u2019s head snapped up. Shirone, too, paid close attention as it was his first time hearing this.\u201cI would like to adopt Shirone into our family.\u201dSilence ruled the living room.Klumph\u2019s proposal sounded wrong\u2026 But in actuality, it was not a bad proposal.To be the child of a mountaineer\u2026 Or a child of the Ogent\u2026 It was a no-brainer which one was better.Nevertheless, the reason why Vincent felt reluctant to speak was none other than the problem with bloodline.Vincent studied Shirone.His son\u2019s expression, while a little obnoxious, was still calm.He couldn\u2019t figure out whether his son\u2019s expression was like that because he thought his father would obviously accept the proposal, or because he thought the proposal was too preposterous.Bischoff continued after Klumph.\u201cWe discussed this between ourselves, and we concluded that this was the best option. I have a cousin who does not have any children yet. If he registers as part of my cousin\u2019s family, Shirone will become a noble and will be able to enter the academy. It\u2019s merely a matter of paperwork, so nothing much will change.\u201d\u2018Merely a matter of paperwork\u2026 Is it really that simple? Everything in the world is a matter of paperwork.\u2019To be honest, Vincent was not confident.\u2018Am I confident enough to say that I won\u2019t be sad if I see Shirone registered as a son of another family?\u2019\u2018Shirone, say something. What choice does this dad have to make? What do you really want?\u2019Vincent looked back miserably at his son.Then Shirone\u2019s brows furrowed. Vincent had a hunch that it was because he was frustrated that his father had no answer.As this was a sensitive issue, everyone was careful with their words. It was Reina who broke the ice as she came forward and asked Shirone.\u201cShirone, what do you think? It\u2019s just paperwork. You will get to achieve your dream and become a nobleman on top of that. Of course, your parents will still be your parents. Nothing will change.\u201dHis frown deepened. And as if he could not understand all this, he said\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThis is utter nonsense. Clearly, I am my father\u2019s son. There will be no instances where I will be adopted as a son of another.\u201d\u201cSh-Shirone.\u201dVincent was touched.He said it with no hesitation, and even his tone was layered with disgust as if just thinking about it was unpleasant.While the rest of his family members were dumbfounded, Klumph asked coldly.\u201cAre you completely sure you are okay with that? You have the chance to become a noble. This isn\u2019t an opportunity anyone can just get.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m required to become the son of another, I would rather live as a commoner.\u201d\u201cCommoners cannot enter the magic academy.\u201d\u201cThen I will not enter.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t get into the magic academy, you can\u2019t become a mage.\u201d\u201cThen I won\u2019t become a mage.\u201d\u201cShirone!\u201dKlumph stood abruptly from his seat.Shirone\u2019s upright attitude was frustrating.\u2018Other times, he is such a smart boy, so why now, of all times, is he so hung up on such a simple problem?\u2019\u201cIs it guilt? Living in this world is no picnic. There are things you have to sacrifice for success. Is that dream of yours that insignificant to you?Simply looking up the large build of Klumph must have felt overwhelming, but Shirone replied calmly.\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo matter how small or big my dream may be, that is something I inherited from my parents. They were the roots that nurtured me and allowed me to dream. I mean, look at me, the child of a mountaineer working in a mansion. And even before all that, reading\u2026 It\u2019s because of them I can read. If I must make a comparison, this one opportunity I have right now does not even come close to standing alongside the countless other ones my parents have handed me. Telling me to deny my roots and to be nurtured by another is no different from telling me to wither and die.\u201dSilence enveloped the living room.They weren\u2019t simply impressed by Shirone\u2019s words\u2026 He made them reflect.Klumph was very shocked.\u2018It\u2019s not guilt. He understands the way we humans grow.\u2019Even if one were to miss an opportunity right in front of their eyes, new ones would eventually turn up.However, the moment one abandons the people who helped them get to where they are, they lose everything.Suddenly he had this idea.Maybe he was thinking incorrectly from the start? Even without someone\u2019s help, wouldn\u2019t this child eventually become a mage?\u2018Rian, maybe it was you who was the lucky one.\u2019\u2018If even the honor of the Ogent family is just a passing opportunity for this child\u2026\u2019\u2018Then no one can restrain this child!\u2019After a long time, since no one bothered to open their mouth, only then did Shirone smile.\u201cI am grateful for the proposal. But I can\u2019t accept it. The only ones who I can call my parents are the two people here right now.\u201dVincent clenched his fists hard.He was embarrassed. He wanted to crawl under his chair and never come back up.\u2018Why feel hurt by meaningless documents? My son believes in me, a parent who has done nothing for him.\u2019\u201cShirone\u2026\u201d\u201cFather.\u201dVincent\u2019s head hung down.\u201cPlease, take Shirone as an adopted son!\u201dNo one thought of him as a lacking parent because they, too, had a family of their own.However, this was not a simple matter that could be solved by being persistent.\u201cI understand how you feel, but it can\u2019t be helped. How can I turn blind eye to Shirone\u2019s heart?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, Shirone\u2026 Shirone is not actually my child.\u201d\u201cHoney!\u201dEyes widened after Vincent\u2019s remark, but out of everyone, Shirone was the most shocked.It wasn\u2019t because it was kept a secret, in fact, everyone in the room had thought about it at least once.Shirone looked completely different from his parents. Both in appearance and physique.However, despite not being blood-related, for the sake of his son, Vincent was ready to give up everything.\u201cWe cannot have children. Shirone is a child that was given to us by coincidence. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a child of nobility, as you would have assumed living with him. I am not worthy of him. On the contrary, if he becomes an adopted son of a noble, it\u2019s like returning him back to his original position. He won\u2019t be denying his roots.\u201dSeeing the reasoning behind his words, the gathered people thought over it.But breaking their thoughts, Shirone shouted with a very hurt look.\u201cDad!\u201d\u201cSh-Shirone.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?! How could you say that without discussing it?! You\u2019ve never said anything about that before!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Shirone. But since you\u2019re now grown up, to some extent\u2014\u201d\u201cDo you know why I didn\u2019t ask? Because everyone only gets one father and one mother. How many parents are you going to make for me? It\u2019s to the point where I\u2019m about to have six parents because of you, father.\u201dVincent was stunned.Two of the adoptive parents, two of themselves, and two of those who abandoned Shirone. A total of six. If he was to think that way, what he was about to do to his child was ridiculous.\u201cI\u2019m just sad that you are giving up your dream because of me\u2026\u201d\u201cWho said I\u2019m giving up on my dream? If I continue to work hard, another opportunity will surely arise! Do you know how it feels to be abandoned twice?!\u201dAs soon as he saw his son\u2019s eyes fill with tears, Vincent realized his mistake.\u201cShirone, I\u2019m sorry! What in the world did I do? I won\u2019t ever leave you under the care of someone else. I will do everything to make your dream come true!\u201d\u201cDad!\u201dAs Vincent pulled him in for a firm hug, Shirone wiped away his tears and jumped into his father\u2019s arms.How upset he must have been, a thoughtful child who didn\u2019t even express his own emotions, in fear he would hurt someone.While the Ogent family watched with pleased faces, it was Bischoff who was particularly swayed by the scene.He was a father who had to raise four sons and a daughter alone as his wife \u2018left\u2019 without him.Bischoff quietly told Klumph.\u201cI have no choice but to ask you to use a bit of your strength.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re asking for all sorts of things from this old man. How would I use my strength? Even the scholars, who are quick-witted, are all tongue-tied under Alpheas\u2019 obstinacy.\u201dEven though Klumph was whining about it, his expression wasn\u2019t particularly dark.\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to give an order as the family head. How about going through with a special admission? I\u2019ve heard there is an old debt\u2026\u201d\u201cHmph! Alpheas? That guy? You think he only owes me one? The problem is, he\u2019s not one to break the rules.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s not possible?\u201d\u201cWell, who knows? Aren\u2019t reckless tactics best used against principled men?\u201dBischoff smiled silently.This was because he remembered the circumstances in which he was forced to take over the family due to such reckless tactics.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Shirone stayed in the Ogent family until the day Rian left for the Swordsmanship Academy.Shirone, as well, did not know if his special admission would pass. But even if he were to pass, he would enter the school early next year, so he still had six months to spend with his parents.A few days later, an antique-like carriage was stationed near the main gate, waiting to depart.It was a carriage that would take the family to the royal castle.Rai was already on board, and Klumph decided to meet with Alpheas first and join them later.Rian, who did not want to say goodbye, could not hold back his tears.Whether it was a magic academy or a swordsmanship academy, the period of graduating from one was not specifically set.If one failed the graduation exam, getting stuck in an academy for years was not an impossibility. So if they were to split now, there was no set date as to when they could meet again.Rian grabbed Shirone\u2019s shoulder.\u201cShirone, you must become a mage! I\u2019ll write you letters!\u201d\u201cOkay, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re never seeing each other again, and we can also come back from time to time. Stop crying.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m certain you can graduate! I guarantee it!\u201dReina socked him in the head.\u201cFor crying out loud! Worry about yourself! You\u2019re the one we are all worried about the most!\u201d\u201cHey! I\u2019m going to work hard, too, you know! I\u2019ll become the best knight and become Shirone\u2019s sword.\u201dShirone believed his words and had no doubts. He was sure Rian would do well.Although he was no genius like Rai, he possessed things that Rai did not.Reina turned to Shirone and smiled.\u201cShirone, you don\u2019t have to worry, have fun with your family for the time being. I\u2019m sure my grandfather will get you enrolled in the academy. He\u2019s someone who keeps his word.\u201d\u201cYes. And\u2026 Thank you for your help.\u201dShirone spoke with sincerityEven if he was friends with Rian, things wouldn\u2019t have worked out this well without Reina\u2019s support.Reina stared at Shirone.\u2018He really is a unique child!\u2019At first, she only thought of him as a boy four years younger than her, but she changed her mind after the incident.He may not have grown up physically yet, but his mind was already something to marvel at.And above all, the fact that Shirone was interested in her was very important.\u201cShirone, do you\u2026\u201dJust as Reina was about to say something, she stopped and started laughing as she realized just how absurd the idea was.\u2018Just 16-years-old\u2026 His future's so bright.\u2019\u2018If Shirone gets into the magic academy, he will meet so many talented people. And his eyes\u2026 his eyes will surely change\u2026\u2019\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. Let\u2019s work hard, both of us. I also think you can become a mage.\u201d\u201cYes, please take good care of Rian.\u201d\u201cHaha, don\u2019t worry. Since he\u2019s made his oath, he will do his best. I don\u2019t need to nag him.\u201dReina looked back at Shirone one more time. She waved, and got into the carriage.As soon as the four horses stomped out, Rian opened the window and stuck his head out.\u201cShirone! You are the best! When you get into the magic academy, crush them all!\u201dShirone waved his hand big.\u201cYou too! Be sure to graduate!\u201dThus, his life as a worker for the Ogent\u2019s ended.\u201cHooo.\u201dWhen he finally grasped that it was over, his heart felt a little heavy.The Broad Way of the Ogent family, which intimidated him when he first arrived, now felt like something that wished him good luck.\u201cYoung master, let's go. I\u2019ll escort you home.\u201dSeeing the carriage waiting, Shirone finally realized\u2026He was really going home.Shirone bowed his head towards the Ogent family\u2019s mansion.\u201cThank you.\u201d* * *Alpheas Magic Academy, Noon.Despite the fact it was class time, there were two old men who sat opposite each other, both drinking tea in the headmaster\u2019s office.A large, blue-haired man and another who wore a gentle smile while looking out the window.Alpheas Myrhe and Klumph Ogent. Both have been friends for over 50 yearsThe conversation between the two had stopped over half an hour ago.To be more specific, it was Klumph who was waiting for Alpheas\u2019 answer.He didn\u2019t care how long it took.It was Alpheas\u2019 turn to answer, so Klumph was just waiting.\u201cEven if it\u2019s from you, I can\u2019t do you any favors of that kind.\u201dConsidering how long it took for such a short answer, most would\u2019ve been frustrated by it, but Klumph just grinned.He dragged on, as if making a difficult decision, but in truth, he must have done that for show\u2026Because the Alpheas he knew was mischievous like that.\u201c\u2018Even if it\u2019s from you\u2019? Do you know how much I suffered because of you when we were young?\u201d\u201cKAHAHA! For such \u2018flattery\u2019 to leave your mouth, you must be in quite a hurry. But you have to know, the special admission was not made just to become a free pass for nobles. Countless requests are made every year, but most do not meet the heavy criteria.\u201d\u201cKeukeuh, how funny. A free pass for nobles\u2026 But this is different.\u201dAlpheas became slightly uneasy.The tactless and stubborn Klumph\u2019s eyes were full of mischief, warning Alpheas that whatever he was thinking of was not ordinary.\u201c...What is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to accept some scoundrel. It\u2019s actually the opposite. He is a friend of my youngest grandson, and he\u2019s very talented. I see the young you in him.\u2019Recalling his past, Alpheas\u2019 eyes dimmed, as he realized that time truly did pass quickly.\u201cHmm, your youngest grandson\u2026 You mean that immature and reckless Rian? He\u2019s very much like you.\u201d\u201cKekeke! I threw him into a swordsmanship academy because he\u2019s not talented enough. Anyways, I\u2019m not here to talk about Rian. I\u2019m here to talk about Rian\u2019s friend.\u201d\u201cIf he\u2019s that talented, why not just enroll him in the academy normally\u2026? But since you\u2019re here, I imagine there\u2019s a reason why you can\u2019t just do that. \u201d\u201cIndeed, there is a problem. A big one. He\u2019s not a noble.\u201dAlpheas\u2019 eyebrows narrowed slightly. A short, but intense memory from four years ago flashed through his mind.\u201cNo way\u2026 Is he perhaps a blonde, blue-eyed boy?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis time, it was Klumph\u2019s turn to be surprised. He always thought this, but Alpheas was a friend who knew how to play with people.\u201cHuh? I did hear that when the path of magic opens up, you gain the ability of foresight. I guess it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I just had a short interaction with him before\u2026 He left a pretty strong impression.\u201dAs rare as it was to encounter such a man of talent around the world, it was even more uncommon to discover someone as talented as Shirone in the magic academy.Moreover, he could guarantee that Shirone was the only commoner who was in the city of Creas.\u201cSo that is what happened\u2026\u201dAlpheas briefly described his encounter with Shirone who, at the time, was 12 years old.After Alpheas finished his story, Klumph began talking about how Shirone joined the Ogent family.\u201cHmm\u2026 Shirone Arian.\u201dAlpheas went silent again. But this time, he was actually deep in thought.Klumph spoke.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just take him in? Who knows, maybe it is fate. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d\u201cFate is a foolish word and concept. Humans shape their own futures. If you deem whatever happens to you as fate, then at that point, \u2018fate\u2019 controls your life. You give up trying because whatever happens is \u2018fated\u2019 to be.It didn\u2019t work this time either.Klumph pursed his lips.On one side, his heart pained. It was because he understood his friend\u2019s dilemma.\u201cYou\u2026 still haven\u2019t forgiven yourself?\u201dAlpheas went quiet.\u201cDespite the sharp stares of the nobles, you probably opened the special admission because of your regret over your youth. But you\u2019ve done enough. You have already raised countless prodigies, so stop dishonoring yourself. Forgive yourself and let go.\u201d\u201cHuhuhu, there exists arrogance when forgiving oneself. I was someone who trashed the precious talent gifted by god. It\u2019s not something that can be forgiven. I\u2019m just hoping that a person like me will never appear again.\u201dKlumph let out a deep sigh.Alpheas was a certified Grade 4 mage and was the headmaster of a prestigious academy, but he was not someone who should\u2019ve stopped there. He was a genius.\u2018If only that incident never happened\u2026\u2019\u201cKeukeuh. Well, in the past, even I found you ridiculously full of yourself. The Myrhe family\u2019s light. For a genius who might only appear once every blue moon to be acting as an old headmaster of an academy\u2026 How funny.\u201dWith age, one learns to embrace and accept pain, so Alpheas gave no heed to Klumph despite his harsh words.\u201cChuckle! On the other hand, you received the help of god. Who would\u2019ve thought that a once talentless idiot would become a 3rd-class swordsman? I\u2019m quite worried for the future of this kingdom.\u201dThe two broke out cackling.Talent and effort\u2026 It was fair to say that Klumph won in terms of those elements. Alpheas admired him and was simply proud to have Klumph as a friend.\u201cI\u2019ve thought about this more and more as I\u2019ve gotten older, but I believe \u2018genius\u2019 is just a man-made delusion. \u2018Geniuses\u2019 are only people who just enjoy something a bit more than most people do\u2026 Can that boy comfort me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s something only you would know the answer to, my friend. \u201dAlpheas walked to the window with a smile.\u2018So in the end, does it all come back?\u2019The talent blocked by a barrier called status had once again appeared in front of Alpheas after four years.He believed there was no such thing as fate. The future was something that could change and was not pre-determined.But Alpheas felt a sudden thrill course through his body.Perhaps\u2026 Fate was real?\u201c\u2026I will accept Shirone into the academy.\u201d* * *Spring arrived.With flowers in full bloom around Vincent\u2019s cabin, Shirone patiently awaited for the entrance ceremony.Shirone\u2019s admission to the magic academy was a family celebration, so Vincent did not tell anyone about it.The reason was because he did not want to trouble Shirone in case rumors of it started cropping up.And Shirone was grateful for it.The reason why they rejected the Ogent family\u2019s offer to get a house in the city was because Shirone\u2019s parents did not want to bother their son.The happy times flew by. It was finally time for Shirone to go.As the deputy butler, Temuran, stood next to the carriage. Shirone said his affectionate farewells to his parents.\u201cFather, I\u2019ll get going. I\u2019ll write to you often.\u201d\u201cYes, my son! Do your best! Here, give me a kiss!\u201d\u201cEuk!\u201dShirone scrunched up his face. No matter how young he may look, he was now 17-years-old, so to ask for a kiss from him was a difficult request.\u201cKissing now is a bit\u2026\u201dVincent interjected.\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to do it, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u201cEeuuk.\u201dAs a pair of meaty lips approached, Shirone\u2019s neck withdrew like a turtle as he raised his head.Vincent kissed Shirone\u2019s forehead and pulled him in for a hug.\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Shirone.\u201d\u201cFather.\u201dShirone reciprocated his father\u2019s firm hug.With the strong support of his parents, his fear of the aristocratic academy went away a little.\u201cI will return.\u201dLeaving his house with his usual greeting, Temuran approached and bowed his head.\u201cPlease, climb on. I will take you to the academy.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dBoth men were silent during the ride.Since their positions had completely changed in the span of just two years, both were quite uncomfortable. But Shirone did not forget the fact that Temuran had sided with him, despite Louis\u2019 opposition.Upon arriving at the main gate of the magic academy, Temuran turned more courteous as he dropped Shirone off. Since it was a place where nobles attended, he had to make sure he acted properly.\u201cAlong with the admission fee, the payment for the school materials has already been settled. Don\u2019t worry about the financial part, young master! Just study hard!\u201dShirone politely said.\u201cDeputy butler, thank you.\u201d\u201cI am just doing what I have to do.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve properly thanked you. Thanks to your support, I get to go to this academy. I will never forget this favor.\u201d\u201cNo matter how high a commoner might fly, they are still commoners. They can never go beyond the nobles.\u201dShirone raised his head. Temuran had a stern look on his face.\u201cBut this opportunity is not something that just appears. When you enter the academy, many nobles will not like you. Even so, please bear it. Endure it, for it will eventually come to an end.\u201dIt was advice from an orphan who became a deputy butler. It was very Temuran-like.\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll definitely become a mage.\u201dTemuran smiled. This was the first time Shirone had ever seen Temuran smile.\u201cFollow me if you are ready. Young master was registered as a guest of the Ogent family and accepted through special admission. Let me introduce for you.Guards stood in front of the academy\u2019s main gate.He did not know if they were the same ones who drove Shirone out, but even if a person were to change, the philosophy and belief in their place would still remain constant.\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d\u201cHe is Shirone, he was recently admitted to the magic academy. Here is the proof of admission and the identification notarized by the Ogent family.\u201dThe guards who saw the proof of admission did not dare to check the identification. This was because ordinary people were not allowed to cross the gates.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to serve you. I\u2019m Marco, the guard of the main gate. I look forward to working with you.\u201dConsidering how he was treated just 5 years ago, Shirone felt strange due to the treatment, but he was no longer a small child.\u201cYes. I look forward to working with you as well.\u201dTemuran turned to Shirone.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll get going. Please, feel free to contact me anytime if you need anything.\u201dAfter receiving the documents from Shirone, he took his first step as a student of the magic academy.\u201cAttention!\u201dThe moment he crossed the gates of the magic academy, he was greeted with salutes. This made Shirone\u2019s heart thump loudly.\u2018Alpheas Magic Academy!\u2019What could he learn here? And what kind of people would he meet in a place called the birthplace of geniuses?The numerous buildings that were scraping the sky seemed to welcome Shirone.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The academy was using a whole mountain over a site area of 75.425 square kilometers.When including dormitories, there were a total of 22 buildings.

And while this may seem low, in reality, this amount was equal to the best academy in the kingdom.Entering a building where the reception desk was located, Shirone saw students with glowing, radiant faces walking around.After submitting his documents, while waiting, Shirone looked at the curriculum pinned against a wall.\u2018They sure are systematic!\u2019The Alpheas Magic Academy was run using a system called the Class Ten, where classes 10 to 8 were Beginner classes, 7 to 4 were Intermediate, and 3 to 1 were the Graduate/Advanced classes.The Advanced classes used relative evaluation, and only 10 out of the maximum 30 students could graduate.\u2018Only 10 students?\u2019Considering that the graduation test was held once a year, that meant 20 prodigies failed every year.\u201cYou must be Shirone.\u201dWhen he turned his head, he saw Alpheas, who looked no different compared to five years ago, walking towards him.Shirone bowed politely, recalling that this place was a magic academy.\u201cHello. My name is Shirone.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019ve met before. Do you remember me?\u201dThere was no way Shirone could forget the incident that pushed him to dream of becoming a mage.\u201cYes, I do. Thank you. I am truly grateful.\u201d\u201cWell, we\u2019ll get to those talks eventually. But for now, come. You have to go take the entrance test.\u201d\u201cHm? A test?\u201dShirone was taken aback.He hadn\u2019t learned anything yet, so how was he supposed to take a test?\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. It\u2019s just to evaluate which class to put you in. Can you enter the Spirit Zone?\u201d\u201cYes, I can.\u201d\u201cOho?\u201dIt was definitely unusual to enter the Spirit Zone alone.However, Shirone did it outside of school and without proper guidance, so Alpheas could not extinguish all his worries.The reason why Alpheas proceeded with Shirone\u2019s application last was because of his age difference compared to the other students.Due to the nature of this academy, most of the enrolled kids were under the age of 10, if not 14 at most.Shirone, on the other hand, was 17 years old, so Alpheas adjusted the time to save him face.\u2018I should probably teach him from the beginning. The fault lies with my poor judgement. If only he had started a little earlier\u2026\u2019Alpheas personally guided Shirone.Despite the fact they had arrived early, other students were also taking the test, so he made a turn and headed to a building where the classrooms were located.Shirone's jaw dropped to the ground. It was as if he were exposed to a completely new world as\u2026Everyone was casting magic.Even though it was the beginner class, the flashy magic could make a viewer's eyes roll.A girl floating about four stories high was having a heated discussion with her friends through a window, while another child was reading three books at the same time with all of them open in the air.Alpheas watched Shirone\u2019s reaction through the corners of his eyes and smiled mischievously\u2026 Because from now on, the real show would begin.As they entered Class 7, Shirone saw students having a heated discussion. And although they were not casting magic like the kids from before, their eyes were burning with passion. They were so immersed in their conversation that they didn\u2019t notice people passing by.\u201cConvection energy to bring the atmosphere below freezing point? Isn\u2019t it more effective to condense the refrigerant?\u201d\u201cBut that has the disadvantage of being able to reverse the reaction. How about this? Instead of flipping the directivity of the energy, if we were to rotate the time base\u2026\u201dShirone, who was paying attention to the students\u2019 conversation, was suddenly scared.He knew what topic they were discussing, but he could not understand the details at all.A loud noise was heard at the end of the hallway, and as a door was ripped open, a girl came out with her ears covered.The students turned around in surprise, but soon turned their attention back to the matters at hand and went back to focusing on their work.\u2018Judging from their reaction, it seems like this kind of occurrence happens rather often here.\u2019A female student, the culprit of the disturbance, ran to Alpheas with her hands now away from her ears.\u201cHeadmaster! Hello!\u201d\u201cHoho, yes. It seems like there is a problem.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the sound amplification experiment. There must have been an error on the output circuit. I think I need to redesign it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important to balance the input and output. The key is to keep the electric power at equilibrium.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try again.\u201dThe girl put on her glasses and went back into the laboratory.As Shirone passed by, he looked inside and saw children of his age having a discussion over a strange magic circle.\u2018I feel like I\u2019m in a different world!\u2019Shirone realized how small the well he was trapped in was.Everyone here had special talents like him.Now standing in front of the bulletin, the grades of 270 students were listed down.In the Intermediate class, there were 42 students listed under Class Four, the highest level in the Intermediate section. And the one in first place was Amy Karmis.\u2018Oh? The Karmis family!\u2019Due to his experience working for the Ogent family, Shirone memorized the names of famous noble families.Karmis was the 1st-class nobility who lived in the city of Creas.\u2018Cool!\u2019All the information overwhelmed him, but instead of being scared, his heart thumped wildly.There were literally infinite competitions.He wanted to compete. He wanted to challenge himself. He wanted to see how far he could reach.\u201cYo! Amy! Wait for me!\u201dShirone turned his head.That person definitely said Amy. And now that he had the chance to see the person in first place in the Class Four Intermediate class, he turned to look, only to catch sight of a pretty girl with red hair and a book in her arms.\u201cAh?\u201dAt that moment, an unknown tension squeezed his heart.Trauma. Emotions crashed over him before the memories had the chance to, and after a while, he remembered who she was.It was the girl he met five years ago in the back alleyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018H-How could\u2026\u2019Shirone, frozen in shock, turned his head away as Amy walked towards him with her friend.\u2018Please, just pass by! Just go!\u2019Shirone hoped earnestly that they\u2019d just ignore him for, in his eyes, nothing good could come out of them meeting. Thankfully, the two girls gave him no attention and were about to walk past\u2026 Or so he thought. Due to being in the moment, Shirone had totally forgotten that he was pretty attractive. And due to this, he did not notice that he had already caught the attention of one of the girls.\u201cAmy, Amy! Did you see the boy we just passed by? Is he new? He seems a bit too old to be a new student\u2026 Maybe he\u2019s a transfer student? Oh my god, he\u2019s totally my style.\u201dAmy couldn\u2019t answer back even though she was listening to her chatty friend. It was because, like Shirone, she felt something weird.\u201cStrange\u2026 He looks familiar. Where have I seen him before?\u201d\u201cWait, are you interested in him? You, who never bothered to look at a guy before?\u201d\u201cNo. I really have seen him somewhere before.\u201d\u201cEnough with the lies. Be honest, you have a crush on him, right? Right???\u201d\u201cSeriously, I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s not that.\u201dAmy sped up her pace to escape the persistent rambling. And when her friend started to catch up to her, she started running.\u201cHurry up and spill it! I won\u2019t drop this until you tell me the truth!\u201d\u201cNo! I said it\u2019s nothing like that!\u201dBoys who saw Amy running away from her friend watched in envy.Although she was the most popular girl in school, she rejected the love calls of every junior and senior to confess to her.The only one who knew she was once a vicious girl who dominated the back alley was Shirone.* * *The Magic Academy\u2019s 3rd Test Site.The spacious hall had a mirror-like smooth floor.Letters were engraved on the floor, but it was too difficult to understand.Five teachers were seated side by side behind a table on the north side of the hall.Upon his arrival, Shirone saw six students taking the test, and all of them were young kids.\u201cI see it\u2019s still not over yet. That\u2019s good. Watch carefully what those children do.\u201dConsidering he looked a bit old for a newly enrolled student, he paid no mind to the stares he received.Alpheas explained the letters on the floor.\u201cIf you enter the Spirit Zone, these letters will look and feel different. And depending what you feel through them, we will analyze the size, strength, flexibility, and propensity of your Spirit Zone. You just have to answer the instructors honestly.\u201dShirone, who got the gist of it, watched the test from a distance.\u201cOkay, Camie. Can you use magic?\u201d\u201cI can levitate objects into the air.\u201dThe examiners did not check each individual claim to see if they were true. It was because they knew that if the students were to uselessly bluff their way through the academy where they came to learn, they would ultimately be the ones at the losing end.\u201cI see. Then shall we go right to the Spirit Zone?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen the child named Camie entered the Spirit Zone, a young instructor sitting at the far right asked. With slicked-back blond hair, he was a handsome man who made a sharp impression.\u201cWhat is the farthest number you can see?\u201d\u201cSix.\u201d\u201cOh? A six\u2026\u201dThe man wrote down the number on a paper approvingly.It meant that his Spirit Zone reached a sphere of six meters in diameter.To have that degree of skill as a newly enrolled student, he was on the level to join Class 9 at minimum.The next question was asked by an elderly instructor sitting next to him.With a buzz cut and a forehead full of fine wrinkles, he habitually raised his eyebrows which made him look like an owl.\u201cWhat is the most clear color you can feel?\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026 I feel like I\u2019ve entered a red world.\u201d\u201cRed. A divergent type. That explains why your Spirit Zone is large for your age.\u201dThe instructors nodded in agreement.The third and fourth instructors also asked questions they were specially in charge of.One instructor asked whether the large tower stood on the left or the right. This was done in order to find out which side of the brain they typically used. Another instructor then asked how many balls were shaking. This was to check the density of the students\u2019 Spirit Zone.\u201cWhat is the temperature you feel right now? Is it on the cold side or the warm side?\u201dThe last instructor to ask was a young woman.Her eyebrows were thin with sharp eyes that gave her a cold appearance. But she was certainly beautiful nonetheless.\u201cI think it\u2019s a little hot. It\u2019s to the point I\u2019m sweating.\u201dIf one was to feel hot, it meant that their Spirit Zone was variable. If someone\u2019s application skills increase, their durability would decrease, so having a high application level was not necessarily good or bad.\u201cOkay, good job, Camie.\u201dThe remaining students were also tested one after the other.Teachers were satisfied that the average standard was quite high this year, and even Alpheas was impressed when a child announced the number 12.It was finally Shirone\u2019s turn.Alpheas gently placed his hand on Shirone\u2019s back and pushed, taking him to the instructors.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cNow, don\u2019t feel pressured and show off your skills.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll try.\u201dShirone was not pressured. Since he started out at zero anyways, he wanted to start his study from the basics in order to ensure the best learning experience.The examiners observed Shirone carefully.He was the special admission student whom Alpheas had already notified them about.In his resume, there was a unique status that said he was a guest of the Ogent family, and under the special notes, it stated that he had a high possibility of development.Time to time, there were kids like Shirone. Children who only realized their talents later on.However this magic academy was called the birthplace of geniuses.No matter how much of a genius they were outside of the academy, there were many who realized that they were below average when compared to the real geniuses in the academy.Perhaps that was why the instructors did not have big expectation.The blond man sitting on the right asked a question with an unenthusiastic voice.Fire mage Thadd. He was known to only sweeten his voice in the presence of women.\u201cShirone Arian. You are 17 years old, correct? Can you use magic?\u201d\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t learned any magic yet.\u201d\u201cI see. Well\u2026 A person should be able to do a few things, even without formal teaching.\u201dThere was a hint of sarcasm in Thadd\u2019s tone, but he wasn't totally wrong.The Spirit Zone was what allowed knowledge in one\u2019s brain to be released into reality.On the other hand, it was something impossible for Shirone to cast any magic since he had no opportunity to receive formal teaching.That\u2019s why he put aside all other things and was so hung on obtaining a Core of Knowledge. Hence why he knew nothing in terms of how to apply and cast magic.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s take a look first. Stand in the circle over there and activate your Spirit Zone. Ah, you can do it, yes?\u201dIf he was a special admission student who couldn\u2019t even do that, they would have questioned the morality of the headmaster.Thankfully, that did not happen because Shirone nodded while heading over to the circle.\u201cThen\u2026 I\u2019ll try.\u201dWhen Shirone closed his eyes and focused his mind, his synesthesia unfolded.\u2018Wow!\u2019Once he entered the Spirit Zone, Shirone was overwhelmed by the countless pieces of information.Most of the knowledge from reality was blocked, and he felt as if he had fallen into a whole new dimension.\u2018This was what it was like.\u2019When he felt the world through synesthesia, the letters engraved on the floor appeared three-dimensionally.Thadd asked.\u201cWhat is the farthest number you can see?\u201dAmongst the countless numbers orbiting around, Shirone took note of the farthest one.His eyesight was not important because, through synesthesia, he saw things without needing to see them with his eyes.\u201c......\u201dHowever Shirone could not answer.\u201cShirone, what is the farthest number you can see?\u201dEven as Thadd kept urging him, Shirone made no move to open his mouth. That led the instructors to think that Shirone was embarrassed over whatever number he saw.It was natural to be intimidated after watching kids younger than him show off their talents.Alpheas spoke softly.\u201cShirone, you can be honest. We are not trying to rank or judge you. We\u2019re only trying to figure out the right education level for you.\u201dShirone spoke with a small, doubtful voice.\u201cUm\u2026 I do see a number, but it\u2019s impossible to read it because it\u2019s so long.\u201dThadd asked again.\u201cYou can\u2019t read it? Are you saying you can\u2019t see it?\u201d\u201cNo. I do see it, but it\u2019s too long. And even at this very moment it\u2019s still getting longer.\u201dThadd was getting annoyed.The magic characters that calculated the size of the Spirit Zone could only output integers. He thought that Shirone was stalling because he was ashamed of his lack of skill.\u201cThen just tell me the first few numbers in front of you.\u201d\u201cMmm, 3.14.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dThe eyes of all the instructors popped wide open.The number Shirone was seeing was the circumference/pi. Since it was an irrational number that was not divisible by an integer, it went on indefinitely.The woman sitting on the far left shot back, raising her glasses.\u201cShirone, I\u2019m sorry, but there is no such thing as 3.14 in the numbers we designated. Are you sure?\u201dSiena specialized in freezing magic, and like her magic, she had a cold temperament which did not go along with Thadd\u2019s. Due to this, they were always at each other\u2019s throat.Shirone frowned, bothered.\u201cMm, is that so? But that\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s true\u2026\u2019Siena had lied.Of course, it was true that pi was not engraved along with the other magic characters\u2026 But there was one\u2026 Just one situation in which pi could appear.It was when the area of the spirit zone exceeded the range that could be measured.This meant that the Spirit Zone, which Shirone extended, had a diameter of at least 30 meters.The accuracy and precision measurement for the 3rd Test Site, which evaluated freshmen, was set to be quite low.This was because if the instructors were to push the young children, who had yet to mature, too hard by starting off too extreme or intense, the experience could traumatize them for life.Due to that reason, the diameter range of the Spirit Zone was also limited to 30 meters.However, no matter how late they entered the academy, there were a few who did exceed this limit. Though it was so minimal that one could count with only the fingers of one hand.If a person\u2019s Spirit Zone were to exceed over 30 meters in diameter, that person would typically be assigned under Class 5 at minimum. And if comparing the level of Spirit Zone alone, it could go neck to neck with an uncertified Grade 10 mage\u2019s Spirit Zone.The old man sitting next to Thadd asked the next question.\u201cThen what color do you feel most clearly?\u201d\u201cBlue. Everything is shaded blue.\u201dThe old man\u2019s lips stuck out, and a commotion began among the instructors.\u2018If he\u2019s blue, that means he\u2019s a convergent type\u2026 A type that has an advantage in the durability of the zone rather than the size of the zone.\u2019\u2018Over 30 meters in diameter\u2026 And he only sees blue\u2026 His development must have been amazing.\u2019Alpheas, too, was surprised. He finally understood why Klumph had been boasting nonstop about Shirone.However, as a headmaster who had encountered numerous, varying students, he became rather critical.If Shirone just had an adequate amount of talent, then there would have been space for his compliments\u2026 But Shirone went beyond that level.And above all, since Shirone had yet to step foot into the world of magic, he definitely hadn\u2019t yet tapped into even half of his full potential and talent.\u2018This is a bit dangerous.\u2019Too much praise could ruin a talent.With Alpheas too engrossed in his thoughts to say anything, Shirone continued to diligently answer the questions.\u2018The development of his brain is bi-hemespheric\u2026 \u2019This meant that Shirone used both sides of his brain at the same time.This was also unique, but the real surprise had yet to come.\u201cHow many balls are floating around?\u201dSince synesthesia was applied, he could sense the number of balls all at once. He did not have to count each ball one by one.After a while, Shirone opened his mouth.\u201c867.\u201d\u201c867\u2026\u201dThe instructor who had asked the question lost all emotion and went blank. And Siena, who had been watching with a collected attitude, had to pull in her chair for the first time to fix her usually flawless posture.The ball-counting segment measured the density of one\u2019s Spirit Zone. This was done in order to measure how evenly spread the caster\u2019s mental strength was.Being able to sense 867 balls meant that Shirone\u2019s mental strength covered 86.7% of his Spirit Zone.\u2018A kid who only recently turned 17?\u2019Having such an evenly spread mental strength meant that his mind was extremely stable, so his probability of succeeding in the field of magic was high.PR/N: Density = How well spread one\u2019s mental strength is.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHow cool is it right now, Shirone?\u201dSiena asked, already assuming that Shirone would be on the cold side.And she was right.\u201cIt\u2019s quite chilly. Almost to the point I\u2019d call it cold.\u201dConsidering the test site, Shirone would not have been able to feel anything beyond the chills he was already feeling.Siena, who nodded as if she understood, began to write down her overall evaluation on the document.Here was the gist of it.\u2018Convergent type, defensive, and excellent durability. Even the size of his Spirit Zone is abnormally large.\u2019Siena wondered if this kind of situation was actually realistic.Although she had been teaching for over four years, it was rare to see a Spirit Zone go beyond 30 meters.However, this was the inevitable result of Shirone\u2019s choice and concentration.Like how he dug through the history books to overcome his shallow disadvantages in terms of knowledge, the only thing Shirone could do in an environment where he could not learn magic was to polish his Spirit Zone as much as he possibly could. And his efforts did not betray him.\u201cWell done. You can leave your Spirit Zone now. We need to have a meeting to decide which class to enroll you in, so could you wait outside for a while?\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201dHe bowed his head and went outside to where the children were gathered.When the door to the test site closed, the instructors who had been quiet began to speak.\u201cHe is a very peculiar student.\u201dThadd said with a face as if he did not find Shirone to his liking.\u201cNot peculiar, but just balanced, don\u2019t you think?\u201dSiena countered.\u201cI\u2019m saying he\u2019s peculiar because everything is so well balanced. A 17-year-old boy who doesn\u2019t know a thing about magic has a Spirit Zone that exceeds 30 meters in diameter. And not to mention he is a convergent type.\u201cThe bigger the Spirit Zone, the lighter the density\u2026 At least that\u2019s what usually happens\u2026 But his density is 86.7%.\u201d\u201cThough we do teach students how to increase the density through techniques, this child has shown a level of mental strength not commonly seen at all. He has the same level of mental stability as a high priest training in the mountains.\u201dWhile most of the teachers were busy praising him, Thadd, who expressed critical opinions, was annoyed.\u201cWell, let's not forget the fact that he\u2019s only a student. We still have to wait and see.\u201dSiena asked back coldly.\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018student\u2019? This is an academy where children come to learn. What else would he be if not a student?\u201dThadd\u2019s face turned red.If Siena were any less pretty, he wouldn\u2019t have put up with her insult.While the two clashed with their eyes, the other teachers withheld from vocalizing their opinions.Thadd of the Flames and Siena of the Ice. They were famous for always being at each other\u2019s throats in the academy.Alpheas intervened.\u201cSo where should we place him? Shirone, I mean.\u201dSiena immediately spoke out.\u201cWouldn\u2019t Class 5 be appropriate? He has a high possibility of development along with a unique propensity, so I think he should be supervised intensively.\u201dThadd immediately refuted.\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t know any magic. Doing that would only make him haughty and encourage him to cause trouble.\u201d\u201cThough some students may possess similar characteristics like the ones you have, not all are like you, Mr. Thadd.\u201d\u201cSiena! There\u2019s a limit to how much I can put up with! Let's be honest here. Frankly speaking, since you\u2019re the one in charge of Class 5, you obviously want to be the one to supervise him.\u201d\u201cSo what? What\u2019s the problem with that, huh? A teacher wants to guide and teach a student. Is that a problem?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just saying, you\u2019re being too greedy. He doesn\u2019t know magic, and to add to that, he\u2019s at a level where he can\u2019t modify his Spirit Zone. The highest class we should place him in has to be Class 7, no more than that. It\u2019s the most appropriate.\u201dAlpheas also asked the other instructors.Some said that it\u2019d be better to slowly raise him from Class 10, step by step. Others even suggested that placing him in a specific class should be put on hold for the time being.The teacher who resembled an owl came up with a proposal.\u201cI think Class 7 is perfect. We have to consider his age as well. Since he is a bit older than the average new students, sending him to the Beginner\u2019s Class would make the kids lose motivation. Wouldn\u2019t Class 7 be okay because it also teaches basic lessons regarding the Spirit Zone? If Shirone really displays great talent, we can give him an early advancement.\u201dAlpheas felt that he had a point.In order to perfect Shirone\u2019s half-developed talent, it was rather necessary to strengthen the basics first.\u201cThen I\u2019ll assign him there.\u201dThe entrance test was over.* * *Class 7 was definitely a high-end class, so Shirone was able to get into a dormitory with kids his age.Surprisingly, it was a single, private room.Since this was an academy that nobles attended, the subsidy was beyond imagination, so convenience was a must.Since the Ogent family became part of the sponsors, Shirone did not have to walk on eggshells.His room was 707 in the men\u2019s dormitory.While nobles would have not been satisfied with it, considering the room was the size of the living room in his home in the mountains, and considering the bed and desks were all luxurious, he did not have any complaints.There was also a bookcase nailed against the wall, though it was empty.\u201cDo the students here have free time?\u201dWhen Shirone asked the person who guided him to his room, the person said that he was free to do whatever he wanted as long as classes were finished for the day.However, except for the weekends, going out was prohibited. But this was not really an issue as most convenience facilities were built inside the school as its land was so large.The students could even create their own research groups for subjects they were interested in. And if there were more than a certain number of members, funds would even be provided.There were a total of four libraries around the school that operated 24/7, and there were no specific restrictions on how many books one could borrow as long as the deadline was met.Shirone was satisfied with everything.It was the best environment to study in.Lastly, the staff had told him about unauthorized magic.Except in laboratories, magic after school was prohibited, especially to those who study unorthodox magic. They were punished regardless of any reason if caught practicing it without supervision.A representative example of unorthodox magic was the Necromancer\u2019s Soul Pact Magic. Anti-Magic was also categorized as one.Shirone asked why Anti-Magic was prohibited, but the staff only said they didn\u2019t know and left.\u201cWell, then\u2026\u201dShirone plopped on his bed and decided to plan ahead.He thought he didn\u2019t need to join a research group yet. There was also the problem with him being a commoner, but in addition to that, Shirone himself was unsure as to what area suited him.\u201cI should start visiting the library. Since I studied only history for two years, I have to now acquire a wide range of knowledge.\u201dShirone was confident. He built his Core of Knowledge by suppressing his curiosity for months.From now on, all he had to do was acquire knowledge like crazy.Shirone woke up due hearing the beautiful melody of a piano.\u201cIt\u2019s already morning.\u201dThe sound was transmitted through a magic called Ethereal Resonance, a form of magic typically studied by students who majored in music.However, even this masterpiece did not compare to the moment when he played with Reina.Suddenly, the people from the Ogent family came to mind.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u2018Are they doing well? Is Rian entering his first class with a nervous heart like me?\u2019After those thoughts and after cleaning himself up, Shirone headed to the cafeteria to eat breakfast.In the dormitory where men and women living quarters were separated, the cafeteria was one of the only places where they could sit together.Shirone sat in a corner.Although conversing with people and making friends was an option, Shirone enjoyed eating in peace.Because of this tendency, he was once teased by the children of the mountaineers for being timid.However, there were many students who were similar to Shirone, and no one cared if someone ate their food with a fork or with their hands.But, the issues between men and women were another thing. Shirone\u2019s appearance attracted the attention of female students, and soon, he could hear whispers around him.Even if he tried not to notice, it was impossible to completely block the whispers out, so Shirone finished his meal quickly and returned to his room.Whilst walking to his class, due to the weight of the textbooks on his back, his shoulders began to hurt.He lugged around many textbooks because there were a lot of subjects to study. And Class 7, which was the beginning of the Intermediate Classes, was where magic began to be taught.The lessons were naturally difficult.Compared to the nobles who had the resources to study before entering the academy, Shirone\u2019s knowledge was limited.However, Shirone was able to keep up because of his shallow, yet vast, Core of Knowledge.\u2018My judgment was right!\u2019Categorizing different types of subjects using the framework he had built over 2 years really helped Shirone focus in class.Lunchtime passed. During the afternoon, there was a combined lesson for Spirit Zone training.From Class 7 to Class 4, 280 Intermediate students sat side by side. The training ground quickly became noisy as everyone was busy introducing themselves.\u201cI was able to take the test thanks to your help!\u201d\u201cHere! I saved you a seat!\u201dAt first, Shirone simply friends were chatting with friends, but after hearing some conversations, he noticed many of the conversations were between upper and lowerclassmen.It was also common to see people who looked older greet a younger-looking student politely.\u2018Even though we are all in the same Intermediate Class, things are kept strict!\u2019Whether certified or uncertified, a mage\u2019s rank determined their position or job. The same could be said here. The strict barriers between upperclassmen and lowerclassmen were also proportional to their level.Of course, there may be embarrassing situations where yesterday's lowerclassmen may become today\u2019s upperclassmen, but it was natural for students who were more experienced to condescend those lower than them.\u2018Does that mean there\u2019s almost no turnaround?\u2019Shirone felt indirectly how difficult it was to jump up a class.The instructor of the Spirit Zone was a certified Grade 6 mage named Ethella Romie.She was probably around her mid-20s at the most.Simply tied back Brown hair, large glasses, and a gentle appearance that did not fit the image of an instructor.\u201cAlright, everyone. A new student has joined the Intermediate Class today. Shirone, stand up and introduce yourself.\u201dAll eyes turned to look at Shirone. Of course, among those eyes were Amy\u2019s.\u201cOh, Amy! Isn\u2019t that the boy we saw yesterday?\u201dUnintentionally ignoring her friend, Sharelle, who was making a fuss, Amy got lost in thought.Despite his strong impression, enough to make him look familiar, it was her first time hearing the name Shirone.A Class 5 student stepped in.\u201cDid you know? He\u2019s the new kid who was assigned to Class 7 right away. According to my sources, the teachers are pretty interested in him.\u201d\u201cInteresting. From which family is he? Do you know his family name?\u201dAt that moment, Amy shouted.\u201cDamn it!\u201dIt was her first time saying such harsh words, so Sharelle asked with a surprised look.\u201cAmy, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 No, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dIt was not nothing.In retrospect, he was actually the one who put an end to her dark history. And whenever she thought back to it, she felt stupid.\u2018Right, he did have talent. But I\u2019m sure he was a commoner. How did he get into this academy?\u2019Shirone introduced himself.\u201cHello, my name is Shirone Arian. Starting today, I will be taking Class 7 with you all. Please take good care of me.\u201dThe students welcomed him with applause.While the upperclassmen were happy that one more student was included in their list of lowerclassmen, the female students were happy for the new addition of one more good-looking male.However, among the students, there were some who looked displeased. It was hostility toward a future competitor.Ignoring everyone\u2019s thoughts regarding the newcomer, Ethella began her class.\u201cAlright class, let\u2019s begin. What is the Spirit Zone?\u201d\u201cThe mind of a mage.\u201d\u201cYes. The Spirit Zone is the embodiment of the mind. The very first form is a sphere. But in practice, the shape of a sphere might sometimes be inefficient.\u201dEthella entered a magic device called \u2018Image Zone.\u2019A magic circle with concentric circles was drawn on the smooth floor. It looked similar to the place where kids took the entrance test.Since the floor disappeared and a black space appeared, Ethella looked like she was floating.In that state, when her Spirit Zone with a diameter of about 10 meters was opened, students could surprisingly see that the shape of the Spirit Zone was visible.\u2018This is the Image Zone I\u2019ve only heard of!\u2019To materialize your mind into reality.It was a device that could not be made without the highest level of magic engineering\u2026 And huge sums of money.However, since the students could now physically see the Spirit Zone, it made teaching lessons in regards to the Spirit Zone a lot easier, which also helped the students excel even more.That was one of the reasons why Alpheas Magic Academy was part of the top 5 prestigious academies in the kingdom.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEthella walked around comfortably, as if she did not enter the Spirit Zone, and continued to explain.\u201cThis is the basic form of the Spirit Zone. It takes up all the space equally. However, in an actual fight, more often than not, you will not have the opportunity to use the entire space. Let me give you an example.\u201dWhen Ethella flicked her finger, a target appeared 20 meters away.\u201cWith a diameter of only 10 meters, you won't be able to affect the target with magic. As such, you would have no choice but to either move towards them or increase the size of your Spirit Zone. However, simply changing the size of your Spirit Zone isn\u2019t something you can do on a whim\u2026 But by changing the shape, you can do something like this.\u201dEthella\u2019s Zone lengthened in the direction of the target. It had the same volume but was able to reach the target by changing its shape.\u201cThe shape of your mind dictates the shape of your Spirit Zone. And then\u2026\u201dEthella held out her hand and chanted.\u201cFire.\u201dFire burst out and burned the target 20 meters away. The eyes of the new students who were in their first-ever class popped open. Ethella, who had been taken lightly because of her gentle appearance, suddenly looked imposing.\u201cHowever, there is a fatal problem when using this method.\u201dDue to Ethella\u2019s words, the new students were embarrassed after hearing that the demonstration a while ago was actually an example of something bad.\u201cThe shape of the Zone can vary. However, having to change the shape every second in a battle is inefficient. So mages use a specific pattern to decrease its inefficiency. And they do it through the Spirit Zone\u2019s four patterns, the Four Way Formation.Shirone\u2019s heart started pounding after hearing the concept for the first time.\u201cThe first form in the Four Way Formation is the Defense Form.\u201dEthella\u2019s Spirit Zone closed in and transformed into a cube with 20 triangular faces. Although it looked rough, it appeared similar to a sphere from a distance.PR/N: Imagine a sphere that\u2019s sort of squarish and has a low-polygon count, that\u2019s what it looks like.\u201cThe basis of the Defense Form is the cube. It\u2019s about building a mental framework using the frames. Oh, and the frames are the triangular faces, for those who don\u2019t know. The more frames the cube has, the more durable it becomes. It's also a shape that can protect a large number of allies. Next is the Attack Form.\u201dEthella changed the shape of her Spirit Zone. The spherical surface area seemed to decrease, while dozens of long needles extended in all directions.\u201cThe Attack Form has, what we call, a star shape. In return for decreasing the center area, it extends the number of Zones. It covers all directions, so you don\u2019t have to worry about the location of your target. It\u2019s the ideal form when dealing with multiple enemies. Next is the target form.\u201dEthella\u2019s Zone changed once again. Her Spirit Zone extended out into the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, and west. The final form was shaped like a cross.\u201cThe basis of the Target Form is the cross. It has the longest range among the basic forms of the Four Way Formation, and although its power is less than that of the Offensive Form, it can easily detect and seize the target.\u201dAs she flicked her finger, the targets began to encircle Ethella and in response, she followed the targets with sharp eyes.\u201c45 degrees to the side. Fire.\u201dThe cross started spinning, and every time the cross caught a target, fire shot out. Magic was cast simultaneously, front to rear, left to right. And no mistakes were made. It was as if she also had eyes located at the back of her head.\u201cWhat you need to master for the Target Form is the speed of your Spirit Zone rotation. While, when done to an extreme, the Straight Form will have the greatest range. But this adjustment is only really used when attacking from a distance and if the target is straight ahead. Since a mage is usually stationed at the very end of a straight line, it is extremely difficult to change the direction of the Spirit Zone.\u201dEthella stopped talking for a second and took the time to wipe her glasses.\u201cLastly, the Deviate Form is about shifting the center of the Zone. In other words, it would be like moving your brain.\u201dShirone did not understand. The center of the Zone indicates the mage\u2019s head, so how could someone just move it?Ethella returned to the basic form.After a while, her Spirit Zone began to move while maintaining its shape as a sphere.Ten seconds later, her Spirit Zone completely detached from Ethella\u2019s body.Shirone was amazed. If a Zone was a mage\u2019s mind, what was in the center of that Zone?\u201cThis is the Deviate Form. It\u2019s a special one among the four forms. This is because the further away it goes, the smaller the zone becomes. And learning it is quite difficult. It is to the point that there are mages that specialize in only that form. That is how hard it is to handle the Deviate Form. However, there is one thing to keep in mind\u2026 It is the fastest among the four forms. Its activation speed is instant.\u201dFor a finale, Ethella showed her students the Four Way Formation in sequence, one after the other. From a hardened cube, to a jagged star, then a stretched cross, and finally, when it returned to a sphere, the Zone broke off from her body and rapidly whirled around her.\u201cWhoaaaaa\u2026\u201dClass 7 students finally realized. The Four Way Formation was not something easily achieved within a year or two. The teacher in front of them was a certified Grade 6 mage, not a brainless, innocent-looking child.\u201cFrom now on, you guys will be practicing the Four Way Formation. You\u2019ll be practicing the four forms in repetition. Now, let\u2019s spread out by class and practice.\u201dThe students were taught different lessons according to their class. Shirone took Ethella\u2019s class along with Class 7 students.\u201cFirst of all, let's learn more about the Defense Form. Depending on the mage\u2019s propensity, they will have an easier time with certain forms. But it\u2019s good to constantly polish and strengthen the Defensive Form. Because even in chaotic battlefields, you will be able to concentrate, and above all, you will gain the strength to resist Anti-Magic.\u201dShirone recalled the precautions he had heard yesterday, and since the staff did not answer, his question still remained.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cMs. Romie, I have a question. Um\u2026 May I ask a question?\u201d\u201cHoho, feel free to ask. I hope asking if you can ask a question was not your question.\u201d\u201cUm, yes. Why is Anti-Magic a forbidden magic? I hear that a lot of mages are studying Anti-Magic legally.\u201d\u201cHmm, let's see. There are two types of Anti-Magic. Anti-Magic for mages and Anit-Magic on artifacts. Do you know this?\u201d\u201cYes, I do.\u201d\u201cAnti-Magic is the Spirit Zone imbued with special properties. Therefore, the effectiveness differs depending on the mind of the mage. That is what\u2019s different from artifact Anti-Magic.\u201d\u201cSo it can be dangerous if clumsily handled.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly it. If you were to cast it without being familiar with it, it might lead to an accident. Mages who specialize in Anti-Magic train in only that for a lifetime. Though a lot of times, they reach a dead end. The academy does not recommend that path to all of you.\u201dShirone nodded. It was a magic that destroyed minds, so it was not a subject to study at an academy filled with kids.\u201cOkay! Back to the Four Way Formation.\u201dEach Class 7 student began practicing. The trick was to build a mental framework first and then connect it together.After practicing for a while, Shirone felt his Spirit Zone becoming solid, so he opened his eyes. He couldn\u2019t visually confirm as it wasn\u2019t an Image Zone, but he certainly seemed to have achieved something.It was a remarkable achievement considering Shirone was a convergent type. This was the result of him focusing only on his Spirit Zone for 6 years.\u201cWow! Look at that!\u201dHis classmates pointed to an Image Zone and shouted.Class 4 students were taking turns, and now it was Amy\u2019s turn\u2026 And she put on an amazing show.Amy cast the Target Form. Her cross turned 90 degrees to the right and then 270 degrees to the left, twisting between angles incessantly and shooting flames.The length of the Zone was about 20 meters, which was an acceptable level for a Target Form, but the rotational speed of the Zone was incredible.Although the targets were up from all directions, the number of flames shooting out from four directions was at the level of rapid firing.After destroying 120 targets in an instant, Amy removed her Zone. Beautiful looks with outstanding skills. Underclassmen looked up at her with twinkling eyes.Shirone realized again after seeing the awe in the eyes of the Class 7 students\u2026 Why was a girl from such an amazing family hanging out with thugs six years ago?After ruminating in his head, Shirone suddenly flinched. Amy, who just came out from the Image Zone, was staring right at Shirone. And naturally, other students followed her gaze and also turned to stare at Shirone.\u201cHuh? Do they know each other?\u201d\u201cNo? Wasn\u2019t he admitted just yesterday?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me she fell for him\u2026 She\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t even glimpse at anyone\u2026\u201dAfter hearing the whispers among the crowd, Amy hurriedly turned her gaze away. She felt like she was going crazy.Amy knew Shirone was the only one who knew about her immature past. After all, she had straightened herself out after she started learning magic.\u2018This can\u2019t be\u2026 I\u2019m graduating soon. If a rumor were to spread now, everything could go down the drain. What should I do?\u2019Although Amy went back to her place, none of the students moved to use the Image Zone. In both fame and reputation, she was No. 1 in the Intermediate Class, so no matter who volunteered to come forward, they would only be humiliated in front of the lowerclassmen.Shirone thought right now was an opportunity and walked up to Ethella.\u201cMs. Romie, if you don\u2019t mind, can I go next?\u201d\u201cHm? You mean into the Image Zone?\u201dEthella tilted her head. What reason could there be for a student who had just started learning the Four Way Formation to use the Image Zone?\u201cWait a minute\u2026 the upperclassmen have to go first. That\u2019s the rule.\u201dEthella waited\u2026 But nobody made a move to use it. So instead of letting such an expensive device go to waste, she thought it\u2019d be best to let someone give it a go, even if it was for just a simple experience.\u201cAlright. It won\u2019t hurt to try it out in advance. However, the targets won\u2019t be up. You might get hurt.\u201d\u201cOkay, I just thought it\u2019d be a good idea to have a look at my Defense Form.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dEthella asked, dumbfounded. But Shirone, who didn\u2019t catch it, was already walking away.As the Image Zone went up, upperclassmen whistled and applauded\u2026 However, they didn\u2019t do it to encourage him. Rather, they just wanted a good show. They weren\u2019t expecting much. Without giving them his attention, Shirone walked to the center with no care.Amy, who was drinking water, looked towards the stage. And as soon as her eyes caught Shirone's figure, she spewed out the water in her mouth.\u201cPFFFFFFFFT!\u201d\u201cYou okay, Amy? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cWhat the heck is he doing? He\u2019s from Class 7, what can he do? He should know better than that.\u201dAt the sudden occurrence, class time turned into break time. However, Shirone was solely focused on what he was about to do.As Shirone entered the Spirit Zone, his sphere began to swell rapidly. As soon as he saw it with his eyes, he stopped breathing. Overwhelmed by the image, Shirone unconsciously stopped expanding.The noisy students were at a loss for words. The size of the Zone was 20 meters in diameter. Considering the average diameter for Class 7 students was 13 meters, it was safe to say that this was the appearance of a new prodigy.\u201cWow! It\u2019s huge!\u201d\u201cHumph. Can anything be labeled as magic if it just increases in size? It\u2019s nothing more than an air bubble.\u201dShirone was taken aback. Just before he entered the Image Zone, the frame he had built was fine, but now it was bending like a Korean taffy.\u2018How come it\u2019s not working?\u2019\u2018Did my mentality waver after seeing my own Spirit Zone? That can\u2019t be the reason\u2026\u2019Shirone did not think he was that weak, so he was positive the problem laid within the basics.\u2018AHA! That\u2019s it!\u2019In his current state, The Four Way Formation would inevitably collapse. This was because this was his first time casting it, and due to that, he needed to concentrate way more and expend way more mental strength in order to cast the Four Way Formation.There was a lack of materials to build the structure. At a diameter of only 20 meters, he would not be able to construct a frame as rigid as steel.\u2018I have to increase the size to the maximum.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShirone concentrated more. When he averted his attention from the Image Zone and only focused on delving into his Spirit Zone, the already large sphere expanded twice as much.The jaws of the upperclassmen dropped. The numerical value shown on the scoresheet was 41\u2026 41 meters in diameter.Considering that the average diameter of a Class 4 student was 27 meters, it was a number close to a student from an Advanced Class.\u201cWh-What? How the heck does he have such a big zone?\u201dEven Ethella was surprised.Of course, the diameter of a Spirit Zone could always be increased through training.However, not only did it require extreme physical discipline, but one also needed to have grown mentally.The human body did not lie. So as long as one trained consistently, results would surely follow. Though, unlike training the physical body, the mind needed to battle against vague illusions where definite answers were not set.Despite dedicating their lives to pursuing a goal, there were countless mages around the world who fell short of achieving their desired results.It was for this reason that magic was called the realm of talent.\u2018I\u2019ve never seen such an exceptional zone from the start. He probably grew up contemplating the world and exploring his inner self\u2026 But he just turned 18. Is this really possible?\u2019Compared to just a while ago, Shirone began to feel confident. As his Spirit Zone grew bigger, he finally felt the frames establishing themselves.Not noticing the crowd of students paying close attention to him with a look of surprise, Shirone busied himself connecting the framework.\u2018Don\u2019t be fixated on it. Tighten it all at once.\u2019Shirone clenched his teeth and opened his eyes wide. When he entered the Defense Form of the Four Way Formation, the large sphere began to tighten, as if trying to crush Shirone.The force was so strong that the people who were watching heard an auditory hallucination of cracks and snaps.\u201cWoooaahhh\u2026\u201dA groan was heard from somewhere.Shirone stared bewildered at the Four Way Formation he unfolded. He felt like he was trapped inside of a hard, diamond crystal.Like the cubed-shaped form Ethella had shown before, everything was perfectly interconnected. A diameter of 13 meters. Though the efficiency decreased by 30% as the size scaled down from 41 to 13 meters, a success was still a success.\u201cHe did it for real! That kid succeeded on his first day!\u201dMany upperclassmen frowned when the inadequate Class 7 students made a fuss.However, the number of people who expressed their interest stood on equal footing. Of course, most of them were girls.Amy did not affiliate with either side. But really, Shirone began to get on her nerves.How could she have forgotten? Didn\u2019t he decide to learn magic because he was humiliated?\u2018That guy\u2026 Who the heck is he?\u2019This was not an academy where one could just enter by having talent alone. She was positive that he had a benefactor. But the question was\u2026 Who was it?\u201cMs. Romie, the volume shrunk much more than I thought it would.\u201d\u201cHm? That\u2019s inevitable. But its durability would have improved a lot. With the way it is right now, being able to withstand physical impacts to a certain extent wouldn\u2019t be impossible.\u2018I heard he surprised the instructors during the entrance test. I guess the rumor is true.\u2019\u2018Though, success does not happen overnight.\u2019Ethella admitted that he had great insight, but he was only able to succeed due to two factors. His unusually large Spirit Zone, and his convergent tendencies.Realizing the people\u2019s reaction belatedly, Shirone returned to being a shy boy and went back to his spot in the corner.Was it because he was buried in other people\u2019s stares? Because Shirone did not notice Amy\u2019s fierce gaze.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Shirone was busy studying various subjects. Once one got to the Advanced Class, one could choose a major, but before then, one had to study all the subjects, so the range was enormous.His first period was basic chemistry. When he entered the lecture hall of Class 7, he saw the students seated. And on the platform in front of the class, he saw a familiar face.Siena Olifer, Master of Ice Magic.She was the second daughter of the Olifer family and a graduate of the Olifer School. She was a 26-years-old genius who became a certified Grade 6 mage with just ice magic alone. She had a pretty face and a cold attitude.Thanks to that cold attitude of her\u2019s during the entrance test, she made a strong impression on Shirone.However, she was surprisingly popular with the male students. She had a beautiful appearance as well as a feisty personality. She was the ideal type for many of the students.With her long, purple hair neatly tied up, she spoke while stroking her horn-rimmed glasses.\u201cHello everyone. I\u2019m Siena Olifer, and I\u2019ll be teaching this Class 7 chemistry class as of today.\u201dLoud applause exploded across the class. There were some who whistled and others who bluntly asked if she had a lover.Siena ignored them and opened her book. She then gently raised her eyes and looked somewhere.Shirone flinched because he felt like she was looking straight at him.He thought he was mistaken, but in fact, Shirone\u2019s hunch was correct. The only reason why she, who was in charge of Class 5, took the time to purposely open another course was because of Shirone.\u2018Talents rot if they remain stagnant. It\u2019s best to advance him as soon as possible.\u2019Real talent was being able to follow and catch up despite being placed somewhere high. She intended to advance Shirone to discourage her rival, Thadd, and keep her stance strong as a teacher.Whatever the circumstances were, the students were just happy to be taught by the most popular teacher.\u201cMs. Olifer, is it true that you\u2019re dating instructor Thadd? It\u2019s not true, right?\u201d\u201cTell us about your first love. This is our first class.\u201d\u201cPlease, Ms. Olifer! Tell us!\u201dAs the students continued to be persistent, Siena frowned. Then suddenly, an ice crystal with a diameter of 30 centimeters materialized.Crack! Fizzle! Pop!The ice began to spin and grind, and suddenly snow fluttered in all directions. The cold particles instantly lowered the temperature of the classroom.At first, the students laughed it off saying.\u2018It\u2019s only a little chilly.\u2019But their faces quickly hardened. The temperature dropped endlessly. It was to the point where the students couldn\u2019t even talk.\u201cMs. Olifer! I-It\u2019s cold\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s start the class.\u201dSiena came down from her platform and approached the students. The temperature rose as the speed of the ice\u2019s rotation gradually decreased. But it the temperature still remained negative.\u201cWhat is the principle of the ice magic I just performed?\u201dSiena spread her palm as an ice crystal formed and floated above it.\u201cCold. What exactly is \u2018cold\u2019?\u201dAs she clenched her fist following the question, the ice crystal shattered into pieces.\u201cTo be cold refers to a state of lacking energy. There is no such thing as cold energy. So while the thing we call temperature can go infinitely high, it cannot go infinitely low. The state of zero energy is called Absolute Zero.\u201dShirone frantically wrote down her words into his notebook.\u201cBy taking the energy from the atmosphere, you can create ice crystals. Of course, it\u2019s ordinary ice. However, what would happen if you were to break it down into particles and blow it away using the power of the wind? Even ordinary ice can drop the temperature down to a level that can kill people\u2026 Which is something you experienced a while ago.\u201dThe students\u2019 faces paled after hearing the word \u2018kill\u2019.\u201cAlright, then how do we absorb that energy? No, let me rephrase that. How come mages can freely command and cast magic?\u201dSiena raised two of her fingers and first pointed at one.\u201cOmniscience. Omnipotence. Mages cast magic through those two things. The Spirit Zone aligns the mage\u2019s mind with the world. Thus within the domain, the mage holds a divine position. And that\u2019s why I say omnipotence. But you cannot cast magic with that alone. The temperature in the Spirit Zone does not simply rise through a command. You need to know how to raise the temperature. You need knowledge. Hence, omniscience.\u201dShirone nodded his head. The reason why he had not been able to use magic thus far was because he had only trained for omnipotence.\u201cAll of you will be exposed to a variety of studies. The Spirit Zone encompasses only half the magic, and without omniscience, you cannot become a great mage. So now, let us start with the basic chemistry class.\u201dSiena then turned around and started writing on the blackboard. It was the start of the class, and the concentration of the students was at its highest.\u2018Sure enough. She did not become the most popular teacher through simply being pretty.\u2019Having trust in a teacher boosted a student\u2019s desire for achievement, so Shirone lost track of time as he listened to her lecture.There were words that were difficult to understand, but he didn\u2019t care.His Core of Knowledge had been completed, and from today on, he was planning to eat up other studies in earnest.* * *5 P.M.After classes ended, students began to swarm out of the lecture hall. Shirone also headed to the dormitory because his head felt heavy.Students who joined research groups were walking in pairs while carrying their lunch boxes. Shirone, who was not a part of a research group, was thinking of visiting the library after grabbing a bite to eat.\u201cHuh?\u201dSuddenly he felt light. When he came to his senses, he saw himself floating while also being quickly pulled somewhere.The force pulling the back of his shirt was so strong that it was suffocating.After about 3 minutes, he arrived in a garden forest.As he slowed down, Shione, who was floating, fell on his butt.The shock traveled from his butt to the rest of his body.While coughing and catching his breath, he looked up at the person who brought him in a hurry.The mysterious person, who covered their face with a black mask, looked around anxiously. After checking that there were no people, they took off their mask.\u201cWh-What?\u201dShirone\u2019s eyes widened. The identity of the mysterious person was none other than Amy Karmis.Amy raised her hand as if realizing something from Shirone\u2019s expression. As soon as she did so, fire magic erupted from her hand.\u201cI was right. You. You remember me, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Huh?\u201d\u201cLeaving you alone will only bring me trouble. I will scorch your mouth and make you mute.\u201dShirone stared at the approaching flame without moving to avoid it. Unless one was a madman, one had to have a reason for committing a violent act. He did not find it probable for her to burn someone\u2019s face at school.As expected, her palm stopped right in front of Shirone\u2019s face. The fire had already disappeared. She, who had planned to threaten Shirone through fear, asked with a frown.\u201cWho the heck are you? Are you really that coward?\u201dShe could not find a hint of the boy who had been caught by the back alley thugs with trembling legs and a pale face.\u201cYou remember me too, right? Upperclassman?\u201dAmy grabbed Shirone by the collar and pulled him up.\u201cWho are you calling your upperclassman, you bastard?! What the heck happened to you?! You are a commoner, not to mention a total country bumpkin! How the hell did you get in here?!\u201dShirone did not know why she was so agitated. If she were annoyed by the fact that a commoner entered an aristocratic academy, she would not have brought him to such a quiet place from the beginning.\u201cI do have my reasons, but before that, why did you drag me here?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dIt was actually an impulsive decision. At first, she was planning on ignoring him, but she couldn\u2019t. She was someone who found it uncomfortable for even a small secret of hers to be discovered. But Shirone did not have something small\u2026 He knew a huge secret of hers. A secret big enough to end her school life.\u201cTell me honestly! How did you enter this academy?\u201dThe punch that was coming towards him fast did not seem to stop, so Shirone hurriedly confessed.Amy loosened her hold when she heard that he was attending as a guest with the support of the Ogent family.\u201cOho! As a guest of the Ogent family?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAmy\u2019s head was spinning. She was sure he was lying.\u2018There\u2019s no way a commoner could enter as a guest of a noble family.\u2019That was the conclusion she had reached because she did not know about Rian\u2019s knight\u2019s oath.\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell anyone that you know me, did you?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not even a pleasant memory, anyways.\u201dHearing Shirone say that, she knew he was going to stay a huge ticking time bomb. The thought of going to the same academy with such a bomb did not sit well with her.Amy came up with an idea. She raised her head arrogantly and said.\u201cYou are from Class 7, right? I\u2019m from Class 4.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cYou will be my underling from today onwards.\u201d\u201cWhat? An underling?\u201d\u201cI know your weakness. You\u2019d probably get kicked out of the academy if I expose it. So be my underling from now on. You have to listen to everything I say.\u201dShirone made a confused face after hearing her threat.\u201cWhy should I? Whether you hold my weakness or not, you\u2019re still my upperclassman. So if you were to tell me to do something, shouldn't I obey?\u201d\u201cHow naive. Do you think I\u2019ll make it that easy? I'm gonna make sure to make you cry, so look forward to it.\u201dIn Amy\u2019s head, even if she failed to get him kicked out, she could at least make sure Shirone followed her. If she locked him in sight and prodded at his self-esteem, she would be able to find out his hidden intentions.\u201cWhat are you going to make me do?\u201d\u201cAfter class, come running with bread and coffee, \u2018kay? If you spill even a drop, I\u2019ll make you go back to base one.\u201dAlthough Shirone was someone with a good personality, this time he was angry. Bread? Did she think he came to this academy just to deliver some bread?\u201cHohoho! Alright, starting from tomorrow, wait for me in front of the First Library. I\u2019ll end it quickly if you do whatever I tell you to do competently.\u201dShirone was so disconcerted. Was she really the Amy who was called the goddess of Alpheas?\u201cOh right. And\u2026\u201dTurning around, Amy looked back at Shirone. The air around her began to spin as her hand pierced up. At the same time, Shirone\u2019s body rose into the sky.\u201cHeuk!\u201dTornado magic controlled atmospheric pressure to create wind. It was a spell that Shirone managed to barely cast as a child, but for the current Amy, casting it was child\u2019s play.Shirone floundered in the air. Perhaps because he was facing a crisis, the ground looked much clearer. Even the fallen leaves scattered on the ground were vivid.Even that smirking face of Amy.\u2018I\u2019ll die if I fall.\u2019As soon as that thought passed his mind, Amy jumped up and grabbed the back of his collar. As his collar started to tighten around his neck, he could not breathe. When he came back to his senses, he was lying somewhere on the ground.\u201cCough! Cough!\u201dFollowing that magic, she demonstrated the power of Schema, and she dusted off her hand, seemingly satisfied. Amy stopped her Schema training after the age of 12, but nevertheless, her movement was beyond normal human ability.\u201c Consider that payback. See you tomorrow. Hohoho!\u201dAmy laughed cheerfully and walked away. Shirone was furious, he had never met such a hateful girl before.In his mind, she was still the thug from many years ago. Shirone, who tried to diminish his anger, lowered his head and exited the forest. The thought of meeting her from tomorrow onward made him plunge into despair.* * *The five o\u2019clock bell rang for the last period.The basic physics class was over. Shirone, who packed his bag and left the classroom, sighed deeply. He had been running around as Amy\u2019s bread shuttle for the past 10 days.He bought bread and coffee from the school shop. It was a price that could not compare to the donations provided by the Ogent family, but the problem didn\u2019t lie within the money, but with his feelings. And that was what Amy was aiming for.\u201cWhy is she doing this to me? She was the first to make a mistake.\u201dTrying not to spill the coffee required a lot of concentration. Yeah, let\u2019s just think this is some kind of training. He tried to adjust his walk so that the coffee did not shake.\u201cAs if! How long do I have to endure this!\u201dShirone himself thought he was in a miserable state.\u201cOh my! There he goes, the pure and innocent boy.\u201d\u201cHe must be heading to her to confess again. I\u2019m telling you, he has some kind of illness.\u201dThe schoolgirls whispered amongst each other, pointing to Shirone who was passing by. This was his biggest problem.Already, a rumor had spread around the academy that Shirone had a one-sided crush on Amy. And the more that kind of rumor spread, the colder the students treated Shirone.Shirone\u2019s fantasy about women was completely shattered by Amy\u2019s tenacity in resolving her resentment 6 years ago.\u201cHey! Over there, your prince.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018prince?\u2019 He\u2019s just a servant.\u201dAmy and Sharelle were waiting for Shirone together in front of the library. The area around them was crowded with students who were curious to see the extraordinary sight.As Shirone walked up the stairs, the schoolgirls who were watching laughed and clapped. Shirone\u2019s face flushed like a red beet.Sharelle smiled pitifully and said.\u201cBut I kind of feel sorry for him. He\u2019s going this far, why not just accept him?\u201d\u201cWhat? What nonsense are you spouting? Why would I accept him?\u201d\u201cOh stop pretending to be shy. For someone who doesn\u2019t glimpse at a guy, you sure do take all the bread and coffee from Shirone. There are even rumors about the goddess of Alpheas finally getting a partner.\u201dIt was ridiculous. This was a strategy to provoke Shirone, but it seemed like things were flowing unexpectedly.Actually, she was only thinking of keeping it going for a week. But somehow, Shirone never expressed any displeasure and had regularly brought her the food.\u2018Urk! At this point, I\u2019ll end up associated with a really strange rumor. I should stop now.\u2019When Shirone handed Amy the bread and coffee, people cheered. They were deeply moved by him, who spent much effort not to spill a drop of coffee for the woman he loved.\u201cHere\u2019s your coffee.\u201d\u201cGosh! So annoying!\u201dAmy raised her hand. The best way to reverse this ridiculous misunderstanding was through embarrassment.She was going to hit his arm and spill the coffee. Then Shirone would be just like the other countless boys who had been dumped by her so far, and the strange rumor would subside.\u201cWho told you to bring something like this?\u201dAs Amy swung her hand, the students\u2019 eyes grew bigger. However, the expected tragedy did not occur.Amy\u2019s hand trembled as she glared daggers at the coffee.\u2018At least act like you dislike it. Are you stupid? A fool? Do you have no guts or what?\u2019Unexpected guilty conscience. But that was Shirone\u2019s strength.His mindset went something like this.\u2018Isn\u2019t it better to think positively about the things I have to do?\u2019And that attitude made Amy feel guilty.\u201cUm\u2026 Excuse me, here\u2019s your coffee.\u201dShe knew because Amy herself was someone who studied harder than anyone else.Thinking back on it, she felt quite sorry. Nevertheless, she didn\u2019t avoid men because she was afraid of attention, it was simply annoying. The arrogant kids with no talent who called themselves nobles did not really suit her tastes.\u2018Whatever. Let them think whatever they want. As long as the rumor isn\u2019t about me.\u2019Amy accepted the bread and coffee. And as if they were watching a show, applause broke out from all sides.\u201cI don\u2019t need this from now on, so don\u2019t buy it! Okay?\u201d\u201cYes? Oh, okay.\u201dSo now, did her anger disappear with just this? Thinking he would never have to see her again, Shirone let out a deep sigh of relief.However, as a result, Amy\u2019s remark aroused more misunderstanding by the students.\u201cShe accepted it! Amy accepted Shirone\u2019s feelings!\u201d\u201cShe said she doesn\u2019t need coffee. Doesn\u2019t that mean he can just come without buying anything?\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Amy went into the library as if to show that she had no intention to answer. Sharelle followed behind quickly. She couldn\u2019t hide her excitement.\u201cHey! What are you thinking of doing? If it\u2019s actually true, that\u2019s great and all, but is that really what you were trying to say?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! Just let them think however they like. Do they have nothing better to do? Whatever, I don\u2019t have to worry about it after I enter the Advanced Class. Let them enjoy their childish jokes among themselves. It won\u2019t matter to me soon enough.\u201dShirone was so happy he felt lighter as he came down the library stairs. The ten days of torture were over. Honestly, he didn\u2019t think things would end so soon. Starting tomorrow, he could go straight to the library without wasting time.\u201cYay! I can read one more book!\u201dShirone captured Amy\u2019s heart. Such deluded schoolboys were looking at Shirone enviously as he hopped away in happiness.11 P.M.Amy closed the book and sighed.She never thought studying was fun, but she liked it as much as she liked the library. Rather than hanging out with those who gossip about other people\u2019s love affairs, or those who thought themselves more important than others, the library was a much better place.Even though it neared midnight, the library was still packed with students. They didn\u2019t care who dated who. They were racehorses running madly to achieve their dreams.Through observing them, one would realize that indulging in miscellaneous thoughts was nothing but a waste of time.But despite the fact Amy was not as much of a bookworm as them, she still ranked 1st in Class 4 and never even considered the possibility of being overthrown.Sharelle, who was sitting next to her, turned her head.\u201cHuh? Why did you close the book? Are you leaving already?\u201d\u201cYeah. I have a lot on my mind today. I\u2019ll just have a good night's rest and get up about an hour early tomorrow.\u201d\u201cReally? Then let\u2019s go together.\u201d\u201cNo. You don\u2019t have to leave early because of me. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOkay, then. See you. Make sure to get up early tomorrow.\u201dAmy smiled and packed her bag. During her 6 years in the academy, Sharelle Portrisse was her one and only friend. She was a chatterbox no different than any other kid her age, but she did her job as a student better than most. Her ranking in Class 4 was 6th from the top, so being placed in the Advanced class would not pose a problem.Amy liked Sharelle, who was a respectful competitor who could enjoy and share a mature rivalry.After encouraging her friend for a bit, Amy left the reading room.Everyone except those on night duty got off work, so the hallway was quiet. Students came to the academy to achieve their dreams, but employees were just here for the job and to make money.Amy descended down the stairs, stretching out her day\u2019s fatigue. But suddenly, she saw someone standing in the dark stairway.Pale face with large dark circles. Black hair covering the cheeks. Amy\u2019s face wrinkled once when she identified who the person was.It was Jake Ardius.He was 2nd-class nobility, and the family head was the financial executor of the royal castle. It was known that the power his family held was no less than that of a 1st-class noble family. Perhaps it was because of the family head\u2019s job.Jake was arrogant and had a rough personality. But the main reason why Amy didn\u2019t like him was because he was a student who had little to no talent. He never even put in any effort to try and compensate for it.Although he was taking the same class as her, Jake had a long way to go before he could be placed in the Advanced class. Furthermore, there had been rumors that he was the president of a research group called \u2018Black Magician\u2019.In Amy\u2019s opinion, Black Magician was a group that researched how to bully students who were better than them.Since they were not a research group approved by the school, they were not financially supported. Essentially, it was a dark circle in which kids who had an inferiority complex harassed students.Of course, they did not openly pick a fight or extort money. Since most were children of high-class nobles, if they were to act like snotty, back alley kids, they would be immediately expelled.Nevertheless, it was clear that some students in the group were active, seeing that rumors of students being attacked by Black Magician still existed.\u201cAmy, you finished early today. I was going to wait until midnight.\u201d\u201cWhy were you waiting for me? Don\u2019t you have anything better to do?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like that. I heard a rumor about you. You accepted a lowerclassman way below your level\u2026 Shirone was his name, right?\u201dAmy sighed, rubbing her forehead.\u2018Is he sane? Out of all the places, he came to talk about such a pathetic thing in front of a library?\u2019Jake put forward his coffee with an overly cheesy smile. Amy could tell just by the smell. It was the civet coffee that was popular among the nobles.\u201cI even warmed it up. The Amy I know deserves this much. I can\u2019t dirty your mouth with substandard coffee, right?\u201dAmy looked at the coffee and raised her head in absurdity.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cAs you can see, I\u2019m courting you. You already know of my family\u2019s power, and I\u2019ll be the next in charge of the finances of the royal family after my father. Am I not the perfect man for you?\u201d\u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t have private chats in the library. So you\u2019re wrong to court me in such a place and time. Oh, but you forgot the most important thing\u2026 The fact that I hate you. Something like this better not happen again.\u201dAmy stepped aside and walked down the stairs. However, Jake placed his hand against the wall and blocked her way.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d\u201cI guess I\u2019ve been too soft. I also have to consider my family's reputation, so you coming out like this puts me in a very difficult position. Isn\u2019t it the same for you? Aren\u2019t you studying that much harder so as not to disgrace the Karmis family? Look, we\u2019re concerned about the same thing.\u201dAmy snorted. No matter how prosperous the Ardius family was, the Karmis family was not one to be pushed around by small fry either. Most of all, she did not like Jake\u2019s way of talking.\u201cSays the cheapskate that only counts money.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cTo live while doing the things you want to do, that\u2019s what my family always says. We are qualitatively different from people like you, who simply take great pride in counting money while acting as if it\u2019s a big deal.\u201dHis veins popped. A normal 1st-class noble would never insult him like this.His father was a royal financial executor. The whole world begins and ends with money. It was Amy who was being immature.\u201cYou think the Karmis family is that prestigious? Think about it. You\u2019re only 1st-class in name only. How many people actually hold strong authority among those on active duty? My family can run circles around yours in terms of money. What do you think? Should we test it out if you don\u2019t believe me?\u201dAmy felt Jake\u2019s unpleasant energy and shuddered. He was the kind of man who would torment others forever if it was for his own sake. She finally realized why she was so uneasy and disturbed throughout the day. She let out a breath.\u201cThanks to you I understand. I understand why I accepted that coffee.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re different from Shirone. Simply put, you\u2019re a coward.\u201d\u201cHAHA! I\u2019m more of a coward than that lousy bastard? Should we confirm that right now and see if it\u2019s true or not?\u201d\u201cYou must be dying to do something, but if you\u2019re going to do it, get on with it. Don\u2019t waste my precious time just flapping your lips. You thought I\u2019d get scared if you tensed your eyes a little and acted all scary? By you? A coward?\u201dAmy smacked away Jake\u2019s mug. Expensive coffee splashed all over the wall, while the mug crashed down the stairs and shattered into pieces.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJake felt his blood start to boil. His hours of effort in waiting for Amy were slighted like this.\u201cHow dare a bitch like you\u2026! Keuk!\u201dHe closed his mouth shut and cowered in fear. Amy had already entered the Spirit Zone. Most likely in the Target Form of the Four Way Formation.\u201c\u2018How dare a bitch like you?\u2019 To a guy who\u2019s all bark and no bite, do I look that easy to you? If you\u2019re that angry, why not just come at me? I\u2019m willing to set you on fire right this instant.\u201dJake ground his teeth. He was mistaken to think she was a model student who only devoted herself to studying. She used to also be a vicious girl who jumped from back alley to back alley.\u201cIt\u2019s against the rules to use magic at this time.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t you have used magic first? While warming up that civet cat or something.\u201d\u201cYou crazy! How is that the same as the Four Way Formation!\u201d\"Haha!\"Amy couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing. At least he was only small fry. A small fry who gets scared once he finds out his opponent isn\u2019t easy. Most of the men she met were like that.\"Do you know why I accepted Shirone's coffee? Because he seems to take responsibility for everything. Unlike you, who immediately resorts to using his family, he does everything he can before resorting to those methods. If you don't disappear from my sight, right now, I will set you on fire. I\u2019ll burn you enough so that not even a trace of you will be left behind.\u201dJake was certain. Those were not empty promises. The red eyes of the Karmis family, which he had only heard through rumors\u2026 Her large eyes were glowing red.\"If you kill me....\u201d\"I don't care. I can take responsibility for what I do or do not do.\u201dJake clenched his teeth hard. He had never felt so humiliated before.However, in front of the pressure of the red-eyed girl, the world\u2019s #1 good-for-nothing boy named Jake, had no choice but to step back.He was already overpowered by Amy\u2019s Four Way Formation. In the hands of the first-placed student in Class 4, he knew she wasn\u2019t bluffing when she said she could burn him to nothingness.\"You will definitely pay for this, you haughty bitch!\u201dJake gritted his teeth and strode out of the library. It was only after he disappeared from view that her red eye lost its glow. Amy, who staggered for a moment, rubbed her eyes and muttered.\"So annoying. What a snob.\u201dInstead of being able to go back to her room to rest, she had to instead waste her time arguing with a bastard. That fact was unbearably irritating to her because she knew that once enough time had passed, they would resort to the same underhanded tricks again.She could not understand why all the guys clinging to her were all so equally despicable like that trash. She wondered if there was something wrong with her personality.A short laugh escaped from Amy.\"Well, it\u2019s true that there\u2019s something wrong with it.\"Amy suddenly felt sorry for Sirone.* * *Shirone, who had finally managed to escape Amy's clutches, was happy. Studying became more enjoyable when he realized how precious that 1 hour Amy took away was.He had to suffer from people\u2019s attention thanks to the scandal with a girl from the academy who was known to have the highest standards, but no one cared as much in the library. Their eagerness to study was the driving force behind why the Alpheus Magic Academy was in the top 5.Finished with today\u2019s classes, Shirone was on his way to the library while humming a tune. Then he saw a familiar face near the instructor\u2019s lodging.It was Amy's friend, Sharelle Portrisse. Shirone turned to the sight of her wandering around restlessly as if she was in a hurry to the bathroom.Although they were only at a stage where they would greet each other during the integrated class, he personally found her amiable. Unlike Amy, who growled whenever he was in sight, she would always give words of support. Though, he still hasn't figured out what she was rooting for.When Sharelle found Shirone walking towards her, her eyes widened. Then her face turned pale and she started running to him.\u201cHel\u2014\u201d\"Hey! What are you doing here right now?\u201dSharelle grabbed Shirone by the collar and shook him.\"Why are you here? If I knew about this, I wouldn't have sent Amy away!\"Shirone tilted his head. She should know that he goes straight to the library after class.\"What's going on? You have to tell me so I know.\"\"Read this! Did nothing really happen to you?\u201dSharelle held out a crumpled paper. Shirone took it silently and unfolded it. It was a short warning message sent by a sender named Black Magician.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *30 minutes ago.A guy blocked Amy and Sharelle\u2019s path as they were on their way to the library.He was a Class 5 student who was held back for a long time and was currently over the age of 23. A year ago, they knew his name because he was in the same class, but they never had a conversation with him because he had a sly personality.\"Hello, I see that you're still on the roll.\"Amy snorted along at the way he cunningly came up to her in a polite manner.\"Get out of my way. I'm busy. I have nothing to say to you.\"\"Ah, you can't be like that. I was once your classmate, but can\u2019t you give me some of your time?\u201d\"Am I the only classmate you have? There should be at least a few hundred other students who have gone through Class 5, so search for another.\u201dAlthough they were respectful to him because of his age, they could not hold back their tongues. They did not like the guy. Being a Class 5 meant he was not completely talentless, but he was distracted by things. Why would she hold a conversation with a human dog who was complacent and touched female lowerclassmen?\"Haha! I see you still have that kind of attitude, Amy.\"Amy's face darkened.\"What? What did you just say?\"She only treated him neutrally because of his age, but now he was trying to climb to the top of her head. However, just as Amy was about to burst, the guy calmly handed over a note.\"Boss wants to see you. You'd better do as you're told if you don't want us to torment your prince.\"\u201cPrince? What are you talking about?\u201dAmy frowned and read the note.\u2018We have Shirone. Come to the 14th training ground by 6 o'clock before we do something to him you won\u2019t like. If you let the teachers know, we\u2019ll make you regret it for the rest of your life, you decide.Black Magician\u2019She crumpled the note immediately.\"So what? Shirone has nothing to do with me. But let's say he does have something to do with me, you think you can just start ordering me around?\u201d\"Hoho, well that\u2019s for you to decide. I'm just a messenger.\u201dThe guy, who successfully completed his mission, put on a nasty smile and walked away.Amy, whose anger soared to her head, threw the note to the floor. Sharelle picked up the note, her hands trembled after reading the contents.Black Magician, an unidentified circle among students.\"Amy, what do we do? They are really evil. People say the reason Tyra dropped out last month was because of them.\"\"Tyra did?\"Tyra, a classmate of Class 4, was not at the level of Advanced Class, but she was a talented student who maintained at least a moderate grade to be in the Intermediate Class. So if they had actually threatened her, they must have come at her using cowardly tactics.\"I should go for now. It's because of me that Shirone was caught anyway.\"\"Let\u2019s just talk to the teachers. I'm worried about Shirone too, but it might also get dangerous for you.\"\"Teachers? Hmm\u2026\u201dAmy thought it over. Despite the bad blood between them, Shirone had a secret\u2026 Which was that he wasn\u2019t exactly of nobility.\u2018If this incident grows, rumors will spread throughout the academy, and Shirone's school life may come to an end.\u2019She was sure because she knew how the nobles felt towards anyone not of nobility.\"I'll go first. If I don't come back by 7 o'clock, then don\u2019t hesitate to report to the teachers.\"\"What do you mean? We need to tell them right away\u201d\"Sorry. There\u2019s a reason why I\u2019m doing this. I'll tell you everything when I get back, okay?\"When the always-so-confident Amy asked in this way, Sharelle did not know what to do. It was her first time ever seeing Amy like this.\"Then let\u2019s go together. We don\u2019t know how many there will be.\u201d\"You should stay and get ready to call the teachers. Don't worry. Maybe the leader is Jake. He can't do anything to me with that thing he calls his talent.\u201dSharelle knew Amy's brilliance better than anyone else. Although it was blocked by the barrier of the Advanced Class, the gap in the level between her and the rest of Class 4 was wide. Amy was a talented person who never lost her place as the lead.\"Okay, it's exactly one hour. If you don't come back by 7 o'clock sharp, I'm going to tell the teachers.\"\"Okay, I trust you. And don\u2019t worry, I'll come back safe and sound.\"* * *Upon hearing the whole story from Sharelle, Shirone was bewildered. It was surprising enough that an unruly circle called the Black Magician existed, but to hear that Amy took the risk for him\u2026 That\u2019s what truly surprised him.\"You're saying she went because of me, right? So why are you standing here, doing nothing?\"\"I don't know either! Amy told me to wait no matter what. Why the hell are you here?!\"Shirone could somewhat understand. This one-hour delay was only placed because she was confident that she could solve it herself. Also, another reason for her action was her consideration in hopes to keep his secret. It was an excellent decision to leave her friend, Sharelle, as a messenger.\"I have to go! Please do as Amy said.\"Shirone ran to the 14th training ground. There were 30 minutes left until 7 o\u2019clock, but the distance was a problem. The 14th training ground was located deep in the mountains because it was a place for actual, real-life combat.At that moment, the landscape suddenly shook and buildings quickly began to be pushed back in an instant. When he turned his head, he saw Sharelle hugging his side.\" You\u2019re running? How long do you think that\u2019s gonna take? Also, I\u2019m going with you.\"It was short-distance teleportation, a mage\u2019s essential magic. It was prohibited to use it on campus because collisions between the teleporters could occur, but it was not the time to be thinking about that.The students looked up as they heard the popping noises coming from the sound waves. Sharelle, who was holding Shirone, started teleporting away to the mountain, flashing at intervals of 10 meters each time.Arriving at the entrance of the mountain, the two quickly climbed the mountain. Teleportation was extremely dangerous as one needed to be extremely precise because one could teleport into an object and die.They arrived at the 14th training ground before 7 o\u2019clock. But Amy was not in sight. In fact, they couldn't even feel any existences nearby.\"Amy! Amy! What happened?! Are you here?!\u201d\"Maybe they took her somewhere else. I\u2019m sure they took into account the possibility of someone reporting to the teachers since the location was exposed on the note. Or maybe we were fooled?\"\"What now, what about Amy?\u201dRealizing the meticulousness of Black Magician, Shirone was convinced. They were really going to cause a huge problem this time around.\"Go down the mountain now and tell the teachers. You can go much faster without me.\"\"Amy told me to wait until 7 o'clock. She said there was a reason. What if Amy gets disappointed later?\u201d\"And that reason is because of me, so just go! Quick! It doesn\u2019t matter because I said I\u2019m fine!\"Sharelle had a blank expression. She remembered the desperate face Amy had when she read the letter.\"Really? What\u2019s going on with the two of you? Are you guys really not dating behind my back?\"\"Is this really the time? Things will get dangerous if we waste any more time!\"\"Ah, right! Okay! Stay here and don't go anywhere!\"Sharelle turned and went back the way they came. Anyway, there was no reason not to report to the teachers since telling them wouldn\u2019t harm Amy in any way.Shirone went into the mountains to search for Amy. Unlike those of nobility, he spent half his life in the mountains, so the dense forest was rather familiar.His Spirit Zone was expanded as much as possible to check for any traces of Amy. After about 10 minutes of climbing the mountain, the first footstep was finally discovered through synesthesia.\u2018They\u2019re here!\u2019But there were no further traces. Based on how the bushes were trampled, he guessed that they flew into the sky.Since Shirone didn\u2019t know any magic, there was no way for him to find Amy. Worried and troubled, Shirone wandered around for a long time. Then at one point, a sound wave exploded in the sky. Shirone turned his head fast to the source of the sound.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBOOOOOOM!Black smoke rose from Amy\u2019s face. However, if one looked closely, one could observe that there was a gap the size of a finger protecting her from the attack. It was a magic spell called Air Shield. It compressed air in order to create a barrier.\u201cA surprise attack as soon as the meeting place changed. I see you\u2019re still the same petty person from before.\u201dAmy raised herself from where she landed and looked back. The man who gave her the note stood with a fishy smile.\"Hoho, I myself have a lot of pent-up anger because of you. If you had just obediently let me, I would have had the honor of having the famous Amy's first kiss.\"\"Your tongue is as dirty as you are. But that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here. Where is Shirone?\u201dFive people fell from the sky, circling Amy. Among them was Jake, the leader of Black Magician. Looking around, he said as if he found it really surprising.\"You really came alone. Is he that precious to you that you\u2019d put yourself in harm\u2019s way?\"\u201cWhat nonsense. I alone am enough to handle all of you. I\u2019m asking again, where is Shirone?\u201d\u201cHahaha! That feeble bastard is probably in the library, completely unaware as to what his girl will be experiencing from this point on.\u201dAmy finally realized that she had been tricked. But to her, this was the better outcome. She was confident that, without hostages holding her back, the scoundrels would not be able to touch a single hair of hers.\u201cCalling me out means you\u2019re ready to die, correct?\u201d\u201cHow confident. But did you really think we\u2019d come here unprepared? If you look at the list of guys who looked down on Black Magician\u2026 You\u2019d notice that most of them were beaten half to death.\u201d\u2018There\u2019s a limit as to how far his intellect can drop. He babbles too much.\u2019Amy entered the Spirit Zone. When the shape was transformed into the Target Form of the Four Way Formation, Jake, remembering last night\u2019s incident, immediately moved to cast it as well.However, the cost of being one step behind and missing a preemptive attack was huge. Amy ignored Jake and went after the members behind him.The men hurriedly flew away when she cast consecutive Fire Strikes, her special skill. Since strike type added physical force to magic, Air Shield alone was not enough to block it.Amy quickly rotated her Spirit Zone to aim at the target. However, humans were quite unpredictable, so it was not possible to achieve 100 percent accuracy like during practice. Every time the Spirit Zone rotated or did a reverse rotation, her head throbbed.Jake manipulated the wind and soared into the sky. If Amy's specialty was fire, Jake\u2019s was wind. After all, in face-to-face combat, one lethal move would determine the outcome. When he cast the magic he was most confident in, Windcutter, a sharp wind slashed through the air.Amy didn't sense the magic approach. The cross-shaped Target Form could dramatically increase the range, but it was bound to be weak in defense compared to the sphere form. In particular, the cross-shaped target form was weak to air magic.Amy sensed Windcutter penetrating her Spirit Zone and immediately moved her body. However, by the time she moved, it was already less than a meter away.The moment Black Magician was about to celebrate in delight, her body twisted so quickly that she could not be seen. The Windcutter brushed past her red hair, freaking out Jake.\"What? How did she\u2026?\"\"It's called Schema, you bastards.\"Amy raised the cross-shaped Target Form at an angle. Seeing this, Jake hurriedly tried to flee, but her targeting speed was the best in the Intermediate class.\"Fire Strike.\"A fireball the size of a cannonball was fired. Thinking it was impossible to avoid, Jake wrapped himself in an Air Suit, a higher-level air-type magic.Jake, who was hit by the Fire Strike, crashed to the ground with a loud bang.\"ARGHH! That bitch!\"He got up and glared at Amy. The fire continued to blaze on his Air Suit as the flames sucked in oxygen from it. With his whole body covered in flames, he looked like a demon. Jake detonated his Air Suit and the flames came down like petals. However, because the physical force of the strike had already made its mark, his stomach was damaged.\"I'll kill you!\"\"Hohoho! Did you actually think you could defeat me with your meager level of skill? You\u2019re far from moving up, let alone graduating. You\u2019re at the perfect level to fail. You should be focused on your studies, not on girls, you dipshit!Amy, the genius of the Karmis family. Indeed, the difference in their skills was as vast as their fame.But then suddenly, Jake smiled wickedly.\"I doubt that. Your reign of terror ends here.\"As if to prove that he wasn\u2019t bluffing, members of Black Magician held out their hands at the same time. Then Amy's face paled. It was a strange sensation that she had never encountered before. Something had entered her mind and was messing with it.Amy glared at Jake with anger.\"This is... Anti-Magic?\"\"Hahaha! Are you surprised? This is the Black Magician's specialty. It's also the magic that sends countless talents back home.\"\"How crude!\"It really was a cheap shot. Anti-magic, it was a magic prohibited in the academy due to the dangers it brought. It was the Achilles Heel of all mages.Five resonance waves messed up Amy's Spirit Zone. It felt like someone gripped her head and was shaking it like crazy.Amy knelt down, unable to hold on. If she kept staying in the Zone any longer, she felt she\u2019d go crazy.With a victor\u2019s smile on his face, Jake cast Air Chain. Chains made of air wrapped around Amy\u2019s limbs and lifted her up.Trapped and unable to move, Amy struggled with all her might. However, it was a binding force that could not be escaped, even after she activated Schema.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\"Heh, I finally got you. The feisty female kitten.\"Jake pulled out a pocket knife.\"Well, well, well. Now, what should I do with you? For your information, I still remember what you did a few days ago. I'm in the mood to commit something.\u201d\"I\u2019m warning you, if you put even a single scratch on me, you won't be safe.\"\"PUHAHAHA! Is the great Amy calling forth her family now that she\u2019s cornered? I told you so, we're all the same. After all, without you\u2019re family, you're just a bitch who can't do anything.\u201d\"Don't place me on the same level as scum like you, I\u2019m pretty sure I told you this, too. I'll make sure to get rid of you with my own hands.\"Jake's eyes were filled with hatred. Even in this situation, her attitude of not swallowing her pride was pissing him off. The hand that held the knife trembled as if it was about to stab something.\"You\u2019re not exactly in a position to talk like that right now. Do you want me to \u2018scribble\u2019 on your face? I'm sure there'd be no one who\u2019d bother to follow you around if you become an ugly bitch.\"Amy became slightly afraid after seeing Jake's abnormal eyes. They held an inferiority that had no bounds. He really meant every word.Jake grabbed the blade with his other hand. Although he wasn\u2019t skillful in fire magic, he knew enough to easily heat the knife. The knife started to glow red.\u201cLet\u2019s do this. The arrogant Amy ruined her eyes while researching magic by herself. She dropped out of the academy and forever lived on as a loser. How\u2019s that? Amazing scenario, is it not?\u201dThe blade seemed like it would drip molten iron at any moment. A sudden shove to her head made Amy turn. Her burning hair crackled and popped.\"Oho! So there are times when Amy gets scared, too. I'll give you one last chance. Beg me to let you off this once. Even better if you shed tears. Then, if you promise to leave the academy, I won\u2019t burn off your eyes.\u201dAmy realized why Tyra dropped out.They did this simply because they were inferior. Simply because they were upset and offended. Karmis\u2019 red eyes filled with anger and glowed red.\"Do it if you can. But don't ever think you'll get away with it.\"Jake smirked. He\u2019d heard that kind of promise more than once. All Nobles were unyielding. However, the moment a blade is pointed their way, they\u2019d shout and beg for mercy like any other human.The bigger their self-esteem, the harder it was for them to recover once it was broken. Watching the students leave the academy like that, Jake soothed his feelings of inferiority.\"Well then, shall we get started?\"The pocket knife slowly approached Amy's left eye. Amy was determined to endure it. However, when she felt the scorching heat nearing her skin, she was forced to close her eyelids tight.\"Stop, you sick bastards!\"A sudden shout made the Black Magician jump. Seeing Shirone who was huffing with a clenched fist, Amy opened her eyes wide. Jake also turned around with a startled expression, as if he didn\u2019t expect him to actually face them.\"Aha! The knight in shining armor has made his appearance! That\u2019s too bad, your girl would have surprised you with a new appearance if you\u2019d arrived just a bit later.\u201d\"What are you trying to do to her?\u201d\"Who knows! What was I going to do? Why not ask your lover yourself?\"\"You dimwit! You can't come here alone!\"Amy shouted. Yet Shirone was more stunned by the situation in front of him than by her words.Older students were surrounding a girl who had her limbs shackled. And if that alone was not enough, the rascal, Jake, was wielding a red-hot pocket knife.'Because of me....\u2019For the first time in his life, Shirone felt an intense wrath bubble up inside him. Picking up a tree branch from the ground, he hollered!\"Let her go! If you don't, I won't let you off easy!\u201d\"PUHAHAHA! Did you hear that? What can you possibly do with that piece of wood?\u201dIrrespective of Jake\u2019s mocking laughter, Shirone rushed straight at them. He was confident in his skill in close-quarters combat. After all, he was the person who had defeated Rian in a swordsmanship match. After calculating it in his head, he knew he could buy enough time for the teachers to arrive.\"Here I come!\"\"Guys, he says he\u2019s coming. Open a path for him.\"No one moved when Shirone came running. Rather, they smiled tauntingly, as if wanting for him to come closer.By the time he realized something was amiss, it was too late. Shirone\u2019s mind shook as if he had been hit on the head with a hammer.\"Keuk!\"\"You stupid! Get rid of your Spirit Zone! It's Anti-Magic!\"Anti-Magic? Shirone finally realized what was happening. He realized how Amy, who securely held her place as the first in Class 4, was caught by these rascals.It was truly a tremendous shock and vibration. The resonance wave caused by the five people shook his mind.Shirone raised his head. Colors smeared and shuffled around as if the world had been dunked underwater. But he couldn't give up here. Holding onto his distant consciousness, Shirone slowly, but surely walked.\"Amy, I\u2019m gonna save you now.\"\"I told you to stop! You\u2019ll never be able to cast magic for the rest of your life! You'll become a cripple!\"\"Because of me... This happened.\u2026.\u201d\"Get rid of your Spirit Zone! Quickly!\"She knew Shirone was in a state where he couldn't hear, but all she could do was shout. With every step he took, she felt her tears start to well up more and more.Shirone clenched his teeth hard and kept up his Spirit Zone.\u2018No! I have to hang on! I need more frames!\u2019Responding to his strong will, his Spirit Zone gradually began to change into the Defensive Form of the Four Way Formation. This time, it was the Black Magician\u2019s turn to be dismayed. Casting Anti-Magic was not an easy feat, but maintaining it against a strong force was even harder. They felt as if they were being crushed by a boulder.\"Wh-What?! What's going on?! \"Shirone extended his Spirit Zone to the max. It was shaking precariously like dew on a leaf, but he continued to press on.\u2018I have to push even harder! So stable that it can\u2019t collapse! So hard that it can\u2019t be destroyed!'Finally, as the frames started to connect, Shirone\u2019s Spirit Zone regained stability. Then, like a domino game, one after the other, members of the Black Magician wailed in pain.\"Keuk! What\u2019s happening?! My head\u2019s pounding!\"At that moment Shirone's eyes lit up. As the Four Way Formation\u2019s Defense Form was completed to perfection, the huge sphere was tightened into a cube. The pain caused by the Anti-Magic disappeared, while a feeling of sturdiness flooded in. Shirone felt like he could crush even diamond.\"ARRGHHHHH!\"The five who cast the Anti-Magic collapsed, screaming. They felt as if they were being crushed by something. They couldn't even lift a finger and were bleeding from the nose.This was why the academy banned the use of Anti-Magic. If one didn\u2019t cultivate the mind enough, Anti-Magic was a poison that destroyed the mind.Amy was shocked to see the tossing and turning Black Magicians. Five Anti-Magic casters were crushed by one brand-new class-7 student\u2026Shirone felt as if a small lizard was under the soles of his feet. He felt a wiggling sensation in his mind, but that was all. And as time passed, even such resistance faded. They released the Anti-Magic right as their minds were about to collapse.Amy burned the air chain with fire magic and landed on the floor. Through her own Spirit Zone, Amy could feel the shape Shirone\u2019s Spirit Zone was in. It was extremely cold, hard, and heavy.\u2018No way. How is this possible\u2026\u2019Shirone still had fierce eyes. When he took a step forward, Jake stepped back unknowingly. It was the result of his instinct that didn't want to bump into Shirone\u2019s Spirit Zone.However, the 15-meter-diameter Spirit Zone could not be avoided by taking a step back. Eventually, their two Spirit Zones overlapped, and Jake asked with a stricken look.\"You\u2026Who the hell are you?\"It was something beyond belief\u2026 But a Spirit Zone\u2019s synesthesia didn\u2019t lie. A huge cube comprised of 88 sides was surrounding Shirone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBlack Magician.A research group created by six problem children, led by Jake.Aside from Jake, it was a group of students who had no dreams or futures and were students who were repeatedly held back.There was a time when they, too, were noticed as brilliant talents\u2026 If only they had the spirit to try again, they could have made great achievements.But they took their hands off the competition. In a way, they were the only losers in the fierce competition.\"This can\u2019t be. There must be something wrong.\u201dJake shook his head. This may have been possible for Amy, but it should have been impossible for Black Magician to lose to a freshman who had just enrolled.\"Yeah. I didn't lose. I just got unlucky.\u201dSo far, the students Jake had forced to drop out had excellent grades. How could Shirone even compare? Jake felt he was just unlucky.\u2018Doesn't everyone go through a day like this in their lives?\u2019\u2018It's not over yet. I'm a Class 4. I\u2019m naturally different from those backstabbers who use Anti-Magic.\u2019After reading Jake\u2019s deadly atmosphere, Shirone tensed. Jake's Spirit Zone, which turned into a star shape, was felt by Shirone through synesthesia. It felt as if hundreds of archers were aiming their bow at him.\u2018What do I do? I haven't learned magic yet.\u2019He was able to resist Anti-Magic because it was a battle fought using the Spirit Zone, but a magic battle was a completely different story.There was no way Shirone, who had not mastered any offensive or defensive magic, could face Jake.Jake called forth wind between his palms and pressed them down to compress. Then the air began to rotate in the form of a disk. It was Windcutter, a magic that could easily cut through tree trunks.\"I'll take your arms first. Then your legs.\"Just as Jake was about release the Windcutter, someone grabbed his shoulder from behind and turned him around. The person touched his body at the same time Jake sensed their approach through synesthesia. The speed at which the person moved was inhuman.Amy's face appeared right in front of him with eyes glowing red. As her fist smacked his chin, the scenery in front of him shook.\"Argh!\"To a mage who was not well-rounded physically, physical attacks were like rat poison. And in addition to that, being attacked by a punch that contained the power of Schema would do even greater harm. Their Spirit Zone would not be able to withstand it.Amy got on Jake's stomach and threw out a barrage of punches. The power of a single strike was like being struck down by a big stone.\"What did you say you were going to do to me? I dare you to blabber again, you bastard! Say it!\"Jake's head snapped side to side as if it were close to being yanked out. Worried that something terrible would happen if left as is, Shirone ran to Amy.\"Amy, stop it! He\u2019s going to die at this rate!\"\"Let go of me, you bastard! You must have thought I was easy to target, Jake!\"\"He\u2019s going to die!\"Jake heard the conversation as his consciousness slowly started fading away. He no longer felt pain, only a dull shock traveled from his face to his body whenever Amy struck.\u2018Die? I'm going to die?\u2019The fear of death awoke Jake's mind. He covered his face with his arms and shouted at the top of his lungs.\"H-Help me! Just spare my life! Please!\"Amy\u2019s eyes watered. She had almost lost her eyes. She had been on the brink of going blind. Remembering that she had been shamed by this good-for-nothing scum, she felt her blood boil even hotter.\"I will never forgive you! You sick bastard!\"\"Amy, please stop!\"Shirone tried to pull Amy back with all his might. He felt like he was pulling out a wooden stake stuck in the ground due to her Schema. But, when he pulled her one last time with a forceful tug, Amy fell back and crushed Shirone.\"That's plenty enough, Amy. Please stop it.\"Shirone was breathing hard. When he came to his senses, Shirone felt something soft and tender against his arm. Realizing that he was pressing Amy's chest, he hurriedly pulled his arm away.\"S-Sorry!\"Amy was unresponsive. She was only shivering sporadically as she exhaled and inhaled roughly. Her body was clearly reacting to how she was feeling, so Shirone, feeling sorry for her, gently hugged her waist and softly said.\"Amy, because of me\u2014\u201d\"AHH! That felt soooooo refreshing!\"\"Ack!\"Amy bounced up, ramming Shirone's lower abdomen with her butt.Shirone turned around, clutching his abdomen. If he had been hit a little further down, a horrible situation he did not wish to further imagine could have happened.\"What's wrong? Are you not feeling good somewhere?\"He was able to avoid the vulnerable spot, but a cold sweat broke out on his forehead because the impact poured downwards. But he did not show it.\"No\u2026 It\u2019s nothing.\"\"Hehe! Of course you should be. I know how light I am.\"There was no way that Amy, who had been a very curious girl since childhood, was unaware of Shirone's \u2018state\u2019. It was a sign of her own friendliness, as she was poor at expressing emotions. It also reflected Shirone's success trying to quietly overlook the dangerous collision with Amy a minute ago.\"Anyways, what now?\"Shirone changed the subject and turned to the members of Black Magician. He didn't notice while they were chaotically fighting, but after assessing the situation after things had settled down, he noticed the condition of the boys was serious.All of them fainted with bloody noses, and Jake was crawling on the ground, half-dead.After examining their wrecked faces, Amy decided to cover the situation at this point. She wanted to expel them from the academy, but if the case grew bigger, Shirone's identity could be revealed.\"Let's head down. They'll lay low now that they have something to feel remorseful about.\"\"But Sharelle is probably on her way.\u201d\"What? Did you perhaps tell the teacher?\u201d\"Of course. How can I come alone when you're in danger?\"Amy sighed, facepalming. She could accept the fact that she was humiliated, but Amy thought that she could at least enjoy the victory. However, she was bummed out by the fact that the incident had already been reported to the teachers.Shirone was deeply moved. The reason Amy was disappointed was because she was trying to keep his secret.\"Thank you, Amy.\"\"Hmm?\"* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\"You came here all by yourself because of me.

There were times when she felt neglected in the freewheeling atmosphere of the Karmis family. She yearned for human affection. She wandered through the back alleys to search for it. Shirone's kind words made her happy, but at the same time, she couldn\u2019t completely digest them.\"Hmph! Who said it's because of you? It was only because I could handle these guys on my own. In fact, I've been thinking of doing this for a while now\u2026 I just had the perfect chance to carry out that plan today.\"Amy's cheeks were completely red. Shirone was satisfied. He felt like he knew what she was like.\"Kekeke, you\u2019re so childish it makes me cringe. You call yourself geniuses? As if. You guys are just a bunch of ignorant kids.\u201dJake stood up with his hand against a tree. His face was a mess, but his eyes were full of malice.Amy placed her hand on her waist and spoke.\"You are really pathetic. If you can't even stand up properly, just stay sprawled on the ground. Are you a pervert? You like being punched by me that much?\u201d\"Puhahaha!\"There was no such thing as defeat in Jake\u2019s mind. After all, it was money that ruled the world. He may have lost this fight, but he still had strong financial power.\"You think everything is over? No, this is just the beginning. Let\u2019s be honest, you can't actually kill me, can you? Kill me if you\u2019re so confident. You guys will never graduate as long as I'm here. I'll destroy you guys through any means necessary!\"Shirone was appalled. However, Amy, who had dominated the back alleys since she was young, knew people like Jake all too well.\"Kill you? Why should I kill you? I\u2019d only be wasting my time on a guy like you. But keep this in mind\u2026 I won\u2019t kill you, but I can still beat the living daylights out of you.\"Jake flinched as Amy walked towards him with a clenched fist. No matter how hard he tried to stay strong, his body remembered the fear afflicted by her previously.\"...Do you think I\u2019m scared?\"\"Did someone say something? Since you\u2019re up and talking, I should beat you again. I still haven\u2019t gotten over what you did to me.\"Jake choked up seeing Amy's dramatic motion of rolling her shoulders, and his face was distorted in fear.Screeeeeeeech!A shrill fricative/sound was heard from the sky. Shirone looked up, but the other two knew without looking.It was a noise unique to Spatial Warp, an upper-level of teleportation magic.The moment Shirone thought starlight was shining in the sky, the flash quickly bent and came down to the place where he and the others were.Sharelle landed with two instructors.With a restless heart, Amy glimpsed at the instructors\u2019 faces. Then she let out a small sigh.It was Siena of the Ice and Thadd of the Flames.\u2018Ugh, of all the possible teachers\u2026\u2019Along with Ethella, the youngest instructor at the magic academy, there was no way they would handle this incident lightly.\"Amy! Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?\u201dSharelle ran to Amy with a crying face.\"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm not so easily beaten, you know.\u201dSharelle didn't miss a small change as she had a sensitive personality. Amy's bangs, which flowed down as if slightly covering her right eye, were burned.Although she had thought that Amy's hairstyle was too retro compared to her pretty appearance, Sharelle\u2019s heart ached when her friend's hair, which she\u2019d been sticking with for six years, was ruined.\"Why is your hair like that? What happened?\"\"Oh, geez! I said it\u2019s nothing. By the way, is it already past 7 o'clock?\u201d\"What do you mean? Do you know how long we've been looking for you? I wouldn\u2019t have arrived in time without the instructors.\"The sun had set and it was getting dark.As the surroundings became dark, Thadd casted a fire magic. The ball of flame soared up and lit up the surrounding area like a small sun.\u2018So this is the Fire Sun magic.\u2019Shirone admired the glowing sphere in the sky. The heat wasn\u2019t felt even though the surroundings brightened as if struck by broad daylight.This was impossible without converting thermal energy into light energy. According to a book Shirone read, the Fire Sun, unlike its appearance, was an advanced skill and was mainly seen on a battlefield.Thadd approached Amy with a tearful face.\"What's going on, Amy! How could a brilliant kid like you do such a foolish thing\u2026\u201dThadd, who was only vulnerable to women, did not seem to care about Shirone. In particular, Amy's grades were first place, her family was first class, and her appearance was also top one, so he couldn't help but worry.Disgusted by Thadd\u2019s attitude, Siena turned to Shirone.\"Shirone, can you explain what's going on?\u201d\"Oh, umm, the thing is\u2026\u201d\"Let me tell you what happened.\"At Jake\u2019s words, the instructors turned their heads. The person who was responsible for the incident said he would explain it. It was questionable whether something went wrong in his brain after being punched so hard numerous times.But this was also part of Jake's calculations.He would only be hit with disciplinary actions. A school that needs the funding of the Ardius family would never be able to throw him out.On the other hand, what about Shirone? Jake heard clearly about Shirone having some kind of a secret in the conversation a while ago. And along with Amy's behavior to cover it up. That meant there was something fishy going on.\"I called Amy out. But since her skills are far superior compared to mine, I had no choice but to use Anti-Magic\u2026 But it was fair play. The emotions that had stacked up over time eventually led to a battle for pride. As you can see, it's only our side that has been seriously injured.\"Siena spoke with a disgruntled look.\"Are you telling me to believe that? You guys broke the academy rules.\u201d\"I'm not saying I did anything good. But think about it. If Amy's a victim, why didn't she report this? Since they\u2019re trying to cover up this incident, they must be also guilty of something.\"Amy shouted.\"What the hell are you saying?! What do you mean we\u2019re trying to hide something?! You were the one who threatened to kidnap Shirone!\u201d\"Haha! But did we actually kidnap him? We did not. Moreover, Shirone didn't inform the teachers after reading the note we sent. What do you think this means?\u201d\"You\u2026 You bastard\u2026\u201dAmy couldn\u2019t refute. It would not be understandable to anyone who did not know the actual circumstances behind the matter. After all, Shirone, who had not been kidnapped, came running without reporting to the instructors. However, if she were to tell the truth, Shirone\u2019s secret would be revealed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJake mounted his high horse.\u2018Behold, this is the real battle of adults. In this world, dirty, cheap humans will always end up winning. Kekeke. Goodbye, Amy. Even if I fall into hell, I\u2019ll make sure to bring you with me.'\"Don't get cocky, Jake.\"Siena narrowed her ice-cold eyes and spoke.\"I\u2019ve already heard from Sharelle before coming here. You won't be able to attend this academy anymore.\u201d\"Don't make such assumptions. You're a teacher who teaches students. You\u2019re not a part of the management team, correct?\u201d\"What did you say?\"\"You know how much the Ardius family donates, don't you? It's more than 10 first-class aristocrats combined. You think you can expel me?\u201dMost aristocratic academies ran on a donation system. It was for the maintenance of expensive equipment. If the equipment was underdeveloped or outdated, students would not be able to reach their highest potential. If their grades drop, the title of being one of the top prestigious academies would be taken away, and the vicious cycle of talented students being reluctant to enter would repeat.If there was history and tradition to back up an academy, it would at least be able to hold out to some extent. However, that was not the case for Alpheas Magic Academy as it was an emerging one that was only 30 years old, it needed support from the nobles.It was Thadd, a graduate of Alpheas Magic Academy, who knew this better than anyone else. If the money from Jake's family disappeared, they would be financially damaged.\"Ms. Siena, I think you\u2019re being a bit too hasty regarding the talk of expulsion. Wouldn't that matter be for the disciplinary committee to decide?\"\"No. Jake is expelled. If we don\u2019t expel him from the academy, how will we be able to face those who dropped out? If Jake stays, I will take responsibility as a fellow instructor and resign.\"Thadd imagined an academy without Siena and immediately stamped out the thought. Much to Thadd\u2019s displeasure, she was a woman with a cold personality\u2026 But he knew she had great magical qualities. Her quitting the academy was a different matter from Jake's expulsion.Jake\u2019s shoulders shook as he laughed.\"Hahaha! You\u2019ll quit? I\u2019m down for it! Let\u2019s see if it will be the teacher or me who leaves first.\u201dFrost materialized on Siena\u2019s shoulder. Since she was an ice mage, even her boiling anger manifested through cold ice.\"Where do you think your salary comes from? How do the libraries buy their books? What about the money to open a training ground? Expensive magic devices? At the end of the day, the world revolves around money! Money! There's nothing in this world that can\u2019t be achieved through money!\u201dAt that moment, Siena raised her hand. Jake looked around at the ground around his feet in bewilderment. The moment he felt his surroundings get chilly, cold air whirled above ground in a vortex.\u201cKeuk!\u201dRealizing that it was an Ice Tornado that would drop the temperature of the air on call, Jake curled up and covered his face.CRRAACKKK!The whirlwind of frost ascended and trapped Jake. Hundreds of icicles revealed themselves as the air froze over.\"Ughh!\"A sharp icicle scraped past Jake's face, shoulders, sides, and legs. Jake couldn't move an inch. It was as if he was trapped in a mold.'Wow! That's amazing.\u2019Shirone genuinely admired Siena\u2019s work. Even if a mage was omnipotent, it was difficult to control the freezing phenomenon at a molecular level. The rumor that she was a genius mage coveted by the royal palace was no exaggeration.\"How dare a student lecture me, an instructor? Unlike what that minuscule brain of yours might think, there are many things in this world that money cannot buy.\"Jake scrunched up his face. There was nothing in this world that money could not buy. He grew up watching countless nobles turn into mindless beasts when faced with the gold he would at times present to them.\"Something you can't buy with money? What the hell is that?\"\"Talent.\"Jake flinched. Siena stabbed where it hurt most.\"Quality. Personality. Faith. Intelligence. Trust. Effort. True willingness. Should I continue?\u201dJake wanted to scream. Why was this woman bothering him? As long as he could shut that blabbering mouth of hers, he didn't care about how much money he\u2019d have to give. He just wanted her to shut up.The Ice Tornado shattered into pieces when Siena flicked her finger. The ice shards smacked Jake in the face with no remorse.\"Eeeukk...\"Jake didn\u2019t even have the courage to open his eyes. He was terrified. He was worried that his face might get ruined by the sharp ice shards.\"Now you understand, Jake? Money can't buy everything\u2026 And that is why you don't have anything.\u201dSiena, who had grabbed Jake by the collar, pulled him hard and looked him dead in the eyes.\"Urgh!\"\"So, I\u2019m telling you, don't get too full of yourself. The Academy is the only place that teaches you things that money can't buy\u2026 And you just took that for granted. When you leave this academy, no one will teach you these things\u2026 Because no one outside of this place truly can.\"Jake had a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. He had never thought about that. A situation wherein he would not be attending the academy.Siena would definitely expel him. If that happened, he wouldn\u2019t be able to challenge anything. That's how he would become a loser and stay one for the rest of his life.The son of the Ardius family labeled a loser\u2026'It's over. I'm...\u2019An appearance of a young juvenile boy gradually began to emerge from his pale-stricken face. Jake, with a scrunched-up face as if he was about to cry, knelt at Siena's feet and burst into tears.\"I'm sorry, Ms. Olifer. I was wrong. Please, don't kick me out of the academy. Give me a second chance. I won't do this again. I'll really study hard from now on.\"Shirone\u2019s company became solemn. They understood how scary it would be for a student if they were to get kicked into the real world.Siena bent her knees and pulled Jake.\u201cWhen the disciplinary committee is held, sincerely apologize. That\u2019s the bare minimum you need to do in order to put everything back in place. I will be on your side, so let's do this one step at a time.\"\"Thank you! Thank you so much!\"Shirone realized again that there were so many things that money couldn\u2019t buy. Many students here also had to work their butts off in order to advance and achieve their goals.So what if you were a commoner or an aristocrat? Not all dreams could be achieved with money.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Members of Black Magician were confined to a punishment room and treated.The disciplinary committee was scheduled to be held around tomorrow, and Shirone\u2019s group had a separate meeting with the instructors.As Thadd wrote the affidavit, Shirone detailed how he suppressed Black Magician. As expected, the instructors\u2019 eyes widened.\"What? You overpowered Anti-Magic with your Spirit Zone?\"\"Yes, I heard from Ms. Romie that Anti-Magic is a magic that requires high mental fortitude, so casting it recklessly is dangerous. I guess I tried to hold out with the Defense Form without realizing it.\u201dEveryone, except Amy, was speechless.Of course, if one did not specialize in Anti-Magic, it was difficult to achieve full efficiency. However, even taking that into account, it was a simultaneous attack by five people against one.This kind of result would have been impossible if Shirone\u2019s Spirit Zone was not stronger than all of the five Black Magician members combined.Siena leaned her face close to Shirone\u2019s. She lifted his eyelids around to observe his pupils, and when no abnormal findings were found, she sighed in relief\"Never do that again. Anti-magic is a much more dangerous magic than you might believe. We made it through safely this time, but if things had been different, someone could have ended up crippled with no way to use magic.\u201dEven Shirone, who had nerves of steel, felt a sinking feeling when he heard such a possibility directly from Siena. At the time, all that was going through his head was \u2018protect Amy\u2019.Amy avoided his gaze. Since she was the one who put Sirone in danger, it was natural for her to have a guilty conscience.Siena rested her chin on her hand and got lost in thought. To be able to subdue Anti-Magic meant that you had great talent. She knew from the beginning that he had excellent durability, but she didn't expect it to be this splendid.Thadd, on the other hand, scowled in disapproval. He got annoyed that Shirone could do something Amy couldn\u2019t.With that in mind, Thadd said.\"Shirone, why didn't you tell us right away? The first thing you should have done was report it to us, not fly over and then report. I can't understand why you, by yourself, went to go save a senior who is in a much higher class than you.\"Shirone and Amy felt that the time had finally come.For once, Siena did not step in to stop Thadd. Since they were in a situation that involved Black Magician, an organization that has forced multiple students to drop out, she wanted to get at least this cleared up.Shirone smiled and nodded to Amy who had a questioning look. Even if the secret was revealed, he wouldn\u2019t resent her.Amy sighed as if she could not do it.\"Okay. I'll tell you the truth.\"Sharelle was more curious about Shirone\u2019s secret than anyone else. How long have they known each other? No, rather than that, why was Amy covering for him?\"Actually, Shirone is\u2026\u201dAs everyone waited in anticipation, Amy scratched her head, and with a big smile, she said\u2026\"My lover.\"\"WHAT?!\"The unexpected answer shook the room.Despite his disbelief, Thadd pressed her for answers.\"Since when? You were never interested in dating. Besides, Shirone is a freshman who just entered the academy.\"\"I met him when I was young, haha! This is common, is it not?\"Amy made a fuss on purpose.\u2018This should do it.\u2019After all, she would soon graduate to the Advanced Classes anyways, and she wouldn\u2019t run into Shirone much if their class time was different.It would be noisy for a while, but it wasn't a bad thing. If students found out that she had a lover, there would be fewer boys chasing her around.It was an excellent improvisation, she thought.On the other hand, Shirone, who had to accept this new announcement, had a pounding heart. Amy was a higher-than-high upperclassman and was the object of envy for quite a lot of students. He knew this was just something to solve the current situation, but to say it was a huge burden was no lie.\"Right, Shirone?\"Amy looked back, smiling with her eyes. It was obvious it was forced. Shirone felt like he could hear her voice threatening to kill him if he did not answer quickly.\"Oh! Yes, yes that's right.\"\"KYAAA! How could this happen? I'm shocked, no, I'm moved! My heart\u2019s throbbing with emotions.\"Sharelle slapped herself and spoke quickly.\"Hoho, I thought so from a long time ago! No wonder this girl always turns nice whenever she sees you! When did you guys start dating?! Who confessed first?!\u201dSince Amy's friend, Sharelle, believed the story, even the instructors could not help but suppose it was true. If they actually were a couple, Shirone chasing after Black Magician with such vigor was not surprising.Thadd wrote the affidavit as he tore out his hair.\"The victims of this incident, Shirone and Amy, have a relationship\u2026\u201d* * *The rumor spread quickly.There was no student at Alpheas Magic Academy who did not know that Shirone and Amy were lovers. The news became so big partly because of the shocking behavior of Black Magician, but it was mainly thanks to the saga delivered by the chatterbox Sharelle.Shirone infiltrates the enemy's camp alone to protect his lover. Black Magician fought back with Anti-Magic, but he overcame it with the power of love and rescued Amy.The villain boss Jake was overwhelmed by the gleam in Shirone's eyes and shed tears. And with a runny nose, he begged for forgiveness. After everything was done and dusted, the two kissed each other amidst the moonlit mountains.\"SHARELLE!!! You wanna die?! Why the hell did you run around spreading such a baseless rumor?!\u201d\"KEKEKE! Why? It\u2019s all facts! roughly.\"\"Roughly? Roughly?! That also means not everything is true! When the hell did I kiss Shirone?!\u201d\"Oh my, don\u2019t act so coy. You said you guys were dating. And since you two have been dating each other for quite a while, you must\u2019ve already kissed. Don't you think you need this much to dramatize things?\u201d\"Are you some kind of a playwright? Why are you dramatizing other people's stories on your own?\"\"Well, isn\u2019t this better? The boys who were bothering you won\u2019t dare to come close now! Hahaha!\"\u201cSHARELLE!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThat bit was a plus for Amy. Not only were they dating, but they\u2019ve also kissed, at least according to the rumor. So the boys who chased her around were in a state of panic.\u201cWhat are you gonna do about today? Aren\u2019t you going to go meet Shirone? Hm? Hmm?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know. We both agreed to focus on studying for the time being.\u201dThere was a hint of disappointment in Amy\u2019s tone.\u2018I know we\u2019re only fake dating, but even so, how can he be so indifferent?\u2019Her pride was hurt by Shirone's stone-cold attitude. It was no princess syndrome, but whenever Amy looked in the mirror, she herself thought her appearance was enough to turn heads. But Shirone seemed to have zero interest, seemingly because of his concentration on studies. Even if it was only a pretend relationship, they were definitely an \u201cofficial couple\u201d in the eyes of most.\u2018Shouldn\u2019t he be at least a little conscious?\u2019\"I don't know and I don\u2019t care either. I have a pile of work to do. I don\u2019t have time to get distracted.\u201d\"You're disappointed, aren't you? Well if you are, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. I also think Shirone is being too harsh. How could he leave such a pretty girlfriend unattended? I'd stick together around all day if I were him. Oho! Maybe that part was what cracked the iron-hearted Amy\u2019s heart?\"Sharelle...\"When she saw Amy's eyes burning red, Sharelle shook around her hand and released cold sweat.\"Haha\u2026 Okay, okay! I\u2019ll stop!Amy let out her anger with a snort. In a sense, Shirone was well aware of the situation. If he was distracted by something he shouldn\u2019t be distracted by, it wouldn\u2019t be worth it for her to keep up their relationship, even if it did chase away the boys.\"Oh! Amy, isn't that Jake over there?\"Jake was coming down a hill. He had bandages all over his face and was carrying a large backpack on his shoulder.The disciplinary committee had decided to put those part of Black Magician on probation for two years. With a condition that they ask for forgiveness from the students who dropped out, but anyone could tell there was an unusual leniency.\"Hey! Long time no see, Amy.\"Jake's face was bright, unfitting for someone who was essentially getting kicked out for two years.\"You still haven't left? Gosh, so clingy.\u201d\"Kekeke! I\u2019ve done so many bad things that there are a lot of places I need to pass by.\"\"That doesn\u2019t suit you. Did you change? Hah, no way. How can a person's personality change so easily?\u201d\"That\u2019s true. But there are people who trust a wastrel like me, so now I can't do anything bad anymore.\"It was known among students that Siena struggled with the committee to lower Jake's disciplinary penalty. If it weren't for her, Black Magician wouldn't have been able to avoid expulsion from the academy.\"By the way, what are you going to do now? Taking two years off will make you have to drop your classes.\u201d\"I\u2019ll have to beg for forgiveness from the kids who dropped out. They probably won't forgive me, but I'm prepared. And in any case, won\u2019t something come to mind after I try and put everything back to how it was before?\"Amy didn\u2019t think it would be easy. Most of the kids who were tormented by Jake were first-class nobles and suffered from injuries that could not be healed, so the possibility of Jake getting beaten to death was not completely out of the question.However, the one who knew this better than anyone else was Jake himself, and yet instead of being afraid, he was rather relaxed.\"I've got to go. You'll be graduating by the time I get back. I don't know when the opportunity will come, but when that time comes, I will do my best. Take care. I wish you the best with your relationship.\"As Jake turned around with a wave of his hand, Amy responded with an awkward smile. Even Jake, the person involved in the case, found it absurd when he thought back to how Amy was dating Shirone.Despite what happened, seeing him being sent off in this shabby way left a bit of a bitter taste in Amy\u2019s mouth as a fellow student. She thought for a moment as she remembered something. She called out to Jake.\"Hey, Jake!\"He looked back.\"Two years will go by real quick! Don't give up!\"\"Haha! Call me whenever you need my help. At the very least, I can help by lending you as much money as you need!\"\"Two years... Yeah, it's probably nothing. It\u2019ll go by quick.\"Amy thought as she looked at Jake\u2019s figure growing smaller and smaller in the distance. He would not be able to go to school for at least two years. But was that really something to cry about? After all, if one didn\u2019t have the skills, one would rot in the same place for the rest of their life, anyways. That was the world of magic.\"Sharelle, I've made up my mind.\"\"Hm? Are you going to see Shirone?\"\"I'm going to apply for promotion to the Advanced class.\"\"What? Already? Aren\u2019t you being too hasty?\"Upon entering Class 4, you were automatically eligible to apply for the Advanced Class. However, if you were to fail the promotion exam, you would not be able to apply again that year, so the battle of nerves had been fierce since the beginning of the semester.Not to mention, graduation was a long way off, even if you were to pass the promotion exam. This was because only the best talents could enter the Advanced Class out of the whole magic academy where many geniuses were gathered.According to graduates of the magic academy, the Advanced Class was a battlefield far more fierce than the one in society. It was a place where only 30 prospective mages competed for survival, having to put aside their friendship for the time being.Some criticized this system of infinite competition, but considering the specificity of the job as a mage, it was inevitable.The Alpheas Magic Academy was a state-designated institution, meaning if you graduated, you\u2019d receive a non-certified license, which meant you were recognized as an official mage. Essentially, as long as you graduated, you were given \u201cinstant power\u201d.In the worst-case scenario, the students would have to fight for their lives on a battlefield once they graduated, so instructors shared the common opinion that strict standards had to be imposed on the Advanced Class students.\"Why don't you wait a little bit? The garden is still empty, and it won\u2019t be too late to apply after analyzing the level of the Advanced class and its trends, right?\u201d\"No, I don't want to dwell on it. I just want to keep moving forward right now.\"Knowing how stubborn Amy could get, Sharelle knew she couldn\u2019t stop her. On the other hand, she was also looking forward to how far her genius would get her in the Advanced Class.\"Alright, I'll cheer you on. You can do it.\u201d\"Thanks. I'll be heading up first to see what the atmosphere is like.\"\u201cHehe, I'm actually a little nervous, so I'm thinking of collecting some information first. Anyway, let's both work hard.\"\"Yes, I'll help you, too.\u201dAmy looked up at the blue sky with a light heart.Dreams were as far away as the sun. However, dreams were also a guiding light, a beacon to those who needed something to cling to.\u2018I will definitely become the best mage.\u2019* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The integrated class for the Intermediate class was back.While upperclassmen and lowerclassmen were going around interacting, no one approached Shirone.Sometimes standing out too much was also a problem.Surprising the teachers during the entrance test, managing to showcase one of the Four Way Formations on his first try, crushing Black Magician, and becoming Amy's official lover.In a short period of time, the marks left by Shirone were considerable. Nevertheless, since he belonged to Class 7, the lowest Intermediate class, the feelings of his classmates were inevitably complicated.\"Huh? There he is, Amy! Your boyfriend, Shirone!\"Sharelle waved from afar. Shirone pushed his way through the crowd. Amy stood with her arms folded as if she were sulking.\"Hello, seniors.\"\"Hahaha! What\u2019s up with the formalities? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re strangers, and plus we're the same age anyways, so no need to be so polite. Talk casually.\u201dAmy continued sulking despite Sharelle\u2019s matchmaking temperament. From some point on, going beyond his indifference, Amy felt like Shirone was avoiding her.She wasn\u2019t trying to brag, but inside this academy, Amy Karmis was not someone who got turned down by anyone. So on the other hand, she thought a lot about how to deal with Shirone if he did approach her seriously.But what was Shirone doing? He drew a line as if they couldn\u2019t even be simple friends at all. Aside from their occasional business-like conversations, he paid her no mind.\"Haha! But even so, I would have to refuse. You guys are still my upperclassmen.\"Amy almost threw a punch at Shirone due to his impassive response. but she firmly held it in. If she got angry here, it was like acknowledging that she was unattractive.\"Just speak comfortably when we're alone. And it's funny if you speak formally even though you guys are dating.\"At Amy's trembling voice, Sharelle recognized the power of love. Amy was empty without her pride, but she still calmed herself in order to earn Shirone\u2019s favor. Normally, this would not have been possible.\"No, it\u2019s okay. I'll get going. I have class to attend.\"As Shirone returned to his previous seat, Amy was on the verge of crying out in anger and shame.\"Whatever! Do whatever you want! If you hate this so much, don't do it!\"Sharelle chased after Amy. Even from her perspective, she thought Shirone was acting quite strange lately.\"Amy, did you have a fight with Shirone?\u201d\"I don't know! I don't care anymore! He\u2019s so full of himself!\"Shirone returned to Class 7, holding back his feelings of guilt and regret. Amy was a good person. However, being close to the queen of Class 4 brought too many troubles.PR/N: Amy? A good person? Now, maybe. A good person for you? Cap. #ReinaSupremacyAs Shirone sat down, his classmates began to murmur amongst themselves.\"Yeah, yeah. He thinks he\u2019s the best. Does he want to show off that much?\"\"Dating during class? Really? He doesn\u2019t even know his ass for his elbow. Did he come to this academy depending only on that face of his?\u201dTheir jealousy was up to their eyebrows. It was much worse than Shirone had expected.The average age of Class 7 students was 15. It was only slightly younger than Shirone\u2019s age, but one year was still enough to create a huge gap. In this age group, immature happenings often occurred.The kids disliked the fact that the new freshy who just entered the academy was chosen by Amy, the top student of the Intermediate class. And with mob mentality at its fullest, even female students were now gossiping about Shirone.\"Gosh, there must be something wrong with my eyes. Isn\u2019t he actually a total player? All he does is date and not study. That\u2019s why he is still unable to cast single spell.\"Shirone decided to stay away from Amy. If not, she\u2019d be the one to receive a fatal blow in terms of image.It would be a lie if he said he wasn\u2019t offended by the numerous criticisms. Though recently, the degree of their accusations had gotten worse, so he was slowly getting irritated.But whenever that happened, he stomped those feelings down, recalling Temuran's advice, he grit his teeth and manned up. His job right now was to rise through the ranks as quickly as possible.\"From today onwards, I will reduce the amount of theory and focus on training. Practice the Four Way Formation you specialize in for an hour. And for the rest of the time, practice pattern changes.\"Under the instruction of Ethella, students began to gather to train their Four Way Formation, but Shirone couldn't mingle with them.In the early days, he inadvertently displayed his Spirit Zone and suffered a setback. The students avoided Shirone's Spirit Zone, which was transmitted through synesthesia, as if it were a bag of filth.Shirone moved to a secluded place. Since he had the largest Spirit Zone in Class 7, this was the only way for him to train comfortably.Shirone, who trained the Defense Form for an hour, practiced the remaining three formations. While they were not as good as his Defense Form, his Attack Form was quite good, while he found the Target Form quite difficult to manage.His biggest problem was with the Deviate Form. Not to mention its difficulty, he couldn't even imitate it.'It's really tricky. What in the world do I have to do to get my Spirit Zone to deviate?\u2019Shirone tried to deviate the Spirit Zone to the right, but the shape got all distorted. It was not an exaggeration to say that there were only a handful of higher-class students who were able to use the Deviate Form.\u2018Center. The key is to move the center.\u2019Shirone corrected his mistake and tried again. The center slowly moved while the shape of the Spirit Zone was fixed.He felt woozy.\u2018Is this what it feels like when the soul leaves the body?\u2019Shirone\u2019s consciousness became distant and numb. He felt disoriented. Then right before his Spirit Zone was about to deviate, it burst like a bubble.\"Phew!\"The only thoughts going through his head were that Deviate Form was too difficult for the current him. For one\u2019s mind to take off somewhere was not a natural phenomenon, so he had to approach it very carefully.\u2018Rather, should I move the center first? No, the first method is right. If the shape is not perfect, the center won't move.\u2019As Shirone struggled, Ethella came up to him personally.\"How\u2019s it going, Shirone?\u201d\"Deviate Form is difficult. It's not easy to move the center.\"\"That\u2019s normal. It's usually quite a challenge for convergent types. The Four Way Formation is a natural phenomenon\u2026 Except for the Deviate Form, which is an unnatural phenomenon. By the way, what about the other formations?\"Ethella did not have high expectations for Shirone to succeed in the Deviate Form. What she was looking forward to was Shirone\u2019s natural insight, not computational competence.\"Mmm, as for the rest\u2026 I don't think there are any issues.\"Shirone answered honestly. He was becoming proficient in the Four Way Formation to the extent that he was satisfied with his own progress.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEthella was lost in thought, fiddling with her lips.\"Then would you like to try it out in the Image Zone?\"\"Yes? But\u2026 Right now?\"\"Why? Are you feeling unwell?\"\"No, it's not that.\"Ethella blinked, puzzled. The ambitious student who couldn\u2019t contain his excitement in regards to the Image Zone had turned passive.\u2018What's going on? He doesn't look very happy. The kids seem to be keeping him in check, is that why? He\u2019s more sensitive than I thought.\u2019Ethella said while patting his shoulder.\"If you\u2019re not feeling well, you can always do it next time. I was simply curious and wanted to see because you're the only one who can change between the Four Way Formation in Class 7.\"\"No, I'll give it a go. Please assess me.\"Shirone changed his mind. Even if his classmates went around criticizing him, he would not give up the opportunity to receive Ethella's guidance for just that reason alone.Abusive remarks started to fly around the moment Shirone entered the Image Zone.\"Huh, look at him go. He must be thinking of doing it again. He just loves to stand out, doesn\u2019t he?\"\"He wants to show off to his lover. Well, it\u2019s true that that's the only thing he's good at. The dude can\u2019t even cast a single spell.\"On the other hand, upperclassmen stopped whatever they were practicing and turned to focus on him. A month had passed since the successful demonstration of the Defense Form of the Four Way Formation, so they were curious to see how much he had grown since then.\"Ms. Romie, I\u2019ll begin.\u201d\"Alright. First, let's do it one by one.\u201dShirone started off with what he was best at, the Defense Form. A strong, huge Octacontaoctagon was formed.The upperclassmen were awed.\"When speaking in regards to your Defense Form alone, it's high-class.\u201dOn the other hand, the Class 7 students glared at Shirone as if they were dealing with a public enemy. Nevertheless, the reason why they couldn't complain was because his skills were actually really great.Shirone shifted to the Attack Form of the Four Way Formation. Instead of the size of his zone being reduced, it stayed the same with the only difference being numerous, dangerous-looking thorns emerging.Next was the Target Form. The length of the cross was considerable, but its torque was too weak to use in practice. Nevertheless, Shirone was making rapid progress.Ethella smiled in satisfaction. It was safe to say that Shirone would soon probably be promoted to Class 6 considering his skills.But Shirone didn't stop there and attempted the Deviate Form. It was also important to fail so that he could get advice from Ethella while she was here.Then he hit a wall. The shape of the Spirit Zone might change, and even if the center was shifted, the Zone often exploded instead of just successfully deviating.Ethella's eyes lit up in astonishment. She didn't expect him to attempt the Deviate Form as it did not fit his convergent tendencies. But surprisingly, things were going roughly, which was to be expected.Seeing this, each of the Class 7 kids, who had no intention of even trying to aim for the Deviate Form, breathed out a sigh of relief.\"Kekeke, what the hell is he doing? How is that the Four Way Formation? He\u2019s just horsing around.\"\"They said he was a genius, but he\u2019s nothing close to one. He should be doing at least one thing well. How the hell is he going to become a mage doing things like that.\"Shirone was offended. Not a single person from Class 7 could pull off the Deviate Form. He couldn't understand their way of thinking at all, especially considering the fact that they placed standards on him that even they couldn\u2019t reach.His Spirit Zone shook when he lost his composure. The more it shook, the more the Class 7 kids continued to gossip and bring Shirone down.Amy, who was watching, frowned. So far, she was satisfied with his demonstration of changing between the different forms of the Four Way Formation, but suddenly his Zone started shaking.\"What the hell's wrong with him? What is he doing?\u201d\"Deviate Form is usually hard to control. I guess he\u2019s bothered too much by the reactions of the kids.\"\"No way. He\u2019s never that shaky. Is he really going through something these days?\"\"Oh, are you covering for him? Well, I guess he is your boyfriend.\u201dAmy shut Sharelle\u2019s mouth with her red eyes and got lost in thought. It was certainly strange. Where did the Anti-Magic-resistant durability go? How come his Spirit Zone was stumbling around like it was drunk?\u2018Is there really something going on that I don't know about?\u2019Shirone tried everything to suppress his emotions. However, anger was not easy to control because once it bloomed, it grew by consuming itself.\u2018Why do they hate me? What did I do wrong? I just want to study hard and do better. What's wrong with wanting to be a mage?\u2019His Spirit Zone began to convulse as if it was about to explode. His mind was all over the place.\"Hey, you have too many miscellaneous thoughts.\u201dShirone broke out from his thoughts. Someone from Class 5 side spoke.\"If you want to do something, just do it. You're here to learn magic.\u201dShirone finally looked back on his condition with impassiveness. When he came to his senses, he realized how foolish he was being.\u2018What was I doing?\u2019Shirone, who erased all distractions, attempted once again.\u2018It\u2019s okay to fail. The important thing is to learn from it and grow.\u2019A Zone with a 40-meter diameter slowly began to deviate from the center. As the center moved away, the diameter decreased exponentially.Would it deviate first or get extinguished first?All the Intermediate class students stared at the scene.By the time the size of the Zone was reduced to two meters in diameter, the surface of the Spirit Zone had been completely pulled off from Shirone\u2019s body.The shock that the Class 7 students were in was indescribable. Even upperclassmen in the Intermediate class found it difficult to succeed, so it was natural for them to be in a daze.The Spirit Zone began to hover around Shirone. Every moment, new information entered his mind. He felt like his head was about to explode due to the huge amount of information pouring in. When he opened his eyes, the Spirit Zone burst and disappeared.\"Hah\u2026 Hah.\"He was out of breath, even though he didn't do anything physically taxing.\"I did it. I really succeeded in the form\u2026 I made it work.\"The upper-level classes began to stir.It was an achievement that was incomparable to the success of a Defense Form. Not one person in Class 7 nor Class 6 succeeded in the form.Sharelle shook Amy's arm and made a fuss.\"Amy, Shirone did it! He really did it.\"Amy was smiling, too. Regardless of her emotions, in terms of being a colleague reaching for the same dream, he had talent worthy of her respect.\u2018His growth rate is monstrous. It\u2019s insanely fast. If a month was enough to achieve the Deviate Form, I'm sure\u2026\u2019\u2018He\u2019s a talent equal to me\u2026 Or even greater.\u2019Amy was a little upset. Perhaps Shirone trained his mind without wasting even a single day. But what about her? She had gone around the back alley, doing stupid and morally-disgusting things.\u2018Why did I\u2026 Waste my precious time doing such things?\u2019Shirone, who succeeded the Deviate Form, looked around for the person who gave him a piece of advice and turned his head toward Class 5. However, he could not figure it out through voice alone since he didn't have a chance to talk to the upperclassmen.\u2018I just wanted to say thank you\u2026\u2019Ethella was absorbed in thought as she looked at Shirone, who was being applauded by nearly everyone. Everyone was influenced by Shirone's growth. She came up with a way to give rise to the atmosphere of the class a bit more.\"Hmm, you came earlier than I expected.\"* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases! https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Recently, Shirone had one concern no one knew about. It was that he did not know how to use any magic.The knowledge needed for magic was not easy enough for lower-level class children to simply obtain. Therefore, even in school, fully-fledged magic practice was conducted starting Class 5.But in reality, that wasn\u2019t true either. The nobles were educated from birth, so even lower-leveled students knew how to use at least two types of magic. On the other hand, Shirone studied only for a year and a half with the Ogent family.Shirone\u2019s dilemma was this.\u2018If you concentrate on one subject, you may be able to use simple magic.\u2019The problem was\u2026 He felt like he would never be able to overcome students who had been taught since childhood.So the strategy he came up with was to study all the disciplines at once.As a result, the number of books he started to borrow increased, and these days, he pretty much lived in the library.The students laughed at Shirone. They thought it was foolish to study so much in the library considering he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with his classes.But Shirone did not falter. He had the Core of Knowledge, so any discipline or type of knowledge could be arranged in chronological order. In other words, this meant that the probability of forgetting the content was significantly reduced.\u2018The immediate results may be minimal, but I must keep this up for a minimum of two years\u2026 If it is possible to study for two years in this state, all the main points in each field will start to connect.\u2019This was the framework of knowledge. An entire encyclopedia in his head that he could reach out to at any time.After turning over a new lead, Shirone focused back on the book. It was well past midnight when he came to his senses. The only person left in the library was a girl from Class 6.When Shirone nodded to her as she packed her bag, she also nodded back with a shy smile.It was two in the morning when he left the library.However, even if he went to bed now, he would only be able to sleep for about 4 hours. Whenever he thought about how behind he was in comparison to the nobility, he felt that sleep was a waste of time.Whenever he had those kinds of thoughts, Shirone recalled a book he once read called \"The Great Scholars' Dialogue.\"Among them, he found the interview of a biologist named Torkcholin most impressive. He, who claimed that a person must get more than six hours of sleep, joked at the end of the interview like this.\u201cOf course, I only slept four hours during my student years.\u201dAnd the author of the book asked.\u201cThen, aren\u2019t your claims incorrect?\u201dTorkcholin\u2019s answer was:\u201cHaha! Those who are in their teens are not humans. They are superhumans. Whether they sleep or not, it would not affect them in any way.\u201dThose words uplifted Shirone who was always pressed for time.\u2018Yeah! Let\u2019s work hard. If I do my best, results will follow naturally.\u2019The lights in the Advanced class building were on. The lights from the window flickered as if someone was conducting a magic experiment until late at night. What new magic was being created there?Shirone\u2019s eyes were already on the Advanced class.* * *At the end of lunchtime, Ethella went to see Siena. They were the same age at 26, and they had already worked together for four years, but they still remained formal with each other.\"Ms. Siena, can you spare me some time?\"\"Yes, but I don't think I can talk for too long because I have a class to teach in Class 7 soon.\"It was common to easily exceed an hour while discussing things related to magic, so Siena asked for understanding in advance.\"Oh, I see. I have something to discuss with you about Shirone.\"Siena showed interest at the mention of Shirone. Unlike in her class where he laid low, she heard that in practical training led by Ethella, he stood out like a sore thumb.\"How is he these days? Looking at his practice score, it seems like he\u2019s doing quite well.\"\"He certainly is. Last time, he succeeded in performing the Deviate Form of the Four Way Formation.\"\"Oho, I see.\u201dSiena smiled with satisfaction. As an instructor in charge of Shirone, it was a pleasure to hear him being praised by other instructors.\"So I'd like to make a suggestion, Ms. Siena.\u201d\"Yes? A suggestion?\"It was quite rare for Ethella herself to give suggestions to another instructor, especially in regards to a student. So as much as that was a rare occurrence, Siena thought it to be an exceptional suggestion.* * *Chemical theories filled up the blackboard in Class 7. The students taking notes were busy trying to write everything down. They felt like the class was going really fast, especially today. As expected, Siena, who finished the class about 10 minutes early, came down from the platform.\"That's it for today. Instead, I have something to announce.\"The students were very compliant. The students were willing to eat rice seeds if it meant ending a class early.\"Early promotion has been decided. Shirone Arian, please stand up.\"Shirone was pleasantly surprised at the very sudden and very unexpected early promotion. His classmates, on the other hand, looked displeased. Early promotion was not uncommon. However, the problem was that the person getting promoted was Shirone.\"Shirone, you will be promoted to Class 5. Please make sure to check and follow your new schedule starting tomorrow. I hope the rest of you will also work harder to earn the same opportunity. That is all. Class dismissed.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It wasn't just an early promotion, it was a ticket to the 2nd-highest floor. This was an unconventional decision not only for students but for the school as well.\"Teacher, I object! How can Shirone jump two classes? He can't even use any magic.\u201dThis was the first time Siena heard of such a thing. Ethella had also never mentioned it, but maybe she didn\u2019t know either. After all, one never really used magic in the lower-level classes.\"Is that true, Shirone?\"His classmates looked back at Shirone. Their eyes seemed to be saying:\u2018Please just say you can't. Say you can't.\u2019\"Yes, there's no magic I can use yet.\"\"Hmm\u2026\"Even so, there was no problem with early promotion. Magic was taught in earnest starting from class 5, and the curriculum of the lower class focused on strengthening the Spirit Zone.Shirone had mastered the basics of the Four Way Formation, and the size and durability of his Spirit Zone were not inferior to those of the upper-leveled class. Therefore, in determining the exact class, five was quite appropriate.But it was indeed quite unusual that he still couldn\u2019t use magic. If you were a student, you were bound to try and use magic secretly. After all, the only reason one would ever come to the academy would be to learn magic.\"I, too, find it a bit questionable. However, there is no magic evaluation until Class 6. Shirone's early promotion will progress as originally planned.\"\"I can't allow this!\"Mark, the implicit leader of Class 7, jumped to his feet. He was a student with a large square jaw to match his big size.\"How can you show such favoritism? Please, provide us a reason why. You said omniscience is just as important as omnipotence! I do not and cannot understand the special treatment given to Shirone!\"\"That's right! To be honest, even if I compete with him in terms of grades and achievements right at this moment, I'm confident that I'll win! He can't even keep up with the theory class!\"\"If you promote Shirone early, I will present this situation to the student council and hold a hearing!\"The students' protest was much stronger than expected. Even though they were young, they were all children who pushed through competition from Class 10. Siena had expected them to be spurred on by this happening, but they were burning with hostility as if facing an arch-nemesis.\u2018There's something I don't know.\u2019Siena realized that the situation had turned pretty serious considering the look of the students\u2019 faces who were set on fighting as if this was a war. If their resistance was this strong, it could adversely affect the class atmosphere, opposite to how she had originally hoped it would.\"This hasn't been officially decided yet. Accurate notices will be announced after an instructor meeting. I will wrap up today's class here.\"* * *Siena, who returned to the instructor\u2019s office, placed her chin on her hand and fell deep in thought.Competition was inevitable due to the nature of this specialized academy. Also, the students were aware of this fact and voluntarily enrolled in the academy.\u2018What was it? Those strange looks in the students\u2019 eyes?\u2019It wasn't simple jealousy. Early promotion had been around for a long time, but it was the first time that there was such a strong backlash to someone receiving it.\"Excuse me, Ms. Siena.\"A female student named Maria came to see Siena.She was the oldest in Class 7, at 19 years of age. She has not been promoted for four years and has been drifting in place.She was not lacking in talent at all, but because she had a timid and fearful personality, the academy pitied her, as they knew the atmosphere in the academy was not one that welcomed someone like her.\"Yes? What's the matter, Maria?\"\"Um\u2026 I have something to tell you.\"Maria, who was hesitant for a long time, confessed everything. What kind of treatment Shirone was currently facing in class, and why the children were so angry at the announcement a while ago.As the story progressed further, Siena's frown deepened more and more. They were tormenting Shirone with a method that was too foul to be considered a simple emotional quarrel.As if they planned to do so, whenever they encountered Shirone, they would pretend to vomit, and there were many cases where they intentionally flocked around Shirone and talked among themselves.Maria ended the story in tears.\"I'm not really affected by it now now, but looking back, I was treated like that once too, at least to a degree. At that time, I didn\u2019t care about studying or anything. Honestly, I think Shirone is amazing. How can he be calm in such a situation?\"Siena grasped the full extent of the situation. One student was being ostracized by a group. Without fair competition, There was no reason for this academy to exist.\"Alright, thank you for telling me. I'll take care of it from here.\"* * *Shirone arrived at the dormitory around midnight. The bullying got worse ever since the early promotion was mentioned, so he found it better to just return early and read a book.Knock, knock.Someone knocked on the door. When he checked the time, it was already past 1 a.m.\u2018Who is it at this hour?\u2019It was a time when students were unable to go out and for employees to leave work. Could it be that the kids came all this way to bully him?He couldn't easily approach the door because anxiety left him stunned, but he heard a familiar voice from the other side of the door.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\"Shirone, are you sleeping?\u201d\"Ms. Siena?\"Shirone hurriedly opened the door. It was really Ms. Siena.\"Can I come in?\u201d\"Oh, yes. Come in.\"Was Ms. Siena on watch today? Her hair was still a bit wet as if she had recently come out from the shower.The Intermediate class dormitory was not a place for female instructors to come and go at night, as students in their early 20s also resided here. However, Siena chose this time to interview him secretly away from his classmates.Unlike the rooms of other male students, Shirone\u2019s was very tidy and organized. Guessing from Shirone's personality, she checked each book on the desk. There were textbooks as well as books on subjects that he had yet to learn.\u2018So it\u2019s true. His thought process is extraordinary.\u2019Without observing closely, one would think the books were spread open with no relation whatsoever, but if someone knowledgeable saw this, they would notice that all of them were very closely related fields.Siena could roughly assume the reason why Shirone could not use magic yet. It was not because he couldn't, but because he didn\u2019t want to start yet.\u2018He was weak in omniscience from the moment he entered the academy. He is desperately looking for ways to make up for his shortcomings. This kid doesn't want to just learn magic\u2026 He wants to become a mage.\u2019Siena supported Shirone\u2019s decision. The process of linking and finding the relationship between different fields was difficult, but it was a worthwhile one. This was because linked knowledge was never forgotten.\"Excuse me, teacher. Would you like a cup of tea?\"\"No, it's all right. I came here because I wanted to ask you something.\"As Siena sat on the bed, Shirone dragged over a desk chair. It was his first time seeing her face up so close. She looked much younger than during academy hours, perhaps because she had her hair down and was in plain clothes now. He lowered his head gently, feeling embarrassed for some reason.Siena looked at him calmly.\u2018He\u2019s quite the shy boy. Is this his usual personality?\u2019His reaction was very unfamiliar to her because in class, Shirone would stare and focus so intensely at either the board or her that it seemed like he was trying to burn a hole with just his eyes.\"Isn't academy life difficult?\u201d\"Yes, but it's fun. And I find it enjoyable to study.\"\"...Why didn't you tell me that the kids were bothering you?\"Shirone had already anticipated she\u2019d ask that. In fact, it would have been stranger not to know. Due to recent events, the kids started to bully Shirone quite openly.\"It's okay, you don't have to worry about it.\u201dSiena, who heard of the student\u2019s abusive actions from Maria, didn't believe what Shirone said.\"You can be honest about this. It's nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed by.\"\"It's really okay. It\u2019s a pity that I can\u2019t make friends, but if they find me unlikeable, I can\u2019t really do anything about it.\"\"The bullying is what\u2019s wrong.\"\"Well, how people think of me and the emotions that come with it isn\u2019t something I can just change on a whim. Of course, it was hard at first, but now I\u2019m okay. I can't help it if the kids of Class 7 don't like me. But that doesn't mean I'm hated by everyone in the world.\"Siena could understand. For some, the group they belonged to was everything to them, but to those looking up, such a group was no more than a stopover.\"I want to meet more people. And I believe there is someone out there who will listen to me more seriously.\"Shirone had an apparent attitude towards early promotion. If Ethella thought that he should be placed in Class 5 at the very least, then there was already someone who accepted Shirone without feeling inferior.\"Shirone, I certainly sense your determination. I'll make mention of this at the instructors\u2019 meeting.\"* * *\"And with this, we conclude the presentation of our discovery regarding Shirone's early promotion.\"With headmaster Alpheas and the Intermediate class instructors in attendance, Siena submitted the documents relating to the case of Class 7 bullying and sat down.The teachers who read the contents frowned. The circumstances in which Shirone was being persistently ostracized under the pretext of not being able to use magic were being revealed one after another, in detail.\"Does this even make sense?\u00a0This\u00a0is why they would bully a kid in their class? How\u2026 Disappointing.\"\"It's quite possible in the lower-level classes. There are many young children, and there are also students who have thick hair, but stay behind because they have no talent. After all, they\u2019re only kids, and kids often lack the wisdom to make the right choices.\u201d\"Then we'd better promote Shirone quickly. That child will be able to graduate in at least 4 years. Now that nearby academies are challenging the Alpheas Magic Academy, the more early graduates, the better.\"The age of graduates was also part of the data that proved the excellence of a specific academy. If an academy didn't perform well enough to help students graduate in a timely manner, their credibility, along with the students\u2019, would decrease.\u201cThere are rumors flying around that the other academies are now stepping up in order to produce early graduates\u2026\u201dIt was a standard method used to elevate a normal academy to a prestigious one. After all, once that prestige was won, outstanding talents would gather, and then the quality of the class would also improve naturally.In the face of severe checks from other academies, the solution the Alpheas Magic Academy came up with was to educate and focus on students with excellent quality in order to help them graduate earlier through the early promotion system. In that sense, the instructors had high expectations for Shirone.\"I, on the other hand, disapprove of this.\"Thadd raised his hand and voted against it. And automatically, Siena\u2019s face wrinkled. At this time, considering the fact that early promotion had become a standardized reality, she was annoyed to death at seeing Thadd, once again, picking a fight. However, Alhpeas expressed interest in the first different opinion.\"Against it? Why is that?\"\"I know that Shirone is talented, extremely talented, but the whole point of this case is focused on Shirone\u2019s inability to use magic. That's where the resistance of the children comes from. Shouldn't we be talking about that?\"Siena spoke.\"I've already mentioned this, but sure, I\u2019ll say it again. He\u2019s not in a position where he can devote himself to one discipline. Instead, he\u2019s focused on mastering all aspects of knowledge. Personally, I also think that this is the optimal way for Shirone to grow.\"\"I'm not questioning that choice, the problem is that Ms. Siena favors him too much.\"\" \u2026What did you just say?\"\"Anyway, the Class 7 children also attend the academy and they also study hard. I mean, the problem of Shirone not having enough time to acquire knowledge is not something we have control over. Most of the students who come to this academy prepare extensively beforehand because they know it\u2019s gonna be hard. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that Shirone gets a special pass in regards to the assessment because \u201che didn\u2019t have enough time\u201d. If not, why can\u2019t other students be promoted early? Even if their Spirit Zone is weaker than Shirone\u2019s, in theory, they have the upper hand.\"\"Stop pettifogging! I\u2019m not judging this case emotionally. It's a conclusion based on pure academy regulations. The main thing that is truly evaluated in the lower-leveled classes is the Spirit Zone.\"\"The problem is the students' opposition. This incident may motivate them less. Are we instructors supposed to just bet everything on one genius, forgoing the other\u00a0less\u00a0genius students?\"\"Well, it\u2019s also not our job to just neglect those who are talented because of the misguided jealousy of other students!\"The two stood up, slamming their hands on the table at the same time. This was a common sight to see every time there was a meeting held.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nevertheless, the reason they remained silent was because the rank of the two that were arguing was higher.Siena and Thadd were both active as certified Grade 6 mages while only being in their mid-20s. Not to mention Ethella, who was also the pride of the Alpheas Magic Academy.The argument showed no sign of abating. Ethella tried to intervene, but no side yielded.Alpheas was just smiling. If you didn\u2019t have a passion to teach, it was impossible to fight like that.Thadd wanted the development of his alma mater, while Siena wanted the growth of her students. If one was an instructor, they would have to side with Siena, but it wasn't that they couldn\u2019t understand Thadd\u2019s side as well.\"I\u2019ve heard both of your opinions well. I understand your positions, so let's stop and take a seat.\"As soon as Alpheas' words fell from his mouth, Siena and Thadd listened and stopped arguing like two obedient puppies. The only thing they had in common would be their respect for Alpheas.\"I find both sides' arguments and points to be valid. Ms. Siena\u2019s words are logical, but we're also instructors. Shouldn't we avoid prejudice and favoritism?\u201d\"That's exactly what I'm saying, headmaster.\"Thadd laughed and Sina was expressionless\u2026 But Alpheas wasn\u2019t done. After carefully devising something, he revealed his idea with a big smile.\"That is why we should\u2026 How about it?\"* * *A single official notice was pinned on the bulletin board of the Intermediate class building.Dozens of students gathered in front of the bulletin board and were shocked at the contents of the official notice.This was the first time in the history of the Alpheas Magic Academy that a promotion was open to a whole class. In this case, Class 7.The main gist of the notice was this.We are providing an early promotion opportunity for all of Class 7. We will only pick one person who is eligible for promotion and the moment they pass the exam, they will be promoted to Class 5. As we fully acknowledge the students\u2019 concerns, this evaluation will be graded in terms of magic and not Spirit Zone.The subject of evaluation is teleportation.\"T-Teleportation? I don't know how to do it. Can you do it?\"\"No, of course I can't. It's an official Class 5 designated magic.\u201d\"I've done it once. But it was so scary that I don\u2019t dare to try again.\u201d\"You stupid! It's easy if you follow the original formula. The problem is that it\u2019s just so difficult to apply.\"The noisy children suddenly died down. Shirone was walking their way. Arriving at the bulletin board whilst under many different stares, he read the official notice. This was the conclusion reached by the instructors.\u2018Teleportation.\u2019Shirone engraved the word and concept in his mind.* * *The so-called Class 7 bullying incident interested the upperclassmen. In particular, because the target was Shirone, there was a lot of talk due to that fact.\"Oh my God! Something like that happened? Amy, did you know?\u201dAmy, who only checked the bulletin board at the end of the day, read the official notice and frowned. When Sharelle informed her of the specifics of the rumors, her knuckles turned white.\u2018You were being bullied? Is it because of me too?\u2019According to Sharelle, some of her classmates don\u2019t even make eye contact when looking at Shirone. Moreover, there were some who even antagonized Amy during integrated classes.\"What do you think? I mean, they are kids from Class 7. Actually, I went through something similar, but since I was promoted quickly, nothing happened.\"\u201c Bullying and Isolation are not things that can be excused just because one is young. If we start thinking that it\u2019s okay, then shouldn\u2019t we be doing the same things? After all, we\u2019re also young.\"We're in Class 4. Magic requires maturity and a lot of mental and emotional control, so age\u00a0can\u2019t\u00a0matter.Amy didn't want to argue about this or that. In fact, she couldn't think of anything because her mind was a mess. Amy was just angry that Shirone was being tormented and was suffering.\"Stupid! Why didn't he tell me?\u201d\u2018If he had been honest and discussed it with me, we could have come up with a better solution!\u2019She was certain they would have. Popularity aside, she was still at the top of Class 4. And Shirone was \u2018dating\u2019 her. Thinking about the possible things Shirone had to go through angered Amy. She was angry in fact that one could mistake her for the victim.\"I need to go see Shirone.\u201d\"That\u2019s no problem, but what are you going to do?\"\"Well first, I\u2019m going to hit him once. Then I\u2019ll get all of Class 7 to assemble. I should be able to do at least that since we\u2019re in a relationship.\u201d\"What? Are you crazy?!\"\"What do you mean? So you want me to sit still and do nothing? This happened because of me.\"\"Gosh, you really don't know men. Do you know why he didn't tell you? It's because it would hurt his pride. What do you think will happen if you go and assemble all of Class 7 hmm?\u201dAmy couldn't understand. The only reason he didn\u2019t even make eye contact with her was because he was scared of Class 7 children?It was Amy whose pride was hurt by this incident.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\"Men, you know, like to be recognized. Men live for pride and die for pride. But since he\u2019s getting bullied, do you think he\u2019d tell that to the girl he likes?\u201dThere was some truth in what Sharelle was saying, but that was only in the case of those who were in a really loving relationship. How could she know that Shirone and Amy were in a fake relationship?\u2018He must be thinking that he stepped on poop because of me. That's why he\u2019s avoiding me.\u2019Sharelle viewed the school's initiative positively.\"But isn't that a relief? If he passes the promotion exam, he will enter Class 5. They did really well in choosing teleportation as the subject of evaluation. All of the Class 7 students will need to learn from scratch.\u201dAmy's thoughts were different. There was a difference between having a broad understanding of the magic type and understanding the specific spell.And what\u2019s more. It was teleportation magic.When learning teleportation, the most important thing was to overcome fear. It was on a whole other level compared to flight magic in terms of speed and the perception of things during transit. Just knowing of the fact that you could teleport into something and lose your life was deterrent enough for many.\"Come to think of it, isn't this a very dangerous test? What are the teachers thinking?\"\"I\u2019m sure they will adjust the difficulty level appropriately. They could also just be testing the students' passion and bravery. More than half of Class 7 will probably take the test.\u201d\"What? That much even though they\u2019ve never been taught teleportation?\u201d\"The passing reward is being raised up to Class 5. And it's all about learning from scratch. If I were in their position, I would totally go for it.\u201dAmy couldn't get rid of the uncomfortable feeling. Perhaps the students who took the test would practice intensively with help from their seniors or a dedicated teacher. It was clear that the students who were planning to take the exam would practice intensively with the help of their upperclassmen or with their exclusive instructor.Shirone, on the other hand, was not so lucky. Having an exclusive teacher was definitely out of the picture, and he did not even have any friends to ask for advice.\u2018At this point, what if he doesn\u2019t succeed?\u2019Although Shirone\u2019s talent was acknowledged, in the short run, the exam could never guarantee his passing.\"Right! Amy, why don't you help? Take this opportunity to make up with him.\"\"Hmph! He didn\u2019t even say a word about being bullied, you think he\u2019ll accept my help? I\u2019m just going to keep pretending like I know nothing.\"\"Ugh, you guys are really something. If you like each other, just like each other. What\u2019s the problem with you two?\u201d\"Mind your own business, this is our way of dating. It\u2019s not like I'm free anyway. The Advanced class promotion exam is just around the corner.\"\"Oh, right! I forgot about that. Sorry.\"Nothing was more important to a student than promotion. No matter how smart Amy was, she couldn't afford to lose focus if she wanted to overcome the high barrier of being promoted to the Advanced class.\"He\u2019ll be fine on his own. If he can\u2019t do even that, he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be called my lover.\"Turning away from the bulletin board, Amy continued to speak inwardly.\u2018Even if he\u2019s a fake one.\u2019* * *Around midnight.A masked figure infiltrated the garden of the men's dormitory. As they moved forward, no sound could be heard, not even the rustling of grass. When they checked that the light on the 7th floor of the building was on, they scratched their head in annoyance.\u2018I am NOT doing this because it bothers me. I'm only helping because I feel a sense of responsibility!\u2019Amy ground her teeth. Even though she tried to forget and move on, she couldn't concentrate on her studying because she was worried about Shirone.\"Y\u2019all better watch your backs! I'll make you all kneel and beg for forgiveness once Shirone passes!\"Amy climbed the wall to the 7th floor. If rumors spread that she had crossed the threshold of the men's dormitory at night, she would not be able to carry her head high anymore. But at the same time, her old playfulness went nowhere.\u2018Hoho, since this is already happening, may as well surprise him enough to make his heart jump out of his ribcage.\u2019Amy did a forward roll as soon as she opened the window. The calculations were made upon her landing. She was going to subdue Shirone and throw him on the bed. Then twist his arm to the point that it would make him scream.\"Huh?\"But Amy couldn't even take one step. Shirone stared at her with eyes that screamed surprise. And next to him was Ms. Siena, who was sitting on a chair.\"T-Teacher?\u201d\"Are you\u2026 Amy?\u201dSiena adjusted her glasses and looked again. It was clear that the trespasser was Amy as she was the only student with red hair and thick, double-eyelid eyes.She knew Amy was dating Shirone, but she thought that they were both focusing on their own goals. However, after she thought about it once more, and considering the current situation, she couldn't help but feel that what they were doing was absurd and deceitful.\"Do you guys meet like this all the time? Pretending you don't know each other during the day whilst secretly enjoying meetings at night?\u201d\"I-It\u2019s a misunderstanding! That is a huge misunderstanding!\"Siena hurriedly placed a finger over her mouth.\"Shh! The room over will hear.\"Amy covered her mouth and looked at the room next door. This was the men\u2019s dormitory. If rumors spread that a woman's voice was heard in Shirone's room, the first suspect would unconditionally be herself. Well, even if that happened, she had nothing to say.\"No, wait! Forget about me for a second, what brings you here? At this hour?\"Come to think of it, it was Ms. Siena who didn't fit in this situation the most. This was because there was no reason for a teacher to come in plain clothes at night.\"Please, do say. Why are you here at this hour?\u201dAmy's reasonable misunderstanding flushed Siena's cheeks. However, she quickly returned to her original state and spoke coldly.\"I'm here to give Shirone some advice about the promotion exam. I didn\u2019t think it would be good to stand out by showing everyone that I\u2019m helping him, so this is how I do it.\"If the promotion test was the reason, then Amy had nothing to say. It was because she went for that same exact reason herself.\"Um\u2026 Excuse me, senior.\"Shirone, who prepared tea, held out a cup to Amy and spoke.\"First, here\u2019s a cup of tea\u2026\u201d\"Hmm\u2026\"Amy took the cup and savored the aroma. As a polite lowerclassman, he had the basic posture of welcoming a guest.\"...As if! This all happened because of you!\"\"S-Sorry!\"As Shirone apologized, Amy was even more annoyed. Because of that nice temperament of his, he was currently being pushed around by those lowlives.\"Sit down for now. I want to finish what we were talking about.\u201dSiena offered a seat. Amy sat next to Shirone and quickly turned her body away from him. Because although she did come because she was worried, she was still angry with him.\"As you guys know, the evaluation will be on teleportation. The headmaster made the decision himself.\"\"The headmaster?\"Amy finally understood the situation. She thought it was a test that was not suitable for Class 7, but since it was the playful headmaster who decided it, that explained it all to her.\"Yes. To be honest, I don't understand his intentions either. Teleportation is a dangerous magic.\u201dAmy asked.\"The test will probably be done at 'The Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed', right?\u201d\"I\u2019m not quite sure, but that\u2019s the only place I can think of.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Infinite MageCH 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed was a bridge that connected two mountain peaks that were both about a thousand meters above sea level, the highest amongst the training grounds. The bridge was 700 meters long, and a torrent flowed down the valley.\"How come it's a bridge that cannot be crossed?\u201dAmy explained why.\"It's literally a bridge you can\u2019t cross. It's a training ground for teleportation practice. The level of difficulty ranges from 1 to 10, and I, despite being a Class 4, have to risk my life from level 8 or higher.\"Siena added.\"The promotion exam was adjusted to a difficulty level of 1. Currently, there are no obstacles. Since it's impossible for Class 7 children to even jump* 700 meters.\"PR/N: Another way of talking about teleportation in this context.Amy questioned.\"Huh? Then how are things going to work? Isn't the first person to arrive the one that gets promoted then?\"\"The student who leaps the furthest will be selected. It won't be too dangerous. There will be safety devices as well as teachers from the Advanced class overseeing things. The problem is the students. There are many cases where they collide with each other if their competitiveness gets a bit excessive.\"In Amy\u2019s opinion, that was the difficult part of the exam. But since it was a test for early promotion for those in Class 7, such a thing would probably not happen. But nevertheless, it was still Shirone who was most disadvantaged.\"How about this method? From the beginning, Shirone will go all out before anyone else does. Of course, it will take a lot of mental energy, but I'm sure Shirone can do it.\u201d\"I was thinking the same. That's why I'm going to be training Shirone from today onwards.\"\"What? Really? You will?\"Amy opened her eyes wide in bewilderment. A teacher of Ms. Siena\u2019s caliber being in charge of a particular student was frankly unfair to the other students. Knowing this, Amy was worried that if someone found out that Ms. Siena was teaching Shirone privately, strange rumors would appear.\"How come Ms. Siena is going so far to help Shirone?\"\"This incident is something I\u2019m responsible for. My original intention was to list Shirone under Class 5 from the start, but my proposal was rejected due to opposition from other teachers. If things had gone the way I planned, Shirone wouldn\u2019t have been bullied in the first place.\u201d\"But if some kind of a rumor spreads, the problem will grow. I\u2019m sure other students will also learn and study teleportation with help from others, but Shirone\u2019s a special case. If word gets out that a teacher is in charge of handling Shirone, the students could complain that the test was rigged from the start. And this test is too good of an opportunity to risk that. Let\u2019s not do that, I'll be in charge of Shirone for the time being. I can teach him everything he needs to know if the level of difficulty is only 1.\"Siena shook her head.\"If I remember correctly, you recently applied for the Advanced Class promotion. Wouldn't it be better for you to focus on that? You don\u2019t have the time to worry about Shirone.\u201d\"Huh? Really?\"Shirone asked, seemingly unable to believe it. Nobody applied for the promotion this early in the school year. And the fact that Amy would be the very first one to apply meant that she was going to have to tackle things blindly.'I see. That's amazing.\u2019Shirone was grateful that she came to see him despite the fact she was most definitely busy preparing for the exam. However, the situation was now heading in a different direction from the nice, heartwarming atmosphere Shirone was expecting. The two women, whose prides were lit on fire, did not back down even a single step.\"No matter how busy I am, I can make time to help him with something as simple as teleportation, so I think you should be the one to back off on this one, teacher. Rather, such meddling could have a negative effect on Shirone.\"\"As a teacher who knows that this is a very important period for a student such as yourself, I can\u2019t just let things be. You can only apply for the Advanced Class exam once a year. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019d be better to leave things to the teacher and focus on the exam?Both had smiles on their faces, but contrary to their lips, their eyes remained serious and their wills unbending. Realizing that they would not reach a consensus, they looked towards Shirone one last time.\"Shirone, you choose. Is it me or teacher? Of course, it would be better for your girlfriend to teach you.\"\"Yes, Shirone. You should decide. Wouldn\u2019t I be the better choice instead of a student who is about to take thier Advanced Class exam?\"Despite their friendly voices, Shirone felt a sort of veiled threat underneath the facade. However, Shirone was not swayed by their argument and confessed what he had originally thought of.\"I'll just do things myself. Thank you, but I don't need any help.\u201dThe women were speechless.\"Getting help from a teacher is against equality. But I also don't want to get help from an upperclassman who is about to take an important exam. I'll try my best to pass this exam on my own.\"\"You idiot! The other kids will, at the very least, take private lessons to pass! And everyone is keeping an eye on you! Keeping you in check! I\u2019m telling you, you are not at the level to try and do things on your own!\"\"I don\u2019t care.\"\"Huh?\"\"I honestly admire the fact that you plan to take the Advanced Class exam blind. Frankly, I think it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s as if you\u2019re making a statement to those below you. That if you can\u2019t do it, then no one else will be able to do it either.\u201d\"Yes? That's\u2026 That's true, but\u2026\u201d\"It's the same for me. I will do my best and pass. As your boyfriend, I will not bring shame to you.\"Realizing how strong Shirone's determination was, Amy could no longer object. But above all, she was grateful to him for acknowledging and respecting her decision.* * ** * *\"Humph. O-Of course you should.\"No one was chosen by Shirone, but looking at the atmosphere, it was Amy\u2019s victory this time.Siena stood up, adjusting her glasses.\u201cIf that's what the student wants, then this teacher will accept. But whenever you\u2019re stuck on something, don\u2019t be afraid to ask. All my students get to do that, so there is no fairness argument that can be found there.\"\"I will, thank you for your concern.\"As Siena walked towards the door to leave, she said something to Amy.\"I have no choice but to let it slide this one time, but from now on, refrain from entering the male\u2019s dormitory. If you get caught next time, you may get punished.\"Amy lowered her head, grateful for Ms. Siena. Even in her opinion, she could only say that she was very lucky today.When Siena left, an awkward silence came upon them.Shirone, despite the calm facade he put forward, could not say one word as this was the first time he was in a room alone with a woman of his age.Amy was also swept away by the strange atmosphere. She came all this way with the intention of teaching him a lesson, but now she found herself fidgeting in front of Shirone.\"W-Well, then... I'll get going, too.\"\"Oh, yes! Thank you, you know, for worrying about me.\"Amy sighed with relief and prepared to head back. Then, as if something suddenly came to mind, she looked back at Shirone and shouted.\"You idiot! Why didn't you tell me? If that kind of thing happened, you should have discussed it with me.\"\"I'm sorry, but I didn't want to tell you.\"\"Because of pride? That\u2019s stupid.\u201d\"Rather than that... It\u2019s because I didn\u2019t want to break up with you.\"Amy's cheeks heated up.\"If I did tell the truth, it would\u2019ve only made things more awkward between us. But I want to continue to have a good relationship with you. Because reaching you is my goal.\"Shirone remembered his first day at the magic academy. From the moment he saw the name Amy Karmis at the top of the Class 4 list, he swore to himself that he would catch up to her.\"I will definitely catch up to you. So please do your best, too.\"Despite being in a good mood, Amy was burdened. In fact, she had similar feelings due to the incident with Black Magician.\"Then don't just call me \u2018upperclassman\u2019 from now on.\"\"What?\"\"We're the same age anyway, and I acknowledge you, so don't call me upperclassman from now on.\"\"But\u2026\u201d\"I\u2019m saying that I feel bad! What the hell is that? Acting like you follow and obey me while calling me \u2018senior\u2019 or \u2018upperclassman\u2019, but in reality, you\u2019re actually coming after me? Stop being so coy and stand next to me and challenge me proudly!\"The specific Class in the magic academy was also a matter of social status. When she said not to treat her as a senior, it meant that she thought of Shirone as an equal.\"Instead, hurry and catch up! If you blabber with only your mouth and continue to stay down there pathetically, I will dump you, okay?\u201dAmy walked towards the window with a face flushed red. Since she couldn\u2019t leave through the door, she had to go out the unorthodox way.\"Amy.\"Amy jumped and looked back when Shirone called. Embarrassed, she thought she looked back too quickly when Shirone called out.But Shirone's eyes were burning brightly, almost to the point it was scary. As soon as she met his eyes, her stupid feelings disappeared in an instant.\"I will definitely catch up. Please wait for me in the Advanced class.\u201dAmy's eyes bent like a seagull. Her smile was hidden behind her mask, but she was clearly smiling.\"Hmph. I'll have already graduated by then. Feel free to chase after me. If you can, that is.\"Amy jumped out the window. By the time Shirone looked out the window, she had already disappeared.He sighed. Shirone pretended to be strong, but it was true that he had no idea where to start.\"Teleportation\u2026\u201d* * *There was a month left until the promotion exam. He had to somehow learn teleportation in that time frame. First, he went to the library and raked up all the books about teleportation magic. Contrary to his expectations that there would be none in stock, it was actually not difficult to get them.\u2018Rumor has it that about 20 students are going to take the promotion test. In the end, all of them study in their own special way without relying on books.\u2019\"My, my\u2026 I might actually fail this time around.\"Shirone calmed his anxious mind and steadily learned the basic concept of teleportation.One of the greatest discoveries in the history of magic: the theory of photonization. It was a type of magic that turned the mage\u2019s body into light.The thing of importance was the property of light, which was too difficult to understand with the human head.Light had no relative velocity, did not even contain mass, and even had the properties of particles and waves at the same time. But Kergos obtained great insight from its abstruse nature. By using the absoluteness of light that had no relative velocity, it was possible to quickly jump through space.By adopting the photonization theory as omniscience, anyone could successfully teleport. That was why it was such a great discovery.However, the problem of control arose. Since teleportation was instant, calculating using the brain could easily lead to death.\u2018Understandable. Since we can\u2019t calculate the speed of 10 to the power of 20.\u2019Shirone continued to read books. It was said that mages divided the speed of light into four main categories: ultra, super, sub, and semi.Ultra-light speed was faster than light, and in theory, time-slip magic was possible. But so far, it was an unknown area that no mage had reached.Therefore, the most outstanding mages of light among humans were those who used super-light speed. They could learn Stop magic, which was labeled as something under the realm of gods. However, there were only a handful of mages who reached that level throughout history.In the end, most of the professional mages who deal with light had their skills divided and categorized in the realm of sub-light speed.According to the definition of the mages, sub-light speed was \u2018a speed that transcends the maximum speed of matter, but was much slower than that of light.\u2019The sub-light speed was also the basic omnipotence of space movement. In super-light speed, it would take no time to travel, but with sub-light speed, it took seconds.Shirone read the book in amazement, but all the information had yet to reach reality for him. What he had to worry about was the last speed of light, the semi-light speed.The definition of the semi-light speed given by the mages was that it was \u2018a speed that transcends the maximum speed of any living organism, but was much slower than sub-light speed.\u2019Therefore, even if teleportation had the property of light, it was possible to capture the path with the human eye.Since it was not at a speed that could distort space, an irreversible mishap may occur if you mistake your surrounding environment.\u2018The moment I miss even one detail, it's over. Even if the photonization theory reduces our mass, hitting something would still be fatal due to the speed.\u2019He realized why Siena emphasized that there would be no obstacles on The Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed. Teleporting itself was dangerous. However, she had said that there were no specific countermeasures for clashes between students.\u2018Can I really do it? With just the basic formula?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Infinite MageCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMoving from point A to point B took no more than 1 second. It was quite difficult to calculate variables in your head since you were limited to that 1-second time frame. And above all, due to the nature of teleportation, short distances had to be repeated several times, meaning multiple calculations.\u201cAh, I get it now.\u201dShirone slapped his forehead. You couldn\u2019t calculate with your head, but you could still feel with your intuition.Just as the number of leaves in a tree could be counted through the Spirit Zone, the speed of light was also perceivable through insight.This was exactly what Alpheas wanted. A magic that anyone could utilize, but not everyone could master.Shirone gained confidence. Although he lagged behind in terms of omniscience, he had been honing and polishing his omnipotence every day since he was 12 years old.* * *30 days left until the exam.Shirone did his best to expand his knowledge of Kergos' theory on photonization. After class, he spent night and day digging through the books in his dormitory. After 20 days of doing so, he could no longer find a book that could offer him anything new.So from that day onwards, he started visiting a training ground dedicated to Class 7. The training ground was empty, presumably because his classmates had better, more private training areas.Shirone combined the omniscience of the photonization theory with the omnipotence of the Spirit Zone. He found it difficult to grasp the feeling because this was his first attempt.Shirone stood between omniscience and omnipotence. In that state, as soon as Shirone erased himself, the omniscience and omnipotence grew an affinity with each other. They then attached themselves as the magic activated.Shirone cast the magic while in a state of trance. As he felt his body disintegrate, a light flashed before his eyes. At the same time, he bobbed his head to move forward, the distorted world crashing down on him.\u201cAHHHHH!\u201dShirone, after traveling 5 meters, rolled on the floor. He felt like all the bones in his body were breaking.\u201cUghh\u2026\u201dAs he grit his teeth and endured the pain, the word \u2018failure\u2019 got engraved in his mind. If the mass was not completely reduced by the photonization, the impact force from the speed would follow. Hard.It was a magic too dangerous to try alone.However, Shirone, who had no upperclassmen to ask for advice, let alone a private teacher, had no choice but to learn by tackling it with his body. And while yes Amy and Ms. Siena offered to help, he could not accept either. He chose not to out of principle.\u2018I won't give up. I\u2019ll definitely succeed.\u2019From that day onwards, Shirone went through numerous trials and errors to correct anything he was doing wrong. An ignorant method at first glance, but in the end, only muscle memory would remain when facing the actual test.A few days later, a mysterious person suddenly appeared on the training grounds and started watching Shirone. They could have been a spy sent by someone, but Shirone didn\u2019t care. There was no other suitable place to train.How many times did he roll on the floor and bust his lips on the ground? He had bruises all over his body while his muscles did not forget to ache each time he woke up in the morning.* * *The day before the exam.With ten minutes to go before midnight, Shirone stumbled back to his position.\u201cNever give up\u2026 Never give up\u2026\u201dHis throat was dry and sore from inhaling all the dust. He stood in the center of the training ground with half-open eyes.He had corrected most of his mistakes by this point. All he had to learn now was perseverance in front of pain and gain the will to overcome fear.Shirone couldn't move. He was too afraid to teleport. His stamina had fallen to the point that it could no longer get any lower, while his bones and muscles were bruised so bruised that just a light brush of anything left them throbbing in pain.\u201cLet's do it\u2026 I have to do it\u2026\u201dShirone muttered these words as his consciousness began to fade. He was mentally knocked out. But maybe that was a good thing as he did not have to put in any effort to erase himself.\u201cTe\u2026Teleportation.\u201dShirone\u2019s body stretched 10 meters out. His speed was not comparable to light, but to the naked eye, it seemed as if he was.After arriving at point B, Shirone hurriedly straightened his upper body as it was about to drop forward.\u201c......\u201dHe just stood there for a long time. He didn\u2019t feel it. This time around, he didn't feel any pain.\"Hehe\u2026 I did it.\"Then the midnight bell rang loud.Hearing the reverent sound, Shirone dropped to the ground from his standing position. The smell of dirt irritated the tip of his nose.The result of the 30 days of training was only 10 meters. But still, this was the first time he had successfully leaped 10 meters.\u2018How much farther can I go with this?\u2019To cross the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed, he had to cast a minimum of 70 teleportation magics as the bridge was 700 meters in length. Furthermore, since this was a race, he had to pay careful attention to his stamina as well.Casting a single teleportation magic was much more costly than casting a single attack magic.This was because it was simply better to just run fast rather than use teleportation that only moved you 10 meters forward. It was more efficient.Ultimately, the key was connectivity.If you could not cast it consecutively, teleportation was a magic one was better off not using.If one arrived at their destination in a fully photonized state, the inertia would disappear. And thanks to this, the mage\u2019s body would not shatter and be destroyed due to the inertia.\u2018I don't have time for this. I shouldn't be lying down. I have to practice a little more. At the very least, I should be reinforcing the connecting part\u2026\u2019Shirone\u2019s determination remained the same, but sadly he couldn't lift a finger. His consciousness was tugged into an abyss, and Shirone\u2019s eyelids closed gently.And just like that, the morning dawned.* * ** * *Mark opened the window and enjoyed the fresh morning breeze. He stretched and went into the bathroom to wash his face. The smile on his face did not fade while he got changed.Today was going to be a historic day in his life.\u2018Promoting from Class 7 at full speed. Haha. I\u2019m already looking forward to the kind of treatment Class 5 will give me.\u2019Mark was incredibly strong at the young age of 15. In the magic world, physical appearance was not very important, but young children were still intimidated by height. And in addition to that, he was gifted with magic talent, so there was no brave soul who dared to bother him in Class 7. Thanks to that, he gained this opportunity by driving Shirone into a corner, so knowing that he made this opportunity fall into his hands, it strengthened his pride.\u201cHow do you feel, young master?\u201dA slender man opened the door and greeted Mark. It was the mage who taught Mark teleportation for a month. Although Mark was pressed for time to hire someone quickly, he managed to find someone who was a certified Grade 9 mage.\u201cAll right. How about Shirone?\u201d\u201cStill the same. Even if teleportation is easy to learn, there is a limit to training alone. Even if he takes the promotion exam, he won\u2019t even be able to come close to the young master.\u201d\u201cHmm. But I shouldn\u2019t let my guard down. His Spirit Zone is bigger than mine.\u201dMark was satisfied with what he had just said. It was often said that the weakness of genius was laziness. But Mark thought himself different. In his head, with his natural talent and hard-working character, there was no way he could lose against Shirone.\u201cBy the way, how many kids are participating in the operation?\u201d\u201cAs of yesterday, four.\u201d\u201cThat's quite small. After all, receiving private tutoring from a certified mage is rare.\u201d\u201cThey either do not know their limits or are simply ignorant. Or maybe too prideful.\u201dMark snorted at the thought of the students who refused to participate in the operation. Those losers who had not a speck of talent were blinded by the opportunity for early promotion and kicked off the lucky chance with their feet.\u2018Well, whatever floats their boats. Let them do whatever they want. I'm the one who will get promoted anyway. It\u2019s Mark Slider\u2019s victory.\u2019The House of Slider was not very high up in the social class. However, despite being 3rd-class nobles, most of the family members worked for the Magic Association, so in the magic society, they had a pretty significant influence.In any competition, if there was an upper rank, there of course would also be a lower rank. Mark decided to draw in half-baked kids with poor grades to form an operational group. When he offered to help them get a job at the association after graduation, several chose to come over. They concluded that it was more realistic to make a deal than to pass through the eye of a needle.\u201cFour people are enough. We can just crush him from the beginning.\u201d\u201cHow about teleportation\u201dMark opened the door and gave a thumbs-up as he walked out.\u201cPerfect. I will cross over 700 meters with my eyes closed.\u201d\u201cI wish you all the best, Young Master.\u201dThe certified Grade 9 mage was courteous to Mark \u2018til the end. From his perspective, he was a distant lowerclassman, but Mark was the son of his employer, who was a technical advisor at the Magic Association.Mark headed to the Intermediate class building. There was no class because it was the day of the promotion exam, but students who were not participating in the exam remained and were studying on their own. Mark also visited this place for a meeting with the operation team.As expected, the expressions of the students self-studying on their own were not good. It was because of the sense of shame they had for knowing they did not have a chance in the exam.Mark enjoyed a sense of superiority whenever he looked at their faces. He burst out laughing when he thought that the kids who were left in the classroom today would probably be polishing shoes after going out to society.\u201cYo, Maria! Are you giving up on the exam?\u201dMark raised his hand at Maria, who was approaching from afar. Then Maria's face turned pale. She had become an outcast ever since she filed a complaint to Siena about Shirone's bullying.Mark looked abhorrently at the helpless Maria.\u2018Tsk. This bat-like girl. She goes out and snitches on us, forgetting the times we used to bully together? So old and so useless. Why the hell is this thing even attending the academy?\u2019Frightened Maria spoke first.\u201cMark, you didn't go to the training ground? Are you going to self-study like us?\u201d\u201cHaha! You seriously think that? I'm not you. I just came here to meet my friends because I have some time to kill.\u201dMaria, who was being condescended by Mark who was four years younger, turned gloomy. However, she couldn't even blame anyone because she was the one who lacked the talent and skills.\u201cForget me, what are you doing here? What difference can you make by studying today? That's why your grades look like that. Come up to the training ground and take a look. Watch us. Observe. Observing those who are talented is also another form of studying, you know.\u201d\u201cYes, I guess so\u2026\u201dMaria gave an awkward smile while listening to Mark. She just wanted to end the conversation quickly and leave.\"W-Well, then, good luck. I really hope you pass.\u201d\u201cKekeke! Do you really think so?\u201dMaria\u2019s heart sank at Mark\u2019s sneering.\u201cI\u2019ve only tolerated you for so long because you were in the same class as me. But if I become an upperclassman, you better be prepared. I won't forget the time you snitched on us.\u201dMaria urgently tried to make an excuse, but her mind went blank and she couldn't think of anything. In the end, she resigned and ended up bowing her head as she walked off.Mark snorted while watching her walk away. He entered the classroom where the operation team gathered. Four classmates were waiting in the empty classroom.Three men and one woman. They were students who had been training for a month to interfere with Shirone's path. In particular, the place they focused on was the situation that would happen within 100 meters.Shirone for sure knew he was being kept in check, so he was definitely going to go all out in the beginning. Eliminating him by using any method possible before that happens was the key.They had to be careful since a deliberate collision could lead to them being disciplined, but from Mark's point of view, it didn't matter if they crashed into him. He thought so because he felt that their sacrifice was equal to the compensation he was going to give them.\u201cSo how is it? You guys must have set up a plan, right?\u201d\u201cYes. As soon as the exam starts, the two of us will cling to Shirone. In the meantime, the other two will cover you. If Shirone breaks free from us, we\u2019ll at least have another two waiting.\u201dThe number of opportunities they had to fail Shirone was at most two times. However, considering his victory was going to be determined within the first 100 meters in the exam, Mark was pretty satisfied with the plan.Shirone\u2019s leaping distance was probably a standard of 10 meters. If so, the operation team needed to bring him down within the first 10 times they cast teleportation magic.\u201cI won\u2019t forget your help today. I will lead you guys if I get an early promotion.\u201d\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll be trusting you.\u201dMark was satisfied. Everything was going according to plan. He was going to be the winner.\u201cGreat! Shall we get started?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Infinite MageCH 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTeleportation training grounds.One after another, students arrived at the peak that was 1,000 meters above sea level. Since there were no classes, students from other classes were also there.After today, a student from Class 7 was going to be promoted to Class 5.Considering that it usually took an average of two years to pass one class, in the worst-case scenario, it was possible for a student who was 4 years younger than the average to be attending a class meant for older students.\u201cWow! So this is the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed! It's my first time up here.\u201dThe participating students were amazed by the enormous size of the training ground. Instructors and students were also gathered on the opposite peak, 700 meters away.\u201cBut why is it called the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed? Where even is the bridge?\u201d\u201cIdiot. It\u2019s over there.\u201dA long iron bar connected the two peaks. As the length increased, the tension dropped. The fact that the bar stretched out 700 meters indicated that it was an alchemical material.A few students walked to the cliff and looked down. Contrary to what the instructors had told them, there were no safety devices, let alone anything that looked similar to it.\u201cWhat the hell? Won't you die if you fall?\u201dThadd, who leaped over the peak with Spatial Warp, spoke to them.\u201cYou don't have to worry. There are safety devices.\u201dThe students were not reassured. In fact, they heard that in another academy, a student had actually died during teleportation practice.\u201cHow does it activate?\u201d\u201cIf you fall 100 meters, the Air Net Magic gets automatically activated. It was designed to be invisible so you guys push yourselves not to fall.\u201d\u201cWhat if it malfunctions?\u201d\u201cHahaha! I can't say that it\u2019s impossible. But so far, nothing like that has happened before.\u201d\u201cSo there's no guarantee that we\u2019ll be absolutely safe?\u201d\u201cWell, so to speak, yes.\u201dThe students paled. Then Thadd turned around with a smug look. Even if the safety device broke, there would be no accident. That\u2019s why all the classes were canceled and why all the instructors were told to gather here.However, even if an accident were to occur, there was not much anyone could do. The magic academy was a special-purpose academy supported by the kingdom, so it was part of the rule not to blame anyone for an accident, even if someone was injured or killed during class. Students were already aware of this fact before applying for the Intermediate class.\u201cIt's been a long time since I've been here. Amy, let's go that way.\u201dSharelle grabbed Amy's hand and dragged her up the hill. Amy looked like she didn\u2019t want to go, but she eventually followed as Sharelle led her.\u201cI said I don't want to see it. It\u2019s a Class 7 exam! The results are obvious.\u201d\u201cOh, look at this girl! What are you saying when your boyfriend is about to proudly go up to Class 5? How will you ever score some points with your boyfriend if you don\u2019t do it on a day like this?\u201d\u201cTsk! What\u2019s the point of cheering? Whether I cheer or not, those who are bound to fail will fail, and those that are bound to pass will pass.\u201dAmy was pretending to be unconcerned, but she was quite bothered inside. How much did his mastery of teleportation go up? Could he even teleport?Practical training was the best way to grasp the feel of teleportation. However, since the process was so painful, the advice given by experienced professionals was to learn the tips and tricks first.Amy, on the other hand, was literally the type of person who learned by tackling with her body. Of course, it was not too painful for her since she had Schema to rely on.\u2018But it\u2019s different for Shirone. He\u2019s not one to give up. I hope he\u2019s in good shape.\u2019Class 7 had some remarkable talents. Depending on the situation, it would not be too unusual if Shirone failed.\u201cHuh? I don't think Shirone is here yet.\u201dWhen Sharelle, who was looking through the peak with a telescope, said that, Amy snatched the telescope away. As she said, among the 20 students standing on the cliff, Shirone was not one of them.\u201cWhat? What happened?\u201d\"You don\u2019t think he failed, right?\"She couldn't guarantee it. She also believed in him because he was Shirone, but in all honesty, teleportation was not a magic that could be easily learned on one's lonesome.\u2018You idiot\u2026 Where the hell are you? What in the world are you doing?\u2019* * *Shirone opened his eyes, squinting against the bright, warm sunlight. Visibility was low and the sky was higher than usual. When a jay flew up in front of his eyes, he came to his senses.\u201cAHH! What's this?\u201dLooking around, he noticed he was in the middle of the training ground. He did not wake up once ever since he collapsed and lost consciousness last night.Ever since he started practicing and studying teleportation, Shirone only slept for three hours a day. Plus, on the final week, he overworked his body to the point he dropped dead.\u201cPromotion test!\u201dCold sweat dripped down Shirone\u2019s back. He rushed out of the training ground without even having the time to feel disappointed in himself. To climb 1,000 meters above sea level, he had to start running like crazy, no matter what his condition was.\u2018Please! Please!\u2019* * ** * *\u201cWe\u2019ll start, Headmaster.\u201d\u201cMm, do begin.\u201dAs Siena burst the Illumination magic toward the sky. Tension enveloped the training ground. Ethella, who noticed the illumination from the opposite peak, looked back at the students and spoke.\u201cOnce my signal goes off, run to the cliff. Whoever teleports the furthest will pass the promotion exam.\u201dThe students gulped loudly, their mouths dry. The difficulty of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed was level 1, so there were no obstacles, but the fear of moving through empty space shook them to their core.Regardless of rank or whatnot, they had to link at least 70 teleportations to safely reach the other end. Moreover, if their rhythm broke in the middle, even their Spirit Zone would disappear due to their fear of falling.\u2018We can't cross the whole thing, anyway. We will eventually fall\u2026 But what if the safety device doesn't work?\u2019Most of the students were stiff with tension because it was human psychology to not fully believe something unless seen. Mark and the operation team were the only ones who could manage to stay a little more relaxed.\u2018Hmph. I trained every day. I can easily leap 70 times if no one just gets in my way.\u2019The variable was that Shirone was absent. The mage dedicated to Mark reported that Shirone\u2019s progress was slow, but it was true that Mark didn\u2019t believe the report until he saw it with his own eyes. But since Shirone wasn\u2019t there, he thought that he was uselessly nervous over a nobody.\u2018Teleportation. I see he couldn\u2019t learn it. Well, he never had anything else but his Spirit Zone to show.\u2019The person most anxious due to Shirone\u2019s absence was Amy. Her unconcerned facade disappeared and she began walking back and forth uneasily near the cliff.\u201cGosh! What happened?! Why isn\u2019t he coming!\u201d\u201cAmy, look over there!\u201dSharelle pointed to the opposite peak. When Amy checked with the telescope, she saw Shirone running to the top. It looked like he rolled around on the ground somewhere because his clothes were covered with dust and his face was beet red.\u201cWhat the hell has he been doing until now?\u201dSharelle let out a sigh of relief.\u201cThat's a relief, though. He arrived on time. But he must be tired. I wonder if he\u2019ll be okay?\u201d\"Whatever! Who cares?! I\u2019m just relieved that he didn\u2019t drop out!\u201d\u2018Anyways, seeing as how he managed to get to the training ground, it seems like he can teleport.\u2019When they saw that his lips were busted open and his arms were black and blue, they could vaguely imagine how extreme Shirone\u2019s training was. Amy regained her senses and looked around.\u201cIt's quite windy today. This is going to be a tough test.\u201dAlthough not as much as flying magic, teleportation was not completely unaffected by wind speed and pressure. The students could not lose their concentration for even a moment in this test.At the appearance of Shirone, the gazes of the students hardened. Thinking he had given up, they were caught off guard by his sudden appearance.\u201cTsk! He probably did that on purpose to mess with us.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. Does he want to be promoted even after doing such a cowardly trick?\u201dIt was true that his appearance shocked some of the kids, but Shirone was the one who was most at a disadvantage due to his current state.Ethella got troubled when she saw Shirone panting. Since he arrived before the start of the exam, there was no problem with him taking it. However, he was not in a shape comparable to everyone else\u2018Will there be no issues with inequality if we proceed like this?\u2019She launched an orange Illumination spell into the sky. Blue meant ready, red was to start the exam, and orange was for a question.Instructors who saw Ethella\u2019s flare shared opinions. There were mixed opinions. One side stated that they should start right now while another stated that they should wait for 10 minutes to give Shirone a break.\u201cWhat do you think, Headmaster?\u201dAlpheus was adamant.\"Let's start. Being in control of your condition before an exam shows competence. I do not believe it is a matter we should concern ourselves with.\u201d\u201cAlright, then\u2026\u201dSiena conveyed the message to continue with a red flare. Shirone cut in between the students standing in a row. The person who kindly stepped aside to make space for him was someone who was part of Mark\u2019s operation.The students were all nervous. After all, no matter what special training they went through, teleporting across a 1,000-meter cliff was another matter entirely. It was an uncharted territory where all of them had an equal opportunity to get through.\u201cThen starting now, we will begin the early promotion exam of Class 7. Get ready.\u201dThe students took a running stance. Once only the sounds of heartbeats could be heard, Ethella cast the Illumination magic.A red sphere soared into the sky with a bang. The instructors on the other side were flipping through the files, ready to record.The students shot off from the ground.\u2018The lead! I have to take the lead!\u2019\u2018I might have a chance if I start first and take the lead!\u2019Most students had similar ideas. Shirone, whose legs had pretty much no strength, was forced to fall behind.But Shirone was not bothered for there was still a chance to make up for the loss. Depending on the person\u2019s determination, the point they would cast teleportation before reaching the edge of the cliff would be different. The best method was to reach the edge, jump off, and then teleport.But how many people could do that? The starting line was the point that held the highest tension amongst the competitors. Also, the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed was 1 kilometer above sea level.Wind speed, wind direction, and air pressure. All these factors differed in comparison to the environment they trained in. If they jumped off with their bare body and their magic failed, that was it. Risking their life for the chance to take the upper-hand was not something most students had the guts to do.As Shirone predicted, with five meters left to the cliff\u2019s edge, students who could not withstand the fear began to teleport away. The rest of the students followed one after another. The students that were part of Mark\u2019s party were among the few that did not teleport immediately.\u2018No! Just a little bit more!\u2019He staggered on, stomping down the rising fear. Shirone was aiming for the best possible start.\u2018Can I do it? What if I fall?\u2019Despite clenching his teeth in an effort to calm his racing heart, the feeling of nausea did not disappear.As they got closer and closer to the cliff\u2019s edge, the team escorting Mark couldn't hold out any longer, so they began to teleport away. Soon after this, Mark followed suit.Shirone continued to run despite over half of the students no longer being on the cliff. And due to that, the team who was keeping pace with Shirone felt their blood dry up.If they kept going, they were going to fall off the cliff. With two steps left to the cliff\u2019s edge, the operation team cast teleportation.But despite the close distance, Shirone kept moving forward. Fear was of no hindrance to him, who understood the nature of the danger.Shirone knew that as long as he could keep could running forward on foot, he could make up for the time he lost due to his condition.\u2018The competition isn\u2019t over yet!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Despite the fierce mental battle happening between the competitors, in the eyes of the spectators watching from afar, it simply looked like they were busy jumping off.\u2018I\u2019m not teleporting until I start falling down.\u2019Despite the edge of the cliff being one step in front of him, Shirone's body did not disappear with a flash. Seeing him so close to the edge, the hearts of those watching thumped loudly.And their eyes widened.\u201cHe jumped off\u2026\u201dShirone jumped off the edge, as far as he could, and into the sky.The weightlessness of floating. Strong winds shook his body and mountain birds flew in flocks, dozens of meters beneath his feet.Shirone grit his teeth and focused on teleporting. At the critical point of the leap, his body finally jetted off with a flash.Shirone was the last to get off the cliff, and as the people ahead started to get ready for the second round of teleportations, the rankings got overturned. The group that started first sagged to the rear.Shirone made up for his late start\u2026 But above all else, he was able to get ahead of Mark by a narrow margin.\u201cWha\u2014\u201dMark freaked out when Shirone suddenly popped up in front of him.\u2018What the hell?!\u2019\u2018How late did he start to overtake me in the first cycle of teleports?!\u2019Of course, they were still on their first turn, so the chances of the rankings getting reversed still existed, but the fact that the first operation went down the drain ticked Mark off.\u201cYou weasel! Stop right there!\u201dWith a hair width of a difference, Shirone and Mark cast teleportation magic almost simultaneously.* * *10 minutes before the start of the promotion exam.A girl headed towards the training ground with a gloomy face.Maria Earlin.She was the third daughter of the House of Earlin, which was a 3rd-class noble family. She was a 19-year-old talent who entered the Alpheas Magic Academy after waking up to her magic talent early.Although she was now stuck in Class 7, it was not as if she never stood out from the beginning.She entered the academy at the young age of 10 and has since then been fighting fiercely to rank up.But when Maria entered Class 7 at the age of 15, she was so happy she felt like she could fly. But her happiness was short-lived as her fear of the competition grew.Ironically, her best performance was in her first year of being promoted to Class 7. However, starting the following year, her grades gradually started to decline. This trend continued to the point that now she was even ignored by new students.At some point, such competition felt meaningless. She realized competition was not something she desired.Knowing it would only bring her suffering, she couldn't find a reason to push for the top-level classes. She knew that even if she were to get promoted, it would just be the start of a new competition with new people. Like a marathon that had no destination, she hated the continuous climb up the world pyramid knowing there was no end to it.She didn\u2019t want to deal with the competition, She only wanted to learn magic for that was what she loved.\u201cHaah, what am I doing right now?\u201dShe felt like she had missed all her opportunities to climb up. And coupled with the fact that she eventually realized she was the oldest in Class 7, she felt like everything she worked for went down the drain. This realization took everything from her. Even her love for magic.But yet she still couldn\u2019t find it in herself to leave the academy. Was it because it was part of her life already? Or was it because she still had a little bit of that passion from before left inside her?\u201cHaah\u2026\u201dMaria, who entered the magic academy because she liked magic, sighed when she realized she was starting to not even know who she was.To her, the promotion exam was none of her business. But to also study side by side with her younger classmates while the exam was happening did not sit well with her.That was the only reason why she started heading to the training ground.\u2018I think it\u2019ll start soon.\u2019As soon as she checked the time, an Illumination magic flashed near the peak of a mountain.It was blue in color. And the moment that light flashed, she could hear the cheers of the students echo.\u201c......\u201dShe couldn\u2019t continue walking. Tears flowed down her eyes.\u2018I have no place there. I guess only the talented ones out of Class 7 are there.\u2019Was this the end?As soon as she realized that she didn\u2019t have the courage to even leave the academy,\u00a0 fear consumed her.At that moment, a devil\u2019s thought consumed her mind, leading her astray.\u2018If Mark wins\u2026\u2019He would never let the person who snitched on him about Shirone\u2019s bullying go.It felt like her heart was about to burst out of her chest and her field of vision turned dark.\u2018No!\u2019She knew that she had to stop Mark, but she knew that with her strength alone, there was nothing she could do.She looked towards the location of the engine room of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed.\u201c......\u201d\u2018Maybe, just maybe.\u2019A small hope sprouted within Maria.She contemplated once again\u2026. She was positive that letting Mark win was the worst possible outcome.Grasping that hope, she opened the worn-out, iron door.Screeeech.* * *One employee who was seated on a chair yawned.\u201cWhen will this end? I just want a jug of beer.\u201dAfter blinking once, his eyelids started to slowly close while his head started bending forward.\u201cHooh\u2026\u201dMaria let out a breath while standing behind the employee who had fallen into a deep sleep.Sleep magic that relaxed the mind hardly worked on mages, but for those who did not practice magic, it had a significant effect.Maria looked around the engine room. After searching for a bit, she found a rotary switch that controlled the difficulty level of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed.It seemed as though it wasn\u2019t even activated because the protruded indicator was pointing to level 1.Grasping hold of the switch, her hand shook.\u2018Is this the right thing to do? No, whether it\u2019s the right thing to do or not, is this something I can even do?\u2019She just had to turn the switch. It would cause something terrible, but when a person was possessed, only the sweet rewards blinded their thoughts.\u2018I just have to make it so that no one passes.\u2019Maria turned the switch.She expected something big to happen right after she turned it, but contrary to her expectations, her surroundings were dead quiet.The silence weighed down her shoulders, making her plop down to the ground.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!Explosive sounds erupted from the competing students. They were in a situation where 20 people were each flashing and trying to cross at a height of 1,000 meters.At an average of 3 turns, while the distance between the leading group and the one lagging behind was not so huge, talent-wise, it was clear who was better.Those who started off early could not endure the considerable height. They were Class 7 students who did not even learn flying magic, so the shock and fear were enough to hinder them.\u2018What do I do? Am I really gonna fall?\u2019The other side seemed too far from reach.The Spirit Zone demanded extreme focus from a person, so it was an extremely sensitive state of mind. Therefore, even a little distraction might shatter it. Eventually, the students in the rear group, who failed the omnipotence of teleportation, began to plummet.\u201cAHHHHHH!\u201d\u201cHelp! Save me!\u201dThe upperclassmen burst out laughing. Since they\u2019ve already experienced this, they only thought those lowerclassmen were adorable.Even the instructors had little smiles on their faces while writing the names of those who failed in order.However, the festive atmosphere took a complete 180-degree turn.One after another, the instructors raised their heads in surprise. During the time the students started dropping, the Air Net should have had plenty of time to activate, but the siren did not sound.\u201cWhat?! What happened?!\u201d\u201cSave the students first!\u201dSiena dived down the cliff and cast teleportation at a terrifying pace. And Ethella, who was watching from the other side, noticed the strange situation as well and jumped down.\u201cHeadmaster, what should we do?\u201dAlpheas hummed and let out a breath.Since two Grade 6 mages took the initiative, all the students were gonna be fine. If they were to stop now, the students who did their best to maintain their position in the leading group would suffer great losses. It would be better to respect the will of the participants as long as their safety was ensured.\u201cLet\u2019s watch for now. We have enough manpower to protect 20 people. Instead, wouldn\u2019t ending things here disrespect the students\u2019 passion?\u201dSiena and Ethella both shot up from the bottom of the cliff at the same time, students in tow.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening? There must be something wrong.\u201dSharelle spoke while looking through the telescope. Other students murmured at the unexpected situation.But Amy wasn\u2019t really bothered. A student dying due to falling was impossible with certified Grade 6 instructors on watch. Besides, the students in the front remained undistracted. If it was her, she wouldn\u2019t have cared either. The ticket to be promoted to Class 5 was on the line, so who cared about safety?However, the second half of the group was in a noticeable uproar. They saw instructors jumping off the cliff to grab the students who were falling.\u2018Is there no safety device?\u2019The only reason why they made it this far was because no matter how similar it was to a real match, it was not an actual one where their lives were on the line.\u201cAAAAAAHHHHH! NOOOO!\u201d\u201cInstructor! Please save me! I give up!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m dying!!!\u201dA large number of students started dropping like flies, but the instructors came to the rescue, saving all of them.* * *The leading group who were still in the game continued to fight their fear.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019They could hear the loud noises from the upperclassmen. This ruffled their currently sensitive feathers greatly.Their shouts reached the ears of the leading group, but it affected no one.In fact, it actually caused their blood to boil even hotter knowing that there were fewer competitors.\u2018This is my chance! All of you, just keep dropping.\u2019The leading group had advanced 270 meters, and considering they were from Class 7, that was pretty good.And while all of this was happening, Shirone continued to protect his place as the first.Mark and his team tried to take Shirone\u2019s place multiple times, but to avail. Shirone bested them each time.Mark gritted his teeth.\u2018Who the hell is he?\u2019Shirone had so far leaped 27 times, and each time, he teleported exactly 10 meters.If compared to a pull-up, it was the same as someone doing a rep of 20 while maintaining the same pace.\u2018Is he a machine?\u2019He knew Shirone\u2019s mental endurance was high, but he didn't think there would be this big of a difference.And all of this was being analyzed by the instructors.Ethella spoke out.\u201cOho, Shirone sure is a talent.\u201dThe weight behind her words was heavy since she was an influential figure who never really commented on anything.Other instructors started joining in.\u201cWell, Mark isn\u2019t too bad. He is still young, after all. His routine is being shaken up. From a minimum of 9.5 meters to a maximum of 11. He\u2019s being inconsistent.\u201dIt was safe to say that his mind was shaken.\u201cOn the other hand, Shirone\u2019s routine is consistent. Their speed is about the same, but the one with a higher chance of winning is Shirone.\u201dIn the midst of the compliments, Thadd\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t so bright.\u2018Talent\u2026\u2019He glimpsed at Alpheas\u2019 face, worried about him\u2026 But his face showed nothing.Suddenly, the students of Class 7 who did not participate in the exam approached Thadd.\u201cMr. Thadd, how is Shirone\u2019s routine that stable? I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201dLeaping a set distance consistently did not seem like something a human could do.Thadd couldn\u2019t help but agree.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dAmy spoke.\u201cHe\u2019s using Compulsion.\u201dSharelle nodded in agreement.\u201cTo be specific, he\u2019s using Repetitive Compulsion. When you objectify yourself, your mind becomes more stable and develops a characteristic inertia. It\u2019s impressive that he\u2019s able to activate it at will. After all, it\u2019s an advanced-level Spirit Zone technique not taught in Class 7.\u201dSince it was not something taught in Class 7, that meant Compulsion was a dangerous state of mind.\u201cHe must have learned it before coming here. Since it helps one endure pain\u2026 Sometimes, becoming a machine is necessary\u2026\u201d\u2018To take what we want.\u2019Keeping that last thought to herself, Amy watched Shirone continue to widen his lead.It seemed as though he was flying towards her.\u2018You\u2019d better come quickly\u2026 Since I won\u2019t wait for you.\u2019* * *Shirone's stubbornness in keeping his lead annoyed Mark to no end.\u2018Fuck! Why can\u2019t I pass him?!\u2019Knowing things couldn\u2019t keep going like this, a female student, who was part of the operation team, flinched as Mark glared at her.\u2018Is he telling me to do it here? Right now?\u2019There was a way.As long as they gave up on their goal of completing the exam, Mark would be able to overtake Shirone for a short while.\u2018Then after that, drop out together.\u2019Their plan was too obvious, but in their heads, it was better than doing nothing and ending it there.\u2018My life is at stake, too.\u2019With a boom, she teleported right in front of Shirone.\u201cShit!\u201dAs soon as Shirone hurriedly tried to brake, another member of the operation team flew towards him from the side.\u2018Sorry. We have to make a living too.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36\u2018I'm sorry. We have to make a living too.\u2019The male student closed his eyes tightly and teleported to Shirone.Fatal injuries were inevitable in the event of a collision.\u201cEek!...... Huh?\u201dHe cried out in fear, but he did not feel the impact he was preparing for.When he opened his eyes, Shirone was exactly 10 meters away from where he was.\u2018He dodged?\u2019In the process of traveling forwards, Shirone abruptly curved right to avoid a collision. It was better than dropping out due to a collision, but he still took a speed loss nonetheless.The female and male students plunged down with satisfied looks. They had successfully slowed down Shirone.\u201cNo\u2026!\u201dShirone, whose repetitive compulsion was cut off by the dodging he did just now, gritted his teeth and focused his mind to try and raise back his teleportation tempo.\"Hey. Just now, the movement of those two kids. Wasn\u2019t it kind of weird?\"A kid from the Intermediate class said with a frown.\u201cI thought so too. Maybe they just got tangled in a rush? No way they tried to crash on purpose.\u201d\u201cBy no means was that an accident. They did it on purpose.\u201dThe person who made that comment was a student from Class 5, Yiruki Mercodine.She was the same person who had given the advice to Shirone back then when he was in the Image Zone. She was thin as a rail, had heterochromia, jagged teeth, and a pointed nose.\u201cHow are you so sure? Sure, it was suspicious, but you can\u2019t be positive unless you\u2019re part of the accused party.\u201dWith one palm spread open, she collided it with her other hand which was clenched in a fist.\u201cOne person blocks the road. The other hits from another side. It\u2019s a great strategy to block both the instantaneousness of teleportation and the space leap aspect of it. If Shirone didn\u2019t dodge by modifying his usual cycle, he would have fallen down. Well, I would have found some other way using equations of motion.\u201dHer classmates turned their heads towards the training ground again.\u2018Gosh, what a poser.\u2019Meanwhile, Shirone began to get a little nervous after looking at the growing distance between him and Mark.350 meters remaining.By the halfway point, the only competitors left were Shirone and Mark.\u2018I won! I\u2019m first!\u2019Convinced that he was going to win, Mark\u2019s body vibrated with excitement.Although he had leaped about 40 times, seeing as how there was no one standing in his way, he did not feel fatigued.\u2018I\u2019m the one who will pass!\u2019High-speed promotion to Class 5. The faces of envious classmates and the sour faces of Class 6 upperclassmen crossed his mind.\u201cHAHAHA! I\u2019m first!\u201dAs Mark sped up the tempo of his teleportation, the distance between him and Shirone began to widen even more.\u2018Mark is in good condition. He will complete the exam by the looks of it. At the rate I\u2019m going, I won\u2019t be able to retake first place.\u2019There was only one possible method left for Shirone.\u2018Acceleration.\u2019While he might be able to get closer to Mark, the risk of breaking his routine was high.However, the only solution was to increase his teleportation link rhyme by a beat faster.\u201cHEUP!\u201dWith clenched teeth, Shirone\u2019s rhythm suddenly accelerated. The sound of the teleportation wave resounded like the beat of a drum.The excitement of the students reached its peak.\u201cShirone is starting to catch up! The winner is going to be decided soon!\u201d\u201cMark! Faster! Faster!\u201dLike the last spurt of track and field, everyone's adrenaline shot up as the distance shortened.Then, something strange was detected by Mark.The iron bar of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed started fluctuating like waves.Mark frowned.At first, he thought he was mistaken, but now he was sure that the bar was squirming around like a living creature.\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201dThe material of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed had alchemical components to it. It was a special material that could change its shape in response to electromagnetic force.\u2018There should be no obstacles though\u2026 It should be set to level 1.\u2019Shattering Mark\u2019s belief, the bar bent like rubber and turned into a lasso.\u201cAAK! What the hell!\u201dAt the same time he freaked out, Mark\u2019s body passed through the huge circle and came out the other way.Though the situation was not too dangerous, since the bar completed its transformation, it was now as solid as steel.\u2018Why is this happening?\u2019Then, the mechanical voice of a woman rang out within the training ground.\u2013Warning. Warning. The engine system of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed has been activated. Level 10. Level 10.\u201c \u2026What?\u201dWhile Mark was questioning who exactly was operating the engine system, he was also doubting if he had heard the system right. He heard it say level 10.The black iron bar that bent and twisted created an ugly-shaped obstacle.\u201cWh-What is that?\u201dSince Class 4 trained on a difficulty level of 6, The class 4 students watching couldn\u2019t help but fear for Mark and Shirone.\u201cHow the hell did this happen?! Why did the engine activate all of a sudden?!\u201dThe instructors were in disarray.It was not enough that the safety device was turned off, but the difficulty of the traps was also at its highest.The advanced-class level obstacles had complex shapes and their speed was also very fast, so the risk of injury was extremely high.\u201cDamn it! Engine room!\u201dThadd was the first to teleport to fly off to the engine room, while the rest of the instructors questioned what to do now.\u201cHeadmaster, what should we do now? The promotion exam\u2026\u201dThe only students left were Shirone and Mark. They had come so far.If the exam was interrupted while there was no clear winner, some people might speak ill of the academy.In particular, since this was a promotion test, they would have to suffer pressure from many nobles.\u2018This is not a simple promotion. Students who have already dropped out will insist on fairness as well.\u2019In that sense, the instructors\u2019 questions were understandable, but Alpheas shouted in outrage.\u201cAre you all really asking that right now?! Halt the exam immediately and signal the participants to stop!\u201d* * *Thadd, who came down to the ground with a boom from teleporting, frowned and headed towards the engine room.\u201cWhoever it is, if I catch you\u2026\u201d\u2018For the prestigious Alpheas Magic Academy to have an engine system malfunction\u2026 It\u2019s probably a mistake done by staff.\u2019He roughly twisted the door to the engine room.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe door was locked.Thinking that maybe this whole thing was not a mistake, his eyes turned hard.\u201cOh, so you want a piece of me?\u201dWhile he held up his right hand that held a big fireball, he felt the inside of the room with his Spirit Zone.\u2018What?\u2019Someone had their back against the iron door.If he released his fireball like this, it would put that person in danger, so he first sent a warning.\u201cOpen the door. Now. I\u2019m going to cast Fire Strike. If you don\u2019t open the door, you\u2019ll die.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care. In fact, please do it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 Are you Maria?\u201dAlthough Thadd had never been her instructor, she had entered the academy while he was in the Advanced class.\u201cIt is Maria, isn\u2019t it? What are you doing? The promotion exam\u2019s a mess. This has turned into a huge problem.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I troubled everyone once again.\u201d\u201cFirst, let's talk face-to-face.\u201d\u201cMr. Thadd, am I going to be expelled? Will I go to jail?\u201d\u201cNo, Maria. I don\u2019t know what your circumstances are, but I\u2019ll listen.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I was thinking straight. I only came to my senses after I did everything. I must\u2019ve gone mad. I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cSo open the door. I don\u2019t want to use harsh methods.\u201d\u201cBut the thing is\u2026 I don\u2019t want to live, Mr. Thadd. What should I do?\u201d\u201c......\u201dHearing Maria\u2019s cry, Thadd quietly put out the flame in the palm of his hand.He no longer thought of turning off the engine system to turn the promotion exam back to normal. He knew it was going to get canceled anyway and that the students would be fine.\u2018Maria Earlin.\u2019What kind of a student was she?A quiet, timid child whose name had never once appeared on any paperwork at the academy.\u201cAll right, I understand.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Thadd scratched his head and turned his back. He just leaned against the railing as if to say he didn\u2019t want to think further.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to come out, don\u2019t.\u201dMaria did not answer.However, the fact that he didn\u2019t try to turn the handle and start yelling at her calmed her a little.Amidst the silence, Thadd looked up at the sky.\u2018Still the same.\u2019The blue sky of the Alpheas Magic Academy that he so hated during his academy life.\u201cMr. Thadd.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cYou hate me, right?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know? I don\u2019t hate girls.\u201d\u201cWhy is the world so unfair?\u201d\u201cWhy? Cases where someone is born as pretty as you are rare. You\u2019re not lacking in any way.\u201d\u201cYou, someone who\u2019s called a genius mage, wouldn\u2019t know what it means to have no talent. Even if I do my best, despair is always waiting for me ahead. It feels like anything I do just\u2026 goes down the drain. Nothing feels like it\u2019s working, I can\u2019t seem to do anything. Do you know what that feels like? Do you know how daunting that is?\u201d\u201c...Of course. I know that feeling very much.\u201dMaria turned her head toward the iron door.\u201cYou do?\u201d\u201cI graduated when I was 22, so it\u2019s already been four years since I\u2019ve become an instructor. When you entered the academy, I must have been in the Advanced class. You know I\u2019m a graduate from here, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen do a bit of thinking. Have you ever heard of a student named Thadd attending this academy?\u201dNow that she thought about it, she couldn\u2019t remember a single time she heard his name during his time as a student.Shirone was an outlier as he was the topic of the students\u2019 gossip as soon as he entered the academy.\u201cNo, never.\u201d\u201cAnd that makes perfect sense. My grades were low, I didn\u2019t have any talent, and in addition to that, I wasn\u2019t from a big, rich family. In fact, I used to always go start fights outside of the academy.\u201d\u201cYou did?\u201d\u201cYeah. It took me an average of two years to go up a class. Hell, when I got into the Advanced Class, it started taking me three. Though, I know things are a little different for you.\u201dThadd continued while imagining Maria sulking.\u201cBut aren\u2019t our situations quite similar? Unless you are the best period, everyone is bound to fail or be defeated someday. The same principle applies to me. I had gotten into the Advanced Class, but I flunked my classes every time without fail.\u201d\u201cBut how\u2026\u201d\u201cHow did I become who I am now? It\u2019s all luck. Luck. I met a wicked mage who yelled and scolded me. You know, I convinced myself that I was doing my best, but compared to others, that \u2018best\u2019 was nothing. And struggling to defeat someone was something I got sick of. But one day, that same wicked mage, told me this\u2026\u201dThadd recalled that time.\u201cTo dream of success while not having the courage to give up something in order to achieve it is arrogance.\u201dMaria kept silent, but a lot of thoughts were going through her head.\u201cMaria, you don\u2019t need to compete. You don\u2019t always have to win over someone. If you like magic, there you go. That\u2019s all you need. There are people in this world who don\u2019t wish to compete with anyone. Like me. While it may be a tougher path than the one most tread, you have the courage to take that path. It\u2019s something you can do.\u201d\u2018Something I can do\u2026\u2019Maria asked.\u201cWhat kind of person was he? The mage that scolded you?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s someone you\u2019re very familiar with. The headmaster of the Alpheas Magic Academy.\u201d\u201cReally? The Headmaster?\u201dThadd\u2019s eyes dimmed at the memory.\u201cYes. From that day on, I became his full-time student and received private tutoring. It was a great privilege. Well, thanks to that, my life worked out for the best. Doesn\u2019t that explain why a dirtbag like me gets called a genius? It\u2019s because I was taught by a man whose name is known all around the continent. How\u2019s that? Jealous yet? Life is all about luck. Hahaha!\u201dMaria once again felt blue.\u201cSo, what I\u2019m really trying to say is, the world isn\u2019t fair. Some people are born with talent while most aren\u2019t. Some, whether it\u2019s because they\u2019re dim-witted or laid-back, jump into any competition. Some just work their butts off. But for someone like me who has no talent or anything like it for that matter, sometimes, very occasionally, a miracle happens. That\u2019s why I find life worth living.\u201dThadd rose from his seat and turned around.\u201cWhat do you think, Maria? Wouldn\u2019t ending things here be a waste and an affront to the effort you put in to get this far? How about trying just a little bit more?\u201dMaria dug her face into her knees.\u201cWhat more are you saying I should do? That miracle you mentioned\u2026 I don\u2019t even know if it will ever come\u2026 Like, what if it never comes? Then what would happen to me?\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying, Maria?\u201dThadd spoke with his hand against the iron door.\u201cThe miracle you\u2019re looking for? You\u2019re looking right at it.\u201d\u201c......\u201dMaria's face scrunched up.\u201cHeuk\u2026\u201dPerhaps those were the words she'd been hoping to hear her entire life. Warm tears dripped down her face.\u201cCan you trust me and try one more time? I\u2019ll help you become an outstanding mage.\u201d\u201cReally? You think I can do it?\u201d\u201cOf course. Talent isn\u2019t being good at something. It\u2019s having the heart to love that something so much your body devotes every facet of its being into it. That heart makes everything possible. Maria, you\u2019re an excellent student.\u201dMaria started sobbing.She, who was pouring out her emotions, suddenly realized and opened the iron door.\u201cMr. Thadd, quickly, the system\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already too late. When I got here, an Illumination magic flashed. The promotion exam is canceled.\u201d\u201cTh-Then\u2026\u201d\u201cThe situation has gotten a little complicated, but I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201dAt that moment, a person suddenly appeared in front of them. It was Siena.\u201cMr. Thadd! What in the world are you doing?\u201d\u201cMs. Siena?\u201dShe first glared daggers at him, but after seeing Maria, her face was full of shock.Thadd questioned.\u201cWhy? The exam is already over. More than that, the person responsible for this incident\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not over!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBoth of them did not give up. I\u2019m saying the competition is still ongoing!\u201dWas that even possible?Level 10 of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed was a practice assignment for the Advanced Class.Of course, it was not an assignment that those in the Advanced Class really worried about, but for the two who were in Class 7, completing it was nigh impossible.\u201cAH! FUCK!\u201dThadd, who grasped the magnitude of the situation, was about to turn to the engine room, but a flash caused by Spatial Warp turned up near them.Ethella rushed over.\u201cInstructors! Something big happened!\u201dSeeing her pale face, Siena asked while trying to hide her anxiety.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dEthella shouted.\u201cShirone, Shirone is\u2026!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And right as their gazes collided, they teleported.BOOOOM!Some instructors started shouting when the shapes of the two were obscured by the obstacles.\u201cHow foolish! Are they planning on going through with this to the end?\"\u201dSiena spoke.\u201cThey just don\u2019t want to give up first because the one who does will definitely be shamed later.\u201d\u201cThis is a problem. What the hell is Mr. Thadd doing?\u201dAnother reason for this chaotic atmosphere was that Alpheas was silent. To be honest, anger was boiling inside Alpheas. Especially towards Shirone.\u2018Sometimes you have to know when to back down. Don\u2019t you know that much?\u2019But he also knew that at times, doing such a thing was not an option.\u2018...There are times when you can never back down.\u2019There was no right answer in life.\u2018Whatever you choose to do, as long as you take responsibility for your decision, what others think becomes meaningless.\u2019\u201cLet them proceed. Neither of them seem satisfied with my decision.\u201dThe instructors were surprised.\u201cWhat? But if an accident were to occur, this could turn into a huge problem.\u201d\u201cNo matter what happens\u2026\u201dAlpheas' eyes turned icy.\u201cI'll take responsibility.\u201dThe instructors were bewildered and could not reply back to their Headmasters\u2019 cold attitude that did not usually surface.The only one who could perhaps somewhat understand Alpheas\u2019 intention was Thadd, who was currently absent.His gaze went back to the competition.\u2018Alright, I understand your will.\u2019He had heard all about Shirone\u2019s past, his origins, and the things he had to go through to enter the academy.\u2018Every moment must feel like your last. I will respect that. But if you can\u2019t take responsibility for the results\u2026\u2019Alpheus was resolved.\u2018This will be the end of your path to becoming a mage.\u2019* * *Shirone felt dizzy.\u201cKeuk!\u201dThe traps were so fast that he had no time to dodge one and have the luxury to think about the next.\u2018I have to look at the whole thing all at once.\u2019To compare it to a maze, it was like running after memorizing the whole map.\u2018There's no end to it.\u2019Due to being too focused on avoiding the obstacles, Shirone advanced less than two meters.\u2018At this rate, my mental strength will be exhausted first. I have to try and move forward somehow.\u2019Mark was thinking the same thing.\u2018There is a possibility that both of us will fail. The one who gets the furthest will probably be the winner.\u2019Like a lion in a circus jumping through a hoop of fire, Mark broke through the obstacle.\u201cHere I go!\u201dThe instructors admired Mark\u2019s bravery and decisiveness as he sharply swerved and penetrated through the obstacle.\u201cThe change of direction of teleportation is by no means easy. I see Mark has prepared well.\u201dMark was delighted.\u2018It worked! I can do it!\u2019When Mark turned his head to look back, he saw that Shirone was in the same place he was previously.\u2018Kekeke, he\u2019s terrified.\u2019Mark was no longer worried about Shirone as he felt he had taken a far enough lead.Shirone shook his head.\u2018No.\u2019If it was simply avoiding a couple of obstacles and advancing forward, that was something Shirone could do as well. However, after analyzing the combination of all obstacles approaching from afar, Shirone realized that there was only one way out.\u2018The path Mark chose is blocked.\u2019As expected, Mark felt the difficulty of the traps increase as time went by.\u201cKeuk!\u201dThe iron bar that waved around like a whip came at him in the shape of an X.\u201cHEEUUK\u2026!\u201dMark looked like he was about to break down.The endless number of iron bars that were seemingly dancing in the air suddenly tangled up and transformed into a net.\u2018I can't avoid that.\u2019Ever since the beginning, Mark was mistaken to think he had chosen an easy path. He tried to leave the current route belatedly, but the net was already right in front of his eyes.The observing students paled.\u201cHe\u2019s going to collide!\u201dAs soon as the obstacle passed with a roaring sound, the eyes of those watching tightly closed. On the other hand, students who could not move a muscle had their eyes opened wide.\u201cShirone!\u201dShirone had snatched Mark away on time and escaped the net using teleportation.\u201cDid he jump in to save Mark? One can only be so nice. He still annoys me.\u201d\u201cHow can you say that? Isn't it natural to try and save people who are about to die?\u201d\u201cNatural? Would you be able to do that?\u201d\u201cHey, you jerk! Why are you imposing that on me?\u201dYiruki had a knowing smile while the other students were busy arguing with each other.\u2018It's not that, idiots.\u2019Meanwhile, Shirone was lost.Although he did good in saving Mark, he was knee-deep in trouble.\u201cAAK! S-Save me!\u201dMark, who had already lost his beast-like will, floundered about with tears in his eyes\u201cJust keep still!\u201dEven though he was shouting, Shirone's eyes did not leave the coming obstacles and continued to analyze.\u2018There\u2019s none.\u2019He had rescued Mark from trap hell, but he himself couldn't find a way out.\u2018No, there\u2019s no way. They wouldn\u2019t make a trap that has no way out.\u2019At that moment, his frame of common sense shattered.\u2018I was being stupid\u2026\u2019Wasn\u2019t there another escape route? Go back out the way he came in.\u201cAhhhh! We are all gonna dieeeee!\u201dIgnoring Mark\u2019s screams, Shirone rushed backwards with teleportation.Yiruki jumped to his feet in the audience.\u201cThat's right!\u201dBacking up was also a strategy.The key was to not obsess over moving forward. Shirone didn\u2019t have to only go straight in order to avoid the obstacles.\u201cHere I go!\u201dShirone, who was moving rapidly, jumped over a huge obstacle that was approaching.\u2018Yes, it worked!\u2019The immediate threat had passed, but level 10 was not level 10 for nothing.As soon as Shirone jumped up, the iron bar tracked him down after transforming into a large parabola.\u2018So it\u2019s impossible to escape this cycle even if I move up?\u2019As long as the participant did not fall to the ground, the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed would continue to harass the participant until they either failed or got to the end.\u201cKeuk!\u201dThe trap became harder to analyze than before due to a slope being created because of its parabola shape. Though, the presence of Mark was also a big burden on Shirone.Sharelle grumbled frustratedly.\"Why is he doing such a reckless thing? If Mark is eliminated, he will be promoted. And not to mention, it's really dangerous to teleport with someone else. You only do that in case of an emergency.\u201dAmy\u2019s replied.\u201cThat\u2019s just who he is. He actually does the things other people only dream or talk about doing.\u201d\u201cI know that Shirone is kind, but Mark even hired people to bother him.\u201d\u2018Perhaps that is why he\u2019s more\u2026\u2019She thought it a little strange that she understood Shirone\u2019s intention.\u201cHe wasn't interested in the ranking from the beginning.\u201d* * ** * *\u201cShirone is not competing with anyone. His only goal is to become a mage. A person who is deadset on a goal does not really care about the process or what other people think. It doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re first or last. All the things they do are in service of reaching said goal\u2026\u201d\u2018And in his case, it\u2019s to become great at magic.\u2019While Sharelle was lost in thought, Amy watched the struggling Shirone.She knew Shirone had no luck this time.\u2018No one in the Intermediate class can cross level 10. It's right to stop the exam here.\u2019All she could do was hope that Shirone would come back alive.\u201cAAAHH! AAAAAKK!\u201dShirone was so focused on the traps that he couldn't even hear Mark's annoying screams.\u2018It's getting more and more difficult.\u2019This was of course natural, however, the difficulty was so high that it now seemed like the iron bar was a huge worm-like parasite, instead of an object.\u2018It\u2019s unpredictable.\u2019Mark's scream disappeared around the time Shirone advanced 100 meters through the wriggling parasite.Mark fainted with foam coming out from his mouth, but Shirone continued on with no care. He had already forgotten about him.Focusing on one thing while thinking of the whole was similar to the Deviate Form of the Four Way Formation.The instructors who were arguing and the students who were making a fuss a minute ago had all gone silent.Alpheas narrowed his eyes.\u2018Crisis raises one\u2019s ability\u2026 However, everyone has limits\u2026\u2019How was he still holding out? The traps present in the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed were moving at a speed of 200 km/h.It was safe to say that any average student would have long lost consciousness.Yet, Shirone continued to pass between the black iron bars.\u2018 \u2026Does that boy have no limits?\u2019The reason why some couldn\u2019t soar indefinitely even when they once rode through an upward trend was because they would eventually feel satisfied with themselves.The same went for magic.Why couldn\u2019t all mages be the best? Was it just a matter of skill or talent?Satisfaction was the enemy of progress. But at the same time, it was human nature and something everyone eventually felt. The feeling of satisfaction was not something humans could do without.\u2018But I don't even see a hint of that in you. Shirone, are you dreaming of infinity with that human body of yours?\u2019It seemed like he never had a vessel that held him back to begin with.Since satisfaction did not exist in him, his mind was able to handle the ever-increasing difficulty.Shirone, who must\u2019ve been in a trance, would not remember this moment.However, Ethella, the youngest bishop of the Karsis Order, would never forget the dance\u2026 No, the valor she observed today.\u2018Even in a trance, he\u2019s constantly calculating and finding a way out. An exit that he has a one over-infinity chance of finding.\u2019What kind of mental state did one have to have to be able to do that?\u2018Even a high priest can only maintain that kind of mentality while in a transcendent state for a short while.\u2019\u2018However\u2026\u2019Ethella\u2019s face turned serious.\u2018Even if he can feel and calculate everything, techniques and skills are a whole other matter. The next trap is really hard.\u2019Shirone had anticipated it.The distance between the obstacles was extremely narrow. They left Shirone with only a 1-meter gap.It was literally a trap of chaos where no such thing as rules applied. The only rule was that things would continue to become more difficult.\u2018I have to break it down smaller.\u2019He had to reduce his 10-meter teleportation distance to 1 meter.Doing so would place Shirone at a level that absolutely surpassed Class 7\u2019s, but no such distracting thoughts bothered him.\u2018Left and right pattern.\u2019Shirone analyzed dozens of ring-shaped traps arranged in pairs at the same time.Left, right, left, right\u2026 The moment his thoughts finalized, he teleported left and right without even taking the time to look at each trap.A flash of light zigzagged through the rings.\u2018I made it\u2026\u2019However, the moment Shirone finally started to regain his bearings, the rings with up-and-down patterns rushed towards him.\u2018KEUK!\u2019In a situation where the angle was not straight, his body took another leap forward.\u2018If I break it down to the extreme\u2026\u2019Shirone\u2019s body shone once again, and as it did a flash of light that bent appeared.The students\u2019 eyes opened like saucers.\u201cThe light bent?\u2019Yiruki got up and opened his different-colored eyes wide.\u201cRainbow Drop! He actually did it!\u201dMost of the students did not understand the flash that followed the trajectory of a wave, but that was probably because Rainbow Drop was a top-level skill that teleportation specialists learned.\u201cIs that really possible? How does teleportation bend? Lights only travel in a straight line!\u201dYiruki tapped his head twice and said,\u201cIt\u2019s a simple principle. Differentiating a circle yields an infinite straight line. Break down the interval of teleportation enough times and you can make it look like light bent.\u201cHow do you even calculate how many times you need to break it down?\u201d\u201cIt's not a calculation, it's a sense. Even then, it's hard to do, but let\u2019s just say he has more omnipotence than omniscience. Though, I can confidently say that he is a genius with a tendency opposite to mine.\u201dThe students turned their heads back to the examination hall.\u2018For someone who\u2019s only in Class 5? Genius my ass.\u2019When the speed of the Bridge That Could Not Be Crossed reached its maximum, even the shape of the structures could not be easily distinguished. Though Shirone's eyes had adapted to it, so he could still tell.30 meters left to the end.The students began shouting words of support towards Shirone.For the first time in the history of the magic academy, they were expecting a student from the Intermediate class to cross a level 10 Bridge That Could Not Be Crossed.\u201cHeadmaster! Over there!\u201dThe faces of the instructors paled.As if jealous of Shirone\u2019s near success, the iron bar started twisting randomly, creating a three-dimensional structure.\u201cDamn it! It\u2019s the Dragon\u2019s Labyrinth! What the hell is Mr. Thadd doing?\u201dWhile the instructors were busy shouting, Siena had a deep frown and hurriedly cast Spacial Warp.\u2018Thadd! You fucking\u2026!\u2019The Dragon\u2019s Labyrinth, which only appeared at level 10, was a trap with a gigantic dragon\u2019s head.Once you were swallowed, it was the end, so you had to link your magic while also remembering how the structure was created step-by-step.Shirone bit his lips and analyzed the pattern.\u201cAAAAHHHHH! What the fuck?! What the hell is that?!\u201dWhen Mark regained consciousness and screamed his head off, Shirone\u2019s Spirit Zone shook violently.\u201cKeuk!\u201dEven at that moment, the Dragon\u2019s Labyrinth approached at its fastest speed with its jaws wide open.\u2018Here it comes!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Infinite MageCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe time left until the collision was at most one second, and this time, Shirone\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but race.He could smell death.\u2018Let\u2019s stay calm.\u2019He was not yet dead, so with that in mind, Shirone narrowed his eyes at the iron structure that wished to swallow him whole.\u2018Think.\u2019Intense electrical impulses hit his brain, and Shirone quickly readjusted his omnipotence and omniscience to repair his Spirit Zone which had been shaken by Mark\u2019s shrill screams.That took a tenth of a second.Shirone thought to himself.\u2018Was that enough\u2026? No, not yet.\u2019He thought faster.A hundredth of a second.He reconstructed the internal structure of the Dragon\u2019s Labyrinth and simulated exactly how it went in his mind in order to find a way out.A thousandth of a second.There were 6 roads in front of him. Shirone needed to link nine teleports in order to escape.\u2018No. It would be possible alone, but with Mark? I have to find another route\u2026\u2019Right as Shirone was about to begin a new simulation, the Dragon's Labyrinth devoured them both.Many students turned their heads, and some even screamed.Sharelle\u2019s scream was the loudest among them.BOOOOOOOM!The sound wave in the narrow space sounded like the screams of Shirone and Mark.ten-thousandth of a second.Despite only being given ten-thousandth of a second, a time which was too faint to be perceived with insight, Shirone somehow managed to analyze all the patterns and teleport accordingly.A single flash of light pierced through the Dragon\u2019s Labyrinth. And in a flash of dazzling light, Shirone crossed the finish line.\u201cHahh\u2026 Hahh.\u201dShirone dropped Mark onto the ground and walked a few more steps. But his body couldn't take it anymore, so he ended up curled up on the ground. There was no place in his body that was not overloaded and aching.Nobody made a sound. The students who took in the scene were blown away. They looked at the boy who triggered this response with frightened eyes as if they were looking at a ghost.Ethella cast Spatial Warp towards where Siena had left in search of Thadd, and shortly thereafter, the engine system turned off, and a voice echoed out.\u2013The engine system of the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed has been deactivated. Level 0. Level 0.Shortly after the empty voice of the machine sounded out, the movement of the iron bar slowed to a stop, and the vine-like structure returned back to how it was initially.The upperclassmen from the Advanced class were the first to speak up.\u201cWh-What the\u2026\u201dAll the students had uniform thoughts.\u201cIs that really possible?\u201d\u201cNo way. This is absurd. That was level 10. He passed the Dragon\u2019s Labyrinth\u2026\u201dAwakened by the students\u2019 voices, Shirone took a second to look around.\u2018Huh? Why are they all staring at me?!\u2019Some parts of his memory were hazy, but he at least knew he had crossed the Bridge That Could Not be Crossed.As his head started to clear, and everything came crashing down, Shirone's eyes got teary as his lips trembled.\u201cWahhhh\u2026 I really thought I was going to die.\u201dConsidering it was said by a person who just made history, the remark was almost too tasteless and uncool.Sharelle pulled Amy in for a hug and cried out.\u201cShirone did it! Your boyfriend really did it!\u201dIt would\u2019ve been better if she didn\u2019t mention the boyfriend part, but Amy let it go this time after feeling her teary friend\u2019s sincerity.Students shoved each other around to reach Shirone in order to congratulate him.\u201cCongratulations! You were really cool!\u201d\u201cSo I guess you\u2019re going to be promoted to Class 5 now. Hahaha! Class 6 kids are going to go green with envy.\u201dWhile Shirone was busy getting praised, the instructors that had gone to the engine room returned\u2026 With Maria in tow.Siena first looked Shirone up and down.Though he did seem distracted by the surrounding students, he did not seem to be seriously injured.\u2018He passed the Dragon\u2019s Labyrinth? How in the world did he do that? Even the Advanced Class kids have to practice dozens of times.\u2019She narrowed her eyes at the person who made her miss such a historical moment. Thadd just shrugged his shoulders and made an excuse.\u201cAs you know\u2014 Actually, no you probably don\u2019t, but I did my best.\u201dSighing, Siena headed towards Alpheas.It was unlikely, but since Shirone and Mark came in at the same time, Siena thought it would be better to clearly announce the results so that there would be no arguments later on.\u201cHeadmaster, let\u2019s first announce the win\u2014\u201dSiena stopped when she saw that Alpheas\u2019 eyes, which always shone with intelligence, were deep in sorrow.\u2018Is something wrong?\u2019Thadd approached fast.\u201cI\u2019ll do it. He seems to have a lot on his mind right now.\u201d\u201cWhat? There were no casualties or major injuries, though.\u201cYes, but\u2026\u201dThadd fell silent.As someone who knew of Alpheas\u2019 past, he understood his teacher\u2019s feelings.The sight of Shirone\u2019s witty and lively appearance must have reminded him of his youth.\u2018Don\u2019t blame yourself. It\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault.\u2019The House of Myrhe\u2019s Light.Alpheas was famous because he redefined photons.It\u2019s an old theory now, but at the time, his idea was so unprecedented and so shocking that it even won him the Gold Circle Award, an award bestowed upon him by the Emperor.However, it was that brilliant talent of his that plunged young Alpheas into the depths of despair.What would have happened if he hadn\u2019t wandered through the dark for 10 years due to a single mistake?\u2018If that hadn\u2019t happened\u2026\u2019Alpheas would have become an archmage etched in history.* * ** * *Thadd tried to put up a bright face.\u201cHeadmaster, a word, please? A man of talent who will brighten the future of this academy has appeared.\u201d\u201cMm? Hoho! Right, it slipped off my mind.\u201dAlpheas, who smiled as kindly as ever, looked back at the students.\u201cThe one who passed this exam is Shirone Arian. And although there is only one victor, I would like to applaud the rest of the students who participated. The courage you showed today will be the driving force that will lead the world in the future. I hope that you will continue to work hard and achieve great results. I wish you success.\u201dThe upperclassmen started clapping, followed by the lowerclassmen.No one could possibly grumble about Shirone\u2019s early promotion now. Even Mark had to admit his loss.\u2018There really is such a thing as a genius.\u2019The scene in which Shirone cast teleportation at an incredible speed during the Dragon\u2019s Labyrinth stage was still vividly etched in his mind.It wasn\u2019t a matter of talent.Most would get intimidated and retreat when faced with a near-impossible situation, but there were also those who didn\u2019t run.\u2018At this point, I can\u2019t even make an excuse.\u2019Mark wobbled over to Shirone with his trembling legs.Most of the students knew of the existence of Mark\u2019s operation team, so there was no way Shirone, who experienced it first-hand, did not know of it. But Mark was prepared.\u201cI lost. I won\u2019t ask you to forgive me, I don\u2019t deserve it. But do know I will take responsibility for my actions.\u201dShirone looked at him.It was certainly out of the ordinary for a belligerent man like him to admit his defeat.On the other hand, Shirone thought that since Mark had no way out of this and had to accept it, he was trying to keep his pride and face by bearing with it.\u201cAll right. You worked hard. I hope you do better from now on. As a person.\u201dHe had many complicated feelings regarding the issue, but Shirone wanted to leave the rest of it for the academy to deal with.And Seeing how Mark raised the white flag, other Class 7 students began to give congratulatory words to him.\u201cCongratulations, upperclassman. You were awesome.\u201dHaving proven his skills, no one from Class 7 even thought of treating him as someone from Class 7.Amy smiled subtly.\u2018Congrats.\u2019And after staring at Shirone for a while more, she turned around.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Sharelle.\u201d\u201cAlready? You should stay with your boyfriend on a special day like this one.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have time for that. Since Shirone succeeded, it\u2019s now my turn. I have to prepare for the promotion exam.\u201dHer steps were heavy for she did not want to leave yet, but she knew that in order to respect Shirone\u2019s resolve and meet it, she had to go and train.\u201cYou sure it\u2019s okay to just leave like this?\u201d\u201cAmy.\u201dAmy flinched when Shirone called.When she turned around, their eyes met. The students around them murmured with surprised faces.\u201cDid he just call her by name?\u201d\u201cOf course. Aren\u2019t they dating?\u201d\u201cI mean, even then, Amy is still an upperclassman\u2026\u201dAmy, who had never given up her place as 1st, was more than just a simple upperclassman.She was considered to be more than skilled enough to enter the Advanced Class. That was why this situation was quite a surprise for them.\u201cNow there are only two steps left.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dA corner of Amy\u2019s lips lifted up.If she passed the Advanced Class promotion exam, the gap between Shirone and herself would be two classes.Amy turned around and walked down the mountain with Sharelle hot on her heels.Around the time the Advanced Class students started dispersing, Thadd approached Alpheas.\u201cHeadmaster, I have something to discuss regarding Mary.\u201dThadd reported everything that happened in the engine room.\u201cI see. What made you decide to do such a thing\u2026\u201dMaria bent over 90 degrees.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve made an irrevocable mistake. I will accept any punishment readily.\u201dAlpheas sank deep in thought.\u201cHmm.\u201dOf course, disciplinary action was unavoidable, but there was much to consider due to the harassment she faced.\u201cThen first\u2026\u201d\u201cI have something to confess. Everything that happened today was because of me.\u201dAnd there stood Mark.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI really got under Maria\u2019s skin this morning. In fact, if I were in her shoes, I would have flipped out as well. I\u2019ll take her punishment. I\u2019m the one who caused all of this.\u201dSiena spoke.\u201cEven so, there is a problem with Maria\u2019s behavior. But why are you doing this?\u201d\u201cI know I\u2019m a shitty person, but I\u2019m not a coward. I\u2019ll take full responsibility for my actions as well as the actions of those under me. Everything I did, I did knowingly.\u201d\u201cAnd that aside, the other kids know it too, anyway. Continuing to keep my mouth shut like a petty loser will only serve to embarrass me. Also, I was the one who came up with the plan to keep Shirone in check.\u201d\u2018I was overwhelmed in terms of skill.\u2019The way Shirone jumped over walls he had yet to overcome made him envious.\u201c \u2026In any case, that\u2019s what happened. I will take the heat. But please let it slide for the other kids. Especially Maria\u2026\u201dGlancing once at Maria, Mark spoke again.\u201cShe must have been under severe stress due to the constant bullying. Think about it. To do such a thing, she must\u2019ve lost her mind for a second.\u201dAlpheas pondered for a long time about Maria.Although her grades weren\u2019t the best, she was an aspirant mage who had been training for a longer period of time. Longer than most people in the academy\u2026 However, she made an awful mistake and was on the brink of being expelled.\u2018Teacher\u2026\u2019Thadd looked at him with sad eyes.\u201cYou will both be referred to the disciplinary committee. Maria is guilty of interfering with the test by illicitly operating the engine system. Her actions caused unnecessary risks. However, since Mark gave rise to the whole situation, we will take that into account and deal with the punishments accordingly.\u201dAs Mark and Maria lowered their heads, other students from Class 7 also started raising their hands one by one.\u201cUm, I also bullied Maria. I think that makes me responsible for this as well.\u201d\u201cI joined the operation team and attacked Shirone.\u201d\u201cI did something bad, too.\u201dWhen all the students raised their hands, Siena spoke out, concerned.\u201cThis is not a class meeting. You broke the rules. And since you\u2019re all confessing, you will be punished.\u201dThe students did not back down.\u201cThese punks! If you\u2019re going to act like this, why bother breaking the rules in the first place\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough.\u201dAlpheas held her back.\u201cSince Shirone showed such an amazing performance, one at the level of an Advanced Class student, I\u2019m sure they felt and learned something.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s also that mob mentality. I think they think that if they hold out and confess together, they\u2019ll end up fine and with no punishment. Do you really think that\u2019s repenting for their mistakes?\u201dAlpheas only smiled and let out a small laugh.\u201cCome to think of it, I think I see an adorable side to Ms. Siena.\u201d\u201c......?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t expect much from humans. Humans are humans. There is no one who is only bad and no one who is only good. Even if they didn\u2019t plan on repenting, at least they have a strong enough conscience to confess. And considering they did confess, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re ready to accept responsibility as well as disciplinary action.\u201dSiena closed her mouth shut.\u201cTo shoulder all responsibilities together. Such a thing can barely be seen in Class 4, let alone in the Advanced Class. Look how all of them are growing up like that. So, well, I don\u2019t exactly hate it. If only everyone in the world had this level of belief and conviction\u2026 The world would be much different. Though I suppose the question is whether they can keep this level throughout their lives.\u201dAlpheas walked up to the students.\u201cI understand. In other words, you guys are saying it\u2019s okay to punish everyone, is that right?\u201dA few were startled, but after looking at each other, they answered.\u201cYes!\u201dA corner of Alpheas\u2019 mouth rose up.\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll reveal the details of your punishment right now. The entirety of Class 7 will be placed under probation for a month.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dThe students were surprised, but the instructors were shocked.Not only was the period long, but this punishment meant that Class 7 would be shut down altogether.\u201cBut Headmaster, words of complaint will come from the students\u2019 families. This will also cause conflict with the class progress\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be responsible for that.\u201dAlpheas cut the instructor\u2019s words and stared at Shirone, who stood a little away from the group.He looked like he had something to say, but in the end, he gave a small smile and went down the mountain.The rest of the students stood stunned.\u201cOne month\u2026\u201dThey felt woozy for a second, but they didn\u2019t feel afraid.\u201cI-It doesn\u2019t matter! We\u2019re under probation together. None of us can take a class.\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s much better than something like a three-day suspension. After all, probation is not even written in our academic record.\u201dThe students calmed down a bit.\u201cHaha! So what now? Do we get to play around and relax starting today?\u201d\u201cAs if! I have to stay up all night in the library. Why don\u2019t we all get together and study?\u201d\u201cYeah, let\u2019s! Maria, you\u2019re coming too, right?\u201d\u201cHuh? Um\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026\u201dMaria was conscious of what the instructors might think.Thadd simply smiled and nodded his head. Maria then smiled and spoke shyly with teary eyes.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll join.\u201dThadd felt happy as he watched the scene. It would be awkward at first, but as long as the punishment kept the kids together, she would be fine.\u2018Were you aiming for this? You are always a step ahead of me, teacher.\u2019Perhaps this situation was a miraculous opportunity for Maria. One that would never come again in her life\u2026 Just like how becoming the student of Alpheas was for Thadd.\u2018We say the world is about luck\u2026 But once you give up, even that string of luck will be of no help.\u2019If Maria hadn\u2019t really loved magic, would she have survived that long in Class 7?Although the world was unfair, Thadd thought it was worth living for that reason.As long as one held on strong and persevered, opportunity was bound to come knocking eventually.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Infinite MageCH 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShirone was promoted to Class 5.Siena, who knew the unique study method of the Core of Knowledge, became the homeroom instructor.It was hard for Shirone to keep up with the classes as he had jumped up two levels, but Shirone decided to stick with his old method nonetheless.Class 5 had a test that occurred once a week and had a final exam at the end of the month that determined a student\u2019s rank for that month. In the first test, Shirone placed 40th out of the 40 students.There were a total of 11 different subjects, and his average score was only 32 points.However, it was worth noting that his score across all the different subjects ranged from 30 to about 33.The average score for the second theory test was 34.\u2018A two-point improvement in average might seem insignificant. However\u2026\u2019His scores for all subjects increased simultaneously.The third test was similar. However, there was one slight difference this time, as there was a steeper upward trend for he scored 36 to 39.\u2018It\u2019s increasing all at once.\u2019Shirone\u2019s will could be felt through his progress.\u2018It\u2019s a relief. Staying in the lower ranks for a long period of time can lead to a decrease in self-confidence.\u2019Siena saw no such anxiety through his progress graph. He was just quietly walking his own path.\u2018Theory tests are important. It is one of the key components that helps one evaluate omniscience.\u2019Instructors regarded a score of about 60 or higher as the minimum standard for one to start using magic.\u2018If he were to raise his average by 10 points per month, he can start using basic magic after three months. And if so\u2026\u2019\u2018In less than half a year, he should be able to use basic magic.\u2019Of course, since humans were not machines, their aptitudes varied depending on their dispositions.However, looking at the graph now, she had a strange feeling that it might be possible since it was Shirone.How far could he raise his score without missing a single subject?Depending on the results, the level of Shirone\u2019s potential could be judged.\u2018His relationships are also smooth.\u2019There were no students who looked down on Shirone because of his low grades.By the time the students reached Class 5, their attention was focused towards the Advanced Class rather than rankings.Countries around the world did not cut corners when trying to maintain the highest level of magic hierarchy. And especially in such situations, it was important for students to specialize in their major in order to differentiate themselves from other mages.Therefore, students who did not yet have any kind of special skills were envious of Shirone, a specialist in light.\u2018I, too, think he has an affinity in the Photon field.\u2019But above all else, The photon field utilized omnipotence more than omniscience. This was because the limits were more so with the human brain itself rather than aptitude.If Shirone had not felt the segmentation of time through insight, he would not have been able to complete the Bridge That Could Not be Crossed.For this reason, Shirone\u2019s classmates could not ignore him and lowerclassmen would often greet him during integrated class.Ironically, one student amongst the lowerclassmen who followed Shirone the most was Mark, who returned after being punished.\u201cPlease, sit here. I saved a seat for you.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dThe leader of Class 7 took pride in the fact that he could be friendly with Shirone.\u201cOh! You were here! Any place for me?\u201dMark gasped and jumped up to greet Sharelle.\u201cHello!\u201dSharelle was one of the top students of Class 4, so she was an upperclassman who could not be easily approached.Sharelle waved her hands with no care and sat right next to Shirone.\u201cOur Shirone, you look a bit frail these days. I mean, your lover did leave, so obviously.\u201d\u201cHaha! It\u2019s not like that.\u201dA week ago, Amy took the promotion exam and finally got promoted to the Advanced Class.According to Sharelle, she passed effortlessly, but anyone could tell how hard she trained for the exam.\u201cYou must be more lonely than me. You were always together with Amy.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s true. But it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m thinking of going to the Advanced Class sometime soon.\u201d\u201cYes? The Advanced Class?\u201dSharelle was more than capable enough to get into the Advanced Class.There were many talented people in Class 4, but she was a talent who stood out in terms of recovery magic.Moreover, since the Advanced Class was a class that only focused on majors, recovery magic that had high performance would give her many advantages.\u201cAlthough I\u2019m not doing it just to follow my friend\u2026 Like Amy, I was inspired after seeing you. My original dream was to go work at a public health center and live whatever, but at some point, I thought it would be a waste to end it like that.\u201dHearing that a talented person recognized by the academy wanted to work in a public health center as her dream job caused Mark to nearly burst into tears.\u201cIf you say something like that, then what does that make me, senior?\u201d\u201cHoohoo, don\u2019t worry too much. I didn\u2019t come all the way up here knowing there was something I was particularly good at. Anyone can make it to Class 4 if they work hard enough. Shirone is just a special case.\u201dShirone hurriedly shook his hands.* * ** * *\u201cNo, I was pretty lucky too. The promotion exam last time was also something that was out of the ordinary.\u2019\u201cI told you, there\u2019s no need to talk like that. I assure you, you will be going up to the Advanced class sooner or later. Although Amy is saying that she will never let you be her classmate. Hoho, try your best anyways.\u201d\u2018Huh. Never be her classmate.\u2019That was something Amy would say. And as Shirone imagined her grinding her teeth while training hard, he felt his blood heat up.\u201cRight. Come to think of it, did Amy decide on her major?\u201d\u201cWhat? You mean you still don\u2019t know? I\u2019ve had this thought for a while, but you guys really date mundanely.\u201d\u201cWe were always like this.\u201dShirone smiled and swallowed quickly. Sharelle rested her chin and fell in thought.\u201cHmm, Amy\u2019s specialty is fire magic, and she specializes in the Target Form of the Four Way Formation. From what I heard before, it sounded like she was probably aiming to be a sniper.\u201dMost fire mages aimed to become battle mages, so sniper was a fairly unique field for it.\u201cSniper? Does that mean she wants to join the army?\u201dReading Shirone\u2019s thought, Sharelle smiled bitterly.\u201cShe can\u2019t. I also think it\u2019s weird for Amy to become a soldier, but it\u2019s normal to choose a career based on talent. Besides, Amy is a Karmis, a 1st-class family. She will have to do anything for the honor of the family.\u201dShirone was worried.\u201cBut it\u2019s dangerous work. After all, if a war begins\u2026 Well, I\u2019m sure you already know.\u201d\u201cThat can happen, but honestly, if a war really breaks out, majors mean nothing. Anyone with a mage job will be made to fight. No exceptions. The magic academy will also become a training center to train prospective mages according to the kingdom\u2019s order. From then on, such a thing as graduation will not exist. After receiving basic military training, they must be put into service.\u201dIt was the bitter truth that was hard to take in.\u201cTo put it simply, we are just tools for the kingdom. After all, the more talented and stronger a person is, the stronger the deterrent.\u201d\u201cEven so\u2026\u201dThormia was a kingdom of great power in its own way, but peace could not be maintained at all times. So being in the military was not the safest profession.This is because if a kingdom they were allied with asked for support, Amy would have no choice but to fight on the frontlines.Mark did not take it seriously and took interest in something else.\u201cAmy becoming an officer in the army\u2026 I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be incredibly popular in her unit. To be honest, I can\u2019t imagine her as a soldier.\u201d\u201cHohoho! It\u2019s because you don\u2019t know Amy\u2019s personality. I personally think she fits well as one. And Shirone, don\u2019t worry too much. After all, it\u2019s not like mages will sword fight on the battlefield. Snipers tend to focus on espionage and covert operations. Amy the Beauty Spy. Great name don\u2019t you think?\u201cHaha, I guess so.\u201dShirone put aside his petty worries.It was true that he was worried, but it was a choice made by a talent who never lost her first place, so he was sure she could handle it.After the integrated class ended, it was time for practice, so students categorized themselves by Class.Shirone waved goodbye to Sharelle and Mark then made his way towards his own classmates.As many were the same age as him, there was a very lively and fun atmosphere.\u201cWow, Shirone. You\u2019re blazing hot today as well.\u201dNade started off.He was the same age as Shirone, and He had green hair which made him look like a troublemaker.He had a cheerful personality and was a very sociable person, so there was nobody he wasn\u2019t close to. Nade was also the first person to talk to him.\u2018He has a good personality.\u2019His grades were somewhere in the upper-middle ranks, having no particular subject he was neither good nor bad at.Well, if Shirone had to pick a subject he was a little better at than others, he would say it was electric magic. This was because Nade was at a level where he could somewhat cast electric magic. And considering an affinity with electricity was quite rare, he could be considered a rare talent.There was no easy magic in the world, but the electric field was a particularly difficult one to acquire omnipotence.\u2018It\u2019s not an attribute humans are familiar with.\u2019After hearing his story, he understood why Nade had an affinity for it.Nade\u2019s dream was to become an inventor of magical weapons, and thanks to his constant handling of machines and electricity since childhood, he found it easy to acquire omnipotence in electricity.\u201cBlazing hot? As if. It\u2019s so hard it\u2019s killing me!\u201d\u201cHaha! That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Two\u2019s better than one.\u201dEverything put aside, he was a friend who had a talent for making people comfortable.That was probably why Shirone\u2019s classmates would go to Nade first whenever there was a topic to talk about, even if it was something trivial.Meanwhile, two boys started walking towards where they were, arguing to and fro.\u201cHey, hey! Shironade, hear this.\u201dShirone and Nade canceled their Spirit Zone after hearing the neologism of their two names.A classmate came close and questioned.\u201cWhich side are you, Ms. Olifer or Ms. Romie? Oh, maybe Shirone doesn\u2019t care since he has a girlfriend? What about you, Nade?\u201d\u201cHmm, I\u2019m, of course, Ms. Romie. Though Ms. Olifer is beautiful as well.\u201d\u201cOhh, my comrade! Ms. Romie is the best, I\u2019m telling you. She has a baby face! And her body\u2026 Ugh!\u201dShirone realized again.\u2018It\u2019s really different from Class 7.\u2019\u2018I think they are both pretty.\u2019Siena had a calm and cool aura, while Ethella\u2019s looks triggered everyone\u2019s protective instinct.Perhaps it was because of her curves, but even after growing, she had a baby face.As Shirone started to worry about getting asked that question, his classmates suddenly left.\u201cEh?\u201dShirone thought it was strange and turned around to see a boy with an eccentric look heading towards him.It was the Class 5 geek, Yiruki Mercodine.It could be seen as bullying, but in Shirone\u2019s opinion, Yiruki really didn\u2019t seem like a people person.But even such an oddball had someone he talked to, and that was Nade, the friend of all.\u201cWhat fun things were you guys talking about?\u201dNade shrugged.\u201cJust the same old thing. Who\u2019s prettier, Ms. Olifer or Ms. Romie? Things like that.\u201dAll gone was his excited demeanor, for he purposely looked less excited in consideration of Yiruki.Shirone admired his quick, mindful personality.Something suddenly came to Nade\u2019s mind.\u201cOh right, Shirone. Let me introduce you. This guy here is Yiruki. An outsider of Class 5.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Infinite MageCH 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt had been a month since Shirone was promoted, but it was his first time having a direct conversation with Yiruki.It wasn\u2019t like he was purposefully avoiding him. It was because there were more days of Yiruki missing classes than attending them.\u201cYo, Shirone Arian. Aren\u2019t you the genius who caught the academy\u2019s attention? I\u2019m so honored I\u2019m going to record this moment in my diary.\u201dJust by his first words alone, Shirone could understand why his classmates tended to keep away from Yiruki.\u201cHi, I\u2019m Shirone. Please take good care of me.\u201d\u201cKekeke, why is the genius asking for such things? Actually, I\u2019ve been watching you ever since you were in Class 7. When you succeeded in the Deviate Form and also when you crossed the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed. I was there.\u201dShirone had a look of surprise.\u201cYou watched me?\u201dAnd that\u2019s when he noticed.\u2018This voice\u2026\u2019The thin voice\u2026 It was the voice that encouraged him when his Spirit Zone was shaken by the students\u2019 criticisms back when he was in Class 7.\u201cAre you the one who cheered me on back then?\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it cheering. I was just frustrated, so I said something. And I also didn\u2019t like you being swayed by the kids.\u201dYiruki said it as if it was a small, troublesome thing to do, but Shirone was still grateful nonetheless.\u201cNo, it was a huge help.\u201dAt that, Yiruki stared hard at Shirone.\u201cYou are quite a boring kid, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dIt was Shirone\u2019s first time hearing such a thing, and it strangely offended him.That was when Nade butted in.\u201cHey, hey Yiruki! He\u2019s still thanking you. It\u2019s rude to say that.\u201dYiruki twisted his head and turned around.\u201cYeah? I was complimenting him. Anyway, do your best. Of course, things won\u2019t be easy. Class 5 harbors lots of obnoxious kids.\u201dThen he walks away with a cackle.\u201cHey, where are you going? Let\u2019s practice together.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s tiresome. I\u2019d rather just sleep.\u201d\u2018The magic academy classes are tiresome?\u2019Shirone was left dumbfounded. Class 5 was an Intermediate class. He couldn\u2019t understand how such a student got all the way up here.\u201cHe seems to have a little bit of a\u2026 Strange personality.\u201d\u201cSorry, Shirone. He\u2019s not that bad after you really get to know him.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. We will be the only ones left tired if we try to pry. That guy\u2019s a genius too. The problem is that he\u2019s a different type of genius compared to you.\u201d\u201cGenius? Yiruki is a genius?\u201d\u201cAh! You probably don\u2019t know because you haven\u2019t been here for too long.\u201dNate told Shirone who Yiruki was. Contrary to the word genius, his grades were similar to that of Nade\u2019s, but none of his classmates looked down on him for it.Yiruki was the epitome of a master-of-one human being. He was a genius who received zeros on all subjects that were influenced by emotions, like literature and art. But for subjects that required computational ability, he was a genius who would get full marks with his eyes closed.At first, the instructors went nuts over Yiruki\u2019s talent and fought over who would be his homeroom instructor and be in charge of him.However, because of his eccentric personality, most of them gave up and paid no more attention to him.Nevertheless, talks about him possibly surpassing those in the Advanced class in terms of mathematics arose, and many instructors started to observe him in order to see if he would be promoted in the near future.Though, if Shirone continued to raise all his subjects together, he would eventually overshadow Yiruki, who tended to cover up his weaknesses with his strongest strengths.The field Yiruki performed best in was computational physics, which only a limited amount of people with special brain functions could do.For example, calculating phenomena that occurred in extreme conditions such as absolute zero or high heat in the 100,000,000 degrees range or more using numerical figures.A person with a brain capable of such calculations often had such a thing called the \u2018Savant Syndrome.\u2019The possessor of such a brain capable of mechanical calculations beyond the limits of human beings. That was who Yiruki was.After hearing the explanation, Shirone had an absent-minded look.If everything Nade said was true, then it was an amazing talent.\u201cWhy is a person like him still in Class 5? No, even if he had no talent, scoring zero makes no sense. Even if he rolled a pencil and took a guess, he should have still gotten a few questions right.\u201dNade laughed.\u201cThe thing is, he\u2019s always been like this. About a month ago\u2026\u201dHe told the story of Yiruki\u2019s theory test.In the natural science section, he received perfect scores, but things were a whole lot different for the literature exam. His results were disappointing in the instructor\u2019s eyes.It was a problem that had an excerpt from a poem called by a poet named Gilberto.The last verse was \u201cleaf that has fallen in zigzags\u201d, and the question asked the students to answer why the leaf fell that way. Most interpreted it as the poet expressing his fear of death\u2026 But that\u2019s not what Yiruki came up with.* * ** * *[Answer] Since the speed of the fluid (in this case, gas) flowing on the surface of the leaf is met by different levels of air resistance, the leaf would move in the direction of the vector with the greatest sum of force exerted by the pressure. Equations using the standard model for the leaf are written below.\u2018Equations using the standard model for the leaf are written below\u2026\u2019Below that, there was a formula that the one who was grading the test couldn\u2019t even understand. Instructors who knew Yiruki\u2019s personality simply thought it was just Yiruki being himself and passed over it. But Adelia, a literature instructor, could not tolerate it.As a mother of three, she rushed into the classroom with her plump body. Then in front of Yiruki, she slammed the exam paper down and demanded an explanation.\u201cYiruki! What is this?\u201d\u201cThe exam paper.\u201d\u201cNot that! Look at the answer you wrote! This is a literature test, not a math test!\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t the distinction between mathematics and literature itself prove the unrealistic aspects of literature? And it also asks why the leaf fell the way it did. And I answered it.\u201dAdelia\u2019s round face turned red like a tomato.\u201cHow dare you brag like you know something. You\u2019re a student. It\u2019s still a few years too early for you to act like you\u2019re an expert. There are also deep and mysterious ideas in the world that you cannot grasp mathematically.\u201d\u201cTeacher, there\u2019s no such thing. If some part of the world is illogical, that would be scary. If such a thing were true, then there\u2019s a possibility that I might just turn into an orc right now. Who knows?\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying everything is logical? Even poet Gilberto\u2019s verses?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I wrote that answer.\u201dAdelia kept standing for a while, then pointed her finger and shouted.\u201cThen answer this. A thousand innocent people are at risk of dying. But you have the power to save everyone by killing one innocent person. What will you choose to do?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d let the thousand people die. Mathematically, the lives of one thousand people who are supposed to die, and the life of one who wasn\u2019t, don\u2019t follow the rules of equivalent exchange. The equation cannot be formed in the first place.\u201dAdelia stomped the rising anger from deep within her.She came up with something.\u201cIs there a god or not? Answer that!\u201d\u201cThere can be none.\u201dHis logical reply made Adelia even more virulent.\u201cMom or dad? You can only pick one!\u201d\u201cBoth.\u201d\u201cGet out!\u201dAdelia\u2019s fingers trembled.\u201cGet out, you punk! You don\u2019t deserve to be in my class! Get out!\u201dA faculty meeting was held.In the end, the instructors concluded that Yiruki\u2019s answer contained ridicule against the authority, so they dropped all his scores for the humanities subjects to 0.\u201cWow, that\u2019s no joke.\u201dUpon hearing Yiruki\u2019s story, Shirone couldn\u2019t believe he was 17 years old like himself.Having the temperament to go against an instructor took courage.\u201cHaha! It really isn\u2019t. Anyways, he\u2019s that kind of a person. He\u2019s extremely hard to get along with.\u201d\u201cNow that I know his personality, I kind of get why he called me boring. But how is that a compliment?\u201d\u201cWho knows? Maybe he saw something extraordinary in you. Anyway, that\u2019s why I purposely introduced you to him. In hopes that he might get along well with you.\u201dShirone got curious and wanted to know more about Yiruki. If he had known earlier, he would have talked more with him. With that, he searched around for Yiruki, but ended up widening his eyes in surprise.\u201cEh? Nade, look over there.\u201dYiruki was walking towards the Image Zone with half-closed eyes. As he approached, the kids around took notice and backed off, not because they wanted to avoid him, but because they respected him since he was an upperclassman.\u201cDamn it! What is he thinking of doing now? Let\u2019s go and see.\u201dShirone ran after Nade.One by one, other students started gathering to watch.\u201cWhy is he like this again? Isn\u2019t he supposed to take his clothes off and lay down somewhere like he usually does?\u201dAt their words, Shirone's eyes popped open. He was gonna take his clothes off while female students were watching?Ignoring the audience\u2019s uneasiness, Yiruki opened up his Spirit Zone. A sphere with a diameter of 15 meters. It was on the small side, considering he was in Class 5.\u201cThe Deviate Form?\u201dThe moment Yiruki performed his Four Way Formation, his Spirit Zone broke away from his body and separated.\u201cOho, that guy. It\u2019s been quite a bit since he last did that.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t we have to stop him? That jerk was banned from using the Image Zone by Ms. Romie.\u201d\u201cLeave him be. Even if we tell him to stop, he won\u2019t listen.\u201dAt that moment, Yiruki\u2019s Spirit Zone began moving around a large area.Amidst everyone's admiration, Yiruki saw Shirone in the audience. The edges of his lips curled up.He flicked his finger and targets popped out from all directions and flew around him like birds.Some students simply sighed as they knew it was forbidden for students to release targets arbitrarily, while some just enjoyed the spectacle.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dThe Deviate form of the Spirit Zone pursued the targets.Like the bouncing of a rubber ball, Yiruki freely bent the angle of his Zone and even its speed. It was impressive.Shirone was genuinely surprised.\u2018That\u2019s amazing.\u2019Ethella, who was instructing Class 4, looked around the Image Zone once and started running.\u201cHuh? Yiruki! What are you doing right now?!\u201dSeemingly already having made up his mind, Yiruki hardened his eyes and flew his Spirit Zone to a target.The moment the sphere swallowed up the target, light began to bubble like foam.\u201cThat lunatic!\u201dBy the time the students turned their backs on it, Yiruki\u2019s Detonation magic was completed.\u201cAtomic Bomb.\u201dThe wind pressure caused by the explosion pushed back the people around. Some students even fell on their butts.\u201cKeuk!\u201dWhen Shirone faced forward again, he saw Yiruki standing at the end of the Image Zone.He had his hands intertwined behind his back and spoke with a blank face.\u201cSee you next time, Shirone.\u201dWhat did he mean by \u2018See you next time?\u2019\u2018What was he thinking? What compelled him to do such a thing?\u2019Shirone couldn\u2019t understand him at all, but thankfully, one question was quickly resolved.Ethella pinched Yiruki\u2019s ear and dragged him away.\u201cYiruki! I told you last time that if you were to do something like that again, you would be punished!\u201d\u201cOw, ow! I held back so that the device wouldn\u2019t break. You know what happens when I make up my mind to blow something up.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026! You really don\u2019t reflect on your actions until the very end! You are on probation for a week starting today! Don\u2019t come to class!\u201d\u201cAak! That\u2019s too harsh!\u201dYiruki shouted, but he continued not to acknowledge that he had done something wrong.Rather, while he was being dragged away, he looked at Shirone and Nade and smirked.\u201cHa! In the end, he did it again. Sorry, Shirone. I think I\u2019ll have to go.\u201dEven after Nade chased after Yiruki, Shirone did not move from his position.\u2018Detonation magic.\u2019It was the most extreme way of handling energy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Infinite MageCH 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe other students who were stimulated by Yiruki\u2019s action started busying themselves by talking.\u201cIsn\u2019t that punk amazing? Though the explosive power is the same, the detonation reaction seems to have gotten faster.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably just the Savant Syndrome doing its work. He can calculate the reaction equation at an astonishing speed.\u201dShirone cut in.\u201cYou mean the equation that causes the explosion?\u201d\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know much about detonation magic, but I heard that the explosive power changes depending on how you set up the reaction equation. You could say it's a similar concept to that of the combustion equation for fire magic.\u201d\u201cI see. With that level of explosive power, I guess he doesn\u2019t even need to learn fire magic.\u201d\u201cNo. Denotation magic is used differently from fire magic. First of all, fire magic activates immediately. Even for Yiruki, if his firepower is that strong, it will take that much longer to detonate. Well, reducing that reaction time is up to the detonator.\u201dIf Shirone's insight specialized in teleportation, then Yiruki\u2019s superhuman computational power was specialized for detonation magic.The biggest advantage of detonation magic was that it could create an enormous explosion from a tiny dot.The further away from the center the Deviate form got, the smaller it got. It was a magic that was optimized for the Deviate form in that respect.Yiruki's talent, spirit zone's propensity, and his main specialty were all specialized for explosions\u2026\u2018Why is Nade close to someone like that?\u2019Shirone did enjoy reading history that involved wars with mages, but he didn\u2019t think that magic had to be so destructive.\u2018I\u2019ve never learned magic with the intention of hurting someone.'He was curious about Yiruki, but it was Shirone who thought that getting along with him was out of the question.* * *As if he really put himself under probation, Yiruki did not come to class.Although he felt a little bad, Shirone was relieved by this.\u2018I wouldn\u2019t know what to say if we ran into each other again.\u2019After an ordinary day, Shirone took his first formal Class 5 evaluation.His average score was 41 points.It was still in the lower range, but it wasn\u2019t an easy feat to raise all subjects by 10 points in one month.After checking the test results, the students tidied up their desks and stretched.\u201cPhew, I guess I can lay back for a while. Shall we buy something and go to our research group?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s. With all the stress off my shoulders, I\u2019m feeling hungry.\u201dStudents started leaving in pairs or more, but not Shirone, for he was not part of a research group yet.\u2018I should go to the library and study some more. My average score is still 40 points\u2026\u2019He was not satisfied with the results, but the process of enhancing his Core of Knowledge was going smoothly.Shirone was pleasantly surprised when he noticed that all the knowledge was connecting much faster than he expected.\u2018It\u2019s proof that my network of knowledge is evolving. Let\u2019s not waver and stick to it until the end.\u2019The fact that he had already finished the 20 books he had borrowed a week ago kept his spirits up.\u201cHey, Shirone.\u201d\u201cYes? What is it?\u201dA female student approached him as he was packing his backpack.From a corner of the classroom, her friends were eyeing them with excitement.\u201cI\u2019ve talked with my friends about this, but would you like to join our research group? We\u2019re researching object-moving magic. We thought that if you were in our group, we could maybe make more achievements. It\u2019s also a field that has a lot to do with photon magic.\u201dShirone thought carefully.He had received offers from several groups after being promoted, but this was the first research group that suited his aptitude.Whether students wanted to join or not was 100% up to them, but there was no case where joining one would be a waste of time.The academy\u2019s evaluation methods were largely divided into three parts. Practical exams, theory exams, and performance evaluations.Among them, the performance evaluation required one research paper on whatever topic to be submitted between semesters. That\u2019s why many students joined a research group, to save time and effort.Most of the students did it this way, as during vacation time, they would be able to visit their hometowns or stay at the academy to focus on fixing their weak points.Of course, Shirone also checked the qualifications to join a research group, but eventually changed his mind.Since he did not complete his work of enhancing his Core of Knowledge, his clumsy participation would only cause them harm.They gave their proposal based on his previous achievements, but Shirone wasn\u2019t sure if he could match their level once all the work and activity started.\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s a field I\u2019m studying right now, and I haven\u2019t been able to make much progress on it yet. I\u2019m planning on focusing on that for the time being.\u201d\u201cOh, I see. That\u2019s a bummer.\u201d\u201cSorry to turn you down even though you personally made the offer.\u201dShe gave a light laugh.\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to be sorry for anything. Let me know if you change your mind.\u201dThe girl went back to her group after leaving behind kind words. In fact, there were not many students in Class 5 who acted upon their emotions. Though there were eccentrics and exceptions like Yiruki.\u2018I\u2019m jealous. It looks fun.\u2019A corner of Shirone\u2019s heart ached. He had friends like Rian and Amy, but Rian was studying a different field, and Amy was in the Advanced class, so she was busy.They say that life is a lonely battlefield, but he felt that he couldn\u2019t get any lonelier considering he had no comrades in Class 5.\u201cEh? Shirone, you leaving now? Wait for me.\u201dNade ran towards him and put his arm around Shirone\u2019s shoulder. This was a regular occurrence already.The two walked to their dormitory while talking about random things. Most of their talks were about topics Shirone liked.\u201cThe library is fine, but there are quite a few specialized books exclusive to research groups. Come to think of it, why did you refuse earlier? They\u2019re a pretty decent research group.\u201d\u201cI just feel like I don\u2019t have enough time.\u201d\u201cWell, I get you. You should busy yourself with raising your theory grades first. I\u2019m still envious. I don\u2019t even have that kind of desire.\u201d\u201cYou have so many friends. I think it would be okay for you to join any research group.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? I already have something like a research group. I\u2019m even the president.\u201d\u201cWhat? Really? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d* * ** * *Shirone assumed that Nade would hate belonging to a certain group, so he didn\u2019t even ask. But for him to be the president?\u201cWhat kind of research group is it?\u201d\u201cHaha! I\u2019m actually embarrassed to brag about it. There are only two people. Myself included.\u201d\u201cHuh? Isn\u2019t that below the minimum? Your subsidy should have been long cut off.\u201dThe academy required at least three or more members in a research group. It was because two was company, while three was a crowd.\u201cOur upperclassmen graduated last semester. That\u2019s why I became the president. But yeah, I\u2019ve been really worried about that.\u201d\u201cOh, so that\u2019s what happened.\u201dThere were numerous research groups in the academy, but having one with Advanced-class members was rare. Moreover, the fact that they graduated meant that they were cream of the crop upperclassmen.\u201cIf it\u2019s okay, can I take a look?\u201d\u201cReally? I thought you weren\u2019t interested in research groups.\u201d\u201cI have always been interested, but I felt that if I joined one, I\u2019d just be a nuisance. I was just being careful.\u201d\u201cHahaha! What are you saying? Even though it\u2019s called a research group, it\u2019s just kids grouping up to study and play together. There is no need to feel any pressure.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Is that so?\u201d\u201c Actually, to be honest with you, you have a side that makes it difficult for people to approach you. You know, kids our age hit on each other, play around, tease, and do all that. And although Class 5 does have its share of vulgar fellows as well, I\u2019ve chatted with most of \u2018em, and there aren\u2019t any bad guys. So open up a little more.\u201dRealizing that both Rian and Amy reached out first, Shirone took note of those words.Noticing Shirone\u2019s attitude change, Nade shouted as if he had made up his mind.\u201cGreat! I\u2019m feeling good. I don\u2019t normally do this, but this is a special case. Let me introduce you to my research group. In exchange, don\u2019t tease me and say that it was boring or lame.\u201d\u201cReally? Thanks a lot. I swear I won\u2019t tease you or anything like that.\u201d\u201cThere you go again. Why so serious? Loosen up. Now, come on, let\u2019s get going!\u201d* * *The place Nade took Shirone to was a remote place northwest of the central park of the Magic Academy.In front of them was a building formed out of 100 tetrahedron-shaped structures that were all connected together to create one building.The material of the building was iron, and if one looked closely, one could see magic patterns engraved on the surface.Shirone was surprised by the shape and structure of the building since it defied common sense.\u201cWhere is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a warehouse we use to keep the magic equipment. Almost all teaching materials are kept in there. Of course, our lab\u2019s there too.\u201dThe laboratories were not specifically assigned. When the president of a research group submitted their application documents, the academy would simply give an empty room to them.\u2018Even so, a warehouse?\u2019Shirone couldn\u2019t understand why the academy, considering the vast land in its possession, would place a lab in such a remote place.\u201cThis place is something akin to a hideout. Upperclassmen have been protecting it for generations. Actually, our research group has quite a long history. You don\u2019t know how many fights there were to occupy this place.\u201d\u201cBut this is a bit\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha! It\u2019s okay. The coolest thing is the countless materials in the warehouse. You can make anything. Oh, that\u2019s supposed to be a secret. I\u2019m only telling you this because it's you.\u201dShirone gasped.\u201cReally?\u201dHe was quite surprised. Nade, the king of normalcy at the academy, breaking rules?\u201cCome, I\u2019ll show you.\u201dNade led Shirone into the building. As the building was complex, there were multiple entrances and exits. It was like wandering around in a maze.\u201cHow is it? Cool, right? You don\u2019t have to study it so closely though. We change the structure of the building whenever.\u201d\u201cChange the structure? Is that possible?\u201d\u201cThe official name of this building is Estas, the magic warehouse. The building itself is a magic device. It was made with the concept of allowing the building to bring us the items we need\u2026 Or bring a section of the building we need. It\u2019s quicker than having to manually go somewhere to get something and then go back. That\u2019s why there are times when the structure changes on days when students are training. The point is, no matter what you do, if we don\u2019t want you to find us, you won\u2019t find us.\u201dNade ended with a cackle.\u2018A hideout no one can find\u2026\u2019Shirone\u2019s heart thumped loudly. In the end, when in the face of cool things, he acted the same as any other boy his age.\u201cTo be honest, finding the path is simple. But you\u2019re not a member yet, so I can\u2019t tell you that. Let me know if you have any thoughts. You're always welcome.\u201dNade quickly led Shirone through a complex path that made them pass through 20 warehouses. Finally, the two arrived at a building with blue-painted walls.There were about 10 large warehouses and 10 small warehouses located in the building. Nade\u2019s research group stayed in the largest one.\u201cTada! Here we are!\u201dShirone approached with a nervous face.\u2018What kind of research group hides in a place like this?\u2019At that moment, Shirone\u2019s eyes landed on a signboard that was hanging crookedly above the iron door.Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group\u201cPsy-Psychic Science?\u201dShirone murmured in bewilderment.He had thought about many different fields while on his way here, but he hadn\u2019t even thought of psychic science.An excited Nade suddenly spoke quickly.\u201cHow is it? Our research group is awesome, right? We literally do research on the supernatural. Ghosts, spirits, the afterlife, aliens, hell, gods. It encompasses all that.\u201dAt first, Shirone thought it was absurd, but after hearing a bit more, Shirone was not totally uninterested.The topic that caught his attention was\u2026\u2018Gods.\u2019Some mages denied the existence of god/s.Of course, each country had its own state religion, and there were priests who performed miracles. However, their abilities were also considered just another form of magic.On the other hand, some religious people regarded magic as just a type of miracle, while some labeled magic as heresy.\u2018Who is right?\u2019\u2018Does a god really exist?\u2019\u201cYeah, sounds interesting. I don\u2019t know if it has anything to do with magic, but it might be worth studying.\u201d\u201cRight? I knew you would understand. Come in. Make yourself at home.\u201dNade opened the door.Shirone imagined a neat research area filled with books that covered their research topics\u2026 But instead, a thick cloud of dust welcomed him.Cough CoughSeeing as how a thick cloud of dust welcomed him the moment he opened the door, Shirone frowned and was not looking forward to seeing the rest of the space.The room was about 534 square feet. The desk had a broken leg and was filled with bread and crumpled papers.\u2018And he told me they renovated the warehouse\u2026\u2019As a matter of fact, it seemed that only the sign had been renovated.\u201cHahaha! A little dirty, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019ll get used to it after a while. Don\u2019t just stand there, come in, come in.\u201dShirone did not understand why he had to get used to it.\u2018\u2026Why not just clean the place up.\u2019However, even those questionable things disappeared the moment he saw the board hanging in front of him.There was a boy who was writing mathematical formulas at an insane speed.As Shirone approached, he noticed it was a familiar figure. Shirone\u2019s eyes widened as he made a noise of recognition.\u201cEh?\u201dThe boy was Yiruki, who was under probation for a week.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nade gave a sheepish smile and explained the situation.\u201cSorry. Actually, our research group has a bit of notoriety. It\u2019s a bit difficult to reveal our members.\u201dNow Shirone understood why Yiruki was close to Nade, but aside from that, his confusion stemmed from the fact that Yiruki was in the Supernatural Psychic Science.Considering that Yiruki followed and praised logic, him being in an unscientific group was extremely surprising for Shirone.\u201cYou mean Yiruki is interested in stuff like this?\u201dNade shook his head.\u201cNo, it\u2019s actually the opposite. He\u2019s approaching it from the opposite side. He believes that there\u2019s nothing illogical in this world. So what better group could there be to join than this one?\u201dEven amidst Nade\u2019s and Shirone\u2019s conversation, Yiurki murmured something as if he hadn\u2019t noticed anything.Then after looking Nade\u2019s way, he noticed Shirone. His face brightened.\u201cShirone!\u201dHe approached without even giving Shirone time to say hello and shook his shoulders.\u201cYou came just in time. I just came up with something great! That great thing is\u2026 Splitting the smallest matter! You might think how splitting the smallest is possible. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. If you split the smallest matter, it\u2019s no longer a substance! So then, what the hell is it? I\u2019ve been doing the math for three days, and to my surprise, my god! It contains tremendous energy! What if this whole thing is possible? Hm? What do you think will happen? Quickly, tell me.\u201dYiruki spoke so fast Shirone couldn\u2019t clearly understand, but seeing as how Yiruki\u2019s eyes were burning with passion, he felt like he had to say something.\u201cU-Um, well? The energy will be released?\u201d\u201cAn enormous explosion! An unimaginable explosion! An explosion that can blow up an entire city! Can you imagine it? Huh? If it\u2019s you, you might be able to imagine it!\u201dShirone was dumbfounded.Of course, he could imagine, but it was terrifying to even think about.\u201cIf that happens, a lot of people will die.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s an explosion! An explosion! The city will be completely blown away!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying! What will happen to the people living in the city if an explosion of that magnitude were to occur?\u201d\u201cHuh? The people living there?\u201dYiruki tilted his head, unable to understand what Shirone was saying. Shirone finally realized something and asked again.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019ve never thought about that, have you?\u201d\u201cOf course not. What\u2019s of importance is how big the explosion can be. Do I have to bother thinking about things like that?\u201dShirone got goosebumps.\u201cHow could you? Does it make sense that a mage doesn\u2019t even consider the ramifications of his magic?\u201d\u201cYou talk foolishly, Shirone. Leave those things for anthropologists to ponder over. It is the duty of a genius to breakthrough. It\u2019s not that other mages don't do it even though they can. It\u2019s simply because they can\u2019t. The genius-ness given to us only exists so that we do something with it.\u201d\u201cGenius or not, I don\u2019t care! I\u2019d rather be a fool than be a genius who chooses to harm people.\u201dYiruki did not back down either.\u201cHandful geniuses lead the majority that are fools. History proves it. It\u2019s also the unwanted reality in which we belong, Shirone, you should know how much I hate rubbing idealism in someone\u2019s face.\u201d\u201cNo, your logic is derived from defeatism, not reality. Ideals can come true.\u201d\u201cAn ideal is only that. Something that we WISH could be.\u201dConsidering how heated their debate had gotten, Nade finally decided to break them apart.\u201cNow, now, stop it. Discussions and debates are all good, but emotional fights are a no-no. Let\u2019s sit down and talk calmly.\u201d\u201cNo, I have nothing to say. Nade, I\u2019m leaving.\u201dShirone opened the door and left.Seeing the benignant Shirone leave so coldly meant he was really angry.\u201cH-Hey Shirone, wait up! How are you going to find your way out alone?\u201d\u201cLeave him. It\u2019s not like the structure has changed. He should have at least memorized the way to get here. If he can\u2019t even do that, then he\u2019s really stupid.\u201dBy the time Nade opened the door and left the room, Shirone was already walking out of the building.Returning back to their hideout, Nade frowned and asked.\u201cWhy did you do that? You could have said it in a more acceptable way.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why I did that either. I\u2019ll admit, I was a little aggressive. After all, he is my rival.\u201d\u201cWhaaat?\u201dIt was extremely rare for the word \u2018rival\u2019 to leave Yiruki\u2019s mouth. Not because he was arrogant, but more so because Nade knew his friend wasn\u2019t interested in competition.\u2018It\u2019s not just a competition to him.\u2019Relationship with the opposite sex, wealth, fame. Nothing could move him.The only thing Yiruki was crazy about was the mathematical expression he considered the most beautiful in the world.\u201cShirone is your rival? Are you serious about that?\u201dYiruki smirked and sat down on the sofa, causing a cloud of dust to fume into the air.\u201cShirone\u2019s early promotion exam. Did you see it?\u201d\u201cI saw it. That\u2019s why he\u2019s our classmate.\u201d\u201cDo you know how fast a person who first learned teleportation must think to pass level 10? And the Dragon\u2019s Labyrinth at that?\u201dWhile Nade kept quiet, Yiruki tapped his head.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible without an enormous division of time. According to my calculations, Shirone must have made his decisions in a ten-thousandth of a second.\u201d\u201cA ten-thousandth of a second\u2026\u201dAs Nade tried to imagine that, Yiruki let out a shrill laugh and cackled.\u201cThat\u2019s the mystery of insight. Faster than effort while also being more accurate than knowledge. Any conscious calculations will be slower than intuition. But, say, Nade.\u201dYiruki\u2019s eyes gleamed.\u201cWhat if it was me?\u201dShirone\u2019s insight versus Yiruki\u2019s calculation speed, the question was which of the two would be faster.The question remained unanswered.Like a showdown between different species of animals from different myths, Nade's blood rushed just thinking about it.* * ** * *After being called out by Siena, Shirone followed her into the teacher\u2019s lounge.She spoke as she set down the teacup.\u201cNow, since I was treated last time, it\u2019s my turn this time.\u201d\u201cHaha, thank you.\u201d\u2018He seems to be faring much better than when he was in Class 7.\u2019She heard that Shirone had grown a bit bolder and even joked around with his classmates.\u201cWhy did you call me over?\u201d\u201cI saw your report card and noticed that you\u2019ve been consistently growing. I\u2019m particularly happy that the subject I teach, chemistry, is your highest grade.\u201d\u201cHehe. It\u2019s still only by one point.\u201dIn Siena\u2019s point of view, that single point was enough to build up her pride.\u2018Honestly, I didn\u2019t expect him to last this long.\u2019No matter how much of a genius one was, once one reached a certain point, their talents and weaknesses in certain fields would show.However, Shirone maintained an average of 45 points for all subjects.\u2018That means Shirone\u2019s limits are higher than I expected.\u2019Siena, who came to a conclusion, said.\u201cIf you continue like this, you\u2019ll be able to make it to the upper-middle ranks starting next month. The academy will also start paying attention to your way of studying.\u201d\u201cAh, I wasn\u2019t trying to attract attention to myself.\u201d\u201cOf course, I know. That\u2019s why I called you, to make a proposal.\u201d\u201cA proposal\u2026?\u201d\u201cDid you know that there is a practical evaluation every two months? After looking into it, there is a targeting exam at the end of this month. Do you know what that is?\u201d\u201cYes, I saw it while Amy was still in Class 4. It\u2019s a test where you hit a target within a certain amount of time. Amy in particular was very fast because she\u2019s a target type. It was amazing.\u201dShirone\u2019s eyes were shining.Siena felt that his strong suit was that he was unconcerned with superiority and inferiority.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Amy seems to have adjusted well to the Advanced class. You must be sad to be separated from your girlfriend.\u201dThe Advanced class and the Intermediate class were far apart, and they also had different curricula, so there were nearly no opportunities to meet.They could go on a date on the weekends, but they weren\u2019t actually dating, and Shirone didn\u2019t want to disturb her either.\u201cIt\u2019s enough that I know she\u2019s working hard. I have to support her as her boyfriend.Siena smiledAt first, she was concerned, but if their relationship stayed like this, she would rather encourage it.\u201cIt\u2019s rare to see a couple like you guys. Alrighty, let\u2019s get down to business. The reason I called you today is because of the practical evaluation. Besides teleportation, have you learned any other magic?\u201d\u201cNo. As you can see from my grades, I haven\u2019t met the standard yet\u2026 Oh! That\u2019s right!\u201dShirone realized belatedly.\u2018I have to use active magic during the practical evaluation.\u2019There was no need to insist on attack magic, but the only magic that Shirone could use was teleportation, which was a passive magic. Passive magics were magics that affected the caster.On the other hand, active magics were magics that affected the world itself. There were various types, such as Fire, Windcutter, Healing, Ice Sword, Lightning Bold, and Atomic Bomb.\u201cWhat should I do? I have to know at least one active magic to be able to attack the targets, but I totally forgot about learning one because I was busy studying.\u201d\u201cNothing to worry about. Since you\u2019ve mastered the Rainbow Drop, a simple active magic should be nothing.\u201d\u201cBut my average theory grade is 45 points. You said that the minimum in order to cast active magic is 60.\u201d\u201cUsually, it is. But you have something going for you\u2026 Your knowledge that nearly reaches 100 points.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dShirone blinked once and shouted.\u201cAH! The Photonization theory!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. There are also several different types of photons. Since you\u2019ve studied enough theory, you\u2019ll be able to apply that.\u201d\u201cRight! Thank you, Ms. Siena.\u201d\u201cAs your supervising instructor, it\u2019s something I have to do. If you face any difficulties in the future, consult me anytime.\u201d\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll consult you right now. What kind of active magic can I develop from the photonization theory?\u201dSiena smiled at the key question.\u201cHave you ever heard of photon output?\u201d\u201cI read it in a book. Is it the shooting of photons outward?\u201dIt was a phenomenon called \u2018photon emission.\u2019Of course, due to the nature of photons, shooting them outwards didn\u2019t mean something special would occur.If one were lost in the mountains, it would be easier to cast lighting magic to light up the surroundings than to light the surroundings through photon emission.Even the theory of photonization, which was called the great discovery, varied in efficiency depending on how it was used.Shirone asked.\u201cI can take the test itself, but is it really efficient to study for it? Wouldn\u2019t it be a waste of time?\u201dSiena\u2019s thoughts were different.\u201cIn terms of the present, yes. However in the advanced magic society, for example, in the Ivory Tower, some view photon output as the future of mankind.\u201dShirone listened carefully.\u201cIt is often overlooked, but the really important thing is that there is no matter faster than light. Besides, collimation is easy to control. It is viewed that way because, due to the way photons work, it can lead to innovations in the field of information and communication in the future.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201d\u201cThe future of photon output is bright. It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to master it in advance.\u201dShirone nodded.\u201cYes. It\u2019s fine as long as I don\u2019t waste any time. As you said, I will start practicing today.\u201dIn any case, the only magic he could learn immediately for the exam was photon emission.After the consultation, Shirone headed to the training grounds.There was not much time left until the practical evaluation, so he was on a tight schedule.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s do this!\u201dShirone held out his hand and focused.\u2018Magical action.\u2019Magical action referred to a mage taking a special action or posture to strengthen his omnipotence.\u2018Here goes!\u2019\u2026No light shot out.\u2018Darn!\u2019While his omniscience was perfect, he couldn\u2019t reach the omnipotence required for photon emission.\u2018Teleportation was easy though\u2026\u2019Shirone was more inclined towards defensive and passive magics rather than offensive magics, which was what photon output was mainly used for.\u2018Switching to an offensive type means I have to give up a lot of Spirit Zone area. Even so\u2026\u2019\u2018Does that mean I can\u2019t cast photon output in its entirety?\u2019\u2018No way. Even students with a smaller Spirit Zone than me can use simple active magic.\u2019Suddenly, Ethella\u2019s words regarding Spirit Zone strengthening came to Shirone\u2019s mind.\u2018There must be a special method. What could it be?\u2019Shirone, who was thinking hard, noticed an inconsistency.\u2018Spirit Zone is the most sensitive state of mind. How can I strengthen it?\u2019On his first day, questions mounted high in heaps.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43The next day.Shirone headed to the training grounds early in the morning. There were an unusual amount of students already there.\u2018Everyone is thinking the same, I see.\u2019He was more motivated than ever to start training in preparation for the practical evaluation.The test subjects varied per class, but the class which Shirone belonged had targeting, a.k.a the evaluation called Speed Gun.\u201cUgh! I guess today I\u2019ll practice for Speed Gun until I die. It\u2019s the subject I\u2019m least confident in. Target types are lucky, they\u2019ll have the advantage.\u201d\u201cNot necessarily. The Target Form works best against a small number of targets, but during the evaluation, there will be a lot of them. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to convert to Offensive Form and explode them at random?\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019ll get tired early. Still, it\u2019s either Offensive Form or Target Form. No one would ever use the Deviate Form. How would they catch up with all the targets?\u201d\u201cThere are exceptions. I mean, look at Yiruki. Won\u2019t he use the Deviate form again?\u201d\u201cHaha! No way, unless he\u2019s an idiot. But aside from that, I\u2019m curious about Shirone. He\u2019s strong in actual live practice. Is he going to find a breakthrough using the Defense Form?\u201dThough they were not top-rankers, Shirone and Yiruki were often mentioned.The expectation was that they would show an exceptional performance at a decisive moment.Though, it was also not unreasonable to think that Yiruki would cause a disaster this time around.On the other hand, Shirone wanted to cry.Strong in live practice? As if. He hadn\u2019t even successfully cast the Photon Output yet.\u201cUgh, what do I do? I\u2019m getting antsy.\u201dAt that moment, the other side of the training ground suddenly grew noisy.The girls were the first to notice the sound of a dog barking. The boys, who belatedly noticed it as well, ran towards the noise.\u201cWhat the\u2026 How did it get in?\u201d\u201cMust be a dog from the mountains. But why\u2019s it barking like that?\u201dAs people started gathering around it, the dog started getting defensive and growled. It bore its teeth.Then the students from Class 7 started throwing stones.\u201cHey! Get out of here! You\u2019re making our days worse!\u201dThe upper class didn\u2019t even try to stop them.They thought that since the dog was hostile to people, it was no different from a wild beast.Conversely, Shirone, who had been listening carefully to the dog\u2019s howling, ran to the dog with a surprised expression.\u201cWait a minute! Stop throwing stones!\u201dMark moved quickly.\u201cHey, HEY! You guys are going too far! Your upperclassman is telling you to stop.\u201dWhile the students from Class 7 stood frozen, Shirone strode towards the dog.Mark followed behind.\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s a wild dog.\u201d\u201c It doesn\u2019t matter if they grew up in the wild, dogs don\u2019t typically bite people as an instinct. They actually rather run away than fight.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s barking like that!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s probably\u2026\u201dThe dog growled, but it couldn\u2019t bear to attack, so it backed off.Capitalizing on this, Shirone looked straight into the dog\u2019s eyes and pushed it back into the woods.As expected, a tiny puppy was lying in the grass.\u201cIt hurt its leg.\u201d\u201cHuh? You\u2019re right. Guys, there\u2019s a puppy. A puppy.\u201dShirone stopped Mark.\u201cDon\u2019t call them yet. If the dog feels that we might threaten the pup, it will attack. \u201d\u201cOh, I see. Hey! Don\u2019t come, don\u2019t come!\u201d\u201cInstead, can you find someone who can use Recovery magic? Someone from Class 5.\u201dHe thought it would be nice if Sharelle could help, but no matter how close he was, he couldn\u2019t call an upperclassman.\u201cMaria knows how to. Give me a minute, I\u2019ll bring her.\u201dAfter her probation ended, Maria, guided by Thadd, had a much brighter personality.\u201cOh my! How did it get hurt like this?\u201d\u201cIt looks like it was bitten because it got caught up in a territorial fight. Can you heal it?\u201d\u201cYes, I can. This small of an injury is easy.\u201dMaria healed the dog and the puppy with Recovery magic. The puppy, which regained its health, ran around in circles. The mother then stopped barking and took her pup back to the mountain.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. How did you know there was a puppy?\u201d\u201cHm? Haha! I lived in the mountains for a long time.\u201dShirone recalled when he was 11 years old. He had gone hunting with his father.They were lucky that day. A red bear, which was known for its value as even the claws could be sold for money, was caught on a rope and was struggling. Vincent had hurriedly aimed his arrow at it, not giving it time to tear the rope.Shirone waited behind anxiously. If they were to catch a red bear, they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about food for the time being.\u2026But the arrow showed no sign of being released. Shirone turned his head in question, but Vincent had already retracted his bow and was preparing to leave.\u201cI couldn\u2019t be any more unlucky. Let\u2019s go back, Shirone.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why don\u2019t you catch it? Mom would surely love it.\u201dVincent squatted down and pointed to where the bear was being held.\u201cLook over there, Shirone.\u201dShirone looked carefully. It was a bear cub whimpering next to its captive mother.\u201cA hunter doesn\u2019t catch a mother with a cub. Even though they are animals, they love their young the same way we humans do.\u201d\u201cBut then we\u2019re at a loss. There's amazing prey over there.\u201dVincent looked at Shirone with a warm gaze.\u201cJust as that bear has a cub, I have you too. As a parent, how can I just ignore that? Fighting to live is the same for everyone. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a human or animal. But you shouldn\u2019t kill a parent in front of their child. It is an unwritten rule that applies to all living things.\u201dShirone couldn\u2019t express it in words, but he felt something get engraved into his heart.Something that would never be forgotten even after a lifetime.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]* * *The students were moved by Shirone\u2019s story.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYour dad\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201cYeah. No wonder Shirone is so kind.\u201dAs Shirone\u2019s classmates also joined in to say something, Yiruki appeared and decided to pour cold water on the warm atmosphere.\u201cThat\u2019s a stupid theory. Hunters don\u2019t let go of their prey just because of that.\u201dEveryone turned their heads in discontent at Yiruki\u2019s words, even the lowerclassmen.But Yiruki kept calm.\u201cThe reason why hunters don\u2019t kill animals with babies present is so that the baby won\u2019t grow up to be aggressive towards humans. In zoology, this is called the imprinting effect. Once the parents become hostile to humans, their offspring inherit their nature, and it becomes increasingly difficult to hunt them. But if you kill the young, the population would be cut off.\u201dShirone choked up in tears. Of course, Yiruki was saying things without knowing anything, but his remark was an insult to his father\u2019s sentiment.\u201cHow can you say that? Of course, there are hunters who may think that way, but most hunters release the beast out of compassion.\u201d\u201cHeart. Emotion. How they wanna package it is up to them. I\u2019m talking about reality. Unlike you, I don\u2019t delude people with foolish idealism.\u201d\u201cWhat?! Are you done talking?!\u201dShirone got up quickly and glared at Yiruki. This was their 2nd argument.The student onlookers were dumbfounded. Shirone was not the type to fight anyone, while Yiruki didn\u2019t get along with anyone. When the two collided, the tensions soared multiple folds.\u201cWhat is this? Did something happen between those two before? It seems like this is a continuation of something.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re keeping each other in check. After all, those two are definitely among the candidates to be promoted next.\u201dShirone narrowed his eyes and glared. Yiruki, on the other hand, looked around and did something else. It was clear he did not want to fight.\u201cHey, hey! Why are you guys like this again? No wonder it was quiet. Since a teacher is coming, let\u2019s go back.\u201dThanks to Nade interfering and tearing the two apart, it didn\u2019t turn into a big fight, but Shirone was still displeased.He couldn\u2019t understand Yiruki\u2019s way of thinking. First, his researching of a power strong enough to blow up a whole city. Secondly, belittling the lives of animals. Shirone did not like Yiruki\u2019s perspective on things.\u2018Whatever. I\u2019ll stop confronting him from now on.\u2019Class started.As Ethella climbed up the mountain, The mouths of the students dropped due to her unusual appearance.Was it because it was the practical evaluation period? She was wearing a training suit with short sleeves. She also wore shorts that revealed her thighs for easier movement.Most shocking of all was that she was not wearing glasses.The male students\u2019 minds went blank at the sight of her. How could one\u2019s appearance change so much?\u201cYou guys all know that there is a special education starting from today onwards, right? The Speed Gun exam for Class 5 will be held first due to the practice ground circumstances. Please note that the time allocations will be divided by class starting tomorrow. In any case, today\u2019s class will begin after we watch the assistant\u2019s demonstration. Samuel, this way.\u201dA tall, handsome blond man stood in front of the students. He seemed to be in his early 20s and had long hair stretching down to his waist, which was uncommon.\u201cThe teaching assistant standing before you is Samuel, who is preparing for his graduation from the Advanced class. His major is Incantation magic, and today he came to demonstrate some magic. It is related to strengthening your Spirit Zone as well, so pay attention.\u201dThe students gave a big round of applause, especially the female students.\u201cNice to meet you. It feels like it was just yesterday that I was in your shoes. Time sure does fly. Although I\u2019m not too skilled, I\u2019ll do my best in hopes that it will help with your education.\u201d\u2018Advanced Class.\u2019Shirone\u2019s eyes sparkled.It was an opportunity to see how good the students who were competing with Amy were.Shouts of awe burst out as Samuel opened his Spirit Zone in the Image Zone.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dA Spirit Zone 42 meters in diameter was surrounding him.Samuel spoke.\u201cIncantation magic is used to strengthen magic through the power of words. First of all, let\u2019s try to cast Tornado with no incantation for comparison. Tornado.\u201dA powerful tornado was cast in a short moment. Samuel raised both his hands lightly as if to support it.\u201cF-Fast.\u201dThere were students in the Intermediate Classes who knew Tornado, but Samuel\u2019s proficiency with it was on a whole other level.Samuel spoke with a kind smile.\u201cPlease remember the strength of the spell. This time, I\u2019m going to use Incantation magic to strengthen it. By using the will contained in the words, the mage\u2019s mental gets stronger.\u201dSamuel recited a poem consisting of eight phrases.\u201cEarth of furor, I borrow thy power, so touch my hand. Looking down at the sky, the history of achievement, be captured in a moment. When the power of inanity is in the hands\u2026\u201dThe faces of the students got painted with boredom as they felt like they were now in a literature class.Though not long after, Samuel spoke, holding his hands up again.\u201c\u2026Tornado.\u201dAs the tornado burst out with a tremendous explosion, the students couldn\u2019t help but hold their breath.The wind was so condensed that Samuel\u2019s figure looked hazy.\u201cThis is the power of Incantation. Words have a will of their own, and when savored, it strengthens the mind. Speak and ruminate. That is the basic system of Incantation magic.\u201d\u201cHaa.\u201dAs the frozen-stilled students let out a breath, Samuel spoke with a smile.\u201cNow\u2026 let\u2019s get down to business.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44The students were stupefied.\u201cG-Get down to business?\u201dThey were bewildered because the power Samuel had shown just now was enough to really showcase the power of Incantation magic.\u201cEarth of furor.\u201dSamuel recited the same poem again.One difference was that the speed at which he spoke became faster.\u201cI borrow thy power so touch my hand. Looking down at the sky, the history of achievement, be captured in a moment.\u201dIt was almost frightening how fast he sped up. His words were almost incomprehensible.\u201cThesacredlandoftheskyexistsinthyheart,andthewillofthemageistoextolandsingsongsofpraiseintheworld\u2026!\u201dAnd finally, a sound that could not be considered as language broke and spread out.Samuel\u2019s face distorted terribly while the sound he was creating resembled that of a dolphin\u2019s cry.The speed of the incantation seemingly reached its limit.He recited the phrases that took 2 minutes to complete in 4 seconds.He cast the magic while clutching his chest.BOOOOM!A huge whirlwind with a mixture of dirt and dust soared through the sky.\u201cAAAHH!\u201dThe loud shouts of children from the lower classes were heard, and a strong wind swept past their seats.By the time the dust disappeared, Samuel had a peaceful expression with a soft smile on his face.After the tinnitus disappeared from the ears of the students, Samuel explained calmly.\u201cThat, everyone, was the basis of Incantation magic. It\u2019s called Supersonic magic.\u201d\u201cIt is an indispensable skill in battle. Of course, it\u2019s not just about speaking fast. It may have been simply a noise to you, but I ruminated over and over the full meaning of the phrases. I think the power of the whirlwind that every one of you has seen serves as proof of that.\u201dAs they were still in a daze, nobody replied back, but everyone agreed with Samuel\u2019s words.It was the same for Shirone.\u2018The Power of Incantation\u2026\u2019\u2018The last whirlwind that was 10 times more powerful than the first.\u2019\u2018Is this the level of the Advanced Class?\u2019Not to mention, he was the teaching assistant that Ethella chose, so he must have been in the top ranks in the Advanced class.But regardless, he was still a student.The thought that Amy was competing with such people made him nervous, but at the same time, something hot flared inside him.\u2018I'll definitely reach that position.\u2019The other students seem to have felt the same way because their eyes looked slightly different from before.This was the exact reason why Ethella called a teaching assistant.\u201cGood work, Samuel. The students should have picked up a few things. Thank you for following through despite the difficult request.\u201d\u201cNot at all, Ms. Ethella. Just call me up anytime, I\u2019ll be happy to help.\u201dCompared to the comfortable way the Intermediate class acted around Ethella, Samuel bowed his head politely.\u2018That is the kind of world for mages.\u2019Shirone realized anew who he was taking lessons from.Once Samuel eventually graduated, he would be a non-certified Grade 10 mage. However, the instructor in front of him was a Grade 6 mage, and a state-certified one at that.\u2018How strong is she, our teacher?\u2019The other students must have registered this fact as well, as even after Samuel left, they were filled with reverence.\u201cOkay, everyone. Did you enjoy the demonstration of Incantation magic?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHearing the louder-than-usual reply, Ethella nodded, satisfied.\u201cThe reason why I decided to show you Incantation magic is because it\u2019s closely related to the strengthening of your Spirit Zone that you will learn about today. Now, do you think you can answer this question? What is the best way to strengthen your thoughts?\u201dThe students responded unanimously.\u201cThrough words!\u201d\u201cCorrect. Because thoughts are made up of words. So in other words, what does this mean?\u201dClass 4 was the one who answered.\u201cYou can materialize your thoughts.\u201d\u201cYes, exactly that. Whatever you think, you can see it with your own eyes. Now, close your eyes and try. See if you can see your thoughts.\u201dThe students who actually tried realized what it felt like to see their thoughts.\u201cIf you can see it with your eyes, it means it\u2019s real. That\u2019s the main point of Incantation. Incantation mages materialize the words they speak.\u201dEthella raised her index finger and explained.\u201cThe basic system of Incantation magic is simple. Speak and ruminate. Speak and ruminate. They continue to amplify the meaning of the words this way and strengthen the magic.\u201dA student from Class 7 asked.\u201cMs. Ethella, then can we learn Incantation, too?\u201dEthella smiled.\u201cWould you like to?\u201d\u201cYes. That older brother just now was really cool.\u201d\u201cRight. Choosing a major is important. But unfortunately, since Incantation magic is a major, it will not be covered in Intermediate class.\u201d\u201cThen how do we strengthen our Spirit Zone? Weren\u2019t we gonna do it through Incantation?\u201d\u201cAnd that is what I will explain starting now. Incantation is used to increase the power of certain magic. There are countless kinds of magic in the world, and there are also different languages to express that magic. However, the Spirit Zone purely operates through mentality, so there\u2019s no need for you to learn linguistic or supersonic techniques.\u201dEthella paused for a moment and entered the Image Zone.\u201cIn order to strengthen your Spirit Zone, a unique concentration method called the Sequence method is required. Raise your hand if you have ever counted from 1 to 100 either in your head or through your mouth.\u201dMost of the students raised their hands.\u201cGood. How about 1 through 1,000?\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]* * *Those who lowered their hands looked around.All of the Class 4 students raised their hands, but only a few from the lower-level classes were seen.\u201cThe Sequence method is literally a technique that expands numbers. Contrary to language, numbers are symbols in the state of axiom. So it meshes well with the Spirit Zone.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that counting increases concentration?\u201d\u201cThat is correct. Of course, you can\u2019t simply count numbers. That won\u2019t do anything. Essentially, it\u2019s the same as Incantation. Speak and ruminate. However, In the case of the Sequence method, you have to\u00a0think\u00a0and ruminate. The Sequence method will not work unless you focus on each and every number individually.\u201dExcept for the fact that language was replaced with numbers, it had a similar mechanism to Incantation magic.\u2018So that\u2019s why we were shown a demonstration first.\u2019Ethella\u2019s explanation continued.\u201cThe faster the number expands, the stronger the Spirit Zone becomes. In other words, all parts such as the probability of a magic being activated and its precision are increased. However, you do have to keep a few things in mind. The Sequence method is not omnipotent. The Spirit Zone can only really be enhanced through rigorous mental discipline. So in the future, don\u2019t rely too much on technical enhancements. That being said, I will now demonstrate the Sequence method myself.\u201dAfter the explanation, Ethella spread out her Spirit Zone but limited it to a diameter of about 10 meters for her demonstration.\u201cI will now perform the Sequence method. I will strengthen the currently visible Spirit Zone with only the Sequence method. Since this is not an Incantation, I will tell you the expansion of numbers in units and multiples of 10. Let\u2019s begin. One.\u201dAs soon as Ethella spoke the number, the Spirit Zone visibly grew.\u201c100.\u201d\u201c100? Did she just say 100?\u201dLike Incantation, one needed to accurately perceive and recognize each number in order for the Sequence method to be effective.Even so, counting to 100 in one second meant that the speed of her number expansion was insanely high.\u201c400.\u201dThe students\u2019 eyes grew to the size of saucers.Suddenly, Ethella started to accelerate for it took her less and less time to pass an interval.\u201c1,000. 1,700. 2,400.\u201dShirone was absolutely stupefied.\u2018No way.\u2019How could a human being count that fast?It did not even pass 10 seconds, but Ethella technically added 1+1 2,400 times while also ruminating on it.As a result, the size of her Spirit Zone swelled into a sphere with a diameter of 30 meters.It was only strengthened using the Sequence method.When the sequence reached 10,000, the Spirit Zone gradually got smaller in size.\u201cHuuu\u2026\u201dHer concentration which allowed her to count to 10,000 in one breath proved that she was worthy of her position as the youngest bishop of the Karsis Order.\u2018She\u2019s really amazing. How much do you have to train your mind to reach that level?\u2019The students were shocked. Even Ethella\u2019s appearance seemed dim when compared to her abilities.\u201cDid you see? Depending on how quickly you perform the Sequence, the range of its enhancement increases. Since it is only a technique, if the Spirit Zone itself is insufficiently practiced, the method will also be inefficient. However, I think everyone here can use it effectively depending on the situation.Shirone shouted Eureka.\u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019Shirone found the easiest way for him to use active magic despite his convergent and defensive tendencies.\u2018To strengthen the Spirit Zone using the Sequence method.\u2019Ethella gave advice.\u201cThe basis of the Sequence method puts 1 to 1,000 as the standard. Until you get used to it, focus on shortening your reach to 1,000.\u201dAfter the class was over, the students scattered and started immersing themselves in the Sequence technique.After expanding the Sequence from 1 to 1,000, Shirone immediately checked his measured time.\u2018Took me 48 seconds.\u2019It was an okay result considering it was his first try.Most of all, the best part was that he finished counting up to 1,000 without stopping once.In fact, it was normal for first-timers to lose concentration halfway through.\u2018I have no problem with counting itself. Shall I expand the Sequence further\u2026? No, teacher told us to focus on shortening the time it takes us to reach 1,000.\u2019Judging from Ethella\u2019s personality, she must\u2019ve determined that her previous demonstration was enough for her current class.\u2018The 10,000 mark was just a model. An example. That must mean there\u2019s a much higher level than that. Is it really possible through just counting numbers? If there is an actual special way\u2026\u2019At that moment, a possibility came to Shirone\u2019s mind.The time fragmentation effect that he experienced while crossing the Bridge That Could Not Be Crossed.\u2018Insight. Just as you can count the number of leaves, you can count numbers, but also feel them at the same time. I can group individual numbers into units and process them at once.\u2019Shirone did not know this, but what he thought of at that moment was the Concept of Modularity, which was the basic principle of Information magic.Shirone immediately started putting it into practice.\u2018Set the module unit to 10, and process the 10 pieces of information contained in that number in an integrated way\u2026\u2019\u201810. 20. 30\u2026\u2026\u2019As he moved forward, savoring the gaps between the numbers using insight, he began to gain momentum.\u20181,000!\u2019Shirone had arrived at 1,000 much faster speed than before.Shirone switched his Spirit Zone into Attack Form.\u2018Photon Output!\u2019A strong feeling of something leaving was felt, and a ray of light shot straight towards the forest and stretched far.\u201cWhoa! What is that?!\u201dStrictly speaking, he shot a sphere of light, but in people\u2019s eyes, it looked like a ray of light.Shirone clenched his fist.\u2018Yes! I did it!\u2019His classmates talked about it amongst themselves.\u201cIt's a Photon Output. Is he preparing for the targeting exam?\u201d\u201cBut why go out of his way to learn that? Isn\u2019t it a particularly useless magic? Though maybe he\u2019s learning it to set foundations for Information magic?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter because the target in the Image Zone activates upon any kind of magic. It is also said that it can be removed by recovery magic. Besides, it may be advantageous for the exam. That\u2019s honestly super fast, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe students nodded.It was safe to say it had no power, but it was ideal for hitting fast-moving targets.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45Despite the commotion, Ethella turned her head.As the students watched, flashes of light continued to shoot from Shirone\u2019s hand.\u2018Active magic.\u2019That meant that he had successfully strengthened his Spirit Zone.Ethella approached Shirone.\u201cShirone, I see that you\u2019ve prepared well.\u201d\u201cThank you. But in fact, this is the first time I\u2019ve succeeded.\u201d\u201cThe sequence method seems to have worked. Would you like to try it again? I\u2019ll watch.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAs Shirone cast photon output. Ethella touched her lips and fell into thought.\u2018Hmm.\u2019It was not simply the Sequence.\u2018He exceeded the level that can be strengthened with basic skills. Did he combine the modularization from the information department?\u2019Whether he did it while knowing or discovered it by accident, with Shirone\u2019s insight, either was possible.Organizing her thoughts, she made a suggestion.\u201cShirone, you haven\u2019t tried hitting a target yet, have you? Would you like to try out the Image Zone?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe students stopped what they were doing and gathered around to watch Shirone.\u201cHow effective will photon output be?\u201d\u201cNot sure. It\u2019s one of the fastest magics out there, but the accuracy of it depends on the mage.\u201dAfter checking the safety device, Ethella spoke.\u201cYou may begin.\u201dShirone nodded and flicked his finger.The target jumped up and flew around quickly.The thorns of the Attack form pierced out in all directions, and one of them caught the target.\u2018Photon output.\u2019The magic was cast without delay. A flash of light sped toward the target and turned it into ashes.\u201cWow.\u201dThe students were awed.While it may not actually be effective in real combat, the flashy lights overwhelmed the viewers.\u2018Not bad.\u2019The targets turned to ashes left and right as Shirone fired a series of flashes.Shirone\u2019s performance really emphasized the advantage of photon output in regards to the Speed Gun Test.\u2018Yes! I can do it with this!\u201dThe Sequence method already exceeded 1,500, and the count on the display board continued to rise.Currently, Shirone had eliminated 172 targets.Shirone had 20 seconds left. He could easily break through to 200 points, and with time to spare.\u2018As expected, he\u2019s using modularity.\u2019Ethella was finally certain.The realization he had when he crossed the Bridge That Could Not Be Crossed continued to help him with the current exam.\u2018I was worried for nothing.\u2019She originally thought it would be better to strengthen Shirone\u2019s Spirit Zone through mental training rather than technical training because of his disposition.\u2018Surprisingly, there is quite a belligerent side to him.\u2019His desire to obtain victory seemed to have spurred his thinking to become stronger and more fierce.A minute passed, and when the targeting program ended, Shirone let out one big breath.The final total was 342 points, which was recorded on the electronic signboard. All gazes were pointed there.\u201c342 in one minute. But how did he not miss one? Should I just switch to photon output instead?\u201d\u201cDoes that look easy to you? Shirone mastered teleportation. That\u2019s why he\u2019s at that level.\u201dMeanwhile, away from the group of students, Nade and Yiruki sat side by side and shared their opinions.\u201cAs expected of Shirone. Even though he specializes in defense, he is also good at offense, too.\u201dAs opposed to Nade, Yiruki was negative.\u201cI don\u2019t know. 342 points isn\u2019t all that great.\u201d\u201cStill, it\u2019s a great score for his first time. Up until yesterday, he didn\u2019t even know how to output photons.\u201d\u201cThe number is not of importance. There\u2019s a separate ability to grasp the main point. To have that kind of ability, that is what\u2019s actually great.\u201dNade was surprised.\u201cOh, what a surprise. For you to praise Shirone of all people.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just acknowledging what should be acknowledged. Anyways, it\u2019ll be a good experiment anyway. We will get to see who is higher up in this practical evaluation.\u201d\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201dInstead of answering, Yiruki headed to the Image Zone.\u201cMs. Ethella, I would like to do it too.\u201d\u201cYiruki, you?\u201dEthella looked uneasy.\u2018There was that last incident as well\u2026\u2019With Yiruki\u2019s personality, Ethella didn\u2019t know what would happen if she were to allow him to demonstrate recklessly.\u201cI\u2019ll just do a quick warm-up and come down. The safety device is on anyway.\u201dEthella was forced to say yes.It was not fair to restrict a student who was eager to prepare for the exam.\u201cAll right. But keep in mind, don\u2019t make a scene.\u201d\u201cLeave it to me.\u201dWith Yiruki\u2019s appearance, the students\u2019 attention focused on him, and so did Shirone\u2019s.Honestly, he was curious.\u2018Is the Savant Syndrome effective on the Sequence method?\u2019He may be able to do complicated calculations, but counting numbers quickly was a whole different matter.While everyone had the same question, Yiruki cast the Deviate form of the Four Way Formation.\u201cEh? Is he using the Deviate form this time as well?\u201dThe smallest and most agile form out of the Four forms of the Four Way Formation, but due to that, there was little room to rely on synesthesia.\u201cTell me about it. I mean, we\u2019re going to hit them using our naked eyes, so wouldn\u2019t it be better to use the Attack form?\u201dContrary to the skepticism, Yiruki actually reduced his Spirit Zone even smaller. He did so in order to speed things up. When the signal flared, the 60-second countdown was seen along with targets soaring in the air.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]* * *Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!The Spirit Zone, which was reduced to 20 centimeters in diameter, moved as fast as a whip and hit the targets.\u201cWoah!\u201dSeeing the quick and accurate targeting, not only were the students surprised, but also Ethella.\u2018To use the Deviate form. It\u2019s a pretty unique approach.\u201dThe count exceeded 100 points.Since Shirone went through the same procedure, he was able to gauge Yiruki\u2019s skill.\u2018I see.\u2019If the photon output offset the distance, the Deviate form was also activated immediately.\u2018The downside is that you have to discern the target with your naked eyes. But Yiruki\u2026\u2019Did not need high dynamic visual acuity. With the help of the Savant Syndrome, he predicted where the targets would be in advance.Yiruki was smiling.\u2018You can\u2019t be surprised already, Shirone.\u2019In the next moment, his Spirit Zone began to move at a speed that the eyes could not follow.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe faces of the students were stained with astonishment. The sound of exploding targets could be heard from all directions.POWPOWPOWPOWPOW!Since the power of the Atomic bomb was minimized, it took little to no time for it to detonate.When the count reached 200 points, Shirone could tell what was going to happen without having to see the final results.\u2018The score will be higher than mine.\u2019Shirone was not bothered by it, but he was curious as to how Yiruki was strengthening his Spirit Zone.\u201cPerhaps modularization?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dNade said.Although he was often caught in between the arguments of the two, he wasn\u2019t the type to hate pure competition.\u201cYiruki wants to beat you through his own method. Yiruki is not counting in the thousands.\u201d\u201cNot in thousands? Then?\u201d\u201cA million.\u201dShirone\u2019s mind went blank. Was it possible to count to one million in a minute?One minute passed by in an instant, and Yiruki came down after using up that minute to its fullest.The final score was 548 points.It was a score that far exceeded what Shirone had gotten.\u201cThat\u2019s insane.\u201dSeeing Yiruki, who was seriously engaged in class for the first time, made the students murmur amongst themselves.\u201c548 points using the Deviate form? Is he really human?\u201d\u201cHe calculated the equations of motion for all the targets using his savant ability. Honestly, isn\u2019t that cheating?\u201dEthella was puzzled.\u2018Hitting the target using the Deviate form is the result of coordinating between mathematical calculation and the usage of his Savant Syndrome. However\u2026\u2019That alone did not explain how his Spirit Zone moved much faster than the targets.\u2018How did he strengthen it?\u2019Her eyes twinkled as she pondered.\u2018No way? That child\u2026?\u201dYiruki, who came down from the Image Zone, approached Shirone while looking at him inquisitively.\u201cHow was it? Worth watching, wasn\u2019t it?\u201dShirone admitted honestly.\u201cYeah, that was amazing. I never thought you could use the Deviate form in the way you just did.\u201d\u201cHmm, that\u2019s it? Well, that\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dShirone frowned, but Yiruki couldn\u2019t care less and continued to talk.\u201cTo modularize numbers to speed up. I guess it was a method that utilized your strength.\u201dShirone winced.\u201cWant me to teach you how I strengthened it?\u201d\u201cAre you allowed to tell me so carelessly? Even though you seem to want to keep me in check?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care. It\u2019s not something you can just do by knowing.\u201dAs expected, Yiruki was skilled in getting under people\u2019s skin.\u201cActually, it\u2019s nothing big or amazing. While you speed up by expanding your units using modularization, I speed up by reducing the units through algebra.\u201d\u201cHuh? Algebra?\u201dShirone\u2019s mouth gaped.\u2018Such a way exists\u2026? No, he\u2019s right, what he performed was just algebra\u2026 Albeit really quickly.\u2019Yiruki wasn\u2019t lying when he said that knowing how to use the method did not equal to being able to use it.\u201cWith logarithms, even astronomical numbers can be expressed in a simple way. This time, I just tried it out for practice. After all, the real competition is the practical evaluation.\u201dShirone chewed on his lips.\u2018Through the power of log, one could feel the numbers intuitively, no matter how big\u2026\u2019\u2018I\u2019m guessing even ten billion wouldn\u2019t make him sweat. After all, logarithm was created to easily calculate and express difficult expressions.\u2019Therefore, if it was applied to a simple number play like the Sequence method, the whole operation would become extremely complicated.\u2018But he did it. He developed his own Sequence method using the Savant Syndrome.\u2019What was Yiruki\u2019s limit?Amy Karmis, the members of the House of Ogent. Shirone had met many geniuses in his life, but it was his first time coming across someone with an extremely tilted pendulum of talent like Yiruki.\u201cWhat do you think? You still think you can beat me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying hard to beat anyone. If they try their best, it doesn\u2019t matter who wins.\u201d\u201cWhat a classic answer. Alright, we\u2019ll see when the time comes. Maybe I was wrong, maybe you aren\u2019t that guy. Maybe you never were to begin with. But next time, watch what you say. It\u2019s unpleasant to hear an idealist with no skills say what life is all about.\u201dShirone gritted his teeth\u2018What in the world is wrong with him?\u2019He just wanted to say that everyone\u2019s life was precious. But if even that was Idealism, at least according to Yiruki, then Shirone had no choice but to show him he was worthy of saying such things.\u201cFine! If you think that way, then let\u2019s compete. I will beat you for sure on this exam.\u201d\u201cHaha! Now you\u2019re talking. Though, the winner will still be me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026!\u201dThe moment Shirone was about to go at him again, their classmates gathered around Yiruki.\u201cYou were amazing! How did you do it? Can you teach me, too?\u201d\u201cYou had such a skill all along! Why did you hide it? Why don\u2019t you join our research group? We might be able to finish our project within a month if you were to join.\u201dCompliments rained down, but not once did Yiruki\u2019s expression change. Instead, he turned to Shirone.\u201cShirone, the insight you showed during the Bridge That Cannot Be Crossed was a sight to see. However\u2026\u201dHe gave an ominous smirk and turned away on his heel.\u201cMy calculation is faster than your insight.\u201dShirone gulped.He had faced lots of competition ever since he entered the magic academy, but it was his first time against such a powerful opponent.Nade patted Shirone on the back.\u201cCheer up. While this might sound bad, as a spectator, I can\u2019t help but find this competition exciting. Of course, I don\u2019t care who wins since you guys are both my friends.\u201d\u201cCompetition is what I want, too. But not this kind of competition. Yiruki just flat out hates me.\u201d\u201cWhat can we do? That\u2019s the guy he is. But not just him. To make him go all out like that, you bastard? You\u2019re something yourself too. You two are probably the only ones who have the potential to break the highest targeting record.\u201d\u201cHuh? What\u2019s the score?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see. From what I know, it should be 987?\u201d\u201cWhat? 987?\u201dShirone was astonished.Aside from his score, even Yiruki, who used log, scored only 500 points.How fast did one have to be to earn a score of 987?\u201cThat\u2019s incredible. Who is it? They must have graduated already, right?\u201d\u201cEh? What are you talking about? How do you have no clue even though you guys are dating? The person who scored the highest was Amy.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46\u201cA-Amy\u2026?\u201dDespite knowing that the Target form was her specialty and that it gave her an advantage during the exam, Shirone felt that the score of 987 points was out of this world.Nade recalled and spoke.\u201cYou might not know, but during exams, our senior focuses so hard to the point she seems like a different person. It\u2019s no wonder she never lost her place as the rank 1 prior to entering the Advanced class. I mean, you\u2019re also not much different in that sense.\u201dShirone realized once again.\u2018How many people of talent live in this world?\u2019But on the other hand, it gave him courage.\u2018That\u2019s right, there\u2019s nothing that is absolute in this world. Like how Amy won using her own method, I will also win using my own method.\u2019Nade advised.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to break the highest record, so relax. Before the record-breaking 987 score, I heard that the highest score was somewhere in the late 700s. Our senior achieved her highest record when she was in Class 4, not 5, so even more reason to take it easy.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dShirone thought.\u2018Then let\u2019s make my primary goal 700 points.\u20193 weeks were left before D-day. Shirone had to think of a way to raise his score in that short period of time.\u2018I won\u2019t lose. Not in a million years.\u2019Shirone clenched his fists.* * *The only thing clouding his thoughts was the Sequence method.He had to count faster than Yiruki, but he couldn\u2019t come up with a number.\u2018Damn it. How should I execute this exactly?\u2019No matter how much he increased the set numbers using modularity, it was shabby compared to the unit compressive force of log.\u201cFirst, let\u2019s train.\u201dAt night, Shirone practiced Photon Output.The speed at which the Sequence method reached the last number was much faster, but even so, he could only count to 10,000 in one minute.\u2018Yiruki reached one million on the first day. I may have the upper hand in terms of stamina, but Yiruki is superior in terms of the speed at which he strengthens his Spirit Zone. If I do nothing about the gap between us, winning will not be possible.\u2019There was the exam he had to think about as well.If there were an unlimited number of targets, achieving 1,000 points wouldn't be too difficult, but there was a unique pattern.\u2018At level 1, 10 targets appear. You have to take them all out in order to move on to level 2. Moreover, with each increase in level, there\u2019s an additional target that gets added.\u2019At level 10, nineteen targets appeared all at once.Therefore, if one were to start off slow from the beginning and take too much time, one wouldn\u2019t be able to earn a high score.\u2018If I miss a target even once, the delay could prove fatal. After all, the name of the game is Speed Gun.\u2019* * *Shirone finished training around midnight.Currently, Shirone\u2019s daily routine looked something like this:He would go to his dorm, sleep like the dead, wake up to take classes, train until midnight, and then repeat the process all over again.Other students either shared tips and tricks with each other or practiced the Sequence method while waiting in line for the Image Zone.When it was his turn, Shirone poured out everything he learned and trained without restraint.Every time the thorns of the Attack Form made contact with a target, the beam of the Photon Output pierced the air.The students gave him their full attention.\u201cIt\u2019s getting faster and faster.\u201dAs Shirone continued to get used to active magic, eventually, he was able to hit the mark without even turning his body.A minute passed by in a blur for the students who watched the light show.The final score was 567 points.Shirone regained his confidence seeing as his score was higher than what Yiruki had gotten previously.\u2018Good. It\u2019s faster than before.\u2019\u2026Though, his performance lowered the self-esteem of his classmates.\u201cOver 200 points more than his last score! And all this In the span of a week?! What the hell is this?! It\u2019s an absolute violation of equity!\u201d\u201cThe speed of those light bullets are too fast. Once a target is sighted, it never misses, so leveling up is a piece of cake. Moreso, his linking has improved. He seems to be casting more than 4 times per second.\u201d\u201cSeeing Shirone\u2019s performance has gotten me fired up!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do this!\u201dAnd so, the students eagerly awaited their turn in the Image Zone.* * *\u201cI guess it\u2019s my turn now?\u201dSince it was almost the end of the class, the line for the Image Zone dwindled, and as such, the aloof-looking Yiruki made his appearance.Until now, he wasn\u2019t even practicing and was relaxing under the shade of a tree.The corner of his mouth curved up and Shirone watched him activate the targeting program.As soon as Yiruki released his Spirit Zone, he immediately switched to the Deviate Form. And this time, it was smaller than before.Sounds of awe erupted from all around.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dShirone\u2019s light was flashy, but Yiruki\u2019s demonstration of speed excited the spectators as well.\u201cDone.\u201dAfter one minute was up, Yiruki didn\u2019t even look back to check his score as he walked away with hands clasped behind his back.His final score was 568 points.A single point ahead of Shirone\u2019s.\u2018\u2026That was not a coincidence.\u2019Even after this incident, Shirone\u2019s skills continued to improve, but Yiruki was always ahead by a single point.The intention was clear.\u201cYiruki wins once again. As expected, I don\u2019t think Shirone can do it.\u201dIt was Yiruki\u2019s strategy to drive Shirone into a corner. He wanted to make him despair. He wanted to make him feel like no matter how hard he tried, there was no way he'd win.\u2018I won\u2019t give up, no matter what!\u2019Despite Yiruki constantly one-upping him, Shirone continued to devote himself to the Sequence method.As Shirone broke through and exceeded the multiples of 100, the performance of his Spirit Zone increased exponentially.In his last practice before the exam, Shirone surpassed 700 points, a score difficult to achieve.Students cheered for him.\u201cI can\u2019t believe the score I\u2019m seeing right now. It really IS possible to earn such a score.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t pass level 10 in approximately 10 seconds, it\u2019s impossible to get to the 700 mark. If so, how many do you have to knock down in a second?\u201dShirone made a fist.\u2018I did it. I earned 70 more points compared to my last real practice. I\u2019ve reached the primary goal I set.\u2019With the exam day right ahead of him, Shirone\u2019s concentration only increased.Shirone came down the stairs while hiding his excitement. At the same time, Yiruki walked past him and said.\u201cCongrats. 700 is definitely an impressive score. Your growth rate is fast, almost to the point it\u2019s scary.\u201d\u201cCause I don\u2019t want to lose to you.\u201d\u201cKekeke, I see. But you shouldn\u2019t let your guard down. The exam hasn\u2019t even started yet.\u201dBy the time Shirone reached the bottom of the stairs and turned around, Yiruki was already practicing for the Speed gun.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]* * *The students\u2019 eyes widened.\u201cWow! It must take some serious skills to make the Spirit Zone that small.\u201dThe Deviate form was almost the size of a marble, and it was so fast that not even an afterimage was apparent.BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!With Yiruki in the center, it looked like the explosions were just happening on their own.BAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!\u2026And just like that, a minute passed.Silence.701.He beat the score Shirone tried so hard to reach by one point yet again.The students shouted.\u201cAmazing! Yiruki still has the upper hand!\u201dThey were looking forward to the competition between Shirone and Yiruki.One genius vs. another genius.So far, Yiruki was winning.\u2018Again with that one point difference?\u2019For once, Shirone broke into a cold sweat.If Yiruki had won using all his might, Shirone wouldn\u2019t have been so nervous.\u2018I don\u2019t know. What\u2019s the highest point Yiruki can score?\u2019The evaluation period started next week.Class 5 had the busiest schedule, so even with the weekends included, he only had three days left.\u2018I need to find a way.\u2019Shirone left the training ground with an anxious heart.* * *Central park, which was usually packed with students during the holidays, was empty due to the pressure of the exams.On a quiet street where most shops were closed, Sharelle headed towards the fountain.\u2018Am I too early?\u2019She was excluded from the Intermediate class evaluation because she had submitted the Advanced Class promotion application the day before yesterday.Arriving at the fountain, a red-headed girl was sitting on a bench reading a book.Sharelle\u2019s face brightened.\u201cAmy!\u201dAmy, who had a haggard expression, heard her and closed the book she was reading and stood up.\u201cWow, you\u2019re so thin. The Advanced Class must be hard.\u201dAmy had become much thinner and was evidently lacking sleep as her face was pale. There were even not-so-concealed dark circles under her eyes.\u201cSoon, we\u2019ll look like twins. Anyways, welcome to hell. Here, are the files you asked for.\u201dAmy passed over the files related to the Advanced Class promotion.It wasn\u2019t considered an expedient means because what she handed was information all Advanced students had access to.\u201cThanks. Let\u2019s sit down first. Wanna drink something?\u201d\u201cCoffee. Coffee is the only reason I\u2019m alive and awake.\u201dThey each bought a cup of coffee from an empty cafe and returned to the park.They sat down on a bench.Sharelle asked a question after looking through the files.\u201cHow is it? Is the promotion exam very difficult?\u201d\u201cHmm, should I say it\u2019s hard? The level is high, that\u2019s for sure. However, it doesn't use the system where your score determines whether you fail or pass. Instead, it\u2019s like checking what you can do\u2026 Kind of? That\u2019s why cramming is out of the picture. It won\u2019t help. Essentially, they examine the standard at which you can operate.\u201d\u201cYeah? That makes me more nervous.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Being at the top of Class 4 definitely means you\u2019re at the Advanced class level. The problem is what comes after.\u201d\u201cThe after\u2026\u201dSharelle, who was deep in thought, turned her head to look at Amy. She saw her looking up at the sky.\u2018She\u2019s changed.\u2019Although her appearance was downright bad, Sharelle could feel a distinctive aura unique to those from the Advanced Class.\u2018The mental, physical, and technical parts of her all seem to have become stronger. I should get promoted quickly.\u2019Amy, who was sucking on an empty cup of iced coffee, opened her mouth.\u201cHow\u2019s Shirone these days?\u201d\u201cHoho! I thought you\u2019d never ask. You guys seriously haven\u2019t met up once? Haven\u2019t you heard the rumors?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have the time, and both of our classes are strictly divided anyway. Though I did hear that Samuel visited as a teaching assistant. In any case, what are those rumors you mentioned?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something fun happening in Class 5.\u201d\u201cSomething fun?\u201dAs Amy faced her with the straw still in her mouth, Sharelle did what she did best. Blabber away.The main point was that Shirone and Yiruki were having a showdown, with the Speed Gun exam as the backdrop.\u201c\u2026Reducing the units through log. That\u2019s quite fresh. Very Yiruki-like.\u201dSharelle was surprised.\u201cEh? You know Yiruki?\u201d\u201cOf course. We were classmates. Of course, I got promoted early, so we weren\u2019t close. But he\u2019s that guy, the one with Savant Syndrome, right?\u201d\u201cHo? You do really know him. Have you talked? He doesn\u2019t seem very friendly.\u201d\u201cYeah, I did. When I freshly entered Class 5, he was the one who started the conversation.\u201d\u201cWhat? Does he perhaps like you? Oh my god. Then it\u2019s a battle between two love rivals.\u201cKeep talking. He\u2019s a bit weird, you know? He talks like he\u2019s dried up and numb from any sort of emotion. I think that whatever he\u2019s doing to Shirone right now, he was gonna do to me. After all, he immediately picked a fight with me. Though I couldn\u2019t be bothered, so after I stopped paying any attention to him, his interest towards me naturally dwindled.\u201d\u201cHmm, in other words, he is a genius hunter. What do we do? Shirone was unlucky to get caught.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s to that extent. It\u2019s a barrier he has to cross either way. Doesn\u2019t matter if it's now or in the near future. But I agree, he will have quite a difficult time. Using log in Speed Gun will get Yiruki a pretty high score.\u201dSharelle glowered a bit.\u201cHow can you say that? Your boyfriend is standing at the edge of a cliff and needs some cheering up. What if Shirone loses?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just an exam. They aren\u2019t fighting. Losing is an inevitability, no need to go nuts\u2026\u201dAmy seemed unimpressed.Since everyone in the Advanced Class were stars, it did not matter who won or lost, but\u2026Sharelle was still disappointed.\u201cYou\u2019ve never lost before! So say something that\u2019ll cheer Shirone up! I\u2019ll personally deliver your message.\u201d\u201cNo need. You\u2019ll probably exaggerate whatever I say anyways. Plus, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a promotion exam or anything of great importance this time. It\u2019s a practical evaluation, for heaven\u2019s sake. Shirone is someone who\u2019s aiming to join the Advanced Class. It\u2019ll be a good experience for him.\u201d\u201cThen maybe share the secret to getting a high score in Speed Gun. You're the record holder, after all.\u201d\u201cAdvice, you say? There\u2019s no advice I can give Shirone as he probably already knows what he needs to do. I\u2019m not like this because I\u2019m uninterested, it\u2019s because Shirone\u2019s really talented. You said he achieved 700 points. I only reached that high score because I specialize in the Target Form.\u201dThe one person who wished the two the best more than anyone else was heartbroken.\u201cThen what? Shirone still has a chance of winning, right? He has to win.\u201dAmy just nodded her head back and forth with the straw still in her mouth.\u2018Yiruki Mercodine.\u2019Though she disliked his first impression, he was a formidable opponent.\u201cIt is quite tricky if we were to only look at his targeting. That\u2019s why the Savant Syndrome is such a strong weapon. With the addition of logs, he is close to being a firm, resistant wall. In fact, he\u2019s nearly an unbreakable one. And not only that, you said he\u2019s serious this time around. If we competed in the Speed Gun test back when I was in Class 5, and if he was seriously determined to win\u2026\u201d\u201cWh-What?\u201dAmy, who was debating on the result, bore a frown and said.\u201cI would've probably lost.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dAmy never gave up her seat as the rank #1 in the Intermediate class, so Sharelle couldn\u2019t help but be shocked.Considering she was already in the Advanced Class, she may have been generous with her claim as everything was in the past, but it was still a pretty big statement nonetheless.Sharelle looked like she was about to cry.\u201cWh-What\u2026? So what about our Shiro?\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47With the practical evaluation one day away, Shirone meditated in his dorm room.\u2018I did everything I could.\u2019He didn\u2019t have the time to devise a new special method for doing so would only hamper his ability to perform.So instead, he explored the essence of the Sequence method.\u2018What is the Sequence method?\u2019Starting with the question that marked the beginning of everything\u2026\u2018Why is it the Sequence method\u2026?\u2019\u2018How is the Sequence method\u2026?\u2019He pondered nonstop.Shirone, who thought of so many questions it could fill up a field, closed his eyes.\u2018Don\u2019t think\u2026 Feel.\u2019Just like that, Shirone embarked on a journey in which he built up his knowledge of the Sequence method from the base while increasing his knowledge one step at a time.He has no set goal or limit in regards to how long and how far he should count.\u2018I feel unrestrained. There is no incorrect path.\u2019How long had he been at it?When he reached a point most humans never set foot in, Shirone had a sudden thought.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dWhen he reopened his eyes, the sun was there.24 hours had gone by, and yet Shirone didn\u2019t even feel an ounce of fatigue.However, a holy light that could not be described by any human emotions or words was fluttering in his eyes.With a sorrowful expression, he asked in the direction of the ceiling.\u201cIs that so?\u201dNo one replied back, but Shirone felt like he had already received a response.* * *There was still an hour left before the practical evaluation, but the training ground was swarming with participants.The academy also paid great attention to this exam\u2019s preparation.The safety device was strengthened, and scoreboards to keep track of the scores were placed all over the place.Although today was for the Speed Gun exam, Class 7 and 6 attended without exception. They were hoping to impress their upperclassmen.On the other hand, most of Class 4 were not present.Only a few who took interest in Shirone and Yiruki\u2019s contest bothered to take the time to watch.Of course, if someone had to name a person most recognized among them, it would be Sharelle, a prospective Advanced Class student.Mark being Mark, ran up to her and said his hellos.\u201cSenior! Hello!\u201d\u201cHey. All the lowerclassmen seem to be present. Well, I used to be like that, too.\u201d\u201cThat hurts my feelings, senior. I\u2019m only here to cheer and celebrate senior Shirone\u2019s victory today!\u201d\u201cOh! Good! Very good! Then let us fire up and cheer like crazy!\u201dThe two were able to take the best seats available.Needless to say, wherever Sharelle passed by, the path always opened up by itself.As predicted, the students\u2019 interest was towards Shirone and Yiruki\u2019s Speed Gun competition.\u201cUp until now, Yiruki has always had the upper hand, but there's a variable nobody can control. The practical exam is done by two people at the same time.\u201dThe reason why the academy chose to go for a competition layout was to push the students to achieve higher scores.\u201cIt\u2019s similar to a race. If you have a competitor, you get a score higher than when you take it by yourself. But can that variable alone bridge the gap? Yiruki hasn\u2019t even tried his best yet.\u201d\u201cThat's why I find it dangerous. For me, the level of tension I feel during actual combat is different. If you set the difficulty of training too low, you may not reach your maximum potential in actual combat.\u201d\u201cEach of you, check your assigned group and wait for your turn. The exam will begin in 10 minutes.\u201dAs Ethella started talking, everyone went quiet.In order to maximize their potential, students were partnered with opponents of similar records.In addition, those with high records were placed on the second half of the exam. This was to ensure that those who were not as talented would not suffer any psychological blow before their turn to perform.As such, both Shirone and Yiruki were allocated under group 20.\u2018As expected.\u2019The 10 minutes came to an end, and two people from group 1 walked towards the Image Zone.\u201cIt\u2019s finally starting. I\u2019m nervous.\u201dThe Speed Gun was popular with the spectators due to its competitive nature.Perhaps the participants were aware of that as well, as even if they attained a new high score, they would return to their seats with an unsatisfied expression if they lost to their opponent.\u201cGood job. Next group, get ready.\u201dIt took about an hour to get through 10 groups and the highest score so far was 533.Nade earned a score of 491, which was considered to be slightly above class average.As the second half neared, the hearts of the spectators thumped faster, and their cheers got louder.They knew as well.\u2018Soon.\u2019The main event of the day was coming soon.\u201cNice job, group 19. Alright, the next group is the last\u2014\u201d\u201cWOOOOOO!\u201dEthella\u2019s voice got buried under the loud shouts.Contrary to the excited students, Shirone and Yiruki didn\u2019t even bother glancing at each other.They only stared straight ahead.Mark, who saw Shirone, spoke.\u201cWow, upperclassman Shirone sure looks psyched up! However, won\u2019t it be hard for him this time around? I heard upperclassman Yiruki say he was falling behind.\u201dSharelle made an unhappy grunt.\u201cShirone is stronger in actual combat. Even during that teleportation exam, if I remember correctly, a certain someone said something similar and paid the price for it, correct?\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 Right\u2026\u201dMark let out an empty laugh and gave his cheek a scratch.Shirone and Yiruki got into their place inside the Image Zone. Ethella went over the rules.\u201cYou have one minute. You begin as soon as the red light from the scoreboard flashes. The divisions are divided using Magic barriers, so work comfortably and feel free to think of it as an individual test. Also, a lot of your lowerclassmen are watching, so don\u2019t do anything embarrassing.\u201dAs if to save their energy, the two only nodded and moved away from each other.The cheers quieted down, and the lowerclassmen held their breaths and kept their eyes wide open so as not to miss a single movement.\u2018Both are holders of records over 700 points. They will start off strong in the beginning.\u2019Shirone stared at the scoreboard indifferently.Though his heart was beating slightly faster than normal, he was in a state where he couldn\u2019t feel any nervousness.Perfect concentration.\u201cWe will begin in\u2026\u201dWhen the preliminary light on the scoreboard turned on, Shirone counted in his head.\u20183\u2026 2\u2026 1\u2026\u2019The moment the red light flashed, Shirone began his onslaught.Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!Ten Photon outputs per second shot out in all directions, hitting the targets.Yiruki\u2019s Spirit Zone also moved like a bee, causing a train of explosions.\u201cBoth of them are so fast! As soon as they began, everything exploded!\u201dIn the midst of Mark\u2019s excited shouts, in level 2 and level 3, the targets disappeared as soon as they appeared.They were on equal grounds up to level 6, so Sharelle clenched her fist.\u201cNice! If Shirone keeps this up, he might actually win.\u201dThe two, who passed level 10 at about the same time, took a huge breath.\u2018The real battle starts now.\u2019The number of targets for level 11 was twenty.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]* * *They could not get rid of that many targets in a single breath, so the road up ahead would only become more complicated.The current score was 239 points vs. 237 points, with Shirone ahead by a narrow margin.As the level rose, the number of targets would also increase, so at this pace, they would definitely pass 700 points.\u2018Good! I\u2019m in my best condition. Even though Yiruki is trying his hardest, I\u2019m not getting pushed back.\u2019Even a single mistake was fatal. But thankfully, Shirone\u2019s Photon output never missed its mark.That was the same for Yiruki who was a savant.\u2018Oh, so you wanna play?\u2019The Spirit Zone of Yirruki, who was using the Sequence method of log, sped up.377 points vs. 377 points.At the 30-second mark when Yiruki caught up, Shirone accelerated his Sequence method.\u2018Faster\u2026 FASTER! \u2019Shirone was in his absolute best condition ever.As he continuously jumped over huge numbers, the world flashed left and right in a quick blink of an eye.The students shouted.\u201cShirone is in the lead again by 4 points!\u201dYiruki was slowly being driven to the edge.Unlike the practice rounds, he was actually putting in effort this time around.\u201cStill, I\u2019m being pushed back? My calculation speed?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t understand.Only three days ago, he was well ahead of the game. What kind of magic did Shirone conjure in that short period of time?Shirone seized his consciousness desperately.\u2018Release the limitations of modularization.\u2019If he had been dealing with multiples of 100 before, now, he was doing whatever random calculations came to mind\u2026 At least it seemed random. Shirone was relying on his intuition to give him numbers that would work.187, 293, 378, 423\u2026Shirone\u2019s concentration had reached an all-time high. He was on a tightrope where the Sequence method itself would collapse if even one number was not analyzed properly.469 points vs. 432 points.When Shirone suddenly propelled, all the students stood up and cried out.Even Ethella couldn\u2019t take her eyes off as she couldn\u2019t determine who would win either.Yiruki saw through Shirone\u2019s plan.\u2018He broke the arithmetic routine. A kind of mental doping, I should say. He is thinking of absolutely winning .\u2019The corner of his mouth tilted up.\u2018Do you know how long I\u2019ve waited for this?\u2019For an opponent who would put in everything they had.\u2018I\u2019ll face you, Shirone.\u2019To take on his first, legit rival, Yiruki chose to walk on a tightrope as well.\u2018My gambling is on a different level than yours.\u2019The change happened instantly, and the students noticed it too.\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on?!\u201d542 points vs. 558 points.Yiruki\u2019s newfound speed managed to catch up with Shirone\u2019s and not long after, completely surpass his.Mark questioned.\u201cSenior Sharelle, how did this happen? Did upperclassman Shirone perhaps make a mista\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, Shirone\u2019s speed is also increasing. It\u2019s just that Yiruki\u2019s is speeding up at a faster rate.\u201d\u201cBut he gained 100 points in a heartbeat! Is it possible to suddenly increase 2 folds like that?\u201dSharelle pursed her lips.It still didn\u2019t appear possible, but there was no other explanation.Also, if it was actually feasible, the current situation would be perfectly explainable.\u201cThat guy\u2026 He has two Spirit Zones.\u201dAs soon as Sharelle spoke those words, the lowerclassmen squinted their eyes to try and detect even a wisp of the 2nd alleged Spirit Zone.Although it was blurry, it seemed like there were two afterimages flying around at different angles.\u201cI-It\u2019s true!\u201dSharelle\u2019s expression turned dark.\u2018I knew he was outstanding, but really, a double Spirit Zone?\u2019Mental Partition, a unique characteristic of Deviant types.However, not every Deivate type could do it. Even if one were familiar with the Deivate form, only a chosen few could put this advanced skill into action.\u2018It\u2019s my first time seeing it. Currently, Yiruki is probably the only one who can do it in this entire academy, including the Advanced class. Above all, even though he split his mind into two\u2026\u2019His speed did not drop.\u2018He is carrying out two different Sequence methods at the same time. Is that even something a single human brain can do?\u2019Yiruki\u2019s performance proved that it was possible.\u2018To process everything with mental arithmetic\u2026 That is not a level that can be explained by the word \u2018talent\u2026 Yiruki is more like a mutant.\u2019The Savant Syndrome\u2019s true power could be seen through the scoreboard.692 points vs. 845 points.There was over a 100-point difference, and Yiruki was ahead in terms of level as well.\u201cIt\u2019s over. The winner will be decided here.\u201dWhile most students were thinking Yiruki had won already, Shirone did not give up.\u2018More. I have to tie up more numbers!\u2019The amount of numbers Shirone was processing using modularity was not at an average of 1,000 or more.732 points vs. 911 points.Shirone broke his personal highest score\u2026 But Yiruki was far ahead.It looked like he was going to break Amy\u2019s record.The students just sat there as if they had lost their souls.\u201cYiruki\u2026 He\u2019s out-of-this-world amazing. At this rate, he\u2019s going to write a new history for Class 5.\u201dMeanwhile, Shirone didn\u2019t stray away from his thoughts. There was only one thing on his mind.\u2018I can\u2019t reach it through arithmetic.\u2019He had to go beyond.\u2018Can I do it?\u2019Was this really an ability humans were allowed to use?There wasn\u2019t anyone who was going to answer those inquiries, but Shirone felt like he received just the answer he needed.\u2018In order to transcend the number\u2026 I have to\u2026\u2019\u2018REACH FOR INFINITY.\u2019PR Note: Prolly the worst cliffhanger yet no cap.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Bam! Bam! Bam!The attention of the students focused back on Shirone when the speed at which his targets exploded skyrocketed.Two flashes of lights appeared at the same time.\u201cSenior Shirone is also doubling! B-But isn\u2019t it already too late? They only have\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not double.\u201dSharelle couldn\u2019t believe the scene in front of her.The number of flashes continued to double, and eventually they started colliding with each other.A shudder ran down Shirone\u2019s back at the feeling of liberation.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe feeling was out of this world.All the senses that made Shirone himself permeated into creation, even his ego seemed to disappear.The flashes all around combined into one, and in the end, a huge curtain covered the area.The targets didn\u2019t even have a chance to make an appearance before exploding.The Speed Gun level began to continuously rise.Shirone could not stop the tears from dripping down his face.\u2018Ahhh\u2026 AHHHHH !\u2019It was being forgotten.His own name. His existence. Everything that constituted him was fading away from the world.As for Yiruki, he focused harder on himself.\u201cEeeeuukk!\u201dHe checked Shirone\u2019s score and noticed that it was catching up to his quickly, but he didn\u2019t seem to care.No matter how much Shirone sped up, he felt that he just had to run a bit faster to maintain the higher score.\u2018A savant\u2019s calculation has no limits! Watch me calculate everything! I\u2019ll see to it that I reach the end of the numbers that exist in the world!\u2019Yiruki\u2019s double Spirit Zone flew around so fast that not even an afterimage was in sight.\u2018I\u2019ll win! I can win! I have 1 second left! 0.9 second! 0.85 second! What kind of timer goes this FUCKING SLOW !!!!!\u2019BEEP!The one minute that felt like an eternity was finally over.As soon as the target holograms disappeared, Shirone and Yiruki fell on their asses at the same time.\u201cHaah\u2026 Haah.\u201dCompared to Yiruki, who was gasping for air, Shirone had his head lowered. He was not moving an inch.He had already lost consciousness.\u201cHooo\u2026\u201dYiruki checked his score.1,247 points.Yiruki set an unprecedented record. He somehow managed to beat Amy\u2019s highest record by 260 points.\u2018Not bad. Did I win? Why don\u2019t I hear anything? What\u2019s Shirone doing?\u2019Yiruki turned his head and saw that Shirone\u2019s head was tilted to the point it was nearly touching his chest. He wasn\u2019t moving.Shirone was still breathing, and he didn\u2019t seem dead, but at the same time, he didn\u2019t seem alive either. It was a strange feeling.\u2018What?\u2019Yiruki checked out Shirone\u2019s score.1,253 points.Mark couldn\u2019t believe it and swung his head back and forth between Shirone\u2019s and Yiruki\u2019s scoreboard. Then he opened his mouth.\u201cS-Senior\u2026 Shirone\u2026 Senior Shirone\u2026\u201d\u201cShirone won!\u201dSharelle, who was hugging Mark while leaping around, ran to Shirone. And with her were the lowerclassmen, who were fighting to reach him first.\u201cHEUK!\u201dAnd as if he had just been resuscitated, Shirone gasped for air.His mind, which had scattered after delving into the Infinite Realm, started combining back together along with the threads of his consciousness.\u201cUghh\u2026\u201dHe looked around to see Sharelle and a bunch of other students crowding around him.\u201cShirone, are you okay? It\u2019s me, Sharelle.\u201dHis memories had returned. And Shirone, who had finally regained his ego, gave a soft smile.\u201cYes. I\u2019m alright.\u201dThe moment he himself solidified that he was okay, the lowerclassmen and his classmates cheered, whistled, and applauded.\u201cYou were sooo amazing! Really, you\u2019re the best Shirone!\u201dWhile everyone was praising Shirone, nobody was around Yiruki.Yiruki was deep in thought with an indifferent look when someone approached and placed their hand on his shoulder.It was Nade.\u201cYou lost. But it was a great match.\u201d\u201cNot really, you don\u2019t compete to look good. You do it to win.\u201dHearing Yiruki\u2019s response, the corner of Nade\u2019s mouth went up, and he looked towards Shirone.\u2018He\u2019s an incredible guy.\u2019And considering he was his friend as well, his heart silently gave him a thumbs up.\u2018Congratulations, Shirone.\u2019Unlike the students who couldn\u2019t hide their excitement, Ethella had a serious expression.The difference in their score was tiny, but the difference in their mental speed was huge.\u2018Yiruki tried to reach the end of the number. To have gone beyond that\u2026?\u2019There was the notion of infinity.The greatest axiom that could never be reached by simply being pushed to the limit, far beyond the number.Some call such a thing god, and some others call it All Creation.\u2018Humans cannot become infinite. But\u2026 They can reach it.\u2019The emotions contained in these sentences were the sorrows that Shirone felt last night.\u2018How long have you known?\u2019Realizing the finite barrier of numbers, Shirone spread his mind into the Infinite Realm.Indeed, humans could reach Infinity, but from then on\u2026 They were no longer human\u2026\u2018Was he really planning to leave?\u2019Mages referred to this phenomenon as the \u2018Immortal Function.\u2019And Ethella knew another name for this occurrence. A name that came from the monks.\u2018Nirvana [\u6d85\u69c3] \u2019It was not a level that an ordinary person could reach\u2026But it was also something that shouldn\u2019t be reached for in the first place.Tears welled up in Ethella\u2019s eyes.\u2018No, Shirone. Humans should not recklessly embrace infinity. No matter how glorious one may seem, no matter how brilliant one may seem, the moment you enter Nirvana, your existence\u2026\u2019\u2018Will crumble away and dissipate.\u2019Only high monks, who realized the world\u2019s impermanence through long asceticism, laid down everything and entered the world of Nirvana. But Shirone was still only a 17-year-old boy.He had a bright future ahead. Infinity was a dangerous and futile venture.\u2018Right, seeing as how it ended with him only losing consciousness, it doesn\u2019t seem like he completed the journey. However, if he actually did enter Nirvana\u2026\u2019Then even Ethella didn\u2019t know what was next.The only thing she knew was that she would have to live the rest of her life repenting for Shirone.Uncharacteristically, for someone who won first place, Shirone was lost in thought and looked sad.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Ethella was sure it was no coincidence.\u201cShirone, you\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ms. Ethella. I wanted to win. I wasn\u2019t sure how dangerous it was.\u201d\u201cSince when?\u201d\u201cI left for\u2026 A very long journey.\u201dAll the emotions Shirone experienced were hidden in his words, similar to that of a zen riddle.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, instructor. Because now I know. I won\u2019t make the same mistake.\u201dEthella knew he needed no advice.He understood the situation and stopped himself, so Shirone deserved to make his own choices as well.\u201cAlright. Please, treasure yourself. This teacher loves and cares a lot for you.\u201dNot as a mage, but as a monk, Ethella was genuinely concerned about Shirone\u2019s state.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dSeeing the opportunity, the students rushed forward.\u201cI love you too, Ms. Ethella!\u201dSiena would have rained fire on them and scolded them, but Ethella patted each and every one of them on the head.\u201cI love all of you guys too. Now I should finish the exam.\u201dClass 5 gathered on the training ground.Everyone had done their best, so they harbored satisfied expressions.\u201cGood job. It\u2019s nice to end early on days when you have exams, right? Everyone has worked hard. All of you take a good rest and have fun training for next time. Thank you for your hard work.\u201cSince Ethella practiced monk etiquette, the students copied her. Half as a joke, and the other half as respect.\u201cThank you for your hard work, Ms. Ethella!\u201dEven after Ethella went down the mountain, the students could not leave because of their lingering emotions.\u201cShirone, I\u2019m so happy for you! I\u2019m sure Amy would be as well! No, wait\u2026 Would she be angry since her record got broken\u2026? Eh, whatever! It\u2019s her own boyfriend who won! Hohoho!\u201dShirone showed signs of exhaustion while listening to Sharelle blabber away.\u2018I want to rest.\u2019And as if to answer his prayer, Yiruki approached, causing everyone to shut up.\u201cOho.\u201dThe students watched, excited.They were curious as to how the haughty genius would dig at Shirone this time.Contrary to their expectations, however, Yiruki did the exact opposite.\u201cI lost. Completely.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that way.\u201d\u201cAt times like these, you don\u2019t have to be humble. Especially when it\u2019s a guy like me who\u2019s waving the white flag.\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t think I won. This exam was evaluating targeting. However, the last magic I cast covered up the entire area.\u201d\u201cKeukeuk. Seriously, you really don\u2019t change. Just because you eliminated the targets all at once doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t use targeting. That was still targeting, so don\u2019t feel iffy about it. You won.\u201dAfter a short pause, Shirone\u2019s eyes hardened.\u201cThen admit it. It\u2019s not idealism. It is wrong to study a magic that is strong enough to destroy a city while not accounting for the humans contained within it.\u201d\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Sorry.\u201dHe admitted it so easily that he left Shirone rather puzzled.Even though his admission didn\u2019t fully satisfy Shirone, he knew Yiruki was a nerd who only pursued mathematical results.\u201c...Are you serious?\u201d\u201cShirone, you are misunderstanding. Explosion is not equivalent to violence. Violence is the will to hurt someone. It\u2019s up to the humans. There\u2019s no will to an explosion. It\u2019s just something that has a much stronger energy than humans.\u201d\u201cBut it is us humans who wield that energy. We might not have it within us, be we can wield it.\u201d\u201cI agree. So this is how I define explosions. It is an uncontrollable energy. But you know, what if we are able to control the explosion? Explosions powerful enough to blow up cities can turn into a force for good. Imagine\u2026 An energy that can feed and keep 100,000 people alive. In simpler terms, energy is also our life force. What would happen then?\u201dShirone blinked once.\u201cA new era will commence. If we could control such energy, people would fight less due to the abundance of resources. Many could have luxurious, care-free lives. Of course, I don\u2019t have such a noble belief. But if such a world is possible, shouldn\u2019t we at least try? Because my abilities are meant to be used to help push for such a future.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dShirone\u2019s mind got all jumbled, but he heard Yiruki\u2019s words clearly.\u201cYou should have just said it like that from the beginning then\u2026 There would\u2019ve been nothing to be offended about.\u201dYiruki smirked.\u201cYou\u2019re so\u2026 Naive. Even if we can control the energy, if we can\u2019t control the humans that use it, it will only be a force that will lead the world to its downfall. But Shirone, I\u2019m going to do it. I\u2019m not stopping because I\u2019m afraid of that. Even if one of the victims ends up being me.\u201d\u201c\u2026What if it can\u2019t be controlled? What if such a situation occurs? Nobody can take responsibility.\u201d\u201cHaha! That\u2019s right, but\u2026\u201dYiruki sat down and looked up at the sky.\u201cShould I just stop here, then? Play around and waste my time in Class 5? Then if staying here gets boring, maybe I just live my life as a dungeon digger or something? These kinds of thoughts have never left me. It might be better for a dangerous guy like to stay here. To never go out into the world.\u201dHis classmates were dumbfounded.Didn\u2019t that mean his only reason for staying in Class 5 was because he was afraid of his own talent?Shirone was distraught.\u2018 Idealism or realism? What side is this guy on?\u2019\u201cThat\u2019s why\u2026\u201dYiruki reached out his hand and grabbed Shirone, pulling him into a standing position.\u201cFrom now on, I\u2019m your responsibility.\u201d\u201cHuh? Responsibility?\u201d\u201cI never thought I\u2019d lose to anyone in my life. So maybe you\u2019re the only one who can beat me. In the distant future, if my ways will cause tragedy, you prevent it. If I am too much of a risk, even if you kill me, I will never resent you.\u201dShirone was panicking.\u201cBut give me a little more ti\u2014\u201dYiruki interrupted.\u201cIf you don\u2019t do it, I can\u2019t take a step forward here. I will not move on. I will stay here.\u201dShirone stared Yiruki in the eye.There was not an ounce of sarcasm, pretentiousness, or exaggeration. Only true sincerity.\u201cOkay.\u201dIf he had rejected Yiruki then and there, the future Yiruki himself had envisioned would have merely become an idealistic theory.\u201cI will definitely stop you. No. I will make sure you never make such a mistake.\u201dThe students looked blank.\u2018What\u2019s up with them? Do they really think they can achieve such a feat? This is Class 5.\u2019To make their dreams a reality, they would have to overcome countless barriers.But unlike their other schoolmates, Nade was moved.He gave a small shout.\u201cAaahh!! You guys are so cool! As expected of my friends! Nice, let\u2019s do our best!\u201dNade wrapped his arms around both of their necks, and Shirone and Yiruki smiled at each other.\u2018Perhaps\u2026 He might actually be a pretty nice guy.\u2019While they both had similar thoughts, Shirone recalled his face-off with Yiruki.\u2018He\u2019s really strong.\u2019Shirone felt that there was a possibility he might not be able to win next time, but he didn\u2019t care. Because he knew that he was the only one who could suppress Yiruki.\u2018I will definitely keep my promise.\u2019The only thing that could stop something finite that was running at the speed of light was the great infinity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shirone didn\u2019t know what that \u2018thing\u2019 was.He felt the world that was compressed into a dot.The result of light, time, acceleration of gravity, and universal gravitation being tied and brought together was\u2026\u2018Vibration.\u2019Light was vibrating.When he delved in deeper, the light became bubbles and then quickly popped.It was as if the bubbles mirrored and repeated both creation and extinction.Everything was filled with light, and even the last thing that made up Shirone joined in.\u2018Ahhhhh\u2026\u2019An extreme sense of unity.And that feeling felt like an explosion.\u201cAHHH!\u201dShirone woke from his sleep with a shout. His clothing was drenched as sweat dripped down his face.He looked around his quiet and moonlit room.After seeing the books regarding Photon output spread around messily on his desk, he managed to calm down.\u201cHoo\u2026 Another nightmare.\u201dHe drank water from the pitcher and opened the window. The winds of the early summer cooled down his body.\u2018Why is this happening every night? What\u2019s happening to me?\u2019Ever since he entered the Infinite Realm during the Speed Gun exam, Shirone had been plagued by the same dream every night.Come to think of it, his nightmare didn\u2019t seem that horrific, but each time he woke up from it, his shock was considerable.\u2018Something\u2019s weird.\u2019Anxiety seeped in.After experiencing the thing called the Immortal Function, Shirone felt like everything that made him himself was out of sync.\u201cEeeuuuk\u2026\u201dDue to the chill, Shirone hugged his body.\u2018Disregarding the nightmare for now\u2026\u2019The real problem was that the strange feeling followed him even in reality.He didn\u2019t know what exactly was going on, but he felt like a particular sense of his became extremely sensitive.\u2018But what exactly is it?\u2019It wasn\u2019t like he could smell better, or had sharper sight, touch, or hearing.\u2018It\u2019s not the five senses. It\u2019s\u2026\u2019It was as if he was equipped with a new sensory organ.\u201cNo way I can sense ghosts now\u2026 Right?\u201dMusic coming from a piano was heard from the ceiling.As Shirone turned around in surprise, he noticed dawn was already peeking through the horizon.Shirone went to the bathroom with tired eyes.\u2018I don\u2019t feel like I rested.\u2019Since the Intermediate Class practical evaluation ended last week, normal classes would once again resume this week.\u2018That might be better. If I train like crazy, I might be able to get rid of this strange feeling.\u2019With his mind made up, he changed his clothes and left the dorm with a backpack slung on his shoulder.* * *The academy atmosphere was peaceful.Most of the students who returned to being friends again after the competition were all talking about the Speed Gun exam.After the evaluation ended, it was normal for a single star to appear in each class, but this time was an exception.This was because the Class 5 Speed Gun exam, which was held on the first day, left too big of an impact.It was inevitable since not one, but two students achieved scores of over 1,200 points! Such a score was unprecedented in the history of the Intermediate class.\u201cHey! There goes Shirone!\u201dThey felt something different new from Shirone, who was heading to the Intermediate class building.The rising star went from Amy\u2019s boyfriend to a student who represented the academy.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *That was why the upperclassmen from Class 4 would take the initiative to start up a conversation with him\u201cYou did well during the Speed Gun. Let\u2019s check up on each other now and then.\u201d\u201cYes, senior.\u201dThe reason why the upperclassmen-lowerclassmen relationships were strict was because getting promoted was difficult.In that sense, it meant Amy had great foresight as she recognized Shirone\u2019s talents early on.The Class 6 students started to come up to Shirone after he finished talking with the upperclassmen.\u201cHello, upperclassman!\u201d\u201cSenior Shirone, I\u2019m your fan! Can I study with you as my role model?\u201dThey were in the class that was the most displeased about Shirone\u2019s early promotion. It couldn\u2019t be helped since Class 6 was caught in the middle, as he jumped from Class 7 to 5, skipping over 6.However, they had no choice but to forget about the past and change their attitude since even their seniors from Class 4 considered Shirone as an Advanced-Class rival in the future.\u201cWhat is your plan after class today? There\u2019s going to be a magic demonstration inning, would you like to come with?\u201d\u201cOur research group decided to visit during the holiday, let\u2019s go together. I\u2019ll be happy to be your partner.\u201dOnly after he managed to kindly decline their offers did Shirone finally arrive at Class 5.\u201cShirone! Shirone! Shirone! Shirone! Shirone!\u201dAs soon as he opened the classroom door, his classmates pulled him in by his neck.He was kidnapped before he could even put his backpack down, and when he saw all his friends looking at him, he was left puzzled.\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cThe school semester is coming to an end. Join our research group. It\u2019s one that we Class 5 kids made ourselves. The topic for the performance evaluation is up to the taker to choose anyways. It\u2019s going to be fun, and moreover, you can save time. So join us.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201dShirone had consistently declined all offers to join a group so far.\u201cDon\u2019t be like that and think about it in a positive light. I heard you refused to join a research group because of your personal studies? There are quite a few students like you here, but we still have to take the performance evaluation. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making one temporarily. No discrimination. We\u2019ll quickly finish the evaluation and disband. Then you can study in your spare time.\u201d\u201cAha! I see.\u201dIt was a good strategy.Since the subject for the performance evaluation was up to the taker, there wasn\u2019t a set criteria. That being said, joining an existing research group only to leave right after the performance evaluation was a bit rude.Therefore, their solution to this problem was to create a temporary research group.At that moment, Nade came running.\u201cHey! What trick are you guys playing?! Shirone is off-limits. He\u2019s mine!\u201dIn the midst of his friends staring at him like he was absurd, a friend who knew what was going on with Nade countered.\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I know what you\u2019re planning. You want to admit him into that weird research group, right? Shirone, you should never join it. Even if you don\u2019t end up joining our group, at least don\u2019t join his. During my entire time here, never have I ever heard of Nade taking the performance evaluation.\u201dThe Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group showed off a pretty long history and tradition, but they did not participate in many public activities.\u201cEh? Nade, you have a research group? Where is it?\u201dNade racked his brain and avoided the crisis with his unique secret technique that had so far brought him success in life.\u201cHoohoo, of course. You think the most popular person in the academy won\u2019t even have a research group? Anyways, you can\u2019t have Shirone, so I\u2019ll be taking him.\u201dWhen Nade pulled Shirone away, the student who proposed the idea to Shirone shouted loudly.\u201cShirone! You have to think carefully! Never go in there! And Nade, don\u2019t bother Shirone with his studies and just let him join a group where he\u2019s comfortable.\u201d\u201cHahahaha! Too late. We already crossed the forbidden line.\u201d\u201cWait! What does that\u2014\u201dThe door slammed with a bang, and with that, Shirone was cut off. The students left in the classroom had dazed expressions.\u201c\u2026What did he just say?\u201d\u201cThis is a problem. Nade, that bastard. He\u2019s really thinking of bringing Shirone into that group. He shouldn\u2019t be swayed.\u201d\u201cNo, I think he\u2019s already swayed. And why the hell did they leave anyway? It\u2019s almost time for class.\u201d* * *Shirone, who was now in the hallway, shook off Nade\u2019s hand.\u201cWhat the heck! What in the world is the forbidden line?\u201d\u201cHaha! You are the only person who has seen the true nature of our Supernatural Psychic Research Group. That is the forbidden line you crossed.\u201d\u201cTrue nature of the research group? There\u2019s nothing to see though.\u201dNade looked around and crouched down pulling Shirone along.\u201cFirst, sit down a bit.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. Just stop pestering me.\u201dNade lowered his voice and said.\u201cIt means you\u2019re the only non-member student to have ever entered the research room. So you should never reveal it.\u201d\u201cNobody asks about it anyway.\u201d\u201cWhatever! We already don\u2019t have enough members. Moreover, there are talks going around that the management team is thinking about disbanding it. We have to keep a low profile, so don\u2019t even mention the word \u2018super\u2019 in supernatural.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright. I had no intention of doing so anyways.\u201dShirone thought of it as a group on the brink of going under, but those who knew the real value of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group were trying hard to swallow it up. In fact, even the instructors were anxious to disband it.\u201cBy the way, Shirone, are you\u2026 Really going to join that research group they made?\u201d\u201cI was contemplating. Why? Is there a reason not to?\u201d\u201cOf course. No matter how little discrimination there is in the performance evaluation, it\u2019s your loss if you are in a research group with just random people. Besides, you\u2019re aiming to be the no.1 of the entire academy. A single point is important. Instead of clumsily joining a so-so group, I think it\u2019d be better for you to do it alone. Or join a really proper one.\u201dThere was a full score of people in Class 4 who were aiming for the Advanced Class, so even a one-point difference in the performance evaluation mattered.\u2018Hmm\u2026 But to take the performance evaluation by myself would take too long.\u2019Shirone beat his brain thinking of a way to make it work.\u201cWhat if I join the Supernatural Psychic Research Group?\u201d\u201cYou?\u201d\u201cYeah. It looks like you guys don\u2019t participate much in outside activities, and both you and Yiruki have to take the performance evaluation anyways. I think it\u2019ll be better to join yours than to go and ruin a totally normal research group.\u201d\u201cHaha! That\u2019s true.\u201dNade didn\u2019t rebuke.That was also why he couldn\u2019t readily recommend his group to Shirone.It had been 45 years since the establishment of the Alpheas Magic Academy. Most students successfully graduated and left to explore the outside world, but in secretive places they did not know of, various people were doing all kinds of extraordinary things.The Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group was one such secretive place.Shirone asked again.\u201cWell, what I said earlier was a joke. What do you say? You, me, and Yiruki. Taking the performance evaluation together?\u201d\u201cAre you really okay with that? It\u2019s a plus for us if you join, but in all honesty, our research group isn\u2019t exactly normal. Though I can\u2019t go into details, it won\u2019t be like whatever you\u2019re hoping for.\u201dIt was obvious there were many secrets just by looking at Nade's attitude in the lecture room back there. However, regardless of interest, a group created just for grades wasn\u2019t appealing.\u201cThe thing is\u2026 It\u2019s not just for the performance evaluation\u201d\u201cHm? What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been feeling a bit strange lately. I was meaning to ask you guys, but maybe, supernatural psychic science can help explain some things too.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I haven\u2019t seen him.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not coming today. Something along the line of his renewed passion not prepared to accept old, bland education.

That\u2019s so Yiruki.\u201dYiruki declared that he would advance towards his dream after the confrontation with Shirone, but it seemed like his tendencies would not easily change.\u201cLet\u2019s talk later. Class is about to start.\u201dSeeing the empty hallway, Shirone quickly made his way towards the lecture room.After diligently focusing on his studies for the day, he headed to the research group with Nade after his daily routine.Shirone was amazed once again as he stood in front of the magic warehouse, Estas.If the shape he saw last time was a colony-like structure, now there were seven towers scraping the sky.\u201cEven though it\u2019s my second time seeing it, this building is really amazing.\u201d\u201cI mean, there are 89 buildings, so there\u2019s no end to the patterns. I hope Yiruki\u2019s awake.\u201dAs much as the outside had changed, the interior was no different, but Nade walked all around the maze with no hesitation.\u201cI\u2019m curious, how do you find your way around? Even labeling would be of no use if the structure changes.\u201d\u201cHaha! We don\u2019t use such a one-dimensional method. Simple enough, we just memorize everything. A long time ago, an upperclassman who was part of this research group restored Estas\u2019 blueprint.\u201dShirone\u2019s eyes grew large.\u201cWhat? Of this complicated building? No, before that, why did he do that? It wasn\u2019t like he was going to build a new one.\u201dThough it was unproductive, Nade was still proud.\u201cThere, look at the ceiling over there. There are three dots. That means this is the 3rd Room. Then we look to see what the color of the iron door to the 3rd warehouse is. It\u2019s blue, right? Hence, this place becomes the Blue of Room 3.\u201dShirone looked to where Nade was pointing.\u201cThen, you count the number of cubes. Since there are four intersections, that means there are four cubes connected to the surrounding area. It gets important from here. X is used to represent the room numbers, Y is used to represent colors, but in number form, and Z is the number of cubes. Finally you plug in the variables into the equation.\u201d\u201cEquation?\u201d\u201cActually, the blueprint isn\u2019t the standard blueprint that you\u2019re thinking of. It\u2019s simply impossible to express this building that way, so this blueprint that I\u2019m talking about is really an equation. One that was made by analyzing Estas\u2019 pattern. If you plug in the data, you will end up with a number with two decimal places. With that number, you can figure out where you are and where to go. In other words, there\u2019s no way we\u2019ll ever get lost inside Estas. Should I say it\u2019s like a Master Key?\u201d\u2018Master Key.\u2019Shirone realized that the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group was nowhere close to being normal.Estas could change into different shapes an infinite number of times, and yet the seniors who established the equation managed to figure out its patterns.While Shirone felt it was slightly unnecessary, he couldn\u2019t understand the underlying reason behind it.\u201cBut doesn\u2019t calculating take a very long time? And all this just to get to the research lab?\u201d\u201cYou get used to it. It\u2019s learning through experience. By the time three months pass, you won\u2019t even need to substitute things into the equation. You\u2019ll know it by heart.\u201d\u201cEven now, Estas is still a unique structure because it only exists inside the Alpheas Magic Academy. According to the rumors, there was an ace savant amongst the first members of this research group. Even Yiruki said the equation was beautiful the moment he laid his eyes on it. Something along the lines of he didn\u2019t think he could design an equation simpler than this. Anyways, don\u2019t tell anyone about this. If the Master Key is leaked, there will be a big problem.\u201d\u2018\u2026Certainly maniacal.\u2019A place that contained unproductive and crazy-obsessed seniors from the first generation.And that place was the Supernatural Psychic Science Research group hidden deep inside the labyrinth known as Estas.The two arrived at the lab.Similar to before, the sign was tilted, and as soon as the door opened, clouds of dust rose and attacked them.But this time, Shirone was prepared. He blocked his mouth and nose with his hand, thus avoiding managing to avoid what he felt was a catastrophe.\u201cYiruki, we\u2019re here.\u201dYiruki, as usual, was writing complicated formulas on the blackboard. He smiled as soon as he saw Shirone.\u201cHey, Shirone. What\u2019s up? I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come back to such a shabby place.\u201dNade laughed as he recalled the past.\u201cHaha, seems like we were both wrong. He wants to join.\u201d\u201cOho?\u201dIt must have been a surprise because Yiruki put down his chalk and walked towards them.\u201cHow unexpected. This research group should have nothing to do with your personal studies.\u201d\u201cThe thing is, it doesn\u2019t seem like that anymore. Something\u2019s been troubling me recently. Can I get some consulting?\u201dYiruki and Nade made eye contact. Yiruki smirked.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cThe genius who beat me has something he\u2019s concerned about. Hmm, I can already tell it must be a heck of a concern.\u201dNow that Shirone knew and understood Yiruki\u2019s personality, he was not offended by his twisted words.\u201cSomething inside of me has changed. Ever since the Speed Gun exam, I have been having nightmares, and whenever I wake up, I feel kind of creeped out. No, I feel\u00a0very\u00a0creeped out. It feels like there is someone right next to me. Could this have any relation to either the supernatural or the psychic? Don\u2019t you guys know those things like the back of your hands?\u201dHis friends\u2019 eyes shone.Nade, the explorer of the supernatural,\u00a0 and Yiruki, the critic of the supernatural.\u201cThen you\u2019ve come to the right place. First things first, sit here.\u201dNade dusted off the sofa and offered Shirone a seat, Shirone stared at the rising dust in disgust.\u2018I finally figured it out. The origin of the dust\u2026\u2019It was chalk dust. It was evidently a by-product of Yiruki\u2019s obsession with disproving the supernatural.\u201cDon\u2019t dust it off, I\u2019ll just sit down. Please, don\u2019t do anything in this room\u2026 But if you do, I beg of you, please clean up more regularly.\u201d\u201cNow, now! Don\u2019t fuss about mere fine dust! You are the first client of the research group, hurry up and tell us more about your problem!\u201dNade and Yiruki pulled up chairs and crossed their legs, acting like actual experts.Shirone was speechless, but he was as desperate as a thirsty man searching for water.\u201cThe problem is, I\u2019ve been dreaming about this lately\u2026\u201dShirone explained what he saw in his dreams, as well as the strange feeling he\u2019s been getting from time to time.\u201cI have no clue what it is. Perhaps some kind of ghost entered my body? Or\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Have you heard of anyone who\u2019s ever experienced something similar?\u201dSilence.Shirone swallowed. Considering who he was talking to, he thought that they would say a joke to break the serious atmosphere.\u201cWh-What\u2019s up? You guys are making me anxious. You are pulling a joke again, aren\u2019t you?\u201dNade scratched his eyebrow with a stumped expression.\u201cMmm\u2026 The thing is\u2026 After hearing about what you said, it seems like it is quite like\u00a0that.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying? Tell me in detail.\u201d\u201cThat sensation you said that you felt. The creepy one that sends shivers down your spine.\u201d\u201cYeah. It gets especially worse at dawn.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not scientifically verified, but what you\u2019re experiencing is a phenomenon called the \u2018Mourning Sensation\u2019.\u201d\u201cMourning Sensation?\u201d\u201c200 years ago, a scholar conducted an experiment on a death row inmate. It was called Soul Electrolysis. It\u2019s a hypothesis that if a person\u2019s soul is made of matter, it can be decomposed using electricity. Here\u2019s how. The inmate was put in a sealed, electrically conductive metal box\u2026 Then he let the electrical current flow. However, because it was so inhumane, the experiment was put to an end. Thanks to that, the death row inmate survived, but it was said that he was unconscious for a month. The problem starts there. When the inmate finally woke up, they knew everything that went on in the outside world.\u201d\u201cNo way. How is that possible?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what was so surprising. The scholar put up a hypothesis about Soul Ionization. When the soul was electrolyzed, an electromagnetic force would be generated, causing the world\u2019s information to be attracted and pulled into the inmate. Of course, the scholar was treated like a lunatic in academia. Besides, there were rumors that the criminal bribed the guards to get outside information just to push back his execution.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see, so there are experiments like that.\u201d\u201cAlthough orthodox scholars don't like to admit it, it\u2019s still a hot topic in the psychic science community. Besides, even the S\u00e9ance, which is a formal religious organization, recognizes the trance state. Therefore, I don\u2019t think Soul Ionization is some groundless, absurd theory. Anyways, the sensation the inmate felt, we call it the Mourning Sensation in this field.\u201dThinking he might be going through the same thing as the inmate, Shirone felt shivers run down his spine.\u201cOkay, it\u2019s my turn now.\u201dYiruki took over the discussion.\u201cI have a question. You said you started feeling the Mourning Sensation after the Speed Gun? Your Photon Output was certainly different than usual. If it\u2019s a secret, you don\u2019t have to reveal anything, but I think it\u2019ll be helpful if we hear about it.\u201dShirone felt that Yiruki was right. They had to know the cause if they wanted to get anything done.\u201cWhat happened was\u2026\u201dShirone explained the process of reaching the Infinite Realm in detail.The enlightenment he discovered during the Sequence method, and the fact that he transcended numbers under the pressure of the match.Yiruki nodded his head. He had already heard about the concept from his father.\u201cIt's an Immortal Function.\u201d\u201cImmortal Function?\u201d\u201cI heard about it when I was young. It\u2019s the Absolute Function that can solve the world\u2019s mysteries. I think that\u2019s very dangerous. Because everything is phenomenally the same as nothing.\u201dShirone realized anew how dangerous his attempt was as Yiruki\u2019s words were somewhat similar to Ethella\u2019s.\u201cI only theorized and thought about it, but I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d actually work. It\u2019s something I don\u2019t want to experience again.\u201dYiruki laughed.\u201cWhat stupidity are you talking about? Achieving an Immortal Function is a dream come true for mathematicians. I accept it now. If you can beat me, you should be able to at least achieve an Immortal Function. Kekeke.\u201dYiruki, who thought of the Immortal Function as a simple talent, truly showcased why he was labeled an eccentric. However, it was that laid-back attitude that lowered Shirone\u2019s anxiety level.\u201cWell anyways, Immortal Function you say? Hmm, that clears things up.\u201d\u201cReally? Did you figure something out?\u201dYiruki turned to the wall. It was as if he was writing formulas using his eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t know much about the Mourning Sensation since I don\u2019t major in psychics, but the nightmares you\u2019re having every day? I can kind of understand what it is and why you even dream of such a thing.\u201dShirone clenched his fist.\u201cTell me. I\u2019m prepared to hear anything.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, dreams distort and exaggerate memories. But your dream is probably projected exactly as your memory. This phenomenon is called psychological regression, and it follows the same principle as someone under hypnosis trying to remember clearly their past. Anyways, supposing your nightmares are of that kind, then\u2026\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cWhat you saw was probably the universe.\u201d\u201cTh-The Universe?\u201dShirone knew what the universe was. It was the unknown world outside of theirs.But that was it. No one knew much else.From time immemorial to the present, dragons were the only species that officially went out into the universe.680 years ago, Saint Dragon Gramisch flew out of the continent and into the universe in the presence of representatives from each race.However, he eventually crashed to the ground in 13 hours. His body was in a state of disrepair.Under the treaty, the representatives of each race split his body into pieces and returned to their respective territories, and the evidence obtained from said pieces later contributed greatly to the development of cosmology.\u201cThe thing in my dream\u2026 Is the universe?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Looking at the size, speed, and shape of the space, the universe is the only thing I can think of that fits the bill. The numerical value is too large for it to be implemented on the continent.\u201d\u201cBut why am I dreaming about this stuff? Psychological regression means it\u2019s my memory, but I\u2019ve never been to outer space.\u201d\u201cProbably not, but even if you didn\u2019t personally go to space, memories can still exist. According to Nade.\u201d\u201cMourning Sensation\u2026\u201dNade nodded his head.\u201cYeah. The death row inmate knew every nation\u2019s situation, despite being in a coma due to the Soul Electrolysis experiment. That means he transcended space and time to gain that information. The Mourning Sensation is in a different field from psychic science\u2019s materiality breakaway. If one\u2019s soul flies around like a pigeon, one won\u2019t be able to come across all the information about the world simultaneously. On the other hand, when ionization occurs electrically, a quantum phenomenon will occur. With that lies a possibility of transcending space and time.\u201dYiruki nodded in agreement.\u201cIn the microscopic world, things outside of our common sense occur. Observation and measurement cannot be done at the same, and even those are only probabilities. It\u2019s like plucking a guitar string and being unable to determine where it is at the moment. If by chance, the weight of the soul is lighter than that of electrons, it might be possible to feel the universe. Since it\u2019s a world where there is no real correlation between time and distance.\u201dAfter putting together everything said by both Nade and Yiruki, Shirone could somewhat imagine it in his head.\u201cHmm, I think I know what the situation is now. Thanks. You guys are true members of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group.\u201d\u201cHaha! This is nothing. Anyways, don\u2019t worry too much. It probably isn\u2019t some bizarre curse or anything like that. Let\u2019s look into areas related to the Immortal Function.\u201dAt that moment, Shirone made up his mind.\u201cOkay! I\u2019m going to join the Supernatural Psychic Research Group.\u201dNade found no reason to refuse. After all, there would be three members if Shirone joined. They would be registered as an official research group, and the subsidies that were cut off a year ago would start coming in again.\u201cYou\u2019re always welcome here, right, Yiruki?\u201d\u201cFor the development of this research group, Shirone is definitely a good recruit, but will the management team approve? There might be a lot of teachers who will oppose it due to our group\u2019s notoriety.\u201d\u201cLeave that to me. I just have to put the document in without them noticing. Now, let\u2019s get going!\u201dShirone, who was following his friends, looked back.\u2018This is now my research group.\u2019It was no different than a warehouse, but considering it would soon be \u2018his\u2019 soon, he couldn\u2019t help but feel happy.\u2018I\u2019ll have to plan a big clean-up day sometime.\u2019Bang !The iron door closed.In the desolate laboratory where the lights were turned off, the dust particles coming from where Shirone sat silently rotated.* * *The teacher's room was unusually busy.The instructors who were finished with class usually drank tea or chatted while waiting for their next class, but right now, all of them were analyzing documents.There were dozens of applications for membership.Siena, who had just finished her class, was surprised to see the piles of papers.\"Oh my, are they all membership applications? There are a lot this week.\"\"Hoho, it's almost the end of the semester. It\u2019s always like this around this time of the year. What a bunch of sneaky kids.\"As the students could replace the performance evaluation with a presentation from the research group, it had become a recent trend for students who were not part of a group to temporarily join one at the end of the semester.Thadd, who was assisting with the work, said.\u201cThe kids are only becoming sneakier and sneakier. It wasn\u2019t like this in the past, they used to be so passionate about their research group and the performance evaluation. I think students these days only focus on efficiency.\u201d\u201cHahaha! It\u2019s not what it used to be. Compared to 10 years ago, competition has become more fierce, so they must be experiencing a fair amount of stress. The reason for creating a temporary research group is probably to buy time for their personal studies.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I just think they are too obsessed with performance and grades. There\u2019s a thing called school life romance, you know? They should learn to unwind.\u201dThe instructors who agreed with Thadd could only give bitter smiles.\u201cThere\u2019s one that\u2019s left out.\u201d\u201cHuh? Where did that come from? It seems like someone came in during class to turn it in secretly.\u201d\u201cHoho, they must have been in a hurry.\u201dSiena was curious to see which student was sneaky enough to do such a thing and scanned the paper.\u201cThis\u2026 Says Shirone, right?\u201dAn instructor poked his head out to check.\u201cLooks like it. Shirone Arian. I thought he had no interest in joining a research group. I guess students left and right use all kinds of sneaky tricks, so there\u2019s no helping it.\u201dThadd frowned after seeing the application form that had been passed to him.\u201cI don\u2019t think so. This research group\u2026 Isn\u2019t it pretty famous? This group already existed even when I was a student.\u201d\u201cShow me again.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Siena checked the name of the research group Shirone joined.It was a famous one indeed.\u2018Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group.\u2019Her head throbbed thinking back to the time when she fought with the people from this research group.\"Oh? Come to think of it\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn't most of the problem kids from the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group graduate last year?\u201dThang gave an empty laugh.\"I heard he did amazing during the Speed gun. Seems like they get along well. I really didn\u2019t think they would get along at all.\u201dSiena spoke with a pained expression.\"Yes. That is why it's a problem.\"If Yiruki, who came second to none after Shirone, persuaded him, the honest and naive Shirone might have changed his mind.But she couldn't believe Yiruki would do something like that.\u2018Yiruki crosses the line too often. If by chance Shirone and Yiruki work together to do something, then there will be two big explosions. Let's cut off the bad line this time.\u2019Siena looked in the file to see who the president of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research group was.\u2018Nade.\u2019The two who were closest to Shirone. She now knew why Shirone had joined the group.\u2018The instructor in charge of Nade\u2026\u2026\u201dShe found the person listed on the instructor\u2019s list. And as soon as she read the name, she pinched the bridge of her nose and sighed.\u2018Haah\u2026 Of all instructors.\u2019* * *On a training ground located on the outskirts of the magic academy, Ethella sat crossed-legged. She was meditating.The Karsis Order, which she was part of, was the best one in the kingdom. It had more than 1,000 monk apprentices alone.And though hundreds of children entered holding their parents\u2019 hands, only a few whose talents were recognized became monks.And among those recognized, Ethella was a unique existence.She became the youngest bishop, beating numerous high-ranking aristocrats and even royalty.One could not earn the position of bishop just because of great talent.The reason why Ethella caught the eyes of her predecessors was because of her nature as a natural truthseeker.Be the light and salt of the world.With this mindset, she left her wealth and honor behind and became an instructor at the Alpheas Magic Academy.\u2018Thank you for allowing the students to complete their education safely today.\u2019\u2018Gratitude for nature that made me come true.\u2019Her sense of duty to share that gratitude with others was what made her, her.At some point, Ethella suddenly opened her eyes wide.\u201c......\u201dShe felt a female walking towards the training ground through her Spirit Zone Synesthesia.Typically, it was not possible for someone to determine the gender of a person through the Spirit Zone, but Ethella, a Spirit Zone expert, could obtain information beyond what mages of her grade typically could.Mage society called people like her \u2018Zoners\u2019.Assuming that an ordinary Spirit Zone was filled with oxygen, a Zoner\u2019s Spirit Zone was filled with liquid.The pressure of the medium was different, thus allowing Zoners to feel things through synesthesia much more accurately.Ethella prepared tea to greet her guest and soon, the door to the training ground opened slowly.\u201cWelcome, Ms. Siena.\u201dAlthough she did come without any notice, Siena was not surprised to hear Ethella greet her. She knew how detailed a Zoner\u2019s Spirit Zone could be.\u201cI see you were practicing asceticism. Am I bothering you?\u201dShe assumed as much, considering Ethella was wearing her asceticism garment.Ethella shook her head as if to say she didn\u2019t mind.\u201cNo, no. I finished just now. Come in.\u201d\u201cThen, excuse me.\u201dSiena was unfamiliar with having to sit on the ground, even if there was a cushion, but she showed no sign of discomfort and received the tea with two hands from Ethella.She had heard from somewhere that refraining from conversing during the first cup of tea was the etiquette of the Order, so she did not say a word until she emptied the bitter tea.The daytime was long as it was summer, but she could already see the golden horizon from the sun setting outside.Siena, who wanted to start the conversation before dark, quickly finished up her hot tea.The corner of Ethella\u2019s eyes crinkled.\u201cFor you to come all the way here\u2026 It must not be a simple matter.\u201d\u201cYes. I have something to consult with you.\u201d\u201cI see. What is the matter?\u201d\u201cMs. Ethella, you are the instructor in charge of Nade, correct?\u201d\u201cYes, he is a bright student. His grades are in the high-mid ranks, and he has plenty of talent. Not to mention, he gets along with the other children as well.\u201d\u201cIf that is the case, then do you also know that he\u2019s the president of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group?\u201d\u201cOf course. Did he cause some sort of trouble?\u201dSiena pushed aggressively.\u201cI\u2019m planning on disbanding that research group. I came here to ask for approval from his instructor as I feel it is only proper to do so.\u201dEthella savored her tea and smiled.She was deep in thought for a while, but eventually, she finally opened her mouth to speak.\u201cIf that is what Ms. Siena desires, then I\u2019m sure it\u2019s for the betterment of the student. However, this time around at least, I must hear the reason behind your decision.\u201d\u201cMany incidents and accidents stem from the Supernatural Psychic Research Group. It was a group that gained notoriety even before I took office. Of course, they\u2019ve also made great achievements, so the academy has let them slide more than a few times. But things have changed. I looked through the documents and found out that they have not made a single official presentation in the last three years. And not only have that, they even continuously show bad behavior.\u201d\u201cHowever, as you said Ms. Siena, Doesn\u2019t their notoriety stem from actions committed a long time ago? The current president is Nade. Can\u2019t you watch over them a little longer? The Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group is one of the oldest research groups in Alpheas Magic School. It has generations of history. I know that Garold Mikeah, the president of the Thormia Magic Association, came from that group.\u201dSiena expected this kind of response, so she took out her hidden card.\u201cShirone submitted an application for membership today.\u201d\u201c......\u201dThat closed Ethella\u2019s mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All three of them are students that the academy keeps an eye on in one way or another. Although we can\u2019t interfere with who hangs out with who, the research group is not a club. Many students are absorbed in the performance evaluation, but if Shirone, at this time, joins a research group simply because he is close with them, he will fall behind.\u201dThadd enjoyed the idea of a school life romance, but Siena thought differently.\u2018What year is he living in? Students are so bright these days. Times have changed.\u2019Ethella covered her mouth to hide her laugh.\u201cYou haven\u2019t changed. Well, it\u2019s true that the three of them are promising prospects in the eyes of the academy. If his grades fall, the academy will be at a loss too.\u201dSiena didn\u2019t deny it.\u201cI do not think there\u2019s anything wrong with trying to get talented students to grow and advance forward. That\u2019s what I think education is for, after all.\u201d\u201cYes, I fully understand.\u201dEthella smiled and nodded her head, making Siena regret her earlier remarks.\u2018She\u2019s such a good-natured person.\u2019She could see why students liked her.Ethella\u2019s view of education was the complete opposite. Never favor or force someone. Siena felt that such an approach would only make the students fall behind. However, looking at the results, the kids under her care were by no means inferior to Siena\u2019s.\u2018Am I being selfish? I have no intention of ruining the fun of their school life\u2026 But what will be the future of the students if they end up wasting their talent?\u2019Siena let out a sigh.\u201cI don't know. I\u2019m not sure why children who have such great potential are going down a different path. I also don\u2019t know why Shirone applied for such a place.\u201dEthella silently looked down at her cup as she was lost in thought.She was the only one who knew about Shirone\u2019s Nirvana.The reason why she didn\u2019t report such a matter to the academy was because doing so recklessly could flip Shirone\u2019s life 180 degrees.\u2018It is Shirone\u2019s realm. It\u2019s his\u2026 Sigh, I had hoped that he would be able to make his own decisions for as long as possible, but it seems like\u2026\u2019Siena was his instructor, and she seemed to genuinely care about Shirone, so Ethella felt like talking about it would not be a bad idea.\u201cBy any chance, has Shirone been acting strange lately?\u201dSiena blinked.\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I suppose every now and then, yes. Though, I imagine it\u2019s all because he\u2019s hanging out with them. He probably even only applied to join the research group because Nade and Yiruki persuaded him to.\u201d\u201cPerhaps, there is another reason.\u201d\u201cWhat does that\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry for not telling you this before, but the reason for Shirone\u2019s strangeness has something to do with the Speed Gun exam.\"Ethella told her the story of Shirone entering Nirvana during the exam.Siena\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cAre you sure? That\u2019s an Immortal Function.\u201dSiena was shocked. After all, it was a peak state.Though, that didn\u2019t mean Shirone had reached the highest peak of that state.In terms of the state alone, there were recorded cases of street beggars realizing deeper degrees than mages. It was too dangerous of a concept for Shirone, who was only a student, to control.\u201cWhy did you not notify me of this sooner? This is an extremely serious problem.\u201dEthella believed there was no such thing as big problems or small problems. That\u2019s why she handed the reins over to Shirone, as she believed the difficulty of a problem was dependent on who was undertaking it.\u201cShirone already knows. Nirvana is the highest quality of realization that even I have never experienced. When it comes to Nirvana, I thought there was no room for anyone to intervene.\u201d\u201cI understand how you feel. We can\u2019t force others to do something we don\u2019t know about. But what if there is an Overflow? Then there will be no turning back.\u201dOverflows occurred when a certain talent was awakened at a mentally underdeveloped age.In fact, some even say that the younger you experience it, the more of a genius you are. But Siena felt that those sayings were nothing more than irresponsible remarks made by gossipers.Siena experienced Overflow at the young age of 9.At the time, the world reflected in her eyes was not all rainbows and unicorns. In fact, she was filled with even more curiosity, as the more she knew, the bigger her \u2018Why?\u2019 got.Eventually, her mind bore a mysterious monster that ate at her psyche.It was unbearably frightening, so she locked all her doors and dwelled in darkness.Despite the continuous attention given by the Olifer Academy, her condition showed no signs of improving.Siena remembered the darkness she had resided in for a year\u2026 Though she also remembered very clearly the single ray of light that cracked through the darkness like a miracle.A voice that sounded like it came from a boy rang out.\u2013Siena, let\u2019s get out of here.Siena could even see the gleam of the boy\u2019s golden hair from a crack in the doorway.If that mysterious man had not reached out his hand at that time, Siena would not be here.\u201cMs. Ethella.\u201dSiena said as she came back from her flashback.\u201cI suffered from Overflow as a child. I\u2019m sure you did as well?\u201dIt must\u2019ve sounded like a silly question.The average age at which mages reached Certified Grade 6 was 28 years old.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Siena and Ethella were both 26 years old, and they both reached certified Grade 6 six years ago.Considering it took an average of 10 years to rise from Grade 6 to Grade 5, they ranked near the top among Grade 6 mages.\u201cYes, I experienced it when I was seven years old. That\u2019s why I entered the Karsis Order. But I was lucky to meet nice people. Thanks to them, I was able to get out of it with no problem.\u201dTwo years earlier than Siena. But it was nothing to be jealous about.\u201cIt must have been hard.The younger you were, the bigger the fear Overflow generated.\u201cIt was scary. If I hadn\u2019t entered the Order, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to live normally.\u201dIt was only possible because the Karsis Order was where the world\u2019s best truth-seekers gathered.\u201cBut why are you leaving Shirone alone? I know he\u2019s a smart kid, but we\u2019re talking about the Immortal Function. His mind must have been affected. In fact, he\u2019s probably still experiencing problems.\u201d\u201cThere is nobody who can help Shirone. Only those who have experienced the Immortal Function can understand it. It would be different if he asked for help, but if we do things carelessly and too hastily, we might negatively affect his mind. We have no choice but to watch for now.\u201dSiena was frustrated.\u201cThen what if something irreversible happens? If there\u2019s a sudden change in Shirone\u2019s mind, then that means it\u2019s too late. No one can be responsible.\u201dEthella placed down her cup and spoke.\u201cI don\u2019t teach students just to be responsible. I believe that Shirone will overcome it well.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cBut.\u201dEthella\u2019s eyes hardened.\u201cIf worst comes to worst, I\u2019m prepared to atone for the rest of my life.\u201dSiena closed her mouth.Thinking that maybe what she lacked was resolution, Siena clasped her hands together.\u201cI understand what you mean.\u201d* * *The Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group\u2019s H.Q.As the iron door opened, Nade and Shirone walked through the thick clouds of dust.\u201cPooh, Pooh!\u201dShirone fanned his hand in front of his face to fight against the dust while Nade did not care and plopped down on the sofa.Yiruki was playing chess.He was alternating between white and black. His hand moved with no hesitation.When the game ended, he lined up the horses again to start the next round.\u201cYou\u2019re here? How was today?\u201d\u201cEh, so-so. Nothing interesting happened.\u201dShirone sighed at the sight of his friends.Yiruki skipped classes every day and played chess while the only thing Nade did after coming to the research group was sleep.\u201cYiruki, you skipped today\u2019s afternoon classes, right? What are you going to do if you get suspended?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I just need to raise my exam scores enough to offset my attendance.\u201dIt was a cheeky answer, but Shirone couldn\u2019t refute because ultimately, Yiruki was right.Currently, Yiruki was holding out in Class 5 with only his scores from STEM, as his grades in all the humanities subjects was zero. This meant that Yiruki was throwing away an easy 20-point increase to his final grade.\u2018Even so, isn\u2019t this too much? This is my first time seeing kids in Class 5 who don't study.\u2019Anyways, they knew how they were doing, so Shirone didn\u2019t do anything about it.In fact, Shirone felt stupid as he was ranked below them.\u201cI guess I joined this research group pointlessly.\u201d\u201cYo, what\u2019re you saying? What did we do?\u201d\u201cYou call it a research group, but we don\u2019t do any academic activities, we just play and hang out\u2026 And yet, your grades are still better than mine. I feel more anxious because I\u2019m hanging out with geniuses like you guys.\u201dYiruki swerved his head and stared at Shirone with a blank face\u2018 \u2013__\u2013\u2019\u201cLook who\u2019s talking. Is that supposed to be a funny joke? Cause if so, I\u2019m sorry, but it didn\u2019t do its job. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve forgotten already, but you were the one who dumped a bucket full of humiliation on me.\u201d\u201cI know, right? He\u2019s so modest to the extent that I smell a whiff of arrogance. I want to wring his neck right now.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. Starting today, I\u2019m going to decrease the time I spend in the research group. You guys aren\u2019t going to do the performance evaluation anyway, right? I\u2019d rather use that time to study than sit here and watch you guys roll around in all this\u2026\u00a0dust.\u201d\u2018My\u2026\u2019Nade smacked his lips.Shirone was such a model student that if he didn\u2019t get to study at least a bit every hour, he would have an uneasy expression as if he had stepped on dog poop.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you study here instead?\u201d\u201cHuh? Here?\u201d\u201cYeah. We feel a bit bad for you, too. We want to play with you, but we feel like we\u2019re disturbing you. Not a bad idea, is it? Maybe we\u2019ll be motivated and do something, too.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t think the studying would go well, but if it could stimulate his friends, why not?Nade, who proposed all these ideas, laid down yet again on the sofa limply and yawned.\u201cWhat now? I\u2019m really bored.\u201dShirone was taking out a book when he heard that, and a vein popped out from his temple. However, he tried to punch down that anger knowing that today wasn\u2019t the end of it. This was nothing compared to the difficulties he knew he would face in the near future while studying here, so Shirone took no heed and began studying.Yiruki, who was now on his 34th round of chess, spoke while busily moving his pawn and bishop.\u201cIf you have nothing to do, just read a picture book. I got one for this month. It\u2019s inside the safe.\u201d\u201cOho, really?\u201dNade quickly rose up and dug through the trash pile under the table as if to dig a tunnel.\u2018Picture book? Is it some kind of famous painting collection?\u2019Nade was kind of bothering Shirone as he was wiggling around under him. But since Shirone was also interested in art, he let Nade off the hook. For now.After slipping out from the garbage pile, Nade crawled out from under the table and waved a book in the air.\u201cHAHAHA! The latest release of the picture book!\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dShirone\u2019s eyes grew into two circles.The cover was far from being a book related to famous paintings. Actually, it was not at all what he imagined it to be. The background color was red, and on top of that, there was a picture of a vulgar woman on the cover. The title of the book was \u2018Female Body Research Group\u2019. It was written along the sewing line.\u201cWhat on earth is that strange book?\u201d\u201cOh right, you don\u2019t know about this, do you? This right here is a picture book. A secret magazine circulated by the Shadow Research Group. It is popular among male students because it mainly has female illustrations, but it is also a source of gossip. In fact, a few months ago, some of the academy\u2019s confidential files were published.\u201d\u201cConfidential? How is that possible?\u201d\u201cIt either means there is an infiltrator on the teacher\u2019s side, or that the research group\u2019s ability to gain information is beyond imagination\u2026 Though, it\u2019s probably the latter. The Shadow Research Group has an extreme dislike for instructor interference.\u201dYiruki added.\u201cShould I say it\u2019s unproductive amusement for humans that have nothing to do? The academy periodically confiscates publications, but it\u2019s a branch organization, so they can\u2019t capture the main figure. I don\u2019t even know who the president is. However, the common opinion is that the leader of the Shadow Research Group is in the Advanced class.\u201d\u201cAdvanced Class\u2026 How does this even make sense\u2026?\u201dIndeed, that person was on a completely different level compared to Yiruki and Nade\u2019s effort to kill time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Someone had put in the work to find all of these things out.\u201cWow.\u201dThe most shocking thing was the illustrator\u2019s drawing skills. It was as if the drawings were real.\u2018Is this really done by one person?\u2019Every time Shirone turned a page, he awed in amazement.\u2018Why make gossip magazines? With their skill, they could have been a renowned painter.\u2019Then he saw a familiar figure that made him stop turning the page.\u201cHuh?\u201dIt was Amy Karmis.Of course, she wasn\u2019t drawn any worse than the others, but what caught Shirone\u2019s eye was her daily routine.The things she did during break and who she ate with, everything was written in detail.Shirone couldn\u2019t find his name.\u201cThey really have nothing to do.\u201dShirone felt strange hearing about her daily life in detail through someone else\u2019s writing.Nade read his mind.\u201cWhat are you so angry about? She ate with her classmates. She can choose to eat with other male students from the Advanced Class, no?\u201dYiruki cackled.\u201cCan\u2019t you tell just from Shiro\u2019s personality? I don\u2019t think they\u2019re even dating. Hey, be honest with me. You guys haven\u2019t even held hands yet, right?\u201dShirone threw the book he was holding.\u201cHmph, mind your own business. Anyways, stop looking into stuff like this. Let\u2019s please do something productive. We\u2019re still a research group. How can we be like this all day?\u201dRealizing that studying with them was out of the picture, Shirone decided to find something he could do with his friends.\u201cIf so, why don\u2019t we check out Nade\u2019s invention? The list of patents of Nade the Wiz.\u201dNade leaped to his feet.\u201cRight! There was that. Alright, Shirone. You will be really surprised, so look forward to it.\u201dNade crawled back under the table. Shirone bent down, curious to see what was inside the garbage dump, and was surprised to see a safe concealed among the trash.\u201cTada!\u201dNade took something out, but nothing was visible to Shirone.\u201cWhat?\u201dThen, when Nade waved his arm, Shirone felt like the area around his hand was wavering based on a certain boundary.\u201cNo way!\u201d\u201cHaha! Yeah! It\u2019s an invisibility cloak!\u201dAn object that refracted light with electrical power and created an illusion that made it seem as if light passed through it.\u201cYou really made it? This?\u201dElectric magic was often just used for or associated with lighting or electric attacks, but in reality, that field of magic was divided into many more branches and series.One of them was the illusion branch that dealt with virtual vision. Nade created a magic weapon that had the same effect as the Invisibility magic that caused the transparency effect.Though it wasn\u2019t his original invention, being able to produce the invisible cloak required the ability of an incumbent professional.\u201cMy dream is to become a magic engineer. Of course, compared to those expensive invisibility cloaks out in the market, this is nothing. The material is low quality, and not to mention the charging ability is insufficient. It only lasts an hour. But still, not bad, right?\u201dNade put on the cloak. His figure disappearedThe quality of the invisibility cloak depended on the refractive index of light, and if it fell below 95%, it could not be considered invisible anymore. So even a 1% difference was the criterion for determining its technological prowess.Currently, Nade\u2019s item was not 99%, which was the industry\u2019s best, but it had a high enough refractive index of light to be called transparent.When Nade moved, a blurred boundary could be detected.However, when he was standing still, the boundary was almost nonexistentShirone suddenly thought of something.\u201cYou know, if you dumped that effort into studying, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d get much better grades.\u201d\u201cHaha! Probably, but I\u2019m happier when I make magic tools. Hold on, I have more stuff.\u201dNade pulled something out from the safe again.A miniature electric-powered carriage and holographic vision that made 2-D drawings into 3-D were also completed.There were also flashbangs and smoke bombs that were Yiruki\u2019s idea, but they were not unique enough to be on Nade\u2019s patent list.\u201cAnd if you press this button\u2026\u201dShirone carefully observed Nade who blabbered on and on about his works. It was his first time seeing him so enthusiastic.\u2018He\u2019s not wasting his talent.\u2019It was true that they were problematic kids, but Nade and Yiruki had expertise ahead of any of their peers.\u201cThe rotational speed per second for this carriage\u2019s power plant is\u2026 Huh?\u201dNade, who was so engrossed in explaining, felt the room suddenly shake and looked up at the ceiling.The vibrations became worse, and when the horses stationed on top of the chessboard fell down, Yiruki went out to the hallway after having a realization.\u201cDamn it! Teacher! Teacher incoming! Get those things! Clean it up!\u201d\u201cWhat? What\u2019s happening?\u201dThere wasn't any time to explain.Nade hid the picture book as if he had done this a thousand times and just rammed the smoke bombs and the uncertified funds for the research group into the safe.Finally, after all the items that violated the academy rules were \u2018disposed\u2019 of, Nade snatched Shirone and sat him on the sofa.\u201cSit here! We\u2019re in for questioning!\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, Estas\u2019 engine system began to operate.A red warning light flashed in the hallway. It announced that the research group would soon be summoned to the first floor.\u201cTeacher\u2019s coming? Then why are we sitting down like this? Aren\u2019t you going to greet them?\u201dNade sat Shirone back down.\u201cNever mind that! Just act as if nothing happened. Everything\u2019s normal. We weren\u2019t doing anything, okay? If we get caught with things like the picture book or the smoke bomb, things won\u2019t end with a simple probation.\u201d\u201cHuh? O-Okay.\u201dHearing the word \u201cprobation,\u201d Shirone\u2019s heart sank, but before he knew it, he calmed down.Nade was tongue-tied at the insane switch speed, but at least one of his worries went away.\u2018Shirone won\u2019t make a mistake\u2026 I hope. The only thing left is to see which of the instructors will come in\u2026\u2019After a final inspection of the room, Nade took a deep breath and sat on the sofa, crossing his legs.\u2018Hah! Come at us.\u2019The eyes of the trio hardened.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201c \u2026So annoying.\u201dSiena massaged her head which was wracked with a painful headache.It took 3 minutes to move Estas\u2019 warehouse to the first floor. It was more than enough time to not only clean up the area and hide any against-the-rule items, but also to make a run for it.In the past, some instructors tried to infiltrate the laboratory without operating the engine system. However, all they did was lose their way and wander around for over an hour without being able to catch a glimpse of the laboratory. On the other hand, the members freely went in and out of the laboratory. It was natural for the instructors to get angry.\u2018These shrewd weasels.\u2019She could somewhat make a guess of how they did it.\u2018There must be an equation.\u2019Estas was built as a magic warehouse, but the manufacturing company along with the design layout were not disclosed.She just found it absurd that a student 20 years ago had solved it and used it as a cover-up technique for the research group.Siena folded her arms across her chest and tapped her feet against the ground until Estas\u2019 form was completed.\u2018The more I think about it, the more it annoys me. Why the heck is there a research group in this place? What am I supposed to do with these kids?\u2019That was why the Shadow Research Group was a problem.If they were a simple delinquent circle like the Black Magician, they would have been easily controlled by the instructors, but the intellectual power of those hidden in the shadows were already outside of the academy\u2019s palm.PR/N: Victims of Black Magician would beg to differ.And now, just by looking at the members of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group, Black Magician would be seen as a joke.\u2018This is a ticking bomb. Considering their talents, if they decide to do something together, it\u2019d definitely be huge. The problem is if an accident occurs\u2026 It could lead to the biggest accident in this academy\u2019s history.\u2019The research group had very unique members.Nade was average during class time, but he showed off his agility and nimbleness like no other while focusing on research-group related projects.Yiruki. A troublemaker of Class 5. He was born with the Savant Syndrome.Now, the star student of the academy, Shirone, had squeezed his way in between those two.No matter how hard she tried to imagine them together, she couldn\u2019t. So how were they able to get along so well together?\u2018Was one talent attracting another? Well, I guess if it\u2019s Nade and Yiruki, they could happily get along. But\u2026\u2019The problem was that Shirone was in a dangerous state.She had to prevent him, who awakened the Immortal Function, from falling into Overflow.Ethella said he could overcome it himself, but there was always that one-in-a-million chance of something going wrong. It was better to be safe than sorry.And if that one-in-a-million chance became a reality, then Shirone\u2019s life would forever be changed.While deep in thought, Estas stopped.Without waiting a second more, Siena entered the warehouse and glared at the sign written \u2018Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group.\u2019 Then she slammed open the door.\u201cCough! Cough!\u201dThrough the crazy amount of dust, she saw three hazy figures. Shirone and his friends were sitting down.As expected, they were smiling without showing any sign of surprise.Of course, to Siena, this was a familiar sight.The only difference was that all the little devils that she had conflicts with graduated, and a new member was there.\u2018How come kids change into this whenever they join this research group? Seems even Shirone is not immune\u2026\u2019Normally, Shirone would have greeted her with a smile, but right now he had the perfect poker face. She understood a little, but to say she wasn\u2019t disappointed in the slightest would be a lie.Next to Nade, who had an overconfident expression and sat with crossed legs, was Yiruki, who had his back flat against the chair like a delinquent.\u201cHmph.\u201dSiena approached them with a snort. The atmosphere was enough to make any normal instructor walk right out the door exactly how they entered.\u201cNot even gonna greet your instructor?\u201dNade gave a sniff.\u201cGuess we were too engrossed in our discussion and missed you there. Welcome.\u201dNade\u2019s relaxed appearance as the president was a complete shift from his usual quiet attitude in class.The student\u2019s research group, which was an autonomous organization, was very wary of instructor interference. Thanks to that wariness, however, they were able to rise to their current position as an axle of the magic academy community.\u2018Hmph. Yeah? All right. You\u2019re trying to say you guys are a research group, aren\u2019t you? Fine, be that way. But today will mark the last page of your research group.\u2019Approval had already been given by the Instructor\u2019s Committee.Nade questioned.\u201cAnyways, what\u2019s the big issue of the day? I\u2019ve been keeping a low profile these days.\u201d\u201cAn official notice regarding your research group has been given. I came to tell you directly. Isn\u2019t that what instructors should do?\u201d\u201cThen please sit.\u201dNade wiped the seat. His attitude showed no hint of a guilty conscience.\u201cThank you. While you\u2019re at it, why not provide a cup of tea?\u201d\u201cYou know, I would love to, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019d trust the tea we\u2019d give you.\u201dSiena laughed.She guessed that there was no cold water, let alone tea, in such a shabby warehouse.Perhaps she didn\u2019t hate these kids as much as the previous ones because they had such a witty way of talking.\u201cAlright. You successfully made me slightly nervous. I\u2019ll get straight to the point. The Instructor\u2019s Committee has decided. I would like for you guys to vacate this laboratory within a month.\u201d\u201cWHAT?!\u201dAll three pairs of eyes popped open.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why all of a sudden?\u201dNade\u2019s shoulder curved inwards as he asked.The corners of Siena\u2019s mouth curved up.\u201cThe management team reviewed documents and found out that you operated the group without meeting the required number of members this semester. The academy has already cut off the subsidy, so I\u2019d appreciate it if you clean things up within a month.\u201d\u201cWait a minute! We have Shirone now! 3 members is the minimum requirement for a research group to be recognized.\u201d\u201cBut what did you guys do? What activities did you participate in? If you want to save your research group, you have to produce some kind of research accomplishment or results within a month, which is the due date. Of course, I don\u2019t know what kind of research you can do in the field of the supernatural.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not mandatory for a research group to do a presentation. And we\u2019re not the only research groups, there are many other ones like us too!\u201d\u201cThis one\u2019s a special case. Since your research group is located inside Estas, there are a lot of inconveniences in operation, that\u2019s one thing. Second thing, the Supernatural Psychic Science Reserach Group in particular has made no achievement except for earning notoriety. The one-month time was only given to you because Ms. Ethella requested it. You should be grateful.\u201dShirone was totally dumbfounded.He had just entered the research group, only for it to soon be disbanded.\u201cBut if you guys are really desperate, there is one way to save the research group.\u201dNade asked with no hesitation.\u201cWhat\u2019s that? What do we need to do?\u201d\u201cWithdraw Shirone from the research group. Then I\u2019ll overlook this group at least until next semester.\u201d\u201cWhaaaaat?!\u201dAs expected, Nade blew up.\u201cNo way! It\u2019s not like we forced him to join, we three are friends who always stick together in the academy. Why are you trying to tear us apart?\u201dYiruki added to what Nade said.\u201cIf it\u2019s because I miss class, don\u2019t worry teacher. We all are masters when it comes to studying, it is just that we have our own methods of doing so.\u201dShirone couldn\u2019t sit still and just listen.\u201cI feel the same. I know this research group is notorious, along with the fact that Yiruki and Nade do not diligently attend class. However, even these two pour in an absurd amount of effort into their fields of study. They\u2019re not wasting their time. So please, be lenient.\u201dNade held on to a string of hope knowing that Siena particularly treasured Shirone.However, Siena\u2019s mind was set.\u201cI\u2019m not changing my mind. Above all, Shirone, this is a decision made for you.\u201d\u201cA decision made for me? I thought I was working hard.\u201d\u201cShirone, what have you been going through lately?\u201dShirone\u2019s heart sank while Nade and Yiruki looked anywhere else but at them.Siena knew from their reaction.As expected, he had told his friends about everything.\u201cYou guys are really\u2026\u201dSiena sighed\u201cEspecially you, Yiruki. You know that Shirone is in danger of facing Overflow, so why didn\u2019t you tell the instructor?\u201dIt was Shirone\u2019s first time hearing that term.\u201cYiruki, what is Overflow?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s a phenomenon that happens to geniuses at young ages. I experienced it when I was eight.\u201dSiena was not satisfied with his explanation.\u201cIf you go into Overflow for a long period of time, your mind may collapse. I heard about the Immortal Function from Ms. Ethella. If we miss the timing, you will fall into a state where recovery is impossible.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dShirone thought.Even now, the nightmares persisted every night, and he still suffered from the Mourning Sensation. He was worried he would go crazy at some point which made Siena\u2019s explanation credible.Shirone asked Yiruki again.\u201cH-How was it? For you?\u201d\u201cHmm, there really wasn\u2019t much to it. Well, it was a bit scary. When I told my father about it, he said that it was normal for a bastard like me and that I was supposed to live like that for the rest of my life.\u201dSiena let out a dry chuckle.That was the only thing he had to say to his son who was living in fear.\u2018How absurd.\u2019However, considering who Yiruki\u2019s father was, it was mildly understandable. Anyways, it was true that his father played a part in Yiruki\u2019s eccentric personality.Siena asked Nade.\u201cWhat are your thoughts?\u201d\u201cHuh? Me? Hahaha, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what Overflow feels like.\u201dSiena sighed. She was hoping Shirone would change his mind after hearing about the experiences of his friends.\u201cOkay. Whatever it may be, Shirone will leave the research group. And for the time being, he will have consultations with me. If you guys care about your friend, just accept it. The most important thing right now is Shirone\u2019s mental state.\u201dNade had a sad expression.\u201cIsn\u2019t that just the academy\u2019s decision? I, the president of his research group, don\u2019t agree.\u201dSiena\u2019s eyes hardened.\u201cIf you think that\u2019s loyalty, it\u2019s not, Nade. You don\u2019t know how scary Overflow is, I\u2019m sure Yiruki understands.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cNo. I think it\u2019s weird, too. Shirone will handle whatever happens. I\u2019m glad you worry, but I don\u2019t know why you would worry to this extent.\u201dHis words sounded cold, but this was why they were friends.The fact that Shirone, the main person involved, was not upset by his words proved that their way of thinking was based on the same rationality.\u201cSo you\u2019re saying it\u2019s okay for Shirone to go crazy?\u201d\u201cI mean, that ain\u2019t the worst outcome. But rather than that, I think Shirone can overcome it. Isn\u2019t it something he has to face sooner or later if he wants to become the best?\u201dNade took the baton.\u201cI agree. Sometimes, I think you are too partial to Shirone. We don\u2019t really care, but Shirone himself might be feeling quite pressured. Sometimes, I even wonder if you see Shirone as a man.\u201dSiena did not back down.\u201cIf you think that way, let\u2019s leave it that way. With that, I can be in charge of Shirone now, right?\u201dEven an instructor could not arbitrarily withdraw a student from a research group unless they broke a rule.In this instance, the decision made by the president of the research group was more important than the management committee, so she had to get Nade\u2019s approval somehow.\u201cStop trying to push it through unreasonable means. Is it right for an instructor to see their own student as a potential love interest?\u201d\u201cYou were the one who brought it up first, not me. As long as there is a male and a female, isn\u2019t there a possibility?\u201dNade\u2019s anger percentage increased at Siena\u2019s strategy of twisting the facts despite knowing what was true.\u201cFine. Then you see me as a male too, right?\u201d\u201cNo. Not in a million years.\u201d\u201c...What are you doing right now?\u201dNade stood up with an absurd expression.\u201cYou know what you\u2019re saying is inconsistent, right? First, you say there is a possibility, but the next second, you change your words.\u201d\u201cProbability depends on probability. I like nice and honest men. If you don\u2019t understand what that means, I\u2019ll simplify it. There is a 0% chance of me seeing you as a man since you\u2019re acting like a kleptocrat.\u201d\u201c \u2026Teacher, can I get wounded by what you just said?\u201d\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. Listen carefully. Don\u2019t think of trapping me this way. I don\u2019t see a student as anything more than a student, but even if you think differently, I don\u2019t care. Shirone needs constant surveillance. You guys are the ones insisting on having things go your way.\u201dNade went speechless and was replaced by Yiruki.\u201cI know what you are concerned about, but if he can\u2019t overcome Overflow, then that\u2019s just his limit. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s gonna die. Shouldn\u2019t trusting Shirone be the first thing we do?\u201d\u201cNot gonna die? We\u2019re talking about Immortal Function here. There is no guarantee that the worst won\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. However, in our current situation, where nothing is definite, I think you are overly worried. That\u2019s not attention, it\u2019s obsession.\u201d\u201cObsession?\u201dSiena froze.The reason why she couldn\u2019t immediately refute was because she knew.\u2018Obsession.\u2019\u2013Siena, let\u2019s get out of here.Overflow was the incident that left trails of scars and regrets she would never forget.In exchange for reaching out his hand and saving her, the boy lost his light forever.\u201cPutting together the opinions of my instructor and friends, I think it is something that I have to decide on.\u201dShirone opened his mouth to talk.\u201cTo be honest, I wavered after hearing Ms. Siena. I\u2019m scared. The nightmares I have every night\u2026 The possibility that my mind might collapse.\u201dPulling away from her past thoughts, Siena said.\u201cThat\u2019s why you should\u2014\u201d\u201cHowever, another part of me is happy.\u201d\u201cWhat I\u2019m experiencing now doesn\u2019t happen to just anyone. Every time I have a nightmare, I\u2019m afraid, but in a corner of my heart, I want to maintain this a little while longer. Maybe there is a secret that hasn\u2019t been discovered yet. Something I can find.\u201d\u201cWhat if something goes wrong?\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll go around cursing and blaming anyone. I don\u2019t want to run with my tail tucked between my legs just because I\u2019m scared. I will pull it off by analyzing and exploring my situation to the end. I will definitely overcome it.\u201dSiena was staring straight into Shirone\u2019s eyes. He was honest. She realized he meant it and dropped her head.\u2018You are really alike.\u2019The person who had pulled her out of the darkness and into the light had said the same thing.\u2013Siena, you gotta stare properly. Closing your eyes won\u2019t change anything.\u2013Go away, brother! You don\u2019t know anything!At the time, If she had harbored the same level of courage as Shirone, wouldn\u2019t that terrible accident have been avoided?\u201cOkay.\u201dSiena fixed her expression and pushed up her glasses.\u201cI understand your thoughts. I respect Shirone\u2019s opinion and won\u2019t place his withdrawal as the condition.\u201d\u201cNo, before that, when will you ever plan on respecting the president\u2019s opinion? Hm? I\u2019m the president. The present president of this group.\u201d\u201cHohoho, I don\u2019t think you have the leisure to joke around. One month from now. If you fail to produce research results the academy approves of, you will return your lab, and the Supernatural Psychic Research Society will be disbanded. Even though there were a lot of incidents, didn\u2019t this research group produce many graduates? That proud achievement may end with your generation.\u201dNade's face turned sickly pale.\u2018Now that I think about it\u2026\u2019It wouldn\u2019t end with a simple disbanding.The generations of troublemakers from the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group broke the academy\u2019s expectations and were currently occupying various key positions in the mage society.In particular, Garold Mikeah, the current president of the Magic Association, was their pride.How could they face those figures if the research group ended in their generation?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55\u201cHow can you do this to us so suddenly? And disbanding a research group doesn\u2019t happen with the snap of a finger, you know?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, but wouldn\u2019t the result of the research presentation clear things up? If it turns out to be a mess to the extent your laboratory is confiscated, I\u2019m sure the Management Committee will think differently. Of course, I\u2019ll be the one to propose the idea.\u201dNade shouted.\u201cTeacher!\u201d\u201cYou want to go back to base one? Isn\u2019t this a much better proposition than placing Shirone\u2019s withdrawal as the condition?\u201d\u201cEukk\u2026\u2026\u201dNade held his head.Even though they were given a month, the fact that the faculty wanted to disband the research group could not be ignored.The Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group had never done an official presentation, even in the past. How could they logically explain ghosts or gods? They didn\u2019t even know if those things existed.Driven to a corner, Nade chose to throw all his pride and honor away and clung to Siena.\u201cMs. Siena! Please, give us a chance. Is there any other option other than the presentation? I know that this research group\u2019s existence alone is significant. We are the only research group that can strike a blow at the mage society that only believes in logic.\u201d\u201cSo I\u2019m telling you to please do\u00a0something\u00a0special. We\u2019ve been lax with you so far. Now it's your turn to prove yourselves. This has already been mentioned to the Instructor\u2019s Committee, so I hope you guys make the right decision.\u201dAs Siena stood up abruptly, the three followed suit.\u201cMs. Siena! Wai\u2014\u201dThe iron door closed with a bang, and with that Shirone and his friends plopped down on the sofa.Their minds were blank as if they had woken up from a dream.\u201cWe\u2019re doomed.\u201dClank. Clank.Estas\u2019 engine system started to return the laboratory to its original position.* * *A peaceful holiday.Shirone typically stayed in the library, even on his days off, but today he was holding a drink and looking forward in a daze.It was the same for Yiruki and Nade, who were both sitting next to him, sandwiching him.\u201cHey, what time is it?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know. I know it\u2019s not night though.\u201d\u201cWow. Amazing. Didn\u2019t know we had a genius sitting next to us.\u201dThen silence.Shirone sighed. Then two others sighed shortly after.Shirone, who could not handle it, leaped up and shouted.\u201cWhat are we gonna do about our research group? Shouldn\u2019t we be using this time to at least come up with a topic to present?\u201dYiruki spoke.\u201cYeah, let\u2019s think. What research project would be approved by the academy?\u201dNade shook his head.\u201cFrom what I know, the research group has never done a presentation. Ever. We have done unique, unusual things, but there\u2019s no way the academy will acknowledge that as \u2018official\u2019 anyways.\u201dThey didn\u2019t know how to get supernatural psychic science acknowledged as a legitimate field of study.The three were in a daze.They turned their heads back and forth to follow the movements of students passing by, but their heads were actually blank.\u201cHey guys, look at her.\u201dNade was pointing at the beauty who was heading to the front gate.She had a trench coat on and wore heels. She had purple hair that fluttered down to her waist.\u201cLooking through a biological viewpoint, those are some good designs. Who is sge?\u201d\u201cIs she an Advanced Class senior? Kids our age don\u2019t typically wear that kind of stuff.\u201dWhile his friends continued chatting, Shirone squinted his eyes to have a better look at the woman. She looked familiar.\u201cWait\u2026 Isn\u2019t that Ms. Siena?\u201d\u201cWhat? Ms. Siena?\u201dYiruki and Nade stared at her.It certainly was. Her hair was neatly tied up, and she wore no glasses, but it was no doubt Siena Olifer.\u201cWow, how can a person change so much?\u201d\u201cI know, right? She\u2019s a completely different person with makeup on. But Shirone, you have a good eye for girls.\u201dThe reason why Shirone recognized Siena was because he had seen her with untied hair before.But Shirone knew better than to expose the fact that she had visited him late at night to his friends.\u201cHaha! I just have good eyesight.\u201d\u201cWhere is she going? She even has makeup on. Maybe she\u2019s attending an important meeting.\u201dYiruki tapped his chin and said.\u201cAccording to Ms. Siena\u2019s daily schedule provided by the Female Body Research Group, she is off duty today. She has no events both inside and outside the academy. Now, that only leaves one possibility\u2026 She\u2019s going on a date.\u201d\u201cDate? No way. You know Ms. Siena\u2019s personality.\u201d\u201cStill, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s at least seeing someone. She\u2019s 26. The pressure her family must be putting on her\u2026 It\u2019s probably no joke.\u00a0 And her seeing someone isn\u2019t going to lower the value of the Olifer\u2019s name or anything.\u201d\u201cHmm, is that so\u2026\u201dNade was rubbing his chin when his friends\u2019 eyes suddenly shined.\u201cShould we follow her?\u201d\u201cThen what? What are we gonna do after?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do, anyway. Nothing will come from us sitting here wracking our brains for something. And be honest, you guys are curious too right? It\u2019s our day off anyways, so we just have to be back before the sun sets.\u201dYiruki was skeptical.\u201cCan we follow without being caught? She\u2019s a Grade 6 mage. Her eyes alone are not comparable to the average human\u2019s eyes. And don\u2019t even get me started with her Spirit Zone. We\u2019ll get caught real quick.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s do this. Yiruki, you track down teacher while Shirone takes over as the middle man. Keep track of her while I stop by the lab.\u201dShirone saw through Nade\u2019s plan.\u201cInvisibility cloak?\u201d\u201cExactly. If we follow with the invisibility cloak, even teacher won\u2019t notice. What do you think?\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]* * *Yiruki finally showed interest.\u201cTailing a certified Grade 6 mage. Sounds fun. I\u2019ll leave now. Shirone, you pick up Nade in the middle.\u201dNot even waiting for a reply, Yiruki got moving towards the front gate while Shirone let out a sigh.\u2018Seriously, they excel in execution\u2026\u2019Nade got ready to set off.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll leave this up to you Shirone. You have the most important role. You can regulate the movement and distance, right?\u201dSince the direction of the city was divided into artificial structures called roads, you could determine the approximate location by checking the Points. The Point was used to locate the middle confluence site.Shirone could do nothing but nod.Even in this situation, he didn\u2019t like that he had already finished the calculations in his head.\u201cAlright, alright. You have to come quickly, though. You can\u2019t take more than 10 minutes.\u201d\u201cHaha! As expected of Shirone! I believe you!\u201dWhile Nade left for the research lab, Shirone followed behind Yiruki for seven minutes. Then he quickly returned to the front gate, picked up Nade, and ran for five minutes along the road he had memorized. Yiruki greeted them once they had caught up.Nade asked immediately.\u201cWhere\u2019s Ms. Siena?\u201d\u201cShe turned right at the bakery, so she must be heading to the commoner\u2019s district. We should be able to catch up.\u201d\u201cCommoner\u2019s district?\u201dIt was a different route than what they had expected, but the important thing was to go wherever Siena went.They were on the move when Nade asked.\u201cWhy the commoner\u2019s district? Dates are usually done in the aristocratic district. Is she meeting a commoner?\u201d\u201cWho knows? But there\u2019s something else that\u2019s strange. She\u2019s too on guard. She was constantly paying attention to her surroundings. Good thing I was watching through the corners of my eyes, otherwise, I would have been caught.\u201d\u201cThings are getting exciting! Perhaps she\u2019s earning under-the-table money through prohibited items like us?\u201dShirone just stared blankly at Nade as if he couldn't lose any more brain cells.\u201cTeacher doesn\u2019t do things like that.\u201d\u201cTsk! Whatever. We can protect the research group if we discover such scenes.\u201dYiruki pointed to Siena who was far away.\u201cFound her. That was close.\u201dThe three wore invisibility cloaks in the commoner\u2019s district.The road was crowded with people who came to do early business. This made it easier for them to tail Siena.The place Siena arrived at was a two-story house.The three poked their heads out the corner of a building and watched to see who would open the door.As soon as Siena started looking around, the three heads quickly disappeared from the corner of the building.\u2018She is so cautious. Whose house is it for her to be like that? It\u2019s just a normal home.\u2019When the three gave in to their curiosity and pulled out their heads once again, a blond man opened the door and came out.He awkwardly gave Siena a hug and led her inside the house.The door closed behind them, and Shirone and his friends stared at it for a good ten seconds.\u201c \u2026It\u2019s a man. Right, guys\u2026? That was a man, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. But isn\u2019t it weird? That means they're dating, but why be so cautious?\u201d\u201cIs it because he\u2019s a commoner? She\u2019s from the House of Olifer. Disapprovals must be no joke.\u201dShirone had a different opinion.\u201cThey didn\u2019t seem like a couple to me. What should I say? There was an underlying awkwardness?\u201dAfter hearing that, Yiruki and Nade were somewhat convinced what Shirone said was true.In the midst of them just standing there, Nade made a suggestion.\u201cShould we go in and check?\u201d\u201cWhat?! But it\u2019s a stranger\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cI just smell something suspicious. As you said, there\u2019s no reason for Ms. Siena to be so vigilant. There\u2019s no one in the academy who knows about this. Even that tenacious Female Body Research Group has no articles about this. That must mean she was very discreet.\u201dThey would have given up if it weren\u2019t for the invisibility cloaks.\u201cSo what are you planning?\u201d\u201cWe could enter using the underground warehouse. Even if we get caught, I mean, what's the worst thing that could happen? And plus, it\u2019s Ms. Siena who went in, so technically he\u2019s not a random stranger to us, her students.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t just give up here. Our research group is on the line here. We need to grasp any string of hope. Wait here. I\u2019m the president, so I\u2019ll be responsible for us if we get caught.\u201dArriving at the entrance to the underground warehouse, Nade examined the iron door.Shirone asked a question when Nade took out a gadget the size of a wine opener from his pocket.\u201cWhat is that?\u201dYiruki answered instead.\u201cNade\u2019s patent-pending invention, the Master Key. It pressurizes the internal system of locks. It can capture the springs of the lock up to a hundredth of a centimeter. Unless the lock was created using a master artisan\u2019s bearing method, the key can unlock pretty much anything. The bearing method is a type of lock in which the ball is caught in the housing of the lock. So even a little bit of excessive force causes the ball to slide and\u2026\u201d\u201cDone.\u201dNade unlocked the lock before Yiruki could finish his explanation. He opened the door, and the smell of vegetables made its way into their noses.\u201cIt\u2019s a food storehouse. I can go through here.\u201dWhen Nade climbed the ladder, Shirone followed him and said.\u201cWait. I can\u2019t send you alone. We\u2019ll go with.\u201dIf Shirone couldn\u2019t stop Nade, then the least he could do was try to make sure they wouldn\u2019t get caught.The last one to enter was Yiruki, who closed the iron door behind them.During that time, Nade observed the atmosphere.\u201cIt\u2019s quiet. Let\u2019s head up.\u201dThe three had their invisibility cloaks on and the only thing remaining was their three heads that floated in midair.PR/N: Essentially, Imagine an old-school cloak. They can\u2019t hide their faces as they\u2019d have no way to see, hence why there are \u201cfloating heads\u201d.A floor with an integrated living room and kitchen appeared. A furnace was installed in the center.As they climbed up the wooden stairs and arrived on the second floor, they heard talking from the room right around the corner.Shirone quietly tiptoed near the door with his friends and leaned his ear against it.He heard Siena\u2019s voice.\u201cWhat are you doing? Hurry up.\u201dSurprised, Shirone and Nade made a fuss using their facial muscles. Yiruki put his finger against his lips and looked at them.A moment later, a male\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cWait. I\u2019m not ready. First, take off your clothes.\u201d\u201cWhen is your wife coming back?\u201d\u201cShe went grocery shopping at the market. Today\u2019s the third day of the month, so it\u2019ll take over 2 hours.\u201dNade was attacked with another round of shock.No, he looked more appalled than shocked.\u2018What??? Wh-What is going on?!\u2019Shirone had the same thought.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56\u2018No way. How could this be? Ms. Siena, the symbol of integrity, is\u2026?\u201dThe shock was great as they trusted her character.Nade tried hard to think positively.\u2018Yeah, no. This will benefit us. We can save our research group with this. We have an excuse to make a deal\u2026\u2019Then, they heard Siena\u2019s voice.\u201cNot wearing it today?\u201d\u201cI just have this feeling. Raise your lower back a little more.\u201d\u201cLike this?\u201d\u201cYes. And your legs slightly this way. Yes, that's good.\u201dShirone and his friends\u2019 faces flushed red.It was common knowledge that adults expressed their affection\u2026 This way. But this was an affair.\u2018I can\u2019t let this be.\u2019Nade bit his lips, and when he turned back to look at his friends, they nodded their heads as if to agree.\u201cThen I\u2019ll begin.\u201dAs soon as they heard the male\u2019s voice, Nade, whose eyes were on fire, turned the doorknob and barged through.\u201cMs. Siena! We\u2019re so disappointed!\u201dShirone and Yiruki followed behind, with one of each eye shut closed.There was silence.Shirone slowly turned his head and looked, beginning with the corner of the room, and he was surprised to see what he saw.\u201cEh?\u201dHe saw Siena sitting upright on the bed, while a large canvas was standing on the other side.\u201cHuh? HUUUH???\u201dShirone\u2019s companions could only open and close their mouths repeatedly.The same thought crossed their minds.\u2018We\u2019re in deep shit now.\u2019They weren\u2019t the only ones surprised.\u201cWhat? How did you guys\u2026?\u201dNothing could be more embarrassing than running into your students while in a personal situation.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026 You guys followed me?\u201d\u201cYes? No, that\u2019s not\u2026 Well, what happened was we were just sitting in the park, you know? Then you passed by us real suddenly. So\u2026\u201d\u201cThat means you did tail me!!!\u201d\u201cEEEEK! I\u2019m sorry!\u201dShirone and his partners in crime closed their eyes tightly.Knowing Siena\u2019s personality, things wouldn\u2019t end with just a harsh scolding.However, contrary to their expectations, no burning meteors or snow the size of baseballs fell on them.When the three slowly opened their eyes, they saw Siena lost in thought.\u2018How did they follow me?\u2019She had kept her guard up to the fullest on her way here.She had not entered the Spirit Zone, but her ability to perceive was not sloppy enough not to catch a few students shadowing her.She was sure that the answers she was looking for would be behind the students.\u201cWhat are you hiding? Give it here.\u201dNade had a fearful look on his face and violently shook his head.But with one murderous look from Siena, Nade quickly held out the cloak he was hiding with an expression as if someone had kicked his puppy.Though, his wit remained until the very end, so he didn\u2019t forget to turn the cloak inside-out.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dShe saw a dirty cloak and wrinkled her face. But soon after, she saw what it truly was.This was because the arm holding the cloak seemed to disappear the moment she turned the cloak right-side out.When she wrapped it around her waist like a skirt, her lower body disappeared.\u201cInvisibility cloak?\u201dSiena finally realized the whole story and glared at Nade as if she wanted to swallow him whole.\u201cNade, is this also one of the items you patented?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd you really made it yourself?\u201d\u201cB-But I didn\u2019t put it out on the black market! I have a conscience!\u201d\u201cHaaah\u2026\u201dThe students flinched the moment Siena sighed.However, she no longer nagged at them.Considering she was a Grade 6 mage, she blamed her own lack of skill for not catching on.\u201cIf you knew you were going to get caught, why did you come inside this room? And what did you mean by \u2018disappointed?\u2019\u201dShirone said with a slight tremble in his voice.\u201cAt first, we tailed you for fun, but when we saw you hugging a man, we followed you in. And the conversation led to what we believed was an affair, so we just\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? An affair?\u201dSiena\u2019s face turned red.They had never seen her so flustered\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018affair\u2019! Me? An affair?! How could you have such a thought?!\u201dNade snapped back.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]* * *\u201cHow could we not! Each word of that conversation was very suspicious! And who is he, anyway?\u201dNade pointed to the man who was still hidden behind the canvas.The chair the mysterious man sat on made a squeak.\u201cAre you talking about me?\u201dA voice warm enough to soften a heart was heard.A moment later, his face was revealed. The three mischievous students froze.He was a handsome man in his late 20s. He had long blond hair that stretched down to his waist.But what really surprised them was not his looks, it was the worn-out cloth wrapped around his eyes.\u2018This person\u2026\u2019He was a blind artist.As soon as Shirone realized that, the Mourning Sensation that was being a bother hit him with great intensity.\u2018Heuk!!\u2019His hairs were raised to their ends, and his bones felt like they were freezing all over.When he clasped his hand that was shaking by the wrist, Nade thought Shirone was scared, so he just patted Shirone on the back.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. She won\u2019t kill us. I\u2019ll take the responsibility.\u201d\u201cEh? No, that\u2019s not it\u2026\u201dShirone gradually regained a relaxed expression.It was an extreme chill that could not be compared to the usual that he experienced, but it also disappeared really quickly.\u201cSiena, please stop and forgive them. I don\u2019t know the circumstances, but it looks like they are your students.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying? That makes me want to forgive them less. The tailing I can let go, but they broke into someone else\u2019s house. Gosh, they only know bad things.\u201dThe man smiled kindly.\u201cBut they\u2019re your students. Their teacher was inside, so they must\u2019ve thought it would be okay if they got caught.\u201dIt was as if he had read Nade\u2019s mind.\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s really why we did it. Shirone doesn\u2019t lie, so you can ask him. We would never have broken in if it was a stranger\u2019s house. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re petty thieves.\u201dShirone also nodded his head.\u201cYes. Nade really told me that. That\u2019s definitely what he said.\u201dSiena held her head with troubled thoughts.They probably weren\u2019t lying, but she almost found those big, innocent eyes giving her the look despicable.\u2018They even used an invisibility cloak to tail me? They are very shrewd indeed\u2026\u2019Despite the situation, the man only smiled.More than anything else, he was happy to meet with Siena\u2019s students.\u201cI am Armin. Siena and I are like brother and sister. I studied at the Olifer Academy.\u201dNade grasped tightly onto the hand Armin put out.\u201cAha, I see. I\u2019m sorry for our brainless misunderstanding. And I\u2019m also sorry for visiting without any notice.\u201dSiena exclaimed.\u201cWhat \u2018visit\u2019?! It\u2019s a break-in!\u201d\u201cHehe. That\u2019s why I\u2019m apologizing. To be honest, I feel happy that the misunderstanding about you has been resolved.\u201dSiena placed her hands on her hips and snorted\u201cFirst, have a seat and continue your conversation. I\u2019ll prepare tea.\u201dArmin caught on quickly and left the room.He surprised Shirone\u2019s group again when he walked out of the door with a precise gait even though he couldn\u2019t see.\u201cMs. Siena, who in the world is that? Are you guys really just brother and sister?\u201d\u201cBrother Armin is an alumnus. He was also the greatest talent in the history of the Olifer Academy. Though as you can see, he is an artist now.\u201d\u201cHe sounds like an incredible person. I\u2019m not sure if I can ask you this, but what happened to his eyes\u2026?\u201dSiena\u2019s face darkened.Nade felt he had asked an unnecessary question.Fortunately, however, her expression soon relaxed and she spoke calmly.\u201cTo save me. That is why he lost his eyes.\u201d\u201c To save you?\u201d\u201cAt the age of nine, I experienced Overflow. I was studying the theory of energy absorption when one day, I received an enlightenment that can\u2019t be put into words.\u201dSiena gave a bitter, tight-lipped smile.\u201cThe person to save me was Brother Armin. He used to say to me \u2018Don\u2019t turn away from your fears. Turning your head away from it won\u2019t change anything. Do you know how old he was back then? He was 11 years old, just two years older than me.\u201dSaving Siena from Overflow at that young age was an indication of how talented he was.\u201cDid you overcome Overflow with Mr. Armin\u2019s help?\u201d\u201cNo. I was not that strong of a child. I was a proud little kid who received special treatment just because she was born into the Olifer family. At the time, I didn\u2019t like my brother because he always habitually said to face fear head-on. I didn\u2019t want to do that. It was scary. I couldn\u2019t help but close my eyes. I thought he was pretending to know me even though he didn\u2019t. I was really ignorant then.\u201dShirone could not image Siena, a certified Grade 6 mage, crying in fear.\u201cI used to avoid Brother Armin by going out to the mountains, fields, and river sides. He would always find me, but whenever that happened, I would run away. One day, while continuing with the strange game of tag\u2026 The incident occurred.\u201dShe still remembered that day clearly.\u201cIt was the rainy season, and it had been pouring for several days nonstop. Even under such weather, I was wandering by the riverside. There wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if not for the dam collapsing at that exact moment. An enormous amount of water swept through the lowlands. It was a flood that sank half of the village.\u201dSiena started reminiscing.The young Siena, who was swept away by the water current, could not even scream for help.She struggled for her life. That was what helped her stay alive. But when she came up to the surface, she saw a completely different scene from what she had known before.The pieces of buildings and livestock were being washed away from the upper stream. Jagged trees that were broken were floating downstream.This was the first time she ever feared death.\u2018Help me. Someone, please\u2026!\u2019Her body was quickly swept away. Land seemed so far away, and the usual streamlet where she used to pick up pebbles transformed into a large torrent 25 meters wide.The color of the water was dark. So dark, it was almost black.The current flowing downstream rapidly formed a whirlpool as it collided against rocks and boulders.\u201cHelp me! Someone, please help me!\u201dDespite studying under the esteemed name of Olifer, all she could do was scream for help endlessly.\u201cSiena!\u201dShe pushed up her head with all her might as if she had heard a revelation from god.Armin was waiting on top of a tree branch that was dangerously bent at an angle.\u201cBrother! Brother!\u201d\u201cYour hand! Give me your hand!\u201dSiena stretched out her arms desperately.However, due to a sudden rocky current, she became submerged.\u201cSiena!\u201dArmin flung his body and dived head first.A few seconds later, he came up with Siena in his arms.\u201cSiena! Hang in there! We have to get out of here!\u201d\u201cS-Save me! Help!\u201dArmin managed to escape the whirlpool zone by a hair\u2019s width, but after looking around, he couldn\u2019t help but be disheartened.The only thing awaiting them was a hellish torrent.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Infinite MageCH 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Oh no.\u2019Armin was only 11 years old at the time, so he could only expand his Spirit Zone and avoid obstacles.\u201cSiena! Open your eyes! You can\u2019t lose your mind!\u201d\u201cBrother! S-save\u2026!\u2019Siena could not calm down.It was impossible for the two young kids to cross the river with their physical abilities.Armin realized he had to do it alone.\u2018We just have to get to the Delphons region like this. It becomes a delta from there, so the volume of water will decrease. At the speed we\u2019re going now, we will be there in about 20 minutes.\u201920 minutes was too long.Could he hold out from the rapid currents with a semiconscious Siena?\u2018How stupid.\u2019Of course, he had to do it. He had no choice but to do it.His view was dimming. He was starting to see scenery that was distorted strangely.They approached countless life-threatening objects.Armin twisted his body with all his might.He did not let his eyes stray away from the sight in front of him, even as muddy water pained his eyes, his body slammed against rocks, and broken trees tore his skin.\u2018Almost there.\u2019He felt Siena\u2019s tiny hand pinch his waist.He felt extremely pressured knowing that a fragile life depended on him. But because of that, a greater sense of duty awakened in his mind.He saw their destination lower down the stream.However, there was no path. Trees that broke towards the river were brutally blocking their way to the delta.\u201cSiena, listen up. We have to pass under those trees. I will press you down, so you have to hold your breath for as long as you can. Swim as fast and as far as possible, okay?\u201d\u201cBrother! I\u2019m scared! I can\u2019t do it!\u201d\u201cYou can do it! You have to!\u201dAs they passed between two whirlpools, the speed of the current doubled.In the unexpected situation, Armin grit his teeth.With only his head and neck above the water, all the debris as a result of the flood came at him like a behemoth.He was trying to stay afloat so hard to the point he could feel a cramp coming to attack his legs.Sharp objects scratched Armin\u2019s body as they passed by him. He was bleeding profusely.His body temperature began to fall even faster. He was slowly losing consciousness.Finally, they arrived at the tree that was blocking their way.\u201cSiena! Here we go!\u201dArmin calculated the distance and waited for the perfect timing.Right as they were about to collide, he pressed down Siena\u2019s shoulders.\u201cNow!\u201dSiena\u2019s scream was drowned by the water. And Armin, who was barely holding on to his consciousness, noticed that the sharp base of a wet tree was getting bigger and bigger.Even with that danger, he concentrated all his nerves on the hand that was pushing Siena under.It wasn\u2019t until Siena got under enough trees that his hand went slack.\u2018Good job, Sie\u2014\u2019CRASH!At the same time as Armin smiled faintly, his face smashed into the tree\u2026Despite knowing he could lose everything, he still did not close his eyes.\u201cBROTHERRRR!\u201dHe heard the sound of Siena\u2019s voice fading down the stream.* * *\u201c...That\u2019s what happened.\u201dShirone and his friends were at a loss for words.\u201cI was rescued by the villagers after being safely washed away to the Delphons region. There weren\u2019t any hurdles after I passed the woody area. Later, Brother Armin was also found. He was unconscious. People from the academy were mobilized to treat him, but the diagnosis was permanent eye damage. After the incident, Brother lost his eyesight.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 So that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\u201cHe personally taught me how to overcome fear. Thanks to him, I overcame Overflow\u2026 But the price for doing so was his light. He went from being the greatest genius in the history of the academy to\u2026 It ended just like that.\u201dShirone\u2019s heart felt heavy.For a human to lose their vision\u2026 It was no exaggeration to say it was like losing almost everything.One couldn\u2019t read books, and learning magic was bound to be more difficult and restrictive. He could tell how disappointed and distressed Armin must have been.\u201cI recently found out that my brother came here three years ago. He told me he\u2019s developing a style of painting that involves drawing light. That\u2019s why I volunteered to be his model.\u201cWe didn\u2019t even know that\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201dArmin brought in refreshments just as the atmosphere was about to get dark.\u201cDid I interrupt? It\u2019s rare for Siena to talk about her past like this.\u201d\u201cBrother.\u201d\u201cFirst, here\u2019s the tea. It\u2019s not the best, but it is my wife\u2019s secret recipe, so I think you will find it to your liking.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dShirone and the others politely took the tea.Armin returned to his canvas and offered some seats behind it.\u201cThen first things first, I will have to continue my work, so could my visitors wait here?\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201dThe three held their teacups and wobbled over.Seeing Siena return to her position on the bed, Nade cautiously asked.\u201cUm\u2026 What did you mean by \u2018Not wearing it today?\u2019 If it\u2019s like a nude, we\u2019ll be happy to get ou\u2014\u201d\u201cHaha! Even though I can\u2019t see, I would never ask my sister to do that. Siena, can you bring that thing out?\u201dSiena took a foil coat out of the closet. It was hard to even look at it because of how much light it reflected.\u201cThat\u2019s very bright.\u201d\u201cI cannot accurately see objects using the Spirit Zone alone, so I cover a person or an object with a luminous body so that I can feel the light. In that sense, the foil coat is a very useful tool.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 But wow\u2026 To draw by feeling light.\u201d\u201cIn return for losing my eyes, I am able to draw things other artists cannot. However, today is the last time I will be drawing Siena. A good sponsor has appeared, so I have to move out in a few days. That is why I didn\u2019t want her to wear the coat. I wanted to draw the natural feel of her without the coat discoloring her beauty.\u201dSiena\u2019s cheeks warmed.\u201cYou\u2019re so\u2026 What nonsense.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cHaha! So what? You\u2019re still a 9-year-old child in my head.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. Just draw it quickly. After Mrs. Keria comes back, you won\u2019t be able to work.\u201dShirone and his companions\u2019 fingers and toes squirmed at the subtle and warm, yet awkward atmosphere they felt.It was clear that they were like brothers and sisters, but the same blood did not flow through them.Maybe the reason why Siena reacted more extremely at the mention of the affair was because she still had lingering feelings for Armin.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll begin. I\u2019m just drawing what comes to me, so it\u2019s going to end earlier than usual.\u201dAs Siena took a modest posture, Armin picked up the charcoal and began to draw the outline.When Siena\u2019s appearance gradually became more concrete, the party of three could only admire.\u201cWow, so fast.\u201d\u201cShhh.\u201dYiruki warnedBeing unable to see was a fatal drawback for an artist, so Armin would require more concentration than the usual artist.Of course, there was that plausible thought, but Shirone found something odd.\u2018That\u2019s weird. Very weird.\u201dEven without the luminescence, Armin was accurately capturing even the smallest of details of Siena.\u2018How is this possible? Does that mean his Spirit Zone is that precise? But even so\u2026\u2019Increasing the density and specific gravity of the Spirit Zone may enable precise descriptions through synesthesia. However, Shirone couldn\u2019t understand how even the feelings from Siena\u2019s expression were captured in the drawing.The art became more detailed, and Siena was wearing a smile that could not be seen at the academy.Amrin perfectly embodied her smile using bread like an eraser.Shirone was almost certain.\u2018I see. This is impossible.\u2019One of the most difficult parts of portraits was the corner of the mouth. This was because even a very subtle change in angle completely changes the feeling of the art.\u201cUm, Mr. Armin.\u201d\u201c...?\u201dAs Armin smiled and turned his head slightly, Shirone thought for a moment whether he could ask such a question.If he was wrong, his question would be extremely impolite.\u201cPerhaps, does Mr. Armin\u2026\u201dHowever, without asking, nothing could be known, so Shirone mustered up the courage.\u201cCan you see?\u201dStill wearing that smile of his, Armin\u2019s hand froze midair.He put down the charcoal and twisted his body.\u201cYes, I can see.\u201dShirone was at a loss for words.Did he really mean that he could see with his eyes? But why didn\u2019t Ms. Siena know of this?\u201cYou must be curious. Why don\u2019t I just show you myself.\u201dWith his body facing Shirone, Armin untied the piece of cloth wrapped around his eyes.There were numerous scars around his wrapped eyes.\u2018I\u2019m positive he was hurt, but how can he see? No, he had his eyes covered in the first place. And yet\u2026\u2019At that moment, Armin slowly lifted his eyelids and Shirone felt his heart stop.There were no pupils. It wasn\u2019t quite a substitute, but the empty socket where the eye should be was filled with light.\u201cN-Nade, can you see that?\u201dShirone slapped Nade\u2019s leg in a hurry.However, when he hit Nade, he felt as if he had hit a hard metal instead.Shirone turned his head and looked at his friends. He jumped to his feet in horror.\u201cNo way! How?!\u201dNade was frozen stiff. Not even his eyelids were moving.Even Yiruki, who was resting his chin on his hand, and Siena, who was sitting on the bed with a smile. They were motionless like wax dolls.Armin approached from behind Shirone, who was in a panicked state.\u201cIt has been a long time since a guest visited my room.\u201d\u201cIs this\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s a spell called Stop.\u201dThe bewildered look returned to Shirone\u2019s face.Stop was a spell that only mages who could handle super-light speed could cast, and throughout the entirety of history, only a select few were known to have reached such a level.In short, Shirone was experiencing the absolute realm of Time magic.\u201cHave a seat. Let\u2019s relax and talk since we have plenty of time.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 Haha.\u201dShirone gave an awkward laugh.If time had actually stopped, then \u2018plenty of time\u2019 was an understatement.\u201cActually, I\u2019ve been quite nervous for a while now because I didn\u2019t know when you would notice.\u201d\u201cHow did you know I would notice?\u201dArmin pointed to the light in his eye socket.\u201cThe organ called the eye takes in light and reconstructs it into visual information. But I, who is without eyes, feel the world through light itself. And it\u2019s quite a horrific experience. What I see is completely different from how ordinary people perceive the form of objects.\u201d\u201cSo it is the ideal version of sight, then. No interpretation or reconstruction.\u201dThe human senses were not true and infallible. After all, the human senses could be fooled.\u201cI\u2019ll reintroduce myself. I am Armin of the Eye of Light. Those who know me refer to me as the Mage of Eternal Cintana.\u201d\u2018Eternal Cintana.\u2019As soon as he heard those words, Shirone realized why Armin used the expression \u2018room.\u2019\u201cHow\u2026 How long have you been in this room?\u201d\u201cTime does not flow here, so I cannot answer that. However, if you convert it to the number of thoughts, it should be around 120 years.\u201dShirone couldn\u2019t imagine how strong a genius mage who contemplated and ruminated for 120 years was.\u201cBut when you were young, Mr. Armin\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, it was an unfortunate accident. I left Olifer Academy and wandered aimlessly around the world for 15 years. A pitch black world without even a single ray of light\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 58": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Infinite MageCH 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayArmin recalled the time.\u201cIn the midst of darkness, space is not defined. As space disappeared, so did time. Then I came to the realization that the existence of \u2018me\u2019 already broke away from the concept of time. That is the secret to the omnipotence of using the Stop spell.\u201dShirone\u2019s heart thumped loudly after hearing the key factor to succeeding with the Stop spell that countless mages had failed to conquer.\u201cBut\u2026 Is it okay to tell me something important like this?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s all right. I\u2019ve only told you so that I can help you understand, but the bottom of it is actually quite complicated.\u201d\u2018Of course it is.\u2019\u201cAnd Stop isn\u2019t a particularly transcendent spell. It can only be performed within the radius of the Spirit Zone, and its biggest limitation is that it cannot affect the world.\u201dArmin looked back at Siena.\u201cShe\u2019s a good sister, and a soft-hearted child. Don\u2019t you think so, Shirone?\u201d\u201cHaha! I\u2019m not so sure about the \u2018soft\u2019 part, but one thing that\u2019s certain is she\u2019s really strong. She is a certified Grade 6.\u201d\u201cYes. She is indeed a certified Grade 6 mage. But time has stopped. As such, can we harm the powerful Siena?\u201cAh.\u201dShirone turned to his friends.No matter how it was looked at, they were beyond physical force boundaries.\u201cWhen time stops, energy cannot move. It\u2019s impossible to exchange force.\u201d\u201cYes. The incident itself cannot flow. Let\u2019s say we draw the sequence of explosions on pieces of paper. What if we don\u2019t have a next page? The explosion is kept frozen on the last page.\u201dArmin smiled.\u201cThat is the essence of Stop magic. Time and space are inseparable. It is the same for acceleration and gravity. The mage\u2019s omnipotence senses the super-light speed within the Spirit Zone of the Stop magic. We have talked for a bit right now, but in reality, less than 0.1 seconds have passed. Relatively speaking, we are moving at the speed of light while having a conversation.\u201d\u201cSpeed of light.\u201dShirone looked back at Nade again.\u201cSo that\u2019s why we can\u2019t interfere with Nade since our current mass is zero.\u201dA matter with mass could not reach the super-light speed.\u201cWith omniscience, yes. That\u2019s how it is. Of course, as this is magic, it would have to be combined with omnipotence. It is the mystery of time and space that takes place within the Spirit Zone.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026\u201dShirone suddenly had a question.\u201cWhy are you telling me this?.\u201d\u201cIt is because of that doubt, Shirone.\u201dArmin pulled the strip of cloth tightly around his eyes again.\u201cYou asked how I knew you would notice, right? It is simple. It is because I experienced the same thing you experienced. We both know each other.\u201d\u201cBy the same experience, you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. The Immortal Function.\u201dShirone\u2019s heart thumped widely.There was a person in front of him who experienced the Immortal Function, something no one was able to help with. And he was the greatest time mage, no less.\u201cThe Immortal Function is the realization of the whole. Since the whole is also one, the wavelengths between you and me resonate. That thing is called the Mourning Sensation. Just as you feel from me Shirone, I also feel from you.\u201d\u201c...What is the Immortal Function?\u201d\u201cYou can say it is the gateway to infinity, and you, Shirone, opened that gate. In the mage society, these people are called Unlockers.\u201dShirone, who was thinking for a moment, looked up.\u201cWhat will happen to me?\u201d\u201cIt will be all right. If Shirone still values the world, there is nothing to worry about. However\u2026 Did you feel your ego being scattered when you opened Immortal Function?\u201d\u201cYes, I did! I really thought I was going to disappear.\u201d\u201cIf you had decided to let it, then it would\u2019ve happened. As the Spirit Zone expands to infinity, the mind ceases to exist. It is important for Unlockers to hold that spot. If the mind expands, the power increases, but if you go beyond the point of self-control your ego will be lost in the midst of the uncontrollable sense of freedom. Be sure to bear this in mind. If that happens, there is no turning back.\u201dShirone gulped loudly.\u201cAlso, Unlockers always have to keep in mind the size of their Spirit Zone, in other words, their limit. Do not think you have no limit. Limits exist because we are beings that will eventually die.\u201dShirone mused over his words and asked.\u201cBut other than that, there is another issue. Every night, I see the universe in my dreams. The Mourning Sensation I felt when I met you keeps on coming back without rest. And it\u2019s not like there were any other Unlockers around.\u201dArmin eased Shirone with a smile.\u201cThat is also a natural step. When the door to the Immortal Function was opened, you reached the realm of infinity. You were the entirety of the universe for a brief moment. There, you became aware of something outside of sensation, cognition, and intellect. But your ego is in shock because it cannot interpret what that \u2018something\u2019 is. Once you become aware of what that \u2018something\u2019 is, the feeling will disappear.\u201d\u201cHow do I become aware of what that is?\u201d\u201c It will come naturally. I do not know when that time will come. It could be quick, but it could take a lifetime. Do not worry. You already have it, Shirone. It is just in a state that can\u2019t be named.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dArmin was reminded of his past self as he watched Shirone worry.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll give you a hint. Whatever you become aware of, whatever you realize, it will have something to do with the Gauge Symmetry.\u201d\u201cGauge\u2026 Symmetry?\u201d\u201cHumans think that they themselves are living in a perfectly symmetrical world. As a matter of fact, of course we do. Is there anyone who thinks that having two arms is abnormal, and instead it is normal to have three? Having two arms does not mean that it is absolutely normal, but that is the direction of our existence. However, the universe we are living in is unknown. We do not know the norms of the universe. Perhaps, we humans may never even be able to understand it with our human senses, but\u2026\u201d\u201cIt seems that I reached that unknown. Through something that cannot be named under any of our human senses.\u201dArmin patted Shirone on the head. Siena\u2019s student was indeed an outstanding talent.\u201cThat is why you have no need to worry. I\u2019m not saying to do nothing, but in the end, you merely existing will bring out the identity of the Mourning Sensation. Everything will become clear. You will be able to understand me then.\u201dShirone nodded his head bravely.His thoughts were in disarray, but he knew today\u2019s event would be a huge turning point for his future.\u201cThank you so much. If I didn\u2019t meet you, I would have fallen into Overflow like Ms. Siena said. We actually had a small argument a while back. Now, I feel sorry.\u201dArmin surmised what had happened.\u201cPlease do understand. She must have been very anxious as she experienced those things in her childhood. In fact, she isn\u2019t a child who\u2019s at all cold and stubborn. You\u2019ll understand when you experience it.\u201d\u201cOf course. I know since I always receive her help. She is a really good person.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201c...Is that so?\u201dArmin looked back at the canvas with a relieved smile.\u201cLet\u2019s slowly leave the room. If I keep the time field for too long, I will lose my concentration and may not be able to finish the drawing before my wife returns. I really want to complete it.\u201d\u201cOh, come to think of it, you said today was your last day, right?\u201d\u201cYes. I may have grandiose nicknames, but I am an artist first and foremost. I plan to pack everything up and leave as soon as possible. I won\u2019t be able to see Siena for a while.\u201d\u201cRather, why don\u2019t you reveal\u2026\u201dArmin shook his head.\u201cSiena is still feeling guilty about it. And though I haven\u2019t given up on magic, it does not mean the two eyes I\u2019ve lost have come back. Besides, I\u2019m already wedded. I want to help Siena live her life.\u201dHe did not want to see his precious sister, who he cared for more than his life, tied to the past.\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll keep it a secret too. Thank you so much for today.\u201d\u201cI also enjoyed today, Shirone.\u201dArmin sat in front of the canvas once again, and Shirone returned to his seat.Time started to flow again.He heard Nade and Yiruki breathing, and the brightness in Siena\u2019s smile had returned.Shirone felt like he just woke up from a dream. He still couldn\u2019t believe he had a conversation with Armin.Time passed by in a blur, and Armin showed Siena the finished artwork.\u201cHow is it? Did it come out well?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s pretty.\u201d\u201cThank you for all this time. It was an honor to draw you.\u201d\u201cYou speak as if we\u2019re strangers\u2026\u201dA flash of sadness passed by Siena\u2019s eyes. Then, when she heard the sound of footsteps downstairs, she stood up in surprise and started to leave without even saying a proper goodbye.\u201d\u2018Is his wife already home?\u2019She arrived faster than usual, but Siena didn\u2019t have the time to think deeply about it.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be on my way. You guys as well, come on.\u201dWatching Siena leave as if she was running away, Shirone and his friends couldn\u2019t help but be upset.To be frightened just because Armin\u2019s wife was coming was tantamount to revealing her true feelings.Just as Siena was about to grab the doorknob, the door opened. Armin\u2019s wife\u2019s face poked through the crack.\u201cHoney, are you drawing?\u201dContrary to the expectation that Armin\u2019s wife would be as calm as he was, she was a bubbly woman in her early 20s.She looked surprised when she made eye contact with Siena.\u201cOh, Ms. Siena? Right! Today was the day you were coming.\u201d\u201cHello, Ms. Keira. It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d\u201cIt indeed has Why is it so hard to see your face? Perhaps you are avoiding me on purpose? Hohoho!\u201dSiena tried to hold on to her currently dizzying mind.\u201cAh, I\u2019m done working with my brother. I was just about to head out.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re already here, no need to leave so hurriedly. Have dinner with us.\u201d\u201cI appreciate it, but I have plans\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Something\u2019s suspicious. Honey, did you do anything weird with Ms. Siena while I was away?\u201d\u201cKeira, watch what you\u2019re saying.\u201dArmin shot back with a cold tone, but Keira just shrugged it off.As for Siena, her face was flushed red. She left the room while putting on her coat quickly. One of her arms was still outside of the coat.Shirone and the other two glimpsed at Keira then followed after Siena.Whether she was tactless or simply daring, Keira smiled with her eyes and waved her hand.\u201cBye, kids\u201dOf course, there wasn't any response back, and Keira tilted her head at their cold attitude.\u201cOh my, did I do something wrong? What\u2019s wrong with their expressions? Honey, you really didn\u2019t do anything weird, did you?\u201d\u201cStop with your jokes and come down. I want to at least say goodbye properly.\u201cHmph. When it comes to your sister, you can\u2019t do anything.\u201dArmin technically ran down the stairs.\u201cI\u2019m sorry Siena. She\u2019s a bit unruly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll meet again, so write me letters. And don\u2019t forget to take care of yourself.\u201d\u201cAlright, you work hard, too. Still, seeing as how you are getting along well with your students, I feel relieved. To be honest, I was skeptical about you being a teacher. Hahaha!\u201dSiena smirked.Armin was the only one who could treat her like a child. After all, he was the only one who knew her during her immature days.Shirone watched their touching moment.Now he could see why Siena decided to become an instructor, why she was so obsessed with Overflow, and why she tended to stay away from men.\u201cThen\u2026 I\u2019m really leaving. Take care.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll contact you when things are set. Shirone, Nade, Yiruki. Do your best. I\u2019ll keep an ear out so I can listen to the day I hear your names associated with greatness.\u201d\u201cYes, and I\u2019m sorry again for today.\u201dShirone and his friends expressed their sincerest gratitude. If it weren\u2019t for Armin\u2019s consideration, things wouldn\u2019t have ended this peacefully.Armin watched until the end as the figures of Siena and her student disappeared into the distance.Behind him, Keira was leaning against the door with her arms folded.She spoke with a hard expression on her face.\u201cArmin, snap out of it. We don\u2019t know what will happen if those above see you this emotionally immersed.\u201dArmin turned around and glowered.They lived under the guise of a married couple for the past three years, but she really was a woman he found off-putting.\u201cI feel whatever I want to feel. It\u2019s up to me and not to you. You just care about your reports. Are you done with the investigation?\u201d\u201cWent flawlessly. There\u2019s nothing more to see in Creas. We have to get to Calvera in 15 days, after all. Though, I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be an issue for Armin of the Eye of Light, right?\u201d\u201cThere is no need to talk more than necessary. I\u2019ll keep my promise.\u201dKeira could not relax.She didn\u2019t doubt his skills. She was just wary of Armin because he wasn\u2019t someone you could let your guard down against.\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell Siena, did you?\u201dIt was a natural suspicion for someone who could stop time, but Armin kept his mouth shut.Keira continued after hearing no response.\u201cI don\u2019t want to harm you. Hell, it\u2019s not like I can do anything to the Eternal Cintana. But even so, you\u2019re only human. The moment you betray the organization, everyone you love will experience hell. That includes Siena Olifer.\u201dIt was a terrifying threat, and Keira\u2019s organization had more than enough strength, power, and brutality to be able to do so.Armin was going to protect Siena no matter what.In that sense, he was lucky to meet Shirone. Although he couldn\u2019t stand by her side, it was reassuring to know that she had an Unlocker with a great personality by her side.\u201cNo need to worry.\u201dArmin smiled as he remembered Shirone\u2019s face.\u201cSiena does not know anything.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59During their journey back to the academy from Armin\u2019s house, the three troublemakers were worried.The atmosphere back at the house was good, but they were afraid Siena\u2019s mood would change.Whilst continuing to walk on eggshells, they glanced at Siena from the corner of their eyes, she was just walking without saying anything, and her eyes were glued to the ground.Shirone\u2019s heart felt heavy seeing her down.Had it not been for the childhood accident, they could have developed a good relationship.However, she did not want to blame Armin for suddenly getting married because she knew he had left her alone in order to help her relieve herself of the guilt.Nade grumbled.\u201cTsk. I really can\u2019t understand the relationship between a man and a woman.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t. It\u2019s not like everything in the world flows the way you want it to flow. It just happens.\u201d\u201cI honestly don\u2019t want to see her like that. I\u2019d rather her be angry at us like at the academy.\u201dNade walked faster to catch up to Siena.\u201cTeacher.\u201d\u201cHm, huh?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re hungry. Please buy us a meal since we\u2019re already outside.\u201dShe looked at him with an expression of absurdity.Getting disciplined would not even be enough considering what they did, and yet the young man was asking her for a meal, no less.\u201cYou\u2026 Are you serious? You still have an appetite in this situation?\u201d\u201cWho cares? A man\u2019s gotta eat to live. Even if I go back to get disciplined, I\u2019ll have to fill my stomach up first.\u201dShirone cut in.\u201cYes, Ms. Siena. Let\u2019s eat before we return. I\u2019m hungry.\u201dYiruki decided to pitch in.\u201cIf so, then I have a suggestion. Let\u2019s go to the aristocratic district first. It\u2019s close to the academy, and I know a very delicious and expensive restaurant.\u201dSiena didn\u2019t even have the will to get annoyed.Although her students\u2019 attitude was a little dubious, she also vaguely guessed why they were doing this.Besides, she didn\u2019t want to go to the academy in this mood, either.Not to mention, she was off duty today.\u201cAlright, alright. You guys must be very tired after the stunt you pulled off, so let's eat. However, be prepared when we head back to the academy.\u201d\u201cHehe! Yes, ma\u2019am!\u201dNade winked back at the other two.His primary goal was to lift up Siena\u2019s mood, but if their teacher\u2019s anger subsided in the meantime, then that would be icing on the cake.Arriving in the aristocratic district, Yiruki took them to a brightly lit restaurant.Shirone\u2019s mouth opened wide in front of the six-story building.Yhe entrance was very unusual. The pillars supporting the balcony were carved entirely from white ivory, and statues representing divinities from fantasies were guarding the left and right sides.Gold Cupid.That was the name of the restaurantIt was a top-notch restaurant where all the food was premium.\u201cWow! I haven\u2019t been here either. Today is just getting better and better. Shirone, let\u2019s go in quick.\u201d\u201cHuh? Well\u2026\u201dShirone turned to Siena.As expected, she was staring at the sign with hollow eyes and cheeks.It was the most expensive restaurant in the neighborhood, so it was understandable, but above all, there was no way one would choose a restaurant like this unless they had the intention of swindling their instructor.Siena sighed.\u201cYes, let\u2019s eat here.\u201d\u201cOHOOO! As expected of our teacher! So generous! Her wallet must be really out of the ordinary! \u201dYiruki joined Nade\u2019s flattery.\u201cHow foolish. You shouldn't evaluate our teacher\u2019s generosity with just this. If you are a certified Grade 6 mage, you can come and go to a restaurant like this as if it\u2019s your own kitchen at home. Isn\u2019t that right, teacher?\u201d\u201cNevermind that, just get in there quickly. We have to eat and go straight to the academy, okay?\u201dIt was Shirone\u2019s first time in a restaurant dedicated to aristocrats, so he was surprised by the interior, which was much larger than he imagined from the outside.The tables were set up sparsely enough to be considered a waste of space. And one side of the bar was decorated with colorful crystals.Of course, all the guests were aristocrats, and it was clear from their accessories that they were retainers of Creas.\u201cShirone! This way!\u201dShirone, who was watching everything in fascination, headed to the table.Nade and Yiruki also looked around from time to time, but they didn\u2019t look intimidated by the extravagance.A staff member took their order. He was a cheesy guy with an interesting hairstyle. Shirone and his friends noticed how he would keep turning his gaze towards Siena, which they felt quite unpleasant about.No matter how eye-catching a woman was, a man should not blatantly commit such rudeness when she was accompanied by people. It was obvious he took Siena\u2019s companions lightly seeing that they were students.\u201cWelcome. Thank you for visiting Gold Cupid. Since such a beautiful person has come, I\u2019m not quite sure what to do.\u201dNade\u2019s lips jutted out.\u2018Tsk, wasn\u2019t this a top-notch restaurant? What\u2019s wrong with the service? He\u2019s totally treating us like kids\u2026\u2019With that in mind, he looked through the menu.He was doing a mental calculation to order the most expensive food to prove him wrong.When Nade ordered a course meal, Yiruki also ordered another course meal without much thought.Shirone, on the other hand, was struggling. There wasn\u2019t a single item he knew.How would Shirone know if braised Olaris was meat, fish, or a monster\u2019s tongue?Still, he ordered the same thing as Nade because he didn\u2019t want to be left out. Yiruki\u2019s menu just made him too anxious.The face of the staff member hardened seeing the series of VIP-only menus being placed.The first thought that came to his mind was if they could even afford it.All their items were premium, in fact, their highest-price dishes were triple the cost of their lowest-price dishes. If they were ignorant students who were ignorant of their own actions, it might lead to a situation where they would have to pay twelve times the expected price.The staff member gave anxious eyes to Siena, but she was also busy choosing her own menu.\u201cI\u2019d like the Dasco course, please. And a bottle of Limunes.\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]* * *Siena didn\u2019t drink often, but on days she felt gloomy, she would drink cognac.Limunes was a vanilla-scented drink that was popular among women.\u201cOh? Teacher, you drink?\u201d\u201cWhy? Can I not? You guys pick locks of other people\u2019s houses, but I can\u2019t even drink?\u201dNade immediately tucked his tail.\u201cHaha, that\u2019s true. Oh, you are off duty today, right?\u201dThe staff member butted in.\u201cThen\u2026 We\u2019ll have those ready for you soon.\u201dShirone\u2019s friends smirked at the employee who couldn\u2019t say anything more than that.But soon after, all four of them realized that they had ordered course meals. The images of the price tags floated inside their heads, but Siena didn\u2019t seem to care much.\u2018Right. She is a certified Grade 6 mage.\u2019A certified Grade 6\u2019s income could be placed in the top 10% of the aristocratic society.Furthermore, she worked at the Alpheas Magic Academy, one of the top five prestigious academies in the kingdom, so without even accounting for her being an Olifer, she could pretty much live a grandiose life.\u2018Come to think of it, our teacher, she\u2019s really successful.\u2019Of course, Siena was someone who pursued her dream, not money. However, Shirone, the son of a mountaineer, knew better than anyone how hard it was to live that kind of life.Due to the course meal multiplying to four, plates of food kept being placed on their table with no rest.Customers who were sitting at other tables glanced with wide eyes.However, Shirone and his friends did not care. They were just bent on tasting each other\u2019s food.It was said that nobles valued keeping up appearances, but such a thing was nonexistent between friends.As their stomachs began to reach their limits, the flying forks and knives returned to their original positions.Since they had finished eating, the trio started talking about magic.It was Siena\u2019s first time hearing her student\u2019s everyday conversations, so she listened with interest.The laughter did not leave their table, and the depressing atmosphere was gone. Nade\u2019s strategy worked.\u201cHehehe. Teacher, this unworthy student of yours will pour a drink for his respected master.\u201d\u201cHmph. Do you think I\u2019ll let you off the hook? I\u2019m simply not saying anything since this is a place to eat. Be prepared when we go back.\u201d\u201cSure, sure. You\u2019re absolutely right. Here, take it.\u201dNade\u2019s affable personality made the atmosphere even lighter.Siena didn\u2019t seem to hate it. She took the alcohol she was given.Shirone asked, worried because it was a strong drink.\u201cMs. Siena, haven\u2019t you had enough? I think you\u2019re drinking too much.\u201d\u201cThis much? It\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cCertainly, for sure. She\u2019s a certified Grade 6 mage. She won\u2019t just lose to some alcohol.\u201dSiena caught on. She laughed at Nade\u2019s search for an opening and sneered.\u201cHow dare you. Trying so desperately. But it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not so easily intoxicated.\u201dShe took the strong liquor straight in.* * *An hour later.\u201cHey! Hey, you! You, I\u2019m talking to you, Nade!\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201dSiena was leaning against the clear-out table with her arm. Her face was red, and she was flailing her hand in the air.Within an hour, the bottle was emptied, and Siena\u2019s eyes were losing their focus.Shirone and his friends looked at each other, nervous.\u2018What should we do? Our teacher\u2019s drunk.\u201d\u201c..............Mm, yes\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dSiena\u2019s head dropped while she was mumbling something in an incoherent and small voice.Nade caught her in a hurry as she was about to fall off from her chair.\u201cTeacher, are you okay? Let\u2019s start heading back.\u201d\u201cYou troublemaker!\u201dSiena raised her hand to pinch Nade\u2019s cheek. She pulled it relentlessly. His face was stretched, pulled, and squished, but Nade couldn\u2019t push her hand away.\u201cOUUCH! It hurts!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you to listen and be obedient! I want to become a good teacher like Ms. Ethella, you know? So please stop straying into weird things and study, for the love of god!\u201d\u201cOkay, okay! I get it, Teacher! It really hurts!\u201d\u201cAnd Shirone, Yiruki.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201dShirone and Yiruki straightened their backs and took a more proper stance.\u201cThe same goes for you two as well. If you decide to slack off simply because you believe in your talent, I won\u2019t forgive you. I don\u2019t care if you think I\u2019m a bad teacher. I\u2019m not going to forgive you.\u201d\u201cNobody thinks you\u2019re bad. So please, can you please get a grip?\u201d\u201cHoooh. Yes, I know. Why did I buy it and suffer like this? Mm.\u201dSiena\u2019s eyes closed halfway, and she buried her face in her arm that was resting on the table.Nade was taken aback.\u201cTeacher, snap out of it! Teacher? We haven\u2019t even paid yet!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m gonna sleep.\u201dNade slowly looked back at his friends with a blank face at the sound of her breathing slowing down. This time, they couldn\u2019t do anything about it.As they were struggling to overcome this difficulty, two men watching from the table across approached.\u201cOh, my. This lady must be very drunk. Let me help. Shall we get a carriage ready?\u201dHe was a neat-looking young man, and behind him, a handsome man was smiling deftly.The eyes of Shirone and his companions grew cold at the same time.Being wary of their surroundings had become a habit for the trio. From the moment they entered the restaurant, they had seen the two men pointing to Siena and having rude conversations.Of course, the three didn\u2019t think they would actually approach them.\u2018These bastards\u2026\u2019Nade really didn\u2019t want to cause any more trouble today, so he pressed down his anger and shook Siena.\u201cTeacher? Teacher, wake up.\u201d\u201c \u2026Huh?\u201dSiena leapt to her feet. She looked around, and soon, her unfixed gaze regained its focus.\u201cIs it time already? I can still drink some more.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60The man cut in quickly.\u201cAh, you were an educator. Nice to meet you. My name is Silvar Cosine. My father is a deputy director of Creas. With all due respect, I fell in love at first sight. I would be very honored to have a chance to court you.\u201dShirone, along with his friends, were bewildered.\u2018That is the worst kind of self introduction I have ever heard. Who\u2019s going to fall for that?\u2019However, it probably was a natural procedure in the aristocratic society.Siena didn\u2019t respond much. She just rested her forehead on her hand and sighed.Although she didn\u2019t show on the outside, Siena\u2019s heart felt like it was burning in hell\u2019s fire.Her heart sank every time she imagined Keira\u2019s gaze.\u2018She must hate me. I shouldn\u2019t have gone there. No, I shouldn\u2019t have contacted him from the beginning.\u2019Of course, the memories she had were those of when they were children, so she didn\u2019t feel a sense of betrayal from Armin even when he appeared with Keira.However, it would be a lie to say that she didn\u2019t have any hope. The feeling of what it would be like when they met again.The feeling of her heart racing and the thought of wanting to go back in time never left her.\u2018But\u2026 Is this love? I haven\u2019t wanted anyone since the incident that day.\u2019Silvar continued.\u201cExcuse me, I introduced myself too grandly. I\u2019m sorry. I guess I had a strong desire to look good because I met a woman I didn\u2019t want to let go. Please, forgive me for my rudeness.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m tired, so please go away.\u201dSiena was actually really tired.Of course, for a certified Grade 6 mage to forcibility break out from their drunken state wasn\u2019t anything difficult, but Siena still needed the effects of the alcohol right now. She wanted it.She wanted to forget everything. If she could, Siena wanted to wash away her memories with even more alcohol.\u201cMmm.\u201dWhen Siena, who had entrusted her mind to intoxication, faltered, Silvar hurriedly supported her.\u201cLeaving a woman alone is not chivalry. I will guide you to the carriage.\u201dNade glared.\u201cWhat are you doing right now? Don\u2019t you dare touch our teacher without permission.\u201d\u201cThere must be some kind of misunderstandingI\u2019m trying to help her. You guys can go your merry ways now. I\u2019ll call a carriage.\u201dDespite Nade\u2019s dissuasion, when Silvar moved to stand Siena up, Shirone grabbed him by the wrist.Silvar\u2019s face distorted. He decided to deal with the situation the fastest way.\u201cWho told you you can just grasp an adult\u2019s wrist like that? You better let go while I\u2019m telling you nicely.\u201dShirone didn\u2019t back down.\u201cShe said she\u2019s fine. Please leave. We will take our teacher.\u201d\u201cYou take a person\u2019s word for a joke, don\u2019t you? I saw earlier that you guys were the ones making her drink that whole bottle. Will you come to your senses after all three of you are expelled from whatever academy you hail from?\u201dYiruki scoffed.\u201cYou are the one who needs to come to their senses the most out of everyone here. Since your father\u2019s a deputy director, you should be more careful with keeping up your appearance. If you continue to act like this, who will lose more out of this situation if it gets spread. You or us?\u201dSilvar hardened his eyes.\u201c\u2026What did you just say? \u201d\u201cAh, your title! I\u2019m pretty sure there was a formal title for the son of a deputy director.\u201d\u201cYou mannerless bastard!\u201dSilvar turned his drunkenness into anger and grabbed Yiruki by the collar. However, as a tingling shock spread through his side, his hand lost its strength.He gasped, cradling his wounded side. He stepped back.\u201cWh-What was that?\u201dNade was holding electricity\u201cYou\u2019re going too far. We\u2019re only holding back because we\u2019re outside of the academy. If you want, we can also go somewhere where there are no people.\u201dSilvar\u2019s companion spoke out.\u201cHey\u2026 Those guys\u2026 They\u2019re magic academy students.\u201d\u201cMagic academy? Alpheas Magic Academy?\u201dSilvar\u2019s expression grew dark.The magic academy itself was different from a normal aristocratic academy. Furthermore, the Alpheas Magic Academy was one of the five most prestigious academies where only the best aristocrats gathered.\u2018Damn it! For them to be students of that academy. It\u2019s an academy run and sanctioned by the nation, so even my father can\u2019t pull his strings.\u2019Seeing the wheels turning inside Silvar\u2019s head, Yiruki read his thoughts. He rolled his eyes and approached him with a snort.\u201cSo, you\u2019re going to kick us out of the academy?\u201d\u201cAh, no. The thing is\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Yiruki Mercodine. I don\u2019t care what you do, but come to the academy if you have a problem. You can find me there.\u201d\u201cM-Mercodine\u2026\u201dSilvar snapped out from his drunken state. It didn\u2019t matter if Creas was a province or a capital. This was because among the nobles of the kingdom of Thromia, there was no one who did not know of the surname Mercodine.They were the most intelligent and educated family in the kingdom, a first-class aristocratic House. Their place as the head of the \u2018King\u2019s Commission\u2019, an advisory body to the king, had never once been taken away for hundreds of years.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]* * *Yiruki looked bitter as he saw Silvar\u2019s flustered state.One\u2019s family was everything to aristocrats.Nevertheless, the reason for threatening Silvar using a method he hated was to protect Siena.He didn\u2019t hold a position high enough to pull strings, but he could deal some damage by using the fact that Siena was an instructor.Though, there was no way that a mere noble could match her, a past student of the Olifer Academy.The handsome guy\u2019s companion tugged Silvar by his sleeve.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Silvar. Hey, Silvar.\u201dSilvar wanted to retaliate, but he left the restaurant with his mouth shut.Even after they disappeared from their sight, Nade couldn\u2019t calm his anger.\u201cGosh, the atmosphere is ruined. You know what they say, you don\u2019t know anything just by looking at the restaurant signs. Let\u2019s not come back ever again.\u201dShirone spoke.\u201cYeah. Anyway, let\u2019s get out of here. It\u2019s getting dark. Teacher, are you alright? Let\u2019s head back now.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dSiena, who was still drunk, stood up with the help of her students.Though she was lighty annoyed by the ruined atmosphere, she was already in a terrible mood before then. Seeing how her students stood by her firmly to protect her, she thought that she had made a good choice in becoming an instructor.Siena paid for the meal without hesitation and left through the while still unsteady on her feet.Moonlight was pouring down from the sky devoid of clouds.\u201cHaah.\u201dSiena let out a breath. She felt strangely good.It was probably because of the alcohol, but maybe she took a new leap today? She felt that she would be able to live her life not under the shadow and influence of Armin, but on her own.But it was most likely the alcohol doing the thinking for her.\u201cAh, I feel good. Today is nice.\u201dAs if possessed by the moonlight, Siena looked up at the sky and gave a tiny twirl.The jaws of the three leaving the restaurant dropped.Under the moonlight, she was so beautiful. The way her trench coat made a circle like an umbrella enhanced her beauty.Shirone and the other two stared with interest.\u201cShe dances when she\u2019s drunk. So that's how she\u2019s like. How unexpected.\u201d\u201cYo\u2026 Can\u2019t this be a scoop?\u201dYiruki stroked his chin at Nade\u2019s words.\u201cHmm, you mean we should make a trade with this? A card to prevent the dispersion of our research group.\u201dSiena, who had been in conflict with their Research Group for many years, wouldn\u2019t be able to dismiss it with a sneer.\u201cI think it can be done if we put it together properly. And although it\u2019s kind of foul, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a huge secret\u2026 But won\u2019t she be embarrassed if she recalls the moment? I want to live the rest of my life, you know.\u201dShirone was lost in thought when the sight in front of him gave him a near heart attack.\u201cHey, guys! Look!\u201dSiena was stumbling around in the same place when her foot got tangled. Her center balance was about to tilt.The three jumped into action at the sight of their teacher about to fall flat on the floor.\u201cGo! GO! Grab her!\u201dShirone quickly supported her back while Nade and Yiruki grabbed onto her arms from both sides.\u201cTeacher, wake up. You have to be sober so that we can go back to the academy.\u201d\u201cMmm. Dizzy.\u201dShe had emptied a bottle of cognac in an hour and twirled at least a dozen times.\u201cThis isn't going to work. Hey Shirone, piggyback her\u201d\u201cWhat? Why me?\u201dShirone complained.\u201cCause you\u2019re the strongest among us.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dShirone couldn\u2019t deny it.All three were low on energy because they could not sleep and eat the day before because of magic training.At least Shirone was better than his friends because he used to climb trees and mountains when he was young.\u201cGuess I have no choice. Okay, then put Ms. Siena on my back.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make it so obvious that you hate this. Do you think the opportunity to piggyback our teacher comes everyday? I\u2019m rather jealous.\u201dWhen Shirone looked at Nade, he saw him giving him a big smile that was far from envious.\u201cTsk. Can\u2019t make it any more obvious.\u201dThe group left the aristocratic district and the number of people they came across decreased noticeably.\u201cI just noticed, but Ms. Siena is surprisingly small. She feels quite petite on my back. I thought she had a similar height as me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a psychological factor. Teachers usually look bigger than they actually are.\u201d\u201cReally? But at the same time, she\u2019s also surprisingly heavy. It\u2019s slowly becoming harder.\u201dYiruki cackled.\u201cOf course. She is a human being. Women are all made up of bones, muscle, and flesh, too. You didn\u2019t seriously think she\u2019d weigh as light as a feather, right?\u201dAlthough he never thought that, he had somewhat expected her to be light.However, he had never held a woman\u2019s hand, let alone carried them on his back, so Shirone was a bit nervous.\u201cHmph, I know that much. But I\u2019m seriously tired. I won\u2019t be able to reach the academy at this point.\u201d\u201cWhat about using magic? You know, Air magic.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s still our teacher, isn\u2019t that a little\u2026\u201dShirone, who couldn\u2019t even accomplish this seemingly simple task, complained.\u201cWhat the heck is this? There\u2019s three men, but the other two can\u2019t even carry a single woman. I should\u2019ve just learned swordsmanship. My friend would have been able to carry her on his back.\u201dThe friend Shirone mentioned was none other than Rian.Nade and Yiruki didn\u2019t know who the \u2018friend\u2019 was, but they looked ashamed of their poor physicality.However, Siena was really heavier than they thought, and for those who only knew how to read books, they didn\u2019t have much muscle mass.\u201cWhat can we do? The only exercise I do is breathing, but I\u2019m confident in using my brain.\u201dYiruki snapped his finger.\u201cThen we should use our brain. Swordsmen have Schema. We should learn that right now. Shirone, what do you say?\u201d\u201cHow does that make any sense? How will we do that all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cBut we can try. In my case, I succeeded in the Spirit Zone in one try. You guys didn\u2019t?\u201dNade spoke.\u201cMe too. After I got the hang of it, I got it to work right away. What about you, Shirone?\u201dShirone, who was still struggling with Siena, raised his head.\u201cHuh? Oh, yeah, I succeeded in a single try, too. Actually, I didn\u2019t even know it was the Spirit Zone at the time.\u201dIt sounded absurd to the other two.\u201cYou entered the Spirit Zone without knowing it was the Spirit Zone?\u201dYiruki cackled.\u201cKekeke. That\u2019s so like you. Anyhow, nothing is impossible. Isn\u2019t the basic principle the same for both anyway? Schema.\u201dAfter a minute of thought, Yiruki\u2019s word made sense. It would be their loss to assume without even trying.\u201cThen shall we? Should we seriously try it? In fact, my arms are stiff and are ready to fall off.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61Nade encouraged Shirone.\u201cTry it, try it. From what I heard, it\u2019s like projecting a body image while in a state of having no self. After that\u2026\u201d\u201cI know what it is. Give me a minute. Let me concentrate.\u201dShirone closed his eyes and felt the sensation of his body while his friends kept their mouths shut.\u2018No self right before entering the Spirit Zone\u2026 Then awaken the entire body\u2019s senses with insight while projecting the body image!\u2019\u201cEeuk\u2026 Eeeeuukk! Oh no\u2026 It\u2019s getting harder!\u201dYiruki tried to hold back his laughter and said.\u201cYou simpleton, you think it\u2019ll actually work? The Spirit Zone and Schema are polar opposites.\u201d\u201cPUHAHAHAHAHA!\u201dNade couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter.Shirone looked back with lasers coming out from his eyes.\u201cYou-! Fine, I\u2019m not doing this! Switch!\u201dEventually, the three decided to take turns carrying Siena on their back.However, Nade didn\u2019t last half the distance of Shirone\u2019s while Yiruki couldn\u2019t even take over ten steps.Very soon, it was back to Shirone\u2019s turn. He carried Siena on his back with trembling arms and gave them a ridiculous look.\u201cHey, don\u2019t we look so pathetic right now?\u201d\u201cShirone. It\u2019s rude to say something that you should just store inside your brain. No need to lower our self-esteem more than you need to.\u201dAt the end of Nade\u2019s words, the three all shut up.By the time they neared the academy, Shirone suddenly spoke.\u201cHey, why don\u2019t we\u2026 Just stop doing that.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018that?\u2019 What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou know, the deal with Ms. Siena about what happened today.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dTo be honest, Nade also had a guilty conscience. However, it wasn\u2019t like they could just give up. Their research group was at stake.\u201cBut there\u2019s no other particular way. Did you come up with a plan to protect the research group?\u201d\u201cNo, but this is a whole different thing. Today\u2026 must have been a very sad day for Ms. Siena. I don\u2019t know the details, but I feel that it is.\u201dAfter seeing things from their teacher\u2019s point-of-view, their expressions became solemn.Saying your farewells to a precious loved one who sacrificed their eyes for you wouldn\u2019t just end with a bottle of alcohol.\u201cYeah, I know. I really do. But for me, the research group is important. I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I inherited this position directly from the former president. The fact that the research group is getting disbanded because of me\u2026\u201dYiruki also agreed.\u201cI understand your position. The decision is yours. We are only members.\u201dNade sighed.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be like this if it were anything else. Quite frankly, Ms. Siena is a hard type to deal with. She doesn\u2019t have any weaknesses. She has a tough personality, she\u2019s meticulous with student management. She\u2019s even telling Shirone to leave since she\u2019s worried about Overflow. We have to play a little dirty to win against someone so guarded on all sides.\u201d\u2018These little rascals\u2026\u2019Siena, who was listening while hanging on Shirone\u2019s back, choked up.When she was drunk and spinning in circles, she had been out of it, but now she was almost fully herself.Shirone spoke.\u201cWhy our teacher chose the path she did, why she\u2019s so obsessed with Overflow\u2026 She\u2019s like that because she doesn\u2019t want us to walk the same path she did.\u201d\u201cTsk! I know at least that much. She\u2019s actually one of the people I really respect.\u201dNade stopped talking there, but he couldn\u2019t turn blind eye to Shirone and Yiruki\u2019s stares.\u201cOkay! Fine! Whatever! We\u2019ll say today is invalid! Let\u2019s cover up everything that happened to Teacher. I guess we\u2019ll just have to think more about our research group tomorrow, ueah?\u201dYiruki nodded.\u201cI have no complaints. We\u2019re the villains, anyway. In fact, I owe Ms. Siena in many ways, and even though she often speaks coldly, she always sides with the students at crucial moments.\u201dShirone then spoke.\u201cThen it\u2019s decided. No matter what difficulties we face in the future, never reveal what happened today. It has nothing to do with our research group.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dThey were rather at ease when the final decision was made. Shirone and his friends continued their way with light steps.No one knew that Siena was awake.They saw the front gate of the magic academy.A half-dead Shirone found a guard standing with a torch and stopped walking. It has not past midnight yet so the night shift still hasn't gone home.\u201cWhat should we do? If we go in like this, a strange rumor might spread by tomorrow. Not to mention, we left without permission.\u201d\u201cThen we have no choice. From here on, let\u2019s use magic. I\u2019ll float Ms. Siena, so hold her up for a second.\u201d\u201cOkay, let me first put her down, Yiruki, help.\u201dThe moment Shirone touched the ground with his knees, the weight on his back disappeared.When he looked back in surprise, Shirone saw Siena standing straight. Even her eyes were clear.\u201cT-Teacher?\u201d* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]* * *Shirone collapsed onto the ground.If she could walk, why trouble him and make him suffer up till this point?Nade asked.\u201cAre you really okay?\u201d\u201cOf course. Did you think I\u2019d get drunk with that tiny amount?\u201d\u201cBut why\u2026?\u201d\u201cI treated you all to an expensive meal. You didn\u2019t actually think the day would end with me buying you boys course meals and we all happily return, right?\u201dTo be honest, it was only a while ago that she became sober.No matter how amazing a mage was, they couldn\u2019t evaporate the alcohol that had\u00a0 already made its way into the blood.\u201cAnyway, follow me. If you want to enter quietly, that is.\u201dAs Siena walked toward the front gate, Shirone\u2019s party followed as if possessed by ghost.The guard recognized her face and greeted her with wide yet sleepy eyes.\u201cOh! Why hello, Ms. Siena.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you for your hard work.\u201d\u201cDid you\u2026 Go out with these students?\u201d\u201cYes I did. I brought them out for a field trip.\u201d\u201cAh, I see. Thank you for your effort. I hope you have a good night.\u201dAccording to the academy\u2019s regulations, students were prohibited from entering the academy late at night unless they were with an instructor. Then there was nothing wrong with that.Nevertheless, Shirone\u2019s group rushed past the academy gate. They were nervous that the guard would suddenly call them from behind and stop them.When they got to Central Park with no complications, Siena turned around to glare at the three.\u201cYou guys.\u201d\u201cHeek!\u201dShirone felt it on his skin.\u201cI will let today\u2019s matter go.\u201d\u201c...Pardon?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying that I\u2019ll keep it a secret between us. I won\u2019t report it to the academy and I won\u2019t tell anybody about it. I\u2019ll also give you one month to come up with something. That\u2019s the best deal I can give you guys.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cCome up with a way to convince the academy within a month. Whether you hold a presentation or somehow bring in a ghost, it is up to you. If you are really proud of your research group, fight. Even if you have to go against the academy in order to prove it. That\u2019s the way I teach and love my students.\u201dHer students got emotional.They couldn\u2019t believe Siena was telling them this.\u2018What a relief.\u2019Nade clenched his fist.\u201cOkay! Look forward to it. Our research group will definitely prove its worth. You\u2019ll be so surprised you\u2019ll fall off your chair!\u201dYiruki assisted.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve properly stretched my brain.\u201dSiena smiled bitterly as she watched her students regain their confidence.While it was true that anxiety made its way into her heart when she saw their enthusiasm skyrocket, she was also looking forward to seeing what kind of great incident they would cause this time.\u201d\u2018Hohoho. Do your best, my students.\u2019* * *Shirone visited the research group later than usual. He found Yiruki and Nade lying on the sofa.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cDid you sleep well last night?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know. Did I even sleep? What about you guys?\u201d\u201cThe same. What are we going to do now? Even though we had a meeting all night yesterday, we couldn\u2019t come up with any good ideas.\u201dShirone sat on an empty sofa and spoke.\u201cWe have to make a decision today. Let\u2019s try to find a solution.\u201d\u201cAnd how are we going to do that? Supernatural psychic science is not a phenomenon we can see. Humans don\u2019t believe what they can\u2019t see.\u201dTired of even talking, they all stared blankly at the wall.Their minds felt as white as the wall.Not long after, Shirone\u2019s eyes returned to focus.\u201cHow about we change our train of thought?\u201dNade and Yiruki sat up.They didn\u2019t know what Shirone would say, but he was taking a different route from before.\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cOur dilemma is this: There is no way to show what is invisible.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the gist.\u201d\u201cWhat I am saying is, there\u2019s no need for us to try and show something that is invisible. That\u2019s why we\u2019re stuck. We are thinking about the next thing without solving this problem first. In essence, I think we should look for a method in which we don\u2019t have to show anything at all.\u201dYiruki stroked his chin.\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that we don\u2019t have to verify something that can\u2019t be verified.\u201d\u201cYes. The reason why I joined this research group isn\u2019t because you guys proved something to me. Wouldn\u2019t it be the same for the others?\u201dThe corner of Nade\u2019s lips tugged up.\u201cYes, we had Shirone\u2019s case. Verification was not necessary from the beginning. Rather, on the contrary\u2026\u201d\u201cWe have to make them believe what they can\u2019t see, right? Like Shirone.\u201dSomething struck Nade\u2019s mind.Feeling a plausible idea coming on, Nade hugged Shirone.\u201cShirone, come here! You saved our research group! You can take my first kiss!\u201d\u201cGross! Go away!\u201dWhile the two were wrestling, Yiruki was deep in thought.The real hard part had just begun.\u201cThen what should we do? Our direction is set, but we still have to present something. We can\u2019t exactly tell the professors to \u2018imagine\u2019.\u201dNade went back to his seat. Shirone also patted down his disheveled hair.\u201cLet\u2019s think about what we\u2019re going to show our audience.\u201dThe three students put their heads together and discussed.Once the strand was formed, ideas and endless thoughts came to mind.The main point was to present something that would make people believe in the invisible.\u201cShould we do something auditory? It\u2019s easy to design.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s efficient, but not effective. We have to think about the academy\u2019s acknowledgment.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s definitely visual. If possible, auditory as well. We just pour everything we can and present it.\u201d\u201cVisual and auditory. Then what should we visualize? Should we focus on presenting things as supernatural occurences or psychic occurences?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to empathize with the supernatural. It doesn\u2019t reach a personal level. I think psychic would be better.\u201dNade raised his hand.\u201cI vote for psychic, too. There are countless psychic phenomena. Which one do we go for?\u201dShirone sopoke.\u201cI think ghosts are good. Since it\u2019s a highly individualized concept, I think it would be easy to propagate.\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026 But isn\u2019t ghost-related stuff considered childish?\u201dNade was worried, but Yiruki voted for Shirone\u2019s opinion.\u201cThat just means if we succeed in presenting it, we\u2019d have accomplished something great.\u201dShirone said.\u201cIt\u2019s about introducing supernatural and psychic sciences to aspiring mages. However, if we use this factor well, I think it could be a point for us.\u201dNade raised his head.\u201cDo you have something in mind?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s set up a thinking trap. For example\u2026\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62Shirone explained by drawing on a piece of paper.When no replies returned after hearing what he had to say, Shirone lost his confidence and hurriedly added.\u201cOther than this method, various traps can be installed as well. For example, if you use keywords\u2026\u201dYiruki shook his head.\u201cNo, it\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s not only good, but those are necessary elements.\u201dNade agreed.\u201cYeah. This is quite subtle. You\u2019re using the presentation as a tool.\u201dAs the structure was established, the three began to plan detailed operations.\u201cThe only problem is this. How do we present a ghost?\u201dThe technical part was up to Nade.He rose from the sofa and cast Lightning Shadow which created another Nade made up of electricity.\u201cWe can make a ghost shape like this. But no one will be deceived by an unmoving ghost. That is the part I\u2019m worried about.\u201dYiruki nodded.\u201cWe can think from there. How can we make the afterimage move?\u201d\u201cThis is what came to mind right now. Quickly linking together Lightning Shadow\u2026\u201dAs Nade moved, the afterimage was taken in each frame of Nade\u2019s movement, giving the impression of walking.\u201cI see. So you\u2019re saying we can use optical illusion to make it look real.\u201d\u201cRight. However, magic has its limits. Moreover, I can\u2019t increase the number of individuals at my level.\u201dShirone asked.\u201cWhat if we were to use a mechanical device?\u201d\u201cEasier said than done. Even if we do make a device, there is a mountain pile of stuff to consider. The biggest problem is, what if people aren\u2019t fooled even after we implemented the movements? If we really want to make them believe, we need it to be responsive to external stimuli.\u201dYiruki racked his brain for a while and said.\u201cHow about\u2026 Predicting people\u2019s reactions ahead of time?\u201d\u201cPredicting their reaction?\u201d\u201cWe will adopt the Complex System Theory. We analyze the public's behavioral patterns and program them. It\u2019s a way to create the illusion that we\u2019re actually getting feedback. Problem is that\u2019s it\u2019s a huge amount of information. We need a medium and control system to deliver the information.\u201d\u201cHmm. Transmitting information. There certainly are limits to my electric ability. Then\u2026 Ah!\u201dNade turned to Shirone.\u201cPhoton Output! We have Shirone\u2019s photon output!\u201d\u201cAha! With photon output\u2026\u201dShirone thought there was a possibility. It was a magic he learned to take the Targeting exam, but in the magic society, the research on transmitting information through photon output was in full swing.\u201cNow it\u2019s sorted then. Nade will create a hologram device. I will make the program that will go into the device, and it will be Shirone\u2019s photon output that will send my program to the device. It probably requires a huge output, can you do it?\u201d\u201cI have to. It\u2019s a one in a million opportunity.\u201dThey finally saw a ray of light in the darkness. Nade was thrilled just to have hope for something he thought was impossible.\u201cWe can do it. We can protect our research group. Of course, assuming there will be no accidents.\u201d\u201cThe academy will be in a fuss if we succeed, right?\u201d\u201cMore than that, actually. I think the academy will be in an uproar. I\u2019ll bet my money on that. Besides, I think it\u2019ll be so much fun. Kekeke. I\u2019m already looking forward to the teachers\u2019 reactions.\u201dYiruki and Nade turned to look at each other and gave an evil smirk. With the existence of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group on the line, an unprecedented event in the history of the magic academy was occur.* * *Shirone spent his time increasing the effectiveness of his photon output. The key was to increase the strength of the output while increasing the retention time. Weightless photons could not inflict any physical force, meaning it could not be used as attack magic. However, this time around, that characteristic turned out to be an advantage. This was because Shirone could go and train in any storage room in Estas.Shirone put out his two hands. He concentrated and cast Photon Output.As the beam of light started to create a circle on the wall, Shirone began to push himself.If he couldn\u2019t hold out like this for 10 minutes, then there was no point in attempting to increase the output.Although the level of difficulty exceeded that of Class 5, it was the same for Nade\u2019s hologram device and Yiruki\u2019s Complex System Equation.\u2018I have to succeed. I\u2026\u2019Shirone clenched his teeth and held out.After three minutes, he began to lose consciousness.He was able to withstand a minute while casting a single photon output during the Speed Gun exam, so his current progress showed remarkable growth compared to then.\u201cHeuk! Heuk!\u201dThe result of 10 days of training was a record of 3 minutes and 20 seconds.Shirone had to increase it to 10 minutes within the next 20 days.After measuring the new record, he always had to rest for 20 minutes because he was carrying out a training that could be life threatening if recovery was neglected.Shirone was taking a break when he heard a noise from the warehouse beyond the wall. Nade seemed to have started welding.When Shirone entered the store room next door to figure out the situation, he saw Nade buried in mechanical parts.\u201cYo, Shirone. How\u2019s the output time?\u201d\u201cSo-so. I increased it by about 20 seconds. What about you?\u2019\u201cAs you can see, I\u2019m still working on the engine.\u201d\u201cCan you make it in time?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like I have a choice. Don\u2019t worry. Prototyping usually takes time since it\u2019s hard to correct errors once I start the production process. That\u2019s why I have to be meticulous right now.\u201d\u201cAlright. By the way, what about the thing Yiruki talked about?\u201d\u201cOh, that? I got it yesterday. This one.\u201dNade threw a hose-like string at Shirone\u2019s feet.The outer material was made of rubber, and a transparent, membrane-like quartz filled the inside.It was an item that Yiruki specially requested from his father, the head of the King\u2019s Commission.\u2018Optical fiber.\u2019According to Yiruki, 300 holographic devices had to be set up in the academy.However, it was impossible for Shirone to cast photon output to all the devices by himself.In the beginning, Nade\u2019s first solution was to use a mirror.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]* * *It was a method of transmitting the photon output to the mechanical device using the light\u2019s property of total reflection.But the problem was that there were too many places where the light had to be bent. So Nade thought \u2018what if there were a lot more mirrors?\u2019 What if they attached mirrors to a small hose so light could \u2018bend\u2019?When Nade proudly proposed his idea, his eyes brimmed with excitement. This was because if this idea worked, they could commercialize it. They could sit high up on a pile of money.However, Yiruki broke the news to them.Yiruki received a letter from his father every month. It contained several pieces of information regarding the mage society. A letter from a few months ago wrote that the same kind of item Nade had thought of had already been introduced.It was named the \u2018Optical fiber.\u2019Nade\u2019s disappointment could not be put into words because even the Ivory Tower, which was at the cutting edge of magic, had only recently started to make developments in the field.However, after receiving and analyzing the optical fiber, his disappointment disappeared. At his current level, he could never make such an item that required sophisticated engineering techniques.\u2018But his idea was the same as the Ivory Tower\u2019s. Nade is amazing, too.\u2019Shirone scrutinized the optical fiber. He couldn\u2019t tell what was so great about it with his bare eyes alone.\u201cHe really managed to acquire it.\u201dNade, who finished welding, stood up with red eyes.\u201cPerformance is not guaranteed. Let\u2019s start with a demonstration. There\u2019s something I converted into a tester.\u201dNade handed over the optical fiber to Shirone, which was equipped with transparent beads.\u201cWhat should I do with this?\u201d\u201cKeep holding and testing the photon output. I\u2019ll calculate the efficiency, so try it right now. But you really have to give it your all because measuring the maximum is important.\u201dShirone checked the time and found out that his break was over, so he hurriedly grabbed the crystal ball.When he cast Photon Output, a light source formed on top of his hand, and the beads shone pale.That light traveled through the optical fiber to the device Nade created which caused the needle in the instrument panel to shake.Nade, who was watching the numbers in the panel until Shirone\u2019s output limit of three minutes passed, sighed and said in a sullen voice.\u201cYiruki was right. This is still in its very early development. Well, I guess I shouldn\u2019t complain and be ungrateful. We should still be thankful for this alone.\u201d\u201cIs it that bad?\u201d\u201cIt is only 18% efficient. That means 82% of the amount of light you sent was lost.\u201d\u201c82%...\u201dShirone was so very disappointed as soon as he heard the percentage.It was hard enough for him to hold out 10 minutes, so the device having only 18% efficiency meant that he had to increase his output by 5 times to reach the desired value.\u201cCan you do it, Shirone? If you can\u2019t raise it, we will not succeed. Machines cannot compensate for a high output energy of magic.\u201dShirone's head bobbed.\u201cI\u2019ll try. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to after practice.\u201d\u201cYou can really do it?\u201d\u201cYes. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll do my best. Then I\u2019ll leave to practice some more.\u201dNade face scrunched up, and his eyes welled up in tears.\u201cReally? You\u2019re really going to it? No taking back.\u201d\u201cYes, I said I will!\u201dShirone spoke with confidence, but only his eyes were smiling.* * *\u201cHaah! Haah!\u201dShirone was on the ground, his body spread out. He was gasping for air.Training Photon Output for over half a day was affecting his mind as well as his physical body.The time he just achieved was 3 minutes and 20 seconds.Nothing changed much compared to the record measured in the morning.However, he was now able to reach 3 minutes and 20 seconds despite his drainged mental strength, so he could still say there was some improvement.Considering he fell to 2 minutes and 34 seconds an hour ago, he did pretty well for the last-minute effort.\u2018Even so, it's far from enough. How can I achieve 10 minutes?\u2019For all he knew, it might have been impossible.Photon Output consumed mental power much faster than single-shot active magic, if he continuously cast and maintained it. Ten minutes in that state was only possible in the professional world.\u201cHooh, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll recover first and try again tomorrow.\u201dNade entered the store room.\u201cShirone, are you done?\u201d\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t do it anymore today, even if I die. I need to rest first.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m dying of exhaustion after watching spark after spark for hours. It\u2019s past midnight. Let\u2019s head back to Yiruki.\u201d\u2018Has it already been that long?\u2019After some short calculation, Shirone realized he had been practicing photon output for more than seven hours. It was a life-threatening amount of training.If the academy found out about it, they would definitely ban him from training.\u201cUrgh.\u201dShirone groaned as he lifted himself up from the ground with much difficulty.Shirone wasn\u2019t the only one who looked like an undead creature of the night. Nade\u2019s eyes were sunken, and his face was blotchy red from the exposure to light for a long time.When they returned to the research group, Yiruki was playing with a pen while viewing the academy from a bird\u2019s-eye view.He was doing this to organize the behavioral patterns into an equation while considering the variables that could occur on the day of the operation.Nade understood.Like Shirone and Nade, Yiruki also seemed to have never moved from his seat ever since he sat on it.\u201cWhat do you think, Yiruki? How\u2019s the math going?\u201dYiruki didn\u2019t even look up from his notebook.\u201cI can manage to make it on time, so lay down your worries.\u201dNade\u2019s heart ached as his greed seemed to only harm his friends\u2019 bodies.In the end, the existence of the research group was one of the things the president had to be responsible for.\u201cYiruki, you don\u2019t have to overdo it. In fact, calculating all the behavioral patterns of all students\u2026\u201d\u201cI can do it. I said I can do it. Don\u2019t talk to me. I\u2019m busy right now.\u201dWith that, Yiruki shut his mouth.He was writing formulas in his notebook at an alarming rate.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were all immersed in their work.When calculated, their average time spent asleep daily seemed to be only about an hour and 40 minutes.Even on days Shirone would study real hard, the amount of workload did not compare.Strangely, however, he did not feel as tired as before. It was as if his pain had been numbed.\u2018Normally, they forget work and act all lazy, but when they actually decide to set their mind on something, they get really hung up on it almost to the point that it\u2019s scary.\u2019\u201cNade, are you tired right now?\u201d\u201cNope, not at all. Actually, am I? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still up, so I guess not.\u201d\u201cMe too. Yiruki is working too, so let\u2019s make a script first. We have to decide what to write on the poster as well. It will take time to make and design these tiny things.\u201d\u201cOh, should we? Then let\u2019s put up the poster first tomorrow.\u201d\u201cWould that be okay though? We are not even at the stage of predicting the workload yet.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll have to take the risk. It\u2019s better to announce things as soon as possible. I don\u2019t want to make it obvious that we\u2019re trying to hurry things up. Since we\u2019re fighting a psychological war, shouldn\u2019t we take this into account?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. Then I\u2019ll make whatever we have to write on the poster, you think about the design.\u201dThe two laid paper on the table and started making their poster.It was late at night, but their minds were still clear.* * *The next day.Towards the end of lunch time, a poster for a presentation of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group was posted on the notice board.Most of the students were puzzled.Even the name of the research group was unfamiliar to them because the group had not engaged in official activities.In particular, the poster was so absurd it made them laugh.In the poster was a picture of the magic academy that was altered so that it looked dark and gloomy. It looked like a circus poster.Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group\u2019s Surprise Presentation!Shocking revelation! Those who wish to know of the secrets of the soul, gather at the 7th Lecture Hall.\u201cPsychic Science? What is that? Are they talking about stuff like ghosts?\u201d\u201cI guess they really have nothing to do. Who the heck are these stupid kids in this research group?\u201dA girl pointed to the bottom of the poster.\u201cHey guys, look at this.\u201dThe students who confirmed the list of members of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group were shocked to the core.\u201cIt\u2019s our upperclassman, Shirone! How did this happen?! Is there someone with the same name in the academy?!\u201d\u201cAs if. It\u2019s really our upperclassman Shirone. There\u2019s also our other upperclassmen Yiruki and Nade.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s it? Just three? Are they doing this for the performance evaluation? Even so, this is too much.\u201dWhile one half of the students were still in a doubt, the other half simply found it funny.\u201cWhen is the presentation? Should we give it a go?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s Senior Shirone, I\u2019m curious.. Are they really going to reveal the secrets of the soul?\u201d\u201cKekeke! We\u2019ll know when we get there. Anyway, it sounds fun.\u201dEither way, the students didn\u2019t take it seriously. To them, it was like going to a theatrical performance rather than an academic performance.On the other hand, those working in the dark, similar to the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group, viewed the situation seriously.They gathered away from the public eyes and whispered.- How did this happen? A presentation from the \u2018Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group?\u2019- According to our spy, it seems that Ms. Siena and they were at odds with each other. They must be going toe-to-toe with each other, but can they really do anything? They\u2019re not the previous Super Psychic Group that we knew of. The glory days are over.- We can\u2019t be certain. Yiruki is a savant and Nade\u2019s skills shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly, either. Shirone, the new member, was also the reason Black Magician disbanded. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna end this easily.- Kekeke, Black Magician. They were just low-class kids. Anyway, let\u2019s wait and see. If the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group disappears, there will be an all-out war in regards to the second owner of Estas.- It won\u2019t be easy. The Female Body Research Group has been eyeing it for a long time. The economic research group \u2018Golden Wheel\u2019 is also preparing to open the black market. Must be a good opportunity to make a killing.- Hmph, our Doll Collection Research Group isn\u2019t so bad, either. I swear on my lovely Poco. Estas\u2019 \u2018upper level\u2019 is ours.The upper level of Estas.Their eyes gleamed as they recalled the secret place that was only talked about in legends.Those who knew the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group and those who did not know of it all had different stories, but everyone expected the presentation to be an absolute success.As for the party that was actually preparing for the presentation, they had no time to pay attention to miscellaneous things.Only one thought kept bothering them.Why was there only 24 hours in a day?If each day was about 200 hours long, or at least 48 hours long, they could achieve better results.Of course, they weren\u2019t stupid enough to waste time on such delusions, so they split the load so they could work as effectively as possible.Nade, who succeeded in developing the prototype of the hologram device, held a demonstration in front of Shirone and Yiruki.It was a hemispherical lens made of glass. Output terminals extended in all directions and were connected to an auxiliary device.While Yiruki was busy setting up the program, Shirone fiddled with the crystal marble on the optical fiber.Nade spoke.\u201cEverything\u2019s set. Shirone, let\u2019s start.\u201d\u201cWill it be okay? I haven\u2019t perfected my Photon Output yet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same for us. We need to test it first so that we can find out what we need to improve.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dWith a crystal ball in each hand, Shirone gave everything he had.Electricity was being generated inside the hemispherical lens, and a translucent human figure made its appearance.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Although the figure was not completely human-looking due to the limits of the technology and electricity, Nade thought this inaccurate depiction was actually better. This was because students\u2019 imagination of ghosts would be something like this.\u201cSo this is a hologram.\u201dThe ghost was a soldier in ancient armor. Its face was dirty, and its bones could be seen in places the armor did not cover.\u201cFirst of all, the frame looks okay. Yiruki, it\u2019s your turn.\u201dYiruki activated the controller.There were only eight buttons, but since combination was possible, various patterns could be expressed. Each time a button was pressed, the soldier\u2019s hologram performed various actions.Yiruki watched the soldier walk about the room with a satisfied expression.\u201cFirst, there is no problem with the program. We can continue like this. All that\u2019s left is Shirone. Are you really going to be okay? On the day of the presentation, the number of devices will increase dramatically.\u201dShirone, who tried it himself, was also worried.Power generation was covered with Nade\u2019s electricity, but the problem was transmitting information. Operating even a single hologram device tired Shirone out.\u201cI\u2019ll do my best. Still, my retention time is increasing, so there is still hope. Now, Nade will be mass producing, right? And are you done, Yiruki?\u201d\u201cNo, I also have a lot of things to improve on. If I take psychological changes into consideration, it would take a year to analyze. Still\u2026 Considering our simpler goal, I should be able to make it on time.\u201dNade nodded his head.\u201cOkay, great. Sadly, we have no time for rehearsals. So with the time we have left, let\u2019s continue focusing on our respective duties.\u201dIn order to reinforce his mind, Shirone thought of many possible solutions. But eventually, Shirone came to a definitive conclusion.\u201cPush my mind to the limit.\u201dPhysical training focused on damaging pre-existing muscle fibers in order to make them stronger. If someone were to take only a few hours of rest like Shirone, their body would break within a month.However, the mind differed from the body. It had the elasticity to withstand high stress.For Shirone, whose mental strength was extremely strong already, there was no greater way than this.\u2018I can do it.\u2019Pushing his mind to the brink of destruction. It was the only solution to reach their impossible goal.\u2018More! I have to beat my mind more!\u2019The size of the light source reflected on the wall was gradually getting bigger.* * *The day before the presentation.The storeroom where Shirone was training was bathed in blinding light from photon output.Shirone had his eyes tightly closed. Blood was dripping from Shirone\u2019s lips.He tried to hold out, but his body swayed left and right. His two legs wobbled, struggling to hold up the weight.If he kept on going like this, he could go crazy.\u201cEUK\u2026 AARGHHHH\u201dShirone poured out the tiny amount of mental energy he had left.The next moment, the flash disappeared.THUD!\u201cHEUK! HEUK!\u201dShirone was gasping for air, but he still had to check his record. Shirone crawled on his knees to press the button on the watch.10 minutes and 32 seconds.\u201cHaaah\u2026\u201dHe successfully maintained Photon Output for more than 10 minutes.His Spirit Zone had rapidly grown in strength, and the power behind his specialty magic also exceeded the level of Class 5.The iron door opened, and Nade, who Shirone had not seen for days, came in.Considering he had to walk around the academy in an invisibility cloak, his complexion was much worse than before.\u201cIt\u2019s midnight, Shirone. Let\u2019s do a rehearsal.\u201dNade knew how high Shirone set his goal, so he purposely did not ask for results.Then Shirone, who was breathing hard, threw the watch at him.Nade\u2019s eyes widened after seeing the recorded time.\u201cYou\u2026 Did you really make it?\u201dShirone held a thumbs up and gave a tired smile.\u201cGoal achieved. Let\u2019s give them a show to remember.\u201d* * *7th Lecture Hall, Alpheas Magic Academy.The presentation was at 5 PM, but many students were already gathered in front of the lecture hall.As rumors spread and more continued to be produced, the presentation caught many people\u2019s attention.Sharelle admired the line.\u201cWow, there are a lot of people. It\u2019s also my first time hearing of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group, but as expected, celebrities are different.\u201dSharelle was promoted to the Advanced class after the Speed gun, so she didn\u2019t have the chance to hear about the research group.Amy found it unexpected, too.It was amazing that a research group with only three members from Class 5 could attract so many people.\u201cThey did create a lot of ruckus. Anyways, it seems like their performance is a success.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think Shirone and Yiruki would become friends. They were at each other's throat, yet now they can\u2019t even live without each other.\u201dWhile the two stood in line, students from the Intermediate classes murmured amongst themselves.Students from the Advanced classes had come to visit.Just looking at the Class 3 badge on their collar alone was awe-inspiring.\u201cWow, it\u2019s Senior Amy. Even the Advanced class is going to attend this lame presentation?\u201d\u201cYou idiot, she is Senior Shirone\u2019s girlfriend. And Senior Sharelle always hangs with Senior Amy. They\u2019ve been like that even since their time in the Intermediate Classes.\u201d\u201cWell yeah, but\u2026 What about the seniors over there?\u201dThe Students\u2019 eyes gathered toward the place someone pointed to.Amy and Sharelle also looked back and was surprised.\u201cOh my? Amy, look there. Kaden is here.\u201dKaden from Class 2 had his hands inside his pocket.Around him were a number of talented people from Class 2 who were well known. amongst them were Richard of Alchemy, Electric Monster Lycon, Hershey of Sonar, and so on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 64": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Infinite MageCH 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHowever, even Class 2 upperclassmen were only supporting roles compared to the man who just joined the line.A beautiful man dressed up in ready-made clothes with hair neatly pulled back stood there, smiling.He was Fermi Ardino of Class 1.Once more people noticed he was there, the sound of talking diminished.Sharelle also whispered with a serious look.\u201cIt\u2019s understandable that we are here, but isn\u2019t it strange that people from Class 2, not to mention Fermi, are attending?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re not here because of Shirone. What do you think the upperclassmen who just arrived have in common?\u201d\u201cHmm, I don\u2019t know, hard to get close to?\u201d\u201cExactly. Those guys\u2026 They\u2019re probably members of groups that work in the shadows. Similar to Black Magician. Though they are on a whole \u2018nother level compared to them.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s right. I heard the research group that Shirone joined is quite notorious. However, I really didn\u2019t expect Fermi to come. I don\u2019t know about the others, but I know he\u2019s really popular. He\u2019s even kind.\u201d\u201cI find that even worse. I feel like he\u2019s always up to something. Anyways, let\u2019s just ignore them. There\u2019s no such thing as upperclassmen or lowerclassmen in the Advanced class.\u201dThe 30 students in the Advanced Class were all equal competitors.Each year, 10 Advanced Class students would graduate, and classes were organized according to exam scores. Therefore, the current classmates were those who did not make the top 10 in last year\u2019s graduation exam.The reason why they couldn\u2019t just be regarded as failed-to-pass students was because they were at the top of the pyramid. The higher one went up the pyramid, the smaller the difference in skill. If you were a Class 1 student, there was little to no difference in terms of skill to categorize who was more superior or inferior.In addition to basic skills, there were numerous variables such as their condition on that particular day, the existence or nonexistence of strategy, compatibility, concentration, choice, etc. That was what determined who got to graduate.The students were absolutely shocked that the Rank 1 of the magic academy had come to watch a Class 5 presentation.As word of Fermi\u2019s appearance started to spread, by the time the presentation was about to start, there were more students than there were seats.Finally, the door to the lecture hall opened and the students rushed in.The first row was for the instructors, while the students filled up the seats in the order they came in.Amy had arrived early, so she got to sit close to the stage next to Sharelle.\u201cWhat in the world are they going to show us for it to be this big of a deal.\u201dNo matter how hard she thought about it, it was strange for it to cause this ruckus.Not only were there outstanding talents from the Advanced class, but also the number one\u2026\u2018This isn\u2019t a simple presentation.\u2019In the midst of the tense atmosphere, Amy waited for Shirone to come out.The lights in the hall went out.A single spotlight descended into the dark roomThe spotlight moved across the stage holding everyone\u2019s attention. It captured the boy standing in the center, then returned.\u201cGood evening, everyone. Thank you for coming to watch the presentation presented by the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group. I am Nade, the president of the research group. Today, we would like to demonstrate the subject of the soul. Let\u2019s begin the presentation.\u201dThe spotlight went out and the sound of applause died down.The stage brightened like the beginning of dawn, and the scenery of a gloomy mountain began to show itself against the curtain behind the stage.\u201cThe children have prepared a lot.\u201dAlpheas smiled contentedly.There was only one reason why he visited. He was too curious to miss out on this event.On the other hand, Siena was not too impressed.It was a nice strategy to use a hologram device, but if the substance of the presentation itself was poor in quality, everything was in vain.Nade spoke at the edge of the stage.\u201c520 years ago at this exact location, before the Alpheas Magic Academy was established, there was a small Hwajeonmin Village. It was a period when people who lost their country to a devastating war of conquest wandered aimlessly. Today, we would like to tell you the story of a woman who came here to this Hwajeonmin Village to escape the war.\u201dAs the stage brightened, Yiruki, who was dressed up as a soldier, appeared while dragging one of his legs.\u201cGeeeuurggghh, H-Hungry.\u201dThe eyes of the students who were listening very seriously a second ago widened. They soon burst into laughter.\u201cPUHAHA! What is that?!\u201d\u201cWhat does he mean \u2018Geeeuurggghh?\u2019 What kind of play is this?!\u201dNade continued the narration.\u201cIt was the same for most of the soldiers who wished to escape the war. However, they were not alive. They were hungry ghosts who wandered the world, possessed by evil spirits. They entered the Hwajeonmin Village after smelling raw flesh.\u201dAfter the explanation, Nade, who changed his clothes off-stage, appeared as the main male character while Yiruki attracted the audiences\u2019 attention from the side.\u201cOh, my dear Ollia! Why is someone from a noble lineage like you suffering in these mountains? If I could, I would sell my soul to restore your glory, but it\u2019s a pity I can\u2019t do that.\u201dThe vocalization was quite worth listening to, but the students who came here thinking it would be a presentation were really puzzled to find out it was a play.Moreover, when Shirone, dressed as a woman from the other side, came out on stage, everyone was stunned.* * *Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Anwen][Proofreader \u2013 Enigami]Join our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cNoah, Noah!\u201d\u201cWAHAHAHAHA!\u201dAll the students could not hold back their laughter.Shirone really looked like a woman. He had tied his waist tightly to emphasize his waistline, and it looked like he was stuffing something to accentuate his chest.\u201cA-Amy.\u201dSharelle slowly looked at Amy with a complicated mind to find Amy also had an absurd expression.Nade and Shirone communicated the situation through conversations.It was just a simple story.Noah and Ollia, who were both of noble lineage, promised to marry each other when they were kids, but the war left their families in ruin. That was why they eventually came to Hwajeonmin Village to continue their love.\u201cI missed you Ollia, my love, my everything. I love you with all my heart.\u201d\u201cI love you too, Noah.\u201dThe eyes of the students, who were watching with half-enthusiastic expressions, shone with curiosity for a moment. This was because the two actors were hugging and staring at each other.Anyone could guess what would happen next.\u2018Kiss scene. It\u2019s definitely a kiss scene.\u2019Sharelle\u2019s leg bounced up and down as she made a fuss.\u201cOh my, they\u2019re gonna do it? Actually?! Oh no!\u201dThe audience focused this time out of pure curiosity about whether they would really kiss.\u201cOllia.\u201d\u201cNoah.\u201dThe tension soared the moment they started to come closer.\u201cAAAHHHHH!\u201dSuddenly, Yiruki appeared behind Nade and bit down on his neck, knocking him down.\u201cKYAAAAAAA!\u201dThe students jumped when the scream rang out from the sound system.\u2018That scared me.\u2019Nobody expected Yiruki to appear. This was because it was impossible to produce this kind of production with only the stage equipment.Shirone wrote the script aiming for this point. He thought he could surprise the people by using the invisibility cloak. As the tension escalated, the audience gradually moved to sit on the edge of their seats.Yiruki, who knocked down Nade, pretended to dig into his flesh. Bone-crushing, flesh-chewing sounds were emitted from the sound system.\u201cNo! Noah! NOAH!\u201dWhen the flesh-eating ghost disappeared, Ollia held the dead body of Noah in her arms and cried out in anguish.The lights went out, and a woman\u2019s outcry was heard.\u201cAAHHHHHHHH!!! I won\u2019t forgive you! I\u2019ll kill them all! I\u2019ll turn you guys into ghosts, too!\u201dThe voice of the woman echoing in the dark sent shivers down the students\u2019 spines.When the sound of the woman cursing ended, the spotlight shone once again on Nade, who came back as the narrator.\u201cIt was approximately six months ago that we heard\u2014 No, when we excavated this story. It was thanks to an old diary we found while researching the history of the magic academy.\u201dNade pulled out a single notebook.It was supposedly a 520-year-old notebook that was buried underground.Of course, it was something they made in a hurry a few days ago.\u201cOur members who study psychic science immediately launched an investigation and we learned a shocking secret. It is the fact that the ghosts of that time still roam this academy.\u201dDing. Ding. Ding.The sound system started ringing a bell which sounded familiar to the students. It indicated midnight.\u201cEvery night at 12 a.m., hungry ghosts roam places devoid of light. So we thought, this could be the evidence to prove the existence of souls.\u201dThe students frowned.Even though they\u2019d been attending the academy for several years, they had never seen a suspicious person, let alone a ghost.\u201cOf course, we know. You\u2019ve never seen one before. However, according to the study of Supernatural Psychic Science, souls have properties that can only be seen by those who wish to see them. A special kind of mental frequency has to be met. This is why we decided to hold this presentation. Now that you know the story of souls, your frequency is set right. Now you too will be able to witness ghosts wandering the place believed to be the destination for the soul of the dead.\u201dNade gave a wink and made a final comment.\u201cOf course, only if you\u2019re lucky. This ends the presentation given by the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group.\u201dThere was only silence after Nade left. Instead of applause, there was only a bleak atmosphere.\u201cWhat? What is he saying?\u201dThe students were filled with betrayal and despondency.They said it was a presentation to prove the existence of the soul, but all they did was dress up as ghosts.\u201cAs expected, this was just a joke. I thought they would show something amazing.\u201d\u201cWe are the fools to have expected something. Let\u2019s be honest, how could they prove the existence of ghosts? We\u2019ve been completely deceived.\u201dClass 4 joined in.\u201cThere were lots of talks about Shirone and Yiruki, but in reality, they aren\u2019t much of anything. Hey, let\u2019s leave. I wasted my time here.\u201dVoices of disappointment could be heard all around the hall.The students were reluctant to even have a break time and instead spent that time studying. So they were extremely regretful to waste their time watching a false presentation.Mark and Maria came down while other students began leaving the lecture hall.It was to see Amy and Sharelle.\u201cHello, Seniors!\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cHow did you like the presentation?\u201dMark seemed to have found it absurd.It was especially more difficult for him to accept today\u2019s presentation because he knew of Shirone\u2019s level of genius.But Amy didn\u2019t have anything to say either.No excuses, no pretext to try and justify the situation. What they saw was everything, and this was the end of the presentation.Sharelle stood up for Shirone.\u201cI\u2019m sure they originally prepared something, but maybe something went awry. Didn\u2019t have enough time, or something. Right, Amy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true this is a whole failure. Anyway, I should have known from the moment I heard that he was hanging out with strange kids. Let\u2019s leave.\u201dSharelle grumbled at Amy\u2019s cold attitude.\u201cHow can you be so indifferent to your boyfriend?\u201d\u201cHaha! That\u2019s Senior Amy\u2019s charm. Shirone is probably the one most upset out of everyone here.\u201dMark had a point. Sharelle followed behind Amy.Now the only ones left were the instructors.They honestly had no clue what to write on the evaluation sheet.Siena was especially shocked.\u2018Why in the world did they give this kind of presentation\u2026\u2019She couldn\u2019t believe they held such a childish presentation in the presence of the headmaster no less.A headache was already pounding her head as she thought of ways to cover up this situation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Infinite MageCH 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySiena just gave up trying to come up with something and apologized to Alpheas.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Headmaster.\u201d\u201cHoho, it was a difficult task. Isn\u2019t supernatural psychic science supposed to be something like this? Don\u2019t stress over it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to give them a warning.\u201dAlpheas raised his hand as if to say it was okay and walked toward the door. And just before leaving through the door, he turned and looked at the empty stage.Hidden behind his beard, the corner of his lips rose.\u2018If things ended with just this, I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t have even started the whole thing. Am I right, Shirone?\u2019* * *Regardless of the audience\u2019s reaction, Shirone\u2019s group rushed to the research group room.\u201cGood. We passed step 1 with no incident! The real show starts now.\u201d\u201cThey bought into it, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. I could tell just from their eyes.\u201dContrary to students\u2019 expectations, the presentation ended blandly, but that didn\u2019t matter to Shirone\u2019s group.The presentation was only a way for them to convey keywords. What they truly aimed for with the presentation was to plant a seed of small doubt in the audience\u2019s mind.Nade arrived at the lab and started undressing.\u201cShirone, it\u2019s up to you from now on. You\u2019re literally the engine of this operation.\u201d\u201cOkay. Let me meditate for a little bit.\u201dNade and Yiruki\u2019s results were visible, but in Shirone\u2019s case, there were many variables that came into play. He had no choice but to simply believe in himself, recalling the past month of training.They had six hours left.In order to reach the best condition, Shirone started the Sequence method.\u2018One, two, three\u2026\u2019His friends left him alone so that they wouldn't bother him.As aspiring mages, they knew what it meant to maintain Photon Output for more than 10 minutes.They still had things left to do.Yiruki had to set up the hologram control device while Nade had to overhaul the central device that transmitted photon signals.And with that, midnight approached.Sitting in the dark laboratory where no one was present was Shirone. He slowly opened his eyes.After five hours of the Sequence method, his mind was comparable to a well-honed sword.The door opened.\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201dNade said.Shirone remained motionless for a long time.Then he suddenly stood up and left the lab after Nade like a gladiator heading into the Colosseum.The central device was installed in the path of the sewage system that ran under the park.Thick optical fibers came up to the ground, where they were again dispersed into hundreds of strands through multi-adapters and spread throughout the academy.There were about 300 holographic devices spread throughout the academy.Shirone admired Nade\u2019s tenacity, but he also felt bad for him as he could feel the amount of pressure that must have been on his shoulders.He had achieved his goal, but it was his first time trying it out for real. No one knew if unexpected variables would come into play.With ten minutes left until midnight, Shirone walked in front of the huge central device.It was ten times bigger than the prototype and looked like a monster with several legs.Shirone grabbed the output terminal that looked like a crystal ball and waited while Yiruki checked the time.He could not be too fast, nor too slow. It was important to start right at midnight.\u201c5 minutes left. Let\u2019s begin.\u201dShirone took a deep breath.His eyes calmed, and even his face was devoid of any expression.\u201cNow.\u201dWith Yiruki\u2019s signal, Shirone\u2019s Sequence method sped up at a tremendous rate.\u2018Photon Output!\u2019Yiruki and Nade\u2019s eyes widened as light exploded from both hands.They knew Shirone had achieved his goal, but it was their first time seeing him in action.\u2018More! Stronger!\u2019When Shirone reached his highest output, Nade ran to the device and checked the transfer efficiency.His eyes were as wide as saucers.\u201cT-This\u2026\u201dYiruki asked frustratedly.\u201cWhy? What\u2019s the percentage?\u201d\u201c17.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThat was low. Much lower than what they had expected.Nade didn\u2019t know where it went wrong, but he didn\u2019t have time to look into it. If they couldn\u2019t do it now, it was over.Shirone had a hunch from the start.\u2018Too big. The radius is too wide.\u2019* * ** * *The moment he cast Photon Output, it felt like he was pouring water into a bottomless pot.\u2018There is no way the calculations were wrong. The only possibility is that there\u2019s something wrong with the product\u2019s stability.\u2019Checking a product\u2019s stability required cutting-edge technology, and that was something the current Nade could not create.Of course, there was no way the King\u2019s Committee was fooled. It was just that optical fiber was still a material that was being researched and developed. It was not even commercially available yet.\u201cEeuuuk!\u201dShirone gave it his all, but the output efficiency stayed stagnant at 17%.Yiruki shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s a failure.\u201dEven if he operated the device in this state, the hologram would break and shatter like glass.Three minutes later, Nade gave a sad smile.Although they failed, he was proud of Shirone for reaching an impossible goal with great effort.Nade blamed the whole situation on his ignorance and incompetence, for he was unable to discern the defects in the optical fiber.\u201cShirone, that\u2019s enough. We did well. So let\u2019s stop here.\u201dShirone did not reply.To be honest, he was overwhelmed with anger and frustration.This was a project the three of them had worked on together. They gave it their all for weeks, so how could all their work up to this point be for nothing? How could it end just like this? Shirone couldn\u2019t let that happen. He was not going to admit defeat.\u2018I want to win. I want to succeed.\u2019Shirone clenched his eyes shut.Because he had yet to pour everything into it.The light that illuminated from his hand began to gradually swell and cover his whole body.\u201cN-No way.\u201dNade read Shirone\u2019s thoughts.Immortal Function.Shirone had ended up crossing into the forbidden realm once again, despite knowing doing so could end with him losing everything.\u201cShirone! Stop! Don\u2019t do it!\u201dNade and Yiruki both rushed in to stop him, but Shirone\u2019s mind, which was heading towards Nirvana, was not damaged by moderate physical impact.The light that was growing in size swallowed his body and lit up the sewer.The more the light brightened and grew, the more Shirone faded.Worried that Shirone was going to disappear, Nade exclaimed.\u201cShirone! Please, stop! We can\u2019t lose you! We can always give up the research group, so please stop!\u201d\u201cN-Nade\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s stop! End it right now!\u201dThe corners of Shirone\u2019s lips crept up softly.\u201cI\u2019m not running away.\u201dThen, as Shirone closed his eyes gently, a huge light exploded and filled the inside of the tunnel.His mind spread to infinity, and with that, everything that constituted him began to fade.\u2018I\u2019ll continue straight like this.\u2019This was also what Armin taught him.The countless fragments of knowledge that he had acquired from the realm of infinity had been transformed into an esoteric monster.A monster called mystery.It may have only been a personal image, something his mind constructed, but it still inflicted fear beyond imagination in him.The monster chewed and swallowed Shirone. In the midst of feeling like he was dissolving into pieces, his memories scattered. Life so far was just as meaningless as it was 100 million years ago.\u2018No. I have to remember.\u2019Who he was, and where he lived.The moment he lost his ego, he would never be able to return from the infinite realm.\u2018HEEUUK!\u2019Shirone held out for dear life.If Shirone had done this back during the Speed Gun exam, he would have already given up.\u2018Just a little more\u2026\u2019But the Shirone of today was better. His mind was stronger.The Immortal Function strengthened a person, but it was also a poison that destroyed a person. Shirone was walking on a tightrope. If he made a single mistake, everything that he was would go down the drain.Shirone opened his eyes when most of his memories evaporated and the will to live disappeared.\u2018This is exactly the place!\u2019The Spirit Zone that swelled endlessly returned to its original size at a frightening pace. In contrast, the Photon Output was increasing in power dramatically.Then Shirone cried out.\u201cOutput!\u201d\u201cShirone, are you okay? Are you unscathed?\u201d\u201cCheck the output first!\u201dNade jumped and looked back at the instrument panel.Output efficiency at 22%.The efficiency that wasn\u2019t moving an inch earlier was rising.\u201cIt\u2019s working! It\u2019s going up, Shirone!\u201d\u201cArrgghh!\u201dShirone, who overcame the mental pain with pure will, injected more powerful light into the crystal ball.\u201cOutput efficiency at 36%!\u201dShirone\u2019s Spirit Zone trembled terribly.Even with his excellent durability, the enormous mental power flooding from the infinite realm was almost too much for him to handle.\u201cAAAHHHHHHHH!\u201dOutput efficiency at 59%.The cold-hearted Yiruki couldn\u2019t hide his excitement.\u201cShiro! A little more!\u201dThe shaking of the needle in the instrument seemed to reflect Shirone\u2019s current mentality.\u2018It\u2019s difficult to stay focused!\u2019Shirone bit his lips and transformed his Spirit Zone into the Defensive Form. As his frame became entangled, a cracking sound could be heard.CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!The longer Shirone held out, the stronger the light exponentially became.Output efficiency at 87%.\u201cEEEUUUUGGHHH!\u201dHis mind trembled, and his brain shook.Only now did Shirone truly realize just how amazing of a mage Armin was. Incorporating the concept of infinity into one's mind was more overwhelming than entering Nirvana. One could lose their life under the weight of the powerful force.\u201cARRGHH!\u201dAs soon as Shirone squeezed out the last bit of will he had in him, the lamp of the core lit up red.Output efficiency at 100%.Nade shuddered.\u2018How absurd\u2026\u2019\u201cAll right! Yiruki, start it!\u201dYiruki, who was watching in fascination, hurriedly pressed the button of the remote control device.The light that climbed up the optical fiber spread to hundreds of strands on the ground, wrapping around the academy like a huge spider.Ding. Ding. Ding.The sound of the bell that indicated midnight was heard.* * *Maria was studying at the lodging when she stretched after hearing the bell.\u201cIt\u2019s already 12 o\u2019clock. Time really flies.\u201dThen, she remembered the presentation and froze in her stretching position.\u2018Frequency of souls\u2026 Midnight.\u2019She shook her head.\u2018Gosh, what am I thinking? Even if it\u2019s Senior Shirone\u2026 How could a ghost\u2026\u2019The more she tried to erase her mind from such thoughts, the more she couldn\u2019t help but be bothered. She even imagined the ghost from the presentation.\u201cHaaa\u2026 What, useless thoughts.\u201dShirone knew that if they planted the key points into the minds of the spectators, the rest wouldn\u2019t be too hard.\u2018If the frequency of our soul is set right, we can see ghosts from then on? Then that means from today, I\u2019ll be able to\u2026\u2019She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it, so she headed towards the window to try and forget about it.And from where she stood, Maria saw someone walking in the air.Her heart stopped working for a minute.\u201cTh-That\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026\u201dThen her heart started to accelerate.What was outside of Maria\u2019s window was an old corpse with half of its face rotten.Her chin wobbled when the body missing an eye turned its head and opened its mouth wide as if it was about to scream something out.\u201cKYYYAAAAAAAAAAAA!\u201dShe let out a deafening scream, but nobody heard it.Because the same kind of scream was emanating from room to room down the hallway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What should I do?!\u201dSharelle came running with a pale face, and a sense of reality rushed into Amy.She had never believed in ghosts.

She could tell because she was a truth-seeker fighting against the evils of the world.When the ghost came to stand right in front of her face, Ethella squinted her eyes and leaned forward to have a better look.Then, the ghost stared at her as well and tilted its head.It was a moment of truth to prove how well Yiruki\u2019s equation predicted the opponent.The ghost threatened again.\u201cGRRRR!\u201d\u201c\u2018GRRRR?\u2019\u201dOut of innocent curiosity, Ethella raised her hand and tried to press the soldier\u2019s nose.However, the result was expected.

Haah!\u201dInside the ice domain where even steam froze solid, Siena breathed heavily, covering herself.The moment she opened the bathroom door, what stood in front of her was a white-as-a-sheet face that was looking at her through a window.The first thing that came to her mind was \u2018pervert,\u2019 so Siena flew back a little and froze the steam coming out from the bathroom.After she created the ice curtain to hide from the assumed \u2018pervert,\u2019 she took a moment to gather her thoughts.She peeked through the long rope-like frozen steam and what she clearly saw was a corpse with a decomposed face.\u201cWhat in the world?\u201dOf course, she remembered the frequency of souls she had heard in the presentation.\u2018Was what Nade said true\u2026? No, that can\u2019t be.\u2019However, she couldn\u2019t deny it with confidence because she couldn\u2019t explain what she was seeing.\u201cGaaaahhhhhh.\u201dAs soon as the ghost opened its mouth, Siena instinctively froze the window.Siena regained her composure when she confirmed that it was still moving behind the frost.\u201cHow dare you\u2026\u201dShe covered herself with a gown from inside the bathroom and walked to the window to open it.As expected, no harm was done to the soldier, and it continued making uncanny expressions.She went outside to inspect the building. She found a spherical device that was emitting a dim light.She let out a sigh and returned to her room to take off her gown.\u201cHooh.\u201dThe remaining water droplets on her body froze with a crackling sound, and ice particles that glistened like diamonds spread all around her.Before she knew it, no water was left on her body.\u201cThese good-for-nothing kids\u2026!\u201dCold energy escaped Siena\u2019s eyes.* * *As of midnight, the Alpheas Magic Academy was in a state of terror.Lights could be seen turning on through the countless windows of the dormitory as students rushed out of their rooms.It was the same kind of situation everywhere else.The program was designed to predict human reactions with its dozens of patterns. Rhe students ran recklessly along the road without even knowing that they had been deceived.\u201cSave me!!!\u201d\u201cGhost! Ghosts appeared!\u201dThe mob mentality from the crowd affected the students psychologically.But even then, it would be difficult to predict all human behaviors, so what Yiruki wanted was not a detailed response, but something that would induce the crowd as a whole.The holograms seemed to be chasing people without purpose, but if one observed from a bird\u2019s-eye point-of-view, it was actually used to rally the crowd into one place.Eventually, almost all of the 400 students gathered in front of the central building where the lights were turned off.Students trapped between people and buildings realized that there was no place to escape anymore.Children from the lower-leveled classes wailed and cried out for their mothers, while students from Intermediate class prepared to fight.\u201cHere they come! Do something!\u201d\u201cAAAHHHHH! Come at us! Bring it on, you beasts!\u201d\u201cGRAAAHH!\u201dEveryone\u2019s faces turned pale as the army of corpses charged at them with swords.* * ** * *Both the crying students and those trying to stand guard had no choice but to feel chills rush through their blood.\u201cEeuuuuk\u2026!\u201dThe students\u2019 chins wobbled, but then a light spread through the soldiers' bodies. The bodies soared into the sky as hundreds of light rays.\u201cWh-What?\u201dPerhaps, they were ascending to the afterlife?The young children were praying when the sound of applause was heard from the central building behind them.Clap. Clap. Clap.All 400 people stared up at the rooftop at the same time to see Shirone, Yiruki, and Nade standing over them.\u201cThank you to all those who have attended our presentation.\u201dWhile the students still had difficulty grasping the situation, the instructors finally arrived.All faculty members in charge of the Beginner classes, Intermediate classes, and Advanced classes were gathered.Siena stomped her way through the crowd.\u201cYou guys! Come down here, right now! What in the world are you doing?! You turned the academy into a mess!\u201dNade winked and said.\u201cAh, Ms. Siena. What a beautiful evening we have today, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cWhat \u2018beautiful evening,\u2019 huh?! Hurry up and come down! If I personally go up there, I might \u2018accidentally\u2019 kill you, so come down here! Now!\u201d\u201cBut first things first, it\u2019s still our presentation. I\u2019ll put an end to it first and then go.\u201dPresentation? What kind of presentation occurred in the middle of the night?Students understood what was happening.\u201cWhat? So all this was their doing? That means it was all fake!\u201d\u201cWe were fooled! Damn it!\u201dThere were still many who were puzzled, but the students who grasped the situation criticized Shirone\u2019s group by pointing fingers.\u201cYou crooks! How dare you Class 5 kids fool us? This is not a presentation!\u201d\u201cThose guys should get zeros on the performance evaluation. You guys are done for! There are no ghosts in the world, yet they dare go scamming us with such things.\u201dDespite all the cursing and criticisms, Shirone\u2019s group had a relaxed smile.Eventually, Nade raised his hand and calmed them down.\u201cThe Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group has proven to you the existence of ghosts through our presentation. Yet, you guys still don\u2019t believe in the existence of the soul.\u201d\u201cOf course not! You created these nonexistent ghosts and thought you could get recognized? You guys are going to fail!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! This was just a bad prank! Anyone can deceive people this way! Even I\u2014\u201dThe students of Class 4 stopped talking.Soon, students from other classes turned to their side and murmured as if they had just realized it too.\u201cBy the way, how did they do it? Do you know?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have a clue. They really looked like ghosts. Besides, they fooled the entire academy.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t just a bad prank.Another thing that was surprising was the hundreds of holograms. How they moved all of those around the academy was still a mystery.\u201cThose bastards, what the hell did they do?\u201dSiena closed her eyes and frowned as the crowd broke out into confusion.To be honest, she also didn\u2019t know the exact way they pulled this through.\u2018They could have made the holograms. Sure, they could also program it to move. However, to cover the whole academy, they had to operate each one flawlessly. But to also lure 400 people into one place in such a situation\u2026 That\u2019s impossible. No, what\u2019s more impossible than that is\u2026?\u2019Even if luck was on their side, how did Shirone\u2019s group transmit the information?\u201cHohoho, I think we lost this time around.\u201dWhen the instructors turned around to look, they saw Alpheas, who was looking at the rooftop with a laugh.Siena shook her head.\u201cHeadmaster, this isn\u2019t something to be taken lightly. I don\u2019t know what those children did, but unauthorized installation of devices in the academy facility\u2026\u201d\u201cHo? You mean even you don\u2019t know Ms. Siena?\u201dCurrently, Alpheas was interested not in the fact that an academy rule had been broken, but in the technological prowess of Shirone\u2019s group.Alpheas himself would not have been able to guess that an information communication skill was involved in this strategy if he wasn\u2019t also a major in Light magic.\u2018Even so\u2026\u2019Was it possible at a student\u2019s level?It was probably a huge gamble for the three as well.He wanted to applaud them for their wonderful success.Siena admitted frankly.\u201cYes. Although it\u2019s embarrassing to admit, I don't really know how they did it. But just because we don\u2019t know the mechanism doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve convinced the instructors.\u201d\u201cHoho, you\u2019ve mistaken. That\u2019s not what I meant by \u2018we lost.\u2019\u201d\u201cYes? Then\u2026\u201dAlpheas looked up and saved his breath.\u201cLet\u2019s just watch for now. I don\u2019t think the presentation is over yet.\u201dThe students were also burning with curiosity to find out the tricks Shirone\u2019s group used.The front of the building turned into a large-scale forum, but the more they shared their opinion, the more mysterious it got.The students from Class 4 found this whole situation especially unpleasant.Not only were they fooled by tricks created by their lowerclassmen, but they also couldn\u2019t even grasp how they did the whole thing. Their pride took a hit.\u201cHmph! Whatever method they used, it must be something absurd and laughable. The point is your presentation is rubbish! You\u2019re saying you will prove ghosts exist? Don\u2019t make me laugh!\u201dAt someone\u2019s angry voice, Class 4 students agreed.\u201cYeah! We can\u2019t accept such a method! That wasn\u2019t psychic science, it was just a show!\u201dNade heard that and stepped in.\u201cDo none of you still believe in the soul?\u201d\u201cOf course not! Soul? That was just a kind of Phantom magic. I'm saying it\u2019s not real.\u201d\u201cThen I will ask you this. If you really thought so, then why are you here?\u201d\u201cBecause\u2026! Huh?\u201dSilence enveloped the area.Among the hundreds of students, not one could go against what Nade said.If they didn\u2019t believe in the existence of souls, why did they run away?The answer was simple. Somewhere deep in their mind, there was a belief in the soul.Nade continued.\u201cWhat you are feeling right now is the essence of Supernatural Psychic Science. Humans live their whole lives with questions about the unknown. They are curious. If you simply don\u2019t need to know just because it hasn\u2019t been verified, then why should intelligence exist? I think this is why the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group should be in Alpheas Magic Academy, the birthplace of intelligence.\u201dThe students said no words.It wasn\u2019t real ghosts that appeared today, but so what?The important thing was that everyone here thought the things they saw were ghosts. Reals ones.If one went about it that way, then that meant someone had to try and uncover the truth.The students approached this presentation seriously for the first time.The reason for learning was to find out what you didn\u2019t know yet. In the end, intelligence was an unknown, and psychic and magic were not so different from one another.\u201cThat marks the end of the presentation of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Group. Once again, I would like to thank you for participating until late at night.\u201dShirone\u2019s group bowed.The crowd was quiet, and no one spoke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Info",
