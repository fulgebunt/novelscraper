As words slowly filled the crisp piece of parchment paper, her heart sang a melancholic tune.She was certain that she would die after the first night of her marriage. A bride\u2019s suicide would bring disgrace to her family. But a dishonorable, ignominious death was what Leah wanted the most.Death.Is it what she deserved? A miserable end for a royal princess, who devoted her life to the country and to her royal family? \u00a0Her accomplishments and efforts turned into ashes the day her family sold her like a common good\u2014in exchange for wealth. No matter how hard she tried, at the end of the day, she was only a mere tool for other\u2019s convenience.Oh, but death would be a sweet escape from the life she was to face.Chang Jeong-baek, the man betrothed to her, could easily pass as her father. However, despite her exercising a veto, she was left without a choice. The man was insanely powerful that her parents couldn\u2019t refuse in giving her hand\u2014or did they even hesitate in the first place?When the royal family accepted Chang\u2019s proposal, Leah vowed to retaliate. To blemish the highest quality good prepared by the royal family which is herself. It was the only revenge Leah, in her powerless state, could possibly do.Horses were already saddled up. Today, she would travel towards Chang\u2019s home where the wedding would be held.The arrangements have been made without her permission. For the coming days, Leah pictured out what was going to happen in her head. After a three-week-long carriage journey, she would arrive at Oberde. There, she would exchange vows with an old Chang, share the kiss of oath and\u2026spend night with him.The face of Chang Jeong-baek, excited at the thought of having his filthy hands on his new, young bride, was drawn clearly in Leah\u2019s mind. Unpleasant shivers ran up her spine, disgusted to think that he, who looked like a toad, would ride her body.But Leah already did theirreversible. After their first night, Chang will find that his new bride is impure.The virginity of the bride in Estia was considered most important than anything else. Knowing that a deflowered bride was sold to him, to which he paid a great deal of wealth, Chang would be livid and thoroughly insulted.He was not a man to trifle with. His power extended even to the barbarians on the periphery. Moreover, his fury was enough to strangle the nobles of the capital. Therefore, the royal family, which had already lost all their power and remained only a luxurious shell, would suffer a terrible fate under Chang\u2019s rage. They would have to vomit out more than they had received from him, just to quell his anger.And Leah will be stripped of her royal name and forever be condemned as a prodigy who slandered her royal honor.It was a perfect ending. The only unfortunate thing was that Leah would not be able to witness the ruin of the royal family with her own eyes. Because by then, she would already be a cold corpse.\u201cPrincess, these are the wedding papers.\u201dJust before leaving Estia, the court-martial brought in papers Leah had to sign. Without resistance, she wrote her name, smearing a fine ink on the paper.[Leah de Estia.]The lavish signature was the same shape as the one she left on the note she made. The black letters on white paper were as clear as night.When she put down her pen, Countess Melissa, the maid of honor watching from the side, burst into tears. As soon as she wept, the other women who were holding back tears began to sob in unison. Even the court-martial who brought the wedding hall also had a disastrous look on his face.Everyone was grieving for her, but Leah was calm. She elegantly put down the paper and straightened her back.\u201cStop. I must go. There\u2019s no time to waste.\u201d\u201cPrincess\u2026\u201d\u201cLeah!\u201d An urgent voice resounded. Leah halted in her steps, and slowly looked back to see a man of a foreboding stand, panting as he reached her.The Crown Prince of Estia, Blair.Looking at her half-brother with the dazzling silver hair, Leah smiled serenely. One of the few advantages of this terrible marriage was that it was no longer necessary for her to see Blair.Blair beckoned the servants and guards around Leah to stop loading Leah\u2019s luggage to the carriage at once. At his arrogant display of authority, Leah only looked straight at him. The sight of her not avoiding his gaze, like she used to, made Blair laugh hoarsely.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWell, well, well. Isn\u2019t it the whore who baited a large fish. She seemed to be full of herself now.\u201dIt was a remark devoid of any dignity, resembling that of a street vendor. But since she wouldn\u2019t have to deal with him anymore, now that she was to leave the palace, Leah responded without a trace of agitation.\u201cPlease step aside. If I delay any longer, I won\u2019t be able to leave the capital by today\u2019s end.\u201dThis was not the reaction he expected. Her indifference unnerved the prince and he raised his hand with a grimace. Instead of flinching, Leah gave a cold retort to the man who was about to slap him hard on the cheek.\u201cI am now the property of the Chang Jeong-baek.

Slowly he lowered his hand and strode close.\u201cDon\u2019t you ever think that this marriage can let you run away from me.\u201d A hair breath distance between them, a contemptuous whisper pierced into Leah\u2019s ear as though it was of a snake. \u201cThe day I ascend the throne\u2026 I\u2019ll be the first one to bring you back here in the capital.\u201dIt was a threat, but Leah felt no fear. Instead, a soft laugh slipped from her lips, which stabbed the prince deep in his gut. She wanted to answer back but realized that exchanging words with a senseless person would be a dire waste of her time. Without a farewell bid, she got on the carriage, completely ignoring him.When the carriage door was closed, Blair shouted and pounded against the door with his fists. But Leah couldn\u2019t hear his long-winded curses and insults anymore\u2014 she chose not to listen rather. Whatever the prince said, his words were futile\u2014a wooden spear aimed at steel.The carriage moved and with the turn of its wheels, a tear rolled from Leah\u2019s eyes.\u00a0 She pulled the curtain slightly apart and looked out of the window. The palace of Estia was rapidly moving away from her sight, from her grasp\u2026It is a place where she lived her whole life, but she felt no regret or sorrow. Leah never belonged there from the start.However, there were lingering feelings that bothered her.\u201c\u2026\u201dShe bit her lower lip and closed the curtain with a sigh. She didn\u2019t know why she kept on thinking of him. a cocky, unruly, inscrutable man.From what she heard, the brute left the palace a day ago.Ah!She scolded herself internally. It was foolish of her to miss an already broken relationship. But while cursing herself for being stupid, she still couldn\u2019t shake off the onslaught of thoughts.While lost in her musings, the carriage left the capital and reached the outskirts of the capital. Gone were the houses; what greeted them was an open plain full of grass. It was a beautiful scene, but it didn\u2019t endear her one bit. Instead, Leah just lounged down on her seat miserably.She wished time would pass quickly so that her boring and useless life ends sooner. With nothing else to do, she fluttered her eyes to a close, when suddenly, she felt a shift in the wind.A trumpet sounded amidst the tranquility that reigned. Its ear-splitting sound made Leah sit straight immediately, her hair standing on end. Following the roar of the first trumpet, horns went off one after another. Her heartbeat ran haywire at the chaotic noises that spread over the once peaceful plains.Leah drew the curtains and looked out of the window. With the sight that greeted her, she swallowed hard. Dozens of men on horseback were trailing towards their direction. The royal knights guarding her carriage shouted hurriedly.\u201cIt\u2019s an ambush!\u201dFrom this point, the carriage began to run rough. But the pursuers\u2019 movements were surprisingly agile. They simply caught up with the procession and surrounded the perimeter. The piercing sounds of instruments and shouts mingled in the air. Iron swords unsheathed rang out everywhere.Out of nowhere, a rope flew which wrapped around the throat of the knight who guarded Leah from outside of the running carriage. He then pitifully fell out of his horse, his head hitting the ground grotesquely.Arrows rained down, cutting the wind in succession. Frantic horses kicked and went wild.As she looked out the window, she saw the carriage\u2019s horseman fell to the ground. Leah closed her eyes tightly. The carriage, with only the horse dragging it, terribly shook. In no time, her whole world turned upside down.\u201c\u2026.\u201dShe gasped. The carriage was horribly overturned, its wheels broke, its door torn open. Aside from the scratches that marred her skin, it was fortunate that she survived the accident unscathed. Only, she felt dizzy, and when she finally came to her senses, Leah pushed the broken carriage door out of her way.Crawling out of the wrecked vehicle, she met the cold wind which already smelled of blood. Her head was tingled as she looked around. Royal knights were battling their pursuers on a pool of blood. But it was a meaningless battle. The royal knights were swept away in vain as if they were only nothing. One knight roared in a bloody voice.\u201cHow dare you, savages\u2013 \u201cHe was unable to speak to the end. A sharp curved blade penetrated his neck. From his throat, blood streamed to the grass. At the horrible sight, Leah covered her mouth with her hands, suppressing a shout.The images of the raiders were embedded in her vision. High-chromatic eyes, dark hairs, and tattoos on tanned skin.The men who attacked the royal procession were savages, theKurkans.Among the beastly men, a prominent figure emerged. The tall man riding a giant horse drove up to Leah.Under the disheveled dark brown hair, a hot golden eye pierced Leah. The moment their gazes met, Leah felt the air snatched from her. Breathlessly, she opened her lips.\u201cWhy\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHer whisper, barely uttered in a split voice, was quickly drowned by the man\u2019s laughter.\u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201dStretching his hand, he fetched Leah from the ground and maneuvered her to be atop his horse, fronting him. In resistance, Leah twisted her body but was simply overpowered by the man\u2019s strength. A large hand clasped her waist firmly, that she could only wriggle to no effect.With a smirk, the man behind her mumbled against the top of her head. His words sending shivers up her spine.\u201cI told you, I will ruin your life.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

To her frustration, her opinion was not heard, it being given no importance in this political marriage. She received the news without any prior discussion.Isn\u2019t Byun Gyongbaek a faithful hero of Estia? The best expression of gratitude from the royal family is you, indeed!I told you that your body belongs to the royal family. This is a duty a royal princess must bear.This is for the sake of Estia.Words that were supposed to comfort her further fueled her ire. To tie her to her duties, people start whispering to her ears, gauging her to submit to the royal decree. Byun Gyongbaek won\u2019t want a hesitant wife, after all!Upon finding out that her existence was only for the sole purpose of gearing up a beneficial treaty, she felt despair. And as soon as the immeasurable sorrow left her, anger took its stead.As her gaze raked over the official document notifying her of her union with Byun Gyongbaek, she had made up her mind. She decided to leave a long-lasting disgrace to the royal family of Estia, even if it meant an untimely death for her.As she refused to resign to the fate the royal family painted for her, a wicked plan started to take its course.Tonight, she would have an overnight company. The royal family would then be accused of giving a deflowered bride to the high and mighty Byun.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dFor a moment, as her decision took precedence, she held her breath. Her fingertips trembled badly as fear slowly crept in\u2026 Her hair stood on ends and legs slightly wobbled.However, this slip of vulnerability quickly faded; her determination remaining undampened.The night was young. Leah bit her lower lip tightly and continued to grace the street shrouded in nothing but darkness and obscenity.Drunk people walked in faltering steps underneath the lit lamps that hung between old buildings. Giggles sounded as vulgar, filthy jokes delivered in boisterous tones were spoken.Leah squeezed her cloak tight around her body. After she carefully checked each establishment that she passed by, she finally found her target place\u2014it was a shabby inn which looked like it would collapse anytime soon.The knob felt cold under her palm as he hesitantly pushed the wooden door open.The inn was already full of tipsy, intoxicated people. Naturally, she attracted some attention upon her entrance. But soon, few of those who turned their gazes to Leah lost interest in her and they continued chattering among themselves.Before coming here, she already made arrangements. Her company would be seated in the most concealed corner of this establishment, wearing a dark ensemble for the sake of discretion.Her gaze darted to every nook and cranny of the place and it was not long until a man donning dark cloaks in an inconspicuous corner caught her very attention. He was buried in the shadows, away from the bustle and hustle. At a quick glance, the man seemed to blend in darkness\u2014the shadow and him merging into one body difficult to differentiate.Leah slowly started to draw nearer the mysterious man. Upon reaching him, she tapped the table where the man was seated and instantly, the lone hand that held the wine glass froze in mid-air\u2026His hands, wrapped in leather gloves, were so big the glass it held looked like a mere toy.\u201cAre you my company tonight?\u201d She asked boldly.An agonizing second passed. The man\u2019s lips only parted before he uttered, \u201cIt seems so\u2026\u201dIt was a low and rough voice that seemed to scratch from his inside. Leah blinked hard.\u00a0 She heard that men of such pitch are gentle and beautiful.But his voice that reverberated in her ears was different from what she had imagined. Though suddenly surprised, she soon pulled herself from her musings.Anyway, once things are done right, this will soon be over.\u201cFollow me.\u201d The man directed, to which she subserviently nodded in return. He soon led her to a flight of stairs heading to the second floor of the building.The wooden stairs creaked with her every step.\u00a0 After passing through a long hallway, they entered a room at its most end. The man opened the door for her and let her inside first.Surprisingly, the rented room was the best one in the inn. Heavy draperies and cozy furniture\u2014if anything, it looked romantic and deserving of couples wanting their first night to be memorable. Such a waste though, for this night was never intended for romance. But rather, she came here with a clear agenda.Entering the room after her, the man closed and bolted the door. Its clicking sound sounded like a death sentence to Leah.There is no going back now\u2026Mustering courage, she turned around and faced the man. As she did so, she drew a sharp intake of breath.\u201c\u2026!\u201dA while ago, the man sat in the shadows and slouched low by the time he stood up, making Leah miss his towering height. Now, facing him in all his glory, an ample height difference between Leah and his chin was hard to ignore. Despite the dim light in the room, she could clearly see his broad shoulders and strong physique.She was candidly embarrassed by the stark contrast in their frames. The man must had noticed as his lips slowly twisted to a faint smile. He loosely threw his heavy cloak with one hand, revealing his face.What welcomed her was a healthy-looking bronze skin, dark brown hair and dull yet fierce eyes.In the dark, his piercing golden eyes remained clear and bright, reflecting the wildness of a beast.Though angular, his features were brutally beautiful. Filled by an overwhelming fascination for this man, she unabashedly fixed her curious gaze on him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLeah\u2019s heart raced. Her throat dried as a realization hit her.The man was not human.\u201c\u2026Kurkan?\u201d She muttered unconsciously to herself. Her mouth trembling so slightly as this taboo word was spewed carelessly. Dark skin, huge physique and golden clear eyes with intensely colored pupils were the special characteristics of a Kurkan.He raised his eyebrows and coolly conceded.\u201cIt has been a long time since a person has called me Kurkan. Nowadays, we are normally calledsavages.\u201d He said, slurring the last word.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Most continents despised them, perceiving them as barbarians or beasts. This is because their race was known to have inherited the blood of beasts\u2014their nature inhumane and indecorous. They are impulsive, indulgent and instinctive dangerous beings.But there was one thing humanity envied from them\u2014their physical ability and beauty. What monstrosity that lied underneath their skin could not dim their outstanding appearance bestowed by the Gods.This disparity gave them popularity. In fact, among slaves, the best class was always Kurkans. Even in Estia, where slavery is illegal, they were secretly traded.In fact, Princess Leah herself had seen several Kurkans sold as slaves but this was her first to see a Kurkan with an imposing aura.Her mind was in a haze, but she was sure of one thing. The man in front of her wasn\u2019t fit for sex slavery nor for humor. Rather, with his every cell exuding authority, she could imagine him looking disdainfully from above.\u201c\u2026\u201dHer body moved on its instinct. Leah stepped back, but soon she felt her back touching the wall. A hard, chilly sensation ran down her spine with her sudden entrapment.The man from the corner watched her with amusement dancing in his eyes. Slowly and leisurely, he crossed the distance between them. He went very close that their bodies touched. Instantly, Leah felt suffocated, but could only stand rigid in her place. At this moment, she found breathing a rather laborious job.With one long finger, the man flipped Leah\u2019s cap, from her head. He was a being with supreme senses and there was nothing queer he could not possibly miss. He frowned at the stiff, cheap brown wig that Leah was wearing, and tore it off right away. With nothing restraining it now, Leah\u2019s dazzling silver hair softly rolled down her waist with a faint glow.His golden eyes squinted at her. His skimming, smoldering gaze seemed to be stinging her exposed skin, boring holes to places he set them. Although she was wearing clothes, she felt naked.Slender nape, collarbone slightly exposed through the tousled clothes, and the small chest that rises and falls while she breathed laboriously, the man studied these all. It was not hard to realize that the lady he cornered was no commoner.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that a lady of your standing visits the red-light district. Is something with the aristocrats shaky, I assume?\u201dLeah straightened her tensed shoulder. Instead of refuting, she calmly opened her lips and said what reeled in her mind. \u201cIt seems that you do not know my purpose in following you\u2026\u201dShe stared up at him and felt herself die inside. She got the wrong man! But, how would she ever explain to him her mistake by not revealing who she is?\u201cPurpose?\u201d His lips twisted into a mocking smile, understanding fully her motives.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? I was only looking for fun while making sure my identity is hidden.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHe was speechless. It\u2019s not every day an aristocrat, with a failed attempt in disguising, graces this kind of place.She is hiding something.Though he got more questions he wished to be answered, he did not press her any further. On the other hand, his silence made Leah thoroughly flustered, her heart racing madly against her chest. She knew that at this moment, her face resembled a fat tomato.In embarrassment, she was forced to lower her eyes. Perhaps, the man was looking for some entertainment tonight which in the current circumstances, was granted. She, who assumed that he was a prostitute, must have piqued his interest. His body language told her he didn\u2019t have the heart to let her go any time soon.Silently, Leah finally decided on her next course of action. She would never see him again, anyway. If this is one of the prices for ruining the royal family\u2019s purity, then the means she had to do must no longer matter.With trembling hands, she clutched the edge of her skirt. From the start, she was determined to do this even if she knew that she could die. Hence, at this point, there was no reason for her to be scared.As she slowly looked up and caught his searing gaze, she noticed that his golden pupils slightly thinned and her jaw instantly fell. To witness this peculiarity in this proximity was awe-striking.Deeply enthralled, she lost track of the seconds that ticked by, but a deep, throaty chuckle brought her back to her senses.Leah then pushed the man\u2019s chest inaudibly, trying to make room between them. However, the strength of her frail arms was feeble\u2014the man was hardly moved. Instead, his smirk grew as he watched her struggle.He is sure enjoying this, she glared at him.\u201cDon\u2019t act presumptuously. I was only looking for someone to pay and have s*x with.\u201d She spat out with irritation evident in her voice. In his eyes, she was no modest woman so why would she act like one?The man only laughed hoarsely at her bluntness. He asked back with great amusement. \u201cSo, should I call you master?\u201dThis man sure is cocky. She gritted her teeth and untied the knot of her dress with trembling hands.\u00a0 She just wanted this to be over. While she tried to remove her clothes, the man whispered in her ears, making her fumbling hands freeze.\u201cI should be the one to do that.\u201dBefore she could protest, large hands lifted her body effortlessly. The man handled her as if she was only a mere child!Cradled in his arms, she looked at him, brimming in embarrassment.\u201cAre you scared?\u201d asked him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHer answer wasn\u2019t heard because as soon as he said so, he tossed her to the bed and climbed sleekly on top of her. The bed creaking underneath his weight.\u00a0 His slender fingers grabbed Leah\u2019s chin and thumb rubbed her plumped lower lip.\u201cWhy did you dare come to this place?\u201dThe voice that resonated in her ears sent small shudders to her body. Yet, his intimidation could not shatter her resolve in keeping the reason of her visit and therefore, her identity, to herself.\u201cJust do what I told you to do.\u201d She raised one brow and feigned courage. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I promise to pay you.\u201dHearing this, the man whispered in a gentle voice; his eyes shone with mischief. \u201cOpen your legs.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yet none of those made her flinch the way she did as the man on top of her spoke so coarsely.Was it because of his low, deep voice? She felt that his words were cruder and more offensive. Under his scrutiny, she tried to hide her unease while her face burned of embarrassment.The man staring at Leah\u2019s flushed face smiled and soon retracted his big hands from resting beside her face. He used them to rip off her clothes, making quick tearing sounds resonated around the chamber. Having immense strength, his rough hands weren\u2019t delicate enough to unbutton her clothes without causing damage, so he just yanked and pulled it off, succumbing to his primal instincts.Leah trembled faintly, like a sheep in the mercy of a beast. A while ago, she spoke fearlessly but couldn\u2019t hide the fear that had started to fill her. Fear from doing it for the first time\u2014and with a stranger no less!Her eyes flew open when a cold chill coursed down her body, biting her skin. She found herself wearing nothing but her undergarments. The man looked at Leah with pride, amazed by his own piece of work.In the dark room, there was only a dim light emitting from the table candle and from the moonlight peering through the cracks of the drapes. Yet, it was enough to illuminate her body, and his golden eyes scoured all over it. His stare made her shiver.Being a princess, her body had been pampered, leaving no traces of even the smallest scar. Her skin was snowy white\u2014as unblemished as her light silver hair.Leah thought that the man would immediately babble words of praise. But his face unexpectedly hardened as he uttered words she was least expecting.\u201cYou\u2019re too thin.\u201d He carefully grabbed Leah\u2019s wrist and held it gently, like a fig that would easily break in a strong blow of the wind. He muttered, \u201cDo you properly eat?\u201dHow dare\u2026 His honesty, which was almost comical, calmed Leah\u2019s frenzied nerves.She stealthily took a deep breath and then without thinking, pulled the hem of his waistband. Her hands, as if with a life of its own, moved impetuously!Instantly, his gaze moved from her wrist to the bold hand that was tugging down his trousers. He was surprised by her actions. His eyes found its way back to her delicate face.\u201cStop blabbering and just take it off,\u201d was the order of a beet-red Leah.Unlike her, the man only took off his robe and was still dressed. He smirked when she commanded him to remove his clothes and laughed when she tugged down his pants again and failed pitifully.Leah didn\u2019t know what he found funny, but the man seemed to laugh every time she spoke. Hence, she finally snapped and opened her mouth, finding it aggravating. \u201cDo not speak to me like that.\u201d\u201cLike what?\u201d\u201cLike\u2026 \u2018Open your legs.\u2019\u201d She said with a grimace.His vivid golden eyes pierced hers. Nonetheless, Leah looked at him back straight on, unafraid of his stare.He slowly craned his neck sideways, his eyes partially drooped. \u201cI am a low-born man with no education. Please forgive me, master,\u201d he asked for forgiveness which was noticeably laced withmockery.He grabbed Leah\u2019s thighs and parted them. Wedging his body in between, he was able to keep them apart that even if she wriggled and coiled her legs, it was too late. His waist had already been lodged between her legs. Not knowing what to do, she grabbed the hem of his shirt.He took this as an invitation to undress. \u201cShould I take these off one by one, master?\u201dAs the man stripped off layers of clothing hence revealing his naked torso, Leah\u2019s jaw dropped. With his clothes on, he appeared perfect\u2014dashing and strong. But when he was near naked, the truth was entirely different\u2026His tightly-knit muscles rippled on his every move. They were as delicate and beautiful as a carefully sculpted Greek statue. But his skin\u2026it was hideous.Scars of different sizes were inscribed throughout his torso, and the one on his chest looked thick and painful. Nonetheless, these angry scars made him look fiercer.Fear gripped her heart as her eyes trailed the ridges of the scars that brandished his body. The man grinned at Leah, who hadn\u2019t realized she was staring too long, and was unconsciously embracing her body. She then felt strong hands lift her buttocks and upper body from the bed while her legs were latched around his lean waist.Astounded by the sudden change in position, she touched the man\u2019s thigh for support. As she did so, she felt something hot under the palm of her hand.Ahh! She immediately took back her hand as if it was scalded. She trembled as the man clucked his tongue and pulled Leah\u2019s wrist, placing it on his shoulder.Leah closed her eyes and silently screamed. Though she had no knowledge of a man\u2019s body, she knew that he was far from being ordinary. She could not believe the hot leather-like skin she had felt under her palm.She felt hands cradled the back of her head.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBecause of his large physique, their gazes were leveled despite how Leah\u2019s legs were wrapped around him as tight as a koala hangs on a tree. The man silently looked at her for a moment, then slowly stiffened his hands. As he pressed, their faces grew closer, and he stopped when their noses nearly touched.His golden eyes sparkled, and Leah\u2019s breath hitched. His forehead bumped hers as he whispered, \u201cLet\u2019s do it in order.\u201dBefore she could say anything, he smashed his lips on hers. The kiss was light and gentle. However, it didn\u2019t last long\u2014the kiss that followed was ravenous. His hot tongue probed her lips open and surged inside her mouth.It was hot and wild. His velvety tongue roughly wandered inside her. When it left her, it found its way in, again and again, leaving her no room to breathe. He sucked her lips and did things she didn\u2019t know was possible.But as he did so, she couldn\u2019t ignore the strange sensation that slowly crept up inside her\u2026especially when she felt the unmistakable canine teeth grazing her flesh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Unlike the rough kiss, his caresses were surprisingly gentle\u2026 almost soothing. Perhaps, because he knew that no matter how sharp-tongued the woman in his arms was, she was still indisputably innocent.Breaking the kiss, his tongue swept her earlobe while one of his hands started its impish descend. From the hollow of her neck to the sides of her torso and finally cupping her heaving breasts\u2026 Instinctively, Leah stiffened at the foreign touch and braced her body for what\u2019s to come\u2014the man tightly gripped the cloth separating his palm from her nakedness and without hesitation, ripped it off.In split seconds, Leah\u2019s peaks were exposed. Meeting the cold breeze, cold, pink buds stood upright on her perky mounds. The man\u2019s eyes danced over them and soon, much to her bewilderment, he emitted a soft laugh before mumbling, \u201cCute.\u201dHer small breasts didn\u2019t even amount to half of his hands, yet he played them eagerly as if he was rewarded a funny toy. Her skin tightened under his wicked touch\u2026 The rosy buds were locked between his fingers\u2014he rubbed them in circles, pinched them even as he pleased so.Suddenly, his mouth moved to the side of her neck, where her pulse raced and jumped\u2014he tasted and nibbled hungrily. She gasped, her lips parting as she struggled to regain her normal breathing. Nonetheless, the heart that raced against her chest seemed to have escalated its notion. She couldn\u2019t help but grab the man\u2019s thick and broad shoulders while he touched her to his content.It was not long until her sensitive body had started to react to the several stimulations he was feeding her at once. Her shoulders trembled as strange feelings roused from his generous fondlings. It was somehow similar, yet different, from the feeling of being tickled.However, she rather felt bothered of the tingling sensation stemming from only one of her mounds\u2014the man had persistently touched her left breast and left the other unattended. An indistinct sound escaped from the depths of her throat as she muttered, \u201cUh\u2026 Why\u2026 Only that side\u2026\u201d\u201cNo whining. I\u2019ll get to that side in a moment.\u201d He muttered in a slight purr. Even in this heated moment, the man never ceased in teasing her\u2014in all certainty, she did not whine!But what smart retort she was about to hurl died in her throat for he soon started to suck her flesh hard and stopped only until was stained red. It was his mark\u2014staking his claim on her. Tonight, she would be no one else\u2019s but his\u2026The last place his lips reached was her right breast. Her body bent backward as his warm mouth suckled her mound hard. He held his hand firmly on the small of her back so that she couldn\u2019t get away.He gently teased her nipples with his soft tongue and gnawed with his canine, causing a slight pain. The scandalous sounds of licking and sucking filled the once quiet chamber.The lower part of her body began to throb. To conceal it, Leah had gathered her legs together\u2014or at least, had tried to. Before she could close her parted limbs, the man\u2019s hand dug between her thighs and told her sternly, \u201cThis must be wide open.\u201dA short moan escaped her lips and Leah quickly held his tongue. She couldn\u2019t believe the sound that had just come out of her. His glowing golden eyes thoroughly stared at her, watching as she slowly became aroused. Overwhelmed with the heightened senses, she hoisted her nails on his shoulders and kept her eyes closed.However, at the next moment, Leah\u2019s eyes flew wide open. She felt his hand grasped her nether part which was still covered by a thin cloth. Her body resisted, but the man did not have the slightest intention to let her go. Instead, thick fingers caressed her from the outside, causing a responding streak of pleasure zipped down inside her\u2026 The world slowed to a crawl as she found herself experiencing a foreign, enticing desire.\u201cLet\u2019s start it lightly for now.\u201d Leah looked at him quizzically, and he answered with something that took her breath away. \u201cHave you tried masturbating?\u201d***At the question, she felt dizzy for a moment.He is truly a barbarian who doesn\u2019t adhere to any culture\u2026!She managed to swallow the bitter words that nearly passed her lips. Unable to come up with anything to say, she could only shake her head.\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. It would be nice to poke this with your little fingers\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat a scoundrel!Leah wanted to make him shut his mouth which spits out nothing but obscenities. Yet, she was incapable of doing so as her mind kept drifting to the fingers that had relentlessly stroked the top of her thin underwear.\u201dWe can do it the next time\u2026 but for now,\u201d He smiled and smacked his lips into her ears. \u201cI\u2019ll make you feel good.\u201dThe man\u2019s voice sank lower than what she could have imagined was possible. He tightened his arms around her. Upon contact, his skin felt firm and hot\u2026The finger that was teasing her covered flesh gradually started to rub hard making delicious friction come alive.Swooping his head down to hers, his lips captured hers and tongue trusted repeatedly, dancing a sensual rhythm.From the moment they started, he didn\u2019t take his eyes off Leah. He watched her submit to his touch. And surely, with her senses drowned in pleasure, her underwear had started to become wet. The damp cloth clung to her damp folds, tracing its slit.Her strained thighs convulsed. The firm heat in her lower region kept fluttering and tingling. Having enough, he swept her drawers aside, revealing to himself the plump nether lips beneath. Then, a hard, foreign object touched her entrance and penetrated it\u2026His middle finger dug deeper in her wet crevice; deep until his palm was almost flat against her heat. She felt it all\u2014his finger slowly entering her walls and stretching her formidably.\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d Leah was startled and pulled her hips back\u2014a wrong move as the man, disliking her resistance, captured her hips again and stabbed his thick finger deeper instead.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHo\u2014hold on\u2026\u201d Her speech turned into a stutter, as he floundered through the narrow interior. Wet sounds of his fingers gliding against her quim was heard, making her cheeks burn.Soon, his fingers, which had been slipping in and around her red nether lips, started to curl, earning a muffled scream from Leah. She let out a moan. \u201cHuh, uh, ah, wait, stop, uh\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut as he did from the beginning, he did not heed to her at all. Stubbornly, he poked her insides faster and rougher.Leah, twisting around, looked at the man and met his golden orbs. A deep crease formed between his straight and thick eyebrows as he noticed a fat tear that rolled down her cheek. He whispered, sweeping the corners of her eyes with his free hand.\u201cWhy are you already crying? We have not yet started.\u201d A wave of passion swept over his sunken golden eyes which promised one thing\u2014a long, restless night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As it reached places, the wetter she had become.The sensation that had been creeping from her underbelly started to fill her up like wildfire. Befuddled by the growing pleasure, she pushed him away in a hurry.Unfortunately, the man was as hard as a rock and didn\u2019t budge, even an inch. Straddling him, Leah wriggled and shook her head. She hugged the man and scratched his back with her fingernails. But the surging tide of sensation did not fall, and the man didn\u2019t waver with his quest.She seemed to be driven to the edge of the cliff. As his fingers started to rub her in a rhythm, slipping in and out of her throbbing region, fireworks shot out before her very eyes.\u201c\u2026!\u201dLeah opened her eyes wide, her mouth agape. She arched, bending her back.If possible, her folds became even more drenched. Her gasps of pleasure resonated, followed by an almost unbearable sensation that racked her body.\u201cOh, uh, ah..!\u201d She groaned loud. When she came back to her senses, Leah realized that she was hanging onto the man and shaking. Her knees that she could barely feel lost its strength. She slumped into him, a total mess while her body gave out tremors.\u201cAhhh!\u201dIt was the height of her first experience in her entire life. The novel sensation of losing control of her body for a moment made her feel numb.Watching Leah sobbed, overwhelmed by the lingering mix of shame and pleasure, the corners of the man\u2019s fine lips slightly lifted.\u201cDidn\u2019t that feel good?\u201d He drawled, while his mischievous fingers crawled to tease her cl*t, hardening at his touch.As he did so, her sensitive nub soared to attention. She then realized that it was the source of all the throbbing.\u201cStop, stop\u2026\u201d she pleaded, but the man did otherwise. He laid Leah on the bed and made her hit climax one more time.\u00a0She gripped the sheets so hard that her knuckles turned white.As a small tongue revealed through her open lips, the man captured her mouth and sucked it to submission.Amidst her being torn between climax and the rough kisses, she didn\u2019t notice her thin underwear slowly being peeled away. As soon as Leah realized that it had come off, leaving her open and vulnerable to the man, she collected her legs reflexively, but was once again, spread wide by the man\u2019s callous hands.It was an unsophisticated attitude. She had never been so spread out in front of anyone. And to add to her shame, the man stared blatantly at her v*gina.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d His taunting voice made her red all over again. Unlike others, she was almost hairless underneath. His long fingers massaged the rosy petals. Leah barely answered with a groan.\u201cThat\u2019s the way it is\u2026.\u201d\u201cFrom birth?\u201dNodding her head, the man grabbed her wrist, raising her arm sharply.

She had already guessed it would be big because the man\u2019s physique was significant. But that wasn\u2019t normal. Without exaggeration, it was thicker than Leah\u2019s forearm. His p*nis, which had risen as stiff as it touched her navel, had a moist end, and the bulging tendons protruded.Kurkans inherited the blood of the beast, and his member was no less than of a beast.The man laughed as if he knew what Leah was thinking.

She could not even moan properly, the height of pleasure overwhelming her.Is this what a s*x*al int*rcouse is? What Leah imagined was just gentle kisses, soft caresses, and moderately pleasant sense of complacency. But doing it with this man was not moderate at all. She felt as if she were being eaten up alive by a beast.Her stiffened feet wobbled helplessly in the air. At an inevitable end, a strange sensation began to rise. It felt like her body was going to fall apart, for which she tried to control her, but somehow couldn\u2019t.\u201cHmm\u2026 Ugh, not like this, please slowly\u2026!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201dThe man abruptly pulled out his.

Plead (2)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Eyljee--------Leah flinched, letting out a small cry of surprise. But she quickly calmed down and hurriedly wiped up the blood that had dripped down her arm. \u201cHold still. Bandages are hard to tie,\u201d she said.However, Ishakan didn\u2019t seem to care about his wound. While Leah struggled trying to wrap his forearm, he was busy pawing at her body. His hands groped her all over. Then, with a movement of his hand, he removed Leah\u2019s wig and tossed it aside. Every time Ishakan made a move, Leah could feel Ishakan\u2019s thighs moving under her ass, destabilizing her.\u201cIf you keep moving, I won\u2019t be able to do this properly\u2026!\u201dInstead of understanding Leah\u2019s worry, Ishakan ignored her complaints, feeling content with his own actions. \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s okay to be sick.\u201dLeah gave up and tied the bandage roughly. Carefully treating Ishakan\u2019s wound while he was still writhing was useless, it was better to finish treating him quickly.Because of the thickness of her forearm, she had used more fabric than she expected. As she tied the last knot, his muscles contracted. She looked at him, asking, \u201cDoesn\u2019t it hurt?\u201dHe answered without thinking. \u201cIt hurts.\u201d\u201cIs it too tight? Do you want me to loosen the bandage a little?\u201d asked Leah, worried that she had been too careless.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that,\u201d Ishakan said, his voice sounded husky. And when he lifted his hips, something large, warm and firm bumped into her from underneath. She could feel the solid outline of his manhood and froze. \u201cHere,\u201d he whispered.Leah was still as a statue. Her hands, which had been moving awkwardly on Ishakan\u2019s arm before, stopped touching him. They remained in the air trembling, as Ishakan licked Leah\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cCan you treat this too?\u201d\u201c\u2026Shut up before I tie that with a bandage too.\u201dLeah\u2019s face was flushed while she finished adjusting the knot of the blindfold, ignoring Ishakan\u2019s laughter. Before she could feel satisfied with her accomplishment, however, Ishakan deftly caressed Leah\u2019s cheeks.\u201cPlease touch me, Leah,\u201d he pleaded.Leah suddenly regretted offering her help. She wanted to take it all back, but at the same time, she didn\u2019t. As Leah struggled with her inner conflict, Ishakan\u2019s er3ction pressed against her body once again, and the intense heat of the er3ction made her lose her sanity.She climbed off his lap and knelt on the floor in front of Ishakan, between his legs. Leah breathed with determination. She reached her trembling hand forward and slowly unraveled the top of his pants. She tried to remind herself that she was doing this only to help Ishakan, who had suffered an arm wound to save her, but she was anxious, disconcerted by the daring nature of her actions.As she was about to pull down his underpants, the last barrier standing between her and his raw skin, she hesitated for a considerable time. She could see the distinct cylindrical outline of his form, and it frightened her.However, despite her protests internally, her hand moved as if it had a mind of its own, tugging at the thin fabric of Ishakan\u2019s underwear. Out came his thick and throbbing manhood.Although she had experienced him inside her several times before, this was the first time she had simply touched him. Leah\u2019s eyes widened as his manhood swelled even more. Now that she was sober, the shape and color of his manhood would remain etched in her brain very vividly.Already dripping at its tip, Ishakan\u2019s er3ction seemed to throb and increase in size the more she looked at him. She watched it lengthen until it reached his abdomen.\u2018Even in these circumstances, I have to do something\u2026\u2019She wondered how she could help him get back to normal. Then, she thought of Ishakan\u2019s personality, a man without a conscience, and wanted to put it inside her.\u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to eat him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLeah avoided looking at his manhood before carefully reaching out to touch it with her fingertips. It was warm. Even though she didn\u2019t know what to do, she held it in her small hand. Its size was unusually large, and it was difficult to hold in one hand, so she took it with both hands, unsure how to proceed. Other than her curiosity, she knew nothing, so she looked to Ishakan for guidance.He was staring at her, studying her every movement and expression.\u201cTry moving your hands,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout too much abruptness\u2026\u201dAt his request, her long fingers brushed his for3sk!n.Leah felt heat rise to her cheeks, warming her body. She bowed her head to hide her blush and closed her eyes so as not to watch his hand on her manhood. But she couldn\u2019t block out the sound of her caresses, nor Ishakan\u2019s husky voice, infused with pleasure.\u201cOh, haaa\u2026\u201dThe heavy and low noises were coaxing her ears. As if struggling to control himself, Ishakan grabbed Leah\u2019s waist, slapping her ass several times, whispering her name like a mantra.\u201cLeah\u2026\u201dEvery time he mentioned her name, Leah felt something strange inside her. A tingling sensation gripped her, messing into her insides. Sharp teeth bit lightly into Leah\u2019s neck, scraping the smooth surface of her skin before releasing her. The man\u2019s action awakened strange desires in her.Ishakan slowly raised his head and Leah gently opened her eyes. When their gazes met, she couldn\u2019t help herself. She rushed forward, kissing his lips.Ishakan pressed Leah\u2019s mouth against his, and nibbled it. Even as she snorted and felt breathless, he didn\u2019t let her go. Saliva dripped from the corners of Leah\u2019s lips as he greedily devoured her mouth.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHer body trembled. Inadvertently, she rubbed the tip of his gl4ns and moved her fingers along it. It looked like something was going to come out of Ishakan because he tensed, and Leah\u2019s hand throbbed.

He squinted his eyes as she stared with eyes full of tears. He muttered something in a language she didn\u2019t understand. It was the Kurkan\u2019s tongue.Then, he swept away his sweaty hair to the back of his head. He gave a brief warning\u2014touching her flushed white hips and soon gripping it\u2014a sure sign of a beginning.\u201cStop looking at me like that.\u201dShe didn\u2019t understand what he was talking about. However, she was not given a chance to do so as he grabbed her hips\u2014his lean waist tightening as he pounded savagely.With his rough handlings, Leah felt that her small body would be torn apart anytime soon.She turned red in embarrassment, mainly because of her position. Her lower body was in the air\u2014an uncomfortable position where her waist was almost bent with her thighs flushed against his muscled torso. All the while, his thick and long gro*n rubbed against her tender inner skin.\u201cAh! Uhmm\u2026 Ahh!\u201dSuddenly, a guttural sound came to her ears. The beastly man groaned in sheer pleasure as her insides shook and tightened.

Leah screamed frantically.\u201cOh! Ahhh! You\u2014you\u2019re too fast!\u201dContrary to her pleads, the man didn\u2019t seem to go slower. For the seconds that followed, neither the two of them said a word\u2014only the squeaking, gasping breaths, crying, and moaning filled the room.Nestling his head on the hollow of her neck, Leah bit his shoulder hard and scratched his back with her fingernails. As it became unbearable, her teeth sank on the man\u2019s exposed neckline. Soon, both of their eyes met.\u201c\u2026.\u201dLeah paused. She felt herself drown in his heated gaze. The eyes that glinted gold was indeed the eyes of a beast.But she wasn\u2019t able to gaze for long. For at the next moment, he kissed her, and Leah opened her lips without hesitation this time.The bed underneath them creaked that Leah thought it would collapse. But even with the bed protesting under his wild thrusts, the man pounded carelessly. His rock-hard chest pressed down on Leah\u2019s body.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dThe man let out a hot moan. His m*nhood swelled up, and a liquid gushed out. It shot all over her lower part. Abnormal amounts of it filled her, hence it could be seen dripping.With relief that it was finally over, her exhausted drooped on the bed. Eyes heavily lidded, she took a moment to pacify her chaotic breath.She couldn\u2019t believe he came inside her.She was told that if certain special conditions were not met, Kurkans could not become pregnant or could impregnate. Nevertheless, the man who came inside without a word of notice seemed ill-mannered.However, there would be no point in addressing his rudeness. Leah blushed and breathed hard without saying anything.She felt a little better, so she raised her body carefully. The man still had his g*nit*ls lodged between her legs. When he pulled back gently, his meat slipped out, creating sticky sounds.Her body trembled by the sensation of his liquid flowing out.

Leah felt the moist, thick fingers rub her rosebuds.Embarrassingly enough, she found such vulgar action very arousing, every time the man pinched her ladies, something would splatter from below and smear the sheets.The unmistakable heat in her lower belly had fired up, consuming her will to resist.Without realizing it, she lifted her hips for him, letting her upper body collapse to the bed with her back curved beyond comfort. As she reclined as such, her globes were in the air\u2014a much convenient position for the man behind.She could not stand it anymore. That last bit of reasoning that she had faintly flew away.He roared like a beast and fell on her back, biting the soft skin of the nape of her neck.Hot breaths and kisses rained on her slender neck and shoulders. Bodies covered in sweat were joined. Bare limbs intertwined tightly in the dark\u2026Large hands grasped Leah\u2019s face to the side, and a thick tongue intruded her mouth.He rammed deeper and faster. His hands were locked onto her waist as his thrusts became more violent\u2026 more powerful. Leah soon reached another release; her whole body stiffening up at the sensation that left her weak.After several thrusts, the man finally let out a groan as he, too, finished off.The hot fluid shot to her insides, and Leah trembled without a sound. Her tears made her vision cloudy. Tired lids soon fluttered to a close, and before she knew it, she passed out.***\u201c\u2026.\u201dPain\u2026 Everything felt painful.Leah\u2019s eyes flashed open. As soon as she saw the strange wooden ceiling hovering above her, her heart droppedHer faltering breath came to her ears\u2014she felt suffocated. Slowly, she turned to her side, and her breath hitched immediately at the sight that welcomed her. A man was sleeping with his long arms and legs wounded around her form.The two of them were bare as the day they were born, but Leah didn\u2019t feel cold. Despite the icy air of dawn, the heat coming off the man kept her warm.Leah glanced over her body. It seemed that he had washed her while she was unconscious. For a second, she felt thankful. But as soon the memories of last night flooded her mind, she barely swallowed back the vulgar words that came up to her throat.It was an unbelievable experience. The utterly new sensation had split and pierced her together repeatedly. Throughout the heated evening, he had been nothing but rough and unforgiving to her.Her cheeks tinged red. Despite his callousness, she had to admit that it was indeed pleasurable\u2026The night was still vivid in her mind. It would be a memory she wouldn\u2019t forget until she breathed her last.She let out a small sigh. Even though she made a stupid mistake of approaching the man, she had still met her goal\u2014she had been deflowered\u2014a damaged good of the royal family.It would be bright outside soon.Now, she had to return to the palace immediately. Carefully, she moved the heavy, thick arms on top of her. Doing this task, she forgot to breath\u2026 afraid that the man would wake up from his deep slumber.\u201c!!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c!!\u201dBurly arms quickly wrapped around her waist, lips clung onto her ear, and a low, hoarse voice whispered.\u201c\u2026. Where are you going?\u201dUnder heavy lids, sharp golden eyes glowered at Leah. She pushed his arm away and said, \u201cOne night\u2026\u201dHer voice came out gravelly. It was because of the coquettish screaming last night. Blushing, she belatedly cleared her voice and spoke again with much fervor, \u201cThat one-night recreation is over now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead, he eyed Leah\u2019s body, which didn\u2019t have even the slightest scar and licked his lips.\u201cLet\u2019s do it one more time.\u201dShe opened her mouth in astonishment. Unlike Leah, who was sore and aching all over, he showed no signs of fatigue. A sharp glint started reflecting in his eyes, which were dim just a moment ago.Leah shook her head in disgust as she felt the familiar scorching heat rising in the chamber.The man let out a deep chuckle. However, he still wrapped his arms around her delicate waist, trapping her for good. Unrelentless, Leah kicked and wriggled out from his grasp but suddenly stopped upon noticing something.Her eyes studied his body. Last night, they had a hot exchange in the dark. Hence, she missed this queer detail.The man\u2019s body was clean, devoid of any tattoo.All Kurkans that Leah had seen before weretattooed. Whether it was on their face, neck, and forearms, their skin bore large tattoos. This man, whom she recently shared intimacy, was the first Kurkan whose skin was clean of ink\u2026His golden eyes, domineering physique, and immeasurable strength\u2014she was sure he was a member of the barbaric clan, but she could not understand why he was without a single mark.The man, who noticed her looking at his body with her brows furrowed, hugged her closer.\u201cWhat are you curious about?\u201dFrowning, she looked up at his face, \u201cYou don\u2019t have tattoos\u2026 Get a little farther so I can see.\u201dWith her free arm, she pushed him away, but he remained close to her. To divert her attention, he left a trail of kisses on her cheeks and nose.\u201cLet us exchange information, one by one. If you answer my question, I will answer yours.\u201dBefore Leah could agree, he threw out his first question.\u201cWhy did you throw away your first experience overnight with an enemy?\u201dIn the kingdom of Estia, the purity of the bride was paramount. This was an even more vital matter for the nobles as chastity could reflect the honor of the family. Hence, an impure bride could be legally divorced and, in worst cases, killed.Not to mention Leah was a royal princess that would soon participate in an essential political marriage. If found impure, her honor would plummet to the ground, and so would her family\u2019s.There were many reasons she took this path. She didn\u2019t want to give her purity to some old man 25 years older than her\u2014one she had not met, one who seeks for fresh, younger meat to satiate his needs.The marriage life awaiting her was no better either. Just like most wives of powerful nobles like Byun Gyongbaek, she would live a miserable life in his mundane palace. She would be wasting her youth. To her, this would be a more painful death.The royal family sold her like a high-end product, thus, she would rejoice in ruining their reputation. Most of all, she wanted to let go of the troubling and painful life she had.However, she could tell the man, so Leah avoided his gaze and just bit her lips.\u201c\u2026..\u201dSensing her reluctance, the man didn\u2019t ask further. He smiled, laid on his side with one hand cradling his chiseled chin. He looked at Leah and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to run away?\u201dThe thought was promising and genuinely tempting. At the edge of being persuaded, Leah came to her senses. It sounded like it could solve all her problems, but she knew that it would never happen.She sighed, realizing that if she had let her guard down just a little more, she would have been unraveled by the man.Truthfully, If she really wanted to, she could easily run away. The royal family had been rotting for a long time, and Leah had taken responsibility over the majority of the palace\u2019s jobs herself. A little help, courage, and luck, she could leave Estia.However, she didn\u2019t want to do that. She didn\u2019t want to live her whole life being chased like a criminal. Rather, she desired to leave this world and leave the royal family on their misery. And above all else\u2026She felt empty.From the moment she realized she had been completely abandoned by her family, she had lost the will to live. She no longer wanted to live. Her hate was not directed to the royal family alone, but also to herself. She abhorred herself for devoting her life foolishly to the family who treated her awfully.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTo retaliate and end her life, this was what Leah wanted the most. She slowly closed and opened her eyes. The man was silently waiting for her answer.A one-night stand. Someone she would never see again.

Confidential words spewed out, Leah tightly zipped her lips to a close.The man, for the first time, became quiet\u2014astonished as if he suddenly forgot how to speak. Staring to his face, anticipating a reaction, Leah found herself jolt in shock.She saw a stir in his golden eyes\u2014his pupils narrowed, and a red color encircled it like a girdle.She was frightened for a moment, and hairs on her body stood on ends. The man, noticing the fear he was inciting in her, heavily sighed.He ruffled his hair, wiped his face, and for a moment, covered his eyes.And when his eerie gaze was revealed again, the menacing look in his eyes had vanished, masked with his usual relaxed countenance.The man dragged Leah\u2019s small body atop his belly. He gathered her silver hair to one side, and spoke with his lips lightly pressed against her exposed white nape.\u201cAs for my story\u2014the Kurkan who doesn\u2019t have tattoos\u2014I\u2019ll tell you the next time we meet,\u201d A faint smile crept up his lips, his eyes shone with a mischievous glint, \u201cIt will be quite fun.\u201dHow absurd.He seemed quite certain that he would meet her again. Knowing the vanity his words, Leah laughed in silence. The expectant smile he wore would likely crumble at any moment.He asked again, narrowing the gap between his brows, \u201cHold on to your life until I finish telling you my story, alright?\u201dAs long as it stayed as an empty, meaningless agreement, she would tolerate it. Leah nodded nimbly, watching him as he dragged his enormous body up from the bed, letting her head rest on a pillow instead.\u201cLet\u2019s eat something.\u201dHis beautiful back muscles twisted and stretched, so did his angular shoulders, narrow hip and spine. Although his frame was big, she found his back-side rather cute. It looked so tight.She had been blankly staring at the naked man wandering around when her gaze unconsciously traveled south and met his erect member. In a hurry, she pulled the blanket, covering her body like a cocoon.She couldn\u2019t believe they were so casually talking naked!An exquisite specimen, he was confident with his skin\u2014overly confident, that is.This man knows no decency! A shameless behavior of a barbarian.Despite this, Leah couldn\u2019t take her eyes off him and found herself having a hard time integrating his delectable image to the word \u201cbeast.\u201dWith a tray on one hand, he peered at Leah wrapped tightly in the blanket and laughed. Nonetheless, he didn\u2019t take the sheet from her. \u201cCold, huh?\u201dInstead, he sat close beside her and balanced the tray on his knee. On it laid a stew full of meat and vegetables and a loaf of wheat bread with raisins. The stew was a little lukewarm as it was prepared before she woke up.Not having much of an appetite, she refused and turned her head away. But the man forced her to hold the spoon and all Leah could do was to accept the tray of stew and bread, which was now in small pieces\u2014the man tore it beforehand for her.It was a lovely dish for a shabby inn.The stew was odorless, and the wheat bread was soft. Although she didn\u2019t want to eat, her appetite grew as she popped food into her mouth. After a while, she finally felt full, so she tapped the tray, and the man met her eyes.Understanding what she wanted, he shook his head. Instead of taking back the tray, he tore off a large piece of bread, dipped it into the stew, and handed it to her.\u201cEat more. You\u2019re thinner than the winter branches.\u201dLeah devoured what he had given her, softly chewing the moistened bread. Was it because she was hungry or was it just her feelings clouding her judgment? She wasn\u2019t sure why, but the plain stew and wheat bread tasted more delicious than the delicacies of the royal palace.While she ate heartily, the man took care of her without saying a word. As she chewed, she constantly snuck sideways glances at him as he tore the bread diligently.The fairly large piece of bread in her hands seemed small in his. Although Leah was petite and thin compared to women her age, she felt like a little kid when she was with him.She stole an observant gaze at his bulging forearm. Indisputably, Leah\u2019s forearms combined would barely amount to one of his. Even his thighs were so thick they could pass as a tree stump.This scrutiny made her remember the passion they shared last night. After all those rigorous activities, he looked far from being weary. No wonder, it\u2019s all because of his fit body\u2014and those sculpted muscles rippling as he moves.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhat am I thinking?Quickly, she shook off the thoughts that were rebelliously filling her head. When the man caught her sizing him up, his brows furrowed as he said, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that.\u201dAskance, she could not figure out what had offended him. Hence, she blinked her eyes at the words that sounded like an admonishment.With a straight face, the man pointed his finger to his lower body\u2014where his length, looking as excited as ever, begged for her attention.Hence, from then on, Leah concentrated on eating the food he handed her without sparing him a single glance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His face crumpled, questioning why she only ate that little. He was about to protest when Leah stood and pushed the tray toward him.It was time to go back to being Estia\u2019s princess.Time was running, and she couldn\u2019t afford to be seen in the daylight.As soon as she set foot on the ground, her lower half stiffened and her legs trembled beneath her. Nonetheless, \u00a0she dressed casually, as if nothing had happened. She covered her bare body, wrapping layers of clothes around her, concealing her bare skin so well it seemed enclosed by a hard shell.After flipping over her wig and pinning the hem of her robe, Leah looked exactly the same as when she first entered the inn.She looked back at the man. He was still sitting on the bed, watching Leah with enthralled eyes.Approaching him, Leah dropped a gold coin on his lap and said, \u201cI had fun.\u201dThe man pouted at the coin, which felt cold against his skin. He calmly picked it up and handed it back. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Then, his eyes crinkled as he smiled generously. \u201cLet\u2019s meet again, master.\u201d<b>\u2654\u2654\u2654</b>A pre-arranged wagon waited behind the inn. Leah asked the horseman for help and pretended to be a maid working in the palace.\u201cPlease take me there.\u201dAs soon as she hopped into the carriage, she felt exhaustion kicked in. A sound of pain escaped from her lips\u2014her whole body throbbed as if she had been beaten.To Leah\u2019s horror, the horseman drove the carriage roughly. With a pale face, she closed her eyes as the old carriage heavily rattled. She was lucky enough to have eaten, though she had been vexed with the man for making her. If she hadn\u2019t, she would have been more nauseous at this moment.She was dropped off at the palace\u2019s back door, where the maids entered and gave coins as payment for the horseman. She made sure that the horseman left before she started on her way.She knew that the palace guards\u2019 shift, routes, and stations were tightly in place. But because of this knowledge, she was able to evade them and wander around the palace\u2019s high wall connected to a lush forest. As she fumbled and pressed down the wall, it moved inaudibly, revealing a black passage of the palace.This passage was only one among the many secret passages of the palace of Estia. Nonetheless, these tunnels remained a top-secret kept only known to the royal family. In fact, during the occasional renovations, the workers were chosen strictly\u2014those whose executions were nearing got to work on this passage to keep the secret from spreading.However, as the years passed, some passages were forgotten, and so was the passage Leah took.After a long walk, she skillfully sneaked to her chamber, and thereon, barely managed from collapsing into her soft, plush bed.She reeked of the familiar smell of the town. Hence, she grabbed a perfume and sprayed it all over her, distinguishing the scent.Dressed in a thin nightgown, she combed her long hair neatly and tidied up the mattress.Rather than being spoiled, princesses were expected to be disciplined\u2014Leah\u2019s chamber was neatly organized. She couldn\u2019t show any imperfection to the maids who would come to wake her in the morning. With everything perfectly set, Leah finally rested her head on the pillow.As she looked through the window, a faint light escaped through the gap of the open drapes. Dawn was breaking in the distant sky and she would soon need to start her morning work. But for now, she needed more sleep. She must replenish her strength.However, her mind refused to give her peace. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to rest\u2014things that happened just a few hours ago would suddenly wreak havoc in her head.Specifically, the man\u2019s image flashed in her thoughts. Now that she was no longer with him, the chilly air bit her skin. His body temperature, which had previously engulfed her, was hot enough to ignore the blankets. Because of his size, she felt that the bed in the inn was small even when they were snuggled close together.Most of all, his rude, blunt words remained a vivid memory. His words were surprisingly vulgar, but his touch was soft and warm.He did not treat Leah as a noblewoman. Because of that, she was able to act without any pretense, even so, act waywardly.When she thought of what happened, she felt at ease.When one is faithful to one\u2019s instincts, like a beast, there was nothing to worry about\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLet\u2019s meet again, master. His words rang in her ears.Could it be that I might actually\u2026see him again?As she reminisced on the moment she spent with him and the conversations they had, Leah scornfully laughed. She found it ridiculous, her fishing for some hope that she would once more lay her eyes on him.Like a mirage in the desert, it was an illusion her whimsical mind had created. Very soon, death would claim her; hence, she must push this budding hope to the back of her mind.He was a man with a mysterious identity\u2014she did not even know his name. Everything was just a wild dream.Letting go of the man\u2019s memories, she closed her eyes and sought warmth by hugging her soft blankets tightly in the darkness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As a matter of fact, most of the well-known artists in history belong to this vast kingdom.These great artists loved their homeland so much that they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to dedicate their work to their beloved royal family.Reflecting the essence of the aesthetically beautiful kingdom was its palace, located at its very heart. A pinnacle of art, the castle of Estia didn\u2019t disappoint either. According to historians, it was breath-taking\u2014a sight to behold.It was built with red bricks and gray stone and painted with a special varnish which glittered gracefully under the sun. The beautiful exterior alone was spectacular, but the interior was even more magnificent.Elegant vertical columns and long corridors lead to dozens of rooms, each of which was embellished with white marble and other colored stones, gold, and gems.Moreover, the halls were adorned with beautiful masterpieces\u2014sculptures and paintings, made by remarkable artists. Such a shame though, the royal family cared naught for them. They were mere ornaments and didn\u2019t deserve any care, and thus, they were damaged with time.However, everyone knew that unlike the palace\u2019s splendid shell, the humans in its core were wretched.The nobles no longer feared the king\u2014the ruler of Estia was once highly respected and even regarded as powerful as the sun. But now, he would pale in comparison to a small lamp.Stubborn as he was, the king clung to his meaningless pride and turned a blind eye to reality, even when his sovereign power hit rock bottom.The betrothal of the royal princess was a clear indication of the royal family\u2019s downfall. Byun Gyeongbaek of Oberde wanted no one but Princess Leah, and the royal family had quickly sold her off\u2014without any objection and careful consideration.The military power of Byun Gyeongbaek of Oberde protected the frontier from the Kurkans\u2014a power that should\u2019ve belonged to the nation\u2019s king. To flaunt his wealth and supremacy, he wore purple clothes\u2014 something only the royalty could afford andshouldafford.The purple dye was a rare and precious commodity in the kingdom\u2014it could only be extracted by crushing thousands of shells of snails living in warm waters.On top of that, the dye obtained from crushing a thousand of these tiny animals was just enough to stain only a small piece of cloth.And because Byun Gyeongbaek monopolized the supply of dye, there were times when even the royal family couldn\u2019t get their hands on it.Byun Gyeongbaek\u2019s arrogance was criticized by many, but they could only talk behind his back. No one dared to openly defy him.The powerless king of the royal family couldn\u2019t even dream to stop him. In fact, it would\u2019ve been more logical to call Byun Gyeongbaek a king instead.\u201c\u2026 Princess, shall I call for the new carriage?\u201dLeah came back to her senses upon hearing Countess Melissa\u2019s voice. The countess\u2019smile softened, gazing at the princess. She knew that Leah was lost in her thoughts, so she woke her up from her stupor in a courteous manner.\u201cThank you, Countess.\u201dLeah couldn\u2019t believe that she got distracted while in the middle of doing her job. She could only blame herself, but she didn\u2019t have a choice. It was all because of the message that Cerdina sent through a servant this morning.<b>A dinner with Cerdina\u2026It was Leah\u2019s worse nightmare. She tried to conceal it, but from the moment she\u2019d received the message, she was on edge.She accidentally bit her tongue. This was not the time to think of such things. Countess Melissa wasn\u2019t the only one with her. The minister of finance and the court\u2019s count were accompanying her as well. Leah tried to calm her nerves and concentrate on her work again.At this moment, she was looking over the work of the officials of the royal palace. Since she was in charge of most of the royal matters, she was assigning tasks and giving instructions about the details to make up for the time that would be lost due to the wedding.The royal family may have abandoned Leah, but the people were innocent. She wanted to carry out her responsibilities until the end.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of reorganizing the tax system one last time before I leave the palace.\u201dLeah handed out the documents that she\u2019d prepared beforehand. She gave them to Laurent, the minister of finance, who sighed and then passed it to Count Valtein.Count Valtein\u2019s expression immediately turned serious. He murmured, stroking his handsome mustache.\u201cI think there will be a lot of resistance from Great Britain, especially from Byun Gyeongbaek of Oberde\u2026\u201dCount Valtein wanted to say more, but caught himself in time. Sharp on her senses, Leah was able to pick up on his expression. Countess Melissa was glaring at the count as she stood right beside him. For Leah and her subordinates, Byun Gyeongbaek was nothing short of an enemy.\u201cCountess.\u201d\u201cMy apologies, Princess.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until Leah called her that Countess Melissa stopped throwing daggers at the count. Impassive of the exchange between the two, Leah fixed a look at Count Valtein as he continued speaking.\u201cContinue.\u201dHer cool voice did not contain any emotions. Count Valtein carefully continued speaking.\u201cByun Gyeongbaek recently used the barbarians as an excuse to ask for a reduction of the taxes being imposed on Oberde.\u201dLeah furrowed her brows. The biggest reason behind Byun Gyeongbaek\u2019s power was the Kurkans; he used them as an excuse to enjoy all kinds of exclusive benefits. Even though he already enjoyed numerous privileges compared to the other rulers, he vigorously kept asking for more.As Leah dipped her quill in ink, she opened her mouth.\u201cThere is no end to his greed. At this point, an invasion by the Kurkans would benefit us more.\u201dCount Valtein and Laurent cleared their throats in chorus. Leah tried to hide an amused smile as Countess Melissa laughed out loud at their discomfort.\u201cDoesn\u2019t your secretary communicate with them? First, let\u2019s check whether Oberde needs the tax cuts. We\u2019ll make the decision based on those findings.\u201d\u201cOkay, princess. We\u2019ll proceed as you say.\u201dLaurent replied politely. Leah hesitantly signed the document and muttered bitterly under her breath.\u201cOr maybe it would be better if I myself go to Oberde.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dSilence filled the office. Her unconscious words created a heavy atmosphere. She felt herself become still\u2014she regretted spilling her thoughts like that. Now the atmosphere was awkward and suffocating no less.Luckily, a voice from outside intervened, breaking the tension.\u201cMy Royal Highness, this is Baroness Sinael.\u201d\u201cPlease enter.\u201dBut as soon as Leah saw the baroness\u2019 anxious countenance, Leah braced herself for awful news. Nonetheless, her calm exterior didn\u2019t shatter.Baroness Sinael worked at the main palace, and her visits would always mean grave news. She entered the office, her face looking pale and tired.

They\u2019re said to have existed on the continent even before history was first recorded.They lived in the cluster of deserts located at the western end of the continent and were divided into tribes based on the kind of beast each one inherited their blood from.Only one person could unite these tribes\u2014the king of Kurkans.How exactly the king came to power, no one knows. However, most guess that it was based on the concept of survival of the fittest.The continent condemned the savage behavior of the Kurkans and called them barbarians. The main cause of their disdain was due to this race\u2019s custom of marriage by captivity.Companionship was extremely precious to the Kurkans. The moment they deemed someone to be their mate, they would resort to all sorts of means to obtain their hand. If they couldn\u2019t capture them through lawful means, they wouldn\u2019t hold back from committing a crime, even going as far as to abducting them forcibly doing whatever they pleased.However, the countries of the continent could only criticize this practice verbally. They wouldn\u2019t dare take military action. And that was because they\u2019d already tasted defeat.In the past, the countries had formed a coalition and tried to invade the Kurkans\u2019 lands.On the surface, it was a war that condemned the customs of Kurkans, but their real intention was different. The coalition\u2019s insidious desire was to capture a large quantity of Kurkans, and sell them at a high price as slaves. Parties with the same interests allied themselves with the coalition and ambitiously participated in the conquest, but it soon disintegrated.The land of the beasts\u2026This bears no exaggeration.The continent\u2019s people could never get used to the climate of the Kurkan\u2019s lands. The hot sun blazed right above their soil during daytime. And at night, the ground turned cold like ice. They simply couldn\u2019t comprehend how the barbarians managed to live there.However, the climate was the least of their troubles. The Kurkans were born to be great warriors. They were sharp, brave, and knew every inch of the desert. Hence, Kurkans played with the Allied forces like toys, attacking them by using topography and climate to their advantage. After suffering from a series of miserable defeats, they decided to retreat forever.To this day, the continent chooses to tolerate the Kurkans\u2019 presence, left with no choice. And the Kurkans lived in their isolated world, with no interference from the continent.But now, the delicate peace was about to be broken.\u2654\u2654\u2654This was the first time the Kurkans asked for an audience with the other countries on the continent. The belligerents wanted peace and were seeking harmony.However, Leah honestly couldn\u2019t believe that. She knew all about that the present king bloodthirsty nature. He wore a bloodied crown, having seized the throne after killing the previous king. For that fierce and violent man wanted peace? Something must be amiss.Estia was located near Kurkan\u2019s border, and in case a massive war broke out, Estia would be the first country to take the blow and would suffer the most. So, she needed to start planning right away.Leah\u2019s mind was racing when suddenly, the thought of a man she spent a night with suddenly popped into her mind. The arrogant Kurkan who tricked her by assuming the identity of a prostitute, Leah somehow imagined him wearing a crown\u2026She could picture his conceited yet beautiful face vividly. The brilliance that exuded from his bright eyes was forever seared in her mind. Undoubtedly, he would\u2019ve been a perfect match for the splendid golden crown.However, the idea that the king of Kurkan went to the illegal prostitution quarters of a foreign country and pretended to be a pleasure worker was absurd and impossible. Leah shuddered at the ridiculous thought and calmly examined the situation.\u201cWhat did His Majesty say?\u201d\u201cIt was a demand for us to have friendly relations with them. He asked whether we could accept it right away. He also requested us to prepare for a conference with the Kurkans.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dA welcoming conference for the Kurkans\u2026The mere thought of it was irritating. The aristocrats were always starving for amusement and would surely not miss this opportunity. And among those greedy bastards was Byun Gyeongbaek of Oberde.Tired, Leah pressed her temples. Just the thought of meeting him made her head ache. She\u2019d hoped to avoid him as much as possible until their wedding day, but now, there was nothing she could do.\u201cl guess we need to prepare for this special guest\u2019s welcome.\u201dCount Valtein nodded his head, tension evident in his eyes. Leah sighed with resignation.Meeting the new king of Kurkan and Byung Gyeongbaek of Oberde, who\u2019s been fighting against Kurkan all his life, at the same time? Nothing could be worse than this.She could only hope for a bloodbath to not occur in the conference hall.\u2654\u2654\u2654The afternoon ended with the finalizing the plans and discussions of details of the welcome conference. By the time they finished an informal inspection of the banquet hall, the sun had already started setting.Now, it was time for her to go back to the queen\u2019s quarters.Reluctantly, Leah stepped towards the palace, and the closer she got, the stiffer her body became, her chest heaving with heavy breaths.The maids of the queen\u2019s quarter approached her. Unlike her bright and cheery maids, the queen\u2019s maids wore a gloomy look. Their faces lacked any kind of emotion as they muttered under their breaths.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLeah followed the pallid looking lady maids, who escorted her to the reception room. All the servants soon retreated as the doors closed behind them.Leah spoke carefully, \u201cMother.\u201d\u201cOh? You\u2019ve arrived?\u201d The pretty woman\u2019s face bloomed like a flower, as if her joy came straight her heart. To anyone else, her smile would\u2019ve seemed gorgeously refreshing.Her brown, curly hair was swept to one of her neck, and the droopy shape of her blue eyes made her seem kindhearted. Just by her appearance, one could tell her delicate nature. Cerdina, the queen of Estia, was the exact opposite of Leah.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you, Leah.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leah trembled slightly but quickly suppressed it, not wanting to appear nervous. Since all her attention was on Cerdina, she failed to notice her surroundings.The room was filled with colorful dresses and jewelry boxes. Cerdina gently smiled and explained it to a surprised Leah, \u201cByun Gyeongbaek sent all these presents for you. They\u2019re extremely precious and beautiful\u2026\u201dHe must\u2019ve known that if he sent the gifts to her, she would\u2019ve returned them. So, he sent them directly to the queen\u2019s quarters.The thought of wearing ornaments chosen by him made her sick. She wanted to get rid of them right away. But now that they were in Cerdina\u2019s hands, there was nothing she could do but accept it.Cerdina picked up a velvet box and pulled out a glittering necklace, embellished with expensive jewels. Leah meekly approached her and sat down. Leah felt the cold metal touch her bare skin as Cerdina put the necklace on her. The moment she heard the click of the latch locking, she felt herself being bound by shackles.Cerdina repeatedly complimented the necklace. \u201cIt really suits you! The moment I saw it, I thought it was meant just for you. Byun Gyeongbaek sure has great taste.\u201dLike always, Leah replied with an air of indifference, \u201cThank you, Mother.\u201dContent on seeing her wear the necklace, Cerdina smiled. With graceful movements, she got up and held out her hand towards Leah. Leah reluctantly accepted the gesture and the two of them headed to the dining hall.As they seated themselves, Leah was on the edge. She paid careful attention to her movements, trying not to make any mistake.Time went by as they dined on light appetizers, the main course consisting of seafood and meat, and a sweet dessert. The whole time, they kept making small talk.\u201cToo bad Blaine can\u2019t be with us. He\u2019s so addicted to hunting\u2026\u201d\u201cHe promised to catch a fox for you, didn\u2019t he, mother?\u201d\u201cYes, he\u2019s the only one who takes care of me. As his mother, I\u2019m happy with his extreme devotion towards his parents, but I\u2019m afraid I might get jealous once he becomes the crown prince.\u201dAs the meal came to an end, Leah\u2019s gaze landed on the cake in front of her while she sipped on the wine. The man\u2019s voice lingered in her ears, urging her.Eat more. You\u2019re thinner than the winter branches.He\u2019d insisted on her having a lot of bread and stew. A bitter smile bloomed on her face as she thought of him. Suddenly, she felt tempted by the dessert.Maybe she could have a small bite? The thick, cheese-filled cake seemingly kept calling out to her. She courageously stretched out her hand.\u201cLeah,\u201d a fierce voice resonated as if intending to whip her.Frightened, Leah retracted her hand. It was certain. She\u2019d lost her mind. Eating a cake in front of Cerdina, of all people?\u201cI just wanted to taste it. Just a small bite. I-I was just wondering what it tasted like,\u201d awkward excuses poured out from her mouth.Cerdina stared at Leah and then softly smiled as she asked her, \u201cI hope you\u2019re not neglecting your diet, especially when you have your wedding coming up soon.\u201d\u201cYes, I will be careful. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dLeah put down the fork. The still half-full plate haunted her eyes. She\u2019d already finished the amount she usually ate, but she felt especially hungry that day.She tried to resist the appetizing smell of food and soothed her empty stomach with wine instead.***The man, nimbly straddled on the thick branches of a nearby tree, looked at the beautiful royal palace.Immersed in the darkness, the palace of Estia was dimly illuminated by the moonlight. The elegant scenery was like a work of art; however, there was no spark of interest in the man\u2019s golden eyes, evident from the way he narrowed slightly.She\u2019s trapped like a doll in a picturesque palace.She\u2019d grown so thin since the last time he saw her. His eyes turned cold.\u201cIshakan!\u201d A slender young man climbed up the tree and called out to him. The young man perched himself on the lower branch like an agile cat, \u201cEverything\u2019s ready. As you requested, I sent a letter, got a reply, and finished the rest. \u201cThen he tilted his head and asked. \u201cWhat do you intend to do next?\u201dIshakan thought of an answer to Suha\u2019s question. His one-night stand with her wasn\u2019t a part of his original plan.There were many reasons as to why he came to Estia, but the most important one was his interest in Leah. He wanted to check whether she still remembered him. He thought that if he met her and spoke to her once, he would be able to let go of the past memories. Perhaps, if she wanted, he would\u2019ve granted her requests as well.But when he heard that she was looking for a one-night stand, that plan fell apart like dry sand.It wasn\u2019t uncommon for those of noble blood to be proud of fulfilling their sexual desires through shady means. But the fact that he pretended to be a gigolo to approach her was beyond ridiculous.He wanted to offer a proper one-night stand to this princess who pretended to be chaste on the outside, but behaved impudently. Not used to experience, she was obviously afraid. After all, it was her first time. As Ishakan reminisced about the night of their affair, he recalled her small whisper.I wanted to die.It wasn\u2019t a lie. She had made up her mind. He could see it in her black, seemingly dead eyes.Ishakan\u2019s lips twisted into a frown, \u201cShe does not remember me.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuha rolled his eyes and opened his mouth. \u201cIt was a thing in the past.

But first\u2026\u201d Ishakan spoke, making a stabbing gesture in the air, as if wanting to kill the night.In a much more serious and sinister tone, he asked, \u201cShall we go meet the princess?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The beast wouldn\u2019t break the shackles, not because it loved or feared its master, but because it was so used to captivityEven if someone taught the beast how to break free, it still wouldn\u2019t try. Some would call the beast foolish for not doing it, but maybe the thought of shackles were deeply ingrained in its mind that it wouldn\u2019t even think that breaking free was possible.Leah was the same. But, she feared the queen instead.And every moment, shehadfeared for her life.The queen was Leah\u2019s biggest nightmare.All tragedies start with a blazing love. The king fell in love at first sight with a country girl while attending a banquet. Her frank tone and bright smile were something mesmerized the king, who had never seen something like that before. Thus, the girl who grew up in a small family in the province became the queen of Estia.However, merely being good didn\u2019t let her survive in the palace. With no one backing her up, she slowly became thinner day by day. All she could do was cling on to the king\u2019s love.At the pinnacle of her misery, Leah was born. She experienced labor complications and barely managed to give birth. Afterwards, she was rendered infertile.A barren queen was a disgrace to the royal family, and the once blazing love fell cold\u2026 The powerless, weak king easily complied with the demands of the greedy nobles who wanted to depose the queen. Soon after, she was driven out of the palace in a miserable shape.It happened when Leah was just three years old. She couldn\u2019t even clearly comprehend things at that age, but her mother\u2019s last words were vivid in her memory.I\u2019m sorry Leah, I\u2019m very sorry.You should continue to live\u2026Do not disobey Cerdina.Just follow her words, no matter what.And with those last words, the queen was discovered dead. The royal family announced that the dejected queen had decided to end her life, but everyone knew it wasn\u2019t suicide.The ambitious Countess Cerdina replaced the throne her mother once occupied. However, Cerdina\u2019s entry into the royal palace was tumultuous. She was carrying a baby boy.The boy was Leah\u2019s half brother. Queen Cerdina was in a relationship with the king even before the previous queen had been expelled.This caused the society of Estia to descend into chaos. The fact that the new queen wasn\u2019t a virgin and had an affair with the king caused turmoil.Such a disgrace\u2026However, with her powerful family and the king\u2019s favour, she was able to get her son declared as the heir to the throne, causing the clamor against her to fade away.The highly ambitious, cunning Cerdina always claimed,\u201cI know nothing about the complicated politics and the government. Wouldn\u2019t it be enough for me to carry out all my domestic duties?\u201dHowever, she was as vicious as a viper and was able to dominate the nobles and turn them into her puppets.Cerdina knew very well how to handle the daughter of the deposed queen. She carefully planned her moves, making sure not to do anything that would make it seem like she discriminating against Leah outright. Instead, she controlled the princess\u2019 every move, molding her nature and habits to her liking. Slowly, she tightened her hold over Leah\u2019s life.\u201cYou are the flower of Estia.\u201dThe queen\u2019s words were seared into her mind at a young age. It was the reason for Leah\u2019s obsession. She had to become the perfect princess of Estia\u2014her education, work, and beauty needed to be flawless.She was no different from Estia\u2019s art pieces. A cattle raised by the queen, and once fat, sold to the market. This was her purpose all along.Only the people closest to her knew the truth about how Cerdina secretly abused her. The others were ignorant and spoke highly of the queen and her kind-hearted and benevolent motherly nature.Leah wanted to scream at such people and ask them, \u2018What is the use of raising me to be perfect\u2026? In the end, didn\u2019t she just sell me off to that old Byung Gyeongbaek?\u2019\u2654\u2654\u2654Leah stood in front of the mirror, and a beautifully dressed doll-like woman stared back at her.Her pale face was covered with layers of bright make-up. Her thin, lifeless hair was curled up into an up-do. Her purple eyes seemed even more vivid in contrast to the dark eyeliner on her lids. On her neck was the diamond necklace that Byun Gyeonbaek had gifted her, completing the whole look.\u201cPrincess, I\u2019ll finish making the final adjustments to your attire.\u201dLeah gave her a small nod in reply. The reason for Leah\u2019s extraordinarily beautiful appearance was the conference with the Kurkans.The rest of the palace was busy preparing for the banquet. As expected, all the nobles had expressed their desire to attend the banquet. In fact, even nobles for all the other countries were visiting Estia for this special occasion.Everyone was looking forward to seeing the new king of Kurkans and Byun Gyeonbaek meet each other.The coward Byun immediately went on the defense when he heard the king was visiting, despite the news that their visit sought peace.People were well aware of the fact that Byun wouldn\u2019t be able to maintain his current level of power if Kurkan and Estia entered into a peace treaty. So, they speculated that Queen Cerdina was making moves in order to take Byun down for the sake of the crown prince.However, despite the intense political battle brewing underneath, above the surface, a warm and friendly atmosphere arose. Everyone was excited to see the Kurkans, who were known for their breath-taking, outstanding appearances. Leah\u2019s maids talked about that daily.Finally, the day the Kurkans would visit arrived. The welcome banquet would be held the day after. Right now, they were going to formally greet their visitors. Thus, Cerdina specifically instructed Leah to dress up extravagantly in order to show off the royal family\u2019s pride.And so, Leah ended up in this painful, uncomfortable dress.As the maids dressed Leah, Baroness Sinael suddenly burst into laughter while chatting with them. Leah smiled faintly and asked, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe maid replied with flushed cheeks, \u201cThey say that the king of the Kurkans is an extremely handsome man.\u201dCountess Melissa, the head of the maids, gave them a menacing glare as she cleared her throat. Immediately, the rest of them stopped chattering, but Leah put them at ease with a light grin.It was never good to be overwhelmingly strict. Instead, she lightened the atmosphere since everyone was so excited. But right at that moment, Leah suddenly felt a great amount of pressure from her guts.At the distance, underneath the warm rays of the sun, ships were nearing the shore of Estia.They have arrived.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From the distance, she could tell that they came with gifts.As Leah watched the glistening white diamonds, which loosely hang on the wooden ships, her vision became hazy. She suddenly remembered the scarce amount of food she had eaten that day\u2014only a handful of wild berries and a cup of tea.To her utter annoyance, she had been commanded to control her diet more than usual to achieve an even thinner waist. Her maids felt sorry for feeding her such meager meals, but they had to obey orders from above.Queen Cerdina herself supervised the princess\u2019 meals. Should she find out that Leah consumed even a mere crumb more than what she\u2019d set for her, both her and kitchen maids would suffer such horrendous consequences.To Cerdina, Leah was a mere tool, not a human. In order to please the numerous nobles and the visiting Kurkans, Leah was required to be outstandingly beautiful, especially today.The discomfort was almost unbearable, Leah grimaced as she supported her weight by holding on to the banister. She felt dizzy from the pain her tight corset squeezing her empty stomach caused. The fabric digging to her skin, she knew it would leave marks by the time the banquet ends.Her eyebrows furrowed as her vision swayed. Afraid of messing up her perfectly rouged face, she forced herself to straighten her expression.On the corner, Countess Melissa watched the princess with pitiful eyes.The suffering this child had gone through\u2026Among the palace\u2019s subordinates, she had been with Leah the longest. Seeing Leah\u2019s thin frame shake, she immediately realized what was happening. Approaching her hastily, Countess Melissa quickly supported the princess\u2019 collapsing weight.Leah could barely manage to stand. However, unaware of their mistress\u2019 struggle, the other maids continued to admire Leah\u2019s beauty.\u201cPrincess!\u201d One maid squealed, \u201cLook at how beautiful you are.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who can pull off this dress so magnificently.\u201d\u201cWhat if the Kurkans fall in love with you?\u201dBaroness Sinael was the one who spoke last, and upon hearing her comment, Countess Melissa lightly reprimanded her, giving her her most venomous glare.After a few adjustments here and there, the princess was finally ready at last. Sporting a straight face, she headed off to the royal palace with several maids in tow.\u2654\u2654\u2654The main hall was the most splendid part of Estia\u2019s royal palace. The ceiling was painted with frescoes pertaining to Estia\u2019s rich history, the marble columns were inscribed with different kinds of detailed carvings, and the throne was made of gold, ivory and precious gems.Several esteemed guests had gathered there, but as soon as she entered, Leah became the center of their attention. She walked faster, making her way to a discreet corner, trying not to bump into any other royal who\u2019d arrived before her.Blain smiled crookedly as he spotted Leah walking around the room. He\u2019d been so busy preparing the countermeasure plans for the Kurkans that they hadn\u2019t been able to see her after returning from hunting. He made a mental note totalkto her after the meeting was over.Feeling his eyes on her, Leah averted her eyes and, instead, went up to her father and greeted him. Then, she greeted Cerdina, and after acknowledging Blain\u2019s presence with a nod, took the seat designated for her.Shortly after, the powerful sound of the trumpet rang out; the bustling hall went silent.Everyone held their breath\u2014their eyes glued at the magnificent doors of the hall. No one dared to blink, for this was a history unraveling before their very eyes.The gigantic doors opened, letting sunlight pour into the hall. Slowly, the Kurkans\u2019 figures became clear\u2014their tanned skin and vivid eyes mesmerizing everyone in the hall.People exclaimed with wonder at the Kurkans\u2019 beauty. Unlike Estia\u2019s formal clothes that were tailored to fit perfectly around the body, the Kurkan clothes were sewn with generous amounts of natural fabric that hung loosely around their bodies.But despite the beautiful appearance of every Kurkan, everyone could distinguish who their leader was just by his appearance.The man\u2019s tanned skin glowed under the sunlight, his body well-endowed the muscles as strong and huge as a beast\u2019s. He sauntered in, leisurely placing one foot in front of the other, walking without a care in the world.His golden eyes carefully scanned the hall, stopping right at the princess, who stared at him with a dumbstruck expression.This can\u2019t be happening\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLeah\u2019s breath hitched, and her heart raced\u2026 What\u2019s more, she could see the hint of a smile lingering on his lips as his deep, sharp gaze scoured all over her body.The man stepped forward, keeping his eyes locked on Leah. He stopped in front of the royal family, and a familiar low voice echoed throughout the hall.\u201cMay the light bless Estia,\u201d the king said with a meaningful smile, \u201cI am the king of Kurkans, Ishakan.\u201dLeah clenched the skirt of her gaudy dress, wanting to rip it off.It was him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She unconsciously dug her nails into her palm; her knuckles turning white as if it would pop out anytime. Leah could not muster the strength to face Ishakan anymore.The man to whom I frittered my chastity away was the King of the Kurkans?Even the cheap comedy shows open at the public market couldn\u2019t be funnier than this. She almost fainted at the hilarious twist of fate.No, this was from being a mere funny twist of fate. It was highly likely that the King of Kurkan had intentionally approached her.She felt a shrill pain tearing her chest. She was caught red-handed\u2014the King of Kurkans knew her Achilles\u2019 heels.She used the man, Ishakan, as a tool for her plans. But ironically,he knew the entire plan.He knew how she lost her virginity, even her innermost desire to die.Dread filled her. He might even blackmail her with her biggest secret.Leah tried to regain composure by calmly holding her breath amidst all the thoughts that bombarded her. She was in a public place\u2014too many eyes were watching her. Hence, she cannot show any hint of agitation.She braced her emotions and stared forward with a blank look in her eyes, like a doll. But because of his golden eyes kept on piercing her, this became a hard job to accomplish.His eyes were latched on Leah alone. He had been staring at her since he first entered the hall, and had only pulled his gaze when greeting the King.Unfortunately, people couldn\u2019t ignore the ravishing King and his striking eyes, which blatantly dwelled on a certain person among the crowd.\u201c\u2026.\u201dMurmurs slowly spread throughout the hall. The aristocrats exchanged glances with each other in a peculiar way.A beautiful princess known as the flower of Estia and a young, strong King of the savage tribe.It was indeed a fascinating and excellent plot for a made-up tale. And adding the fact that Leah was Byung Gyongbaek\u2019s fianc\u00e9 made it more thrilling to the ears of the engrossed onlookers.For this matter, some intensely looked at the high and mighty Byun Gyeongbaek. How would he react when a handsome monarch was eyeing his fianc\u00e9 like a candy?Leah also couldn\u2019t help but threw a fleeting gaze at him.Surely, the tyrant sat at the topmost platform, among the senior nobles who gathered in the royal palace. Hence, with his position, he could watch Leah and Ishakan up close.His face turned red. The simmering anger inside welling up\u2014he as breathed laboriously. His breathing was so heavy and loud; it could be heard as far as Leah was sitting.Unable to contain his ire, Byun Gyeongbaek was about to rush out like an angry bull, when a deep dry cough pulled him back to his senses.\u201c\u2026 Ahem.\u201dIt was a cough from the King of Estia, whose presence had been ignored until now. Naturally, everyone\u2019s attention was diverted to their king, and finally, Leah was set free from the suffocating eyes of the people. She gulped down a sigh of relief.The king drew a displeased look, and Ishakan, in response, slyly pulled off a smile. He coolly shrugged off his lack of courtesy.As his slender lips upturned, a pleasant atmosphere lingered, slightly concealing his dangerous savageness. The noble class, who scorned his kind, had never seen such an aura emanating from a barbarian.His beaming face naturally attracted the eyes of the people. The King of Estia coughed again to regain attention as he addressed a reply to Ishakan.\u201cWelcome to the Kingdom of Estia.\u201dSurprisingly, Ishakan politely replied to him, \u201cThank you for the warm welcome.\u201dAstounded by such polite greeting, the king\u2019s face slightly softened. Leah spits out a curse inside, as her father blindly believed Ishakan\u2019s feigned courtesy.Putting aside the fact that he set up a false pretense to deceive her\u2026 and now\u2026Is he faking an interest in her, too?His arrival, indeed, meant nothing but trouble. For sure, Leah thought, he intended to mess around with everything.Could she still stop him?However, he had already caught her weakness. Besides, there\u2019s not much time left before she would be taken to Oberde. It would all be spent in turning over her work in the palace.As Leah impatiently watched over the conversation between Ishakan and her father, she reckoned what could still be done in a very tight situation like this.Their conversation on probing one another has been extremely polite. Ishakan had shown respect to the old king by bowing before him, but not stooping so low which shows inferiority. No, he acted perfectly\u2014not too much, at the same time, not in any way lacking decency.From the first time she laid her eyes on the king, she knew that he would definitely be a tough opponent.After wrapping up the conversation with the King, Ishakan subsequently exchanged a brief greeting with Cerdina and Blaine. And lastly, he sat in front of Leah\u2026This instantly attracted the attention of the aristocrats who had been invigorated by the Ishakan\u2019s sheer display of interest to the princess.

Secretly, she balled her free hand buried in the folds of her skirt into a tight fist.The teeth scraping her skin seemed to remind her of the night they shared. Having enough of it, she retracted her hand, but Ishakan immediately grasped it tighter and eventually removed his lips.Many eyes watched them, yet this didn\u2019t stop him from doing such a valiant greeting! The expression \u201cbold\u201d was not even enough to describe his act.What\u2019s more, his serene and confident face remained, and his smile had not once faltered. It was only the princess who looked flustered\u2014the red tingle on her cheeks being a clear indication.Soon, Ishakan released her hand from his grasp and, as if scalded, Leah cradled it with her other hand. The sun in broad daylight was bright, and the chandeliers in the hall looked dazzling, even glinting so vibrantly.But Leah\u2019s heart was shrouded in darkness. Suffocated, it felt like she was drowning in quicksand.\u2654\u2654\u2654Finally, the welcome banquet came to an end. Leah immediately stood up from her seat and as if a demon was hot on her trail, departed the hall. In haste, she wasn\u2019t able to bid her proper farewell to the nobles, but she didn\u2019t care.Donning a petulant air, she walked without pause, just wanting to go back to her chamber right away, lock all the doors, hide herself underneath her blankets. A strong instinctive desire to flee to a safe place was the only comprehensible thing in her mind at this moment.Her maids quickly tailed after her. Confused faces behind her, yet Leah kept her silence.After confining herself straight in her bedroom, she stayed up all night. She wanted to sleep, but somehow, she couldn\u2019t. Thoughts of the man stirred chaos in her head.The night they spent together, the stories they shared, and the passionate heat\u2014all of these haunted her.Tossing, turning, and rolling in her bed all night long, she barely slept a wink that night.Upon popping her eyes open the next day, she woke up a disaster. Dark circles were visible though the thick of her skin, thus, which she concealed by putting on powder.Then, she headed off to her work.And boy, she had heaps of work to do.While the peace treaty agreement was being established, the Kurkans decided to stay in the Royal Palace of Estia. After the banquet, the two sides would hopefully arrive to a full-scale agreement.By now, the King of Kurkan had already realized that Estia\u2019s old king was no match for him.There was no doubt in this,Leah thought dismissively.The treaty was the last thing on her mind right now\u2014the upcoming welcome banquet for the Kurkans holding the utmost urgency. Just the thought of running into all sorts of people, including Byun Gyongbaek at the conference, made her head spin.Prospects of the planned treaty would be kept at bay during the banquet as the Kurkans would have to mingle with Byun Gyongbaek\u2014an atrocious person who bears malice against their kind. Hence, talks of the treaty might raise a dispute.The quill set aside, Leah signed the last document on her table. She scowled as a sharp headache hit her hard, making it hard to focus on her work.She stood up to clear her head. Otherwise, she would commit mistakes, which would guarantee irreversible misfortunes.\u201cI\u2019ll head out to breathe some fresh air,\u201d she called out.Countess Melissa, who had been assisting her, drew a worried look. It had been a while since Leah had used those words. This news was taking its toll on the princess.Leah went out for a walk with her maids, only after assuring Melissa that she felt nothing but fine.She walked along the corridor beside the courtyard and breathed in the dewy scent of grasses, which soon soothed her nerves.Leah took a long look at the garden.Amidst the ornamental plants, there was a field of tuberose. This plant\u2019s white flower buds that formed in clusters looked adorable. A little more time and they would be in full bloom.But first, these flowers needed extra pampering. Leah was about to tell the gardener to tend to the tuberose when her gaze caught a familiar figure in the distance.Upon realizing who it was, she instantly froze. The air snatched from her lungs.He was there.Under the specks of sunlight peeping through the voids of the leaves, Ishakan was leaning against a tree, idly smoking.It was known that Kurkans like to smoke tobacco, but their cigarettes were different from those of the continent. The hazy fog that disperses from the smoke was quite unique. The cool yet subtly sweet scent, filling her nostrils, suited him.Immediately, her maids started whispering from behind.\u201cIs he the King of the Kurkans?\u201d\u201cOh my god. Is he real? His looks!\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t he too fierce? I\u2019m scared of him.\u201dCountess Melissa approached Leah and said, \u201cPrincess, what should we do?\u201dThey have to leave this place right at this moment. Because her relationship with the man is not formally known. But even if she already knows that, she paused, and looked at Ishakan.He was looking down on his feet when he heard the maids giggling from afar. Hence, he slowly lifted his weary eyes\u2014revealing his hawk-like, golden orbs.Instantly, their eyes met\u2014but was cut short when Ishakan veered his gaze from her.He took a small pack of cigarette out of his chest and discarded up the leaf tobacco he smoked. While he busied himself, Leah strode deeper into the shady part of the corridor where she formerly stood. All the while, keenly watching the man\u2019s moves.A few steps taken, and he was out of her sight. Leah turned her back, intent on leaving him to his peace.\u201cStop right there.\u201dShe was leading the maids out of the corridor when suddenly, large hands grabbed her arms.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026Ahh!\u201dLeah shrieked and stumbled as he pulled her arm, making her hit his solid chest. She hastily looked up, and their eyes locked in an instant.\u201cWhere are you headed to, Princess?\u201d he said in a low, malicious tone.In this position, the warmth from his body surrounded her. His soft whisper intensely stirred her up.\u201cI\u2019m sure you have something to say.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Countess Melissa grabbed her skirt in anger and shouted at him.\u201cThat is too rude!\u201dBut as soon Melissa looked into Ishakan\u2019s eyes, she froze. Her face went pale, and breath hitched. Her body trembled with absolute fear. Leah immediately stood in front of Countess Melissa, protecting her from his line of sight.\u201cHe\u2019s the king.\u201dIshakan turned to Leah. Countess Melissa breathed a sigh of relief as the attention was off of her. Leah then looked straight into his eyes.\u201cTouching the body of a royalty without permission is a breach of respect in Estia. As long as you\u2019re here, I\u2019d like you to follow Estia\u2019s etiquette.\u201dThe maids were merely fulfilling their duties. Ishakan should have to do the same. But surprisingly, he admitted his mistake.\u201cI made a mistake.\u201dThe maids, as well as Leah, shrunk back in surprise. They couldn\u2019t believe that an apology came out so easily from the mouth of a king. No royalty ever acted this way; admitting one\u2019s mistake meant giving up their pride.But Ishakan admitted his fault as if it was nothing and gently looked at Leah. She fought the urge to look away and met his steady gaze.\u201cHunting is like second nature to Kurkan\u2019s\u2026\u201d He started to explain.His lips pulled up into a smile, \u201cSo if you turn your back to me, my natural instinct would be to chase and catch you.\u201dIn contrast to his relaxed smile, his words carried a frightening meaning, causing the atmosphere to become tense. The way he talked and behaved, it was as if Leah was prey for him. But she didn\u2019t budge. She considered being silent to be a much better option than having a nonsensical argument with him.Ishakan stared at her, and slowly, his mouth lifted up into a smile.\u201cWill you show me around the palace?\u201dHis words were like poison. Byun Gyonbaek\u2019s fianc\u00e9 hanging out with the King of Kurkans? It would be the gossip of the century.She was sure that if she accepted, a rumor claiming that the King of Kurkans was hitting on the princess of Estia would spread like wildfire.Despite being aware of this, she couldn\u2019t reject his request. Compared to the powerful weapon Ishakan could use against Leah, the rumor was nothing.Ishakan held out his hand, asking her to escort him. Reluctantly, she laid her hand on top of his in acceptance.\u201cPrincess\u2026\u201dFrightened, the maids called out to Leah. Countess Melissa trembled as she recalled the fear she felt while confronting Ishakan.\u201cI\u2019m fine. You may go ahead.\u201d\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\u201cI have to entertain the guest.\u201dAfter comforting the terrified maids, Leah leads the way as she showed him around. Ishakan followed her at a leisurely pace. She tried to head to a secluded place, but it was impossible to avoid the people\u2019s curious eyes completely. With every step they took, the more gazes followed them.To Leah, their eyes felt like bees stinging her continuously.She walked faster. Only after reaching a quiet garden did her breathing return to normal.Around them, shrubs and bushes stood, concealing their figures from passers-by. In the middle of the garden, there was a fountain installed over a square slab of stone, from which water serenely poured out.The fountain was in the form of a sculpture, carved by a famous artist. This masterpiece was honed according to the beautiful, naked form of a male deity. All over the palace of Estia, such works of art laid unattended in gardens.Ishakan stopped as Leah stopped in front of the fountain. After confirming that there were finally alone, did she turned around and faced him.Unlike the delicate, finely adorned palace of Estia, Ishakan was strong and wild. He stood out against the splendid palace like a drop of blood against stark white skin.\u201cDid you know this from the beginning?\u201dIshakan raised his brows, so Leah repeated her question, her face devoid of any expression.\u201cI\u2019m asking you if you approached me knowing I\u2019m the princess of Estia.\u201dAsking that question took a lot of courage. Instead of explaining himself, Ishakan merely said,\u201cWhat if I say yes?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNow that they were alone, Ishakan immediately revealed his true colors, dropping any pretense of etiquette. His attitude was crude and straightforward.Leah couldn\u2019t reply. Ishakan laughed and stepped closer to her. \u201cWhat if I knew and approached you? What will you do?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m wondering whether you will take advantage of my weakness and use it against me.\u201d His eyes twinkled as he listened to her words with great delight, finding everything that she says fascinating.\u201cIshakan.\u201d He suddenly interjected.She didn\u2019t understand what he meant. In a friendly tone, he continued.\u201cDon\u2019t refer to me as the king of Kurkans. Call me Ishakan.\u201dIs this a command or a request?Either way, she didn\u2019t have a choice, so she tried calling him by his name.\u201cIshakan\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt felt odd calling him as casually as this. As his name rolled from her tongue, her heart raced. To conceal her agitation, she toughened up her tone.\u201cI want you to clarify your actions.

Leah, on the other hand, was fixated on his pointy canines, which was revealed as his mouth opened wide.\u201cIf I ask you to treat me as a prostitute, will you pay me for my services?\u201dIndeed, he loved to play with her words.

She wasn\u2019t used to this kind of conversation, causing her to pat her flushed cheeks with the back of her hands in order to cool it down. Ishakan proceeded to sit down on the fountain\u2019s edge.\u201cIn public, I\u2019ll treat you like a princess. But when we\u2019re alone, can we just act comfortably?\u201d\u201cComfortably?\u201d\u201cThe cheeky attitude suits you better than acting like a prim and proper royal princess,\u201d He raised one elegant eyebrow, \u201cJust like that night.\u201dThe words he added carried a significant meaning, but she chose to ignore it.\u201cIf you choose to treat me as a princess, make sure to stay in your limits. Like how you laid your hands on me earlier today\u2014\u201dBefore she could finish speaking, Ishakan suddenly grabbed her wrist. Slyly, he replied as he looked into Leah\u2019s eyes.\u201cBut we\u2019re alone now\u2014so I don\u2019t have to treat you as a princess.\u201dAre all beasts like this?Tired of his insolent actions, Leah glared at him, not uttering a single word. But Ishakan\u2019s attention was on something else. He mumbled with a frown on his face.\u201cDarn it\u2026 You\u2019re thinner than before. Are you eating properly?\u201dHer skinny wrist was remarkably different from his large hand. As a part of the preparations for the welcome banquet for the Kurkans, she had been put on even stricter diet\u2014making her thinner than before.Instead of explaining, Leah took her hand out of his grasp. Upon noticing his now empty hands, Ishakan quickly dipped his hands in the fountain.How odd\u2026Suddenly, he started washing his hands. Did he find her hands dirty then?She couldn\u2019t believe it. He was so hard to decipher. Why would he do something like that in the middle of their conversation? Leah bit her lip and reluctantly brought the issue plaguing her mind.\u201cThe things that happened that night\u2026 Can you keep it to yourself?\u201dThe thought of others knowing her plan scared her. She couldn\u2019t imagine how bad things would get if Ishakan told her secret to others.Ishakan\u2019s eyes narrowed as he noticed Leah\u2019s desperation. He tilted his head sideways and laughed.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dHearing his ambiguous reply, Leah felt her stomach drop. She couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and cried out.\u201cWhat do you want from me?! What\u2014\u201d She exclaimed, but was cut short upon his next course of action.He\u2019d shoved something inside her mouth, making the whites of her eyes widen. She didn\u2019t know what it was, but she still chewed on it. As she munched on the tender, sticky pulp, a sweet taste pervaded her mouth. Her body felt ecstatic as the sweet taste satisfied the deprivation she\u2019d felt from not eating.\u201cYou need to spit out the seeds.\u201dHis long, slender fingers pried her mouth open, and Ishakan took the seed lying on top of her tongue while he grinned at her.\u201cThat was a dried date palm. Did you like it?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dHer face flushed red as she finally realized what he\u2019d just done. She was engrossed by the sweet taste of the fruit that she couldn\u2019t grasp his actions.She couldn\u2019t say anything. Confused, she stared at Ishakan, her cheeks still red. He casually pushed another date between her lips, which her mouth accepted willingly.\u201cI only want one thing.\u201dAs she tasted the strong, sweet flavor on her tongue once again, Ishakan whispered with a dreary look.\u201cI want you to accept whatever I give you.\u201d\u2654The underlying meaning of his whisper was implicit. Her heart leaped fast. As if possessed by something, Leah delightfully savored the date in her mouth.Dried date palms were not a staple food in Estia. She had eaten it only once when a Kurkan slave gave it to her when she was still but a child.That was such a long time ago. So long that Leah could no longer remember the taste of the dried date palm\u2014nor the face of the boy who so kindly shared his food to her.Savoring it, she felt elated with its unfamiliar sweetness. Sucking every date dry of its saccharine pulp, soon Leah unintentionally sucked her own lips. Hence, emitting slurping sounds to the air.A tinge of regret lingered on the tip of her tongue.In contrast to her, Ishakan didn\u2019t find it embarrassing. Rather, he was deeply invested in getting her to consume some nourishment for her frail body.The probing eyes of the king watched Leah as she feasted on the dates he brought with him. Before he stuffs the fruit into her mouth, she turns her head down and spits the seeds on her palms.Now that she had finished eating all, she appeared clueless of what she must do with it.For a moment, he hesitated and reached out his hands. Ishakan grasped the seeds coated with her saliva and instantly hurled it to the bushes.Leah did not conceive such a stunt right away, hence, Ishakan was fast to supply a quick explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s a seed, so it shall be returned to the soil.\u201dShe found no fault in his words, and nodded in acquiesce. For sure, the gardener wouldn\u2019t mind some small seeds littered here in his work area. He probably won\u2019t take notice of it.Leah wiped her lips and, without a word, drew close to the fountain and washed her hands. While washing off the sticky residue left on her hands, she sneakily took a glimpse of Ishakan.She found everything about him peculiar.Maybe because he was from a foreign land?Everything that he did perplexed her. Most of all, he utterly ruined her systematic routine for today.Alas! She realized it too late. Cerdina would be inspecting all the preparations for the upcoming conference. And by preparation, it included herself! My, did she finish all dates knowing that she would have to wear a waist-tight dress tomorrow in front of Cerdina.Worry was etched on her face as she feared her belly would bulge out.Despite the train of regrets, she could not resist eating the sweet dates, which melted in her mouth.When was the last time I had eaten well?She could not even remember it\u2014oh, but she did!Quickly, the aftermath of their heated night occupied her train of thoughts, the time Ishakan fed her a generous amount of bread and stew. She scowled upon remembering so.Moving behind her, Ishakan brought her back to her senses when he grasped her hand, to which Leah jolted in surprise. She was even more bewildered when Ishakan put something on her palm. He then gently closed her hand with his, making her clench it.As she looked down, she saw a box of dates. Leah blinked her eyes as she peered on an evenly arranged dates, enclosed in an elegant box.Looking at Ishakan\u2019s appearance, he looked as if he devours meat with blood dripping on it. But seeing him carry this box of dates was a bit surprising, looked out of character even.\u201cKurkans believe that sweet food can expel bad spirits. I also like sweets. Take my gift along with you.\u201dAs soon as she heard this, she rigidly closed the lid of the box\u2014the delicious dates disappearing under it.She shoved the box to him. It was a firm refusal. Instead of accepting the box, Ishakan retorted.\u201cI didn\u2019t put poison on it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I cannot accept this, so take it with you.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I am on a diet.\u201d She blurted out.Ishakan\u2019s eyes sparked with interest, the thought of her starving herself intentionally riled him up. \u201cDiet for what?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe reason does not involve you at the very least.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want his pity at all. Instead of letting their conversation take an undesired path, Leah veered the topic. \u201cWhy did you come here in Estia?\u201d Gazing at him directly in his eyes, she asked intrepid, \u201cAre you certain that you don\u2019t need anything from me?\u201d\u201cOf course, I do.\u201d He jerked his head to the direction of the box.\u201cEat all of those. It\u2019s an order from someone who knows yourweakness.\u201d He touched the corner of the box. The oiled wood was smooth without any scratch. \u201cShould I feed you more?\u201dHer face stiffened as he chuckled. She absolutely could not be swayed anymore. With his threatening words, she was compelled to accept the box of sweets, and uttered in a cold voice.\u201cI ask you to forget what happened that night. If you really regard me as the princess of this kingdom, please do not behave indecently.\u201d\u201cBehave indecently?\u201d\u201cI am pertaining to touching without permission.\u201d\u201cBe specific. I am an uneducated beast, so I am completely clueless to what you are insinuating.\u201d\u201cLike suddenly grabbing my arm\u2026 or putting your fingers inside my mouth.\u201dA sly smile rose as the corners of Ishakan\u2019s eyes crinkled. Unable to stop himself, he cracked up with a boisterous laugh. Just as water drops from the mouth of the fountain splattered and disturbed the calm stock water beneath, illuminated by the radiant sun, his laughter too caused mayhem in her.\u201cYou like me putting it in, right?\u201dLeah squeezed her eyes shut\u2014understanding right away his coarse statement. He was far different from the people she had met before. However, she could not deny that she had always been drawn to people with an unfamiliar background.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe sharply raised her eyes, wanting to snap at him and reprimand him of his lustful temperament.

However, his beauty was only a mask, fro what lay inside was hideous than, more than one could ever imagine.Cold and quick-tempered, the crown prince of Estia was feared by the many. Truth of this matter, Leah felt horrified whenever he looked at her. Just like this moment, for instance.His piercing eyes ran all over her. After scrutinizing the box that Leah is currently carrying, he slowly looked at Ishakan. While observing the situation, Ishakan pleasantly greeted Blain without any hint of embarrassment.\u201cGood morning, Your Highness!\u201dAt the outset, he pretended to be acquainted with Blain. Only then did Blain acknowledge him. The courtesy greeting was dull and wry. Shortly right after, the atmosphere went silent.A strange aura surrounded them. The sound of the water flowing from the fountain reverberated amidst the silence. After the muffling silence, Blain finally opened his mouth.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that the King of Kurkans will be here.\u201dIshakan struck back, \u201cIs this a place I am prohibited from entering?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what the custom of Kurkan is like.\u201d Blain gritted his teeth and said, \u201cBut here in Estia, it is not good to see an unmarried woman alone with a man.\u201dHe glanced back at Leah while spiteful words spilled from his mouth, which sounded like daggers aimed at her.\u201cSister.\u201dLeah bit her lips as he called her 'sister.\u201d Although Blain was her half-brother, he has never treated her respectfully. On the contrary, Leah was harshly educated to respect the crown prince, Blain politely.He used to call Leah by her name or call her sister whenever he felt like it. It seemed that he formally addressed her because the king of Kurkans was around. After all, there was no good in finding out that the royal family was a mess.\u201cI came to tell you something. Let\u2019s go to a silent place.\u201dHe said it in a tone of suppressed anger. She dealt with this situation before, and knew very well how Blain\u2019s anger would escalate If she resisted longer.Therefore, Leah answered submissively, \u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dWith that, Blain snatched her wrist right and roughly pulled her with him. Her foot stumbled across the jagged edges of the slab of stones, and her body tottered, but Blain did not care.While being dragged away, Leah looked back at Ishakan. She excruciatingly tolerated the pain and was able to gaze at him with a serene face.Their eyes met. Ishakan\u2019s eyes never left Leah\u2019s form. He was displeased and was ready to strangle the man to death. However, Blain was Estia\u2019s next ruler, and disputing with him would rather make things complicated. What\u2019s more, making such commotion would likely affect the princess.But still, he couldn\u2019t help but mouth,Need help?His golden eyes hoped a reply. In his disappointment, however, Leah lowered her eyes indicating her refusal.This is for the better, she thought.She did not want to be dragged by Blain. Deep inside, she was desperate for his help. But it has been a long time since she realized that following her heart is na\u00efve.That man is the king of Kurkans who came to devour Estia. He must have premeditated all of his political plans. Even though his intention is not clear as of the moment, it is best not to get involved with him.Leah dismissed her thoughts, and unbelievingly shook her head. She felt Ishakan\u2019s persistent gaze, but she ignored it and blindly permitted Blain to drag her away.As soon as they arrived in the nook of the garden, far from Ishakan\u2019s sight, her body was roughly pushed against a tree. Her short dress was scraped and torn by the wooden bushes.Brutally, Blain pulled her hair\u2014wrecking her beautifully curled mane.

She huffed out angrily and straightened up her posture, fixing up her disheveled state of dress before shooting him a sharp glare.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, brother,\u201d she hissed, \u201cEven if Byun Gyongbaek scares me, I won\u2019t do that,\u201d she reassured.Blain\u2019s face had winced momentarily at the mention of Byun Gyongbaek, before schooling his features into a scowl as he stared down Leah with a manic grin.\u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d he said, \u201cVery good at denying, even hiding in the gardens with the King of Kurkans, no less,\u201d he whispered. His face drawing near until his mouth was a breath away from her ear.He let go of his grip on her hair, hands trailing down, caressing her cheek. His long, slender fingers patted her cheek gently, quirking his head at her with a mocking concern.\u201cDid he tell you he\u2019s in love with you?\u201d he asked, pouting at her, which made Leah clench her jaw, \u201cTell you to sleep with him?\u201d Leah forced her mouth to keep shut.She wanted to tell him that he did, but she thought otherwise.\u201cNothing happened between us,\u201d she told him, \u201cHe was only interested in me because I am Byun Gyongbaek\u2019s fianc\u00e9,\u201d she finished explaining. Blain only stared at her silently, observing her for any signs of dishonesty. He didn\u2019t trust a single word, but for now, he\u2019ll let it be.They were close before, him and Leah. Back when they were still young. They\u2019d take care of each other, as much as they would with a real sibling.And Blain had absolutely adored Leah, gave her what she wanted and more, granted her every wish. And Leah was the same, due to her lonesome nature, she found a company with Blain. Eventually, people often mistook them as siblings with exactly the same parents, and they never bothered to correct them.But like all families, with time, they eventually grew apart.As Leah grew, he watched her discover her many talents, growing further and further successful, needing him less and lesser. And it tore at Blain, made him feel inadequate of standing beside her. Slowly, his admiration turned into jealousy. His love turned into hate.He didn\u2019t like how she was flourishing. He wanted to crush her at all costs.And as their relationship crumbled before her very eyes, Leah learned a valuable lesson, which led to completely breaking off their once strong bond.Her mother\u2019s death was the key. When she realized the real reason, she couldn\u2019t keep up with the pretenses anymore, and finally left Blain. She couldn\u2019t reconcile what she knew of him now, to the person he used to be.And when Leah broke away, Blain\u2019s true colors began to shine.After staring into his angry cerulean orbs, and seeing he had nothing else to say, Leah shrugged off his grip on her chin, jerking her head suddenly and pushed past him to leave. Blain stepped back when she did and called out.\u201cLeah,\u201d he said, and she paused. His voice made unpleasant shivers run down her spine. His fingers once more found purchase in her hair, as he tucked in some strands behind her ear, the callouses caressing her skin softly.\u201cYou must learn to listen to me, sister.\u201d he told her before giving her a serious look, \u201cAnd don\u2019t wander off where I can\u2019t see,\u201d he warned, and Leah gave him a terse nod.All she wanted was for all of this to be over. She was so tired.\u2654When Leah finally returned to the Princess\u2019 chambers, the maids were already gathered, waiting for her, with Countess Melissa among their ranks, standing in front of the maids.As soon as the Countess had seen her, she immediately ran up to her with a cry.\u201cPrincess!\u201d she exclaimed as she neared and paused in front of her, fidgeting. \u201cThe Crown Prince had been searching for you.\u201d she informed her, and Leah nodded.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve seen him.\u201d Leah replied with a soft smile, and Countess Melissa stared at her agape, before closing her mouth, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d she reassured. But even with her assurance, the worry was still present in the Countess\u2019 eyes. And as much as Leah wanted to elaborate, she couldn\u2019t risk telling her more.She remembered the way Blain had pulled her aside, grabbing her by her hair, and she remembered she was still quite a mess. She hadn\u2019t been able to think up an excuse to explain her poor state of dress. Nodding at her, Countess Melissa soon pulled out a shawl, and draped it across her shoulders.Leah thanked her briefly before heading inside her chambers.Once inside, the maids served her tea, whilst she sat on a stool and took a sip. For now, the warmth of the liquid as it ran down her throat was enough to soothe her racing heart. She felt her muscles loose then the tension as she took a deep breath, savoring the sensation of the Countess brushing her hair.Halfway through her tea, the Countess broke the silence, albeit hesitant.\u201cPrincess, if I may,\u201d she began while continuing to brush her hair, \u201cWhat happened with the King of Kurkans?\u201dLeah paused at the question and set the cup of tea back down on the table. It was very easy to lie her way out of this. And so with expert ease, she put on a calm expression and a reassuring smile.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHe was only curious of me.\u201d she answered, \u201cIt seemed that he was highly curious on who is Byun Gyongbaek of Oberde\u2019s fianc\u00e9,\u201d She finished and took another sip of the tea, and Countess Melissa nodded in understanding.She didn\u2019t even doubt a single word.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d The countess sighed, her worries easing up, \u201cI\u2019ve been so worried, especially since it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve disappeared. He seems too rough and stern,\u201d she aired her concerns.And Leah was content to let her ramble on as usual. Normally, the countess would have told the nothings of her day, usually involving Blain. But since she met Ishakan earlier today, it was so memorable that she couldn\u2019t stop talking about it.\u201cOh, and his eyes\u2026\u201d the countess recalled, wistfully recalling Ishakan\u2019s face from memory. But as she paused, she immediately realized, with a frown, of how freely she had been speaking. She usually took great care not to talk so casually towards the princess. Meanwhile, Leah\u2019s hand stilled, the tea still unfinished, as she recalled the golden eyes of Ishakan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And when angry, it can invoke a deep fear, instinctive as that of a prey when faced with a roaring beast, when you make eye contact.Soon her thoughts returned to Blain, and she wondered if he would tell Cerdina what had occurred today. The very thought bothered her.I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll tell Cerdina, but what if he does?She frets,Will he just leave it be?She worried continuously. Cerdina was not like Blain. He wouldn\u2019t just let it go like Blain would.I must figure out a way to get out of this.She thought to herself before a sharp pain ran through her head.The pain was unbearable, and she quickly downed her drink and stood up with a wince.\u201cKindly cancel my schedule for today,\u201d she tells the Countess, \u201cI\u2019ll just be in my room, reading the reports,\u201d she said, and the Countess approached her with a worried look.\u201cPrincess-\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Leah interrupted, and gave her a soft smile, \u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d she reassured, \u201cTruly, it\u2019s only the strict diet I\u2019m on, I just need to rest.\u201dBut Melissa was doubtful of her words. She knew there\u2019s more to it than that\u2014Leah was really not well. But she also knew that Leah wouldn\u2019t let her help, and so reluctantly, she gave her a short nod before leaving her alone to allow her the rest she needs.When the Countess had left, Leah had also instructed the maids still in her room to leave her be, prohibiting them from further entering until tomorrow morning. Once she was alone, she got dressed in her nightgown, before promptly collapsing on the nearby chair.She didn\u2019t think she had enough strength to eat dinner tonight. Besides, she needs to tone down her eating in anticipation of the upcoming conference. Perhaps for dinner, she\u2019ll only request two slices of apple, as she wanted to rest as soon as she could. She really wanted to be alone for now.With a sigh, she turned to her window, staring at nothing in particular. She watched the skies turn red as the sun was setting, and perched on her chair, she watched as the daylight ended and darkness descended.Her knuckles clench on the edge of her armrest, watching as the moon lights up the night sky. Her fingers twitch, as the urge to open the window grows strong\u2026And along with it, the urge to jump.It\u2019s a fleeting sensation, one she\u2019s become accustomed to every now and then. But she never had the guts to go through with it, only passing fantasies whenever the thought crosses her mind. But now\u2026Just a little more,she thinks.Just a little more time.She counted down the days in her head; the peace treaty, and when the Kurkans are gone. After that, then it could end. All ofthiswill end. Once she brought the royal family of Estia to ruin and shame, then will she be able to rest truly.Her eyes fluttered shut, imagining the pain and agony she would see on their faces\u2026Imagining the way the wind would whip through her body when she finally takes a leap.A light tapping resounded in her silent chambers, and Leah\u2019s eyes snapped open, a frown marred her expression. Nothing.She thought it had been a mind trick, but then it happened again, and then again.Thrice, she thought. It sounded like it was coming from the window.And so she stood up, and drew closer to the window with cautious steps. Her hand closed in on the lock of it, her fingers flipping them open before she lightly pushed the windowpane open, and let out a gasp of surprise.She brought a hand up to her mouth to prevent her from alerting anyone else.\u201cHow?!\u201d she gasped at him in surprise, but it came out as a stutter. On the other hand, the person outside, who was perching on top of the tree\u2019s branch, only stared at her calmly, playing with a pebble in his hand, tossing it up in the air and catching it with the same hand, as if he was only doing a simple prank.But Leah was rather taken aback. This late at night, the security of the royal palace was second to none, and quite difficult to slip past through. Should they be found out, this would surely put them in trouble, and Blain wouldn\u2019t be as forgiving as he was in the garden earlier today.So lost in her grim thoughts, and at a loss at what to do, she hadn\u2019t realized Ishakan had already moved, jumping from the branch and into her room without permission.In contrast to his broad body, he moved light and swift on his feet, landing rather gracefully on her balcony. Her breath caught in her throat as she watched him leap off the branch.\u201cWhere do you think you are?!\u201d she hissed quietly, as he straightened up.\u201cIn your room,\u201d he stated matter of factly. He thought it odd how she had to ask, when she knew perfectly where he was.Ignoring her growing protest, he walked into her room, glancing around without shame. Leah rounded after him, but he only ignored her warnings and complaints.Once he was done touring her room, he finally turned his attention to Leah, to whom he gave a soft smile.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCute nightgown.\u201d he told her, \u201cIs that what you sleep in?\u201d he askedForgetting she was in a nightgown, Leah grabbed the nearest blanket and covered herself with it.\u201cWhat are you doing here!?\u201d she hissed in a whisper towards him. She was so surprised by his presence, she couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say. It was like her thought had scrambled in her mind, as she felt the blood rush to her face in embarrassment.\u201cI was curious of something, so here I am.\u201d he answered languidly, and she frowned and moved to let him leave. She also thought for a moment of requesting his presence and to officially apply as one of the attendants for tomorrow\u2019s banquet, but she was cut off when Ishakan continued and looked at her seriously\u2026\u201cWhy hadn\u2019t you asked for my help?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When Blain carelessly dragged her away from the garden, she could still remember Ishakan mouth the words \u201cNeed help?\u201dShe thought of his underlying intention, whether it was an evil scheme or a political move.However, in contrast to her complicated thoughts, the man in front of her was quite simple. His intention was pure\u2014in fact, he just wanted to know why she did not ask for his help. His eyes, as though of a curious child, persuaded her to answer.In a trance, Leah\u2019s lips had started to move. \u201cI\u2026\u201dAfter hesitating several times, her prudently chosen words finally came out of her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t you know the reason?\u201dAmong the various rules, laws, etiquette, and political conditions required of a royal princess, he has no clue?There were numerous other reasons why Ishakan could not help her. As a king, he should\u2019ve known that.However, he seemed confused\u2014probably, feigning ignorance.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d His calm and relaxed voice resonated. \u201cKurkans are quite simple. If we hate something, then we say no. If we like it, then we say yes. Simple.\u201dLeah slowly flickered her eyes to the window. Through it, the cold wind slowly entered her chamber, making the long curtains swung rhythmically. The dark chamber, with only the two of them inside, was illuminated by the moonlight.If anything, this setting, it reminded her ofthatnight.That time when she didn\u2019t have to think of anything and had only succumbed to her pure instincts.Thinking of it, her mouth felt dry. Leah avoided his piercing gaze and said in a stern voice, \u201cGet out.\u201dIshakan grinned, not a bit offended of her sending him out. \u201cAlright. If that\u2019s your wish.\u201dHis nonchalant response brought relief to Leah\u2014but it didn\u2019t last long. For in the next second, her sight rocketed to the ceiling as Ishakan grabbed her close to his body. Using one hand, he lifted her petite body by supporting her buttocks.She froze, but hugged Ishakan\u2019s shoulders eventually, afraid to fall. She was in a daze. In an urgent tone, she spoke.\u201cPut me down!\u201dAs expected, he paid no heed to her orders. Seeing that words alone could not restrain his actions, she struggled to wriggle her body with all her might.But, how could a frail woman be ever at par with a beast\u2019s strength? Instead, Ishakan effortlessly held her, firmly locking her to her position.Finding his face amidst her struggle, she was greeted by his two eyes, which glowed of delight. Ishakan intentionally inched his face closer to her and whispered.\u201cYou told me to get out.\u201dHis warm breath touched her lips. He was so close to her that upon a little move, their nose would touch. Leah hurriedly tilted her head backward and hastily spoke.\u201cPut\u2026 me\u2026 down!\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dAnd with that, Ishakan crossed the bedroom with rapid and light footsteps and nimbly jumped off the railing, where Leah had always wanted to leap from but had not even dared to do so.\u2654\u2654\u2654The king of Kurkans was a fierce being, embodying his savage dominions. Such power and strength, everyone believed that he held no fear of almost everything\u2014not even perturbed of abducting the princess from the palace.Holding Leah in his arms, his expression did not once flinch. It was as if he was only holding a feather.Amidst the night, his figure glided on the ground agile and light, before finally disappearing behind the shadows of the nearby trees\u2026Even the tight security in the palace had not become a hindrance to him. He drifted through the area and took unpaved roads, which were not accessible for the commoners.Despite the place swarmed by guards, he easily avoided them. Dainty movements, he made not a single sound\u2014a hunter\u2019s characteristic his kind was born with.The damsel in distress, Leah, thought of screaming so that he would let her go. But thinking twice, she eventually dropped the idea, knowing that she would suffer the most damage once they were discovered together at this time of the night.She gazed at her surroundings as Ishakan held her. They swiftly passed by the castle of Estia. She could not imagine that someone could easily breach the palace like this! It seemed ridiculous, imagining herself struggling through the secret passage all this time.The cool wind ruffled her hair, making tangles. Nights in Estia had always been cold, but despite being in her thin nightgown, Leah was kept warm by Ishakan\u2019s naturally hot body temperature.As soon as they stepped out of the palace\u2019s perimeter, she felt her heart race fast. Afraid he might feel it, \u00a0Leah pressed her hand over her chest. She had always acted tough in front of him, unwilling to appear vulnerable, and she didn\u2019t want her heartbeat to give her away.She internally sighed. She sought recluse in the confines of her room, but it was the source of her anxiety, who came seeking her instead. Not only that, her supposed to be serene night was now stirred in all ways.Nervous and excited at the same time, she felt like a child committing a wicked act behind her parent\u2019s back.Soon, they reached the edge of the forest, and Ishakan put Leah down to stand on her feet. From a distance, the palace could be seen; its faint sounds reverberating and glowing lights beautiful.Unlike her well-lit home, the forest was dark. Leah had to blink her eyes to adjust to the dimness of her surroundings. Ishakan gazed through her silver hair, faintly shining under the moonlight. The silver hair that represented the Kingdom of Estia.Then, he bent his neck upwards and spread out his arms in the air. Noticing this, Leah was dumbfounded, even more so when he flicked his fingers.What are you doing?She wanted to ask, when suddenly, a cloak flappingly dropped from the sky. Ishakan grabbed it effortlessly.With this bizarre scenario flashing before her, Leah widened eyes scrutinized the top of the nearest tree.Looking up, she squinted, uncaring if her neck would snap at such an uncomfortable angle. But, no matter how she looked, she saw nothing, not even a slight movement.Hence, she could only assume that someone was hiding in the shadows\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was then that she felt soft fabric wrapped around her. Ishakan gently placed his cloak to cocoon Leah, who was barely dressed in her slightly sheer nightgown and briefly said. \u201cSomeone is tailing after me\u2014one of my men. They are called escort knight here in Estia, right?\u201dOn their way here, she didn\u2019t sense any hint of an escort knight following them. It seemed that his senses were beyond average.Leah covered her hair with a considerable amount of cloth, as it was her attribute that would likely get attention. She securely tied the ribbon and tightly stretched the hem of the cloak to fully conceal her form. Revealing herself to any onlooker was the last thing she needed.Only after Ishakan was certain that Leah was fully covered did he speak.\u201cI wanted to tour around the royal metropolis, but I am not exactly knowledgeable of this kingdom. I am just a countryman from the east side of the desert. So I thought it would be nice to see you again\u2026and Estia, of course.\u201d He smiled and repeated, \u201cOf course.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Until then, you should hang out with me.\u201dObliged and dragged by Ishakan, Leah headed to the downtown.At first, she walked reluctantly. Nonetheless, her pace slowly increased as she started loitering in the area. The eyes that only looked down the road now gleamingly roamed along the sights in the street.It was her first time to be outside without any objective in mind. It felt unfamiliar and awkward, wandering around for pleasure\u2019s sake.Like a giddy child, Leah manically snooped around. She unconsciously followed the delicious smell of food, leading her to the street food vendor. As she approached the food stall, she stepped back, startled.Temptation in the form of glazed, skewered meatballs bombarded her senses. She didn\u2019t expect this kind of attack tonight. Slowly, she willed herself to keep a distance, ignoring its tenacious appetizing smell.On the other hand, the king of Kurkans stood with his arms crossed.In contrast to forcefully dragging her with him to the town, he left her alone when they reached the town square, giving her the liberty to take in everything by herself, unrestricted.Patiently, he only observed her from afar, but he had not once tore his sharp gaze from her.Leah was deeply engrossed in her bustling environment when Ishakan thrusted something in front of her, making her freeze in her place.It was the skewered meatball she had been ogling at a while ago! It was minced pork squeezed into a ball and threaded into a skewer. While being grilled, the appetizing savory smell diffused into the air. The sauce was sprinkled on its top, making her salivate the more.\u201cEat this.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t we agree that you will take whatever I give?\u201d She drooled. It was because she had not eaten anything at all today. Her stomach grumbled at the sight.However, she remembered she had to wear a tight dress in front of Cerdina tomorrow morning. She wondered if she made a mistake in eating the dates.She wanted to refuse, but the temptation was intense. Even if she closed her eyes and turned her head to the side, she couldn\u2019t resist it.Maybe only one bite\u2026So, she carefully took the skewer to her mouth. As she bit the soft meat, the grilled golden surface tore apart, from which juices oozed.The moment she tasted it, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from eating more.\u201cIs Estia\u2019s royal family poor? I think just selling one painting would be enough to feed you for months.\u201d Ishakan muttered, but Leah did not hear any of his words. Instead, she gobbled on her food, focused.Soon, she came back to her sense, and was shocked at the savage deed she just committed.I finished the whole skewer!A sense of shame engulfed her. She couldn\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t exercise self-control\u2014eating the whole skewer by herself! On top of that, she acted like a beggar that had been given alms.Ishakan grinned as she saw Leah bear such a devastated look on her face, while all the savory sauce was still smudged all over her mouth.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to make a face that looks like the world has just fallen on you.\u201d\u201cBut, I need to wear a dress tomorrow\u2026\u201dShe nibbled her lower lip, agitated. Ishakan extended his hands, and his coarse fingertips rubbed her lips.\u201cDon\u2019t bite your lips. It will go to waste.\u201d He wiped off the remaining sauce from her mouth and tasted it. The way he licked his tongue was so natural and\u2026sensual that Leah was at lost on how to react.Realizing it too late, she shrieked with her innermost thoughts. She could not believe that Ishakan broke all the proper decorum she learned since birth.\u201cEating only one skewer wouldn\u2019t affect your figure. You are so thin!\u201d Ishakan took the emptied skewer from her and indifferently uttered a word.\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHis words stuck in her head.

It was like she was slapped in the face by how bewildered she was with Ishakan\u2019s crazy thinking. It was an outrageous notion!Not waiting for her to get over her shock, Ishakan only grabbed ahold of her wrist and began to drag her behind him. She felt like she was in a daze, reaching an alley.Light, from the main road, seeped along the walls. It was quiet, and despite being obviously deserted, there were still a couple of people passing by every now and then.

She hadn\u2019t realized she brought her two hands in front of her, clasping them together.\u201cDon\u2019t be scared.\u201d he told her, her eyes drifting down to his lips, watching the way it moved as he spoke, \u201cYou can speak freely around me.\u201d he drew even closer, until his lips was right next to her ear, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to act like a princess when it\u2019s just us.\u201d He whispered, nodding at her as he recalled what had transpired in the palace gardens, encouraging her to speak her mind.Soon the tension built inside her settled down, and was replaced with a myriad of jumbled sensations.I don\u2019t have to act like a princess\u2026she thought wistfully. Never before had she heard such words addressed to her in all her life. She had strived to betheperfect princess in every way, and those words just crashed her walls down. Not even the Countess Melissa, who had been with her since she was just a child, had told her such words.Overwhelmed by her mixed feelings, she finally let out a deep breath.\u201cAre you out of your mind!?\u201d she exclaimed in a whisper, but Ishakan didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by her reaction.\u201cWell, the princess who beautifully grew up is indeed special.\u201d he gave her a roguish grin, teasing her. And Leah shook her head at him incredulously.\u201cIn this situation, you truly are insane.\u201dIshakan is the first person in her life who dared suggest ridiculous things in front of Leah. \u00a0This stranger from the desert was indeed making her feel a lot of things she wasn\u2019t used to before. Leah let out a frustrated sigh and opted to keep her mouth shut.Silence soon fell between them. And during their silence, Leah could only blink at the dim light. Despite calling Ishakan insane, she too could feel herself going crazy.Amidst the silence, she slowly closed and opened her eyes. Even though she called Ishakan crazy, Leah herself is going nuts at this very moment, too.He truly is a dangerous person\u2014someone not to be involved with.\u2019She thought grimly. \u2018The king of the enemies with an unidentified purpose.But Leah was still curious about Ishakan, and seeing no other way to quench her curiosity, she opened her mouth to speak.\u201cYou-\u201d but she was quickly cut off by the sound of boisterous laughter, and booming music that was reverberating in the alleyway. Her curiosity shifting towards the noise, she pushed Ishakan aside to look out, and saw a band of Gypsies dancing about in the alley.Their laughter too had caught Ishakan\u2019s attention, who had mirrored Leah\u2019s actions, before muttering under his breath. \u201cTomaris.\u201d he grunts and Leah looks at him in confusion, \u201cYou people might know them as Gypsies.\u201d he clarifies for her as he continues to observe them, \u201cI don\u2019t like them much really.\u201d he admits.Like most people in the continent, Kurkans steer clear of Gypsies. After all, they never settle in one place for long, and do the odd job or two to make a living. Their jobs range from selling handicrafts, to luring people in ridiculous astrological myth, singing, dancing, and so on.But even more so is the blatant prostitution that occurs whenever Gypsies band together, which only serves to endager public security and peace. But despite their negative reputation, they still existed because some people do keep them running.However, there are also some who are well-versed in the art of sorcery. And because of this, more often than not, wealthy merchants, and even the nobles, would secretly seek out their services, buying love potions, or cursed dolls, and would pay them in securing their safety and livelihood.There also stemmed the old warning, that when one would mess with Gypsies, bad things will come. Hence most people turn a blind eye to their lawlessness.Such a troublesome group indeed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThey\u2019re like weeds,\u201d he grumbled, \u201cNo matter how hard you pluck them out, more of them keeps popping out.\u201d he let out a defeated sigh, \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood anymore.\u201d he said in a distasteful frown, before turning towards Leah, and pulled her close to him once more.\u201cDo you think we can pick up from where we left off?\u201d he asked her teasingly, but Leah couldn\u2019t find the words to reply to him with.

For hidden in the shadows, was a man, who had his head poking out and looking at them.He was a slender man with a lean build, and his stare was as sharp as a cat\u2019s. He hurriedly made his way towards them, and gestured quickly to the alley before disappearing once more.Frowning, Ishakan went back outside to see what was happening. Leah felt her heart sink as she followed him out.There was a middle-aged man, flirting with some of the Gypsies. Behind him were knights, dressed in casual clothes, watching dutifully as he laughed in amusement with the Gypsies. Leah\u2019s eyes narrowed as she saw who the man was.It was her fiance, Byun Gyongbaek.\u201cAmazing,\u201d Ishakan mused, \u201cIsn\u2019t that Byun Gyongbaek?\u201d he asked her, leaning in further onto Leah\u2019s damp hat, while she had barely fixed the hem of her cloak.It was a well-known fact that Byun Gyongbaek was quite fond of any form of entertainment. Whenever he would wander into the West\u2019s Royal District, he, without fail, would head straight first to the red light district, whose alleys were filled with alcohol and women.However, she had not expected to see him today.Leah hopes none of his knights would notice them, allowing them to slip away with ease. But it seemed that would not happen, for his knights had already spotted them. She caught them glancing to one another, watching their in their peripherals.One of his knights drew closer to him, whispering softly.And Byun Gyongbaek\u2019s grip on the woman gypsie\u2019s waist loosened up, his grin turned into a frown as he shifted his gaze towards them.Unlike Leah, who was clearly covered and well-disguised. Ishakan was not.They couldn\u2019t run. They\u2019d surely be caught.Leah finds herself in a difficult situation. She hadn\u2019t anticipated sneaking out of the castle late at night would turn dangerous. Her worst case scenario involved being caught by some of the guards of the Royal family, but not this.\u201cIt\u2019s too late if we run for it now.\u201d Ishakan calmly told her, which was a clear contrast to the panic she was feeling at this very moment. She looked at him desperately, watching as his eyes glinted dangerously as at the nearing figures. It was clear to her, he had no intention of running away.Suddenly she was reminded of the Kurkan\u2019s hostile nature. And the man in front of her was their leader.As if reading the Kurkan\u2019s mind, the knights simultaneously grasped the hilts of their swords as they neared him, Byun Gyongbaek leading the entourage. He stopped in front of them.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? A Kurkan?\u201d he asked mockingly, and Leah watched her fiance, dumbfounded. He spoke so casually to the king. But aside from Leah, no one was surprised with the way he addressed him.But instead of retaliating, Ishakan only stared him down.Now Gyongbaek wasn\u2019t short by any nature, but in front of Ishakan, he might as well be. And because of his inferiority, Gyongbaek compensates in his actions, acting tougher than he actually is.\u201cAre you out of your mind? You must be! Wandering carelessly inside the palace walls.\u201d Gyongbaek remarked and Ishakan snorted.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I mean no harm. I can wander as carelessly as I want.\u201d he replied with quick wit. Byun Gyongbaek huffed out in displeasure, stopping short of retaliating when he caught sight of Leah, hidden behind Ishakan.He quirked up a brow towards her, staring at her up and down, before zeroing in on her neatly trimmed nails.\u201cWhere\u2019d you find that woman?\u201d he scoffed, \u201cShe\u2019s so\u2026 small and thin. I imagine she won\u2019t look so appealing.\u201dThat was when Leah realized he must have mistook her for a prostitute. Which was a relief. Quickly she hid her hands beneath her cloak, careful not to blow her cover. Gyongbaek barked out a laugh when she hid her fingers from view, and turned back to Ishakan.\u201cYou must like my fiance.\u201d Gyongbaek said tauntingly, \u201cIs that why you chose her?\u201d he looked at Leah, \u201cOh well, I may not know where you got her, but would you like me to give you some recommendations? I know quite a few who have some striking resemblance to her.\u201d he boasted, thinking he was doing him a favor but Ishakan only snorted in amusement.Byun Gyongbaek thought he\u2019s one up the King of Kurkans simply because he was the one engaged to Leah. What a fool.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cTo compensate for your origin of a barbaric tribe, I can allow you a taste of such advanced culture we have here in the Royal Kingdom.\u201d He proudly stated, \u201cConsider it a favor from me.\u201d he winked, chuckling in pride, and his knights follow in suit.But Ishakan remained unmoved and unflinching, and only gave them a brief smirk.\u201cIt seems you\u2019re the one who\u2019s mistaken Byun Gyongbaek.\u201d Ishakan said in mocking disappointment, and the laughter stopped as the grin was once again wiped on his face.\u201cMe? Mistaken? Of you flirting with a princess-look-alike prostitute?!\u201d he asked incredulously and Ishakan shrugged.\u201cI am the one playing the role of a prostitute here.\u201d he simply stated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leah tried to shrug it off, repressing the rising laughter in her throat, taking deep breaths and releasing them slowly.She was fully aware that Byun was the type of man who gets lost easily. But the image in front of her currently was beyond her expectations. She struggled to try and contain the bubbling laughter as she looked at Byun Gyongbaek, his mouth agape, stuttering with incredulity.\u201cWha-what!?\u201d he sputtered indignantly. Ishakan cluck his tongue, hating the fact he needed to repeat himself, but did so anyway.\u201cI told you, I\u2019m playing the role of a prostitute. Does your hard of hearing comes with your old age?\u201d he rebutted, and Byun Gyongbaek looked absolutely gobsmacked.\u201cHow dare you, you filthy thing!\u201d\u201cHow about you take care of your health first before taking on a younger bride? This is a serious matter to be worried about.\u201d Ishakan smirked slightly at Byun Gyongbaek\u2019s paling face, before completely turning red with anger. And that drove the nail to the coffin, as it completely drove the wedge between them.\u201cHave you no shame?!\u201dLeah watched on the sidelines, completely amused by the events unfolding in front of her. The more this was going on, the harder she had to try to repress the bubbling laughter from releasing. She even had to turn around to prevent herself from laughing out loud.Across from her, she could see that the opposite were true of the Gypsies. They huddled close together, shoulders hunching in on themselves. They were clearly afraid.Following the line of sight of the Gypsies, she saw them looking frightfully at Ishakan. She could see them mouthing some words to each other, and upon a closer look, it seemed to resemble\u201cKurkans\u201d.As the Gypsies continued on whispering, some caught sight of Leah looking at them. Nudging their companion, they then turned their gaze to Leah, before quieting down. But she could see they were still whispering, just making sure she wouldn\u2019t be able to read their lips.Leah wasn\u2019t the only one that\u2019s noticed though.Ishakan\u2019s gaze flitted around the area, before narrowing towards the Gypsies. He quirked up an eyebrow, before moving to the side, and directed Leah to move behind him. She did so willingly, taking refuge behind his broad back.Upon seeing this, Byun Gyonbaek became even more furious.\u201cI had tried to send you off nicely, but now you\u2019re only asking for trouble!\u201dSuddenly Byun Gyonbaek\u2019s knights stepped forward, brandishing their swords. The onlookers began to scream in fright, and scrambled away without a second longer. Meanwhile, Leah bit her lip as she watched the events spiral out of control.To the outside eye, it would seem like these events were only the result of a sudden burst of rage, but she knew for a fact that was not true. All this was a premeditated act, one put on just for show.For Byun Gyongbaek knew that his position and power all stemmed from one fact alone: the ongoing war with the Kurkans. In his desperation to retain his power and control, he devised a plan that would undoubtedly ensue chaos and destroy the peace treaty.Should the King of Kurkans raise his blade against him within Estia\u2019s kingdom, then it could topple every effort made to maintain the treaty.Ishakan and Byun Gyongbaek knew what it meant, the inside story. But despite knowing Gyongbaek does have an underlying motive, Ishakan was not one to cower in front of a challenge. He wasn\u2019t about to back down.He barked out a laughter, mocking them as they held up their swords against him and gave Gyongbaek a smug grin.\u201cYou think this is all that would take to defeat me?\u201d he asked, even his eyes held a clear sense of victory. \u201cAnswer me, do you thinkthiswould be enough?\u201d he demanded.Leah felt her skin prickle, and goosebumps run down her spine as she watched the Kurkan King. He was a wild spirit. She felt herself stumble, and sense someone was behind her. When she turned to look, she let out a gasp as she realized he was a familiar face.It was the man from a while ago, the one that suddenly appeared in the alley. Here he was, bending one knee in front of her, like he would when he\u2019d pay homage to someone he dearly respected, and softly whispered.\u201cYour Highness, Ishakan and Byun Gyongbaek will take quite longer to finish, will you humbly accept my services?\u201d he asked her in a whisper. He was hinting that any moment now, the two men might break out in a fight, and Leah didn\u2019t want to get caught up in the crossfire, so she gave him a short nod.He sharply gestured to her to follow him towards the alleyway. Leah had gone as far as two steps away, before the knights began to lunge towards Ishakan. At the sound of swords clanging, people let out screams, scrambling away and towards the shelter of their houses.Leah had tried to look back to watch, but an insistent hand kept her moving.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous to stop and look, Your Highness. We must keep moving!\u201d He urged, \u201cQuickly now!\u201dAs much as he wanted to flee and bring her to safety with him, within a few blocks from the fight, Leah couldn\u2019t help but stop. Her curiosity got the best of her, and turned to see how the fight was progressing.When he realized she was no longer following, he turned around and bit back a curse as he saw her standing idly to watch.\u201cNo!\u201d He exclaimed and quickly reached her, \u201cPlease, if you stay we\u2019ll be in trouble!\u201d He pleaded, \u201cI\u2019ll be dead!\u201dBut his pleas fell on deaf ears. Leah was too mesmerized in the fight, watching how the knights were quickly overpowered by Ishakan. She had heard of the might of Kurkans, but she never witnessed it like this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He came up behind one of the knights, the one that was chasing after Leah, and broke his neck rather quickly before slashing at another who was nearby.He quickly ducked, avoiding the knight coming up from behind, and grabbed his arm, flipping him over, and pinning him down. Suddenly a loud shrill was heard as a bone cracked, and then he moved on the other.Blood dripped from his fingers, but before a drop could even hit the floor, he\u2019d already struck dead another knight, splattering even more blood. One by one the knights went down, until they\u2019d all been wiped out, annihilated by their supposed prey. They were outmatched by the King of Kurkans.And by the glint in Ishakan\u2019s golden eyes, he was clearly enjoying the thrill of the kill.Leah watched it all, a hand over her mouth as she tried to muffle the gasp of amazement. It spread an exhilarating thrill through her body. Kurkans were said to have possessed physical abilities greater than that of a normal person, but she didn\u2019t expect they\u2019d be this strong.The king barely even broke a sweat, his breathing remaining even despite the number of men he had been fighting against him. Not a scratch was made on his body, but he was bathed in the blood of the knights Byun Gyongbaek brought with him.Suddenly, Leah had thought about the knights of Estia. Because they had been living in peace for so long, they hadn\u2019t bothered to polish up either skills or weapons. They could never hope to go up against the might of the Kurkans.Should war break out, she would possibly be forced on her knees, begging Byun Gyongbaek for their lives. And should that happen, Estia would be at Byun\u2019s mercy.As realization dawned upon her, Leah shook out of her thoughts as the grim atmosphere washed over her.Estia\u2019s last hope lies with the peace treaty. They should quickly seal it with the Kurkans without further delay.***Tonight seemed much longer than the previous ones.Blain stood beneath the night sky, taking in a deep breath of the chilly air as he looked up to the darkened skies. With the moon lighting its usual silver hue, it painted the sky with a faint light, reminding him of someone.Despite knowing they had roughly the same color, he couldn\u2019t help but feel her hair held a uniqueness only to him. It didn\u2019t matter how hard he tried to find it in something else, he could never achieve it.His eyes remained glued to the moon, watching it until clouds rolled by and covering its light. He dropped his gaze, slowly lifting the cup of wine to his eye level as he watched the dark liquid swish and swirl, before bringing it up to his lips and downed it in one gulp until not even a single drop was left.Seeing he finished it, Blain set it aside\u201cBlain.\u201d He heard a soft voice call out from behind him, and he turned to look.\u201cMother,\u201d he acknowledged. But whereas her expression was soft and smiling, full of love for her only son by blood, Blain\u2019s face was nothing but devoid of emotion. He only blinked at her, not even offering a smile in return.Such a cold reaction, but Cerdina did not mind.\u201cHave you finished?\u201d she asked him, and he only thrust the empty glass towards her. Cerdina stared at the empty goblet, and fixed her shawl, pulling it over her shoulders, before speaking once more.\u201cWe\u2019ll catch a cold out here, let\u2019s come inside,\u201d She told him, but Blain did not move. He only remained in his spot, leaning over the rails, as he continued to stare at her. Soon the clouds left the moon, finally revealing its light once more.The light reflected Blain\u2019s silvery locks, creating a wonderful shine.Silver hair, the mark of one meant for the throne. So extraordinary it was, it sparkled beneath the moonlight. Looking admiringly at her son, Cerdina held his stare with a soft smile.As if sensing where she was looking at, Blain ran his hand through his hair.\u201cWhat happens when the peace treaty is amended?\u201d He asked, holding her warm gaze with a cold and calculating look. \u201cWill Byun Gyongbaek and Leah\u2019s marriage happen then?\u201dCerdina only gave a knowing smile, stepping towards him steadily, and cupped his cheek gently, \u201cWhen you become king,\u201d she started, the wind carrying her voice. \u201cWhen that happens, then everything you want, everything in this kingdom will be yours, Your Highness.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBlain gave her a brief smile, in his nervousness, he moved his arm, effectively knocking off the empty glass, which crashed into shattered pieces when it hit the rocky terrain.

Leah woke up that morning, feeling quite refreshed after the thrilling experience of going out once more.The preparations for today\u2019s conference had begun early in the morning. Servants rushed about to make sure everything and anything would run smoothly. Leah had only a piece of a cookie for breakfast, glazed with honey, and a bread dipped with wine.Others may find it a measly meal, but for Leah it was more than enough. She even purposefully ate more than she would in order to prevent any accidents such as fainting due to lack of energy from the marching that would happen today.Once she finished putting on her undergarments, the maids soon set out to prepare the rest of her outfit for the ceremony. They followed her dutifully to assist any preparation she would need.As they prepared her dress, Leah sat leisurely on her vanity, scattered documents littered in front of her as she read through what she missed the day before, and one of the maids handed her her quill, and placed the ink bottle in a neat place on her table.Another drew near, holding a brush and powder.\u201cMy lady, your face please.\u201d they requested, but Leah only continued on reading, which was contrary to the request. Carefully, as to not spill the ink all over, she dipped her quill to the ink as she carefully wrote down, and browsed through even more of the documents.Despite barely catching sleep, she did not feel exhausted. In fact, she felt as if she was sharper now, more attentive to details, and not much was left forgotten. Although, events of yesterday did keep running through her thoughts.It was undisputed that Byun Gyong Baek did an excellent job in keeping the Kurkans at bay in the west, but many things have changed since then. Because of the war for the throne, the Kurkan\u2019s forces were halved. Most of the long war was because of an internal struggle, so when Ishakan came, and killed the current king before taking the throne himself, it ended rather quickly.When Ishakan had ascended the throne, he immediately summoned the countless tribes of Kurkans, and swore them to his allegiance. And thus the real Mater of the Desert was born.Leah dropped her gaze, so deep in thought.If I were the new King of Kurkans, what will I do in this kind of situation?\u00a0Will harmonizing the scattered tribes at once be the simplest and easiest way to unite the nation?But no matter what the question, she could only find one answer. There must be an enemy.It was most likely that the Kurkans were only feigning their interest in making the peace treaty, with an ulterior motive to create a war. This current visit could just be a ruse, a way to scope out the competition.And Byun Gyong Baek does not want peace with the Kurkans, either.It seemed that in all the kingdoms involved, Estia was the only one who truly wanted the peace treaty to fall through. Leah tilted her head, turning slightly and called out in a hushed tone as she recalled last night\u2019s events.\u201cCountess.\u201d she said, and Melissa, who had been brushing her hair softly, had paused. She looked up and stared at the mirror, meeting Leah\u2019s gaze. \u201cPlease contact Count Valtein, tell him I wish to meet him later in the conference.\u201d she ordered and Melissa nodded.\u201cShould I tell him to meet you outside of the conference?\u201d Leah gave a terse nod, and Melissa gave a slight curtsy. \u201cThen I shall tell Baroness Cinael to relay the message.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Leah said.Countess Melissa finished a few more touch ups before leaving to do as was requested, but not before reminding the maids that remained to finish getting her ready. When the Countess was gone, Leah picked up a brooch, with stones of diamond and amethyst.She watched as Countess Melissa approached Baroness Cinael from her mirror. The baroness, she noticed, was deeply vexed. She watched as they conversed, before finally giving her attention on the documents before her once more.Cerdina will look for her soon, but before that, she wished to remain in her thoughts as she kept a watchful eye on the preparations for the conference. They needed something to dangle for the Kurkans to willingly go into a treaty.One, that not even the King of Kurkans, could ever refuse.Her grip on the quill tightened in the thought as she scribbled another signature.\u201cPrincess?\u201d Leah looked up and quirked an eyebrow\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, and the maid flushed before dropping her gaze.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing my Lady.\u201d Leah kept her gaze on the maid, before returning back to the documents after discerning nothing was wrong. But when she moved to write, she found her hands frozen, and Ishakan\u2019s golden eyes flashed through her mind as if he was currently looking at her.***Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIshakan let out a puff of smoke as he blew from a leaf cigarette, staring blankly outside. There was a cool, yet faint sweet scent wafting through the room. As he continued smoking, he watched as wisps of the smoke clung around his torso, before dissipating. He blew out yet another puff of smoke.He was still dressed, and watched as the colorful fabrics, which decorated his skin, were removed one by one. When that was done, his jewels soon followed suit.When his servants had finished picking out the best clothes for his wardrobe next, they began dressing him once more.His torso was left uncovered for the following events that would occur, but the servants dressing him had wandering eyes, raking over his bare skin, marvelling at the smooth, unblemished flesh, free of any tattoos.Yet, he felt none of those hungry gazes\u2013his mind was too filled with the thoughts of the petite woman with the silver hair\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She carefully sidestepped the array of servants, before holding out an ashtray for her king, to which Ishakan effectively dropped the growing ash from his cigarette.\u201cGenin,\u201d he acknowledged, \u201cWhere\u2019s Haban?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s scoping out the conference hall.\u201d She answered. \u201cHe told me he wanted to make up for last night\u2019s little skirmish.\u201d Her tone was haughty as she spoke bluntly to him. It might have sounded like she was defending Haban, but Ishakan knew better as he shook out more ash, and blew out another puff of smoke.Last night, Princess Leah had witnessed a glimpse of a Kurkan\u2019s true nature. He would have preferred if she did not\u2014she didn\u2019t need to see it.Certainly, it would have been better if Haban had managed to get her away before the events occured, but Ishakan was thinking perhaps it was another factor that couldn\u2019t be avoided in that circumstance.\u201cWhat can I do then?\u201d he asked her, \u201cI was born like this, I couldn\u2019t hide it for the rest of my life.\u201d\u201cI know, but-\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019m not one who\u2019s easily frightened either,\u201d he continued, cutting her off, before letting out a fond smile, \u201cDo you know how brave she was? Instead of being frightened and scared, she\u2019s working hard, worrying about last night.\u201dIshakan then let out a sigh, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to use her to our advantage in the negotiation.\u201d He admitted as he discarded the cigarette, placing it on the ashtray as he put on his robes. \u201cShe was always like that, so devoid of fear.\u201dHis unruly brown locks were then slicked back as they were combed over, clearing out any obstacle to reveal his sharp eyes and forehead. The collared garment was engraved with colorful embroidery embedded with gold threads. The servants thoroughly filled the small buttons one by one in a row and trimmed them neatly so that there were no wrinkles on the cloth.\u201cOnce the negotiations begin, I think the most problematic part will be the princess since she is the core of the royal family.\u201d He fretted.\u201cBut the negotiation is just an excuse, right?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026but\u2026\u201dIshakan held the leaf tobacco in his hands again once more, hovering it close to his mouth. She\u2019s one of the many reasons why he came to Estia. But it seems that Leah is becoming more and more the priority than anything else. Ishakan sighed and puffed up smoke, lost in his thoughts.\u201cBut it keeps on bothering me.\u201d He finished softly.Genin didn\u2019t know whom Ishakan was referring to, but she could fully understand. Genin blinked as she asked a question.\u201cAren\u2019t you here to repay her kindness? Do you have an interest in her?\u201d She finally asked, and instead of receiving a reply, Ishakan only offered her a smirk, which gave Genin a clear picture on what he was planning.\u201cYou\u2019re making her your bride.\u201d She stated, and Ishakan let out a bark of laughter.The idea itself was absurd.\u201cYou think too much as a Kurkan. You must keep in mind, she\u2019s an Estian.\u201d\u201cWhy should that matter?\u201dIshakan lets out a sigh. \u201cJust don\u2019t look at it from a Kurkan\u2019s perspective.\u201dAt the statement, Genin\u2019s brows furrowed in thought, and soon fell silent, before finding her voice once more.\u201cIt\u2019ll be a difficult path.\u201d She told him in reply.Indeed, it was a hard thing for Genin to understand. After all, she got married to her husband when they held her captive, which was the Kurkan way. And for the Kurkans, it didn\u2019t matter that Leah was already betrothed to Byun Gyongbaek.Ishakan took his time to formulate a reply as he chose what accessories he would be wearing for the day, particularly the only around his neck.\u201cOne step at a time,\u201d he told her, \u201cAnd let\u2019s begin with today\u2019s banquet.\u201d Genin nodded in acceptance before looking over the jewelries as well.\u201cThe one on the right looks like it would suit you better.\u201d She supplied helpfully, and Ishakan nodded.He picked up the necklace, the one with a fiery red ruby as its centerpiece. The door then burst open, as a Kurkan servant came in and stopped shortly behind them.\u201cYour Majesty, he\u2019s arrived.\u201d The servant told them and Ishakan straightened up.The person they\u2019ve been waiting for finally arrived. Ishakan received the hand mirror another servant handed over to him and checked his nape.\u201cLet him in.\u201d He ordered, and the servant quickly obeyed, leaving the room once more. The next time the door opened, a middle-aged man entered.His attire was fit for the banquet. Despite it being modelled largely after the latest Estian style, he would undoubtedly stand out in the crowd, even those of Kurkans.He had a confident aura around him as he stood up straight and tall. But despite his bravado, he couldn\u2019t hide the cold sweat that was beginning to form on his temples. HIs eyes raked over the room, before stopping at Ishakan, meeting his golden eyes. He gulped down briefly and stood still.\u201cI believe this is our first meeting.\u201d Ishakan started and the man gave a terse nod.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a pleasure to finally meet the King of Kurkans.\u201d The man responded. Ishakan beamed at him despite the late greeting.\u201cPlease, don\u2019t be nervous,\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t bite.\u201dThe man only let out a light laugh before silence reigned once more. He didn\u2019t know how else to respond to the slight tease.\u201cIndeed, Kurkans don\u2019t eat humans.\u201d Genin added with a genuine smile, and though it was meant to put the man at ease, he was still not. Genin moved back as Ishakan came forward to finally shake the man\u2019s hand, before gesturing to the nearby chair.\u201cPlease sit,\u201d Ishakan offers, \u201cWe have much to discuss.\u201d He added, but the man did not move, and was still resolutely standing.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI won\u2019t say anything that would bring harm to Estia.\u201d He already clarified as Ishakan observed him.This one\u2019s not so easily fooled, I see.Ishakan thought.Is this why Leah keeps him around? She\u2019s got a good sense of people, I\u2019ll admit.He mused to himself before letting out a light chuckle.\u201cAnd you won\u2019t need to,\u201d he reassured. \u201cBut that\u2019s not why you\u2019re here.\u201d He signalled his servants, and one of them moves to bring out a box that was placed by the corner, before bringing it closer to the two men, presenting it between them.The man did not want anything to do with what the box contained, but when the servant opened it up, his eyes widened as he saw what was inside. Seeing his reaction, Ishakan moved to his side, whispering right next to his ear\u2026\u201cAll I want,\u201d he began to utter, \u201cIs to get close to you,\u201d Ishakan pulled away as the man looked at him warily, \u201cCount Valtein.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the tables were an array of many wines and delicacies of Estia, even the decorations were a work of art. It almost seemed like Estia wanted to make a statement, to showcase everything they have and can offer to their allies.And while the many nobles appeared to be enjoying the magnificent feast, Leah was not.Despite being in charge of the preparations, and she should be happy everything had gone rather smoothly, she was exhausted. Just thinking about the week long conference is making her less and less thrilled by the moment. She wanted it to be over.With a blank expression, Leah dragged her feet under her, forcing her to attend the conference. The hem of her dress, which was cream-colored, dragged over the polished marble floor along with her. As she walked through the hallway, in a still dignified manner despite her exhaustion, she could feel the lingering stares at the back of her head, along with faint murmurings surrounding her.She could hazard a guess as to why.It was obviously because of the King of Kurkans, Ishakan. He had made an impression to the public, clearly displaying his interest in her. It fueled the gossip around the palace, its people. Some of the rumours were even malicious in nature, about the barbaric king and his relationship with a beautiful princess.As the rumours spread, facts and the truth became distorted, even going as far as thinking there was a secret child between them.Leah could scoff at them. Ridiculous.Even Byun Gyongbaek, who heard these rumours, became enraged. He tried his best to nip the rumours in the bud before it even spread further, but Leah couldn\u2019t be bothered to lift a finger. They were after all, just rumours in the end.People only listen to what they want to hear, never mind the awful truth. Since she no longer possessed her so-calleddignitythat she should have protected, making Byun Gyongbaek angry was at least worth it. It served its purpose.She glanced at the banquet hall.Not a Kurkan was still in sight. And because of their political pride, not even the royals of Estia would make an appearance before their arrival.The reason Leah had been there first, was because it was her duty to greet the guests and welcome them. It was also a good excuse. It was better to be there, than to have to mingle with Cerdina and Blain. It was an unbearable thought.When she finished greeting everyone, she quickly searched around for Count Valtein before greeting any of the other guests. She knew her message had been successfully relayed, so he must be waiting for her already.There were many that would be willing to back Leah up when the time came, and one of them was Count Valtein. He was the representative for the Pro-Princess power after all.Although, Leah muses,powerwas a bit of an exaggeration. After all, her only use was to be a bartered off bride to the highest bidder. Still, Count Valtein was rather proud to be her confidant. He even served as her eyes and ears.Because she wasn\u2019t allowed to leave the palace, she couldn\u2019t move within her wishes just about anywhere. There are even times the Count would visit in secret, to help her tackle the internal issues the palace was facing. Also, it was because of him, she could sneak out of the palace, especially when he opened up the unused irrigation just for her sake.She wanted to hear about the latest news from him, knowing whatever information he would have for her, it would be viable. After all, she would need information, one that not even the palace or its highest of social circles were privy to.Leah did one more scan around the room, before her eyes finally landed on Count Valtein, who was fast approaching like a child on his way to his present. He practically looked like he was about to jump for joy too if it wasn\u2019t for the others around them.\u201cPrincess!\u201d He exclaimed as he saw her. Honestly, it was like they hadn\u2019t seen each other for years, when Leah knows it was otherwise. She gave a nod of acknowledgement, allowing him to calm down, before leading him to a secluded corner in the banquet hall. It was an open space, but private enough to talk.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She asked and Count Valtein breathed out in relief\u2026\u201cI almost died yesterday,\u201d he sulked\u201cWhat?\u201d Leah asked in alarm, before Count Valtein straightened up and smiled at her.\u201cI met the King of the Kurkans.\u201dLeah didn\u2019t know what to say, but look at the Count with a dumbfounded look. He was making it seem like he was saved from some fox\u2019s trap with how much he was making a fuss about it.\u201cThe King sought me out first, mind you,\u201d he began, \u201cLike he also wanted to meddle with Estia\u2019s internal affairs, I didn\u2019t betray any secrets, of course, but he was absolutely convincing and undoubtedly charismatic!\u201d he praised.He sought out Count Valtein?!Leah hadn\u2019t expected Ishakan was gutsy enough to actually do that. She couldn\u2019t help but feel the bead of sweat trickle down her temples the more she listened to the Count Valtein tell his story.\u201cHe wanted to win me over, he even gave me a gift!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cA gift?\u201d Leah asked, before frowning a bit, \u201cWhat gift?\u201d\u201cTen rolls of silk.\u201d he answered in a subdued tone, and Leah stared at him with a narrowed stare. The Count began to stutter at her unimpressed look, \u201cIt was no ordinary silk, I assure you!\u201d he retracted.He looks around, before drawing closer, as Leah does with him with her ear.\u201cIt was purple silk.\u201d he whispered reverently, and Leah pulled back with a shocked expression.Purple silks were of a priceless value, coveted by many, even in Estia, who wasn\u2019t part of the Royal Family. But there weren\u2019t many who could easily gain access to it, even if you did have the capacity to attain it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even a small number of millionaires could only own just a few pieces of purple silk. Only the royal family of Estia and Byun Gyongbaek of Oberde have enough purple cloth to wear.It was the ultimate symbol of wealth and power. Even a small piece of it would be absolutely priceless.\u201cIt was more vivid and beautiful than any other purple silk I\u2019ve ever seen before.\u201d he recalled wistfully. No words could truly describe its magnificence for it would only fall short on describing its perfection. \u201cIt\u2019s just like your eyes.\u201d he added as an afterthought, and Leah felt the tip of her ears flush from the praise.But while Leah tried to fight off her blush, Count Valtein only continued rambling.\u201cOf course, I rejected the gift. He said it is a gift, but it was not for free, of course. I don\u2019t know what he would ask in return for the favor, but I firmly turned him down.\u201d he reassured her, his jovial face turned serious. Although, she could see a hint of regret for having to turn down such a magnificent gift.Count Valtein always liked to dress up. He was always updated with the latest fashion trend in the city and frequented in the dressmaker\u2019s shop. He used to be so happy when something he made became so popular. Rejecting Ishakan\u2019s precious gift thereby meant so much for Count Valtein.\u201cThank you.\u201d Leah said in a grateful whisper, before Count Valtein shook his head and smiled at her with reassurance.\u201cDon\u2019t say that. I only did what was right.\u201d Count Valtein shook off his head as if to rid himself of the yearning for the purple silk. He continued to speak with a serious face. \u201cAnyway, just as he reached out to me, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he met other nobles too. You need to be careful.\u201d he warned.Count Valtein\u2019s words rang true, but this was only a small portion of the truth.In their society, Count Valtein was one of a kind. There were plenty more aristocrats and nobles who would\u2019ve taken the gift with no second thought, and thus, would have been indebted to the Kurkans. For now, all they could do was keep an eye out on whichever noble was uncharacteristically supportive of the Kurkans during the cabinet meeting.\u201cKurkans amaze me,\u201d Count Valtein continued, \u201cBribing others with such grandiose objects. I\u2019m sure they can even bribe some with something far more precious than gems or gold.\u201d Leah frowned at him with worry before agreeing.Still, she had doubts that those ten rolls of purple silk were all they had. The wealth of the Kurkans in the desert was rumoured to be beyond imaginable. For them it might have been a priceless commodity, but for the ones manufacturing the cloth, it would barely make a dent in their supply.After surmising her thoughts, Leah turned once more to the Count.\u201cWe also cannot rule out that the Kurkans know how to make this purple silk.\u201dJust as the Count was about to give her his reply, silence fell upon the banquet, as if dousing a fire with a bucket of water. There was a shift in the air, as all eyes fell on the entrance, and not just them both.Whispers began when they realized who it was that has captivated everyone\u2026\u201cThe barbarians\u2026\u201d Leah could hear somewhere off the distance as the Kurkans, their honorable guests, had finally made their appearance.They were all dressed in their traditional robes, it\u2019s color dark, a complete contrast to Estia\u2019s brightly colored clothes. It was no wonder it captured the attention of many. Despite it being their ceremonial clothes, one could not deny the ferocity in each of their movements.It was the way they looked, the way they stood, walked and held their chin up high, that they were more than just ordinary humans. And leading the entourage was none other than Ishakan himself.Their eyes raked over the banquet hall, reminding Leah of a predator trespassing on another\u2019s territory.Some of the nobles around couldn\u2019t help but flinch when their gaze would land on them.But the most eye-catching of them all was Ishakan\u2019s ceremonial robes. It had the traditional Kurkan-styled collar, its black fabric embroidered with golden threads, one that had never been seen in Estia. But that wasn\u2019t the most captivating part.No.It was the purple silk that he wore like a sash, stretched across his torso. Ornate patterns littered all over the expanse of the silk, light reflecting off its surface whenever it hit him. Leah, who had rarely sought out the luxuries of life, couldn\u2019t help but covet it as well. She could see now what Count Valtein was wistful about.The Kurkan\u2019s purple silk was a cut above the rest over the entire continent.So fixated on the silk, she hadn\u2019t realized she had been staring until she looked up and met Ishakan\u2019s knowing stare. She held his gaze for a moment before averting her eyes and thought about resuming her conversation with the Count.As she turned to Count Valtein, she was taken aback by the fierce look he had in his eyes, trailing to someone in front of him.Is he glaring at Ishakan?She wondered. His eyes were staring resolutely in front of them, which prompted her to do the same when a dark shadow was cast in front of her, which made her choke back a gasp.Golden eyes looked down on her, a smirk clearly on his face.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhy do you avoid my gaze?\u201d he asked her, drawing near, \u201cI know you saw me.\u201d he told her.Leah looked around her nervously, not knowing what to say to him in front of the watchful gazes of so many people. This only made Ishakan smirk some more as he gently took a hold of her hand.The nobles nearby had sucked in their breath, some even flinched. Even Count Valtein couldn\u2019t believe this show of disrespect as he held his breath\u2026He dipped his head, bringing up her hand to his mouth and placed a gentle kiss on her pale knuckles.\u201cYou disappoint me, princess.\u201d he spoke, as everyone around them watched with bated breathsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)He moved like a seasoned hunter who had his sights set on his prized prey. He waits and goes in for the kill when they least expect it, just like what Ishakan was doing to Leah now.Ishakan had tied up her hands in a metaphorical sense, and she realized she couldn\u2019t escape him easily.In silent frustration, Leah bit her lip and tried to pull her hand free from his grasp, but he only tightened his grip in response, before finally letting go when he noticed her erratic breathing.He couldn\u2019t help but frown at the sight, and Leah finally breathed out in relief.\u201cI assumed you would be eager to welcome me,\u201d Ishakan continued, \u201cI guess I was wrong.\u201dHe drew closer, stopping just a hairbreadth away from her ear and whispered, \u201cAre you angry, princess?\u201dLeah shot him a sideways glare.\u201cPeople are staring.\u201d She replied firmly in a low voice, reminding him of his promise to treat her justly as a princess when in public, and Ishakan pulled away with a smirk directed at her.Their entire exchange was being watched by everyone within the vicinity. Eagerly anticipating what would happen next as one would with a play. Leah knew she could not afford to lose her cool now. Ishakan was a barbarian, who didn\u2019t know or would care about propriety and manners, so the blame would fall entirely on her shoulders. It would put her in an undesirable position within the court and her people.She tries to think of an appropriate response, and Count Valtein moved to help her, but the sound of trumpets cut off their conversation. Its horns blew in a way that let everyone know that the king had finally entered the fray.When the trumpets cease their sound, the orchestra begins to play a majestic piece as the king marches inside to greet everyone. The nobles too, stop their staring and pay their respects as he passes them by, bowing their heads in a show of reverence and respect, but despite that the tension in the air remained unchanged.Lingering eyes were still on the King of Kurkans and the Princess of Estia.And the king was quick to notice, if the way he narrowed his eyes in disapproval were anything to go by.Just like everyone else, his eyes were drawn to the purple silk sash Ishakan wore in boastful arrogance before looking away. Even Cerdina and Blain had been astonished by his sash, but were trying not to let their amazement show.However, the sash wasn\u2019t really Blain\u2019s focus, but rather the physical closeness between Leah and Ishakan.And if Ishakan noticed his subtle glare, he did not react to it at all. When that proved fruitless, he turned his eyes to Leah, giving her an icy blue stare as if to say, \u201cRemember your place as Estia\u2019s royal princess.\u201dLeah moved silently, quickly putting a distance between her and Ishakan, and followed the other royals of Estia as they found their seats. The other three sat down, but the King of Estia remained standing as he gave a welcome speech to him and their esteemed guests.Blain took it as an opportunity to move closer and gave Leah a warning.\u201cI thought I told you to stop hanging out with those barbarians.\u201d he growled softly, looking like he was paying attention to the king\u2019s speech. Leah had hoped she could ignore him too, but found it rather difficult to do so.\u201cI thought you were smart, sister. What didn\u2019t you understand with that statement?\u201d he continued, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re in love with that barbaric king?\u201d He scoffed as he took a sip of his goblet, \u201cAre you planning to sell out your country after all?\u201d\u201cI did not mean to deal with him.\u201d She quickly rebutted before sighing out in defeat. She had tried to stop herself from being goaded in to respond, but her emotions got the best of her, as she shot him her best glare. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who sought me out, I did nothing.\u201d She made sure to enunciate every word, \u201cAnd I can\u2019t do anything that would jeopardize the treaty.\u201d\u201cOf course, dear sister.\u201d Blain nodded with a sly smile on his lips, but his eyes were steel, as cold as ice. He felt quite triumphant in squeezing a reaction out of her. He silently gestured for her to resume looking out to their guests, and Leah did so gladly.\u201cThen allow me to be your first dance.\u201d Blain offered, still looking ahead, and Leah straightened up in her seat with a haughty look.\u201cApologies, brother,\u201d she said in a mocking tone, \u201cBut I think that right belongs to my fianc\u00e9.\u201dHearing this, Blain chuckled dryly\u2026 \u201cDon\u2019t even think about cheating your way out of this.\u201d he reminded her.She was, by all means, still single, and thus, it was only right that her first dance would be among her family, even in the case of her being engaged. She knew this, but she wanted to keep as much distance between her and Blain as possible, and dancing with Byun Gyongbaek would ensure that.\u201cNow that I think about it, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve seen Byun Gyongbaek.\u201d Leah said as she looked around and Blain hummed in disinterest.\u201cAs to be expected,\u201d he said, \u201cHe\u2019ll be useless once this whole treaty is over and done with. These barbarians, I\u2019m awaiting their departure.\u201d Such remarks only proved to Leah that Blain was still clueless to what she was planning for the treaty.On the other hand, the Kurkans had already begun their move the first step they took into Estia.Under the guise of the treaty, each and every Kurkan had begun stealing the kingdom\u2019s secrets piece by piece, little by little. If this continues on, Estia would be completely defenseless should both the Kurkans, and Byun Gyongbaek choose to abandon the kingdom.And here Blain was, completely confident that the peace treaty will pull through. He never thought that such a possibility would exist, as if certain the peace treaty would go entirely smooth.Even now, Leah was still working hard that nothing else would go wrong, and here Blain was reaping the fruits of her efforts. She clenched her fists tightly in concealed frustration and anger before snapping at him\u2026\u201cIf you want this peace treaty to absolutely to be in our favor, you\u2019d do best to refrain from calling them that demeaning term.\u201d she hissed at him, keeping her face pleasant and graceful for the crowd, \u201cBesides, we don\u2019t know what the outcome will be, so don\u2019t write off Byun Gyongbaek.\u201d she finishes with a huff.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBlain\u2019s eyes narrowed towards her, and for a moment, she was worried he\u2019d openly scold her. Fortunately, the King has finished his speech, as applause resounded, and both prince and princess schooled their features back to a pleasant expression as they applauded with the crowd.With the end of his speech, the banquet has officially begun as their guests began to enjoy the feast. Music and dancing filled in the silence, entertaining them all, and Leah could see some had even managed to ask Kurkans to join them for a dance.Leah could feel someone was still staring at her as she got up to walk around, and despite the many eyes, Leah could immediately spot him even a mile away as he stared at her rather intently. And as much as she was tempted to stare him down, she was determined to not give Blain any more reason to doubt her intentions.Only it wasn\u2019t just Blain who got under her skin, but another, who was now making an appearance before her.\u201cPrincess!\u201d A jovial voice greeted her, heard over from the music and laughter in the hall. Leah held back a groan and paused her steps before turning to greet the man with a bright smile as was expected of her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So full of confidence he was, and Leah could see why.His entire ensemble consists of purple silk, covering him from head to toe. Despite being a rare and expensive clothing, she couldn\u2019t help but feel it was such a waste that Byun Gyongbaek was the one who\u2019s wearing it instead of anyone else.His face was noticeably more flushed so early in the banquet, and the purple color only made him look more ridiculous than he already was.

Leah only laughed half-heartedly as last night\u2019s events flash through her mind.Despite all his guards being decimated, Byun Gyongbaek looked practically unaffected by it. Leah felt slightly sorry for Ishakan having to deal with him.Though if there was anything else that could tell her he was affected by last night, it was with the way he stuck to her like glue, as if to rub it in Ishakan\u2019s face that Leah was his. Last night\u2019s event popped in her mind, and she resists the urge to scowl at the knowledge of prostitutes who looked like her. And then her thoughts turned to the equally treacherous deeds she had done as well.\u201cMay I have the honor to dance with you?\u201d He finally asked her, offering out a hand for her. Despite the desire to sayno, thank you, Leah has no choice but to accept. After all, in the eyes of the public, Leah belonged to him.She took his hand, with expertly concealed distaste, and he surprised her when he removes her hand momentarily and entwines their fingers together. Leah looked down at their conjoined hands.If holding his hand was difficult now, she loathed to think how she\u2019d feel when the dreaded honeymoon would arrive. She let out a sigh.Midway to the end of their dance, the joyful festival music suddenly died down. The chatting stopped soon after, as well as the laughter, and everyone that was already out dancing as a man stood imposingly in front of the engaged couple.Ishakan had been waiting for the perfect moment to ambush them. He waited until they pass through him to make his move and stopped right in front of them, extending his hand out in an expecting manner, daring the princess to deny him.\u201cMay I have at least one song, Princess?\u201d he asked with a charming smirk. It was like hearing a pin drop in the silent room as he asked her for her first dance, taking pleasure in disregarding the etiquette of Estia.Leah knew he was baiting her, but her customs demand to let her first dance be with either her family members or betrothed. He hadn\u2019t even waited for them to even finish when he purposefully stepped in to ask her for one.Leah stared blankly at his offered hand, thinking of the many implications of her every response. Deeming her to take too long in answering, Byun Gyongbaek threw Ishakan a scowl, but schooled his features to one of indifference. Perhaps he was shaken by last night\u2019s events as he cordially greeted Ishakan.\u201cThe King of Kurkans.\u201d He stated and Ishakan\u2019s hawk-like eyes shift to him.Byun Gyongbaek removed his hand from Leah, and wrapped it protectively around her waist, pulling her closer to him in a show of defiance as he looked up at Ishakan.\u201cI apologize, but the princess is my fianc\u00e9.\u201d He pointed out in a civil tone, and Ishakan chuckled dryly before his lips turn to a sneer.***Byun Gyongbaek was delighted with the clear distaste he saw on Ishakan\u2019s expression. It felt like he had just dealt a major blow on the Barbarian King\u2019s pride! It seemed like the King of Kurkans had grown too complacent with the banquet. In a smug tone, Byun continued to rub the salt in the wound\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s customary in Estia, that the princess\u2019 first dance would belong to me.\u201d He said with a smirk, \u201cI do hope you\u2019d understand.\u201d So confident he was, he overlooked a simple fact.This was no ordinary man he was contending with, but the King of Kurkans. And as king, he was civil enough to let him finish goading him in, but he would have the last laugh.\u201cIs that so?\u201d He simply quipped, and Byun Gyongbaek stared at him in confusion, \u201cI thought this whole banquet was supposed to be in our honor?\u201d Ishakan asked, looking around for emphasis, and Byun could feel his blood simmer in frustration.\u201cKing or not, tradition dictates-\u201d he got cut off, when Ishakan stepped forward, cutting off his argument. Ishakan continued to stare him down. The nearby people also watched in rapt attention, waiting for what was going to happen next.\u201cIs this how Estia treats theiresteemedguests?\u201d He asked with a raise of his brow. His tone of voice was low and quiet, but the wind carried it effortlessly.Even the Kurkans paused in their festivities, watching the heated exchange of their king and their host, shooting death glares at Byun Gyongbaek, never mind blinking.Feeling their glares at the back of his head, Byun Gyongbaek could feel the stifling atmosphere that was filling up the space. Other nobles were wise enough to proceed about their activities quietly, wary of their outlandish guests. He could feel the sweat roll down his temples as he attempted to hold his ground.Ishakan turned his attention to Leah\u2026 \u201cPrincess? What have you got to say?\u201d He asked her with a wide smile.Sensing she has been backed into a corner, Leah felt the crowd stare at her, and in resignation, she accepted the dance, placing her hand in his outstretched one. She noted momentarily how warmer than others his hands were to the touch.Gritting his teeth in silent anger, Byun Gyongbaek relinquished his hold on her and stepped back, glaring at them both one last time before walking out in fumes.The crowd parts as Ishakan and Leah moved towards the center of the ballroom, and like watching the moon in the night sky, the figure of Leah\u2019s pale complexion and silvery-white hair, flowing smoothly with every move, in contrast to the King\u2019s dark brown hair and tanned skin, captivated their gazes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven their robes greatly contrasted, yet blended so well, together.As they began to dance gracefully between the crowd, soon, the nearby nobles eventually returned to their businesses as the boisterous and joyful atmosphere returned.Despite being so close physically, as Leah practically hung onto his shoulders as he held onto her waist, the rest of the dance was done in complete silence.But this silence didn\u2019t last long for some of the Kurkans growled at the general direction of the musicians, who, in fear, immediately began playing once more.It was a music only meant for the two of them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, witnessing him move so gracefully with the music, made Leah think otherwise. It was as if he was taught how to dance the dance of Estia beforehand. However, Leah couldn\u2019t stop herself from saying\u2026\u201cIt seems you have a knack in attracting trouble.\u201d she said, finally breaking the silence between them. As they twirled, Leah\u2019s skirt fluttered around her like a flower blooming before falling gracefully around her feet. At this statement, Ishakan frowned at her\u2026\u201cWill you really insist on playing princess when we\u2019re dancing?\u201dShe fought the urge to stomp on his foot. But even if she were to put all that she had on that one mighty stomp, she doubts, with his thick skin, that he would sense she was doing it. It was like underneath his skin was his skeleton made of iron. Seeing his grin at her, Leah couldn\u2019t help but snap at him\u2026\u201cWhy do you even insist on causing me trouble every time?\u201d She asked him incredulously and he only grinned at her all the more.\u201cProbably because it irritates you so much.\u201d he said smugly, and Leah stared at him with a glare.She was still deciding whether or not he meant it or just making fun of her. Sensing she couldn\u2019t get a straight answer, Ishakan fired away once more with a smug grin\u2026\u201cDo you like your fianc\u00e9? Byun Gyongbaek?\u201d He asked with mock curiosity as Leah\u2019s frown only deepened the more he grinned at her.This man,she thinks with irritation, fighting back the growing urge to cause him bodily harm. It was clear now that he was enjoying her predicament.\u201cMy feelings for this matter are irrelevant.\u201d She answered diplomatically, \u201cAs a princess, it is my duty to marry him.\u201d\u201cAh you\u2019re too kind, princess.\u201d he mock-praised her and drew her closer, whispering to her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you should loosen up a little?\u201dLeah would have preferred that he was unable to come to Estia, thus not having him around, alas, reality was not that fortunate. Instead of gracing him with an answer, Leah chose to change the subject instead.\u201cYou dance so well the dance of Estia, how come?\u201d She asked him.\u201cEver since I was young, I\u2019ve had rigorous lessons on what to do on a variety of dances.\u201d He answered truthfully, but Leah watched him with a skeptical eye. She could hardly believe he\u2019d done such a thing since childhood. She couldn\u2019t even imagine what childhood he would have had, let alone actually go through dance lessons with his attitude.\u201cCurious?\u201d he uttered with a grin and held back a snort.\u201cNot one bit.\u201d\u201cSuch an excellent liar.\u201d\u201cPlease leave me alone.\u201d She sighed out in annoyance, careful to keep her cool. She still needed to keep up appearances after all. Ishakan\u2019s eyes narrowed down to her as he watched her lips begin to tremble, \u201cWhy do you always insist-\u201d she says in a choked-up voice before she stopped herself before continuing, and pulled away from him. However, he gripped her tighter, preventing her from doing so.Ishakan drew near once more, and asked her in a whisper\u2026\u201cDo you still wish to die?\u201dAnd without hesitation, Leah firmly replied\u2026\u201cYes.\u201dThe music stopped, and another one started. Leah finally managed to extract herself from Ishakan, and smiled at him gracefully in false pretense\u2026\u201cIt was a pleasure to dance with you, King of Kurkans.\u201d\u201cThe pleasure\u2019s all mine, Princess of Estia.\u201d The, she curtsied before him.\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll go look for my fianc\u00e9. Please relax and enjoy yourself at the banquet.\u201d Without waiting for a reply, Leah turned on her heels and walked away from him, effectively cutting off Ishakan from whatever else he had to say.She felt like she was running away as she walked at a fast pace.She had to leave as soon as she could because there was only one thing she could think of she\u2019ll do if she\u2019d stay any longer. She had a feeling he would offer her his help, and had he done so, she would\u2019ve accepted it.She could feel the stares of the crowd following her from the back of her head as she left. It made her want to disappear, the way their gazes swept over her, like a predator eyeing their prey. She only paused when she finally saw the Countess Melissa a few steps in front of her.\u201cCountess\u2026\u201d She began, but trailed off, and the Countess gave her a soft smile, taking her hand gently, leading her away.\u201cPrincess, perhaps you should rest for a while.\u201d She told Leah, who escorted her to a private resting room. When they were finally in the comfort of the chamber, Leah found herself collapsing on the long sofa nearest to her. Melissa proceeded to busy herself by fetching her a glass of water and helped to prop her up to sit comfortably.Leah could feel her breathing turn ragged, as black spots appeared in her vision, and Melissa moved behind her silently, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder, massaging her gently.\u201cI should loosen your corset.\u201d Melissa told her, but she was stopped.\u201cNo, no need.\u201d Leah interrupted, \u201cI need to go see Byun Gyongbaek.\u201dShe had no doubt she had offended Byun Gyongbaek deeply with her accepting Ishakan\u2019s offer to dance. She needed to appease him now, and avoid any other repercussions. Countess Melissa gave her a pitying look, but Leah only gave her a slight smile.Despite being called a princess, that\u2019s where her privileges stopped. Leah was as powerless as any other person in the castle compared to the other royalties. Despite that, she could almost see her demise, and she couldn\u2019t help but crave it the closer it gets.\u2018Endure it,\u2019 she told herself,\u2018Just a little more.\u2019It will all be over soon.Leah braced herself, and finally stood, but Countess Melissa tried to intercept her.\u201cPrincess, I beg you to reconsider.\u201d Melissa pleads with her, but they were interrupted when someone was already waiting for them outside of the resting room as soon as they stepped out.It was a messenger, a military aid of Byun Gyongbaek.\u201cByung Gyongbaek of Oberde wishes to see Princess Leah. If she could just follow me?\u201d He informed them both, and Melissa looked at her worriedly. Leah comforted with her eyes and her nimble smile before nodding to the man, who swiftly left, and she followed soon after without any word.Leah trailed after him, and found herself standing in a garden, located far away from the banquet hall. It was originally a popular place, decorated with a small outdoor iron table, carved and molded with intricate designs, with matching chairs. Currently, it was empty, save for her fianc\u00e9, who must\u2019ve warded off any people that had dared to come visit the garden and drank his favored dark red liquid.There was one other glass of wine on the table, as if he was anticipating she would seek him out after the dance. The man, who fetched her, gestured for her to proceed, and when she walked past him, he left them alone for their privacy.\u201cByun Gyongbaek-\u201d she began, but he cut her off immediately when he placed his empty wine glass on the table with a clink.When he was certain they were alone, his pleasant demeanor immediately vanished.\u201cHow could you humiliate me? I\u2019m your betrothed!\u201d he spit at her and Leah fought herself not to flinch.He reeked of alcohol as he glared hatefully at her. His eyes daze, and his actions sluggish. He was breathing harshly, as Leah stood frozen. After a few moments, he finally sighed and refilled his glass, picked it up and offered it to her, gesturing to the other glass. \u201cWon\u2019t you drink with me, princess?\u201dLeah looked at the filled cup, and did as she\u2019s told, bringing the cup to her lips and finally taking a sip of the swirling wine as red as blood\u2026 She might\u2019ve not wanted to, but it was a small price to pay for what she\u2019d done in the banquet hall.As she drank the wine, Byun Gyongbaek watched her carefully, drinking his own wine as they both finished their drinks in silence. When she was finally done, Leah placed the glass back down on the table, until a strange feeling overcame her. She frowned in confusion as she stared at the glass\u2026So clean and polished\u2026As if no one had even drunk from it.The strange feeling welled up inside her as alarm bells rang in the back of her mind. Something wasn\u2019t right. Something was wrong\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2026\u201d she spoke blinking back the strange feeling, \u201cI need to go now\u2026\u201dWas she swaying?

Her breath shuddered as she fought to regain control on her body, which was beginning to turn sluggish\u2026\u201cDrugs..? What\u2026 do you\u2026 mean?\u201dAs much as she wished he was only teasing her, and to laugh it off with a statement he was way too drunk so early in the day, she knew the truth wasn\u2019t so kind. Was there no end to the trouble that would come at her today?Byun Gyongbaek chuckled dryly at her question, \u201cAh, pretending to be naive, I see,\u201d he hummed as his fingers grasped her chin roughly. Despite the pain his touch gave her, Leah couldn\u2019t bring herself to even scream.Her entire body, including her tongue, grew heavy, as if she was filled with lead. Her limbs refused to cooperate\u2026\u201cI\u2019ve treated you nicely because of your status as a princess,\u201d he sneered, \u201cAnd yet you repay me by acting like a bitch.\u201d He shook her chin roughly in his anger, \u201cI witness you lose your mind at the sight of that savage, how could I be sure you\u2019ve remained untouched?\u201d he whispered.He licked his lips, stared at her as he held a smug look before he leaned closer to whisper by her ear\u2026\u201cIt seems I\u2019ll have to see for myself,\u201d and cold dread filled Leah as she struggled to move. She watched as he brought his hand up to caress her neck, trailing down his fingers, and grabbed the neckline of her dress, and had begun to tug it down.She squeezed her eyes shut in her helplessness. She\u2019d never felt so stupid. She wanted to push him away, get away from as much as possible, but all she could do was shake beneath his touches. She choked back a sob, unable to call for help.She felt her dress loosen up, saw the ribbon tying it together fall onto the floor. She felt him draw closer, his hot breath hit her bare skin as she shivered in disgust.She then saw her vision go dark.In the recesses of her mind, she could hear drunken laughters, fading in and out around her. It gave him pause to what he had planned doing to her, as he looked back to see the source of the noise.It was at that moment, that Leah had begun to regain movement. Using all her strength, she gave a mighty stomp on his foot, dug her heel with so much pressure, Byun Gyongbaek removed himself from her with a yelp and stumbled back onto a heap on the floor.\u201cYou bitch!\u201d He hissed at her.Leah wasted not a second longer, gathered all her clothes close to her chest, and ran. Byun Gyongbaek yelled profanities after her, as he scrambled to get up on his feet to follow.She winced at the sensation of the wayward branches as they brushed and scratched her delicate skin. Somewhere during running, she lost her shoes, and now her feet ached as if she was walking on a floor pinned with nails. She tripped on her saggy socks, and quickly got back up heading towards the banquet hall.She looked around frantically, hearing hushed exclamations and hid. She chanced a look, before she ducked back out of sigh and muffled her breathing as she clasped her hand around her mouth. The shrubs concealed her perfectly, and when she peaked through the leaves, she saw Byun Gyongbaek\u2019s servants looking for her.It was fortunate they gave up searching the place before they found her, and quickly left to look at the other areas. Leah sagged her shoulders in relief, before she took calming breaths and looked around.The garden was like a maze. It\u2019s shrubs were expertly placed to increase its aesthetic, and the trees and bushes framed it perfectly, providing shade upon its visitors, even giving lovers their sought privacy. When she had regained her strength, Leah steadily stood up from her hiding place, gave her surroundings one last once over, and darted into the shelter of the garden.Her arms and legs hurt, and despite her wish to sit down and rest, she couldn\u2019t. Escaping from Byun Gyongbaek was paramount.However, every twist and turn she took was a dead end. With no way to leave, she was soon overcome by a sensation as if she was the prey, hunted down for sport.She could see how this would end now. Byun Gyongbaek\u2019s servants would capture her, and be brought to him. Her family wouldn\u2019t even be able to do anything about it despite how unnoble his intentions would be. And the aristocrats, they would just step aside and spread rumours, telling her what a pity her situation was and make excuses.No one would protect her. No one would be able to help her.She figured if she had to give up her body, she would at least have a choice in that matter. Not like this. She didn\u2019t want to give into Byun Gyongbaek like this.\u201cWait! I see her!\u201dA shout alerted her that someone was coming, \u201cShe\u2019s that way!\u201dSomething cool and sweet wafted into her nose as she resumed running away, squeezing every bit of strength remaining in her and towards her legs. With her mind telling her to go towards the smell, she followed her nose, and hoped it would lead her to sweet relief.She bursted out of the trees as she bulldozed her way through the shrubs and saw the clouds turn dark as the moon peaked out and shone down on her. But the night sky only multiplied the feeling of being trapped.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe air around her went thin as she felt the shortness of her breath.Then, as if a burst of fresh air, she saw a man, leaned casually against the tree, smoking a cigarette as the smoke wafted all over him.

His warm hands wrapped around her protectively as he patted down her mess of a hair, and she finally looked up and pulled away.She was safe.\u201cI-Ishakan,\u201d she choked back as the tears fell unabashedly once more.

When she finally calmed down enough, she looked up at him, and he stared right back at her in silence.\u201cLeah! Oh Leah!\u201d Byun Gyongbaek\u2019s voice rang throughout the dead of the night. He called her name out in a sing-song voice, and shivers ran up her spine as she heard it. He cackled loudly as he slowly inched towards their location.Ishakan felt the way she began to tremble once more, and that alone was enough to give him an idea on what had transpired. He clenched his jaw, and gritted his teeth. Gently, he unwrapped his arms around her, unclasping his cloak and wrapped it around her small frame.Leah\u2019s fingers immediately grabbed the purple silk, hugged it tightly around herself.\u201cTell me,\u201d he said softly, but sternly as he met her gaze, \u201cShould I dispose of him?\u201d he asked coolly, telling her silently he would happily do so too.Her sight was still hazed, but she could see the golden glint of his eye rather clearly. He was still waiting for her to answer. As much as she wanted to say yes\u2026Leah shook her head in negation. At her answer, Ishakan closed his eyes, and breathed deeply before he opened them and looked at her, his golden eyes glinting dangerously. His lips were pressed to a thin line before placing her gently behind him as he turned to where Byun Gyongbaek was going to enter from.\u201cStay here,\u201d he told her in a low voice and moved, but something held him back. It was Leah. Despite her difficulty to speak, Leah continued despite her dry throat and quiet voice\u2026\u201cYou\u2026\u201d she gulped to wet her throat, \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2026\u201dHecan\u2019tkillByunGyongbaek,hemustn\u2019t.Ishakan\u2019s face morphed into a scowl the more she tried to dissuade him from doing so.And for the first time since they\u2019ve met, he found himself raising his voice at her.\u201cEven at this moment, you\u2019re still concerned about the royal family?!\u201d he exclaimed at her in a fury. His pupils narrowed at her, making Leah feel his genuine anger at her decision. \u201cEven kindness has its limits, my lady.\u201d He seethed at her, but Leah would not be intimidated. She mustn\u2019t back down from this.\u201cNot\u2026 the royal family,\u201d She answered as she tried to find her voice, \u201cBut of Estia. I can\u2019t let\u2026 the innocents suffer\u2026\u201d She finished softly.Despite his horrendous personality, Byun Gyongbaek had helped Estia in great significance when he not only blocked the Kurkans, but also kept them in check on the western borders. His life was tied to many innocents.Unlike hers, where none would be affected. Her death wouldn\u2019t bring about a change.\u201cI just\u2026 want to get away from here.\u201d She continued, as Ishakan watched her in silence, telling her he was listening. \u201cPlease, I beg of you\u2026\u201d Her grip tightened on his arm.Ishakan was breathing deeply. His chest heaved up and down in thought, before his breathing returned to normal. He cursed silently under his breath in Kurkan language, brought a hand up and rubbed his eyes. After a moment of silence, he finally spoke\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re testing the patience of a Kurkan,\u201d he warned her. She wanted to apologize to him, for all her troubles. But as soon as she opened her mouth, no voice had come, only a puff of breath. Her body seized up, her grip loosened as she hunched over with a light groan.All strength had gone from her body as she fell.Something was strange. The heat began to grow. She felt hotter by the second, as she began to heave for air. Her initial thought was that the adrenaline died down from all the running, and her fatigue had returned with full force\u2026But it kept getting worse\u2026\u201cYou!\u201d Ishakan lightly cursed as he crouched down. He felt her body temperature rise and admonished himself for not realizing something was wrong with her.At his cool touch, Leah let out a groan. Despite his normal body temperature running higher than hers, this was no normal situation, and his body was now cooler compared to hers.\u201cWhat did you eat?\u201d She heard him ask, and the wine glass flashed to her mind\u2026She remembered how clean the glass was after she drank from it. How smoothly it had gone down her throat than what she had been expecting. She remembered her fianc\u00e9\u2019s words as he told her he\u2019d keep her company until the drug wore off\u2026\u201cByun\u2026 the wine\u2026\u201d She whispered, she was beginning to see black spots\u2026\u201cCome here.\u201d Ishakan\u2019s voice whispered back in concern as he grabbed her by the waist, positioning his arm so that she rested against his chest. He grabbed her chin with his other hand, and tilted it up until she met his lips.He prodded her mouth open, before she felt something slide from his mouth to hers.It was as if she was shocked by something electric. She clung onto him, not even able to think about pushing him away as her mind grew hazy.As his tongue darted inside, he tasted the remains of the wine in her mouth and frowned. Slowly he broke away from her and looked at her complexion.\u201cHe met with Dormaris the other day, you remember?\u201d he asked her, and Leah nodded as she remembered him mingling with the gypsies. Ishakan let out a sigh. \u201cHe bought some love potion from them,\u201d he told her, and Leah\u2019s heart sank\u2026Did this mean she\u2019d fall in love with him?!

It\u2019s actually a cheap aphrodisiac.

Everything turned hotter, like a fireball was churning her stomach. She felt as though she was boiling. Her vision started to blurry the more she tried to keep awake and blinked her eyes to keep her head on straight.

Like a cotton doll, weighed down by water, Leah collapsed into Ishakan\u2019s arms.Ishakan looked down at her and dipped his head. \u201cChoose. What do you want to do now?\u201d He asked.A hot breath came out as soon as she opened her mouth. The clarity of her mind left her piece by piece, as the fever grew. Her original thoughts slowly disappeared into an abyss as her reason was replaced with honest desire.Leah lifted her eyelashes and blinked silently. Her hand slightly trembled as she reached out and carefully grasped the hem of his clothes.That alone was enough of an answer. Ishakan hugged Leah close to him and silently walked across the garden. Byun Gyeong-baek\u2019s servants were just around the corner, his rage could easily be heard.\u201cGet out here right now! You think you can hide?\u201d He screamed in anger.\u201cI\u2019ll go easy on you if you come out now\u2026!\u201dHowever, in the safety of the man holding her, Leah was not the slightest bit afraid. It was as if the noises that were directed at her were from another world. She felt like she was listening from inside a dream, the screams were faint and scattered from one ear to the other. This place was safe. The man holding her was protecting her inside her dream, and Leah leant a little more against him.Ishakan stopped for a moment and glanced at Leah, then threw his eyes towards the side where Byun was shouting. With his eyes, he gestured above them, a smirk forming on his face. Leah heard the leaves rustle above their heads.She was curious and wanted to look at what it was, but her head hung heavy. With the potion in her veins, she couldn\u2019t keep her body steady enough, the fever only adding up. Leah quietly wriggled uncomfortably.Her lower body felt numb, adding on to the burning sensation she had felt since a while ago. A ticklish sensation was constantly rushing into her, unable to get rid of the irksome feeling, she writhed in pain, trying to find a release. Leah continuously gasped and twisted her thighs around. She felt like she was going to die if she didn\u2019t get this heat out now.Ishakan looked down at her and clicked his tongue.\u201cHold on. Otherwise we\u2019ll end up doing it in front of your fianc\u00e9s men\u2019.\u201dHe nipped at Leah\u2019s blushing neck.\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201dThe meaning behind the words that left her mouth, were not empty. Ishakan laughed. He definitely was capable of fulfilling her wish easily.Leah shook her dizzy head in a hurry. A small chuckle rolled out from his mouth. He kissed Leah on the forehead and started moving again.She completely entrusted her body to him. The surrounding quickly shifted, every time she closed then opened her eyes. After a while, the violent screams of Byun could no longer be heard. Nor did the music from the banquet hall echo around her. She could hear no sounds of the like. Only the peaceful quiet noises of the cicadas in the grass, and the songs of the night birds rang in the air.When she closed her eyes once again, Leah found herself in an unfamiliar place.The aroma of fresh flowers permeated the air; smooth and thick, like cream. The flowers that were about to bloom were dyed pink, and those that had blossomed were fluttering with the wind. Their white petals dancing in the breeze.The splendid sight of the tuberoses under the moonlight was unbelievably beautiful. In Estia, she had lived her entire life in, and seen the glamorous places around the palace. However, this place was a place she had never known about. It was so strange and unfamiliar that it felt like a dream.Ishakan delicately placed Leah down on the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s a good place to smoke and the flowers are pretty.\u201d He muttered.When he said it like that, Leah inside her mind, felt warm. His voice, that said he came here because the flowers were pretty, tickled her ear. Leah also liked the fresh and subtle scent of tuberoses. She had even once asked the gardener to plant more of them in the royal garden.For some reason, the tuberoses in this corner of the palace, which spotted the area unarranged, were more beautiful than the tuberoses that the gardener would meticulously cultivate with all his heart and soul in the royal garden. She felt like she was going to become intoxicated on the smell of the flowers all over this place.Ishakan took off his coat. The long line of intricate buttons on his clothes all burst off with one move from his hand. The Jewel encrusted buttons scattered over the flower bed, twinkling like stars.The precious clothes that a certain craftsman must have dedicated long hours towards and curated with so much effort, now lay on crumpled on the ground. The clothes would probably get stained by the grass, but he showed no concern for that. He laid it on the ground like a rag for Leah and set her down. His hands quickly rolled up the skirt of her dress exposing her bare white legs.\u201c\u2026.\u201dHe furrowed his brows together. Ishakan carefully wrapped his hands around Leah\u2019s ankles. Her socks were in tatters, torn and stained with dirt and blood. He sighed and fiddled with her calves.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou should have at least told me to cut off his legs.\u201dThere was a chaotic mix of emotions in his eyes as he muttered unintelligibly. Ishakan raised his eyebrows. With a somewhat angry expression, he lifted her dress up to her thigh.\u201cI\u2019ll become the most patient Kurkan in the world, thanks to you.\u201d He declared before pulling peeling her skirt up and giving her the hem of the dress.\u201cHold it.\u201dLeah did as she was told and held on to the dress with both her hands. The cool breeze caressed her hot skin. It suddenly dawned on her\u2014the reality that she was going to have int*rcourse outside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leah would sometimes go out to enjoy the night breeze, and there were many times where she would have to quickly turn away after hearing a passionate cry.\u201cThere are already a lot of people doing this around here. So, we won\u2019t even stand out.\u201d Had he just guessed what she was thinking?Aside from being caught by someone, it was even more shocking to her that she was doing something like this. Because, this is, really\u2026\u201cWhy, because this is what beasts do? Is that what it says in Estia\u2019s court etiquette? I guess that\u2019s not far from the truth since you are doing it with an animal right now.\u201dLeah opened and closed her lips with hazy eyes. How did he know? It felt like Ishakan could read all her inner thoughts.\u201cI didn\u2019t read it. You are talking right now. Looks like you are completely gone.\u201dHe bit her fluttering lips lightly.\u201cLooks like the potion is quite strong\u2026.\u201dIshakan\u2019s hand caressed her calves for a long time and grabbed her thigh. His sleek fingers gripped her thighs so hard it felt like it would pop. She was sure that it should be painful but strangely it was closer to pleasure than pain. The inside of her thighs trembled with a strange excitement. It was so itchy that her body couldn\u2019t handle it. She gulped and stared at the man in front of her.She knew the pleasure he would bring her. Her waist shook instinctively, as soon as she imagined how it would feel to have his long fingers deep inside her and stir her around. Leah trembled and shook little by little, she spread her legs a little without even realizing.Ishakan, who was still watching her silently, let out a chuckle.\u201cYou think that\u2019s enough? Spread it wider.\u201dHer mind kept growing impatient. It was so itchy inside that she was going crazy. She opened her legs wide hoping he would touch her quickly, and as soon as she did, he kissed her above her knees and praised her.\u201cThere. Good job.\u201dHis eyes reached the deepest point between her legs. His blunt, explicit gaze felt almost tangible. She curled her toes, not able to bear the anticipation. Her nervousness rose.Unknown to Leah, her lower body was already soaked. Her face turned red as she realized how moist her nether region was. The blushing Leah felt like at any moment, she could burst. Leah bit her lips and whispered.\u201cI, Ishakan, I, I feel so strange\u2026\u201dHis eyes that were looking down lifted back up. The golden color of his pupils deepened. Ishakan laid Leah back.\u201cWhat feels strange?\u201d The mischievous man knowingly asked.\u201cUhh, haaa\u2026.\u201dShe closed her eyes and swallowed a moan. Her body was stimulated and irritated even by the slightest touch of the soft clothes on her skin. Her insides convulsed and she felt herself dripping down below. The hot liquid leaked down her thighs. If this went on, Leah felt like she really was going to die. Her next words came out like a sob.\u201cUnderneath\u2026 It feels weird below\u2026\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s wet\u2026and water keeps coming out\u2026\u201dHe tore off her underwear. A piece of the stained cloth fell on top of white tuberose. Ishakan firmly pressed Leah\u2019s thigh with both hands, so that she couldn\u2019t move and put his head in between.\u201cIt\u2019s overflowing.\u201dShe suddenly felt concerned. Hearing him describing her wet state as if she was a broken dam made her worried. Her body might have been messed; due to her the unfamiliar drug she had taken. Ishakan chuckled lightly.\u201cDo you want me to stop it?\u201dShe wasn\u2019t sure if she nodded or begged him to do it. Ishakan slowly brought his head lower and lower while she tried to regain her dim consciousness. She could feel his hot breath pour over her underneath. Leah opened her eyes wide and cried.\u201c\u2026Uck!\u201dA moving lump of tender flesh licked her below, where it was iron-hot. He stiffened his tongue and licked her. It was as if his probing tongue wanted to taste an appetizer first, and then sucked on her hot bump. Her body curled up at the soft sensation that rubbed on her body.Leah\u2019s thighs were frantically trying to bounce up, but they wouldn\u2019t move an inch because of his hands firmly pressing down on them. Beneath the attack of his tongue and the wet sounds of his saliva and her juices mixing, her panting was audible.\u201cAh, ah. N, no\u2026 Stop\u2026\u201dThe sensation was beyond her limit. The delirious feeling, he aroused within her was almost to the point of pain. She teared up, unable to withstand it. However, Ishakan didn\u2019t stop. His relentless, unforgiving attack continued as he dug even farther into her.His middle finger slid over the smooth texture of her petals, then opened her up and dug in slowly. He didn\u2019t forget to lick the swollen stiff bump as he inserted his finger.The squelches of the liquid sloshing inside came out as he bent the inserted finger at a slight angle and slowly moved it around several times. Her wet inner walls clung to his fingers, as if to signify that they had been waiting for it.\u201cHeuk, ha\u2026N, no, take your fingers out please\u2026!\u201d\u201cAre you having a hard time with just one finger?\u201dIshakan sucked below. The smacking of a wet noise as his lips suctioned her cave could be heard. He grinned satisfyingly.\u201cI need to put in something bigger, so I have to widen you up.\u201dIshakan\u2019s fingers moved short and fast. With only a thin mucous membrane separating them, his soft tongue constantly licked and sucked on top, and his hard fingers poked roughly below. Leah saw an illusion of lightning raining down in front of her eyes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHer exposed skin was so hot that it was glowing. She couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. Leah, close to tears, called out to Ishakan.\u201cI-Ishakan\u2026 Ah, ahh!\u201dHe stuck his finger deep inside. Her head turned back and a scream like moan broke out. Her flattened lower belly convulsed.The climax was long, and so strong that it made her mind go white. The sensation that furiously hit her body did not die down easily. The inside of her body convulsed and spurted out juices. A sticky thread dragged out as he slowly pulled out his finger from her soaking hole. Ishakan licked his finger and laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The erotic words, out of embarrassment, would have made her unpleasantly quiver. However, Leah currently could not muster any reaction. At this very moment, she was wooden.It felt as if the overwhelming amount of pleasure from Ishakan\u2019s intense attack had numbed her brain, turning it into a mushed pudding. In her weakened state, she was only capable of powerlessly grasping the hem of her dress with her trembling hands.Crimson palm prints adorned her pale, powerless thighs. Ishakan, still unsated, sucked her flesh hard between his lips, leaving just another glaring mark.The act was so wild, that looking down, the inside of her thighs could be seen dotted with his traces. It was a clear meaning.You are mine.Exhausted and completely powerless, Leah suddenly flinched back. Whilst being ravished by him, her eye accidentally caught sight ofit.The barbaric king took hold of what he had just taken out of the waistline of his trousers.With such a monstrosity she\u2019d seen, even in her drug-induced, hazy state, she felt uneasy, thinking that it would be too much for her to accommodate\u2014unbearable even.His thick member had bulging blood vessels the shade of a deep, rich wine. In its engorged state, the fresh blood rushing to the end visibly pulsed. To say the raw size of the gen*tal*a, was as large as the head of a young beast, was not an exaggeration.Ishakan\u2019s fingers rubbed her petals and tapped the head of his thick length against her entrance. The act, bringing them closer together, made her heart race.With the drug in her veins, she found it hard to speak\u2014her speech distorted, her words slurred without her control. Nonetheless, she fought against the weight of her tongue.\u201cIt\u2019s too big\u2026It, It won\u2019t fit\u2026\u201d Words escaped from her lips in a stutter.Ishakan\u2019s chuckle, which sounded distant, grazed her ears. \u201cIt fit last time. Have you forgotten already?\u201dIn contrary to what he had just said, there was no way she could forget their heated encounter. How could she? It had been the most shocking experience of Leah\u2019s life. However, seeing her unresponsive expression, Ishakan concluded by himself that she had, indeed, forgotten.A low grumble came out his throat, and he laughed mischievously. \u201cI\u2019ll have to put it in often then, so you won\u2019t forget.\u201dBefore Leah could utter anything in response, Ishakan pushed himself inside her. She couldn\u2019t help but cry out, as soon as his thick member went in\u2014the immense pleasure and the inevitable pain that came with it, was overwhelming.His shaft was not something her body could easily accommodate. Even though he had diligently loosened her up with his fingers, her lower part squeezed him tightly, a feeble attempt to push back the foreign object.Her stomach felt full to the brim, that a slight bulge could be seen. Her tears mixed with saliva trailed down her chin.It was then that he started to move his waist back and forth a bit, then he gripped Leah\u2019s waist tightly and rammed in, pushing the rest of him inside her in one motion mercilessly. His rod, which plunged into her without notice, suddenly hit her innermost part.This time, she couldn\u2019t even scream. Leah could only tremble and manage to let out short gasps and cries. Her wet and sticky insides, convulsed, chewing at the large intruder.\u201cF*ck, Leah\u2026\u201d A guttural moan came from Ishakan.His adam\u2019s apple bobbed, and a seething voice spouted out shakingly.\u201cUgh\u2026you\u2019re clenching so hard\u2026\u201dLeah\u2019s feet that had floundered helplessly through the air had almost touched the ground. Ishakan grabbed her ankles and lifted it up.\u201cBe careful with your feet.\u201dIt was only then did she remember that she had wounds on the soles of her feet. Their union had made her delirious. She had been too drunk on the excitement to feel the pain. Ishakan perched Leah\u2019s leg on the expanse of his shoulder. As her hips were lifted, her waist bent back allowing her dress to flow down freely, revealing her skin even more.Ishakan frowned, maybe it was because the dress was too cumbersome, that even when he held it down with his hands, it still got in the way. He wasn\u2019t patient enough to finely untie each of the complicated ribbons and knots on her dress. He needed to strip it off completely in the fastest way possible.The veins on his hands showed how tense he was to rid the bothersome clothing. His fingers hooked onto the soft silk and organza, and with little effort, completely tore her dress off of her.A flash of worry crossed her mind at the ripping sound of cloth. However, that worry was short lived as it faded away as fast as it came. Ishakan held her by the back of her thighs, lifting it. Her legs dangled in the air as her body bent over.The muscles firmly squeezed with power. She thought he was going to relent, when suddenly, he pressed his full weight in one sharp movement. From above, he began to pound on her ruthlessly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe fast, heavy motions as his length moved in and out of her, drilled her down to the earth. Leah opened her eyes wide and tears welled down her face at his ferocious attack.Her body was no longer hers. In sync with him, she rocked his fast rhythm, the weight-bearing tip of his sword was piercing through her belly. She couldn\u2019t breathe and her eyes blinked in frenzy.\u201cAh! Ah!\u2026\u201dHer heated body foolishly took him. Leah laid there convulsing, shaken to the point she was unable to move even an inch. Her loud groans that constantly rang out were music to Ishakan\u2019s ears.He pushed Leah so far to the edge that she was given no room to think about holding back her scandalous moans, even though they were outside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She felt like she was going to go insane whenever he moved. Every spot was stimulated by him. The pleasantness that followed cascaded onto her; a rushing waterfall as he missed not a single spot.Continuing on his raucous attack, Ishakan grasped her swollen chest. His calloused fingers glazed over her porcelain skin and pinched. The twin peaks conformed to the shape of his hands, their erect mounds inviting Ishakan to touch them. Taking note of Leah\u2019s state, a cunning idea formed. He rubbed them hard, simultaneously, his hips rocked faster. The lower engorged region pumped into where he and Leah became one, whilst his fingers assaulted her above.\u201cAhhhhh, ugh!\u201dHer lower abdomen tightened along with the thrilling sensation. She felt something burst in her lower belly and her inner walls convulsed. The result, a rush of body fluid drenching where they were connected.Ishakan\u2019s shaft plunged into the deepest part of her body. The incessant rhythm of their bodies colliding, proved Ishakan\u2019s desire to meld them together. Ishakan let go of her chest, only to reach behind her and hold her buttocks, hugging her tighter to him. There were no longer any visible gaps between them. Leah\u2019s belly and chest were pressed right against his muscled body. She frantically moaned and cried. The thing inside her pulsed and grew, and Ishakan uttered a deep groan.Something warm endlessly poured out and his s*men filled her up, the head of his shaft twitching against her cerv*x. Leah let her hands and feet hang. Ishakan, relished the moment. His mind was in pure bliss, his lower region, still inside her, leisurely moved. Ishakan looked down at where they were connected.The mixture of body fluids and s*men made it look like a mess. The fluids clinging to her stood out even more, as Leah, who had no pubic hair, was smooth.Looking at the red and swollen cl*t, Ishakan let out a sneaky laugh. He flicked it causing her to moan, and slightly regain her consciousness. She tried to push his agitating hand away that had begun to arouse her again.\u201cAh\u2026hee\u2026N-no\u2026\u201dHowever, She regretted that right away. Ishakan took his hand away, then grabbed her waist instead. He then proceeded to sit on the floor and sat Leah on top of her.His member, which was still inside her, changed its position and pushed back deeper inside, kissing her cervix. It had no problems reaching the deepest parts of her, even though it was limp as it was still so big.Leah, who was still sobbing due to the aftermath of her climax, was startled. Ishakan supported Leah\u2019s waist so she wouldn\u2019t fall backwards, and pulled her in with his hand on the back of her neck.\u201cI\u2019ll massage your chest. Come here.\u201dHis fingers pinched her n*pples. He licked Leah\u2019s whimpering face, as he gently rubbed her engorged twin peaks with his thumb and index finger. He wet his lips with saliva and licked her. His tongue moved on to her cheeks that were wet with tears, and then finally not forgetting her earlobes, which had turned bright red. He bit and sucked on them too.Her white mounds were caught in Ishakan\u2019s grasp. He sucked and bit on one side, and he repeatedly patted and gently twisted the other with his fingers.Leah wriggled her waist and grabbed his forearm tight. Her nails clawed at his arm, yet, it was hard to scratch his hard skin.She felt his sword that was inside her regain its strength and get hard again, as she wriggled and twisted her body around not being able to stand the ticklish sensation. His lower body slowly started to regain it\u2019s previous vigor.She felt both dread and anticipation, when she thought about him doing it to her again. In contradiction to herself, Leah stared at Ishakan, wanting him to touch and rub her more. She saw mirth spread in his eyes.\u201cYou want me to hammer you?\u201dShe hesitated then nodded. Her heart swelled at that moment, and she arched her back. Ishakan leaned back, and smirked. His hand let go of his attack and he slid his hand to the front of her belly, where a part of him protruded. Putting up an act of annoyance, he shook his head. Leah twisted her body and licked him, despite his act.\u201cWhat do I do with you liking it so much? I can\u2019t put it in you all day.\u201dHe clutched her chest, a mischievous expression on his face. \u201cAh, I should at least get a similar toy and send it to the palace.\u201dLeah bit her lips tight. She despised him for constantly saying vulgar things to her. Her eyes welled up with tears of sorrow. Her feverish brain was unable to filter out her thoughts and let them slip from her mouth as it was.\u201cWhy\u2026why do you keep saying those things\u2026\u201dLeah let out a whimper.

He looked at Leah blankly for a moment, and then muttered quietly.\u201c\u2026alright.\u201dIt was a gentle and tender answer. Leah looked at his serene eyes. Akin to a honey, it was sweet and enchanting. In that moment, those orbs gazing back at her were void of any sign of sharpness and fierceness.The wind fluttered around them, carrying with it the heavy scent of flowers. The pleasant fragrance soon filled her nostrils. All the sweetness combined, and the aroma that she inhaled, caused her heart to throb. It was too much, did she deserve this?

The thin strands of dark brown hair loosened under her touch. A tingling sensation coursed through his body.She quickly brought her lips to his. It was a light, delicate peck\u2014like a brush of a feather against his moist ones\u2026 inciting a desire for more.Ishakan gently smacked his lips recalling the kiss, and laughed when she accidentally kissed him on the corner of his mouth.He wrapped his hand around the back of her head and pulled her head closer. Any gap between them was gone as they delved into a wild kiss. Surprised, she tried to pull back, but as if he\u2019d anticipated her reaction, he held her firmly- keeping her from moving.\u201cMmm\u2026\u201dA small moan escaped her mouth.

Leah\u2019s titillating face was enough to impel him into action.\u201cHnnn, ah, Ishakan\u2026\u201dThe only person she could hang on to amid the burning rapture, was the man inciting it. She cried out his name, bit hard on his shoulder hard leaving marks on this copper skin, as she rode the wave of pleasure.\u201cAhh, ughh\u2026\u201dIshakan, unlike his frenzied hands exploring her curves and peaks, only moved his lower body slightly. It was as if he was constraining himself, trying not to \u00a0scare her. Albeit, it had the opposite effect \u2013 his slight thrusts drove her crazy.A part of her hoped he would just take her without any restraint. She wanted him to torment every inch of her, and quelch her flaming desire\u2013 once and for all. If in that moment, Ishakan\u2019s heat melted her to the ground, she wouldn\u2019t mind.He wanted to torment every inch of her too, savour in their burning lust and finish her off. Leah\u2019s bosom shuddered, she leapt onto his core and enveloped him in her arms.Ishakan leaned back, sitting her atop his stomach, to prevent the clinging Leah from using her feet. The clothes scattered on the floor had long tuned to a crumpled mess due to their violent union.He fell on the bed of roses as his body leaned back.Ishakan looked like a painting, as he laid there buried in the disheveled white tuberose that contrasted with his deep, dark skin. Leah took a brief glance at his face and quickly sprung onto him. She hugged his nape with both arms and pressed her face against his. It was almost as if she wanted to ingrain herself into him \u2013 the very loss of touch; of intimacy, was unbearable. Her lips glided across his sharp jawline and she kissed his chiseled chin.Her frantic pecks inaccurately tried to find his lips. An onslaught of small quick kisses ensued. Alas, she finally found his lips and pushed her tongue in. What he had done earlier, his actions had impressed on her mind. She clumsily tried to replicate his moves.The man empathized, he reciprocated by deftly maneuvering his tongue and entwining them.\u201cHa-huh\u2026\u201dThe ecstasy of kissing him, whilst his large meat was inside her made her delirious. She instinctively tightened her thighs, sneakily rubbing her cl*t between her stiff legs on his smooth abs. However, she felt like he\u2019d already noticed, as she was soaked underneath.Leah sobbed and whined at him.\u201cIt\u2019s so itchy inside\u2026\u201dHe looked at the red and crying Leah clutching him, and sighed.\u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy.He nipped at the tip of her nose.\u201cDo you know what your face looks like right now? Do you know how se*y it is?\u201dHe looked at Leah, who couldn\u2019t answer properly. He sighed in defeat and slowly murmured.\u201cIs it my good fortune that I decided to smoke today? Just thinking of how you might have shown such a face to that bastard Byun Gyeongbaek makes me\u2026.\u201dHe didn\u2019t say the rest. However, he put more strength in his grip on her. After a moment of silence, his cold voice sounded.\u201cI should have killed him.\u201dHe immediately started to move her waist upwards. Because of her position on his stomach, his shaft dug deeper than before. The tip poked where it should never come in.She panted incessantly and rubbed her face against his chest. After a point, she could no longer take it. Her cries of protest fell on deaf ears, she tried to get off his stomach.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAh, it\u2019s too deep, Ugh\u2026!\u201dIshakan steadied her with his grip and pressed hard on her back. Leah crushed securely against him, having no choice but to lie flat down again.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dIshakan firmly grasped her bottom with both hands. The plump mounds, molded between his fingers, small bumps of her skin peeked out from beneath. He\u2019s unable to control strength, he was invigorated.In the next instance, he rammed his thick member inside her, pen*tr*t*ng so hard, that thudding sounds could be hard from the point of contact. Her body shook as he bounced her up and down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sound of slapping bodies and heavy breathing intensified. Her eyes glistened with tears, she could faintly glimpse the fluttering moonlight as she threw her head back. She dug her fingernails deep into his back, unrestrained. Her mind went blank, an incredible, indescribable pleasure swept her senses.\u201cHick, haaaang!\u201dLeah let out seductive sobs and arched her hips. She climaxed, her nectar trickling down. She looked especially frail and sensual in the afterglow.Then, a chill ran down her spine, her hands and feet wouldn\u2019t stop trembling.His grasp tightened, he did not stop. Instead, he pushed his still invigorated rod, deeper. He sucked the saliva dribbling down her open lips, nibbling her cheek as he did so.\u201cI\u2019ll fill you up till you\u2019re full today!\u201d He declared.***How many times did they do it?Leah had lost all semblance of reality, she could no longer tell where she ended and Ishakan began. After the second time, her memory blurred. All that remained was a faint recollection of their frenzied union; their last sliver of reserve had long escaped its shackles as Ishakan took her like a beast.The last she remembered was her delirious scream; cries of ecstatic pleasure. It seemed like she had fainted after that. She hadn\u2019t eaten properly in order to prepare for the banquet, so it was only natural that her body could not handle it, after she engaged in such fierce lovemaking.Leah forced her leaden eyelids to open. She desperately needed to moisten her parched throat.Water, I need water.\u201c\u2026\u201dA long piece of fluttering cloth caught her eye. It was a curtain, embroidered with elaborate patterns, freely flittering with the wind. Her consciousness slowly returned to her, she began to notice her surroundings. Her eyes stared vacantly, as if studying the intricate patterns on the curtains.Leah found herself in a quiet dark room. A haze of smoke placed a filter, the silence so intense that even the inaudible whirlwind of dust could be heard.Peeking through the window, silver light from the perfectly rounded moon shone through. A world of stars painted the sky, allowing her to see a prism of small, glittering gems, that dotted the sky through the clear glass panes.It was surreal. Leah felt someone touching her hair. Her eyelids fluttered continuously, trying to comprehend whether she was still in a dream, or this trance was a reality. The warmth that playfully touched and gently combed through her hair was reassuring.After a while of feeling the touch, she realized that she was lying on a bed. Her head was resting against a warm, firm mound \u2013 to be precise, she was using a taut thigh as a pillow.The man, leaning against the bedside, was relaxedly smoking. With a cigarette between his index and middle finger, he had one limb raised at a ninety degree angle and the other laid out for her.He took a deep drag and exhaled. The hazy smoke that followed his long breath, scattered in the dawn air. The cool, yet sweet scent, slowly wafted through the room.Leah, who had been staring at him for a long time, wriggled her body. She no longer had the energy to get up herself. So, she only managed to slightly move her head. Thankfully, the man whose bronzed thigh she was using as a pillow, immediately noticed. His golden eyes that were staring into the distant twilight turned to her.She smacked and puckered her lips.\u201cWater\u2026\u201dIshakan pulled her up and leaned her on his chest. He stubbed his cigarette on the brass ashtray on the bed, and reached out to the bedside table.Picking up the ewer, he had a mouthful. Then, looking at her parched lips, he kissed her, slowly releasing the water into her mouth. She gulped the cool water passing through his lips, drinking down to the last drop. Her eyes lingered on his, asking for more.Ishakan again fed her water in the same way. She felt some of her senses return after she\u2019d sated her thirst. However, she still had no strength in her body, and her mind was still hazy. She felt like someone was constantly poking her head with a small needle. Her perception was distorted, her vision spiraling.\u201cI feel dizzy\u2026,\u201d she said meekly.Ishakan passed something through her lips, as soon as she whined and shook her head.\u201cDon\u2019t swallow it, just let it sit in your mouth, for a few seconds, then spit it out\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s it, like that.\u201dThe cigarette smoke mellowly filled her mouth, and interestingly enough as soon as the cool scent permeated in her moistened cavity, her headache disappeared. The dizziness too slowly subsided. She wanted to swallow it, but lacked the strength to do so, so she kept it in her mouth and spat it out like she was bid.\u201cGood job.\u201dHe kissed her lightly. She liked the cool sensation and wanted to taste some more. She opened her mouth again, but Ishakan took it away firmly.\u201cNo. Too much of even medicine is poison.\u201d His soothing voice turned down her silent plea.A warm hand covered her eyes as she looked at him with sadness. His deep, low voice sounded like a lullaby.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou should be all right now.\u201dThat one word magically reassured her.Yes, everything was going to be all right.She closed her eyes, hiding in the darkness his palm bathed them in.Drowsiness started to occlude her thoughts.

The peaceful surrounding was intoxicatingly rich, free of chaos, enticing her to remain forever. Deep into a sweet dream, she was absolutely unfazed by the outside world.For someone who had been unable to have a proper sleep lately, the tranquility of pure silence that enveloped her, was a ray of salvation.After a while, she finally roused from sleep.\u201c\u2026.\u201dA groggy Leah woke up, disconcerted. She rubbed her eyes, trying to brush away the traces of drowsiness.Ah!Bringing her fingers to her eyes, felt like moving mountains. Her limbs cried out in unison, the aching soreness of her muscles was beyond the point of unbearable \u2013 it was so painful that as she moved, she thought she could hear the bells of death ringing in her ears.She struggled for a bit, but resigned to her body\u2019s vehement protests and fell back onto the bed. Her shifting made the beddings that encapsulated her rustle move, giving off a cool feathery sensation that soothed her.Suddenly, her eyes opened wide as she realized what she was covering herself with. The soft elegant fabric was in fact, silk; dyed in deep navy blue. The silver sheen reflected on the quilt indicated it was made of the highest quality. Additionally, it kept her warm, despite its thinness.An intricate pattern of dahlia night flowers and wreaths was embroidered with gold and rustic bronze threads. On the hem, two swirls, which appeared to resemble waves, outlined the floral pattern. Flicks of branches and leaves were also dotted in thread between the pattern of the quilt, harmonising with the dahlias.It was needless to say an exotic pattern that was completely unfamiliar to Leah. It was not a product of Estia.Leah\u2019s eyes fluttered open to the sea of indigo and gold around her and slowly, she scanned her surroundings.Above her, was the elegant canopy of a bed, and a darkly painted ceiling that had shapes of wild horses and dahlias carved into its wood. A gold plated rim surrounded the edges of where the ceiling met the walls, which too had been painted a deep shade of celestial blue.Looking around, the walls also bore the same pattern of her quilt\u2014delicate swirl designs were found on its surface. To her side, the sculpture of a horse head hung above, hovering a circular table made of redwood.Not far from it, a huge windokw that spanned the height from the floor to the ceiling could be seen. Large mauve curtains were drawn to obscure the light, though some beams had managed to pass through, illuminating the soft velvet carpet.After observing the unique color and patterns of the room, she gradually realized that she was in fact, inside the Royal Palace of Estia. Yet, the room she was in was decorated in Kurkan style. Most likely, it was probably how the royal palace, as courtesy, decorated the rooms where the Kurkans stayed.But why am I here?Leah blankly looked at the container placed on top of the table where a refreshing scent came from. Squinting her eyes, she found that its source was none other than a tobacco which Ishakan smoked.She tried to shuffle closer, but stopped by a radiating pain coming from her feet. When she rolled up the blanket, she saw her feet wrapped in bandages. Fragments of her memory soon started to hit her as she gazed at the meticulously wrapped linens from the soles of her feet up to her thin ankles.So, I drank the wine that Byun Gyeongbaek handed to me and\u2026As she recollected the events from yesterday, her parted mouth slowly widened\u2014what had transpired between her and Ishakan dawned on her. Instantly, her cheeks turned red, looking as if they were about to burst. Leah grabbed the pillowcase and abashedly buried her face.\u201cAhh\u2026\u201dAs thoughts of yesterday flashed through her mind, she wished she had not remembered it at all. She was appalled as she thought of how she had clung to Ishakan, crying and pleading for his help in such a disorderly, [email\u00a0protected] way. Her mouth spewed out disgraceful and brazen words as they made love to each other.Alas! The princess had behaved like a beast, losing herself under the influence of the potion. She tore at her innocent pillow. No matter how much she regretted what had happened that night, she could not undo her actions.\u201c\u2026\u201dLeah carefully curled her aching legs. The throbbing pain was a vivid reminder of how Ishakan had taken her wildly. The tone of his bronzed skin, slick against hers, the smooth texture of his rippling muscles, and the rhythmic motion of their nether regions slapping [email\u00a0protected] against each as they connected\u2014her limbs felt feverish and sore as she remembered how untamed they had been.She was not sure but certain parts of her body may likely be swollen too. Leah intended to endure the pain quietly but the feeling of hopelessness slowly crept into her.From the light coming from the window, it appeared to be noon\u2014the sun had risen, already high in the sky. Half of the morning had just disappeared, Leah surmised. She realized that, due to her absence, a pandemonium in the palace might have already occurred. Worst, she found herself unsure on how to settle it.Her fingers swept through her hair, parting it to one side. She couldn\u2019t help but sigh at her spinning thoughts, which she tried to passively organize.The first thing she had to do, was to go back to the main palace.Leah forced her throbbing arm, which could barely move, to pull the string hanging from the canopy of the bed. In response, a bell rang and the door opened after a faint knock.The woman who appeared had quite a large build, making the door dwarf in comparison. Tall muscular physique, with deeply tanned skin and broad shoulders\u2014these were all features unique to a Kurkan. The woman dipped her head low and politely greeted Leah.In return, the princess looked at the woman in the eye.\u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you, princess. I am the escort guard of Ishakan. You may call me Genin.\u201dLeah\u2019s eyes raked over the woman in front of her. She had not seen her during the welcome banquet and conference for the Kurkans. Yet, despite not appearing in public, for her to be an escort guard, Genin must have possessed a high status.To her surprise, Genin returned her scrutiny with an equal curious gaze. It was only after a short while that Genin, who had been blatantly observing her, realized the rudeness of her actions. Flustered, she hurriedly apologized to the princess before her.\u201cPardon my rudeness for staring.\u201d A reddish tinge on the woman\u2019s brusque face appeared. \u201cI was just startled by the fact that you have such a white and small physique.\u201dHer following remark, too, was considered rude in Estia. However, Leah found her frankness rather pleasant, making her smile gently in response.It was indeed true that she was smaller than what was considered average for women. Moreover, her pale complexion was quite extraordinary, especially when paired with her silver hair. For the Kurkans, she resembled a glass mannequin rather than a human.\u201cI apologize. Please forgive my lack of courtesy,\u201d Genin sincerely voiced her remorse.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Leah insisted, waving her hand at the woman, who was incessantly apologizing.Genin then gingerly approached the bed, and carefully placed on it the tray she had been carrying.\u201cI have brought you something light to eat,\u201d she said with her head down.However, it was today that Leah discovered the disparity between Estians\u2019 and Kurkans\u2019 culture. A tray, towering with a variety of delicacies, with just the assortment of bread alone being three storey high, was the Kurkan\u2019s definition of a light meal.She let out a furtive sigh at the culinary spectacle before her. Then, hesitantly, she reached out to the top loaf, afraid that one wrong touch and the delicately balancing loaves would crumble down.\u201cThese are your drinks, but I am not familiar with your preferences, hence I prepared these\u2026 This is for your dessert\u2026\u201dThe glasses she had placed on the table, crowded the small space. The one standing on the edge would at any moment, fall and shatter, thereby spilling its contents. Leah reached out to save it from dangerously falling. Her action of picking up only one glass of milk, startling Genin.\u201cThis is enough for me.\u201d\u201cYes??\u201dDue to Genin\u2019s shocked response at her choice to eat only a meager amount of food, Leah popped one more fruit to her mouth. Watching her eat, Genin uncomfortably fidgeted. She cautiously raised her voice in an apprehending tone.\u201cIs the food not good? I prepared Estian food though\u2026\u201d\u201cI do not eat much.\u201d Leah curtly responded.\u201c\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGenin\u2019s facial expression became even more puzzled\u2014doubting whether the princess was trying to starve herself to death. Leah smiled a little as if she read Genin\u2019s mind. Concurrently, it seemed that she had also discovered as to why Ishakan chose not expose Genin to the public.Leah\u2019s meal quickly ended with a piece of bread, a glass of milk, and several fruits. While gathering the dishes, Genin stole glances at Leah, internally brooding if she would want to eat more.However, Leah\u2019s resolve was undeterred. For her, she had already eaten too much.Whilst Leah was looking at Genin who was cleaning up the dishes, she noticed a tattoo carved on the back of her hand. As she looked on, she noticed that the tattoo extended to her forearm covered by her sleeves.She suddenly remembered Ishakan, particularly his b0dy, which was surprisingly devoid of any tattoos.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Noticing the princess\u2019 fascination, Genin pulled up her sleeves allowing Leah a better glimpse of her tattoo.She displayed her forearm, and spoke to Leah, \u201cI only have one tattoo.\u201dFortunately, she did not seem to regard Leah\u2019s curiosity as rude. Leah hesitated for a moment, then after contemplating whether it would be appropriate to ask the Kurkan woman before her, asked a question which she had been pondering curiously about.\u201cI had initially thought that all of the Kurkans have tattoos, but it appears that your king does not have any.\u201dAfter blurting such words, her cheeks flushed in embarrassment. It was the same as admitting to having already seen Ishakan unclothed, in all his glory. However, it fortunately appeared that Genin was indifferent, and seemed not to have thought of it.\u201cYes, King Ishakan has no tattoo at all.\u201d Genin\u2019s eyes sparkled with adoration. Her tone was full of pride for the Kurkan King.\u201cIt means that he has never lost a fight.\u201dLeah had heard stories of the Kurkans determining their rank by force. But it was her first time to hear what the tattoos symbolized for them. Furthermore, knowing that he had never lost a battle\u2026It was a surprising story, which somehow, felt reasonable. Defeat did not suit Ishakan. It was more befitting of him, to sit on the highest throne and look down victoriously from above. Leah thought of Ishakan\u2019s impertinent golden eyes as she spoke.\u201cThe king helped me yesterday.\u201dShe grabbed her blanket as she was engulfed with shame and continued to slowly speak.\u201cPlease send my gratitude.\u201d\u201cI will tell the King.\u201dGenin smiled the first time. With unease creeping up, Leah quickly changed the subject. \u201cCan you bring these clothes too?\u201d\u201cAll right, princess. The king has some work so he is not here at the moment. I will escort you to the palace.\u201dLeah brooded over what would be the better choice\u2014going to the palace with Genin, or having the maids come here. Both of the scenarios were terrible. The latter seemed to be a little better than going to visit him in person, however, amongst the maids, there were some who were afraid of the Kurkans.Even Countess Melissa had felt fearful when she encountered Ishakan. After pondering for a few moments, Leah decided to not inconvenience her maids by asking them to come to her, and instead chose to head to the palace with Genin.With Genin\u2019s help, Leah was able to dress properly. Though the king\u2019s escort guard was a little clumsy, most likely unused to attending a princess like Leah, she still eagerly assisted her. As she helped her put on a soft gown, Genin also made efforts to talk with Leah, despite not being blessed to strike conversations easily.It was her attempt to make Leah feel more comfortable around her and on the side, she wanted to make a favorable impression on Kurkan women. And judging on the princess\u2019 calm and trusting dexterity around her, it seemed like she had succeeded.As soon as Leah was dressed, Genin\u2019s arm immediately wrapped around her waist to support her.Since Leah couldn\u2019t possibly walk with the scrapes and wounds of her feet, Genin carried Leah in her arms\u2014one arm under her legs and the other supporting her back like a groom carrying his bride.\u201cPlease excuse me, princess.\u201dStartled, Leah\u2019s gaze rose to the sky, but unilaterally decided it was best to lean on Genin. In that form, they went straight to the carriage. She was grateful for the strong support Genin was giving her.While riding in the carriage, Leah\u2019s mind drifted, locked in her thoughts as her surroundings began to change. Soon, as they drew nearer to the palace, she began to dwell on problems, which she had pushed aside \u2018till now.An uncomfortable feeling settled down; the looming figure of the palace from the distance left an intangible feeling of dread inside her.When the carriage stopped, the urge not to get off overwhelmed Leah. Eventually, she suppressed her desire to stay, and opened the door and got off the vehicle. Naturally, her feet touched the ground, but she continued with her strides\u2014the pain that came with it was the least of her worries.She looked up at the lavishly decorated entrance. The limestone walls glistened in the sun, the texture of soft chalk.On both sides, sculptures of the former monarchs guarded the entrance; they had been made long ago by generations of artists, put on pedestals. The fountain that lay in front of the entrance, where the carriage had parked next to, majestically sprouted several clear streams from the centre in beautiful arches. The sun caught the droplets making them appear like diamonds raining into a pool of water. Perfectly manicured hedges, transformed into the shape of various animals neatly outlined the square of the entrance.However, despite this all, the palace\u2019s beauty didn\u2019t give her much comfort.\u201c\u2026.\u201dAn ominous feeling rose in Leah. Something was strange. When the carriage she was in stopped in front of the steep stairs, she had expected someone to come out and greet her.But no one could be seen welcoming her arrival.Leah hurriedly went inside.The palace was eerily quiet. Anxiety bubbled in her as she paced through the quiet hallways, but no one appeared to be walking around.Genin, who was behind her back following her, said in a wary voice. \u201cYour Highness, there must be someone in the reception room.\u201dWith that, the two headed to the reception room. Leah, who had been limping, walked towards the open door of the reception room and froze.What made her pause in her step was the audience that greeted her. From the maids of the royal palace to the handyman who did the kitchen chores, all of them were gathered together in the reception room.But it was not the sight of the servant which daunted Leah, rather, it was the man reclining in front of the servants, drinking tea alone. Perhaps it was the aura he emitted, or his vile personality at fault, the man in the middle was intimidating, making those around him quiver.From where she stood, Leah could see the servants trembling with their heads tucked towards their chests as if they had committed a grave sin.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe man placed his arm on the back of the sofa lazily and opened his mouth.\u201cOh, you came in early.\u201dHis sparkling blue eyes narrowed at Leah.\u201cI waited for you, sister.\u201dIt seemed that her arrival was not at all unheeded\u2014Blain had been waiting for her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She knew that soon, Cerdina would be calling for her.However, it was to her a complete shock that Blain had been for quite some time, waiting for her. The cup of tea swirled in his hand, had long gone cold. On the elegant mahogany table, appetizers and cakes were left in crumbles.He looked coldly at Leah. His eyes zeroed in, observing her from head to toe and taking note of the Kurkan clothing that she wore. Leah could feel his eyes judging her and it made her shift uncomfortably in her place.Of all the times, why did it have to be at this specific moment that she encountered Blain? Leah gripped her dress tightly. Her own clothes had been torn to pieces, so she had had no choice but to wear the gown that Genin had brought her.Blain moved his gaze to Genin who was behind her back. She only nodded at him briefly, and stood still, her expression blank. Blain chuckled at the disrespectful greeting. He felt utterly humiliated and ridiculed by the escort guard, whom he considered to be in a position far below him.\u201cI can now see that you hang out with them.\u201dLeah raised her eyes and quietly murmured, \u201cI only needed their help.\u201dBlain slowly rose from the sofa and walked towards Leah. \u201cWhat help?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPa!Blain\u2019s grimy hand struck Leah. A mark started to form on the cheek that he had hit.\u201cI see that\u2019s how it is. Choosing to be insolent. I asked you what kind of help you sought from them.\u201dLeah raised her eyes to meet Blain\u2019s. The place his hand had slapped her, surprisingly, didn\u2019t radiate any pain. On the contrary, a piercing, throbbing pain elsewhere in her chest jolted, but she subtly ignored it.She blinked at Blain and pushed his hand away. This drew a frown in the crown prince\u2019s face. Her apparent rejection, and blunt refusal to answer his question, angered him. He raised his hand once again.He, whose pride had been scored by Leah, would not tolerate it one bit. Anticipating yet another slap, Leah closed her eyes and waited. However, her surroundings became quiet, and the twinge she expected from his grubby hand was nowhere to be felt.Leah slowly opened her eyes, greeting the silence. Where Blain had raised his wrist and prepared to strike her, she found Genin holding it tightly.\u201cYou are the one who is being impolite!\u201dBlain frowned as he tried to free his arm, but he could not escape from her firm grip. At that moment, dwarfed by the muscular giant Genin, Blain seemed to be nothing but a mere powerless bastard. His strength fled. He was vulnerable.Despite being in the presence of Estia\u2019s future king, Genin didn\u2019t show any sign of inferiority. To her, pleasing him was a completely futile effort. She had no reason to, and did not have the desire to. Instead, she stared down at Blain wordlessly, and squeezed his wrist.\u201cBe careful.\u201d She warned, finally relinquishing her strength. The grip on his wrist was released, and she looked down at him admonishingly.\u201c\u2026\u201dBlain massaged his wrist as he glared at Genin. If eyes could sentence death, she would be six feet under. He burned with rage and hatred, towards all Kurkans\u2014exemplified by their defiance and his inability to do anything.To his disappointment, however, Genin remained unfazed. Her calm attitude fuelled his spite even more, and Blain needed an easy target to lash out his rage on.He stormed over to the side where the servants were lined up quivering in fear and like a snake, slithered his way across until he found one.The unfortunate victim, the janitor\u2019s child whose small body was tucked away trembling in the corner. With brute force, Blain yanked at the child\u2019s collar, grabbing his legs and threw him across the room. Before anyone could react to stop him, the poor boy\u2019s delicate body was flung into the air.CRACK!The child\u2019s head collided forcefully against the edge of the table and his body slammed into the floor. A red liquid stained the table as blood immediately oozed from the point of contact.\u201cAhhhhhh!!!\u201dA horrified scream broke out amongst the maids.The shock brought Leah\u2019s senses back. The child was motionless, and not even a cry or scream came out from him. She immediately ran across to where he had landed and hugged the boy to her. Luckily, he was still breathing, but in that moment, Leah only felt horror surge through.Baroness Cinael, who had stood behind Blain hurriedly ran to where the two were and took the child from her.Leah deeply inhaled as she stared at her half-brother, who was laughing. No matter how deranged he was, he should not have vented his wrath on the child. She could not believe that the very blood running in his veins, ran in her too.\u201cSister.\u201dHis voice suddenly softened. \u201cMy only sister, ruining the reputation of the kingdom. I cannot just standby and do nothing.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBlain whispered as he slowly blinked his eyes. Those dense eyelashes shielded the evil glint, a hint of his derangement as he took pleasure in his cruelty.\u201cDo you know the scandal that is spreading right now?\u201dLeah clenched her fist tight. Her whole body trembled with anger. She could have endured if he had hit only her, but she could not stand by idly letting him abuse the people of Estia.Without thinking, her lips moved, and she spoke words which, under normal circumstances, would never come out of her mouth. \u201cYou are the crown prince!\u201dBut most of all, you are my brother,she wanted to add. \u201cHow could you possibly do this?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The stillness of the reception room only amplified her clear and loud voice.\u201cDid you know what happened to me yesterday?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe ridiculing smile that had been plastered onto Blain\u2019s face disappeared. Hearing her words, he stiffened.But Leah, paid no heed to his reaction. Despite being infuriated, her breathing suddenly became even. Her hands started to feel clammy as cold sweat dripped from her neck. Forcing her wobbling leg to stay still, she looked up at him.Blain was taken aback at Leah\u2019s fierce and glaring expression.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare lay a hand on the people here. These people are all innocent.\u201d She managed to spit out those words as her heart, which had palpitated briefly a while ago, began to race. At the edges of her vision, flashes of dots started to appear, and her sight blurred.Leah would never relent. For the people, she would defy him over and over again and not back down. Even if Blain, at this very moment, dragged her to Cerdina, she would keep her stance.Blain, who had been looking straight at Leah, contorted his eyebrows.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Speechless at Leah\u2019s bravery, at that moment, Blain fumbled for what words to say in response.However, Leah was hit with a severe sensation of nausea and dizziness. Her legs that she had been coercing to keep her up, stumbled. In an instant, her hands came up to cover her mouth as she felt something rise up inside her.Suddenly, she spat a hot substance. Her palms, which were wet with sweat, reddened. A dark, red lump of blood lay in the middle of her palms in a messy stain. Her tongue tasted the iron that lingered and her mouth dribbled a line of red saliva til her chin.Leah stared at her hands and blinked. \u201cAhhh\u2026\u201dIn the very next moment, her legs gave out. Her body collapsed onto the ground, and Leah felt her surroundings quieten, welcoming the darkness that occluded her vision.Pandemonium struck as Leah lost consciousness.\u201cLeah!!!\u201dAmidst the screaming, someone caught her falling body.\u2654The Gypsies were creatures of lawlessness. They were pilgrims who adorned themselves exotically in rich deep textures and gold plated jewelry. Their headwear, made from luxurious silks and lavishly embroidered clothes, were symbols of their free spirit.They roamed freely around the continent as they were unconfined of the customs. These people, who did not possess anything, nor had ties that grounded them to a certain country, had nothing to lose. Because of this, they acted without fear for anything nor of the consequences that they brought amongst the people.However, the Gypsies, who were known to be fearless, only avoided one thing\u2014the Kurkans.Every corner of the continent could be home to the Gypsies, yet one region was left untouched by them. Throughout history, the Western Sand Desert was void of Gypsies. It was uncertain as to why they innately avoided the Kurkans, but one thing was for sure\u2014they were terribly afraid of them.\u201cHaban.\u201dIshakan moved his hand towards a man, who immediately took out a cloth to wipe off the blood from his kings\u2019 calloused hands. But the fabric, already stained crimson, was not enough to clean Ishakan\u2019s bloodied palms.In addition to his palm, the entire body of Ishakan was covered by blood. The deep liquid trickled down his dark skin, none of which belonged to him. It was a stark reminder of how powerful the man was.Ishakan wiped his cheek with the back of his hand and looked at the mess he had made. A low mumble came out as he observed the mess.\u201cDid I overdo it?\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201d Haban replied curtly. But for Ishakan, doing it this way was much simpler and faster.\u201cHowever, I am more comfortable using my hands. A blade would be too cumbersome to use.\u201dHe threw those words casually, as if he had just finished some light exercise. However, the scene before him was terrible. In front of the twisted and torn corpses, Ishakan calmly took out a cigarette. The tobacco was the usual\u2014wrapped in a leaf, and Ishakan gestured to Haban once more.A fire was lit, and Ishakan drew a deep breath, inhaling the soothing scent of tobacco.The gruesome scene of mangled bodies and splattered blood was a grim reminder of how monstrous the Kurkans were. Their wild nature was revealed at times such as this.\u201cIf you meet the aristocrats of Estia in that state, you won\u2019t even be needing a bribe to resolve the problem.\u201dHaban, who was witnessing the scorching eyes of Ishakan slowly cool off, spoke up.\u201cI\u2019m not too sure. I have not yet brought up that topic to them.\u201dHaban gave a low chuckle at Ishakan\u2019s words. Not a day had peacefully passed by, since he had arrived in Estia. The anti-peace party, including Byun Gyongbaek of Oberde, were trying to interfere with the agreement.Byun Gyongbaek seemed oblivious of the fact that the military strategies he had employed were practically useless. The assassins that he had sent, were also completely incompetent.In this regard, even the Kingdom of Estia was guillible. Only the Princess of Estia had surmised that the Kurkans were not interested in the peace treaty.\u201cAnyway, it has become more complicated now because of assassins. We have lost sight of the Tomari.\u201dHaban also took out his cigarette and frowned. They went to this place today because of the Gypsies. However, because of the sudden attack from the assassins, their plans had been rerouted. The Gypsies that they had initially targeted to kill had all fled.\u201cTomari is able to conceal themselves and circumvent any tails. With their ability to hide well, once you miss them, it\u2019s hard to catch them again.\u201dHaban nimbly chewed the cigar. Tobacco felt bitter on his tongue, but he ignored the unpleasant taste. He fretted as to whether or not he would be able to accomplish Ishakan\u2019s plans. So far, his efforts had gone to naught. Ishakan rubbed off the hair that stuck to his face, and roughly drew it behind his back.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCan we set up a group of people who will run after them? Do we have enough men?\u201d\u201cOur numbers are a little bit tight, but I will try.\u201d At the thought of seeing their plans go to success, Haban flamed with newfound motivation.Amidst the blood dyed floor, the tap of someone\u2019s footsteps echoed.\u201cGenin!\u201d Haban gladly greeted her. However, Genin had no time to respond to his greeting. With a terse expression, she went before Ishakan and reported.

However, he did not growl or emit any sign that showed his anger. In a low voice, looking at Genin straight in the eyes, he spoke. \u201cI thought I told you to take care of her, Genin.\u201dThe hazy smoke from the leaf cigarette that was slowly incinerating wafted in front of his face. Ishakan\u2019s eyes narrowed, and his blazing golden pupils which had yet to cool down, pulsated.\u201cBut you are here.\u201d Ishakan did not need to say much. His meaning was clear.Immediately Genin\u2019s face paled and drained of its color. She kneeled down. On her knees, in front of Ishakan, she kowtowed and bumped her head on the ground. Her hands were shaking as she committed her admittance to her wrongdoing.Haban, who was standing beside, could not properly breathe as he looked at the scene in front of him. It was hard to see Genin begging for forgiveness.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to make a mistake once, but twice is not.\u201d Ishakan wearily exhaled as he commanded, \u201cGet up. Please be cautious next time.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dGenin bowed down once again, her forehead touching the ground, and then she rose on her feet.Locked in his thoughts, Ishakan suddenly mumbled. \u201cShe vomited blood. That is indeed strange.\u201dHaban and Genin glanced at each other. They seemed to come to a consensus through their brief exchange. In Genin\u2019s stead, who had previously been scolded, Haban opened his mouth. The connotation that came out from his words were implicit.\u201cWas it not because youtormentedher last night?\u201d It was a reassuring remark as if there was no truth clearer than this. Ishakan smiled briefly and shook his head.\u201cIt can be a cause\u2026 but I only gave her a puff yesterday.\u201d As soon as he picked up his cigarette, Haban\u2019s eyes popped.\u201cIsn\u2019t that a poison to humans?\u201d\u201cIt is a medicine for them if appropriately used.\u201dGenin replied to the stupefied Haban. She reassured him that Ishakan would not in any way, harm the Princess, let alone feed poison to her.\u201cRight. It is quite suspicious if there is an adverse reaction like vomiting blood.\u201dIshakan threw the cigarette that he held in his hands to the floor. The cigarette mixed into the pool of blood. Ishakan trampled on the embers of the leaf, completely extinguishing the fire.His hands curled into a fist and he softly said.\u201cDo you not think something is happening in the Palace of Estia?\u201d\u2654Every now and then, Leah would experience some dizzy spells. Whether it\u2019s because of Cerdina being stricter on managing her diet during meals, or her habit of sleeping late due to her busy schedule, she didn\u2019t know.What she did know is that this was the first she had vomited blood and fainted right after. When she finally regained her consciousness, the first sight she was greeted with was Countess Melissa, whose eyes were puffy red due to her endless crying.\u201cPrincess!\u201d the Countess exclaimed as soon as she realized the Princess was now awake. She had called out quite loudly, it was hardly a surprise when moments later, a horde of maids and servants immediately came to crowd all over her, calling out to her in relief.Countess Melissa helped Leah in sitting up, gently propping her up against the pillow, as the other maids fussed over the princess as well.\u201cPrincess!\u201d\u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u201cDoes it hurt somewhere?\u201d\u201cDo you need anything?\u201dThe questions and concerns continued flitting around her. Meanwhile, Countess Melissa had all but forgotten proper etiquette and decency for she clung dearly onto Leah\u2019s arm. Leah could only follow blindly at every question thrown at her, growing further and further more confused with the onslaught of voices.It was a little later that Countess Melissa finally realized her plight.\u201cStep back all of you!\u201d she immediately ordered, \u201cThe princess had only just awakened, give her space.\u201dDespite her good intentions, everyone felt deeply offended. It wasn\u2019t that she was wrong, but it was mainly because Countess Melissa was the first to charge into without remorse to the princess\u2019 feelings after just being woken. Sensing the irony of her statement, Melissa hid her embarrassment behind a cough.Baroness Cinael was one who was bold enough to voice her displeasure.\u201cCan\u2019t we even show our relief in the Princess finally waking up?\u201d she asked, and Melissa, to her credit, looked a little sheepish\u2026\u201cBaroness, that wasn\u2019t, how can you-\u201d but the Baroness only cut her off.\u201cIf I recall, Countess, you were the first to encroach on the Princess\u2019 personal space! Clinging and yelling gladly at her waking up.\u201d she pointed out further.And after that statement, she burst into tears, prompting the other ladies and daughters in the room to follow suit. One by one they all cried out, filling the space with a wailing noise. Leah sat up, moving to pacify the crying ladies\u2026Countess Melissa only wiped her tears away, making the princess lean back once more before steeling her resolve.\u201cNonetheless, the princess had only just woken up. Don\u2019t you think she needs some more rest before consoling you?\u201d she asked them.At her words, even the Baroness cannot deny the truth. And so reluctantly the cries died down, silence once more reigning in the room.With her audience pacified, Leah lightly brushed her hair to the other side of her neck, which was full of sweat. Then she drank a little bit of the water that Countess gave her and listened to the events during which she was unconscious for.\u201cYou have been sleeping for the whole day.\u201d Countess Melissa told her.After Leah had collapsed and vomited blood, the royal palace was immediately thrown in a disarray. Blain, who had been standing in front of Leah, had immediately caught her before she hit the ground.Melissa further told Leah how Blain had immediately moved to summon the medics, his face aghast as he carried her.\u201cHe was certainly concerned for your health,\u201d she remarked, \u201cContrary to how he is whenever he was tormenting you.\u201dMelissa shuddered at the thought of him, remembering how detestable Blain was. Despite her urge to say more condemning things about him, she held back, and continued on until she finished relaying to the princess everything that happened.When she was done with that, she immediately jumped onto a different topic.\u201cThough I must say, the barbarians seemed decent enough.\u201d she told Leah, referring mostly about Genin.Leah mused to herself how fond the Countess was of her, if by the way she praised the Kurkan was anything to go by.As she listened further, she could agree that Genin certainly sounded likeable enough.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDuring the time when Leah fainted, Genin immediately pushed Blain aside, who was shouting frantically. She wrapped her arms around Leah\u2019s unconscious frame before she rushed to the bed and laid her there.She then unfastened Leah\u2019s belt, which constricted the airway and blood flow of her body before taking the lead among the bewildered maids.But she didn\u2019t stop there.The medics arrived late and could not even properly diagnose what ailed the princess. Genin took it upon herself to step up and assess Leah\u2019s situation. She then offered to light up a strange candle, which she believed would help the princess recover.And indeed, it worked as the princess had indeed survived.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A fact she sheepishly admitted to the princess.\u201cI really thought something worse would happen.\u201d Melissa continued, as her lips began to tremble, and eyes turned watery.Leah opted to change the conversation, wanting to prevent any further waterworks from the Countess.\u201cWhat happened to Byun Gyongbaek of Oberde?\u201dAt the mention of Byun, Melissa\u2019s expression brightened up as she delivered the news.\u201cByun Gyongbaek was completely humiliated this time.\u201d she proudly announced.\u201cIs there even something that can humiliate him?\u201d Leah asked, raising a brow in doubt.\u201cI thought so, too.\u201d she giggled before continuing her story in a cheerful manner.\u201cI didn\u2019t know how much drink he had, but he was discovered by the fountain without his pants on. By the end of the banquet, all the aristocrats who were coming out of the hall saw him in such a shameful way.\u201d She winced as she remembered that moment.Melissa had been amongst the many witnesses that time, and thus had provided the princess with a detailed description of his embarrassing discovery.Apparently, they all discovered him face down, butt naked.\u201cHe also sustained a broken leg, so he might be limping for a while. But we very well know Byun Gyongbaek doesn\u2019t get drunk that easily.\u201d Melissa pointed out, \u201cI even heard that even if he did get that drunk, he isn\u2019t one to make such grievous mistakes. So, it\u2019s quite possible he was poisoned or drugged with the wine.\u201d she mused to herself, before brushing it off as unimportant.Judging by Melissa\u2019s disposition, it\u2019s most likely that word of what Byun Gyongbaek did to Leah last night, had not spread throughout the palace.As his plans were thwarted, he would most likely see it as a defeat on his part. He was shamed, and in front of the aristocrats and Kurkans at that. He will most likely call something for a settlement of affairs after that incident.She wondered if she should mention it.But her worries did not last for in the end, it was something she couldn\u2019t dare say to Melissa. Even if she were to mention it, she\u2019ll most probably end up spouting hateful words, and nothing she would\u2019ve done could have changed that.As she was lost in deep thought, she failed to notice Countess Melissa had gone silent, and now just watched her with nothing to do. There was an awkward silence that enveloped the room, and despite Melissa wanting to say something just to break the silence, she found she couldn\u2019t do so.Eventually the light atmosphere from before gradually dissipated, leaving nothing but a heavy feeling lingering in the air. Melissa hesitated for quite some time, mustering her courage, before she was finally able to call out Leah\u2019s attention once more.\u201cPrincess.\u201d she called out, bringing Leah out of her thoughts.Leah immediately could tell there was something she really wished to talk about, but had hesitated so she began talking about it in a roundabout way. Melissa felt her mouth grow heavy as if her tongue was made of lead.Taking a deep breath, she finally managed to open her mouth to speak despite the great difficulty.\u201cI, I wanted you to know\u2026\u201d she began, gulping as she tried to force the words out, \u201cI was the one who changed you that time\u2026 just by myself\u2026\u201d she trailed off again. Leah could see from her eyes alone she was fighting through many emotions in that single moment.\u201cPrincess, do you\u2026 have you\u2026was there any unwanted advances in your relationship?\u201dIshakan had undoubtedly left marks all over Leah\u2019s body. Aside from the countless bitemarks she\u2019s retained, there were also bruisings and handprints left on her thighs and buttocks.The outward appearance of the blemishes around her body might have appeared harsh on an outsider\u2019s point of view, that even labelling it withbad romancecouldn\u2019t even begin to describe it. It was only natural for Countess Melissa to have misunderstood the implications based on her findings alone.\u201cOh no, it\u2019s not something unwanted.\u201d she replied lightly, which only made Countess Melissa bewildered.\u201cThen, in that case\u2026 was it\u2026 your partner\u2026 one of the barbarians?\u201d she asked, \u201cPerhaps\u2026 the King of Kurkans?\u201d taking the fact her mistress might\u2019ve had sexual relations with them, she immediately amended how she called them.She couldn\u2019t very well continue calling them barbarians now, could she?Unfortunately, Melissa was only met with silence when Leah refused to answer further. She couldn\u2019t help but begin to fret worriedly about the possible consequences, as she brought a hand up to her lips, one of her many nervous ticks.Seeing the Countess fill herself with senseless worry, Leah finally answered the question she was yet to truly ask\u2026The one the Countess was really concerned about\u2026\u201cDo not fret.\u201d she said, \u201cYou have nothing to worry about my virginity.\u201dIt was a vague answer, neither a lie, nor was it an absolute truth.But if she were to be asked whether it was still intact, obviously it wasn\u2019t. She had lost her chastity quite some time ago already. And despite the fact she had planned to end it in a one-night stand, such a thing hadn\u2019t been possible.Leah wondered if she could even make Countess Melissa, one with such naivety, understand her reasoning.\u201cAnd also, I\u2026\u201d her voice cracked, before she cleared her throat as she tried to keep a cool and relaxed facade. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on having a relationship with him.

Eventually, the carriage turned to an extravagant-looking neighborhood on the road, still, Blain couldn\u2019t help but seethe in anger, releasing endless profanities under his breath.As he kept spouting curses into the shelter of his carriage, he finally reached the queen\u2019s estate.\u201cStay here. I will go further alone.\u201d He spat at the secretaries, who flinched and backed away to let him enter the palace alone.It was to be noted that the queen\u2019s quarters were undoubtedly the grandest in the entire palace.With her quick wit and good eye for learning things, Cerdina had all but chosen the most expensive and most precious of artworks in existence, and placed it all in her quarters. Her room was even adorned, from top to bottom, precious gems and gold.But even the grandiose of the place couldn\u2019t hide the despair and bleakness it reeked of.Blain glanced in distaste at every statue he passed by, before pushing the auditorium doors haphazardly across the hallway, uncaring of the scene he was causing.\u201cThe Crowne Prince!\u201dCount Weddleton exclaimed, shooting up from his seat in surprise as Blain slammed the doors open. Unfortunately, Cerdina remained unfazed, who greeted the prince rather calmly with a gentle smile.\u201cDo come in.\u201d she invited him in.There was an expensive fox fur draped across her legs, stopping right by her knees. Her hands gently swept over the soft furs, even as she continued to address the prince rather casually.\u201cI was thinking of making a muffler out of this beautiful fox you gifted me with.\u201d she informed him lightheartedly. She even seemed perfectly delighted, even praising the gray fur, commenting how perfect it was for a shawl!In a harsh, yet soft voice, Blain corrected her.\u201cBut that wasn\u2019t my catch, was it?\u201d he spat at her, and she only giggled, covering her lips with her knuckles as she smiled at him.\u201cDon\u2019t be such a killjoy, child. The knight who hunted with you might have caught it, but it\u2019s equivalent to your catch,\u201d she pointed out.She had asked around if the knight was truly his knight, but still she remained seated like the perfect queen she portrays to be. Smiling brightly, with a flawless expression, she looked like an angel, but the tension was thick in the room.Sensing an argument in the making, Count Weddleton immediately excused himself after glancing back and forth the two monarchs for a moment more\u2026\u201cI think I better go ahead,\u201d he excused, gathering his things, and moved slowly out without any further prompting.Neither Blaine nor Cerdina did anything to stop him either. Count Weddleton hurriedly escaped from the room. Even the maids who were attending them silently moved out of the auditorium to give them privacy as well.With only Blain and Cerdina left in the room, Blain finally openly glared at her.\u201cWas it you who did it?!\u201d he immediately demanded for.\u201cDid what?\u201d she asked, feigning confusion.\u201cThe princess vomited blood right before fainting.\u201d Blain hissed, \u201cI am asking you, if it was you who poisoned her.\u201dQueen Cerdina merely blinked owlishly, her eyelash fluttering softly as she let Blain throw a fit in front of her. When he was done, she answered in a cool voice\u2026\u201cWhy do you think of that?\u201d she asked in a graceful manner, but it only served to aggravate Blain more.\u201cBecause it\u2019s something you would naturally do!\u201d he spat at her.\u201cBlain, my beloved son,\u201d she sighed out softly, placing the fox fur aside before she stood up to walk towards him, taking her sweet time, before tentatively pulling him into a hug.Blain shivered once she touched him, and found his limbs frozen, unable to push her away. Her hand came up to the back of his head, sweeping down his neck, and then repeated the motions in a placating way.Her lips moved until she was whispering right next to his ear\u2026\u201cI thought you said she was yours?\u201d she asked rather coldly, \u201cWhy would I meddle in things you own?\u201d\u201cMother\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy do you keep worrying?\u201d she asked, finally pulling away to look at Blain in the eye. His neatly trimmed brows creased to a frown, \u201cAre you frightened of her being stolen? By some mere\u2026 barbarian?\u201d she asked, quirking up a brow at him.\u201cI\u2019m merely worried about her purity.\u201d he begrudgingly admitted to her.\u201cAh,\u201d she said with a soft smile, \u201cSo your only concern lies with her indecent activities, and whether or not she\u2019s kept her chastity?\u201dIt was quite amusing to see her son worked up. She watched with slight fondness the way he clenched his jaw tightly.\u201cFret not, my son.\u201d Cerdina told him, patting his shoulder lightly, \u201cOnce the negotiations are over, you\u2019ll be recognized as the sole heir to the king.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to worry about it. I can get you whatever you desire.Those were the very words Cerdina would tell him many times before. Her voice sounded like a lullaby against his ears\u2026Eventually, he turned away, averting his face away from her. In complete contrast to the rage of emotions swelling up in him from whence, he arrived, now stood a pacified prince. Cerdina looked at Blain with pity, before she continued to speak.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou must believe me, it was a shock to me as well when I heard what happened to the princess.\u201d she assured him, \u201cAnd if you do manage to visit her, do send my regards for best health, and to take her time to rest well.\u201d\u201cAlright, but in the meantime, you\u2019re to leave her alone,\u201d Blain told her, and Cerdina nodded, waving away his concerns.\u201cYes, yes, until she fully recovers I will, I could even rearrange her schedule-\u201d\u201cWhat!? No!\u201d Blain suddenly erupted, pulling away from Cerdina\u2019s arms.

Eventually, the silence was broken after a tense moment.\u201cBut I\u2019m doing this for you!\u201d she exclaimed, her tone indignant as she talked over him.Blain opted not to reply, even as he heard the sharp shrill of her tone. He\u2019d rather choose silence over responding to his mother.He deemed it wise not to tell his mother of his own view and thoughts with her every decision\u2014whether it was right or wrong.Cerdina heaved her chest up and down as she looked at him bewildered. Her harsh breathing filled the silence instead as she waited for his rebuttal.After a few moments, she finally calmed down enough to school her posture once more to the regal Queen she was. Disregarding her sudden outburst, she gave him another graceful smile, a faux expression instead of what she truly felt.As the Queen of Estia, she must always be the perfect picture of grace and beauty.\u201cI would never do such a thing, Blain.\u201d she insisted gently. Blain only narrowed his eyes at her.\u201cI shall try to believe you then.\u201d\u201cI shall stay away as she recuperates, just as you wish, but please,\u201d she then beamed him a bright smile that did nothing to console his nerves, \u201cI ask you not to take it out on me next time.\u201d She let out a breath before she headed to her seat once again, tossing the fur fox in frustration to the floor, contrasting the initial importance she regarded it with.She trampled on it like a simple rag on the floor.\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s time I talk with those\u2026 barbarians.\u201d Cerdina spat it like it was something disgusting, before she looked up to Blain once more with a smile, \u201cWould you like to join me for dinner with them?\u201d she rubbed the heel of her shoes on the fur, wiping the soles off its dirt.She watched the way the fur creased beneath her feet with a certain amusement, before raising her gaze once more with an expectant smile.\u201cI sure hope you can hunt a deer this time around.\u201d she remarked with a mournful sigh, \u201cI\u2019m quite sick of foxes. Preferably a fine, majestic stag.\u201dBlain\u2019s eyes narrowed the more he stared at the Queen. Their argument never lasted long\u2014eventually, he found himself agreeing to the dinner, playing right into her hands.\u201cOf course, mother.\u201d he quipped tersely.\u2654Leah was able to rest for several days after she vomited blood and fainted. She felt anxious whenever she thought of the amount of postponed work. However, on the other hand, she was also happy that she didn\u2019t need to attend the conference anymore.If it were any normal day, she would have a hard time being dragged into tense situations with Cerdina. Moreover, regardless of her vomiting blood, Cerdina would have ordered her to stand like a doll in the banquet hall to fulfill her duties.Although, that would have happened if it wasn\u2019t for Blain who prohibited further access in the princess\u2019 quarters while she was recuperating.Blain had taken it upon himself to inform everyone that Leah had suddenly fallen ill. He also ordered that no outsiders shall be able to enter the palace. To prevent anyone from breaking in, he even doubled the amount of guards around the royal palace and even sent chauffeurs to guard her quarters.Even Cerdina, who was used to belittling the commands of her husband, would not dare defy Blain. Blain had known of this fact, so he pressed his advantage against Cerdina. Leah found everything weird, but she did not think much of it. She just let it go, thinking it was only another one of Blain\u2019s whimsy.As she was resting in the palace for a few days, Byun Gyongbaek of Oberde had sent her a huge bouquet of roses and jewelry every day.Hs gifts only served to mirror his attention-getting personality.It seemed to her, he was trying to get back into her good graces, hoping she would forget his sin against her. Leah found it mildly endearing how he was trying so hard to get her to forgive him by the copious amounts of gifts he\u2019d send her every day.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBut despite knowing this, she never made it as far as opening even a single one\u2014Countess Melissa would return to the sender. She\u2019d never even manage to accept even one to take a look. She was merely informed Byun Gyongbaek sent gifts.When asked about why she sent it back, Countess Melissa merely shrugged.\u201cThe bouquet was too big. I even thought better of turning it into fertilizer before sending it back,\u201d she answered haughtily, and Leah giggled.\u201cGood. Please do so with any further gifts.\u201d Leah praised, and Melissa nodded.\u201cOf course! And for tomorrow, princess\u2026\u201d she trailed off, eyes moving to the side skittishly before lowering her voice, wary of the bustling maids around them, \u201cThe queen has requested your presence.

She found Melissa to be adorable with the way she changed how she used to call them: from Barbarians to Kurkans. In response, she only gave a soft smile.\u201cPlease relay that I will attend.\u201dShe knows she couldn\u2019t just confine herself to the palace, even when she had ample excuse to do so.The agreement was already at its final stage. The peace treaty was not something that would happen overnight, nor resolved easily. Before they could fully enter the treaty in full confidence, she needed more information.While she was confined in her quarters, she was sending and receiving news through Count Valtein. He would be too busy with his own duties as of the moment to even attend to her.She also received some news from Laurent of the finance ministry. He informed her that he was ready to propose a new tax reform plan at the next Cabinet meeting.It was clear that the nobles, including Byung Gyongbaek, would fiercely protest against this new plan. Leah did not expect that the bill would be easily approved.That\u2019s why she intended to combine the peace treaty with the reform plan.Byun Gyongbaek held the pivotal role among the aristocrats who were opposing the plans. Once the peace treaty is approved, Byun Gyongbaek\u2019s influence would waver. That\u2019s why he was pressed not to let the peace treaty happen.This is the best course of action as of now.Leah and Countess Melissa were talking about the peace treaty when a maid soon entered the office, announcing an item\u2019s arrival.\u201cIt seemed that Byun Gyongbaek sent another gift.\u201d Countess Melissa muttered in irritation and told her that she would come back later. She then left the room, and Leah, who was left alone, went to stare outside the windows.Leah was curious about the tuberose in the garden. Every night, the attractive flowers would be in full bloom, and she wanted to see if the tuberose in the Princess\u2019 quarters would also be like that.Now that she remembered it, Leah realized that she had not seen him for some time now. But she knew that this was the right step in the relationship between them. It is only natural that they would not see each other in any circumstance aside from public gatherings.However\u2026Leah continued to stare at the window in silence. She didn\u2019t have the luxury to be absorbed in her nonsense thoughts. She then turned to stare at the pile of documents on her desk when suddenly the door opened.\u201cPrincess\u2026.!\u201d Countess Melissa exclaimed when she came in. In her hands, she held something.It was a tuberose, around three or four of them, all cut neatly and tied matching white ribbons. As soon as they caught her attention, she found she couldn\u2019t avert her gaze away from them.Giving Melissa a puzzled look, the Countess placed the bouquet on her desk, and drew something from underneath it before handing it over to Leah.It was a Kurkan-style dress made of purple silk with colorful patterns.And with it, a simple note.Are you alright? It\u2019s been hard to meet you.It was written in the continental language, the strokes of the letters looked crooked and rough. Leah let out a soft gasp in surprise as she brought her hand up to her lips as she looked at the note.The message was soft, and the words looked like a child\u2019s scrawl, but she found herself smiling. She could just imagine Ishakan\u2019s thick brows crossed as he held ink and paper on his large hands, trying with all his might to scribble comprehensible letters.Conscious of someone who might see her reaction, she quickly schooled her features. However, it was too late, for she had already caught the eyes of the maids around her.Granting her some courtesy, they averted their gazes and pretended to not have noticed anything. Unfortunately, the same couldn\u2019t be said to Baroness Cinael, who certainly made a fuss out of the fabric.\u201cOh my God! It\u2019s a dress of purple silk! The purple silk of the robes worn by the barbarians that time were so beautiful that the nobles were all talking about it\u2026 Everybody has been looking for the same thing.\u201d She gasped in obvious envy.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe even asked if she could touch the dress only once, her lips agape in anticipation, almost as if she would end up drooling about it. She only regained her senses when Countess Melissa gave her a side glance accompanied with a scowl on her face.Leah only got the note and flowers and handed back the dress to Countess Melissa.\u201cPlease return the dress.\u201d she immediately said, and a gasp of shock was heard.\u201cPrincess!\u201d Baroness Cinael stomped her feet on the ground, obviously indignant of her decision, but Leah couldn\u2019t afford to accept something so expensive. Especially with the ongoing negotiation, it would look too much like a bribe. But even Countess Melissa refused to take the dress from her.\u201cBut princess, the messenger who brought the gift said that should any of the gifts be returned\u2026\u201d She gulped, looking nervously as she spoke the next words, \u201cThen the king would not attend the banquet any further.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since she couldn\u2019t just wear it anywhere, she only ordered it to be kept safe until she could decide when it could be appropriately used. With that decision, the maids of the royal palace were able to see and enjoy the purple silk of the Kurkans firsthand.It seemed that by now, Ishakan knew how to play her, make her do as he pleased. He now knew what her weakness was, so she was left without a choice but to bear with it.Even though he had a devious disposition, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a strange emotion that she couldn\u2019t begin to describe.Leah decided she needn\u2019t bother delving into an emotion that she could not clearly define. It was a waste of time. But also because she had a gut feeling that discovering it now wasn\u2019t the right time just yet.Even in the beginning, she couldn\u2019t divulge her emotions easily. Although everyone knew that she was resting, her busy schedule was still making her keel over from time to time.It was finally the day of the luncheon. They were all busy since the first light of day.Since the stop-entry-order in the palace had been lifted, she had to take care of all the work that had been postponed since her accident. Later in the evening, she would arrange a meeting with Finance Minister Laurent and Count Valtein.Despite the preparations for the luncheon having started early, she took her sweet time preparing for it, contrasting the hustle and bustle for the luncheon the maids were doing.Since they will eat in the garden, her hair was styled with fresh flowers and accented with jewels. The dress she wore was a soft-colored dress embroidered with a thread of the same color as the fabric. The design was simple, yet nonetheless elegant.It was Baroness Cinael\u2019s suggestion. It suited her well that all the ladies and gentlemen of the palace admired how she looked perfectly. Even Countess Melissa gave her a beautiful compliment with just a single remark.\u201cIf Count Valtein sees you today in your outfit, he will surely be amazed!\u201dIn the middle of all the unending compliments being cast to her, Leah put on the finishing touch, her white-laced gloves. With that, she then left early.However, no carriage was available in front of the Princess\u2019s palace. The flustered horseman was only standing and waiting outside. She did not need to ask what happened.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Princess.\u201dA man pretending to be polite, but was perpetuating an unbelievably rude act, was waiting for Leah. Leah can hear the maids who were following her, as they loudly gasped at the sight of the man, before stopping a few paces behind her.Either way, Ishakan smiled at Leah. His golden eyes were brilliantly sparkling as the sunlight reflected on it. Almost like his eyes was the sun itselfLeah blinked owlishly at him, as she observed him carefully.It seemed that he came alone. Though there was no escort knight around to accompany them, she did not rule out the possibility there is someone who has been hiding nearby and following him, just like last time.He had been staring at her for while now, deliberately not taking his eyes off her. Leah only spoke in a confident tone, after making sure he had no tricks up his sleeves.\u201cYour Highness, how did you come to this place? The luncheon place is not here.\u201d she pointed out, feigning curiosity.Ishakan merely brushed off the threatening undertone in her voice. It was just as he expected from her.\u201cI heard that there is an etiquette in the continent that men must accompany a woman of prestige.\u201dHe was referring to an escort. However, this time, it was only a luncheon where only a few people will be gathered, and thus needing an escort would be irrelevant. This is especially true for officials like the King of Kurkans and the Princess of Estia.He probably did not know that the complicated and difficult etiquette should be applied depending on the situation at hand.No\u2026The more she thought of it, the more Ishakan seemed like the type of person who would be stubborn enough to do as he pleased, regardless of whether he fully understood the customs of the place. He did so, because he could.So instead of pointing out his mistake, Leah decided to bring up another topic.\u201cI wanted to return the dress to you.\u201d she admitted, and Ishakan\u2019s lips curled up into a smug grin.\u201cBut you can\u2019t.\u201d Ishakan kept a gracious smile on his face while looking down at her. \u201cAre you doing this because you want to fully enjoy the luncheon without me, princess?\u201dLeah thought that she felt a little bit nauseous. Her heart also thumped a little faster. The black tea she had in the morning was so strong, so she thought it was the reason behind this. Ignoring the stirring sensation, she retorted words in a cool manner.\u201cAre you trying to appease me like how you did with Count Valtein?\u201d she asked, narrowing her gaze at him.The maids of the royal palace stood still, watching nervously back and forth between the two of them as they held their breath and gulped. Baroness Cinael only fumbled with the handkerchief that she held in her hand.Ishakan burst into laughter in front of all the ladies.\u201cWinning over the princess through a mere silk dress\u2026 Isn\u2019t that too cheap?\u201d he grinned coquettishly, and Leah fought the urge to scoff.His head had been tilted downwards. Since their height difference was one head apart, he could only whisper to her ears by tucking his head and stooping low.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI only gave that to replace the destroyed dress you had, Leah.\u201dSuddenly a memory came over her, she could still vividly remember how her dress was ripped off and laid on the bed of tuberoses.Heat rose on her cheeks.He stared at Leah\u2019s ghastly white face that was slowly flushing red. It was an amusing sight, witnessing the princess\u2019 cheeks change color.\u201cWill you wear it for me? I carefully chose that dress thinking it will suit you well.\u201d his voice dropped, as he spoke to her in a husky tone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why are you getting me into trouble?\u201d she hissed quietly at him. Ishakan frowned with her short reply. He stubbornly drew his face closer to her, ignoring the witnesses.\u201cIs that too much for a man who served you with his whole body?\u201d he whispered.As soon as she turned her head, even though slightly, the sharp tip of her nose brushed over his cheek.\u201cI helped you a lot, right? I even almost died.\u201d she spat back coolly.Even if she told him, he would still do the same. Had it not been because of Ishakan, she would have been caught by Byun Gyongbaek in the garden that night. Ishakan snapped and lightly brushed his forehead against hers.\u201cYou should return me a favor, princess.\u201d he softly demanded of her.Leah eventually took a step back minutely. But despite that, Ishakan only drew closer to her. The more she ran away, the more he would provoke her. Eventually, she found she could no longer avoid his gaze, as her eyes slowly looked up to meet his\u2026When she did, there was a satisfied glint in his eyes. Leah silently opened her mouth.\u201cTell me what you want.\u201d\u201cWalk with me towards the luncheon hall.\u201dIshakan playfully quirked up his eyebrows. After sharply looking at Ishakan in a sidelong glance, Leah unwillingly moved her first step ahead of him. She thought of walking ahead of him at a far distance. Give herself some space away from him.However, she overlooked something. There was a great difference between their bodies, just like heaven and earth. He quickly caught up with Leah in only a couple of steps.\u201cYou walk too fast.\u201d he jested, and she bit the inside of her lower lip in annoyance.I can\u2019t believe this man.Leah scowled at him as he laughed mischievously.\u201cI came because of you. It\u2019s been hard to see you these days.\u201d Ishakan grumbled, saying that the princess, who is locked up in the tower, should not be like this. She admittedly finds it cute, though it doesn\u2019t quite suit him.Leah discreetly stared at him. His brownish-black hair naturally falling down on his broad forehead. The clear line on the bridge of his nose that continues all the way up to his eyebrows gave him a fierce look, contrary to how he gifts her with a softer gazeAn itching feeling enveloped her hands. It was an unbearably itchy sensation, like the buds that sprout during springtime.Leah fisted her hands under the white-laced gloves, then moved slowly. Ishakan walked right next to her, matching her step by step as they walked in perfect tandem together. They were getting nearer to the garden where the luncheon will be held. After all, it was just a walkable distance.With every step, she thought of the people who would be seeing them, so she chose the road where fewer people would pass by. The maids followed them at a distance where they cannot hear the conversation between the two of them.The weather was good. Walking under the warm sun felt better than she originally thought. Both of them kept their silence while walking. There was a cozy feeling blanketing them as quietness ensued between them.It\u2019s been a long time since Leah went out for a walk. Like a cat hanging by the window at noon, Leah fully enjoyed the sunshine with a relaxed mood. Having a walk outside had never felt this good, possibly because she had only been staying inside the palace for many days.A thought suddenly occurred in her mind.It might be possible that Ishakan knew what happened to her so he deliberately asked her to walk with him outside today. But she didn\u2019t bother to ask him for confirmation, and let her thoughts slip away.When they were about to reach the garden, Ishakan who had remained silent along the way, suddenly opened for the first time since they began walking\u2026\u201cYou look lovely today.\u201d He complimented her. His simple statement left her feeling breathless. While Leah thought of her answer, Ishakan continued speaking, not waiting for a response. \u201cDid I mention that the Crown Prince will also attend the luncheon?\u201dThere was a deep frown creased on his forehead.It seemed that he was displeased with the news he let slip from his mouth but he did add anymore, nor ask her what she thought because they were about to arrive in the Queen\u2019s palace.The maids of the royal palace, who were waiting outside to greet her, looked at them with a tinge of surprise. Possibly because they expected neither of them to arrive together. However, the maids only bowed down before them as Leah passed by, impassive like a doll, without any expression on her face.\u201cThey are waiting inside.\u201d the head maid informed them, leading them to the way.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThey walked towards the garden as escorted by the maids. She could see, even at a distance, the tablecloth embellished with gold sand. The table was decorated with attractive flowers, small fruits, lace, and petals scattered artfully all over, while exquisite silverware and ceramics lined up\u2014which were all a bit too fancy for a luncheon, Leah thought.The nobles were already sitting at the table. At the upper corner of the table, the King and Cerdina were seated, while Blaine, the Crown Prince, was located by the left side of the table. The seating plan was pre-arranged, and Leah was set to sit beside Blaine, while Ishakan would be sat across from her.She paused in front of them, and firmly stood, before giving them a blank stare.Cerdina drew a smile upon seeing Leah. The queen\u2019s dress shimmered brightly beneath the direct sunlight. The form of flat dress without the balloon effect was undoubtedly not of Estian style. Its skirt fell smoothly unto the floor.The princess\u2019 eyes widened fractionally when she realized what the queen was wearing\u2014it was the silk dress that Ishakan gifted to Leah.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She saw Ishakan smiling at her, wearing a slightly puzzled expression on his face. He looked at her, the meaning behind his golden eyes was clear.Did you give it to her?Leah subtly shook her lowered head. For a split second, a wave of nausea overcame her, which caused her to immediately bring the back of her white hand to her mouth, covering it.Without a doubt, within the princess\u2019 palace, there must have been a traitor. One, who also had a very close relationship with Leah.Until yesterday, the princess\u2019 palace was strictly forbidden to outsiders. Only those who were allowed in and were close to the princess, knew about the extremely valuable treasures hidden away\u2013tyrian silk. Made from the dye of ten thousand crushed snails, the deep rich purple silk was reserved only for the royals.In order for the dress to be taken away, a person from the inside of the princess\u2019 palace must have intervened. To be exact, it\u2019s one of Leah\u2019s maids.It was a scheme to separate Leah from the maids of the princess\u2019 quarter. Only, it became problematic for them by using such an obvious method they could not escape.Therefore, this was not the end of Leah\u2019s cover. She\u2019d move on as a royal daughter. Even if they made a decision, there would be a division among the maids. Leah was not in a position to find out the suspect and didn\u2019t know what to do to begin with. She was also worried that Count Melissa, the head maid, would severely blame herself.Leah glanced at Cerdina who was smiling. Beneath her cruel smile, she was quietly hiding her sinister intentions, anticipating Leah\u2019s reaction. Leah had thought that the queen would grace her by leaving her alone for a while. However, again, Cerdina twistedly started her play, slowly strangling Leah.For now, she had no energy to entertain Cerdina. Leah kept her gaze low.\u201cThe dress is beautiful.\u201d An obvious sarcastic voice flew in.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect the queen to wear Kurkan\u2019s clothes.\u201dCerdina and Ishakan\u2019s eyes met. Unlike Ishakan whose face was void of any emotion, a coquettish smile flitted across Cerdina\u2019s lips.\u201cThis is to serve the King of Kurkans.\u201dShe was not flustered at all. She stole other people\u2019s gifts, and even in front of the gift owner, she appeared confident.\u201cThe peace that the two nations will pursue together will certainly require mutual understanding. I am merely doing what I can, as a hostess from the royal family.\u201dThe King of Estia raised his head. His eyes were filled with nothing but admiration for her, upon hearing her speech. The way he looked at his wise wife was full of affection. Leah bit her lip as she felt her nausea coming back. The urge to vomit was so strong, she could barely suppress it.Ishakan\u2019s mouth twitched. He was even more irked at Cerdina\u2019s shameless behaviour, but surprisingly, reigned in his emotions and endured it. He glanced at Leah quietly, who was still biting her lips, and headed for her seat whilst maintaining her cool facade.With her sluggish pace, she silently seated herself. However, the moment she touched the seat, the dizzy spells made her head heavy again.It was the royal family who were desperately in need of negotiations of amity. There was no reason for Cerdina to make Ishakan\u2019s temper change. Particularly, when Cerdina wanted Blain to enjoy full power.Just to harass Leah, they were attempting to break Byun Gyeongbaek, whilst scraping the peace they held with the Kurkans. This sacrifice was highly suspicious, if not, unusual. It appeared that there seemed to be something Leah was unaware of. She refocused on her surroundings, and glanced at Cerdina, taking note of her attitude towards Ishakan during the luncheon. It seemed necessary to properly observe her actions\u2026and, the tyrian purple silk dress\u2026\u201c\u2026\u201dShe felt strange today. Usually, if it were the same, she would have been able to control her emotion skillfully, but it was hard to do so. Useless impulses kept flaring up out of nowhere.Right now, Leah wanted to get up and slap Cerdina in the face. She wanted to yell at her to take it off right away because it\u2019s hers. These were thoughts her usual self never had.Since she had become close to Ishakan, had her nature changed? The powerless royal daughter and the king who reigns over the western desert are worlds apart.Leah glanced across the table, towards Ishakan who sat indifferently. The chair seemed a little small for him. In comparison to those seated, his large and tall stature dwarfed everyone.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe was watching Cerdina. His eyes were subduing a certain impulse that stirred. A dim flame lit in his golden eyes. Despite being relatively subtle and soundless, the air around him was heavy. After all, such a frightening man was in front of them. Waiting on him was the Estian servant who had been assigned to attend Ishakan. He looked ashen as he battled the intense nervousness and fear of serving the great man before him.The expression Ishakan wore was ghastly, and his sharp eyes felt like daggers that would pierce one and root them in place. Feeling Leah\u2019s gaze, he suddenly turned his head. Immediately, the golden eyes that flickered with embers of rage, and were sharp as a blade, softened at once.Leah realized. Ishakan was enduring Cerdina for her.In his mind, he also had the urge to strangle the Estian queen. The image of her body lying face down on the grass with the dress torn to shreds seemed appealing. After all, it was an insult to the dress to be worn by her, tearing it would save it.However, Ishakan breathed out calmly. If he acted on impulse, Leah would be in trouble. So, he had no choice but to keep his rage at bay.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Between Leah, Ishakan, and Cerdina, a silent war raged. The subtle desire of each person to advance or protect the other was concealed by their facades.Only the king, who was oblivious to everything, burst into a broad smile and announced the start of the luncheon.A small bell rang out and an appetizer came onto the carefully arranged table. The day was warm and coming from the garden the scent of flowers was fragrant.The dishes prepared by the palace\u2019s cooks were also sincere enough to be admired. They contrasted the tension in the air. The precarious balance dancing at the edge of a cliff, could easily be toppled over.The king and Cerdina led the conversation at the luncheon. Ishakan did not actively engage in it, but he responded moderately to what they said.\u201cIt seems like Estia and Kurkan have been engaged in a useless war of attrition. If we had a chance to talk earlier, peace would be what we have in the present.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s indeed a pity, for our two nations to have sacrificed so much,\u201d Cerdina let out a light scoff, apathy apparent in her tone. Blain, who was silently bringing his fork to a rest after finishing his food, twisted his mouth and laughed.The luncheon continued with amble talk, and after the appetizer, the next main course was brought in. Leah, who was tasting the first dish, grilled herring with soft sour cream, felt as if a thorn had been lodged in her throat. She found it hard and painful to swallow, despite the smooth texture of the cream.She hoped Blain would not mess with Ishakan, who was enduring for her, without causing a scene.\u201c\u2026?\u201dSomething touched her foot. Unconsciously, she looked at the other side and Ishakan\u2019s eyes curved into a slight smile. His twinkling, bright eyes, were full of mischief, Leah could only guess what he was up to. She nudged him back, her foot bumping into his shoes.It was an outdoor garden, so the table at the luncheon used was a small one. With roughly eight people sitting around it, the table seating was strategically placed. It was a royal family strategy, for diplomatic means. The most important people were seated closest; by narrowing the distance, intimacy in their mutual relationship was emphasized.Considering Ishakan\u2019s build, he was tall enough to stretch his legs to the opposite side. Perhaps he had bumped into the chair because it was a little small for him.Leah\u2019s eyes widened as she was wondering if she should tell the servant to change the chair. However, her face heated up, thinking of the consequences. To her sheer horror, calling it a mistake at this point would be an utter embarrassment. The movement beneath the table had turned increasingly explicit.A gentle touch pushed Leah\u2019s shoes away. Her shoes came off, slipping from the smooth silk socks she was wearing.The shoes, which had been dangling from the heel, escaped Leah\u2019s feet and disappeared somewhere. She tried to wear them again by reaching out her feet in a hurry, but only stepped on the soft leaves of grass.Her foot stumbled about on the grass, looking for her shoes, when suddenly, a weight gently bumped the tip of her foot. The toe of a solid, well-made shoe, gently touched Leah\u2019s foot. She could feel the cool tanned leather under the silk that separated it from her foot. Then, it lightly tapped again on the top, so as not to hurt her, but enough to leave dirt.Leah drew her feet towards her and looked down. A black stain was drawn before her eyes on the white silk socks. Leah cupped her toes, heat flaring up in her cheeks. Looking at Ishakan with her rosy cheeks and heated neck, she was slightly angered by his small antics. He seemed to be delighted that he could make fun of Leah and seeing her in trouble made him chuckle.Again, she scuffled her feet and begged with her eyes, pleading him to not tease her like that. However, her moment of relief was short lived. Soon, a tickling sensation arose from her ankle. A soft light touch traced her bone, as the hard shoe cap gently slid up her calf and down again.A strange tingling sensation arose from her lower abdomen. Without even realizing it, her thighs were shaking.\u201cAre you sick?\u201d Leah, who was distracted by what was happening under the table, was surprised. Next to her, Blain was furrowing his eyebrows.\u201cAre you sick? Don\u2019t make me ask twice.\u201d Blain whispered to her lowly, an expression of concern flitted across his face.From observing how red her face had become from the heat, he had misunderstood Leah to be sick. It was because he recalled how he had recently seen the scene of her throwing up blood and fainting in front of him.Across them, the king and queen expressed no interest in the situation occurring, as they were too busy exchanging gazes and words of affection with each other.Leah looked up and across her, feeling the gazes of Ishakan and Blain, she managed to lick her lips.\u201c\u2026No.\u201dHer hands kept shaking, so she clasped the tableware tightly. She wanted to reach under the table and push his legs away, but it was etiquette to keep both hands on the table throughout the meal.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou look sick,\u201d Blain stated. His hand reached out to touch her cheek.It was at this time, that the shoes that had been drawing circles on her ankles, dug into her skirt and swept up her calves. The immediate change in position and cool toe cap against her smooth calves caused her to take a small breath and stiffen.\u201c\u2026\u201dBlain narrowed his eyes thinly. Slowly putting his hands away, he picked up some silverware lying in front of him and dropped it to the floor. The servants in the back ran and tried to pick it up, but he gestured to them, waving his hand briefly and personally bent down.His action of picking up the tableware was slow, however, when he straightened his back again, clutching the silverware, Blain\u2019s face was horribly distorted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the back of his hands, lines of blue popped. Blain had seen the explicit play happening under the table.His blood was riled by the provocative exchange he had witnessed between Leah and Ishakan. In a fury, Blain contemptuously discarded the tableware he had picked up to the quivering servant, who had been waiting anxiously since the crown prince bent to pick up the piece of porcelain himself.It was the first time he had seen the royal do that, and the expression that crossed Blain\u2019s face afterwards had been frightening.With a nervous and humble posture, the servant immediately brought back new tableware for him. Blain, who had begrudgingly received it, could not forget the image he had seen. His hands grasped the cool white porcelain tightly. His grip so strong, at any moment, it seemed the tableware would break under pressure.Unlike Blain, who was struggling to contain his rage, Ishakan slowly drew his cup towards his lips and smirked. His posture was ever so relaxed, that one could easily tell, he comfortably fit into the luncheon.Judging from his attitude, it seemed that Ishakan had deliberately acted as such, for Blain to see.The next moment, Cerdina cocked her head and glanced towards them. Her gaze narrowed at the servant, an apparent expression of dissatisfaction spread across her face. Her eyebrows furrowed distastefully\u2014it appeared that the queen had seen Blain picking up the tableware himself.For a prince to act lowly in front of the esteemed guest present, Cerdina inhaled sharply and shot daggers at the innocent trembling servant, who feared to even look directly at her eyes.Leah could not find her shoes, which had peeled off. She blushingly hid her feet deep inside her dress, hoping that would stop Ishakan from touching her provocatively again.Ishakan laughed lowly, a glimmer of amusement in his eyes. His low rumble tickled her ears and made her want to hide herself. She felt a nudge beneath the table, and quickly slipped her feet back into the delicate shoes Ishakan had stolen away.Blain grasped the knife in his hand, the tense grip made it difficult for him to cut up his meal. The aromatic lamb dressed in thyme and smoked lavender that had been served, laid untouched.He seemed to be trying to put up with it somehow. But the moment his eyes met Ishakan\u2019s, who was smiling leisurely across the circular table from him, he eventually, with a rough gesture, laid down the tableware again.The furious prince, who had been ignoring Ishakan up to this point, spoke to him for the first time.\u201cDoes the food suit your taste?\u201dAmusement flashed across Ishakan\u2019s face. He seemed to be having fun, taunting Blain. He stared at him as if asking if he wanted to try it.\u201cI heard it\u2019s hard to get ingredients in the sand desert, but I\u2019m worried that unfamiliar food might not suit your taste.\u201dAlthough Blain\u2019s words implied that the food Ishakan was eating was far more precious than just a normal meal, Ishakan\u2019s expression remained the same; relaxed and carefree. He was a king after all, no matter how rare the food, what was there that he could not get? Ishakan briefly opened his mouth, and drawled.\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. More than I expected\u2026\u201dHe tilted his head, eyes turning to look at Leah. From her large amethyst eyes, to her small nose, pouty lips and small chin, he mapped her face in his eyes. Traveling further, he reached where her porcelain skin met the neck of her dress, which was gently wrapped around her shoulders, like a silk cocoon.He\u2019s eyes ravaged her, examining every soft curve, and texture of the beauty before him. Soon, he reached for a serviette cloth, intricately embroidered with lace. The tip of his fingers leisurely wrapping around it as he brought it to his mouth.\u201c\u2026so much better.\u201dIt was strange to learn of the affection he could express with the light, pleasant and calm tone. For someone who was an absolute beast in the sheets, and knew how to use his masculine body to make a woman feel good, he was surprisingly gentle. With an indescribable like in his eyes, he whispered.\u201cI want to stay in Estia for a long time.\u201dThe grind of teeth could be heard from the opposite side of the table. Blain\u2019s eyes flashed deadly pale. The noble sarcasm that had meant to humiliate Ishakan in the Estian society, had not even laid a small scratch. In front of a man who was the fierce embodiment of a beast, sharp words were weak; all bark but no bite to him.At this point, even the tactless Estian King seemed to recognize that the situation had taken an odd turn. The king looked at Blaine and Ishakan in bewilderment.However, the king had long been out of the minds of two men. Blain who completely was caught up in his anger, forgot everything that told him to remain silent. The delicate nature of the political situation before him vanished with his anger, and he opened his mouth, fury in his eyes.\u201cI heard that the King of Kurkans has not yet married.\u201dHe uttered what he should not say. \u201cWill you plunder a bride in Estia?\u201dSurprised, Leah grabbed him by the forearm, but he immediately shook off Leah\u2019s hand.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBlain.\u201dFeeling the seriousness of the situation, the Estian King also called out his name and warned. But despite the warnings from his family, Blain refused and ignored them.\u201cAt least I hope the king won\u2019t do that.\u201dBlain ended his words by twisting his mouth into a sneer.\u201cIt is considered a barbaric act on the continent.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although the continent despised the Kurkans, calling them barbarians, the remark was said behind their backs.One would never dare to say it in front of them, much less to their king!Cerdina stared at Blain, shocked by how upfront he was in the presence of Kurkans, let alone Ishakan.In the freezing tension, bright golden, yellow eyes and frosty blue eyes collided with each other. An internal battle raged as Blain glared down at Ishakan. A relentless hatred conveyed in his glare.\u201cI\u2019m saying this out of concern.\u201dIshakan, who had never lost a fight in his life, was not the type to avoid Blain\u2019s provocation. Instead, he chuckled at Blain, who openly brought out his claws and emanated hostility. It was a smile that looked like the tease of a playful young child.He tilted his head back slightly and raised his eyebrows.Seeing his languid gaze, Blain clenched his jaw, preventing the string of venomous words to leave his mouth. He utterly despised the man before him.\u201cEstia doesn\u2019t seem to have much intention of making friends.\u201d Leah looked at Ishakan with trembling eyes, but his gaze focused on Blain, missing her. \u201cI thought you had the same goal, but now, I don\u2019t think so.\u201dThe relaxed laughter disappeared. With his mouth closed in a straight line, in his golden eyes, a storm gathered.\u201cIs today\u2019s luncheon to interrogate me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d It was Leah who answered on behalf of the Estian family, breaking the silence.\u201cMisunderstanding, my king.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIshakan turned his gaze slowly. He looked at Leah with an expressionless face.Knowing the weight of the situation, Leah quickly covered up for Blain. \u201cThe prince wants peace with the Kurkans more than anyone else. He\u2019s the one who is abolishing the slavery of your kind.\u201dShe did not know what Blain or Cerdina were thinking, but she was desperate to keep the peace in Estia.Blain opened his lips to say something but stopped when he felt Leah clench his forearm. Fortunately, he kept his mouth shut again.\u201cHowever, he made a slip of the tongue as he is not particularly good at expressing his feelings.\u201d She breathed a sigh before continuing, \u201cMay I ask for forgiveness on his behalf?\u201dEveryone knew that everything Leah had said was pure flattery, in an attempt to pacify the disrespected King of Kurkans. It was just a matter of whether he would decide to accept the apology or not.Soon, Ishakan, who was staring at Leah without even blinking, raised a question.\u201c\u2026is it the prince\u2019s work to investigate slavery?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dIshakan belted out a laugh, as if he was in a jovial mood. On the contrary, Leah went silent. There was no way that Blain would be interested in the Kurkans nor the slave trade. It was all Leah\u2019s work. But as always, what Leah accomplished became Blain\u2019s contribution.This arrangement had become natural that Leah had become used to being robbed. Her whole life was not hers.Ishakan glanced at Leah, and lowered his voice softly.\u201cThis is the second time, princess.\u201dIt was a pointless answer. But only Leah understood.\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dFor Leah\u2019s sake, Ishakan endured again. Patience was not a virtue of the Kurkans, especially one of Ishakan\u2019s status. She was already at a loss of what to pay him for controlling his temper for her, twice.The luncheon continued again in spite of the unsettling atmosphere. The formal conversation was cut short, and no one mentioned the heated exchange, which transpired just moments ago. The servants waited carefully, not daring to move lest they make a mistake and disobeyed. They were treading on thin ice.Leah finely cut the aromatic lamb into small pieces. It was as if a stone had been lodged in her throat. She couldn\u2019t swallow; it felt painful to even gulp. Her appetite had completely disappeared, but she kept on filling her mouth, keeping herself busy.Suddenly, a soft voice spoke up.\u201cLeah.\u201dHer body became stiff as the queen called her.\u201cHow\u2019s the food today?\u201d Cerdina smiled brightly as she said so.She then leisurely used her silver fork to dip a piece of lamb into an herbed sour cream, then popped it into her mouth. It was a warning from the queen.Hence, Leah laid down the tableware as she watched Cerdina eat. She was unconsciouslyovereating, her way of steering her attention away from Ishakan.Her heart had calmed down. For several days, because of her sudden illness, she was able to eat to her heart\u2019s content without Cerdina\u2019s interference. Of course, it was ridiculously small compared to a typical meal, but it was far beyond the queen\u2019s standard.\u201cIsn\u2019t the princess eating too much?\u201dThis was said with the intention to humiliate her.Glutton.\u201cI don\u2019t think I eat a lot,\u201d Leah responded, and dipped her head.\u201cAh, the food must be terrible.\u201d The moment these words left Ishakan\u2019s mouth, Cerdina let out a disgruntled sigh. It was a luncheon hosted by the royal palace. The fact that the food was flawed was no different than an insult to her.Leah looked at Cerdina nervously. The queen\u2019s facial expression went sour since Ishakan\u2019s exchange with her beloved son.\u201cIs it because the king doesn\u2019t like it? We should have prepared some Kurkan food, but I wanted to show you Estia\u2019s culture, so\u2026\u201dShe smiled, sweeping the silk dress which glimmered in the sunlight. Ishakan was thrilled, he found her character ridiculously amusing, that she dared steal his gift to Leah.\u201cI even thought of wearing Kurkan clothing. Ah, I\u2019m ashamed.\u201dThere would be no third time. Ishakan was no longer patient. His large bronze hand picked up a glass of wine, the deep rich contents swirling a brilliant red. He rose from his seat and then, without hesitation, tipped the glass over Cerdina\u2019s head.\u201cArgh!\u201dCerdina screamed. Her perfectly rouged face and plated hair were soaked with alcohol. The dress she was wearing also had a large splatter stain. The precious clothes that could not be bought, even with a noble household\u2019s wealth, was ruined.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh, dear.\u201dCerdina shot daggers at him. The wine dripped from her hair, and down her chin. She was completely drenched.What\u2019s more, Ishakan still had the nerve to wear a smile. Amusement and irritation dancing across his golden eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s my fault, Your Highness. I\u2019ll send you a new dress.\u201dBut unlike his smiling mouth, his eyes were cold.\u201cThis time, in a color that suits the queen.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, like a gaping fish, she slowly parted her lips and then closed them again.Speechless, her eyes twitched in irritation.The situation at the luncheon was a complete mess. Leah watched blankly at the scene unfolding before her\u2014her mind was too shocked to process the catastrophe that had erupted the moment Cerdina had provoked Ishakan and pulled his last thread of patience.In all honesty, this was indeed an anticipated occurrence. From the instance Cerdina had stolen Leah\u2019s dress, her action had ignited a fuse. The blatant disrespect and deceit, was merely the match that had lit the ticking time bomb.No matter how desperate Leah was, her attempts to amend matters were futile. The eventual clash would occur between the two parties, regardless of the efforts she made to delay the future. Her pleading attempts to pacify the King of the Kurkans, were only used to buy time. In the end, the explosion would still inevitably happen.Droplets of crimson red dripped from the edges of the crystal wine glass. Ishakan slowly placed his glass down, and a scornful smile spread on his lips. His eyes directed pure hatred at Cerdina, and their meaning was clear.Get lost.Meeting Ishakan\u2019s eyes, Cerdina stiffened. The man before her had a frighteningly powerful aura, and she stuttered in his presence.Staring down at her pitiful state, Ishakan let loose words of sarcasm.\u201cThat dress, I thought it didn\u2019t suit you.\u201dHis statement was a clear insult, with nothing but contempt portrayed in his tone. All Cerdina could do was dip her head and raise the corner of her mouth. Her deep red lips curved into an arc as she projected was the most elegant and beautiful smile, that tried to conceal her previous daring actions. The pure image of her bright smile, mixed with the smell of alcohol, was, in this strange atmosphere, like an oddly grown weed in the outdoor garden.Cerdina raised her hand in an elegant gesture, and beckoned towards a maid. Then, she stood from her seat and spoke refinely to Ishakan.\u201cI will take my leave for a moment to change my clothes.\u201dWith the support of the maids who hurriedly came to help their mistress, Cerdina left the luncheon, without a falter in her step. The king, who remained alone after suddenly being abandoned by his wife, glanced around nervously at the luncheon.His eyes landed everywhere, except for Ishakan. The coward king was so tense, he could not even fault Ishakan who had been so openly rude with his actions. The King of Estia, was exactly like a puppy, who had lost its master.Indeed, he was most undeserving of the title: King of Estia. The little dignity that he had left in him to hold him upright, even that, was now ruined. A leader like him, could only lead their country to one fate: ruin.Leah\u2019s eyes flitted to the king. In front of her, she felt the weight of her family bearing down, on her shoulders, heavier than a crushing boulder. Her heart knotted up, constricting with frustration at the mess she now had to deal with. An aggrieved sigh left her lips.How foolish are you? This negotiation decides the fate of the country, yet\u2026rather than helping\u2026I can\u2019t believe you are ruining it\u2026Even if the King of Estia begs for forgiveness and kneel in front of the King of the Kurkans, it would not be enough. Mercy was too gracious, and on top of that, the pride of the Estian royal family would be an obstacle in their way.A dreadful solitude sunk in. Leah felt like she had been thrown into a warzone. On both sides, a brutal slaughter was ongoing, and no matter how desperate she was to stop their madness, her shouts landed only on deaf ears. In the wild plains, the echo of her voice did not return, even when her throat became hoarse and bled.Enveloped with misery, Leah slowly rose from her seat. She saw that there was no reason to remain in the luncheon any longer. Everything had been ruined, and because that, it was better for her to leave and do something else than senselessly kill time here.When Leah was about to move, a shadow loomed in front of her.\u201cPrincess.\u201dThe man who had been dealt continuous disrespect, extended his hand towards Leah. Slowly, she looked up at him. Her eyes travelled his large frame, until they reached his eyes, then his hand. The size of his hand was almost twice as large as hers, yet within those fine lines, were so many possibilities.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHesitantly, she raised her arm, intending to place her fingers in his large palm. However, she paused. She was not sure what future it could lead to if she did so, and therefore, she could not bring herself to readily accept him.Seeing her unsure, Ishakan did not press her. He only calmly observed her, waiting patiently as Leah froze. Her mind was clouded, her emotions conflicted.At times such as this, Ishakan, was strangely patient. Even though he was such a man, to use force and act recklessly to gain what he desired, this was a side that he showed only to her\u2014care and patience.Sensing that being with Ishakan was better than staying here, she reached out to hold his hand, when suddenly a stern voice interrupted.\u201cSit.\u201d Blain coldly spoke. \u201cWhere are you going?

His eyebrow twitched; it was clear that he was furious at Leah. Great bitterness swept across his face, as her disobedience caused unstoppable rage to surge through Blain. The always compliant Leah, had dared to defy him. His fist balled up and he slammed the table, clattering the plates as he tried to intimidate her into staying.However, it was already too late. Leah\u2019s hand was already extended towards Ishakan. As soon as her fingers touched his, Ishakan immediately entwined them. His grip was so powerful, that even she was astonished. Ishakan grabbed her hand, his grip was stable and assuring, and pulled her to his chest.In the blink of an eye, with a few powerful strides, they had left the table of the luncheon and the garden.Blain, still wrapped in his wrath, tried to chase after them. However, his hand which had tried to steal Leah back, missed by mere inches, before Ishakan had whisked her away. Nothing but hollow, cold air met his skin.\u201c\u2026\u201dReleasing his grip on the air, Blain brought his fist down, and clenched so hard, his nails dug into his skin and pierced his flesh. However, he ignored the pain. It was nothing, compared to the feelings of turmoil and rage that consumed him in that moment. For a minute, his eyes grazed over the empty spot that Leah had sat, moments before. His icy blue eyes trembled intensely, directing all his hostility towards Ishakan, at the chair.It was his last chance. As Ishakan dragged Leah out of the garden, Blain reacted and shouted at the knights who stood guard at the luncheon entrance to stop them. However, it was too late.Coupled with how long his legs were, the distance they covered with their speed increased, and soon, the garden where the luncheon was held, was nowhere in sight.In front of the maze of the palace, they stopped in a corridor lined with marble pillars.The sons and daughters of nobles who were playing nearby, noticed the intense figure of Ishakan dragging Leah, and realizing that they were figures of importance, quickly dispersed like ants doused with water.Their surroundings immediately became silent. Even a pin dropping would be audible.Ishakan looked down at Leah and breathed out, finally releasing his grip on her wrist.The moment his hot hand let go, Leah hid her hand behind her dress, however, Ishakan noticed her action and instantly drew it to him again.His hand had left reddish marks on her white, slender wrist. Even though Ishakan had tried to grip her gently, Leah\u2019s skin was so pale and fragile that the grasp Ishakan had thought was light, had handprints on her skin. She was truly made of glass.\u201cWhy\u2026!\u201dCaught in the middle of surprise, Ishakan stopped his words as his voice rose sharply. He brought his hand to his face, covering his eyes, as mixed emotions ran through him. A loud sigh left his mouth and he disheartenedly murmured.\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me it hurts.\u201dWhen Ishakan said that, Leah realised how distracted she had been. His grip, though left marks, did not hurt her at all. Those little things were insignificant to her.She raised her head and her light violet eyes met Ishakan\u2019s deep golden ones. Her lips opened and spilled out the words she had intended to say all along.\u201cI deeply apologize in lieu of the royal family.\u201dHowever, Ishakan roughly stopped Leah, nudging her. \u201cStop.\u201d He commanded.The sun that glowed in his eyes, pulsed as his pupils dilated. A swarm of emotions ran through them.\u201cYou\u2019re not a sinner. Why are you always being so apologetic?\u201dA sense of frustration and anger crashed down on him. Each time he interacted with her, it was like a wave upon wave of intense fury. However, the reason behind this was far different from what Leah was thinking.\u201cWhat the hell did Estia do to you? Is it not enough to sell you to Byun Gyongbaek? You\u2019re a damn shield\u2026\u201dFrom what he knew, in Ishakan\u2019s mind, only Leah had made any effort in the luncheon. She alone had held herself trying to maintain an amicable relationship; only she had selflessly thought for her country.Rendered speechless, and unable to fathom her actions, he tucked his head and whispered lowly.\u201cIs the kingdom too important to you? To the extent of protecting the Crown Prince?\u201d Ishakan vehemently tried to control his raging emotions. It was only for Leah\u2019s sake that his anger quelled. Leah chewed on her lips, without uttering a single sound.He raised his hand and tilted her chin up. \u201cWhy did you not say anything?\u201dHis thumb grazed over her lips and pressed, parting her mouth. Leah almost bit his fingers but stopped herself in time.\u201cIf you feel wronged, you should also express your anger. Shout, say anything. Even if you\u2019re not\u2026\u201dHearing his words, the stirring emotions that had been dead, came to life. Even if she had thought she could bear it, her lips moved on its own accord.\u201c\u2026What would change if I do that?\u201dNothing. There\u2019s absolutely nothing that it would change.Chapter 63 \u2013 Unquenchable Thirst for Power (1)Blain was still sitting upright at the table, using the lifeless luncheon, as an excuse to make Leah stay. \u201cI said don\u2019t go, Leah.\u201dHowever, Leah did not reply to him.Unable to endure her lack of response, Blain kicked his seat. His eyebrow twitched; it was clear that he was furious at Leah. Great bitterness swept across his face, as her disobedience caused unstoppable rage to surge through Blain. The always compliant Leah, had dared to defy him. His fist balled up and he slammed the table, clattering the plates as he tried to intimidate her into staying.However, it was already too late. Leah\u2019s hand was already extended towards Ishakan. As soon as her fingers touched his, Ishakan immediately entwined them. His grip was so powerful, that even she was astonished. Ishakan grabbed her hand, his grip was stable and assuring, and pulled her to his chest.In the blink of an eye, with a few powerful strides, they had left the table of the luncheon and the garden.Blain, still wrapped in his wrath, tried to chase after them. However, his hand which had tried to steal Leah back, missed by mere inches, before Ishakan had whisked her away. Nothing but hollow, cold air met his skin.\u201c\u2026\u201dReleasing his grip on the air, Blain brought his fist down, and clenched so hard, his nails dug into his skin and pierced his flesh. However, he ignored the pain. It was nothing, compared to the feelings of turmoil and rage that consumed him in that moment. For a minute, his eyes grazed over the empty spot that Leah had sat, moments before. His icy blue eyes trembled intensely, directing all his hostility towards Ishakan, at the chair.It was his last chance. As Ishakan dragged Leah out of the garden, Blain reacted and shouted at the knights who stood guard at the luncheon entrance to stop them. However, it was too late.Coupled with how long his legs were, the distance they covered with their speed increased, and soon, the garden where the luncheon was held, was nowhere in sight.In front of the maze of the palace, they stopped in a corridor lined with marble pillars.The sons and daughters of nobles who were playing nearby, noticed the intense figure of Ishakan dragging Leah, and realizing that they were figures of importance, quickly dispersed like ants doused with water.Their surroundings immediately became silent. Even a pin dropping would be audible.Ishakan looked down at Leah and breathed out, finally releasing his grip on her wrist.The moment his hot hand let go, Leah hid her hand behind her dress, however, Ishakan noticed her action and instantly drew it to him again.His hand had left reddish marks on her white, slender wrist. Even though Ishakan had tried to grip her gently, Leah\u2019s skin was so pale and fragile that the grasp Ishakan had thought was light, had handprints on her skin. She was truly made of glass.\u201cWhy\u2026!\u201dCaught in the middle of surprise, Ishakan stopped his words as his voice rose sharply. He brought his hand to his face, covering his eyes, as mixed emotions ran through him. A loud sigh left his mouth and he disheartenedly murmured.\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me it hurts.\u201dWhen Ishakan said that, Leah realised how distracted she had been. His grip, though left marks, did not hurt her at all. Those little things were insignificant to her.She raised her head and her light violet eyes met Ishakan\u2019s deep golden ones. Her lips opened and spilled out the words she had intended to say all along.\u201cI deeply apologize in lieu of the royal family.\u201dHowever, Ishakan roughly stopped Leah, nudging her. \u201cStop.\u201d He commanded.The sun that glowed in his eyes, pulsed as his pupils dilated. A swarm of emotions ran through them.\u201cYou\u2019re not a sinner. Why are you always being so apologetic?\u201dA sense of frustration and anger crashed down on him. Each time he interacted with her, it was like a wave upon wave of intense fury. However, the reason behind this was far different from what Leah was thinking.\u201cWhat the hell did Estia do to you?

Their lives were worlds apart. And then, Leah would be the one to take care of the mess he had created after he left.Even though she knew that\u2026 Tears clogged the back of her throat. The turmoil she felt in her heart, pierced it like jagged thorns. She was strong but delicate at the same time.Leah blinked and inhaled the cool air. The musky scent of manliness from Ishakan wafted into her nose at their close proximity. She tried to reign in herself, warning him.\u201cDon\u2019t sympathize with me if you will not take any responsibility.\u201d\u201cSympathy? You\u2019re talking nonsense.\u201d He said in gritted teeth.\u201cIs that not our lovemaking?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d As if his words were jarred in his throat, Ishakan remained silent. Leah broke loose from his grip; it was as if she were freeing herself from him, both emotionally and physically. As Leah turned back, Ishakan grabbed her again.\u201cLet go of me!\u201dHowever, Ishakan did not release her. Leah struggled, hitting his chest, and trying to twist away from his body. She hated Ishakan for toying with her. For bothering her and creating a mess for her to clean up. For disrupting the peace she had tried so hard to maintain.But above all, she hated herself for letting Ishakan drag her around.The difference in their strength was like heaven and earth. Ishakan simply overpowered her, forcing her to give up on her incessant struggle.He opened his mouth, his voice cracking. \u201cI\u2026\u201dLeah glared at him. The golden eyes that were filled with anger a while ago had subsided.\u201cIf I say that I\u2019ll take responsibility\u2026\u201d Her strength left. The fight inside her dissipated as she held her breath.As if he were under a spell, Ishakan fixed his gaze on Leah, unblinking. The next words that he uttered with cautiousness was a confirmation of their relationship.\u201cThen, what will you do?\u201d***Blain only stared unmoving at the empty chair. However, no matter how long he looked at it, he knew she would never return. Time would not unwind, and the person was no longer here.His teeth bit down hard on his frozen lips, and words of resentment came out.\u201cHuh\u2026darn it.\u201dEven though the king was seated right next to him, he could care less, and cursed.BANG.The table shook as he poured his rage, clattering the porcelain tableware. Untouched sandwiches and delicacies toppled over, crashing into the other food on the table. A wine glass rolled over and smashed to the floor.The sharp piercing sound of glass colliding with the ground and shattering fuelled Blain\u2019s fury.Immediately, he grabbed the edge of the cloth, and dragged the whole thing off the edge of the table. Along with it, came all the tableware and finely served food.BANG!CRASH.PANG!Blain cursed and threw the remaining glasses and plates everywhere. Sharp forks and knives flew behind the maids on standby. However, they fortunately were able to dodge the onslaught of silver.No one was able to stop Blain.Even the king did not say anything and only witnessed his actions, anxiously. It was only when Cerdina returned to the luncheon that Blain, who was venting his anger, ceased his destruction.In a new, elegant dress, and a powdered face, Cerdina came back looking in her usual regality. She no longer smelt like she was drenched in alcohol, rather, the essence of jasmine from a fragrant perfume emanated off her body.Regaining her elegant composure, she returned to the luncheon and looked at the hollow seating where Leah and Ishakan had once sat at. But they had long disappeared, only Blain and the king remained.Seeing her son like this, she pressed her hand on her chest.\u201cBlain\u2026\u201dThe king, who was overjoyed upon seeing her return, was not even acknowledged by Cerdina. Only Blain was in her sight. He panted heavily, and slowly raised his eyes to meet hers.\u201cI certainly thought it was mine, but apparently, it wasn\u2019t.\u201dHe muttered with trembling eyes. The state of insanity he was in, was clear as day. \u201cIt seems that even if I were to become king, I cannot beat him. It\u2019s not enough to just be King of Estia.\u201dHis eyes shone, a wicked delusion formed in his ice-cold irises. His pupils dilated, overflowing with crazed delirium. A smile stretched across his lips, distorting his face.\u201cIf only I had more power.\u201d The sinister tone that underlies his voice conveyed his evil intentions to the full.At his statement, Cerdina\u2019s eyes widened. However, her reaction was not because it pained her to see her beloved child suffering.Rather\u2026\u201cYes, my beloved Blain\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOverwhelming joy filled her as she whispered her agreement, understanding his thoughts immediately.

His words were pointless, and in this situation, politics and love combined would only lead to one thing\u2014disaster.Neither of them could find the proper words to say. It was a tug of war. The delicate line could be crossed at any time, but neither was willing to let go of the rope.Even if he sounded implausible, some parts of her wanted to believe him. She wanted so bad to place her trust in Ishakan.However, she only felt ridiculous. How could she possibly trust the enemy of her country? Their goals were clashing against each other, and their hearts divided for their own people. On one hand, Ishakan was the most powerful king of the Kurkans, whilst on the other, Leah was all but a helpless princess, trying her best to save her country.She was a fool. Every time she was with him, she always became like this. Her normal reasoning and logic vanished in front of him, replaced with the temptation and emotional impulses.To do what her heart desired was what she wanted the most\u2014to wear the beautiful purple silk dress Ishakan had gifted her, to enjoy her meal in peace at the luncheon in an amicable atmosphere.She desired to claim the glory of her contributions, wished for people to recognize that it was her who strives to abolish slavery and not the crown prince.Such simple desires that Leah had been repressing because of the etiquette and discipline she had to abide by.Ever since she had met him, Ishakan had only been inciting the rebel in her. The unkindled feelings that should have passed without a spark turned into huge flames.It was hard to withstand the burning urge to let herself go, to sate those innermost feelings and unbridled desires.Ishakan was the fuel, powerful enough to cause the spark to erupt into a blaze, against her wishes.When Countess Melissa heard what had happened at the palace, she became immensely upset, for Leah\u2019s sake. The situation regarding the purple silk dress especially, made her extremely troubled. Such a gorgeous and delicate dress, that money could not buy, was stolen and ruined before Leah could even touch it.Melissa wanted to immediately find out the culprit, but the princess pacified her first.\u201cI have my reason as to why I told you about this. I wanted to get over this issue.\u201d\u201cBut, princess\u2026!\u201d\u201cAs the head servant, I want you to take the lead, so the maids will not become divided. I know what I\u2019m asking of you is hard, but\u2026\u201d Leah held Countess Melissa\u2019s hand and looked up with her deep violet eyes. It was a plea.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf there was a maid who sold me out to earn a fortune, I\u2019m certain it\u2019s because of inevitable circumstances that caused them to do that. I will leave soon anyway\u2026 No matter what the queen does, we just have to put up with it.\u201dCountess Melissa did not answer and only sealed her lips tight. With a ashen face, she forced herself to open her mouth.\u201cHow can they not let you rest?\u201d Her dry, wrinkled hand covered her face. Melissa remained silent for a while.\u201c\u2026If only I came from a family with more power.\u201dThe words that she whispered seemed to be full of remorse. Whenever something bad happened to Leah, Countess Melissa had always blamed herself. She felt so sorry for the princess, and the countless injustices she had to put up with.\u201cCountess.\u201d\u201cI apologize. I spoke improperly in front of Your Highness.\u201d\u201cNo, I am the one at fault here. I am undeserving to have you.\u201d Leah approached the countess and opened her arms. Countess Melissa immediately hugged Leah.Sighing deeply, she uttered, \u201cNo, I am unworthy to have a master like you. You are the only one I have, who I can count on.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, Melissa.\u201d\u201cHer Highness might ask me to serve another master once you leave the palace, but I hate the idea.\u201dLeah faintly smiled as if she knew what Melissa was saying. Countess Melissa was prepared, wanting to change the topic.The princess\u2019 destiny was already written in stone\u2014she was promised to Byun Gyeongbaek and people were already anticipating the reunion. Melissa couldneverchange this. This was the power she lacked and faulted herself for.Leah recalled her final choice\u2014death over a miserable life ahead of her\u2014and prayed that it would not bring Melissa too much misery. As soon as she thought of her upcoming repose, a voice suddenly popped out of her head.\u201cIf I say that I\u2019ll take responsibility\u2026then, what will you do?\u201dHis words lingered in her head, like a troublesome bug leaving her restless. It kept flying around her steadily, no matter how hard she tried to shoo it off.His voice, eyes, and nose atop shapely lips\u2026The gentle and sincere expression on his face\u2014everything came to life in her mind. She could trace his smooth jaw, the arch of his brows, and deep-seated eyes with her own.Recalling these unwanted memories, a realization struck her. All along, her heart had been wanting something\u2026 She wanted to live.***The aristocrats of the society, who mingled amongst each other in the hall, were greatly satisfied of the gossips surrounding the scandalous welcome banquet for the Kurkans.The gossipmongers indulged in the story between the King of the Kurkans and the Princess of Estia. Just the thought of Estia\u2019s flower, and the young and strong barbarian king interacting, was enough to make a controversial picture.The royal daughter, with her vivid violet eyes, was a noble figure envied by all aristocrats\u2014especially of women. There were quite a few nobles who were dissatisfied with the fact that she had even become the fianc\u00e9 of the old but powerful Byun Gyongbaek.\u201cBut the barbarian king appeared like fresh meat! Everyone is looking forward to seeing Byun Gyongbaek boil in anger.\u201d Count Valtein was so excited that he bragged about the gossip of the social circles.\u201cYour beauty is outstanding, but I do not know how Kurkans perceive Estian beauty. I am interested if they find me\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUpon noticing the glare of Finance Minister Laurent, Count Valtein stopped with his bragging. Even if his tongue remained itching to speak, he ended up halting and changing the topic.He took a small velvet box wrapped in a pink ribbon out of his pocket. Then, he proceeded to untie and proudly opened it as he nudged it towards the center of the tabletop. The inside contents were revealed, laid out on peach tissue paper.It was an unfamiliar sight to the person being presented it with, Minister Laurent.Count Valtein puffed his chest with pride and arrogantly spoke. \u201cThis is the latest trend.\u201d He held the box as if it contained a mysterious and precious jewel.\u201cDate palms?\u201d was the minister\u2019s confused reply.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Would you like to try one? This is dried palm that Kurkans eat. I had a hard time looking for this.\u201dCount Valtein flamboyantly displayed his expertise in date palm eating etiquette. \u201cEating this is quite difficult. You must learn the proper way! Trying it once or twice without the correct technique will waste the dates. I assure you, many are unaware of this method.\u201dThe unique and interesting goods piqued Finance Minister Laurent\u2019s interest. He took the fork he was using for refreshment, picked up a date and ate it. Then he drank the tea straight away.\u201cOh no, it is quite a bit of sugar\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not sugar! Date palms are naturally sweet.\u201dDespite the count\u2019s rebuttal, Finance Minister Laurent, could not easily iron out the frown on his forehead. Count Valtein smiled as he watched the minister drink his second cup of tea.Even though Valtein detested sweet things, he had eaten two dates already\u2014just like season, his taste bud changes. Leah, who was with them, could only look at him in astonishment.\u201cI think this is popular nowadays because it is good for one\u2019s vigor,\u201d Valtein continued to praise the sweets.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhile they were eating, Ishakan\u2019s memory of eating the dates suddenly popped into Leah\u2019s head. Imagining the man, she hurriedly shook it off.The culture of Kurkans was getting popular in Estia these days. The foreign customs had been quite appealing to the aristocrats who were awfully fond of new entertainment.From the ruler\u2019s perspective, it would not be favourable. However, the more one tries to suppress the people from doing something they wanted to try, the more they wound it fascinating. Thus, preventing the Kurkan culture in becoming a trend was not an option.All they could do was wait for the Kurkans to return to the dessert after negotiations took place, thus taking the trend with them.Count Valtein offered the dates to Leah, but the latter only refused to eat them. She instead sipped some lightly brewed black tea and raised the main topic she wanted to tackle.\u201cWhat happened to the favor I asked of you?\u201cYes, princess.\u201d Count Valtein immediately put down his teacup. \u201cI found out the Kurkans are currently moving in Estia with three divisions.\u201dThe first was tasked to meet and appease the key figures of the kingdom. They had already seen this in action. The Kurkans had taken the initiative to approach Count Valtein.The second was to track down gypsies and arrest them. In the first place, the relationship between the Kurkans and the gypsies was already marred. However, there appeared to be more than meets the eye for their conflict.\u201cThe last one was the same as what the princess had expected. They have been looking for the Kurkan slaves that had been captured here in Estia.\u201dLeah nodded as she heard the words of Count Valtein. Slavery was illegal. However, in the face of money, the law did not exist. There was an immense demand for Kurkan slavery, they were strong and valuable. Slave dealers would illegally capture them, and sell them off, making a fortune.\u201cTherefore, did you do what I instructed?\u201d\u201cOf course. It will proceed as you wish.\u201dA smile grew on Leah\u2019s face. Upon seeing her satisfied expression, Count Valtein brightened like a child who had just been praised.\u201cCount Valtein did a great deed for us. Because of that, it gives us at least a chance to get out of the negotiations.\u201d Finance Minister Laurent spoke his opinion with a dark face.\u201cHowever, is not the negotiation too hard to achieve right now? That incident at the palace, which should not have happened, did after all.\u201d After hearing the catastrophe that had occurred in the queen\u2019s Palace, she had almost given up.It wasn\u2019t because she couldn\u2019t understand the Finance Minister. In fact, it was only normal to react that way.\u201cWe should try utilizing it well. As you are aware, we cannot just idly stand by and do nothing.\u201dLeah looked at them one by one. She clearly stated her next thoughts, emphasizing how important it was to be on good terms with the Kurkans.\u201cThe treaty is the last chance for Estia.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCount Valtein and Finance Minister Laurent sighed heavily and nodded in agreement.Minister Lurent seemed to contemplate deeply for a while, before speaking up.\u201cWe are already helpless once you go, princess. Even if we could negotiate the deal, how can we lead a decaying country among ourselves?\u201d\u201cI cannot properly sleep these days because of that. Does the queen really think that the Crown Prince can handle all of this?\u201d\u201cMaybe. Perhaps it is because the Crown Prince himself is atrocious and ambitious.\u201d\u201cI do not know why the prince behaves so foolishly, while his mother behaves like a fox.\u201dCount Valtein, who was unintentionally complaining, immediately checked his surroundings. He had just insulted two of the most powerful people in Estia in one statement.After confirming that the maids were nowhere in sight, he laughed mischievously, like a child caught acting suspiciously.\u201cI think that the queen will regret it once you are gone. She will be hitting the soil, full of remorse, and immediately summon you back.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt appeared that they were not alone in their thoughts. The Minister of Finance, Laurent furtively nodded with Count Valtein\u2019s passionate speech\u2014saying that Leah should not forgive the queen even if she knelt on her knees.Count Valtein only stopped babbling after Leah raised her hands. She softly sighed and he wrinkled her nose, confused as to whether he had stated something wrong.\u201cCount Valtein.\u201dHis eyes were wide open as he listened to her words that followed.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of locating the slaves by myself.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The haze covered the moon, so not even a single beam of light was able to seep through the sky. Deep darkness fell over Estia, shrouding the place in mystery. It was a night where one would be uneasy to go out alone.A small lamp lit the road in front of the carriage. Its flame was blazing, however, it was not enough to make the pathway visible.The horseman at the front of the carriages in line, swiveled his head, cautiously keeping watch of his surroundings with his eyes. After many years of experience wandering, he knew enough to recognize when one should never ignore their intuition.Today, the horseman felt unusually unnerved. He felt an irresistible urge to flee from the carriage and escape into the night. He wished to quickly get out of the dreary forest they were passing through, but the dense trees seemed to be infinite.Since a while ago, the mercenaries who were escorting the carriages, had been feeling the ominous atmosphere of the surrounding forest. They kept a constant grip on the sheath of their swords, should any abrupt attack occur.\u201cBloody hell!\u201dThe horseman cursed as he pulled the horse\u2019s bridle to a stop. He tried to whip them several times, but the horses did not slow down. They continued to whine as if frightened by a ghastly creature.He was helpless, only able to look ahead of him, terrified. Suddenly, a sharp whistle whipped through the air. The horseman\u2019s eyes bulged at the sound, realizing too late what it was.\u201cAhhh, it\u2019s the barbarians!\u201dHe yelled out a split second later, however, the black shadows fell from the sky. They climbed atop the carriages, like crazed beasts, in a cunning attack. Their bright eyes glowed horrifyingly in the dark, and from the light in their eyes, the protruding teeth of their grin could be seen. A satisfied smirk was plastered on their faces.The mercenaries shrieked and pulled out their swords. However, their reaction was nothing against the Kurkans, who, like lightning, jumped down from the carriage. As quick as they had come, in the next second the sounds of flesh tearing and bodies thudding to the ground was immediately heard. The cracking of bones followed, as the Kurkans wrecked a blood bath amongst the mercenaries.\u201cUghh\u2026\u201dThe horseman barely managed to crawl out of the carriage. Around him, all kinds of horrific sounds of pain and slaughter pierced his ears. The shrieks were haunting. He covered his mouth with his hand whilst trembling, forcing himself to not scream. Suddenly, a whoosh of cold air hit him as the carriage that hid his body was turned over.The smell of death permeated the frigid air. Only corpses lay around him. He watched as his mercenary companion looked up at the sky and then spurted blood, the last the mercenary saw being faces that were just like his. With a thud, the horseman watched, terrified, as he collapsed to the forest ground unmoving. It would be where he would be buried. The mercenary\u2019s hot blood flowed to the soil beneath him slowly, his body grew cold.Against the occluded moon, the silhouette of a man with a muscular build was illuminated. He languidly glared at the woman who stepped over the bodies, ignoring the frozen horseman and peaked inside an upturned carriage. Undoubtedly, if one saw his bright topaz eyes, they would recognize him as the leader of the pack.\u201cIshakan.\u201dA giant woman handed a tobacco leaf to the man. While she was nursing the others, a slender man diligently searched the wagons with the other Kurkans. The man who had been confirming the faces of the slaves one by one with a lamp to illuminate them, suddenly exclaimed.\u201cIt is not here!\u201d\u201c\u2026Another vain attempt?\u201dThe man grew silent for a moment as he smoked the leaf tobacco, the aftertaste was soothing in this quiet bloody night. He slowly muttered as he released the smoke of the leaf tobacco.\u201cAmazing. I was pretty sure that it was accurate information that was provided though.\u201dHis head tilted and he locked his gaze on the horseman. The moment the horseman was observed from afar with those piercing, blazing eyes, he was rendered mute in fright. Even if he wanted to scream, not a single syllable could be uttered. His legs were stuck against his will and he could not run from the fear he felt.The horseman felt a warm liquid drip down the inner parts of his thigh, it seemed that he had soiled his pants with urine.Ishakan smirked. His golden eyes glinted as he raised an eyebrow at the horseman, taunting him like a predator.\u201cDo you know anything about this?\u201dThe horseman\u2019s teeth chattered. He shook uncontrollably, as he faced the terrifying man before him, however, he knew if he were to stop here, the forest would become his burial ground. The words spilled out of him in a mumble, as he forced his mouth open to utter coherent syllables.\u201cT-the other slave dealers\u2026\u201d\u201cDid another slave dealer buy and take away the Kurkans?\u201d\u201cY-yes\u2026\u201dIshakan narrowed his eyes. He was locked in his thoughts and cocked his head to the side. Then he looked up and nodded his head at the woman on the side.\u201cPlease spare me. I am just driving the wagon\u2026This should probably be enough to pay for my sins.\u201dThe woman curtly nodded her head and suddenly raised her fist.THUD!She struck the back of the horseman\u2019s head. Immediately, he fainted without a sound.Ishakan, who was staring at the horseman in front, briefly asked.\u201cIs he dead?\u201d\u201cYou did a good job of controlling your strength, Ishakan.\u201d She gestured to their surroundings.Haban fidgeted in response to Genin\u2019s naive answer and added.\u201cI think he\u2019s dead.\u201d\u201cNo. He\u2019s not dead yet.\u201dAs their shallow quarrel ensued, Haban proceeded to check the pulse of the horseman. There was nothing interesting to conclude.\u201cHe\u2019s not dead.\u201dHaban dubiously titled his head and clicked his tongue. Genin raised the tip of her chin, beckoning him, as if to affirm her strength. Ishakan, who laughed at their silent bickering, smoked his tobacco and said.\u201cIs he the third?\u201dHaban stomped his feet as he spoke with a red face.\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t seem like a coincidence.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euCurrently, Ishakan was tracking the Kurkans enslaved in Estia. He had already found out the whereabouts of the Kurkans who were sold to aristocrats and wealthy merchants.Amidst catching the Kurkans, who were in danger of being caught and sold, they unexpectedly encountered multiple difficulties. Each lead would result in failure, by mere hours. It was the most frustrating difficulty they constantly faced in tracking them down.It was confirmed the Kurkans were bought and the queue of slave dealers was pinned down, however, following the route of their trade was a maze. Each time, the reason was the same. Another slave dealer would buy the Kurkans right before they could free them.This was the third time they had missed the opportunity, by a short time interval.\u201cI think that someone must be moving one step ahead of us.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ishakan tacitly pacified Haban whose self-esteem was hurt.\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Haban. It\u2019s only because even the Tomaris might be interfering too.\u201dIt was difficult because the gypsies were also after the slave dealers. Nevertheless, Haban did his best.\u201cThis situation is far greater than merely your inability. Rather, it\u2019s because someone else is acting fast. They\u2019re moving quickly so as to avoid us catching up.\u201d Ishakan appeared to be thinking deeply.\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of slave dealers they are. How about solving these guys first?\u201d Haban took out a leaf cigarette and put it in his lips.After puffing the smoke, he talked. \u201cHow could we find them?\u201d\u201cWe move faster.\u201dHaban\u2019s eyes widened in shock. He faced Genin with a confounded face and carefully asked again.\u201c\u2026Are you okay? We are doing our fastest while keeping our moves discreet.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no choice. We have to be inside the auction house, and find them there. We have to be early, at least an hour before them.\u201dIshakan laughed. As he smoked through the darkness, he could see how much blood would spill on their attack, how much blood would paint his hands. Genin, who knew their king\u2019s ferocity in fighting, specially against the people who enslaved their kind, looked at him with her brows raised.In response, Ishakan said in a tone which made the air more chilly.\u201cWhat? You know that I\u2019m good at self-control, right?\u201d\u2654It was the first Cabinet Council meeting since the Kurkan\u2019s Welcome Banquet. Only Leah was present on behalf of the royal family at the meeting. The king had said that he was tired, and the Crown Prince did not attend because he was preoccupied with a hunt. This was a frequent occurrence though, so everyone was accustomed to his absence.The atmosphere of the Cabinet Council meeting was tense. It was as if a knife had sliced the air. Finance Minister Laurent breathed in deeply, and cleared his throat. The tension on his face was clear as day.\u201cWe must make a reform on the current tax system.\u201dThe moment that he spoke the opening sentence, the whole committee erupted into chaos. Leah glanced around the conference hall, her stoic blank expression concealed her thoughts. The majority of the council members present, heavily objected to the idea. Stating it was complete nonsense and a reform was useless to the Estian economy, they unilaterally opposed.\u201cWhether the bill will be passed or not, it will be decided after the peace treaty. Today, the explanation for the reform\u2026\u201dAs the Finance Minister continued, the mood that settled over the conference grew darker. Everyone deep in their own thoughts, racking their brain on how to deal with the peace treaty. It was a delicate relationship that could be broken unfavourably at any moment, towards Estia.Leah scornfully laughed deep inside. She knew that this meeting was a deliberate act to give them more time. Until the reform plans were approved, after the negotiations took place, the opposition party needed to gather their strength.Leah was determined \u2013 she had to put an end to this. That way, peace could be maintained for a long time even without her being present in Estia. It would be her last duty towards her country. After the motion for the reform ended, Leah opened her mouth. Her voice spoke loudly and clearly in the midst of the tumultuous discussion in the meeting hall.\u201cThere is one thing I need to inform all of you.\u201dThe aristocrats stopped talking all at once and turned to face Leah.\u201cWe are going to step up our surveillance of the slave traders and launch a major crackdown. This is also to successfully achieve a peace treaty with the Kurkans.\u201dIn normal circumstances, the aristocrats would grumble about why they had to care about the slave dealers for the Kurkans. However, today, an atmosphere full of sympathy arose. Some even suggested finding the Kurkan slaves and releasing them themselves.The reality was that everyone had received a bribe. Leah carefully identified the aristocrats who had been hostile to the Kurkans in the past but had suddenly changed their stance. It seemed like she had to focus on them.After the cabinet meeting ended, the aristocrats gathered and talked, furthering an elaboration of the discussions that had taken place prior. Leah also had a conversation with the Finance Minister Laurent and Count Valtein.\u201cThank you for your hard work.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, princess\u2026\u201dShe comforted the rather haggard finance minister. Laurent stroked his chest as he said. \u201cMy mission will not end here. Are you going to the slave traders tonight?\u201dLeah nodded, answered back a \u2018yes\u2019, but Count Valtein drew a disgusted face as he secretly whispered.\u201cByun Gyongbaek is coming. He is coming.\u201dIndeed, Byun Gyongbaek of Oberde was walking forward on crutches. He diligently approached Leah whilst limping. They were currently in a place where other aristocrats were gathered, so he probably came here on purpose to show others that his relationship with Leah was fine.The Finance Minister and Count Valtein stepped back with a disgruntled expression, allowing Byun Gyongbaek of Oberde to approach them. He looked up, a nasty grin on his face and casually greeted the three.\u201cIt has been silent for a while.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe was indeed a shameless guy. She wondered how someone could be so impudent. Leah silently looked at him. However, Byun did not feel bothered by Leah\u2019s defiance. He continued his idle talk, taking up their time.\u201cSecurely lock your bedroom tonight and fasten the latch of the window. It would be better if you put a pane on it. Place lamps around your area in the Royal Palace, and command your maids not to sleep\u2026\u201dShe was amazed at the way he was babbling. Leah could not stand it anymore and cut him off.\u201cByun Gyongbaek of Oberde. What do you want to say to me?\u201dByun was enraged. The implication behind Leah\u2019s words echoed to him:\u201cGo away.\u201d\u201cIs this not the fault of the barbarians in the Royal Palace? You are all fooled because of their gorgeous shells!\u201dHe then swiveled around and raised his voice. \u201cAren\u2019t the aristocrats too, busy praising and following the barbarians?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe statement was meant to catch the attention of the aristocrats present in the conference hall.\u201cThe peace treaty\u2014don\u2019t so foolishly proceed with such a ridiculous thing. Princess, you are naive. You are unaware of how superficial a treaty is, merely pen on paper. It is insignificant and will not be of value.\u201dWhen Leah only stared quietly at him void of the reaction he wanted to incite from her, Byun Gyongbaek\u2019s forehead creased.\u201cAnyway, I will send my knights over to the Royal Palace. I shall order them to safeguard you through the night, so please accept one guard today.\u201dThen without bidding his goodbye, he turned and left, rudely leaving behind his advice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Auction House (1)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Eyljee--------\u201cWhat was that\u2026?\u201dCount Valtein, who had previously stepped back to allow Byun Gyongbaek to join them, approached Leah and spoke.\u201cDid he also hit his head when he broke his legs?\u201d Valtein asked incredulously for the behavior he had just witnessed.\u201cI think so. He\u2019s even thinking of sending his knights to the Royal Palace! No matter how much he ignores the royal family, that\u2019s too much.\u201dCount Valtein then explained that for such matters, there were universal laws and orders. All of which Byun had just broken.He had stuck his nose into the affairs of royalty, where he was not wanted, and neither was he needed. At his side, the Minister of Finance also became angry at the blatant disrespect and intrusion.However, unlike the two who were angry and cursing quietly, Leah only had a scowl expression, not verbally addressing the matter.This was not the first time Byun Gyongbaek had committed such an impertinent act, nor it was the second! The fact that he continued to do so disgusted her. He was completely contemptible and arrogant, assuming his flirtation with Leah would be successful.Although they had not yet wed, he acted as if Leah was a trophy of his possession. She sighed in despair. This was her destiny, and for her country, she had to endure it.However, Byun had been treating the Kurkan badly. He hated them deeply, refusing to call them anything but \u2018barbarians\u2019 and cursing his kind to the tomb.But despite all this, Byun Gyongbaek knew the Kurkan better than anyone else. Therefore, his rude words to them were not meaningless. There must have been an incident that had caused even the bold and shameless Byun to be so horrified.However, the Kurkan who had been captured as slaves had never shown any unusual behavior. Perhaps it was a Kurkan who was not enslaved.Therefore, it would have been good if Byun had shared with them his current information about the fascinating race, but he had already left the conference room.\u201cFirst of all, let Byun Gyongbaek from Oberde do what he wants.\u201d She ordered with resignation.Since the treaty negotiation would soon be over, Byun should be stressed out right now. Therefore, it was better to let him get away with it and not cause additional problems. It was also one of the ways to assure him that he could still use the royal family as his puppet.Besides that, if Byun stubbornly pressed, the royal family wouldn\u2019t be able to stop him. It would be bad for them to oppose him directly.Even when Leah had returned to her quarters, Byun Gyongbaek\u2019s words that seemed to warn of an impending disaster continued to pop into her head. She could not forget them, and throughout her afternoon schedule, she reflected on those words.After a simple dinner, Countess Melissa met with Leah alone. Leah intended to go out for the night, so she had to prepare.As usual, Countess Melissa had combed Leah\u2019s hair today. The delicate and thin strands of her hair crossed each other in a braid. The braids were held together with pins, and she cleverly hid her silver braided hair with a brown wig.Leah looked at herself in the mirror and suddenly, the memory of the time she had slipped away from the royal palace came to her mind. Back then, she had also worn a wig and discreetly left the walls that confined her. From that point on, her life was thrown into chaos. It was the first time she met Ishakan. \u2013 This novel is translated by NovelUtopia\u201cPrincess?\u201dLeah came to her senses when Countess Melissa called her. Her motionless, unemotional stance worried Countess Melissa, who feared the princess was ill.Every time Leah had slipped out of the palace, Countess Melissa was anxious. She couldn\u2019t help but think that something serious might happen to the princess outside the palace walls. She looked like a mother, watching her daughter venture out for the first time, leaving the safety of the nest behind.\u201cDo you really need to get involved in this?\u201d Countess Melissa expressed her concern and care for Leah.\u201cAs you know\u2026 the Count cannot solve this alone.\u201d Leah responded, shaking her head gently.Instead of rebutting, Countess Melissa just gently patted the dust off the robe Leah was wearing. Leah smiled softly as she looked at the Countess\u2019 pretty disgruntled face.\u201cI leave it in your hands, Countess,\u201d Leah smiled.\u201cOf course. Don\u2019t worry, Princess. Please come back safely.\u201d Countess Melissa nodded her head, her eyes telling Leah she could trust her.After saying goodbye to Countess Melissa, Leah entered a hidden passage that was hidden behind her bedroom closet.The cold wind hit her when she finally emerged from the dark and secret passage. The oil lamp she was holding faintly illuminated some steps in front of her, as she reached the door to the outside of the palace.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLeah looked up at the sky. Unlike yesterday, which was overcast, tonight\u2019s sky was clear. The moon in particular, was exceptionally big today. The round white moon floated in the sky, emitting a comforting light as if it were a commander, superior to all the stars.On a normal occasion, seeing this view would make Leah think it was simply beautiful. However, perhaps because of the words Byun Gyongbaek had spoken at the Cabinet Council meeting, she felt that the silvery rays of the moonlight were sinister and gloomy. Then, a fog covered the full moon that she was staring at.Finally, she began to move. She couldn\u2019t stay still in this place forever, because she had a task to accomplish.A black carriage without the family crest was waiting for her near the entrance of the one that had appeared. When she gently touched the window of the carriage, the thick curtain inside the window moved. After confirming that it really was Leah from the inside, Count Valtein opened the door.\u201cYou have arrived. Now we are leaving.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Auction House (2)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Eyljee--------\u201cI feel safe knowing that you are here. Perhaps if I were alone, I would feel very uneasy\u2026 Please accept this.\u201d Count Valtein murmured.He pulled out the mask he had prepared for her disguise. It was a simple black mask, but it was big enough to cover her whole face. With his help, Leah put the mask on securely, completing her change.\u201cI wish we could end all this today.\u201d\u201cYes, I hope so too. I get nervous easily, so I hope I don\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201dCount Valtein said quietly. His heart was pounding with nervousness, so much that it seemed to be about to explode. The auction in which they would participate today was very big and infamous, where several slave traders gathered to show their merchandise. The massive participation meant that the number of slaves at the auction was far from small.In fact, the news about the large-scale repression that had been announced that same day during the Cabinet Council meeting, had already begun to circulate within the circle of the slave traders. Leah had purposely leaked that information to force the slave traders to start a massive auction before the investigations began.Leah had worked hard to provoke today\u2019s auction, hoping that her efforts under the table would bear fruit.\u201cDon\u2019t get too nervous, Count Valtein.\u201dAlthough she was reassuring Valtein, Leah was also nervous. After all, they had been preparing for this for a long time. If today\u2019s operation failed, future plans would become even more difficult. No matter what the circumstances were, they had to succeed.The carriage went to a discreet and antiquated mansion located on the outskirts of the capital. The two-story mansion with a garden, did not have a large size. Joyful melodies were heard coming from the interior. The stage was like a common dance hall.However, the atmosphere at the back of the mansion contrasted sharply with the front. The guards, armed with exposed swords, fiercely guarded the door. Their terrifying stature spoke of the secret and illegal events that took place beyond the steel bars.The carriage stopped at the back door. Count Valtein took a deep breath and then got out of the carriage first. Then, he helped Leah out of the carriage.The guards looked menacingly at Leah and Count Valtein. Their wild, unconventional glances made Valtein tremble. Yet Leah was with him, and this mission, which had not even begun, depended on this very moment.Then he took out a gold coin from his pocket and showed it to them. It was a special coin that was imprinted with an insignia that allowed them the right of entry. The guards checked the pattern on the front and back of the coin, then placed it on a scale to weigh it. It was perfect. The coin balanced the weight of the pendulum precisely.\u201cWelcome.\u201dWith somber faces, the guards opened the door and received them politely. As soon as they entered, an employee appeared to help and guide them.The first floor of the mansion was mediocre. The interior was decorated with simplicity, nothing interesting to see for the casual observers. However, as they went down the stairs leading to the basement, a complex corridor appeared. It was a maze in which anyone could easily get lost, if not guided. Count Valtein whispered quietly to Leah.\u201cThis inspection seems to be getting more thorough. In fact, it is quite frightening.\u201d After saying those words, he immediately closed his mouth.The couple and the guide walked through the maze. Finally, after a long time since they descended, they were escorted to a very brightly lit reception room. The reception was well organized and decorated, very different from the insipid first floor. The two saw a table with diet soda, tea and wine. \u2013 This novel is translated by NovelUtopiaThe clerk abruptly left them both and returned to the maze. Count Valtein went to the drinks and started drinking wine to moisten his tense throat. Suddenly, someone knocked on the door, and soon after, a voice was heard from outside the room.\u201cCan you give me a moment? There\u2019s something you should check out about today\u2019s product.\u201dCount Valtein immediately lowered his glass and stood up. He put on his mask, which was slightly crooked, and spoke solemnly.\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201dAs she stood alone, Leah looked around the room. The furniture was luxurious even though it was a temporary rental place. She looked at the furniture one by one as she waited for Count Valtein. The black tea, which she hadn\u2019t had a sip of, had gone cold long ago.The floor clock was ticking, as the minutes passed. After confirming that the cup was cold, Leah got up from the old armchair she was sitting in, waiting for Count Valtein\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCount Valtein was taking too long. Without hesitation, she headed for the door. As her hand reached out to grab the doorknob, she suddenly smelled a sweet, minty scent.A whispered instruction came from behind his back.\u201cStop.\u201dWhen she was in the room, Leah didn\u2019t feel even the slightest movement, much less the presence of another person.A cold tingling sensation ran through her neck, when something sharp touched her. A small and sharp dagger was pressing against her delicate skin. Even the slightest force, would cause the blade to tear his skin immediately.The low voice immediately commanded him.\u201cDo not move.\u201dBefore she gave that order, Leah was already frozen.That strong and unique male smell was something she would recognize anywhere. The familiar smell and deep voice made her heart skip.\u201cTurn slowly.\u201dLeah slowly turned around. The man standing in front of her suddenly hesitated, torn between pulling the dagger from her neck. Moments later, he pulled the blade away from her skin then grabbed her chin sharply. After a moment of silence, he slid Leah\u2019s mask off.\u201c\u2026Leah?\u201dIshakan stared at her with a puzzled expression. Leah couldn\u2019t respond and just blinked her eyes. She wasn\u2019t ready to see him again. Her heart was pounding as if about to burst, due to this sudden and unexpected encounter.\u201cWhy are you here\u2026?\u201dIshakan could not take his eyes off her. He was clearly agitated and murmured in surprise.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHave you been kidnapped?\u201dHis golden pupils turned cold at once. Before Ishakan turned the auction house upside down, Leah quickly opened her mouth.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that\u2026\u201dHer tongue felt heavy.

Full Moon Night (1)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Eyljee--------\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSilence filled the air. His mind seemed unable to comprehend Leah\u2019s words, which left him speechless. After a few moments of contemplation, Ishakan slowly came out of his confusion, understanding her words. His golden eyes fixed on the small face in front of him, and he managed to open his mouth.\u201c\u2026Do you have business to attend to in this place?\u201dIshakan\u2019s eyes turned to the black mask that had fallen to the ground. When she removed it from her face, he never imagined that the princess was hiding behind it. The pupils of her golden eyes were slowly narrowing, turning cat-like.He turned again to look at Leah. His fierce eyes became narrow slits.\u201cYou have to give me a convincing explanation, Leah.\u201dHe turned again to look at Leah, still wearing his fierce expression.Leah took a deep breath. She felt as if a weight had been placed on her chest, prohibiting her from breathing freely. In front of this man, she became rigid and could not breathe properly. Leah could feel a burning sensation under his touch, where his warm hand was planted on her arm.She calmed down and opened her lips, looking directly at Ishakan. However, nothing came out of her mouth. Her tongue felt heavy, unable to move. Fear left her speechless. She could not speak.\u201cAhm.\u201dIshakan breathed a sigh. Then, when she least expected it, he wrapped her in a tight hug and sat her on his lap. The delicate princess of Estia was once again, beside the King of Kurkan, as she had been many days before. She could feel the warmth emanating from him, warming her up.Then he ran his fingers over her frozen cheeks. Her high body temperature felt good on her face, returning her pale skin to a bright pink color. Ishakan\u2019s sharp expression, slowly softened.\u201cI think I overdid it.\u201d He whispered softly.The sensation of his warm breath reminded her that she had to breathe. Leah realized how loving this man had been with her.The true nature of the Kurkan was like the sharp claw of a beast. At any moment, they could reach out and cause serious harm. Therefore, Ishakan\u2019s behavior was quite unusual.The way he looked at her contrasted with the expression he had when relating to others. He had a weakness for her, despite being a man capable of making others cower out of fear.\u201cI know you\u2019re not that kind of person.\u201dWhen these words reached her ears, Leah could only blink twice. Deeply absorbed in his golden eyes, she completely forgot the dazzling dilemma she was facing!Orienting herself, she spoke confidently, disguising her nervousness. \u201cWhat happened earlier\u2026 was quite unpleasant. Maybe now, you feel a little better?\u201dIshakan bowed his head and nodded. A small laugh escaped his lips as he lightly caressed Leah\u2019s cheeks with his two fingers. Under the warmth of his touch, her body relaxed.The time had come for her to explain to Ishakan why she had come to this place.For a long time, Leah had been trying to eradicate the slave traders. However, despite many attempts at repression, raids and arrests, the traders did not relent. She could not see an end to this illicit business. Even if she caught one trader and freed the slaves, another would always appear. She was far outnumbered.This was a problem that would never be solved unless she attacked the core of the matter. \u2013 This novel is translated by NovelUtopiaLeah concluded that the demand for slaves would never go away. Estia\u2019s royal family had no power to sanction noblemen or rich merchants who had an interest in slavery. The only solution was to cut off the supply.However, this was easier said than done. In the end, she had to confront the slave traders directly.The slave traders were scattered everywhere, looking for more individuals with good abilities.It was impossible to defeat this system using a simple method.\u201cSo, you came straight here acting like a slave trader?\u201d His tone sounded uncertain, the light in his eyes had faded.\u201cBecause there is limited information for the guests, I had to come as a trader\u2026\u201dFor many years, she ran a fake slave trade. After making a name for herself among the slave traders, she was recognized as a slave trader who had a high position in the government supported by VIP aristocrats.Over the years, Leah had come to the point of uniting the slave traders to open a large auction. In addition, she also provided them with information about the severe measures to slowly gain their trust.However, since this grand auction was done through a coalition of several slave traders, all of them, including Leah, were organizers of this grand auction.\u201cEven if I won their trust, they don\u2019t completely believe me. They are suspicious people, so they keep keeping an eye on each other.\u201d She told Ishakan.For this reason, although some were organizers of this auction, they still had to pass strict entry procedures. Security did not allow just anyone to pass through easily.\u201cDid you also trade Kurkans?\u201d he asked.\u201cOnly the old and sick Kurkans. I don\u2019t have enough funds to buy young, healthy Kurkans. I didn\u2019t buy many, but they are all safe, so you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d Leah stated confidently. She knew clearly the purpose of Ishakan in this auction house.Ishakan did not ask Leah to give him the Kurkans she had rescued. He simply flashed a subtle smile and asked her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSo those are the kinds of trades you make?\u201dLeah slowly nodded. Since this operation alone seemed insufficient, she had recently bought many Kurkans slaves and planned to hide them during the auction. Ishakan laughed vaguely.\u201cReally\u2026 there is a reason why Estia\u2019s royal family is not yet ruined.\u201d Ishakan\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. \u201cYou know what? A slave trader was always one step ahead of us. I thought she was a very capable person, so I looked her up. Then I found out it was you.\u201dHis sincerity was reflected in the absurd words that came out of his mouth. In fact, Leah had predicted that Ishakan would rescue the Kurkans, so she moved even faster. She had to interfere, to get the upper hand.However, she did not tell him this, as there was no need to mention it when the negotiations had not yet begun. She had to hide as many details as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Full Moon Night (2)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Eyljee--------Leah got rid of those thoughts and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to find you here.\u201dAlthough she hoped Ishakan would participate in this auction, she didn\u2019t expect that they would meet each other. She had originally planned to leave before the auction began, maintaining her incognito profile. The best course of action she had thought of was to also infiltrate as a guest. Unexpectedly, she had ended up revealing herself as a slave trader.\u201cHow did you get in?\u201d she asked.Leah found it hard to believe that he had infringed on the strict security. Ishakan had even made it as far as the reception room.Ishakan laughed at her surprise. \u201cWell, are you supposed to be more surprised than me?\u201d He hinted playfully.Afterwards, silence dominated the room. Leah realized too late that she had been sitting on Ishakan\u2019s lap for too long. Unconsciously, this had not seemed strange to her. In fact, she was used to her skin touching his. The fact that she felt comfortable being with Ishakan in such an intimate position, surprised her.As her instincts indicated, she began to break free from her control. However, Ishakan\u2019s thick arms, which had wrapped around her waist, showed no intention of letting go. Trapped in her steel grip, she raised her head and slowly found his eyes.\u201cWhat I asked the other day,\u201d Ishakan expressed with modesty.Leah was stunned as soon as she heard his voice low and tenuous. Ishakan grabbed her chin and lifted it as she avoided his gaze so their eyes would meet.\u201cHave you thought about it? You\u2019ve escaped without giving me the answer.\u201dHis hoarse voice tickled her ear. This seemed strange to her. The feelings he aroused in her, even though she had prepared her answer beforehand, made her stop for a moment. She wanted to tell him to forget their conversation, that she had mentioned that subject casually for him to leave her alone. However, those words refused to come out of her mouth.In the past, she would have said so without hesitation. But now, the words were stuck in her throat. No matter what, she couldn\u2019t let go of those words even if she wanted to.His thumb slowly touched her lip sliding down, while her mouth closed tightly. Ishakan whispered as he brushed his nose against hers.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to live responsibly, Leah.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe warmth of his breath, and his nose caressing her made her feel an indescribable emotion. Why was he being so sweet?\u201cYou seem to be the only one who wants to continue with the negotiation. Why are you so tied to the royal family?\u201dShe could become a fugitive. Throw everything overboard and live freely.His twisted words sounded so sweet that not even a honey-coated palm date could compare. Their implicit meaning attracted her.Leah looked at him enraptured. The weight of responsibility on her shoulders was almost unbearable, and the freedom she had chosen \u2013 the death \u2013 would be the fate she would have as a princess. Ishakan told her to get rid of all the burdens that were on her mind.If Ishakan, as he promised, were to take responsibility for her, could she give up everything? The man in front of her, since he came into her life, had turned her upside down.Leah raised her voice helplessly.\u201c\u2026Why would you do this for me?\u201d\u201c\u2026For now, let\u2019s say\u2026 That we are compatible in bed.\u201dHearing his cheeky words, she gave him a piercing look. Ishakan burst out laughing at her gaze. His laughter gradually faded, allowing the atmosphere to return to the comfortable silence.His golden eyes looked firmly into Leah\u2019s violet eyes. He lowered his gaze, traveling through her small nose, to the soft curve of her lips. His thumb, which had previously been touching her lips, slowly crept into her mouth.To his amazement, the soft, velvety tongue licked his finger. Leah\u2019s eyelashes trembled, her instincts betrayed her.The light in Ishakan\u2019s eyes shone even brighter. Strange. She couldn\u2019t find the right words to describe them clearly, but his golden eyes, today, she found them particularly special.It was as if he had bewitched her, drawing her to himself.The king slowly brought his face closer to hers. His thumb slid slowly along her teeth. Ishakan narrowed his eyes as he smiled and whispered seductively.\u201cDid you know that today is a full moon?\u201dSLAM!The next second, the door opened wide, interrupting the couple who were immersed in their own bubble. Upon hearing this, Leah was surprised and quickly distanced herself from Ishakan.It was Genin who appeared, grabbing the neck of Count Valtein who was standing next to her. Genin\u2019s mouth opened slightly. Her words were caught in her throat as she pointed to Leah, stunned.Count Valtein, who had entered the room with Genin, was very surprised when he saw Ishakan and Leah together.A somewhat tense and peculiar atmosphere was created.As Count Valtein cursed in his mind, someone appeared behind Genin\u2019s head.\u201cAhh!\u201dThe person who exclaimed, was also surprised when he saw Leah. It was the handsome Kurkan who had taken Leah to the royal palace the other day. He opened his mouth and mumbled. \u2013 This novel is translated by NovelUtopia\u201cWhat is this\u2026? Why is the princess here\u2026?\u201dIshakan clicked his tongue, dissatisfaction reflecting on his face.The man named Haban entered urgently, so Ishakan approached Leah. Ishakan acted as if the others were a plague that could not set their eyes on Leah.\u201cYou said you had self-control!\u201d Haban exclaimed, exalted.\u201cYes. It didn\u2019t work well.\u201d Ishakan responded calmly, getting Leah down from his lap. Then, he grabbed the back of her neck, and pulled her head to his chest. His other hand went down to her waist, and his thumb made small circles on it. \u201cI think I lied, Haban.\u201dHaban stared at Leah\u2019s red face and asked, \u201cWhat did Ishakan say to you?\u201d\u201cHe said nothing, except that today was the full moon\u2026\u201dLeah replied, perplexed. Ishakan became angry and yelled at Haban.\u201cYou\u2019ve been talking a lot of nonsense!\u201dGenin released Count Valtein\u2019s neck and slowly approached her. Then, she carefully stole Leah from Ishakan, putting Leah behind her and making sure her big body was hiding her.Having no idea of their dispute, Leah asked what was going on. Genin turned around and stared at her. Her voice sounded tense as she answered.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhen Kurkans mention the full moon, it usually has a sexu4l meaning.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Leah opened her mouth in surprise.\u201cThe day the full moon rises\u2026\u201dGenin looked at Count Valtein as she whispered quietly, making sure only Leah heard her.\u201cIt\u2019s mating season.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leah\u2019s Plans (1)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Eyljee--------Leah couldn\u2019t help the surprise she felt, but did her best to hide it. Of course, she knew about the beasts\u2019 mating season, but she had only read about it in books.Leah staggered as she tried to resolve her racing thoughts, while Genin continued her explanation calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s logical that a Kurkan would mate and seek to fulfill his reproductive instinct,\u201d she said.Haban intervened, and assured her that she should not worry. It was completely ordinary for their species to act more impulsively when in front of their partner.Hearing her mention this, Leah had a sudden thought. She immediately turned to Genin, who always seemed to be accompanying Ishakan. \u201cPerhaps\u2026\u201d Leah started, but Genin immediately interrupted, as she had anticipated what she was going to say next.\u201cWe\u2019re not a couple,\u201d she said defensively. \u201cPeople often confuse us because we are always together, but I assure you, my husband is much better looking.\u201dGenin went on to explain that while Ishakan was acting frivolous, her husband was not. He was considerate and careful. She bragged about her husband, instilling in Leah a very generous impression of this unknown man. Genin seemed very used to praising her partner.When she finished her praise, Genin returned to the main theme as if nothing had happened. Ishakan and Haban only shrugged their shoulders slightly.\u201cThe Kurkans are a little different during the full moon. Your body won\u2019t be able to handle it.\u201d Genin chose not to elaborate, knowing that if she did, Leah would not have been able to deal with the force of the resulting shock. \u201cYou must get as far away from Ishakan as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially today.\u201dThen, Genin\u2019s hands, big and strong, extended gently towards the princess. She took the laces from Leah\u2019s robe and carefully pulled them, manipulating them to better hide the princess\u2019 light skin. She handled Leah with care, as if she was as delicate as a porcelain doll. Perhaps, she hesitated to touch her after having witnessed her fainting previously. Haban had the same attitude.\u201cYour Highness,\u201d he began, \u201cMy name is Haban. I apologize for not having introduced myself formally, especially since I had seen you the other day.\u201dAlong with the courtesy of his introduction, Haban softened his voice. He seemed cautious, as if speaking louder could damage Leah\u2019s ears. Although he felt ridiculous, he did not want to question her fragility.\u201cOh,\u201d Genin exhaled, noticing the shaking figure of the count. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I overwhelmed you,\u201d she muttered. Valtein\u2019s face was pale.Count Valtein wanted to say that he would\u2019ve died if Genin had kept him any longer. Instead, he said nothing and desisted from saying his complaints.Breaking the tension, Ishakan stood up from his seat, arms crossed. The mastery of his posture spoke of his confidence. \u201cThe slave trader we were following was the princess,\u201d he said. \u2013 This novel is translated by NovelUtopiaGenin and Haban looked at Leah, their eyes widening in wonder. They found it hard to believe that this delicate princess was the source of all their problems, that she was always one step ahead of them.Ishakan laughed with a good mood. \u201cI think I\u2019ve taken a heavy hit.\u201dWhile everyone else was entertained by this information, Count Valtein remained cautious. He grabbed Leah\u2019s hem, his eyes conveying a fervent fear. He knew of the alleged brutality of the Kurkans, and he trembled. He feared his neck would be wrung at the slightest provocation.To comfort him, Leah gave him a gentle pat on the hand. However, this only made Valtein shrink further, as Ishakan, who had just finished speaking, stared at him.Before poor Count Valtein passed out, Leah opened her mouth to speak. \u201cSo, what do you plan to do?\u201dIshakan kept his gaze. It was a miracle that somehow everyone was meeting at the same time and place. She knew that there were other Kurkans hiding nearby as well.However, Leah could not decipher what was going on in Ishakan\u2019s head. He was an inscrutable man, but at least she knew that whatever strategy he had in mind would probably not lead to a peaceful solution. If Ishakan proceeded as he wished, he could ruin Leah\u2019s meticulous plan. He needed to eliminate the root of the problem. She needed a means of controlling potential adversaries she didn\u2019t anticipate finding.\u201cIf our goals are the same, it would be better to join forces,\u201d Leah offered.\u201cWell\u2026 You are right\u2026\u201d Ishakan smiled slowly. \u201cWhat are you thinking, princess?\u201d He agreed to discuss her plan in more detail.Leah explained briefly, aiming to persuade him in the least disastrous direction. \u201cSo, if we find where the Kurkans are trapped\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a little scary, princess,\u201d said Count Valtein, shyly lifting the corner of his mouth, forcing himself not to laugh at his own joke. He knew that if he laughed, they would be thrown out of the room.\u201cWe must go after them.Together.\u201d suggested Ishakan, in an authoritative voice.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Leah quickly protested. The idea was absurd.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWe can follow them quietly,\u201d added Ishakan comfortably. \u201cYou must allow this.\u201dHe was a man who knew how to put pressure on others. Leah hadn\u2019t foreseen this, but she couldn\u2019t find an excuse to object. Perhaps, including the Kurkans and revising her current plan would be for the best.Leah pondered for a moment before saying, \u201cIf I do, will you follow my plans?\u201d she asked quietly.A small smile appeared on Ishakan\u2019s lips. \u201cOnly you can relegate the king of the Kurkan to such submission.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to stand in my way,\u201d said Leah, knowing full well how mischievous and cunning the king was before her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leah\u2019s Plans (2)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Eyljee--------Ishakan seemed satisfied with her plan, which relieved Leah, since the person who could cause the most disruption was now willing to cooperate. She was about to continue talking when suddenly, they heard someone knocking on the door.It turned out to be a legitimate employee of the auction. In an instant, the Kurkans disappeared and the room was devoid of their presence, as if they had never been present. They carefully hid every trace of their presence and went into hiding.Leah and Count Valtein also quickly put on their masks.As soon as they allowed the employee to enter, the door opened and an escort entered. \u201cEveryone is waiting,\u201d he announced.Before the auction, the slave traders were expected to meet to conduct a short meeting. It represented the most difficult obstacle in their path, but the most important part of her plan.\u201cLet\u2019s go now. Guide the way.\u201d Leah\u2019s voice surprised the employee, who quickly looked down.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll guide you then, lady.\u201dLeah and Count Valtein followed the escort. Count Valtein silently wiped the sweat-soaked palm of his hand on the hem of his robe. Seeing how nervous he was, Leah felt sorry for not explaining to him the situation properly beforehand and just dragged him into this.Leah looked forward indifferently, contemplating the dark surroundings. Ishakan was probably following them in silence, but she couldn\u2019t feel his presence at all.At the meeting with the slave traders, Leah had planned to take the lead. She could not trust Count Valtein, since he was a fearful person and would have difficulty doing so. After all that had happened, it would be useless to provide misinformation to these cunning slave traders. So after careful consideration, Leah decided to participate actively.However, her plans were abruptly interrupted when she was disturbed by the unexpected appearance of the Kurkans. She didn\u2019t know the extent of Ishakan\u2019s rudeness, but she knew that he was very capable of doing certain things\u2026As she walked, her mind was full of complicated thoughts, and she expected Ishakan to be patient.After passing through a maze of corridors, they finally arrived at the meeting of the slave traders. The room was quite dark. There was a round table in the center, and the escorts of the slave traders were side by side. Count Valtein hesitated as he moved to stand next to the escorts.There were a total of eight people, including Leah. Among the slave traders, there were not only citizens of Estia, since some came from different corners of the continent. They were covered with masks and tunics, hiding their entire bodies. Leah watched them, and they watched her in turn.From the moment of Leah\u2019s arrival, they looked at her openly. Even though she was covered from head to toe like the others, with her own robe and mask, she could not hide her thin little physique. The fragile skin that peeked through her attire was obviously not that of a man.The round table did not have any elevated seat, but in spite of the supposed equality, the implicit ranking between them would not disappear. Sitting opposite Leah was a sturdy figure. He was the most powerful slave trader among those present. \u2013 This novel is translated by NovelUtopiaThe slave traders continued to watch her intently even after she sat down, their eyes glowing maliciously. Aware of their lewd looks, Leah held on and slowly opened her mouth.\u201cThis is the first time that I am before you all.\u201dA gale of laughter erupted. The man with the robust physique spoke in a hoarse voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were a woman,\u201d he said.The other slave traders spoke, one by one.\u201cYour voice is beautiful. Will your face be the same?\u201d\u201cHer body is so small.\u201d\u201cWomen with small physiques are very popular these days. Because of the princess, they sell quite well.\u201dHis words were discourteous. Leah had prepared herself for their bad behavior, however, her heart began to sink into worry. Her nervousness came from the knowledge that Ishakan was hiding nearby, watching them.Leah tapped the table with her finger. The slave traders were instantly silent.\u201cIs gender so important when it comes to buying and selling?\u201d she asked, in a tone of voice that was strong and cold. \u201cShouldn\u2019t profit be the most important thing?\u201dAlthough she couldn\u2019t look at their faces and witness their reactions, she knew that all their attention was focused on her. Leah bowed her head.\u201cIf I\u2019m the only one present with that mentality, then I guess I shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201dAs soon as Leah finished, the man on the other side of her laughed out loud again.\u201cIt\u2019s a rare thing for a woman to be a slave trader. Everyone is amazed. I hope you understand,\u201d he said, one hand on his chin. \u201cAlso, it is very surprising to discover that the one who has brought us all together is a little lady like you.\u201dThe mockery was clear in his voice. A wide smile spread across his face.Leah looked at him coldly. \u201cI will accept that as an apology.\u201d\u201cHaha, yes\u2026 Anyway, let\u2019s cooperate properly. We\u2019ll see each other often in the future.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a bad start, but it meant that from now on, Leah couldn\u2019t retire. Her conversations became serious, and her plan had begun to unfold. Leah remained firm in her intentions.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, an event that happened soon shook her heart.\u201cSince this seems like fate, I\u2019d like to offer everyone a little entertainment\u2026\u201dThen, the man shouted loudly for some people to come in. The back door opened, and a line of sweet-smelling women quickly entered the room. They held trays loaded with alcohol and sat down, one by one, next to the slave traders.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel so stiff,\u201d the man laughed. His arms were wrapped around the waist of the woman sitting next to him. Leah had become tense, surprised by his sudden and unpleasant display of generosity.\u201cOh, and don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll attend to you too,\u201d he assured her, chuckling at her embarrassment. \u201cGive this lady a barbarous man!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leah\u2019s Plans (3)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Eyljee--------The slave traders had their own displays of hospitality. Conveying kindness and showing good will was a crucial task for them, because it helped them gain the trust of their cautious companions.Count Valtein, who witnessed the scene, was unfazed. He stood there stiffly, preoccupied with the idea that Ishakan was watching them in the shadows.However, he knew that Leah could not refuse the favor of the slave traders. And to make matters worse, she couldn\u2019t afford to act rashly, because she was being watched by those around her.They scrutinized her every move. Any uncalculated act could instantly dissolve the little trust she had managed to generate, a mistake Leah could not afford.As time passed, a male slave came to attend to Leah. Like the female slaves, he was colorfully dressed, and held a wine in his hand. However, his slender body caught her attention, because he had a body type comparable to that of Haban.The most obvious difference between them was in their muscles; Haban\u2019s build can be considered thin, but she looked toned and strong. However, the male slave seemed to have only skin and bone.He possessed the quintessence of the Kurkan\u2019s light eyes and dark skin, but did not have a single muscle. Had it not been for the tattoos on the back of his neck, Leah would not have realized that he was a Kurkan.(TL. Quintessence: purest quality of a thing.)Walking softly, the slave approached Leah, sitting next to her. He emanated a sweet smell of peach. The fruity perfume tickled her nose, and she became rigid.The slave trader, who was still caressing the Kurkan female slave next to him, looked at Leah. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a precious slave, which I\u2019m giving to you. Or perhaps, you prefer a more athletic one?\u201dHe prepared to call another slave, ready to replace the weak Kurkan who was at her side. However, aware of the delicate situation, she could not allow any more outsiders to enter, so Leah immediately stopped him.\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right. I didn\u2019t expect this to happen during our meeting,\u201d she replied, her voice choking.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so formal. Just make yourself comfortable and relax. Enjoy yourself!\u201d exclaimed the slave trader. He squeezed the Kurkan slave harder, pulling her towards him, causing her to give a little shout.Leah frowned. She felt as if she were sitting on a chair of thorns. The slave poured her a glass of sweet fruit wine.\u201cPlease have a drink, lady.\u201dHowever, Leah did not accept the drink he offered her, and the slave trader, upon realizing this, frowned in dismay with his eyes narrowed. Then he asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you like the wine?\u201dAt her question, Leah raised her glass just to wet her lips. The powerful taste of the wine filtered through her tongue, and she looked at the man, who was now smiling happily. A strange sensation invaded her, and she could not find the right words to express it.It was a difficult feat to enslave the Kurkans as they were natural-born warriors. However, the more difficult the task and the more the result was coveted, the greater its value. If the Kurkans were particularly beautiful too, then that value would only increase, becoming practically incalculable.As a result, the slave traders essentially dedicated themselves to enslaving these exceptional goods, with the intention of satisfying their greedy clients. But that raised the question: How was all this possible when the Kurkans were such proud warriors? Surely, the slave traders could be easily defeated.The answer, then, lay in the vulnerable youth of the Kurkans.Mature Kurkans were strong and experienced fighters. It was almost impossible to capture them, and were even harder to tame. In the event that they were captured, the probability of their escape was very high. Therefore, traders sought out those who were still young and naive, as they were fundamentally incapable of fighting their kidnappers.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was a repugnant cycle. A young and uncultured Kurkan was no different from a young beast. They were weak, lacked training, and could easily be trained as slaves over time through strict education.However, their education would be far from normal. They would be severely beaten and abused until their identities as Kurkan evaporated, forgetting what they once were. They were taught submission and obedience through ruthless violence, until they became meek slaves unable to oppose their masters even after reaching adulthood.Because of this demanding process, Kurkan slaves were traded at tremendously high prices. However, although the traders wanted to adopt this practice frequently as it benefited them large sums, they couldn\u2019t. They quickly ran out of these slaves, since Kurkan slaves were an extraordinary rarity.A base of consumers were desperate to obtain them, which made the slave traders and mercenaries anxious. Their eyes were bloodshot, poisoned by greed and desire.Later, a slave trade route was established, with Estia as a base. Estia represented a privileged place for this, since it bordered the western desert, which was the home of the Kurkans.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Valuable Kurkan (1)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Eyljee--------At that time, Leah became interested in the slave trade because of the growing activity. A battle had taken place, in which rival slave traders were seeking to strategically position themselves in Estia, the most convenient location for kidnappings. In trying to suppress the corresponding disturbances, Leah had become familiar with the enslavement of the Kurkans, and it caused her profound pain.She resented the cruel reality and the fate of the Kurkan slaves, and held hatred for herself who couldn\u2019t do anything about it, even though she was the princess of Estia.The more she thought about it, the angrier Leah became. The lives of the Kurkans were equal to her own. She could even partially identify with them in some way. Leah had been forced to endure the excessive efforts of Cerdina who tried to ruin her entire life. She could not oppose Cerdina, and lived oppressed by her, tied to the kingdom from birth. Her royal blood represented her death, almost like that of the Kurkans, whose blood and race dictated their courage.\u300cYou must be the perfect princess, Leah.\u300dAs Leah recalled certain moments from the past, it seemed as if she heard Cerdina\u2019s voice. Leah bit her lips to keep from thinking about it. She wasn\u2019t in a situation where she could be remembering depressing things. She had a task to accomplish and people to save.One last duty to perform for her country. The weight of Estia\u2019s future weighed heavily on her shoulders.The male Kurkan next to Leah leaned forward and whispered as she carefully lowered her wine glass.\u201cI am curious to know what face is behind this mask\u2026 How beautiful are you?\u201dA thin finger grazed Leah\u2019s shoulders. Instantly, she shuddered and pulled him away, casually touching the slave\u2019s hand. She took a deep breath.The slave simply smiled. Perhaps he deliberately made her drink too much, with the intention of getting her drunk. After looking at him as he clung tightly to her, Leah whispered, \u201cListen to me carefully.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI have no intention of doing anything with you, so behave with restraint,\u201d she said. Then she added quietly, \u201cI\u2019m here to save you.\u201dThe Kurkan\u2019s gaze began to waver, but he skillfully contained his emotions. \u201cYour joke is too much to bear,\u201d he replied.\u201cYou will soon discover whether I am joking or not. Can you run? If you cannot, tell me now.\u201dLeah asked him in advance because she knew that there were cases where slaves had certain muscles cut to make it difficult for them to escape. This prevented them from escaping if they wanted to or had previously tried.The male Kurkan smiled delicately and bloomed, but the light in his eyes shone.\u201cOf course.\u201d Leah could detect a faint murderous intent under his gentle voice. The prospect of wreaking havoc thrilled him. \u201cI can do more than that,\u201d he whispered in her ear.Although it seemed that Leah\u2019s situation and the Kurkans were similar, there was a key difference between them. The Kurkans could be enslaved all their lives, but they would not hesitate to take the opportunity to escape, even if it meant enduring beatings and abuse.This male Kurkan slave for example, had overcome the brainwashing that had been done to him all his life. Inside him, the blood of the Kurkans flowed unrestrained. Which, through experience, made them formidable warriors and unstoppable opponents.No matter how young, sick or frail a Kurkan was, their true nature was on their side. It did not matter if they were slaves, warriors, children, or elders. If they are born as Kurkan, they die as Kurkan.They were different from Leah, who only doubted again and again\u2026Behind her mask, Leah bit her lip hard again. The flood of emotions that came from witnessing the hope and courage of the male slave caught her off guard. In a moment, she felt the differences between them were as great as the earth and the sky. However, she quickly pushed aside these feelings and then raised her voice for all to hear.\u201cI would like to discuss benefit sharing.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUpon hearing the word \u2018benefits\u2019, the slave traders immediately focused on it. Greed was in their eyes. They gave Leah their full attention.\u201cBenefit sharing?\u201d asked a slave trader, raising his glass of wine and taking a sip. It was the man with the robust body, the one who seemed to have the highest position among them. Leah knew of this man\u2019s great influence. \u201cEach of us will take our respective share,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll split the remaining 30% between us.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. And, since we will share the 30%, I want to inspect the Kurkans you are offering. I need to be thorough. After all, we wouldn\u2019t be the only ones to suffer if we sell poor quality products.\u201dLeah bowed her head and continued, convincingly.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s to avoid losses.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Valuable Kurkan (2)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Eyljee--------\u201cHaha, I like this.\u201d He laughed at Leah\u2019s words. Even then, as he lowered his wine glass, his eyes never left her. The female Kurkan slave by his side moved immediately to fill the glass.The slave trader brought the cup to his lips, sipping as he looked at Leah. He could not deduce anything simply by looking at the mask that hid her face and the black robe she donned, thus he could only look at the bare skin of her hand.\u201cYour confidence is quite overwhelming,\u201d he then asked. \u201cDo you think your own slaves are that good?\u201d\u201cThey are good enough to change the course of this auction.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a lie because the King of Kurkans was present, but the slave trader laughed at Leah\u2019s seemingly ridiculous statement and responded, \u201cI\u2019ll show you anything you want, but since what I have is pretty confidential, I can\u2019t show it to many others.\u201d He pushed aside the female Kurkan slave who was sitting next to him. \u201cIt will be fine if it\u2019s just the two of us. Then you can check.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound bad,\u201d Leah nonchalantly responded while nodding her head.The slave trader immediately stood up and gestured to Leah.\u201cFollow me.\u201dHe opened a door, and Leah followed him closely. She knew she wasn\u2019t alone, so she tried to be as quick as possible.The hallway to the back door was very different from the one Leah had initially used to enter the meeting room. It had bright lights, and there was a thick carpet covering the floor. It was a corridor that connected the meeting room with the auction house.The slave trader stopped in front of a large iron door and took out a key.Clack!After unlocking the lock, he opened the door abruptly. The trader exaggeratedly extended his arms, pretending to act as a gentleman escorting her.When Leah entered, the door closed behind her. The atmosphere inside repulsed her more than she expected. The disgust she felt inside could not be explained.A little Kurkan girl was curled up on a huge bed covered with soft quilts. Her extremities were small and thin. It was clear that she had not yet reached puberty. She had large, heavy wives pressing on her premature bones.As soon as the slave trader entered the room, the Kurkan girl stood up, her empty expression transformed into an expression of fear. She shuddered, fleeing to the corner of the room.The slave trader put his arm around Leah\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAs you know, young Kurkan girls are the most expensive. So, what do you think of this? Are you satisfied?\u201d he asked with satisfaction. It was clear how proud he was of his piece.He brought his body closer to Leah, close enough that she could feel his rough breath.\u201cOnly the two of us are here. Before you go, why don\u2019t you take all this off? From the moment you started talking, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what kind of face I might find behind such a beautiful voice\u2026!\u201dThere was no need to keep listening to the avalanche of dirt coming out of the slave trader\u2019s filthy mouth. Leah knew that her protector must have followed her.She said his name.\u201cIshakan.\u201dThe slave trader suddenly began to tremble, exhaling deeply. The next instant, a loud thud echoed throughout the room. The heavy body of the trader collapsed on the floor. A jet of hot liquid came out of his body, staining the carpet a deep dark red.A solid arm surrounded Leah\u2019s waist from behind. Ishakan passed his face to the side of her neck.\u201cYou\u2019re trying my patience, right?\u201d he whispered. Beneath his relaxed tone, there was a latent rage, slowly rising. \u201cI almost killed them all, Leah.\u201d***The auction house of the eight slave traders was soon filled with potential buyers. They piled up like clouds gathering in a gigantic storm.Estia\u2019s position in the center of the continent gave it its status as the epicenter of the slave trade. However, the kingdom had announced its intentions to take drastic measures against this practice, which prompted today\u2019s attendees to come with their pockets full, aware that this event could be considered as the last slave auction in these territories. \u2013Chapter advanced in NovelUtopiaRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn response to the expectations of the guests, the slave traders brought their best products for exhibit, and had proudly prepared for this special occasion. Many rumors had spread throughout the royal capital. People spoke of the high quality products that would be featured, and coveted slaves that would be on the exhibit.Because of this, the auction was filled to capacity with visitors, hiding in the basement of a large mansion. Despite the remote location, which was on the outskirts of the city\u2019s capital, there was no empty seat anywhere.The eager guests enjoyed the alcohol and food that had been served to them as they quietly waited for the auction to begin. Even as they talked among themselves, discussing the barbarian slaves to be sold, they could not help but turn their gaze to the thick curtain that covered the stage. Impatient for the great revelation, they were all attentive, curious to know when the curtain would finally rise.The audience was excited. However, the time designated for the start of the auction had already passed, and the curtains had not yet moved an inch. Normally, if there was a delay in the procedure,there would be an announcement to calm the guests\u2019 concerns.However, no announcement was made.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Blood (1)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Eyljee--------While waiting for the auction to begin, the guests got tired. Their faces became bitter, full of restlessness. Even the diligent servants who were attending to the guests had disappeared. The irritation could be felt in the atmosphere until finally, a customer began to shout out loud.\u201cWhat happened? Did something bad happen?\u201dThe guests became more and more anxious with every minute that passed. When the auction house began to rumble, the curtain finally rose.The curtains were supposed to go up without a problem, but they were lifted slightly differently. It was lifted crookedly, as if lifted by one person using only one arm.When the scene was revealed, it was completely dark. A strange man came out of the darkness.He was wearing a loose outfit that looked as if he had stolen it from somewhere. He approached the center of the scene and shouted emphatically.\u201cGenin!\u201dSuddenly, the lights came on. The complete figure of the man, now visible, stunned the guests. Their jaws dropped and their eyes grew larger.On the scene was a barbarian. A Kurkan.\u201cThank you for coming to the auction today!,\u201d he exclaimed, his voice sounding happily in the air. His dimples accentuated his wide and endearing smile. Customers, even without understanding the situation, wondered if it was all part of a presentation. It could be an introduction organized for the final slave auction of the kingdom.However, the more insightful guests realized what was happening, and immediately began to look for a way out.The man on stage continued to speak, capturing the attention of the crowd.\u201cAs everyone has foreseen, today we celebrate a very special event! That\u2019s right\u2026\u201d The man extended both arms and shouted: \u201cNow you are all slaves, being chased by slave traders!\u201dThe auction house was immediately silent, as if ice water had been thrown over the entire audience. The man laughed happily as he stood in front of the paralyzed guests. His dimples, which decorated his face like two elegant holes, seemed to burst out as he showcased a wicked smile.\u201cWhat do you think? Sounds like fun, doesn\u2019t it?\u201dThe stillness was broken. The guests screamed frantically, passing over other people, chairs or tables. They stumbled on the way to the exits, making the whole place a total chaos. The man laughed as he watched people run towards the doors, abandoning their dignity. The man\u2019s eyelids narrowed, his eyes shone with ecstasy. \u2013Chapter advanced in NovelUtopia\u201cLadies and Gentlemen! From now on\u2026\u201dThe wild beasts suddenly appeared from all directions. The man jumped from the stage and joined the crowd.\u201cI hope you are all good at running!\u201d he shouted.***As soon as Leah released the girl from her chains, the little Kurkan girl ran to the trader who had owned her. She jumped up, trampling him savagely, as if he would die a second time.Ishakan grabbed the girl who was jumping on the man and pushed her aside. Then he searched the body and took out a bunch of keys from it. They were in his hand, the first symbol of freedom of the Kurkan slaves.\u201cHaban, Genin.\u201dAt his call, the two appeared, then he threw the keys at them.\u201cEveryone will gather here,\u201d he said.Haban and Genin, taking the keys, began their search. They finished soon after, returning with all the Kurkan captives. They were decently dressed because they had been captured just before they headed for the auction. While Haban was guiding them, Genin reported to Ishakan.\u201cContrary to the number we expected, I think there is one missing. Maybe it\u2019s somewhere else,\u201d she said.\u201cHe has a very hostile attitude, so I think he was trapped in a separate room,\u201d the girl shouted. She was squatting in the corner, but suddenly intervened. She walked with determination when she met Ishakan\u2019s gaze. \u201cI can lead you to where he is.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIshakan turned to Haban and Genin. \u201cHow much time do we have before the auction starts?\u201d\u201cWe are a little short of time,\u201d Haban responded.Ishakan thought about Haban\u2019s answer for a moment before deciding. \u201cI will go with the princess. As for all of you\u2026\u201d he stopped, the corners of his mouth raised. \u201cPlease greet the guests of the auction.\u201dHaban\u2019s and Genin\u2019s eyes shone. It\u2019s been a while since they had any good action, and all this was on a completely different level.

Blood (2)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Eyljee--------Leah\u2019s original plan was to secretly rescue the captured slaves. Free them all, including the Kurkans, and then escape before the auction began. However, her plan deviated the moment Ishakan became involved. Suddenly, she had to accept all the changes, which his presence had caused.She predicted a bloodbath\u2026Following the girl Kurkan, Ishakan and Leah entered the basement, avoiding the detection of the mansion\u2019s employees.\u201cHow many people are you going to kill?\u201d Leah asked, whispering to Ishakan.\u201cAll the slave traders. As for the customers\u2026 Well, the lucky ones will survive, I guess.\u201dIshakan, who was walking silently while carrying Leah, stopped for a moment and suddenly looked back. A distant cry echoed from the auction house.\u201cWe must move quickly,\u201d he said.The last Kurkan slave seemed to be locked up somewhere in the deepest part of the labyrinthine mansion. Their route began to change slowly as they advanced, from well-finished walls to wet stone walls. The rotten wooden stairs creaked with every step.There was not enough illumination, so they could not see in front of them, but Ishakan skillfully guided the way.\u201cI can\u2019t believe he was locked up in a place like this,\u201d whispered Leah in Ishakan\u2019s embrace.It looked like a subway prison. Like a horse corral, only with more space. He thought they could have at least had the decency to keep it in a cleaner place if they were going to sell it.\u201cI don\u2019t think they would have given him the slightest sip of water until he passed out,\u201d Ishakan said simply, unhurriedly. \u201cOnly when a Kurkan can\u2019t take any more and is on the verge of starvation, will they offer him a piece of bread. The act of being fed is a means of cultivating obedience.\u201d(TL. Starvation: suffering or death caused by hunger.)He spoke naturally, and the lightness of his tone only served to further emphasize the inhuman nature of the slaves\u2019 treatment.\u201cThe reason I came this far today is because I believe there are customers who wanted fierce slaves,\u201d he ended his speech with those words.\u201cYou\u2026 talk as if you\u2019ve been there yourself.\u201dIshakan laughed briefly. Instead of responding, he just kept going. Unlike the road they had traveled so far, they were in a noticeably brighter area. It had a small window at the top of the dark roof.With the moonlight filtering through and the torches hanging down, their surroundings slowly lit up as they went further in. In the middle of the round space was an iron cell.Inside it was a small Kurkan boy. He was strongly chained, and had a large steel ball tied to him. He seemed to be unconscious, but as soon as he felt other presences in the room, he moved. He stood up, with a threatening and fierce posture. Although his eyes looked tired, Leah could still feel the hatred emanating from his gaze. The boy looked no different than a wild beast.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIshakan took Leah down from his arms and looked at the boy silently for a moment. The moonlight that shone on Ishakan\u2019s face made his eyes seem colder than usual.His closed lips moved slowly. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ishakan\u2019s golden eyes captivated Leah. Ishakan radiated a peculiar energy, and she felt that she could stay looking at his golden irises forever. Since he took off his mask, his eyes had become clearer. She felt as if she could perceive all the emotions inside him.\u201cDo you remember all the Kurkans you saved?\u201d he asked quietly.It was a strange question. Ishakan looked at Leah as if he wanted her to give him the answer he wanted. However, she didn\u2019t know what Ishakan wanted, so she could only be honest.Some memories were too old. There were also too many urgent situations, in which she could not look properly at the faces of the Kurkans she was releasing. To claim that she remembered them all would be a deception. As she slowly shook her head, the bitterness reflected weakly in Ishakan\u2019s eyes. \u2013Chapter advanced in NovelUtopia\u201cI understand.\u201dIshakan said nothing more. Then, he took the key and stood in front of the cell, opening three or more locks consecutively. As the iron keys rang out, Leah wondered.\u2018Should I have nodded my head even though I was lying?\u2019His bitter smile disturbed her. She approached him with doubts. Ishakan threw the last lock on the floor and looked at Leah. The moment she opened her lips to speak to him, the iron door burst open.The boy ran quickly to Leah and jumped on her stomach. She fell, shocked by the sudden attack. The boy looked at her fiercely, madness was evident on his face. As the boy moved to tear Leah\u2019s neck, Ishakan intervened with his forearm, blocking the boy\u2019s bite.The blood flowed from Ishakan when the sound of the bite resounded grotesquely at the site. Ishakan threw the boy away. He flew like a rubber ball, crashing into the wall and then sliding motionless to the ground. The rattling of his chains disappeared.A trembling voice spoke aloud.\u201cIshakan\u2026\u201dBlood dripped from his forearm and spilled on the floor. Leah looked at his wound, only to find teeth marks around it. Her heart collapsed.\u201cWe have to stop the bleeding,\u201d she urged. \u201cI can stop the bleeding with my clothes\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNo, Leah.\u201dIshakan stepped back a few feet, keeping Leah from touching him. He frowned, was worried and frustrated. \u201cYou should stay away from me. You know, there\u2019s a full moon tonight.\u201dAs he spoke, the moonlight shone on them. In the creepy, cold light, they both looked at each other. Leah thoughtlessly lifted a hand to her mouth.\u201cThat would be difficult\u2026especially when I see blood.\u201dThe front of Ishakan\u2019s pants began to swell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Plead (1)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Eyljee--------Listening to Ishakan, Leah remembered the stories Genin had told her. It had been going around in her head since the moment Genin had first explained the true nature of a Kurkan during the full moon. Only one word came to her mind now, echoing through confused memories.Mating\u2026Seeing Leah speechless made Ishakan laugh. Her eyes were wide open, and her lips could barely stammer a full sentence.\u201cBut the wound\u2026\u201d\u201cIt will heal even if I do nothing,\u201d he shrugged.Ishakan approached the boy he had thrown, who laid motionless on the ground. He checked for a pulse and confirmed that the boy was still breathing. \u201cHe\u2019s not dead,\u201d he muttered.However, he confirmed that the child would most likely remain unconscious until the next day. Since the boy had been abused for so long, it was only natural that he would exhaust all his strength after jumping to Leah.Ishakan picked up the boy and laid him down in a corner before sighing. He had been forcing himself not to make eye contact with Leah. Concerned, he slowly backed up and leaned against the iron bars of the window.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dHe sighed and raised his hand to touch his hair. As his fingers brushed against his dark brown strands, blood flowed down his arm. The wound was exposed, and dark red threads of blood dripped down his elbow, forming a puddle on the floor.Leah approached Ishakan slowly, who felt surprised by her own actions. Throughout their many interactions, Ishakan had always been the first to approach. Her mind remembered the moment when he had gone to get her for a luncheon. His charming evil smile and his magnetic golden eyes were embedded in her mind.Leaning on the iron bars, Ishakan stared at Leah, wanting her to stop. He tried to restrain himself, but it wasn\u2019t enough to hide the indomitable desire that burned in his eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t come, Leah,\u201d he grunted, his voice restrained. \u201cDo you realize what you\u2019re doing?\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered, her face flushed. \u201cLast time\u2026 It\u2019s because you helped me last time.\u201d Although she didn\u2019t know what a Kurkan in heat felt like, Leah could clearly remember what she had felt when she had taken that adulterated drink. A horrible pain ignited her body, leaving her feverish, itchy and desperate to break free. Ishakan could be going through the same pain. \u201cSo, this time, I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d\u201cWith your body?\u201d\u2018Must you say something so obvious out loud?\u2019Leah felt a little embarrassed, but nodded hesitantly.\u201cYou are kind, Leah.\u201d Ishakan\u2019s eyes narrowed as he smiled, trying to hide his discomfort. \u201cBut don\u2019t you really have another reason?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLeah didn\u2019t respond. In fact, she was prepared. She was tempted by him, by the man in front of her. Her reasoning might argue against getting involved with Ishakan, but her body remembered the pleasure he could give her. He attracted her, so she wanted to reciprocate. \u2013Leah felt the heat rising in her neck. She enjoyed the feel of her skin on his, the warm intimacy of his touch. She liked the way they bonded as one, she liked how he could set her mind free and get rid of any worries or thoughts. Those were the only times she could forget the burdens and complicated situations that clouded her daily life, even if only temporarily. \u2013Chapter advanced in NovelUtopia\u2018Once again, just once more. This is the last one.\u2019With this imperfect excuse driving her, Leah approached Ishakan. Ishakan\u2019s eyes shone sinisterly as he watched her. Leah stopped in front of Ishakan before looking up. With the most determined expression and the most assertive voice she could muster, she said as she drew closer.\u201cWe should deal with this first,\u201d she said. Then, she looked directly into Ishakan\u2019s eyes and bravely, though gently, took his arm in her small hands.Ishakan withdrew his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he insisted.The lie was so obvious that not even the most naive child in the world would believe it. Leah ignored him and gently made him sit down on the floor. Then she sat down across from him.Since the inside of her dress was made of soft fabric, it would be easy to turn it into a bandage for her wound. However, Leah struggled for a while, trying to tear off a considerable piece without success.Ishakan laughed at her feeble attempts before intervening, stopping her clumsy hands. And then, he tore a piece.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA long strip was quickly torn off by Ishakan, making Leah blush. Realizing the difference between their strength, Leah was overcome with shame. She had been trying to tear off a piece, while Ishakan had succeeded in doing so instantly.Leah took the torn cloth and wrapped it carefully, but tightly around Ishakan\u2019s arm. The bleeding stopped, but then, Ishakan wrapped his thick arms around her waist.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCome here,\u201d he muttered.Ishakan had Leah sit on his legs while she was still surprised. The back of his hand caressed her neck, inhaling deeply.\u201cThere is a sweet aroma\u2026emanating from you\u2026\u201dIshakan must have smelled the fragrant wine that the slave Kurkan served him long ago. Leah shrugged her shoulders slightly, feeling a little ticklish. However, Ishakan immediately tightened his grip on her.Bringing her close once more, he rubbed his face against her neck. Ishakan sighed deeply, his warm breath brushing against her skin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Plead (2)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Eyljee--------Leah flinched, letting out a small cry of surprise. But she quickly calmed down and hurriedly wiped up the blood that had dripped down her arm. \u201cHold still. Bandages are hard to tie,\u201d she said.However, Ishakan didn\u2019t seem to care about his wound. While Leah struggled trying to wrap his forearm, he was busy pawing at her body. His hands groped her all over. Then, with a movement of his hand, he removed Leah\u2019s wig and tossed it aside. Every time Ishakan made a move, Leah could feel Ishakan\u2019s thighs moving under her ass, destabilizing her.\u201cIf you keep moving, I won\u2019t be able to do this properly\u2026!\u201dInstead of understanding Leah\u2019s worry, Ishakan ignored her complaints, feeling content with his own actions. \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s okay to be sick.\u201dLeah gave up and tied the bandage roughly. Carefully treating Ishakan\u2019s wound while he was still writhing was useless, it was better to finish treating him quickly.Because of the thickness of her forearm, she had used more fabric than she expected. As she tied the last knot, his muscles contracted. She looked at him, asking, \u201cDoesn\u2019t it hurt?\u201dHe answered without thinking. \u201cIt hurts.\u201d\u201cIs it too tight? Do you want me to loosen the bandage a little?\u201d asked Leah, worried that she had been too careless.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that,\u201d Ishakan said, his voice sounded husky. And when he lifted his hips, something large, warm and firm bumped into her from underneath. She could feel the solid outline of his manhood and froze. \u201cHere,\u201d he whispered.Leah was still as a statue. Her hands, which had been moving awkwardly on Ishakan\u2019s arm before, stopped touching him. They remained in the air trembling, as Ishakan licked Leah\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cCan you treat this too?\u201d\u201c\u2026Shut up before I tie that with a bandage too.\u201dLeah\u2019s face was flushed while she finished adjusting the knot of the blindfold, ignoring Ishakan\u2019s laughter. Before she could feel satisfied with her accomplishment, however, Ishakan deftly caressed Leah\u2019s cheeks.\u201cPlease touch me, Leah,\u201d he pleaded.Leah suddenly regretted offering her help. She wanted to take it all back, but at the same time, she didn\u2019t. As Leah struggled with her inner conflict, Ishakan\u2019s er3ction pressed against her body once again, and the intense heat of the er3ction made her lose her sanity.She climbed off his lap and knelt on the floor in front of Ishakan, between his legs. Leah breathed with determination. She reached her trembling hand forward and slowly unraveled the top of his pants. She tried to remind herself that she was doing this only to help Ishakan, who had suffered an arm wound to save her, but she was anxious, disconcerted by the daring nature of her actions.As she was about to pull down his underpants, the last barrier standing between her and his raw skin, she hesitated for a considerable time. She could see the distinct cylindrical outline of his form, and it frightened her.However, despite her protests internally, her hand moved as if it had a mind of its own, tugging at the thin fabric of Ishakan\u2019s underwear. Out came his thick and throbbing manhood.Although she had experienced him inside her several times before, this was the first time she had simply touched him. Leah\u2019s eyes widened as his manhood swelled even more.

She dimly heard his soft sigh as he covered her eyes with his hand, and her vision darkened completely as she fainted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t worry (2)--------S3x with Ishakan never ended normally. It always continued until she couldn\u2019t take it anymore, with him pushing her physical and mental limits to breaking point. If they kept going this way, it could only end with her untimely death. Leah was sure that it really could kill her.She was drifting in confusion, just on the edge of lucidity, when a voice brought her back to her senses.\u201cYou really have no conscience. You were very hard on her\u2026\u201dWas this a dream or reality? Leah lay still as she listened, unable to even lift her eyelids. The speaker continued, a litany of complaints.\u201cYou didn\u2019t have a ceremony, so she shouldn\u2019t be pregnant, but still you have gone too far! What will we do now that you\u2019ve bitten her like this? The princess has to wear dresses!\u201dA firm hand slid gently through Leah\u2019s hair, stroking affectionately. The sensation came through a haze, and she found it a little uncomfortable.\u2018I agree. Ishakan, you have been too hard this time,\u201d said a second voice.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that the princess made it back alive!\u201d exclaimed the first voice.\u201cHaban. Gennin.\u201dAnother voice joined the conversation, unconcerned.\u201cGet out of here. I\u2019ll listen to all your complaints later.\u201d A hand cupped her cheek, and the speaker let out a faint laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re both too noisy. She\u2019ll wake up because of you.\u201dThe other two voices instantly fell silent. Once it seemed they weren\u2019t going to speak again, Leah felt fatigue wash over her once more, and she drifted back to sleep under that caressing hand, as if it were gently leading her to oblivion.***\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Leah finally opened her eyes, she found that her head was resting on a muscular thigh. Blinking, she looked up, trying to get her bearings. A warm hand brushed her hair back from her eyes.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dLeah stirred. Her body was numb and her mind was foggy, and Ishakan shifted her so she could lean against his chest. His large hands held her carefully, as if she were made of fine and fragile porcelain. Bending his head, he kissed her lovingly, and cold water flowed from his mouth into hers. Leah swallowed automatically, and Ishakan put a jug to his lips, then let her drink it from him again. Thirstily, she swallowed every drop, and once she was sufficiently hydrated, Ishakan\u2019s tongue followed the water between her lips, licking her teeth and tickling the roof of her mouth.\u201cAaah\u2026\u201dA small moan escaped her and he chuckled, moving closer for another kiss. One hand gently caressed her cheek and curved under her chin, sliding down to her bre4sts. Slipping under the thin material of her nightgown, he pinched her sensitive n!pples with his thumb and forefinger.Her hips moved on their own in dreamy response, spurred by the sensations. The hand at her back slid down, patting her backside in passing, brushing against her thighs to tug the hem of her nightgown. His fingertips brushed her growing wetness and she came back to her senses with a jolt.\u201cAaah, Ishakan!\u201dQuickly, she pushed him away, and Ishakan retreated obediently, smiling as he lifted his hand to lick his fingers. Her cloudy mind cleared and memories of the previous night flooded back. Leah glanced down at her belly reflexively and then up at Ishakan. Her face was pale.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not pregnant.\u201d he said, in answer to her mortification.Leah pursed her lips. How? It was impossible that she wouldn\u2019t be. She clearly remembered his manhood pulsing inside her, flooding her with impossible amounts of his s3men.\u201cLies\u2026\u201dIshakan chuckled.\u201cIf you are questioning my fertility, you are mistaken. We must perform a ceremony before mating to allow pregnancy. All Kurkans must do so.\u201dLeah closed her eyes, breathing a deep sigh of relief. He hugged her and whispered mischievously in her ear.\u201cWhat? Are you sad? Did you want to have a baby with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOr did you have fun yesterday? If you want, I\u2019ll always do it like last night.\u201dShe stared at him and Ishakan laughed.\u201cHow long was I asleep?\u201d\u201cNot very long. The sun hasn\u2019t risen yet.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt least she had awakened early. Leah was relieved, but Ishakan frowned as if disappointed. She ignored him, rising hurriedly. But while her mind was prepared, her body was not. Her legs wobbled and she would have collapsed immediately if Ishakan hadn\u2019t moved quickly to catch her.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dThe answer was obvious, but she said it anyway.\u201cTo the palace. I have to get back.\u201d\u201cLeave after breakfast.\u201d As if he had been expecting her rejection, Ishakan smiled, his eyes warm. \u201cIf you have breakfast with me, I\u2019ll tell you something interesting.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Blood Of A Wolf (1)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Regan--------Leah hesitated. She wanted to ask Ishakan many things, but more than anything she just wanted to walk away. It was hard to look him in the face when moments from last night kept flashing through her mind, visions of endless and frightening s3x haunting her.She had cried and struggled like an overwhelmed child. Her senses had been pushed to their limits. It had been primal and raw and Ishakan had succumbed completely to primitive impulses she couldn\u2019t begin to understand. The ordeal was seared into her mind, and the memory of his touch made her writhe with embarrassment. It was too much, all of it. Clenching her fists, her nails bit into her palms as she spoke.\u201cWhatever it is, I don\u2019t need to know.\u201dShe tried to summon her regal bearing as she pushed him away, her legs wobbling beneath her, but she had barely gone two steps when something caught the hem of her dress. It wasn\u2019t Ishakan. He was standing by the bed, silently watching. Her dress was caught on something, a nail in the floor, and even bending over to free it was simply beyond her.She gave up. The frustration was evident on her face as she fell back toward the bed, and Ishakan smiled down at her.\u201cYou can\u2019t go back alone. You can\u2019t even walk.\u201dWrapping Leah up in his arms, he carried her to the bed, shaping a backrest from the pillows and tucking a blanket over her. Content with his efforts, he gently kissed her forehead.\u201cWait a moment, okay? I\u2019ll get you something delicious.\u201dHe shrugged into a coat and slipped out the door, his footsteps fading into the distance. With the room empty, Leah took the opportunity to observe her surroundings. It was a fairly large room, so she assumed it must be one of the finer inns, furnished with heavy furniture, opulent and grand. Beside her on the bed was the paper Ishakan had been reading when she woke.All of it was in Kurkan. He must have been writing while she slept; the ink was still fresh, shiny with moisture. Leah studied the text. Though Ishakan\u2019s penmanship in the language of Estia was poor, his calligraphy in his native tongue was impeccable. The lines were bold, and fierce, but there was still a sense of artistry.The door opened and Ishakan reappeared, carrying a tray laden with plates piled high with food. Fruits, meats, breads, sweetmeats, an enormous variety and to her eyes, enough to feed the change of guard at the palace. She had to stifle a gasp as he set it down before her.Was she supposed to eat all that?Maybe he meant for her to take a small bite of each dish, like at a banquet. The Kurkans were almost ostentatious in their consumption of food, but there was no reason to eat so much, especially in the morning.\u201cI brought you something light,\u201d Ishakan explained. \u201cJust to break your fast.\u201dLeah stared. The table beside the bed was all but groaning under the load.\u201cBut tell me if you want more,\u201d he added. \u201cYou burned a lot of energy last night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt reminded Leah of Genin\u2019s breakfast. Apparently the Kurkans were used to eating this way.Ishakan nudged the table closer to the bed and dragged over a chair for himself, sitting down opposite her. Leah scooted forward on the bed to eat from her own small plate, accepting a knife and fork from Ishakan. They were small, as if they had been created specifically for her hands.Ishakan plunged his hands into a bowl of water and then tore into the bread with them, ignoring the niceties of plate and utensils. Watching him eat with such enthusiasm stimulated her appetite. The food was unfamiliar, but it tasted delicious, and her fork and knife neatly sliced and transferred her portion to her mouth. Vegetables, and then a thin slice of flat toast with cheese on top, salty and savory. There was a steamed dish rolled inside leaves, finely ground meat with fragrant spices, stuffed with grape leaves and cooked in a pot. The rich odor nearly made her salivate, and before she knew it, she had eaten three.She had already eaten too much, but each dish was more curious than the last. Another dish resembled yogurt, but it was a strange creamy color, and when she tasted a spoonful, it had a smoky flavor that wound its way down into her throat. After five more spoonfuls, she identified it as some variety of eggplant.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe almost took a sixth bite when she realized how much she had eaten and set her spoon down, startled. Ishakan glanced at her as she pushed the dish away.\u201cAre you done?\u201d\u201cToo much.\u201d She really shouldn\u2019t have eaten any of the yogurt-thing, but all of the food was so delicious, and unlike anything else she had ever eaten before. But it was no excuse. She regretted her lack of self-control.\u201cWell, eat some fruit.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t making a suggestion. He was giving her a command.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Blood Of A Wolf (2)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Regan--------Despite her refusal, Ishakan lifted a grape to Leah\u2019s mouth, teasingly tracing it over it her lips until she finally conceded and accepted it. He was impossible. But the grape was sweet and delicious, and she held it on her tongue for a moment to savor it. As soon as the first was gone, Ishakan was pressing another on her, and this time she refused, and meant it. Fortunately, he desisted.\u201cThen drink some tea.\u201dNudging a cup of hot tea toward her, he bent his head to his own meal. She was so used to pecking at her food, it was strange to see someone eat with such appetite, working steadily through each dish on the tray, one after another. As he shifted another plate over, Leah cried out a protest.\u201cNo!\u201dIshakan looked up in surprise, a palm date halfway to his lips. His eyebrows lifted.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cJust\u2026not those,\u201d she said awkwardly, her face heating. The last thing Ishakan needed to eat was food that boosted his stamina. He humored her without requiring a further explanation, and she scanned the tray for any other dangerous dishes. If they ate together again in future, she would have to keep a wary eye out for hazardous foodstuffs. Anything that enhanced Ishakan\u2019s energy would ultimately have the opposite effect on her.Pushing the tray aside, he poured himself a cup of tea.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about Count Valtein. He\u2019s being treated well here.\u201dThat was one of the things she had wanted to ask him earlier, so she was grateful for the reassurance. Ishakan looked at her, and then spoke again.\u201cAnd\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I surprised you last night.\u201dLeah\u2019s face burned. It was the subject she most wanted to avoid. Shifting her teacup to hide her face, she forced herself to ask.\u201cWhat\u2026 What happened to you? It was so strange\u2026\u201d\u201cHave you ever seen a dog [email\u00a0protected] ?\u201dNo one else would have dared to ask the Princess of Estia such a question. Ishakan frowned as she shook her head. For a moment he looked troubled, as if he were searching for the proper words.\u201cI hope you have heard, at least, that Kurkans carry the blood of beasts. I possess the blood of a wolf. That is how beasts act when they reproduce.\u201dLeah pictured a wolf, dark brown and golden-eyed, like Ishakan. Unable to resist her curiosity, she asked, \u201cCan you turn into an animal?\u201dHearing her pose the absurd question so seriously, he burst out laughing.\u201cNo. We don\u2019t have that talent, princess.\u201dPeople called them abominations. Leah saw that knowledge in Ishakan\u2019s eyes, the word drenched in bitterness. So little was known about Kurkans in the outside world, leaving their culture, customs, and history open to speculation. Most had heard that they had the blood of beasts in their veins, but nothing more was certain.Leah had tried to investigate further. Most of the people on the mainland despised the Kurkans as barbarians, so even scholars had never taken an interest. It was difficult when she wanted to understand them, and not just as leverage for negotiations. The more she learned, the more curious she became about the country of Ishakan\u2019s birth, the culture to which he belonged, the people that he led.She wanted to know more about Ishakan.Once she realized the dreadful direction her thoughts were heading, she swiftly cut them off.\u201cYou should be thankful I don\u2019t turn into a rampaging beast,\u201d Ishakan was saying. \u201cIt would be hard for you to handle, princess.\u201dOf course, he had no idea what she had been thinking, and she pretended calm, shifting the conversation.\u201cThe important thing is the slavers,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to address the root of the problem.\u201dThe slave traders were dead. No nobles of high status were included on the list of casualties, but nobles considered slave auctions vulgar, and sent representatives instead of attending themselves. No one would object now. No one would want to draw attention to the event.But of course, that wouldn\u2019t change public opinion, which would remain hostile to the Kurkans.Ishakan chuckled softly, setting down his teacup. Leah\u2019s cup was still almost untouched.\u201cWill there be negotiations when we get back?\u201d She asked.His eyes closed. Kurkans had an ingrained thirst for victory.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe thought excited me so much, I could hardly sleep, princess.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not answering me,\u201d Leah said, avoiding his eyes as they slitted open.\u201cAh.\u201dShe had asked the question without expecting much.

Gypsies (1)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Regan--------The sky was dark. Moist air covered the forest in a thick blanket, wafting through the trees, stirring their leaves with uneasy breezes that warned of rain. Dozens of people crowded into the area to breath the fresh air, all present to witness the prince\u2019s hunt.A hound scoured the damp earth while squires chased away the smaller prey, clearing the Prince\u2019s path so he could hunt more easily.Count Weddleton stood next to the Crown Prince, holding their horses by their reins. As Cerdina\u2019s biological father, Count Weddleton was obliged to follow Blaine when he decided to go hunting, even though Blaine did not care for his companionship.The Count brought up several topics over the course of their conversation, skirting his real topic until he finally mustered the courage to broach the subject.\u201cWas there any discussion of reforming the tax system during the last cabinet council meeting?\u201d he asked. The Prince\u2019s blue eyes flicked toward him, but despite their icy stare, the count refused to retreat. \u201cIt seems Princess Leah wants to press on, despite Byun Geongbaek\u2019s opposition\u2026\u201dPrince Blaine raised an eyebrow. It was the only response to the Count\u2019s questions; his lips were pressed into a thin line. His expressionless face made the Count shiver nervously, and he thanked his lucky stars that Blaine\u2019s bow was focused on a distant bush, rather than something in his own direction.Silence stretched between them. Blaine narrowed his eyes as a vein swelled in his hand, his arms straining with the effort to firmly draw the bowstring. The arrow flew the instant its point found a target, and an instant later, the bellow of a wounded creature echoed through the forest. A stag bounded out of the bushes, its huge antlers like ivory branches.Stumbling forward, the deer\u2019s body struck the ground with a heavy thud. Warm, fresh blood flowed from its neck and squires quickly ran to inspect the fallen beast.\u201cWonderful, Crown Prince!\u201d Count Weddleton said cheerfully.He had displayed exquisite marksmanship. Anyone else would have been pleased to demonstrate such mastery and fell a deer so soon, but Blaine simply watched silently.\u201cSend it to the Queen\u2019s palace,\u201d he said indifferently.The squires hefted the deer carcass and Blaine stared at the place where it had lain, its blood still staining the flattened grass and soaking into the earth.\u201cI wonder if the barbarian king likes the hunt,\u201d he said slowly.\u201cHow could he not?\u201d Count Weddleton replied, as if he had been anxiously awaiting an opportunity to speak. \u201cThey are beasts by nature. The barbarians are said to forgo weapons altogether, and kill their prey with their bare hands.\u201dThere were plenty of such stories, and Count Weddleton was happy to speak ill of the barbarous Kurkans, who were also rumored to use their teeth to tear into their prey\u2019s flesh once they killed it. Listening, Blaine laughed for the first time.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind hunting with him,\u201d he said, smiling.***The incident with the slave traders had become a subject of gossip throughout Estia and the rest of the continent. Estia was the center of the slave trade, so such stories spread quickly and affected the rest of the black market. Slave traders had been eliminated and their wealth lost. With the supply of such a valuable commodity eliminated, the prices of the remainder of the slaves skyrocketed. \u2013Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe nobles were enraged and would have complained about all the freed Kurkans roaming the streets, but they were forced to hold their tongues. Slavery was illegal. The slave traders who had lined their pockets with filthy money were now inhabiting the underworld, so the nobles that had employed and patronized them didn\u2019t dare to become involved with the affair, lest they share their fate.A rumor circulated claiming that Byun Gyeongbaek of Oberde would protest on behalf of the nobles at the next cabinet council meeting. Did he honestly believe that Princess Leah would quietly accept such a protest? The Kurkans hated the man. But it seemed impossible that the matter would be resolved peacefully. Byun Gyeongbaek seemed determined to disrupt the upcoming negotiations with the Kurkans, and some claimed he was trying to provoke a military confrontation.Leah had to find a solution.After the action against the slave traders, Count Valtein had lost a significant amount of weight. He had already explained to Leah what had happened, after he had been separated from her that day.\u201cSo I don\u2019t think I can eat meat at the moment\u2026 especially not anything raw\u2026\u201d he had concluded, downcast.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gypsies (2)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Regan--------Count Valtein had become a strong advocate for friendly diplomatic relations with the Kurkans. Leah praised his hard work and gave him a leave of absence. The man needed a few days off after what he had been through.Together, they had decided not to increase the number of Kurkan hostages they would keep as bargaining chips. More were unnecessary. Unlike his predecessor, Ishakan was a king that went out of his way to protect his people. Leah suspected that Ishakan would accept a deal even if they only had a single Kurkan.Of course, with that in her favor, it made it much easier to commit to a peace treaty. Leah was working hard to end the negotiations favorably, and while this was stressful enough, she always had other concerns.The atmosphere in the royal palace had quickly soured. After Cerdina flaunted the purple silk dress that she had stolen from her, Leah ordered Countess Melissa to ignore the theft and effectively sweep it under the rug. But it wasn\u2019t because she intended to do nothing. With no investigation and no known culprit, the princess\u2019s ladies-in-waiting began to eye each other with suspicion. Those who truly served Leah took it upon themselves to discover the detestable traitor.If matters escalated and someone was proven guilty, then Leah would have to intervene. The thought of a traitor bothered her, but the discord among her ladies-in-waiting was even more troubling.Suddenly, Ishakan\u2019s voice echoed in her thoughts.\u2014The queen is a Tomari.When he told her that, it left her speechless. Ishakan had laughed.\u2014Do you want to know more?Stunned, Leah nodded. She had almost spilled her cup of tea, her insides tight with tension.\u2014I will tell you in the future, he said lightly, and maddeningly. Maybe you should use this as an excuse to see me again.He had predicted exactly what she would do. After their first night at the inn, she had been determined to never see him again, but somehow he always anticipated her and blocked every escape. And she had had no choice but to return the palace, with all her questions unanswered.Of course, it was possible that Ishakan had lied, but they had not been discussing formal negotiations, and it had clearly not been a joke. The fact that Kurkans had had multiple altercations with Gypsies recently lent further credence to his claims. Gypsies were nearly as despised as Kurkans. Nobles would not accept intermarriage with Gypsies; it would be like marrying a Kurkan. If Cerdina was really of Gypsy descent, it could upend the royal household and even upset the succession. If Prince Blaine had Gypsy blood in his veins, it might be enough to keep him off the throne.But as intriguing as all that way, Leah knew better than to make an issue of it now. She needed more information first. But it kept swimming to the surface of her mind. Even as she prepared to leave, she was thinking of Cerdina, replaying previous events in her mind and assimilating it with this new information.\u201cPrincess,\u201d Countess Melissa said impatiently, \u201cAre you sure you want to see him again?\u201dThe question stopped Leah in her tracks.\u201cI should\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll do something to you again.\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think he will. But I admit I can\u2019t be sure.\u201d Leah turned to the Countess. \u201cPlease, stay by my side.\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d the Countess replied, her fists clenching with determination. Leah smiled, and they moved on together. She needed to meet someone to do, but she couldn\u2019t trust her other ladies-in-waiting. Only the Countess was permitted to accompany her to the main palace where the nobles met.***At the main palace, the nobles greeted Leah and she returned their courtesies polite, scanning the crowd. It only took a moment before she found the man she was looking for, surrounded by a crowd and chatting happily until he sensed Leah\u2019s gaze.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe moved toward him. His expression shifted at her approach, bewildered that she would come to him so openly, until she stopped directly in front of him. That he dared to stare at her was rude and disrespectful, but everyone nearby was doing the same. Leah had never been the first to approach him. She spoke first, leaning toward him.Leah began to walk towards the man. As she got closer, the man\u2019s expression became more bewildered. Even after she caught up with him, stopping her steps right in front of his eyes, he continued to stare at her in bewilderment. His gaze could be considered rude and disrespectful, but the other nobles around her looked at her in the same way, astonished. Perhaps because Leah had been the first to approach. \u2013\u201cAre you busy?\u201dThe man looked at her as if his soul had left his body. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not busy,\u201d he stammered.\u201cThen, let\u2019s talk for a moment, Byun Gyeongbaek of Oberde,\u201d she said politely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fianc\u00e9e of Byun Gyeongbaek of Oberde (1)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Regan--------The easiest way to handle Byun Gyeongbaek was to capitalize on his weaknesses. Leah knew that if she kept manipulating his sensitive ego, then he would inevitably make stupid and careless decisions.Initially, she hadn\u2019t planned to do this, but the Kurkans\u2019 action at the auction house had put Byun Geongbaek at a disadvantage. Watching freed Kurkans boldly walking the streets of the capitol had added insult to injury, and might well provoke the impatient man into action. There were already rumors that he would begin military maneuvers. Leah had no choice but to intervene.In the past, she had always treated Byun Gyeongbaek with cold indifference. The fact that she had approached to initiate conversation must have bewildered him, and he remained aloof and distracted, watching her warily. It made Leah\u2019s task even easier.With her business concluded, she dismissed him and beckoned to Countess Melissa, who had been nervously watching from a distance.\u201cI believe things will unfold as you have wished,\u201d Leah told her.The Countess sighed, her hand fluttering over her chest. \u201cPrincess! Why do you have to keep doing such dangerous things?\u201d she asked. She was concerned, but her eyes sparkled. \u201cByun Gyeongbaek must be going crazy,\u201d she laughed. \u201cHow dare he challenge the Princess?\u201dBut her laughter faded as she considered her own words.\u201cI am worried,\u201d she added anxiously. \u201cYou spoke bravely to him, but we don\u2019t know the limits of his ambition, or what he might do to achieve it\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Leah assured her. \u201cHe can\u2019t have it all.\u201dHe had taken the bait she had dangled in front of him. By the time he discovered the truth, it would be too late, and Leah\u2019s plans would be too far advanced to stop. The knowledge was a load off her shoulders.\u201cWould you like to take a walk, Countess?\u201d she asked.The Countess smiled, reassured. \u201cIt would be my pleasure, Princess.\u201dTogether, they headed for the garden, and Leah deliberately chose less frequented paths so they could stroll without being overheard.\u201cI want to tell you something,\u201d she began, and the Countess\u2019s eyes widened. Leah laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything will be fine.\u201dThe Countess\u2019s eyes drifted to Leah\u2019s neck, concealed by the high neck of the gown she wore. No doubt she was remembering what she had seen that morning. Fortunately, they had been alone, and she had seen the bruise on Leah\u2019s delicate skin, with many other frightening marks on her pale neck. \u2013She hadn\u2019t pried, choosing instead to attend her princess in silence. And when she dressed her, it was in a modest high-necked dress, covering her all the way to her throat.\u201cPrincess,\u201d she finally said.\u201cYes, Countess.\u201d\u201cYou know that whatever you ask of me, I will do without hesitation\u2026\u201d She trailed off anxiously, clearly worried about Leah\u2019s honor and what it might mean for her safety. The Countess knew what would happen to an impure bride.No doubt she had also heard from Count Valtein, who had seen Leah and Ishakan together at the auction and warned the Countess. Countess Melissa was not always good at verbalizing her thoughts, but now she spoke without hesitation.\u201cI have heard\u2026 I have heard that there are Gypsies who sell potions that can deceive others. It is said that if you consume one, the world around you will change and become difficult to discern. The person\u2019s vision will become hazy and dreamlike. If you need one\u2026I will buy it for you before you leave.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLeah understood what she was offering. If Leah had lost her v!rginity to Ishakan, then Leah could make Byun Gyeongbaek drink a potion during their first night together, and deceive him by sprinkling a few drops of animal blood to stain the bed. He would never notice.Despite her own noble status, the Countess wouldn\u2019t betray Leah. She was volunteering to help her lie to the royal family and deceive Byun Gyeongbaek.\u201cI believe in you, Princess,\u201d she said, her eyes moist and reddened from the pain in her heart. \u201cI believe there is always a reason for your decisions. But please share your burdens with me so I can help carry the weight.\u201dThe Countess knew Leah better than anyone, and knew that Leah often chose to deal with problems personally, forgoing outside help. But however hard she tried to conceal her problems from others, they only seemed to double. As soon as she solved more, more would appear. And Leah didn\u2019t want to risk anyone else. She knew the stakes of the game, and knew its conclusion. How could she reveal her plans to the Countess when they ultimately ended with her own death?\u201cThank you,\u201d said Leah softly. If nothing else, she was grateful for the offer. \u201cWhen the time comes, I will ask for your help.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fianc\u00e9e of Byun Gyeongbaek of Oberde (2)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Regan--------The day for negotiations had arrived. The morning sky was clear.As it was only the first round of negotiations, they agreed to send three representatives from Estia and three from the Kurkans to attend. Leah represented on behalf of the royal family, with Count Valtein and Finance Minister Laurent to assist her. They arrived first, scanning the empty meeting room before they sat down. The Finance Minister was nervous and trying to hide it; he was already afraid of the Kurkans, and he knew what Leah was about to attempt. Stiff as statues, they were nearly holding their breaths as the doors open. Leah stood as a sign of respect.\u201cI welcome the King of the Kurkans,\u201d Leah greeted them.\u201cMay light fall upon Estia.\u201d Ishakan smiled in response. \u201cIt has been a long time, Princess.\u201dThe sight of him sent a wave of emotion through Leah. She felt a tingling nervousness, and though she tried to keep a serene expression on her face, she was sure her expression was giving her away. Count Valtein kept sending her glances, but she kept her eyes on the Kurkan representatives and pretended not to notice.She hadn\u2019t expected Ishakan to bring Genin and Haban, but there they were, bowing. Strictly speaking, the two could not help Ishakan in diplomatic matters, but she was grateful for their presence anyway. The fact that she knew them calmed her, and this business would have been more difficult with strangers.Though Ishakan had continually disturbed her and shaken her heart since the day she met him, she couldn\u2019t help feeling bitter. She knew what the Kurkans thought of these negotiations. No matter what Estia did, they would approve the peace treaty.Ishakan seemed to be in a good mood. Despite Leah\u2019s aloofness, he took his seat beside her comfortably.\u201cI am honored to have the opportunity to personally converse with you, Princess. I have only heard rumors,\u201d he said.This was obviously a lie. They had spoken before. They had done a great deal more than speak. But at least he was speaking politely and behaving himself, given the formality of the occasion.\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Leah replied mildly. \u201cIn truth, it is my honor that we can have this discussion.\u201dWith the formal greetings complete, the negotiations could begin. Ishakan immediately seemed determined to get her into trouble.\u201cSo, what did you think?\u201d He asked. It was an ambiguous question, and Leah hesitated. Ishakan shook his head. \u201cMy question refers to the initiation of our conversation.\u201dShe knew he would keep pressing until she have him the answer she wanted.\u201cIt is an excellent beginning,\u201d she sighed.Ishakan burst out laughing. \u201cThank you for your hospitality, Princess,\u201d he said, with a bright smile, pleased.Count Valtein and Minister Laurent glanced at each other, perplexed. Choosing to ignore Ishakan\u2019s impudence, Leah focused her attention on the documents she had prepared.\u201cFirst, I want you to read this,\u201d she began, handing Ishakan a document detailing the agenda of the day\u2019s negotiations. But he had no intention of reading it.\u201cMy understanding of the language of this continent is poor,\u201d he said, setting the papers aside. \u201cCan you explain it to me instead, please?\u201dShe knew he wanted to get straight to the major points of contention and considered niceties like agendas unnecessary. He wanted to conclude the negotiations quickly and then simply chat with her.\u201cEstia has prepared several concessions,\u201d she said, relenting. \u201cFirst, we will hand over the Kurkans currently in our custody. The royal family currently has thirty Kurkans that we have rescued from slavery. Secondly, we will lend a portion of the western territory to the Kurkans for an indefinite period of time, including the proceeds obtained from the harvests in that region\u2026\u201dThe premise of a negotiation was that each party involved should state their terms and conditions, and then work together to adjust the details and make concessions to resolve any disputes. But as she spoke, Ishakan just smiled, leaning back in his chair with his arms folded.He chuckled when she finished. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201dThe conditions she had presented were certainly appealing. But for the King of the Kurkans, who did not fear war, might consider the only appealing offer was to hand the entire country over to him.Leah took a deep breath. She knew Ishakan did not always respond to things that looked like common sense. But she was the princess of a kingdom without power, and she only had one option left. Setting the documents aside, she met his glinting golden gaze.\u201cYou are aware that I am the fianc\u00e9e of Byun Gyeongbaek of Oberde?\u201dIshakan\u2019s eyes narrowed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCertainly,\u201d he said, adding in a hard voice. \u201cAnd when he marries you, Princess, Byun Gyeongbaek of Oberde will have the right to succeed to the throne.\u201dThe room was deadly silent. Ishakan\u2019s relaxed good humor had vanished utterly.\u201cHe could succeed immediately,\u201d Leah agreed.\u201cAre you telling me that you are going to make Byun Gyeongbaek the King of Estia?\u201d He asked. His voice sounded fierce.

Take The Royal Princess of Estia (1)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Regan--------The room fell silent. Ishakan stared at Leah. Her breath quickened under his sharp eyes, though she tried her best to remain impassive and ignore the panic tightening in her chest.According to the Estian laws of succession, women could not inherit the throne. Prince Blaine was currently the only legitimate heir. But if Byun Gyeonbaek became part of the royal family by marrying Leah\u2026That was what Leah had told him, when she had last spoken to him. He could become king if he took her hand, and that was all she needed to say. The greed in his eyes had glowed green. In that moment, his imagination had spread wings and soared away.But those ambitious dreams would be shattered.There was one crucial condition: their marriage would have to survive for a certain period of time before his position was legitimized. If Leah died on her first night with Byun, his right to the succession would die before it was born. All his ambitions would be in vain.She had hidden that portion of the truth from him. Her sweet words had calmed him and distracted him. With that, she had ensured that he would not take action while the negotiations proceeded, though she couldn\u2019t deny the possibility that things might get more complicated later on. If that time came, she could not afford to be shy or hesitant. Leah would need to be as confident as she was now, sitting before Ishakan.\u201cGreat,\u201d Ishakan finally said. He ran his fingers through his hair, discouraged. \u201cI have to admit, you brought up an unexpected argument.\u201dHaban\u2019s mouth was open in surprise, and Genin\u2019s eyes looked like they were going to pop out of their sockets. Ishakan straightened up, no longer lounging against his seat, and smiled at Leah.\u201cFine. I accept your terms and will sign the peace treaty.\u201dSurprise flashed briefly across Leah\u2019s face and her eyes widened. Was it really that easy? But unfortunately for her, Ishakan was a formidable opponent.\u201cIn addition, I request a demonstration of confidence from Estia,\u201d he said.Instantly, the requests he might make and the countermeasures she might suggest sprang into her mind. But Ishakan wasn\u2019t done.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that there\u2019s nothing better than a marriage alliance to strengthen the solidarity between two countries.\u201dLeah blinked. He leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table, his chin propped in his hands. He looked confident and fierce, his voice seductive.\u201cI would like to take the royal princess of Estia for my betrothed,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d shouted Finance Minister Laurent, rising from his chair. Count Valtein caught him by his clothes and pulled him back down.Genin and Haban, standing at attention behind Ishakan, examined the Finance Minister, and then looked back at Ishakan, tension clear despite their expressionless eyes. Count Valtein understood what they were thinking, and under the table he kicked the Finance Minister as a warning.Ishakan watched the interplay, untroubled. \u201cIsn\u2019t this a similar condition to yours? Comparing them, they seem exactly the same. You shouldn\u2019t be too surprised by this.\u201dExtending his long fingers, he tapped the table lightly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLet\u2019s end the discussion at this point for today.

Over the course of their discussion, she had forgotten his massive figure, less noticeable while he was seated. Now, his massive form was once again revealed. Ishakan smiled down at her, looking intently at her for a moment, and then left the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Take The Royal Princess of Estia (2)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Regan--------As the door closed behind them, Leah clasped her hands tightly together. Instead of saying goodbye to the King of the Kurkans, Count Valtein and the Finance Minister only exhaled deeply as they watched him leave. It was like coming back to life without the suffocating pressure of his presence.Leah was thinking. There was something behind that enigmatic smile Ishakan had given her as he left, as if he had been hinting something to her. Gathering up all the documents she had diligently prepared, she stood. Count Valtein and Minister Laurent were sprawled over the table soulessly, and looked up in surprise.\u201cPrincess?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going somewhere,\u201d she said vaguely. She left hurriedly without dispelling their confusion.But as soon as she opened the chamber door, she was met with a surprise. Ishakan was waiting for her, and she almost crashed into his chest, stopping abruptly on her toes. He was amused.\u201cWhere shall we go?\u201d He asked cheekily, as assured as if they had agreed on a date. Leah realized she had a long way to go before she could triumph over this man.There was only one place in their current location that was both suitable and secluded. She grabbed Ishakan and led him down the long corridor to the Glory Room. It was filled with paintings and sculptures oriented toward the circular window set in the domed ceiling. A single beam of bright light passed through the window to illuminate the floor. It was meant to symbolize the ambitions of Estia, the country\u2019s hope for unwavering glory and for the light to shine only upon them.Although Estia\u2019s artists worked tirelessly to fill the room with their creations, pouring their hearts into every piece, the sight frustrated Leah. She was fed up with the empty vanity and colorful ostentation of Estia. The masterpieces might represent something noble, but the same couldn\u2019t be true of her nation. The country would have been better served by selling half the masterpieces in the royal palace to fill the empty treasury.That included the pieces on display in the Glory Room, but the noble families who valued this display of virtue\u2013which only they were allowed to see\u2013would never allow it. So she had to keep her wish to herself.Ishakan looked surprised as he entered. But instead of looking at the statues and paintings, he looked up at the ceiling, to the small window. As Leah approached him, he pushed her gently under the light, making her silver hair glow and her purple eyes sparkle, enchanting. He smiled.\u201cHow pretty,\u201d he said, making her face redden at the praise. That he had chosen to direct the unexpected compliment to her instead of the masterpieces surrounding them made it impossible to look him in the eye. But he was as persistent as ever, placing his hands on her shoulders and bending to lay a sweet kiss on her forehead, and then another softly on her cheek.She tried not to look at his mouth as he drew away. She was surprised he hadn\u2019t stolen a kiss from her lips.Ishakan let out a sigh. \u201cDid you eat breakfast?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cWhat did you eat?\u201d\u201cFruits and vegetables.\u201d\u201cHow much?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHalf a plate of salad and peaches,\u201d she replied, though she felt he was questioning her too closely. He looked quite serious as he asked, which bewildered her.\u201cHow many peaches?\u201d He asked earnestly. It was such a ridiculous question, Leah just stared at him. He sighed. \u201cAll right. Then just come and sit for now.\u201dTaking Leah\u2019s wrist, he walked around the room, searching for a place to sit together. The room had no use other than the vanity of Estia.\u201cIs there nowhere to sit?\u201d He asked, disappointed.He ended up sitting down in front of a statue, leaning against it and patting his thigh, offering it to Leah as a seat. She was skeptical.\u201cWe don\u2019t have chairs, after all,\u201d He shrugged, smiling mischievously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Countless Thoughts (1)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Regan--------Leah thought Ishakan was taking advantages of the situation, but impulsively she sat down on his thighs anyway. He embraced her politely and firmly, but was careful not to touch her inappropriately. She couldn\u2019t help but giggle. He was acting like a real chair.There was a sense of comfort and stability as she leaned against him, stretching from her chest to her fingertips. It was a peculiar situation, and she had to restrain herself from resting her face on his shoulder.Ishakan pulled a palm-sized cookie out of his pocket, wrapped in a paper bag. It was a mix of chocolate chips, fruit, and nuts, lush enough that it seemed like half the cookie would be enough to fill her stomach. He slipped the wrapper off and placed the cookie in Leah\u2019s hand.\u201cYou haven\u2019t forgotten your promise, have you?\u201dRight. The promise to accept whatever he gave her was still valid. Leah looked at the cookie for a long time before she took a careful bite. Chewing it delicately, she found it pleasantly moist, the sweetness awakening all her dormant senses. She swallowed and pronounced it delicious.Her mouth watered at the thought of more, but she handed the rest back to Ishakan, ignoring her pleading taste buds. Instead of taking the cookie, he took her hand and guided it to his own mouth, taking a bite that was just as small as hers.\u201cTastes good,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you eat more?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m full,\u201d she replied, and quickly changed the subject. She didn\u2019t want him to ask her to eat more.\u201dPlease tell me about the queen.\u201dWhen it seemed that changing the subject wouldn\u2019t be enough and he would complain, she added, \u201cHow did you know she was a Gypsy?\u201dShe waited for him to answer her question, but however long she waited, not a word came out of his mouth. She was about to press him some more when suddenly he chuckled and moved Leah\u2019s hand, still clutching the cookie in her fingers, back to her lips. He knew she was trying to stop him from making her eat more. He wasn\u2019t easily fooled.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you as soon as you finish eating,\u201d he said. Sweetness flashed in his eyes as he smiled, and looking up at them, she agreed and bit slowly into the cookie once more.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHer taste buds were happy to receive the rich sugary flavor, the soft texture of the cookie, the robust crunch of the nuts and the melting chocolate, blending with the pieces of fruit. She felt euphoric with the sensations, but she still regretted it. She shouldn\u2019t have taken that first bite, it would have been much easier to control her impulses if she hadn\u2019t tasted it. Now the cookie was implanted in her mind. It was harassing her with its presence.But even though she knew she shouldn\u2019t eat it, she couldn\u2019t stop herself. The impulsive desire was unfamiliar, but the craving made her devour more and more until it was gone. She was embarrassed. She had been lying. She had never been full.Ishakan reached out and gently grazed the corners of her lips, brushing the cookie crumbs away. Reflexively, she squeezed the wrapper. She had soiled herself, eating so hastily.She was embarrassed. She must have looked very rude, forgoing all etiquette to enjoy a snack. Unfortunately, this seemed like a recurring pattern. She didn\u2019t know why, but every time she was with Ishakan her usually miniscule appetite increased dramatically. She felt guilty for her lack of self control.Regretting it, she fiddled with the cookie wrapper until Ishakan took it from her and crumpled it up. And all she could think as she watched was that she yearned for more cookies\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Countless Thoughts (2)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Regan--------Leah realized what she was thinking and chided herself harshly. When she had looked in the mirror last night, she had gained weight. Now, since she had eaten the cookie, she would starve herself the rest of the day to be sure she wouldn\u2019t gain any more. Perhaps she should consider a smaller breakfast tomorrow morning, too.\u201cI finished the cookie,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, will you answer my questions?\u201d\u201cWell, okay,\u201d Ishakan replied reluctantly. Leah gave him a sharp look and he sighed. \u201cWell, there\u2019s a Kurkan who knows sorcery. I found out the Queen is a gypsy with his help.\u201d\u201cSorcery\u2026 So that Kurkan is also a Gypsy?\u201d\u201cYes. Tomari blood flows within him.\u201dSurprised, Leah took a deep breath. Unlike the Kurkans, whose savage heritage was visible at a glance, gypsies\u2019 features were more subtle and lacked any animal quality. The two groups had always been antagonistic to each other. Even now the gypsies were fleeing from the Kurkans\u2019 persecution.It was clear that there was more that Ishakan hadn\u2019t told her, aside from the fact that the two groups were somehow related.Leah hesitated.\u201cWhy\u2026why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner?\u201d She asked.\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t an excuse. Leah had been busy, too, with all the problems cropping up around her.\u201cBesides,\u201d Ishakan added, \u201cThere was no reason to tell you, right? You\u2019ll put Byun Gyeongbaek on the throne if I allow you to bend me, princess. I have to keep some secrets.\u201dLeah kept her mouth shut. She could feel his intense gaze on her, and it felt strange to pretend to ignore it, since their faces were only inches apart. He wasn\u2019t shy about examining her, his deep, dark pupils seeming to peer inside her.\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d he said.She closed her eyes, drawing a deep breath. She had wondered what Ishakan would have done, if he were in her situation. Now, she knew. The moment the slightest opportunity presented itself, he would cut the shackles from his ankles without a moment\u2019s hesitation. And he would not flee far. He would claim vengeance on those that had subdued and mistreated him. It was not difficult to imagine Ishakan stained with the blood of her enemies.Her efforts seemed insignificant in comparison. He wouldn\u2019t understand her. He wouldn\u2019t comprehend her desire.\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026do it,\u201d she whispered. His eyes narrowed, and she stopped trying to avoid them. She met his gaze. \u201cSecuring the peace treaty is my last duty to Estia.\u201dAs much as she wanted to die, she didn\u2019t want to end her life irresponsibly. People who were precious to her would live on after her death. She wanted to build a solid foundation for them.\u201cOh.\u201d Ishakan sighed deeply and ran a hand over her face. \u201cI\u2019m in trouble\u2026\u201dShe didn\u2019t understand. She wanted to ask what she meant, but then Ishakan smiled at her.\u201cYour complaint almost makes me want to accept the agreement,\u201d she said quietly. She blinked, surprised at the affection in his musical voice. Her cheeks flushed, and she said quickly,\u201cMaking an important decision just because of something like that\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not the only reason.\u201d He moved closer to her, and she allowed their noses to touch as he whispered, \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201dLeah\u2019s eyes grew very wide.

This was something she had to think about carefully.The Queen of the Kurkans\u2026Though Ishakan had suggested this in their negotiation, she had assumed he was just teasing her. She had never thought that he was truly offering her that position. So many thoughts whirled in her mind, she felt as if there were a storm raging inside her.Was he being honest?

It felt as if it had happened yesterday, Ishakan in her cloak, and she in her disguise.The memory did not alleviate her doubts.It seemed the Kurkans had relationships with Estian dignitaries. It wouldn\u2019t be strange if their King had done something to compromise Leah, who was a key figure in Estian society. She knew how easy it would be for Ishakan to persuade her, and possibly steal Estia\u2019s most sensitive information. Simple reason warned her that she should turn away from him and his lies, but her heart didn\u2019t want to believe that.When she realized she was still doubting after listing twenty-nine different reasons why she shouldn\u2019t trust him, she could only come to one conclusion. Her ability to be objective had been compromised. When it came to Ishakan, she could no longer think properly.He waited silently for her response while Leah wrestled with her thoughts.\u201cIt\u2019s never easy,\u201d he said finally, after a prolonged silence. Leaning forward, he kissed her slowly, softly. It was a simple and loving kiss, without the demand of lust, and he drew back to look into her eyes. \u201cWhat do you want to do after the peace treaty?\u201dShe did not answer.\u201cDo you still want to die?\u201dShe lowered her gaze.\u201cAre you dying for your convenience?\u201d She said nothing. \u201cYou\u2019re dying for your own convenience?\u201dShe couldn\u2019t easily answer any of his questions.She felt adrift from his questions and the feelings he provoked. Her eyes fell on the circle on the floor, the light streaming through the window overhead. It looked like a luminous rope she could climb to escape this suffocating room. She could just imagine a cool breeze blowing all her problems away once she escaped. \u2013Chapter advanced in NovelUtopiaA familiar impulse surged within her, but this time, it wouldn\u2019t go away. It wouldn\u2019t be ignored. It spread through her body.The man whose lap she was sitting in had ruined everything. Even her most irrevocable decision, the one she had sworn she would never change, had been affected by his influence. The hard shell inside her shattered, because of him. Ishakan had destroyed her plans and left everything unstable and dangerous.She was hesitant and choked with remorse.\u201cI don\u2019t want to die,\u201d she whispered. Her throat was tight. She felt as if that simple sentence had torn her to pieces and cut her insides.Ishakan\u2019s golden eyes remained fixed on her. He didn\u2019t press her, he was just paying attention to her as she trembled in his arms. She was shattered inside.\u201cI want to live.\u201d***Since their creation, the Kurkans were an unnatural race. They were born in defiance of natural law and filled with imperfections. They could only live to adulthood and have offspring after performing certain rituals. If they were not allowed to celebrate their initiation rites, then they could not even grow old, and were trapped in the space between adolescence and adulthood forever.Kurkans rescued from slavery were sent back to the desert for their initiations. They were reborn as warriors and then allowed to perform their tasks and live in their towns. Intending to bid them farewell, Ishakan went to the plains outside the capitol, where the wind blew through the tall, thick grass.Unlike the Kurkans who had undergone their rituals, these Kirkans were much smaller, dressed in robes with backpacks on their shoulders. Looking at Ishakan, they waited respectfully for him to address them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMay the sandstorms blow away from your path,\u201d he told them, and they bowed their heads in thanks.A woman at the front of the group spoke carefully.\u201cWe thought our king had abandoned us.\u201dIshakan chuckled.\u201cI, too, was abandoned in the past.\u201d His eyes turned cold as he spoke, remembering his predecessor. \u201cI rose from the same depths you all once inhabited.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bride Kidnapping (2)Translator: Atlas /Editor: Regan--------Genin and Haban watched Ishakan calmly, memories of the past flashing vividly through their minds. When he had decided to become their new king and asked for their help, he swore he would never be like his predecessor.Now he spread his hands.\u201cThe time has come,\u201d he declared. \u201cYou still have a long way to go.\u201dOne by one, he said goodbye to each of the Kurkans. As he was doing so, the Kurkan who had served Leah at the auction house approached Haban.\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he began. \u201cBut that woman who saved us. Do you happen to know where she lives, and if she is single?\u201dHaban was startled by the bold question and froze as if he had been struck by lightning, but the young man continued, ignoring his reaction.\u201cIf she\u2019s single, can I come kidnap her later? I think I fell in love at first sight. Of course, I\u2019ll ask her first if she agrees to being captured into marriage\u2026\u201dGenin clapped her hand over his mouth, forcibly silencing him. The young man was surprised and confused, but Ishakan, who had noticed the scene, smiled.\u201cLushan,\u201d he called calmly.The young man pushed Genin\u2019s hand away from his mouth and glanced between her and Haban before he responded.\u201cYes, my king.\u201dIshakan stared at him. Silently. Gradually, Lushan\u2019s face grew rigid, and he averted his gaze, avoiding Ishakan\u2019s golden eyes. Ishakan didn\u2019t have to speak. The pressure of his eyes was sufficient to make the younger man begin to tremble.\u201cI sincerely hope you won\u2019t carry out any of those plans,\u201d Ishakan said.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Lushan bowed deeply as Haban and Genin looked on with pity. But ignorance was considered a sin. Lushan was lucky that things had ended this way. The Kurkans finished their farewells and left for the desert, and Ishakan watched their backs as they moved through the eulalia.(TL. Eulalia: it is a herbaceous plant)His hair fluttered in the cool breeze, making him think of the hot sun and golden sands of his home. He missed many things about that place. But he couldn\u2019t go back yet. There were still many things to do. Haban and Genin followed behind him as he walked away, conversing,\u201cI think Byun Gyeongbaek of Oberde has gone crazy.\u201d\u201cThe princess only mentioned that he might succeed, and he acts as if he\u2019s already on the throne.\u201dIshakan would be furious if Byun Gyeongbaek married the royal princess and obtained the right to the throne. Byun only had control over the borders because of his military might. But if he gained the power of the royal family through marriage, that would change the whole story. From there he would only need to secure financial resources and the support of the nobles in favor of the princess, and then he would become a true threat to the crown prince\u2019s position.At first, Byun Gyeongbaek had wanted the princess simply to possess a beautiful and honorable wife. But with her hints about the throne, Leah had fanned the embers of his greed, and they were beginning to smolder.\u201cThis country is a mess,\u201d Haban grumbled, \u201cAnd the princess is always sacrificing for it\u2026\u201dIshakan smiled. \u201cThere will always be trouble wherever Gypsies are found,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd what about the Queen?\u201d Genin interjected.\u201cWell, that worries me.\u201d\u201cIf the Queen is a Gypsy, isn\u2019t the palace in danger?\u201d Haban asked gravely.\u201cIt\u2019s more than dangerous. The whole palace is in her hands.\u201dHer spells weren\u2019t omnipotent. They were hard work to maintain and certain conditions had to be fulfilled. But while casting a spell was difficult, the longer it remained active, the more powerful it became and the harder it was to break. The queen had been at the palace for a long time. The place would be riddled with her spells. \u2013\u201cShe could have bewitched the king as well,\u201d Ishakan said.\u201cShe must have cast an ancient spell. Brainwashing, right?\u201d\u201cMaybe. He was the first person she approached.\u201dIt must have taken a lot of effort to gain the king\u2019s love and convince him to banish the previous queen. When Ishakan had last seen the king at the banquet lunch, he definitely had not been in normal condition. The brainwashing must have progressed even further by now. The queen\u2019s influence might have gone so far that the king could no longer distinguish his own thoughts from her commands. But they couldn\u2019t be sure how far the queen had gotten. They just knew she wouldn\u2019t have stopped with a simple spell.Ishakan frowned.\u201cCall Morga,\u201d he ordered.Genin glanced at Haban, her face darkening. She didn\u2019t like this idea.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIf we call Morga,\u201d Haban said, making a last effort to persuade Ishakan against it, \u201cWe might lose track of the Tomaris we\u2019re already following.\u201dIshakan shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around it. This matter is far more urgent.\u201dHaban and Genin looked at each other grimly, but Ishakan had fixed his gaze on the horizon, in the direction of the palace of Estia, though it was too far away to be seen. His lips curved in a smile. He could hear Leah\u2019s small, wavering whisper in his mind, warming the depths of his heart.\u2014I want to live.Ishakan was desperate to fulfill her desires.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
