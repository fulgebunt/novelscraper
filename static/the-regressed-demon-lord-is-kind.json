    "Chapter 1": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind1Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Ah, damn it.\u2019In a children\u2019s storybook that Zich read when he was little, there was a passage that described a great hero\u2019s fall. According to the passage, even the heavens filled with grief at the sight of the dying hero, and rain began to pour down from the sky. He didn\u2019t know exactly why, but even after many years passed, this passage remained stuck inside his mind.\u2018As expected, the heavens don\u2019t seem to love me.\u2019Looking at the bright sun without a cloud in sight, Zich was sure that the heavens must have despised him instead, let alone love a person like him.\u2018Well, it\u2019s pretty understandable why.\u2019Zich couldn\u2019t even count the number of people who cried because of him or remember how many people he had killed. People called him the Demon Lord, who had brought chaos and despair into this world. He didn\u2019t particularly like to dine on blood or flesh, but he also didn\u2019t refuse it when they were offered; and he had lived a kind of life where he used whatever means to achieve a goal.If the heavens really loved him, they would\u2019ve slapped Zich across the face and told him to change his ways.\u201cIs it over?\u201dZich heard a voice. It was such a heroic and noble voice that it was irritating. He lowered his gaze from the sky and looked forward. A man wearing shiny armor looked down at Zich with a haughty look on his face. He was the man called \u2018Hero Among Heroes\u2019.With a cringy, almost disgusting, title called \u2018The Sun Warrior\u2019, he was the human named Glen Zenard.\u2018So handsome.\u2019Zich wished he could spit on a face like that at least once.\u2018Should I give it a try?\u2019Zich considered the angle, his left-over stamina, the guy\u2019s evasion speed, and so on\u2014even in his dazed state, he was able to calculate these kinds of things fast.\u2018No, I shouldn\u2019t.\u2019This was his end. Zich didn\u2019t want to lose his cool at the last moment to something like this. He still had some pride, since the people in this world called him the Demon Lord.\u2018Ah, but wait. When did I have pride in something like that?\u2019Zich was moving his mouth to fire a spit right at the tip of Glen\u2019s perfectly-shaped, sculpted nose when Glen suddenly exclaimed\u2014\u201cYour evil deeds will come to an end now, Demon Lord Zich Moore!\u201d\u2018What a cheesy line to say.\u2019It was uncreative. Really uncreative. As if he was really a hero from a storybook, Glen reiterated lines that only characters from a moldy, third-rate hero novel would say.\u2018Shouldn\u2019t he have stopped reading children\u2019s storybooks by now?\u2019However, Zich didn\u2019t even have the strength to respond to him. He could only blink at the glorious hero before him and stare.\u201cQuickly finish him! Our opponent is the \u2018Demon Lord of Strength\u2019. We don\u2019t know when he will regain his powers!\u201d\u201cYes! That\u2019s right!\u201d\u2018No, I don\u2019t have any powers left. My body hurts, and I don\u2019t want to move.\u2019Zich wanted to explain this to the hero\u2019s companions, who were telling the hero to finish him off. But it was tiring to even open his mouth. Furthermore, he wondered if there was any purpose in explaining this to them.\u2018They can be on their guard if they wish.\u2019He thought it was a bit funny to see them fuss over his dying body.Yet, it also made him feel a bit pleased. Didn\u2019t their words mean that he posed a huge threat?\u201cNo, he no longer has the power to harm us.\u201dZich\u2019s enjoyment suddenly evaporated with Glen\u2019s words.\u2018This guy is really not fun.\u2019\u2018I should\u2019ve tried to destroy him first instead of spending my time doing useless things.\u2019Zich wasn\u2019t thinking along the lines of, \u2018If only I had gotten ridden of this guy, I\u2026!\u2019He just purely wanted to tear this annoying guy\u2019s face apart.Slam!The hero lifted his sword and pushed it up against Zich. The holy sword\u2019s edges looked sharp enough to rip even a soul in half.\u201cListen, Zich Moore! Before you die, I will recite every evil deed you have committed!\u201d\u2018What kind of bullshit is this?\u2019The hero began to spout nonsense, and Zich looked at the companions around him.\u2018To think that they hung around a guy like him. Indeed, they are very impressive guys.\u2019Compared to the giant fireballs that they shot at him, the shields that blocked his attacks, the arrows aimed at his vulnerable spots, or the miracles that had maxed out their companions\u2019 skill stats or instantly healed their companies\u2019 injuries, staying around a guy like this seemed more impressive to Zich than anything else.\u2018Well, it can\u2019t be helped. I guess I have to listen to this.\u2019Even if his opponents had formed a party to fight him, Zich couldn\u2019t deny that he, who was called the \u2018Demon Lord of Strength\u2019, was defeated.\u2018What can a loser do but let the winner do as he pleases?\u2019Zich strained to pry his eyes open and stared at the hero. As if he was completely immersed in his role, Glen spat out words without even looking at Zich.\u2018Did he come here prepared with everything memorized?\u2019If that was the case, Zich thought he should applaud Glen for his efforts.\u2018No, wait. If I think about it, isn\u2019t this something that should hurt my pride? He must have only thought of beating me.\u2019For a moment, emotions began to erupt in Zich, but he repressed them.\u2018Forget it. It\u2019s true that I lost.\u2019If he won, it would\u2019ve been different, but to get angry about something like this after losing would only make him seem like a sore loser. It was only appropriate that he should act like a loser if he lost. Thus, he lay down lifelessly and listened to his \u2018evil deeds\u2019.\u2018Oh, that\u2019s right, something like that happened. Oh yeah, that too. This is making me reminisce. He must have done a lot of research.\u2019Like an old man trapped his past memories, Zich listened to all of the things he had done. They described a bloody path which befitted his nickname, \u2018Demon Lord\u2019.\u201c\u2026With all of these sins in mind, I lay down my judgment of justice to the Demon Lord, Zich Moore!\u201d\u2018What? It\u2019s already over?\u2019Zich woke up from his pool of memories and nostalgia that the hero\u2019s speech reinvigorated. He licked his lips in pity.\u2018Well, I received quite a good gift on my way out.\u2019This was really his end. Zich carefully scanned the figures around him again. The young magician was glaring at him with contempt, the swordsman was on guard to protect the hero if an emergency arose, and the archer was also still on high alert with a cold-hearted face. The female saint was crying and praying for even a complete stranger like Zich. And finally, the hero was confidently holding his sword.The hero\u2019s sword slowly rose above Zich, and he would die the moment it fell. Zich knew that he couldn\u2019t escape his end. He didn\u2019t even think about struggling to survive.\u2018But.\u2019He began to gather up the last remaining amount of power he had.\u2018Since I am called the Demon Lord, I can\u2019t just die.\u2019Like the other demon lords in storybooks, he cast a curse on the hero.Among the magic tools that he had collected while traveling the world, there was an item that had a similar effect to that of a curse.\u2018They definitely said it was called \u2018The Key that Distorts Destiny\u2019.\u2019It was the name of the small blade that he had inserted inside his index finger. It had been very troublesome for him to stick the thing inside his finger while not experiencing discomfort in his daily life. But thanks to that, he now had the opportunity to give the last blow to his annoying opponent\u2014making the trouble worth it.\u2018It won\u2019t be enough to kill him.\u2019This item wasn\u2019t for something like that, but for someone like Zich, who loved to fuck his opponents over, it really fitted him.\u2018It\u2019s a small blade that can change the future of someone whose destiny has changed. I don\u2019t know how his future will change though.\u2019But it didn\u2019t matter. All the other demon lords were already dead. It wasn\u2019t hard to imagine that Glen Zenard, who had finally killed the last Demon Lord, Zich, would be guaranteed a heroic future. Even if Glen\u2019s future changed for the better, it just meant that his already heroic future would shine a bit brighter. But if his future changed for the worse\u2026\u2018Let\u2019s take a test, hero. If you continue to walk a heroic path even if you get hit by this, it\u2019s your win. But if the destiny you are about to face is full of darkness, it will be more miserable than anyone else\u2019s.\u2019Zich really hoped for Glen to meet the latter. The only regrettable thing was that there was no way for him to see this happen.\u201cIf you are born again, I hope that you will be someone who does good!\u201dLike a judge giving his final judgement, Glen yelled while swinging his sword down.Zich, who had been lying down lifelessly suddenly got up.\u201cIf I get the chance, I will!\u201d\u201cBut not now!\u201dPush!Glen\u2019s sword sliced across Zich\u2019s body from his left shoulder.Even as his body was getting sliced, Zich focused all of his attention onto his index finger. Then, a sharp, gold piece steadily popped out.Glen looked surprised, and his companions moved in a hurry.\u2018But I\u2019m faster!\u2019Push!It wasn\u2019t a critical hit. Zich was in bad condition, and Glen\u2019s magic barrier was too strong for him to land a critical hit.But due to Glen\u2019s carelessness, the tiny blade that he had poured all of his power into was able to slide through the barrier and leave a small scratch.\u201cYou bastaaaaaard!\u201dGlen\u2019s stone-like face crumpled.\u2018Hahahahaha!\u2019In contrast to Glen, Zich wanted to burst into laughter. But like a marionette that had lost all of its strings, he couldn\u2019t move his body and face.Swing!Glen\u2019s body moved once again and sliced Zich\u2019s neck off. Zich\u2019s vision became dark. But before he completely lost consciousness, he thought he saw something shining.\u201cWhat! This\u2026is\u2026not pos\u2026finally. Here\u2026this time\u2026perfect\u2026!\u201dGlen was murmuring some things in terror, but Zich\u2019s consciousness faded into darkness.* * *Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!\u201cWhat\u2026\u201dIt was noisy outside. Zich scowled and turned around.\u201cAh, damn it! I can\u2019t sleep with this noise\u2026!\u201dAfter murmuring in annoyance, he stopped.He quickly got up. While surveying his surroundings with a stupid look on his face, the fearsome \u2018Demon Lord of Strength\u2019 was nowhere to be found. He actually looked like a blockhead.He began to touch his body all over. The wound that had been severe enough to cut him into two was entirely gone. There was not even a scratch; his skin that was rough from battle now felt soft and smooth.Then he touched his neck. It had been completely severed; no one could\u2019ve reversed it unless they were a god. But unbelievably, his head was still attached to his body.\u2018What in the world!\u2019Although he had experienced the world to its fullest and went through all kinds of experiences to the point that he earned the title of the Demon Lord; he had never gone through anything like this. He wondered for a moment if his stats disappeared and tried to calm himself to figure out the situation for now.\u2018At least I am alive.\u2019He couldn\u2019t believe it yet, but that was the important part. The future that had been closed off for him had opened again. Although he had reluctantly accepted his death, it didn\u2019t mean that he wouldn\u2019t be happy to be alive again. Zich felt better after he rechecked himself.Flap!He took off the thing covering him.\u2018It\u2019s a blanket.\u2019It was a soft, throw blanket of high quality.Then, he looked around his surroundings. He was lying on top of a bed in some kind of room. There were many luxurious and high-quality furniture in the wide room. It didn\u2019t seem like a typical family room.\u2018It somehow feels pretty familiar.\u2019Zich got off his bed and began to explore the room. He passed by a mirror that was hanging on a wall.\u201cHuh?\u201dZich marched towards the mirror.\u2018This!\u2019It was definitely Zich\u2019s face, but also not at the same time. He rubbed his cheeks and scratched a pimple that had claimed a visible spot on his face.\u201cI became younger?\u201dAs Zich screamed, the face in the mirror, which copied the shape of his mouth, was that of his younger self.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Toned muscles outlined and shaped his entire form, but they weren\u2019t even close to the muscles he had gained as the Demon Lord \u2014 during those days, he had pushed his body to its utmost limits. Even the huge scar on his back that was as big as the world map was gone.Zich sat on the bed and organized his thoughts.\u2018I\u2019m sure that after I fought that jerk, Glen Zenard, I also lost to his companions and was on the verge of death.\u2019No, it was funny to even say that he had been on the \u2018verge of death.\u2019 His body had been split into two while his neck was sliced off, so it was more accurate to say that he had died.\u2018But I am alive and well.\u2019Moreover, as if he had actually gone back in time, he was younger too.\u2018It\u2019s not a dream.\u2019He had checked multiple times already. His cheeks still stung from slapping himself so many times. Zich tried to recall what happened right before his death.\u2018After losing to Glen and his companions, I had to listen to that jerk\u2019s rambling. Then\u2026\u2019As if he had realized something, his eyes shone.\u2018I pierced that guy, Glen, with the \u2018Key that Distorts Destiny.\u2019 Is it because of that?\u2019He thought that it was a magical tool that only changed the future of the person it pierced, but looking at his situation right now, it was the only thing he could think of.\u2018Where did I get that?\u2019Zich\u2019s expression hardened.\u2018I don\u2019t remember.\u2019It wasn\u2019t only the location. He didn\u2019t remember the time or place he found the item, nor did he remember when he had placed the object into his index finger. There wasn\u2019t any information about the \u2018Key that Distorts Destiny\u2019 in his brain. He was only aware that the magical tool was stuck in his finger before he realized it.\u2018No, let\u2019s calm down, Zich Moore. Maybe I just forgot.\u2019Zich forgot small details easily. Maybe that was why he couldn\u2019t recall anything about the item.\u2018But what if someone altered my memories?\u2019Zich stared at his index finger which used to hold the \u2018Key that Distorts Destiny.\u2019\u2018For now, I should find out more about this key.\u2019He had a goal now.And with this decision, his seriousness completely disappeared.\u2018Hm, what should I do from now on? I can\u2019t live the rest of my life searching for information about a magical tool.\u2019Zich didn\u2019t want to put all of his efforts into finding traces of an item without any clues. He needed another goal. He liked the idea of following a bloody path as the Demon Lord like before, but he also liked the idea of living a completely different life. After all, wasn\u2019t this an unexpected second chance at life?\u2018It will be my loss if I don\u2019t enjoy this.\u2019Zich thought hard. He felt that he needed to figure out what period he was in first.\u2018Let me see. If I think about my surroundings, it seems like I haven\u2019t left my family yet.\u2019In contrast to his wild nature, Zich was surprisingly from an aristocratic family, and a pretty noble one at that. Moore was the last name that he had given to himself, and his original family name was Steelwall. Matching their name, the Steelwall family had protected the kingdom like an impregnable fortress for a long time.\u2018Since I am the eldest son, maybe it wouldn\u2019t be too bad to inherit the family\u2019s name.\u2019In the past, he left his family to wander around the world. Furthermore, he only pursued power to the extent that he gained the title: \u2018Demon Lord of Strength,\u2019 but this time, Zich thought it wouldn\u2019t be so bad to succeed as the next heir of his family and act like a noble.\u2018What was my reason for leaving?\u2019It was at that moment.Crick!The door opened without a knock. Disturbed from his thoughts, Zich scowled and stared at the person who came in.\u2018Can they just barge into the room of the eldest son of a noble family like this?\u2019Although Zich had abandoned all noble manners and etiquette since he left his family, he knew at least this much.\u2018Is it my parent or sibling?\u2019He was surprised to see that the man who had barged into his room looked like a servant.\u2018He must be a servant, right?\u2019Zich thought he might have been mistaken, but the man was definitely wearing servant clothing. The servant stared at Zich. Surprisingly, the servant scowled at him, and Zich became speechless.A servant had scowled while looking at a noble.\u201cYou were still in your room, sir?\u201d\u2018Thankfully, he still uses honorifics.\u2019Because he was so rude, Zich thought that the servant would also speak to him informally. Zich also wondered if he should be thankful for something like this.\u201cYou are usually out early in the morning. Have you given up on that now too? I don\u2019t think you are in the position to be lazy.\u201d\u2018\u2026Is he mocking me? There can\u2019t be any hidden meanings behind his words, right?\u2019The situation was so ridiculous that Zich started thinking about all kinds of things.\u201cHa!\u201dZich let out a forced laugh, and he beckoned the servant to come forward with his finger. The servant\u2019s expression worsened, but Zich continued to gesture while smiling. Thus, the servant unwittingly walked to his side.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dThe servant acted like he had walked up to Zich out of pity even though he didn\u2019t have to, but Zich\u2019s smile grew wider.Then, he got out of bed with much care.It was as if a mountain was rising \u2014 that was how enormous his physique was. Zich was a head and a half taller than the servant, and even though a normal servant would\u2019ve been intimidated by the difference in their physiques, the servant continued to glare at Zich.Zich didn\u2019t say anything for a while and looked down at the servant.\u201cYou called me. Why aren\u2019t you saying anything\u2026?\u201dThe servant was complaining when\u2014Punch!Zich\u2019s fist flew out. The moment it contacted the servant\u2019s cheek, a loud sound rang out.\u201cUgh!\u201dClatter!Like a paper doll flying in the wind, the servant\u2019s body flew out and collided against a small, luxurious-looking shelf. He made a loud cry as the shelf fell, and the servant toppled over like a garbage bag.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dThe servant squirmed on the ground in pain. Along with a few perfectly white teeth, blood dripped out his mouth, and his cheeks instantly swelled up.\u201cWaw-Wawth are yaw\u2026.!\u201dWith tears flowing out of his eyes, the servant glared at Zich and struggled to speak. It seemed like he was trying to say, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 but because his pronunciation was off, it was hard to tell.Zich approached the fallen servant. With this movement, the servant, who had been glaring at Zich with a childish rage, backed off for a moment. The smile on Zich\u2019s face was gone. It was replaced by a murderous intent that was colder than the Northern winter winds.Zich raised his foot.\u2018Maw-Mawdam wan\u2019t aproof\u2026!\u201dCrunch!\u201cUrggggggh!\u201dZich began to step on the servant relentlessly. The servant seemed like he was trying to say something along the lines of, \u2018Madam won\u2019t approve!\u2019 but this didn\u2019t matter to Zich. He continued to step on the servant without mercy.The servant, who had been busy shouting as if he had someone strong backing him, was now filled with terror before Zich, who was like an expressionless machine with the sole purpose of stepping on the servant. Even the thought, \u2018He won\u2019t really kill me, right?\u2019 had changed into \u2018He will really kill me at this rate!\u2019\u201cS-Sowry\u2026!\u201dWith swollen lips, the servant begged for forgiveness.Drop!Zich stopped his kicking.As if he saw a rope fall down from the sky while the world was ending, the servant hurriedly bowed to the ground. He was so low to the ground that it seemed like he was stuck to the floor.\u201cS-Sowry! I was w-wrang!\u201dHe urgently begged for forgiveness as tears and snot ran down his face. Zich let down the raised foot.\u201cHave you figured out your place?\u201dThe servant nodded senselessly, and Zich laughed in satisfaction.\u2018Since today is a good day and I got younger, I should stop here.\u2019Zich thought he should forgive the servant at this point but\u2014Slam!\u201cWhat happened?!\u201dThe person who slammed the door open completely changed Zich\u2019s mind.Zich saw a man with a uniform and a sword hanging at his waist.\u2018A knight.\u2019The man seemed like he would at least be a bodyguard for the family. Since he looked quite young, Zich predicted the man must have been called a genius a couple of times in his life.\u2018Did he come because of the screaming?\u2019The knight darted his eyes back and forth from Zich to the servant and frowned.\u201cKniwght B-Bwyner!\u201dAs if Byner was his savior, the servant crawled towards him.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dByner asked the servant attached to his leg.\u201cT-thawt guy\u2026!\u201d\u2018That guy?\u2019Zich\u2019s eyebrows twitched. The servant was begging for mercy like a bug just a moment ago, but now that he had somebody to lean on, he was cocky again. Zich made his way towards the servant once more.\u201cEccck!\u201dThe servant hurriedly hid behind the knight.Chuck!Byner\u2019s hands blocked Zich from moving forward.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u2018What? The way this bastard talks\u2026\u2019He was definitely the family\u2019s knight, but he showed no respect for the family\u2019s eldest son. Instead, he even showed a slight contempt for Zich.\u201cMove.\u201d\u201cI asked what you are doing.\u201d\u201cAre you asking me what I am doing? Didn\u2019t you hear that bastard say \u2018that guy\u2019 to me? Isn\u2019t the way he talks too cheeky for a lowly servant addressing the family\u2019s eldest son?\u201d Zich\u2019s reason was clear. A bad-tempered noble would have cut off the servant\u2019s tongue already.Byner should have known this as well, but he still didn\u2019t move from his spot.\u201cI will take care of this.\u201d\u201cNo need. I will educate him personally.\u201d\u201cI said, I will take care of it.\u201dZich stared at the knight and saw the servant rise behind him. Even while he was in pain, the servant was smiling. It was as if he was taunting Zich, \u2018What are you going to do now?\u2019\u201cI thought of this before, but you are cheeky as well.\u201dByner smirked and said, \u201cWhat are you going to do about that? Are you going to beat me up too?\u201d\u201cNothing is stopping me. A bastard who fails to recognize his own master will submit if you beat him enough times.\u201dByner looked at Zich with scorn and thought, \u2018Since he seemed like he knew his place and stayed quiet, I was lenient on him. Did he decide to just do whatever he wants now? And where did he learn to talk so vulgarly? He really isn\u2019t fit to be the next heir.\u2019\u201cThen, go ahead.\u201d Byner stepped forward as if he was encouraging Zich to take the first punch.Whish!Zich flung out his fist.Byner flinched. He didn\u2019t think that Zich would actually hit him. But he had also not become a knight by pure luck. Byner bent his back and avoided Zich\u2019s punch.\u2018That was pretty good.\u2019Byner knew that Zich regularly kept his body in shape, but even with that, Zich\u2019s punches were too fierce.\u2018But it\u2019s not enough.\u2019Zich wasn\u2019t strong enough to beat a knight like him yet.\u2018I should use this chance to put him in his place.\u2019When Zich put his fist out, Byner used that chance to aim for Zich\u2019s stomach, but Zich twisted his feet and escaped Byner\u2019s attack.Bam!After rolling in a circle, Zich lifted his body up next to the bed.The distance between them widened, but Byner had no intention to end this scuffle easily. He swung his fist at Zich, who had now been trying to get up. Byner planned to end this fight with a light smack on Zich\u2019s face.Flap!Byner\u2019s view became covered in white. \u2018What!\u2019It was a blanket. With his hands, Byner swiftly flicked the blanket that was about to cover him, but by the time his view was clear, there was nobody in front of him.\u201cSir Byner, behind\u2026!\u201dWith the servant\u2019s urgent voice, Byner quickly turned his back.Crash!\u201cUgh!\u201dByner felt a great shock on the back of his head.Thud!Byner fell to the floor. Beautiful flowers, water, and vase shards scattered around his bleeding head.\u201cSkills aren\u2019t everything, you bastard.\u201dAfter planting a vase on top of Byner\u2019s head, Zich spouted insults at him.The younger the opponent was, the weaker they were to irregular attacks.\u2018Dickhead. Did you think I was crazy enough to fight you fair and square?\u2019Even if he had been once called the \u2018Demon Lord of Strength,\u2019 in his current situation, there was no way he could fight a knight head on. He wasn\u2019t even used to his current body yet. But still, the memories and experiences he had gained as the \u2018Demon Lord of Strength\u2019 were still inside of him. After overcoming countless battles and experiences, it was easy for Zich to knock down a young knight who hadn\u2019t even pulled out his sword yet.\u2018Since he is unconscious, I should step on him later.\u2019Zich shifted his attention back to the servant. The servant\u2019s swollen face was full of fear.\u201cWeren\u2019t you happy when your guardian angel showed up? But what are you going to do now that he looks like that?\u201d\u201cH-Have mewrcy\u2026!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t kill you.\u201dZich raised his feet again. Then, suddenly, he remembered what Glen Zenard had said to him.[If you are born again, I pray that you will be someone who does good!]\u2018Ok, I will do that starting from tomorrow.\u2019And for a long while after that, a servant\u2019s screams filled up Zich\u2019s entire room until another knight finally came running into the room after hearing the commotion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZich walked on a thickly carpeted hallway.As expected of a noble family, there were luxurious decorations on both sides of the wall. However, they didn\u2019t quite match the status of a Count. It looked as if the owner had kept the number of decorations to a minimum to match their status, and all of these things hinted at the character of the castle\u2019s master.However, Zich didn\u2019t care for the decorations around him and was lost deep in thought.\u2018Is it my father?\u2019His father was someone whom he had forgotten after leaving the family.\u2018He probably wants to talk to me about how I beat up that servant and knight.\u2019Considering the order of events, Zich was not at fault. He did injure them a bit more than necessary, but if his family considered the way the servant and knight had disrespected him, Zich was not at fault. This was especially true for the servant; he deserved to have his neck cut off.\u2018That would have been the normal thing to do.\u2019Unfortunately, his family would not show the bare minimum of what was \u2018normal\u2019 to him. In the past, this was the reason why Zich left his family.Halt!Zich stopped before a door with an engraving of a wolf\u2019s fierce-looking face. Next to the door, soldiers stood by with their swords.Zich tilted his head at them.Thud! Thud! Thud!One of the soldiers knocked on the door.\u201cMy Lord, Sir Zich has arrived.\u201d\u201cLet him come in.\u201dA low and grave voice seeped out through the door.\u201cPlease go inside, sir.\u201dThe soldier went back to his original spot, and Zich stared at the door for a moment.\u2018I remember I used to have a hard time going through this door.\u2019Zich couldn\u2019t remember his past well. He was basically a different person now, and he didn\u2019t have even the slightest bit of fear as he pushed the door open.The first figure Zich saw was an old man with a wire-like silver beard, sitting on a big chair. The man\u2019s large eyes and stubborn-looking lips stood out to him, and Zich knew that this man was his father and the castle\u2019s master, Count Steelwall.The Count wasn\u2019t the only person in the room. Knight Byner and the servant were also standing beside the Count, and they were completely healed and fine, as if they had been healed with an expensive potion or treated by a rare healer.\u2018And\u2026\u2019There were other people.\u2018It\u2019s my mother and younger brother.\u2019Even with the faint lines around her eyes and mouth, his mother, Florelle Steelwall, was a beauty; and holding his mother\u2019s arms was his younger brother, Greig Steelwall, with his reddish-brown hair and smooth face. It was because of them that even a servant treated Zich poorly.\u2018But I can\u2019t only blame them\u2014\u2019Zich focused his gaze on the Count again.\u2018Since all of this wouldn\u2019t have happened without his approval.\u2019The master dictated how his family operated, meaning that Zich\u2019s poor treatment was what his father also wanted.The Count\u2019s piercing eyes stared at Zich. If it had been the original Zich, he would have lowered his gaze and given a polite greeting. But Zich was different now. He stood up straight and continued to meet the Count\u2019s eyes.Twitch!The Count\u2019s eyebrows moved.\u201c\u2026Did you even forget how to say a basic greeting?\u201dThe Count\u2019s voice was quiet but filled with rage. If it were Zich as the \u2018Demon Lord of Strength,\u2019 he would\u2019ve laughed at the Count\u2019s rage and smashed the Count\u2019s head on the desk, but surprisingly, Zich bowed his head\u2014however, even that was just a slight tilt.The Count moved his eyebrows even further.\u2018He must be annoyed.\u2019Zich stopped moving. He thought about messing up everything like he would have done as the Demon Lord, but he decided against it. It was impossible to do that with the body he had right now. For hundreds of years, the Steelwalls were a distinguished family that protected the kingdom from foreign attacks. Their force was one of the greatest in the kingdom.Besides, Zich still needed to decide how to live his new life. He didn\u2019t want to screw things up from the beginning. Of course, Zich\u2019s standards for \u2018screwing up\u2019 differed from the norm, but still.\u201cLook at him, my lord. This child hasn\u2019t changed his ways. Haven\u2019t I told you? He won\u2019t even show basic etiquette anymore. This child has always disrespected his mother and brother, and he is now disrespecting his own father! How far will his audacity go?!\u201d\u2018Wow. Look at her go.\u2019Watching his mother\u2014no, his stepmother drip crocodile tears, Zich laughed inside his head.Greig added in his comments, \u201cFather and Mother. Brother must be a bit tired. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t truly have any ill intentions.\u201d\u2018Like peas in a pod.\u2019Zich felt like bursting into laughter at his brother\u2019s pretentious reply. Zich\u2019s family was complicated, but could be explained simply in some ways. The current Countess had entered the family after his mother\u2019s death, and his half-brother was born afterwards. In short, the Countess wished for her own son to become the next heir instead of the eldest son.\u2018Even a cheap, third-rate novel wouldn\u2019t be this clich\u00e9.\u2019But this was reality for Zich.\u201cWhat do you have to say to that?\u201dThe Count\u2019s voice became rougher, possibly as a result of Greig\u2019s words. However, Zich had no intention of calming his father\u2019s rage.\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201dZich didn\u2019t even attempt to hide his rebellious tone. Everyone, including the Count, was surprised. They always thought that Zich Steelwall was a timid person who was especially obedient to the Count, but that had actually been Zich\u2019s way of crying for attention and help from his father in his abandoned state.\u2018But that doesn\u2019t matter to me anymore.\u2019Bang!The Count slammed the table with his fist. Everyone in the room flinched at the Count\u2019s rage, but Zich remained calm.\u201cYour manners were the only thing satisfactory about you, but now you are throwing away your one saving grace?! How are you going to inherit the family\u2019s name with that kind of rotten mindset!\u201d\u201cAre you even planning on making me the heir?\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201dThe Count became speechless after hearing Zich\u2019s unexpected response. Bystanders stared at the exchange in shock.\u201cOf course! You are the oldest after all! It is only natural for me to appoint you as the heir, but of course, as long as you have no flaws!\u201dZich could feel discontentment in the Count\u2019s voice, even though the Count sounded like he was siding with Zich. He even added the part about no flaws.\u2018And he will choose what kind of flaw that is.\u2019With exaggerated movements, Zich bent his back.\u201cTo think that our respectful father was so fair in his thoughts. Hearing this, your lacking son feels like he is flying in the heavens.\u201dExtreme praise was equivalent to sarcasm, and the Count\u2019s face reddened. But it wasn\u2019t the Count who reacted first.\u201cHow can you show such impudence toward your father! Apologize to him immediately!\u201dThe Countess shrieked.\u201cHow did I act rudely to my father, whom I admire with all my heart? There must have been a misunderstanding.\u201dTo top it off, Zich added another word.\u201cMother.\u201dThe Countess, who was about to continue, shut her mouth. With wide eyes, she moved her eyes from side to side.\u201cMother? Is that what you just said?\u201d\u201cYes, Father. I always used the term \u2018Countess,\u2019 but doesn\u2019t that sound too distant? Don\u2019t you also think so, Mother?\u201dThe Countess\u2019s expression completely fell. It looked as if there was a disgusting bug in front of her, but Zich continued, \u201cMother, you look pale. Mother, are you hurting anywhere? Mother, should I call the physician?\u201dThe Countess flinched every time Zich called her \u2018Mother.\u2019 As if she was eating a bitter fruit, her cheeks kept twitching, but Zich found amusement in this and continued to include Mother in every line. The Countess knew that it was on purpose, but she couldn\u2019t say anything. After all, he was also supposed to be her son; there was no way she could stop him from calling her Mother.\u201cI-I am fine. I am not hurting anywhere.\u201d\u201cDear Mother, I\u2019m relieved that you are fine. But Mother, just in case, please get an examination by a physician. I don\u2019t think I will be at peace until then, Mother.\u201dCough!As if something was stuck in her throat, the Countess began to look pale. Then, the Count made a fake cough and ended Zich\u2019s teasing.\u201c\u2026Do you know why I called you here today?\u201dThe Count scanned Zich\u2019s expression. Zich seemed different from his usual self.\u201cIt probably has something to do with those two, right?\u201dZich pointed at the servant and the knight.\u201cYes. About what you did to\u2014!\u201d\u201cI sincerely apologize, Father.\u201dZich bowed his head. His polite apology completely contrasted his rebellious attitude from a moment ago. The Count was left speechless at Zich\u2019s sudden change in attitude\u2014what Zich did afterward surprised him even more.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for bothering you because I didn\u2019t clean up my mess properly. From now on, I will take care of matters like this more properly.\u201dZich began to move, and everyone stared at him. He was heading towards the corner of the room where a decorative sword was hanging with an X marked on top of it.Swing!As expected of a military family, even the edge of a decorative sword was sharp. Zich turned around while holding the sword.Clang! Clang!Byner and Greig positioned themselves in front of the Count and the Countess with their swords raised.\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201dAs he screamed, the Count\u2019s face was as red as a tomato.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? I\u2019m going to clean up my mess.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, mess?!\u201dAfter tilting his sword toward the ground, Zich pointed at the servant with his free hand.\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? I have to slice off the neck of a servant who dares to insult a noble.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201dThe Count\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, but Zich confidently tilted his head.\u201cHuh? Isn\u2019t that why you called me? I thought you called me to finish off the guys who dared to insult the great Steelwall\u2019s\u2014Legitimate. Blood. Heir.\u201dZich included Byner, who was now looking at him in disbelief.\u201cI already dealt with them personally, so I didn\u2019t want to make this situation any bigger, but I guess it can\u2019t be helped if you are not satisfied. Now that I think about it, my punishment was way too light. I mean, aren\u2019t they the ones who dared to insult the great Steelwall\u2019s Legitimate. Blood. Heir? Father, please don\u2019t worry. I will neatly slice their heads off and hang them in front of the castle walls. \u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZich walked towards the servant, step by step.There was no hesitation in his movements, and each of his footsteps carried murderous intent. Only then did everyone realize that Zich\u2019s words and actions were not meant to be rebellious or metaphorical\u2014he literally meant to kill the servant.\u201cMa-Madam!\u201dAt the servant\u2019s plea, the Countess broke out from her trance.\u201cS-Stop! Didn\u2019t I tell you to stop! How dare you draw blood in front of your parents! Where did you learn to behave so rudely!\u201d\u201cDear Mother, how could I dare to draw blood in front of my parents? Mother, I was going to drag the servant to a suitable place and finish him off. Mother, even though my heart is broken, how can I let an insult towards me, the\u2014Legitimate. Blood. Heir.\u2014of our great Steelwall family slide?\u201dZich replied slyly to the Countess\u2019s outcry.\u201cHow could Hans have insulted you?! This child would never do such a thing!\u201d\u2018Ah, no wonder the servant acted so cockily. He was one of the Countess\u2019s people.\u2019There was a high possibility that Hans was the child or some relative of one of the servants that the Countess had initially brought with her.\u201cY-yes! How could I dare to insult a noble family!\u201dHans began to grovel on the floor. Sweat trickled down his back\u2014nothing was going according to plan.He just wanted to get back at Zich for hurting him and simultaneously harm Zich\u2019s reputation to further support Greig\u2019s succession as heir. If things were like normal, Zich would have been busy making excuses with his head hung low; and no matter how many excuses he gave, the Count would have used the knight and Hans\u2019s words as evidence against Zich to scold him.However, the situation had completely flipped because of Zich\u2019s brazen-faced attitude.Hans couldn\u2019t believe that Zich dared to wield a sword in front of the Count, and as a consequence, the situation was now leaning in Zich\u2019s favor.Like Zich said, what Hans did really deserved a death sentence. Due to Zich\u2019s shy nature and his weak position in the family, Hans had gotten away with his behaviors so far, but what if Zich really intended to kill him now? And what if the Countess failed to defend him because the situation was now leaning towards Zich\u2019s favor?\u2018If I speak wrongly, I really might die!\u2019Hans finally began to realize the gravity of the situation.\u201cI can confidently say that I have never said a rude word or acted impudently to the young master!\u201d\u201cThen, are you saying that I\u2019m lying?\u201d\u201cT-that\u2026!\u201dHans wanted to shout, \u2018Of course!\u2019, but Zich\u2019s cold gaze made him speechless. And it was at this moment that another voice came out from a distance and replied for Hans.\u201cYes, that\u2019s true! The young master is lying!\u201dThe voice sounded desperate. People turned around to see the speaker, and Hans looked back as if a savior had come to save him from hell.\u2018It\u2019s that, what\u2019s his name\u2014Knight Byner.\u2019The speaker was Byner, whom Zich had also beaten up.When Zich had entered the room, Byner glared at him with intense fury, but now that the situation was leaning towards Zich\u2019s side, his glare was losing its fierceness.Zich looked at Byner with delight.\u2018Aren\u2019t you two getting desperate? You probably want to teach me a lesson for using crude tricks against you, but things are not going according to plan, eh?\u2019As of right now, Hans\u2019s actions were the main focus of interest, but according to Zich\u2019s words, Byner was also culpable for insulting a noble.Since knights were considered mid-nobility, his neck wouldn\u2019t be cut off like a servant. However, Byner had tried to harm Zich directly. Of course, Byner didn\u2019t intend to cause serious damage to Zich, and his actions were within the limits that the Count and Countess could easily cover up.No, if Zich were like his usual self, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to even protest in front of the Count. But contrary to Byner\u2019s expectations, the situation had turned strange, and now, the servant that Zich hit was groveling and shivering on the floor. What if the servant was condemned for his crimes? And what if this led to a sentence for Byner?\u2018Even I might not be able to escape punishment.\u2019Insecurity began to grow and flourish in Byner\u2019s heart. It might have been because he was still an inexperienced, young knight.\u201cIs that true, Sir Byner?\u201dWith an expectant face, the Countess urged Byner on. A knight\u2019s words carried much more weight than a servant\u2019s words.\u201cYes, my lady! As Hans and I have stated, Zich one-sidedly assaulted us.\u201d\u201cFunny to hear that a knight was one-sidedly assaulted. Have the standards of Steelwall\u2019s knights gone downhill?\u201dWith Zich\u2019s mockery, Byner\u2019s face puffed up as if it was going to explode. Even the Count grumbled at Zich\u2019s words with an annoyed look.\u201cT-that was because you unfairly\u2026\u201d\u201cHahahahah! Unfairly\u2014and this is from a Steelwall knight! Are you going to bring up fairness on a battlefield? I can\u2019t believe that a Steelwall knight is making the same excuses as the weaklings from the capital!\u201dZich made an exaggerated laugh so that everyone could hear him. Byner\u2019s face began to puff up even more. When Zich compared him to the knights from the capital, Byner was so embarrassed that his whole body started shaking.The knights from Steelwall were prideful about their experiences compared to the knights from the capital who had no actual battle experience. Using this knowledge, Zich was directly attacking Byner\u2019s pride as a Steelwall knight.\u201cNo matter what you say, the truth does not change that you one-sidedly assaulted us!\u201dByner was now vehemently spitting out his words.\u201cWhat do you have to say to that?\u201d\u201cFather, isn\u2019t it obvious that he is lying? He is afraid of punishment, so he is shamelessly making excuses.\u201d\u201cNo, this is not true! It is the young master who is lying!\u201dTwo opposite sides were fiercely arguing against each other. Even though Byner\u2019s words were filled with embarrassment and shame, his lies did carry some weight as a knight.\u201cFather, don\u2019t you also think that Sir Byner\u2019s words are more reliable? Since he is a knight, I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t dare lie in front of you.\u201dGreig, who had been silent so far, suddenly intervened.\u2018Yeah, it would be weird for you not to join in.\u2019Whenever Zich was in a dilemma, Greig was the main leader who made Zich\u2019s situation even worse. This was the image Zich remembered about his brother.\u201cY-Yes, that is right!\u201dWith Greig\u2019s support, Byner\u2019s expression became brighter. From across a distance, Zich and Greig\u2019s eyes met. Greig smiled. His smile was impudent and sly, but to Zich, who had regressed, Greig\u2019s provocation now only seemed childish and ridiculous.Zich returned his smile with complete confidence, and Greig\u2019s expression froze in shock. Whenever Greig made life difficult for him, Zich used to always make an embarrassed face and hang his head low.But that was in the past. Zich no longer placed any importance on Greig.\u2018Well, this is how it has been.\u2019No one was ever on his side in the first place. People were just momentarily shaken up by Zich\u2019s sudden change.Realizing that the atmosphere was slowly changing against his favor again, Zich decided to end the matter.\u2018For starters, I wasn\u2019t really planning to cut off the servant\u2019s neck or bring down a knight.\u2019Of course, not for now.Zich began to move towards Byner. The mood immediately became tense and stiff as both Zich and Byner had their swords drawn. A sword fight could break out at any moment.\u201cWhat are you planning to do!\u201dAs expected, the Count shouted to stop Zich. However, Zich stood in front of Byner as if he couldn\u2019t hear the Count. With sharp but puzzled eyes, Byner followed Zich with his eyes and readied his sword.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cW-what?\u201dSeeing that Zich showed no signs of raising his sword, Byner replied with a relieved heart, \u201cYou\u2019re not planning to admit your wrongs, right?\u201d\u201cI swear I have not spoken a lie!\u201d\u201cYes, of course. A shitty knight who sold his honor won\u2019t tell the truth anyway.\u201dOnce again, Byner\u2019s face began to redden.\u2018Seeing his reaction, he must not be that trashy.\u2019If it were Zich, he wouldn\u2019t have shown such an obvious reaction from a soft lie like this.\u2018What an innocent punk.\u2019His innocence was kind of cute. However, it didn\u2019t excuse him for his crimes.\u2018It also doesn\u2019t change the fact that he tried to screw me over.\u2019Zich, who had an awful personality, could never forgive those who tried to screw him over.\u201cLet\u2019s stop arguing about who\u2019s right with just words. Isn\u2019t there a better way for us to settle this matter?\u201dZich raised his sword and softly tapped on Byner\u2019s sword.\u201c\u2026Are you saying that we should settle this conflict with a duel?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201dByner was the youngest among the knights. Despite his limited experience, this also meant that he was a genius to be appointed knighthood at such a young age. Even if Zich doubted everything else, Byner was definitely a skilled fighter. Moreover, due to the Countess\u2019s underhanded ploys, Zich never had the opportunity to properly learn sword fighting.Despite all of this, Zich dared to challenge a knight to a duel.\u201cHow can you say I\u2019m out of my mind? Didn\u2019t you recently get knocked out by a hit to the back of your neck? How can you be so confident to spout such nonsense?\u201dByner\u2019s expression turned sour. His comrades humiliated and mocked him because of that incident.\u201cAlright! Let\u2019s duel!\u201dZich shrugged and looked back towards the Count.\u201cFather, as you can see, we have reached an agreement. Please find a suitable time and place for us to duel.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cMan, why do you and this punk look down on me so much? I only suggested this duel because I thought I could win. I slammed the back of this wimp\u2019s head so hard that he fainted.\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright. Then let\u2019s proceed with the duel.\u201dThe Count did not try to stop them.\u2018Zich is underestimating Byner too much.\u2019Even the Count heard about how Zich was able to beat up Byner with his carelessness.It was a lowly way to fight, but the Count nodded in approval while listening to the fight\u2019s details. As the Steelwall Count, he was known as the metal fortress that protected the Kingdom, and as the leader of his clan and a fighter who had spent all his life fending off intruders from getting into the Kingdom, there were no such things as cowardly or dirty fights. For that reason alone, the Count readily accepted Zich\u2019s victory over Byner.\u2018But that\u2019s all there is to it.\u2019Zich couldn\u2019t win against a knight in a fair fight. The Count thought Zich fell victim to his own arrogance.\u2018I guess it will be a good lesson for him.\u2019The Count had always disliked Zich. He didn\u2019t feel bad about the humiliation Zich would probably have to go through if he lost the duel. Moreover, with Zich\u2019s defeat, it would be easier for Greig to gain legitimacy over Zich as the next heir.\u2018Zich\u2019s reputation will be ruined if it gets out that he tried to cover up his misdeeds by challenging a knight in a duel that he had no chance in and losing.\u2019The Count initially planned to severely scold Zich for hitting Byner and the servant, but he thought this was not a bad outcome as well. If Zich lost, Byner\u2019s statements would be true, and the Count could always punish Zich later.\u201cI will find a suitable time and place.\u201d\u201cThen I will leave it in your hands.\u201dZich placed the sword back in its original location. There was not a trace of meekness or humility in his movements, and people\u2019s gazes naturally followed him wherever he went.\u201c\u2026You have changed,\u201d the Count softly muttered. Zich, who was heading towards the exit, turned his head back.\u201cIt\u2019s because I realized that there was nothing for me to gain by staying the way I am. There\u2019s no reason for me to waste my energy in pleasing others and making a fool of myself.\u201dThinking back to their previous conversation, the Count asked with sharp discomfort, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for you to gain? Are you talking about your succession as the heir?\u201dZich let out a sly smile.\u201cEven you, who is called the warlord of steel, is blinded by prejudice, and you are unable to make a clear judgment regarding your familial affairs.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDear Father, nothing that I say will reach you right now. I hope that you will keep thinking however you want.\u201dAnd with an exaggerated bow, Zich made his exit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA day had passed by since Zich caused an uproar by challenging a knight. At the crack of dawn, Zich headed towards the back garden where there wasn\u2019t a single person in sight.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dZich took in a deep breath and gripped his sword. The fresh morning air filled up his lungs.Grip.He tightly held onto his sword. He heaved a few breaths in and out and warmed up for a bit.Slash!The sharp sword cut the air in front of him, and the morning dew shivered in surprise at his quick movements.Swish!He moved his foot with natural ease, and the unfettered dirt let out a stream of dust.Thud!Then, he placed some weight on his moving feet and spun himself. The force from the spin was transferred onto his shoulders, arms, and to the very tip of his sword.Slashhh!His movements were beautiful yet menacing. The sunlight seeped in through the tree leaves and shattered on the sword in a multitude of lights.Swish! Swish! Swishh!Zich used a different type of sword movement. Before, his movement was sharp as glass, but now, it was heavy as a bludgeon. His sword style kept changing. It became slow and then fast, sharp and then soft.Zich gradually lost track of time.\u201cPuff!\u201dHe stopped moving his sword around and calmed his breathing. His whole body was covered in sweat.\u2018My condition is better than I thought.\u2019He clenched his fist and opened it. His hands were rough but pale, representative of a nineteen-year-old body.At nineteen years old, Zich hadn\u2019t learned sword fighting, but he had completed the basics to hone his body. Of course, it was incomparable to the days when he was called the \u2018Demon Lord of Strength.\u2019. Considering his age, however, it was in good shape.\u2018It\u2019s actually better that I didn\u2019t learn any sword fighting.\u2019Zich\u2019s current body was like a raw, untouched stone. It was a body that had fundamental strength but no basic structure. If he poured in his experience and expertise from his days as the \u2018Demon Lord of Strength,\u2019 he would be able to progress at an exponential rate.\u2018I feel a bit bitter thinking about the reason why I received no basic training though.\u2019No matter how much the Count did not want to pass down his sword fighting techniques to Zich, his family was called the metal fortress. There should have always been a way for him to learn sword fighting.\u2018I was so desperate for my father\u2019s approval that I wasn\u2019t even willing to glance at sword fighting techniques other than the special ones passed down in this family.\u2019It was not that Zich was desperate to succeed as heir or learn sword fighting\u2014he merely wanted to gain his father\u2019s attention and approval.\u2018Reflecting back, I really was innocent.\u2019If people realized that the \u2018Demon Lord of Strength, Zich Moore\u2019 used to be a weak and vulnerable boy in his youth, they would all be paralyzed in shock.\u2018Well, I did suffer a lot after I left the family.\u2019Before Zich was able to earn the title of \u2018Demon Lord of Strength,\u2019 he went through a series of enormous suffering and trials. It was almost strange how these trials and problems kept happening one after another.\u2018It was to the extent where it felt planned.\u2019Zich laughed. It was pointless to think like this. When the Count had expelled him, he had no power, wealth, or background, and many people tried to take advantage of him.\u2018If I wasn\u2019t so talented, I would have died over a hundred times.\u2019He stopped thinking pointless thoughts and began practicing with his sword again.\u2018I like how my body is in shape, but it will be difficult to win this duel.\u2019His opponent was the genius knight Byner, who was only in his early twenties. There was no way Zich could catch up to him in physical strength by the time of the duel.Byner\u2019s skills were also superior at this point in time. Even though he had his knowledge of skills as \u2018Zich Moore,\u2019 his body was still untrained.\u2018I\u2019m gonna have to practice like mad to instill the skills into my body. That\u2019s the only possible way for me to use them like second nature.\u2019And as mentioned before, Zich\u2019s body was not trained to that extent.But most importantly\u2014\u201cWhoosh!\u201dZich took in a deep breath once again and relaxed his body. It was different from when he tried to relax right before spurting. Zich closed his eyes and tried to feel his internal body.The soft breeze tickled his foot, and the ground felt firm under his feet. He ignored these outside sensations and tried to deepen his focus. He felt the blood vessels beating and the blood flowing inside his body.Then, he went deeper inside. He began to feel something\u2014an enormous matter that was immobilized by various substances intertwining with each other. It carried such great strength that a major city would be decimated in a second if he let it all out.Zich began to slowly feel around this matter. As if it was indifferent to all outside stimulation, it didn\u2019t respond to Zich at all.Sweat began to trickle down Zich\u2019s forehead. He maintained extreme focus to make the matter react.Twitch!The matter finally gave a small response, and Zich\u2019s focus shattered at once.Thud!Zich\u2019s body shook from the shock, and he collapsed onto the ground. At first, his knees landed on the ground, and soon after, he landed on his butt.\u201cArgh, damn it! This bastard is still so tricky to control!\u201dZich placed his hand near his heart. The enormous and destructive matter that resided inside Zich was his mana.\u2018Even though I concentrated so much, only a fraction of it awoke.\u2019He felt dejected for a moment. Exhausted, he laid flat on the ground.\u2018It can\u2019t be helped. In regards to the amount of mana I have, I really am talented.\u2019Each person had a limit to the amount of mana they had. And Zich\u2019s amount of mana was incomparably large to the average person\u2019s.\u2018Well, an elf compared the amount of mana I had to a now-extinct dragon.\u2019One of the reasons why Zich became the Demon Lord of Strength was because of this dragon-like amount of mana. However, as of right now, Zich\u2019s current mana was the same as having no mana at all. There was no way he could control such a large amount of mana in his current state.\u2018It\u2019s almost too much mana.\u2019Zich gained complete control of his mana long after he left the family. For that reason, there were rumors that Zich, heir to Steelwall, had no mana at all. It was another obstacle that prevented him from succeeding as the Count of Steelwall.However, this was Zich\u2019s second chance at life. He obviously wouldn\u2019t be able to fully utilize his mana right now, but he could take the first steps to master it.As evidence of this statement, a sliver of mana floated on top of his hand.\u2018With this, my chances at victory have increased.\u2019But his chances were still lacking\u2014even with all his experience as the Demon Lord and his ability to control mana somewhat, it would be a challenging task to beat a knight.\u2018Our basic skills are on totally different levels right now.\u2019But all of this didn\u2019t matter to Zich. In the first place, Zich knew all of this information and still challenged a duel with the knight.\u2018There is nothing for me to lose either.\u2019Zich already decided that he was going to leave the Steelwall family anyways.\u2018I\u2019m glad I got another chance to start over, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want to succeed as heir. If I do, I\u2019m going to feel frustrated to death.\u2019Just thinking about how he had to get each and one of his brother\u2019s supporters on his side gave him a headache.\u2018I will be so frustrated that I may die young. It will be a miracle if I don\u2019t turn over the whole family before I actually succeed as the Count.\u2019There was a high possibility that it might turn out exactly like how Zich pictured it to be\u2014no, it was certain. Rather than go through all these frustrations, it would be much better for him to leave Steelwall.\u201cYou finally awakened your mana?\u201dA sudden voice interrupted Zich\u2019s thoughts.Zich grimaced in displeasure and did not even turn around as he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you? If you are spying on me, just go away and don\u2019t bother me.\u201d\u201cYou knew I was here?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of nonsense are you spitting out when you move so noisily? You sounded like a moving ogre.\u201dAnnoyed, Greig scowled in response to Zich\u2019s words.\u2018I tried somewhat to silence my movements.\u2019Greig didn\u2019t erase his whole presence like an assassin, but he also had been careful to stay still. The Zich he knew did not have such keen senses to notice an unmoving intruder.\u2018Also, his speech and actions are still weird.\u2019So far, the Count and Countess had not given much thought or reaction to Zich\u2019s sudden change in behavior; that was how much this couple was indifferent to their 'son.\u201dBut unlike them, Greig felt suspicious about Zich\u2019s change.Without saying anything, Greig stared at Zich.\u201cWhat? If you have something you need from me, quickly say it, and if you don\u2019t, fuck off.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you really think it is possible?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Can\u2019t you speak straight-forwardly?\u201d\u201cI mean about the duel with Sir Byner. And also the succession.\u201dGreig\u2019s speech began to become a bit rough. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you suddenly decided to change your behavior, but you know it\u2019s all fruitless, right? You should get what you can and leave. If you know your place, I might prepare a farewell present on your way out.\u201d\u2018Ha! This twit.\u2019Even though Zich had no desire to become a count, hearing Greig\u2019s taunting annoyed him.Zich quickly got up and walked towards Greig. Even as he moved, Greig did not move back a single inch.\u201cAre you afraid that I might succeed as the Count of Steelwall?\u201d\u201cWhy should I be afraid? If I can\u2019t even triumph over someone like you, I should just give up on becoming the heir.\u201dHis smile was mocking, as if he really thought there was no possible way Zich could succeed as the heir. But instead of getting angry at his mockery, Zich made a soft smile.\u201cReally? If my dear brother says so, that must be right. Are we not brothers after all?\u201dZich tapped Greig\u2019s shoulders a few times, and Greig\u2019s face completely distorted at this movement. Feeling pleased with Greig\u2019s change in expression, Zich spoke again, \u201cBut I still have my advantage as the firstborn. So why don\u2019t we do it like this?\u201d\u201cLike how?\u201d\u201cWe are a family of fighters. Unlike other families, we put significantly more importance on personal strength and one\u2019s ability to fight.\u201d\u201cWait, are you asking for a duel? A duel for the succession?\u201d\u201cOf course. What else can I possibly mean?\u201dGreig looked at Zich with suspicion.\u201cAre you seriously challenging me to a duel? And the matter with Sir Byner too\u2026are you really out of your mind?\u201d\u201cWhat, you afraid?\u201dGreig\u2019s eyebrows twitched. He bit his lips and glared at Zich.\u201c\u2026Alright. There\u2019s no reason for me to refuse.\u201d\u2018I knew you would say that.\u2019If his memory served right, Greig would have made significant progress in his fighting prowess around this time. There was no reason for Greig not to accept a duel against Zich who had not even learned the basics of sword fighting and just recently awakened his mana.\u201cHowever, even if I accept your duel, it can\u2019t be related to the succession. Our father won\u2019t allow it.\u201dEven though individual fighting prowess was indeed important, it was not the only necessary component for being the heir.Moreover, even if everyone in the family was united against expelling Zich, a single duel could not determine a significant matter like succession. As the firstborn, Zich had the advantage of traditional legitimacy.\u201cDuh, you idiot. But if we duel, father will spread a rumor that I challenged you to a duel with the succession on the line. Think about what will happen to me if I lose. Even though our duel would be informal in nature, I will no longer be able to openly declare my right to succession. Even though Father seems like the type of person to fix all of his problems by strength, he is a noble after all. It will be a piece of cake for him to accomplish a small scheme like this.\u201dGreig stroked his chin. There were a lot of things he could gain by accepting this duel.\u201cThen a major obstacle to my succession will largely disappear.\u201d\u201cYeah. But of course, all of this is in the case that you actually beat me. You have more things to lose than me. If I win, you will be losing to someone who hasn\u2019t even learned the basics of sword fighting and doesn\u2019t even know how to control mana properly. No matter how much Father backs you up as his heir, there will be great resistance among the people in Steelwall. Because even though we are nobles, we are a military family after all.\u201dGreig sneered, \u201cMe, losing to you?\u201d\u201cAre you that confident?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still wondering if you have become insane.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it better for you if I am insane? Even if I am the first son, you can\u2019t make a crazy person the heir.\u201d\u201cThat is also true. Alright, I\u2019m going to go talk to Father right now.\u201d\u201cWait a moment.\u201dZich stopped Greig who was about to leave.\u201cIf you are so confident, can you give me an advantage?\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you scheming?\u201dWith suspicious eyes, Greig stared at Zich.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so suspicious. I just want to decide when the duel will take place.\u201dGreig thought about Zich\u2019s words for a brief moment and then slowly nodded. No matter what devious tricks Zich had up his sleeves, such a request wouldn\u2019t impact his chances in winning.\u201cDeal. But, I also have a condition. I want to have the duel at least within the next half a year from now.\u201d\u201cDeal.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget\u2014half a year. You can\u2019t make any excuses like how you need to recover from Byner\u2019s duel or things like that.\u201dIn such a short amount of time, Greig had thought that far.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I also don\u2019t have any intentions to drag it out for that long.\u201dPleased by Zich\u2019s words, Greig turned around and left. Watching his younger brother walk away, Zich held his sword tightly once more.\u2018That little punk looks down on me so much. I\u2019m going to make sure to leave him a big present right before I leave.\u2019Swish!As if he was slashing towards Greig, Zich\u2019s sword sharply cut through the air. After a few days passed, the date of Zich\u2019s duel with Byner arrived.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe day of the duel was bright, and the Count\u2019s residence was swept away by a strange atmosphere. Many people were anticipating the fight between the eldest son, Zich, who had already lost his father\u2019s favor, and the genius knight, Byner. It was even more exciting because although it wasn\u2019t made official, they expected a duel for the succession between the young nobles, Zich and Greig.However, there wasn\u2019t a single person who wanted Zich to win. Inside the family, Zich was a complete outsider.\u2018They planned this through and through.\u2019The circular arena looked quite unsophisticated, but it was large enough to make up for its crudeness.As a family that placed great importance on military might, Steelwall was used to opening tournaments from time to time. The circular arena was a place for situations like that, and now it was the place where Zich and Byner would fight.\u2018To think that they prepared an arena for a single fight\u2026\u2019Even if Zich was the Count\u2019s eldest son, the scale of this event was too big.\u2018They probably want to taint my reputation and spread the news of my loss far and wide.\u2019Their agenda was obvious to Zich, but he didn\u2019t care. He already expected this.\u2018This is what I wanted.\u2019Zich looked around his surroundings. In the audience seats, there were more people than he expected. Knights, bureaucrats, retainers, and anyone else who had the time seemed to have come.Then, his eyes rested on one of the audience members: the Count and his family sitting on the upper seats. The Count wore his usual serious and solemn face, and next to him, the Countess was going on about something in his ear; and finally, there was Greig who arrogantly stared down at the view below him.\u201cThey really fit each other.\u2019And there wasn\u2019t a spot for him there.\u2018I didn\u2019t realize that when I was young.\u2019Now that Zich thought about it, he had wasted a lot of time because he didn\u2019t know that.\u2018I pity my dead mother.\u2019Zich turned his eyes away from the distasteful family. There was no need for him to keep staring at them uselessly. He had to focus on the opponent in front of him first.\u2018He probably prepared everything he had for this.\u2019Byner, who stood in front of Zich, looked undeniably determined for the revenge match. Even though the match hadn\u2019t begun yet, Byner\u2019s hands kept going to his sword as if he was going to pull it out any moment.\u201cYou must have been really waiting for this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dByner didn\u2019t reply. His bloodshot eyes were locked onto Zich.\u201cGive it your all. If you want to make up for your shameful loss, this is your best chance.\u201dOnly a few knew that Zich had beaten Byner, so baseless rumors about the incident spread across the Count\u2019s residence. To ensure that those rumors stayed as rumors, Byner had to defeat Zich in this duel.Byner grunted, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have etched the lesson I learned from you into my heart. I think it is time for me to give you a lesson now. There\u2019s a limit to winning by catching a person off-guard. In the end, the one with true skills will win.\u201dByner\u2019s attitude and stance were completely different than when Zich first met him; he was like a knight right before a battlefield.\u201cYour stance is commendable, but you must also know that if you lose here, it will worsen your already bad situation.\u201d\u201cI heard that you started to learn how to control mana.\u201d\u201cDid you hear that from Greig?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t seem surprised that I know.\u201d\u201cIf you have a brain, it\u2019s not hard to realize it. Of course, Greig will spread information that will put me at a disadvantage.\u201d\u201cDo you feel confident just because you\u2019ve learned a bit of mana control?\u201d\u201cNo, but that\u2019s one of the many reasons.\u201dByner\u2019s face finally broke into a smile, but there wasn\u2019t a shred of amiability in his expression.\u2018That\u2019s a good smile. It\u2019s something that can really piss someone off after fucking them over. I should practice it later.\u2019There were still a lot of things to learn in this world.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019m going to destroy your delusions thoroughly.\u201d\u201cSure. Try hard to do that since we are not just battling for your honor.\u201dZich pointed in a direction with his thumb.Since the arena was so large and the audience was scattered all around, it wasn\u2019t hard to see what Zich was pointing at. Hans, whom Zich had beaten up, was hanging onto the wall that separated the audience seats and the arena. The servant\u2019s stiff expression revealed his state of mind: if Byner lost this duel, Hans\u2019s life was over. Byner would be disgraced and receive some punishment, but Hans\u2019s head would be sliced off from his body.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. There\u2019s no way I will lose.\u201dThat was why Byner wanted to recover his tarnished reputation and wanted Zich to have a taste of his own medicine.\u201cThe duel will commence now!\u201dThe knight, standing next to the Count on the upper seats, moved to the social seat that stuck out. As if he had infused some mana into his voice, the man\u2019s voice echoed throughout the arena.\u2018They really went all out on this.\u2019The man, who just spoke, wasn\u2019t just any man. Among the Count\u2019s troops, he was called the Kingdom\u2019s metal fortress, the man in the forefront of all battles and the strongest, and best knight in the Steelwall army: Mihen Tiner.Now that he was reaching old age, half of Tiner\u2019s hair and beard had white streaks. Still, with his swelled-up muscles and bursting veins, he seemed to be defying time.\u2018For the Captain of the Knights, Tiner, to be the host\u2014what a spectacular duel.\u2019Of course, Zich didn\u2019t feel any gratitude.\u201cThis is a duel between Zich Steelwall, the eldest son of the great Count Steelwall, and Halton Byner, the knight of the Steel Spear Order of Knights. The fight will continue until one loses consciousness or admits defeat! Murder won\u2019t be accepted!\u201dThe audience murmured. It wasn\u2019t that they were surprised about the no murder rule. Even if the Steelwalls ostracized Zich, there was no way that they would approve of the killing of the Count\u2019s eldest son. What surprised the audience was the first condition.\u201cThe duel will continue until one of them loses consciousness or admits defeat? Aren\u2019t they saying that they won\u2019t intervene even if the fight becomes bloody?\u201d\u201cThat means the fight will go on even if one of them is fatally wounded. Is this really alright?\u201dWith the exception of a fight for life and death, these rules were among the most dangerous and intense rules for a duel.Byner thought the same way.\u201cAre you fine with those conditions?\u201d\u201cWhy, does it scare you?\u201d\u201cThe cost of your recklessness will be high.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t matter if I just crack the back of your head like last time.\u201dIn contrast to people\u2019s worries and thoughts, Zich seemed as calm as ever, but having been reminded of his humiliating defeat, Byner\u2019s emotions rose again.\u201c\u2026Fine.\u201dByner hardened his heart, and Byner thought he shouldn\u2019t kill Zich. Instead, he\u2019d give the young noble a stronger thrashing than he had planned.\u201cAlthough they raised their swords because of clashing views, I pray that their intentions are pure! Let them prove their pure intentions with their swords!\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s definitely pure. Pure enough to try to cover up their wrongs and accept a duel with lies.\u201dZich\u2019s sarcasm pierced Byner\u2019s heart, and he gritted his teeth.\u201cUnsheath your swords!Sling! Sling!Both Zich and Byner pulled out their swords. The murmuring audience fell into silence, and heavy tension blanketed the arena.\u201cStart!\u201dTwo swords moved in unison.Clang!The piercing sound of clashing swords echoed throughout the arena. Swords bounced off from the impact, and Zich and Byner softly stilled their swords.A distance between them formed.Bam!Byner ran in first. He had no intention of dragging out this duel; he wanted to end it as fast as possible and wanted an overwhelming victory to cover for his past, humiliating defeat.\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if he gets seriously injured! I shouldn\u2019t think about controlling my strength right now!\u2019Byner had also prepared a potion and a fuse just in case. His muscles twitched as mana flowed through him, and superhuman power surrounded his body.Woooooo!Mana, which strengthened his muscles, seeped into his sword, and the sword began to ring. Its cries sounded like the screams of a homicidal maniac crying for blood.\u2018It\u2019s over,\u2019 Tiner thought as he watched the duel from afar. The Zich he knew didn\u2019t have the skills to stop the next series of blows.\u2018Even if he\u2019s started to learn about mana, this is not something a beginner can block.\u2019And Tiner strained his muscles so that he could move immediately. Even if Zich was almost disowned by his family, he was still the eldest, and Tiner couldn\u2019t simply let Zich die.\u2018Byner is too excited. I should really make him go through more mental training\u2026\u2019Clannnnng!The sound of iron rods clashing against each other disturbed Tiner from his thoughts. The sound was extremely high and sharp, as if swords of similar strengths were confronting one another, and Tiner immediately began thinking again.\u2018This is\u2026\u2019It was unbelievable\u2014Zich and Byner were engaging in a close fight, and Tiner\u2019s eyes widened to witness the brilliance of such a battle.* * *Swords danced in a dizzying whirl. The duelers sometimes swung their swords widely or instantly drew their swords back and sharply pierced toward their opponents\u2019 vulnerable spots again.The audience felt an odd mix of tension, excitement, and confusion. They felt excited from witnessing a fight that could easily result in a death with a single mishap and felt a sense of embarrassment from seeing how Zich\u2019s skills were well beyond their expectations.Clang! Clang!They exchanged a countless number of clashes.Byner swung his sword again with murderous intent. As expected of an official knight, he showed sophisticated skills and swung his sword with great strength.Claaaang!Once again, Zich\u2019s black sword stopped his sword.\u2018Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Goddamn it!\u2019Byner grimaced, and in his heart, he had already sworn more than a thousand curses. His plan of defeating Zich as quickly as possible to recover his honor had already crumbled into dust.Inside the arena, Byner could feel the mood that was spreading among his audience.\u2018He hasn\u2019t even learned proper swordsmanship!\u2019If things continued like this, his reputation would be tarnished even more. Byner had the upper hand for now, but it was not enough with just that.Slam!Byner took a step backward and thought, \u2018I will bet my victory on this!\u2019Then, he tilted his sword horizontally and brought it next to his face. The end of his sword was aimed at Zich\u2019s neck.\u2018A big one is coming.\u2019Zich prepared his stance, spread his legs wide apart, and lifted his sword straight up.Byner\u2019s sword began to cry crazily, and mana flowed into his body wildly. Mana circled through his body once like a turbulent wave and passed into his sword and back to his body again. A huge stream circulated through his body and sword, and at that moment, Byner\u2019s senses extended from his body to his sword.\u2018That is!\u2019Tiner\u2019s eyes widened. Everyone who recognized Byner\u2019s state became surprised, and even the Count leaned forward. Byner was using a considerably advanced technique. Even though it was a skill that most of the knights in Steelwall could use, it was beyond what people in Byner\u2019s age range could do.Shoot!Like a stream of light, Byner\u2019s body seemed to elongate, but it was only an illusion. Then, in the blink of an eye, the ends of Byner\u2019s sword inched toward Zich\u2019s neck.\u2018Caught you!\u2019Byner\u2019s eyes sparkled.Clang!After feeling the shock, Byner hurriedly straightened his body again and held onto his sword.Skritch!Byner\u2019s sword slid down as it scratched the body of Zich\u2019s sword.Slam!Byner\u2019s sword stopped and got stuck on Zich\u2019s guard, and Zich smiled at the sight of Byner\u2019s sword hanging next to his face.\u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201dByner stood still from the shock of seeing his killer strike get blocked and he heard Zich\u2019s voice ringing in his ear.\u201cI told you that you were easy.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Count, Greig, and the Order of Knights had their mouths shut, not saying anything. No, they were at a loss for words.On the other hand, the Countess and the others who didn\u2019t know much about military arts were surprised by the strange atmosphere. They sensed that Zich had done something amazing, but they didn\u2019t know to what extent.Verden Trell, the butler of the Count\u2019s family, asked, \u201cContrary to our expectations, the young master is doing well. But seeing the knights\u2019 reaction, it seems like he is doing better than what I am seeing. Could you perhaps explain the situation to me?\u201dTrell had a long, neat beard and was an old man who had assisted the Count as a retainer since the Count\u2019s young days. He was an essential servant who took care of all sorts of matters in the Count\u2019s absence. Furthermore, he was one of the very few people who didn\u2019t discriminate against Zich.Trell asked his question to the middle-aged man behind the Count, named Danny Chris Nunn, the vice-captain of the \u2018Steel Spear Order of Knights.\u2019 Chris Nunn\u2019s standing wasn\u2019t comparable to Tiner, who was the captain of the Order, but he was one of the three most influential people in Steelwall.\u201cOh, oh my. Zich seems to be doing well, but doesn\u2019t Sir Byner still have the upper hand?\u201dThe Countess felt personally offended by all the compliments that Zich was receiving and hurriedly placed Byner back on the pedestal. Trell smiled pleasantly and responded to the Countess, but it wasn\u2019t what the Countess wanted to hear.\u201cSince the young master has never properly learned swordsmanship before, Sir Byner would, of course, have the advantage in a duel. If that\u2019s not the case, then the Order of Knights will be disgraced.\u201dChris Nunn sighed. As the vice-captain of the Order of Knights, he felt particularly pressured.Trell continued on like he had missed the Vice-captain\u2019s sighs.\u201cBut it is true that the young master, Zich, is doing much better than we expected. Seeing the knights\u2019 reaction, it seems his skills are much higher than what we can see. I can\u2019t be happier to see that the young master of the Steelwall family is so highly-skilled even without proper training.\u201dThe Countess\u2019s expression darkened while Greig\u2019s breathing became harsh. But they didn\u2019t show any reactions beyond that because Trell was someone who even the Countess had a hard time dealing with.\u201cHow is it, Sir Chris Nunn?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you are aware of the Extension of the Senses.\u201d\u201cFrom what I heard, I know that Extension of the Senses is a skill where you can synchronize your body and sword with mana and move a sword as part of your hands and feet. Is that right?\u201d\u201cThat is exactly right. It\u2019s a rite of passage for a standard knight to learn the skill, but it is also challenging to learn because you have to control your mana very subtly. It\u2019s not something that someone in Byner\u2019s age range can normally do.\u201d\u201cIs Sir Byner in his young twenties?\u201d\u201cHe is twenty-three.\u201d\u201cHohoho. It\u2019s a blessing for Steelwall to have such a young talent. But Sir Chris Nunn.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYoung master Zich seems to be able to use that amazing skill. Is that right?\u201dNo matter what, he was still the Steelwalls\u2019 butler, and Trell had enough sense to notice that Zich was using the same skill called \u2018Extension of the Senses\u2019 that Byner used. Chris Nunn took a quick glance at the Countess, but in the end, he nodded.\u201cThat is right.\u201d\u201cAnd isn\u2019t young master Zich, nineteen this year? He is younger than Knight Byner by four years. How many have mastered that skill at that age?\u201d\u201c\u2026As far as I know, no one in our Order.\u201d\u201cIncluding Knight Tiner?\u201d\u201cTo my knowledge, the Captain learned the skill around the same time as Byner.\u201d\u201cThat is really impressive,\u201d Trell said in admiration. He then rolled over to Greig who was sitting next to the Count. A combination of agitation, embarrassment, jealousy, and a sense of inferiority flurried onto Greig\u2019s face at once. His eyes blazed as he stared down at the fighting ground.\u201cDoes that mean that young master Greig has also not mastered the skill yet?\u201dGreig\u2019s face stiffened. Chris Nunn nodded again while sensing Greig\u2019s change in expression.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dChris Nunn didn\u2019t support Zich; he actually thought Greig was the rightful heir like the rest of the people in Steelwall, and he was simply answering a question as a fellow fighter.\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cE-Even if Greig hasn\u2019t mastered this skill yet, he knows many other good skills.\u201d\u201cThe Countess\u2019s words are right. Extension of the Senses isn\u2019t the only skill that a knight has to learn. It is definitely a vital skill, but other skills are also critical.\u201dChris Nunn supported the Countess.\u201cOf course. I know how amazing young master Greig is. He is the pride of Steelwall.\u201dTrell smiled and went with the flow.\u201cI\u2019m glad that you recognize that.\u201dThe Countess\u2019s expression finally loosened, but as if he was doing it on purpose, Trell provoked the Countess again.\u201cAs the family\u2019s butler, my heart overflows with emotions now that the Steelwall family has two people to boast about.\u201d\u201cT-that\u2019s true.\u201dWith almost teary eyes, the Countess stared at Chris Nunn. It was evident that she wanted him to somehow prove that Greig was better than Zich. Unfortunately for the Countess, Chris Nunn was a beast in battle but weak in politics. Chris Nunn continued to stare at the fighting ground with an awkward expression until his eyes widened.\u201cSee that!\u201dByner drew his sword backward and quickly threw it in the air.Bam!There was an explosion, and the space in front of Byner curved strangely.With a theatrical voice, Chris Nunn spat,\u201cThat is a skill called \u2018Piercing Space.\u2019 You have to concentrate mana into the ends of your sword to fiercely pierce at the space in front of you to shoot air mixed with mana-like arrows at your opponent. It\u2019s also a difficult skill to learn, but young master Greig can also execute it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s amazing, but Sir Chris Nunn\u2026\u201dTrell pointed to the fighting ground with his hand.\u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem like young master Zich can also use it?\u201dTrell\u2019s finger pointed at Zich who seemed to be skillfully avoiding the invisible \u2018Piercing Space\u2019 moves and was actually responding with the same techniques.\u201cI-I see. It seems that young master Zich has also mastered the skill.\u201dChris Nunn clamped his mouth shut after saying those words. He would only lose if he recklessly opened his mouth again. He could feel the Countess\u2019s eyes, filled with resentment, prickling along his back.* * *Byner was in a state of confusion.\u201cWhat in the world!\u201dHe never thought something like this would happen, not even once. His opponent was a beginner who just started playing with mana and had never learned swordsmanship.But now, his opponent was showing off advanced skills one after another and putting up a good fight; and of course, the audience\u2019s interest was on Zich.Byner\u2019s plan to overwhelmingly and spectacularly defeat Zich to recover his tarnished reputation was already ruined. Anyone could tell that this duel\u2019s main lead wasn\u2019t Byner but Zich.\u2018I have to win! I have to win! I have to win!\u2019Byner\u2019s head was only filled with his desire to win. The only thing left for him was to protect his honor by somehow winning this duel.\u2018Fortunately, my skills don\u2019t look too awkward.\u2019There was a slight delay every time Zich used a skill against Byner as if he was using something his body wasn\u2019t used to. It was a very faint gap, but Byner\u2019s prodigal instincts sensed it.\u2018By whatever means! I have to knock him down!\u2019Byner\u2019s heart burned with emotions that teetered between justice and murderous intent.It wasn\u2019t a good situation for Zich.\u2018My body is starting to crack a bit.\u2019Even if Zich was utilizing the experience he had gained as the Demon Lord of Strength, he was slowly reaching his limit. His current body hadn\u2019t gone through the same training.\u2018The skills aren\u2019t absolute either.\u2019Zich was using many advanced techniques, but that was only because he was able to control his mana to near perfection.Although many had misunderstood Zich\u2019s techniques to be rough because of his nickname as the Demon Lord of Strength, that was only because the results of his actions were so destructive; many of his techniques were actually very sophisticated.But that was all. Zich lacked in everything else that didn\u2019t require mana control. Furthermore, because his body wasn\u2019t used to the techniques, there were slight cracks in his movements that came out here and there.\u2018It\u2019s like thinking about how I have to move each muscle fiber beforehand.\u2019It was also a moment that revealed how monstrous Zich was to put something as nonsensical as that into action.Slam!The distance between the two widened again.\u201cIt seems you have trained in secret for quite a while. To think you even know how to use Extension of the Senses.\u201d\u201cSomething like extending my senses is a piece of cake.\u201dHe didn\u2019t mean to provoke Byner. For Zich, who had near-perfect control in mana, Extension of the Senses was an easy skill to master.\u201cThen keep hanging on like that.\u201dByner rushed in again.Clang!The sound of clanging iron echoed. The situation was the same as before\u2014no, it only seemed that way. Byner\u2019s attacks poured out in violent waves, and Zich resisted and strategically fought back.But anyone with good senses realized it.\u2018It will end soon.\u2019Tiner guessed the end of this surprising and unexpected duel. Although Zich\u2019s abilities were surprising, as expected of Steelwall\u2019s best knight, Byner knew Zich\u2019s weak spots.When Byner started to poke at these weak spots, Zich\u2019s hands and feet started to lose control.\u2018But young master Zich\u2019s skills are really surprising. Did he always have this much talent?\u2019Seeing the gaps in his techniques, it looked like Zich had learned them recently, but the completed execution was surprising.\u2018He must have practiced the techniques for a while, and after learning how to control mana, he must have exponentially brought them to completion.\u2019Although the techniques that Zich was using were impressive, they were also widespread. Tiner thought that Zich could have chosen from a lot of people to teach him.\u2018But it doesn\u2019t change how amazing this is. He can really push young master Greig out of the picture at this rate.\u2019Tiner glanced at Greig who was biting his lips while intensely staring at the duel before him.Clash!Blood spurted out, and groans or exclamations escaped from the audience. The place where the blood poured out was from Zich\u2019s forearm.\u2018It\u2019s deep. I guess it will end like this.\u2019Tiner was sure that the duel would end with Zich\u2019s surrender, and he got ready to step down to the stage.Push!Blood spurted out again, but this time, the blood wasn\u2019t Zich\u2019s.\u2018He stabbed back?\u2019Tiner\u2019s body froze in place. The absolutely unexpected was taking place on the fighting ground.* * *\u201cUgh!\u201dByner looked down at his burning wound. There was a deep, long cut in his left forearm, and blood was trickling out of it.\u2018What the hell!\u2019Byner recalled what just happened; he aimed to attack the vulnerabilities made by the gaps in Zich\u2019s techniques. The gaps in Zich\u2019s techniques were getting bigger, and he finally succeeded in piercing through the defenses to land an attack on Zich.But at that exact moment, he was wounded by Zich\u2019s sword.\u2018No way!\u2019Byner suddenly realized what happened.\u2018No, he didn\u2019t defend. He gave up on it!\u2019Knowing that it was getting hard to defend, Zich gave up on defending all together. Zich had sacrificed a little to gain much more.\u2018Stay calm! Stay calm, Byner!\u2019Byner had heard about a situation like this in his education many times before, and considering the situation, he was still at an advantage. His opponent was cornered to the point that he had to give up his defense, and although his wound pained him, he had experienced this kind of injury many times before.However, his heart continued to beat like crazy without any sign of calming down.Although Byner had seen many guys rush into fights out of desperation like mountain bandits, it was his first time against a tactical opponent on a similar skill level. His experience was lacking even if he was a genius knight.\u201cYou are nervous, right?\u201d Zich asked. Unlike Byner who was desperately trying to calm himself, Zich was smiling. Byner began to feel terrified.\u201cThis is just the beginning. It\u2019s going to be a deathmatch rather than a duel. Stay alert.\u201dZich rushed towards Byner. It wasn\u2019t like the sophisticated movements he had shown so far, but a straight forward dash with many open spots, but Byner couldn\u2019t attack. He knew that if he tried to attack Zich\u2019s weak spots, Zich would pay him back with a greater attack.Byner helplessly blocked Zich\u2019s attack. And afterward, like Zich said, a battle that reeked of blood unfolded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If the mood that swept the audience earlier were excitement and worries, now they were only filled with astonishment. Their faces that were red from excitement grew pale. Some bureaucrats who weren\u2019t used to the sight of blood even gagged like they were about to vomit.Push!Blood spurted onto the fighting ground again, and the ground was a bloody mess. It was hard to tell if the blood was fresh or if it was previously there.\u201cHuff! Huff! Huff!\u201dByner\u2019s breathing was rough. His hands trembled, and his vision became hazy.\u201cHow is it? What is a battle for life and death like?\u201dZich\u2019s voice felt distant, like a ringing echo.\u201cIsn\u2019t it thrilling? If you think that the blood flowing through your body is like a living creature, each drop feels so precious. In a way, you feel the most alive when you are about to die.\u201dZich\u2019s sword flew towards him again, and Byner blocked the sword with his shaking hands.Clang!Swirl!The attack wasn\u2019t even that strong since Zich was as much injured as Byner, but Byner swayed at such an attack.\u201cThis is what I like about our family. They won\u2019t make a fuss to end a fight like this.\u201dIt was true the Count and everyone else wasn\u2019t requesting to end the duel because this was the Steelwall family\u2019s custom.\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with soon. I have another guy that I have to finish.\u201dWhile dragging his sword, Zich approached Byner.Byner didn\u2019t even have the strength to move. He blankly stared as Zich raised his sword over him. Byner felt cold.\u201cYou fought well. If you endure this ordeal now, you will be able to jump up to the next level.\u201d\u2018Of course, if you fail to do that, you will be rolling in the mud like a common loser.\u2019Bam!Zich hit Byner\u2019s head with his sword\u2019s handle hard, and Byner lost consciousness.Crash!* * *Byner collapsed. The winner was decided, but instead of cheers, joys, sighs, or even curses, the audience was dead silent.\u201c\u2026The winner is\u2026 Sir Zich Steelwall!\u201dAfter Tiner\u2019s loud shout, people finally began to murmur. It was as if they finally remembered how to breathe again.\u201cHaaa!\u201dZich took in a deep breath.\u2018I won somehow.\u2019He had to admit that Byner was a genius knight. Zich started a deathmatch to use Byner\u2019s lack of experience against him, but the knight had endured.Byner felt anxious, seeing the blood of the eldest son of the family he served\u2014no matter how much he hated Zich, the thought of accidentally taking Zich\u2019s life had put him on edge. Byner\u2019s wounds and fear for his own life distressed him, and most of all, Zich swung his sword around like an immortal dripping in blood. All of these factors pressured Byner throughout the fight.Furthermore, unlike Zich who was accustomed to bloody battles, Byner had only engaged in actual fighting a couple of times. But with all these factors against him, Byner persisted.Even with the same number of injuries\u2014the difference in experience, patience, movements, and other factors resulted in Zich\u2019s victory. All the knights, including the Count, realized this.\u201cHey, Verden.\u201d\u201cYes, Count!\u201d\u201cHow did he learn all that? Where did he gain the experience? Who taught him?\u201dIf somebody had taught Zich, the butler, Trell, who knew almost everything inside the household, would know of all people. Trell shook his head.\u201cI was also not aware of the level of skill that the young master possessed. From what I know, I heard that he practiced by himself in the back of a garden.\u201dIf Trell was this certain, there was no way that Zich would have learned from someone.\u201cThen how can he fight like that?\u201d\u201cSir Count.\u201dTrell whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t you already know the reason? I think you just don\u2019t want to admit it.\u201dThe Count shut his mouth. Trell\u2019s words had hit the bull\u2019s eye. The Count scowled and said as if he was lamenting, \u201cYou are saying that\u2026he is born talented.\u201dTrell nodded.A figure like that appeared in history once in a while. As if the gods chose them, they broke all common logic and won victoriously without any education or experience. Trell was saying that Zich was someone like that.\u2018This is not good.\u2019The Count wanted to hand over Steelwall to Greig, not Zich. Thankfully, Greig\u2019s abilities were outstanding, and due to a series of several causes, the residents of Steelwall all hated Zich and liked Greig.\u2018The next Count is Greig.\u2019 That was the already accepted perception in Steelwall. However, if Zich showed overwhelming talent, that thought would be broken into pieces.\u2018Tradition favors Zich. If I try to hand over Steelwall to Greig without a good reason, other people will try to meddle in. Furthermore, even if they all dislike Zich, if the boy shows outstanding talent, their hearts may waver in favor of him.\u2019All of them were in Steelwall, which was located in the Kingdom\u2019s frontline; above all, skills in military arts were the most important trait a person could possess. People would even follow a person they hated if there was a high chance that he or she could protect them. All kinds of thoughts rushed into the Count\u2019s head.When all eyes were on him, Zich moved.* * *Priests began to come forward to treat Byner. The priests raised their arms and shook their hands widely to indicate that Byner\u2019s life wasn\u2019t in danger, and people sighed in relief.The priests also approached Zich.\u201cSir! We will treat you right away!\u201dThe priests\u2019 voices were urgent, because although Zich had less wounds than Byner, the wounds were also severe.\u201cWait.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cI still have something to take care of.\u201dZich pushed the priests who were about to use God\u2019s miracles on him away and walked to the stadium\u2019s outskirts. Zich\u2019s unexpected behavior drew everyone\u2019s attention again. They were also frightened by the sight of him staggering while dripping blood all over his path.Tiner, who was standing in front of the social seat in front of the audience asked, \u201cWhat is it, Sir Zich?\u201d\u201cAh, Sir Tiner. It\u2019s nothing much. I just have something to say to Greig.\u201dZich\u2019s voice rang out. Mana was imbued into his voice so that everyone in the stadium could hear him well.\u2018Ha, how\u2026?\u2019Tiner was surprised yet again. It didn\u2019t surprise him that Zich could imbue mana in his voice since he could use a skill like Extension of the Senses, but it was impressive that Zich could use mana so cleanly while he was heavily injured; only a few trained knights could accomplish such a task.Zich yelled at Greig.\u201cGreig! Come down! It\u2019s a duel!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?!\u201dGreg was so astounded that he let out a gasp. Everyone else was astounded too.\u201c\u2026What are you saying?\u201d the Count asked. As if he was also in shock, his response was a bit slow.\u201cWhat do you think I am saying? I am challenging him to a duel. Father, didn\u2019t you also permit this? I know that the rumors have spread quite far already.\u201d\u2018A duel between Zich and Greig,\u2019 people murmured.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the unofficially announced duel for the Steelwall\u2019s inheritance?\u201d\u201cMind your words! It doesn\u2019t make sense that a single duel would decide the heir.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s what the rumors say. Even the Count\u2019s actions seem to indicate that he will give greater preference to the victor of the duel. It\u2019s so obvious that they\u2019re trying to give Sir Greig the edge in becoming the heir since they thought that Sir Zich had no chance in winning.\u201dThe bloody battle, Zich\u2019s unexpected win, and his behavior encouraged the audience to say the words that they had held back.\u201cS-Sir! Let us treat your wounds first\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dZich pushed the priests away and shouted again.\u201cHey, Greig! Come down quickly! I will fight in my current state! I thought I should at least give myself a handicap while fighting my younger brother!\u201dPeople were surprised again, especially the priests beside Zich. They felt like their feet were rolling and they were on the verge of having a stroke.\u201cS-Sir! You can\u2019t! You have to get treated immediately!\u201dWith blood pouring out all over him, Zich looked like a red monster. He looked like he was about to die from excessive blood loss, but Zich remained calm.\u201cDon\u2019t overreact. I won\u2019t die with this much.\u201d\u201cNo, this is really dangerous, sir!\u201dAs if they were annoying flies, Zich waved them away with his hands, and the priests thought they were going mad.\u201cWhat are you doing, Greig! Hurry up!\u201d\u201cW-what kind of nonsense are you spouting! Receive treatment first! How are you going to duel like that!\u201dGreig had a point. Anyone could see that instead of dueling, Zich needed treatment immediately; he should be lying on a bed.\u201cI will handle that. Besides, we made a promise in the first place.\u201dZich smirked.\u201cI\u2019ll decide when our duel begins.\u201dGreig shut his mouth. He was the one who had proposed the duel while placing his conditions. Now that Zich brought up the promise, Greig had no choice but to comply.\u201cStop it! How are you going to fight with those wounds! Are you planning to crush your brother\u2019s heart in worry about your physical condition?!\u201d\u201cAh, is that right, Father? I didn\u2019t think far enough. But you know, I have no choice but to misunderstand. I mean, look at Greig\u2019s face right now,\u201d Zich said with an innocent face. But in contrast to that, he was blocking every path that his opponent could escape from.\u201cDoesn\u2019t he look afraid?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dUsually, Greig would\u2019ve thrown a fit. For many reasons, Greig hated to be considered lower than Zich in any area more than anything; but now, he was silent. Only his lips twitched as if he had something to say.Greig\u2019s face became pale, and his pupils shook while his lips bled. Everyone could see that Greig was frightened.\u201cStop it, younger brother. Lighten up a bit. Or else, other people will misunderstand. Like me, they might believe that you are just a coward, so fearful that you will break a promise to escape from a duel.\u201dPeople stared at Greig. Their eyes, which had always been filled with confidence and faith towards Greig, began to show doubts.\u201cEven if that is the case, Sir Greig still lacks experience. To say that he is a coward\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, do I have experience?\u201dTiner tried to defend Greig but fell into silence at Zich\u2019s words.\u2018Yes, this is the biggest problem.\u2019Everyone who watched the duel between Zich and Byner could completely understand how Greig was feeling: even if the Count placed great expectations onto him, Greig was just a boy in his mid-teens.Also, Zich\u2019s spectacle had ruined everything; he had shown that he could be a more fitting figure to inherit the Count\u2019s position, and according to tradition, he had a great advantage.\u201cI am worried about you, Brother. Even if I am the traditional heir, it doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have the right to succession. What will people think if you run away from here like a coward? They might be very disappointed in you to see that you don\u2019t have the courage like the eldest son. They might even start to say that they don\u2019t want to see you succeed.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of nonsense are you spouting!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not nonsense, Mother.\u201dUpon hearing Zich say Mother, the Countess\u2019s expression crumpled, and people began to murmur again.Zich continued, \u201cAlthough this duel is unofficial, it is very important to Greig and me. But as his older brother, I am trying to make the situation more advantageous for Greig. Look at my body. Isn\u2019t it a complete mess? If he tries to escape from a situation like this, he won\u2019t be able to lead even a flock, more or less Steelwall. And above all, Mother, Greig promised me a duel where I get to decide the date and time.\u201dZich\u2019s eyes searched for the Count. Then, once he found him, Zich smiled at the Count who was scarily glaring at him.\u201cWhat are you going to do, Father?\u201d\u201c\u2026Greig, go down to the fighting ground.\u201d\u201cCount!\u201d\u201cFather!\u201dBoth the Countess and Greig shouted in surprise, but the Count didn\u2019t take back his words.\u201cGo down.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sword at his hip seemed to grow heavier, and his feet seemed to drag him down as he walked towards Zich.\u201cAh, fuck! It hurts! That\u2019s enough!\u201d\u201cThen get treated first!\u201d\u201cI told you\u2014I\u2019m going to fight without getting treated!\u201d\u201cThen shut your mouth for a moment! It\u2019s going to be over soon!\u201dThe priest shouted at Zich as he began to wrap bandages on Zich\u2019s injuries. Despite Zich\u2019s annoyed expression and complaints, he moved his body to make it easier for the priest to bandage him.\u201cI\u2019m all done.\u201d\u201cIs it finally over?\u201d\u201cI only performed emergency care, so please remember that you are this close to suffering from extreme blood loss! Whether you win or lose, please quickly finish the duel and get proper treatment\u2026!\u201d\u201cOooh, don\u2019t I look like an undead? I look like a mummy right now. If someone meets me in a dungeon, they will think I will attack them\u2026!\u201d\u201cPlease listen to me!\u201dZich had to forcefully push away the priest who looked as if he was about to cry. Without saying anything, Greig watched the situation unfold and stared at Zich. As Zich said, his whole body was covered in bandages like a mummy. Since he had only gotten minimum emergency care, blood quickly seeped through his bandages.\u2018How the hell is he still moving?!\u2019Greig thought he had good endurance, but seeing Zich\u2019s current state, he realized that he was nowhere near Zich\u2019s level.Zich began to wave his sword around; it was to check if the bandages hampered his movements. As expected, his injuries widened again, and blood began to seep through the bandages at an even faster pace. However, Zich didn\u2019t seem bothered by this and looked pleased that the bandages did not hinder his body\u2019s movements.Zich gave a signal that he was ready for battle, and Tiner, the host, cried, \u201cDraw your swords!\u201dThere was no other rhetoric this time. In consideration of Zich\u2019s injury, it seemed as if Tiner was trying to proceed with the duel as fast as possible.Greig pulled out his sword and Zich lifted his sword up.\u201cStart!\u201dThe second duel, which no one except Zich anticipated, began.Greig looked a bit scared, but since he had been training for a long time, his stance was steady. In comparison, Zich held his sword around his shoulder in a sloppy manner.\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you? Are you not coming toward me? Are you seriously expecting your injured brother to make the first attack? I didn\u2019t know you were such an awful bastard.\u201dZich provoked Greig lightly, but Greig merely fixed his grip and did not rush to attack.\u2018Calm down. The situation is advantageous for me right now.\u2019It wouldn\u2019t have been strange if Zich fainted at this very moment. Compared to Zich, there wasn\u2019t a single injury on Greig, and he was in a good condition. Of course, Zich\u2019s skills were unexpected, but even considering that, the situation still favored Greig.\u2018I know this! How can I not know this!\u2019Unlike Zich, Greig had gone through many different types of training and education. But why was he\u2026why was the hand on his sword shaking?\u201cAre you really not going to come at me? I guess you never had an ounce of cuteness in you. Okay, fine. Your dear brother will make the first move.\u201dSwish!Zich swung his body forward. His entire body, from the very tip of his foot, shook a bit as he moved. Indeed, his injuries impacted him, but the way he moved towards Greig was sharp and clean.\u201cUgh!\u201dGreig raised his sword to block Zich\u2019s attack.\u2018It has less force than I expected.\u2019The numerous injuries on Zich\u2019s body seemed to have affected his fighting power. Paralyzed with fear and nerves, Greig began to feel hopeful again.\u2018I can win!\u2019But it was when Greig recovered his confidence and raised his sword to attack\u2014Clashhh!\u201cUrgh!\u201dGreig barely managed to block Zich. As if he was a leaf flying in the wind, Zich landed another swift attack on Greig.Greig took a moment to steady himself. Right above him, Zich\u2019s attacks poured down like a rainstorm.\u2018H-his attacks are different from before!\u2019Each of his attacks was light, but they were all lightning fast. His current style was completely different from when he was fighting with Byner.\u201cHis attacks are completely different from before!\u201dTrell could not help but express his shock. No matter what other people thought, he wanted the best person to succeed as the Count. Zich\u2019s unexpected talent was a fortunate miscalculation for him.However, people like him were definitely in the minority.While considering the Count and Countess\u2019s feelings, Chris Nunn carefully answered Trell, \u201cHe probably changed his fighting style because of his injuries. Since his injuries would widen even by the force of their swords clashing, he is absorbing the force of the attack as much as he can. It seems like he\u2019s also reflecting some of the force back towards his opponent. Look at him right now. Can\u2019t you see that he is using the rebounds against his opponent?\u201d\u201cIs this an easy thing to do?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201dEven while replying, Chris Nunn felt troubled.\u2018Sir Zich is even more talented than I thought.\u2019From what Zich had shown them so far, at least in regards to fighting prowess, his ability was close to being godlike. Even after just awakening his mana, he was able to use high-level skills right away, turn a duel into a deathmatch, and drive Byner into a corner. And right after that, he challenged Greig and maintained an upper hand.\u2018And it\u2019s not just his basic skills. He cleverly exploited Byner\u2019s lack of experience and shook him up psychologically to increase his chances of winning. He really understands the know-how to win.\u2019And this \u201cknow-how to win\u201d was an absolute necessity for the Steelwall family that always needed to protect themselves from intruders.\u2018I thought Sir Greig was good enough to be the next Count, but\u2026\u2019Chris Nunn stole a furtive glance at the Count and Countess.\u2018Their expressions seem strained.\u2019He could understand their feelings. Once again, Chris Nunn looked back towards the duel.\u2018With Sir Greig\u2019s skills, he would become a good Count. However, if Sir Zich becomes a Count\u2026\u2019And if Zich\u2019s other abilities were even half of his fighting abilities\u2026\u2018He would become an outstanding Count.\u2019His skill, bravery, and guts. For Chris Nunn who was a military man to the core, he couldn\u2019t help but admire Zich\u2019s many talents, especially his fighting prowess. Likewise, there were probably many who shared Chris Nunn\u2019s feelings right now.Chris Nunn started to lean towards Zich\u2019s side and tried to harden his heart. And as the butler for this family, Trell had a deeper understanding of Zich\u2019s abilities than Chris Nunn who was purely a military man.\u2018His ability to plan is astounding.\u2019Trell keenly watched Zich push Greig back with a severely wounded body.\u2018With Sir Zich\u2019s skills, he will be able to slowly push back Sir Greig. However, this process will be very lengthy, and many unexpected situations can arise. I\u2019m sure that the Count and Sir Greig will use many different tactics to prevent Sir Zich from succeeding. However, with this duel, Sir Zich is able to display his skills to everyone in Steelwall, and I\u2019m also sure that this will shake up many people.\u2019Chris Nunn, who was standing next to him, was a clear example of this. Even though he tried to stay low in fear of the Count and Countess, Chris Nunn couldn\u2019t hide the sparkle in his eyes as he watched Zich\u2019s fight.\u2018Sir Zich probably expected the Count to blow up the situation like this.\u2019If he hadn\u2019t known this, Zich wouldn\u2019t have been able to make the situation so advantageous for him.\u2018No, even if he hadn\u2019t predicted this, it doesn\u2019t matter. It just means that he is extremely adaptable, and he can make any circumstance advantageous to him right now.\u2019Either way, Zich had the brains to perform such a feat, and it was even more outstanding that he was able to think all of this while being surrounded by enemies.\u2018Even if Sir Zich loses this battle, no one will think he actually lost. He was able to beat the genius knight Byner, and even with serious injuries, he fought a second duel right after. Even though they are dueling for the succession, it is informal after all.\u2019If Zich and Greig\u2019s reputations were the same as before, this informal promise would have made a tremendous impact on Zich\u2019s name. However, this duel had completely changed Zich\u2019s image.\u2018Moreover, if Sir Zich manages to beat Sir Greig in his current condition, there will be an enormous ripple in Steelwall.\u2019Zich\u2019s ability to fight consecutively despite his severe injuries was especially significant in Steelwall.\u2018He was able to sharply reduce his risks and increase his returns at the same time. When I heard that he raised a sword against a servant to kill him in front of the Count, I thought he had finally exploded in anger after suppressing his feelings for long, but he exploded in a totally different way.\u2019Even though there were still many things to consider for the future, Trell wanted to side with Zich at this moment. The knights and officials all had their own thoughts about this matter, but the Count was most taken back by Zich\u2019s performance.\u201c\u2026\u201dHis stubborn expression became even more strained.\u201cMy Lord.\u201dWith a shaky voice, the Countess looked at the Count with wavering eyes.\u201cOur Greig won\u2019t lose, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Count did not reply. He continued to watch the duel in silence.\u2018If Zich wins right now\u2026\u2019As the head of Steelwall, he would have to welcome Zich\u2019s change with open arms, but the Count didn\u2019t feel this way at all. The Count\u2019s head began to ache from thinking about the future.* * *Clashhh!Once again, Greig blocked Zich\u2019s attacks, and Zich used the force of the rebound to land another attack.\u2018Wow, it hurts like crazy!\u2019Even though Zich acted like he was alright, his whole body was a mess. Even for a warrior who had gone through all sorts of challenges and trials, he could not help but let out a sigh.\u2018It\u2019s starting to get really serious.\u2019Pretty soon, Zich would be unable to move from dizziness caused by intense blood loss.\u2018Since Greig seems scared enough, should I begin my deathmatch?\u2019Greig flinched at Zich\u2019s sly smile.Strike!Zich tried to restrict his force as much as he could and struck the ground with tremendous strength. Blood spurted out of his wounds.Surprised, Greig dropped his sword. Greig quickly shifted his weight to his right foot and leaned back to avoid Zich\u2019s attack. However, he couldn\u2019t fully escape, and Zich\u2019s attack scraped Greig\u2019s arm.But Zich did not stop his movements.\u2018Wait, this is!\u2019Greig\u2019s heart sank to the bottom. It was easy to see what Zich was planning.\u2018A deathmatch!\u2019As Greig expected, Zich began to swing at Greig without paying any attention to his injuries.Slice!\u201cUrgh!\u201dGreig took a few steps back. A long, red cut appeared on his chest. It was not a deep cut; only his skin was slightly injured, but Greig\u2019s heart began to beat fiercely against his chest.\u201cMy dear brother! Why don\u2019t we begin showing our brotherly camaraderie for real now!\u201dWithout a single consideration for Greig\u2019s feelings, Zich continued to smile while wielding his sword around. Psychologically driven into a corner, Greig began to lose control of his sword. To Greig, the sight of Zich swiveling around his sword with blood dripping down on his smiling face was the perfect image of a demon.Clash!As their swords collided, their faces came even closer. However, their complexions were completely different.\u201cBrother, my brother, my darling brother, why are you making a face like that?\u201d\u201cWhy does my expression matter!\u201dGreig managed to reply with some cheekiness. However, sensing Greig\u2019s fear, it only felt like a scared dog barking to Zich.\u201cAre you afraid? What are you afraid of? Does your great brother suddenly look scary to you? Or are you more afraid of what\u2019ll happen after you lose?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dGreig did not reply, and Zich did not care.\u201cHahahahah! You don\u2019t have to worry! Do you really think your own brother would plan this show for the sake of destroying you? This is all for you. All the emotions that you are experiencing right now\u2014anger, fear, jealousy\u2014they all exist merely for the sake of pushing you one step further!\u201dSurprisingly, Zich was not saying empty words to Greig. However, who was Zich if he did not have malicious intentions?\u201cBut I guess if you are unable to pass this hurdle, you will just collapse from the stress of it all.\u201dZich\u2019s beast-like eyes pierced into Greig\u2019s eyes.\u201cPersonally, I desperately wish that you will meet the latter with all my heart and soul!\u201dZich\u2019s sharp words, which were even worse than the sharpness of Zich\u2019s sword, severely cut Greig\u2019s heart. The duel began to grow more and more dangerous and rough. The bandages on Zich\u2019s body fell apart, and the number of injuries on Greig\u2019s body began to increase.Even though Greig had trained for a long time, he still lacked real experience in battle, and the pressure he felt from Zich suffocated him to the point that he had difficulty breathing. The bravery he was so determined to possess could not be found. Moreover, the brother he had always looked down on and mocked looked absolutely terrifying to him.\u201cSur\u2026.!\u201dAt last, he gave in to the pressure.\u201cI surrender! I surrender this duel!\u201dHalt!Zich\u2019s frantic sword movements stopped at once.Thud!The strength in Greig\u2019s legs left him, and he collapsed onto the floor. In front him, Zich\u2019s bloody sword swung in front of him. Zich withdrew his sword and then lifted his head to look at Tiner.At last, Tiner firmly lifted his hand and shouted, \u201cVictory! Victory for the Honorable Sir Zich Steelwall!\u201dTiner\u2019s announcement was a gunshot that rang through the Steelwall family that signaled the beginning of an enormous change to come.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Some had their mouths shut or talked to those sitting beside them while others were lost in thought. At the unbelievable and ridiculousness of Zich\u2019s second win, people fell into a panic.Snatch!Someone grabbed Zich\u2019s arm.\u201cI can treat you now, right? I am going to do it even if you refuse!\u201dIt was the priest who had sprung onto the dueling ground as soon as the fight was over. With his red face, it seemed like the priest wouldn\u2019t accept a refusal.\u201cDo what you want. I\u2019m tired anyways.\u201dZich threw his sword away and sat down. Truthfully, he was only moving his body with sheer willpower. He would have lost consciousness if Greig\u2019s declaration of defeat had been a moment late.Nevertheless, it was his win.Zich stared at Greig. A priest was also treating him. The area under his eyes was sunken, his face had lost all color, and he had lost a lot of blood.\u2018He is out of it.\u2019Zich felt satisfied.\u2018Greig lost to his older brother who he had always looked down on. At this rate, he may never recover.\u2019But did that matter?\u2018Should I end it here?\u2019This was enough to screw him over, and Zich lost all interest in Greig.\u2018Ok, let me start the finale now.\u2019Zich still had someone left to screw over: the servant, Hans, and\u2014\u2018All the Steelwalls!\u2019They all had despised and looked down on him; Zich didn\u2019t intend to give any of them an easy pass.\u201cIs it over?\u201d\u201cYes, it is over. But since you lost a lot of blood, you should rest for a while!\u201dZich ignored the priest\u2019s words and stood up again.\u201cY-Young master! You can\u2019t abruptly stand up like that\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s fine. I know my body better than anyone else.\u201dZich tuned out the nagging coming from behind him and walked forward.Halt!Zich halted in his steps and arched his neck to see the Count in the upper seats.\u201cI won, Father.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah, I saw.\u201dAs expected, the Count\u2019s response was curt while the Countess\u2019s gaze was piercing. Still, Zich calmly continued, \u201cDidn\u2019t you promise? You said that you would let the winner of this duel succeed the family.\u201dPeople broke into murmurs. They didn\u2019t think that Zich would bring that up first so bluntly. Although rumors about the conditions of the duel had spread, all of that was unofficial.A vein popped out of the Count\u2019s forehead.\u201cStop spouting nonsense! How could a single duel like this decide anything?!\u201dOf course, by using the fact that he had not made the conditions public, the Count was planning to make it seem like the promise had never been made.\u2018Well, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019At the Count\u2019s outcry, Zich still smiled.\u2018What in the world is he thinking?\u2019Trell furrowed his eyebrows.\u2018Why would he mention that out loud here? It won\u2019t do him any good.\u2019Although Zich had shown people a new side to him, they still didn\u2019t have good feelings for Zich. Saying something like this would only gather hostility. For instance, Chris Nunn, whose eyes had sparkled just a moment before, was scowling now.\u2018Has he become short-sighted in his excitement?\u2019If that was the case, Trell would have to adjust his assessment of Zich again and deduct some points. However, the reason for Zich\u2019s words was something that no one, including Trell, could have even thought of.\u201cI knew this would happen.\u201dZich took a ring out from one of his fingers. Then, he threw it high up in the air.Clink! Clink!The ring dropped right onto the seat of honor and rolled in front of the Count and collapsed. Everyone sitting in the upper seats froze in place after checking what the ring was.\u201cYou\u2026 what is the meaning of this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, Father? What else can I mean by throwing the Steelwall ring away?\u201dZich took in a deep breath and yelled loudly.\u201cI, Zich Steelwall, will henceforth give up my right as the heir of Steelwall!\u201dA shock as intense as getting struck by a mace on the back of one\u2019s head waved through the stadium. The Count and the Countess, the knights, bureaucrats, and various retainers, as well as Greg and the priests, looked at Zich with their mouths hanging open.Zich, however, snorted in a refreshing way.\u201cJust because I put up with it\u2014do you see me as some dirt stuck on the bottom of an orc\u2019s foot? I am talking about all of you! How can you all unite to bully one person pettily\u2014did you think that I would continue to put up with it like an idiot?!\u201dVulgar words flowed across the stadium, but people couldn\u2019t say much but stutter.\u201cI am not going to accept a damn family like this!\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you doing!\u201d\u201cAre your ears blocked now that you are growing old, Count? I am saying that I will leave Steelwall!\u201dZich no longer called the Count, Father, and the Count\u2019s cheeks shuddered in anger.\u201cIsn\u2019t this what you wanted? An eyesore is leaving the family with his own feet! Now, you can hand over the family to your lovable younger son.\u201d\u201cYou, you\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou should just tell me bluntly that you have no intention of handing Steelwall over to me. Do you know how surprised I was to see you, the Kingdom\u2019s metal fortress, resort to such cheap tricks?\u201d\u201c\u2026.!\u201dThe Count was so angry that no words came out of his mouth. His wire-like beard twitched.\u201cYou bastaaaaard!\u201dBam!\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201cAhhh!\u201dA powerful current circled the Count. The Countess, Trell, and others who weren\u2019t trained made a commotion.\u201cSuppress your anger, Count!\u201dChris Nunn grabbed the Count, and Tiner went up to the seat of honor to also help restrain the Count.\u201cFine! If that\u2019s what you think, leave at this instant! If you appear in front of me again, I am going to split you into two!\u201d\u201cP-please calm down for now!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry! I don\u2019t have plans to come back here ever again!\u201d\u201cY-young master! You should also calm\u2026!\u201dChris Nunn tried his hardest to fix the situation somehow, but the father and son pair had already crossed a path of no return.Swift!Zich turned around. He walked towards the stadium\u2019s entrance, and everyone\u2019s eyes naturally followed his back. Zich was completely different from the boy they had ignored for so long. Suddenly, Zich turned his head around as if he had just thought of something, and his eyes landed on Hans.\u201cHey, Hans!\u201dHans, who was hanging on the wall, answered in shock, \u201cYes, yes sir!\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201d\u201cYes! Sorry?\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201d\u201cW-where?\u201d\u201cI think I will need at least one servant since I am leaving the family. So, I am going to take you with me.\u201dHans\u2019 face was pale stricken. He knew what kind of horrible things would happen if he followed Zich right now.\u201cT-that\u2026!\u201dBut Zich was too scary for him to refuse outrightly. He couldn\u2019t say this or that and heard a voice from his savior.\u201cWhy would you take Hans? Hans is a servant who serves Steelwall!\u201dIt was the Countess. She growled as if she was talking to the archenemy who murdered her parents. It seemed like Greig\u2019s loss and ruination had input a considerable amount of resentment in her.Hans\u2019 face brightened.\u201cUm, why would you protest against me taking Hans?\u201d\u201cDid you think that I would allow it?!\u201d\u201cThen, it can\u2019t be helped.\u201dBecause Zich backed off much more easily than she expected him to, the Countess was shocked. But that shock quickly turned into horror. Zich pulled out his sword and walked towards where Hans was.\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really. Countess, I am going to finish it quickly, so you don\u2019t have to mind it.\u201dZich changed the way he called the Countess from Mother to Countess back again. Truthfully, she felt relieved to no longer hear that creepy title of Mother from him, but it didn\u2019t make Zich\u2019s behavior any better.\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s nothing! You look like you are about to slice Hans\u2019 neck off!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe Countess was at a loss for words. Hans\u2019 colorless face became even paler, but Zich calmly said his biggest blow.\u201cYes, it\u2019s true that I\u2019m going to slice that servant\u2019s neck off.\u201d\u201cH-have you finally lost your mind?!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean that I have lost my mind? I am completely normal. Countess, did you forget why I started the duel in the first place?\u201dByner and Hans claimed that they didn\u2019t offend Zich while Zich swore that they did. Since Zich had won the duel, Zich\u2019s claim would be accepted as the truth.\u201cSince Byner is a knight, I am sure that Steelwall will give him a fitting punishment, but it will be a different story for Hans. Even if I gave up the title, that guy insulted me when I was the Steelwall\u2019s rightful heir. With my win, it has been recognized that he insulted me, and I now have authority over his life and death.\u201dThe Countess finally realized the severity of the situation and fell into great shock.\u201cC-count!\u201dThe Count was the only one left to rely on.The Countess quickly hung onto the Count. After Zich gave up his right to succeed, the gap between the father and son deepened beyond repair, so she thought the Count would do something to fix the situation.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, the Count didn\u2019t say anything. His face looked like he wanted to yell at his men to drag Zich out, but unfortunately, Zich was right. If there were fewer eyes on them, things might have been different, but the Count couldn\u2019t break rules in front of so many important figures.Increasing the size of this duel was backfiring on him.Swift!\u201cEh, ehh!\u201dHans cried out as the black sword edged closer to the bottom of his neck. It was a terrible experience to have a sword coated in blackish-red blood pushed right into his neck.\u201cHey, Hans. Listen to me carefully. Even though you dared to look down on me and disrespect me, I will give you a choice.\u201dZich stretched out his thumb and middle finger and showed them to Hans.\u201cYou have two choices: one is to die here right now with your head rolling. The other is to follow me as my servant. How is it? Which one are you going to choose?\u201dZich\u2019s tone sounded benevolent, but he was one-sidedly pressuring Hans. Hans darted his eyes and stared at the Countess. He saw the Countess grab the ends of the Count\u2019s garment and plead, but the Count was still silent.At that moment, Hans realized that the Countess, who was his strong and solid backing, didn\u2019t have the power to get him out of this situation.\u201cFo\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI will follow you. I will follow you, young master.\u201dTiny tear droplets trickled down from his eyes, and Hans whimpered. He looked like a cow being dragged off to a slaughterhouse. It was a tearful scene, but it made Zich smirk.\u201cThat\u2019s a smart decision.\u201dZich took back his sword from Hans\u2019 neck, but Hans\u2019 expression didn\u2019t become brighter. He couldn\u2019t fathom how dark and terrible his life in the future would be.\u201cGet up. We have to leave.\u201d\u201cWh-what? Right now?\u201d\u201cIs there a need to hesitate? It\u2019s my first step out of the nest into the world. You have to do things like this the moment you make the decision!\u201d\u201cT-that\u2026!\u201dZich grabbed Hans by the collar and pulled him into the stadium. Then, he half-dragged him out of the entrance.Without even looking around, Zich could feel stares on his back. The Count was still huffing, the Countess was holding onto the edges of his clothes while watching Hans. Tiner and Chris Nunn were urgently running after Zich, and finally, Greig, whose wounds were all healed, sat on the ground and blankly stared as Zich disappeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTrell scowled after seeing the entrance that Zich had disappeared out of.\u2018What is it? What is he thinking?\u2019Trell thought that Zich had planned everything to create a scenario that would increase his chances of becoming the Count\u2019s heir. But that thought lost credibility the instant that Zich threw away his right as the heir.\u201cWhat does Sir Zich want to do exactly?\u201dChris Nunn, who had been restraining the Count, seemed to have the same thought as Trell as he asked this question quietly. Fortunately, the Count had calmed down by then.\u201cI don\u2019t know. He made the situation more advantageous to him in every way and then kicked it all away.\u201dChris Nunn clicked his tongue.\u201cIs he really planning to leave?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cMaybe he decided on it at the spur of the moment. In his youth\u2026\u201dChris Nunn seemed to have thought that Zich would not truly leave the family.\u201cBut I am sure of this. Since he has given up his right as heir in front of so many people, Greig will become the heir for sure.\u201dTrell let out an uncontrollable burst of laughter. From what he knew, Chris Nunn was among those who supported Greig. He should be happy about the situation, but Chris Nunn couldn\u2019t hide the deep sense of regret in his voice.\u2018No, it\u2019s not only Chris Nunn.\u2019A lot of people probably felt the same way. Truthfully, Trell couldn\u2019t hide his feelings of regret and stared at Greig who had collapsed onto the ground.\u2018He is a bit lacking, but we have no choice but to expect Greig to\u2014!\u2019Whish!\u201cW-what are you doing?\u201d Chris Nunn asked in surprise, but Trell couldn\u2019t answer.\u2018Lacking? I just thought that, right?\u2019Steelwall\u2019s image of Greig was the \u2018capable heir,\u2019 but it was different now. After losing to Zich\u2019s schemes and strength, Greig\u2019s image had greatly diminished. It was enough to make Trell unconsciously think that Greig was a bit lacking.\u2018People will continue to compare them. Since they all saw how talented Zich is\u2014from now on, whenever Greig seems a bit lacking, they will see him in a new light.\u2019And that would create a feud in Steelwall.\u2018It may not be significant, but it could become a bigger issue than I imagined.\u2019Fortunately, Greig had many supporters.\u2018Still, those who are neutral and the very few Zich supporters will raise their concern, especially since the talented eldest son was harassed into leaving.\u2019It was acceptable up to this point because Greig was the heir and he had above-average skills. If Greig showed skills that were above average, the concerns wouldn\u2019t just evaporate into thin air, but they wouldn\u2019t spread outside of the family either.\u2018But what if Sir Greig fails to be like his old self?\u2019Like a deranged person, Greig was absent-mindedly staring at the place where Zich had disappeared. This incident could be a moment of shock for him, and Greig could learn and progress from this experience.\u2018But what if he never shakes off the shock?\u2019If one factor in the shocking process of the duel, the stern gazes that would continue to follow him after his loss, and how Greig had looked down on Zich all his life, there was a good chance that Greig would never pull himself from his shock.And if that happened\u2026\u2018With young master Zich\u2019s renouncement, if Sir Greig also becomes ruined, Steelwall will not be able to survive.\u2019When Trell thought that far, his back seemed to ache; he felt like he began to understand the meaning behind Zich\u2019s incomprehensible behavior.\u2018Young Master Zich did that not for the Steelwall\u2019s heir. It was all for revenge!\u2019If Trell\u2019s worries became a reality, Steelwall would not only falter\u2014 it would collapse.\u201cWhat is the problem, butler?\u201d\u201cI think he really left.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cI mean that the young master, Zich, really left.\u201dHe left Steelwall while leaving behind a massive bomb. Trell looked away from Chris Nunn\u2019s surprised gaze and bit his lips.* * *\u201cHaa! I feel so~ refreshed~!\u201dZich shouted while untying the bandages on his body. His fresh voice seemed to release the stress of everyone who heard him. However, Hans looked like a convict on death row, heading to the gallows closely behind him.Zich didn\u2019t have a particular reason for bringing Hans.\u2018It will be comfortable to have a luggage carrier while traveling alone. I\u2019ve forgiven the guy who defied me with just some labor\u2014this is already too kind.\u2019Surprisingly, Zich was interpreting what Glen Zenard had told him before he died\u2014\u2018If you are born again, I hope you will be someone who does good!\u2019 in his own way.\u201cAre you really leaving Steelwall?\u201dHans\u2019 lips twitched after hesitating whether he should speak or not.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cC-can you think about it again? Even if you go back now, the Count will not talk to you harshly. Considering your talent, won\u2019t it be easy for you to succeed the family\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dHans looked like he was about to cry.\u201cAnyways, what is your relationship with the Countess? It didn\u2019t look normal.\u201dEven if the Countess responded more sensitively to the situation because it involved Zich, the way she treated Hans was not like the way she treated the other servants.\u201cM-my grandmother was madam\u2019s nanny.\u201d\u201cAh, no wonder.\u201dThat must have been why she was so defensive about Hans.\u2018I snatched her precious servant away, so she must be suffering a bit.\u2019A smile naturally crept up Zich\u2019s face. And because it seemed like he could talk to Zich to some degree, Hans asked, \u201cCould I perhaps ask about your future plans? Such as your destination or the goals that you want to achieve\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any specific plans. I am thinking about wandering around the world and doing good deeds\u2014that\u2019s all.\u201d\u2018Since I, the Demon Lord of Strength, lost in a head-to-head battle, I should do what that Glen guy told me to do.\u2019Although Glen was a jerk, he was still the hero who had defeated Zich, so this was Zich\u2019s way of showing Glen some respect.\u201cYou are going to do good deeds?\u201d\u201cOf course! Isn\u2019t a man supposed to live while doing good work? After doing a good deed at Steelwall, it feels really rewarding.\u201d\u2018Has he really gone crazy?\u2019Hans\u2019 expression seemed to show his disbelief intensely.Thankfully, he didn\u2019t blurt out whatever was on his mind like he had done in the past, but he couldn\u2019t agree that Zich had done a good deed even if his mouth was ripped open.\u2018All he did was turn the Count\u2019s residence upside down.\u2019Hans couldn\u2019t think as deeply as Trell, but he at least knew that Zich had not done a single good deed; but surprisingly, Zich was sincere. Moreover, Zich had surprisingly acted in good faith.\u2018Since Greig was left in a state like that as the next pivotal center of Steelwall, he will be in a state of shock for a while. However, if he gets past the shock and progresses to the next level, he can be an even stronger Count.\u2019Greig couldn\u2019t compare to the ultimate genius Zich, but he also had talent. If Zich had just left him alone, Greig would\u2019ve still been a splendid Count, so Zich just sounded like he was giving excuses. But it was different this time.\u2018Steelwall can\u2019t go on like this. If Greig grows up well protected, carefully and bit by bit, Steelwall\u2019s future will not change.\u2019And according to what Zich knew, Steelwall would collapse into ruins in the near future\u2014very thoroughly too, where even a servant\u2019s family wouldn\u2019t survive.He didn\u2019t know the reason for their fall. He only found out when he asked one of his subordinates to see how Steelwall was doing out of a moment of fickleness. After that, he lost interest because Zich thought the Steelwall family was completely unrelated to him.\u2018If Greig falls like that, it will increase the likelihood of the Steelwall family\u2019s collapse. But they are already destined to ruin, so\u2026\u2019He had already lost all love for that family. Creating an opportunity for them to change was already a tremendous act of kindness.\u201cUm, young master.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not young master. Call me Sir Zich from now on.\u201dSince they left the Count\u2019s residence, there was no need for Hans to call Zich \u2018young master.\u2019\u201cSir Zich, should we prepare before going? Is it really alright for us to go without anything, sir?\u201dThe only things that Zich possessed were a bloody training sword and a luxurious cloth that was ripped into two. Hans only had the clothes that he was wearing. Both of them didn\u2019t even have two coins to rub against each other.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have something prepared.\u201d\u201cI-I understand, sir.\u201dHans forced out a reply, but his despair seemed to deepen to another level.\u2018If he has made preparations, then that means he is really determined!\u2019Hans\u2019 hope of returning to the Count\u2019s residence diminished.\u201cI am just saying this for extra caution, but don\u2019t even dream of running away. As you saw before, the Steelwall family is a military family. Since I brought you out after winning a duel, they won\u2019t accept you back even if you escape. You could escape elsewhere, but do you think you can live in some other place after living a protected life in the Count\u2019s residence this entire time?\u201dHans tugged his hair. He had to admit that he was inside the palm of Zich\u2019s hands.They both walked through the city. In contrast to the stadium that had fallen into panic, it was peaceful outside. However, everyone was staring at them. They were wary after seeing Zich covered in blood with his ripped clothes. But Zich didn\u2019t pay them any attention and continued to walk.\u2018This place is!\u2019Previously anxious about his foggy future, Hans opened his eyes wide. They arrived at a temple that was a bit far off from the city center, but it wasn\u2019t just any temple.\u2018Isn\u2019t this where the Count and his family\u2019s ancestors are resting?\u2019Like Hans thought, this was the public cemetery for the Steelwall family.\u2018W-what did we come here for, sir?\u201d\u201cI thought I should see my mother before I leave.\u201dZich\u2019s voice, which had been bright all along, became a bit lower.\u201cBy your mother, sir, do you mean the previous Countess, sir?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dZich went inside the temple.\u201cWelcome, sir.\u201dPriests who managed the temple gathered their hands to greet him. They were taken back by the state Zich was in for a moment but recovered immediately.\u201cI came to get back what I entrusted.\u201dThe priest commanded the lower-ranking priests around him. After a moment, a lower-ranking priest came back with two huge bags.\u201cHere they are.\u201dZich hung the small bag around his shoulders and laid the other bag down in front of Hans.\u201cCarry it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, sir.\u201dHans had no choice; he quietly slung the bag over his body. It was quite heavy.\u201cI\u2019m going to see my mother for a bit.\u201d\u201cI understand. Please follow me.\u201dZich followed the priest, but he asked for their understanding and changed into clean clothes before he continued.The priest guided Zich to the insides of the temple. Tombstones tightly filled the wide, dirt ground from spot to spot, and the priest guided Zich to one of the tombstones. Among the many tombstones, this one looked the newest.[Sara Steelwall]The inscriptions on the tombstone stated that the owner of the grave was the original owner of the Countess\u2019s seat and was Zich\u2019s birth mother.Zich got lost in his sentimentality.\u2018I guess she is the one who gave birth to me.\u2019Zich had pushed thoughts about his mother to the back of his mind since his regression because he had been occupied by other matters such as grasping his immediate situation, understanding his relationship with the Count, and thinking of ways to screw Steelwall over.Zich tried to recollect thoughts about his mother. He didn\u2019t remember well since it happened a long time ago, but after trying harder, he began to recall memories about his mother bit by bit.The beautiful memories of his mother who was pitifully pushed away by her husband and filled with worries about her son\u2026[How can you still not remember this one thing?!]Zich was instantly taken out of his memories. No, that wasn\u2019t even a memory.\u2018What was that?\u2019It felt like he had just opened Pandora\u2019s box; sweat, which he hadn\u2019t even shed in battle, began to wet his back.Carefully, Zich tried to recollect memories about his mother again.[How are you going to be the Count if you are so weak! What will be your use?!]The only things he could remember were the scolding and contempt. Up until this point, it was possible to think that his mother was just strict\u2014although she had gone overboard. However, Zich remembered more.[What the hell is this?! Didn\u2019t I always tell you to maintain cleanliness in the Count\u2019s residence! Are you ignoring my commands!]He recalled the sight of her pointing fingers and nagging servants at a bit of dust left on the window.[Can all of you knights learn some manners?!]She nagged at the knights for acting rude when they couldn\u2019t help but be a bit rough as the forefront of the kingdom.[Are you telling me that I, the Countess, should live with such a low allowance!]Zich saw his mother raise her voice at the butler who managed the Count\u2019s household.[How could you, a lowly wench who swayed the Count with your beauty alone, act like my equal?!]He had seen his mother bully the second wife at that time, Greig\u2019s mother, Florel Steelwall, with lowly tricks.[I guess you can\u2019t betray your lowly birth!]He recollected the scene of his mother yelling at Greig when he was only a child.[Because you ignore me, other people look down on me!]His mother seemed to show no mercy even to the Count.\u2018\u2026Um.\u2019Even Zich was surprised by these memories. He placed his hand on his head and tried to organize his thoughts.\u2018That\u2019s right. Mother was always that kind of person.\u2019The reason why everyone outcasted Zich, including the Count, was because of his mother. Technically, everything that Zich mentioned was what his mother, Sara Steelwall had done; but humans were not creatures who acted only on logic.Furthermore, in comparison to Sara Steelwall, the second wife, Florel Steelwall was basically an angel. She treated Zich harshly, but that was only because Zich was Sara\u2019s son and Greig\u2019s rival; to everyone else, she was quite caring and kind. That was why everyone leaned in favor of Florel and Greig.\u2018Many people must have been relieved that my mother died so early.\u2019Maybe it was because of her nasty temper that she died prematurely. Then, Florel Steelwall took her place as the Countess, and Zich became a lasting eyesore to the Count.\u201cHey, Hans.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\u201cWhat do you think about my mother?\u201d\u201cM-madam? Of course she is a good person, sir!\u201dHans made a subservient smile, but his shaking pupils seemed to reveal his true feelings.\u2018Wait a moment. Wasn\u2019t there a young servant that my mother used to especially torment?\u2019The servant was the grandson of the current Countess\u2019s nanny.\u2018It was him.\u2019The way Zich looked at Hans changed.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cGive me the bag.\u201dZich snatched that bag Hans was carrying and took out some items. They were heavy items that Zich had thrown in the bag to screw with Hans. He placed some of these items into his bag and gave the bag back to Hans.Zich turned away from Hans\u2019 blinking eyes and stared at an unfamiliar view in front of him: it was where the Steelwall palace was. Zich had no reason to be sorry to the Count\u2019s family. But if he thought about how severe his mother\u2019s actions had been, he couldn\u2019t help but sympathize with them.\u201cUm\u2026\u201dZich scratched his head and thought in his mind what no one in Steelwall could hear.\u2018If something happens in the future, I will help.\u2019He thought that it wouldn\u2019t be bad to lend a helping hand to the family he had once been part of.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter finding out the reason for his harsh treatment, Zich began to feel a small amount of guilt and sympathy. However, it ended there.\u2018I can\u2019t change what has already happened. Like I thought, I can just help them later.\u2019Zich coolly passed on dealing with the aftermath of his doings to the rest of the family and began preparing for his journey. The first thing he had to do was figure out what to pack.\u2018Even if I prepare, I can\u2019t get everything I need in Steelwall anyways.\u2019But there was nothing to worry about.\u2018If I\u2019m missing something, I can buy it on the way.\u2019Even if Zich was basically an abandoned child, it didn\u2019t change the fact that he was the first son of the Steelwall family. He had a certain amount of savings and inheritance that he could easily secure. The first thing he did was go to a pawn shop and sell the many gems he possessed. He was able to obtain a large sum from this, and with the money in his pockets, he headed towards the armory shop.\u2018As expected of an armory shop in the capital\u2014it\u2019s enormous.\u2019A wooden sign with a drawing of a sword and shield shook with the wind. No matter what country or what type of leader they were, they all hated armed commoners. People in power were afraid that armed commoners would point their swords against them. However, the forest was crawling with monsters, and the commoners had no choice but to arm themselves.Even if they were weak or were unable to fight, they had to request professionals to fight for them. For this reason, armory shops were prolific in the Kingdom.\u2018Of course, there is a clear difference in the number and quality of supplies from store tostore, but this is true for any goods.\u2019Zich opened the store\u2019s door and went in. Numerous weapons and shields hung on the walls, and weapons filled up the showcase from back to back.\u201cWelcome!\u201dThe store owner enthusiastically welcomed Zich and Hans inside. Since it was common for armory shops to have many rough customers, store owners often acted rough, but this place seemed to have at least some sort of customer service.\u201cIs there an item you are looking for\u2026?!\u201dZich stopped the store owner who was coming closer and pulled out a sword next to him. The sunlight seeped through the window and sharply reflected off the sword.Ting!Zich flicked his fingers on the sword a few times.\u2018The sound is okay.\u2019Then, he tried swinging the sword.Swish!He made a clean half-circle with the sword. Standing awkwardly in the corner with his shoulders hunched, Hans felt a shiver run down his back.\u2018He really is a genius in sword fighting.\u2019When Hans saw Zich and Greig fight, he thought Zich\u2019s sword fighting skills were extraordinary.But it was even more impressive than what Hans had thought. Even from a distance, Hans could feel the murderous intent from Zich\u2019s sword.\u2018The balance is alright.\u2019Zich was satisfied with the sword. Of course, this sword could not compare to the weapons he had when he was the Demon Lord. Quality-wise, this sword was even worse than the one he had brought from Steelwall.\u2018This is good enough.\u2019Zich decided to buy the sword if it was not too expensive. Then, he put back the sword he took out and dragged Hans to where the short swords were.\u2018These are also pretty okay.\u2019Zich picked out a suitable short sword and passed it onto Hans after testing it out.\u201cWhy would you give me this, sir\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s yours from now on\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWell, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the future, so it\u2019s good for you to have a weapon. I will be protecting you in general, but we should also prepare for the worst-case scenario.\u201d\u201cT-Then wouldn\u2019t a different type of sword be better, sir?\u201dHans\u2019 eyes shifted over to where the long swords were. From the outside, long swordslooked stronger than short swords. Zich let out a chuckle and lightly hit Hans\u2019 back.\u201cAnd will you be able to handle it? Before you pierce your enemies, you\u2019re going to cut yourhands. You should be satisfied with this before I give you a club. No, would a club actually be better?\u201dHans accepted the short sword with no further complaints. A short sword was much better than a club.\u201cSir Zich, what about you?\u201d\u201cI have this.\u201dZich tapped the sword on his waist. Since it was a sword from Steelwall, the quality was better than most swords. After he bought a spare sword and a sword to do menial tasks for himself and Hans, he shifted his attention towards the armor. Like a scarecrow, several pieces of armor hung on a wooden pole. Most of the armor was made out of thick cloth or fur and had wood or metal on the body\u2019s vital areas. Zich whole-heartedly laughed at Hans\u2019 disappointed eyes.\u201cI bet you are wondering why there is no plate armor\u2026and why we are in such a cheap-assstore like this.\u201d\u201cWh-what? No, of course not, sir!\u201dHans fervently denied Zich\u2019s claims, but his nervous hiccups betrayed him. The store owner, who had quietly been watching Zich assess the weapons in his store with great expertise, looked at Hans with disappointment. The store owner didn\u2019t look angry, but he also seemed to think that Hans was pathetically na\u00efve.\u201cEven though being armed is a necessity in this world, metal plate armor is ridiculouslyexpensive. If a store like this actually sold metal plate armor, the owner would be out of his mind.\u201dThe store owner nodded in agreement.\u201cTry wearing this first.\u201dZich threw leather armor at Hans. The armor was tied with a string in the back and had metal plates on the chest and joint areas to increase defense. Hans grabbed the armor, but he hesitated. As a servant who did house chores, there was no way he knew how to put an armor on.\u201cI will put it on for you.\u201dThe store owner offered his help.\u201cMemorize the steps.\u201dFollowing Zich\u2019s order, Hans opened his eyes wide to remember. He watched the store owner put the armor on him and tried to memorize each step. Since the store owner was experienced, it did not take long for him to finish. Hans looked down at his armored body in fascination.Likewise, Zich put on a similar leather armor as Hans. However, unlike Hans, he was skillful atputting on the armor. It was fascinating for Hans to watch Zich who was now checking the armor out with different movements.\u201cWhere did you learn these types of things, Sir Zich?\u201d\u201cHere and there.\u201dIt was not a satisfactory answer, but Hans could not ask further.After making sure that the armor did not inhibit his movements by tightly holding onto his fistsfor the last time, Zich shouted, \u201cOkay, all set! Give me the check!\u201d* * *After buying basic weaponry, Zich began to prepare for other things he needed on his journey. He packed items such as blankets, flint for outdoor camping, and foods like jerky. After they finished purchasing all the necessary items, Hans and Zich looked like travelers. Then, they went outside the walls that surrounded Steelwall\u2019s capital, Violsa.As they went out, Hans and Zich\u2019s expressions directly contrasted each other. Zich was in a good mood and hummed\u2014even his footsteps were light and easy. On the other hand, Hans\u2019 expression was dark and gloomy.\u201cSir, have you decided on your destination?\u201dThey had no specific plans, and Hans was unable to see his future in this journey, but hewanted to know at least where they were heading.\u201cPorti.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t Porti a city in our neighbor\u2019s territory, sir?\u201d\u201cYeah. I want to get out of this territory first. So, I\u2019m going to go to the nearest region, which isPorti and see how things go from there. \u201cLike before, Zich seemed to be moving without plans, but it wasn\u2019t like he had no plans at all.\u2018Should I try to find those guys?\u2019Before he regressed, Zich had four retainers. As expected of retainers of the Demon Lord, they were all crazy bastards, but there were a few people Zich considered as his comrades. Before he regressed, they all died earlier to Glen Zenard, but they were all probably alive at this point in time.Of course, they were no longer the subordinates he knew.\u2018But I still want to check on how they are doing.\u2019Moreover, from what Zich knew, his underlings also had their fair share of sufferings and troubles.\u2018As I travel around, I will look for them if I remember. And if they are in trouble, I can help them.\u2019Hans looked up at the sky. In contrast to what he was feeling, the sky was overwhelmingly bright and blue. It was hard to move his feet forward; it felt like something was grabbing his ankles and not letting go.\u2018\u2026But I still have to go.\u2019Hans did not know what would happen if he slowed down Zich. Contrary to his expectations, Zich was treating him very well. However, this still didn\u2019t mean that Hans felt comfortable around Zich. Hans fixed the position of the bag he was holding and followed Zich from behind.\u2018At least I should be thankful that our next destination is a city.\u2019Although he spent all of his life in Steelwall, even Hans knew about Portia\u2014that was how famous and bustling the city was. Hans felt reassured to find out their first location and thought that it would be more comfortable to go to a famous city than to go to a random, strange who-knows-where place.But only after a half of a day since their departure from Violsa, Hans realized that he had been too na\u00efve.\u201cSir Z-Zich? Are we straying from the path?\u201dHans, who had been quietly following Zich, spoke while trembling after Zich began to stray off.\u201cI know.\u201dBut Zich\u2019s footsteps did not stop.\u201cIsn\u2019t that not the path, sir?\u201d\u201cI told you, I know.\u201dInsecurity began to rise in Hans\u2019 heart slowly. Hans desperately wished that Zich was straying away from the path for a moment to pee or something like that. And like usual wishes that arose in moments of insecurity, it seemed his wish would not come true.\u201cIs there a reason why we need to follow the path and go around and around? If we go straight like this, we can reach Portia in half the time.\u201dListening to him plainly, Zich was right. However, as Hans looked at the bright green anddensely packed forest, he could not agree with Zich\u2019s comments.\u201cE-even if the distance is longer, I think it will take a shorter amount of time if we follow the path, sir.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? Let\u2019s go.\u201dAnd that was all there was from Zich. Hans knew Zich would never listen to him, so like a cowdragged into a slaughterhouse, he pulled his body forward.* * *There were many reasons why people followed a path, but the main reason was safety. If they strayed from the trail, travelers could meet beasts that could kill ordinary people with a single bite and other dangers. However, if someone interviewed a hundred people about what they thought was the most dangerous thing outside of the path, all hundred would say monsters.Monsters had strong physical strength; some possessed magical abilities, and a few even had special abilities. They were currently the biggest threat to humanity\u2019s survival.On the bright side, humans worked hard to expel monsters from areas where humans normally lived, so there were very few monsters in largely populated areas. Even Hans had never seen a monster before. Once, he saw a monster from far away when the knights had brought monster corpses to the castle. However, despite all of this, if people strayed even a little bit off the path, they could be attacked by many monsters lurking around.So, it was completely expected when Zich and Hans soon met some monsters.\u201cSir Z-Zich! T-th-there\u2026!\u201d\u201cStop being so loud. Is this your first time seeing a monster?\u201dHans\u2019 legs trembled in shock, while Zich calmly looked on.Krrrgh!A bright yellow being that almost looked like a patient with its deep yellow eyes yelled ferociously at them.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a goblin.\u201d\u201cA-a goblin, sir?\u201dCuriosity was part of human nature, and Hans could not help but ask despite his fear.The goblin was barely a meter tall. It wore nothing, and its only form of weapon was a wooden stick that was crudely shaped into a bludgeon. To be honest, the goblin didn\u2019t look frightening at all.\u2018I-Is it actually not a big deal at all?\u2019Even in the heroic novels that Hans read, goblins were not depicted as strong monsters. They merely came out as weak footmen for mighty demons.As a result, Hans began to gain confidence.\u2018I-I think I might be able to beat a monster of that level.\u2019Hans\u2019 hands began to move towards the short sword on his waist.\u201cWhy, you think you can beat a goblin?\u201d\u201cYes? N-no, it is not like that, sir.\u201dHans felt overwhelmed whenever he interacted with Zich, so he denied everything Zich said. Zich might say that Hans did not know his place and scold him again.However, Zich gave Hans a completely unexpected response.\u201cYou want to try fighting him?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYeah, who else but you?\u201dWith Zich\u2019s words, Hans felt his heart beating fiercely from fear and nervousness. Fighting with agoblin was a real-life experience with his life on the line. On the other hand, Hans wanted to try listening to his confidence.\u2018It\u2019s just a goblin. Wouldn\u2019t it be alright with Sir Zich? If I want to continue traveling, it will be good for me to gain combat experience early on.\u2019And who knew what would happen in the future? Maybe the tale of \u2018The Great Hero Hans\u2019 would begin from this fight.Hans\u2019 thoughts were na\u00efve and childish, but it was also expected from someone who was young and had just left his house.\u201cI will try, sir.\u201dHans pulled out his sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Despite everything, he was a Steelwall servant, and he had heard a thing or two about fighting.Urggh!The goblin made a threatening glare and shook his wooden club.\u2018At most, the monster\u2019s weapon is a wooden club.\u2019Even though Hans didn\u2019t have much faith in his sword before, it began to feel trustworthy to him. After all, although his sword looked modest, it was made out of fine iron.\u2018I can win!\u2019Hans didn\u2019t hide the rising confidence on his face and slowly approached the goblin.Ehhhhhhhhh!The goblin raised a tree branch with all of its strength and ran towards Hans.\u201cHuh, huh?\u201dHans made a shocked noise. In his head, many scenarios were already playing inside his head: if the goblin attacked him like this, he would respond like that, and so on. But in the end, they were the delusions of a beginner who had never learned sword fighting. As the goblin suddenly ran towards him, all Hans could do was swing his sword around.Slam!\u201cAhhh!\u201dBoth of his arms bounced off with the sword. The center of his body lost its balance, and his body shook. It was unsightly.\u201cOhh?\u201dHowever, Zich looked pleasantly surprised while watching the battle from a distance.\u2018A complete newbie was able to block a monster\u2019s attack.\u2019That was already praiseworthy, but what happened next was more notable.\u2018He also didn\u2019t let go of his sword.\u2019Blood dripped out of Hans\u2019 hand as he gripped his sword. His hands were torn\u2014even though he was a complete newb, he didn\u2019t let go of his sword even when he received an attack strong enough to tear his hand off.\u2018Is he proving that he is from Steelwall after all? Or is it his personal talent?\u2019It didn\u2019t matter either way.Fling!The goblin swung his club again, and Hans was able to avoid it, but his stance broke. He blocked the next attack with his sword.\u2018Why is this guy so strong! It\u2019s so fast too!\u2019The monster was only a meter tall at most, but each of its strikes carried immense strength. Contrary to Hans\u2019 wishful thoughts, it wasn\u2019t a monster who\u2019d break from the main character\u2019s first touch.\u201cWhaaaaaaaa!\u201dAt the extreme threat of danger, Hans\u2019 body moved by itself. Letting out a shock or scream, Hans confronted the goblin again.Hans attacked with his gleaming eyes, and the goblin\u2019s club slammed into Hans\u2019 body a couple of times. Hans received many hits, but because of his armor and excitement, he couldn\u2019t feel the pain. Then, before he realized it, Hans\u2019 sword struck the goblin\u2019s head, deep enough for the attack to be fatal.The goblin fell with a death cry, and Hans also collapsed to the ground.\u2018He won?\u2019In surprise, Zich stared at Hans who was trembling on the ground.\u2018I didn\u2019t think that he would really win.\u2019Although a goblin was a weak monster, it was still a monster; Zich didn\u2019t think an ordinary servant, especially one that had grown carefully and well under the Countess\u2019 care, would win.Zich wanted Hans to know how dangerous a monster could be and assess Hans\u2019 fighting abilities. He was surprised to see that Hans was more talented in battle than he expected.\u201cWell, good job.\u201dAs Hans stared at the ground absent-mindedly, Zich tapped on Hans\u2019 shoulder.\u201cAh, thank y\u2026 ah!\u201dHans screamed. After his excitement died down, he began to feel pain. Then, over his squirming body, a liquid substance dropped onto him, drip by drip, and his pain began to subside.\u201cA potion?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my special service. This is the last time I am offering it, so don\u2019t expect it again.\u201dZich still possessed plenty of potions that he had taken from the Count\u2019s residence, but because potions were unbelievably expensive, Zich didn\u2019t want to waste them.Hans\u2019 wounds healed completely.\u201cHow do you feel after dealing with a monster for the first time? You don\u2019t believe that you can\u2026 at least handle a goblin, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026You knew, sir?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s obvious what a guy like you will think\u2014that\u2019s why I asked. It\u2019s more important to experience how dangerous a monster is first-hand. You were lucky. Goblins usually travel ingroups, and it\u2019s rare to see one wandering around by itself.\u201dZich faced the front.\u201cHowever, it seems like it didn\u2019t completely fall behind the herd.\u201dThe sound of grass swaying in the wind became a bit rougher. Goblins soon appeared and surrounded Hans and Zich. There were at least ten of them.\u201cThey used a bait with their cruddy heads?\u201dThe fact that they didn\u2019t seem to care that one of their companions had died seemed to show that they were monsters without an ounce of humanity.\u201cS-sir Zich? Isn\u2019t this a bit of a dangerous situation?\u201dHans trembled since he even struggled to fight one.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve prepared enough.\u201dZich moved his left hand. The items inside his hand collided against each other and clattered.\u201cIsn\u2019t that a stone? What are you\u2026?\u201dHans couldn\u2019t even finish his question. Zich placed one of the stones in his left hand and secured it on his middle finger with his thumb as if he was going to flick it.Swish!He stretched out his middle finger and pushed the stone out. It was a childish gesture, but if a person at Zich\u2019s level did it, the result was different. The stone flew out and pierced the center of one of the goblin\u2019s foreheads.Push!A bright, red flower bloomed. As if a huge hammer struck it, the goblin\u2019s head exploded. Zich continued to flick the stones.Swish! Swish!Puck! Puck!Whenever Zich flicked his finger, a loud sound rang out and a head exploded. It happened instantly. The monsters didn\u2019t even have the chance to respond, escape, or run. It didn\u2019t take long for the group of goblins to be wiped out.\u201c\u2026What did you do?\u201dHans was usually cautious when dealing with Zich, but this time, he felt too shocked to be careful. Without even lifting his feet off the ground, Zich defeated the goblins that Hans had struggled to beat.\u201cYou saw it. All I did was flick some stones around.\u201dZich threw his leftover stones onto the ground.\u201cI don\u2019t have a reason to pull out my sword for a goblin. This is enough.\u201dHans looked up to Zich with a vague look.\u2018I thought he was strong, but he\u2019s at the level to defeat monsters with just stones?\u2019Had Zich become stronger in that short amount of time, or was any skilled person able to do this much? But Hans didn\u2019t have more time to think.\u201cGet up quickly. Since I poured the potion on you, you can move, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, sir.\u201dHans didn\u2019t want to get up, but he forced himself.\u201cLet\u2019s start walking again.\u201dZich and Hans began to retread the mountain\u2019s wilderness.* * *After that, the two met more monsters. Most of the monsters\u2019 heads exploded at the stones that Zich jokingly flicked, and for those that didn\u2019t die against stones, Zich easily cut them apart with his sword. Hans watched the whole scene as he trembled and vowed to never defy Zich ever again.After finishing off a couple of roaming orcs, Zich got a clump of grass leaves and wiped the blood off his sword.\u2018As expected, quite a lot of monsters come out once you go in this deep.\u2019Since these monsters lived deep inside areas where no humans lived, one could say that they were harmless.\u2018But can there be a monster that is harmless against humans?\u2019There wasn\u2019t a harmless one among monsters; it was preferable to kill off all of the ones in sight.\u2018It won\u2019t be much help, but it\u2019s good to weed them out.\u2019This was the reason why Zich had left a perfectly good road to walk through the mountain\u2019s wilderness. Another reason was to show Hans how difficult travelling could be, and another one was\u2026\u2018Well, this will probably be of some help.\u2019He helped Steelwall by weeding out many of the monsters roaming around their residence. But Zich had no intention to help them beyond that, and there was no way that those in Steelwall would learn of his deed. This was all for his self-satisfaction; it was to uproot the tiniest seed of guilt that he had in his heart.\u2018This is the end. I can help Steelwall according to their situation later on. Yeah, I promised to be a good person, so I should at least do this much. Didn\u2019t I become too good?\u2019If Hans heard Zich\u2019s mind, he might have screamed at the absurdity of Zich\u2019s words.Zich continued meeting monsters as he walked through the rough path. It had been a long time since Zich advanced straight without many thoughts. It made him nostalgic about his past, but on the other hand, Hans felt like he was taking his first steps to a never-ending path of suffering.Even though his muscles ached, Hans leaned on his uncomfortable luggage for comfort in fear that a monster could pop out any moment. Then, when he saw the road in front of him, Hans felt like bursting into tears; it was over now.\u201cThe sun is setting. Let\u2019s sleep here today.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dHans answered Zich\u2019s command with great enthusiasm. They were still sleeping in the open, but Hans was thrilled that he could at least sleep near a road.Hans prepared their sleeping area faster than he would have usually, but he still had many awkward movements. In the end, Zich prepared most of the sleeping area; of course, this was only for now, and Zich planned to make Hans do this task after he became more skilled in it.Crack! Crack! Crack!Wood pieces locked inside the fiery blaze fueled the fire\u2019s flames with their faint sounds. After lighting up the fire, Zich and Hans ate their meals. In comparison to the forest that was covered by thick trees, the area around the road was open. They could see the stars in the night sky.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, sir!\u201d\u201cAre you tired?\u201dAt Zich\u2019s sudden question, Hans wondered how he should answer. Of course, he was tired, but he thought a fist would come flying in his direction if he answered honestly.\u201cI\u2019m fine, sir.\u201d\u201cReally? Then, is it alright for us to continue going this way\u2026?\u201d\u201cActually, it\u2019s a bit tiring, sir!\u201dHans shouted out of reflex, and his eyes began to roll. He lowered his neck and flinched as if a punch was coming at his stomach. Zich laughed out loud at how funny that was. Hans\u2019 face reddened, but he felt relieved that the mood had not turned violent.\u201cYou little shit. Don\u2019t worry. We are only going to travel this way until we get out of Steelwall territory.\u201d\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t it still a long way off from leaving Steelwall, sir?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. So, we are only going to supply our goods in this town and go back inside the mountain again.\u201dHans couldn\u2019t help but worry. Zich laughed at how Hans visibly crumbled inside without a sound.Clip! Clop!Suddenly, they heard horse hooves from afar. Zich and Hans both stared at where the sound came from, and from a distance, a dim light slowly approached them.\u201cWho is it during this time? A merchant?\u201d\u201cNo, in comparison to the sound of the horses, the carriage is too quiet. If it\u2019s a merchant, the sound of the horse hooves and carriage should be about the same since they carry a heavy load.\u201d\u201cThen, is it a traveler, sir?\u201d\u201cNo traveler goes around with a horse and carriage.\u201d\u201cThen, who is it, sir?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s most likely someone of high standing with his or her bodyguards.\u2019As Zich said, the people they saw under their firewood lights were obviously from a wealthy background. They were also people dressed in full armor who protected the huge carriage.\u2018They are Karuwiman\u2019s Holy Knights.\u2019Karuwiman was a powerful religious family. They served the holy god, Karuna, who many royals, nobles, and commoners followed. In short, they were a force one couldn\u2019t make light of.\u2018To think it was someone who the Karuwiman Holy Knights were guarding.\u2019Indeed, they were not just anyone. The Holy Knights and the carriage continued to head where Zich and Hans were and stopped in front of them.Neigh!The horses snorted. Nervous about the scale and power of the Holy Knights, Hans trembled, and Zich got up.\u2018I don\u2019t think they are planning to fight.\u2019Karuwiman was a religious family. Of course, that didn\u2019t mean that they had zero rotten apples, but they didn\u2019t go around spreading evil. However, Zich\u2019s relationship with them wasn\u2019t good. No, before he regressed, Zich had fought with them with his life on the line.He naturally felt wary of them.\u2018That woman was also a part of Karuwiman.\u2019She wasn\u2019t just part of it\u2014she was also their saint. As one of the hero\u2019s party members, she could give an incredible blessing to her party members so that they could max out their abilities. She could also heal them, making one confused whether her companions were zombies or humans.\u2018Now that I think about it, how are they all doing right now?\u2019Zich was lost in thought for a moment when\u2014Clack!A person opened the carriage\u2019s doors and got off. Seeing how the Holy Knights heightened their defense, the person seemed to have been the one they were protecting. Zich looked at the person with interest, and his eyes widened.She was one of those people Zich could never forget.\u2018The female saint?\u2019The person Zich just thought of and had been a central figure in his final death was standing right in front of him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She is not my enemy, at least right now.\u2019Zich had fought the Saint before he regressed, but this was their first meeting. However, because the memories of what happened before his regression were still so fresh, Zich couldn\u2019t erase the discomfort he felt inside his heart.The Holy Knight closest to her said in a worried voice, \u201cLady Lubella. You don\u2019t have to get out personally.\u201dHowever, Aine Lubella shook her head.\u201cWe are the ones who have to ask them a favor. It\u2019s only right that I, the representative of this company, have to come forward.\u201d\u201cBut we don\u2019t even know the statuses of these men.\u201d\u201cKaruna\u2019s benevolence doesn\u2019t discern between ranks and status.\u201dAs if she was giving a lecture, Lubella talked strictly and smiled again.\u201cFurthermore, aren\u2019t all of you going to protect me?\u201dAt her words, all the Holy Knights seemed touched and overwhelmed by emotions, but that also made the Holy Knights more protective over her.\u201cStop this. You all have lost. Let her do what she wants.\u201dA strong, low voice seeped out of the carriage. Then, another person came out of the carriage after the Saint.\u2018That guy is!\u2019Zich had let down his guard after hearing the conversation between the Saint and her knights, but after seeing this man, Zich heightened his alertness to the maximum in an instant. The man was also someone who Zich knew.With amiable eyes, silver hair, and a beard, he was a kind-looking old man who looked like he had lived a peaceful life. However, he was definitely not the chuckling, next-door grandpa type like his external appearance suggested. He had numerous nicknames such as Karuna\u2019s Sword, the idol of all Holy Knights, Guardian of the Divinity, and so on, but to Zich, he was more familiar with the man\u2019s other nickname.\u2018Tasnia\u2019s Killing Machine!\u2019Before Zich was called the Demon Lord, there was a large group of people called the \u2018Demon People.\u2019 Demon People did whatever they felt like, refused to abide by their countries\u2019 rules, brought chaos to the world, and generally inconvenienced others with their careless attitudes. Before he was called the Demon Lord, Zich had also been a part of those \u2018Demon People.\u2019However, as these Demon People collided with each other or were removed by an outside force, their numbers decreased. Those who slowly built their strength among them and survived later gained the title of the Demon Lord; and before a Hero Party eradicated them, they reigned with fear.In that time of chaos, this old man minced many Demon People. Currently, he was standing in front of Zich right now and was laughing, \u2018Ho ho!\u2019 Many evildoers and Demon People died under his hands, but the old man was most known for the incident that gave him the title, \u2018Tasnia\u2019s Killing Machine.\u2019\u2018On the Tasnia Plains, he killed six Demon People and their followers in one swing.\u2019During the time that the story spread, Demon People had run so rampant that people called the period, \u2018The Demon People Age.\u2019 Of course, because the \u2018Tasnia Plains Incident\u2019 had happened at the beginning of this age, the Demon People were comparatively weak. But they were still called the Demon People, and it was shocking that the old man managed to not only kill the six Demon People but also their followers in one swing.\u2018Killing Machine\u2014I didn\u2019t know who came up with that nickname, but it\u2019s a good one.\u2019It might be a chilling nickname for someone serving a god, but for those who were against Karuwiman, they thought there wasn\u2019t a better fitting nickname.\u2018In my current state, I probably won\u2019t even be able to give him a single scratch.\u2019Although Zich was getting stronger at an exponentially fast pace, he had regressed only recently.As if they were done talking, the Saint and the Killing Machine approached Zich.\u2018Damn it! Their energies are off the charts!\u2019One of them was the Killing Machine, who Zich had no chance of sticking a single tooth in, and the other was the Zombie Maker, who could erase all traces even if she was bitten. Of course, like how Zich was weak at the moment, Lubella probably couldn\u2019t use her incredible blessing as she did before the regression. But even now, it was enough to make Zich\u2019s heart beat.\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d\u201cGood, what about you?\u201dHowever, Zich had also gone through his fair share of messes. He was in shock for only a moment and instantly regained his composure to respond to the Saint with a gentle greeting.\u201cExcuse us at such a late time. I am the servant of Karuna, Aine Lubella.\u201d\u2018Is she not a Saint yet?\u2019From what he knew, he had heard that the Saint\u2019s middle name was Primel. When Zich first met her\u2014no, fought her, her full name was \u2018Aine Primel Lubella.\u2019\u2018She must still be a Saint candidate.\u2019Zich knew that Karuwiman elected several Saint candidates and awarded one of them with the title of Saint. Seeing that she didn\u2019t mention her middle name, Primal, it seemed that she wasn\u2019t the Saint yet.After Lubella finished her self-introduction, the Killing Machine came forward. His benign smile was like that of a predator, wearing the skins of an herbivore and growling deceitfully.\u201cI am Karuna\u2019s humble servant and swordsman, Belri Weig. And the men over there are swordsmen like me who serve Karuna.\u201dThe Holy Knights nodded slightly at Zich.\u201cI am Zich.\u201dZich threw away his Steelwall last name, and he felt hesitant to use the name, Moore, which he had used as the Demon Lord. Since he was planning to live a kind life, he didn\u2019t add a last name, and both Lubella and Weig didn\u2019t point out the matter either. They weren\u2019t that interested in Zich.\u2018Anyways, I didn\u2019t think that I would be greeting them like this.\u2019It was one of the exciting things about regressing. He didn\u2019t know what would happen in the future, but at least for now, Zich and the two were meeting in completely different circumstances than they had before Zich regressed.\u2018Since I swore to live a kind life, this might be good.\u2019\u201cHey, you should also greet\u2026\u201dZich turned towards Hans and stopped.\u2018This is a surprise.\u2019Hans\u2019 eyes were staring at Lubella, and his face was ridiculous. He didn\u2019t blink, and his pupils were at a standstill; and in his gaping mouth, it looked like saliva was going to drip out at any moment.\u2018Well, I guess it\u2019s understandable\u2026?\u2019The Saint was unrealistically beautiful.\u2018Now that I think about it, including that Glen Zenard guy, everyone in the Hero Party was beautiful and handsome. It was as if they picked their party members by their looks.\u2019Of course, that couldn\u2019t have been the case since Glen Zenard\u2019s companions also had skills that matched them.\u2018It\u2019s not like they are playing dollhouse.\u2019Zich tilted his head and focused his attention on Hans again.\u2018I should take care of him first.\u2019Hans was still staring at Lubella. Thankfully, she was smiling, looking slightly embarrassed, while everyone else, including Weig, seemed like they understood and were used to it. But Zich couldn\u2019t just let it be. Although they understood, it didn\u2019t mean that they thought well of this situation. Actually, some knights were starting to look uncomfortable.\u201cGather your senses!\u201dPunch!\u201cAh!\u201dAfter getting hit on the back of his head, Hans gathered his hands around his head and crouched.\u201cThis guy\u2019s name is Hans. He is my servant.\u201d\u201cI-I see.\u201dWith a worried look on her face, Lubella looked at Hans squirming in pain.\u201cAnyways, what did you come here for?\u201d\u201cAh, we are also planning to stay the night and camp around here. We wanted to ask for your understanding.\u201dThe place where Zich and Hans were camping was a wide open area. Unlike the other areas that were filled to the brim with trees, the area they were in only had a bit of weed. It felt like a place where people usually camped with the traces of an extinguished bonfire and trash.\u2018Did they come out in person to say that? A person who is the Saint candidate?\u2019Zich was impressed. No, he was beyond impressed and couldn\u2019t understand. It almost seemed like she wasn\u2019t human like him.\u2018I guess this is what they mean by a kind person.\u2019Zich couldn\u2019t imagine himself doing something like this.\u201cOf course.\u201dZich nodded.* * *The people from Karuwiman prepared to camp for the night instantly. With the carriage that Lubella would sleep in, a huge tent was set up.\u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d\u201cY-yes, sir?\u201dHans looked as if he was caught stealing a treasure. His gaze hadn\u2019t left the carriage for some time.\u201cWake up!\u201d\u201cYes sir!\u201d\u2018He is only good at answering.\u2019Hans\u2019 actions didn\u2019t follow his answer, and Zich shrugged his shoulders when he saw Hans\u2019 eyes edge towards the carriage once again.\u2018If I drag him around so that he will be too tired to think of useless thoughts, he will gather his senses.\u2019And it was also very easy to make Hans tired. Zich smiled wide with his teeth showing as he looked at Hans. But unfortunately, Hans didn\u2019t see what Zich was doing and couldn\u2019t predict the hell that he would soon jump into.\u2018But this is fate. Now that I have the chance, should I ask about that?\u2019Zich suddenly thought and walked towards Karuwiman. Hans got up to follow him, but Zich blocked Hans with his hands, so Hans slumped down to the ground.\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201dA Holy Knight on guard blocked Zich\u2019s path.\u201cCan I talk to the Sa\u2014no, with Lady Lubella, sir? I have something to ask her.\u201dSeeing the knight\u2019s annoyed expression, it didn\u2019t seem like he would let Zich pass.\u2018Well, I have nothing to really lose from this.\u2019Zich also had no thoughts to keep pushing if they denied his entry.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dThis surprised the Holy Knight, as well as Zich who was about to walk away. Lubella popped her head out from the carriage.\u201cPlease come in.\u201dAs she smiled warmly and even gestured towards Zich, the Holy Knight could not help but protest.\u201cBut Lady Lubella!\u201d\u201cI have a duty to listen to as many people as I can. Isn\u2019t the purpose of this journey for me to gain a lot of experience?\u201d\u201cHe might be dangerous!\u201d\u201cSir Weig is next to me. And I also have all of you. With this, my protection is more than enough.\u201d\u2018True. Having Tasnia\u2019s Killing Machine as a bodyguard is more than enough.\u2019The Holy Knight looked conflicted by Lubella\u2019s firm resolve, but Weig agreed with Lubella as he was watching from the carriage.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I will be next to Lady Lubella.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, sir.\u201dThe Holy Knight let Zich pass. However, the knight did not hide his disapproval; he looked at Zich as if Zich had caused an unnecessary interruption. But Zich did not pay any attention to the knight and Lubella led him inside the carriage.The inside of the carriage was clean. There were some religious decorations, but they weren\u2019t extravagant. Zich sat opposite Lubella. Weig followed behind Zich, took his seat next to Lubella, and they both looked at Zich.\u201cYou have something you want to ask me?\u201d\u201cYes. Lady Lubella, I think you are probably the best person to ask.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhat should I do to live a kind life?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t expect him to ask such a question. Even Weig looked at Zich with curiosity. In his own way, Zich was really serious.\u2018Even if I want to live a kind life, I don\u2019t know the first thing about being kind. When I hit and destroy things, I don\u2019t have to think about anything, so it is convenient.\u2019For most of his life, Zich lived however he wanted. Even if he wanted to \u2018live a kind life,\u2019 he couldn\u2019t think of ways to achieve that goal. So far, he acted according to whatever random ideas popped up in his mind, but he wasn\u2019t sure if his actions were really along the lines of \u2018living kindly.\u2019\u2018This woman might be able to at least tell me where I can start.\u2019Before Zich regressed, she had been a Saint. Even though she was not a Saint right now, being selected as a candidate for Karuwiman\u2019s Saint position was a daunting task. From a young age, she must have possessed the main qualification of the Saint, which was kindness\u2014a quality that Zich thought was not so different from stupidity.\u201cHmm, so about that\u2026\u201dLubella did not know how to answer. To live a kind life\u2014the question was too broad to give a thorough answer.\u201cBefore I answer, can you tell me why you are asking me this question?\u201d\u201cSomeone suggested that I should try living a kind life for once. But I once lived a pretty rough life, so it\u2019s hard for me to grasp what exactly I should do.\u201dZich indirectly confessed that he had lived a bad life. However, Lubella praised him instead of rebuking him.\u201cThat\u2019s really impressive. It must have been a challenge to try to change your trajectory in life.\u201dAs a characteristic among kind people, she tended to think positively about everything.\u201cThere are many ways to live a kind life. Is there something that you are good at?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m good at destroying things.\u201d\u201cI-is that so?\u201dSeeing how Lubella was taken back, Weig quietly laughed. They could perceive Zich\u2019s character from his few words.\u201cSo, am I right to assume that you are proficient in tasks that utilize your physical strength?\u201d\u201cYes, you can say it like that.\u201d\u201cThen what about helping people who are in need?\u201d\u201cPeople who are in need?\u201d\u201cYes. There are many different ways to be kind. But fundamentally, I think a kind act is an act that gives happiness to another person, no matter how small or big it is.\u201d\u201cAn act that gives happiness to another person\u2026\u201dIt was an area that Zich had no experience in\u2014no, a lot of contrasting experience in. Although Zich had made many people cry tears of blood, he had never made another individual happy.\u201cSince you said you are good at tasks that involve physical strength, why don\u2019t you help people in that way?\u201d\u201cSo, I just have to help people who are in need?\u201d\u201cYes. If you start doing that, won\u2019t you be able to slowly grasp the concept of kind acts?\u201dZich nodded his head.\u201cThank you for your advice.\u201d\u201cNo, I am happy that I could be of help to someone who is trying to change their life. I will pray for your blessing to Karuna.\u201dReceiving a blessing in the name of Karuna sent chills down Zich\u2019s back. However, he didn\u2019t show this at all and received Lubella\u2019s blessing while constantly repeating in his mind that he was no longer an enemy of Karuwiman.Zich stepped down from the carriage and returned to flat ground.\u201cFor what reason did you go up there, sir?\u201dWith curiosity in his eyes, Hans looked up at Zich. He seemed to still have a lot of interest in Lubella.\u201cNothing much. I just asked how I can live a kind life.\u201d\u201cHow to live a kind life, sir?\u201d\u2018Wait, was that crazy statement for real?\u2019Hans had definitely heard Zich say that before they left Steelwall, but it was so nonsensical that Hans had long since erased it from his mind.\u201cWhy, are you so surprised?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m not surprised, sir!\u201dEven though he was obviously lying, Hans fervently denied it. He could not say that he was surprised because it didn\u2019t fit Zich at all.\u201cWhy, does it not fit me?\u201d\u201cO-of course not, sir.\u201dHans\u2019 mouth began to feel parched. He glanced at Zich\u2019s face. However, contrary to his expectation, Zich\u2019s mood seemed alright. Zich moved the firewood around and began humming after starting a fire.Hans felt relieved that Zich was probably not going to hit him; feeling that the atmosphere was cordial, Hans asked Zich another question.\u201cWhat did she say to you, sir?\u201d\u201cShe told me to help people in need. After I told her I was good at destroying things, she told me that it would be good for me to help people by using my physical strength.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was a perfect fit for someone like Zich. Even though Hans had spent more years with the Zich who couldn\u2019t even speak back to a servant and desperately sought for his father\u2019s love, the recent Zich had made such a significant impact on Hans that he could only remember Zich as he was now\u2014a dictator who tried to solve all problems with power and violence.\u2018Well, maybe things will get better since Sir Zich received advice from the holy lady, and it really does seem like he wants to perform kind acts.\u2019But even while he thought this, Hans could not help but look at Zich with suspicion.* * *Karuwiman\u2019s Saint was the poster child for the family. For that reason, the process of being a Saint was complicated and lengthy, and one of the steps was to do what Lubella was going through right now such as: traveling around the world and listening to the views and thoughts of a diverse group of people.\u201cLet\u2019s start.\u201dOnce again, Lubella started the carriage after listening, comforting, and blessing a large number of people in a village.\u201cAre you tired?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m a bit tired.\u201dAt Weig\u2019s question, Lubella gave a strained smile. However, as if she was bringing out the last bit of her remaining energy, she raised her two fists.\u201cBut as Karuna\u2019s follower, I have to obey Karuna\u2019s teachings and always try to do my best. Even though I can\u2019t do much for people, I can at least comfort them. My tiredness is a trivial matter.\u201d\u201cYou will also have a higher chance of being selected as the Saint.\u201d\u201cSir Weig.\u201dWeig laughed at Lubella\u2019s rebuking tone.\u201cFufufu, it seems that as I get older, I become less thoughtful.\u201d\u201cStop teasing me.\u201d\u201cI apologize.\u201dWeig lowered his head with great formality.\u201cBut it is true that you will have a higher chance of being selected.\u201d\u201cI am not doing this because I want to become a Saint!\u201d\u201cAnd that type of attitude makes you more suitable for the Saint role.\u201dLubella could not beat Weig in a conversation since the man had gone through all sorts of adversities and knew how to be cunning. Lubella pouted and turned her head away.\u2018She is still young.\u2019Her emotions were clearly visible. He could not criticize her for it since she had lived inside a small bubble all her life. Thus, this trip was necessary for her to gain experience and fix her na\u00efve attitude.\u2018But compared to the other candidates, she definitely fits the Saint role the most.\u2019Even as a Saint candidate, it did not mean that everyone was dutiful and kind like Lubella. For example, there were some people who made Weig wonder how the hell they passed the test. Compared to them, Lubella was basically an angel. But she also had some flaws.\u2018She doesn\u2019t have tenacity.\u2019\u201cAfter this trip is over, you will be returning to the Church again.\u201dWeig said this out loud to test Lubella. He clicked his tongue after seeing Lubella\u2019s expression darken.\u201cI\u2019m repeating this again, Lady Lubella, but it\u2019s not enough to just be patient and nice. As followers of Karuwiman, not only do we have to comfort people, but we also must protect them. So, we must have strong hearts.\u201d\u201c\u2026I know.\u201dLubella heard this many times before, and she nodded to show that she understood. However, her voice was tiny.\u2018It\u2019s not easy.\u2019Physical abilities could be strengthened by training like mad, but mental fortitude was much more complicated. Speaking further about this topic only served to stress Lubella, so Weig switched to another topic.\u201cNow that I think about it, I\u2019m wondering if our friend is doing well.\u201d\u201cOur friend?\u201d\u201cYou know, that young man who asked you to teach him how to be kind.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dMemories flooded back to Lubella. It was not an old memory, so it was easy for her to remember.\u201cI was really surprised then. I didn\u2019t expect someone to ask a question like that.\u201d\u201cYes, but it seemed like it was important for that young man.\u201dAs the Holy Knights strictly protected Lubella, a person needed a lot of courage to even ask to meet her.\u201cI also think so. His eyes were very serious when he asked me. I want to find out if my advice was helpful to him and how he is working towards his goal.\u201dLubella quietly prayed to herself that he would find light in his path.* * *The followers of Karuwiman arrived in the large city. They first secured a place to stay, and since they were in a big city, they visited a shrine for Karuwiman. But as Lubella was in the process of traveling around the world as a Saint candidate, they could not use the shrine for their own means and Lubella went out of her lodging with a couple of Holy Knights. Even in the city, she had to see how people lived firsthand and interact with them.However, Weig, her closest bodyguard, was nowhere to be found. Weig had received an order from the Church, so he was absent for a bit.\u201cLet\u2019s try going over there.\u201dLubella pointed to a dark alley with a few people. From a glance, it looked dangerous, so the Holy Knights had conflicted expressions on their faces. However, no one could stop her since this journey\u2019s purpose was for Lubella to see even the lowest points of what this world had to offer.The Holy Knights hoped that nothing eventful would happen. However, contrary to their wishes, menacing cries came out of the alley.\u201cP-please save me!\u201d\u201cI told you that I will spare your life if you just give me the item! Why can\u2019t you listen!\u201dPunch! Punch!\u201cAgh! Arghh!\u201dFearful cries, threatening voices, and the sound of hard fists hitting flesh echoed down the alley. It was easy to understand the situation.Without hesitation, Lubella and the Holy Knights hurried to the alleyway.\u201cStop!\u201dThe first Holy Knight to arrive shouted in the direction of the cries. At once, the punching sound ceased. Lubella arrived a little later and began to assess the situation. The first thing she saw was a person collapsed on the floor. Seeing that the person\u2019s face was puffy in different areas and blood was flowing out from his lips and nose, it was apparent that he was hit many times. With tears in his eyes, the man looked at Lubella and the Holy Knight as if they were his saviors.Then, Lubella shifted her eyes towards the offenders. There were four of them. Seeing their ungainly appearance and manners, they looked like gangsters or thugs. The offenders seemed to be taken back by Lubella and the Holy Knight\u2019s appearance\u2014all except for one person.\u201cOh? Is it not Lady Lubella and the Holy Knights? What sort of business brings all of you here?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026!\u201dLubella was shocked. The person who was leading this violent attack\u2014was Zich!\u201cI didn\u2019t think that we would be reunited this soon. Can I ask you what reason made you come here in such a hurry?\u201d\u201cWhat reason?\u201dAt Zich\u2019s shameless attitude, Lubella was left speechless. But she soon regained her composure and screamed, \u201cSo that I can help save people obviously! I should be asking what you are doing! Did you not tell me that you wanted to live kindly? Then what are you doing right now!\u201dIt had really been a long time since Lubella was so angry, but Zich tilted his head as if he could not understand why, and that angered her.\u201cBut I\u2019m acting according to your advice?\u201d\u201cIn what way are you following my advice!\u201d\u201cYou told me to give my services to people who need help.\u201dZich pointed at the three thugs behind him.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m helping people who need my help.\u201d\u2018I-I told him to help people who are in need, so he is helping thugs?\u2019Again, Lubella was left speechless by Zich\u2019s outrageous, almost ingenious, interpretation of her words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Two people sat in the center of the room where there was a worn-out table and stains spotted the floor\u2019s surface. It was Zich and Lubella.The situation was like this: after Lubella chased the thugs away, healed the victim, and checked his identity, she brought Zich to her lodging. Criticism was apparent on Lubella\u2019s face, but Zich looked calm.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI told you to help those who were in need. Who could take that to mean helping gangsters!\u201dSome of the Holy Knights protecting Lubella in the room also looked stunned.\u201cDidn\u2019t you just tell me to help those in need without adding any other conditions? Those guys looked like they were having some serious difficulties.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s common sense!\u201d\u201cI asked you for advice because I don\u2019t have that common sense though?\u201dLubella was at a loss for words at Zich\u2019s response and grabbed her head. As someone who had spent most of her life in church, this was her first time experiencing something like this.\u2018No, this isn\u2019t because of my lack of experience.\u2019Even a person with a lot of experience would have probably never met a person like Zich.\u2018If I consider that, even this is an incredible experience to have.\u2019If she didn\u2019t at least think this way, Lubella felt like her head would have cracked.\u201cPlease continue to try to help the weak.\u201d\u201cYou are sneakily changing the conditions a bit.\u201d\u201cAnd who do you think is the cause for that?\u201dLubella glared at Zich. All kinds of thoughts of how she should settle the matter with Zich flashed across her mind. Then, she got up from her seat.\u201cWell, for now, let\u2019s apologize to the victim tomorrow.\u201d\u201cTo whom?\u201d\u201cThe person you hit.\u201d\u201cI already said this before, but I just did what you told me to do\u2026\u201dAt Lubella\u2019s glaring, Zich shrugged.\u201cI will apologize.\u201d* * *\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dBriand Sude graciously accepted Lubella and Zich\u2019s apology. Thanks to Lubella\u2019s treatment, he had a happy-go-lucky smile and looked very easy\u2014no, nice. Zich made a satisfied smile and nodded. Then, he looked towards Lubella.\u201cHe says it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026Please apologize to him sincerely.\u201d\u201cI am really fine.\u201dWith Sude\u2019s words, Zich raised his chin even higher. Lubella wanted to say more, but she gave up because she thought nothing would go through Zich.\u201cI am sorry. In place of him, I apologize.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s really fine. Furthermore, it\u2019s not like you, Lady Lubella, did anything wrong.\u201d\u201cI am the one who gave him the suggestion. I share some blame too.\u201dOf course, Lubella had not given him the wrong advice. Who would have thought someone could so inaccurately interpret her words like that? But Lubella still thought she had some responsibility about the matter.\u201cYou really are kind, Lady. As expected of someone from Karuwiman.\u201d\u201cNo, I am still lacking.\u201dBut as if she liked the compliment that Karuwiman got, a small smile curved up her lips.\u201cBut what happened? What did the thugs hit you in the alleyway for?\u201dLubella looked from Zich to Sude in search of the truth. The one who answered first was Zich.\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly. The thugs said that he had an important item. They said that they just needed to take that.\u201d\u201cWhat was it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t know what you had to take, but you beat up a person?\u201d\u201cThe important part was to take the item. What the item was didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cAre you really a gangster or a person like that?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that I lived a rough life?\u201dAs if he had coated his face with metal, Zich\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change at all. It was at a point where even Hans, who came with him, sighed.\u2018Anyhow, what does he mean by a rough life? Didn\u2019t Sir Zich live a quiet life until recently?\u2019But Hans recalled the environment Zich grew up in.\u2018Well, if I consider the Steelwall and Zich\u2019s situation, I guess you could say that he lived a harsh life.\u2019Suddenly, Hans felt a bit regretful for his past behavior. If he had maintained even the most basic etiquette, Zich wouldn\u2019t have forcefully dragged him out of the Count\u2019s residence, and he wouldn\u2019t have to suffer like this.Since it felt like she couldn\u2019t gain any more useful information from Zich, Lubella turned her attention towards Sude again.\u201cCan we know more? Of course, it may be hard to reveal everything to us, but we could help you with your situation.\u201dLubella quietly and carefully convinced him, but Sude hesitated. He looked as if he was wondering if he should tell or not.\u201c\u2026First of all, I don\u2019t have an important item like he mentioned,\u201d Sude said while pointing at Zich.\u201cYou don\u2019t have the item?\u201d\u201cYes, they just made that up to harass me for no reason.\u201d\u201cIt was only to harass you?\u201d\u201cYes, but they did have a purpose.\u201dSude slowly looked around his surroundings. Following his gaze, everyone in the room twisted their neck in all directions. The place they were all in was a shop. It looked like the shop sold clothes as rolled-up fabrics filled the shelves and walls. However, if anyone asked a hundred people if the shop looked good, all hundred would answer: \u2018No, it doesn\u2019t.\u2019The wooden building sloped down like it was going to break down at any moment. A spider web hung in the corner of the room, display stands were spotted with stains that looked like they couldn\u2019t be erased no matter how much one rubbed against it, and the shop\u2019s rusty floor made onlookers feel gloomy.\u201cIt\u2019s a worn-out shop, right?\u201dSude pointed it out. Lubella shook her head firmly.\u201cNo, it is a great shop. We can\u2019t just judge something based on its exterior.\u201d\u201cI am thankful that you say that. Like Lady Lubella says, this is a special place to us. Since our grandfather\u2019s time, we were able to survive thanks to the shop. But besides what Lady Lubella and I think, it doesn\u2019t have a very inviting exterior,\u201d Sude said in a bit of a self-mocking tone.\u201cIt has somehow become so deplorable. Although the shop is very precious to us, if you look at it objectively, it doesn\u2019t have much worth. No, it used to be like that.\u201d\u201cWhat is different about it now?\u201d\u201cA lot of it is different. Did you take a look at the shop\u2019s surroundings when you came here?\u201d\u201cYes, most places were getting reconstructed.\u201d\u201cIt had been recently decided that this area would turn into a business zone. I don\u2019t know if I am lucky or not, but my shop is included inside the zone.\u201dPorti was a colossal business city. Using its strategic background, the city had amassed great wealth and gained autonomous control over a specific region from the state. As expected, business was the most important thing to Porti. The reason why they chose a new business zone was also for that reason.\u201cAre they trying to take your shop?\u2019At Lubella\u2019s question, Sude made a heavy nod.\u201cSince some time ago, they have been asking me to hand my shop over to them. Of course, I don\u2019t have the slightest bit of interest in letting this place go in the memory of my grandfather and father\u2026\u201d\u201cThe harassment must have started then.\u201dSude didn\u2019t answer, but everyone knew what his silence meant.\u201cWho are they?\u201d\u201cThey are the Siren Corporation. They are the group making the new shops next to my shop. From what I know, they are planning to make a huge store that\u2019s big enough to include mine.\u201d\u201cDoes it mean that they have decided to steal the shop from you?\u201d Lubella\u2019s voice was mixed with distress, \u201cHave you requested help from the Magistrate?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no use. He is part of them. The head of the Siren Corporation is offering bribes to the Mayor, and not only that, but he is also the younger brother of one the Mayor\u2019s associates.\u201d\u201cIn fact, there aren\u2019t any good rumors about the city\u2019s mayor.\u201dOne of the Holy Knights explained further to Lubella, and Lubella\u2019s distress peaked.\u201c\u2026I will try meeting with the Mayor tomorrow.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cThank goodness there\u2019s a way for me to atone for my sins.\u201dAs Sude looked at her with bewildered eyes, Lubella made a reassuring smile.\u201cLady Lubella, for caution\u2019s sake\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. Even if we are Karuwiman, we shouldn\u2019t try to get involved in politics.\u201dLubella nodded in response to the Holy Knight\u2019s careful words. Although Karuwiman was a religion that had considerable influence on many people, it ended there. Even the royals and aristocrats who bowed their heads in delight to receive Karuna\u2019s blessing from her would forget their smiles, pour out murderous intent, and antagonize her if she tried to intrude upon their interests.\u2018Even if I can\u2019t outrightly harm them, I can keep them in check.\u2019But if the worst happened, it could backfire on Karuwiman.\u201cIf we try to intrude in every little matter, we could lose our ability to use Karuwiman\u2019s name. What will happen if others try to hold Karuwiman in check? But if we hold onto our faith and help the weak, people will continue to love us.\u201dEven with the danger of outside influences, the way the group acted throughout the decades was the reason why Karuwiman was so loved today. The Holy Knights nodded. They didn\u2019t mean to cover up this incident and pass it over, but they also wanted to give a word of advice to Lubella who they served.Sude stopped them with a difficult expression.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go that far\u2026\u201d\u201cThis doesn\u2019t only involve you. As a person from Karuwiman, I can\u2019t just ignore injustice and stand by. Don\u2019t worry. I will make sure that no harm will befall you as a result.\u201d\u201c\u2026You really are a virtuous and noble person. I will pray for your future to be endowed with an everlasting blessing.\u201dSude bowed deeply and thanked her. Zich stared at Lubella bowing deeply to receive his thanks. On the other hand, Zich was as shameless as ever. He even yawned as if the conversation bored him.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Haaa! Since it\u2019s also my fault that I gave you the wrong advice and Mr. Sude also said that he forgives you, I think we should settle this matter here. Especially since you don\u2019t seem to be lying that you want to \u2018live a kind life.\u2019 But I hope that you will think twice before you use violence and think about if that is really a kind action.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cAlso, please don\u2019t forget the other piece of advice I gave you.\u201d\u201cYou mean the one to \u2018help the weak?\u2019 I don\u2019t really like the advice, though.\u201d Zich shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWell, since it\u2019s what Lady Lubella said, I understand.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAfter finishing her conversation with Zich, Lubella gave her farewells to the two again and left the shop.\u201cUm, I am sorry.\u201dMaybe it was because Lubella had told him to help the weak, but after Lubella left, Zich apologized awkwardly again.\u201cI forgot everything now, but if you still feel some guilt, I hope you will protect the weak as Lady Lubella told you.\u201d\u201cAh, ok. I will try.\u201dZich left the shop while swaying his hands.* * *Soon, it became midnight. A dark mass of clouds covered the moon and the stars, so it was hard to see where they were going. Holding a torch, Hans turned behind him.\u201cIs there something that you are dissatisfied with, sir?\u201dZich had walked without saying anything for a while now. It seemed like he was thinking deeply about something, and even though Hans didn\u2019t want to do something like wake a sleeping dog, it was chilling to see Zich just follow him from behind like a ghost. In the end, Hans had no choice but to open his mouth.\u201cYou know what Lubella told me. Is it really true?\u201dAlthough Zich didn\u2019t add \u2018Lady\u2019 to Lubella\u2019s name, Hans let it go. Truthfully, he thought if the current Zich added an honorific to anyone\u2019s name, it would be more surprising.\u201cWhat are you talking about, sir?\u201d\u201cWhat she said about helping the weak.\u201d\u201cIs there something wrong about that, sir?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right somehow. Can I really do that? Isn\u2019t she confused about something?\u2019\u2018You are the one who is confused.\u2019Hans was shocked when he found out that Zich had helped thugs to help someone in need.\u2018What do you think she is confused about?\u2019\u201cI can understand the part about helping the weak. But according to her, it seems like she is telling me to help someone like Sude.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018it seems\u2019 but \u2018it is,\u2019 sir.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dZich tilted his head.\u201cWell, since I have no other option, should I follow that? I still think it\u2019s the wrong approach, but what Lubella said\u2026\u201dHalt!Zich stopped walking. At this, Hans also halted in his steps.\u201cWhat is it, sir?\u201d\u201cLook over there.\u201dZich pointed to the front. Without realizing it, they had come to a mostly uninhabited area. On their left, the creek trickled, while to their right, shabby houses sparsely lined up the area. There wasn\u2019t a single light as if those were empty houses or their residents were sleeping.Hans squinted his eyes to see what Zich was pointing at.\u201cIs it\u2026 a person, sir?\u201d Hans trailed off.The obscure figure seemed to be the shape of a person. However, it was hard to say that it was a human as the shadow\u2019s movements were bizarre.\u201cIt\u2019s not human.\u201d\u201cSorry? Then, what is it, sir?\u201dBefore Hans could hear the answer, the shadowy figure entered the torch light\u2019s range and gave off a nauseating stench.\u201cIt\u2019s a zombie.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a human corpse that moved by receiving dark energy, and this zombie\u2019s appearance was a truly gruesome sight to see.\u201cUrgh!\u201d Hans gagged.During their trip, he saw a monster\u2019s corpse and actually killed a monster himself. And because he had served the Steelwalls rather than other families, Hans was more used to death and corpses than the average person. However, the creature in front of him was on a different level.Grrr! Grrrr!Under its torn skin, they could see its Adam\u2019s apple bobbing up and down.Step!The zombie walked slowly but boldly towards the two, and Hans took a step backward.\u201cS-s-sir Zich! T-that is!\u201d\u201cBe quiet.\u201dClang!Zich moved past the stuttering Hans and pulled out his sword. The sunlight dyed the blade red, making it look like the sword of judgment that an angel might use.Step! Step!Zich followed the footsteps of the zombie that was coming towards him. Behind him, Hans clutched his torch and gulped his saliva.Grrrrrrr!As Zich closed in on it, the zombie stretched out its hands. In its open mouth, dirty teeth hung irregularly, and the zombie\u2019s long and black fingernails looked sharp enough to rip a person\u2019s skin into pieces and take out their bones. Its discharge was toxic enough to rot a whole body.But\u2026\u2018It\u2019s still just a zombie.\u2019\u201cWhoaaaaaaa!\u201dThe zombie wildly moved with its tangled-up legs, and Zich dodged to the side and swung his sword.Slice!The sword cleanly cut the zombie\u2019s neck. Even as the zombie\u2019s head flew to the sky, it clacked its teeth at Zich\u2014but that was only for a moment.Drop!Thud!Two different types of collisions could be heard: the sound of the zombie\u2019s head falling to the ground and the sound of the zombie\u2019s body shedding.\u201cEick!\u201dThe zombie\u2019s head rolled to the bottom of Hans\u2019 feet, and Hans backed off with a shriek.\u201cI-is it dead?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dWith a scowl, Zich looked at his sword\u2019s body; it was smeared with the zombie\u2019s fluid.\u201cAh, damn it! This is why I hate zombies! If I am dealing with the undead, clean ones like the skeletons are much better!\u201dZich took off some tree leaves and intensely wiped the zombie\u2019s fluids off his sword before he placed it back inside its sheath. Then, he walked to the side of the fallen zombie, and Hans also snuck around behind him.\u201cWhy is it here, sir?\u201d\u201cHm, I don\u2019t know either. Why would it be here?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t even a small village; it was uncommon to see a monster hiding inside a city, not to mention a zombie that feasted on human flesh.\u201cWell, let\u2019s inform the Magistrate for now. It might have come under the cover of darkness, or it might have been an unlucky guy who got mixed up in a crime and got sold to the city\u2019s black market.\u201d\u201cThen, could it be a coincidence, sir?\u201d\u201cIt is likely, but\u2014\u201dZich glanced at the zombie\u2019s head which had stopped moving with its mouth hanging wide open.\u201cI don\u2019t have a good feeling about this.\u201dFrom his experience, he had felt this feeling when something big was about to happen.* * *Zich and Hans handed the zombie over to the Magistrate. The officers asked them a couple of questions and soon handled the corpse.Zich furrowed his eyebrows.\u201cIt\u2019s strange.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201dZich stared at the spot where the officers had taken the zombie away.\u201cIf this was the first time this happened, they would have asked us much more questions to dig up as many details as they could. A monster, especially a zombie, appeared within the city. But the officers didn\u2019t ask us that many questions as if this is a common occurrence.\u201d\u201cThen, are you saying that something like this frequently happens in Porti, sir?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t say for sure, but it\u2019s likely.\u201dHans gulped his saliva back down. Just the thought of these disgusting creatures walking around the city was enough to make him shudder.\u201cBut it probably hasn\u2019t been for long. If it had been going on for a while, rumors would have spread by now, and public sentiment would have grown terrible. However, you can\u2019t sense that in the city yet.\u201d\u201cW-what should we do, sir?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for us to do anything. The higher-ups will handle the matter by themselves. And if we encounter another zombie, we can just hand them over to the officers again. We just do what we have been doing.\u201dHans nodded.* * *\u201cLet\u2019s express our gratitude to them.\u201d[Thank you!]A soaring spire quietly looked towards the ground in a magnificent temple. Age and long years had spotted its corners with ashy stains, but they couldn\u2019t have dropped the place\u2019s worth. On the contrary, these spots added to the temple\u2019s deep history and made the temple more familiar to its visitors.In front of the temple, a nun and about fifteen children were bowing their heads. The people they were bowing to were Zich and Hans.\u201cAlright. Before I come back, you must listen to Sister well and be kind to each other. Do you all understand?\u201d[Yes!]Their tones and tempo played separately, but the children yelled vigorously in front of the temple and their voices echoed. At the children\u2019s waving hands, they waved their hands and walked away from the temple.When they couldn\u2019t see the nun and children anymore, they let down their hands.\u201cGood, today\u2019s good deed was also perfect!\u201dZich\u2019s voice was mixed with pride.Hans shot quick glances at Zich.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cAh, no, sir. I just thought that you found the exact answer this time.\u201dHans thought Zich was beyond the boundary of common sense again since he had interpreted the advice of helping those in need to helping thugs before. However, Zich had surprisingly decided to help a nearby orphanage.Hans wanted to keep his mouth shut most of the time, but this time, curiosity pushed him to speak. It also helped that Zich didn\u2019t strike out in violence after they began traveling, and it seemed like Zich would generously allow most questions from now on. So, in the end, Hans asked, \u201cDid someone else give another piece of advice, sir?\u201d\u201cNothing of that sort. I mean, what do you think of first when you think of the weak? It\u2019s children. Especially children without their parents. Isn\u2019t that just common sense?\u201d\u2018I thought common sense didn\u2019t go through to you.\u2019Of course, Hans didn\u2019t say this out loud.\u201cBut besides that, what do you think about the work?\u201dSince Zich went to volunteer at an orphanage, the servant, Hans, had no choice but to follow Zich and also work. Hans nodded his head vigorously.\u201cOf course, sir! Even though it may not seem like it, I learned all kinds of work in the Steelwall residence! To mention a few, I learned cleaning, laundry, and even some administrative work! Even if there\u2019s a lot of work, I won\u2019t falter with this much.\u201dHans\u2019 voice was filled with confidence.\u2018By the looks of it, isn\u2019t this guy a high-quality talent?\u201dBesides menial works like cleaning, laundry, and other housework, if Hans had learned administrative work to run the household, it meant that he was a servant undergoing training to take the place of someone higher.\u201cBut Sir Zich, are you alright? Aren\u2019t you not used to working like this?\u201dIt seemed like Hans wanted to ask if Zich was used to menial tasks since Zich grew in a noble family, but his true feelings were different.\u2018With that hot temper, can he even look after children well?\u2019But contrary to Hans\u2019 expectations, Zich was adjusting very well.\u201cDid you forget? Who prepared everything for camping? Menial tasks are nothing for a genius like me.\u201dHard labor was easy enough to make a person yawn, especially if they knew how to control their mana. With Zich\u2019s sharpness, he could pick up things immediately. After all, he really was a genius born once in a century.And above all, he had gained a lot of experiences before his regression.\u201cAlso, even if I can\u2019t do menial tasks, I am really good at playing with the kids. Did you see how the kids acted when we were leaving? They were so sad to see us go.\u201d\u2018That is true.\u2019Hans didn\u2019t know what Zich did, but the children\u2019s eyes were full of sadness and regret when they were leaving.\u201cDid you do anything special?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think children like to do the most? Isn\u2019t it to play hero?\u201d Zich expanded his chest and boasted, \u201cI am amazing at acting as the Demon Lord. I can act really badly and also act the part of getting defeated by a hero.\u201dSince he had done all of these things before he regressed, Zich was probably better at acting as the Demon Lord than anyone else.While they talked, Zich and Hans saw two officers in disguise sticking something on the wall. They hurriedly snuck past Zich and began to walk away with bundles of paper in their hands speedily after they were done.\u201cIt must be a wanted list.\u201dThere were already a couple of people whispering in front of the notice. It seemed like it was a wanted poster for an incredibly wicked criminal since everyone stared at it with shock.Hans craned his neck forward to look at the poster, and Zich also stared.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dZich and Hans spoke at the same time.\u201cS-sir Zich. That is!\u201dHans pointed at the just posted wanted notice. In the poster, a drawing of an incredible beauty stared back at them.[Wanted][The Witch, Aine Lubella][Sins Committed: Responsible for the assassination of the Deputy Mayor. Attempted to cast a \u2018Great Curse\u2019 on the city of Porti.]After they had parted a few days ago, Lubella, who should have received the Saint\u2019s title, was titled as \u2018the Witch\u2019 and was on a wanted poster with her sins listed.* * *In the shop, next to Porti\u2019s commercial district, vendors and laborers were relieving their sorrows with alcohol after their work was over. It wasn\u2019t a high-end bar, but the place was enough to please the workers who lived paycheck to paycheck.\u201cHey, did you see that?\u201d\u201cSee what?\u201dTwo men began talking with large beer glasses between them.\u201cYou know, the wanted list for the Witch.\u201d\u201cOh, you mean the Witch from Karuwiman.\u201dZich and Hans, who were drinking near them, perked their ears.\u201cMy business is a mess because of that. People were not spending their money, and officials closed the palace walls to catch the Witch. They investigated so thoroughly that the freight volume went down by a lot.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the only problem. They say that because of the Witch\u2019s curse, the undead are roaming around the city. Officials say that we have to go back home before the sun sets.\u201d\u201cI heard that at Grotel\u2019s place, a child went missing.\u201d\u201cYes, without even a trace.\u201d\u201cDamn it! All of this because of one damn witch!\u201d\u201cThey haven\u2019t captured her yet, right?\u201d\u201cThey would have told us as soon as the Witch was caught. This isn\u2019t just a trifling matter.\u201dThe two men insulted Lubella until their faces became red. Everyone else beside them was the same: they were all talking about Lubella. Since Porti was a business city, they were more sensitive to economic matters, and news spread faster.After drinking a bit more, Zich and Hans left the bar. Because they didn\u2019t drink much, they were barely drunk.Hans suddenly asked, \u201cSir Zich, was Lady Lubella really a witch?\u201dZich sternly denied it.\u201cThen, are all of these false rumors, sir?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s likely that the assassination of the Deputy Mayor and Porti\u2019s curse is not a lie. However, it\u2019s common for people to falsely accuse someone to create a scapegoat.\u201d\u201cHow are you so sure it\u2019s a false charge, sir?\u201dIt was because Zich knew that Lubella had worked as a saint before he regressed, but of course, Zich didn\u2019t intend to mention that.\u201cI know that much even without seeing it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHans tried to control his facial muscles to not look at Zich absurdly.\u2018Did this happen before I regressed?\u2019Porti\u2019s Great Curse and Lubella, charged as the Witch\u2014Zich didn\u2019t remember any of these events. But it could also be that Zich just couldn\u2019t remember. Yes, that was most likely. The world before he regressed was an extremely chaotic world where various incidents and problems erupted everywhere with no exceptions.Seeing the darkening sky, Hans got ready to light up his already-prepared torch.\u201cWait.\u201dZich halted and stared at one side of the view in front of him.\u201cHuh? What is it, sir?\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201dHans lit up his torch and trotted behind Zich.Zich went inside an alleyway. Although it was getting dark, there were still traces of lights remaining in the sky. However, the alleyway was a peerless, dark color like it was in the middle of the night. The darkness seemed to hiss threats at the torch light that Hans was carrying.Zich walked inside as if he was in a familiar place, and it happened after they turned another corner.\u201cHuh?\u201dHans saw something. At the alleyway\u2019s dead-end, something was crouching in the corner. Hans gulped as he saw the shadow in the shape of a human figure. Thankfully, the lights revealed that the shadow wasn\u2019t a zombie.The figure looked at Zich and Hans with a look of worry and fear.\u201cYou were here, Lady Lubella,\u201d Zich said while looking at Lubella.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, she looked completely different from a few days ago. Her shining blond hair was gray from dust, and her clean skin was now covered in dirt and mud. Her clothes, which made her look divine before, were ripped and dirtied now, making them look no better than a beggar\u2019s clothes. Her current appearance did not indicate that she was a priestess of Karuwiman in any way.\u201cYou look wretched.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dWith Zich\u2019s words, Lubella bit her lips.She slowly got up and handed something to Zich. It was a white staff with a semi-transparent blue jewel. It was probably a tool that helped increase divinity, but like its owner, the staff was also dirty.\u201cJudging by your reaction, you must also know that you are wanted right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026How were you able to find me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m confident in my senses. I felt a similar presence like yours, Lady Lubella, shivering inside this alleyway, so I came to check.\u201dZich was incredible at detection.Hans and even Lubella were shocked. Hans looked at Zich as if he was a monster. On the other hand, Lubella quickly calmed her emotions.\u201cAre you going to turn me in?\u201dThere was no strength in her voice, but the light in her eyes indicated that she would not be dragged out without a fight.\u201cWill you believe me if I say I wouldn\u2019t?\u201dLubella was not able to reply.A quiet tension passed between them and then suddenly\u2014Growwl!A huge sound rang out from Lubella\u2019s stomach. Because no one was speaking, the sound from Lubella\u2019s stomach sounded like rolling thunder. Lubella\u2019s cheeks began to flush.\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s eat first.\u201dLubella didn\u2019t say anything for a few moments, but eventually, she nodded.* * *Even though Zich decided to bring Lubella with them, it still didn\u2019t change the fact that she was a wanted person charged with serious crimes such as the \u2018assassination of the Deputy Mayor\u2019 and \u2018casting a Great Curse on Porti.\u2019Zich ordered Hans to go back before him.Hans looked back and forth between Lubella and Zich with worry in his eyes, but soon, he left while carrying a torch. The two waited for a few more minutes to pass by, and silence passed between them before Lubella commented, \u201c\u2026You are not asking me anything.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to ask, but only after we get out of this situation first.\u201dZich lifted his head and stared at the sky. Fortunately, the moon and stars were covered by clouds like the past few days.\u201cLet\u2019s start moving.\u201d\u201cAlready? Isn\u2019t it better for us to wait a bit more?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay because there\u2019s not a lot of people walking around at night these days. It\u2019s all thanks to \u2018Witch Aine Lubella.\u2019\u201dLubella glared at Zich, and he shrugged in reply. They carefully trod out of the alleyway. Lubella nervously checked the surrounding area for people.\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t see anything.\u201dThe city was so dark that it was impossible to perceive even nearby objects. In this situation, it was difficult to see the way to their destination, and it was easy to receive a lot of injuries from bumping into buildings or random objects. Normally, Lubella would have just used her holy powers to support her eyesight, but she didn\u2019t have enough energy from starving and lacking sleep for the past few days.Grab!Something suddenly grabbed Lubella\u2019s hand. It was rough and large, but it was a warm hand.\u201cI will do most of the guiding. Please be careful while following me.\u201dLubella quietly looked at Zich\u2019s hand and replied, \u201cAlright.\u201dZich focused his mana on his eyes. With this control, the completely opaque view in front of him became visible. Zich began to lead Lubella towards their destination. Fortunately, the wind was blowing strongly, so they did not have to watch their footsteps. However, because Lubella was basically blind, her footsteps were slow.\u201cDid you focus your mana on your eyes?\u201d\u201cYou know about it?\u201d\u201cI have seen the Holy Knights use a similar skill.\u201dWith this statement, Lubella closed her mouth again. She probably was thinking about the Holy Knights who had protected her. Judging by her reaction, they probably weren\u2019t in a good situation.\u2018They are probably all dead.\u2019Zich also didn\u2019t say anything and silently guided Lubella.\u201cShh!\u201d Zich whispered to Lubella.Lubella instinctively put her hands over her mouth, and Zich carefully moved while leading her. After they went around the alleyway a few times, they stuck closely towards the wall.Clank! Clank! Clank!Lubella\u2019s eyes widened at the sound of rattling metal. It was probably one of the city\u2019s security guards. From a distance, faint lights brightened up the alleyway. The lights felt like flashlights searching for her whereabouts, so Lubella cautiously moved one step a time to an area far away from the light. The bright light began to dim as she slowly moved away. The sound of clinking metal also faded.Phew!When all the lights and sounds disappeared, Lubella let out a sigh of relief.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dZich grabbed Lubella and began leading her again.* * *The place they arrived at was Zich\u2019s lodging. From the inside, a faint light was seeping out, and Zich could feel the presence of someone on the first floor. This meant that they couldn\u2019t use the front door, and Zich looked around the building.Zich and Hans\u2019 lodging were on the 3rd floor.\u201cOver there,\u201d Zich whispered as he saw a closed wooden window on the 3rd floor.\u201cPlease wait a moment.\u201dAfter telling Lubella this, Zich threw a small stone he found on the ground.Clack!After a few moments, the window opened and Hans appeared in view.\u201cPlease hold on tightly.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dZich ignored Lubella\u2019s question and lifted her.\u201cKyaa!\u201dLubella let out a quiet scream, but she tightly held Zich\u2019s neck. In this state, Zich began to walk towards the building\u2019s walls. Then he shifted his mana into his legs and put force into them.Zoom!It all happened in a moment. With ease, Zich jumped to the 3rd floor. From across the window, Zich saw Hans\u2019 surprised face.Bang!While holding the windowsill, Zich pushed himself and Lubella inside.\u201cAre both of you alright?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m alright,\u201d Zich replied to Hans\u2019 concerning question.\u201cI-I\u2019m also alright.\u201dFeeling a bit more relieved now, Lubella replied a little bit more comfortably. Hans also felt relieved after hearing both of their replies.\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. For now, please sit down comforta\u2026\u201dHans could not finish his sentence because he was startled by the ferociousness in Lubella\u2019s eyes. Her eyes were almost mad. Fortunately, she was not staring at Hans, but a bowl of food placed on a small table in the corner of the room.\u201cHah! I guess it can\u2019t be helped if the Holy Priestess of Karuwiman is hungry.\u201d\u201cWhat? N-no, this is\u2026!\u201dLubella blushed bright red and began making excuses. Then, she closed her mouth and began twisting her body. Zich thought she seemed embarrassed by her behavior, but even then, Lubella could not stop stealing glances at the food. As a final blow, Lubella\u2019s stomach let out another growl again, and she collapsed onto the floor.\u201cYou should eat it. We prepared the food for you anyways. You must have had no time to eat while being on the run.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dEven if she wanted to refuse, her stomach was so famished that it almost felt hollow. While shaking, Lubella moved towards the food.\u201cThen I will be leaving again.\u201d\u201cWhat? Where are you going?\u201d Hans asked Zich who was already halfway outside the window.\u201cJust in case, I should leave an alibi by going through the front entrance. I have to make the store owner and other people think I came into the room by myself.\u201dZich put both of his feet outside the window and then turned his head back.\u201cWhen I jump down, make sure to close the window.\u201dWith these words, Zich jumped out.* * *After making sure that the store owner saw him, Zich walked up to his room as if nothing was going on.Knock! Knock!\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dAfter knocking on the door and speaking, the door cracked open. Hans made sure the person was Zich, then he opened the door fully. The first thing Zich\u2019s eyes landed on was Lubella, who was eating. Nothing much was prepared for her\u2014a simple soup, bread, and a few vegetables. But Lubella ate as if she was eating the tastiest food in the world, and after a few moments, the food quickly disappeared.Scrape!Lubella put her spoon down only after scraping the very bottom of her soup bowl. She let out a small burp and quickly closed her mouth. Hans looked as if his ideal fantasy or whatever else was shattered, but Zich ignored him and walked towards Lubella.\u201cThen can you tell me what happened?\u201d\u201cBefore that, can you tell me about the rumors that are spreading about me in the city?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not hard for me to tell you. In the city, rumors that you assassinated the Deputy Mayor and cast a curse on Portia have spread. There\u2019s even a well-drawn wanted poster of you. Do you want to see it?\u201dFrom his clothes, Zich took out a piece of paper. Lubella took the wanted poster and glared at it as if she was going to rip it apart.\u201c\u2026Where did you get this?\u201d\u201cI got it because I thought you might be curious about your portrait.\u201dIt was hard to understand Zich\u2019s state of mind. Hans shook his head at Zich\u2019s remarks.Lubella put force into her hands so that the edges of the wanted poster crinkled under her hands.\u201cIt\u2019s not true.\u201d Lubella quietly murmured, \u201cI\u2019m not a witch.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s first hear what happened to you.\u201dZich sat on the chair opposite of Lubella and folded his arms. Lubella slowly started speaking.\u201cAfter hearing what happened to Sude in the store, we went to the Mayor right away.\u201dRandom people could not meet the Mayor, but a Karuwiman priestess was not a \u2018random person.\u2019 She could obviously meet the Mayor if she had a concern. Like the rumors said, one could tell that the Mayor looked greedy with just a glance. The fat under his face made it difficult to decipher the position of his neck, and his beady eyes fervently moved around as if he was trying to sniff out money.On the other hand, his Deputy Mayor looked more suitable. His half-white hair was stylishly pushed back, and his fit body indicated that he was excellent at self-management. Under his sharp eyebrows, his all-knowing eyes seemed to be able to see through anything.\u201cWe said our complaints based on the words from Mr. Sude. We told him that in this city, an illegal and immoral seizing was going on. We also said that someone in the Mayor\u2019s family was involved in this, and that there are also suspicions that the Mayor himself received some bribes.\u201dLubella also included that the Mayor was very taken back by her statements. However, the Deputy Mayor didn\u2019t outrightly show it and seemed to look at the Mayor with disdain. Fortunately, no matter how greedy the Mayor was, he wasn\u2019t able to ignore a warning from a high-ranking follower of Karuwiman. The Mayor replied that he would quickly begin an investigation and try to remedy this problem. However, he strongly denied the claims about receiving bribes from anyone.It was very difficult to trust him, but since he said he would fix this problem right away, Lubella had no choice but to step back. Lubella and her guards decided to go back to their lodgings for now and watch how the situation would unfold, but the Mayor stopped them in their tracks. He formally invited them to his home during the duration of their stay in the city.\u201cDuring that time, I thought he just wanted to be on the good side of Karuwiman and the Church.\u201dAfter a moment of pondering, Lubella accepted the Mayor\u2019s invitation. The purpose of this trip was to see the livelihood of different types of people and listen to a diverse range of viewpoints. So far, she had spent most of her time listening to the poor, the commoners, or people from the lower class; so, she thought this could be an excellent chance to listen to the upper class people. Moreover, she could also spy on the Mayor\u2019s actions.\u201cJust like that, we ended up staying in the Mayor\u2019s mansion for two days. Nothing much happened during this time. However, weird stories began to surface.\u201dThe shine in her eyes sharpened.\u201cThe undead were beginning to appear in the city.\u201dAs a follower of the divine god Karuna, the undead were an existence that they could not tolerate. As soon as she heard about the undead, she went straight to the Mayor. She still felt uncomfortable around the Mayor and thought poorly of him, but this was no time for personal feelings. Lubella and the Holy Knights told him that they would help patrol the city, protect the citizens, and expel the undead.\u201cThe Mayor agreed to our request. He actually welcomed our involvement and told us that he would assign a section for us to patrol. Then, he told us to come to his room around sunset.\u201dThinking back, his actions were suspicious. She should have known then.\u201cWe were weaponless because it would have been a display of hostility to the Mayor while we were staying at his mansion. But that was actually a trap.\u201dWhen they went to his room at the agreed time, they saw the Deputy Mayor on the floor and the Mayor holding a strange book in his hands. And from nowhere, a group of undead began to besiege them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As she remembered what happened, Lubella bowed her head and clutched the ends of her clothes. She stopped talking for a moment, but Zich didn\u2019t urge her to continue.\u201cThe people guarding me continued to fall one after another. There were so many undead, but we were also unprepared for battle.\u201dAs if they proved that they were Karuwiman\u2019s Holy Knights, they managed to ensure Lubella\u2019s escape with everything against them. Afterward, Lubella ran frantically. For the Holy Knights who sacrificed their lives for her and to reveal the Mayor\u2019s wicked deeds, she felt like she had to survive.However, the city was blocked by then, and she was wanted as the Witch. So, she had no choice but to hide in the alleyway. When the day was bright, she hid her body in an abandoned house or a dark alleyway and only moved at nighttime.Of course, since she couldn\u2019t eat or rest properly, her face became haggard. Lubella had grown up like a flower in a greenhouse, and this was her first time going out to see the world. In the end, her holy powers ran out and she couldn\u2019t even brighten up her night vision; she could only move if the moon and stars were in the sky.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that you met me then.\u201dLubella nodded to Zich\u2019s words.\u201cDid Sir Weig also die at the time?\u201d\u201cNo, I parted ways with Sir Weig as soon as we arrived in this city. The Church gave him a different mission, and we have been moving separately for some time.\u201d\u2018Of course. There\u2019s no way the Killing Machine would die so easily.\u2019Zich understood.\u201cThen what are you going to do now?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not sure.\u201dHer opponent was the city\u2019s most powerful figure, the Mayor, and Lubella didn\u2019t have anything at the moment except her body.\u201cCan\u2019t you ask for help from Karuwiman?\u201dHans interrupted with caution, but Lubella shook her head.\u201cSince the city is blocked, I can\u2019t contact headquarters or any subdivision. Even if I do contact them, it will take a while for them to receive the message. Furthermore, the Karuwiman temple in this city doesn\u2019t have much power, and even that is under heavy surveillance.\u201dAlthough Karuwiman had incredible influence, their power was concentrated in their headquarters and a few subdivisions. No king, royal, or noble liked to let the Church\u2019s power reside in their land.\u201cNormally, if we need military support from the Church, we can contact the nearest religious order or an important subdivision, and headquarters will receive the message and send out brigades of the Church. The problem is that this place is very far from the points of contact.\u201d\u201cThat means there are no forces that can protect Lady Lubella right now.\u201dLubella nodded at Zich\u2019s words.\u201cThen, let\u2019s escape out of the city first. I will take you to the nearest subdivision of the Church.\u201dThat seemed better than handing her over to the city\u2019s security forces, but Lubella shook her head.\u201cAh, we can\u2019t!\u201dAt her firm refusal, both Zich and Hans stared at her strangely.\u201cWe don\u2019t have time! We have to stop the Mayor right now!\u201d\u201cStop what?\u201d\u201cThe ritual!\u201d\u201cRitual?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dLubella didn\u2019t say enough for them to grasp the entire situation. Of course, Hans couldn\u2019t understand, but Zich was able to figure out something.\u201cIs the Mayor planning to do a ritual with grave consequences?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cHow large is the scale?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably going to involve the whole city!\u201dZich glanced at Lubella\u2019s wanted poster that was on the table. Its center was crumpled, but the words were still legible.Responsible for the assassination of the Deputy Mayor, and\u2026\u2018Attempted to cast a Great Curse on the city of Porti.\u2019This was a more significant issue than he had thought.\u201cTell me everything you saw and thought.\u201d\u201cI remember the cover of the book that the Mayor was holding onto when he revealed his true colors. It was definitely an item from Bellid.\u201dBellid was a religious group with the opposite characteristics of Karuwiman. Its followers served the evil god, Bellu, and engaged in slaughter and terrorist actions to fulfill their craving for destruction and chaos.\u2018Those fucking bastards are a part of this?\u2019In a way, most people would have thought that Demon Lord Zich would have gotten along well with a group like that, but it was the opposite in reality. Bellid acted on the principle that they had to conquer the world and offer it to their god. There was no way that Demon Lords, who liked to work however they wanted, would agree with Bellid\u2019s methods.As expected, Bellid and Demon People often clashed, and of course, Zich was often caught up in it.Lubella continued, \u201cEven at a glance, that book was stored with some dark energy. It felt sickening as if Bellu had contaminated it. At first, I thought it was an artifact that increased the owner\u2019s skills, but that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201dThe room that Lubella coincidentally saw while escaping revealed the book\u2019s true identity.\u201cIn the room, there was a stone statue. That violent and hideous appearance definitely belonged to Bellu\u2014but that\u2019s not the problem. It wouldn\u2019t have been such a problem if the statue was just in the shape of Bellu\u2019s vile form, but it exuded a similar energy to the book. And there were also writings on the statue\u2019s stand.\u201dIt was written in Bellid\u2019s ancient and sacred language, but Lubella could read it. Since Karuwiman and Bellid always clashed against each other, they knew each other well.\u201cIt said, \u2018I offer this city to Bellu.\u2019\u201dEven Zich was aware of that phrase, and he knew when and where it was used.\u201cSo, you are saying that those guys are planning to sacrifice this city as an offering to Bellu. And that book is a catalyst to ignite the statue\u2019s power?\u201d\u201cYou know about it?\u201d\u201cYes, I know a bit about the group.\u201dThe \u2018City Offering Ritual\u2019 was a ritual where followers stationed Bellu\u2019s statue in different parts of the city and injected people\u2019s life force into these places.\u201cBut these guys are taking a huge risk. Usually, they target a small village or a small city that is difficult to differentiate from a village. How could they target a city like Porti?\u201d\u201cI think so too, but if they succeed in performing this ritual\u2026\u201d\u201cThis city will become a city of the dead, and they will gain power that matches its scale.\u201dBellid completed the \u2018City Offering Ritual\u2019 for three reasons: first, it was to make the city\u2019s entire population into the undead and increase their army. The second was to please the god they served, Bellu. And lastly, it was to\u2026\u2018To take away all the residents\u2019 life force. If they succeed in stealing energy from this many people, they will gain a tremendous amount of power.\u2019A great calamity would befall these surroundings, and there was no way that those Bellid guys would use their power for good. But\u2014\u2018Well, it will suck for the people around here.\u2019Zich\u2019s sentiments ended there. In the first place, he was a human who was not that different from Bellid.\u2018But I\u2019d hate to see those guys gaining things from this situation.\u2019Even though they had been enemies before Zich regressed, if they were nice guys, Zich could have thought along the lines of, \u2018I have decided to live a kind life, so I guess what is good is good.\u2019 But, these guys were not even like that.\u201cIf I recall the amount of Bellu\u2019s energy in the catalyst, it seems like we don\u2019t have much time before the ritual is complete! We don\u2019t have time to request support from a subdivision! We have to stop the ritual right now!\u201d\u201cIn your condition?\u201dAt Zich\u2019s cold remarks, Lubella was at a loss for words. But Zich didn\u2019t think that she could adequately stop this event with her current state. She couldn\u2019t even have a proper meal and had been in hiding like a beggar for a while now.\u201cI can\u2019t sit and stand by that thought! The only one who knows what will happen is me! If things progress like this, a countless number of people will die for sure!\u201d\u201cBut this is also something you can\u2019t fix.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dLubella glared at Zich, but she hung her head low. Zich hadn\u2019t said anything wrong, and feelings of uselessness coiled around her.\u201cBut let me ask you this.\u201dLubella raised her head slightly at Zich\u2019s words.\u201cStopping this is also a kind act, right?\u201dShe was surprised.\u201cA-are you going to help us?\u201d\u201cIf it is a kind act.\u201dLubella\u2019s face lightened up and then darkened again.\u201cBut I also can\u2019t get someone else involved in something so dangerous\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is my advice, but get off your high horse.\u201dLubella\u2019s eyes widened. Even Hans, who was listening next to them, looked surprised. But Zich arrogantly crossed his arms and raised his jaws while leaning his back against a chair. Then, he coldly spat, \u201cWhat are you going to do by yourself? You haven\u2019t been able to eat or sleep properly and have been hiding as a homeless person for the past few days\u2014what do you think you can do?\u201dLubella\u2019s head drooped lower again.\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t found you, you would have starved to death in a nameless alleyway or would have been caught by an officer. Or a resident might have found you, and you would have been disgraced as the Witch who drove this city into a nightmare.\u201d\u201cUm, Sir Zich. I think this is enough\u2026\u201dBecause Zich seemed to be talking too harshly, Hans tried to stop him warily, but Zich didn\u2019t stop.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to get someone else involved? How is that different from wanting to leave this situation as it is? Because of your great sense of justice, are you going to watch this city fall into danger? That\u2019s amazing.\u201dEven before Zich regressed, there were many people like Lubella. Without concern for their own bodies, they jumped in to fight against injustice and save people. In a world that fell into chaos, those kinds of people stood out more than in regular times.Zich didn\u2019t hold a particular dislike for those types of people. Surprisingly, Zich was open-minded, and as a person who lived however he wanted, he didn\u2019t mind people\u2019s different ways of living. He went by the philosophy: \u2018I am me, and others are others.\u2019However, that didn\u2019t mean that he acknowledged everyone\u2019s way of life. Zich could nod his head, thinking, \u2018It\u2019s understandable why they thought that,\u2019 especially if someone acted with enough power and knowledge backing them and failed. But Zich couldn\u2019t understand those who just said plausible things without any power and knowledge behind them.No, it was acceptable to that point. Even without power and knowledge, it took courage to go against death; although Zich couldn\u2019t understand those who followed what they said even while knowing that they had a 100% chance of dying, he could accept it as one of the characteristics of that person.The real problem was with people like Lubella. Those types of people said that they didn\u2019t want to drag someone unrelated into the problem or had to maintain morals or fight fairly. If the decision only affected them, Zich would have understood.But if they were like Lubella right now and insisted on following their moral ground when they couldn\u2019t do anything by themselves and were in a situation where others would be harmed if things failed, Zich couldn\u2019t accept their way of thinking no matter what.\u201cYou should think hard with that pure head of yours\u2014what is the right thing to do.\u201dLubella gripped her fist tightly. She grabbed it so tightly that it became colorless, and some time passed.\u2018I knew that she was inexperienced, but was she this pathetic during this time?\u2019No, the Saint might have been like this even before he regressed; the situation was so frustrating.\u2018Well, I will let her do what she wants.\u2019Zich was about to loosen his arms when\u2014Swish!Lubella raised her head. Her eyes, which seemed to stare at Zich deeply, were filled with determination.\u201cI will just ask you one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAre you strong? Strong enough to help me in this situation?\u201d\u2018Look at this?\u2019Zich\u2019s eyes sparkled as he looked at her with curiosity. He stopped himself from getting up and crossed his arms again.\u2018She is not dwelling in her guilt anymore, but is trying to make sure of my skills?\u2019It wasn\u2019t bad. No, her assessment of the situation was outstanding. Without power or knowledge, one was useless in this situation, and this also applied to Zich who had suggested to help.Zich looked at the empty plate and fork in front of Lubella. Sitting next to Lubella, Hans tilted his head. Zich lightly drew with the spoon.Split!The table cracked into two, and both Lubella and Hans\u2019 eyes widened in shock.Drop! Dro-drop!The utensils on the table fell to the ground, and the wooden table collapsed. Thankfully, Lubella had eaten everything on her plate, so the ground didn\u2019t become a mess. And both Lubella and Hans weren\u2019t even bothered about that; they were too busy staring at the wooden spoon that Zich was holding.\u201cI think I will be of enough help.\u201dIn a daze, Lubella nodded her head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLubella rested the whole day. She wasn\u2019t able to sleep at all from constantly hiding and running around, so she needed as much rest as possible.When it turned dark, Zich and Lubella went out of their lodging. After carrying Lubella out through the window and putting her down first, Zich went back inside the room and went out through the front door. To their good fortune, the moon and stars were covered by clouds, and Zich held Lubella\u2019s hands as they went through the darkness and headed towards the Mayor\u2019s mansion.\u201cIt\u2019s over there,\u201d Lubella whispered while pointing towards a mansion.As expected, the mansion was enormous. Expensive and exotic plants lined the yard and surrounded a three-floor structure. There were over a dozen windows in the mansion. As if to display the owner\u2019s wealth, the mansion was expensive as it was picturesque.Zich looked at the Mayor\u2019s mansion. Prior to the day, Zich had surveyed the grounds nearby, so he had seen the mansion before.\u201cWait a moment here.\u201dZich left Lubella for a bit and jumped on a roof nearby; from there, he looked around the mansion. Seeing the sight in front of him, his eyes narrowed in suspicion.Lamps were planted all around the yard; there was even a magic lamp, so the mansion shone brightly. Guards could also be seen in the yard. All of this was not strange. There was that recent incident with Lubella, and it was the Mayor\u2019s house after all, so having guards to protect the mansion was not strange.\u2018But there are too few guards. It also seems like there aren\u2019t any guards who can control mana.\u2019He also had the same suspicion when he saw the mansion during the day. Zich went down from the roof and told Lubella what he saw. Then he asked her, \u201cWere there only a few guards from the start?\u201d\u201cI-I can\u2019t really remember.\u201dLubella put down her head in remorse, but Zich did not blame her. As a candidate to become the next Saint, Lubella was just starting to gain experience in the outside world; it was unreasonable to expect her to remember the number of guards in a person\u2019s house. Zich only asked just in case.\u201cLet\u2019s first try going in.\u201d\u201cWill it be alright? Wasn\u2019t there something off?\u201d\u201cWell, it seems like a trap could be waiting for us.\u201d\u201cT-then should we not go in?\u201dLubella was shocked at Zich\u2019s almost bored tone.\u201cWell, if we had a bit more leeway, we could step back and watch the situation a bit more and adjust our plans accordingly\u2026but we don\u2019t have this leeway, right?\u201d\u201cY-yes.\u201d\u201cEven if there is a trap, we have to go in anyway, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, you are right.\u201dLubella\u2019s eyes shook in nervousness. Fear and hesitation twisted and shook her heart. However, in the end, what took over her heart were firm determination and strong will.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dSeeing her change in heart, Zich let out a small smile.\u2018As expected, I can see glimpses of her future self.\u2019Thinking back on it, the most bothersome and annoying figure in the Hero Party was Lubella.\u2018In battle, you really have to kill the healer first.\u2019But that was the end to Zich\u2019s recollection. Zich focused on the present and commented, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry too much. We are not going in recklessly.\u201dZich patted Lubella\u2019s back to calm her down. When she seemed to calm down a bit, he lifted her over his shoulders.\u201cAh!\u201dAbout to let out a scream in shock, Lubella quickly clamped her mouth.\u201cW-what are you doing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because we are going to sneak into the mansion now. This is more comfortable.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s like I\u2019m baggage!\u201d\u201cYou are baggage. At least for now.\u201dLubella glared at Zich, but he ignored her. He moved through the darkness and trod towards the mansion.Tap!With his light foot movements, his whole body soared. Lubella held onto Zich\u2019s neck tightly. Even though she experienced this every time they went in and out of their lodging, she was still not used to Zich\u2019s jumps. After Zich landed on a soft patch of grass while hardly making a sound, he looked around.\u2018There are no guards around here, and there\u2019s not even a person checking out the window.\u2019Without hesitation, Zich kept moving forward. He used the shrubs, trees, and statues to keep himself hidden from the constantly moving guards. Lubella watched Zich with surprise as he swiftly moved around. Finally, they reached one of the mansion\u2019s windows; the wooden window was sealed tightly shut. With one hand, Zich adjusted the arm he was holding Lubella with, and he took out a dagger with the other hand. Then he pushed the dagger in through the window.Snap!After a light cutting sound, the window eased open without further protest. Zich went inside the window, and after putting Lubella down, he closed the window again. He picked up a lock that had fallen, twisted it into a 90-degree angle, and used it to close the window as if he was sewing two frames together. The window was securely shut once more.\u201cI think you can rest easy for now. Nobody is near us.\u201d\u201cWhen you told me that you lived a rough life, did it mean that you were a thief before?\u201d\u201cWhy? Did I sneak into the house too naturally?\u201d\u201cYes. At this rate, I would believe it if you told me that you were a master thief.\u201d\u201cI used to be a noble.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t lie.\u201dLubella made a straight face.\u201cThe crime of impersonating a noble is worth the death penalty.\u201d\u201cWhen we are done with all of this, try investigating Zich Steelwall from the Steelwall family. You will probably find some interesting information.\u201d\u201cSteelwall?\u201dEven Lubella knew about the Steelwall family. They were some of the most renowned aristocrats in the Kingdom.\u2018And he\u2019s saying that he is Zich Steelwall?\u2019By using Steelwall as his last name, that meant he was one of the Lord\u2019s family members. Thus, there was a high chance that Zich was directly related to the Count of Steelwall.Moreover, the person who Lubella thought was a thief a moment ago had never revealed his last name so far. He also had the amazing skill of cutting a small table in half with a wooden spoon.\u201cWait a moment! Are you really a noble? And a Steelwall one at that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you to try investigating later on. There are more urgent matters right now.\u201dZich lightly tapped Lubella\u2019s shoulders.\u201cSince we were able to enter the mansion successfully, now it\u2019s your turn. Try to remember the location of the Mayor\u2019s room.\u201dAt Zich\u2019s words, Lubella shook herself back to reality. As Zich said, it was not time for her to satisfy her curiosity about small matters.\u201cPlease follow me.\u201dLubella began to lead Zich carefully. Since the hallways were thickly carpeted, their footsteps made almost no sound. If there were people nearby, Zich would sense their presence and carry Lubella to a nearby room until they disappeared. Zich could easily cut through all the door locks with his dagger, and after they made significant progress like this, Lubella stopped at a specific door.\u201cIt\u2019s here. Bellu\u2019s statue was stored here.\u201dZich glared at the door. There was no human presence inside the room. However\u2026\u201cThere is an annoying feeling about this room.\u201dTo prove that Karuwiman and Bellid\u2019s followers were like oil and water, Lubella uncharacteristically remarked in a cynical voice, \u201cWell, all Bellid people are annoying.\u201dZich opened the door. The light from the hallway slowly seeped in through the door and into the room. And with the brightness, \u2018that thing\u2019 appeared. Its face resembled that of a fish and had two sets of horns on the sides of its face, top and bottom, totaling to four horns. The body was muscular, and there were webs on the statue\u2019s hands and feet. Its long, piercing eyes gave off the atmosphere of a starving beast, and they dared anyone to come inside to be slaughtered in an instant.\u201cBellid looks like a stupid fish head as usual.\u201d\u201cYes. Stupid Bellid people worship a stupid god like themselves.\u201dLubella added on her own insults to Zich\u2019s mockery. Since Bellid was the evil god of water, many parts of his appearance manifested it. So, a nickname that stuck with him was fish head. Of course, the followers of Bellid despised this nickname.Zich approached the statue. Since Zich did not have holy powers like Lubella, he did not have the ability to recognize if the dirty aura of Bellu was on the statue right away. However, if he directly touched the statue, he could find the information he wanted.Put!Zich put his hands on the statue and lightly imbued it with his mana. The statue reacted, and Zich\u2019s body shivered.\u2018It\u2019s a horrifying feeling no matter many times I feel it.\u201dIt felt something like touching a fish that had been rotting for several days or swimming in a filthy pool.Zich let go of the statue and said, \u201cIt feels so dirty. It would actually be better if it was scary or dangerous instead. I feel like I\u2019m rolling around in a rotting trash can.\u201d\u201cAhah! That\u2019s a great expression!\u201dLubella\u2019s eyes sparkled. It seemed as if the best way to gain this future Saint\u2019s trust was not only to perform acts of kindness but verbally attack followers of Bellid without mercy.\u201cBut anyway, with this, we can now be sure that followers of Bellid are a part of this.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t believe me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just making sure. There is a possibility that you could have been tricked.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t ever mistake Bellid\u2019s aura.\u201dLubella sullenly replied to Zich\u2019s statement.\u201cLet\u2019s go look for the Mayor first. It seems like this is the main statue for the ritual; it would have been possible to cancel the ritual early on, but it\u2019s now impossible to do so without a great amount of force. The only way we can stop the ritual is to destroy the catalyst.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. Alright, I understand.\u201dThey left the room. But Lubella looked regretful that they could not destroy the statue right away, and her eyes were glued to the statue for a long time.They began sneaking around the mansion again. In the same way that they found the room with Bellid\u2019s statue, they soon reached the Mayor\u2019s room. The Mayor\u2019s door was red and enormous with elaborate decorations. Anyone could have seen that it was the Mayor\u2019s room.\u201cThis is it.\u201d\u201cYeah, it looks like it. The carpet is new.\u201dIt seemed like they had changed the blood-soaked carpets with new ones.\u201cWill he be inside?\u201d\u201cI can feel a presence inside.\u201dZich and Lubella\u2019s eyes met and they nodded together.Swing!Zich took out his sword, and Lubella fixed her grip on her staff.Thud!Zich opened the door and entered the room first. Lubella followed right behind him. A small number of candle lights lit up the room, but their few lights were nowhere near enough to brighten up the whole room. Rather than brightening up the room, the shimmering and shivering light only made the atmosphere more ominous.The room looked as if it was built to be used as an office and a reception space. In one corner of the room, there was an expensive table and chair used for business; and on another side of the room, there was a big wooden table and comfortable looking chairs around it. There were also many fancy decorations on the walls.From the right side of the entrance, there was another door on the wall\u2014that seemed to lead to the Mayor\u2019s bedroom. However, they didn\u2019t need to bother going into the Mayor\u2019s bedroom and find him there.Because there was a person looking at Zich and Lubella with an arrogant attitude from his seat. He was dressed in fancy clothing and was severely overweight.\u201cHe is the Ma\u2026!\u201dZich acted faster than Lubella\u2019s warnings.Swing!His swings were really like the wind. Zich cut through the room at a moment\u2019s notice. He climbed up the table and pointed his sword at the Mayor\u2019s neck and stopped there. It took him less time to do all this than for someone to blink their eyes.\u201c\u2026Your\u2026\u201dEven before Lubella finished her sentence, the situation was already over. Her words disappeared into thin air with no real purpose.\u201cAre you the Mayor? The main leader of Bellid\u2019s followers?\u201d Zich asked, and the Mayor\u2019s glass-like eyes began to move towards him.\u201cDon\u2019t give him time! If he speaks, the undead will come to us in hoards!\u201dLubella ran to where Zich was and urged him to punish the Mayor. However, Zich didn\u2019t move his sword, and he made eye contact with the Mayor.Sigh~!After letting out a sigh, Zich got up from the table and removed his sword from the Mayor\u2019s neck.\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d Lubella shouted out in surprise. Zich shook his head in refusal.\u201cWe got the wrong person.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThis human is not the cause for these happenings.\u201dSlice!Zich lightly swung his sword and cut off the Mayor\u2019s head. The Mayor\u2019s body began to grow limp. At this frightening sight, Lubella closed her eyes for a few moments, but she soon opened her eyes and stared at Zich\u2014the words he had said could not be ignored.\u201cWhat do you mean we got the wrong person? What does that mean\u2026!\u201dZich suddenly moved. He moved as if he was the light, but his movements were as fluid as water as he cut through the air.Snap!A light cutting sound could be heard, and it was at that moment\u2014Kyaaaahhhh!It was a terrifying scream that sounded as if it came straight from hell, full of resentment and hate. Lubella closed her ears with her hands, but this was not very helpful. The scream sounded like it was right inside her head. But even at this moment, Lubella did not close her eyes. She saw something fly past in a jiff, and this \u2018thing\u2019 went past Lubella and headed towards the room\u2019s entrance.Thud!A man popped out from nowhere and grabbed the flying object. Then, Lubella saw the man frown and looked at the object in his hands.\u201cHuh?\u201dLubella\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. The man was someone she knew from before.\u201cMr. Deputy Mayor?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZich stood in front of Lubella and asked, \u201cIs he the Deputy Mayor?\u201d\u201cYes, he is the Deputy Mayor for sure. But how? I thought you died.\u201dThe Deputy Mayor didn\u2019t respond to Lubella\u2019s question and continued to scowl as he stared at the item in his hands. It was a book.\u201cThat is\u2026!\u201dLubella was astounded because she was familiar with the book that the Deputy Mayor was holding.\u201cThe book that has Bellu\u2019s energy\u2026\u201d\u201cIts official name is \u2018Offering Ritual\u2019s Key,\u2019 Lady Lubella,\u201d the Deputy Mayor corrected as he closed the book. His voice was soft and comfortable, but Zich noticed twisted emotions behind it.\u201cSorry? What are you talking about\u2026!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you get it?\u201dZich patted Lubella\u2019s back.\u201cWe have made the wrong conclusion. The Mayor isn\u2019t Bellu\u2019s servant but a puppet. He lost his senses and was just following someone else\u2019s commands.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2014!\u201dLubella thought the Mayor was the mastermind behind everything, so she was in shock. She looked at the Mayor\u2019s head that was carelessly rolling in the corner and looked at Zich again.\u201cThen, who\u2026?\u201dLubella didn\u2019t finish her sentence and slowly turned her head. Then, her eyes rested on the Deputy Mayor. Even if she was slow at grasping the situation because of her lack of experience, she realized it.\u201cIs it\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. He is probably the mastermind.\u201dWhile scratching his neck, Zich pointed at the Deputy Mayor with the end of his chin. In response, the Deputy Mayor furrowed his eyes and stared at him.\u201c\u2026You did this, right?\u201dThe Deputy Mayor opened the book which he had called the Offering Ritual\u2019s Key and showed the insides. Chilling writings were scrawled on the pages like they were casting curses, but some of the pages were ripped perfectly in half, which lessened the scariness.\u201cYou suddenly jumped out, so I swung my sword instinctively. I apologize, but I have the ripped pages here.\u201dZich stamped on a nearby page with his feet and kicked it towards the Deputy Mayor. However, the page didn\u2019t fly to the Deputy Mayor and flailed in the air at Zich\u2019s multiple kicks and landed back on the ground again. Both Zich and the Deputy Mayor didn\u2019t look at the pages.\u201c\u2026It seems like this little rat hasn\u2019t realized the situation he\u2019s in yet.\u201d\u201cProbably a hundred times better than you think.\u201dZich hung his sword on his shoulder and stared down at the Deputy Mayor with his chin raised and posture crooked. There wasn\u2019t an ounce of fear that the enemy had captured them. Thanks to that, Lubella, whose heart raced with surprise and fear, was able to calm her nerves.\u201cLet me ask this first\u2014what did you do with the Holy Knights?\u201d\u201cDid you think that they would still be alive?\u201dLubella\u2019s eyes shook as their conversation went back and forth.Then, the Deputy Mayor\u2019s eyes moved to Lubella. On his face, there was a fishy smile.\u201cI finely ground their corpses and fed them to the pond\u2019s fishes.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dLubella let out a cry, and in her rage, the hand that grasped her staff trembled.\u201cWell, I guess my acting paid off. I was surprised when you escaped, but it\u2019s an even greater surprise that you came back with a talent like this so fast. It might have been dangerous if I got ambushed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018might have been dangerous.\u2019 You would have died for sure.\u201dZich stretched out his thumb and drew a line across his neck. He was obviously indicating that the Deputy Mayor would have died in his hands, and from this provocation, the Deputy Mayor twitched his lips in discomfort.\u201cWho are you? Why are you working with the Karuwiman saint candidate? Are you some kind of Karuwiman secret service or force?\u201d\u201cNot at all!\u201dZich cleanly denied it. The thought of being part of the Karuwiman\u2019s secret force chilled him. Even though he was developing a new relationship with Karuwiman in this life, he had no intention of joining Karuwiman.\u2018And it will never happen even in the future.\u2019\u201cThen, why?\u201d\u201cBecause I wanted to do a good deed.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d the Deputy Mayor asked again. In his perspective, it was an unthinkable answer. However, Zich expanded his chest even more and confidently declared, \u201cI said, \u2018I wanted to do a good deed.\u2019\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you joined forces with Karuwiman?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201c\u2026You really are out of your mind.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t criticize other people\u2019s way of living, you moron.\u201dZich spat on the ground.\u201cWell, fine. It seems like you are the only force she can mobilize right now. But if you really joined forces with Karuwiman for that reason, how about you join us from now on?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou said that you wanted to do a good deed? This world will be offered to Bellu anyways, which is the only right path for all living creatures in this world. If you really want to do a \u2018good deed,\u2019 supporting the path for Bellu is the real\u2014!\u201d\u201c\u2014You have a lot to say for someone who serves a fish\u2019s head. For someone whose intelligence is similar to that of a fish like the god you serve, you shouldn\u2019t talk for too long. If you talk for a bit more, you will be unable to keep up with your inferior intelligence and get tongue-tied.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t glare at me too much. I am just saying this in good faith. Isn\u2019t it a fact that everyone in the world knows that your god and his followers have the same intelligence level as a fish\u2019s head\u2014is stupid, to say the least? You can only progress if you accept your faults.\u201d\u201cHmph! Pfft pfft!\u201dFrom his side, a stifled laugh leaked out. Lubella had been coldly glaring at the Deputy Mayor, and she was keeping herself from laughing out loud at Zich\u2019s delightful remarks.\u201c\u2026If you want to die that much, I will let you. No, if I consider the price for damaging this key, I will not let you have an easy death. Beg for forgiveness to Bellu for your sins as you suffer.\u201dThe Deputy Mayor lifted his book. Dark mana exuded out from the book and enclosed the surroundings. Then, the Deputy Mayor took a step backward and moved away from the door. Simultaneously, something began to flow into the room and fill it.\u201cIt\u2019s the undead.\u201dZich raised his sword. He could sense that these creatures were multiplying. It seemed that the Deputy Mayor was continuing to summon them from somewhere.\u201cKill the guy! The girl is useful, so leave her alive!\u201d\u201cBe careful, Mr. Zich!\u201dLubella raised her staff and generated holy powers. Her face was full of determination, like she was ready to put her life on the line. On the other hand, Zich was utterly calm.\u201cWhen I see guys like you, I always wonder about one thing.\u201dWhile he was preparing his stance, he murmured, \u201cWhy do you think things will always go your way? Last time, you fucking failed and lost Lubella!\u201dWing!Zich swung his sword. Mana engulfed into his sword\u2019s body like turbulent waves and poured out. The intangible edges of his blade split into dozens and flew out in all directions.Slice! Slice! Slice!The room buzzed with dozens of cutting sounds. Lubella was determined to put her life on the line, and even the Deputy Mayor who had ridiculed them lost his senses as he watched the unrealistic scene before them.However, the Deputy Mayor couldn\u2019t simply stay watching as a sharp slash landed on him.\u201cUgh!\u201dThe Deputy Mayor raised his book, and more energy poured out.Crash!The slash collided against a transparent wall and collapsed futilely, but it was the only one that failed to make its mark.Drop! Drop!Many of the undead fell to the ground at Zich\u2019s successful slashes. It was an impressive skill, but Zich clicked his tongue like he wasn\u2019t satisfied.\u201cAs expected, that book is quite an item.\u201dIn response to Zich\u2019s skills that went beyond his expectations, the Deputy Mayor\u2019s heart thumped. But that lasted for a moment. When Zich showed appreciation for his book, the Deputy Mayor\u2019s chest expanded again.\u201cOf course! Do you think that this artifact, filled with Bellu\u2019s sacred powers, will merely break apart by your attacks\u2014!\u201d\u201c\u2014Ah, never mind.\u201dZich cut off the Deputy Mayor\u2019s words.\u201c\u2026You are insolent until the end. But no matter how much you resist, you can\u2019t escape\u2014!\u201d\u201c\u2014I said, never mind. You can\u2019t even use your powers properly because the book is ruined, right?\u201dZich stomped on the ripped pages on the ground as if he wanted the Deputy Mayor to look at them again.The Deputy Mayor\u2019s forehead wrinkled, but he regained his composure again and said, \u201cI won\u2019t be affected by that much.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then, hurry up and call the advanced types of undead like you did when facing the Holy Knights.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Deputy Mayor couldn\u2019t say anything and gritted his teeth. A considerable number of undead were swarming outside the room, but they were all mid-level. The advanced undead types that had attacked the Holy Knights were nowhere to be found.\u201c\u2026Even if that is the case, if I gather the patrol guards outside\u2014\u201d\u201cThe patrol guards are not on your side though. No, to be exact, they are not on Bellu\u2019s side.\u201dLubella\u2019s face darkened at the thought of the patrol guards, and she asked in surprise, \u201cIs this true?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? The number of patrol guards is small; they also don\u2019t include the knights who can control mana.\u201d\u201cHa, that\u2019s because I was trying to lure in the girl who escaped.\u201dThe Deputy Mayor snorted, but Zich grunted two times louder in the same manner.\u201cOk, then let\u2019s say that you decreased the guards on purpose. Then, what was the purpose of decreasing the number of housekeepers?\u201dIn the daytime, Zich hadn\u2019t only checked out the number of guards; he had checked out the housekeepers wandering in the residence\u2019s gardens and trailed the servants going out to the city to buy water. He had observed their behaviors, eavesdropped on their conversations, and gathered information from the shopkeepers who sold them the goods.\u201cI know because I used to be an aristocrat. They are barely managing to keep the house running with the minimum number of employees. Did you know that they significantly dropped the number of not only soldiers, but the housekeepers as well? It can only mean that they are hiding something, and they\u2019re the ones hiding it.\u201dZich pointed at the undead. This was the reason why he had brought Lubella to this place that was likely a trap: he was planning to involve the residence\u2019s soldiers and housekeepers once the undead came out.Although the Holy Knights had died senselessly from a sudden attack, it was a different situation for Zich. He knew that there were undead roaming inside the residence and had come prepared. It was also possible for him to contact the soldiers for reinforcement while he withstood the undead\u2019s attack; and in the middle of that chaos, Zich could simply escape with Lubella.\u2018Although it is a plan that Lubella will protest against since it uses innocent lives\u2026\u2019That was why he had not informed her of his plan, but it didn\u2019t matter now. It was apparent that the Deputy Mayor had lost the power to stop them with the broken artifact.\u2018It\u2019s good that I handled the artifact from the beginning.\u2019Zich appreciated his reflexes for a moment.\u201cOk, so, you can no longer summon the high-level undead types to cut off our retreat, and if things go wrong, the undead will collide with the soldiers outside and make a commotion. Then, I guess everyone will find out that you, who should be dead, are completely fine and well?\u201d\u201c\u2026Fine. I will admit it. I can\u2019t stop you guys from retreating, but so what? The preparation to offer this city to Bellu is already complete. Didn\u2019t you guys come here to stop that? What can you accomplish by retreating now?\u201dLubella\u2019s body trembled. She wanted to strike her staff on the Deputy Mayor\u2019s fishy face. Unlike Lubella, Zich stayed calm once again. The Deputy Mayor\u2019s face was filled with worry as he wondered if Zich was still hiding something else.\u201cBut the artifact\u2014you know the key you talked about\u2014is broken. It\u2019s impossible to complete the ritual right now. Stop bluffing.\u201d\u201cThe key doesn\u2019t matter with the ritual\u2014\u201d\u201cYou want us to believe that? That\u2019s good. We will escape, and you can complete your ritual then. Make sure you do that, alright?\u201d\u201c\u2026This is only for a moment. It can be restored in no time.\u201d\u201cYou bastard, why are you bluffing even when it won\u2019t work? And for us, even that short amount of time is enough to do something.\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you planning?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think I will do once I get out of here? I am going to search around the city first. Then, I\u2019m going to find the stone statues of Bellu that you have stationed all over the city, and I am going to break each one of them.\u201dThe Deputy Mayor looked like he was going to say something, but Zich didn\u2019t give him a chance to and continued, \u201cOf course, since the ritual is almost complete, destroying the stone statues won\u2019t do anything since their energies have already contaminated the groundwater and are shifting under this city. But do you think that I don\u2019t know? If a follower of Karuwiman completes a certain action on those fish head statues, the power of your ritual will diminish.\u201d\u201cI-is that really true?\u201d\u201cYes, it is. I learned it by coincidence. We can\u2019t push the time of the ritual long enough to get outside help, but we can greatly diminish the power he can control. So, the moment we think he dramatically decreased his power, we can destroy the center of all the statues, which is the statue in this residence. If the ritual\u2019s power diminishes, we will be able to destroy it. We can\u2019t move the central piece of the ritual, so it will be the perfect target.\u201dEven Lubella wasn\u2019t aware of this fact. However, she didn\u2019t doubt Zich\u2019s words, and she rejoiced in her newfound hope. On the contrary, the Deputy Mayor\u2019s face twisted like an evil spirit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! If there was a solution like that, why did you come here instead of searching for the statues around the city?\u201d\u201cBecause we didn\u2019t know how much progress you made with the ritual. How can we be so easygoing when the ritual could happen today? Also, the situation is different now.\u201dZich pointed at the book that the Deputy Mayor was holding.\u201cSince the catalyst is in a state like that, you won\u2019t be able to do the ritual right away. Of course, we wouldn\u2019t be able to buy much time\u2014probably not even a couple of days, but so what? If we find even one statue in that time, the game is over. If we destroy a statue, your power will diminish, and the ritual will get pushed off again. Then, we can use that extra time to continue to find more statues.\u201d\u201cCapture them!\u201dAs if Zich had hit the bull\u2019s eye, the Deputy Mayor ordered all the waiting undead to come forward and opened up his book. But Zich was faster.\u201cThen let\u2019s see each other later!\u201dCrash!As he swung his sword, a huge hole formed on the building\u2019s wall. Then, Zich wrapped his arm around Lubella\u2019s waist and jumped out of the hole. Indeed, the Deputy Mayor must have thought that it would be dangerous to show a scene where a great deal of undead poured out of the Mayor\u2019s house, so none of the undead followed them.\u2018It's too risky to show the saint candidate fighting the undead.\u2019The Deputy Mayor had falsely charged Lubella for summoning the undead and didn\u2019t want to provide the evidence that she was actually an opposing force.\u2018I am going to use this situation to make a greater case against Lubella.\u2019Bump!Zich softly landed on the ground, but he wasn\u2019t completely safe. In front of him, surprised guards had seen Zich and Lubella suddenly jump out of the building.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAn intruder?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Lubella! The Witch, Lubella!\u201d\u201cThe Witch came to attack again!\u201dThe guards found Lubella, and their eyes turned hostile.\u2018Well, look at what will happen.\u2019With this, Lubella\u2019s false charge would worsen, and news that Zich was her companion would spread far and wide.\u2018We will be falsely charged with assassinating the Mayor now too. Actually, is it not a false charge? It\u2019s true that I killed him.\u2019If he thought like that, it could have been better if he hadn\u2019t killed the Mayor. But Zich quickly threw that thought away. At that time, the Mayor was the same as a tool. He was remodeled to handle the book called the \u2018Key\u2019 better than anyone else.\u2018Before my regression, those Bellid guys used this tactic a lot. If the Mayor was alive, the situation would have worsened.\u2019Holding Lubella like some luggage, Zich said, \u201cYou became famous, Lady Lubella. They are welcoming you as the Witch as soon as they see you.\u201d\u201cWho is the man with the Witch?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! He is probably the Witch\u2019s underling or something like that! Don\u2019t let him out!\u201d\u201cWhat? The Witch\u2019s underling? Underling? If I\u2019m being particular, I am the Demon Lord, which is even higher than a witch,\u201d Zich grumbled while fixing his grip on his sword.\u201cM-Mr. Zich! They don\u2019t know anything\u2026!\u201d\u201cI know, Lady.\u201dIf it were a dangerous situation, Zich wouldn\u2019t have bothered to answer, but he was facing trained, ordinary soldiers at most. There was no need to kill them. He slid his sword back into its sheath and lifted his sword in its sheathed form.\u201cPlease tolerate it if I break some of your bones.\u201dThen, he ran towards the guards running at him.The guards\u2019 long poles aimed for him, but Zich smoothly moved between the poles and escaped. Then, as a spear passed by their faces, Lubella let out a small scream.Crack! Crack!\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cUrgh!\u201dOne fell with every strike. Their arms, legs, or armor broke while their bones were smashed under Zich\u2019s hands. The guards in front of them fell to the ground instantly, and a huge opening appeared between them. Without hesitation, Zich ran.His new shoes shone under the sunlight. Other soldiers joined, but Zich and Lubella had already gone over the wall and disappeared.* * *The city was in a mess. The Deputy Mayor was dead, and Lubella, who had tried to curse the city, even succeeded in assassinating the Mayor. As expected, the city\u2019s economy froze even more. The next in line after the Mayor and the Deputy Mayor took the now-empty leadership role, but it wasn\u2019t as same as when the Mayor was still alive. People began to fear that their city\u2019s autonomy would be taken away, and they cursed the Witch and her newly discovered companion.And what the two, receiving all the insults from the city\u2019s residents were doing was\u2026\u201cYeah, it came out well.\u201dZich came out from the cover of the night and stared at the wanted poster of him that was posted next to Lubella\u2019s. Unlike Lubella\u2019s, the drawing of him was a rough outline that lacked in many ways and failed to identify specific characteristics.\u201cEven this sloppy drawing can\u2019t hide my handsomeness. I have to say that my face is quite fine to look at.\u201d Zich swiped his face exaggeratedly and chuckled.\u2018It seems like I\u2019m right, seeing how they drew me. Although the guards couldn\u2019t have seen me properly, that Deputy Mayor saw my face.\u201dEven if he was pretending to be dead, the Deputy Mayor should have had the influence to place a more accurate drawing of Zich\u2019s face on the wanted poster. But if the wanted poster was made this poorly, it could mean that the Deputy Mayor hadn\u2019t intervened in its making process at all.Zich suddenly felt a firelight and the sound of armor clanking from afar.\u201cWhoops! Since I am wanted, I should quickly hide. This reminds me of the old days.\u201dBefore Zich regressed and earned his powers, he had lived hiding most of the time. While reminiscing, Zich skillfully escaped from the guards and moved. He escaped into the inner-city houses for the poor; the worn-out buildings there looked like they were about to crumble at any moment, and a foul stench seeped out of the area.Zich knocked on the door. As promised, he knocked four times in a row, rested, knocked two more times, and rested again before he knocked five times.Creak!The door opened like a frail old man, swallowing back his feeble groans and breaking the deafening silence.\u201cCome in,\u201d Lubella said while searching Zich's surroundings in case a person had trailed Zich. As soon as Zich came in, the door closed.\u201cYou have become a true criminal now, Lady.\u201d\u201cYes, I am thinking about changing careers,\u201d Lubella responded while taking Zich\u2019s luggage. What happened in the past couple of weeks had been so heavy that Lubella\u2019s personality seemed to have grown more relaxed. Lubella searched through the luggage Zich had brought. There were food ingredients inside.\u201cWhere did you get all of this?\u201d\u201cI borrowed them.\u201dZich shrugged. He said he borrowed it, but of course, Lubella couldn\u2019t simply accept that.\u201cYou stole them.\u201d\u201cWell, I can\u2019t make a fair deal right now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dLubella knew that in their situation, it couldn\u2019t be helped. But it didn\u2019t change the fact that her heart felt heavy.\u201cDon\u2019t make a face like that. I didn\u2019t steal.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dZich handed her a slip of paper. On it, names of places, their locations, and items were written all over the page.\u201cThese are the places where I got the items from. When this is all over, we can just pay them all back at once. In short, it\u2019s like a credit\u2014not stealing.\u201d\u201c\u2026To make a credit, don\u2019t you need the owner\u2019s agreement?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t only live by the rules. What about giving them twice the price of the items as an apology?\u201dZich winked. Lubella laughed despondently and nodded.\u201cI am going to write off the credits as a business expense. Is that fine with you?\u201d\u201cI will be grateful if you do that.\u201dZich and Lubella dropped the food items on the rusty table. Although the table looked dirty, since they were in an abandoned house in the slums, they were grateful that there was furniture.While chewing the hard bread, they talked.\u201cWe are going to look for Bellu\u2019s stone statues now, right?\u201d\u201cYes, we have to.\u201d\u201cIs there a method to find them?\u201dEven if they searched all around the city, Porti was large. On top of that, both of them were wanted and couldn\u2019t move freely.\u201cYes, there is a method. Let\u2019s go to the slums first. It\u2019s easier to move there than other places, and I already have a place in mind.\u201d\u201cSounds good.\u201dLubella followed Zich\u2019s suggestion.\u201cBy the way, what happened to the man named Hans? You didn\u2019t just forget\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat guy already left the city some time ago. I ordered him to do something.\u201d\u201cThank goodness.\u201dLubella felt relieved since she worried that the Deputy Mayor might have captured Hans. If he left the city, Hans would at least be safer than them. So, the two finished their meal in silence and prepared for the near future.* * *\u201cHey, hasn\u2019t it been a while?\u201dZich brought Lubella to a small open area. Three people were standing in a reeking area piled with waste and trash. As if he was meeting a familiar acquaintance, Zich waved his hands at the three men and approached them.The three men turned around and scowled as if they all had a bad temper. However, that lasted for only a moment. When they recognized Zich, they became startled.\u201cShit! Run!\u201d\u201cWait, wait! I have something to ask you.\u201dWithout much difficulty, Zich stopped the three from escaping. Lubella checked the men as they hung their heads down low\u2014they lined up neatly in front of Zich and Lubella tilted her head.\u201cWhy? Do you recognize them?\u201d Zich asked.\u201cYes, I feel like I have seen them before.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s when Lady Lubella first met me. These guys were with me when we beat that shopkeeper up.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dLubella thought they looked familiar; they were the thugs she saw in her shocking reunion with Zich. When the three men saw Lubella, their faces filled with dread.\u201cT-the Witch!\u201d\u201cI knew it! He\u2019s the Witch\u2019s underling!\u201d\u201cHuh? Who is the underling?\u201dAll three thugs simultaneously cowered back. But among the three, one glared at Zich and Lubella like he wanted to kill them. He looked like a young man who recently passed his adolescence.\u201cWhat are you here for?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s troubling you, buddy? We bonded while beating up a person in a back alleyway together.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a bonding to brag over, but Lubella held her tongue at Zich\u2019s shamelessness. The thugs also hung their mouths wide open, but Zich simply placed his arms around the young man.\u201cI have something I am curious about. Think you can cooperate with us? We will reward you very well.\u201dZich took out a pouch full of money from his pockets. Zich had money; it was just that he couldn\u2019t strike a deal with people personally in his current situation. Of course, collecting credit was another type of conversation. Besides, after all of this was over, Karuwiman would pay him back for his losses.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t try to save money in a place like this.\u2019Zich thought it was best to encourage them to use their heads on their own free will. Of course, if money didn\u2019t work, Zich thought he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use his fists. The three thugs stared at the pouch full of money. The coins that shone brightly inside the pouch made them dizzy. However, their answer wasn\u2019t satisfactory.\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like that and think about it one more time. It\u2019s not a big deal. Isn\u2019t there anyone who suddenly fell ill or died? Like someone who has suddenly lost their vitality?\u201dThe thugs\u2019 expressions stiffened, and Zich\u2019s eyes sparkled.\u201cYou guys know something, right?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know!\u201d\u201cIt will be better for you guys to just take this money and tell us. I don\u2019t intend to let you guys off now that I know you know something. And, because of our situation, I also intend to use whatever means and methods possible. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s better to take the money rather than go through a lot of pain anyways?\u201dZich put pressure on the arm that he had placed on the top of the young man\u2019s shoulders.\u201cUgh!\u201dThe young man groaned, but in the end, he didn\u2019t open his mouth. So, Zich\u2019s eyes became crueler. He was thinking of all kinds of torture methods\u2014Drop!Lubella kneeled in front of the young man. The slums\u2019 dirty ground dirtied her dress, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind. Everyone\u2019s eyes widened at the sight.\u201cI beg you.\u201d She pleaded, \u201cThis is not for our personal gain. I know you won\u2019t be able to believe us easily, but this city is in great danger right now. At worst, this city could become the city of the dead. Even now, the undead are roaming around the city, but a more terrifying\u2014\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh! This is all because of you guys!\u201d the young man shouted.\u201cI am just telling you beforehand, but we have no relations with those skeleton bastards. Can\u2019t you believe these pure-looking eyes?\u201dZich tried to open his eyes as wide as he could and tried to make an innocent face, but it wasn\u2019t very effective.\u201cYou expect me to believe you with just that! If it weren\u2019t for you guys, my younger brother wouldn\u2019t have\u2026!\u201d\u201cHuh? Your younger brother?\u201dThe young man closed his mouth with an expression that seemed to say, \u2018Oops!\u2019 But Zich had already gotten the information he needed.\u201cOh, so the person we are looking for is your younger brother.\u201dThe young man\u2019s face froze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What more are you going to do to my younger brother!\u201dThe young man resisted desperately, but he couldn\u2019t escape out of Zich\u2019s sturdy arms. He tried to throw punches at Zich\u2019s face, but Zich avoided them with minimum movements or used his other hand to block.The scuffling went on for a while, but in the end, the young man gave up while panting with his reddened face. Thus, Lubella intervened. She was still kneeling on the floor.\u201cWe have no intention to do your brother any harm. We truly want to solve the problems that are going around the city right now. Besides, I might be able to heal your younger brother.\u201d\u201cYou want me to believe that?\u201dWords about Zich and Lubella\u2019s deeds had spread throughout the whole city, and their not-so-great first meeting made the young man doubtful of them.Zich added, \u201cHey, it\u2019s understandable why you can\u2019t trust us. I will lay out the facts so that you can think about your situation more clearly. Isn\u2019t your younger brother in a really bad condition? He probably isn\u2019t hurting in a specific area, but he keeps getting weaker as if he is moving closer towards death.\u201dThe young man\u2019s pupils shook.\u201cNo matter how much he eats, he loses weight and has a hard time walking. In the end, he can only lie on the bed. But even that\u2019s only for a short while, because he will die soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe young man didn\u2019t respond, but his tightly gripped fist proved that Zich\u2019s words were correct.\u201cEven if you don\u2019t guide us to him, your younger brother will die. Even if you work hard selling goods, how likely will you be able to save your brother\u2019s life? Shouldn\u2019t you try to grasp even a strand of hope in a situation like this?\u201dZich\u2019s words were like a demon\u2019s temptations, and the young man bit his lips.* * *The young man guided Zich and Lubella to a house in the slums. Like the place they were staying in, the house was worn-out, shabby, and smelly.\u201cIt must be him.\u201dA young boy was sleeping on a bed made out of a rotting pile of straw underneath him and a dirty straw mat over him. It didn\u2019t look like the boy was diseased. His complexion looked alright, and his breathing was normal. However, the boy was extremely emaciated and bony like a mummy; and even while considering the fact that the slums\u2019 residents didn\u2019t get enough nutrients, the boy\u2019s condition was extreme.\u201cYes, Lady.\u201dThe young man, Timmy, answered Lubella\u2019s question. Timmy was still wary of the two, but as if he thought he should get along with them to help his younger brother, his tone and speech had become polite.Without hesitation, Lubella placed her hand on the boy\u2019s chest. Timmy flinched but didn\u2019t stop Lubella.\u201cHow\u2019s his condition?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s as we expected.\u201dLubella took her hand off the boy and answered Zich.\u201cI almost can\u2019t feel any of his life force. Instead, I can feel Bellu\u2019s dirty energy. What we thought was right. This boy is the sacrifice.\u201d\u201cSacrifice? My brother is a sacrifice?\u201dTimmy hurriedly hung onto Lubella, but Lubella wavered. She was hesitant to tell the dark truth to the boy\u2019s older brother. Thus, Zich came forward in her place.\u201cI will explain it to you simply. Some guys spread the undead in this city and falsely charged us with those crimes. They are the Bellid guys. You know about them, right? And those guys sucked away your brother\u2019s life force to complete a ritual. Thankfully, they didn\u2019t take enough to kill your brother, but that can happen any moment now.\u201dA bunch of gigantic schemes and conspiracies had just been revealed to him, but Timmy wasn\u2019t curious about that.\u201cT-then what? Can my brother get better?\u201d\u201cYeah, of course.\u201dWith her head lowered and her heart filled with guilt, she asked in surprise, \u201cReally?! Is there really a way for him to get better?\u201dEven she didn\u2019t know how to cure a person whose life force was taken away from them.\u201cYes, there definitely is one.\u201d\u201cH-how\u2026?\u201d Timmy pitifully asked as if he had thrown away all of his wariness about the two.\u201cIt\u2019s simple. We just have to give back the life force that your brother lost. Then, as you can expect, we just have to know where your brother\u2019s life force went.\u201dZich\u2019s voice changed slightly.\u201cHow did your brother become like this\u2014does anything come to mind? Like where he went or who he met before he collapsed.\u201d\u201cSomeone comes to my mind.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dTimmy seemed sure, and Zich and Lubella got their hopes up.\u201cThat\u2019s good, buddy. You just increased the chances of your brother\u2019s survival. So, tell us. Where? Or who?\u201d\u201cThat bastard, Sude.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cThe bastard, Sude. You know, the guy you helped us beat up. That bastard.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLubella spoke up unintentionally while listening to their conversation.Timmy looked at Lubella. He had a lot of anger on his face, and Lubella dipped her neck.\u201cI\u2019m saying, it\u2019s that shopkeeper bastard you saved!\u201d Timmy shouted.Zich quickly covered Timmy\u2019s mouth. For Zich and Lubella, who were in hiding, it wasn\u2019t good to make a commotion. Thankfully, Timmy didn\u2019t shout after that, but even as Zich blocked Timmy\u2019s mouth with his hands, Timmy continued to glare at Lubella.\u201cHey buddy, let\u2019s calm down. We have to move secretly. That will be better for your brother. You understand, right?\u201dTimmy nodded, and Zich took his hand away.\u201cThen, explain to us. Keep in mind that you will increase your brother\u2019s chance of survival the more details you give us.\u201d\u201c\u2026It happened ten or so days ago. That day, I also came back after making money. I don\u2019t know about you guys, but for us, if we rest even one day, we will starve. I can\u2019t rest even if my brother\u2019s condition is like this.\u201dTimmy wiped down his brother\u2019s forehead. Maybe because the boy felt a familiar hand, a smile formed on his face after a bit of tossing and turning; it was a touching scene, but the boy\u2019s stick-skinny body actually made the scene look more pitiful.\u201cI was a bit late that day because there was some work that made good money.\u201dTimmy had come home with a sack that was fuller than usual. But the satisfaction he got from feeling the sack\u2019s heavy touch didn\u2019t last long.\u201cMy younger brother wasn\u2019t at home. He was always home by the time I came back from work because I told him that he has to stay inside the house at nighttime.\u201dOf course, Timmy went to look for his brother. In the slums, where it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say law and order didn\u2019t exist, all kinds of thoughts filled Timmy\u2019s head. However, he didn\u2019t give up; his brother was his only family.\u201cI wandered around the slums for a long time until I found my brother in an open area.\u201dHowever, his younger brother wasn\u2019t the only one there. There was a man wearing a mask.\u201cMy younger brother was lying on the floor, and the man was crouching over him.\u201dThe man was sticking something into his younger brother\u2019s arm. Timmy could still remember it vividly as the chilling and terrifying blade glinted under the moonlight.\u201cI didn\u2019t even have the time to think. I lunged towards the man while screaming. The man was surprised, but I was faster than him, and we got entangled in a fight.\u201dThe fight had continued. Although Timmy\u2019s skills were superior to the man\u2019s, he had to watch out for the man\u2019s knife\u2014it prolonged the fight and Timmy eventually lost the man.\u201cBut I still succeeded in taking that man\u2019s mask off.\u201dTimmy distinctly remembered the face revealed by the moonlight.\u201cTo look for ways to make money or even beg sometimes, I went to the shopping and business district many times. And there, I was especially familiar with one person.\u201d\u201cAnd that guy must be Sude.\u201d Zich continued for him.Without even having the time to chase after Sude, Timmy had checked his brother\u2019s state first. He examined his brother\u2019s arm which had been pierced by a knife, but it was strange.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a trace of blood or even a single scratch. And my younger brother woke up soon afterward. I was relieved. I just thought that my brother almost got mixed up in a kidnapping that happened in the slums, and I had just imagined the knife. But after that incident, my brother lost energy and fainted. And he began to change into this, as you can see.\u201dTimmy looked at his younger brother pitifully.\u201cEven if I somehow found some food and fed him, it was useless. I thought I was going out of my mind since it didn\u2019t seem like he was hurting anywhere, but he kept getting weaker. Like you said, it was as if his life force was getting sucked away.\u201dThen, he remembered the man who had attacked his brother and the man\u2019s chilling dagger.\u201cA dagger that didn\u2019t leave a mark after piercing into a person. I thought it had to be a rare item, and it could explain my brother\u2019s strange condition.\u201dAs expected, Timmy had gone to look Sude; since Sude was someone he knew, it wasn\u2019t hard to find him. But there wasn\u2019t anything he could do. The Magistrate didn\u2019t care for poor people like him, and their opponent was a member of society unlike them.\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t stand by when I thought of my younger brother. So, in the end, I thought of resolving things by force.\u201d\u201cYou must have met me then.\u201d\u201cYes, I thought I should take the guy\u2019s dagger first. Then, I thought I could use it to trade for information about curing my brother. I also thought that even if the guy refused to tell us anything, in the end, the Magistrate might do something with a piece of evidence like that.\u201dTimmy stopped talking for a moment and glared at Lubella again.\u201cBut some virtuous person ruined everything.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I misunderstood\u2026\u201d\u201cMisunderstood?\u201dTimmy\u2019s voice was sharp.\u201cWhy? Was it because we were one-sidedly beating him up? Or was it because we were people from the slums? Or because I was a gangster bastard\u2019s son? In your eyes, did you just see us as the strong and the guy as the weak? So, were you certain that we must have been in the wrong?\u201dTimmy\u2019s voice started to grow louder and louder.\u201cBecause of your great misunderstanding, my younger brother\u2026!\u201d\u201cOk, ok, buddy, stop it. Let\u2019s calm down.\u201dZich patted Timmy\u2019s shoulders.\u201cDon\u2019t criticize her too much. As you said, the Lady has only lived a refined, protected life and hasn\u2019t experienced much. Besides, she is aware of her faults and is trying to fix them too. And that is a surprisingly difficult thing to do.\u201dTimmy suppressed his anger.Lubella couldn\u2019t make a single retort, and each of Timmy\u2019s resentful words pierced the corners of her heart.* * *With the clue about Sude, Zich and Lubella went out of Timmy\u2019s house.Timmy even saw them off from his house\u2019s door.\u201cI beg you. Please cure my younger brother.\u201d As if his emotions had calmed down, Timmy talked politely again.\u201cYes, even if I have to swear it on my life, we will succeed.\u201dMaybe because Lubella felt a sense of debt towards Timmy, she showed fierce determination. Timmy stared at Lubella for a moment and nodded. Zich and Timmy also exchanged greetings.\u201cHey, buddy. Thank you for your cooperation. Don\u2019t worry too much. Your brother will get better soon.\u201d\u201cI really beg you.\u201d\u201cOf course. But I am curious about one thing. Surprisingly, you don\u2019t seem to resent me. Is there a reason for that?\u201dZich had ignored Timmy when Lubella first appeared in the alleyway. It could be said that Zich had betrayed Timmy. However, Timmy surprisingly didn\u2019t show particular hostility towards Zich, and there was a clear difference in his attitude between Lubella and Zich.\u201cAh, you mean that.\u201d Timmy hesitated for a bit and said with embarrassment, \u201cYou were the first one besides my friends\u2026 who wanted to help me for no reason at all. Help us, who our own parents abandoned. That\u2019s probably why I can\u2019t really feel hostile to you.\u201dWhy? Zich\u2019s face froze like a bird hit by a bird gun.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dTimmy looked at him strangely. But Zich didn\u2019t say much, and Timmy didn\u2019t ask further.\u201cAnyways, did you guys really not kill Mr. Mayor and the Deputy Mayor? Or cast a great curse on the city?\u201dEven though his mind had only been focused on his younger brother, Timmy began to collect his senses and asked questions. It was also strange that Timmy added \u2018Mr\u2019 before only the Mayor, but Zich answered him.\u201cIf you know the truth, you will be in danger. It\u2019s better for you not to know.\u201d\u201cThen, just tell me if Mr. Mayor is dead or not.\u201d\u201cHe died.\u201dZich thought this much was fine to tell Timmy, but Lubella thought, \u2018Why did Timmy show interest in only the Mayor? Was he happy that the greedy Mayor was dead?\u2019However, Timmy\u2019s response was completely unexpected.\u201cThat\u2019s regretful. He was a good person.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d Lubella was surprised. \u201cA good person? The Mayor?\u201d\u201cYes, he was too good of a person, making it hard to believe that he was from this greedy city.\u201d\u201cBut the rumors about him weren\u2019t really great\u2026\u201dTimmy scowled.\u201cDid you hear them from merchants or people related to them? Those people dislike the Mayor because the Mayor tried to help poor people like us with the city\u2019s taxes. Of course, most of the merchants weren\u2019t happy about that. And unfortunately, since the merchants have a strong voice in this city, rumors about Mr. Mayor naturally grew bad.\u201d\u201cBut the Mayor\u2019s lifestyle was extravagant and wasteful, and his house was so big. It\u2019s hard to see him as a person like that! He looked greedy too!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Timmy spat out in an annoyed voice, and Lubella closed her mouth. In her confused state, Lubella looked like a dying tree, struggling to hold onto its center.\u201cWhy does it matter that his lifestyle was extravagant, or his house was big, or he was wasteful? As someone who was in charge of the city, he was also a successful merchant. Although it can make some feel jealous, it doesn\u2019t matter what he does with his own money. In addition to that, he always donated to the poor. Among all the merchants in this damn city, he was the only one who spent money on the poor and cared about us. And what do you mean that he looked greedy! What does one\u2019s character have to do with their looks?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLubella couldn\u2019t say a word in response.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySude\u2019s house was inside an ordinary residence. Zich and Lubella needed to move more carefully than they did in the slums to get there. However, because of Zich\u2019s \u2018Sensing and Detecting\u2019 skills, it only took them a bit longer, and they arrived at Sude\u2019s place without much difficulty.The house wasn\u2019t different from the other houses. It was a two-story house made out of wood, and in front of it, fences surrounded a small lawn in a complicated weave. It seemed like Sude wasn\u2019t home since the lights in the house weren\u2019t on.\u201cLet\u2019s wait inside for now.\u201dZich took the lead and trespassed the lawn. The door was firmly locked. It wasn\u2019t hard to break the door, but if Sude saw the broken door, he might run away or let other people know. Thus, like before, Zich decided to enter the house through a window.It was messy inside the house. As if its owner hadn\u2019t cleaned in a while, a thin layer of dust layered the ground, and clothes were carelessly scattered on the floor.\u201cIt seems like he doesn\u2019t do much housework.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s probably not it.\u201dZich cautiously looked around the room.\u2018Rather than dirty, it looks messy. It doesn\u2019t feel like he didn\u2019t keep his place tidy because he was lazy, but because he didn\u2019t feel the need to. It looks like the house of someone who is preparing to escape.\u2019Zich\u2019s eyes shone.\u2018He is preparing to escape. I think I\u2019m right on the mark.\u201dZich continued to search all over the room, and his eyes sparkled.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cBelow us. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s strange?\u201dZich pointed to the floor and then rolled his feet to emphasize his point.Thump! Thump!Hearing the sound, Lubella\u2019s eyes also became sharp.\u201cThere\u2019s an empty space below us.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dZich kneeled with one leg and placed his palms on the floor.\u2018Let me see. He pierced a hole to the entrance of a secret basement, but it\u2019s nothing amazing. The cover is sloppy. It doesn\u2019t seem to have a moving mechanism. That means a handle should be nearby.\u2019After a while, Zich found two holes right next to each other.\u2018Bingo!\u2019Zich placed his fingers inside the holes and pulled. The door was light, and an entrance to a basement appeared.\u201cIt stinks of a suspicious smell.\u201dZich comically blocked his nose.\u201cLet\u2019s try going in.\u201d\u201cI will go in first.\u201dZich tried stamping his feet on the stairs that led to the basement. Then, he walked confidently downstairs and Lubella followed behind him.The basement stairs weren\u2019t that long; in floors, the staircase was about 1.5 floors long. And at the end of the staircase, there was a door. Zich cautiously opened it.They saw a medium-sized room. It was almost vacant with no furniture in place. The only noticeable thing about the room was a dirty puddle of water collected on the ground. But Zich was satisfied.\u201cCheckmate.\u201dIn the center of the room, the ugly statue of a fish\u2019s head floated on top of the collected water.\u201cStatue of Bellu,\u201d Lubella murmured and gripped the staff she was holding. She wanted to break apart the statue right away.The statue looked more incomplete than the one they saw at the Mayor\u2019s mansion. That one looked fancier.\u201cThe one in the Mayor\u2019s residence is the center statue for sure,\u201d Zich said with satisfaction. The more evidence there was, the better.Zich suddenly turned his head toward the entrance.\u201cIt seems like the house\u2019s owner has returned.\u201dZich took Lubella out of the room in the basement and went back to the first floor. They saw a small light shining from outside, and Zich placed his index finger on his mouth to signal to Lubella to be quiet.Lubella nodded and moved quietly to a corner of the room. She moved so that she didn\u2019t bother Zich. In comparison, Zich quietly moved towards the entrance like a hunter approaching his prey.Clack!Creak!The door\u2019s lock unlocked, and the door opened. As expected, Sude entered the house. He placed the lamp he was holding down next to the door. Then, he tried to light up the closest candle.\u201cHey, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dSude became stunned as Zich suddenly jumped out. Then, after confirming Zich\u2019s face, Sude grew pale and Zich quickly blocked Sude\u2019s mouth to stop him from screaming.\u201cWoah! We are also glad to see you again, but let\u2019s be quiet. There\u2019s no need for you to greet us so fervently.\u201d\u201cUmph! Un-umph!\u201d\u201cI know, I know. If I am so glad to see you, how glad would you be? Sometimes the sensation of beating you up comes out in my dreams. Don\u2019t you think we really match each other well?\u201d\u201cUnn-umph!\u201dSude struggled and tried to scream, but he couldn\u2019t escape out of Zich\u2019s sturdy grip.\u201cHow about finishing things from last time? Ah, you don\u2019t have to worry about interventions this time. Do you see her?\u201dZich put more strength into his hands and forcefully moved Sude\u2019s neck. And Sude hopelessly turned to what Zich wanted him to see.\u201cLook. Your guardian angel from Heaven who protected you last time has come back as the angel from Hell.\u201dThere, he saw Lubella who shined with the lamp\u2019s red lights and stood like a godly judge in a trial. At her hardened expression, Sude\u2019s fear deepened.* * *Zich dragged Sude into the basement.Punch!\u201cUgh!\u201dSude floundered and staggered a couple of steps after getting kicked. Then, he collided with Bellu\u2019s statue and fell. His pants became soaked with dirty water.\u201cWhy? Why are you doing this?\u201d Sude shouted in a flurry, but Zich was carefree. He slowly went inside the room with the lamp that Sude was holding. The darkness that filled up the room lit up, and Zich placed the lamp in the corner of the room.\u201cLet me see. Why would we do this? If you ask the ugly fish head behind you, wouldn\u2019t you find out something?\u201dSude looked at the statue of Bellu behind him and looked at Zich again. Then, he saw Lubella\u2019s cold expression behind Zich and babbled, \u201cD-do you think that I am Bellid\u2019s follower?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I also don\u2019t think you are the fish head\u2019s follower.\u201d\u201cT-then\u2026!\u201d\u201cBut I get the feeling that you are like a sea roach, sticking around those Bellid guys and eating the crumbs they leave.\u201d\u201cS-sorry?\u201d\u201cI am saying that you are like a fucking bastard.\u201dPunch!\u201cAh!\u201dAt another kick from Zich, Sude\u2019s bottom stuck to the puddle. Dirty water splashed on his face and head.Stomp!Zich then stomped on Sude\u2019s back. Sude\u2019s body wiggled on the floor, and Zich was satisfied with seeing Sude look like a dirty cockroach.\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201dLubella was surprised at her own words. Even if he was Bellid\u2019s accompaniment, she didn\u2019t know that she was capable of sounding so cold to another person. However, even when she realized this, she didn\u2019t have any further thoughts.\u201cTruthfully, we don\u2019t need him since we found the fish head\u2019s statue.\u201dZich took out something from his waist\u2014the object sharply shone with the lamp\u2019s dim lights. It was a dagger.\u201cLet\u2019s kill him.\u201dThere were chilling words without a trace of warmth. Even Lubella, who was on the same side as Zich, flinched, feeling the chill. She couldn\u2019t even see even a portion of the carefree attitude that Zich had always shown her.About to utter some excuses, Sude also closed his mouth. Swept by surprise and fear, he could only roll his eyes. He gulped.\u201cI-I don\u2019t know anything! It\u2019s true!\u201dHe managed to say something, but Zich\u2019s glass bead-like eyes seemed to not believe him.\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything? I guess it can\u2019t be helped then. I will kill you since you are useless.\u201dZich grabbed his dagger in reverse and raised it high. It looked like a monster\u2019s tooth about to shred its victim.\u201cL-Lady Lubella! Please stop this man!\u201dSince it didn\u2019t seem like he could convince Zich at all, Sude turned his attention to Lubella.\u201cHey, it\u2019s useless. Because of shits like you, Lady Lubella is going through a lot and becoming tougher. There\u2019s no point in thinking that she\u2019ll help you like she did in the past. Besides, Karuwiman\u2019s people are completely merciless to those who cooperate with Bellid.\u201dAs Zich spoke, Lubella\u2019s eyes that looked down on Sude were cold.\u201cT-that\u2026!\u201d\u201cAre you done with your last words? I will give you that much time. Since I have decided to live a kind life, I will be generous.\u201dSude\u2019s head went round and round. Both Zich and Lubella were beyond combative, and they didn\u2019t seem like they would believe anything he said.\u201cWait! Didn\u2019t you say that you don\u2019t need me since you found the fish head\u2019s statue\u2026?!\u201dSude was sure that Zich had been talking about Bellu\u2019s statue when he mentioned a fish head. Hope sprouted in his heart.\u201cT-the other statues! I know where the other statues are!\u201dThe dagger, which looked like it was going to fall like a guillotine, stopped. It worked. Sude felt strength leave his body as relief seeped into him.\u201cHm. To be honest, we are interested in that.\u201dZich let down his dagger.\u201cWhere are they?\u201dZich\u2019s cold voice pierced Sude\u2019s heart. It was a voice scary enough to make Sude want to confess everything, but he was barely able to swallow back the truth that was rising in his throat.\u201cD-do you think I will just tell you that easily?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. Guys like you stubbornly pluck out whatever they can if it benefits them.\u201dZich looked down at Sude with his glass bead-like eyes. It didn\u2019t look like he was looking at a human. As if he was staring at a dead beast\u2019s worn-out piece of meat, his glare was chilling. However, Sude smelled a chance to survive and didn\u2019t back down.\u2018It\u2019s too late for me to deny that I am cooperating with Bellid. It\u2019s not like they will believe me if I deny it. I should use the locations of the other stone statues to secure my safety.\u2019After worrying for a bit, Sude yelled out loud, \u201cI don\u2019t care what you say! Don\u2019t you dare lay a finger on me! If you do, you will never be able to learn where the other statues are.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s a bit troubling.\u201dZich scratched the back of his head.Sude thought he had seized the initiative, and with that thought, he became bolder.\u201cYou bastards! How could you just attack a person like this every time! Like how you acted with violence right away in the back alleyway last time! This is why we have to wipe out all the thugs and smelly poor bastards in the city!\u201dAfter speaking, Sude seemed to have thought he had gone a bit too far and glanced at Zich. But Zich just furrowed his eyebrows like he was annoyed and didn\u2019t show a reaction more significant than that.Thus, Sude thought Zich couldn\u2019t touch him, and he became completely relieved. Then, his attention went to Lubella.\u201cThe great Karuwiman follower has fallen lower than low! To go around with this complete thug and using violence everywhere! No, are you not Karuwiman\u2019s holy follower anymore but a witch?\u201dHe didn\u2019t have to consider their feelings anymore. Sude\u2019s heart filled with a vulgar satisfaction that he could say whatever he wanted to the holy Karuwiman Saint Candidate he normally wouldn\u2019t have even dared to look in the eye.\u201c\u2026Is this your true self?\u201dThe Sude that Lubella knew was someone who generously forgave someone who one-sidedly acted violently towards him and possessed the warmth to protect his family\u2019s store. Now, the man in front of her was so different from the person she had met in the shop that it made her doubt that they were the same person.\u201cTrue self! Ha! Are you saying that the na\u00edve geek you saw before and the bastard in front of you don\u2019t look the same? It\u2019s only natural for a merchant to wear a mask. The one who gets tricked is the moron.\u201dLubella glanced at the statue behind Sude and asked, \u201cI see. Then, why did you do something like this? You said that you weren\u2019t one of Bellid\u2019s followers. What\u2019s the merit of helping Bellid?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of amazing reason would a merchant need to work? Of course, it\u2019s money.\u201d\u201cMoney?\u201d\u201cYes, money! A huge amount so that I won\u2019t have to smile and suck up to the customers while running a damningly small shop anymore!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you liked the shop? You told us your family cherished and protected it for a long time.\u201d\u201cLike? Cherish and protect? What bullshit! I have never thought that even once!\u201d Sude roughly yelled, \u201cThat worn-out building and my long years there are just shackles! The store is a loser\u2019s emblem that I inherited from my father and grandfathers who had zero talent in business as merchants!\u201dSude\u2019s eyes glistened. He glared at Lubella spitefully.\u201cWhat did you tell me before? That it was an impressive shop? Did you know how much it angers me to hear that nonsense from you\u2014who grew up eating only good food and wearing good clothes, and always looked down at us from your sheltered life? I don\u2019t want to hear bullshit from people who have everything in the first place!\u201dThey were malicious remarks mixed with greed and self-righteousness. It was the first time Lubella had heard of something like this. Hearing the flood of insults and sarcastic comments, Lubella\u2019s face grew pale, but she firmly held her ground. She didn\u2019t stop Sude from talking and withstood all of his spiteful insults.\u201cWell, there ought to be guys like this too. Since Lady Lubella is traveling to see the world and hear more people, you are helping her.\u201dAfter consoling Lubella, Zich approached Sude.\u201cAre you finished?\u201d\u201cNo, but I will stop here since I am also a busy man. Release me right now! Then I will tell you where Bellu\u2019s statues are!\u201dSude made a request like he was asking for an expected service.\u2018It\u2019s over now. If I just get out of this situation, I\u2019ll be rich!\u2019Sude had already received a hefty sum for putting life force into Bellu\u2019s statue. If he just left the city with the money he got, he could live the splendid life he dreamed of.\u2018It seems like something will happen to this city, but that\u2019s not my problem. As long as I live well, who cares?\u2019Whatever happened to other people, Sude\u2019s happiness was most important to him.\u201cWhat are you dawdling for! Move aside at once!\u201d\u201cAh, but you know,\u201d Zich smiled widely at Sude who spoke with a triumphant look. \u201cI changed my mind.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIt was funny how Sude puffed up his mouth like a stupid fish.\u201cI said, I changed my mind. I will just kill you here.\u201d\u201cD-don\u2019t bullshit! If you lay even a finger on me, you won\u2019t know the statues\u2019 locations\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know the statues\u2019 locations, though.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cAlso, it doesn\u2019t matter if you know or don\u2019t know the locations.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dZich gently whispered to Sude who grew pale, \u201cHow was it? How sweet was your moment of hope?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I really have to quit this sadistic hobby.\u2019Zich felt conflicted inside. This was the first real \u2018event\u2019 he experienced since he regressed, so some of his \u2018Demon Lord\u2019 persona seeped out for a few moments.\u2018People who live kindly do not have this kind of hobby.\u2019Even with his lack of common sense, Zich was aware of this. However, the thrill he felt from tormenting Sude was more than what he had expected. Both Sude and Lubella looked shocked by Zich\u2019s words, and Sude began to appear doubtful after shouting confidently just a moment ago.\u201cI-I\u2019m not going to be tricked by such a bluff\u2026!\u201d\u201cFirst.\u201dZich put one finger forward in front of Sude.\u201cFollowers of Bellid are way too cautious to reveal their entire plan to their collaborators. No, anyone with common sense won\u2019t do that to someone who they are planning to use and throw away. There\u2019s no way those bastards told a low life like you, the statues\u2019 locations. In that way, I guess they are like everyone else but strange in other ways.\u201dAnd Zich\u2019s sadistic tendencies made him also \u2018strange in other ways.\u2019\u201cSecond, even without you, I can find the other statues by myself. To be exact, those guys will tell me where they are.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t even make sense\u2014\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m not gonna tell you more than that.\u201dZich began to swing his dagger in circles. Sude\u2019s eyes circled around and around with the dagger\u2019s movement.\u201cBecause it\u2019s going to be useless information for you anyways.\u201dHalt!Zich stopped swinging his dagger and held it properly.\u201cW-what are you doing! Then, why did you ask me that question\u2026!\u201d\u201cOh, that? I mean, it\u2019s kind of embarrassing to say, but that\u2019s just my hobby.\u201d\u201cH-hobby?\u201d\u201cYeah! My personality is really rotten. But you probably knew that, right? That was one of my evil and trashy hobbies.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think you should bring yourself down like that,\u201d Lubella replied as if she was dumbfounded. However, Zich replied back without a shred of embarrassment, \u201cBut it\u2019s the truth.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLubella did not reply. No, she could not reply because she was speechless. Regardless of what Lubella felt, Zich continued, \u201cEven though I say it is a hobby of mine, it\u2019s really nothing. I just like to give hope to people who are about to die soon. The type of hope I give is different depending on the situation. One example of giving false hope would be something like, \u2018I won\u2019t be able to harm you because I need to know where Bellu\u2019s statue is.\u2019\u201dZich held back his laughter.\u201cIt was really hilarious to see that. As soon as you thought you had the advantage, your attitude changed right away. I guess that type of reaction is typical for guys like you.\u201d\u201cAh, that, what\u2026!\u201dSude opened his mouth to talk, closed it, and then opened it again. It seemed as if he wanted to say something, but all that came out of his mouth were meaningless gasps.\u201cBefore I end your life, you had a sweet dream, right? Then it\u2019s time for you to really leave this world.\u201dSude felt as if a cold light was surrounding the dagger again.\u201cW-wait a moment! I really know the locations of the other statues!\u201d\u201cOh, really? That\u2019s amazing. Those Bellid bastards don\u2019t teach anyone that unless they have a very deep connection with them. Isn\u2019t that more of a reason to kill you?\u201d\u201cN-no! I\u2019m not\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you calm down for a bit? Shouldn\u2019t you have expected this when you decided to vigorously insult an important figure like Lady Lubella, and most of all, me? You should face the consequences of your actions.\u201d\u201cLady L-Lubella!\u201dWith the mention of Lubella\u2019s name from Zich, Sude changed the subject of his pleas to Lubella. As if he hadn\u2019t poured out sharp and vicious words just a moment ago, Sude showed a sad smile and began begging Lubella.\u201cPlease stop this person! I-I\u2019m a victim! I\u2019m the type of person who the people of Karuwiman must protect! I was just so taken back by his question. My words came out a bit carelessly! I swear that I have no connections to the followers of Bellid!\u201dSude quickly began to deny all his previous statements. Of course, no matter how na\u00efve Lubella was, there was no way she believed Sude\u2019s words. But as a follower of Karuwiman who had to uphold the value of everyone\u2019s lives, she could not help but hesitate.\u201cDo you really have to kill this person?\u201dSude\u2019s expression brightened.Zich lowered his dagger. Then he folded his arms and leaned on Bellu\u2019s statue to see what Lubella would do next.\u201cI guess so. Do we really have to kill him?\u201d\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t think you would reply back with a question.\u201dZich swiped the dagger with one of his hands and continued, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you rethink whether we really have to kill this person or not? Or what should we do next?\u201dLubella looked down at Sude. His eyes were now looking at her as if she was an angel from Heaven; his sudden change in attitude was disgusting. However, as a follower of Karuwiman, she could not mix her personal feelings with proper judgment.\u201c\u2026This person\u2019s actions can\u2019t be forgiven. Even if we don\u2019t kill him right now, he is going to be executed by the country, and if Karuwiman\u2019s General Assembly takes him, he probably won\u2019t survive.\u201dSude\u2019s complexion turned green.\u201cI also agree that even the worst criminals have the right to be judged under the law, but if we let him live now, won\u2019t he obviously escape?\u201d\u201cI-I will never escape! Plus, I told you, I have no relations with the people of Bellid!\u201dSude was pathetically begging to them, but both Lubella and Zich paid no attention to his cries and focused on their conversation as if Sude was already a dead corpse.\u201cThere are a few reasons to let him live but many reasons to kill him.\u201d\u201cYes, that is true. So what do you think is the best decision?\u201dIt was better to kill Sude. However, Lubella had a hard time saying it out loud. No matter how evil he was, it was still a matter of ending a person\u2019s life. For different reasons, Zich and Sude waited for Lubella\u2019s following words.Suddenly, Lubella remembered something that Weig said to her before: \u2018I\u2019m repeating this, Lady Lubella, but it\u2019s not enough to be just patient and nice. As followers of Karuwiman, not only do we comfort people, but we also protect them. We must have strong hearts.\u2019Determination filled Lubella\u2019s eyes.\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s kill him.\u201dThud!Sude felt as if his heart was physically plummeting down to the ground. However, there was no one here who cared about how he felt.Splash! Splash!While stepping on the puddle, Zich headed towards Sude.\u201cW-wait a moment! I really did nothing wrong! You guys are making a big mistake! You are trying to kill an innocent person!\u201dSude\u2019s desperate and miserable cries could not stop Zich or move Lubella.\u201cFuck! You think I will die like this! I\u2019m gonna live a good, long life! I\u2019m going to live a luxurious life like one of those rich bastards! My destiny is to not slowly rot away in an old store and kick the bucket! Shit! Lubella, you fucking evil witch! I\u2019m a fucking victim! If you are a follower of Karuwiman, protect me now\u2014!\u201dPush!An eerie sound of piercing flesh immediately ended Sude\u2019s ringing cries.Splash!Freshly cut meat dropped into the pool. As if the loud cries a moment ago had all been an illusion, the basement filled with complete silence.* * *Lubella sat blankly in an abandoned house; they used this house as a place of refuge for a short time. To hide the fact that they were hiding there, the door and windows were tightly shut, but they could not stop the light from seeping into the room. Seeing that the light was slowly turning orange, Lubella thought that it must be time for the sun to set.Creak!The door slowly opened, and Zich appeared from his trip outside.\u201cWas everything alright?\u201d\u201cNothing much happened.\u201dZich closed the door. Then he carefully walked towards Lubella and sat in front of her.\u201cAre you alright?\u201dLubella was about to say she was \u2018alright,\u2019 but the word did not leave her mouth.\u201cWell, you saw someone die in front of you, so I understand.\u201dMoreover, even though she didn\u2019t directly kill him, she had played a huge part in a person\u2019s death. It was understandable that she was in a state of shock.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not only that.\u201dAbout to put a piece of bread into his mouth, Zich stopped at Lubella\u2019s statement.\u201cIs there a different reason?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I think I have been making the wrong judgements the whole time.\u201dZich put down his bread and properly faced Lubella to indicate that he was ready to listen to her. Lubella hesitated a bit before she continued, \u201cFrom Sude and to Mr. Timmy, the Mayor and even to the Deputy Mayor\u2014I\u2019ve been judging people based on other people\u2019s words and opinions. I\u2019ve also framed a certain image on people by seeing them in one situation.\u201d\u201cYou are telling me that you were prejudiced.\u201d\u201cYes. It is one of the things God Karuna tells us not to do. I judged certain people as strong and others as weak, and I thought that the weak were always in the right and the strong were always in the wrong.\u201dFor that reason, Lubella was hostile to the Mayor and Timmy, who she thought were the \u2018strong\u2019 people in society, and she favored Sude who she thought was weak. However, the reality was the complete opposite.\u201cBecause of my misjudgments, the people who protected me died, and my situation ended up like this.\u201d\u201cYes, you are right.\u201dLubella flinched at Zich\u2019s honest reply.\u201cHonestly, I also became a bit doubtful of your words. After I beat up Sude, you told me that I have to help the weak. I didn\u2019t like that Sude guy in the first place.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cHe smelled fishy.\u201dZich was saying that he used his instincts. Lubella was severely disappointed since she expected Zich to tell her a great way to tell evil people apart. But surprisingly, Zich\u2019s instincts were usually right on the mark. The instincts he honed from his various experiences in his first life were quite dangerous.\u2018Well, I\u2019m not always right, and I don\u2019t feel those kinds of instincts from everyone but whatever.\u2019What mattered was that he was right this time.\u201cIsn\u2019t judging people by instincts worse than prejudice?\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then I will stop judging people by how they smell from now on.\u201dZich\u2019s reply was so carefree that Lubella felt futile asking him a question in the first place. On the other hand, his nonchalant tone lessened the weight on her heart.\u201cSo from what I\u2019m getting from this is that you feel guilty for going against Karuna\u2019s teachings and making the situation worse?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHmmm, alright. I hope you work hard in thinking about this.\u201dZich picked up the bread he put down and got up.\u201c\u2026Are you not going to give me any advice?\u201d\u201cEven if I give you advice, I can only give you obvious ones: \u2018The people who died will not resent you.\u2019 \u2018Anyone could have made those mistakes.\u2019 \u2018You are going through this trip to gain experiences like this.\u2019 Etcetera, etcetera. But will your heart feel at ease from these words?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\u201cRight? The advice I can give you are all words that you can easily think of as well. But people\u2019s hearts can not be easily changed by will. If that was possible, I would not go through all this trouble to live a kind life.\u201dZich humorously shook his head. This made Lubella smile a little bit.\u201cSo I hope you find a solution for yourself, whether you find an answer to it, get used to it, or let time heal your wounds.\u201d\u201cI will do that.\u201d\u201cYes. But this worry won\u2019t make you hesitate while we are fighting those Bellid bastards, right?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This and the situation with Bellid are completely different.\u201dUnlike her usual, actual self, Lubella replied with firmness.\u2018Is she forming her tenacity?\u2019Looking at her now, there was no trace of the Lubella who was shivering from head to toe in a closed alleyway. She was definitely growing up to become a stronger and more determined person.\u2018Is this alright?\u2019So far, Zich had been helping Lubella because he thought it was a kind act, and he didn\u2019t want to see those Bellid bastards doing well; but at the same time, he had unintentionally helped Lubella progress.\u2018If I have to fight the Hero Party again and a stronger Lubella was part of the team\u2026\u2019Zich\u2019s body shivered on instinct.\u2018I-I\u2019m going to live a kind life anyways. Will I ever have to go against her?\u2019 Zich thought this in his mind, but he fiercely scratched the goosebumps that popped up all over his arms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySplaaaaash!As if the clouds that covered the sky were throwing a tantrum that they wouldn\u2019t back off easily, rain poured down from the sky. The streaks were considerably thick, and the cold rain covered the view and deafened all noise.Most people didn\u2019t take a step outside their house. And even those who went out quickly came back inside after finishing their errands. However, some people welcomed this nasty weather.Raindrops poured out like a waterfall from an upside-down hoodie. But inside the hoodie, a pair of eyes fiercely shone. It was Zich. While carrying Lubella who also shielded most of her face with a hoodie from the rain, he looked down at a house.\u201cIs it really that house?\u201d Lubella asked without much confidence. After taking care of the statue in Sude\u2019s house, Zich had set his next target. Because he had pointed out a place without a single clue, Lubella was quite surprised.But Zich was sure.\u201cDuring the day, I checked the routes that the guards patrolled. Although it\u2019s natural for them to patrol important places or areas where we might hide, they were intensively patrolling areas where there was no clear reason to do so. That obviously means that they are hiding something important in those places.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that they are hiding Bellu\u2019s statues there?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Lubella nodded. Truthfully, it didn\u2019t matter if Zich convinced her or not since she was one-sidedly relying on Zich right now.\u201cThen, let\u2019s go.\u201dWhile carrying Lubella, Zich entered the house. As if Zich was right, they saw a tightly guarded border that had not been visible outside the home. However, Zich easily passed the border, knocked out the guards, and removed the traps. Then, after inspecting the building\u2019s insides, Zich found a secret room like the one they saw in Sude\u2019s house.Zich was so skilled at finding hidden spots that Lubella suspected his career again; but regardless, Zich opened the door to the secret room. Inside, there was the statue of an ugly fish head that they had desperately searched for.\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d\u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d Zich boasted, \u201cThese kinds of guys are simple. And since they have a lot to lose, they like to overprotect their belongings.\u201d\u201cStill, I didn\u2019t think that we would be able to find it so easily.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t really find it easily. He laid many baits, but it was because of my skills that we were able to find the real one.\u201dZich didn\u2019t seem like he intended to hide his achievements. Some people might have scowled at him because of his lack of humility, but because Zich\u2019s abilities were really coming to light from this crisis in the city, Lubella complimented him without hesitation.\u201cThat\u2019s true. You really are amazing.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s kind of embarrassing.\u201dZich had boasted just a moment before, but now he tried to be modest. It was because this was his first time receiving such a pure compliment.\u2018Usually, when someone boasts, they are followed by all kinds of jeering and ridicule. Or they are met by shameless flattery.\u2019That was the kind of world that Zich was used to.\u201cThat\u2019s enough of hyping me up. Let\u2019s just finish our business.\u201d\u201cYes, let\u2019s do that.\u201dTheir reason for finding Bellu\u2019s statue was to disrupt the ritual from completing. Zich pulled out a paint box and a brush from his grasp.\u201cLady Lubella, please.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLubella instilled Karuna\u2019s holy power into the paint. The paint\u2019s red color sparkled for a moment and turned back to its original color.Poke!Zich dipped his brush into the paint. And as if he was about to make a masterpiece, he twirled his brush around Bellu\u2019s status. Lubella watched him from behind in silence.\u201cWill this really work?\u201dHer eyes trembled a bit anxiously, but she believed Zich. Well, she didn\u2019t have a choice. After getting betrayed by Sude and the Deputy Mayor, it was hard for her to trust people, but she couldn\u2019t doubt Zich. I mean, wasn\u2019t he helping her who was charged as the Witch, and fighting an immense force like the Bellid for the simple purpose of doing a good deed?If she didn\u2019t believe in Zich, she felt like she wouldn\u2019t have the courage to believe in people anymore. So, she thought. However, there was still a difference between believing in the person and believing in the knowledge that the person held.\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so?\u201dAfter turning around, Zich placed his brush and paint back, and Lubella carefully inspected the statue behind him. The statue was inscribed with all kinds of lines and shapes from top to bottom. They were probably magic circles to hinder the ritual and give the life force back to those who had lost it.But were Lubella\u2019s eyes playing tricks on her?The marks on the statue didn\u2019t look like normal magic circles that geometricized the principles of holy powers, magic, or every type of nature or gods\u2019 miracles; for example, they didn\u2019t include symbols of galactical planets like the suns, moons, and stars or living creatures such as humans, animals, and plants. Frankly, they looked very crude as if a child scribbled them for fun.Were these marks really a magic circle that would solve their problems? Even Lubella, who had significant knowledge and rank among the Karuwiman people had never heard of this method before.\u201cPlease wrap this up now.\u201dLubella nodded at Zich\u2019s words and poured her holy powers into the statue. She had to continue to have faith in Zich. She had come too far now to begin doubting him, and Bellid\u2019s ritual would begin any time now.\u201cCan we just leave the statue like this?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter since your holy powers have already flowed down the basement. Whether we break it apart or not, we are done here.\u201dZich started to walk out while saying that they should search for the other statues. Lubella soon followed Zich while staring at his back.* * *Not long afterwards, Lubella felt foolish for doubting Zich. After they drew those silly-looking magic circles on Bellu\u2019s statues and poured holy powers on them, they soon encountered an unexpected creature.\u201cIt\u2019s a zombie.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s a zombie.\u201dUnder the cover of darkness, Zich and Lubella were trying to find another statue when they met a zombie. It wasn\u2019t strange to see a zombie in the city when Bellid\u2019s ritual was close to complete, but Lubella thought the zombie looked odd.\u201cWhy is it acting like that?\u201dThe zombie approached them while staggering. That part wasn\u2019t unusual since zombies often moved strangely. However, the zombie\u2019s movements went beyond simply strange. As if it was wearing invisible armor, its movements were extremely stiff like it was restricted.\u201cHm.\u201dZich went closer to the zombie. Like all zombies, it stretched out its hands to take away Zich\u2019s life force\u2014 to make Zich like itself. However, the zombie\u2019s movements were very awkward and slow, so it didn\u2019t feel threatening at all.Zich struck the zombie\u2019s neck. It was a simple procedure like striking the head of a dead fish.\u201cIt became weaker.\u201d\u201cWeaker? The zombie did?\u201dThat seemed like good news to Lubella, and her heart thumped with expectations.\u201cYes, it became weaker for sure. Thankfully, it seems like what we are doing is not useless.\u201dZich\u2019s words were basically a confirmation for her. The doubt that took place in the corner of her heart quickly dissolved.\u201cAh, thank goodness! That\u2019s really a relief!\u201dLike that, Lubella got onto her knees and prayed to Karuna. Because she felt like they could end this harsh plight without a great sacrifice, her eyes teared up.\u201cI don\u2019t know how I can express my thanks.\u201dThen, Lubella abruptly got up and grabbed Zich\u2019s hands. She couldn\u2019t bear that she had doubted him before.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. To tell you the truth, I doubted you.\u201d\u201cUh, that\u2019s a bit disappointing. How many people do you think would be kind enough to help you with their life on the line\u2014that you doubt me?\u201dZich winked. And because his eyes didn\u2019t seem to hold any grudge against her, Lubella burst out into laughter.\u201cI didn\u2019t doubt you, as a person. I can\u2019t thank you enough for helping me so far. But I had a bit of doubt about your method of hindering the ritual. Although I have access to valuable information from Karuwiman, I didn\u2019t know about it, and the method is\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause the method is drawing ridiculous and suspicious-looking scribbles that don\u2019t even look like magic circles?\u201d\u201c\u2026To tell you the truth, that was it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to be sorry. I understand. Even I wonder what the person who made it was thinking. I don\u2019t know if I should call the person a genius or an idiot.\u201d\u201cI think the person is a genius.\u201d\u201cSince you think that, I will also think the same.\u201d\u201cCan I ask how you learned this method?\u201d\u201cAh, that is a secret.\u201dSince she had been refused before, Lubella didn\u2019t really feel disappointed.\u201cThen, please, you must teach me the magic circle later.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. I will teach you all later. Of course, with a price.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. For us, Karuwiman, that magic circle is priceless, and the Church will grant pretty much anything you ask for.\u201dMaybe it was because they saw the effect of their works, but their moods were much brighter than before\u2014despite the fact that they were still getting chased and the Deputy Mayor was still alive and well.\u201cNow, we just have to take care of a couple more statues. Then, the Deputy Mayor\u2019s power will decrease significantly, and we can attack the Mayor\u2019s mansion again. But we have to be more careful since they will increase the number of guards as the number of statues decreases.\u201d\u201cI understand. But how can they place so many statues without a single rumor spreading? Many people should have disappeared as offerings.\u201d\u201cThey probably blocked people\u2019s mouths with money and power. There are a lot of excuses to choose from, like, \u2018Let\u2019s keep quiet for now since people can start panicking.\u2019 Since this is a city sensitive to the economy, that probably worked well.\u201dThe whole truth was impossible to realize if one didn\u2019t realize that the city was covered by a black curtain, specifically the Bellid group. In fact, before he became aware of what was going on, even Zich thought the appearance of the undead was a new happening since public sentiment was still relatively calm.\u201cBut that won\u2019t last for long. Let\u2019s take care of the rest of Bellu\u2019s statues and save the city.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dFeeling hopeful, they disappeared into the city\u2019s darkness again.* * *Since then, Zich and Lubella found a couple of more statues. On the magic circle that Zich drew, Lubella generously poured more holy power. And their results became more and more visible. In the end, they reached a point where they couldn\u2019t find a single undead all over the city at night.Of course, this didn\u2019t mean that the undead completely disappeared. They might have missed one roaming around in a back alleyway. But generally, they could sense that the total number of undead had definitely decreased.\u201cOkay then, let\u2019s go to the Mayor\u2019s mansion and destroy the center statue there. If that still exists, everything we did will be for nothing. We can only delay the ritual and not stop it.\u201d\u201cWhere do you think the Deputy Mayor is?\u201d\u201cI also don\u2019t know, but he will probably be at the Mayor\u2019s mansion. Since the mansion is the center of this ritual, that guy probably can\u2019t leave the area.\u201d\u201cThen we should go to the mansion. When are we going?\u201d\u201cIs there a reason for us to take our time?\u201dZich stared at the area where the Mayor\u2019s mansion was.\u201cLet\u2019s go tonight.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Mayor\u2019s mansion was gigantic and magnificent as ever. Enough to be mistaken as a palace, it was a place that a peasant couldn\u2019t even dream of stepping within. But was it just a feeling? The mansion somehow looked darker and gloomier than any other worn-out building in the city.Zich and Lubella stopped at the mansion\u2019s yard. Unlike before, they confidently strutted around the yard. There was no one outside the mansion who they had to hide from.\u201cIt\u2019s like a ghost mansion.\u201d\u201cA house is a place where people live. If there\u2019s no one living inside it, it can become quite frightening. This place is more like that because it has so much useless space, giving more room for imagination.\u201dThe whole mansion was empty. After the Mayor\u2019s assassination, the guards lost their main figure to protect and were the first ones to leave. Then, the Mayor\u2019s family, who felt an ominous feeling from the residence, moved somewhere else. Even the servants didn\u2019t want to stay, and so, the mansion that had been the fanciest house in the entire city became empty.\u201cThe Deputy Mayor probably caused this to happen since he is using the Mayor\u2019s mansion as the center of his ritual.\u201d\u201cI guess it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that this mansion is Bellu\u2019s temple.\u201d\u201cYes. They probably covered all their bases there. I bet they\u2019ve prepared everything they have for us.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s delightful news.\u201dAs if she was trying to imbue some confidence into herself, Lubella spoke with high spirits. Zich smirked.\u201cEven if we greatly diminished the Bellid guys\u2019 power, they still have a lot of forces left. He probably finished restoring that thing called the \u2018Key.\u2019 Under normal circumstances, we would have retreated and called support, but you know, we don\u2019t have much time.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped that we have to fix this problem with just the two of us. It won\u2019t be easy. Are you ready?\u201dLubella looked at the staff she was holding. It was something she had gotten when she was chosen as the Saint Candidate. She had sworn that day she would bet her life for light and justice as someone carrying Karuna\u2019s strength and name.Lubella stared at Zich. He could see determination in her eyes.\u201cI am prepared,\u201d Lubella stated.\u201cI see, but don\u2019t be too nervous.\u201dLubella\u2019s determination seemed too much to Zich, and he tapped her shoulders.\u201cEven if the Deputy Mayor has the city under his control, if our battle creates a loud commotion, military troops will come barging in. Then, if we just play the situation well, we may be able to get them to join us. It will also free us of our false charges at the same time. Unless they are blind, they won\u2019t attack us immediately if they see us fighting the undead.\u201d\u201cAh, there was that possibility.\u201dEven if Lubella had made a firm resolution, she was nervous; but hearing Zich\u2019s words, she loosened her shoulders.\u2018As expected of Mr. Zich.\u2019Lubella believed in Zich completely now. She admired him for his insights.\u201cThen let\u2019s charge in.\u201dWith his words as the signal, the two opened the mansion\u2019s main gates and went inside.* * *The mansion\u2019s doors weren\u2019t even locked by a simple system. This suggested that in contrast to how its exterior looked, the place was completely uninhabited.\u2018As expected, Mr. Zich\u2019s predictions were right.\u2019And they were sure that Bellid people were conspiring inside the mansion.\u201cLet\u2019s head to where the fish head statue is.\u201d\u201cI will guide you.\u201dLubella took the lead. They didn\u2019t need to hide like last time, and they arrived at their destination in no time.Clack!Zich raised his sword and opened the door.Whoosh!In a room covered in darkness, a flash of light shot out like arrows. With considerable strength and speed, the flash of light was aimed at Zich\u2019s neck. Although it had come out with great impact, it missed its mark.\u201cThat surprised me,\u201d Zich said after slightly lowering his head and making a perfect escape from the ambush. Unlike what he said, his tone was utterly calm. It seemed like he spat out his words out of habit rather than surprise.However, that wasn\u2019t the end of the attacks.Wing! Wing! Wing!Three more flashes of light burst out.Zich stepped away from the door.\u201cM-Mr. Zich! Are you okay?\u201dLubella wasn\u2019t able to keep up with the sudden attacks and just blinked her eyes, quickly hanging onto Zich.\u201cI am fine. I am not that easily affected by such sloppy attacks,\u201d Zich replied with little regard and glared inside the room. \u201cBut besides that, it\u2019s weird that I couldn\u2019t sense the attacks.\u201d\u2018Now that I mention it\u2026\u2019Zich\u2019s sensing abilities were incredible to say the least, and he had benefited greatly from them over his lifetime. From the first place, Zich was able to find Lubella in the alleyway because of his sensing abilities.\u2018There\u2019s someone who can trick Mr. Zich\u2019s sensing skills?\u2019Lubella began to feel a bit frightened.Whoosh!Creatures that attacked Zich from inside the room revealed themselves.\u201c\u2026Shadow Demons?\u201d Lubella said their name out loud. She could understand it now. Shadow Demons were monsters called \u2018Death that crawled out of Hell\u2019s shadows.\u2019 With their stealthiness, equal to none other, these creatures approached their victims without a sound or trace and attacked them. Considering this, she could understand how they had escaped Zich\u2019s sensing skills and attacked.No, she had to compliment Zich for his reflexes that allowed him to escape these creatures\u2019 attacks even as they tried to ambush him. However, even when Lubella\u2019s question was answered, her confusion wasn\u2019t resolved. No, it actually deepened.\u201cH-How?\u201dThe fact that these Shadow Demons laid in the room with Bellu\u2019s statue proved that Bellid controlled them.\u2018I thought the ritual lost some of its powers?\u2019However, these creatures were proof that the ritual\u2019s powers had increased; now, it seemed like the Bellid guys had the ability to summon advanced level monsters rather than just the undead.As monsters specialized in stealth, the Shadow Demons pounced at Zich soundlessly. One of them jumped on Zich from the front while the other two slid into the shadows. Whenever Zich showed the smallest amount of vulnerability, they soared out from the ground and tried to end his life.The Shadow Demon that came towards him head-on lifted its scythe, which it had for hands. Its blow was sharp and fast.But\u2026\u201cWhy are you fighting me head-on when your single asset is assassination?\u201dWhoosh!Zich\u2019s sword was much faster than its speed. The moment that the Shadow Demon\u2019s scythe reached him, Zich\u2019s sword had already sliced its head off.Pop! Pop!The two other Shadow Demons burst out from the shadows to attack his weak points. Rather, they tried to burst out.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201dCrack!Even while retrieving his sword, Zich didn\u2019t lose his sense of balance. He raised one of his feet and stepped on the head of the Shadow Demon that tried to get out of the shadow.Shadow Demons didn\u2019t specialize in durability. Thus, their heads cracked like watermelons at Zich\u2019s feet that were filled with mana. The last Shadow Demon that tried to pull its body completely out of the shadows was also unsuccessful.Slash!Zich\u2019s sword came flying in its direction again, and the monster split into two. After killing the three demons, Zich spat, \u201cBastards, what are they swinging their dirty scythes for?\u201dThey had successfully handled their immediate danger, but Lubella\u2019s expression still didn\u2019t brighten up.\u201cMr. Zich! How could a Shadow Demon be here?\u201dLubella\u2019s voice was smeared with a sense of danger, but to her frustration, Zich responded calmly.\u201cThose Bellid guys must have summoned them.\u201d\u201cHow?! Their ritual should have lost power!\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s only one answer: the ritual didn\u2019t lose its power.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t Zich who answered. Lubella quickly turned her body to find the voice\u2019s owner. But before she could, a sudden vibration overtook them.Ruuuuumble!The whole building shook. It felt like a high-magnitude earthquake. As the picture frames hanging on the walls and the decorations fell and broke into pieces, Lubella let out a scream. The wall split into parts, and Zich supported Lubella as she was about to fall. Even with the severe vibrations, Zich still maintained his balance.\u201cW-what is this?\u201d\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s the force of the ritual.\u201d\u201cThe ritual?\u201d\u2018I thought the ritual became weaker thanks to our efforts. Wasn\u2019t the ritual\u2019s completion pushed to a later date too?\u2019 All kinds of questions circled around Lubella\u2019s head.\u201cHow\u2026!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here first. Hold on tight!\u201dZich wrapped his left hand around Lubella\u2019s waist. Then, with his sword, he struck down the wall with great force. The mana blazed, and a huge shockwave exploded.Crash!The mansion\u2019s walls broke off easily, and Zich jumped out of the hole.Land!They landed in the garden. Then, Zich walked a couple of more steps to increase his distance from the mansion.Crash!Not long after they escaped, the mansion crumbled with a huge sound. It was a bleak and pitiful ending of a mansion that had been the city\u2019s biggest, fanciest building that had housed the city\u2019s sovereign: the Mayor.Crumble!On top of the building crumbling, its whole foundation sank. It almost looked as if the ground was devouring the mansion with its mouth wide open. Lubella stared at the hole where the building\u2019s remains disappeared. She couldn\u2019t wrap her head around everything that was happening.Lubella tried to organize the chaos in front of her when she spotted something.\u201c\u2026Bellu\u2019s statue?\u201dIt floated arrogantly on top of the ruined grounds. Lubella thought the statue was mocking her, and she felt like a clown, running around for a false hope.Puff!Something sprouted out from the ground and shot up. It was water, probably from the groundwater that ran below the mansion. The water shot to the sky and fell like rain into the empty hole and began to change the hole into a fountain.\u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201dShe heard the voice again. It was the voice that had answered Lubella\u2019s question last time. Lubella turned her head.\u201c\u2026Deputy Mayor.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t dislike the title of Deputy Mayor, but isn\u2019t it about time for you to call me by my real name? My name is Allid Grotim, Karuwiman Saint Candidate Lubella.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t granted you permission to call my last name!\u201d\u201cThen, should I call you by your first name? Like Aine.\u201dLubella gritted her teeth. But Grotim didn\u2019t feel intimidated at all, and his small laughs agitated her. Lubella took some deep breaths and calmed her mind. This wasn\u2019t the time to get angry. She needed to figure out the whole story.\u201cIt seems like you are the one who destroyed the mansion and brought the water out.\u201d\u201cOf course, I am the one who did that. It\u2019s the start of the ritual for our great god, Bellu.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re lying.\u201dLubella\u2019s throat became dry. She repressed the uneasy feeling rising inside her heart and murmured. However, when she replied to Grotim, her rough voice cracked, \u201cYour ritual\u2019s powers became weak. So, the ritual\u2019s due date should have been postponed.\u201dGrotim burst out in laughter. It was a mocking laugh that seemed to delightfully ridicule a fool who had been tricked.\u201cI received reports that you both were working diligently to block the ritual from happening. I really admire your fortitude, and I am sorry to give you some disappointing news.\u201dContrary to what he said, Grotim didn\u2019t look sorry at all. It looked like his mouth itched to tell them everything he knew. Lubella wanted to block her ears and not listen to him. But she couldn\u2019t do that, and Grotim\u2019s words mercilessly hit her ears.\u201cEverything you guys did was all useless. It didn\u2019t bother our ritual even one bit!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She could barely maintain her balance, and she couldn\u2019t stop her body from shaking.\u201cWhy? But wasn\u2019t the ritual\u2019s strength definitely weakening? And weren\u2019t the numbers of the undead also decreasing?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s because I manipulated the surroundings to make it appear that way. I wanted to trick you guys into thinking that the ritual was weakening. How was it? Didn\u2019t I do a good job?\u201d\u201cYou c-controlled it in that\u2026!\u201d\u201cYes, I was in control the whole time.\u201dGrotim winked at Lubella.\u201cWhen the ritual is finished, I can control the undead without limits. I thought pretty hard about how I could convince you both that the ritual was slowly weakening. In a way, this might be my life\u2019s masterpiece. Seeing how both of you have been tricked so thoroughly, I\u2019m beyond delighted by how well everything has turned out.\u201dSnap!Grotim snapped his fingers.Swoosh! Swoosh!Something under the lake began to come out in bursts. Soon, undead creatures and monsters spread out all over the place and began to surround Zich and Lubella. All of them were powerful, high-level undead creatures and monsters. Lubella couldn\u2019t even react in shock and helplessly watched the undead creatures and monsters surround her and Zich. Her mouth moved, but no sound came out.\u201cAs you can see, I can summon the undead and monsters with no problems.\u201dThe undead creatures and monsters began to advance past the surrounding areas, and Lubella shouted in shock, \u201cAre you going to attack the citizens\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh, you don\u2019t have to worry. I\u2019m not planning to do that just yet. I\u2019m just sending them further off to expand the surrounding areas. I\u2019m being extra cautious because both of you escaped from me last time.\u201dGrotim scratched his chin.\u201cBut if you guys try to resist, I might become so surprised that my minions might become too excited.\u201dAs soon as he said this, they heard shouts and screams of people surprised to see the undead creatures and monsters. However, it seemed like Grotim was telling them the truth. For now, the undead creatures and monsters were really just acting as guards to surround them. Lubella breathed a sigh of relief, seeing that there was no human casualty so far; however, she knew the situation could change at any moment.Looking at the numerous monsters and undead creatures all around her, Lubella shifted her attention back to Zich. While holding his sword, Zich was on guard.\u201c\u2026What happened?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou told me that what we did would successfully weaken the ritual!\u201d\u201cAh, I think I can reply to that question.\u201d Grotim intervened and began talking, \u201cFrom my investigation, it seems like you tried to interrupt the ritual by drawing weird pictures on the statues. You thought the life force embedded into the statue went directly underwater, and the central statue over there controlled everything. That man next to you spouted nonsense that the ritual could be reversed. But as a faithful follower of the great Bellu, I can assure you that there is no way to stop the ritual!\u201dGrotim\u2019s words completely shattered Lubella\u2019s hopes.\u201cIn addition, did he also say that he knew how to return people\u2019s life force to their original bodies? As a Karuwiman, you should have known that it\u2019s impossible. I can\u2019t believe you believed in that man\u2019s ridiculous words.\u201dAccording to Grotim, it was impossible to heal Timmy\u2019s younger brother. Lubella grew despondent while thinking of the child\u2019s skeletal body.\u201cWhen I first saw those ridiculous drawings on the statues, I had a very good laugh. Did you seriously think that those drawings could be a magic circle? You are much too na\u00efve. Or did you desperately cling to the only solution in front of you while turning away from reality? If that is what happened, I pity you soooo much. Well, I guess even if it sounded like a joke, you must have wanted to believe in that man\u2019s words.\u201dGrotim gave Zich a look of complete reassurance over his victory. On the other hand, Zich did not respond to him at all.\u201c\u2026Then, are you saying that you can carry out the ritual right now?\u201d\u201cYeah. Everything is ready.\u201d\u201cThen why did you even waste your time, tricking us into thinking that we were successfully interrupting the ritual!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because of you, Aine Lubella.\u201d\u201c\u2026Because of me?\u201d\u201cThe Karuwiman Saint Candidate. You are a satisfactory\u2014no, an extraordinary spoil from this master plan. How can I stand still when such a prized possession is in front of me? I have to take you aside and put you in our order.\u201dGrotim crossed his arms.\u201cWhen you first came to the Mayor\u2019s mansion, I was actually overjoyed. I thought Bellu\u2019s will was gracing upon me. But as expected of a vile follower of the God Karuna, you managed to escape from my hands.\u201dFor the first time, his voice expressed clear displeasure.\u201cWhen I first tried to capture you, I failed because of the Holy Knights. The second time, I failed because that punk next to you damaged the Key. Honestly, when that man next to you said that he would escape right in front of me, I felt all the energy in my body leave because I thought I would never have another chance to catch you again. But then, he said a very funny thing afterwards.\u201dAt that time, Zich\u2019s words had sounded very foolish to Grotim, but they made him feel hopeful again.\u201cHe said that he knew how to interrupt the ritual and that you\u2019d come back to destroy the main statue.\u201dWhen Zich said this, Grotim\u2019s head filled with hope again as he thought that he had another chance to capture Lubella.\u201cI planned so that both of you would think that you were successfully blocking the ritual and appear in front of me again. Was it not strange? Wasn\u2019t it odd finding the statues so easily when both of you had no idea where they were?\u201dLubella also thought it was strange. She had quelled down her suspicions by thinking that it was because of how great Zich\u2019s abilities were. But thinking back on it, they found the statues too quickly in such a short amount of time with no clue about their locations.\u201cIn order for you to find the statues easily, I employed many soldiers to guard them. Without knowing that I was leading you on, you did a good job falling right into my trap.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then you had no plans to stop us in the first place.\u201d\u201cEven if I had ordered my soldiers to capture you, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to find you anyways. And why would I have to do such a useless thing when you two will appear in front of me at the time I want you to do? That\u2019s why I even purposely posted a sloppy drawing of that man so that you two could have an easier time moving around.\u201dIt was like they had been playing in the palm of his hands the whole time.\u201cBut don\u2019t get too disappointed. Because of you, I didn\u2019t employ the ritual right away, and you were able to extend the lives of Porti\u2019s citizens for a few more days. With this, you have done your share.\u201d\u201cWhat would have happened if we hadn\u2019t come to you?\u201d\u201cThen it couldn\u2019t have been helped. I would have started the ritual even though you might be swept into it. We were also in a time crunch. We have to finish everything before the Kingdom or Karuwiman begins to interfere with our plans.\u201dGrotim made a giant smile after he finished talking.\u201cDid I satisfy your curiosity? I wanted you to come back here because I\u2019m about to execute the ritual. I can\u2019t let you get swept up in it after all the work I put in.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you destroyed the building because it doesn\u2019t matter anymore if you are caught.\u201d\u201cYes. It doesn\u2019t matter anyway because everyone in Porti will become our faithful soldiers soon. We don\u2019t have to try anymore.\u201dLubella closed her eyes for a moment. All sorts of emotions and regrets stirred in her mind. However, when she opened her eyes again, Grotim was impressed by the look in her eyes.\u201cShould I have expected this from a Karuwiman Saint Candidate? In that short amount of time, you calmed yourself down.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s from all the surprises you planned for me. Thanks to you, I think I was able to maximize my experiences, which was the purpose of this trip.\u201d\u201cNo matter how many experiences they gain, there are a lot of folks who never grow mentally or physically. You certainly might have been the next Saint. It\u2019s really all the better for us. All your work has been meaningless.\u201d\u201cYou never know until the end.\u201d Lubella brought out her staff.Grotim looked at her with mockery.\u201cWell, I salute your bravery. I threatened you with the citizen\u2019s lives a moment ago, but I\u2019m not going to hold them hostage. They are all going to be talents for our army anyways. But you can try your best.\u201dSnap!Grotim snapped his fingers a second time.Thud!The undead creatures and monsters began to move in unison towards Lubella and Zich. Their combined force was alarming, and Lubella found herself taking a step back despite her firm resolution.\u201cMr. Zich.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dZich hadn\u2019t spoken a single word since their first encounter with Grotim. Lubella thought it was because Zich felt guilty about causing them more danger unintentionally. However, Lubella did not blame Zich at all. Even though she would probably have to face horrible pain after she was captured, she wanted to say this to Zich: \u201cI don\u2019t blame you at all.\u201dEven in this dangerous situation, she smiled at Zich.\u201cInstead, I am thankful to you. Even though the results ended up being like this, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you kept trying to help me. No, if you weren\u2019t here, my life might have ended in that dirty alleyway where you found me.\u201d\u201cWhat a touching sight.\u201dGrotim sneered at Lubella\u2019s words, but Lubella completely ignored him.\u201cEven though it was a little clumsy, I now know for sure that you really tried hard to live a kind life. That dream of yours is really a valuable and precious thing. It\u2019s going to be very hard, but try your best to run away. I will try my best to stop them. And I hope that you continue to work hard towards your dream. Just remember that even though other people laughed at your efforts and dreams, I always cheered for you.\u201d\u201cHey, hey. There\u2019s no way I will let him go. Don\u2019t try to take care of him like that. It\u2019s too good for someone like him.\u201dAfter mocking Lubella, Grotim switched his attention back to Zich.\u201cAnd you should also take responsibility. You kept giving this woman false hope and swung her here and there. Take responsibility by putting your life on the line. If you are a man, you should do at least that much. Even if you didn\u2019t know anything\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it that I didn\u2019t know?\u201dZich finally opened his mouth. Grotim was taken back. Zich\u2019s voice was way too calm despite the situation they were in.\u2018Does this punk not know the situation he\u2019s in right now?\u2019It could be true; he was the one who drew those strange, crude drawings as a magic circle on those statues after all. He might not have been a sane person in the first place.\u201cThose weird drawings that you drew on the statues\u2014I don\u2019t know where you got such a strange idea that those things would work, but all of your efforts were useless. Instead of solving the problem, all you guys did was play right into my hand and drove yourselves into the corner.\u201d\u201cAh, that?\u201dZich\u2019s voice was still calm. And as if it was nothing, he dropped the bomb.\u201cI already knew all that.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI knew that you were trying to lure Lubella in, so you were helping us get to the statues.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dGrotim and Lubella were on opposite sides at every possible aspect, but at this moment, they were united in their shock. They looked at Zich with wide eyes. Grotim\u2019s shock seemed to have impacted the undead creatures and monsters because they also stopped.\u201c\u2026Sigh. I have no time for your nonsense. If that is true, why did you bring Lubella to me?\u201d\u201cObviously, it was to end you.\u201dZich swung his swords around to make his point, and Grotim scoffed at his words.\u201cAnd how would you do that? Do you seriously think you have any chance of victory in this situation?\u201dUndead creatures and monsters surrounded them. Even though Zich was skilled, it seemed impossible for them to escape.\u201cIt would be impossible with just the two of us.\u201dThis was annoying to admit, but it was true. If Zich was back in his Demon Lord days, he could have destroyed all the undead creatures and monsters in a split second, but it was impossible to do so in his current state. However, it was because he knew all this that Zich made this double-trap plan.\u201cDid you seriously think I went around drawing those darn magic circles cause I thought they would have some kind of effect on your power?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dGrotim\u2019s and Lubella\u2019s hearts took another hit.\u201c\u2026You went around drawing those magic circles even though you knew there was no effect?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cFor what purpose?\u201dUntil now, Grotim thought Zich and Lubella were all playing in the palm of his hand and looking down on them. However, if Zich were right, his feeling of superiority would have all been an illusion, and their situations would be completely flipped.While Zich continued to calmly explain his side of the story, Grotim\u2019s frown began to grow deeper.\u201cFirst of all, the reason why we came here is simple. It\u2019s to bring down a bastard like you.\u201d\u201cBring me down?\u201d\u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t want you to escape and leave an uncomfortable feeling behind.\u201dMoreover, Zich didn\u2019t want to waste the opportunity to crush Grotim\u2019s spirit and hope. Grotim was silent, but after a few moments, he burst out laughing.\u201cHahahahahahah! To bring me down? Are you not able to remember what just came out of your mouth? You told me with your own mouth that it would be impossible for you two to defeat me! And now you just change your mind? Hahahhaha!\u201dBecause of how hard he was laughing, Grotim clutched his stomach, and tears came out of his eyes. Then he wiped his tears and said, \u201cAs expected, you are not in your right mind. Fine, let\u2019s say that everything is going according to your plan. Then what\u2019s going to happen now? Are you going to say you lied about how it was impossible for just the two of you to beat me?\u201d\u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t a lie. Just the two of us have no chance against you.\u201dZich shrugged his shoulders, and the smile did not leave his face.\u201cAs I said, if it was just the two of us.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Are you telling me you have a backup or something? Sorry to inform you, but it\u2019s too late for the Kingdom or the Karuwimans to come.\u201d\u201cBut there is one. A backup.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou said I was mistaken in thinking that I could interrupt the ritual and went around bringing Lubella everywhere. But that was not it. I was trying to buy time all along.\u201dGrotim\u2019s face, which had been smiling a moment ago, hardened.\u201cI didn\u2019t warn you that I would be destroying those statues for no reason. I did it because I wanted you to think that we would come back to you. I was trying to make you push the date of the ritual.\u201dZich\u2019s voice was lively, and his tone was cheerful. In contrast, Grotim\u2019s face began to worsen slowly.\u201cI thought you would definitely push the date of the ritual since you would want Lubella\u2014a \u2018prized possession.\u2019 You must have helped us so that we could meet you as soon as possible. Well, it was kind of funny how I tricked you into thinking that we were all in the palm of your hand.\u201d\u201cMr. Zich, then are you saying that what we did before and even this situation was all according to your plan?\u201d\u201cYes, that is what I am saying.\u201dLubella\u2019s face was not that different from Grotim\u2019s. No, her face seemed more shocked than his.\u201cYou also tricked me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know how good you were at acting. Aren\u2019t you a bad liar? Also, my plan wouldn\u2019t have been impacted whether or not you knew about this plan.\u201dZich\u2019s confident and bold reply made Lubella speechless.\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me before? You apologized for doubting my knowledge, and then I told you that there\u2019s no need for you to be sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026Was that not just modesty?\u201d\u201cNo, it was not.\u201dPrepared for the fight of her life, Lubella lost all her strength at Zich\u2019s words.\u201cD-don\u2019t make me laugh!\u201dGrotim finally realized that he had been played all along, and his face was bright red.\u201cA backup! There\u2019s no way you guys have something like that! Look at the situation right now! There\u2019s nobody else but just you two! Stop spouting outright lies!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t lie.\u201d\u201cThen what is that backup you are talking about!\u201d\u201cAh, you want to know?\u201dIt was at that moment.Boom!A massive explosion erupted near the mansion. Zich smiled brightly.\u201cDo you know Belri Weig?\u201d\u2018Or do you know him as Tasnia\u2019s Killing Machine?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cBelri Weig?\u201d\u201cSir Weig?\u201dLubella and Grotim spoke at the same time, but their tones were like opposites. Whereas Lubella\u2019s voice was filled with delight and happiness, Grotim\u2019s voice was overwhelmed with confusion and fear.\u201cWeig? Belri Weig? That monster is here?\u201dMany powerful figures appeared in the soon-to-be chaotic world, but the methods they used to gain their strengths were all different. Some diligently trained during a time of peace and were strong before the chaos. Some grew stronger via the difficulties they faced in the chaos, and some gained their powers instantly by using a strengthening item. Others received their strength from another powerful figure.Zich was the type who had gained his power by the difficulties he faced in the chaos. On the other hand, Weig was the perfect example of someone who hadn\u2019t slacked off on his training in a time of peace and was strong before the chaos.So, even during a time of peace, Weig used his impressive strength to fight against Karuwiman\u2019s enemies. Of course, these enemies included Karuwiman\u2019s arch-nemesis, the Bellid. There was no way that Grotim didn\u2019t know Weig\u2019s name.\u201cDon\u2019t lie! How could that monster be here?!\u201dGrotim was the most shocked he had ever been since meeting Lubella and Zich; that was how much of a household name Weig was.\u201cHe is the captain of the bodyguards who protect Lady Lubella. He just had something to take care of when he arrived in the city and was gone for a bit. Thankfully, his mission was at a nearby place, so we could order a person to call him.\u201d\u2018Now that I think about it, Mr. Zich asked me about Sir Weig\u2019s mission before!\u201dLubella recalled Zich\u2019s question which she had answered without much thought.\u201cW-when did you call him?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that I ordered Hans to do an errand for me? This is what I asked him to do.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dLubella remembered Zich\u2019s servant.\u2018You were already thinking about calling Sir Weig then?\u2019But how was that possible?\u201cEven if Sir Weig was closer to us than the headquarters or any subdivision, his mission should have taken him quite far away from here. How were you able to call him?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s thanks to Hans\u2019 efforts.\u201dZich smiled jokingly, and Lubella couldn\u2019t ask another question. The undead and monsters that surrounded them began to move.\u201cHa, even if my opponent is Belri Weig, my army has enough strength. This is actually better. I should take this chance to take that guy\u2019s head as a souvenir to bring home!\u201d Grotim arrogantly shouted. The army in charge of the siege outside began to move where the explosion was.\u201cWill it be alright?\u201dLubella worried for Weig. She knew that he was an incredible Holy Knight, but the army that Grotim led also looked formidable. However, Zich wasn\u2019t concerned at all.\u201cIt will be alright.\u201d\u2018No need to worry about a person who can calmly get out of a greater hell than this one.\u2019Crash!As if it agreed with Zich\u2019s thoughts, another explosion rang across the surroundings again. Everyone stared at where the blast came from.\u201cA-As expected of Belri Weig, but he is still just by himself\u2026!\u201dCrash!The explosion was much closer to them this time, and the shock of the holy powers reached them.Drop!Something dropped down from the sky. Zich flicked away the materials that were falling on top of his and Lubella\u2019s heads.\u201c\u2026This is.\u201dGrotim checked one of the things that fell: an arm dripping with blood and cracked legs. At a glance, they looked like parts of a slaughtered man. However, they weren\u2019t human body parts but of the undead and monsters.\u201c\u2026\u201dGrotim didn\u2019t open his mouth anymore.Crash! Crash! Crash!An explosive sound rang out again; holy powers and explosions grew closer to them.\u201cLook at this. It\u2019s no joke, right?\u201dZich tilted his head in a mocking way, and the corner of Grotim\u2019s mouth twitched. Grotim wanted to stomp on Zich\u2019s spiteful face, but the explosive soundwaves and holy power complicated his thoughts.\u201c\u2026\u201dGrotim looked around his surroundings. He looked where the explosion came from, once where the remaining army was, and once where Lubella and Zich were. As if he was making the greatest decision of his life, the wrinkles on his forehead deepened.However, that didn\u2019t last long. Grotim\u2019s eyes rested on Zich and Lubella.\u201cHave you made your decision now?\u201dAs if Zich was sick of waiting, he provoked Grotim.\u201cNo matter how incredible Weig is, it\u2019s over if the ritual affects him.\u201dGrotim stared at Lubella.\u201cWell, I will take the spoils of war first.\u201d\u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t know a single thing about tactics. In a situation like this, you should escape. It\u2019s not like you guys are part of an Order of Holy Knights and can\u2019t show your backs to your opponents. Come on, you guys are cowards who run away like cockroaches and do stupid shit like this. Why can\u2019t you judge the situation well?\u201d\u201c\u2026Even if I suffer greater losses by fleeing late, I will make sure to give you the most painful death!\u201dAs the situation didn\u2019t unravel according to his expectations, Grotim finally exploded. He shot out his murderous intent straight at Zich.\u201cAy! So scary. If I really get captured, I won\u2019t escape in one piece.\u201dAlthough the undead and monsters closed the distance between them, Zich didn\u2019t even blink. Instead, the smile on his lips deepened.\u201cBut you know\u2026\u201d Zich exerted more strength into his grip and shook his sword lightly. \u201cWhy are you treating me like a tool that you can just put in and take out of your pockets? You don\u2019t know your place.\u201d\u201cYour insignificant life is nothing I can\u2019t take if I just wish for it!\u201dWith Grotim\u2019s shout, monsters and the undead began to pounce on Zich. There were many of them and they were strong, but Zich wasn\u2019t discouraged.\u201cBring it on,\u201d Zich murmured and raised his sword. An immense amount of mana shot out and surrounded his body.Wing!\u201cWhat?\u201dHis power suddenly grew significantly. Zich turned around and saw Lubella with her eyes closed and her staff raised. A light beam shone from her body.\u201cSince they are protected by Bellid\u2019s energy, my holy powers won\u2019t work on the undead. But you at least don\u2019t have to worry about your wounds. Although it\u2019s a bit embarrassing for me to say this, my skills are the best among the Saint Candidates. I can heal most wounds.\u201d\u201cHow reliable.\u201dThey weren\u2019t empty words. Lubella really seemed reliable\u2014 afterall, she was the one who had defeated Zich with the hero before his regression. Of course, her skills and experience were lacking compared to that time, but her words provided a great sense of security.\u2018If I had even one support like Lubella at that time, I wouldn\u2019t have lost.\u201dHe might\u2019ve even corned the hero and achieved an overwhelming victory.Zich stabilized the power that burst out from him. Then, he raised his sword high and sliced the air. A turbulent wave of mana poured out from his sword.Slice!The sword\u2019s mana flew far away and indiscriminately shredded and sliced its surroundings. He couldn\u2019t cut the whole area in half like he had done in his prime. However, this was enough to decrease the total number of undead and monsters.Slice! Slice! Slice!Cutting sounds followed one after another.Some avoided the slices with quick movements or intercepted the attacks from the front, and others faced the attacks head-on and withstood them with their rigid bodies. However, the bodies of many undead and monsters that failed to do that were shredded in pieces.\u201cHey, don\u2019t you think your plans are failing? Shouldn\u2019t you bring back some of the guys you sent?\u201dOf course, if Weig arrived faster by doing that, Zich didn\u2019t plan to take responsibility.\u201cYou bastard! Boast after taking care of my whole army first!\u201dLike Grotim said, Zich had finished off most of the weak monsters, and there were still many monsters and the undead to take care of. Furthermore, the monsters that were left were the more advanced types.\u201cIs that right? Then, I will say it afterward.\u201dZich began to move in with a full swing.Crash!Zich blocked the sharp nails of a monster that jumped on him.Scratch!An ear-splitting sound rang out at the contact of the sword\u2019s body and his fingernails, and three undead took the chance to run towards Zich. At that moment, Zich relaxed his grip. His sword was pushed back.Rattle!The monster that had flung its nails lost its balance and leaned its body forward. Its head touched Zich\u2019s knees.Crash!The monster\u2019s head cracked. A collection of bone pieces, blood, and brain fluids bloomed out.Whish!Zich placed extra pressure into his other foot and then spun his body around; he also laid his body flat.Flash!A rusty knife blade whizzed passed the place where his torso used to be\u2014 a headless corpse had shot it.Clutch!Zich grabbed the headless corpse\u2019s wrist and pulled. Then, he bounced his body off from the rebound. They both swung their swords at the same time.Slice! Slice! Slice!One went down at every swing. Zich\u2019s sword snaked through the gaps between the complex assembly of the undead and precisely hit their heads.Drop! Drop! Drop! Drop!The first set of monsters and undead all fell almost simultaneously. At this sight, Grotim\u2019s face stiffened while Lubella\u2019s face brightened in vivid contrast.\u201cBring more in.\u201dZich gestured towards Grotim and provoked him. The next set of monsters and undead came forward, and Zich\u2019s sword danced again.\u2018Amazing!\u2019Because she had received a lot of help from Zich, she was aware that Zich possessed considerable skill and power. But it was her first time seeing him fight so earnestly. It seemed as if Zich could predict his opponent\u2019s next moves, and his movements were fast and strong but not at a level where she couldn\u2019t see them. Still, his enemies\u2019 attacks failed to reach him while all of his attacks landed.\u201cDamn it!\u201dIn the end, Grotim cursed and changed his orders.\u201cAttack the girl too. It\u2019s fine to rip off her arm or leg! It\u2019s fine as long as she is still alive.\u201d\u201cDid you hear that?\u201dZich glanced behind him after shooting off a monster\u2019s head.\u201cThat\u2019s a pity. You were a good shield.\u201dZich benefitted from having Lubella behind his back as the monsters and the undead tried to attack while avoiding her. However, it seemed like this perk was now gone.\u201cDon\u2019t treat someone else like a shield!\u201d Lubella fixed her grip on the staff and grumbled. \u201cThey are going to attack you for real now. Will you be alright?\u201d\u201c\u2026Actually, it\u2019s not going to be alright.\u201dAlthough Lubella regularly trained her physique, she had never learned battling skills. She wasn\u2019t sure if she could be of much help in a siege like this.\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine. I didn\u2019t think you would be of much help.\u201d\u201c\u2026I thought this before, but are you aware that your way of talking is quite annoying?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help it because I have a nasty temper.\u201dWhile snorting, Zich fixed his posture.\u201cYou stay right there, Lady Lubella. Don\u2019t try to attack, counterattack, or even avoid the attacks. Just stay still and don\u2019t do anything.\u201dThump!Blocking the attack that flew towards Lubella, Zich\u2019s sword bounced off.Lubella flinched.\u201c\u2026You want me to stay still? Here?\u201d\u201cAh, please continue to support and heal me. You can do that without moving, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the case, but\u2026no, how could you just tell me to stay still!\u201dThump! Thump!Attacks bounced off from Zich\u2019s sword again, and every time they did, Lubella\u2019s body trembled a bit.\u201cThen, can you avoid these guys\u2019 attacks?\u201dThump! Thump! Thump!Lubella shook her head.\u201c\u2026You have to protect me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dLubella gathered her hands and searched for her god Karuna more fervently than ever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Okay, I warned her.\u2019Zich glanced at their surroundings. Undead creatures and monsters were all ganging up on them. He had to stay in place while protecting Lubella.\u2018Well, that\u2019s easy.\u2019Zich moved as fast as the wind.Crash! Slice! Crash! Slice!Zich avoided the attacks that came towards him, blocked the attacks that came towards Lubella, and twisted his sword between the undead creatures and monsters to kill them off. Zich launched a series of attacks without stopping, but the only ones that fell were the undead and monsters.On the other hand, it was important to consider that Zich\u2019s efficiency in battle was cut down by half since he also had to protect Lubella. From a glance, it seemed as if Grotim had an advantage. However, Zich\u2019s face was still calm and peaceful while Grotim\u2019s face began to look uglier and uglier.\u201cSo what are you gonna do! If you don\u2019t quickly bring me down, the \u2018Killing Machine,\u2019 Belri Weig, is going to come and defeat you!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m warning you out of the goodness in my heart. If you don\u2019t retreat right now, you might be in serious trouble.\u201d\u201cI told you to shut the fuck up!\u201dGrotim began to respond very emotionally. His nervousness and fear began to swallow him gradually.\u2018I guess it can\u2019t be helped.\u2019Grotim hardened his heart and took out something from his pockets. It was the book called \u2018Key.\u2019 The page that Zich had ripped was fixed, and it now looked as good as new. As soon as Grotim opened the book, an ominous aura drifted out.Screech! Screech! Screeeeeeeech!Screams echoed throughout the whole space. They sounded like a combination of cries of people being tortured, the sound of nails scratching on a chalkboard, and ghosts shrieking curses in the air.Kwaaaaaa!Gurgg! Gurgg!Tatatatatak!Monsters and the undead began to also scream out loud. As if they were cheering for the sounds coming out of the book, it was a frightening scene to behold.\u201cOkay, I admit it! You are one annoying bastard! Even more than those Karuwiman bastards! I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m getting so distracted by a dude who just popped out of nowhere!\u201d\u201cWhat? Aren\u2019t you complimenting me too much?\u201dIt was very rare for a Bellid to hate someone more than a Karuwiman.\u201cSay whatever the fuck you want. You won\u2019t be able to use your mouth for long!\u201dGrotim lifted his book. As if the book had its own will, the book\u2019s pages began to flip by themselves.\u201cAre you going to use that? If you use the power of the Key, won\u2019t the ritual be delayed?\u201d\u201cBy a bit! A tiny bit! It won\u2019t matter if I use it once to kill you!\u201d\u201cCan you even properly use it? The Mayor who you also used as the \u2018Key\u2019 died in my hands. Aren\u2019t the powers that you can control very limited?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need much power to kill you!\u201d\u201cWhat about Lubella? Our precious Lubella might be swept by your attack.\u201d\u201cWell, it can\u2019t be helped.\u201dAs the situation worsened for him, Grotim began to half-give up on Lubella. Zich clicked his tongue.\u201cSad. I was going to keep using Lubella as the shield if he couldn\u2019t give up on her.\u201d\u201cPlease think those thoughts in your mind so I don\u2019t hear them!\u201d Lubella also seemed to be sick of Zich\u2019s antics and shouted at him.Rumbling!A column of water rose from the lake. It was large enough to swallow several buildings easily. As if it was a giant snake, it began to twist its body; then its head began to head towards Zich and Lubella.The undead and monsters began to force themselves upon Zich and Lubella. Without caring about any of their injuries, they pushed themselves in without cooperation or connection. The whole purpose was to prevent Zich and Lubella from escaping.\u201cShould I also stay still even in this situation?\u201dEven though the situation was very dangerous, Lubella remained calm. She was confident that Zich would not leave her alone and run away by himself.\u201cYes, you are exactly right. However, please prepare to use your healing magic.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. That\u2019s my specialty.\u201dZich\u2019s sword style changed. Before, his sword style was defensive and focused on interception, but now his sword style was rough, aggressive, and focused on cutting down as many enemies as he could.Swish! Crush!Zich\u2019s menacing sword style destroyed everything in his reach. The wall, made up of undead creatures and monsters, began to loosen up and crumble at once. However, his new sword style had some drawbacks as he sacrificed defense for offense.Pierce! Crush!A few attacks passed through Zich\u2019s defense and injured his body. Even though Zich moved to avoid fatal injuries, he received a couple of pretty serious blows. Instead, he concentrated most of his defense in blocking all the attacks towards Lubella, and she did not receive a single hit. Moreover, anyone who injured Zich\u2019s body died as soon as they made contact.\u201cI\u2019m going to heal you now!\u201dAll of Zich\u2019s injuries disappeared in a second. Even the poison in his body was gone. Lubella\u2019s holy powers were extremely impressive. With Lubella\u2019s support, Zich was able to push back the undead and monsters somewhat successfully.Grotim began shooting the water column at them.\u201cDieeeeeee!\u201dBoom!Formidable water pressure soared above the earth and loomed closer as if it planned to crush everything. Zich stared at it and watched it come down.Swish!Zich readjusted his stance in the small space he had made to separate him and Lubella from the undead creatures and monsters. He pulled his sword back and tensed all his muscles.Zing!The sword vibrated and mana began to surround it like a whirlpool. Zich\u2019s eyes became sharper.A water column shot out and struck where Zich was. In the opposite direction, Zich slowly pierced the air where the column was heading.Burst!With that clear sound, the space distorted, and intangible forces shot up. Zich continued to shoot out Piercing Space attacks at the water column. Soon, the shots swallowed up the column.Craaaaash!The ground rumbled. The pressure that the water column hit the ground with was great enough to sweep the undead and monsters away instantly.\u201cHuff!\u201dGrotim breathed heavily. While scowling, he looked down at the Key.\u2018Damn it! As expected, it consumes too much energy!\u201dLike Zich said, losing the Mayor had been critical.\u2018But still, with this much\u2026!\u2019It seemed that damn Zich had done something, but Grotim thought it was all useless.\u2018But if that guy tried to save Lubella, that girl might still be alive.\u2019If that was the case, his victory was clear.\u2018If I get a hold of the Saint candidate and get Belri Weig mixed into the ritual and kill him, my position in the Church will become firmer than anyone else.\u2019Just the thought of his sweet future made him glad. But it was too early to celebrate.\u201cIs this all? No matter what, they are just worshipers of a fish head.\u201dGrotim heard a rude and annoying voice, and his eyes became big as if they would pop out.\u201cH-How?\u201dAfter the water column collapsed, the whole area was flooded with water. The remains of monsters and the undead that had been swept away by the disaster floated everywhere like blocks of wood. However, his targets, Zich and Lubella, were completely fine.They were soaked from the water, but that was all. They didn\u2019t look like they were wounded or had a single scratch on their bodies.\u201cMy powers should have swallowed you\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh, that?\u201dZich stopped squeezing water out of his clothes to answer.\u201cAn attack that uses mass and water pressure isn\u2019t bad. But no matter how big the water column is, the surface area we come into contact with is not much. If we pierce through the area and decrease the water pressure, all we get hit by is a waterfall that shoots down from a bit higher than usual.\u201dZich turned his head.\u201cBut there\u2019s someone who will lose their senses over just that.\u201dLubella sneezed while looking like a mouse drenched in water. She looked like someone who had just been saved from drowning.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t feel too good. This underground water stinks of Bellu\u2019s smell.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s too bad.\u201d Zich expressed his regrets.\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh! There was so much power in my attack. How could it disperse so easily?\u201d\u201cPoor you, you don\u2019t know anything,\u201d Zich said while clicking his tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s called skills that make it possible, you idiot.\u201dIt was also the skill that the Demon Lord had learned in a time of chaos.\u201cOkay, then, what are you going to do now? Because of your great power, your underlings were all swept away.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be too full of yourself because you happened to block one mass attack. The Key\u2019s power is not just\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s enough.\u201d Zich cut off Grotim\u2019s words, \u201cYou are done.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsen\u2014!\u201dCrash!There was the sound of an explosion, but unlike before, it was very close. Like a rusty windmill, Grotim slowly turned his head.He was there in front of the Mayor\u2019s mansion walls where the wet debris had gathered. His usual neat, white hair was in a mess, and his body was smeared with all kinds of blood, flesh, and bone fragments. His chilly gaze made him look like the grim reaper of the afterworld. No, to Grotim, he was the grim reaper. Karuwiman\u2019s greatest fighter had arrived.\u201cI told you. If you miscalculate the time to retreat, it could mean some serious trouble,\u201d Zich flaunted.Lubella was happy to see Weig.\u201cSir Weig!\u201d\u201cAre you alright, Lady Lubella?\u201dWeig\u2019s eyes immediately softened as if he was talking to his granddaughter. Lubella felt like she couldn\u2019t control her emotions. After Weig\u2019s departure, Lubella had grown innerly by experiencing so much hardship, but in front of Weig, it was hard for her to hold back her tears.Tears trickled down from her eyes, and Weig felt his last piece of patience fly away when he saw Lubella crying. He cared for her like his own granddaughter.\u201cYoouuu baaastard!\u201d Weig\u2019s shout resounded throughout the area. It was filled with so much rage that even Lubella flinched, and Grotim stumbled back after receiving the anger head-on.\u2018Wow, so fucking scary,\u2019 Zich thought inside his mind. That was how enraged Weig was.\u201cB-Belri Weig!\u201dGrotim had gone on and on about his army being enough to fight Weig or that he could just mix Weig into the ritual, but now he looked pale.\u201cAre you that Bellid\u2019s son of a bitch?\u201d Harsh words came out of Weig\u2019s mouth, \u201cA piece of trash that serves a damn thing like Bellu tries to offer a whole city as a sacrifice? And you even bother Lubella on top of that! You damn old man!\u201dAs if he was angry at the insults aimed at Bellu, Grotim tried his hardest to hold his ground.\u201cEven if you are the \u2018Bellid Slaughterer,\u2019 do you think you can beat me, who has the Key?!\u201d\u2018Wow, before he gained the nickname as Tasnia Plains\u2019 Killing Machine, his nickname was Bellid Slaughterer.\u2019It was impressive how a Holy Knight could keep gaining bloody nicknames like that; it was a talent.Burst! Burst! Burst! Burst!This time, four water columns shot up from the pond. Each of them was three times the size of the previous one. Lubella covered her mouth while witnessing the power they carried as the columns wiggled.\u201cDiiiiiiiie!\u201dLike he was in a fit of passion, Grotim shouted, and the water column headed to where Weig was. As if Grotim was trying to trap Weig, each of the columns circled in different directions. But Weig didn\u2019t escape.\u201cHa!\u201dWeig snorted and raised his sword with Karuwiman\u2019s symbol inscribed on its body, and swung it.Craaaaaash!Soon, the water columns that had plodded their way close to Weig burst. Like how fast they had come at Weig, streams of water fluttered everywhere. It was as if rain was falling from the dry sky.Grotim stared at him with utter shock as Weig asked, \u201cIs that all?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cT-This is\u2026!\u201dEven if he wasn\u2019t a modified human made to use the Key, Grotim possessed the Bellid ritual\u2019s power. Thus, Grotim was at a loss for words when he saw his attacks crumble so easily.\u201cEiiiih!\u201dGrotim flipped his book as if he was going to use another great power.\u201cDo you think I will just watch?\u201dUnlike Lubella who was like a baby chick in a new world, Weig had accumulated an immense amount of experience. He quickly shortened the distance between him and his enemy.\u201cDamn it!\u201dGrotim put up a barrier and summoned the undead. However, the summoned undead were normal skeletons at most. He had gathered them in a hurry, and as expected, these monsters were unable to fend off Weig.\u201cFucking bastard!\u201dStomp!It wasn\u2019t anything extraordinary. It was a simple stomp, but with holy powers infused into it, the single step created a shockwave strong enough to smash the skeletons into pieces. Grotim\u2019s face turned purple. In a blink of an eye, the only thing that came between Weig and him was a magical wall.It was a rigid and solid wall of great quality, but now, Grotim felt like it couldn\u2019t be thinner and weaker than it looked. He felt like it would break into pieces without much protest. And unfortunately for him, his ominous predictions were always correct.Crash!It wasn\u2019t even a sword but a single fist. With that one punch, the magical wall cracked and shattered like glass.\u201cEiiiiih!\u201dGrotim let out a high-pitched shriek. He flipped the pages in his book again and unleashed Bellu\u2019s dark energy.\u201cWithdraw that energy. It puts me in a bad mood.\u201dSlice!With a light swing of his sword, Weig split the book into two.\u201cUgh!\u201dAs he tried to evade Weig\u2019s sword, Grotim fell on his bottom. The book dropped from Grotim\u2019s hands and fell to the ground.Guuahhaaaeiiiiiih!An incomprehensible and horrible shriek rang across the area. It came out of the book. Sliced into two, the book pages flapped by itself; and water, the archenemy of books, poured out from the sliced area like blood.Weig scowled at the energy that he felt from the water.\u201cAs if it couldn\u2019t be any clearer that it\u2019s Bellu\u2019s dirty artifact, it\u2019s disgusting until the end.\u201dWeig swung his sword once again. He sliced the horizontally-split book into four pieces.Urgh!In contrast to the chilling sound from a moment ago, this scream was more desperate. It was like a scream that someone would let out right before death while gasping for air.Pop!The book burst. Without leaving a trace or a mark, the book that had pushed the city of Porti into fear hid its existence from the world.\u201cT-The Key\u2026!\u201d Grotim murmured blankly. His eyes lost aim as if he had come face to face with a reality that he didn\u2019t want to believe.Splash!At the same time, he heard water splashing from the fountain near him. It was the sound that Bellu\u2019s statue made as it slammed into the fountain. With one more water column, the statue made its presence known once more and sunk to the bottom of the fountain with disappearing bubbles. After checking the scene, Weig turned his attention to Grotim again.\u201cThe Key?\u201d\u201cHe said that the book was the Key for the Offering Ritual!\u201d Lubella shouted.\u201cDoes that mean you can\u2019t do the ritual without it?\u201d Weig asked Grotim, but he didn\u2019t receive an answer. Grotim no longer looked like he had the will to fight anymore.\u201cHe is out of it.\u201dBam!Weig kicked Grotim, and Grotim rolled on the floor like a miserable loser.\u2018He won\u2019t be a danger anymore, but I should take precautions.\u2019Weig stepped on Grotim\u2019s chest and raised his holy power while making a cross sign. Grothim gasped for air, and then, a couple of white rings formed and quickly contracted around him.Grip!The white rings restricted and trapped Grotim\u2019s body.\u2018You won\u2019t be able to escape anymore.\u2019With Lubella beside him, he wouldn\u2019t even be able to commit suicide either.\u2018It\u2019s a complete win.\u2019Bellid\u2019s plans were completely ruined, and Weig\u2019s battle was over.\u201cSir Weig!\u201dWeig knew that Lubella was running towards him and turned his body to accept Lubella\u2019s flying body tenderly.\u201cOh, Lady Lubella! Please be gentle. This old man\u2019s weak back won\u2019t be able to handle it.\u201d\u2018Stop exaggerating. We all know you are going to be swinging your sword on your deathbed\u2026\u2019Zich was astounded, but he kept his thoughts to himself. With his arms crossed, he simply stared at Lubella and Weig\u2019s reunion.\u201cAre you hurt anywhere?\u201d\u201cMy opponents were too weak. How can they be so pathetic? They can\u2019t even handle a dying old man like me.\u201dLubella chuckled at Weig\u2019s humorous words.\u201cBut Lady Lubella, are you alright?\u201d\u201cYes! It\u2019s all thanks to Mr. Zich!\u201dWeig\u2019s eyes finally went towards Zich.\u201cAre you\u2026 Mr. Zich?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt seems we owe you many favors. I am indebted to you as Karuwiman\u2019s brethren.\u201d\u201cAll I did was try to do a good deed.\u201d\u201cHohoho! Then I want to tell you that you really did the right thing.\u201dZich didn\u2019t think that there would ever be the day that he heard a person from Karuwiman\u2014\u2018Tasnia\u2019s Killing Machine\u2019 at that\u2014to tell him that he had done the right thing.\u2018I really can\u2019t get used to it.\u201dLubella and Weig gazed at Zich with goodwill and made him feel uncomfortable.\u201cSince it seems like we have solved the immediate concern, can I hear more about the situation in detail?\u201dWeig looked back and forth between Zich and Lubella.\u201cYou didn\u2019t come here knowing everything?\u201d\u201cAll I know is what is written here.\u201dWeig took out a small slip of paper and handed it to Lubella.It contained information about the Curse on Porti, false charges on Lubella, Bellid\u2019s involvement, and so on. Still, because it lacked a detailed explanation, it was difficult to tie all the pieces together. In fact, Weig had warily come to the city in disguise, but when he saw Lubella\u2019s wanted poster, all his doubts disappeared.\u201cThe slip of paper was hidden in a secret spot outside of the city. It stated that the day after I find this paper, there will be a battle against Bellid in the evening. So, since I didn\u2019t know where the battle would take place, I surveyed the whole city at the top of the temple\u2019s tower.\u201dThen, as soon as he heard a commotion, Weig had run towards the noise; and the undead and monsters around the mansion failed to stop him.\u201cWere you the one who wrote this slip of paper?\u201d Lubella asked Zich after checking the paper\u2019s contents.\u201cYes. I decided to have the battle a day after this piece of paper disappeared because I had to make sure of Sir Weig\u2019s arrival before confronting Grotim. And I knew that Sir Weig would be the only one who would be able to find the paper in such a secretive spot.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been better to unite with Sir Weig before going into battle?\u201d Lubella asked, sullen that she didn\u2019t know anything about this plan.\u201cThen what if Grotim runs away? We have to do things like this flawlessly.\u201dGrotim probably wouldn\u2019t have appeared if he saw them with Belri Weig. Lubella looked convinced, so Zich asked Weig, \u201cWhat happened to Hans?\u201d\u201cHans?\u201d\u201cThe one who sent you the news. My servant.\u201d\u201cAh, you were talking about him.\u201dWeig looked troubled.\u201cI apologize, but I don\u2019t really know. When I heard that Lady Lubella was in danger, I came running. If he didn\u2019t try to hold me back with all he had to tell me about the slip of paper, I would\u2019ve missed that too.\u201d\u2018Well, he has done well in what I ordered him to do.\u2019Weig\u2019s eyes must have turned upside down after hearing what happened to Lubella; so, Zich knew that it must have been no ordinary task to pass on more information when Weig was in a state like that.\u2018Hans really is quite useful.\u2019Zich had taken Hans to torment him, but his servant was useful in many ways that he didn\u2019t expect.\u201cThen, I will summarize all the events that had happened after you left, Sir Weig\u2026\u201dLubella opened her mouth to speak when\u2014Rumble!The ground shook.\u201cKyah!\u201d\u201c\u2026What is it?\u201dLubella screamed, and Weig tried to assess the situation. Then, they heard a burst of loud laughter behind them.\u201cIt\u2019s started! It\u2019s started! God\u2019s judgment will befall this damn city!\u201dThe voice came from the fallen Grotim. In contrast to his past dejected self, he laughed maniacally now.Weig approached Grotim right away.Slam!\u201cUgh!\u201dWeig kicked Grotim\u2019s sides, and Grotim rolled across the ground again.\u201cDid you do this?\u201dThe vibrations continued. It was a great shock, and Weig\u2019s voice cracked.\u201cHa! Yes, I did this! This is the result of the ritual that I planned for so long!\u201d\u201cStop kidding yourself. I took care of the Key you had, and even that disgusting statue of Bellu sank. There\u2019s no way that the ritual can continue.\u201d\u201cYou stupid bastards! What do you guys know about rituals!\u201dThey didn\u2019t have much to say about that. Until now, the \u2018Offering Ritual\u2019 had been attempted many times, but they were all stopped in the middle of the process and never succeeded. Thus, even though they had a modest amount of information about the ritual, they couldn\u2019t say that they knew everything about the ritual.\u201cHow could you be so proud about stopping the ritual when you don\u2019t know anything about it!\u201d Grotim said excitedly, \u201cThe ritual will automatically activate if enough life force pervades the basement! And you can\u2019t stop a ritual once it starts! Even if you break the Key or Bellu\u2019s statue, you can\u2019t! The ritual won\u2019t stop until it swallows the entire city!\u201d\u201cBut you seem to value the Key so much.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because I can only exercise control of the ritual with the Key! The ritual is now activated because the Key disappeared. But, to control where and how the ritual is activated, you need the Key! Especially a key with considerable power!\u201dThis was the main reason why Grotim had tried to limit his use of the Key\u2019s power. If he hadn\u2019t let the Mayor control it, he wouldn\u2019t have saved the item\u2019s power as much.\u201cThis also means that even I can\u2019t escape from the ritual since I don\u2019t have the Key anymore!\u201dGrotim gritted his teeth at his decisive death. The ritual had already begun successfully, but now he could no longer return to Bellid and enjoy the fruits of his success. This was why he had lost his senses for a moment.\u201cI might die this way, but Bellu\u2019s great name will soon shake up the whole world! And the Church will remember my name forever! I don\u2019t regret sacrificing my life like this!\u201dGrotim didn\u2019t seem like he was lying. Weig\u2019s face stiffened.\u201cWhat\u2019s the method to stop the ritual?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s none! And even if I know, do you think I will\u2014!\u201dCrack!\u201cAhhh!\u201dWeig relentlessly broke Grotim\u2019s arms.\u201cWhat\u2019s the method to stop it?\u201d\u201cHa! Even the great Belri Weig can\u2019t do anything in this situation\u2014!\u201dCrack!\u201cAhhh!\u201d\u201cThe method?\u201d\u201cHahahaha! There\u2019s no point in torturing me since there\u2019s really no method to stop the ritual!\u201dWeig stopped. Grotim didn\u2019t seem like he would spill the beans. Moreover, he really didn\u2019t seem like he knew.\u2018I should get Lady Lubella out of here first.\u2019That was the first thing that came to Weig\u2019s mind. However, Grotim tried to stop him.\u201cDon\u2019t think about running away! The ritual has already covered the whole city. There\u2019s no way you guys can escape! Even if you try to go out, you will be bounced right back in!\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201dWeig, who had kept his cool, seemed to have become more alert as his words became rough.\u201cW-What should we do, Mr. Zich?\u201dAs the situation turned for the worse, Lubella filled with anxiety. Even the trustworthy Weig didn\u2019t seem to have a clear plan or method.\u201cWhat more can we do\u2014?\u201dZich came forward and smiled widely.\u201c\u2014Than teach this pitiful guy some reality?\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201dZich didn\u2019t answer Lubella and approached Grotim.\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201dGrotim glared at Zich with sparks in his eyes.\u201cYou bastard! Everything would have gone as planned if it wasn\u2019t for you!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s probably true.\u201d\u201cBut even that\u2019s over! I will sacrifice your worthless life to Bellu now! You should have just left the city quietly when you could!\u201d\u201cMan, you are so excited.\u201dIt was time to tell him the truth.\u201cSo, do these vibrations appear when the ritual activates?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cThen what happens next?\u201d\u201cWater will shoot up from all over the city\u2019s grounds! It will scatter Bellu\u2019s great blessing over the city!\u201d\u201cLike the water columns that you shot up at the mansion?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dGrotim answered Zich\u2019s questions easily. He thought that since Zich would die anyway, he should inflame Zich\u2019s fear by telling him more about the incoming situation.\u201cThen, about what time do the water columns shoot up after the vibrations?\u201d\u201cImmediately! The vibrations are caused by the force of moving water filled with Bellu\u2019s energy.\u201d\u201cI see. But then\u2026\u201dZich looked around his surroundings in exaggeration.\u201cI don\u2019t see any water columns?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dEven while rolling on the ground, Grotim raised his head and looked around his surroundings. There wasn\u2019t a single water column that he talked about in sight.\u201cH-How? The water columns have to\u2014!\u201d\u201cNow that I think about it, the vibrations are slowing down.\u201dAt Weig\u2019s words, Grotim looked down at the ground. He felt the vibrations slowly coming to a stop.\u201cT-This\u2026\u201d\u201cShould I tell you the reason?\u201dWith that subtle tone, Zich seemed like he was reaching out his hand with a knife hiding behind his back. Grotim was afraid of the kind smile on Zich\u2019s face.\u201cYou know those magic circles I drew on Bellu\u2019s statues. I told you that they were just a ploy to buy time before Sir Weig came, right? That was all a lie too.\u201dZich told the truth to Grotim whose eyes were wide open.\u201cThat magic circle is real. It\u2019s a magic circle that hinders the ritual.\u201dGrotim\u2019s eyes widened so much that it looked like they would stretch.\u201cHow was it? How was that sweet moment of hope?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cH-How\u2026How could that ridiculous-looking magic circle be real!\u201d\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s a bit different. Didn\u2019t I tell you that the magic circle drops the ritual\u2019s power, extends its time, and returns the life force it takes? But only the part about returning the life force is true. Through the magic circle, Karuna\u2019s holy power goes into the groundwater, and when the ritual gets activated, it scatters the life force mixed in the water. Most of them get released, but if the owner of the life force is still alive, it returns to the owner.\u201dLubella recalled Timmy\u2019s brother; Zich had promised to heal him.\u2018He was telling the truth!\u2019If what Zich said was right, Timmy\u2019s brother would become healthy again.Since he didn\u2019t know the whole story, Weig murmured, \u201c\u2026A ridiculous-looking magic circle? What\u2019s that?\u201dLubella explained it to him.\u201cSomething like that happened?\u201dWeig could now understand why Grotim had gotten so angry at Zich. If Grotim was a normal person, Weig might have felt a bit bad for how much he got played by Zich. But having sympathy for those Bellid bastards was way too grand for what they deserved. Besides, Weig was much more interested in something else.He stared at Zich who was crouching next to Grotim. Weig first met Zich when Zich asked Lubella a silly question about how to live a kind life.\u2018I never thought that we would meet again like this.\u2019For now, it seemed like Zich was protecting Lubella, and Lubella looked at Zich with complete trust.\u2018But what is this magic circle that hindered Bellid\u2019s ritual?\u2019As a Karuwiman, Weig really wanted this magic circle\u2014no, he needed it at all costs.\u2018How does this young man know of it?\u2019Weig wondered about this. Seeing how panicked Grotim looked, it seemed like even the Bellids weren\u2019t aware of the existence of this magic circle. Then how did Zich have this knowledge when even the Bellids and their arch-nemesis, the Karuwimans, didn\u2019t know of it?\u2018Well, it seems like he is not our enemy so that\u2019s a relief.\u2019Even though Weig didn\u2019t know Zich\u2019s identity, he was still grateful to Zich.\u201cHow do you feel now? You guided us with your soldiers so that we could find the statues easily. Were you happy, thinking that your plan tricked us? But that has totally backfired on you~!\u201d\u201cYou bastard! Bastard! Bastaaaaaard!\u201dGrotim squirmed, but Weig\u2019s restraint was too strong. Grotim couldn\u2019t do anything but squirm like a bug.\u201cHehehe! You look like a shrimp flopping on the shore. Ah, since Bellu has a fish head, are you copying him and acting like an aquatic animal? Wow! That\u2019s an amazing display of faith. I applaud that.\u201d\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to?\u201dZich poked at Grotim\u2019s side with a tree branch that he picked up from who-knows-where. The poking didn\u2019t hurt. How much power could a small tree branch have? However, the humiliation that Grotim felt from it was incomparably greater than the pain he would have felt from getting stabbed by a knife.\u201cYou son of a bitch! If only it weren\u2019t for you!\u201d Grotim screamed as if he was vomiting blood, \u201cWhy? Why the hell did you help Lubella!?\u201d\u201cI told you. I wanted to live a kind life.\u201d\u201cWhat made you believe in her! I charged her as a witch! Did you already know her beforehand?!\u201d\u201cOf course not. I only saw her like twice before.\u201d\u201cThen, how could you believe her!\u201dEven Lubella was curious about this. Without any doubt or hesitation, Zich had helped Lubella who was charged as the witch by the whole city. She didn\u2019t know why Zich tried his hardest to help her.\u201cJust cause.\u201d\u201cJust cause?\u201dZich brought his plans to ruins, yet Zich gave him such an unbelievably simple answer. Grotim became speechless.\u201cJust look at her face. It says, \u2018I\u2019m naturally good\u2019 all over it.\u201dBoth Weig and Lubella thought his answer was absurd, and Grotim became even more furious.\u201cYou bastaaaaard!\u201dGrotim spat out curses as he squirmed on the floor again. However, Zich didn\u2019t respond this time.\u2018Ah, playing with him was fun!\u2019If Grotim heard Zich\u2019s thoughts, his mouth would\u2019ve started foaming.\u2018The reason why I believe in Lubella\u2026\u2019Of course, Zich had another reason; he just couldn\u2019t tell it to anyone else. He recalled what he saw before his regression when his head was about to fly off from Glen Zenard\u2019s swing. The party of heroes glared at him with animosity and hate, but among them, only Lubella acted differently.\u2018How many people would cry for a dying bastard like me?\u2019It had been a shocking scene for Zich, so he remembered it vividly.\u2018That\u2019s enough for me to believe in Lubella.\u2019* * *Porti was in chaos. Porti\u2019s economy had gone downhill since the witch hunt against Lubella, and reports about missing people that the Deputy Mayor had repressed with his authority began to surface. In addition, the damages that the undead and monsters made were significant and made the city buzz for a while. Above all, they suffered the greatest loss from the collapse of their ruling establishment with the Mayor\u2019s death and the arrest of the Deputy Mayor and other high-level figures.However, Lubella\u2019s false charges were quickly dropped. Not only was the Deputy Mayor alive, but there were also Bellid statues all over the city that clearly showed the group\u2019s involvement in the case.\u201cAre you done?\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Hans answered while carrying a thick suitcase. Zich also lifted the baggage that he placed on the ground.\u201cThen, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cIs there a need for us to go so soon?\u201dZich and Hans spent an exceptionally relaxing and comfortable time in the Karuwiman temple for the past couple of days. Zich had saved Porti, helped drop Lubella\u2019s false charges, and crumbled Bellid\u2019s plans. For this, the Karuwiman showed him the best hospitality that they could provide.Since they left the Count\u2019s residence, Hans had gone through a great amount of suffering, so he wanted to stay as long as he could in the temple. But Zich was adamant.\u201cWe rested enough. We have to start moving to do more kind acts.\u201d\u201cC-Can\u2019t we do enough of that here, sir?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I realized something from this incident. I guess I can say that I\u2019ve found my calling.\u201d\u201cIs that so! Can I perhaps hear about that too?\u201dThe two turned around to see Lubella and Weig approaching them. Similar to how they first met, Lubella was wearing a white robe, and a pure and clean aura was coming off from her.\u201cYou look like a religious figurehead now. Just a couple of days ago, you looked like a homeless person in the back alleyway.\u201dHans was taken back by Zich\u2019s rude words, but Lubella agreed with him and retorted humorously.\u201cIt was a worthwhile experience since I didn\u2019t just listen to the voices of the weak but was able to experience their struggles firsthand.\u201dWeig stared at Lubella. Because of the scale and harshness of this experience, Lubella had changed significantly.\u2018But it\u2019s not bad.\u2019Lubella\u2019s mind and heart had been enough for her to become the Saint, and even her skills were much greater than the other Saint Candidates. However, it was true that she lacked mental fortitude in areas like confidence; that was why Weig had always hoped that she would act with more firmness and confidence. But now, Lubella\u2019s current behavior was what he had always wanted from her.\u2018We really do owe him a huge favor.\u2019With her now perfect mentality, Lubella would definitely become the Saint. It had been 90% likely that she would become the next Saint, but now, even that other 10% was assured.Zich asked Lubella, \u201cAre you going to continue helping the weak?\u201d\u201cOf course. As a follower of Karuna, it is a duty expected of me. But from now on, I won\u2019t fall into my prejudices and think that the weak are right and that the strong are wrong. I learned this lesson the hard way.\u201d\u201cIf you think like that, it feels worthwhile to have helped you.\u201d\u201cYes. I have learned a lot, thanks to your help. It is also thanks to Grotim who planned all of this although I don\u2019t feel an ounce of gratitude towards him.\u201d\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d\u201cGrotim was dragged off to the kingdom\u2019s capital. He won\u2019t be able to keep his life, but he will probably be tortured in various ways so that we can get information out of him.\u201dWeig answered, \u201cGood for him.\u201dZich prayed that Grotim\u2019s future would only be filled with grief and despair, and he laughed inside.\u201cI have also mastered the magic circle Mr. Zich has taught me. From now on, we will be able to respond to Bellid\u2019s awful rituals more easily.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad that I could be of help.\u201d\u201cAre you really sure that you don\u2019t want to receive a reward for it?\u201d\u201cI have received enough.\u201dZich had already received a lot of money as a reward, but Lubella didn\u2019t seem satisfied with just that.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing compared to what you did. No, even the price of this magic circle should be hundreds of times greater than the amount we gave you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that interested in money.\u201dIf he put his mind to it, Zich could amass a fortune, so he needed just enough money for his immediate travels.\u201cThen, it can\u2019t be helped. Please tell me if you ever need my help. I will help you to the best of my abilities.\u201d\u201cI am grateful for that.\u201dZich lightly expressed his thanks.\u201cBut by the way\u2026do you really not know who invented this magic circle?\u201dThe person who invented this ridiculous magic circle could really help out the Karuwimans against their fight with the Bellids.Zich shook his head.\u201cI also learned about this magic circle by coincidence. I don\u2019t know who the inventor is.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a pity.\u201dLubella let out a soft sigh.\u2018Well, it\u2019s a half-lie.\u2019It was true that Zich learned about the magic circle by coincidence. However, he knew who invented this magic circle, but he couldn\u2019t tell this information to Lubella of all people.\u2018This magic circle\u2014you are the one who invented it.\u2019Zich stared at Lubella as she blatantly expressed her disappointment and pity.Even Zich, who didn\u2019t care about how others looked at him, couldn\u2019t tell Lubella this: \u2018In the future, you made this ridiculous looking magic circle to fight against the Bellid.\u2019\u201cBut no matter how many times I think about it, it\u2019s amazing how those bizarre pictures could have an effect.\u201d\u2018You\u2019re the one who thought of those bizarre pictures though.\u2019\u201cWell, even Lady Lubella had her doubts at first. Of course, when Grotim was trying to make us believe that those pictures were having an effect, she got tricked.\u201dLubella reddened at the memory.\u201cAh, now that you mention it, didn\u2019t I tell you that the magic circles were fake and there was no need for you to feel sorry about having any doubts? I\u2019m taking back my word. You can be sorry for that.\u201d\u201cYou really are a liar.\u201dLubella was stunned by Zich\u2019s shamelessness.\u201cSo, you should be more careful from now on. There are also people like me in this world.\u201d\u201cAt least, I don\u2019t think that there would be many people like you.\u201dZich was a truly unique figure.\u201cFufufu! I guess Lady Lubella has a new friend.\u201dWeig was filled with joy as he saw Lubella, who he cared for like his granddaughter, animatedly converse with another person. Then he asked Zich,\u201cMy offer still stands. Mr. Zich, if you change your mind, Karuwiman will always welcome you.\u201d\u201cAn offer?\u201dLubella was curious about Weig\u2019s words.\u201cI asked him if he wanted to become a Holy Knight of Karuwiman. He has done so much for our cause, and his skills are far greater than those in his age range. Furthermore, he helped Lady Lubella for the sole reason of doing a kind act. If his faith for Karuna is deep, I think he is more than fit to be a Holy Knight.\u201dA Karuwiman Holy Knight! Hans thought it was absurd. Hans couldn\u2019t believe that Weig offered to let Zich, who was close to being a scumbag, become a noble and sacred Holy Knight. However, it seemed as if only Hans thought this, and Lubella brightened up at the news.\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea! How about it Mr. Zich? You can serve Karuna with us.\u201dShe stared at Zich with eyes full of expectations, but Zich evaded her gaze and shook his head.\u201cI thank you for your offer, but I don\u2019t have any thoughts about becoming a Holy Knight.\u201d\u2018Do they think I\u2019m crazy? Crazy enough to be a Holy Knight?\u2019Even if Zich\u2019s relationship with the Karuwiman was much better than before his regression, this was another matter. How could Zich jump into a war in Karuna\u2019s name and wear the white armor that the Karuwimans were known for?\u2018Ugh, just the thought of that makes me cringe.\u2019Walking the path of the Demon Lord a second time was preferable to that.\u201cAh, that\u2019s a pity.\u201dLubella hung her head; she seemed disappointed about the news. Most men\u2019s hearts might have been shaken by Lubella\u2019s disappointed expression and would have reconsidered the offer, but Zich was firm. He had no intentions to become a Karuwiman Holy Knight.\u201cThen, what about becoming an Honorable Holy Knight? It\u2019s a position we give to people who don\u2019t necessarily serve Karuna but have given us a lot of help\u2014\u201d\u201cNo, thank you.\u201dHis answer was immediate again.\u201cThen, it can\u2019t be helped. But if you change your mind, please look for me. Karuwiman will always welcome you.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dZich thought he would never join Karuwiman.\u201cWe went off-topic. Mr. Zich, you said that you found your path, right?\u201d\u201cAh, about that.\u201dZich shrugged his shoulders in pride; it seemed like he was satisfied with the answer he found.\u201cAs Lady Lubella knows, my goal is to live a kind life. However, I didn\u2019t know how to do that or what a kind act was. But I feel like I\u2019ve got the hang of it these days.\u201d\u201cYes, that was the first question you asked me.\u201d\u201cBut through this incident, I realized a way to live a kind life that suits my taste and skills perfectly.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201dZich smiled. His smile looked like that of a wise man who found enlightenment; there was even a bit of holiness mixed in with his smile.\u201cIt\u2019s to go around beating the crap out of bad guys and killing them after.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dLubella blurted out by instinct.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I beat up that annoying bastard\u2014no, that rotten\u2014no, that man with a face you want to spit on\u2014no, I mean\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You are talking about Grotim, right? You don\u2019t have to be polite about it. Just speak freely.\u201dLubella was now completely used to Zich\u2019s rough speech. Seeing her change in attitude, Zich was amazed by her adaptability; but in a part of his mind, he wondered if this was really a good thing.\u201cIt was also my wish to beat the heck out of Grotim. I hate those Bellid guys.\u201d\u201cYes, I feel the same way.\u201dAs a Karuwiman, Lubella could completely understand Zich\u2019s feelings.\u201cAnd even though I just did whatever I wanted, all of you treat me like a hero for beating up Grotim. And that\u2019s when I realized, Ah, crushing bad guys are also acts of kindness.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLubella hesitated to reply. Zich was not wrong. It was right to bring justice to those who brought harm to people. But seeing Zich\u2019s happy face while talking about beating up people made her hesitate to agree with him.\u201cThey are bad guys anyway, so it doesn\u2019t matter if I screw them over or torture them.\u201dThis made Lubella hesitate even further. Lubella let out a sigh, but she did not contradict Zich\u2019s statements.\u201cWell, it sounds like you are on the right track.\u201dLubella wondered if it was right to agree with Zich\u2019s morally ambiguous realizations, but she thought there was some truth to his statements. But most of all, she had huge trust in Zich as a human being. For that reason, even though Weig looked at her with wide eyes and Hans stared at her in utter shock, she continued, \u201cIf another person said that to me, I would have thought they were being too extreme, but I trust your judgments. I\u2019m sure you can make the right judgments since you accurately judged Sude and Timmy for who they were. However, please reconsider a few times before you act on your decisions.\u201d\u201cI will try.\u201dZich felt proud of himself. He felt as if Lubella, a future Saint, recognized and approved of his version to live a kind life.Feeling pleased, Zich spoke up and asked, \u201cDo you have any concerns? I might be able to assist.\u201dZich asked this question without much thought, but Lubella seemed to hesitate as if she really did have a concern.\u201cHmmm, this is kind of embarrassing to say, but\u2026\u201dAfter a few moments, Lubella began to voice her concerns to Zich carefully. Weig knew what Lubella\u2019s main concern was, so he quietly listened to her talk.\u201cI mean, I\u2019m completely fine now. I\u2019m quite strong.\u201dLubella lifted her arms and showed off her muscles. Obviously, she didn\u2019t have many muscles in her arms, but her lighthearted actions indicated that she was getting stronger mentally. She merely brought up the topic to hear if Zich had anything helpful to share.\u201cHmmm, I have a good idea. Would you like to hear it?\u201d\u201cYes? A good idea?\u201d\u201cPlease lend me your ears for a bit.\u201dLubella leaned towards Zich. Like evil villains making secret plans, Zich quietly whispered to Lubella and gave her his advice.\u201c\u2026Is it really okay for me to do that?\u201d Lubella asked him with clear surprise in her voice; his suggestion was extremely shocking to her.\u201cI\u2019m just giving you advice. The choice is all up to you, Lady Lubella.\u201dLubella glanced at Weig. Even though Zich and Lubella were whispering to each other, Weig heard their whole conversation and didn\u2019t say anything. His mouth turned slightly upwards instead. Even though it was a bit extreme, Weig seemed to approve of Zich\u2019s advice.\u2018Well, Sir Weig always pushed me to become stronger.\u2019\u201cI will think about it.\u201d\u201cThen that will be enough.\u201dZich fixed the position of his luggage.\u201cThen we will be heading out.\u201d\u201cAh, we will see you out.\u201dThe four of them headed towards the temple\u2019s entrance.\u201cWhere will you be going next?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thinking about heading to the nearest village first. Then I will slowly think about my plans after.\u201d\u201cWe will also be heading back to the General Assembly. There are a lot of things we have to report, and there\u2019s going to be an event soon where all the Saint Candidates have to gather together.\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s not much time for you to carry out my advice.\u201d\u201cYes, if I do decide to accept your advice.\u201dWhile they were talking, they soon arrived at the temple\u2019s entrance.\u201cAh!\u201dA person who was sitting in front of the entrance jumped up after seeing them.Weig tensed up, thinking that an enemy might be approaching them, but Zich stopped him before he could do anything.\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I know them.\u201dWeig took one step back.Then Lubella noticed who the person was and exclaimed, \u201cGosh! It\u2019s Mr. Timmy!\u201dTimmy was the man whose younger brother got his life force taken away from him. As soon as Timmy saw Lubella and Zich, he bowed his head towards them.\u201cGreetings, Lady Lubella and Sir Zich!\u201d\u201cHello, Mr. Timmy. If I may ask, what\u2019s your reason for coming here?\u201d Lubella\u2019s voice was full of concern; she wondered if there was another thing she wronged Timmy for. Fortunately, Timmy\u2019s face was very bright. It seemed as if he hadn\u2019t come to relay unfortunate news or to chastise Lubella again.\u201cI wanted to come here to give my thanks to the two of you.\u201d\u201cTo give your thanks?\u201dTimmy gestured at the person next to him and said, \u201cHey, come here.\u201dLubella hadn\u2019t noticed that there was another person next to Timmy. The small figure next to Timmy began to clutch the edges of Timmy\u2019s clothes even more tightly.Zich spoke up first. \u201cWe saw him before\u2014he\u2019s your brother.\u201d\u201cAh! He\u2019s all healed.\u201d\u201cYes! After that enormous fight near the Mayor\u2019s mansion, he completely healed after a few days!\u201dThe magic circle that reversed Bellu\u2019s ritual had successfully healed Timmy.\u201cThat\u2019s awesome news!\u201dLubella was happy as if it was her own problem. The heavy guilt in her heart was relieved a tiny bit.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for how I acted to you before. I placed all my frustrations and anger on you.\u201d\u201cNo, it was my fault that I judged you as a bad person when I barely knew you.\u201dZich added in his comments, \u201cYeah, that was your fault.\u201dLubella made a strained sound at Zich\u2019s statement, and Timmy made a bitter smile.\u201cHey George, give your greetings. They are the people who healed you.\u201d\u201cT-Thank you.\u201dGeorge fidgeted a bit and bowed his head.\u201cDid you wait for us to thank us?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDid you wait for us the whole time until we came out?\u201d\u201cI wanted to do that, but since my brother just recovered, I didn\u2019t think that was a good idea. I also have work to do, so I came up here every day since my brother recovered. I couldn\u2019t stay for long though.\u201dTimmy spoke as if he was sorry for not waiting for a long time, but Lubella, Zich, and Weig were impressed by Timmy\u2019s persistence.Timmy smiled and said, \u201cBut it was all worth it because I was able to meet the two of you right now.\u201d\u201cAh, I have to go now. It\u2019s time for me to start heading to work,\u201d Timmy quickly said this and gave another bow. \u201cI want to thank you again for saving my little brother. I will pray that Karuna\u2019s blessing will be upon the two of you forever.\u201dTimmy quickly left the temple. George bowed his head again to Zich and Lubella and followed his brother out.\u201cHe is really a good person.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dZich agreed with Lubella and began to remember what Timmy said to him in the past.\u2018Did he say that I was the first person to help him when everyone treated him like an outcast?\u2019Zich was also treated like an outcast, and he never received help from anyone.\u2018If anyone had helped me out before I got strong, would I have become the Demon Lord?\u2019Even though Zich had no regrets about the path he chose before he regressed, he could not help but think these thoughts.* * *Zich and Hans left the temple. Lubella and Weig watched them leave until they completely disappeared.Then Weig openly said, \u201cHe\u2019s a really unique person.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cI wonder who he really is.\u201dLubella stared at Weig. \u201cIs there anything suspicious about him?\u201d\u201cThere are many suspicious things about him\u2014he is much too skilled for his age, and he knows a magic circle that no one has ever seen or heard. Moreover, he even knows Karuwiman\u2019s emergency signal.\u201d\u201cOur emergency signal?\u201d\u201cYes. I was expelling monsters in the forest when I heard someone send Karuwiman\u2019s emergency signal. When I headed towards the location where I heard the signal, I saw Mr. Zich\u2019s servant, Mr. Hans. He told me about your situation. Later, when I asked him how he knew about our emergency signal, he told me that he heard it from Mr. Zich.\u201d\u201c\u2026He really knows a variety of information.\u201dWeig crossed his arms.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem like a bad person, but I personally don\u2019t think he is trustworthy. I am also curious about where he got his information from.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if he was serious or not, but Mr. Zich told me he was of noble origin.\u201d\u201c\u2026A noble?\u201dWeig tilted his head. He hadn\u2019t been with Zich for a long time, but Zich didn\u2019t carry himself like a noble at all; instead, he seemed more like a street gangster. If Zich was of noble origin, he should have at least some of the mannerisms that fit an aristocrat, but\u2026\u201cHe told me to search for Zich Steelwall from the Steelwall family.\u201d\u201cZich Steelwall\u2026? Wait, you mean the Steelwall family? Is it the Steelwall family I know? The one called the Kingdom\u2019s metal fortress?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThere was a high possibility that Zich was telling the truth since he revealed such a specific piece of information, and it was easy to find out if he was telling the truth or not.\u201cWell, it would be fun to find out if he told the truth or not.\u201d\u201cIf you find anything, be sure to tell me.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s start heading back. I want to give a proper farewell to the knights who passed away while protecting me.\u201dLubella felt melancholy whenever she thought about the Holy Knights who died while protecting her. As Grotim said, he might have really grounded the Holy Knights and fed them as fish food or turned them into zombies. Either way, none of their bodies could be found.\u201cI\u2019m sure they are with Karuna and looking out for you right now\u2014they were that kind of people.\u201d\u201cI hope so.\u201dAs if to search for their faces, Lubella peered up at the sky.\u201cWe also have to report on what happened. The magic circle we received from Mr. Zich and other information about the ritual such as using \u2018the whole city as a sacrifice\u2019 will also be very helpful.\u201dThrough this event, Lubella and Weig had found out Bellid\u2019s plan and their strategies, along with a way to counteract their plans and rituals. Moreover, if they studied the magic circle further, they could find a more effective way to block Bellid\u2019s powers.\u201cBut I think we should hide some information about Mr. Zich.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you saying that we should lessen his merits?\u201dLubella looked horrified at Weig\u2019s words. She looked like a child who just found out her parents were horrible criminals.Seeing her face, Weig quickly made an excuse, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to lessen his merits, but I think we should hide the fact that he taught us a magic circle that could nullify Bellid\u2019s rituals. If that truth spreads, Mr. Zich might be in great danger. Bellid will try to catch him with all their might.\u201dBellid would make Zich their number one target so that they could find out where Zich learned his tricks and gather as much information on the magic circle as they could. Hearing this, Lubella felt a shiver run down her back.\u201cHe\u2019ll be in grave danger if that gets out.\u201d\u201cFor now, I think it would be a good idea to let only the Pope and a few high priests know. Let\u2019s decide later whether or not we should make an official statement that we found this magic circle accidentally or tell the truth and give credit to Mr. Zich. Either way, we should decide after discussing this more with Mr. Zich.\u201d\u201cYes, that sounds reasonable. Then let\u2019s go back to the General Assembly and quickly give them the information we found.\u201dThen Weig suddenly said out of the blue, \u201cWill you be all right?\u201dThere was a solid reason why Weig posed this question. It was also probably the reason why Zich gave such a piece of advice to Lubella before he left. Lubella smiled; her smile was faint, but there was clear confidence and assurance in her expression.\u201cI\u2019m all right. I even got some great advice from Mr. Zich.\u201d\u201cIt will be a sight to see. Then, let\u2019s finish getting ready to go back.\u201dLubella and Weig looked back at the place where Zich and Hans left one more time and went back inside the temple.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a business city that placed the greatest importance on logistics, so its roads were well-polished and clean. Although the roads weren\u2019t made from stones or gravel, the tidied dirt road was wide and stretched far across the city.Of course, no matter how wealthy the city was, it couldn\u2019t have set all the roads. As they walked farther away from the city, the road gradually grew rougher. The ground became bumpy, and little pieces of stone and sand stubbed their feet more frequently. Soon, resilient weeds and bushes began to invade their path.\u201cHuff! Huff!\u201dA person was breathing extremely roughly; the breathing was too intense for walking on a road, even if the roads were getting rougher. It almost seemed as if the person was exaggerating his breaths to demonstrate his struggle.This person was Hans. If a person in front of him kept breathing and making sounds as Hans did, Zich thought no one would blame him for throwing a rock at the person\u2019s head and cracking it.Hans dragged his shaking legs and shouted, \u201cS-Sir Zich!\u201d He was exhausted enough to bite his tongue by mistake.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think we\u2019ve made enough progress, sir?\u201dThe look on Hans\u2019 face could\u2019ve stirred up sympathy in anyone\u2019s heart, but to Zich, it was useless.\u201cYou can endure it a bit more. Stop being a crybaby.\u201d\u201cI-I think I will really die!\u201dHans\u2019 joints cracked, his muscles seemed to scream at him to stop, and his clothes were drenched in sweat. Zich stopped his steps and walked in front of Hans. His movements were light as a feather.In comparison, Hans looked ridiculous. Thick metal chains were tied to his arms and legs, and heavyweights dangled from every part of his body. Hans was bound to feel tired even on a sleek, smooth road with all the extra weight he carried.\u201cHmm.\u201dZich stroked his chin and looked at Hans, who looked as if he was about to die. Hans hoped that Zich might take some of these iron chains off of him and exaggerated his expression.Grab!Zich grabbed Hans\u2019 arms and squeezed them a couple of times.\u201cYour muscles can still afford to do more. It\u2019s fine. Just endure for a bit longer.\u201dWith those words, Zich walked back to the front again; and as if the world was ending in front of him, Hans squirmed in despair. Hans was only relieved of his suffering when Zich stopped to set up camp.\u201cI-I am going to die!\u201dHans slumped down to the dirt ground. He didn\u2019t need a blanket or a cushion. Even if the ground below him was hard and uncomfortable, he wanted to lie down forever. Happiness surged his heart, and Hans felt like no splendor or spectacle could give him the happiness he felt at the moment.However, this happiness didn\u2019t last long.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dDemon Lords from storybooks would have sounded like this voice, and in surprise, Hans rose like he was giving an offering to the Demon Lord.\u201cWe have to make camping preparations.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026my muscles are aching quite a bit\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? That much is fine. Quickly get up and help.\u201dHans begrudgingly stood up again.\u201cYou can let down your weights while preparing for camp.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, sir.\u201dZich told Hans this as if he was granting him a great favor, and Hans sniffled. Soon, the camping preparations were complete. They chose a spot on the ground, made a fire, and gathered leaves to place under the blankets. It was a very simple camp, but it was enough to spend a night in. But unfortunately for Hans, his suffering wasn\u2019t over.\u201cYour arms are dropping.\u201dAt Zich\u2019s words, Hans squeezed out all the energy he had to raise his arms again.\u201cI-I really can\u2019t do it anymore, sir!\u201d\u201cYou can. You kept saying that you couldn\u2019t do it, but you endured it so far. Or have you been lying to me?\u201d\u201cNo, sir!\u201d\u201cThen, endure it. Believe in yourself.\u201dHans whimpered. He kept his stance with his sword raised. The sword he raised wasn\u2019t the short sword he used to have, but a long sword. It was what Zich had gotten him on their way out of Porti.At first, Hans had been glad to receive the long sword since it looked much cooler than the short sword. However, that happy mood was short-lived. He wanted to punch himself for smiling so widely when he first received the gift and heard that Zich would teach him swordsmanship.\u201cYour skills will only improve if you endure pain. And you will be able to use those skills in any situation. Weren\u2019t you able to do it last time thanks to what I taught you?\u201dAfter leaving the Count\u2019s residence, Zich had trained Hans in the fundamentals of swordsmanship. He had taught Hans how to use a little bit of mana to move quickly so that they could shorten the time it took them to travel, and Hans could escape in emergencies. Zich also trained Hans in endurance and strength to order him to do more things.Zich had taught Hans for his own comfort and half out of a joke, so he was surprised to discover Hans\u2019 potential.\u2018He has talent.\u2019Zich stared at Hans who kept grunting, \u2018Shh! Shh!\u2019 like a diseased bird with his sword raised.\u2018An immense amount of talent.\u2019In terms of talent, Hans was above Greig who had been evaluated as an excellent successor. And he was maybe\u2014really maybe\u2026\u2018Similar to Glen Zenard.\u2019It was too early to speculate. Before his regression, Zich had been the strongest entity in the world. As someone who led a party of heroes that defeated Zich in his prime, Zenard\u2019s talent and abilities were legendary. On top of that, Hans hadn\u2019t been with Zich for long yet.\u2018Is it too early to compare him to Glen Zenard?\u2019Regardless, it was evident that Hans possessed extraordinary talent.\u2018That\u2019s why he was able to get to Belri Weig on time.\u2019Weig had been so far away that even Lubella gave up on getting to him on time, but Hans had reached Weig with just his two legs alone.\u2018It wasn\u2019t a situation where he could\u2019ve ridden on a horse or anything like that.\u2019So, Hans had pushed his body to its limits and used the tiny amount of mana he had recently learned to control to reach his destination. He drank the magic potion that Zich gave him like water and endured as the taste of blood rose in his throat to reach Weig.\u2018Since he helped me completely screw Grotim over, I should really compliment him.\u2019If Weig hadn\u2019t arrived on time, Zich would have never invaded the Mayor\u2019s mansion. Then, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to delay the ritual any longer, and Grotim would have begun his ritual. Of course, with the magic circles on Bellu\u2019s statues, the ritual wouldn\u2019t have succeeded, but Grotim would have realized this and ran away.\u201cYour arm is dropping!\u201dHans raised his arms again.\u2018Be happy, you twerp. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to get trained by the strongest person in the future.\u2019Not knowing his luck, Hans looked like he was about to cry at any moment.Zich thought, \u2018Of course, that\u2019s not the only reason.\u2019It was good if this training benefited Hans, but it was better if it benefited him.\u2018If I teach him a bit more, I can not only use him as my servant but as an asset to fight my enemies.\u2019And that could only be achieved after Zich\u2019s perfect, admirable, and 'slightly difficult\u201d training.\u2018I should stay in the same spot and make him go through training for a while. Mastering the fundamentals is important, and I also have to do some physical training.\u2019Zich twirled his mana slightly.Crash!A vast amount of mana blazed, enough to make his skin shudder a bit. It was an amount that Zich couldn\u2019t have controlled a while ago.After the ritual failed, Bellu\u2019s statue fell into the fountain that was in the Mayor\u2019s mansion. Of course, the Karuwimans wanted to destroy the statue, but Zich stopped them. He asked for the stone statue\u2014specifically, the core inside the statue. The core was filled with Bellu\u2019s energy, so Weig had looked at him suspiciously and wanted to know what Zich wanted it for.At Weig\u2019s wary attitude, Zich merely thought, \u2018Guess it can\u2019t be helped if he doesn\u2019t give it to me,\u2019 and was surprised the next moment when Weig handed him the core without saying much. Weig and the Karuwimans seemed to have great faith in Zich.As expected, the core contained a massive amount of Bellu\u2019s energy, and Zich used a skill he learned before he regressed: \u2018Energy Drain.\u2019As its name suggested, it was a skill that allowed users to absorb another person or item\u2019s energy. Some might think that a person with a small amount of mana would be able to easily increase their mana pool with this skill, but the skill wasn\u2019t as dreamy as it sounded. The world wasn\u2019t that easy.First of all, the amount of mana that a person could endure depended on their innate capacity. If a person tried to hold onto a greater amount of mana than they could endure, they were bound to face complications. Moreover, even if they solved the physical problem of holding onto the mana, there would be problems with controlling it.If a person mixed different kinds of mana, the mana inside would become unstable and dull; and if they combined mana with a completely different character from their innate mana such as holy power, the chances of having side-effects increased exponentially. In the first place, foreign energy was unlikely to match a person\u2019s body well.However, Zich had no intention of making Bellu\u2019s energy his. He already possessed an outstanding amount of mana so there was no need for him to go out of his way to get more. He intended to use the absorbed energy to wake up his dormant, frozen magic. It was a very dangerous experiment.Yet, as expected of Zich, he succeeded; and in the present, his mana had increased to an unbelievable level.\u2018If I could have used this much mana at Porti, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have had to call Belri Weig.\u2019That would have surely been the case if he was able to use all of his mana. Of course, Zich had perfect control over his mana, but the problem was his physical body.\u2018My body can\u2019t handle the sudden increase of mana right now.\u2019He needed to give his body more time to get used to the mana and to speed up the process, he needed to train his body.\u2018This is good. I still have some time before that incident happens, so I should train until then.\u2019Zich hadn\u2019t been able to recall Porti\u2019s incident, because the incident was as common as a rolling pebble in the later years before his regression. During that period, there had been many incidents, and Zich remembered some of the vital ones.\u2018There are going to be swarms of bad guys soon.\u2019Soon, there would be an Era of Demon Lords and Demon People, so there wouldn\u2019t be a scarce supply of bad guys.\u2018If I take care of those guys, I won\u2019t even have to trouble myself about doing kind acts.\u2019And from what Zich remembered, a horrifying incident would soon break out in another city, near the area where Zich was currently in.\u2018Should I make that place my next target?\u2019And like this, Zich\u2019s next destination was decided.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAround the time when Porti\u2019s incident drew to a close, Lubella and Weig returned to Karuwiman\u2019s headquarters. Acting as the headquarters for a long time, the Great Temple, Yuras, seemed to be always surrounded by Karuna\u2019s blessings.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while!\u201dThe temple was also Lubella\u2019s home. After experiencing so many troubles, Lubella entered the place like a prodigal child who rejoiced at the sight of her home. Weig left Lubella to enjoy her return and dwell in her emotions. She deserved it after having gone through so much.They both walked up a white staircase and went inside the temple. Priests and Holy Knights nodded as they passed, and the two returned their greetings. They wanted to report to the Pope immediately, but when they heard that the Pope was currently in a meeting with a couple of high priests, they turned around and went back out.\u201cHow long will it take?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it will take long. Since it\u2019s a periodic meeting, it will end at the usual time.\u201d\u201cThen, can I go to the courtyard for a bit?\u201d\u201cIs there a reason not to? I will escort you, Lady.\u201dLubella giggled at the sight of Weig reaching out his hand clownishly. Then, she mimicked an aristocratic lady and took his hand.They headed to an isolated garden in the temple. It wasn\u2019t large, and there weren\u2019t many people. There were colorful flowers planted on the ground, but they didn\u2019t look fancy and felt simple instead. The only noticeable trait in the area was a small fountain in the middle of the garden.Yet, Lubella liked this garden. Since she was young, whenever she was sad, she soothed her heart at this place. It was a place full of memories.\u201cOh my, who is this?\u201dHowever, there was a person who dirtied this place full of memories. Lubella sighed, and Weig squinted his eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Lubella.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. It\u2019s been a while, Windne.\u201dLubella greeted her, but surprisingly, there was a trace of displeasure in her voice. This was shocking considering Lubella\u2019s character.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Lady Lubella and Sir Weig.\u201dThe middle-aged man behind Windne greeted them. He wore a white uniform and a sword at his hip, so anyone could tell that he was a Holy Knight.\u201cYes, it\u2019s been a while, Sir Dyner.\u201dWinstin Dyner was a Holy Knight who guarded a Saint Candidate like Weig.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Sir Weig.\u201dChelsea Windne. She was another candidate who rivaled Lubella for the Saint position. However, Weig didn\u2019t think that she was a viable competitor at all.\u2018Both her heart and skills are vulgar.\u2019Even with violent titles like \u2018Assassin\u2019 or \u2018Killing Machine\u2019 attached to him, Weig was a devout Karuwiman believer. He was only stern and cruel to evildoers, and his character was ultimately good. Thus, it was rare for him to describe anyone close to an insult. However, he had no intention to amend his judgment.\u2018The criteria to be Karuwiman\u2019s Saint Candidate has reached a new low.\u2019Weig thought Windne didn\u2019t qualify to even be a Saint Candidate.\u201cHey, I heard that you went through a lot this time.\u201dAs expected, Windne acted concerned, but both Lubella and Weig knew that she couldn\u2019t have been happier to hear that Lubella had suffered.\u201cIt must have been really hard. I heard that you went around like a homeless person?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s amazing. If it were me, I would have killed myself rather than go through something traumatic like that. That\u2019s some perseverance.\u201d\u201cYou think so?\u201d\u201cYes. And more than that, I heard that you were mixed up in a Bellid scheme? I am fine with that, but I just worry about what other people might think. They might wonder how a Saint Candidate could fall for the Bellids\u2019 schemes.\u201d\u201cThank you for your concern.\u201dLubella continued to respond blandly. As if that irked her more, Windne\u2019s eyebrows rose higher.\u201cBut did you really fail to sense it? Even if those Bellids hid it really well, if you are a Karuwiman member, shouldn\u2019t you be able to realize the gist of it at least?\u201dThen, Windne suddenly made a surprised face.\u201cOh my! I am sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to say that this incident was your fault. I am just concerned. You understand me, right?\u201dThen, Windne smiled while looking at Weig.\u201cI also want to apologize to Sir Weig. If someone with bad intentions heard me, they would have thought that I was insulting you both.\u201d\u2018But that\u2019s your aim.\u2019Weig looked at Windne drearily.Windne was like a crumpled mass of ego with an inferiority complex, so she antagonized Lubella who was the closest to being a Saint. Whenever she met Lubella, she tore Lubella down while pretending to be concerned.\u2018Such nerve!\u2019Since she was a Saint Candidate, Weig couldn\u2019t slice her in half like he did to the Bellid guys. There weren\u2019t many who treated the greatest Holy Knight like this.\u2018Well, I am also an object of resentment too.\u2019Many thought Lubella was closest to being a Saint not only because of her skills and character, but because Weig had willingly volunteered to be her bodyguard.\u2018So, she must have chosen him to be her Holy Knight.\u2019Weig\u2019s assessment of Winstin Dyner was simple: Windne\u2019s Holy Knight version.\u2018And I\u2019m his object of jealousy.\u2019It was ridiculous to see someone much younger and lacking in experience than Weig act so jealous. In a way, Dyner was worse than Windne.\u2018They really match each other well.\u2019Usually, Lubella wouldn\u2019t have been able to retort a word. It was Lubella\u2019s delicate nature that frustrated Weig. Widne was also the concern that Lubella had confessed to Zich as the main source of her stress. Thus, Weig would have usually intervened and told them to stop. Then, Dyner would intervene, and a small commotion would erupt. But this time, Weig crossed his arms and stood by.\u201cYes, surely. How could I think that you said that to insult me?\u201dWindne blinked her eyes in surprise, seeing Lubella respond when she had always listened to her silently before. However, Lubella wasn\u2019t finished.\u201cIf you had the intention to insult me, anyone watching would think this.\u201d Lubella continued calmly, \u201cThey will say that you are just jealous of me who is closest to becoming the Saint.\u201dWindne\u2019s face grew stiff. Dyner had been wary about Weig\u2019s untroubled behavior, and he looked at Lubella in surprise.\u201cBut you aren\u2019t so vulgar to feel satisfaction by tearing others down like that, right? Like someone suffering from an inferiority complex. I heard that there are people like that even in Karuwiman. Those people take down others while acting like they aren\u2019t doing anything wrong. I\u2019m so sorry to hear that there are people in Karuwiman who do things that I would only expect a Bellid to do.\u201dWindne\u2019s face was red; as Lubella continued, more blood rose to Windne\u2019s face. It seemed like her face would blow up at any moment, but Lubella didn\u2019t stop.\u201cBut you aren\u2019t like that, right Windne? You aren\u2019t someone who\u2019d insult other people while acting otherwise. I am so grateful to have a friend like you.\u201d\u2018This is beyond my expectations.\u2019This was completely different from how she usually acted. Because of everything that Lubella had gone through recently, Weig thought she would respond to the situation well, but he didn\u2019t know that she could talk like this.The effect was outstanding. The sound of Windne\u2019s heavy breathing rang across their surroundings, and Windne seemed like she didn\u2019t know what to do with herself in rage.Windne glared at Lubella. Before, Lubella would have been afraid, but to her surprise, she didn\u2019t feel anything. Compared to Sude\u2019s poisonous glares and Grotim\u2019s murderous curses, this was nothing.\u201c\u2026Yeah. Thank you for thinking that.\u201dWindne finally opened her mouth. Her dry tone hinted at her true feelings. Windne\u2019s punching bag had always hung her head at Windne\u2019s words, and she just resisted. Windne\u2019s head was filled with rage, and she wanted to do anything to mess up Lubella\u2019s face.\u201cBy the way, I feel like you changed a bit. Did you gain something from this trip? Can you teach me?\u201d Windne smiled slyly and meanly. \u201cI think you learned it while watching your Holy Knights die. In their sacrifice, you must have learned something truly valuable, right?\u201dWindne pretended to be impressed.Weig gripped his fist. Windne had even brought up the dead Holy Knights to insult Lubella. This was going overboard, and even Dyner looked a bit surprised.Weig couldn\u2019t remain silent. He opened his mouth to say something when\u2014Slap!It was a clean sound that seemed to clear up Weig\u2019s heart.\u201c\u2026You!\u201dWindne raged while grasping onto her reddened cheeks. However, Lubella wasn\u2019t afraid and coldly glared at Winde.\u201cWhat did you\u2014!\u201dDyner wanted to get angry at Lubella, but an arm blocked his path.\u201cStay still.\u201dIt was Weig.\u201cStay still? How could you say that, seeing\u2014!\u201d\u201c\u2014An argument between the Saint Candidates should be resolved between them. Isn\u2019t that what you used to always tell me?\u201dDyner gritted his teeth as he glared at Weig, but Weig didn\u2019t care whatever Dyner did. Truthfully, Dyner was no less than an ant on a road to Weig. And while these two confronted each other, the two Saint Candidates moved.Swish!Windne\u2019s hand flew, but Lubella grabbed it.\u201cEiih! Let go!\u201dWindne tried to free her hands, but it wasn\u2019t easy. Unlike Lubella who persistently trained her physique, Windne didn\u2019t do any training.\u201cApologize.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cApologize to those who died.\u201dHer stern and cold voice showed how furious Lubella was.\u201cStop joking! Why would I do such a\u2014!\u201dSlap!A refreshing sound rang out again.\u201cYou\u2026!\u201dIt was the other cheek this time. Windne didn\u2019t expect another slap at all.\u201cThey are not someone the likes of you can insult. I give up. I am the fool who expects an apology from you.\u201dLubella said an insult. In addition to her violent action, this made people surprised for the second time.\u201cSir Weig. Let\u2019s go. There\u2019s no need for us to waste our time with them.\u201dLubella roughly dropped her grip on Windne\u2019s hand and turned her back. While clutching her sore cheeks, Windne shouted out to Lubella\u2019s back.\u201cY-You! Do you think I won\u2019t do anything?\u201d\u201cThen, what are you going to do?\u201d Lubella snorted, \u201cHow? Are you going to tell everyone what happened here? Adding the fact that you insulted the dead?\u201dWindne closed her mouth. Lubella didn\u2019t respond like her usual self, so Windne had blabbered whatever she could; even she knew that she crossed the line with that comment. And she was aware of how other people would respond if they heard about this fight.\u201cOr are you going to gossip behind my back? Don\u2019t you know my image? Between you and me, who do you think people will believe?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, I won\u2019t stop you if you want to. I can just pull out everything that happened in the past. Since I am timid, I remember everything you said to me.\u201dWindne no longer said anything. If they really battled for the truth like Lubella said, she knew that she had no chance of winning. She was behind Lubella in faith, status, skills, and everything else.\u201cI don\u2019t think you have anything left to say.\u201dLubella turned around fast enough to make a \u2018swish!\u2019 sound and disappeared. Weig followed behind her with his shoulders stretched out pridefully. The only ones left in the garden were pitiful souls who trembled in humiliation and outrage like abandoned losers in the rain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWith firm steps, Lubella walked through the Grand Temple\u2019s halls. Her shoulders were squared, and there was no hesitation in her footsteps. It was hard to find any trace of her past timid self in her movements. Weig followed behind Lubella silently. It was only after Lubella put sufficient distance between herself and Windne that she let out a sigh of relief.\u201cWhew~!\u201dLubella let her shoulders down and loosened her body. Then, she turned around with a spin.\u201cHow was I? I tried to act according to Mr. Zich\u2019s advice.\u201d\u201cIt was perfect.\u201dIt was so perfect that Weig became worried that Zich might have influenced her too much.\u201cThose two won\u2019t be able to bother you anymore.\u201dThey weren\u2019t on the same footing as Lubella in the first place; even though they were both Saint Candidates, not all Saint Candidates were equal.With firm determination, Lubella said, \u201cThat would be great. But it won\u2019t matter to me either way. I plan to fight back now, especially if they continue to insult me like they did today.\u201d\u201cBut I still can\u2019t believe you actually slapped her. That was Mr. Zich\u2019s advice, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen Lubella confided in Zich about Windne\u2019s attitude towards her, he told her to try slapping Windne. Zich told her that while it was important to always consider the situation, person, and condition in a conflict, she should slap people who treated her unfairly.Seeing the uncertainty on her face in response to his advice, Zich told her that it would also be a good idea for her to reconsider multiple times before resorting to violence; but if there was no other way to settle the conflict after pondering for a long time, Lubella should take this as a sign to use violence and slap her opponents. Lubella clicked her tongue at Zich for repeating her advice back to her in his own creative way. However, since it was from Zich, Lubella engraved his words into her heart.\u201cIf I must say, wasn\u2019t this your first time using violence? How are you feeling?\u201dLubella looked down at the hand that had slapped Windne.\u201cI feel a lot of different emotions. I feel guilty about hurting someone, I regret how I was not able to find a different solution, and I fear that I might become a person who easily resorts to violence.\u201dIt was natural that Lubella felt this way. All her life, violence was kept far away from her, and she felt guilty for inflicting the slightest amount of violence.However, despite all these complicated emotions inside her, Lubella said, \u201cBut it definitely was gratifying.\u201dWeig burst out in laughter.\u201cI think you are ready to go to battle as Karuwiman\u2019s Saint.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a Saint yet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time. But please be careful. In order to protect people and justice, we are forced to use our powers, but we cannot be swallowed by the power. If that happens, you will not only lose your qualifications as Karuwiman\u2019s Saint, but as a human being.\u201d\u201cI will keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s about time for the Pope\u2019s meeting to end, so let\u2019s go report to him.\u201dThe two of them headed to meet the Pope.* * *After making a lengthy report to the Pope, Lubella separated from Weig. Lubella\u2019s footsteps were light as she finally headed towards her room after a long and arduous journey.\u201cHello, good afternoon.\u201dA handsome, tall man with a well-balanced body stood in front of her. He was not a Karuwiman\u2014the broach on his chest indicated that he was an Honorary Holy Knight.\u201cI see that you are an Honorary Holy Knight. As a Karuwiman, I express my thanks to you.\u201dIt was the broach Lubella had offered to Zich before.\u201cNo, it is my honor to be able to serve Karuwiman as an outsider.\u201dThe man smiled and revealed his identity, \u201cI am Glen Zenard. Through Priest Luce\u2019s recommendation, I was fortunate enough to gain the title of Honorary Holy Knight.\u201d\u201cOh, Priest Luce recommended you.\u201dUruwon Luce. He was not a High Priest yet, but he was famous for his merit and faith; there were even talks that he would become the next High Priest. As someone who was recommended by Luce, Lubella thought that he must be a trustworthy person.\u201cIf you do not mind me asking, are you Lady Aine Lubella, one of the few chosen to be a Saint Candidate?\u201d\u201cYes. Even though I am lacking in many ways, I am fortunate to have been chosen as a Saint Candidate.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dLubella was not sure, but Zenard seemed a bit conflicted while looking at her. However, when she tried to peer closer, there was no such emotion on his face.\u2018I must have been mistaken.\u2019There was no reason for Lubella to continue her conversation with Zenard. She was about to say her farewells to Zenard and go back to her room when he stopped her by saying, \u201cDidn\u2019t you have to go through a painful experience this time?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you seem very troubled.\u201d\u2018What? I do?\u2019Lubella touched her face. She was not good at controlling her expressions, and there wasn\u2019t anything she was particularly worried about.\u2018Am I still anxious about what happened to the Holy Knights who tried to protect me?\u2019But that situation had already been dealt with. She was going to lead the memorial service for them and pray for their passing. Moreover, she was going to honor their sacrifice by remembering them in her heart forever. That was the resolution Lubella came up with.\u201cIf possible, would you be able to tell me about your concerns? I might be able to be of some help.\u201dHis face was pure and completely devoid of all self-interest, but she shook her head.\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m thankful for your offer, but I have no concerns.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so?\u201dAs if he was sorry, Zenard withdrew his body back.\u201cLady Lubella, I apologize. I must have been wrong. But my desire to help you is sincere, so if you have any concerns later, please come and find me.\u201d\u201cYou are a very kind and thoughtful person. I can see why Priest Luce recommended you. I will keep your words in mind.\u201dAfter giving a small bow to Zenard, Lubella kept on moving towards her room. Even as she was walking away, Zenard did not erase the smile from his face. However, as soon as Lubellacompletely disappeared from his sight, his expression immediately turned stiff.\u201c\u2026There\u2019s been a change.\u201dAs if his kind and gentle demeanor had all been an act, his face looked very twisted and cold. After looking in the direction Lubella disappeared off to for a long time, Zenard turned back and vanished into the darkness.* * *As the largest mining city, Suol produced more than 50% of the iron consumed by the Kingdom. The miners added vitality to the city as they moved towards the mining area at the crack of dawn. With a single lantern and a pickaxe, the miners had to dig in a dirty and dark cave. It was a dangerous situation for the miners, but because of the harsh conditions, there were many excellent and fierce veteran miners.Most people in Suol did work related to mining, but not everyone was a miner. One job unrelated to mining was being a Monster Exterminator. It was not an exaggeration to say that in this world, every place was threatened by monsters in one way or another. There were differences in severity between different areas, but even the capital city of the Kingdom had to deal with monsters.However, it was also crucial for the Kingdom to have a stable supply of iron. For this reason, the Kingdom made it their top priority to carry out large-scale monster sweeps around Suol at least twice a year. Therefore, Suol was safer than most villages and towns from monsters.However, this was all in relative terms; even Suol was not completely safe from monster attacks. As long as monsters existed in this world, no city or village was completely safe.To make up for this gap in protection, the Kingdom set up a complementary system, which was to find monster exterminators. It was a straightforward system that gave a set amount of money to those who caught monsters. Despite its simplicity, it was a somewhat effective solution. It was nowhere near the effectiveness of the Kingdom\u2019s large-scale monster sweeps, but it helped curb the number of monsters till the next monster sweeping season. Moreover, this system was much cheaper than mobilizing an entire army. It was also a good way for skilled fighters to make money.Thus, many different types of people became monster exterminators. Some people were retired mercenary soldiers, some were adventurers seeking to raise money for their journeys, and some were farmers looking for ways to pay their debts. As long as they could fight monsters, there were no limitations to becoming a monster exterminator.While leaning against a tree and sitting on a thick tree root, Zich said, \u201cSo it\u2019s really the best possible job for us.\u201dBut Hans, the only one who could hear him, did not have the leisure to even reply.Kweckkkkk!The orc screamed and swung his rusty ax around. The awful smell coming from the orc assaulted Hans\u2019 nose. However, Hans did not lose his focus on the orc\u2019s movements. If Hans got hit even once by the orc\u2019s ax, which was moving around with no sense of direction or logic but by pure brute force, he would be fatally injured.Orghhhh!The orc jumped towards Hans. While holding a half-rotten handle, the orc swung his ax with all his strength to split Hans into two.\u201cHup!\u201dHans had been quietly observing the orc before he jumped into action. He moved his feet widely and raised his sword.\u2018No matter how much strength and mana training I\u2019ve been doing, I\u2019m still just a beginner. I won\u2019t be able to block an orc via brute strength. Instead, I have to block their attacks by softly deflecting and letting the rest of the force flow out.\u2019Hans remembered Zich\u2019s advice. The harsh training he went through and all his past experiences allowed his body to move according to Zich\u2019s words.Zing!A rusty ax and a short sword met in the air.\u201cUgh!\u201d Hans cried in pain from the force of the orc\u2019s powerful swing. But even then, he did not drop his sword.Screeeech!The orc\u2019s ax began to slide past the tilted sword, and the orc\u2019s body began to fall forward.\u201cHuuuuup!\u201dHans made a loud yell and flexed his forearms. He put his foot forward and moved one step next to the orc\u2019s side. Then, as if the sword was brushing past the ax, he slid the sword to the side and pushed the ax away.Whish!With nothing blocking his path anymore, Hans made an excellent half-circle and pierced the orc\u2019s neck.Puck!Hans was only able to cut half of the orc\u2019s hard neck, but he was now used to these types of situations. He quickly moved his body to the side and moved his sword back.Swing!The orc swung where he was just a moment ago.\u201cThese tough bastards!\u201dA human being would have fallen into a state of panic after having their neck sliced halfway, but these orcs swung their axes nonstop without a care in the world. Before he knew what they were like, there were a few times Hans almost died. But he was able to use those experiences to become better at handling orcs.Glurg!Blood spurted out of the orc\u2019s neck. Anyone could see that Hans had just landed a critical hit, but even with this injury, the orc kept on fighting.Hans almost peed his pants seeing how the orc held his half flapping, severely bleeding neck with one hand and an ax with the other hand; but even the toughest orc could not go for long in this condition.Plop!The orc collapsed on the floor after a few steps. Hans carefully moved towards the fallen orc.Pierce!To make sure, Hans pierced the orc\u2019s head. The orc\u2019s body did not move at all.It was finally over. Hans finally let himself relax.\u201cAre you finally done?\u201dAs if he was bored, Zich let out a yawn. Even though Zich\u2019s behavior was beyond annoying, Hans could not say anything. Zich was the scariest of them all.\u201cYes,\u201d Hans replied with no strength in his voice.Zich got up and walked lazily towards the orc\u2019s dead body. Then he lifted the corpse as if the orc\u2019s two-meter-long body was as light as a cotton ball. Then he moved towards a sled next to them. There were already five orc corpses neatly piled on top of each other.Thud!With Zich\u2019s throw, there were now six.\u201cThis is good enough for now. Let\u2019s head back.\u201dThe words that Hans had been waiting for finally came out of Zich\u2019s mouth.\u201cYes, sir!\u201dHans replied with more energy than anything he said so far.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZich and Hans pushed their way down the mountain road. Hans dragged a sled behind him, and because the sled kept getting tangled into bushes and trees, he had to lift it up most of the time. The sled was heavy with orc corpses, and Hans\u2019 muscles screamed at him to stop. His mana was also at rock bottom, but Hans was happy to be done with his training.\u201cHow was it today?\u201d Zich asked as he sliced a small tree blocking their path. The usual self-reflection time began. It was difficult to drag the sled while thinking about the day\u2019s ordeals simultaneously, but Hans was used to it now.\u201cI think I did pretty well today.\u201d\u201cThen, are you saying you passed?\u201d\u201cN-No, sir!\u201d\u201cWhen I fought the first orc, I didn\u2019t properly swing my ax. My wrist ached for a while from that shock and messed up my swings later on. And when I fought that fourth orc, I didn\u2019t properly space the distance between my attacks. I took an unnecessary extra half-step, so my ax almost split in half.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201dHans tried to recall more mistakes in his battles, but he couldn\u2019t think of anything else.\u201cI-I don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d Hans answered with discouragement. Zich didn\u2019t talk for a moment, and Hans made furtive glances at Zich.\u201cWell, there are some more things, but you passed. I think you noticed the big things.\u201dHans breathed a big sigh of relief.\u201cThen, is there no additional training today?\u201d\u201cMan, why do you hate training so much? It\u2019s not even hard.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHans bit his lips hard to try to not say anything.\u201cYour generous master is simply trying to grant your wish. I thought you wanted to be like those heroes in storybooks. If that\u2019s the case, the quickest and best way to achieve that goal is to receive training from me.\u201dHans sighed that he had accidentally confessed his dream to Zich under the influence of alcohol.\u201cIf you want to be a hero, you have to have power first. Then you can beat up bad guys and laugh in your glory.\u201dZich explained his version of a hero to Hans. Hans\u2019 expression showed that he seemed to disagree with Zich, but Zich continued, \u201cYou have to get power foremost. You can think about becoming a hero or a villain afterward. If you go through my training, you will at least be one of the top five strongest in the world.\u201dHans thought Zich was exaggerating. He knew that Zich was strong and amazing, but he didn\u2019t think that Zich was strong enough to be the strongest in the world. Thus, he didn\u2019t realize how Zich\u2019s words were based on experience and had great credibility.\u201cOf course, no matter how much you work, you will never be able to beat a mega-genius like me.\u201dAs usual, the day ended with Zich complimenting himself, and Hans pouted. They walked while conversing some more, and soon, the trees and bushes that blocked their path disappeared. An ashy, gray-colored floor without a single grass patch greeted them.\u201cWe have already come this far?\u201d Zich murmured.Although they couldn\u2019t see trees and grass anymore, Zich and Hans were still on a high altitude bedrock of a tall mountain. It was a site in the center of the city of Suol called the Iruce Mine.They heard a noise nearby. The sun was slowly setting, and they saw a trail of people coming down. The people were miners who seemed to have finished their day\u2019s work.\u201cHuh? Isn\u2019t that Zich?\u201dOne of the miners, a young man, covered from head to toe in dirt, acted like he knew Zich. He was a man who had noticeable veins popping out of his forearms.\u201cHey, Sam!\u201dZich waved his arms, and the man named Sam trudged towards Zich with a pickaxe on his shoulders. Sam\u2019s eyes immediately moved to the sled with a pile of orcs.\u201cYou guys must have worked hard today. So diligent.\u201d\u201cI bet not as much as a miner.\u201dThe two snickered at each other, and Hans watched them in astonishment. From what he knew, Zich had befriended Sam recently. This was surprising since Zich was of noble birth and had been a successor to a high-status family. Even if many had protested against his succession, Zich was still a noble; thus, there was a vast difference in status between miners like Sam and a noble like Zich. Yet, Zich didn\u2019t seem to avoid befriending someone like Sam at all.\u2018He is mysterious in many ways.\u2019Hans stared at Zich\u2019s back as the two conversed happily.\u201cYou caught a lot today. Where did you catch them?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a three-hour walk from here.\u201dSam\u2019s face stiffened. Other miners also perked their ears.\u201cThree hours?\u201d\u201cYeah. But since we can use mana, we walk faster than you and move well even on a rough road. With your speed, it will probably take you at least six to nine hours.\u201d\u201cDamn it! These monsters are still too close.\u201dSam looked at the sled again.\u201cAnd it\u2019s also an orc! I don\u2019t know about goblins, but orcs are too much!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too much for me too.\u201d\u201cHow can we beat an orc?\u201dWith Sam\u2019s words, the miners each added in their comments. Their workplace, the Iruce Mine, was close to the area, but Zich said that he found monsters within a nine-hour walking distance. Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t even a weak monster like a goblin but an orc.\u201cWhen is the next Monster Sweep?\u201d\u201cNext month.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t they move the date forward?\u201d\u201cHow can we decide on that? The higher-ups decide the date, and it\u2019s not something that we have a say in.\u201d\u201cBut there must be something that we can do. It\u2019s a serious problem that there are already monsters near this area.\u201d\u201cHow did they take care of problems like this before?\u201dThe miners began to have a serious debate, and Sam also scratched his head roughly.\u201cDamn it! The mine is already in a mess even without this to worry about!\u201d\u201cIs there something going on?\u201d Zich asked.\u201cWhen we went to the mines this morning, our stored goods were missing or were in a mess.\u201d\u201cMaybe you imagined it, or a beast got to it.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s really not our imagination. We checked many times, and we also thought it was a beast at first, but people are worried that monsters are coming closer to us at a faster rate than usual.\u201d\u201cEven if monsters appeared here, I don\u2019t think they would loiter near the mines.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I would be happy. Maybe it\u2019s really the work of a beast. Or the works of a Mine Monster.\u201d\u201cA Mine Monster?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an old story that has been passed down in Suol since a long time ago.\u201dSam looked behind him. His colleagues were still talking to each other with serious expressions on their faces.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about that later. This is a quite serious matter, so I must participate in this debate. And ah, thank you for the information.\u201d\u201cThen buy me a drink later.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s not too expensive.\u201dSam joined his colleagues in a hurry.\u2018It must be a pretty serious matter.\u2019Hans didn\u2019t realize that the orcs that he caught by merely following Zich\u2019s orders would escalate into such a serious and important issue. To Hans, who was just beginning to gain battle experience by fighting orcs, it was difficult to think that far ahead.\u201cEveryone has their own troubles. We just have to take care of our troubles. Let\u2019s continue moving.\u201dAt Zich\u2019s words, Hans grabbed the sled handle again.\u201cUm\u2026\u201dZich and Hans heard a hesitant and shy voice, and they turned their heads toward the noise. There were three miners who didn\u2019t look much different from Sam; they were covered in a cloud of dirt and looked relatively young. One of the men looked a couple of years younger than Zich.\u201cAre you adventurers?\u201dAdventurer\u2014the young man\u2019s voice was full of romanticism at this word, as if he was describing the main character of a storybook who explored dungeons in unknown places, subjugated dragons, and saved beautiful princesses. However, that was just a fairytale.In reality, most adventurers teetered on a thin line between a gambler and a thug; they wandered around, dreaming of striking rich from one journey. They weren\u2019t full of justice like the way storybooks portrayed them to be, and most of them became bandits due to financial problems. Thus, many people didn\u2019t look at adventurers favorably. However, the miner who asked Zich and Hans if they were adventurers seemed like he still believed in storybooks.\u201cNo, we are not.\u201dAlthough they wandered around the world without any plans, Zich and Hans were still far from adventurers.\u201cI heard that you guys are traveling the world\u2026\u201dThe young man glanced at the miners who were still debating. His eyes were on Sam, and it seemed as if the young man had heard this news from him.\u201cThat is true, but who are you?\u201d\u201cAh! I forgot to introduce myself. I am Snoc.\u201d\u201cI am Zich.\u201d\u201cCould I perhaps hear about your travels?\u201d the young man asked with eyes full of admiration since he couldn\u2019t achieve his goals.\u201cHey, Snoc! What are you doing? We have to go now!\u201d\u201cI have to ask this person something\u2014!\u201d\u201c\u2014Stop talking nonsense! Those people also have to get on with their work! Why are you bothering them when the sun is almost setting?\u201d Sam shouted. Perhaps Snoc also thought he was acting like a nuisance, and he backed off while looking regretful.\u201cIf I meet you next time, I would really like to hear about your travels. Please, I beg you.\u201dThen Snoc hurriedly joined the rest of the miners and walked down the mountain. Zich stared at the distant group of miners and struck Hans\u2019 shoulders.\u201cLet\u2019s go too.\u201dHans grabbed the sled\u2019s handle.* * *Zich and Hans stayed in Suol for a while and trained. Hans\u2019 skills improved at a pace that would shock anyone; however, his development speed was nothing compared to Zich\u2019s.Ziiing!The mana circulated smoothly in Zich\u2019s body. His body, which used to creak whenever the mana overflowed, had no problems now. Then Zich tried to halt his mana and dramatically increase it to its maximum.Twitch!Zich\u2019s body trembled slightly, and he stopped the flow of mana.\u2018I need a bit more time.\u2019It wouldn\u2019t take him too long.\u2018I won\u2019t be too late.\u201dThe day that a great catastrophe would befall Suol was drawing closer. Zich felt like he could finish preparations before then.Push!While Zich was thinking this, Hans, who was hunting monsters like usual, chopped up an orc. Like how Zich was almost used to his power, Hans was getting used to his monster hunting. The sun was starting to set, and Zich shouted while Hans loaded some orc corpses onto the sled, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dThey went down the mountain and went to the Monster Exterminator branch store. It was located a bit far away from the city because they couldn\u2019t have built a store, where monster corpses went in and out, near where people lived.\u201cHey, you are here today too.\u201dA rough, bandit-looking middle-aged man welcomed them. He was the branch manager named Paul Chenu.\u201cHow many did you catch today?\u201d\u201cSix orcs and three goblins.\u201dZich answered, and Paul Chenu scowled.\u201cDamn it! They are increasing. Where did you find them?\u201d\u201cAround a six-hour walk by a normal person\u2019s standards.\u201dThat was almost right around the corner, and Paul Chenu nodded.\u201cUrgh! I am so glad I called those guys.\u201d\u201cThose guys?\u201d\u201cYeah. I called some skilled adventurers and mercenaries this time. The monster sweep is going to be next month even though the monsters are coming close. Since we can\u2019t close the mine down, we have to solve this problem independently.\u201dAt that moment, someone came inside the store.\u201cHe is one of them.\u201dPaul Chenu pointed sideways with his chin.A heavily armored man stood in front of the store\u2019s entrance. His crooked posture and mannerisms looked unfriendly.\u201cHey Drew! You finally came?\u201dPaul Chenu welcomed him with his arm raised, but the man, Uljon Drew, nodded his head slightly. The man was obviously rude, but Paul Chenu just shrugged his shoulders. In his field of work, there were many guys with terrible personalities.\u2018Well, that guy is among the worst though.\u2019Of course, Paul Chenu didn\u2019t say this thought out loud.\u201cDid you catch many today?\u201dDrew took out something from his clutches; it was a small box the size of his palm. The box seemed like it was made from wooden material, and strange symbols decorated its surface. He opened the box. Something jumped out and fell to the ground.Drop!It was heavy. Considering the box\u2019s size, the sound was loud, but onlookers could understand why when they realized what the object was. The thing seemed way too big to have come out of the small box.\u201cIt\u2019s an artifact.\u201dZich told Hans whose eyes widened in surprise.\u201cThat thing is?\u201d\u201cBy the looks of it, it\u2019s an item that can store goods no matter the volume or weight. Among artifacts, it\u2019s a pretty common type. Of course, that doesn\u2019t make it less rare.\u201dHans looked back and forth between the box and the thing that fell out of it.\u201cDoes that count as an item?\u201dWhat came out of the box were monster corpses. Most of the bodies were orcs and goblins, but corpses of medium-level monsters like trolls were mixed in. There were a considerable number of corpses.\u201cA corpse can be totally counted as an item. It\u2019s only a living creature when the creature is alive. When it\u2019s dead, what is it more than a piece of meat? It\u2019s the same for a human corpse.\u201dHans scowled with intense disgust.\u201cHe is amazing as ever.\u201dPaul Chenu examined the monster\u2019s corpses and expressed his awe. However, he didn\u2019t end it with just admiration.\u201cBut where were these monsters? Especially the trolls. Do you think they will appear near the city or the mines in a month\u2019s time?\u201dThis was very important. The difference between low-level monsters like goblins and orcs and mid-level monsters like trolls were huge. For the city\u2019s safety, he had to identify the situation clearly. However, like he couldn\u2019t be bothered, Drew glanced at Paul Chenu once and turned his head.\u201cFigure out the sum and prepare it by evening.\u201dAnd then he strutted out of the store.\u201cUh, huh? Hey! Hey, Drew!\u201d Paul Chenu called the man urgently, but Drew left without even turning back.\u201c\u2026How can there be a person like that?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dIn comparison to Hans who was astounded, Zich looked indifferent.\u201cI mean, isn\u2019t his attitude too rude, sir?\u201d\u201cWhy are you overreacting? That much is cute.\u201dIn comparison to people who pulled out a person\u2019s spine for not concentrating on what they said, or gouged a person\u2019s eye for glaring at them, or sliced off a person\u2019s head for not liking the way they looked, Drew\u2019s behavior was similar to a child\u2019s tantrum.\u201cMoreover, you\u2019re not even the one affected by his behavior. I don\u2019t think he committed a sin big enough for me to kill him in the name of doing a good deed.\u201d\u201cSir, if that person showed the same attitude to you, how would you react?\u201dHans asked this since Zich said, \u2018You\u2019re not even the one who\u2019s affected.\u2019\u201cI\u2019d crack his skull open. Isn\u2019t that obvious?\u201dAs expected, Zich was Zich.\u201cOr is that not living a kind life? No, you should at least be prepared to have your head cracked if you pick a fight with someone. Um, then that will definitely make me faultless\u2014since it\u2019s self-defense. I guess I won\u2019t have any problems then.\u201dYes, that was right. Hans gave up on understanding Zich\u2019s way of thinking and quietly accepted his fate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cTwo jugs of beer and two pieces of rabbit meat, please!\u201d Zich sat on a chair and shouted. Hans quickly sat down in front of him.\u201cYou can rest in the lodging if you are tired,\u201d Zich smiled while he said this, but Hans shook his head.Hans\u2019 greatest joy these days was a drink after his training. Just for this moment, he endured sleeping in the mountains and fighting monsters. No matter what Zich said, Hans couldn\u2019t give this up, and Zich chuckled at Hans\u2019 fervent response. Before his order came, he put his arm on the back of his chair and looked around the bar.\u201cOh, wait?\u201dZich heard loud voices in the corner of the room. A large group had connected several tables and were laughing and talking. One member of the group wiped his tears from laughing so much and noticed Zich staring at him.\u201cZich!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Sam.\u201dZich waved his hand.\u201cOhh, is he Sam\u2019s friend?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t he the guy we met in front of the mine entrance last time?\u201d\u201cAh, he is the guy who catches monsters and ensures our safety.\u201d\u201cWhat! We can\u2019t just leave a man like that!\u201d\u201cOf course! As a man from the mines, if I don\u2019t serve him a drink, I should cut off my balls!\u201dThe miners talked and gathered around Zich\u2019s table. Then they forcefully attached Zich\u2019s table to theirs.\u201cUh? Huh?\u201dDazed, Hans swiveled his head around; in comparison, Zich looked like he was enjoying himself and followed the miners\u2019 movements.And\u2026\u201cCheers!\u201d\u201cCheers!\u201dMore than ten glasses collided in the middle, and Zich poured beer into his throat. The angle of his beer glass arched deeply, but Zich didn\u2019t break away. Soon, the lukewarm beer disappeared from the glass with one gulp.\u201cHaa!\u201dLetting out a refreshing shout, Zich slammed the beer glass on top of the table. All the miners laughed at the sight.\u201cWow, you look dainty, but the way you drink proves that you are a real man!\u201d\u201cOf course, he is my friend! Do you think I will just befriend anybody?\u201d Sam shouted while wrapping his arms around Zich\u2019s shoulders. Hans watched the loud and vulgar but vibrant sight in front of him in amazement. Zich laughed and sang with his beer glass raised, fitting in perfectly with the miners. Who would have thought he was the Steelwalls\u2019 successor not too long ago?\u201cIn comparison, look at him. His buddy doesn\u2019t seem to be enjoying himself?\u201d\u201cS-Sorry?\u201dOne of the miners struck up a conversation with him, and Hans awkwardly replied. The man\u2019s reddened face stared at him intently.\u201cHe is no fun. What\u2019s your relationship with Sam\u2019s friend?\u201d\u201cHe is my servant,\u201d Zich answered. \u201cPlease understand. He doesn\u2019t know how to match the mood since he grew up sheltered.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem fitting for an ex-aristocrat like Zich to say this, but Zich fit in so well with the miners that Hans couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201cHold up. I thought he was just your companion\u2014he\u2019s your servant? Is Sam\u2019s friend actually someone of high status?\u201dAlthough he said that, the miner didn\u2019t really believe it. His voice was full of mischief.Zich responded while smiling, \u201cFufufu, maybe. I might be the son of a \u2018Great Sir\u2019 who ran away from his home after his feelings were hurt, you know?\u201d\u201cHey! That Great Sir must not be a noble. Acting as a noble means capital punishment!\u201d Sam said this while laughing. All the other miners and Zich laughed too. However, Hans, who knew the truth, couldn\u2019t laugh.The drinking party continued like that for a long time. While they poured and drank, a great amount of beer disappeared. On top of that, because Zich offered to pay a great sum, the atmosphere in the party shot up by several folds. They all talked while feeling tipsy.Then, someone carefully approached Zich.\u201cHello\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dZich stared at the person; it was a familiar face.\u2018He must be the miner who admires adventurers.\u2019\u201cHello. I met you a few days ago\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I remember. You said your name was Snoc.\u201dSnoc\u2019s face brightened up.\u201cYes, Yes! I am Snoc! You remembered!\u201d\u201cYou said you want to hear about my travels?\u201d\u201cYes! My dream is to become an adventurer! I want to wander around this huge world without a destination in mind and travel wherever I feel like! I want to explore mysterious places, meet outstanding companions, find ancient ruins, and\u2026!\u201dSnoc spat out words nonstop. It wasn\u2019t a very important story; it was just a story without an ounce of reality like those from children\u2019s storybooks, filled with romanticism and adventure. And while Snoc talked, his expectant eyes never left Zich.However, instead of Zich, it was Hans who asked Snoc a question.\u201cWhy do you want to travel so badly? Traveling isn\u2019t as dreamlike as you say.\u201dSince he was forced into this journey, Hans\u2019 voice was mixed with low, pent-up anger. Maybe Hans was more enraged because he saw his past self in the man who romanticized traveling around the world.Snoc couldn\u2019t answer immediately. He looked around his surroundings, and after making sure that no one was interested in this conversation, he confessed his true feelings.\u201c\u2026I hate the mines.\u201dHe said it quietly, but his tone was laced with several emotions.\u201cI hate that I have to keep pickaxing in a place without a single ray of light in a stuffy space with clouds of dust flying everywhere. When I straighten my back to look around, all I see is a black, rock wall. When I look around my surroundings, I keep thinking that\u2014\u201d Snoc said all this with gloom in his eyes, \u201c\u2014The pit I dig will be my grave.\u201dWhen he thought this, Snoc felt chills go down his back.\u201cYou are saying that again?\u201dHe heard a voice full of discomfort. It was mixed with a bit of drunkenness, but his pronunciation indicated that he wasn\u2019t completely drunk.\u201c\u2026Sam.\u201dSnoc lowered his shoulders, and Sam turned around. As if he had listened to the whole conversation, Sam looked like a mom who found her children making trouble.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to stop your nonsense? How could you be an adventurer?\u201d\u201cI-It doesn\u2019t matter what I do!\u201dSnoc resisted, but his voice lacked strength.\u201cYeah, I wish that was the case. I wouldn\u2019t have cared about what you did with your life if it wasn\u2019t for your parent\u2019s request.\u201dSam placed his hand on top of Snoc\u2019s head and turned it around.\u201cAh, stop it!\u201dSnoc flung his hand around and struggled, but he couldn\u2019t escape out of Sam\u2019s firm grip. Sam was ten centimeters taller than Snoc, and he was also much stronger.\u2018They are like brothers.\u2019Zich thought that they looked like a pair of siblings, in which the older brother tried to stop his younger brother from acting impulsively. According to their conversation, it seemed like they weren\u2019t related by blood but had grown up like brothers since they were young.\u201cSo, you want to listen to stories about my travels?\u201d Zich said.\u201cHey! Zich!\u201dSam tried to cut off Zich\u2019s words, but in contrast, Snoc\u2019s eyes sparkled.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI can tell you at least that much.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course. It\u2019s not even that hard. And I place importance in other people\u2019s dreams.\u201dZich\u2019s eyes curved. By his expression, it seemed like Zich would explain his story in detail and even reenact some parts, but for some reason, Sam felt a chill on his skin.\u201cBut you will have to take responsibility for it too.\u201d\u201c\u2026Responsibility?\u201d\u201cYes, responsibility.\u201dTo Snoc, whose face hardened a bit, Zich stressed his words.\u201cYou can achieve what you want in the world outside: beautiful scenery, blue sky, and freedom. If you are lucky, you will save people from bandits or monsters and get treated like a savior. You can even meet a beautiful lady in the middle of it too.\u201dIt was a dream that everybody dreamed of at least once in their lifetime.\u201cBut that\u2019s only if you have the skills. In addition to freedom and dreams, the outside world is full of danger. Although it may sound a bit harsh, you don\u2019t seem to have that kind of power.\u201dSnoc\u2019s arms looked firm with muscles. However, they were made through hard labor and weren\u2019t adequate for battle. Moreover, it wasn\u2019t a dream that he could achieve with just muscles.\u201cEven so, I don\u2019t want to tell you to do this and that with your life. Stories about traveling outside? I can tell as much as you want. It\u2019s not that hard. You could go on and be an adventurer after the stories I tell you, but that\u2019s none of my business. It\u2019s also none of my business if you become a monster\u2019s meal on a nameless mountain road. That will just add to all the common things that happen somewhere in this world.\u201dZich smiled widely, but nobody, including all those who stopped to listen to Zich\u2019s words, smiled with him.\u201cOkay then, should I start my stories of travel? Don\u2019t worry. Even though it hasn\u2019t been long since I began my travels, some of my stories may interest you.\u201dZich fixed his posture to begin telling his story, but Sam stopped him.\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Zich.\u201dThen, he approached Snoc with a stern look on his face.\u201cSee. That\u2019s what a traveler who has really gone out of the city says. Haven\u2019t I always told you? The adventurers you dream of only exist in storybooks.\u201dSnoc hung his head. Seeing his dejected face, Sam\u2019s expression softened. Then, like a brother facing his younger sibling, he began to comfort him quietly.\u201cBesides what you say, the work we do is vital to the Kingdom. It isn\u2019t inferior to any other job. Even the pay is plenty for commoners like us. Your father also did mining. So, don\u2019t think about anything else\u2014\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dIt was barely audible, but there was firmness in his voice.\u201cSnoc, you\u2014\u201d\u201cI am going out of the city no matter what happens. I don\u2019t want to keep doing this work even if it kills me. I don\u2019t want to live like my father!\u201dSlam!Snoc slammed the table and stood up. His chair made a loud thud as it rolled on the floor, and Snoc ran out of the bar.\u201cHey, Snoc!\u201d Sam called, but he couldn\u2019t stop Snoc. The bar\u2019s door creaked and answered for Snoc who didn\u2019t come back.\u201cSeriously, that guy!\u201dSam abruptly got up as if he was going to chase after him, but he sat down again. Then, he let out a big sigh.Zich commented, \u201cHe is quite stubborn. Most people will give up after they realize the truth. And even if they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll just repress it in their hearts and not respond like that.\u201d\u201cI apologize. He is still like that even after I scolded him many times.\u201d\u201cNo need for you to apologize. I can\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t intend to, but it\u2019s not like I said anything I didn\u2019t mean. I don\u2019t care what happens to him.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s cold.\u201dSam made a bitter smile. Although they were on the same wavelength sometimes, Zich said many cold words like this.\u2018Is it an adventurer\u2014no, a traveler\u2019s trait?\u2019If that was the case, Sam couldn\u2019t let Snoc hang onto his dreams even more. However, there was a corner of his heart that wanted to defend Snoc.\u201cActually, he\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Sam,\u201d Zich cut him off. \u201cEven if I know Snoc\u2019s situation or background, it doesn\u2019t change my response. So, there\u2019s no need for you to say anything. I wasn\u2019t even interested in the first place.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are all travelers like you?\u201d\u201cLet me see. I\u2019m also not interested in other travelers, so I don\u2019t know. Well, they probably won\u2019t all be the same. I mean, just look at the miners. You and Snoc are two people with completely different thoughts.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dEven though they were both miners, Snoc and he had completely different thoughts; this must also be true for travelers.\u201cBut since you are my friend, don\u2019t worry. It can\u2019t be helped if you get punished after committing a crime, but if you die an unjust death, I will avenge you.\u201d\u201cThank you for that.\u201dSam smirked and clinked his beer glass with Zich\u2019s glass.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thud.Snoc\u2019s footsteps were heavy and contained no energy. His whole body drooped down as if a heavy burden was pushing him down.\u2018Ah, I forgot my tools.\u2019Since he ran out without thinking, he had no time to pack his pickaxe or other equipment. While holding his head with both hands, Snoc sat on the ground.\u2018I don\u2019t think I will lose my tools, but\u2026\u2019Sam had been next to him. They grew up like siblings, so Sam would probably take care of his tools for him. However, it was uncomfortable to meet Sam right after their argument.\u2018It\u2019s going to be hard to talk to him for a while.\u2019But Snoc had no choice. He could not continue his life as a miner without his tools. Moreover, Sam would probably nag at him a few times, but he would not hurl any serious insults at him. Sam only nagged him because he cared about Snoc\u2019s well-being, and Snoc also knew that Sam\u2019s words were more realistic and reasonable than his dream.But\u2026\u2018But I still want to be an adventurer.\u2019Snoc couldn\u2019t let go of his dream. As if to revitalize himself, Snoc got up with a lot of energy. He put strength in his legs and began walking with great force. He straightened his hunched shoulders and erased all sadness from his spirits by singing, \u201cAn ancient being filled with wrath comes down upon us like a tidal wave. It\u2019s a disaster that has never been seen before.\u201dAs he sang, Snoc began to feel strange. The lyrics seemed to make him more sentimental rather than comfort his heart, but he ignored this feeling and continued to sing. This was his favorite song.\u201cPeople shiver in fear at his presence. His name is synonymous with fear.\u201dBam!Snoc saw stars in front of him. He hit the ground and hurt his butt. While rubbing his sore bottom, Snoc looked up at the man who bumped into him.He saw a man standing in the darkness. For a moment, Snoc was filled with admiration at the man\u2019s appearance. The man looked exactly like the adventurers Snoc had imagined: he wore thick leather armor and carried a longsword.\u201cYou are Snoc, right?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dSnoc had never seen the man before and was shocked that the man knew his name. But the man smiled as if he didn\u2019t care about what Snoc was thinking. There was something chilling about the man\u2019s smile.\u201cI heard you want to be an adventurer.\u201d* * *Like many days before, Hans and Zich went out to fight monsters. To be more specific, Hans was the only one working hard to fight monsters. It seemed as if Sam and Paul Chenu were right about the increasing number of monsters because they began to meet monsters more frequently. Even though this was good for Hans\u2019 training, this was not good news for Suol and all of its inhabitants.\u201cHaaaaap!\u201d Hans roared and swung his sword. His sword, which carried a lot of his strength, brushed the troll\u2019s neck.Burrrst!Blood burst out of the troll\u2019s neck and spilled over its throat; the troll couldn\u2019t even scream properly. However, trolls had amazing regenerative power, and their injuries quickly healed.\u201cHap!\u201dHans made another shout. His sword flew across the air. He evaded the troll\u2019s arms and moved towards the troll\u2019s neck again.Cut!Hans cut off the troll\u2019s neck along with the hand that was keeping the neck attached. No matter how great a troll\u2019s regenerative ability was, they could not survive with a sliced neck.Thud!The troll fell to the floor. Hans huffed and wiped the sweat on his forehead.\u201cI can capture smaller trolls with ease now.\u201dZich had been quietly watching Hans while walking towards him. Zich was honestly surprised. When they were at Steelwall, Hans had never wielded a sword and spent all his time doing household chores. At the beginning of their journey, Hans was out of breath after beating one goblin.But now, Hans had evolved into defeating a troll (even if it was not fully developed yet). Even Hans could not believe that he had become strong enough to beat a troll. As if he was checking his strength, he clenched his fists.Flutter!The bush shook. Hans quickly moved back and held up his sword. He stood in a ready position, but Zich raised his hand to stop him.\u201cLower your sword. It\u2019s not a monster.\u201dZich knew who the figures were. Hans lowered his sword.Two people came out of the bush. It was strange to see such different people together.\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you Snoc?\u201d Zich called out to the person he was more familiar with. As if he was surprised to be called by his name, Snoc jumped and stared at Zich. He looked like a child caught red-handed by an adult.\u201cWhat are you doing? Why aren\u2019t you moving quickly?\u201dA low voice urged Snoc from the back. The man\u2019s tone sounded as if he was looking down on Snoc.Snoc flinched and Zich stared at the man behind him.\u2018Was he the adventurer called Drew?\u2019He was one of the adventurers hired by the city to curb the number of monsters before the next large-scale monster sweep.\u2018It looks like he has a nasty temperament, which is fitting for an adventurer.\u2019It was surprising to see them together since there were no similarities between a miner and an adventurer. Drew pressed Snoc to go forward, but he paused when he saw Zich and Hans. Drew\u2019s eyes frantically moved around to gauge the situation, but when he saw Hans soaked in sweat and a small troll next to him, Drew let out a smile.\u201cThere\u2019s a weak ass here who struggles to put down a barely developed troll.\u201dHans was taken back from being insulted out of the blue. Snoc was also surprised. It was only Zich whose facial expression did not change.\u2018Hmmm, it\u2019s true that Hans is a weak ass.\u2019Zich didn\u2019t refute Drew\u2019s statement and agreed with him instead. But he was not going to let Drew\u2019s insult slide.\u2018Even though it\u2019s true that he is a weak ass, as his master, I\u2019m the only one who can call him that.\u2019\u201cThere\u2019s a person with shit for brains here that calls a beginner who just started training a weak ass.\u201dDrew\u2019s up-turned lips immediately went down. He turned his head, and his sharp eyes glared at Zich.\u201c\u2026What did you say to me?\u201d\u201cDo you not only have problems with your brain but also with your ear? You can\u2019t even judge a person properly, so your eyes are also shit. Oops, I didn\u2019t realize you were a sick person and insulted you unfairly. I sincerely apologize.\u201dZich lowered his head. It was to ask for forgiveness, but nobody thought it was sincere.\u201cThis bastard is asking for death!\u201dDrew took out a giant sword from his back.\u201cHey, don\u2019t be like that. I want to live a kind life. I don\u2019t want to fight a pitiful bastard who has problems with his ears, eyes, and brain.\u201dContrary to his words, Zich also took out his swords with swift movements. An explosive murderous atmosphere and tension began to fill the space around them.\u201cW-wait a moment!\u201d Snoc intervened between them. \u201cP-Please calm down for a bit!\u201d\u201cMove it!\u201dDrew glared at Snoc with sharp eyes. Snoc\u2019s back became immediately soaked with sweat, but he endured Drew\u2019s glare.\u201cWon\u2019t you look over his behavior for m-me? This person is an acquaintance of my friend.\u201dThen Snoc turned back and looked at Zich.\u201cYou are Mr. Zich, right? Won\u2019t you also calm down? This person is my teacher!\u201d\u201cTeacher?\u201dZich stared at Drew.\u2018He is going to make that bastard his teacher? This punk\u2019s skill seems so-so, and his personality sucks ass.\u2019The only things one could probably learn from him were provoking fights and making dirty expressions. Then another sound interrupted them.Shake!The bush shook roughly once more. Hans and Snoc jumped in surprise. Compared to them, Zich and Drew merely turned their heads.Thud!A dirty green foot popped out. Soon, a ginormous body with a hideous face appeared in clear view; it was a troll.The troll was carrying a rudimentary wooden bludgeon, and it looked around its surroundings. Then it let out a big laugh. The troll seemed happy to see many available prey.\u2018It\u2019s a big one.\u2019This troll finished growling; the monster was too much for the current Hans to handle. Zich was about to kill the troll when Drew stepped forward.Grunt!Drew walked towards the troll with a sword in his hand. A sharp glint shone on his weapon.Oohwaaaaa!The troll made a loud sound and went straight towards Drew. The troll looked ferocious as it moved its enormous muscles. And Zich put back his sword. Then, he folded his arms and watched Drew fight.Crack!The troll\u2019s bludgeon came down and hit the ground. Dirt and grass flew everywhere, and a giant hole was left on the ground. But Drew had long moved his body to the side.\u201cHap!\u201dDrew swung his sword. The silver sword shone sharply in the sunlight.Pierce!A deep cut appeared on the troll\u2019s shoulder.Kuaaaaak!The troll let out an angry yell from the pain. It began to move its bludgeon even harder.Swoosh!Moreover, the troll\u2019s injuries began to heal at a fast rate. But Drew stayed calm and continued to wield his sword. When one cut was healed, he made two cuts; when two cuts were healed, he made three cuts. The troll\u2019s movements became more and more limited from Drew\u2019s constant attacks.\u201cHup!\u201dDrew evaded the troll\u2019s attack again and cut through the troll\u2019s arm as if he was dropping down an ax.Crash!\u201cAhhhhhhhh!\u201dThe sword pierced halfway into the troll\u2019s arm. It was the deepest cut that Drew had made so far. While the troll was shaking, Drew pushed the sword in further.\u201cHaaap!\u201dThen Drew made a loud shout and moved towards the troll\u2019s neck.Slice!The giant sword pierced through the troll\u2019s neck. His swing was wide, and he was almost able to completely slice off the troll\u2019s neck.Cough!The troll let out its tongue and began coughing, but Drew only put more strength into his sword.Swoosh!A roughly beaten head of a troll floated into the air and plopped to the ground.Swish!As if to show off, Drew put his giant sword on his back with a loud swing. He looked somewhat cool as he posed in front of a blood-soaked troll. Both Hans and Snoc, who called himself Drew\u2019s disciple, looked at Drew with admiration in their eyes.\u2018Man, he\u2019s showing off so much for a troll.\u2019Obviously, Zich was unimpressed. Drew worked so hard to kill just one troll and was now pretending to be cool. If Zich took as long as Drew in beating one troll, he would have died from embarrassment.Swoosh!The troll\u2019s corpse disappeared into Drew\u2019s magic box. Then Drew put the box back into his pocket. He looked between Hans and the small troll and his gaze finally landed on Zich.\u201cHmph!\u201dDrew turned around as if Zich wasn\u2019t even worth his time.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dDrew fixed the position of his sword and began walking, and Snoc followed closely from behind. Snoc made an apologetic expression towards Zich, and after bowing his head once, he disappeared into the forest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWow, what a bastard,\u201d Zich grumbled.\u2018Hah, my personality has really become better. I actually let a guy like that go.\u2019If it wasn\u2019t for Snoc, who Sam cared for like a brother, and the troll that appeared at the right time, Zich would\u2019ve broken a couple of Drew\u2019s limbs by now.Hans approached Zich and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s their relationship?\u201d\u201cAn adventurer and a miner. They don\u2019t seem to have much in common.\u201d\u201cSnoc fantasizes adventurers. He probably followed Drew to learn a couple of things. I heard him address Drew as \u2018Teacher.\u2019\u201d\u201cGood for him.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that,\u201d Zich said negatively.\u2018There\u2019s no way a guy like that will raise a disciple.\u2019Moreover, Zich had never heard about an adventurer raising a disciple. Adventurers were people who were too busy with their day-to-day tasks of surviving.\u2018At best, he will be a luggage carrier, and at worst, a meat shield. If he is unlucky, he will be used for something worse.\u201dMost people would have lost interest by this point, thinking, \u2018It\u2019s his life,\u2019 but Snoc was someone his friend Sam dearly cared for, so the matter concerned Zich a tiny bit\u2014as much as an ant\u2019s teardrop.However, he didn\u2019t think of doing something amazing for Snoc. It ended at the level of: \u2018Maybe I should give Sam a heads-up?\u201d\u201cB-By the way, thank you, sir.\u201d\u201cHuh? About what?\u201dHans thanked him out of nowhere, so Zich stared at him strangely. If Hans was spitting out words in a mentally dysfunctional state, Zich was willing to hit Hans on the head a couple of times to cure him.\u201cDidn\u2019t you get angry because you heard him insulting me?\u201dNot only did Zich treat him much better than usual, but Zich got angry in his place. So Hans felt a tiny bit moved, but Zich smiled in response. Then Zich raised his hand and struck his head.Slam!\u201cAh!\u201dHans grabbed onto his head.\u201cWho took your side? Of course, I got mad. He dared to insult my servant, which is the same as insulting the great me. Truthfully, you are a weak-ass.\u201d\u2018What did I expect\u2026\u2019 Hans grumbled inside his mind and held his head.\u201cBut still, that adventurer was strong, right? He caught a troll so easily.\u201dTo Hans, who was barely able to defeat a troll, the adventurer named Drew seemed powerful.\u201cWhat?\u201dZich\u2019s tone was full of displeasure.\u201cWho are you calling strong?\u201d\u201cSorry? You know the adventurer\u2026\u201dRustle! Rustle!The bush swayed again.\u201cHuh? Did they come back?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dZich took out his sword again.\u201cThey are monsters this time.\u201dCraack!A thick branch broke off and fell to the ground, and five trolls waddled into view.Hans\u2019 face grew pale. Even one troll was frightening, but five was an unimaginable number. Even that impressive adventurer, Drew, had taken a long time to defeat one troll. In a situation like this, most people would have grabbed onto their bladder to stop themselves from peeing and run away as fast as they could.Clang!But Zich was different.\u2018I\u2019m still annoyed, so this is perfect!\u2019Zich was glad to have some stress relief.Step!Zich jumped off the floor.Uuuuurrrrr!The trolls shrieked at the human running towards them and raced towards Zich. It was easy to imagine a scene where five gigantic monsters surrounded Zich and smashed him into a juice pulp with their clubs. However, the result was the opposite.Swing!Zich swung his sword widely. His weapon was a longsword, but it looked like a thin, wooden stick compared to the troll\u2019s immense body. Yet, the powerful mana that permeated the sword made up for the weapon\u2019s limited size.Slice! Slice!The first two trolls split into two. A dead-straight, silver line bloomed out of the troll\u2019s heart and sliced their body, arms, and even their clubs. Everything under his sword\u2019s touch split.Splaaaash!Blood poured out of their wounds and sprayed onto their companions. The trolls faltered\u2014they had never seen their companions split into two pieces instantly. On the other hand, Zich lowered his body to avoid the blood spray and continued moving.Push!He pierced the stomach of the troll closest to him. It would have been a fatal hit for a human, but it was a medium-sized wound for a troll. The troll simply scowled in pain and didn\u2019t feel a great sense of danger towards its life. But of course, that didn\u2019t last long.Wing!The mana from Zich\u2019s body traveled through the sword and began to flow into the troll\u2019s body aggressively.Blop!Like a pig\u2019s bladder filled with water, the troll bloated in an instant. In the next moment\u2014Pop!The troll\u2019s body burst out. Its skin, blood, bone, and organs scattered all over the place. It was an extremely disgusting scene, but the disintegrated troll pieces that contained Zich\u2019s mana were even nastier.Glop! Glop! Glop! Glop!The troll\u2019s remains stuck to the remaining two trolls. The trolls\u2019 regenerative powers activated from the remains, but the consecutive bomb attacks of the remains exceeded their powers. The trolls couldn\u2019t even scream, and they fell to the ground with huge holes in their bodies.\u201cHm!\u201dIn a blink of an eye, Zich killed five trolls and turned his back away from the mess of troll blood and remains. Surprisingly, his body didn\u2019t have a single scratch or a smear of blood. After sheathing his sword, Zich called out to Hans who had his mouth hanging wide open.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cY-Yes, sir!\u201dHans looked at Zich\u2019s back from a good distance away and gulped his saliva back down.\u2018The adventurer named Drew is strong, but Sir Zich is on another level.\u2019Zich took care of those scary trolls like they were trash on the road, and Hans shivered from witnessing his mighty power.* * *A night in Iruce Mine was dreary. In the daytime, miners\u2019 hearty cheers and axing rang through the surroundings, but now, it seemed like ghosts would wail out of the mines. However, in this desolate and ominous place, moving figures made long shadows on the ground.A faint light lit up the mine. Snoc had his shoulders hunched as he walked forward with a lamp. It was his first time entering the mine without his colleagues.\u201cW-Will this really be alright?\u201d Snoc asked Drew who was following him from behind.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cGoing inside the mine at night is dangerous\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought I told you I got permission.\u201d\u201cY-Yes.\u201dSnoc closed his mouth, but he still felt anxious.\u201cWhat? Do you not believe me?\u201d\u201cN-No! I believe it! I believe it!\u201d Snoc answered out of nervousness. Then Drew stared at Snoc with a dissatisfied expression, but he spoke with more kindness than usual.\u201cI know you are nervous, but an adventurer doesn\u2019t know when he will fall into danger. That\u2019s why experience is most important. That\u2019s why I keep bringing you along for my monster hunts. Being an adventurer is not just like the storybooks.\u201dSnoc nodded. Sam and Zich, who weren\u2019t really adventurers, also said the same thing.\u201cIt\u2019s the same this time. All of this is for you. If we have a mine like this, we should utilize it since there are many dungeons in caves like this. You can get experience from this.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dDrew had warned him about the dangers of an adventurer and helped prepare Snoc\u2019s mind and heart. Snoc pushed down the doubts that were beginning to appear in his heart. Furthermore, Drew mentioned a dungeon\u2014wasn\u2019t that an adventurer\u2019s dream? Snoc couldn\u2019t calm his rapidly beating heart.\u201cOk, then let\u2019s continue moving.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSnoc walked the mine with slightly more energy than before. From behind, Drew made a secretive smile. They continued to walk inside the mine, and since Snoc knew his way inside the mine, they didn\u2019t need to worry about getting lost.Drew asked, \u201cAre you continuing to train your mana?\u201dThe first and only thing that Drew taught Snoc was how to open his mana.\u201cYes, I stimulated my mana this morning too.\u201d\u201cTry walking while activating your mana.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dSnoc brought out his mana, but because he had just learned to control his mana, it was a tiny amount. Furthermore, if he didn\u2019t concentrate enough, it broke off easily.\u201cWah!\u201dSnoc was so focused on his mana flow that he didn\u2019t notice a jagged stone and fell to the ground.\u201cUghh!\u201dHe scraped his knees, and blood flowed out. Still, Drew didn\u2019t show any signs of concern and ordered him to continue walking. Thus, Snoc hesitantly got up and began to walk again. Then he fell to the ground once more and the cycle repeated. After walking a good distance, Snoc\u2019s body was covered in bruises and scratches.Bam!\u201cUgh!\u201dSnoc tripped over a jagged rock again and barely maintained his balance. He breathed a sigh of relief and lifted his head, but his eyes became still at what he saw. In front of him, there was a new mine.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI-It\u2019s nothing.\u201dSnoc hurriedly answered and lifted his body up. Then, he began walking again. However, he didn\u2019t even glance at the new mine that just appeared, as if the place was prohibited.\u201cWe are not going that way?\u201dDrew looked at the mine and asked. Snoc bit his lips and pretended to be calm; then he opened his mouth again.\u201cIt collapsed, so it\u2019s dangerous. We shouldn\u2019t go in. We\u2019d only see debris and wrecks there anyway.\u201d\u201cOh, is that right?\u201dDrew didn\u2019t ask any more questions. However, even as he followed Snoc, his eyes remained on the collapsed mine. His eyes sparkled mysteriously.\u201cAh!\u201dOnce again, Snoc had made a wrong step. From his ears, Snoc heard Drew\u2019s exasperated sighs. Not wanting to disappoint Drew, Snoc ignored the pain he felt all over his body and tried to get up again.Koo.Halt!Snoc\u2019s body froze when he heard an unfamiliar cry nearby. He quickly picked up his lantern and lit the area where he heard the noise. A small shadow was crouching in the corner of the mine.Koo! Koo!The small figure pointed his nose and sniffed at Snoc.\u201cOh, it\u2019s just a mole,\u201d Snoc sighed in relief. However, this mole was strange. Most moles ran away at any sign of movement, but this one didn\u2019t. Instead, the mole placed his nose on Snoc\u2019s ankles and kept smelling it.Koo!The mole cried as he looked up. Snoc was also interested in the mole. However, Drew didn\u2019t let him linger.\u201cWhat are you doing? Quickly move.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSnoc quickened his steps.Thud! Thud!Tap! Tap!Matching the sound of Snoc\u2019s footsteps, a small animal moved. Snoc looked below him and saw that the mole was following next to him. The mole had his head raised as if he wanted to meet his tiny eyes with Snoc\u2019s, and the way he followed Snoc around was cute.Bump!Snoc pushed the mole away lightly with the edges of his feet. The mole twitched a bit and tottered behind Snoc again. Snoc bumped the mole away again, but the mole came back. He did it again, and the mole came back again. Snoc\u2019s mind became occupied by their little game.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dHe heard a chilly tone.\u2018That\u2019s right\u2014I\u2019m training right now!\u2019\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry! I will continue!\u201dSnoc gathered up his mana again and walked ahead. He couldn\u2019t place his attention on the mole anymore.Koo.However, the mole continued to follow Snoc. As if the mole wasn\u2019t even aware that he could get stepped on, the mole kept lingering around Snoc\u2019s feet. And from behind, Drew watched the whole scene with a mischievous smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A refreshing air that contrasted the suffocating atmosphere inside the mine softly caressed his body. He couldn\u2019t have felt happier to see the silverish moon or hear the chirps of nameless bugs outside.\u201cYou have done well.\u201dWith those careless words, Drew left and went down the mountain by himself. Drew let out an aura like he didn\u2019t want to talk, so Snoc didn\u2019t say anything and absentmindedly watched as Drew disappeared out of view.\u201c\u2026Ow.\u201dHe felt pain all over his bruised and wounded body. Snoc sat down and touched his injured areas.Koo?\u201cHuh?\u201dIt was a familiar cry.Snoc stopped paying attention to the mole when he tried to focus on his mana control, so he didn\u2019t realize that the mole had followed him outside of the mine.\u201cWhat? You followed me all the way here?\u201dHe tried placing his hand on the mole\u2019s face. Most moles would have scrambled away at a human\u2019s hand, but this one rubbed his face on Snoc\u2019s hand.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a family?\u201dKoo.\u201cAre you alone?\u201dKoo.He continued to talk to the beast who probably couldn\u2019t even understand him. The mole let out a small cry after every sentence, but Snoc didn\u2019t think that the animal was answering him. However, he had to admit that the mole was adorable. The mole that had no family and clung to a stranger also reminded him of himself.\u201cDo you want to come with me?\u201dSnoc stopped patting the mole; he turned his hand and placed it in front of the mole\u2019s feet. The mole poked the edge of his finger with his nose. Then, he crawled onto Snoc\u2019s hand.\u201cHaha! Oh, you must have wanted to come with me!\u201dHe felt a small amount of warmth in his hands. Snoc\u2019s body was all bruised up, but at that moment, he didn\u2019t feel any pain. He hugged the mole tightly to his chest, and the mole, which poked his head out from the edge of Snoc\u2019s shirt, sniffed around and situated himself in a comfortable spot.\u201cWhat should I call you?\u201dWhile tightly hugging his unexpected, new family member, Snoc went down the mine.* * *There wasn\u2019t a human presence in the mine, and a dreary silence encompassed the area. It was late, so the site\u2019s empty appearance was typical for its time. But soon after, the silence broke and a figure came into view. Surprisingly, it was Drew, who had left Snoc to go down the mine alone. He stared at the path that Snoc had taken and said, \u201cIt\u2019s going all according to plan.\u201dHis low tone sounded evil like a demon reciting his wicked plans.\u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201dWho was he talking to? Drew looked strange while talking to himself in an empty mine.\u201cYes.\u201dHe heard an answer inside the mine that was completely covered in darkness. A figure came out of the darkness and appeared into view. Anyone who saw the figure would probably have the same thought: \u2018He looks suspicious.\u2019The person didn\u2019t have a distinct characteristic or feature; he wore a dull, dark robe that made his face and physique look like a sack. Only his low voice indicated that the person was a man. Inside his robe that seemed to signify darkness, the man spoke to Drew.\u201cThank you for your work. As expected of Drew, who is famous even among the adventurers. Your talents are outstanding\u2014\u201d\u201cGet to the point.\u201dDrew spat on the ground; he didn\u2019t seem happy about the compliments aimed towards him.\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear your heartless flattery. I know you don\u2019t even think that. I know more about adventurers than anyone else.\u201dThey were morally ambiguous humans, right on the border of becoming bandits or thugs; and among them, Drew was the worst type of person. Of course, Drew didn\u2019t feel guilty about this. If he did, he wouldn\u2019t have fallen this low.\u201cI just want one thing.\u201dHe reached out his hand.\u201cMoney.\u201dIt was the absolute truth that moved and would always motivate Drew.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you can\u2019t give me the money right now. I won\u2019t accept that kind of bullshit.\u201dBloodlust pierced the robed man\u2019s back. This intention displayed how obsessed Drew was about money.\u201cOf course. I truly meant my compliments about your skills. And it\u2019s not like I won\u2019t give you what I promised.\u201dThe man rummaged through his belongings and took out a pouch. It looked very full and heavy.\u201cTake it.\u201dDrew caught the pouch. As soon as he opened it, he heard a loud clink! With just the dim moonlight, bountiful gold coins showed off their brilliant light. Most people would have stared at the scene in awe, but Drew didn\u2019t do that. Since he had been an adventurer for a long time, he knew not to let his guard down.\u201cWait.\u201dDrew increased his distance between him and the robed man. Then, he placed one of his knees on the ground and began to count each gold coin. He didn\u2019t forget to check the man\u2019s movements from time to time.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s right.\u201dAfter counting the last gold coin, Drew pulled the pouch strings and sealed it.\u201cYou didn\u2019t believe me?\u201d\u201cSo, are you disappointed?\u201d\u201cNot at all. Trusting a totally suspicious person like me is foolish rather than kind. As expected of you.\u201dWhy was it? No matter how many times he heard it, the robed man\u2019s words didn\u2019t feel like compliments but mockery to Drew. Yet, Drew didn\u2019t pick a fight for a reason like that. Since the man gave him a fortune for a small deed, (even with the worst personality ever) Drew didn\u2019t hold malice towards the man but just wariness.\u201cAnyways, I guess you don\u2019t have any more reasons to hang around that gullible fool who admires adventurers. Do you plan to continue your act as a teacher?\u201d the man asked.Drew sneered, \u201cWhy would I hang out with that trash?\u201d\u201cOh, dear. Didn\u2019t you at least bond with him a little?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s thickheaded. You can just tell by how long it took him to just open up his mana. If I have to keep looking after him, I might kill him out of annoyance.\u201d\u201cNot because he has talent?\u201dDrew glared at the man.\u201cAh, oh my. I was joking. I just thought that you might have not wanted to take him in as a disciple because you are jealous of his talent.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmph! I will admit that his mana is rare.\u201dDrew was shocked when he first tried to free up Snoc\u2019s mana.\u201cBut the rarer the mana is, the more restrictions there are. I am not so lacking to be jealous of that much.\u201d\u201cI see. I beg your pardon.\u201dThe robed man bowed to his waist, but his slow movements made Drew feel even more unpleasant. Drew didn\u2019t want to talk to the man any longer, and he turned around without a farewell.\u201cThank you for your help. If something comes up again, I will search for you.\u201dDrew heard the man\u2019s voice from behind, but he ignored it.* * *On the day they were resting after fighting monsters, an incident occurred. Zich was taking Hans out for some fresh air, and they were wandering around the marketplace to kill some time.They saw a person run across the road while panting and gasping. The man looked alarmed as sweat dripped down from him, and his breathing was rough. As the man got closer to them, Zich and Hans slightly moved to the side to get out of his way. The running man was about to pass them when his eyes met Zich\u2019s.\u201cAh!\u201dThe man suddenly stopped and approached Zich. Then he gripped Zich\u2019s shoulders tightly.\u201cYou were here! Thank goodness that I was able to find you!\u201dWas the man someone he knew? Zich scrutinized him.\u2018Wait, he\u2019s the miner who was with Sam.\u2019\u201cDid something happen to Sam?\u201dThat was the only reason why the man whom he had conversed once over some drinks would look so urgently for him. Zich\u2019s guess was spot-on.\u201cYes! Sam ran to the Monster Exterminator Building first thing in the morning! He said he had to place a complaint on the guy who taught Snoc!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s foolish of him.\u201dComplaints didn\u2019t work on people like adventurers. Unless one possessed military might, wealth, or authority, adventurers would wield violence towards a person even if they were in the wrong.\u201cYou didn\u2019t try to stop him?\u201d\u201cI did! But he didn\u2019t listen to me! They really are brothers! Like Snoc, Sam is so stubborn once he puts his mind on something!\u201d\u201cBut what is the complaint about?\u201d\u201cIt seems like the guy threw away Snoc!\u201d\u201cAre you saying that the adventurer isn\u2019t keeping Snoc as his disciple anymore?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that good? I thought Sam didn\u2019t like the idea of Snoc becoming an adventurer.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what that guy said when kicking Snoc out, but Snoc shut himself inside his house. It also seems like that guy took all of Snoc\u2019s savings while acting as his teacher! And that bastard won\u2019t give it back!\u201dThat was possible. It wasn\u2019t surprising that an adventurer would commit fraud.\u201cBecause of that, Sam blew up and ran out!\u201d\u201cSo, you came to ask for my help?\u201d\u201cYes, aren\u2019t you also strong enough to exterminate monsters? I thought you would at least be better than us, so I have been searching for you everywhere!\u201dIt was by pure luck that the man found Zich and Hans.\u201cPlease! Didn\u2019t you say that you were Sam\u2019s friend? I am so worried that something might happen to him!\u201dZich became lost in thought. He would have simply ignored the matter if the person involved was a complete stranger. However, while he was in the city, he had maintained a considerably close relationship with Sam.\u2018He is my friend, and I told him that I would avenge him if something happened to him. I also think that this is within the boundaries of a kind act too.\u201d\u201cI understand. I will go.\u201dAt Zich\u2019s answer, the miner\u2019s expression brightened up.* * *Zich, Hans, and the man who introduced himself as Crysin ran to the Monster Exterminator Building. It was unlikely for Sam and Drew to meet each other. Even if Sam came to the place in rage, Drew didn\u2019t live or work in the Monster Exterminator Building. The building was simply a place where people got money in exchange for monsters. However, like the saying, \u2018If you are lucky, you could get struck by lightning even under a clear sky and crack a nose from the fall,\u2019 an incident occurred.\u201cAh, hey! You came right on time!\u201dAfter running out of the building, Paul Chenu spotted Zich and rejoiced.\u201cPriest! Please call a priest!\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cA person might die at this rate!\u201dZich\u2019s expression hardened. He pushed Paul Chenu aside and went inside the store. After he opened the door and went inside, he caught a faint waft of blood. That wasn\u2019t strange. In a place full of monster corpses, there would always be a thick smell of blood. However, this smell wasn\u2019t from a monster.\u201c\u2026Sam.\u201dIn the middle of the venue, Sam was lying on the floor. He was in a dire state: his bloody face was so swollen that his features were ruined beyond recognition. His nose was flattened so that it whistled every time he took a breath, and half of his teeth were gone. His right arm and left leg were twisted in strange directions, and after lifting his top up, Zich saw that there were bruises all over his body.\u2018His ribs are probably broken.\u2019\u201cSam! W-What happened!\u201dCrysin ran to Sam\u2019s side in a hurry. He was hesitant to place his hand on Sam\u2019s body. Sam\u2019s body looked like such a mess that Crysin thought he might worsen the wounds by mistake.\u201cHans.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Hans answered, feeling nervous. He also thought that the situation was serious.\u201cGo to our quarters right now. There are potions in my bag. Bring me the whole bag.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHans disappeared like an arrow; his movements were extremely fast with the use of mana.\u201cP-Potions? Such a valuable thing?\u201dCrysin and even Paul Chenu, who stayed quiet, were surprised.\u201cThey\u2019re not that valuable to me, so it doesn\u2019t matter. Anyways, is Drew the one who made Sam like this?\u201d\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Paul Chenu answered. \u201cHe came into the store enraged, saying he had something to settle with Drew. I told him to go to the Magistrate instead since I knew what adventurers were like, especially guys like Drew. Even though he was emotional, I could still talk sense into him. After I kept persuading him, he understood and was about to leave. So, I thought the matter was resolved until\u2026\u201d\u201cThat bastard came in.\u201dAfter it was confirmed that Drew was the perpetrator, Zich immediately used the title, \u2018bastard\u2019 to describe Drew. Paul Chenu didn\u2019t deny it since he also thought that Drew was definitely a bastard.\u201cHis ears must be sharp because he knew the situation before he came into the building. I tried to let this man go, but Drew provoked him first.\u201d\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\u201cBecause of everything that went on, I don\u2019t remember exactly what he said but it went something like this, \u2018I just gave a piece of trash a taste of a hopeless dream. Rather than getting insulted, I should be thanked. Considering what I did, I should have gotten more than the pocket change I got from that piece of trash. I actually suffered a loss.\u201dThe \u2018piece of trash\u2019 must have meant Snoc, and in short, Drew claimed he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201cHm. Is that so?\u201dUnexpectedly, Zich\u2019s voice was indifferent. Paul Chenu, who thought Zich would jump up and down in anger, tilted his head in surprise. He could also spot the slightly upturned corners on Zich\u2019s lips. If they had known Zich in his Demon Lord days, they would have definitely gotten on their knees or ran away with everything they had.\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. He just left after making someone like this.\u201d Paul Chenu complained, \u201cI know how bad adventurers\u2019 personalities are, but how can they leave a person in this state!\u201dPaul Chenu possessed common sense like normal people, but to Zich, this amount of violence was nothing to fuss over. Although Sam\u2019s body was broken, it wasn\u2019t like he was split into two, and he was still alive. The important part was not the level of the violence, but who the target was.\u2018He dared to attack a person who I consider my friend?\u2019With this, the story changed; it made Zich highly involved in this case. Before his regression, Zich would have picked fights for any reason, but things were different now.\u2018Moreover, isn\u2019t he a bad guy?\u2019He conned somebody, took someone\u2019s fortune, and used violence on the person who tried to bring forth a complaint about him.\u201cIn other words, it means that even if I beat him half-dead, I won\u2019t be doing a bad deed.\u2019\u2018Beat him half-dead.\u2019An icy smile appeared on his lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySam was completely healed from the potions Hans brought. It was the result of using not just one but three potions.However, Sam didn\u2019t recover consciousness right away. Since he also received mental damage, it would take at least one or more days for him to gain consciousness. After sending Sam safely back to his house, Zich leaned in front of the Monster Exterminator Building and waited. It was obvious who Zich was waiting for.Paul Chenu came out of the building a few times and then said, \u201cHey, honestly, we don\u2019t want to be involved in this conflict. Since that Sam guy has already been healed, the security officials also won\u2019t enforce severe punishment on Drew.\u201dTo the high officials, the victim was just a miner. Moreover, it was not a conflict that occurred inside the city, so there was no reason for security officials to actively resolve this conflict.\u201cIf you cause a scene here and harm this building, it would be troublesome for us. This is an important national institution.\u201dThis building was more important than the life of one miner. This was not a surprising development since life was cheap in this world. Zich also knew this, and he didn\u2019t feel the need to complain.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will resolve this conflict without causing harm to the surrounding areas.\u201d\u201cAlso, it would be troublesome for us if you actually kill Drew. He was one of the adventurers we hired after all.\u201d\u201cOf course. You might not believe it, but I want to live a kind life. I\u2019m not going to easily kill someone, so don\u2019t worry too much.\u201dAnd as if to support his statements, Zich smiled brightly at Paul Chenu.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t really feel reassured by that smile.\u201dPaul Chenu flinched and took a step back.\u201cAnyways, just don\u2019t create a situation where we have to be involved.\u201dThat was the main reason for Paul Chenu\u2019s pestering; he didn\u2019t want to be involved in a dangerous and complicated affair. Zich also didn\u2019t blame or insult Paul Chenu\u2019s self-preserving attitude.\u201cOf course.\u201dAlthough Paul Chenu said everything he wanted, he didn\u2019t go back in and stared at Zich.Zich was about to ask Paul Chenu if he needed anything more from him when Paul Chenu first said, \u201cAre you confident that you can beat him? Our team specially recruited him. Even among the mercenary soldiers, he is very skilled. If you attack him with mediocre skills, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to get beat up.\u201dZich blinked his eyes. He stared at Paul Chenu as if he was seeing a strange, new species for the first time.\u201cW-why are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, I guess. Yes. Yeah, I guess you can think like that. You said something I didn\u2019t expect at all, so I was a bit taken back.\u201d\u201cReally, what\u2019s up with you? Did it not even cross your mind that you could lose?\u201dZich nodded, and it was Paul Chenu\u2019s turn to be surprised. Zich\u2019s confidence was over the roof.\u2018No, thinking about it, Drew is also super cocky. Are all adventurers or travelers like these guys?\u2019Paul Chenu\u2019s house and career seemed very precious to him then. No matter what happened, Paul Chenu firmly resolved to stick to his career and views for the rest of his life.* * *It was common to exterminate monsters multiple days in a row. Thus, Zich planned to wait at the exterminator building for several days.However, to his good fortune, Zich did not have to wait long. Drew appeared the day after he assaulted Sam.On that day, Paul Chenu was surprised to see Zich still standing in front of the entrance and quickly went inside the building. Then in the afternoon, Hans provided a simple meal for Zich to eat. After Zich finished his meal, he continued to stand in front of the building like a stone statue.It was now almost sunset. The shadows were getting longer, and the blue sky was about to turn yellow. Zich, who had his eyes half-closed, fully opened his eyes. There was a spark in them. He felt a presence near him\u2014a presence he had desperately wanted to see.\u2018He\u2019s here.\u2019Zich uncrossed his arms and stopped leaning against the wall. After a few moments, he saw someone strolling towards the building.It was Drew.Drew\u2019s footsteps were light; he showed no signs of even an inkling of guilt at his heinous actions. There was even an easygoing, giddy aura exuding from him, as if he felt refreshed after taking out an aching tooth. Even without looking at Zich, Drew tried to get into the exterminator building.\u201cStop.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dDrew crinkled his face. But when he saw who stopped him, he let out a mocking smile.\u201cWell, who is this? Aren\u2019t you the comrade of that weak ass who took his sweet time defeating a barely developed troll?\u201dAs expected, Drew was quick to insult him, and Zich\u2019s expression did not change.\u201cI told you he just started his training\u2026well, whatever. Actually, aren\u2019t you really sick in the head? No wonder you don\u2019t remember what I said to you recently. I\u2019m sorry about that. I should have been more considerate of your stupidity.\u201dIt was a miraculous sight to see Zich apologize. However, it was far from a proper apology.\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself. It\u2019s not a sin to be sick. Even though it would be really hard to live like that, you have to stay positive. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying? Cheer up!\u201dAs Zich continued, Drew\u2019s expression worsened. When Zich waved his fists to \u201ccheer\u201d him up, Drew\u2019s face looked as if it was going to explode.\u201c\u2026I thought this last time, but I really have to crush you down properly. It would also be a good idea to pull out that smart tongue of yours.\u201dWhen Drew pulled out his sword, Zich also pulled out his sword.\u201cThis is such a dilemma! I don\u2019t want to fight with a sick patient!\u201dZich continued to talk while laughing. But a second later, his face became serious.\u201cBut I just want to make sure. Did you beat the crap out of Sam?\u201d\u201cSam?\u201d\u201cYou know, that guy who came to complain to you right after you threw away that Snoc kid.\u201d\u201cAh, that trash?\u201d Drew did not deny it. Instead, he insulted Sam and laughed, \u201cNo wonder you were waiting for me. Have you come to avenge that trash?\u201d\u201cFor now. He\u2019s my friend.\u201d\u201cFriend?\u201d Drew laughed out loud. \u201cAs expected of someone who hangs out with a weak ass! You make friends with losers. No, no\u2014this is perfect. You guys are perfect for each other! Yeah! Like a loser, all of you should roll in mud together! Won\u2019t everything be better with a friend? Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you? Are you that type of person\u2026who judges people\u2019s skills based on their friends\u2019 skill levels?\u201d\u201cBirds of a feather flock together! I can tell how strong you are by the company you keep!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re flat out wrong. Well, I guess this is not something a person of your level would know.\u201dZich clicked his tongue and continued, \u201cListen carefully. People with mediocre skills like you befriend people who are similar to them so that they can make useful connections. You guys make friends based on people\u2019s social status or skill levels. But you know, people like me are different.\u201dNormal societal standards did not apply to Zich at all.\u201cI don\u2019t care about my friend\u2019s social status or skill level. Do you know why? It\u2019s because I\u2019m a super genius who doesn\u2019t need help from anyone. I don\u2019t need to care about stupid and foolish people who judge my skills based on the company I keep. Why should I care about standards or status? I only care about hanging out with people I have fun with.\u201dZich pointed his sword towards Drew.\u201cNot that someone like you would know. You only know how to use your friends to lift yourself up.\u201d\u201cYou are all talk.\u201d\u201cUsually, people say something like that to me when they are unable to understand my profound words. But if you can\u2019t even beat me in trash talk, what can you beat me in?\u201dDrew gritted his teeth.\u201cIf you are so confident in your skills, try showing them to me!\u201dTap!Drew began moving. He lowered his body and moved straight towards Zich. It was a simple movement, but Drew\u2019s whole body was surrounded by mana, so it had a tremendous amount of force.Bam!Drew rapidly stopped in front of Zich. The dirt underneath him made a loud \u2018crack\u2019 sound at his sudden stop. His joints creaked at the immense force of his movements. Then he transferred the force of this movement into his sword.\u2018I\u2019m not planning to kill him, but\u2014\u2019Drew sneered.\u2018I\u2019m going to cut off one of his arms!\u2019How dare this punk mock him. If they were not in the middle of a bustling street, Drew would have cut off Zich\u2019s neck a long time ago. That was the punishment for a person who mocked him.\u2018If he dies from blood loss, it\u2019s not going to be my fault.\u2019Drew was going to be merciful and cut off just one of Zich\u2019s arms, so if Zich died, it would not be his fault at all. Drew honestly thought he was being merciful as he moved his sword towards Zich\u2019s shoulder. Even though Drew was now very close to cutting one of Zich\u2019s shoulders, Zich made no reaction at all.\u2018He really was all talk. It\u2019s too late to react now.\u2019Drew put mana into his sword, and it became strong enough to cut a person\u2019s arm like it was a slice of meat.Tang!\u201cHuh?\u201dThe pathway of Drew\u2019s sword was disturbed.\u2018Did he just flick off my sword?\u201dWith just his thumb, Zich flicked off the side of Drew\u2019s sword. Drew could not even see Zich\u2019s movements, and it was even more disturbing that Zich was able to block his mana attack with just one finger.\u2018What is this\u2026\u2019Drew could not believe what was happening. His situation felt unreal, and he watched his body spin like he was an outsider to his own body.Punch!Drew lifted his chin up; he was suddenly able to see the sky. Then, he felt a floating sensation. From start to finish, he was unable to grasp the reality of his situation.\u2018What? What is happening?\u2019Even though Drew had experienced all sorts of things as an adventurer, he had never felt anything like this. But an inkling of suspicion began to enter his mind. He could not believe it.\u2018Am I getting beat up?\u2019It was hard to believe, but right now, reality was pressing down hard upon him.Bam!\u201cArghh!\u201dDrew rolled many times on the floor. He had no time to even cushion the force of his fall, so his whole body was completely sore. Moreover, his left cheek burned.Spit!Drew spit out stuff from his mouth. Two white substances dropped onto the floor.They were his teeth. He spit out more of his blood and put one hand on his cheek. In that short time period, his cheeks swelled up to a great size.\u201cW-wha is harpe\u2014\u201dHis pronunciation was off as the wind whistled through the missing holes in his mouth.\u201cHow is it? Isn\u2019t it exciting?\u201d Zich laughed and shook the fist that he used to hit Drew. \u201cGet up, you little shit. I wouldn\u2019t have even started if I was going to end this with one punch.\u201dDrew stood up quickly. If he had just stayed on the ground, he would have gotten attacked without being able to defend himself.\u201cWha kin of cheawt did yew use!\u201d Drew shouted at Zich. His pronunciation made his words sound funny, but Drew was completely serious.\u201cA cheat? Are you actually sick in the head for real? Ah, no wonder. I understand why you don\u2019t want to face reality right now.\u201dWithout even being able to properly resist, Drew got completely beaten up. Zich was leaps above Drew\u2019s skill level. But Drew\u2019s arrogant personality would not let him accept this.\u201cHave you never thought that you could lose because you only target guys weaker than you? I will change that mindset for you. In that sick head of yours, I will squeeze the reality that this world is filled with people way stronger than you. You don\u2019t need to pay me for this lesson. I will specially make it free for you!\u201dUnlike before, Zich was now the first to attack. His sword moved straight like a wild horse.Drew tried to block Zich\u2019s attack.Smash!\u201cArgh!\u201dZich did not use any special technique or movement, and he did not even move fast; he just used brute force. But this was enough to make Drew let out a cry of pain.Smash! Smash!Zich\u2019s sword came down on Drew like thunder. Even though it seemed like Zich was wielding his sword without much thought, his sword precisely attacked any gaps in Drew\u2019s defense. Drew frantically backed away and tried to block Zich\u2019s attacks. His hands felt like they would rip apart from blocking Zich\u2019s constant attacks, but if Drew lost focus for even a second, his sword would have dropped from his hands.\u201cYou have a gap here.\u201dKick!Zich kicked Drew\u2019s ankle.\u201cUgh!\u201dFalter!When Drew was about to change his center of gravity, Zich landed another attack. Drew lost his sense of balance and faltered. Zich used this to his advantage by quickly landing another attack on Drew with his knees.Slam!\u201cUrgh!\u201dZich\u2019s knees landed directly on Drew\u2019s celiac plexus, which was located in the middle of his abdomen. It was a sensitive area, and Drew could not breathe. But that was not the only hit that Drew received.Break!An ominous sound rang through Drew\u2019s heart, and an awful pain came flooding into his body.Crash!Drew didn\u2019t roll on the ground like he did last time. He was smashed into the ground like a piece of trash.\u201cUgh! Aghh!\u201dDrew clutched his heart and cried out in pain. He could not even breathe.\u201cHmmm, from my judgment, I think two of your ribs are broken.\u201dZich had a lot of experience breaking bones. In a way, he might have more experience breaking bones than eating a meal. By just looking, Zich could tell how severe Drew\u2019s injuries were.\u201cUgh!\u201dDrew used his sword like a staff to get up. It was hard to stand from all the pain he was going through.\u201cCat got your tongue? Don\u2019t you have to keep insulting a weak ass like me? Why, you are an amazing adventurer who can even hunt down a full-grown troll.\u201dZick mocked Drew, but Drew was in no condition to reply.\u201cIt\u2019s no fun now that you are quiet.\u201dZich swung his sword and came closer to Drew. His movements were like a cat playing around with his catch.\u201cBy the way, your skills suck ass. I thought you might have some skills because you were so arrogant, but you are way below my expectations. If my opponent is this weak, there\u2019s no fun in crushing them.\u201dDrew still didn\u2019t reply. He was barely able to breathe and stand while leaning his whole body onto his sword.\u201cWell, whatever. I also didn\u2019t expect this to be a serious competition.\u201dZich stopped right in front of Drew.\u201cJust be destroyed like this.\u201d\u201cI wonv giv up!\u201dDrew managed to lift his head. The concept of giving up was nonexistent in his expression. Murderous rage, stubbornness, and pain were all complicatedly intertwined in his face.\u201cDiew!\u201dDrew reached out his hand while crying out. Mana was moving strangely around his hand, and a sound resembling a bird\u2019s cry rang out.\u2018He fell into my trap!\u2019This was Drew\u2019s secret weapon. As an adventurer who was exposed to all kinds of danger, it was common for adventurers to prepare some kind of hidden weapon to use when their life was in danger. His secret weapon was an artifact that he happened to find in a dungeon. It saved his life many times before and completely changed the situation around when he was about to lose. With this artifact, Drew thought he could get Zich on his knees as Zich did to him multiple times in this fight. He thought this until\u2026He saw that there was not a single scratch on Zich\u2019s body.\u201cW-wha\u2026!\u201dDrew mumbled while crying out in pain. Zich moved his thumb and middle finger. There was a small arrow between his fingers.\u201cI can predict what guys like you would do. Did you really think that a hidden attack will work against me?\u201dZich lowered his guard to draw out Drew\u2019s attack. It was a tactic he frequently used before he regressed, and he had also used it against Zenard.\u2018But I was really about to die during that time, though.\u2019Anyways, pretending to die, pretending that an attack worked\u2014all those attacks didn\u2019t work against Zich.\u2018But I\u2019m sure this tactic worked very well for him many times.\u2019Just by seeing Drew\u2019s shell-shocked face, Zich could tell that Drew didn\u2019t understand why his plan failed. But Zich had no desire to teach him why he failed; he focused all his attention on the small arrow in his hand. The arrow was about 1/3 smaller than an ordinary arrow, but the speed and sharpness of the arrow made it very suitable for a hidden attack.\u201cHickk!\u201dDrew managed to come back to reality and pulled out his arm again. Zich lightly kicked away that arm.Whish!Another arrow flew on top of Zich\u2019s head. Zich kicked Drew on the chest and when Drew was down, Zich stepped on his arms.\u201cAghhhhh!\u201dDrew screamed out in pain from falling down, and his body shook as Zich pressed down on his arm.\u201cIs it an artifact?\u201dZich flipped open Drew\u2019s sleeve with his foot. Between Drew\u2019s wrist and the middle of his arm, there was a thin bracelet.\u201cIt looks like an artifact that stores small arrows and lets one out whenever you want.\u201dZich stared at the arrow.\u201cThere\u2019s even poison in this.\u201dOn the green tip of the arrow, there was a small amount of mana coming off it. Zich was knowledgeable about tools like this because many different types of people had tried to assassinate him in his past life.\u2018W-what kind of dude is this\u2026!\u2019It was then that Drew finally realized he had picked on the wrong person. He realized that the person in front of him was impossible to defeat with his current level of strength.\u201cWhat are you going to do now that your secret weapon has been found out? There are some super cautious guys who prepare two or three hidden weapons, but you don\u2019t seem to be that type. Oh? Does that mean you are completely defenseless now?\u201d\u201cAgh!\u201dDrew wielded his sword by instinct, but he was not in the position to instill his strength into it. Moreover, the pain in his chest prevented him from making a proper attack.Tap!As if his sword was like the arrow, Zich grabbed the sword with his bare hands.\u201cAh!\u201dDrew cried out, seeing that his last attempt was completely futile against Zich\u2019s strength.Whish!Zich took the sword from Drew and threw it to the side.\u201cDo you have more?\u201dZich urged Drew to keep on fighting. Compared to Zich\u2019s relaxed and carefree posture, Drew\u2019s eyes were drowning in darkness.\u201cI guess it\u2019s all over.\u201dZich pulled out all the teeth and claws of his prey. The only thing left for him to do was to end its life and disassemble the body.Zich began to move.\u201cS-spare me\u2026!\u201dDrew began to beg for his life; no trace of his former arrogance could be found.\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not going to kill you.\u201dZich laughed. To Drew\u2019s shock, Zich\u2019s face at that moment was akin to a saint reassuring his patient. It was so peaceful and soft that even Drew began to grow hopeful.But what Zich said soon after shattered his hope. \u201cI\u2019m going to return back to you exactly what you did to Sam. What do you mean by \u2018sparing your life\u2019? I\u2019m not going to do such a horrible thing as killing you.\u201dThud!Zich pressed his feet down on Drew\u2019s chest and exerted pressure into it. Drew screamed out in pain, but Zich didn\u2019t move an inch.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we start with four shattered ribs?\u201dDrew\u2019s screams rang in front of the exterminator\u2019s building for a very long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt as if he had just gotten out of a long tunnel, and he felt dizzy. But paradoxically, his body felt normal.\u201cHe came back to his senses.\u201dHe heard a familiar voice.\u201c\u2026Zich?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s your great friend Zich.\u201dSam got up. He was in his house. As if many people lived in it, his house was filled with multiple pieces of furniture and daily necessities, but somehow it didn\u2019t look very hospitable.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201dHe shook his head.\u201cYou went to Drew to settle a complaint and got totally beaten up.\u201dDrew. He remembered now. After hearing that Snoc got conned, he went to complain and got beaten up until he thought he was going to die.Twitch!Recalling the trauma, Sam\u2019s body trembled. There were times when he got into a fight while doing rough mining work, but that attack had been on another level. A person who killed living creatures for a job had used violence against him without a care for his life.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dAs if he caught what Sam was thinking, Zich said, \u201cI completely avenged you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Avenge?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I say this to you before? If you die an unjust death, I will avenge you.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t die though?\u201d\u201cYou were beaten up until you were a foot away from death\u2019s door. I\u2019ll count it as the same thing.\u201dAt this point, Zich seemed to do whatever he felt like doing. Sam let out a burst of laughter.\u201cHow did you avenge me?\u201d\u201cI just returned everything back to him.\u201d\u201cReturn?\u201d\u201cThe injuries you sustained. I inflicted the same, exact wounds he gave you- from fractures to small scratches.\u201dSam couldn\u2019t close his mouth. Although he had fainted, he knew that his wounds had been severe.\u201cIs that person still alive?\u201d\u201cNot sure. After I beat him up, I stopped paying attention to him. It\u2019s his problem if he dies there or not. But I don\u2019t think he will die since the guy from the Monster Exterminator Building was watching. He probably got some aid. Well, but\u2026\u201dZich smiled.\u201cEven if he is still alive, he won\u2019t be able to go for anybody again. Since I completely crushed his mind.\u201d\u201cI-I see.\u201dSam didn\u2019t know what Zich meant by \u2018crushing a person\u2019s mind,\u2019 but he didn\u2019t dare to ask. The conversation ended like that. Truthfully, Sam didn\u2019t want to hear more about the man who beat him up. A part of him felt relieved, hearing that the guy became a mess like him, but another part of him felt chills imagining what Zich did to Drew.\u201cHow much time has passed since then?\u201d\u201cTwo days.\u201d\u201cAll those injuries healed in just two days? Actually, I think my body feels better than usual?\u201d\u201cI used potions.\u201dSam had heard about potions before, but he\u2019d never seen one in real life. Although he made a good wage as a miner, it wasn\u2019t enough to buy a potion.\u201cIsn\u2019t that expensive?\u201d\u201cIt is a bit pricey, but it\u2019s not unaffordable. I can earn as much money as I want anytime anyways.\u201d\u201c\u2026Adventurers are amazing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not adventurers who are amazing. I am just amazing.\u201dIt was as if Zich\u2019s face was painted in metal; if his face was really painted with gold, it would have been enough to buy a castle.\u201cThe price for the potion\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it. I don\u2019t want to take money from a poor friend.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then, I will buy you a drink later.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t refuse that.\u201dIt was the same as repaying gold with sand, but Sam accepted his friend\u2019s consideration with gratitude and his heart stirred with emotions. Although Zich was cold to others, it seemed as if Zich really thought of him as a friend.Then Zich took out things from a box, which changed the atmosphere.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fair compensation that I got from Drew: medical bills, rewards, nuisance expenses, and so on.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dSam shouted in surprise, but while smirking, Zich opened the box like a gangster checking all the money he collected.\u201cAh, now that I think about it, you went to Drew to complain about the money he took from Snoc, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dOf course, Sam thought about complaining directly to Drew, but he gave up on that. After encountering him once, Sam knew that common logic didn\u2019t work on Drew.\u201cLet me see.\u201dZich opened the box\u2019s lid, and items poured out. Sam stared at the goods that piled up on the floor next to his bed. He couldn\u2019t believe that gold coins were falling from the air.\u201cLet me see, how much did I take?\u201d\u201c\u2026What is that?\u201dSam asked about the box first.\u201cIt\u2019s an artifact. It lets you store goods regardless of their volume or weight. There\u2019s a limit, but it\u2019s a handy item.\u201dZich made a refreshing smile.\u201cIt was from that guy. I took it as compensation for the many things he did.\u201d\u201cThen, these gold coins\u2026\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re also his.\u201dSam couldn\u2019t find the right words to say.\u201cWell, it\u2019s yours now. That guy was pretty rich. With this, you can easily pay for the price of the potions, but of course, I have to share it with you and Snoc who suffered the damages.\u201dZich gripped one of the gold coins and put it in front of Sam.\u201cSo, how much do you want for compensation?\u201d\u201cAh, no. I\u2019m fine.\u201dEven though he had been one-sidedly beaten up by Drew, Sam refused the immense pile of wealth in front of him instinctively. The large sum of money made him feel uncomfortable rather than greedy, and Zich didn\u2019t continue to press the matter.\u201cReally? Okay. I guess people will be surprised if so much money gets forced in front of them so suddenly. But if you change your mind, tell me anytime. The time limit is until I leave this city.\u201dZich placed the gold coins back into the box, and the mountain-pile of gold coins disappeared instantly.\u201cTell me the amount Drew stole from Snoc so I can evenly distribute the sum. I can only decide how much to take after I know how much to leave you and Snoc.\u201d\u201cDid you also suffer any losses?\u201dZich told Sam that the money was a form of compensation. If Zich took some of the capital, it meant that he also suffered a loss.\u201cOf course.\u201dZich nodded without hesitation.\u201cOn top of the stress he gave me for attacking my friend, he forced me to move and even insulted me. It won\u2019t be enough even if I sell him as a slave and get more money. Considering how I ended the matter with so little, I am so generous.\u201dIt sounded like the calculations of some back-alleyway gangster. Sam studied Zich\u2019s face, and he wondered if Zich felt any sense of guilt or embarrassment from his words.\u2018It doesn\u2019t seem like that at all.\u2019Zich\u2019s face was composed.To not hurt Zich\u2019s feelings, Sam asked carefully,,\u201cUm, didn\u2019t you say that you would live a kind life? Is it ok for you to do something like stealing?\u201d\u201cWhy do you say stealing? I keep telling you that all I did was receive fair compensation. It doesn\u2019t affect my resolution to live a kind life, at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dIn the end, Sam followed the path that Hans had taken a few days ago. He reaffirmed his beliefs that Zich\u2019s train of thought was completely out of common way of thinking and gave up on trying to understand Zich.* * *Drew walked inside a mountain. He looked completely fine even though Zich had left him half-dead not so long ago. It was thanks to the priest, who Paul Chenu called. However, no matter how well the priest healed him, he wasn\u2019t the same as before.First of all, he didn\u2019t have any money. Zich took all the money and items he had as \u2018fair compensation.\u2019 Thus, he didn\u2019t even have the money to pay for his medical bills and had to borrow money by using his artifact. If Zich hadn\u2019t thought that the goods inside his artifact were enough for his compensation, Drew wouldn\u2019t even have had the money to cure himself.For that reason, he had to go out to catch monsters as soon as his wounds were healed. But there was a more serious matter.\u201cUrgh!\u201dDrew swallowed his saliva back down. His heart ached. His wounds were already all healed, but he sometimes felt pain for no reason. The cause was probably psychological, and he knew when these side-effects first started.\u201cThat bastard\u2026!\u201dRage and hate flared up, but simultaneously, fear and despair filled his heart. Zich had inflicted the same wounds on Drew as Drew did to Sam without a trace of discomfort on his face. Even Drew was aware that he was a person without any sense of humanity, but he thought Zich far exceeded him in that area. Drew was sure Zich didn\u2019t feel any guilt or joy when inflicting wounds on a person.\u2018It was just a job for him.\u2019In short, Zich didn\u2019t look at him as a human or even a living creature.\u2018Damn it! Stop! Stop it!\u2019His legs trembled out of control, and he slammed his fists on them. The only thing that came back to him was more pain and bruise marks. He couldn\u2019t stop his legs from trembling. Drew knew what this side-effect was. It was what people who battled monsters or fought other countries\u2019 wars suffered through. It was what Drew had mocked as, \u2018Coward Reader.\u2019 But now, he was facing the condition.Drew also knew the way to stop this side-effect: removing the cause of the trauma. But as soon as he thought this, his heart fell.\u2018Fighting\u2026with that guy\u2026again?\u2019Zich\u2019s face, his slimy smile, and his stern pupils\u2014as soon as they popped into Drew\u2019s head, all the strength in his legs left him.Drop!He collapsed to the ground. Thankfully, he was in the mountains, and no one saw him. However, he didn\u2019t feel relieved; more than embarrassment, fear overcame him.\u2018I-It\u2019s impossible.\u2019He was just a small fry who was a bit strong. The thought of facing Zich again after overcoming his fears pained his heart.\u201cOh, dear! Your condition is worse than I expected.\u201dHe suddenly heard a voice he disliked and turned his head.When did he approach me? A figure covered from head to toe in a black robe stood in front of him.\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long enough for me to say\u2026 it\u2019s been a while.\u201dIt was a kind and warm tone, but Drew didn\u2019t feel an ounce of sincerity in the man\u2019s words. It was the robed man who had struck a strange deal with him recently. The man met eyes with Drew and then crouched his knees on the ground to be on the same level with Drew. He made the motions as if he was a parent making a point to his children. However, the man\u2019s face, which was covered by the robe\u2019s darkness, gave Drew chills.\u201cWhat did you come here for?\u201d\u201cI have another commission that I want you to take care of.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? I will take it if it\u2019s decent.\u201dThe man gave Drew a fortune for merely helping Snoc activate his mana and making him walk through the mine until he met a mole. For Drew who seriously lacked money, the offer couldn\u2019t have been more attractive. However, the robed figure glanced up and down at him like the man was assessing Drew.\u201cWill you be able to do it? I heard you were badly beaten.\u201d\u201cI am fine enough to take a commission.\u201d\u201cWhat if you have to clash with the man who made you like this again?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026!\u201dDrew\u2019s face became dead-pale, and his hands shook.\u2018It\u2019s hopeless.\u2019The man shook his head.\u2018I had a hunch, but this is beyond my expectations. I didn\u2019t think he would be broken down to this extent.\u2019The man thought Drew\u2019s usefulness had gone down to zero.\u201cHmm.\u201dThe man twitched his nose in dissatisfaction and straightened his knee. Drew saw that the man was going to take back his offer, so he shouted urgently, \u201cI-I can handle it! I was going to get my revenge on that guy any\u2014!\u201d\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d the man answered. Any trace of politeness disappeared from his speech, and his tone was dry. Drew froze at the man\u2019s sudden change.Push!A blade pierced Drew\u2019s throat.\u201cI don\u2019t need you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The robed man wiped the blood away from his sword and placed it back into its sheath again.\u2018The plan is ruined.\u2019He glanced at Drew\u2019s corpse. A look of annoyance flashed across his eyes, but the man\u2019s personal mission superseded his emotions.\u2018Do I have to move onto the next plan? No, this situation means that all possible routes have changed. Even if I don\u2019t use Drew, there\u2019s a high chance that the plan will fail.\u2019In a way, he already knew the answer.\u2018It can\u2019t be helped. I have to force out the result.\u2019It wasn\u2019t what his master wanted, but it was the only way to obtain a similar result.\u2018I need to supplement some more personnel. I thought it would be fine by myself, but it seems like I\u2019ll have to resort to the last measure.\u2019This hurt the man\u2019s pride. The importance and level of difficulty of this place and mission were on the low side. That was why he was the only one who had been placed in charge of the mission; and from the first place, the man\u2019s skills and status were not suitable for a place like this. He had simply taken the job in his free time, thinking of it as a sort of a mini-vacation. However, his plans were ruined now.\u2018I have to show some achievements to protect my pride. And\u2026\u2019There was an even more important matter.\u2018I have to find out the unknown variable.\u2019Everything had been running smoothly until now; he had to find out the cause of the change. It was probably the unknown variable.\u2018I have to investigate who that guy is and then kill him!\u2019A chilly pair of eyes glittered inside the robe.* * *As if Snoc\u2019s house was mimicking its owner\u2019s feelings, it exuded a gloomy atmosphere. The wooden entrance hadn\u2019t opened since Drew abandoned Snoc. It was the same whether his accomplices visited him or not.Although it was late, a single candle wasn\u2019t lit up, and the inside of the house was dark. Snoc lied on his bed and stared at the ceiling absentmindedly. Clothes were on the floor in a mess, and untidy dishes littered the table. Snoc didn\u2019t move at all, enough to make one wonder if he was actually dead. Only his blinking eyes and heaving chest hinted that he was still alive.Growl!Even though he barely moved and used the bare minimum energy, his digestive system continued to work. Without considering its owner\u2019s feelings, Snoc\u2019s stomach cried out to Snoc to throw some food inside it.\u201c\u2026Should I eat something?\u201dEven though he cut off all outside contact and shut himself in his house, Snoc didn\u2019t intend to die. He grasped his stomach and got up. As if he was going through a lot of inner distress, his eyes were sunken. He got off his bed and put on his shoes.Koo! Koo!A small being approached Snoc\u2019s legs and cried while tapping his feet.\u201cAre you hungry too?\u201dIt was the mole who he met at the mine some days ago. He met the animal only recently, but the mole was basically a family member for him. Snoc liked the mole upon meeting him. As if they were connected by a thread of destiny, he felt a sense of affinity towards the mole by instinct. In addition, after Drew betrayed him, the mole was the only one he could share feelings with. It was very strange, but Snoc felt like he could give up his life for this mole he met just a couple of days ago.\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s eat. We will only be able to live if we eat.\u201dHe picked up the mole and hugged it. As if he was used to this, the mole burrowed into Snoc\u2019s chest.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Nowem.\u201dWhile calling the name he gave the mole, Snoc went to where the cupboard was. He lit up a candle and scavenged the area for food.\u201c\u2026There\u2019s nothing to eat.\u201dThe only thing left was a dry piece of bread.\u2018I should go out to buy food when the day gets brighter.\u2019Although Drew stole most of his money, he still had enough money to eat for the day; but whenever he thought of this, he felt gloomy. Snoc took out a slice of bread and ripped it apart. Then, he placed a bread piece in front of Nowem\u2019s nose.Snort! Snort!Nowem sniffed the bread piece.Grab!Nowem opened his small mouth as wide as he could and bit the piece of bread into smaller pieces. He looked adorable, chewing with his mouth full of bread. Snoc placed the rest of the bread into his mouth. The dry bread sucked all the moisture out of his mouth, and he forcefully chewed the crumbly, untasty bread. After he gulped down the rough bread, he felt like his empty stomach became a bit fuller.The air felt stuffy and humid, so Snoc opened the window. A faint moonlight seeped into the room. The full moon hung in the sky today and spread its peculiar, dream-like atmosphere. It felt like the moon was comforting his disturbed mind. Snoc placed his elbow on the windowsill and stared at the moon.\u2018Huh?\u2019A dark shadow cast under the moonlight.\u2018What?\u2019Was he imagining it? Snoc rubbed his eyes and stood closer to the window. Someone was there. Under the moonlight, a man who exuded the same mood as a grim reaper stood a short distance away from Snoc\u2019s house and stared at him through the window. And he wasn\u2019t the only one\u2014Snoc could see four figures.They all wore dark robes, so it was difficult to separate them from the darkness. It was impossible to decipher their age or gender and made them a terrifying sight to behold. Snoc quickly closed the window and locked it.\u2018What was that?\u2019Late in the night, mysterious figures were ominously staring into his house. Snoc immediately locked all the windows in his house and checked the lock on his door. Then he took a seat next to the bed while hugging Nowem. As soon as he heard someone barge into his place, Snoc planned to hide under his bed. He held his breath and perked his ears in case somebody forced the door open.\u2018Did I imagine it?\u2019He didn\u2019t hear the door open or any other sound. Maybe he imagined the scene in his tired state. Or maybe he misunderstood a group of people who had no interest in him but were moving for some other reason. Snoc began to scorn himself for being such a coward. Then, he lifted his head and saw a dark shadow in front of him.* * *Even though it was late, a large fire crackled in Zich and Hans\u2019 room. Zich sat in front of the only table in the room, counting coins from the mountain of gold coins in front of him. At a glance, he looked like a greedy merchant who had earned a lot of money and was now internally crying out in happiness. But for that to be the case, his expression looked too indifferent.Clink!The last pillar of ten coins stood on the table.\u2018That bastard sure earned a lot.\u201dZich\u2019s fingers thumped the neat layers of gold pillars. At his touch, the pillars slanted and collapsed. Their clinking sounds were enough to satisfy a hungry soul.Hans watched the scene from his bed. Zich told him that he could sleep earlier, but Hans couldn\u2019t sleep from the clinking noises. It was also his first time seeing so many gold coins glittering before him. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of them.Then, Zich prepared a bag and poured a set amount of gold coins into it.\u201cThis is the amount that Drew stole from Snoc. If I include his compensation for mental damage, this will probably be enough. I also separated the amount Sam might ask me for compensation.\u201dAfter taking some coins out, Zich stared at the rest of the gold coins.\u201cThis is mine.\u201dThe remaining amount of coins was a substantial amount.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dIt was a conditioned reflex now. When Zich called him, Hans answered without a moment of hesitation.\u201cTake this.\u201dZich carelessly threw a handful of coins at him, and gold coins rained over the bed Hans was sitting on.\u201c\u2026What is this?\u201d\u201cUse it however you like. You can buy something to eat, buy some equipment, or even save it for the future.\u201dHans stared at the pile of gold coins. He didn\u2019t expect to get a share at all, and this wasn\u2019t even a small amount. It was an amount he had never possessed before.\u201cC-Can I really take it?\u201d\u201cWhat? Do you not need it?\u201d\u201cN-No. That\u2019s not it\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, take it.\u201dHans stared down at the pile of gold coins. On top of the gold coins, there was a pouch. It was what Zich threw so that Hans could put his gold coins inside.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to save\u2026 what if we don\u2019t have enough traveling expenses, sir?\u201dHans tried to put on some airs since it was such a large amount.\u201cIf I combine the amount I packed before traveling, the reward I received from Karuwiman, and the money I got from beating up this guy who didn\u2019t know his place, we won\u2019t have to worry about money for a while. And even if that money drops low, there are a lot of places where we can get money from.\u201dNow that Hans thought of it, Zich never seemed to save money. Although Zich said he was saving the expensive potions, he also used them unsparingly when he needed them. If Hans thought back on how Zich used up all his three potions just because his friend was beaten up badly, Zich almost seemed wasteful.\u2018Does he have something to back him up?\u2019Hans thought this but quickly erased it from his mind.\u2018It\u2019s useless to think about it.\u2019By now, he knew that common logic didn\u2019t work on Zich. Hans placed the gold coins into the pouch and sealed its opening tightly. Then, he pushed it into a deep corner of his luggage.\u201cThen, should I get going?\u201dZich got up from his chair and stretched. Then, he moved to blow out the candles.\u201c\u2026What is it?\u201dZich turned his head and opened the window.\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s noisy outside.\u201dHe saw a crowd of figures running on top of rooftops under the yellow moon. They looked clearly suspicious looked like bad guys.\u2018Should I intervene?\u2019It could be a chance for Zich to do a kind act. He was pondering for a moment when he saw that one of the group members was carrying a person.\u2018Isn\u2019t that Snoc? Why is he there?\u2019Zich could tell that they were not close friends of Snoc right away. It was apparent that Snoc was mixed up in some new trouble.\u2018He is such an unlucky guy. It hasn\u2019t even been long since his incident with Drew.\u2019\u201cI am going out for a while.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201dZich left with those words and jumped right out the window.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He chased after the cloaked figures on the rooftops. It was not hard to catch up to them since they had to carry Snoc and his weight dragged them down.When Zich was close to them, he shouted, \u201cHey! Why don\u2019t we try talking for a bit? I have some unfinished business with that luggage you are carrying!\u201dJudging by their attitudes and based on his past experience, Zich could tell that they were doing something very suspicious. However, he wanted to try talking to them first as Lubella had advised him to do.Despite Zich\u2019s goodwill, the cloaked figures took out their weapons.Clang!There was no need for Zich to pull out his sword. He intercepted a dagger in mid-air by pushing the air between them. The dagger spun around in a circle and Zich caught it while it was still spinning.\u201cYou dropped this!\u201dZich threw the dagger back at them after he put some mana into it. The strengthened dagger flew towards them with enormous speed.\u201cUgh!\u201dThe figure at the very back got hit by the dagger. The person let out a small scream and went rolling down the roof. The rest of the figures stopped moving and jumped down into the alleyway.\u2018Instead of attacking, they should have run in the first place.\u2019Zich followed them down. In the dark alleyway, Zich and the cloaked figures faced each other.Then he put his hands on his hips and asked, \u201cWho are you guys?\u201dBut no one replied. A person that seemed like a leader stepped forward. Unbeknownst to Zich, he was the man who killed Drew earlier that day. The man kicked his dead comrade a few times, and the body flipped over. There was a dagger in the corpse\u2019s neck.\u2018They don\u2019t seem like a tight-knit organization.\u2019Zich thought as he saw the man kick the body of one of his dead comrades. The man glared at Zich with murderous intent, and Zich replied back with a shrug.\u201cYour comrades gave me a surprise present. I was so touched I wanted to give something back to them. I regret my actions. I didn\u2019t know they would be so touched that they would fall dead.\u201d\u201cKill him.\u201dWith the man\u2019s command, the rest of the figures began taking out their daggers.\u201cBy your movements, it seems like you are all assassins. What business would an assassin have with a miner? This man you kidnapped is pure to the point of being stupid, so I doubt he caused anyone harm too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBastards. Can\u2019t you even reply?\u201dPunch!A harsh sound rang out from one of them. Zich\u2019s punch landed on one of the assassins who came straight at him. As if someone pulled him from behind, the assassin\u2019s body flew backwards and his dagger fell to the floor.\u201cAs expected of assassins. You are excellent at assessing the situation.\u201dAlthough they tried to attack him, the assassins now kept a safe distance from him. They all noticed that Zich was extremely skilled at fighting.\u201cDon\u2019t assassins normally take care of the bodies and quickly draw back? But none of you guys are doing that.\u201dZich laughed.\u201cAll of you are not ordinary assassins, right? What organization are you part of?\u201dBoom!Suddenly, a fireball exploded on top of Zich. It was magic. To a person who was expecting only assassin techniques, this attack would have definitely caught them off guard.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dSmash!Zich smashed the fireball with his hands as if he was swatting a mosquito. The fireball flashed on the ground for a bit and then died out.The assassins were shocked by the ease in which Zich handled the fireball.\u201cWait, assassins that know how to do magic? It\u2019s not as if people like that don\u2019t exist, but they\u2019re definitely not as common as a passing rock. Moreover, none of you guys said an incantation; there\u2019s a very low chance that someone with such a high level of magic skill would be an assassin.\u201dZich began narrowing his choices down and continued with surprise in his voice, \u201cIs one of you using an artifact? And an artifact that can do strong magic attacks like this?\u201dArtifacts were rare, and ones that could do strong magic attacks like this were rarer. But Zich was not surprised by the artifact itself. Before he regressed, he had seen much more precious and stronger artifacts than the one that the assassins used. Yet, Zich was surprised for one reason\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why are all of you using such a high-level artifact to kidnap a mere miner?\u201dThe assassins were of a way too high caliber for the purpose of kidnapping, torturing, or even killing one miner like Snoc. Zich began to grow suspicious, but he thought he had to decide quickly.\u201cWell, whatever. I\u2019m going to capture you guys and beat all of you up until I get some answers.\u201dSwish!Zich pulled out his sword. The sharpness of his sword glinted in the light. The man who seemed like the leader stared at Zich\u2019s sword for a few moments and then opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026Three of you stay. The rest of you follow the plan.\u201dThe three figures nearest to Zich moved towards him. The leader left the three of them behind and began climbing on the roof with the rest of his other underlings.\u201cI just want to talk for a bit. It\u2019s so dang hard to get even one conversation.\u201dIt was basic manners to at least pretend to listen if Zich was asking this many times.\u2018Well, I guess it\u2019s laughable to expect manners from assassins.\u2019Zich stared at the group that was moving along and then moved his attention back to the three in front of him.\u201cI guess the plan is for the three of you to risk your lives and make time for the rest of them to escape but\u2026\u201dZich lightly moved his sword a few times. He lowered his body and moved his center of gravity to the front.\u201cDo you think that will be possible?\u201dBang!Zich condensed his strength inside his body so that a ripple came out from him. The three assassins moved towards him.Whish!Zich sharply wielded his sword. One assassin tried to block Zich\u2019s attack with a dagger. The other two tried to attack his sides. Their blue daggers shook like poisonous snakes\u2014it was a pretty good collaborative effort.If Zich didn\u2019t have to get Snoc back, he might have spent some time playing with them. But now was not the time for that.Zing.Mana began to seep into Zich\u2019s sword. He instilled mana into the sword until it reached the very tip of his sword.Ziiing!The mana around his sword turned around like a chainsaw. The cutting force of his sword right now was several times greater than usual.Zing! Zing! Zing! Zing!In a short amount of time, four cutting sounds could be heard. The first cut broke through the dagger and its owner. Then, the next cut reached a little further and broke through the second dagger next to him and its owner.Splash!Blood poured out like rain. The upper and lower bodies of the two assassins collapsed onto the ground in succession. The surrounding area became a puddle of blood.Zich evaded the third assassin\u2019s attack easily and bent down towards one of the corpses. The last assassin tried to create as much distance from Zich as possible.\u201cW-What\u2026!\u201dHe was stunned. Even though he was taught to maintain his calm at all times, the assassin was shocked that two of his comrades were cut up like pieces of cheese in a matter of seconds. However, Zich frowned while looking down at his sword.\u2018They are surprisingly resilient.\u2019All three of the assassins\u2019 skills and weapons were extraordinary. Even though a head-to-head competition was not an assassin\u2019s forte, they were all very skilled at fighting. Zich wondered where they all came from.\u201cWait a minute.\u201dZich tapped his head with his thumb. He came to this town because of an impending disaster. There was a strong possibility that these assassins and the disaster were connected somehow.\u201cAre all of you related to the \u2018Tyrant of the Earth, Nowem\u2019?\u201dTyrant of the Earth, Nowem.He was one of the Demon People that appeared during this time. As his name implied, he used the earth\u2019s strength, and he made his first appearance in Suol. As soon as he appeared, he demolished Suol and settled down in the Iruce Mine. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t move out of this mine at all, so his danger level was low.The Kingdom had desperately tried to recapture the Iruce Mine after Nowem made it his home. The iron ores in the Iruce Mine were an extremely significant strategic resource. However, all the soldiers that were dispatched to Suol never came back alive. Nowem\u2019s hidden strength inside the mine was too enormous.As the Kingdom continued its efforts to recapture the Iruce Mine, it realized Nowem\u2019s true strength and how powerful he could be in his home ground.\u2018The Kingdom eventually collapsed from that.\u2019The resources the Kingdom lost from Suol\u2019s destruction eventually led to its doom. Moreover, all the soldiers and armies lost from trying to recapture the Iruce Mine further deteriorated the Kingdom and hastened its downfall.Even though there were a lot of Demon People during this time (to the extent that this period would be called the \u2018Demon People Period\u2019), it was rare for a Demon Person to destroy a whole Kingdom. As a Demon Person that brought ruin to a Kingdom, Nowem gained much notoriety as a powerful being.\u2018It\u2019s reasonable to think that these assassins have something to do with the rise of the Demon People\u2026since it\u2019s around this time that Demon People first began appearing.\u2019Zich\u2019s prediction was confirmed as he saw that the last standing assassin looked shocked by his words.Moreover, the assassin raised his voice and shouted, \u201c\u2026How do you know that!\u201d\u201cHey, should we exchange information or something? If you tell me what you know, I\u2019ll teach you how I was able to learn this information.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI knew it.\u201dZich clicked his tongue as he saw the assassin raise his dagger at him.\u2018I guess it\u2019ll be better for me to go after those guys that kidnapped Snoc. I can get as much information as I want from them after all.\u2019Moreover, there was the leader with the most information in that group.Tap!Zich moved his feet. He transferred his mana to the very tip of his sword again. He increased the flow of mana around his sword. As Zich ran straight towards the assassin, the assassin also ran towards Zich. Compared to Zich\u2019s mana-filled sword, the assassin\u2019s dagger looked pitiful.The distance between the assassin and Zich was now very small. From this distance, Zich was able to see the assassin\u2019s eyes, which had been hidden inside his cloak.\u2018He\u2019s hiding something.\u2019The assassin looked as if he had a secret backup plan. There was a certain kind of resolve and determination in his movement.Slide.The assassin reached his free hand into the cloak. But before the assassin could fully take the possession out, Zich moved his sword to kill the assassin. However, Zich was too late.The mana flow around them became violent. The assassin\u2019s cloak began to flutter and expand.Boom!There was an explosion. The area the bomb targeted was small, but the bomb\u2019s destructive force was massive. If a person happened to receive a direct hit, they would have disintegrated in a second.After a few moments, the explosion began to die down. The light and sound of the explosion began to fade and only a soft glimmer of light remained. From this light, Zich began to appear in clear view. Only some parts of his clothes were ripped. He brushed the dust off his clothes and spit on the floor in distaste.\u2018As expected of assassins that barely show any regard to their own life, they self-destruct.\u2019Zich clicked his tongue as he saw that there was not even a trace of the assassin\u2019s body left. It was sad that the assassin\u2019s self-destruction only ripped Zich\u2019s clothes a bit.\u2018But even their self-destruction technique is high level.\u2019It took a great level of skill to self-destruct like the assassin; you would have to spin your mana like a whirlpool until it exploded. But it seemed as if the assassin used an artifact to self-destruct since they reached inside their cloak a moment before they exploded. On the other hand, this also meant that the people behind them were powerful enough to hand out two high-level artifacts like it was almost nothing.\u2018I have to find out who\u2019s behind all this.\u2019Zich began chasing after the rest of the assassins.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe assassins who carried Snoc continued to move. They no longer had a carefree attitude, because Zich was pressuring them. They continued to run towards their destination: the Iruce mine. Then, with the ropes they prepared in advance, they easily climbed over the mine\u2019s walls.\u201cThe rest of you stay here. Don\u2019t let anyone in. If your opponent is too strong, sacrifice your lives to make more time for me.\u201d The leader of the assassin team said and turned away.The rest of the assassins nodded, and they gave Snoc to him. The man left and headed deep into the mine, while the assassins hid in the shadows and waited for trespassers to come. The inside of the mine was as black as ink, and not even a sliver of moonlight seeped through it. But there was no hesitation in the man\u2019s footsteps. He passed through multiple pathways with ease and reached the area of the mine that had been sealed off. The area had been sealed off due to a collapse, and as expected, huge stones blocked the entrance.The man put down Snoc, almost as if he was throwing a piece of luggage. Unable to judge the situation he was in, Snoc flinched and put his hand on his back. He was in great pain.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201d Snoc let out a painful cry and opened his eyes. \u201cT-this is\u2026\u201dEven though there was only darkness, Snoc knew where he was. He felt this kind of stuffy and dreary atmosphere every day.\u2018The mines?\u2019Why was he in a mining area? Snoc tried to recall.\u2018I was at home about to eat bread, and then when I looked out the window\u2026!\u2019A shiver ran down his back. Unidentified figures invaded his home, and the last thing he remembered were forceful hands that pulled him.\u2018Am I being kidnapped?\u2019Snoc quickly got up. Fortunately, his body was just sore in some places, and he was not tied up. Snoc checked his body to make sure nothing was broken, and then he felt something drop from his body.Koo!He heard a small squeal, and Snoc\u2019s expression brightened up.\u201cNowem!\u201dIt was definitely the sound of his family. Snoc tried to make his way towards the sound. Thankfully, he was able to quickly find Nowem.Koo! Koo!Nowem began to rub his face on Snoc\u2019s hands. Snoc hugged Nowem tightly and felt the soft warmth of Nowem\u2019s body. Some of Snoc\u2019s anxiety went away.Flash!Suddenly, a light flashed in front of Snoc, and Snoc covered his eyes. When he got used to the light a bit, he slowly lowered his hands. A hazy light floated in front of him, and he saw a person standing next to the light.Snoc became terrified at the sight in front of him. The man was covered in a black robe from head to toe. He was one of the unidentified figures that had kidnapped him.\u201cSir, you have woken up.\u201dContrary to his forceful actions, the man talked to Snoc with a gentle voice. But somehow, Snoc didn\u2019t feel reassured at all. Instead, he felt his instincts sharpen at the man\u2019s voice.\u201cW-who are you?\u201d\u201cAh, I have not introduced myself. I would like for us to get to know each other while drinking fragrant tea in a more relaxed atmosphere, but we are in a bit of a hurry.\u201dThe man stretched his hand towards Snoc. Recalling the events that happened to him recently, Snoc unconsciously flinched and closed his eyes. But it was not Snoc that the man was stretching his hand towards.Grab!Koooooo!Nowem let out an angry cry. At Nowem\u2019s cry, Snoc opened his eyes wide, and he saw that the man had forcefully grabbed onto Nowem.Nowem clung onto Snoc\u2019s clothes with his teeth and resisted to part from him. Snoc did not know where he found the courage to resist, but he moved as soon as he heard Nowem\u2019s cries.Punch! Punch!Snoc held Nowem with one hand and punched the man with his other hand.\u201cLet go! Let go!\u201dBut the man\u2019s arms did not move an inch. Instead, he grabbed Snoc\u2019s neck with his free hand.\u201cUgh!\u201dThe man lifted Snoc by the neck. Snoc felt as if he was getting hung in an execution.\u2018This is interesting. I was informed that he was a timid person. He must have some kind of special relationship with the mole.\u2019Snap!\u201cAgh!\u201dSnoc finally let go of Nowem as the pressure on his neck increased. Nowem let out a scream as he was pulled away, and the man threw Snoc on top of a pile of rocks.Bam!\u201cUrghh.\u201dSnoc fell on the pile of rocks and was left immobilized. After a few moments, he barely managed to pull himself up and looked around him.\u2018\u2026.This place is!\u2019Collapsed rocks blocked the entranceway. At that moment, Snoc knew exactly where he was.\u2018I\u2019m in the collapsed shaft!\u2019Snoc turned his body around and placed one hand on top of a pile of rocks. Then he glared at the area across from him.\u201cWhat are you doing? Are you looking at something across from you?\u201dSnoc flinched at the man\u2019s words, not because he became even more scared but because the man\u2019s voice sounded as if he knew why Snoc was looking across from him. Unable to hide the shock on his face, Snoc glared at the man.\u201cYou are staring at me as if you are wondering how I knew. There\u2019s nothing really much to it. Your eyes looked very sad and desperate as if you were looking at your father\u2019s grave.\u201dSnoc was sure that if he could see the man\u2019s face right now, he would be sneering at him.\u201cAh, thinking about it, didn\u2019t two people die from the collapse here? Being a miner is a really tough job. Both of them had two young sons. I\u2019m not sure if they were able to die in peace.\u201d\u201cShut the fuck up\u2026\u201dSnoc swore at the man. Snoc was so angry that he was no longer afraid of the man.\u201cOh my, how scary! But I apologize. It\u2019s not right to insult others\u2019 parents. To make up for my mistake, I will reveal some information to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Information?\u201dSnoc knew the man\u2019s words would not be trustworthy. There was no way that a man who kidnapped and attacked him would give him any useful information. In the first place, the man\u2019s voice was full of mockery. But Snoc couldn\u2019t help perk his ears, because it was information about his father.\u201cThat ancient being is filled with wrath and comes down upon us like a tidal wave. It\u2019s a disaster that has never been seen before.\u201d\u201cThat song\u2026\u201d\u201cYou know it right? It\u2019s a song about a \u2018mining monster\u2019 sleeping deep inside the mines. People like you think this monster is just a myth and that the song was made to prevent children from entering the mines. But the myth is completely true! The \u2018mining monster\u2019 is real and this song is about that monster.\u201dSnoc\u2019s eyes shook at the man\u2019s words.\u201cDo you see that over there?\u201dThe man pointed towards a pile of stones. When Snoc looked at the place the man pointed to, he saw something strange. From a glance, the rock on top looked the same as any other rock, but with closer observation, the substance looked as if it was man-made.\u201cIt\u2019s a sealing stone. The stone is sealing the \u2018mining monster.\u2019 Your father was mining around here and accidentally touched the sealing stone\u2014that\u2019s why the \u2018mining monster\u2019 was released!\u201dOn one hand, the man\u2019s voice was like a kind teacher teaching his pupil; on the other hand, his voice was like a demon tricking an innocent child.\u201cFrom that incident, an earthquake occurred. Obviously, the biggest impact happened here, where the sealing stone was. And that was the reason why this area collapsed and buried your father.\u201dSnoc began to remember what happened around this time. There had been a sudden vibration, and a commotion followed afterwards. People around him ran out in a stream and high officials tried to make sense of what happened. But most of all, the images of his mother tightly hugging him and crying her eyes out were most vivid in his memories.\u201cYou are getting angry, right? Are you filling up with wrath? It\u2019s the monster that murdered your father, killed your mother from overwork, and the reason why you hate working as a miner!\u201dMemories began flooding his mind. Snoc gritted his teeth, and anger began to fill his heart towards the mining monster.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to hate it! You have the right to do so! Is this not the monster who took your whole family?!\u201dThe man\u2019s voice got louder as Snoc got angrier. His voice echoed through the caves and filled up Snoc\u2019s mind.\u201cWell, let\u2019s give a rightful judgment to this hateful bastard! Let\u2019s show your wrath to this shameless bastard who goes around carelessly living after killing your father!\u201dSwish.The man pulled out his hands. Snoc, who had been full of wrath, flinched at what was in the man\u2019s hand\u2014It was Nowem.Nowem\u2019s whole body drooped as if he was tired after resisting so much. Nowem also seemed to be full of fear.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you start? Try insulting or inflicting violence upon him. You have full right to do so!\u201d\u201cW-what are you saying? What does N-Nowem have to do with\u2026\u201dAnger disappeared from his body, and Snoc felt cold. He shook at the truth in front of him. But the man was cruel\u2014no, he was enjoying this movement. With a giddy voice, the man continued, \u201cThis is your life\u2019s enemy! He was the one who caused this area to collapse and killed your father. This is the mining monster!\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dSnoc\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cHe is the magical beast of Earth. Did you name him Nowem? I can\u2019t believe he had the audacity to approach you and pretend to be your family. He really has an evil personality. I\u2019m sure he was laughing at you all along!\u201dKoo! Koo!Nowem cried out as if he was protesting the man\u2019s words. But no one replied to Nowem\u2019s cries. Not the man, nor Snoc.\u201cEnact your justice on this evil bastard. What are you hesitating for? Is this not the being that killed your father? Are you really going to ignore your father\u2019s death for a being that you just met recently?\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dThe man laughed as Snoc\u2019s whole body trembled.* * *Halt!Zich stopped in front of the mine. Because of the three assassins that had attacked him, there was quite a bit of distance between Zich and the rest of the assassins. But Zich\u2019s outstanding detection skills did not let him lose sight of where they were heading.\u2018They went inside the mining area.\u2019Why did they enter the mine at this time? Moreover, why did they kidnap a miner? He had many questions to ask them.\u2018I should first take care of these punks.\u2019Zich lowered his arms. The tip of his sword almost reached the ground.Thud. Thud.Zich loosened his whole body and walked. His stance was full of gaps. It was the movement of someone who had no qualms about getting attacked. When Zich was about to enter the mine, figures hidden in the darkness began moving.Pierce!Zich pierced his sword into one of the shadows. His movement was so natural that the assassin had no time to react at all, and he died without being able to resist.\u201cUgh!\u201dSwish!Just like black ink washing away with water, one assassin slowly appeared from the darkness. The assassin had his hand on his neck as he lay dead on the ground. Blood seeped into the ground.The assassins had been found out. As soon as they realized this, the rest of the assassins threw their bodies at Zich. But Zich easily sliced them like they were pieces of meat.Splash!Zich flicked the blood off his sword and left the piles of corpses behind him.\u2018Hmm, it looks like the entrance to hell.\u2019The mining area looked ominous in the night. It seemed like a skeleton and an undead would pop out at any moment and dance the waltz together.\u2018If I count the number of assassins I cut down, it looks like there is only one left.\u2019Zich still hadn\u2019t killed the leader yet. The leader was the one who probably took Snoc inside the mine.\u2018I\u2019m going to quickly find him and beat him up to get some answers.\u2019The leader probably had the most information. Snoc\u2019s safety was already pushed to the corner of Zich\u2019s mind. Obviously, Zich was going to save Snoc, but he was just more curious about the assassins\u2019 plans.Zich then sensed something.\u201cHmm?\u201dHe stopped. His gaze fell to the ground.\u2018No way. Is this\u2026?\u2019Zich could feel something ominous beneath his feet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Creak!The door and window let out piercing screams. The bed sloshed like a lake disturbed by a stone.\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dSam opened his eyes from his deep sleep. His vision was blurry from lying down, but he abruptly got up.\u2018An earthquake?\u2019He arched his back. Everyone feared a natural disaster like an earthquake, but miners feared them even more, and Sam especially disliked earthquakes.The earthquake soon stopped, but Sam\u2019s heart failed to calm down.\u2018Let me take a look outside.\u2019The earthquake might have affected the mine. He couldn\u2019t investigate its effects carefully at this time of the night, but he could scan the mine\u2019s exterior. He quickly put on his clothes and got out.* * *Hans stared at the window that Zich jumped out of.\u2018What is going on?\u2019Hans thought Zich would return soon, but even after much time had passed, Zich still hadn\u2019t come back. Hans even thought of going to sleep first since Zich seemed open-minded about these kinds of matters; he didn\u2019t think Zich would nitpick about who slept first. However, the earthquake lingered on his mind. It was ridiculous to think that there would be any human involvement in a natural phenomenon, but it seemed possible with Zich.\u2018It could totally happen.\u2019Thus, Hans couldn\u2019t go to sleep peacefully.\u2018Huh?\u2019While wondering if the earthquake involved Zich or if it was just a coincidence, Hans saw someone walking in the night.\u2018Isn\u2019t that Sam?\u2019What was he doing so late at night? Hans ran out of the window. Although he denied such claims, he was becoming more like Zich.\u201cMr. Sam?\u201d\u201cYou gave me a scare!\u201dSam looked startled. He was walking in a dark night with only his torch to rely on, so Hans surprised him by dropping down from the sky. Sam clutched onto his thumping heart and tried to still it.\u201cA-Are you ok?\u201d\u201cYes. I was just a bit surprised.\u201d\u2019Hans looked at Sam with an apologetic face.Hans was someone who stuck to Zich\u2019s side like an accessory. Zich called Hans his servant, but Sam knew that Hans wasn\u2019t a slave, so he maintained his etiquette.\u201cWhat are you here for, Mr. Hans?\u201d\u201cI was looking out of the window and saw you passing by.\u201dHans pointed at the building next to them. Only one window was open with the light on from one of the many attached to the building\u2019s walls.\u2018Did he jump off from there?\u2019Sam looked at Hans in surprise, but Hans was calm as if he hadn\u2019t done anything special. It almost seemed as if Sam was the unusual one.\u2018I thought he was normal and meek in comparison to Zich, but as expected of Zich\u2019s servant.\u2019Hans was also different from ordinary people like him.\u201cWhere are you going in a hurry in the middle of the night?\u201d\u201cI am going to check the mine because of the earthquake.\u201d\u201cAt this time? Wouldn\u2019t it be better to go when it\u2019s bright?\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t check it immediately, my heart won\u2019t be able to rest.\u201dSam\u2019s face looked urgent and desperate, so Hans gave up on trying to persuade him. However, it was late, and it was especially dangerous at this time. Even if there weren\u2019t monsters, a mountain beast was enough to pose a great danger to a normal person.\u2018If I just let him go and something happens to him, I will probably hear a lot of insults.\u2019Hans scratched his head and said, \u201cI will go with you. If Sir Zich was here, he would have probably done that.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t I be inconveniencing you?\u201dAlthough he said this, Sam was glad. If he was guarded by someone who hunted monsters, he would be a lot safer.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s go quickly and come back.\u201dHans wrote where he was going on a piece of paper and went up the mine with Sam.* * *While crossing his arms in front of the mine\u2019s entrance, Zich started thinking. An unusual energy overflowed and rose out of the mine. The energy, which leaked little by little, exploded out of control after the earthquake erupted. A massive piece of earth blocked the path of the energy flow, so it was hard for Zich to assess the direction and origin of the energy. However, the energy was definitely coming from the mine.Zich felt a sense of dull robustness and vitality; it was the earth\u2019s energy.\u2018Nowem must have woken up.\u2019Zich didn\u2019t know Nowem\u2019s exact identity. He just knew that since Nowem had complete authority over the earth, it was probably Nowem who had woken up inside the mine.\u2018As expected, those guys are related to Nowem.\u2019It was definite since right after the assassins\u2019 leader went inside the mine, a being who sounded like Nowem appeared.\u2018This is good. I came to this city to meet Nowem in the first place. I will kill him here.\u2019Since the mine was far from the city, Zich didn\u2019t have to worry about inflicting damages on properties and people\u2019s lives. First, Zich began to examine his body. He wasn\u2019t hurting nor did he feel discomfort anywhere; and since the assassins were like appetizers to him, his body was perfectly warmed up. The dead assassins would have probably gritted their teeth in anger if they heard this, but Zich was calm. His armor was in good condition, and he tightly gripped the sword in his hand. At last, he checked the mana in his body by circling it around and stood a short distance away from the mine\u2019s entrance.Zich didn\u2019t plan to go inside the mine. The mine environment would be advantageous to Nowem, who could use the earth\u2019s power. Zich\u2019s current strength was far from the strength he had in his prime days, and he didn\u2019t want to go inside his enemy\u2019s home territory if he didn\u2019t have to.\u2018And he is going to come out anyways.\u2019The spectacular entrance of the \u2018Earth\u2019s Tyrant\u2019 started with Suol\u2019s destruction; thus, Zich knew Nowem would get out of the mine at one point to destroy Suol. As if agreeing with his conclusions, Zich soon sensed a presence approaching the mine\u2019s entrance. The earth\u2019s energy moved with the presence, and Zich was sure that it was the Earth\u2019s Tyrant, Nowem.\u2018Huh?\u2019However, after he felt the presence, he tilted his head sideways.\u2018This\u2026I have sensed this presence before.\u2019The presence was a bit different from before, but he had definitely felt it.\u2018Is it\u2026!\u2019A memory flashed across his mind and surprised Zich.Step! Step!He heard footsteps inside the mine. Zich uncrossed his arms and pulled out his sword.A human was in front of him. A completely normal human being that could be found anywhere in the village. The only special thing about the man was his dazed, blank eyes. However, the earthy smell that flowed out of his body told Zich that he was the Earth\u2019s Tyrant, Nowem.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s you.\u201dZich clicked his tongue. It almost seemed like a trick of destiny\u2014to think that the Earth\u2019s Tyrant, Nowem, was someone he knew. Zich said his name.\u201cSnoc.\u201dSnoc didn\u2019t respond to his name, so Zich asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you get dragged off by assassins? What happened inside the mine? And what is the energy you are carrying?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was no answer. Snoc seemed like he was out of his mind.\u201cAre you perhaps familiar with the name, Nowem?\u201dFinally, at Zich\u2019s question, Snoc showed a response.Blink!His pupils came into focus and stared\u2014no, glared at Zich.\u2018It seems right.\u2019Snoc didn\u2019t respond to any other questions except the one about Nowem. That meant he had some relationship with Nowem.\u201cKoooooo!\u201dSnoc growled like a beast.\u2018Was Nowem always like this?\u2019The Nowem he knew was a professional guy. According to survivors\u2019 testimonies, Nowem was violent and cruel, and he diligently cornered his opponents by utilizing his authority over the earth. No information said that he was like a mindless beast in any way.\u201cKuaaaaah!\u201d Snoc cried out.Pop!The ground shook lightly, and a stalagmite popped out near Zich\u2019s feet. With the speed at which it popped out, the stalagmite was more dangerous than most spears or arrows. It looked like it could pierce Zich\u2019s body like a skewer; but instead of Zich\u2019s body, the stalagmite pierced the air. Zich struck down the ends of the two-meter stalagmite that now looked as if it had lost its aim and spirit.\u201cYou seem to be out of your mind, but do you think you will be fine after attacking me?\u201dZich smiled. Even the senseless Snoc twitched at the menacing smile.\u201cNow that I\u2019ve received an attack, I guess I can go back to my original goal.\u201dThe reason why Zich had come to Suol was to do the kind act of eliminating the Earth\u2019s Tyrant, Nowem.\u201cSince we know each other, if you gain your senses back in the middle of the fight, I will stop. So\u2014\u201dCrumble!As Zich moved his feet, the stalagmite crumbled. Simultaneously, Zich\u2019s new power shot out like arrows.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want anything terrible to happen to you, quickly regain your senses!\u201dZich clamped down his sword.Taaang!It was a deep, clear ring. The power of the mana-imbued sword went beyond imagination. However, it failed to inflict any damage to Snoc.Screech! Screech!The sword\u2019s edge scratched the stone and made disturbing noises. A rock barrier burst out from the ground and blocked Zich\u2019s sword in front of Snoc. But Zich expected it and he placed more pressure into his grip and poured mana into his sword.Crack!The wall exploded. Between the flying stone pieces and a cloud of dust, he saw Snoc\u2019s surprised face. It seemed as if Snoc didn\u2019t expect the wall to break so easily. Then, with one of his fingers on his free hand, he flicked one of the scattering stones.Push!\u201cUrgh!\u201dA small stone pierced right into Snoc\u2019s stomach. Snoc backed off while spitting out painful groans.\u2018His durability has risen considerably.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a force that a normal person could\u2019ve endured. Honestly, Zich had flicked the stone thinking that it didn\u2019t matter if the stone penetrated through Snoc\u2019s stomach.\u201cKuuaaaah!\u201dSnoc raised his hand.Craaaaash!The ground below Zich exploded. Grains of soil and large stones flew in all directions and laid waste to their surroundings. Zich backed off while swinging his sword.Ttatatatang!Zich used a high-level skill. For the small stones and sand that flew towards him, Zich made moving wind currents to block them, and for the bigger rocks, he individually blocked each one of them. Then, he used the \u2018Air Piercing\u2019 skill to shoot bursts of air at Snoc.Push!\u201cUrgh!\u201dThe force pierced a hole into Snoc\u2019s shoulders, and blood spurted out. Now, there were more holes in his body. Snoc pulled up a boulder to stop Zich\u2019s attacks, but he still gained two more holes.\u2018He\u2019s weak.\u2019Zich tilted his head sideways at Snoc who was struggling to fight back with his head hanging low. Considering how he gained the title of the Earth\u2019s Tyrant, he was way too weak.\u2018Is this guy really\u2026\u2019Zich began to doubt the existence of the Earth\u2019s Tyrant.Craaash!Stalagmite shot up under his feet again.Crumble!Zich stepped on the stalagmite with his feet and crushed it. He blocked Snoc\u2019s attacks with more ease than before, and it looked like Snoc had no chance of winning. On the other hand, Zich realized something as he looked at the stalagmite\u2019s broken parts.\u2018The force is greater.\u2019The stalagmite\u2019s speed and hardiness were superior to the ones before. Zich\u2019s feet felt numb after breaking the stalagmite.\u2018He is getting stronger.\u2019The speed at which Snoc was becoming stronger was extraordinary. This was probably how the Earth\u2019s Tyrant formed; it also meant that it was better to end him before he became stronger. Zich swung his sword.Snoc stationed a stone barrier as a defense again, but it didn\u2019t work. Zich\u2019s sword cut through the wall like mud and moved forward.Craaash!Zich\u2019s sword, which aimed for Snoc\u2019s neck, stopped in its tracks. The sword had been blocked by another sword, enveloped by a piercing bloodlust.\u201cLife should be cherished. Don\u2019t you know that you\u2019ll go to Hell if you kill others recklessly?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not something a guy like you should say,\u201d Zich said while looking at the leader of the group of assassins that kidnapped Snoc.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayScreeeech!Two swords fiercely competed against each other in strength. Both of the mana-filled swords continued to seek the slightest opportunity to slice their opponent\u2019s neck off.\u201cIt seems like all my underlings are dead. Are they all dead?\u201d the man asked.\u201cDid you honestly think that they would still be alive with their level of skills?\u201d\u201cNo, I know better. I should\u2019ve expected it from people I picked out in a hurry.\u201dTang!Zich and the man pushed each other\u2019s swords and increased the distance between them. It was a brief confrontation. Zich glanced at Snoc for a moment and then looked directly at the man.\u201cI am asking to make sure. You are the one who made Snoc like that, right?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I do well, sir?\u201dLike he was proud, the man placed his hands on his waist, puffed up his chest, and assumed an air of confidence.\u201cYou know, our friend here is quite the shy guy. So, I went out of my way to do him a favor. I was worried that he might not be satisfied.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so humble. He seems to be satisfied by the way he is literally exploding in confidence. Well, I just asked because I was curious about why he suddenly became so confident about himself.\u201dIn a potentially dangerous situation, they spurred out bloodlust, but it almost felt as if they were engaging in a calm and joyful conversation.\u201cThere are very few ways to instantly boost a normal person\u2019s self-esteem, especially someone who has been mining all their life. Since he is not holding anything, it doesn\u2019t seem like you handed him a magical sword or anything like that. There\u2019s a high chance that somebody poured power into his body or fused another being into him. Back then, I saw that even though he lost his senses, his use of his new power didn\u2019t seem awkward or stiff, which suggests that the latter is right. What did you put inside him?\u201d\u201cYou have a wide spectrum of knowledge, sir.\u201dThe man pretended to be calm even when Zich deduced the answer from just the situation around him. His wariness about Zich increased one level higher.\u201cRather than compliments, I would like you to satisfy my curiosity.\u201d\u201cDo you perhaps know a man named Drew?\u201dThe man answered with a question, and Zich nodded.Zich answered, \u201cSince he didn\u2019t seem to know his place, I taught him a lesson with my fists. But don\u2019t worry; everything\u2019s been resolved, and I don\u2019t hold a grudge against him.\u201d\u2018I found him! The unknown variable!\u2019Considering Zich\u2019s formidable skills and his constant interference with their plans, the man had just guessed. The man was glad that he finally found the person he had been looking for and a feeling of loathing rose up inside his heart.\u201cThank you for your answer. I also want to answer your question in return, but unfortunately, I can\u2019t satisfy your curiosity. We have to make a living too.\u201d\u201cHm, I can\u2019t keep asking questions if you say that, since making a living is an important matter.\u201d\u201cI do like people who are understanding. I bet you are quite popular, right?\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s embarrassing, but I can\u2019t deny that. If I count all the people who follow me, assuming that they like me, it\u2019s enough to fill this whole mine.\u201d\u201cWow! Of course! I thought your appearance was brilliant, but as expected, you are well liked!\u201d\u201cHahaha! I don\u2019t know what to do myself with all your flattery. But let\u2019s go onto the next topic. I don\u2019t want to give Snoc more time to get stronger.\u201dZich\u2019s smile changed from bright to serious.\u201cOh, dear! That\u2019s heartless. Were you lying about having a generous heart? I feel like my faith in you has been shattered a bit.\u201d\u201cSorry for disappointing you. But I just got the answer to my last bit of curiosity.\u201dZich\u2019s eyes moved to Snoc.\u201cHis body regenerated. The only thing that can fuse with a human is a magical beast or a spirit. A spirit without a body doesn\u2019t increase one\u2019s regenerative skills. Seeing how it gives regenerative abilities to its host, it seems like the object of the fuse is a magical beast; and the energy it spouts out shows that it\u2019s a beast related to the earth. And now that I think about it, isn\u2019t there a legend about a mining monster that lives in Iruce Mine?\u201dZich\u2019s eyes shone.\u201cIt must be him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe man couldn\u2019t respond this time.\u2018Who is this person\u2026?\u2019With only a few pieces of information, Zich hit the mark. The man knew Zich was a formidable variable who thwarted his plans, but he didn\u2019t expect Zich to be so perceptive. However, his surprise didn\u2019t end there.\u201cIs Nowem that magical beast\u2019s name?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cI must be right!\u201dNow, Zich knew why the man had called Snoc with the title, Nowem. But in contrast to Zich, the man had more questions now. From what he knew, after Snoc named the beast of the earth as Nowem, he didn\u2019t tell anyone about it. The man also wouldn\u2019t have known if it wasn\u2019t for the information he got from his organization.Yet, Zich said everything in a matter-of-fact tone. Similar to how his underlings were astonished when Zich mentioned the name: \u2018The Tyrant of the Earth, Nowem,\u2019 the man also found it difficult to repress his shock.\u2018I must extract information from him!\u2019He thought Zich was simply an unknown variable who distorted their plans, but now Zich was a mysterious human who held important information.\u201cThen may I ask where you got this information?\u201d the man asked while raising his sword.\u201cSorry, but this is also a problem related to my living. I can\u2019t just tell you.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then I guess it can\u2019t be helped.\u201dThe man shrugged.\u201cLet\u2019s talk with our swords.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m all for that. Snoc seems to have also finished his regeneration, so I guess he can join us.\u201dUsing Snoc\u2019s shriek as the signal, they swung their swords. In front of the mine\u2019s entrance, the battle commenced again.* * *It was a three-way battle at the mine. The man tried to only attack Zich, but Snoc attacked recklessly without caring whether his opponent was Zich or the man. Everything was fine until that point. Unlike the other two who tried to defeat everyone else but themselves, the man\u2019s sole target was Zich. The man thought he could block Snoc\u2019s attacks with low effort and focus most of his attention on Zich. However, he quickly found out that he had underestimated Zich\u2019s powers.\u2018This bastard is used to three-way battles! No, should I say that he is used to dog fights?\u2019As soon as he realized that Snoc wasn\u2019t on the man\u2019s side, Zich lightly bounced off Snoc\u2019s attacks to the man or purposefully induced Snoc to clash with him. The man tried to resist Snoc\u2019s attacks, but Zich\u2019s swords skillfully guided Snoc\u2019s attacks to collide with the man. On top of that, Snoc\u2019s attacks grew stronger and sharper, so they were becoming harder to block.\u2018He\u2019s still young.\u2019The man glanced at Zich\u2019s face. Zich\u2019s face looked youthful, and it was a wonder how he could possess such skill and proficiency at such a young age.However, even Zich wasn\u2019t that composed. The man\u2019s skills were noteworthy, and Snoc\u2019s strength was continuing to increase.Craaash!All of their attacks collided in one area and created an explosion. The three created more distance between each other.\u201cI will admit it. You are really amazing.\u201dThe man clapped lightly at Zich.\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would meet such a troublesome fellow on a mission that I took in my free time.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t get anything even if you compliment me.\u201d\u201cI am telling you the truth. It\u2019s very rare for a master of lies like me to express my feelings so truthfully. That\u2019s how impressive you are. Yes, enough to make your capture take precedence over my mission.\u201dAt that moment, the man\u2019s aura changed. It wasn\u2019t that he became stronger; it was just that with his change of heart, the aura he exuded also changed.\u201cKooooo!\u201dSnoc seemed to also feel the difference. Since he moved instinctively now, Snoc might have become more sensitive to changes in people\u2019s spirits.\u201cAh, I really hate using this.\u201dWiiing!Strong energy poured out of the man\u2019s body, and Snoc\u2019s body shuddered while Zich\u2019s expression stiffened. The surrounding mana circled the man.Rustle! Rustle!The robe that tightly wrapped around the man\u2019s body puffed up. It looked like he was forcefully putting muscles inside a layer of skin, and the robe ripped apart and revealed the man\u2019s face. The man\u2019s face was finally out in the open, but his appearance wasn\u2019t helpful in figuring out his identity. This was because the man\u2019s face had changed so much that he looked like a monster.\u201cHuff! Huff!\u201dThe man gasped. As if to check the success of his transformation, he moved his body in an exaggerated way.\u201cYour stunt is good. Are you from the circus?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not from the circus, but after I retire, I am thinking about starting a new career there. How is it? Isn\u2019t this quite a talent?\u201dThe man\u2019s tone was light, but his voice was considerably rougher. The contrast in his tone and voice stressed the man\u2019s overwhelming presence.\u201cKu-Kuaaaaaaah!\u201dSnoc ran towards the man. His movements looked like he was trying to rule out the danger that suddenly appeared in front of him. Stone pieces shot up and wrapped around Snoc\u2019s arms, and his arms looked like those of a stone giant.\u201cHm, I don\u2019t want to hurt you since you are the result of my struggles, but\u2026\u201dThe man avoided Snoc\u2019s arm and pierced Snoc\u2019s insides.\u201cI have someone more important than you now.\u201dPunch!The man\u2019s arms hit Snoc\u2019s stomach. Although Snoc covered his stomach with rocks like armor in that short amount of time, the man\u2019s punch was strong enough to rip apart the armor and send Snoc flying.\u201cKuaaaaah!\u201dWith a painful scream, Snoc disappeared far away. Judging by the trajectory, it seemed like he fell somewhere in the middle of the mountain.\u201cOkay, now that our hindrance is gone, let\u2019s enjoy our sweet time fighting.\u201d\u201cWill that be all right? I thought you went through a lot of trouble to make that guy.\u201d\u201cWhat can I do when you are stealing all my interest away? Also, he is all right. He won\u2019t die from that much, and he can heal most wounds. And since he doesn\u2019t have his own will, he will be waiting there until I take care of you and go look for him. Of course, all of this is considering that he doesn\u2019t meet anyone.\u201d\u201cAnd after you take care of him, will you guide him to Suol?\u201d\u201cDing-ding! Your mental sharpness is out of this world. Do you have any thoughts about joining us? I think you will be able to climb up positions really fast in our organization.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not my style to serve another person, so I will have to decline your offer.\u201d\u201cOh, I got rejected. How sad. Then, I guess I should let out this pent-up anger.\u201d* * *Hans felt troubled as he stared at the mountain top. At his side, Sam looked anxious. To check the Iruce Mine, they were climbing the mountain. Since monsters hadn\u2019t penetrated the area yet and wild beasts didn\u2019t pose a threat to Hans, they climbed up the mountain with ease.When they reached the mountain top, they suddenly felt a commotion. It was apparent that there was a battle going on, and Hans immediately recalled Zich who had abruptly run out of the room.\u2018I feel like Sir Zich is involved.\u2019Hans thought that was very likely. Now, the problem was what they should do. They both heard shrieks from the mine, and Hans felt it was out of the question to bring Sam to a place like that. He wondered whether he should guide Sam back to the city or leave Sam here for him to run to the battlefield where Zich was. He thought for a bit longer and quickly made up his mind.\u2018Considering Sir Zich\u2019s skills, I will just be a bother if I try to go help. Even if I participated in the battle, wouldn\u2019t it be better to ensure Mr. Sam\u2019s safety first?\u2019Hans made his decision and was about to tell Sam to go back down when something fell from the sky.Crash! Craaash! Bam!The figure broke off a couple of tree branches and landed with a huge collision sound.Clang!Hans unsheathed his sword instinctively and stood guard against the object. His natural movement highlighted the results of his strenuous training.A human fell in front of them. Parts of his body were twisted from the fall, and it was evident that the person had suffered significant injuries; however, the person got up like nothing was wrong with him. His movements, which reminded the duo of a zombie\u2019s, caused goosebumps on their skin. Then, Sam brought the torch closer to the person, and the light revealed who the figure was.\u201c\u2026Snoc?\u201d Sam\u2019s surprised voice spread across the mountainside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBefore he transformed, the man had attacked Zich and Snoc with a fighting style that was clear and precise but full of bloodthirst. However, after his transformation, his fighting style completely changed. He threw away his sword to the side as if it was a small stick and began fighting with only his body. There were no skills or techniques involved. He only used speed, power, and his tough skin\u2014but with just these physical characteristics, he was able to drive Zich to a corner.Crashhh!The man tried to punch Zich but hit the ground instead. Rock pieces flew everywhere, and there was a huge dent in the rock. Zich, who managed to evade the man\u2019s attack, distanced himself from the man.Crunch!The man stepped hard on the ground. His footsteps formed deep indentations on the rocks, and his body flew as if a ballista had thrown his body into the air.Whish!The man spread his palms and made some wide movements. His attacks were rudimentary and full of gaps. But the strength and speed of his massive arms far exceeded common sense.Zich raised his sword to block the man\u2019s attack.Slammm!The sound of a sword sharply clashing against human skin rang across the cave; it was hard to believe that it was the sound of a sword on human skin. Moreover, Zich\u2019s sword began to bend from his opponent\u2019s sheer strength, and he had to quickly focus on fusing mana into his wrists.Punch!The man was able to successfully push back Zich\u2019s sword and hit Zich\u2019s forearms. As if he was a broken puppet doll, Zich\u2019s body flew to the side.Slip!Zich lost his center of gravity, but he managed to land on his two feet with relative ease. He fixed his posture.Throb!His arm that got punched ached. Zich tried moving his arms a few times.\u2018It\u2019s just a bruise.\u2019None of his bones were broken, and the pain from his arm was not so great that it would affect the flow of battle. However, the only reason why his arm didn\u2019t break was because he protected himself with mana at the last second. If he hadn\u2019t defended himself with mana, not only would his arm be broken, but several of his ribs would be broken too. Moreover, if he got hit in the same place multiple times, no amount of mana would prevent him from getting severly injured.\u2018For now, this dude is stronger than me.\u2019Zich had no problem admitting this.\u2018What is that? It\u2019s a skill that I\u2019ve never seen before. I\u2019ve seen skills that increase strength before, but never as great as this. No, is this even a skill?\u2019Even if it was not a skill, Zich was sure that he had never seen something like this.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Zich just decided to ask outright.\u201cFufufu! Are you beginning to feel afraid?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just curious because I\u2019ve never seen such a skill. Is that even a skill?\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s a skill. If you are so curious, why don\u2019t you try joining our organization? You will not only be able to satisfy your curiosity, but you will be able to make this skill yours.\u201dThe man still hadn\u2019t given up on recruiting Zich, but Zich snorted, \u201cWhy would I learn a skill that so obviously uses your own life force? I can get much stronger without depending on such skills.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s true for someone like you.\u201dEven though Zich was young, the man was forced to use this technique to assure his victory. He could not imagine just how strong Zich would get when he got older.However\u2026\u201cBut that\u2019s only true if you manage to get out of here alive.\u201dThe man had no intentions to let Zich go. Zich felt annoyed at the man\u2019s absolute confidence over his victory.\u201cOkay, I admit it. Your strength is definitely above mine right now.\u201dZich was not afraid to accept the reality of his situation, but that was all there was to it.\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s too early to be assured of your victory just yet?\u201dBefore he regressed, Zich had fought countless battles. He had fought one-on-one battles, large-scale battles, and battles where he had to fight multiple enemies at once. There were times when he fought with people weaker than him, similar to him, and even stronger than him. But all of his battles had ended with the same result\u2014With his complete victory.\u2018This is not even a dangerous situation.\u2019Considering all the suffering he had to endure until he gained the title, \u2018The Demon Lord of Strength,\u2019 this didn\u2019t even count as a dangerous situation.\u201cI guess your confidence is still the same.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m too much of a genius to lose just because you were able to improve your skills a little bit.\u201d\u201cI like people who are confident, but people who are arrogant are not my style.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not arrogance. I\u2019m only speaking the truth.\u201d\u201cOkay. Then let\u2019s see whether or not you are confident or arrogant.\u201dThe man\u2019s attack was like a missile. He merely pushed out his arms or legs and sometimes made attacks with his elbows or knees. Because it was hard to withstand his strength, Zich evaded most of the man\u2019s attacks. However, the man\u2019s speed pressured Zich more and more as time passed on. The few attacks Zich managed to inflict bounced off the man\u2019s tough skin.From a glance, Zich was being driven to a corner. Bruises and cuts kept piling upon his body.\u201cWhat are you doing? Is it really arrogance? It looks like you will be in trouble if you don\u2019t start showing something new.\u201dThe man mocked Zich. So far, Zich had not shown proper retaliation ever since his confident words about how a genius like him wouldn\u2019t lose. After returning the man\u2019s sarcasm with jokes, Zich was now silent and didn\u2019t reply. The man judged that Zich didn\u2019t even have the leisure to reply.\u201cI expected more from you, but I guess this is it. Well, you worked hard. Considering your age, you did really well. I am honestly surprised. The only thing you lack is time, but what can you do? The world is unfair.\u201dThe man was going to make sure Zich never reached his full potential. After he tortured and medicated Zich to get information about how he knew about Nowem and their transfusion, time would no longer pass for Zich.\u201cI hope you reflect on yourself in that short amount of time before you die. Youth is all about progress\u2014\u201d\u201cYou talk too much.\u201d Zich finally opened his mouth to speak.\u201cOh? You can talk now? I thought you became mute because you didn\u2019t say anything. No matter how dire your situation is, isn\u2019t it basic manners to reply when someone is talking?\u201d\u201cI apologize. It\u2019s because it took me a while to prepare. My control over my mana is still lacking, so I need to concentrate a lot.\u201d\u201cPrepare?\u201d\u201cYeah. Preparation to destroy you.\u201dThe man laughed as if Zich\u2019s words were so ridiculous\u2014he found them funny.\u201cAhahahah! Have you still not woken up from your dream? That\u2019s great! Let\u2019s look at what you so carefully prepared!\u201dCrashhh!The man moved straight towards Zich. It was a blunt and simple move, but the force of his movement was enormous. If Zich made even the slightest contact, several of his bones would break instantly. Compared to the man, Zich\u2019s retaliation was frail and also very simple. A sword with barely any strength or force weakly pointed towards the man.It was not even worth the man\u2019s time to defend. The man ignored the sword on him and raised his fists up to land a punch.Bang!\u201cHuh?\u201dThe man let out a surprised cry as a blood bath erupted forth in front of him. He hadn\u2019t even hit Zich yet, but why was so much blood coming out?He blinked his eyes several times. Everything felt unreal, but when he lifted his arm up, the pain forced him to face reality.\u201cUghh!\u201dThe man cried and grabbed onto his arms. Blood began to pour out like a river from his rock-hard body. As if his arm burst from the inside, the arm that had tried to hit Zich was caved in. The man quickly withdrew due to his unexpected injury. Seeing that his arm lay limp on his side, he could tell that this was no laughing matter.With great enjoyment, Zich watched the man fall into a state of shock and put his sword on his shoulders with ease.\u201cHow is it? Do you like it?\u201d\u201cH-How\u2026!\u201dZich\u2019s attack was a weak stab, but it pierced the man\u2019s arm completely. No, not pierced but exploded his arm.\u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018mana resonance.\u2019\u201d Zich spoke as if mana resonance was not a big deal, but it was no small feat to be able to use it.The concept of mana resonance began with the theory of \u2018sensory expansion.\u2019 By infusing the sword with one\u2019s own mana, one could control it like it was a part of oneself. But Zich\u2019s \u2018sensory expansion\u2019 went beyond his control of the sword. His control range went far past his weapon\u2014To even reach his opponent\u2019s body.\u201cWhat kind of nonsense are you saying\u2026!\u201dThe man could not believe Zich\u2019s words. He could not help it. What Zich was saying was too unbelievable\u2014because this meant that Zich could control his opponents by merely touching them with his sword!\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201dZich stabbed the man\u2019s other arm. The man quickly tried to evade the attack, but he was too slow. He was still recovering from his injury and the shock of Zich\u2019s words.Bang!\u201cUgh!\u201dThe man\u2019s other arm exploded.\u201cRight now, I don\u2019t have that much control of my mana, so I have to stab the same area many times to get it going, but once I establish my mana resonance there, it\u2019s all too easy to burst you like this.\u201d\u2018To think about it, this bastard only kept attacking me in the same spot\u2026!\u2019The man thought this was Zich\u2019s desperate ploy to pierce his tough skin. He did not imagine that it was Zich\u2019s attempt to gain control of his mana flow.\u201cI can\u2019t use this attack on people who are skilled at mana control, but you are nowhere near that level. Moreover, this attack is great on people who only know how to burst out mana like you.\u201dFor that reason, Zich was able to easily get in contact with the mana coming off the man\u2019s skin. After instilling mana resonance, Zich could make the man\u2019s mana explode inside of him. Since all of the man\u2019s extraordinary strength and speed came from his mana, once the mana flow flipped over to Zich\u2019s control, the man was completely helpless against Zich\u2019s attacks.Zich continued to stab the same area. The man\u2019s body continued to explode, and after a few moments, the man\u2019s entire body turned into rags.\u201cCough!\u201dThe man coughed out blood. His bluish and pale complexion indicated how severe his condition was. But even in this condition, the man looked as if he was unable to accept his situation.\u2018I can understand why.\u2019Mana resonance was one of Zich\u2019s most notorious skills. There was no skill greater than this to crush the spirits of guys who believed in their strong defense and send them to hell. However, Zich was not pleased that he was forced to use this skill.\u2018If I had full control over my mana, I could have just crushed him with sheer strength.\u2019Zich stopped reminiscing and focused his attention back to the man.\u201cI\u2019m curious about a few things. Can you answer some of my questions?\u201dZich was curious about the man\u2019s identity and his organization. He wanted to learn more about the mysterious organization that used skills he had never seen before, but the man snorted and replied coldly. He dropped his use of honorifics.\u201cYou think I will tell you?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dZich knew that people like him would not reply even with torture. If he had known this about the man, Zich would have saved some of his underlings to get some information.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you about my identity or tell you anything about Snoc.\u201d\u201cAh, you don\u2019t have to tell me anything about Snoc.\u201d\u201cIf you try to force a transfusion with a magical beast and a person, a normal person\u2019s body will completely collapse. However, Snoc\u2019s body even healed from the transfusion. This can only mean that Snoc\u2019s fundamental mana properties are extremely compatible with the magical beast\u2019s properties. I\u2019m sure Snoc\u2019s mana is very close to the earth.\u201dZich continued his analysis, \u201cIn that case, even if you force a transfusion, Snoc\u2019s body won\u2019t explode. But I\u2019m sure you played a part in the transfusion. You probably shook up his mentality, didn\u2019t you?\u201dZich shrugged his shoulders.\u201cSince you mentioned Drew before, he must have also been part of your plan. No wonder I witnessed such a funny sight like an adventurer accepting a disciple.\u201dThe man could not help but let out a low murmur, \u201cYou fucking bastard.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As thanks, I will gift you a piece of information on your way to Hell.\u201dZich bent one of his knees and met the man\u2019s eyes.\u201cYou might not believe me, but I am trying to live a kind life. No matter how much I think about it, you guys are the bad guys, and you also attacked me.\u201dThey were bad guys who antagonized him, and for Zich who tried to live a kind life after his regression, he needed to kill them at all costs.\u201cSo, I plan to wander around the world to find people in your organization. And I will send each and every one of them to your side. How does that sound? You won\u2019t get lonely in Hell then.\u201d\u201cYour post-death service seems to be on-point. But would you actually be able to do that? If you become our organization\u2019s enemy, you will quickly join me in Hell.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that I can\u2019t make a bet with you about that. Even if you told me to swear on the whole world, I would have done it.\u201d\u201cI pray that you\u2019ll always remember those words so that once the time comes, you\u2019ll feel fear to your very core.\u201d\u201cI will keep your words in my mind. Then, let\u2019s say our farewells. I must go to Snoc quickly. Whether I stop or save him, it\u2019s better the faster I go.\u201d\u201cSave? That guy?\u201d The man chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to save him. Ah, I think I know what you are thinking. Since I forcefully fused them together, do you think that if he just makes a contract with Nowem, he will return back to normal? But Snoc will never be able to accept Nowem. Even if he goes over that huddle, there\u2019ll be another huddle for him to go over. That\u2019s his fate that was decided before we formulated this plan.\u201d\u201cFate? That\u2019s a good word. It\u2019s a word that I really like to crush.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see you try.\u201d\u201cI will try.\u201d After saying these words, Zich swung his sword. He aimed his sword straight at the man\u2019s neck.Slice!The man\u2019s head went flying high up in the air and then fell and rolled on the ground. Was the man teasing him until the end? His head rolled to Zich\u2019s feet and stopped as if the man was looking up at him. The man\u2019s face was smiling widely; it was as if he was sending his chilling intentions to laugh at him even after death.It could have become a trauma for ordinary people, and even for brave souls, it would have made them feel uncomfortable or unpleasant. However, Zich was indifferent. In comparison to many of the things he experienced in his life, this wasn\u2019t even considered a curse.Kick!Zich kicked the man\u2019s head as if he was kicking a ball, and the battle ended like that.\u2018Then should I go looking for Snoc?\u2019Zich widened his senses. Because the man\u2019s transformed state had been far superior to him in sheer strength, Zich hadn\u2019t been able to spread out his senses. He had to focus all his attention on the man; thus, unlike usual, Zich couldn\u2019t check his surroundings.\u201cHuh?\u201dHe sensed a presence that had recently regenerated; it was an absurd and contradictory presence that felt familiar yet unfamiliar. It was Snoc. Feeling the earth\u2019s energy pouring out of him, it was definitely him. The problem was that there were two other presences besides Snoc.\u2018Why are they here?\u2019After listening carefully, he heard battle sounds from far away. Zich began to move towards them.* * *Even though it was such a bizarre happening, Hans couldn\u2019t process the significance of seeing a person he knew drop down dead center in a barren mountain in the middle of the night. But in a way, it was understandable. Hans couldn\u2019t afford to assess the situation.Craash!A boulder came flying his way. The rock was 1.5 times bigger than an average person. A person who was directly hit by that would obviously suffer grave consequences. Hans bit his lips and straightened his sword.\u201cHaaa!\u201dWith a shout, he swung his sword at the stone piece.Slice!Although his hands felt slightly numb, he was able to successfully cut the boulder. The boulder, which split into two pieces, fell on either side of him.Rumble! Rumble!He heard vibrations that were strong enough to shake the mountain. However, Hans didn\u2019t even have the time to focus on that and blocked the next attack.Pop!It was a colossal stalagmite this time. Sharp stalagmite shot up from the ground and surged forward like spears sticking into their enemies.\u2018Damn!\u2019His heart thumped. Still, Hans calmed his emotions and sliced the stalagmites coming his way. \u2018Don\u2019t panic no matter the situation\u2019\u2014it was what Zich had told him while forcing Hans into all kinds of adverse scenarios under the guise of training.During training, Hans felt great resentment towards Zich for making him go through so many hardships, but as a result, he was able to maintain a surprising level of composure; and that element allowed Hans to show 100% of his skills.\u2018Damn! Now, I won\u2019t even be able to insult him in my mind.\u2019Since he experienced the result of his training first-hand, he couldn\u2019t complain about it anymore. While he was thinking this, his body moved. His movements were fluid, making it hard to believe that he had lived a life far away from swordsmanship or physical work just recently. However, that didn\u2019t mean that he was at an advantage.Thanks to Zich\u2019s harsh training and Hans\u2019 natural talent, Hans was able to block Snoc\u2019s attacks. However, Snoc wasn\u2019t an easy opponent. Although Snoc\u2019s attacks were rough and simply based on instincts, the combination of Snoc and Nowem\u2019s natural mana created a convergence of powers that was truly formidable. Besides, Hans had an additional burden to consider.Buurst!The ground rose up like waves. A massive mass of dirt came upon Hans like a violent wave.\u2018Shit!\u2019After judging that he couldn\u2019t block this attack with a sword, Hans tried to quickly escape the area. However, there was another person he had to consider.\u201cGrab tight!\u201dHans carried Sam like a piece of luggage and backed off in a hurry.Craaash!A heap of soil swept over the area where Hans was standing. However, as if it wasn\u2019t satisfied by that, the earth rushed over the ground like a tsunami and chased after them. If he had been by himself, Hans would have been able to move effortlessly with little mana, but with the addition of Sam\u2019s weight, his mana consumption increased by several folds.He had no choice but to pour in more mana in his legs and increase his distance. He tried to let Sam escape many times, but for some unknown reason, Snoc also kept ruthlessly attacking Sam without exception.\u201cSnoc! What are you doing? Stop! It\u2019s me! Sam!\u201dWhile hanging onto Hans\u2019 shoulders, Sam screamed out to Snoc. Sam also felt like he was going crazy since Snoc, who he cared for like a brother, gained a strange power and was trying to kill him. Yet, all he could do was yell at Snoc while Hans protected him.\u201cKuuaaaaaah!\u201dAll that came back to him were Snoc\u2019s beast-like cries and his merciless attacks. Hans dodged with his head and flung away stone pieces that came flying in his direction.\u2018I think it will be hard for me to escape while carrying Sam. But I can\u2019t just throw him away as bait to make my escape.\u2019Hans\u2019 sense of justice didn\u2019t allow it.\u2018I can\u2019t do much but hope that Sir Zich will sense this battle and come rushing here.\u2019Hans didn\u2019t even want to think about a situation where Zich wasn\u2019t nearby or failed to sense them. Surprisingly, it didn\u2019t even cross Hans\u2019 mind that Zich might lose the battle.Crash!Hans sliced a stone that was the size of a fist.\u2018Why is this my first actual battle without Sir Zich?\u2019Hans had to protect a civilian while facing an opponent with special power; he lamented the fact that his luck must have run out ever since Zich broke his nose. Hans continued to block all of Snoc\u2019s attacks\u2014so well that even he was impressed by himself. Finally, his hard work was paying off.Craaaash!Turbulent waves of strong mana rushed in. After tormenting Hans in all kinds of ways, Snoc looked stunned. A mass pile of dirt rose in front of him; boulders formed a wall, and rocks clumped up together. However, a giant mass of mana squeezed into the barrier.Craash!An explosive sound swept over the area. Piles of dirt scattered away, stone walls split off into pieces, and clumps of stones broke away. The last line of defense\u2014the rock armor that Snoc had hurriedly wrapped around himself\u2014disappeared at the mana\u2019s touch. However, these barriers didn\u2019t fully dissolve the mana\u2019s impact, and Snoc rolled on the ground.\u201cWhy are you guys here?\u201dIt was a calm voice, indifferent to the feelings Hans felt while fighting with his life on the line. Something negative seemed to stir up inside Hans\u2019 heart; but Hans overlooked that feeling and recognized that he was more glad than anything to see Zich.\u201cSir Zich!\u201d\u201cZich!\u201dHans and Sam\u2019s voices overlapped. Their responses were like those of children who had reunited with their parents after a couple of decades. However, Zich didn\u2019t pay attention to their feelings and waved his hands.\u201cYeah, yeah, it\u2019s me.\u201dZich ignored their sparkling eyes and stared at Snoc. He wondered why Sam and Hans were all the way out here, but he could always ask them later. Snoc was a more pressing problem.\u201cHe is still out of control.\u201d\u201cOut of control? Do you know why Snoc became like that?\u201d Sam responded as Zich seemed to know something.\u201cHe was mixed up in a troublesome matter. I came here after killing the guy who made Snoc like that.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by a troublesome matter\u2026 Snoc is just a miner! Why would he get mixed up in something like that?!\u201d\u201cSam, even if you live a normal life, it doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t get dragged into troublesome matters. The people who usually cause these troublesome matters don\u2019t think about things like, \u2018I must not cause harm to others as much as possible.\u2019\u201dZich could say this with certainty as someone who used to instigate these \u2018troublesome matters.\u2019\u201cFurthermore, I think Snoc is not just a normal miner. He has talent.\u201d\u201cA talent?\u201d\u201cYeah, talent. A quite remarkable one at that. That\u2019s a good enough reason to get mixed up into troubles.\u201dA person with outstanding talent usually attracted attention from other people. Depending on the situation, they sometimes received bad or good attention; and unfortunately for Snoc, he had attracted bad attention this time.Sam was shocked to hear someone like Zich, who based his life on self-worth and pride, praise his childish, younger-brother; Snoc must possess something amazing for Zich to say that Snoc \u2018had talent.\u2019 But that wasn\u2019t the important issue now.\u201cAre you saying that Snoc became like that because of his talent?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a factor.\u201d\u201cThen, can he ever return back to normal?\u201dEven Zich couldn\u2019t give him a clear answer.\u201cI have something in mind. We have to do something about that magical beast of the earth that has been forcefully fused into him.\u201d\u201cBeast of the earth?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably what you guys call the mining monster.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just a legend\u2026!\u201d\u201cAmong legends, there are some that are real and give people a real headache. This one is probably that case.\u201dZich fixed the grip on his sword. Snoc got up from his fall and exuded bloodlust.\u201cFrom now on, I am going to fight him so stay a good distance away. And Hans!\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why you are protecting Sam here, but let me say a few words.\u201dWas Zich angry at him for not protecting Sam properly? Or was he planning to scold him for not defeating Snoc? Hans nervously gulped his saliva back down. However, Hans did not receive criticism but a thumbs-up.\u201cGreat job! Your response was amazing in a difficult battle where you had to protect a person while simultaneously fighting a tricky opponent! I will give you full marks for this battle!\u201dFor an entire minute, Hans couldn\u2019t comprehend Zich\u2019s words. Zich\u2019s words had been completely out of his expectations, but after processing what Zich said, Hans\u2019 face brightened up.\u201cT-Thank you, sir!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just keep doing what you\u2019ve been doing.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dCompliments were one of the best ways to motivate a person. Hans cast away all his worries and fears and poured all his passion into protecting Sam. The two moved to a safe distance, but because Sam was worried about Snoc, they couldn\u2019t completely escape the battle area.Zich didn\u2019t chase them farther away. Zich could easily protect both Hans and Sam while fighting with Snoc; moreover, even if some of Snoc\u2019s attacks passed him, Hans could handle them. But most of all, Sam might be necessary to return Snoc back to normal.\u2018Well, you never know. A family member\u2019s voice could touch his heart or something like that.\u2019In the worst-case scenario, Zich would have to kill Snoc, and a family member could be with Snoc in his final moments.\u201cKuuaaah!\u201d Snoc cried, and his bloodlust spread out.\u201cYeah. For someone who\u2019s lost his mind, you stayed quiet for a while.\u201dAlthough he was wary of Zich like a cautious animal, Snoc couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. Zich raised his sword as Snoc ran towards him.\u201cTo tell you the truth, I don\u2019t know how I can restore you back to normal. I\u2019m not sure if this will work. So\u2014\u201dPunch!As he stepped on the rushing ground beneath him, Zich slammed his index finger on Snoc\u2019s cheeks and said, \u201cSo let me beat you up until you are almost dead!\u201d* * *When Snoc fought with Zich and the robed man in a three-way battle, they had fought on similar levels. However, the situation was completely different now. On second thought, Zich thought it was absurd to even say that it had been a three-way battle; the robed man had strictly guarded against Zich and taken Snoc\u2019s side. Without the man, Snoc struggled to even keep his head up in a one-on-one battle with Zich.Pop!Stalagmites shot up from below, and huge boulders fell from above. Zich snorted at the tricky attacks that came below and above him simultaneously.\u201cI\u2019m getting sick of this pattern.\u201dTong!By just accelerating a bit, Zich evaded the attack and struck a punch on Snoc\u2019s face.Punch!\u201cKuugh!\u201dSnoc\u2019s face twisted irregularly. Even though rocks had wrapped over his skin like armor, Snoc wavered from the impact.Punch! Punch!With Zich\u2019s punches, the pieces of rocks on Snoc\u2019s body fell. If Zich had used his sword instead of his fists, the fight would have been finished a long time ago. Snoc widened their distance as if he was running away. As he moved away, stone pieces popped out from the ground and attached themselves to his feet.\u201cHe wants to maintain his armor?\u201dSnoc\u2019s body changed like a bulky golem. Except for his face, his whole body was surrounded by stones.\u201cKuaaaah!\u201dCrash!The stone armor was so heavy, Snoc crushed the ground wherever he walked.Thump! Thump!Two pairs of feet made dents on the ground. Just the sound of their movements was enough to make listeners pale in fair. However, Zich was calm.\u201cAmazing! Right now, you look like a dirt doll that children play with.\u201dOf course, even if Zich had a kid in the future, he would never gift them a doll like that.Thump!Snoc approached Zich until they were a foot apart from each other.\u201cKrugh!\u201dSnoc let out an odd shriek and swung a fist that was the size of a man.Swish!Before Snoc\u2019s fist hit him, the wind warned Zich of what was coming. Zich backed off exactly three steps.Craaash!Snoc\u2019s fist hit the barren ground, and Snoc desperately searched for Zich.Thump! Thump!He moved his feet and twisted his body. Considering his rock-hard armor, one would expect him to be stiff, but unexpectedly, Snoc\u2019s movements were smooth.\u201cKuuuh! Kuuuh!\u201dSnoc continued to throw attacks at Zich; he punched, kicked, or tried to grab onto him, but Zich evaded all of his attacks by a hair\u2019s breadth. Zich moved like a mosquito\u2014flying near him and moving just out of his reach\u2014and this infuriated Snoc. If he could just catch Zich, Snoc felt that he could one-sidedly beat up Zich, but Zich seemed to escape his grasp by a hair\u2019s breadth every single time.\u201cKuuuuuah!\u201dCrash!Snoc locked his fingers together and struck the ground. However, his movements had only increased in power and were clumsier than before, so none of them landed on Zich. Snoc continued to hit the ground with his fist again, but Zich used that chance to close the distance between him and Snoc.As if he was glad to see that Zich was now closer, Snoc immediately responded. Trusting his rock-hard armor, Snoc didn\u2019t get into a defensive position. Instead, he moved his arms around Zich as if he was trying to hug and entrap Zich. His plan was to break Zich in his embrace.\u201cIf you only rely on the hardness of your armor, you are going to see some blood.\u201dSwish!Zich swung his sword. Usually, his sword movements were smooth enough to slice the air, but he changed his sword style. He extended his senses to the ends of the sword and changed the shape of the mana he poured in. The ends and sides of the sword let out rough mana projections out into the surrounding air. Strings of air whirled around his sword as if they were clinging like a hem of thread; and each of the strings were sharpened with mana.Dozens of piercing winds flew towards Snoc.Whoosh!A small wisp of wind stroked his cheeks. However, that was only the beginning of Zich\u2019s violent assault.Slice! Slice! Slice! Slice!The thin strings of wind struck against Snoc\u2019s rock armor. Surprisingly, the hard armor split and cracked at each of the wind\u2019s strikes.Thump! Thump!Like discarded nutshell clumps on the floor, pieces of Snoc\u2019s armor fell apart and dropped to the ground. Thanks to Zich\u2019s precise control, the strings of wind didn\u2019t hit any of Snoc\u2019s vital areas; however, he showed no mercy to the rest of Snoc\u2019s body.Spurt!Blood spurted out all over Snoc\u2019s body.\u201cKuuuuah!\u201dWhen his whole armor was ripped away from his body, Snoc collapsed to the ground. After the piercing winds passed him, he was only left with sharp wounds inscribed all over this body.\u201cUh, that is, um\u2026.!\u201dSam scuttled to his feet. Seeing Snoc\u2019s pitiful state, Sam wanted to stop Zich, but he couldn\u2019t since this was a battle that could determine Snoc\u2019s life or death. Indifferent to Sam\u2019s feelings, Zich approached Snoc.Snoc\u2019s wounds were deep. Crimson blood soaked into the ground and dyed the ground a new color. However, Snoc still hadn\u2019t lost his ability to fight.\u2018Even at this moment, he is healing himself.\u2019Light wounds disappeared, and deep wounds became lighter. In addition, the bloodlust that surrounded his body was still as sharp as ever.\u2018Hm. If I beat him more than this, I think he might really die.\u201dZich\u2019s first plan of \u2018giving him a bunch of wounds to make him weak and turn his mind back to normal\u2019 failed. As if he was sticking a tree branch into a bug, Zich tried poking the ends of his sword into Snoc\u2019s body. Because Snoc responded strongly, Zich was disappointed that Snoc didn\u2019t become as weak as he wanted.\u2018Okay then, I will try plan B.\u2019Although he made plan B, it wasn\u2019t a method he really wanted to use, so Zich licked his lips. No matter how severe they were, physical wounds could be healed with high-quality potions or advanced priests.\u2018But there is no potion in the world that can heal psychological wounds.\u2019Wiiing!Zich\u2019s sword rang out. When a sword was filled up with mana, it usually rang, but this time, there was something different about it. Snoc also seemed to have noticed the difference and stared at Zich.\u2018Since it seems like he lost his senses after being psychologically attacked, I didn\u2019t want it to come down to this but\u2026\u2019But what else could Zich do when his first plan failed? Zich placed the ends of his sword into Snoc\u2019s head.\u201cPlease don\u2019t become insane.\u201dTang!Zich pierced his sword into Snoc\u2019s head. No, it was more accurate to say that he forced an image into Snoc\u2019s mind. Snoc felt as if his mind was shattering into fragments, and then his head slumped down.* * *Snoc felt as if he was dreaming a long dream. His senses began to rise, and his head became clearer and clearer. In contrast, his body drooped like it was filled up with water, and fatigue seeped into different parts of his muscles.\u201cAh!\u201dHe felt like needles were piercing all over his body, and he let out a scream without meaning to. However, his scream was short; it wasn\u2019t because he wasn\u2019t in pain anymore. It was actually the opposite: he was in so much pain that it hurt to even scream.Snoc blinked back the tears that welled up in his eyes and looked in front of him.\u201cIt\u2019s a success.\u201dHe heard a very self-satisfied voice. He didn\u2019t know who it was or where it came from, but the voice was filled with pride over their success.\u2018I think I know this voice.\u2019He had heard the voice before, and Snoc stared at the area.\u201c\u2026Mr. Zich?\u201dHe saw a familiar face.\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\u201cWhat happened\u2026?\u201d\u201cSnoc!\u201dSomebody shouted his name. He knew that voice too. Sam looked half-relieved and half-mournful; he looked ridiculous as he ran towards Snoc. Hans ran closely behind him. Sam had come running as soon as he saw Snoc come back to his senses, but Zich blocked him from coming any closer with his arms.\u201cSorry buddy, but wait a bit more. It\u2019s not over yet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not over? What is not over?\u201dSnoc couldn\u2019t understand the current situation; he didn\u2019t know why he woke up inside a mountain in the middle of the night and why Zich, Sam, and Hans were surrounding him.\u201cOk, Snoc. Let\u2019s assess the situation first. You were kidnapped. Do you remember that?\u201d\u201cKidnapped?\u201dSnoc\u2019s head ached. After he heard the word \u2018kidnapped,\u2019 little bits of memories began to come back to him. He began to remember about the black-robed man, the mine he was dragged into, and Nowem\u2019s real identity.Snoc began to fumble and squirm. He ripped apart his tattered clothes that had basically become rags and saw something embedded into his chest.\u201cIt\u2019s a sealing stone.\u201dHans and Sam looked surprised, but Zich was not surprised.\u2018Did that man fuse Nowem into Snoc\u2019s body with the sealing stone?\u2019After seeing the sealing stone, many colorful expressions appeared and passed across Snoc\u2019s face: surprise, rage, despair, sadness, and all kinds of emotions appeared. However, the last one remaining was spite.Grab!Snoc grabbed the sealing stone with his hands and put force in his fingers. It looked as if he was trying to take it out.Kick!Zich blocked Snoc\u2019s arms with his feet.\u201cWait. You probably can\u2019t even take it out, but even if you can, you shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cThen, how can I take this out?\u201dAs if it was a dirty bug, Snoc shuddered in disgust.\u201cThat thing screwed inside your chest fuses you with the beast of the earth. While ignoring both of your wills, it forces you to merge with the beast. I don\u2019t know how to forcefully take it out, but if you make an official contract with the magical beast, it will automatically drop\u2026\u201d\u201cI refuse!\u201d Snoc shouted.

Since he was able to use the magical beast\u2019s powers freely, it was natural that they would be highly compatible in personality and temperament. However, Snoc adamantly refused to form a contract.As Zich predicted, Snoc\u2019s mentality must have been greatly shaken up. He first tried to persuade Snoc gently.\u201cI don\u2019t know what exactly that man said to you, but it was part of his plan to make you go berserk. There\u2019s a high possibility that he was the one who hired Drew to trick you.\u201dWhen Zich mentioned Drew, Snoc flinched. Taking that as a good sign, Zich continued, \u201cHe probably said stuff to form a rift between you and the magical beast, but you shouldn\u2019t take any of that to heart. It wouldn\u2019t be bad for you to make a contract with\u2014\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSnoc was more stubborn than he predicted. It had been a while since Zich didn\u2019t know what to do. As Snoc\u2019s resistance continued, Sam intervened.\u201cWhat are you saying! This is not the time to act emotionally! Think of your safety first!\u201d\u201cThe only reason why you were able to get your consciousness back is because I made the berserk side of you faint. If your berserk side awakens, you will lose consciousness again.\u201dZich further supported Sam\u2019s words.\u201cYeah, listen to him! You are still not safe!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSnoc\u2019s complexion grew pale; his trembling eyes revealed his troubled heart. But Snoc was still reluctant to make a formal contract.\u2018Is there something I\u2019m missing?\u2019Snoc\u2019s reaction was too intense for a simple misunderstanding. Even with Sam\u2019s constant pestering, Snoc maintained his silence and showed his unwillingness to form a contract.\u2018No, it seems like he doesn\u2019t know what to do.\u2019Zich tilted his head and continued to think.\u2018Just judging by his reaction, it\u2019s like I asked him to make a contract with his archnemeis who killed his parents or something\u2014!\u2019At that moment, Zich recalled several pieces of information.\u2018If Nowem is really the mining monster from the myth, he must have been sealed in the Iruce Mine. And he was released from the seal for some reason.\u2019Zich didn\u2019t know how Nowem was released, but that was not the important part. The important part was what happened after the seal was released.\u2018Since he is a magical beast of the earth, a lot of the earth\u2019s energy would have been stored inside the seal. Once the seal was broken, all of the energy inside of it must have been released at once.\u2019An earthquake probably happened as a result.\u2018Earthquakes are dangerous everywhere, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s more dangerous inside a mine since the caves can collapse.\u2019Zich tried to recall a conversation he had with Sam in the bar. Sam got drunk and lamented to Zich about Snoc\u2019s sad life. It was then that Zich found out why Snoc hated working as a miner so much.\u2018If I recall properly, Snoc\u2019s dad died from a collapsed mine shaft.\u2019What if the reason for the collapse was because of Nowem\u2019s release? And what if the robed man mentally attacked Snoc with this information? No matter what the reason or direct cause was, Nowem had played a critical part in the death of Snoc\u2019s father.\u2018If this is true, no wonder Snoc is acting like this.\u2019Zich foresaw a lot of difficulties in persuading Snoc.\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201dTo confirm his predictions, Zich began to question Snoc.\u201cDid the man who kidnapped you say that Nowem was the one who killed your father?\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dSnoc\u2019s eyes shook, and his shocked face confirmed Zich\u2019s thoughts.\u2018Your father\u2019s killer\u2026 Hmmm, this is going to be hard.\u2019Zich looked towards Sam for guidance. However, Zich realized the situation had become even more complicated when he saw that Sam\u2019s face was completely frozen.\u2018Now that I remember it, Sam told me that his father also died in the same mine shaft that Snoc\u2019s father died in.\u2019That complicated the situation even more. To Snoc, Nowem not only caused his father to die but also his best friend\u2019s father to die. Zich could understand why Snoc was so adamant about not forming a contract with Nowem.Then he remembered what the robed man said: \u2018But Snoc will never be able to accept Nowem. Even if he goes over that hurdle, there would be another hurdle that he would have to go over. That\u2019s his fate that was decided before we formulated this plan.\u2019\u2018He was talking about this.\u2019Even if Snoc managed to forgive Nowem for causing his father\u2019s death, Sam was also another victim. Moreover, Sam and Snoc were as close as brothers, and Sam was the only family Snoc had. Everything was messed up.\u2018I guess it can\u2019t be helped.\u2019Forming a contract with Nowem was the best possible scenario, but Zich was not going to force Snoc to make a contract with a being that caused his father\u2019s death. On the other hand, Zich also could not leave the situation like this. After some time, Snoc would definitely go back to berserk mode again.Zich lightly swiped the handle of his sword.\u2018Will this be possible?\u2019Zich checked his amount of mana and his ability to control it.\u2018Will I be cutting it close?\u2019Sword that penetrated essence. Even among Zich\u2019s skills, it was one of his highest-level skills. If he used this skill, he could take out Nowem.\u2018But the problem is that in my current state, I might accidentally kill Snoc as well.\u2019No, there was actually a very high chance Zich might also kill him. But since Snoc was fervent about not making a contract, Zich wanted to tell him of this option.\u201cEven though this would be very dangerous for you, what if I tell you that there\u2019s a way for me to kill Nowem?\u201d\u201cW-what?\u201d Snoc stuttered in shock. Zich thought Snoc was shocked because he said it would be \u2018very dangerous for you.\u2019 In order to explain this option more in detail, Zich was about to speak, but Sam spoke first.\u201cIt\u2019s fine now.\u201dSam took one step forward. Zich was not sure, but there seemed to be determination on Sam\u2019s face. As if to fasten Snoc\u2019s face in place, Sam tightly pressed onto Snoc\u2019s cheeks. At Sam\u2019s sudden movement, Snoc was taken aback and his eyes moved around.\u201cSnoc.\u201d\u201cY-yeah?\u201d\u201cPlease answer my question honestly.\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201d\u201cYou feel attached to that magical beast, right?\u201dSnoc\u2019s eyes began to spin around in a frenzy, as if Sam\u2019s words had hit the mark.\u201cW-what are you saying! How can I feel attached to that bastard who killed our fathers\u2014!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lie. It\u2019s easy to tell when you are lying. I can tell that you are acting out even more, because you don\u2019t actually hate him.\u201d\u201cN-no, that is not true\u2026\u201dSnoc\u2019s voice grew fainter and fainter until it completely disappeared.\u201cDid he purposely kill our parents?\u201d\u201cNo, of course not!\u201dSnoc quickly denied Sam\u2019s words; he had also thought of something like that for a brief moment, but he could now confidently say no.\u201cIn my dream, I was able to see Nowem\u2019s memories for a bit! He came out only because the seal on him broke!\u201dSnoc himself was surprised that he was in such a hurry to defend Nowem. It was clear that Snoc\u2019s psychological state was unstable right now.\u201cI thought so because you would have wanted to cut him off without any hesitation.\u201dBut Sam could not just let things go.\u201cBut it still doesn\u2019t change the fact that Nowem killed our fathers.\u201dMoreover, both of their mothers died from overwork after their fathers\u2019 deaths. From their perspective, Nowem was a being that destroyed their entire families.Sam stared at Snoc. Even though Snoc was stubborn to a fault and caused some troubles, he was the only family Sam now had. As an \u201colder brother,\u201d he could not leave Snoc in his time of need. Looking at Snoc, Sam made a firm decision. He calmed his troubled heart and looked within himself if this was what he really wanted to do\u2014the answer was a resounding yes.Sam smiled at Snoc who looked as if he did not know what to do and said, \u201cI will forgive him.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to forgive Nowem.\u201dSam\u2019s low voice seeped into people\u2019s ears and lingered there. Snoc and even Zich and Hans were surprised\u2014that was how significant his words were.\u201cThat magical beast is precious to you, right? It\u2019s like he was a part of your family.\u201dSnoc would not be so troubled like this if he didn\u2019t consider Nowem a part of his family.\u201cI can\u2019t speak for you, but I\u2019m going to forgive him. So you don\u2019t have to feel guilty about me. I want you to make a decision based on your own feelings; whether or not you will accept or reject him is all up to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026How are you able to do that? How can you forgive him so easily? Nowem was the one who caused our fathers to die.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not easy. I made this decision after a lot of contemplation. You were the one who told me that he didn\u2019t cause our father\u2019s deaths on purpose. And think of your favorite song.\u201dSnoc\u2019s favorite song was about the monster (most definitely, Nowem) sealed deep inside the mines.\u201cIf he is the monster in that story, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s an okay guy. Moreover, that song has been passed down in your family for generations. Destiny might be tying you two together.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSnoc could not understand why Sam was even using destiny to persuade him. He just looked blankly up at Sam\u2019s face. Sam was about to say something more, but he closed his mouth and thought he needed to speak from his heart to persuade him.\u201cI\u2019m not making up random explanations to persuade you. I really do think this, but there is another reason why I forgave him.\u201dThen Sam said without a trace of dishonesty on his face, \u201cAs an older brother, is it so strange to want my younger brother to be happy?\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dSnoc felt as if he had been hit by a hammer on the back of his head\u2014that was how much Sam\u2019s brotherly love touched him. The tears in Sam\u2019s eyes revealed how sincere he was.\u201cWould it really be okay to\u2026\u201dSnoc began to slowly open up his heart after his brother\u2019s kind words, \u201cWould it really be okay for me to forgive Nowem? Can I accept him?\u201d\u201cI already told you I forgave him. It\u2019s all up to you. Think about what choice will make you happy and not have regrets in the future.\u201d\u201cI was really angry when I found out that Nowem caused our fathers to die. My whole mind was filled with anger. But Sam, no matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t hate him.\u201dBecause of this, it was harder for Snoc to accept him. He felt guilty to their deceased fathers and to Sam.Quietly watching the situation, Zich interrupted, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you try forming a contract first? You can sign the contract and calm your mind first, and then make a decision after you face the magical beast again. In your emotional state, there\u2019s a high possibility that if you make a decision right now, you might make a choice that you will regret in the future.\u201dMoreover, an immature person like Snoc was more likely to make a rash decision.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Sam asked again. There was newfound determination in Snoc\u2019s eyes.* * *\u201cHe will be okay, right?\u201dWith a worried expression on his face, Sam looked down at Snoc who lay still as if he was dead. Only a few moments had passed since Snoc went into sleep to face Nowem, but Sam was already worried. His frantic appearance right now completely contrasted the appearance he made when he calmly persuaded Snoc.Hans tilted his head at the two very different sides of Sam, but Zich had a better grasp of human nature.\u2018This is what makes us human.\u2019Humans could boldy throw away their own hatred and pain to say a comforting word to another person; but the next moment, they could also become meek and anxious after only a few minutes.But both of these actions had the same fundamental roots.\u2018Is it familial love?\u2019This kind of love was different from the love that Lubella tried to spread to the masses. It was a love between one individual to another; a love that could be done by anyone who treasured their family. Who could say that Sam\u2019s love was of lesser value than Lubella\u2019s?Zich could not really understand Sam\u2019s love for Snoc; he had never experienced love from a family, and he just understood it as a concept that existed in this world.\u2018But I guess it\u2019s a good sight to see.\u2019Sam looked as if he would grab the back of his neck and faint at any moment. In order to turn Sam\u2019s mind away from Snoc, Zich asked a question.\u201cHow were you able to come all the way here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201c\u2026To tell you the truth, I came here to check if the earthquake made an impact on the mine.\u201dBecause of all the crazy events that happened so far, Sam forgot why he had come to the mine in the first place.\u201cWas that earthquake also related to the magical beast?\u201d\u201cYep. But to be more specific, it\u2019s because a shitty bastard forcefully fused Snoc and the magical beast together.\u201d\u201c\u2026That shitty bastard was the one who made Snoc like this, right? What kind of bastard was he?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure that he is part of some mysterious organization, but no matter what I did, he wouldn\u2019t open his mouth so I killed him.\u201dZich really had no idea what organization the robed man had been part of, even with the memories before his regression.\u201cBut don\u2019t worry.\u201d Zich laughed, \u201cSince they\u2019ve already made me their enemy, I\u2019m going to fuck over every single one of them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so happy because I don\u2019t have to feel guilty about beating up bad guys.\u201dEven though Sam was furious at the assassins and the mysterious organization that harmed Snoc, he could not readily support Zich\u2019s words. Fortunately, the smile on Zich\u2019s face did not last long.\u201cBut couldn\u2019t you have checked up on the mines during the day? Why would you come all the way here at such a dangerous time? It\u2019s no wonder you got involved in such a dangerous situation.\u201dZich half-opened his eyes and rebuked Sam. But Sam felt more comfortable at the Zich who rebuked him rather than the Zich who smiled eerily at him.\u201cYeah, you are right.\u201dSam\u2019s voice was full of regret. It sounded as if he also thought it had been a foolish decision. But Zich could understand why Sam wanted to go check up on the mine.\u2018It\u2019s probably because of his father.\u2019Sam\u2019s father died from a collapsed mine shaft. Even though no one would be inside a mine after sunset, Sam was worried that someone could be trapped in the mines. There was a low possibility that this would happen, but Sam\u2019s trauma made it difficult for him to dismiss them as low possibilities.\u201cBut thanks to Mr. Hans, I was safe.\u201d\u201cOh yeah, I was wondering about that. Why is he here with you?\u201dHans blinked his eyes as all the attention went towards him.\u201cWhen I told him that I was going down to the mines, he told me that he could take me there.\u201d\u201cSir, while I was waiting for you, I saw Mr. Sam walk by our window. He told me he had to check up on the mine\u2026it was late in the night and because he is your friend, I thought I should escort him.\u201dAs expected of a former servant, Hans was very adept at quickly judging the situation. If Hans hadn\u2019t been there, Sam would have met his end inside a dark mountain. Moreover, it would have been a tragic end for Sam as his brother would have killed him.\u201cYou did well.\u201dZich praised Hans for his efforts. It was Hans\u2019 second compliment\u2014all on the same day. Hans felt happy that he got some praise from Zich who usually yelled and insulted him all the time. Zich scratched his chin with his fingers and snickered.\u201cBut you are also really impressive. I didn\u2019t think you would forgive him.\u201dSam was traumatized by his father\u2019s death to the point that when an explosion erupted, the first thing he did was go check up on the mines late into the night. Zich was still surprised about Sam\u2019s decision to forgive Nowem who was deeply tied to his trauma.\u201cIs that so surprising? As Snoc said, it\u2019s not like the magical beast caused the mine to collapse on purpose.\u201dFrom Zich\u2019s experience, humans acted on emotions more than reason, especially on sensitive matters like a parent\u2019s death.\u201cI would never be able to forgive that magical beast if he did it on purpose, but that\u2019s not what happened. Snoc would also never side with a being like that. I also thought it was fate as well.\u201d\u201cFate\u2026\u201d Zich repeated Sam\u2019s unexpected mention of fate. \u201cWhat do you mean by fate? When you were talking to Snoc about it, you mentioned fate when you were talking about a song, right?\u201d\u201cYou probably also know that song. It\u2019s a song about a monster sealed inside the Iruce Mine. It\u2019s famous everywhere around Suol.\u201d\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Zich nodded his head. \u201cBut wasn\u2019t that song a warning to fear the Mining Monster? I don\u2019t think there was anything about fate in that song.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s actually another version to it.\u201dSam opened up one of his fingers.\u201cThis is a song passed down by Snoc\u2019s family, and his parents used to sing this version. In this version, there are actually a few more verses at the end. Snoc and I liked this version of the song more than the one spread around in the city.\u201dSam used to sing that song whenever he felt like it, and Snoc sang that song whenever he was sad or hurt to comfort himself.\u201cI don\u2019t know which one is the original version. But if the version passed down in Snoc\u2019s family is the original version, and one of Snoc\u2019s ancestors preserved this song and passed it along to their descendants, it would not be far-fetched to say that Snoc and Nowem are destined for each other.\u201d\u201cWhat is the song?\u201dZich became curious after hearing so much about it.\u201cShould I try singing it?\u201dSam inhaled a deep breath and began singing. His voice echoed under the dark sky, in a messy and demolished mountainside wrecked by battle.* * *Snoc opened his eyes. All he saw was desolate earth. It was a completely different view from the mountain top.\u2018Wow, this really is possible.\u2019Snoc looked around in curiosity. From what Zich said, he was in Nowem\u2019s mind. No matter how compatible someone was, going inside another being\u2019s mind was extremely difficult. But Snoc and Nowem were forcefully fused. Their special circumstances greatly lowered this barrier to the extent that Snoc just had to follow Zich\u2019s directions and want to go inside Nowem\u2019s mind.\u2018Where is Nowem?\u2019As expected of a beast of the earth, only dirt and ground existed in Nowem\u2019s mind. From his feet and to the ends of the horizon, Snoc only saw earth. There was not even a single weed, a trace of a stream, an insect, or anything. Snoc felt overwhelmed by the vastness of the earth. He didn\u2019t even know where to start looking for Nowem.However, contrary to his feelings, Snoc\u2019s footsteps were light.\u2018I think it\u2019s here.\u2019As his heart stirred, it seemed to tell him the directions of a place. His feet didn\u2019t stop for a moment. He climbed on top of the nearest hill next to him and saw a cave inside a gentle slope. Snoc went inside. The cave was pitch-dark, but strangely, Snoc had no difficulty seeing the insides of the cave. Snoc tilted his head as he wandered inside the cave.\u2018Isn\u2019t this our mine?\u2019The structure and support systems were the same. The remains on the walls and traces of digging were also the same, and Snoc\u2019s footsteps became a bit lighter. Snoc continued to go deeper inside the cave and stopped in front of a pit. He stared at the pit for some time. This was where his father died.After letting out a deep breath, Snoc entered the pit. After the roof-fall, the entrance was open and clean. Snoc passed over the area and continued walking. He did not have to walk far to reach the end of the pit; and in front of him, he found what he was looking for.\u201cNowem.\u201dNowem was lying down on his stomach, and he opened his eyes. When he saw Snoc, he bared his teeth. Nowem\u2019s reddened eyes indicated that he was still under the influence of the sealing stone. Although Zich had warned him that this could be the case, physically seeing Nowem in this state pained his heart.\u201c\u2026Nowem.\u201dSnoc tried calling his name again. Just a couple of hours ago, he had no trouble calling out Nowem\u2019s name, but now, the name felt unfamiliar to his lips.Kuuuurgh!Nowem made a loud cry. Just a moment ago, it seemed as if Nowem had cried out in happiness to welcome Snoc. Nowem\u2019s cry now was strange and filled with hostility, but Snoc remained calm.\u201cHey.\u201dSnoc barely managed to open his mouth; he felt as if he was forcefully trying to open a sealed door, or as if he was forcefully opening a blocked stream inside a mountain belt.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dHis first words were an apology. It was the only way he could start talking.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for trying to push you away. I\u2019m sorry for ignoring you too. I\u2019m sorry for everything.\u201dAfter the first couple of words, everything else flowed out easily.\u201cI was resentful and angry at you. I was confused after hearing that you were the reason for our fathers\u2019 deaths. And I also felt guilty. If I kept staying by your side, I thought I would be sinning against my father, Sam\u2019s father, and Sam. I felt like this because Sam is a brother and a family member to me.\u201dSnoc met Nowem\u2019s eyes.\u201cLike you are to me.\u201dNowem\u2019s eyes were still glaring at Snoc. It seemed like Snoc\u2019s words weren\u2019t reaching him, but Snoc didn\u2019t linger on his disappointment.\u201cBut you know, I can\u2019t seem to stay mad at you. As people say, is it because our mana properties are so compatible?\u201dHonestly, Snoc was a bit disgruntled that the reason why he felt great attachment for Nowem wasn\u2019t because of the time they spent together or the faith they had in each other, but for some innate reason. However, it wasn\u2019t as if someone had forced or brainwashed them to feel these emotions.\u201cBut I still can\u2019t accept you. Even if you didn\u2019t do it on purpose, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the earthquake you caused was the reason for our fathers\u2019 deaths. However, Sam said that he forgave you.\u201dIt was his \u2018brother\u2019s\u2019 precious apology that Snoc was able to find the courage to continue.\u201cStill, I can\u2019t act the same as before when I didn\u2019t know anything. So, Nowem, let\u2019s think about what would be best for us.\u201dWith firm resolution, Snoc reached out his hand that had been previously used to push away Nowem; with his movement, Nowem\u2019s eyes moved towards his stretched-out hand. Would he react to Snoc\u2019s sincerity? Sweat collected on Snoc\u2019s palms.Kuuuurgh!Snoc\u2019s expectations and hopes were completely shattered. Nowem continued to growl while baring his teeth, and it didn\u2019t seem like he would regain his senses any time soon. Perhaps, it was because Snoc had turned away from Nowem\u2019s tears when the robed man told him the truth. Snoc became overcome with grief.However, Snoc gritted his teeth and calmed his shaking heart. He still had a chance.\u2018Sam told me that my meeting with Nowem might be fate.\u2019The song that his father and mother had taught him since his childhood was proof that they were fated to meet each other. His vocal cords rang, and a voice flowed out. It sang with rhythmic beats and changing tones. Snoc\u2019s skills didn\u2019t compare to professional singers, and he kept singing out of tune and going slightly offbeat. Yet, everything else was steady and clearly indicated how often Snoc sang this song.\u201cAn ancient being filled with wrath comes down upon us like a tidal wave. It\u2019s a disaster that has never been seen before. People shiver in fear at his presence. His name is synonymous with fear.\u201dIt was a song that invoked fear towards the beast of the earth. Everyone in Suol, including Snoc, thought that the song had been spread to prevent children from entering the mine. After all, the lyrics were unpleasant.Nowem\u2019s eyes turned menacing. Snoc succeeded in pulling out a response from Nowem, but he wasn\u2019t happy about it since the response was on the negative side. However, Snoc\u2019s song didn\u2019t end there.\u201cBut the ancient being seals himself for the sake of his friend\u2019s happiness.\u201dThese were lines that were passed down only by Snoc\u2019s family and showed another side to the mining monster, which had always been a subject of great fear.\u201cWith each passing night, the ancient being swallows his sadness and with a hopeful heart, falls into slumber.\u201dSnoc sang out the last line like he was breathing out a sigh.\u201cDreaming that the happy future his friend spoke of would soon arrive.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA memory from long ago came flooding into his mind. What he remembered most clearly was a woman. Before he was sealed, she was the first and final person he made a contract with. However, she wasn\u2019t just someone he formed a contract with. She was the first being he met right after his birth, his precious friend, and someone who showed Nowem a whole new world.Yet, their ending was tragic.In his desire to protect and form a more special relationship with her, he unconsciously formed a contract with her. However, a magical beast\u2019s special mana was the same as poison to a normal person. Succumbing to the immense power of the earth, she began to grow ill like cracked, dry soil; and because her body rejected his mana, she began to lose her mind and went out of control from time to time.Soon, she became a symbol of fear among humans. However, it was impossible to break the contract. It was an absolute contract, decided from his birth, and it could only end if one of them died. Still, she didn\u2019t resent him.On the other hand, Nowem tried to kill himself many times. He thought he should be the one to die if one of them had to die, but she stopped him. She threatened him and said that if he died, she would kill herself right after. Thus, the two traveled all around the world to find a way to break the contract.After they went through all kinds of suffering and trials, they finally found a method: it was a seal; an immensely strong one that could cancel the contract that bound them together. Although sealing himself meant their separation was unavoidable, that was the only method they could find. Moreover, they didn\u2019t have enough time\u2014her skin was like an old, oak tree, her hair was brittle, and her eyes were muddy. There was no trace of the vibrant and bright energy she used to carry herself with. The only thing that was the same was her smile while she patted him.[It\u2019s time for us to separate.]She didn\u2019t have much time left. She was against the sealing, but Nowem insisted. He wanted her to enjoy a peaceful time, even if it was for a short period. While she shed her tears, the smile on her lips didn\u2019t disappear.[You will definitely meet your soulmate in the future.] She whispered to him. [You won\u2019t meet someone who lacks skills like me. A person who will be able to accept all your powers will definitely appear in front of you. So don\u2019t give up. Please find your happiness.]Her sincere feelings touched Nowem\u2019s heart. She hugged Nowem and felt his soft fur, small body, and temperature that was slightly higher than a human\u2019s as if she was trying to imprint these senses on her body. Then she sang a soothing song. They didn\u2019t know when it began, but there was a song spreading across the world. The song denounced Nowem and the lyrics were filled with fear and resentment towards him.[If we solve this issue, let\u2019s travel around the world. We can do a lot of good deeds and change the lyrics of the song.]After listening to the song, she said this to him. However, they failed. Just like it was before, she and Nowem remained symbols of fear. It wasn\u2019t a long one so the song soon ended, but she spoke again with a mischievous tone.[Although I couldn\u2019t change the song about you, I am going to let people know that you aren\u2019t just a scary being. Since a song about your horror is spreading, I will also use a song to tell people about you.]Then, she made an oath with her hoarse voice.[Even if people don\u2019t believe me or the song doesn\u2019t spread, I will continue to try. If I get a family and have children, I will teach them this song. So, even if there\u2019s only one person left to sing this song, I will make sure that there is a song that invokes love and hope in your name. And this song will ring all over the world!]Then she began singing again. Her song was the opposite of the song that talked of his horrors. It was so dreamlike that its lyrics seemed to capture all of his emotions and hope, and with her smiling face, the song embedded itself into a deep corner of Nowem\u2019s heart. Like that, Nowem was sealed.While he was asleep, he dreamed the same dreams. It was a bittersweet dream that pictured what would happen if he wasn\u2019t sealed and continued to live a peaceful life with her; and while he was dreaming, he was fully aware that he was in a dream and knew that it was a future that would never come. That was probably why\u2026[You won\u2019t meet someone who lacks skills like me. A person who can accept all your powers will definitely appear in front of you. So don\u2019t give up. Please find your happiness.]\u2026These words echoed inside his mind.* * *The redness in Nowem\u2019s eyes began to disappear. His sharp teeth and toenails sucked back in, and he stopped his constant growling. Nowem just stared at Snoc who was helplessly singing a song on and on.Although many parts had changed over the years, Snoc\u2019s song was definitely what Nowem had heard before his sealing. The beginning part of the song was the same as what people had sung in their resentment and fear at Nowem.It was a song he couldn\u2019t ever get used to. Thus, even while he lost his senses, he felt a familiar sense of loathing and growled. However, the amplification of his loathing stopped as the song continued. The song wasn\u2019t like he remembered; the lyrics and melodies of the song had been altered. Yet, it was like the song she sang before his sealing: the general melody, lyrics, and the sense of attachment towards him were the same.[Didn\u2019t I promise you?]Even though it had been a long time since her death, it was as if she was still talking to him. Like a mischievous child who succeeded with her prank, she seemed to smile upon him. However, that smile would soon change into a soft one\u2014just like the one she specially reserved for him.[I told you that I would spread it even if I have to use my children.]The violent energy that poured out all over his body soon began to wane. His mad eyes soon began to reflect the figure in front of him: Snoc. He was the human Nowem met after he broke out of his seal and the person who possessed the same energy as him. From his blurry vision, Nowem saw Snoc overlap with the images he had of her.* * *The day was bright. As if the fierce battle that took place last night had all been a lie, birds chirped, and the sky was bright blue and filled with clouds. However, in contrast to nature that began its morning routine like usual, the humans were noisy and chaotic. It was because of the mysterious roaring sounds from last night.Basically, no one in Suol had a pleasant sleep last night. A support team was quickly established and sent to investigate the mine. Several government employees, experts, and troops went up, and those with strong nerves and curiosity followed them from behind. Of course, the investigation team blocked the mine\u2019s surroundings, so outsiders couldn\u2019t go inside the scene of the incident and stroll around the area.The mine was blocked for the time being. Even if mining was the city\u2019s most important business, they couldn\u2019t push ahead with mine work while the remains of an intense battle were still present. Considering the city\u2019s position, they couldn\u2019t block it for long, and the city mobilized a great number of resources and manpower into investigating last night\u2019s incident.If they knew Zich and Snoc were involved in the case last night, things would get extremely bothersome for both of them. People could even rally against Nowem and treat him as a threat to the city\u2019s safety. Thus, Zich made his decision without any hesitation\u2014to act like they didn\u2019t know anything.\u201cSir, we came back!\u201d\u201cWe came back.\u201dThe entrance opened and Sam and Hans came inside. As if they spent a lot of their energy, they looked weary, but both of their expressions looked relieved.\u201cHow was it?\u201d\u201cI just kept saying that I didn\u2019t know anything about what happened last night,\u201d Sam answered. Hans nodded his head strongly as if he just completed a mission.\u201cWill this really be all right?\u201dThe investigation team had requested for their cooperation. Unlike Zich or the assassins, Sam and Hans had gotten permission from the gatekeeper last night to go past the fortress\u2019s gates, so there was even evidence that they were at the mine during the time of the incident. This was the reason why the investigation team requested Sam and Hans\u2019 help as possible witnesses.And although they \u201crequested\u201d help, it wasn\u2019t a request that they could refuse\u2014especially for Sam who had to continue living in the city. Therefore, both of them cooperated with the investigation but didn\u2019t tell the truth as they already promised Zich that they would keep their mouths shut.\u201cDid you tell them what I taught you?\u201d\u201cYeah. I told them that I heard a loud noise while climbing, so I stopped walking in the middle of the mine. I also told them that I hid in a bush until the noise stopped because I was scared.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. Out of hope, they asked you guys just in case anyway. I don\u2019t know about Hans, but why would they suspect someone with a definite identity like a miner? And Hans went to guard you anyways. I cleaned up after us well too.\u201dHe might not have been able to erase all traces of battle, but it was an easy task for Zich to tamper with his surroundings. He had a lot of experience with this before his regression.\u201cI guess so.\u201d\u201cI scattered the corpses of the guys who caused this incident. And I also used Drew\u2019s corpse that I found by accident to create a plausible scenario. They can\u2019t follow up on us.\u201dAfter Zich explained his work in detail, Sam felt relieved. However, he wasn\u2019t completely relieved and took out a chair and sat on it with his shaking legs.\u201cI don\u2019t want to do something like this ever again.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun if you get used to it.\u201dThe investigation team would probably also come to Zich. Since he left Drew\u2019s corpse sprawled out at the scene of the incident, they would probably find out about the trouble with Drew, Zich, Snoc, and Sam. Yet, even if they did that, Snoc and Sam had been the victims and were ordinary miners. They would probably be only suspicious of Zich.\u201cDon\u2019t think I am like you. I am going to live a normal life where I just have to dig mines.\u201d\u201cPeasant bastard.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the perfect life I want.\u201dAs they shared this useless conversation, Sam\u2019s anxiety began to fade away completely. He began to laugh more and stopped shaking his legs. Seeing that Sam calmed down, Zich went onto the next topic.\u201cOkay then, let\u2019s talk about those guys.\u201dZich\u2019s eyes landed on Snoc who was sitting with a slight hunch with Nowem in his arms. Nowem\u2019s eyes rolled around and felt the surrounding atmosphere. His sensitive senses, which were the characteristics of magical beasts, deciphered the mood of his surroundings, and he could sense that a conversation that would be very important to him would soon take place.Koo.While letting out a low cry, he looked up at Snoc who was hugging him. He saw Snoc\u2019s determined face as if Snoc had firmly decided on something.\u201cFirst of all, it doesn\u2019t seem like Nowem will get out of control anymore. What\u2019s left is the bitter feelings between you two, and your plans with Nowem.\u201d\u201cI already told you before that I forgave him.\u201d Sam spoke without any hesitation in his response. As if he finished organizing all his thoughts perfectly, there wasn\u2019t even a slight tremble in his tone.\u201cYes, I am impressed by your response, but the problem is both of your emotions.\u201dTrue to Zich\u2019s words, Snoc\u2019s face wasn\u2019t bright. Guilt was written all over his face like it would rub off if someone wiped it with a white cloth.\u201cI am really grateful for Sam\u2019s words of forgiveness, but it\u2019s true that Nowem caused our fathers\u2019 deaths. So, I also don\u2019t think we can get over it with just our words.\u201dSnoc\u2019s voice was so soft and tiny\u2014it sounded like a mouse crawling on the floor. However, everyone understood what he meant. Sam looked awkward, and although he didn\u2019t feel any regret for saying that he forgave Nowem, he could also understand Snoc\u2019s feelings. Human emotions were extremely complex.It was at that point Zich intervened, \u201cThen, how about doing kind acts from now on?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDoing kind acts.\u201dZich walked towards Snoc and grabbed his shoulders.\u201cIt makes you uncomfortable that Nowem is being forgiven without any consequences. Then you just have to make him pay. Make him pay for his wrongs until both of you are satisfied.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that he should pay for his wrongdoings by doing kind acts?\u201d\u201cOf course. What is the first thing that criminals do when they atone for their sins in religious institutions? It\u2019s helping others. Doing kind acts is one of the best ways to forgive yourself. There\u2019s really nothing like it to cover your past wrongdoings.\u201dSam didn\u2019t agree with the way Zich framed \u2018helping others\u2019 as if it was a tool, but Zich was not wrong. Sam began pondering again.\u201cIn order for this to work, it\u2019s most important for you to believe in it. No matter what others say, you have to believe this will work for you.\u201d\u201cThen are you telling Snoc to help orphanages or give to struggling people\u2014things like that?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dSam blinked his eyes at Zich\u2019s strong denial.\u201cNowem is the one who did wrong. He has to use Nowem\u2019s power.\u201dNowem\u2019s power. Sam trembled a bit as he recalled Snoc\u2019s appearance when he went berserk. To him, the magical beast of the earth\u2019s power was enormous.\u201c\u2026Then what should I do?\u201dSnoc had been looking at Zich straight in the eyes since Zich mentioned \u2018doing kind acts.\u2019\u201cYou told me you hated being a miner, right? You told me you wanted to go on an adventure.\u201d Zich smirked. \u201cThen do what you want.\u201d\u201cAre you telling me to go on an adventure?\u201dSnoc and Sam were shocked by Zich\u2019s unexpected answer.\u201cBut it\u2019s too dangerous for Snoc! Didn\u2019t you also say so in the past?\u201d\u201cYeah, but that was then. Now, he has Nowem.\u201dKoo?Nowem\u2019s face moved here and there as he heard his name being mentioned.\u201cIf Snoc learns how to use Nowem\u2019s powers properly, monsters in the mountainside or bandits in the streets would no longer pose a threat to him. Follow me. I can make it so that you can freely use your skills.\u201dZich\u2019s \u2018What you gonna do?\u2019 attitude made Snoc also fall into deep thought.It was not a bad offer. If he used Nowem\u2019s strength to do kind acts, he felt that he could fully accept and forgive Nowem. Moreover, he\u2019d be able to become the adventurer he had always dreamed about.Snoc asked Nowem, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dKoo! Nowem gave an affirmative answer. Even to people who could not understand him, they could see that he was fully supportive of Zich\u2019s idea.[After we fix this problem, let\u2019s travel all around the world. Let\u2019s do a lot of good deeds and change the song for the better.]Nowem felt as if he could still hear his friend\u2019s voice. Even though a long time had passed and she was no longer alive, Nowem could keep his promise with her if he traveled around. There was not a single reason for Nowem to refuse this offer.\u2018It\u2019s been decided.\u2019After he saw that Nowem was also supportive of his plan, Zich nodded his head. Even though Sam looked unsatisfied, he would agree with them in the end.\u2018Okay, I can end this matter for now. Let\u2019s see, next\u2026\u2019Zich\u2019s gaze became sharp.\u2018I have to see how the assassin organization reacts.\u2019The organization probably had an impressive information network. They knew about Snoc\u2019s special mana properties and Nowem\u2019s release from his seal. They were also able to use Drew to make Snoc and Nowem meet.\u2018And that\u2019s not only it.\u2019No matter how compatible Snoc and Nowem were, it was very rare for someone to know how to forcefully transfuse a human and a magical beast.\u2018It would be good if they try to retaliate from the corpses I spread around. It would also be good if the high officials in Suol find out anything from the assassin\u2019s corpses.\u2019But contrary to Zich\u2019s hopes, the organization showed no signs of movement at all.* * *\u201cI\u2019m going!\u201dSnoc waved his hands. Nowem, who was also in Snoc\u2019s arms, also cutely squealed out \u2018Koo!\u2019 They stood on a street that was next to the city walls. Zich and Hans were finally able to leave Suol, and Sam came out to say goodbye.Zich stared at Snoc\u2014his new traveling companion. Snoc looked as if he was overjoyed from being able to finally fulfill his dream.\u2018Now, he\u2019s not going to become a Tyrant of the Earth anymore. With my intervention, history has changed.\u2019Zich was satisfied despite not being able to fulfill his original mission of defeating the Tyrant of the Earth.\u2018The timing of when the Tyrant of the Earth comes out has passed. Since I stopped the Tyrant of the Earth from appearing and stopped Suol from being devastated, I definitely did a kind act.\u2019And even in the rare chance that Snoc really did change into the Tyrant of the Earth later on, Zich could kill him at any moment\u2014that was one of the reasons why Zich wanted to bring Snoc along.\u2018And I also got another baggage carrier.\u2019\u201cListen well to Zich and don\u2019t cause trouble because you are too excited, okay?\u201dSam held onto Snoc and warned him about many different things. His expression seemed a bit sad. Zich thought Sam must be lonely now that his younger brother was going off into the world.But Zich didn\u2019t intervene; this was something for Sam to solve by himself. It wasn\u2019t Zich\u2019s place to say anything when they were about to leave. For a while, Sam continued nagging and made sure that Snoc didn\u2019t forget anything again and again. Even though Snoc tried to be patient since they wouldn\u2019t be able to see each other for a while, he reached his limits. It was only after Snoc finally showed he was fed up that Sam stopped his endless nagging.\u201cThen let\u2019s get going now.\u201d Zich said his farewell.\u201cThank you for a lot of things. I\u2019m fortunate to have a friend like you.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m a hard fortune to come across. You should be careful from now on. You might have used up all your luck to meet me, so now only misfortune might come to you.\u201d\u201cI will make sure to be careful.\u201dSam would even miss Zich\u2019s playful boasts. Sam grabbed Zich\u2019s hand and smirked.\u201cI\u2019m leaving now.\u201dWith these words, Zich left the city with Hans and Snoc. For a long time, Sam watched their backs move further away. Snoc turned back and met Sam\u2019s eyes, and Hans also looked back once. But Zich did not turn back even once.Sam saw Hans say something to Zich. Was Hans telling Zich that he was still watching them? But then he saw Zich hit the back of Hans\u2019 head. Even from a distance, it looked like a hard swing. Snoc flinched and Hans grabbed the back of his head and struggled to compose himself. But after that punch, Hans no longer looked back. Snoc also did not look back even once.\u2018That cold-hearted punk.\u2019Was that how travelers said their goodbyes? Sam put his hand on his hips and let out a sigh; then he smirked.\u2018I should get going.\u2019Sam burned the image of Snoc clumsily walking away in his mind.[Do you admire Zich?]Sam recalled a conversation he recently had with Snoc.[Yep. He\u2019s a person I thought was only real in my dreams.]Zich was strong and free-spirited. Even though he said he was not an adventurer, the actions he showed to Sam and Snoc were enough to make Snoc\u2019s heart quicken in excitement.[As we go through this journey, I\u2019m planning to make him my role model.][I think that will be very hard.][Yeah, I also think so.]No matter how many experiences he gained, it would be very hard for Snoc to become like Zich. But Snoc was not disheartened.[I finally have a way to make my dreams a reality. If I combine my strengths with Nowem\u2019s, I think we can definitely fulfill my dreams of becoming an adventurer.]Nowem made a loud cry and supported Snoc\u2019s words.[If you think that, I have nothing more to say. I will cheer you on.]Sam no longer had anything to say against Snoc\u2019s dreams. But he wanted to say at least this.[But try not to learn his attitude.][\u2026I don\u2019t think I can learn his attitude even if I wanted to.]Sam burst into laughter as he recalled Snoc\u2019s silly expression. As if all the tumultuous events that happened recently were all lies, the vast sky above Suol was blue and perfectly clear.* * *Zich\u2019s group slowly walked down the street. Hans stared at their new companion. Snoc was looking around with sparkling eyes. Anyone could see that he was full of anticipation about their journey.\u2018So pitiful.\u2019Hans felt pity for him as he knew that Snoc\u2019s excitement would be crushed in the near future. As Hans continued to look at Snoc with pity, he also saw Nowem on Snoc\u2019s shoulder.\u2018I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s the magical beast of the earth.\u2019The magical beast was the basis of Snoc\u2019s strength when he went berserk. Hans gulped, thinking back on how he had to deal with Snoc during that time.\u2018It was really incredible.\u2019Even though Hans had been burdened with Sam, Snoc was able to push Hans to the extremes. On the other hand, Zich easily defeated Snoc in his berserk mode. Recalling this memory, Hans was amazed at Zich. Then, he also remembered how Zich beat the crap out of Snoc without any hesitation and shivered at Zich\u2019s awful personality.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201dHans had unconsciously started to stare at Zich. When Zich frowned, Hans jumped back in surprise.\u201cI-I just\u2026\u201dIf he didn\u2019t reply, he would be in bigger trouble. Hans decided to utilize recent incidents to make his excuse.\u201cIs it not a pity? Mr. Zich, other people won\u2019t know the kind acts you did.\u201dNice! Hans thought he made up a good excuse; he even used Zich\u2019s obsession with doing kind acts.\u201cI mean\u2026 wasn\u2019t what you did this time the same as protecting an entire city? If people found out about what you did, you would be praised by everyone in Suol.\u201dThey would praise Zich like the time Zich helped defeat the Bellid.\u2018But I guess it can\u2019t be helped.\u2019Hans was the one who asked this question, but he knew what the answer would be. Snoc was related to this incident. In order to protect him, they had to make sure this incident didn\u2019t come out and that was the type of answer Hans expected.However, the answer that came out of Zich was completely different.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about receiving praises.\u201dHans blinked his eyes a few times.\u201cI\u2019m not doing this because I want to be praised. It doesn\u2019t matter to me whether or not people praise, envy, despise, or even hate me.\u201d\u201cT-then why are you doing kind acts?\u201dZich started doing kind acts because of Glen Zenard\u2019s last words to him. However, Glen\u2019s words had only been a trigger. There was only one reason why Zich did kind acts.\u201cIt\u2019s because I want to.\u201dThere was no other reason than this. Hans was quiet. Zich\u2019s commitment was like that of a righteous hero who helped others without wanting people\u2019s praises or profit. Because of his playful attitude, Hans thought that Zich was just using his outrageous strength to \u2018play hero\u2019 like a child playing games. But maybe he had been wrong about Zich after all.\u201cThen sir, you weren\u2019t doing this with a light heart?\u201d Hans asked carefully while gulping his saliva. As soon as he said these words out loud, he closed his eyes. It felt as if Zich was going to punch him at any moment. But Hans was much too curious about this question. Fortunately, a fist didn\u2019t come flying towards him. Instead, Zich replied without much thought.\u201cI am doing this with a light heart.\u201d\u2018As expected.\u2019As Hans expected, Zich was just playing hero. He didn\u2019t know why, but he was a bit disappointed at Zich. He pouted his lips.\u201cSir, I\u2019m envious of you. Because you are so strong, you are able to get into dangerous situations with a light heart.\u201dAs soon as he said this, Hans flinched. Because Zich wasn\u2019t as harsh with him before and because of his disappointment, he spoke way more than he should have. Hans thought he would definitely get punched this time\u2014no, it probably wouldn\u2019t end with a punch. Hans filled with anxiety.But what came back towards him wasn\u2019t violence but a conversation.\u201cI\u2019m not doing kind acts because I\u2019m strong.\u201dHans stared at Zich.\u201cI\u2019ve been getting involved with a lot of things, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the strongest yet. The guy who forcefully transfused Nowem and Snoc was honestly stronger than me.\u201dIf he was in his Demon Lord days, he would have said he was the strongest without a single moment of hesitation, but he was very \u201cweak\u201d right now.\u201cIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m strong. It\u2019s because I want to do kind acts. Even if I meet my end doing this, I don\u2019t care.\u201dDoing what he wanted\u2026 Even before he regressed, it was the one force that moved him. Zich didn\u2019t speak with gravity or extravagance. Instead, his words were plain and simple. However, it was because he spoke so plainly that they sounded more honest.\u201c\u2026Is that so?\u201dHans felt his heart quicken. It was the same feeling he got when his mom gave him the book about a hero\u2019s journey. It was the same excitement he felt when he first read that book.Snoc, who had been quietly listening, also looked excited, and his eyes sparkled again. He felt as if he had definitely picked the right person. Snoc also felt his heart beating faster and squeezed Nowem in his arms tightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only the sound of various creatures moving around could be heard, and the serene flood spread calm energy around its surroundings as if it was being considerate of the forest\u2019s silence. However, the silence that seemed like it would last a thousand years was mercilessly broken by a few uninvited guests.Crash!The air vibrated and the ground shook. Mysterious birds resting on the trees bolted away in surprise.Crash!With another explosion, several trees fell. In the middle of the flood, a large hole appeared. Under the blue sky, the ground underneath the flood appeared in clear view.A battle was in full swing. Hans and Snoc paired up to attack Zich together. Hans swung his sword sharply, and Snoc made a towering pile of earth to strike Zich. However, Zich evaded and destroyed all of their attacks.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201dHans flew off after being hit on the cheek with a scabbard, and Snoc fell down after receiving a kick to the stomach.\u201cYou bastards! Why aren\u2019t you attacking me properly! Did you forget everything I\u2019ve taught you!\u201dSnoc and Hans hurriedly got up from Zich\u2019s shout, but they immediately grew pale as a blue sword flew towards them. Hans raised his sword to protect himself and Snoc raised another earth barrier.Crash! Crash!Zich\u2019s sword landed on Hans\u2019 sword and Snoc\u2019s barrier; they both let out a scream.\u201cFirst, you!\u201d In an instant, Zich stood in front of Hans and kicked him. \u201cI told you to distribute your strength! Is there nothing going inside your mind when you stand still while blocking my sword! Are you that type of person? Thoughtless punks who only live in the moment and don\u2019t think at all about the future? Even those bastards think for at least one second, you stupid fuck!\u201dHans rolled on the ground.\u201cAnd you!\u201dIt was now Snoc\u2019s turn to be scolded. He had been coughing while protecting himself with a dirt covering.\u201cIn a fight, you have to always keep track of your opponent. Are you so stupid to block your path of sight with a dirt wall? How are you going to track your opponent without your eyes!\u201dCrash!Snoc also got kicked and rolled on the ground.\u201cAnd you!\u201d Before Snoc fell down, Zich caught Nowem and growled at him. \u201cYou fucking mole! Are you just a tool that gives this idiot some power? I told you to take advantage of your magical beast properties! Whether you collaborate with him or create a diversion, participate in the battle too, you bastard! What\u2019s the use of making a contract!\u201dAnd Zich also threw Nowem with great force.Koooooo!\u201cAh! Nowem!\u201dNowem\u2019s screams sounded sad as he flew across the air. Snoc scurried to where Nowem was.\u201cYou useless bastards! Come at me again! I\u2019m going to fix all of your idiotic behaviors today!\u201dZich began to wield his sword again. Even though Zich was controlling his strength, he showed no mercy. Hans, Snoc, and even Nowem screamed out loud and frantically tried to survive. Once again, the sounds of their battle echoed across the forest.* * *Crack! Crack!The fire crackled in the light and spread warmth to everyone like a kind mother embracing her children. But the surrounding humans had no leisure to feel grateful for its warmth.\u201cUghhhh!\u201dLying on top of a pile of leaves, Snoc let out a cry of pain. His whole body ached.Koo\u2026 Koo\u2026Nowem, who was behind Snoc, also lay down in the same position as Snoc and let out a cry of pain.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cAh, I feel as if I\u2019m barely clinging onto life.\u201dSnoc barely managed to lift his head and stared up at Hans. Nowem also looked up at Hans.\u201cBut senior, what about you? Are you okay?\u201dSnoc called Hans his \u2018senior\u2019 because Hans had been with Zich earlier than him. Whenever Snoc called him senior, Hans felt embarrassed and ticklish, but it was not a bad feeling to be called senior so he didn\u2019t stop Snoc.\u201cOf course not. How can I be okay?\u201dHans made the fire bigger and twisted his body in an exaggerated manner. Just moving his body was painful, and Hans frowned from the pain.\u201cI just got used to it. Sir Zich doesn\u2019t go easy at all even during training.\u201d\u201cEven if I get used to it, I don\u2019t think I can keep going.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t think you can do it?\u201d Hans laughed. The light from the fire and the surrounding darkness made Hans\u2019 smile look dark and twisted. \u201cI also thought that too. But Sir Zich made it possible for me to keep going.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound too comforting\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not to console you. I\u2019m just teaching you about the reality of your future.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSnoc slammed his face into his blanket. Likewise, Nowem slammed his face into the edge of Snoc\u2019s clothes.\u201cI didn\u2019t know it would be this hard. When he trained us in Suol, he wasn\u2019t this tough.\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201dIt was not Hans who replied. Snoc immediately lifted his head.Thud!Something fell next to the bonfire\u2014it was a huge deer. Snoc stared at the deer for a bit and then quickly got up.\u201cS-sir, h-have you come back?!\u201dSnoc acted like an underling of a mob boss. At Snoc\u2019s sudden movement, Nowem fell on the ground with a hard thud and screamed, \u201cKoo!\u201dAs Zich sat next to the bonfire, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pay attention to me. Do whatever you want during your break.\u201dSnoc looked sideways at Hans. Were these words trustworthy?Hans nodded in reply; Zich really didn\u2019t care what they did during their breaks. Even if they snored loudly, Zich didn\u2019t get annoyed at all. With Hans\u2019 nod, Snoc let his body relax, but he couldn\u2019t let himself completely lie down in front of Zich. At the same time, Nowem tried hard to get back on top of Snoc\u2019s clothes again.\u201cLet\u2019s skin it.\u201dHans took out his dagger and called out to Snoc. It was one of Hans and Snoc\u2019s duties to skin the animals for cooking. Snoc struggled to move from the pain but managed to awkwardly help Hans skin the deer. Zich, who had been lying down and watching them work, said, \u201cAre you complaining because the training got tougher than when you were at Suol?\u201d\u201cNo! Of course not!\u201dWhile taking out the organs of the deer and scowling, Snoc hurriedly denied Zich\u2019s words.But Zich continued, \u201cIt was because of Sam. Even I would even feel guilty if I trained you like crazy in front of your family.\u201dGuilt\u2014a word that was far from Zich\u2019s personality came out of his mouth. But Hans focused on quietly cutting up the deer; he had the exemplary attitude of a trained lackey.\u201cYou don\u2019t know how frustrated I was that I could only train you lightly at that time\u2026\u201d\u2018That was lightly training me?!\u2019Snoc was shocked, because the training at Suol was enough for him to cough out blood. On the other hand, compared to the training today, the training at Suol really was light.At Zich\u2019s words, Hans also thought, \u2018No wonder his training seemed different.\u2019No matter how he looked at it, Snoc\u2019s training at Suol seemed so much easier than his usual training.\u2018I thought it was because of Snoc\u2019s special circumstances as a magical beast contractor, but I guess that was not it.\u2019Hans sent a sympathetic look towards Snoc. The skewered meat pieces on top of the fire began to expand. Snoc\u2019s mouth salivated as he watched the oil from the meat drop one by one. He wiped the saliva that was about to spill out of his mouth. Hans expertly turned around the skewered meat to not burn it and then asked, \u201cSir, may I ask where our next destination is?\u201dEven though it seemed like they were going to stay in the mountains due to Snoc\u2019s training, they were slowly moving forward. Hans predicted that they would just bulldoze through the forest without using previous trails or paths like usual.\u2018Thankfully, we do have a destination.\u2019Hans hoped that they would quickly reach their destination. When Hans asked where they were going, he was secretly hoping for this.\u201cWe are going to Ospurin.\u201d\u2018Where is that?\u2019Since Hans had never heard of Ospurin, he thought it must be far from Steelwall. Thinking of this, Hans suddenly felt sad about his situation and let out a sigh. Even though he was somewhat used to this life right now, he couldn\u2019t completely shake off the feeling of missing his peaceful life in the past.\u201cIs it in our country?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s in a neighboring country, in Busutaku.\u201dHans tried searching for it on the map and then gave up.\u2018There\u2019s no point in knowing where it is.\u2019There was nothing he could do. Hans just gave up thinking about his future and felt relieved. Snoc was only familiar with Suol\u2019s geography, so he did not even bother to ask questions; but he felt a bit excited that they were going to a foreign country. Hans noticed Snoc\u2019s excitement and shook his head.\u2018Yep. Be happy while you can.\u2019After that, Hans and Snoc focused on cooking their meat. Zich stared at the burning bonfire. The red light stimulated Zich\u2019s mind.\u2018I wonder how he\u2019s doing?\u2019Zich recalled memories from his past life. There was only one reason why he wanted to go to Ospurin. After searching through his memories, Zich remembered that no other Demon Person showed up in this country for a while\u2014of course, there was a possibility that there was a Demon Person Zich was not aware of.But as a result, Zich decided to go back to the plan he made at the beginning of the journey: to find the four Demon People who had served under him as \u2018Demon Lord of Strength.\u2019 One of them was from Ospurin.\u2018I wonder what he\u2019s like right now?\u2019Zich wondered how different and similar he would be at this time. Zich made a slight smile; he was happy that he could soon satiate his curiosity.But contrary to Zich\u2019s mood, Hans and Snoc shivered at Zich\u2019s smile, fearful of what Zich had planned for them. They tried with all of their might to not make eye contact with him.* * *While training Hans and Snoc to their limits, Zich made great progress across the forest. They sometimes stopped in nearby villages, but they always slept on hard, cold ground, rather than in the comforts of an inn or a house. Snoc had been clumsy in preparing camps, but now he was able to make a fire and a campsite with relative ease.After moving on like this for several days, Zich finally said, \u201cA village is going to appear soon.\u201dHans and Snoc were delighted to hear this, and their faces brightened up. From what they knew, the next village was on the same estate as Osuprin\u2014that was how close they were to their destination. Snoc felt energized, thinking that his life of living like a wild beast would finally be over.\u201cSenior, do you think we will be able to stay in Osuprin for a while?\u201d\u201cI think so. At least, I don\u2019t think we would stay for only a day like the villages we passed by while coming here.\u201dContrary to Snoc\u2019s expectations, there was a hint of pessimism in Hans\u2019 voice. Snoc thought Hans would be jumping in glee, but there was negativity in his tone. Snoc thought it was strange that Hans wasn\u2019t happy like him that they would soon reach the end of their dreadful life in the mountains.\u201cIs there something you are concerned about?\u201d\u201cEver since I started traveling with Sir Zich, a huge event would blow up every time we reached our destination.\u201dThis was the case for Suol and Portia. And thinking back on it, Zich had also stirred up a huge commotion at Steelwall. Knowing a little of what happened in the past from Hans\u2019 narrative, Snoc made an awkward smile.\u201cIt must be a coincidence.\u201d\u201cI also think so.\u201dBut why did he feel so unsure? Hans got the ominous feeling that he wouldn\u2019t be able to peacefully rest at this destination either.Zich walked forward without caring about their conversation, but then he looked up and stared at the cliff that appeared in front of them. After hearing from a nearby village the approximate distance and direction to the next village, they immediately went back to the mountains without a moment of hesitation. There was no way they were going to walk through a comfortable path.However, Zich was not stupid. They climbed towards the highest peak. It was so high up that they could almost see all their surroundings.\u2018The amount of strength I need is\u2026\u2019Zich put his fingers into the cliff.Crush!He filled up his fingers with mana and pierced into the cliff as if it was mud.\u2018This amount of strength is good enough.\u2019Zich forced his fingers into the cliff and began climbing. Hans and Snoc, who had been staring at Zich, looked at each other.\u2018Do we have to follow him?\u2019\u2018Of course.\u2019They were able to communicate with just a few glances; after letting out a sigh, they began climbing behind Zich. Snoc used his powers to create big holes in the cliff, and he put his hands and feet inside these holes to climb the cliff. Likewise, Hans also used the holes Snoc made. The cliff was about twenty meters high, and Zich climbed up the cliff extremely fast as if he was just walking on land.When he reached the top, Zich brushed off the dirt in his hands. From there, he could see what he expected to see: the blue sky, the white clouds, the bluish waters, and the reddish-black earth. However, Zich did not expect to see a cloud of black smoke rising from a distance.\u201c\u2026Wait, isn\u2019t that the village we are heading towards?\u201d\u201cYeah, I think so? But why is there so much smoke coming out\u2026\u201dHans and Snoc arrived later than Zich, and they were startled by the sight in front of them. No matter how one looked at it, there was something extremely serious going on in the village.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZich led Hans and Snoc quickly down the mountain. His movements were rough, but both Hans and Snoc didn\u2019t express any complaints. It was because the dark smoke that came out of the small village looked alarmingly dangerous.\u2018Is it a raid? Or is it a simple fire?\u2019Because it came from far away, Zich couldn\u2019t identify the specific source until they arrived at the village. However, he was sure that something abnormal was happening.\u2018There\u2019s a high chance that I could do a kind act.\u2019Although Zich had decided to beat bad guys to death to fulfill his goal, that wasn\u2019t his only plan.Their speed was so fast that it was hard to believe that they were running through a mountain course full of trees and bushes, but because the place was a great distance away, they arrived at the village a significant time later. Yet, the incident seemed to be on-going as the black smoke continued to rise. As they came closer and closer to the village, they saw the smoke with increasing clarity.Nervousness flashed across Hans and Snoc\u2019s faces. Hans placed his hand on his sword\u2019s handle while Snoc hugged Nowem.Sniff! Sniff!Zich\u2019s nose twitched. As they neared the village, a smoky smell wafted through the surroundings.\u201cThis is\u2026the smell of burning corpses.\u201dHans and Snoc heightened their guard. The smell of burning corpses\u2014it didn\u2019t sound pleasant at all. After leaving the forests\u2019 tree-covered boundary, they saw the city\u2019s appearance in full view. They saw the wooden fences first, which were set up to defend the area, and the black smoke seeped through them.\u201cPerhaps bandits or foreign enemies ambushed them.\u201dHans already had half his sword pulled out.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\u201d Zich studied the wooden fence. \u201cThe fence around the village is too fine for it to be an ambush. And if the bandits caused the fire, they wouldn\u2019t just let the smoke pour out. They would be waving fire around. There\u2019s a strong possibility that the village could have been burned down to ashes, but the view of the village I saw from the top of the mountain looked normal.\u201dThe three walked along the wooden fence and saw a door. The door was firmly closed, and two soldiers with spears stood in front of it.\u2018They are not gatekeepers who are there to protect the village.\u2019For that to be the case, they were too heavily armored.\u201cHuh?\u201dOne of the soldiers noticed Zich and his companions. The soldier\u2019s eyes became menacing, and he lifted the spear he was holding.\u201cHow did you get out of the village!\u201dThe other soldier also saw Zich\u2019s party and similarly reached out with his spear. Hans and Snoc stuttered in shock, but Zich took a step forward.\u201cWe are travelers. We came to stay the night in the village.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense! All pathways to this village are blocked!\u201d\u2018It was?\u2019Considering the soldier\u2019s aggressive voice, it didn\u2019t seem like he was lying. However, they came in a straight line through the mountain instead of following any paths, so they weren\u2019t aware that all the paths were blocked.\u201cWe didn\u2019t follow a path and went through the mountain.\u201d\u201cYou went through a mountain full of monsters?\u201dThe soldier\u2019s suspicions deepened. In response, Zich shrugged his shoulders and tapped on the sword at his waist.\u201cWe are not so weak to be beaten by low-level monsters around this area.\u201d\u201cStill, there\u2019s no reason for you to go through the mountain. Following a path is much more convenient.\u201d\u201cThat would be the case if I didn\u2019t have to train the guys behind me.\u201dEven with Zich\u2019s explanation, the soldiers didn\u2019t let down their guard. They were extremely cautious, and it probably had something to do with the black smoke coming from inside the village.\u201cIs there something going on in the village?\u201d Zich looked over the wooden fence and asked, but the soldiers didn\u2019t answer him. They grouped together and murmured about something. However, Zich was able to hear everything with his keen senses.\u201cIs he telling the truth?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Since they are armed, it might be true. We can\u2019t rule out the possibility that they might have escaped the village too.\u201d\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\u201cWhat else can we do? Let\u2019s take them to our boss first. We can\u2019t just let them go.\u201dThe soldier who noticed them first stared at them with dreary and slightly fearful eyes.\u201cThey could also be infected with the disease.\u201d\u2018Disease?\u2019As soon as he heard that, Zich was able to grasp the village\u2019s general situation.\u2018It seems like there\u2019s an epidemic going around here.\u2019The black smoke probably came from burning infected corpses and their houses and belongings; and the village was probably blocked so that the infectious disease would not spread to another village. In a way, this was a trickier and more dangerous problem than a bandit or foreign attack.\u201cFollow me for now,\u201d the soldier placed his spear down and commanded. It looked like he wasn\u2019t going to accept any form of counterargument or defiance.Hans asked Zich, \u201cWhat are your plans, sir?\u201dHans was surprised to be treated like a criminal so abruptly, but in comparison to how he was at the beginning of the journey, he was much calmer and composed than before. He had now accumulated all kinds of experiences\u2014 quite extraordinary ones at that. On the other hand, Snoc still lacked experience, and he looked bewildered and even a bit scared.\u201cLet\u2019s follow them for now.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dThe three followed the soldiers. The soldiers didn\u2019t guide them inside the village\u2014no, they almost seemed like they wanted to go farther away from the village.\u2018I guess it can\u2019t be helped if an epidemic is spreading.\u2019If it was severe enough, an epidemic was something that could wipe out an entire country. And the horrors of an infectious disease increased as the fatality and infectious rates increased. Judging by the soldier\u2019s wariness and response towards Zich and his companions, it seemed as if the disease that was spreading in the village had a considerably high fatality rate.The soldiers took them to an area where there were huge barracks.\u2018It\u2019s the command post.\u2019Considering that all the paths leading to the village were blocked and trained soldiers were stationed in front of the village\u2019s entrance, it was evident that the control tower in the center was still functioning. To lower their chances of catching the disease, it seemed like the soldiers had stationed their command post a good distance away from the village.The soldiers took them to the largest barrack.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dThe soldier guarding the barrack asked this out loud. The soldiers who brought Zich to the place responded politely, indicating that the soldier in front of them was his superior.\u201cWe found some suspicious fellows and brought them here.\u201d\u201cSuspicious fellows?\u201dThe superior took a quick glance at Zich and his companions.\u201cThey suddenly appeared in front of the village\u2019s entrance. According to them, they went through the mountain and didn\u2019t know about the blocked paths.\u201d\u201cThe mountain? Why?\u201d\u201cThey said it was for training.\u201dThe superior\u2019s eyes landed on Zich\u2019s group for a moment.\u201cAre they villagers?\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be, but we are not certain. So, we brought them to you, sir.\u201dSuddenly, they heard a voice from inside the barrack.\u201cBring them in, please.\u201dThe superior stared at the entrance and looked at Zich again. Then he nodded at the soldiers.\u201cTake them in.\u201dZich and his companions followed the soldiers and went inside. The inside of the barrack was quite cozy; there was a bed in a corner for sleeping and a desk in another corner for doing work. There wasn\u2019t any other furniture besides that, so it almost felt like the resident was wasting the tent\u2019s huge space.Thump!The soldier guarding the tent raised his spear and saluted in front of the desk. A man was sitting there. He looked quite young, looking like he was only two or three years older than Zich at most. His cheeks were hollow while the areas under his eyes were so sunken that his cheekbones looked more pronounced. Overall, his health looked very poor.The man stood up. He was tall but thin, which added to his gaunt, frail-looking image. However, his sparkling eyes clearly showed that he had a keen sense of intelligence, contrary to his frail and sickly appearance.\u201cHello, I am Joachim Dracul. I\u2019m the person in charge of the task force dispatched in this village.\u201dJoachim Dracul. He was someone Zich knew and more.\u2018To think that I would meet him so early on\u2026\u2019Joachim was one of Zich\u2019s four closest confidants who he immediately sought out. Zich couldn\u2019t help but feel glad to see him. Joachim had stirred up the world and gone through all kinds of happenings with Zich. How sad Zich was when he heard that Joachim\u2019s life was cut short under Glen Zenard\u2019s sword! Zich wanted to wrap his shoulders around Joachim, talk about their past and future\u2014of course, of stories that reek of blood\u2014and clink their wine glasses. However, in this world, this was Joachim\u2019s first meeting with Zich, and Zich had to repress his joy at seeing an old friend.\u201cI\u2019m Zich. The guys behind me are my servants, Hans and Snoc.\u201d\u201cI see, Mr. Zich. I know how impolite it is to interrogate someone I just met, but considering the circumstances, I ask for your understanding. Where are all three of you coming from?\u201dJoachim\u2019s voice was sharp, and the soldier gripped his spear more tightly.\u201cWe are on our way from Suol. Like I told the soldier here, since I was traveling through the mountain to train my servants, I didn\u2019t realize that the paths to the village were blocked.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dJoachim made eye contact with Zich as if he was trying to see through the truth, but Zich showed no change in his facial expression.\u201cI understand. I will believe you.\u201d\u201cSir!\u201d the soldier shouted. \u201cThey might be guys escaping from the village in secret! If that\u2019s the case\u2026!\u201d\u201cPlease calm down.\u201dJoachim raised his sword and blocked the soldier\u2019s words.\u201cI\u2019m not just blindly trusting these people\u2019s words. To be frank, it doesn\u2019t matter what these men\u2019s identities are.\u201dJoachim stared at Zich, Hans, and Snoc in order and opened his mouth.\u201cSince wherever they are from, I don\u2019t plan on letting them out of here.\u201d\u201cWhat? What do you mean\u2026!\u201d Hans shouted in surprise and closed his mouth. When Joachim looked at him, Hans\u2019 mouth closed shut by itself. Although Joachim looked frail, he exuded a mystical aura and suffocated Hans.\u2018Amazing. He has this much charisma already?\u2019Zich was impressed. Joachim deserved to be his sidekick for sure.\u201cI know this is a lot to ask, but as long as you are in this village, you will have to move with us. Here\u2014\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an epidemic spreading around.\u201dZich finished Joachim\u2019s sentence. Both Hans and Snoc looked stunned, and Joachim\u2019s face was filled with a slight look of surprise.\u201cYou were aware of it?\u201d\u201cBlocked roadways, a barricaded village, and the smoke coming out of the village. In addition, army troops from the central government disguised as a task force. There were many clues.\u201d\u201cThat is true. You are right. An epidemic is spreading around the village, and our troops were dispatched to retain it. Since you made contact with us, all of you could be infected too, so we can\u2019t let you go back outside.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dZich nodded obediently, and Hans felt relieved.\u2018Even Sir Zich would accept a reason like an epidemic.\u2019Considering Zich\u2019s personality, Hans had been nervous that Zich would refuse confinement; he was almost worried about Zich\u2019s response more than the epidemic. However, Hans didn\u2019t realize that Zich was more agreeable than usual because he was glad to meet one of his four subordinates from his past.\u201cIf you like, we can help with the work here.\u201dHans also had no idea that this was also the reason for Zich\u2019s overly kind behavior.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 58": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJoachim gladly accepted Zich\u2019s offer. In their current situation, they needed as much help as they could get. On the other hand, Hans and Snoc were frightened about the epidemic, but Zich hit the back of their heads and lessened some of their fears.\u201cHans, you won\u2019t have any problems with your amount of mana! Do you think I made your training that easy? It\u2019s the same for you, Snoc! Do you think someone who made a contract with a magical beast will die from a disease? I have never heard a contractor dying for such a stupid reason. So throw your worries away and focus on working!\u201dBesides everything else, Hans and Snoc had great faith in Zich\u2019s skills and training. Thus, they casted their worries aside and began to help with the work around the camp. However, the fear of contracting a disease wasn\u2019t the only struggle workers had to deal with in an epidemic.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201d Snoc groaned, seeing the corpses coming out of the village. Hans had a bit more experience than him, but he also responded similarly.\u201cHm, they didn\u2019t die peacefully.\u201dZich looked down at the corpses below him. There were severe rashes and pus all over their bodies. Their eyes, which were incapable of closing, were yellow, and all the hair on their head was gone. Amputated black regions indicated that those regions had become rotten and fallen off. The pungent odor coming off the corpses seemed to numb his senses.\u201cBlaargh!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dEventually, Hans and Snoc began to gag, and the soldiers who brought in the corpses glanced at them. However, the soldiers didn\u2019t say much since they had gone through a similar stage like Hans and Snoc.\u201cPlease put this in the pit over there.\u201dFollowing the soldier\u2019s words, Zich lifted the corpse and left Hans and Snoc alone for a while. He was giving them some time to get used to the situation.\u2018Of course, if they stay like this, I will kick their butts.\u2019For now, Zich thought it was fine to let them enjoy his generosity. Then he went to the pit while holding all the belongings and felt a faint trace of heat coming out from the hole. Inside the pit, there were ashes of scorched tree branches mixed with burnt corpses.They were at an incineration plant. As if it was recently built, there were some fresh corpses piled on top, and Zich threw the corpse he was holding in it. A new corpse was added to the pit, and after staring at the corpses, Zich shook his head.\u2018This is quite serious.\u2019An epidemic was already a very serious matter, but looking at the state of the corpses, the epidemic looked worse than usual. Zich headed back to the village. As soon as he stepped inside, he heard all kinds of groans and screams across the area. Doctors and priests were shouting while soldiers were running. It almost felt as if he was on the front lines of a battlefield.\u201cAre you a bit better now?\u201dAfter throwing up for a while, Hans and Snoc seemed better and walked towards Zich like zombies.\u201cS-Sorry, sir. We couldn\u2019t hold it in no matter what\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is too awful.\u201d\u201cAmong the villages impacted by epidemics, this one is definitely the worst one I\u2019ve seen.\u201d Before his regression, Zich had seen places hit by epidemics a couple of times before, but this place seemed to exceed even Zich\u2019s experience. It was a merciless environment for Hans, who had only killed monsters, and Snoc, who had just begun his journey. But unfortunately for them, Zich had no intention of letting them rest.\u201cBoth of you have rested well enough. Why don\u2019t you help around the village now? I mean, you guys aren\u2019t thinking such a cute thought like playing while I work, right?\u201dIf they had even an inkling of such a thought, Zich intended to change their cute thoughts into a terrifying nightmare. Hans and Snoc shuddered and instantly got up. Although the fear of diseases and nasty corpses still clouded their minds, they were more afraid of facing Zich\u2019s wrath head-on. Hans and Snoc knew Zich\u2019s personality from training, and they quickly moved.After watching them help the closest people around them, Zich began to also help the people around him.* * *Once night fell, they were finally able to rest. Some might have argued that there was no daytime or nighttime during an epidemic, but Joachim was accommodating for the three who had just started work. And as he was also very satisfied with their efforts, Joachim invited the three of them to dinner. Zich accepted the offer and took Hans and Snoc to Joachim\u2019s barrack at the designated time.Inside the barrack, dinner was already prepared for them. As the frontline of a raging epidemic, the meal wasn\u2019t fancy, but no one complained. Nobody in the group was so out of their senses to complain about their meals in a situation like this.\u201cWe didn\u2019t prepare much, but please eat a lot. If this is not enough, we will get you more.\u201d Joachim said while smiling. The meal was plain but quite satisfying.\u201cAlthough I told the three of you before, I am thankful for your help. To tell you the truth, we needed more workers.\u201d Joachim smiled. As a smile appeared on his off-color, fatigue-stricken face, he looked more like a patient. Joachim looked so sickly that Hans and Snoc suspected that he might have also been infected.\u201cI don\u2019t think we did much. I\u2019m relieved that we were able to offer some help.\u201d\u201cNo, you really helped us a lot. How many people do you think are willing to come to a place like this? We are struggling to get the most important people such as doctors to come here, so it\u2019s even rarer to find volunteers who are willing to come on their own accord.\u201dPriests could heal cuts or external body injuries with their holy powers, but for matters like an epidemic, they needed doctors. Holy power didn\u2019t work on diseases, and the priests currently helping out the epidemic here possessed medical knowledge.\u201cIt\u2019s because most people value their lives. By the way, the state of the corpses looked terrible. What kind of disease is it?\u201dHans and Snoc stopped eating; they remembered the corpses\u2019 gruesome appearances and lost their appetite. They immediately let go of their eating utensils. However, Zich stopped them.\u201cEat. To work, you need stamina. Even if the food doesn\u2019t go in, force it down your throat and digest it.\u201dThe two grabbed their eating utensils while looking teary. Then they began to unwillingly stuff food into their mouths. Joachim smiled bitterly while watching the two and responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Even the doctors say that they\u2019ve never seen a disease like this. And seeing the multiple, different symptoms among the patients, they say that they think more than one disease is spreading.\u201dIn a situation where he had to juggle multiple difficult issues at once, Joachim\u2019s head hurt.\u201cThis is a significant and dangerous problem. However, in comparison to our situation, I feel that our military aid and general support are lacking.\u201dAlthough Zich and his companions had appeared out of the blue, Joachim\u2019s soldiers welcomed them openly now because they were skilled helpers. This meant the place lacked human resources to such a high degree that they even welcomed mysterious strangers. One might think that the situation became so dire because few people volunteered to help, but this was an epidemic. With the slightest mishap, an epidemic could spread across the entire region and cause astronomical harm. Families in the region had little or no choice but to dispatch people by force like this troop that must have also been forced to move here.Joachim smiled weakly. By that expression, Zich realized that there must be a deeper story.\u201cSir!\u201d Somebody came in a hurry.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWe found a patient with new symptoms!\u201dJoachim\u2019s face stiffened. He got up abruptly and walked out of the barrack. Zich, Hans, and Snoc followed him.A couple of torches burned outside the tent and illuminated the area. Inside, they saw a couple of doctors and priests huddled around an infected person with serious expressions on their faces. The infected person\u2019s condition was severe and unsightly; they didn\u2019t have a rash or pus on their body or a rotting body part like the other patients. They were bleeding a tremendous amount of blood. It almost seemed like they were releasing blood instead of sweat from the glands all over their body, and the clothes they were wearing were soaked with blood and stuck to the patient\u2019s body.Drip! Drip!Blood slid down the patient\u2019s hair and dropped from the ends of their hair strands. It was difficult to estimate when the patient was brought to this place, but the floor was already wet with blood.\u201cThis\u2026is\u2026\u201dJoachim bit his lips from shock at the patient\u2019s state.\u201c\u2026What happened?\u201d\u201cThe patient was one of the villagers quarantined in another area after receiving an assessment that they weren\u2019t infected.\u201d\u201cWhat about the progress of the disease?\u201d\u201cSymptoms began to appear around sunset. And after that, the patient\u2019s condition took a turn for the worst at an alarming rate and progressed until this state.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dJoachim became lost in thought for a short moment. Then, he immediately began to give orders.\u201cFor now, record all of the patient\u2019s symptoms. Then quarantine everyone who lived in the same place as the patient and burn the building they stayed in. Investigate everything\u2014what the patient did after quarantine, who they contacted, and what they ate. Ah, and burn this place too.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dAfter receiving the command, everyone moved in unison.Zich stared proudly at Joachim who handled the situation smoothly in a short amount of time. Joachim was much weaker than the time he had created chaos around the world with Zich. Some of his actions showed his inexperience, but Zich was able to catch glimpses of Joachim\u2019s future self. Thus, Zich began to feel a bit sentimental as he felt like he was meeting his old friend again.\u2018Yep, that\u2019s right. As expected of a guy who used to be my subordinate before I regressed.\u2019After resolving the situation, Joachim approached Zich.\u201cAlthough I invited you to a meal, I couldn\u2019t properly serve you one.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not such a dunce to complain while knowing the situation. But is this all right?\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201dZich stared at Joachim\u2019s face. Joachim\u2019s sickly face still looked like he was suffering from at least four to five chronic diseases, but it looked considerably worse than before. He was extremely pale. If there had been a light source around them, Joachim\u2019s face would have reflected the light and made him look like a bodiless ghost with only a floating head.\u201cYour complexion looks very pale.\u201d\u201cAh, that is\u2026\u201d Joachim wiped his face one time, then he looked up at the sky and let out a sigh. \u201cThis is something you will find out soon if you keep working with us, so I will just tell you in advance. This isn\u2019t a matter related to the disease. This is something I am personally weak against.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s blood.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cBlood. I have hemophobia, and I am terrified of even a paper cut. The last patient\u2019s condition just triggered my phobia again, and if the darkness hadn\u2019t properly covered the patient, I would have probably fainted.\u201dLooking a bit ashamed and humiliated, Joachim spoke while avoiding Zich\u2019s gaze.\u2018\u2026What?\u2019Zich looked at Joachim like he couldn\u2019t believe him. It wasn\u2019t because he was looking down on Joachim. He had no intention of mocking someone for having hemophobia, but he was shocked that Joachim of all people would have hemophobia.\u2018Joachim Dracul has hemophobia?\u2019Before his regression, Joachim Dracul worked as one of Zich\u2019s four subordinates by the nickname Vampire, and his skill was \u2018Blood Domination.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis incident occurred during the time Zich was devastating the world as a Demon Person, not yet a Demon Lord. As he usually did, Zich and his subordinates fought against another enemy force and completely decimated them. Since this happened so often, Zich didn\u2019t remember every single one of these events. However, there was one scene that he vividly remembered.Horrifying corpses were spread all across a wide plain. It was hard to differentiate whether this was hell or reality while looking at the sea of corpses and dark blood everywhere. Blood flowed all over the ground and gathered together to make a giant pool of blood; even among the pools of blood, there was one pool that was especially big\u2014it was large enough for ten people to fit in.Surprisingly, there was a person inside this enormous pool. As if he was taking a bath, he completely soaked himself in blood and sometimes played around with the blood by splashing it around.[Are you doing that disgusting hobby again?]The person inside the pool of blood\u2014Joachim\u2014stopped at Zich\u2019s words. He gave a bright smile and turned around.[Is it you, boss?][Yeah, yeah. It\u2019s your boss.]Zich scowled as if he was seeing something gross and slowly walked towards Joachim. But Zich didn\u2019t look too normal either as he kicked the corpses in front of him while walking forward.[As I have told you many times before, this is not a hobby. I\u2019m healing. If you soak your whole body in blood, someone told me you can get healed from various diseases and light migraines.][Who the fuck said such ridiculous nonsense? It\u2019s so creative, I want to put a knife in their brain.][A doctor told me that.][He\u2019s definitely a quack. Who\u2019s that bastard? Tell me who he is, so I can destroy him for you. If you paid him some money, I will also get it back for you. No, I will even get him to pay you interest.][He\u2019s probably dead. No matter how great you are, it\u2019s not possible for you to go all the way to the underworld to beat up just one person.][Tch! He fled to the underworld to run away from his responsibilities. Doctors these days don\u2019t take their calling seriously.]It was ironic of Zich to say this, since the people around him had started calling him Demon Lord instead of Demon Person. However, Joachim didn\u2019t reply; instead, he dropped more blood over his shoulders. He seemed disinterested in Zich\u2019s words and focused on covering his whole body with more blood. As Zich stared at him, he clicked his tongue and thought:[\u2018This guy is definitely not sane.\u2019]Even though Zich was surrounded by crazy people, Joachim and some of his other subordinates were a par above everyone else.[\u2018The only one sane is me. I have to stay sane to lower our group\u2019s total insanity level. It\u2019s so embarrassing.\u2019]Of course, if anyone heard what Zich was thinking, even Joachim who was bathing in a pool of blood would quickly deny Zich\u2019s claims. How can you of all people say that I am insane? he would say. But even after he earned the title of Vampire and was feared by many, Joachim still couldn\u2019t read people\u2019s minds.[Do you want to try coming in?]Joachim wrongly judged that Zich wanted to try his blood bath and offered him a spot in his pool. He spread his arms wide and actively tried to spread his hob\u2014no, his \u201chealing\u201d technique to everyone around him. Of course, Zich had no desire in the slightest to join Joachim.[Okay, let\u2019s just say that crazy technique of yours is good for the body. What part of your body is hurting so much that you have to soak your body in blood every time we go to battle?][It\u2019s because I\u2019m weak. Don\u2019t I look weak from a glance?][Yeah, you look like you are about to die, but weak? Didn\u2019t you just defeat 5,000 soldiers by yourself?][I can\u2019t believe so many people ganged up on someone who looks as weak as me. Really, the world is so harsh these days.]How can he be so shameless! Zich\u2019s body shook at Joachim\u2019s outrageous statements. He even felt like he lost to Joachim a little bit; Zich had been confident about his ability to hurt his opponents\u2019 mentality by his shamelessness, but he felt as if he was nowhere near Joachim\u2019s level.[Okay, okay. Just do whatever you want.][Thank you, boss.]Joachim put his back against the wall of the blood pool.[Pweh, feels so good!][\u2026]Even Zich was made speechless in front of Joachim\u2019s hobby\u2014no, \u201chealing\u201d technique\u2014and Zich stared at him for a long time.* * *\u2018I can\u2019t believe that Joachim of all people has hemophobia\u2026\u2019Maybe Joachim was joking or trying to trick him by giving a fake weakness.\u2018No, but why would he try to do that to someone he just met?\u2019Even if there was another reason for him to lie, Joachim\u2019s pale face seemed to indicate that he was not lying.But Joachim misunderstood Zich\u2019s statement and asked with a dejected look, \u201c\u2026It\u2019s pathetic, right?\u201d He seemed embarrassed about his hemophobia.\u201cYou hate your own constitution?\u201d\u201cHow can I like it? Because of this constitution, I suffered so much.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like Joachim would explain how he suffered, and even Zich did not know much about Joachim\u2019s past. Before he regressed, the only thing Joachim told him was where he was from. Moreover, Zich also didn\u2019t put much importance on people\u2019s pasts, so he hadn\u2019t bothered to ask him about his past.But since Zich knew what Joachim would become in the future, he said with complete assurance, \u201cI don\u2019t know when it will be, but I\u2019m sure you will get over your hemophobia.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dJoachim thanked Zich, but he didn\u2019t sound convinced. However, Zich stressed each of his words so Joachim would know that he was telling the truth.\u201cI\u2019m not just saying this. If it\u2019s you, I\u2019m sure you can overcome your constitution.\u201dZich was sure of it. Joachim would overcome his constitution to the point of bathing himself with blood in every battle. Joachim nodded his head in surprise at Zich\u2019s confident tone.* * *Everyone continued their efforts to stop the spread of the epidemic. Priests and doctors worked desperately to save patients\u2019 lives, and soldiers worked hard to prevent the spread of diseases by burning down infected corpses, houses, and furniture.However, the situation didn\u2019t get any better. The villagers in quarantine kept getting sick, and those who became infected had a very low survival rate.The fatality rate was almost 100%. Even Zich shook his head at how severe this disease was. As the doctors and soldiers also got infected and died, the situation turned for the worse; and they didn\u2019t receive much support from their estate either. At this rate, it seemed as if the people who came to aid the villagers hadn\u2019t come here to prevent the spread of diseases but to die with them.On the other hand, the supporters didn\u2019t give up easily. Joachim gave out clear orders and instilled hope into people\u2019s hearts; he and his soldiers, with the priests and doctors, did their utmost best to bring relief to the villagers.Moreover, Zich was a critical factor in letting them continue their support. Even on this day, Zich went up to the mountains and caught a large number of animals for people to eat. The patients and all the people who took care of the patients needed to conserve their stamina. People needed stamina to recover, and it was also harder for people to get sick when they ate well. Therefore, it was a very important job for someone to consistently bring food for people to eat and maintain their stamina.Since the soldiers\u2019 estate sent barely any resources, food supplies were also low. Before Zich, many people would get infected and die as a result of losing stamina. Even though Joachim and his soldiers were all very skilled fighters, sword and hunting skills were of totally different categories that utilized different sets of skills. Thus, people welcomed Zich, who brought food to them, with open arms.In addition, bringing food was not the only thing Zich did.\u201cThis is a Purin leaf.\u201dThe Purin leaf that Zich brought was long and wide, so people could use it for bandages when they were running low on them.\u201cSolberri fruit, Durogu root, and Dic\u2019s stems are all here.\u201dZich also brought in plants that doctors needed, so his popularity increased even further.\u201cSir Zich is even knowledgeable about medicinal plants!\u201dSnoc was amazed at Zich\u2019s various abilities. While Hans kept his amazement to himself while following Zich\u2019s orders, Snoc outwardly showed his admiration for Zich continuously. There was a huge difference between someone who was forced to follow Zich and someone who followed him willingly.\u201cYou should also learn this. There\u2019s no harm in knowing about this.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dSnoc stared intensely at the medicinal plants that Zich brought and tried to carve them into his memory. Nowem also shoved his nose close to the plants to remember them by his sense of smell. Although Snoc\u2019s eager attitude was a great ingredient for his progress, no matter how hard he worked, he couldn\u2019t beat experience.\u201cHere it is.\u201dHans had learned how to identify medicinal plants while traveling with Zich, and he was already pretty skillful at finding useful plants. He soon proved himself to be of great help to Zich.\u201cSenior, you are also amazing!\u201d\u201cAh, yeah. It\u2019s because I learned a lot from Sir Zich.\u201dHans\u2019 voice was awkward as he said this because he felt overwhelmed by Snoc\u2019s admiring eyes. But it was not a bad feeling, and the tip of his mouth quivered upwards. Overall, with the help of Zich and his companions, people worked their hardest to save infected patients and prevent the spread of the disease. However, no matter how hard they worked, it was impossible for them to save the village.Whooosh!The village was swept by an enormous fire. The temporary ward, the doctor and priest\u2019s hastily made shelter, and the wooden fence that surrounded the whole village\u2014everything was swept by the crackling flames.The fire had not been an accident. Under Joachim\u2019s orders, the soldiers started a fire because there was no need for this village to exist anymore. All the villagers were gone, and there was no reason to leave a disease-infested village alone.\u201cI still can\u2019t believe not a single person survived.\u201d Hans watched the village burn to the ground and mumbled with mixed emotions. When he was in Steelwall, he sometimes received news of infectious diseases spreading around in the country. He also heard people say that the circumstances of some places were becoming very serious. But he had never heard of a case in which not a single person survived, like this village. In the end, all of them failed to save the village.Joachim, the leader of the task force, and all the doctors, priests, and the soldiers had pensive, sad looks on their faces. The towering flames in front of them were stark evidence of how all their efforts had gone down the drain. To make matters worse, some of their comrades had fallen ill and passed away so the morale was as low as it could possibly be.\u201cIn the end, it turned out like this.\u201dJoachim walked towards Zich and his companions. Even though Joachim was walking towards them, his gaze did not depart from the village even once.Zich replied, \u201cWhat a pity.\u201d\u201cIt is a pity. The lives lost, the village on fire right now, and all the efforts that we made. Everything is a pity.\u201d\u2018This Joachim is definitely different from the one I knew.\u2019Zich watched Joachim stare at the village with tearful eyes. The Joachim he knew in the past would have never been consumed by emotions because he was unable to save people\u2014instead, he would have been consumed by emotions because there would be no people to get blood from. It seemed as if something in the near future made Joachim completely transform.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t receive help from the three of you, we wouldn\u2019t have lasted this long. For that, I want to thank you again.\u201d\u201cIt was no problem at all. The reason why I\u2019m traveling all over the world is so that I can do kind acts. Therefore, I\u2019m happy to be of help to all of you.\u201dJoachim was filled with admiration. \u201cYou are a very admirable person.\u201d\u201cI reported our situation, so we\u2019ll probably get a return order soon. If it would be all right with you, I would like to invite all three of you to my place. I want to express my thanks in this way at least.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll gladly accept your invitation.\u201dZich also didn\u2019t want to separate from Joachim yet, so he readily accepted his invitation. However, even after a day and several days later, an order requesting their return did not arrive. They had no choice but to stay near the devastated village.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The dinner menu was the same as yesterday: freshly caught game. However, Zich did not catch today\u2019s meat. Since Joachim\u2019s soldiers didn\u2019t have any patients to take care of anymore, they could now hunt for themselves. Zich\u2019s life of having to feed people was officially over.The soldiers had caught a wild pig, and they skewered it on a piece of wood and cooked it over a fire\u2014it was a super basic meal that had existed since the cavemen age. They had no seasoning or spice, so the pig\u2019s nasty smell seeped right up their noses. Zich was not picky about his food; in the past, he once survived by drinking only water for several days.But\u2014\u2018I\u2019m slowly getting tired of this.\u2019Zich didn\u2019t even want a fancy meal; he just wanted a basic meal like bread and stew. But he finished up the meal in front of him anyway. Hans and Snoc also finished eating their share, and like this, their rudimentary meal was over.Hans asked, \u201cHow long do you think we will be here for?\u201dFor the past few weeks, they had worked hard to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Even though Hans did not regret working hard to help people, he wanted to sleep on a comfortable bed. Snoc also nodded in agreement while hugging Nowem. Since it had not been long since Snoc started his journey, he was more exhausted than Hans and Zich. For a beginner traveler, this experience was definitely a hard-level course.\u201cHmmm, I don\u2019t think it will be easy to get out.\u201d\u201cDo you think it\u2019s because they think we got infected?\u201d\u201cWell, that might be one possible explanation, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the main reason.\u201dThe incubation periods for the diseases found among the villagers were all very short. It had already been over ten days since they camped outside. If they were sick, they would have fallen ill and died days ago.\u201cThen what do you think is the main reason?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s similar to what happened in our family.\u201dZich looked at Hans and made a furtive smile. \u2018What happened in our family.\u2019 Hans grew pale as he remembered the events that had happened in Steelwall. He put his head down and moved away from Zich\u2019s prying gaze. Zich laughed at Hans\u2019 frazzled reaction.But Snoc did not know Zich\u2019s background, so he didn\u2019t understand what Zich was saying and titled his head in puzzlement.Seeing this face, Zich continued, \u201cYou know who\u2019s in charge of this place right now, don\u2019t you?\u201dSnoc replied, \u201cIsn\u2019t it Sir Joachim Dracul?\u201d\u201cYeah. And this place is part of the Dracul estate. This means that Joachim Dracul is one of the direct descendants that governs this estate.\u201dEven Snoc knew that much; he had heard all of this information while helping people out in the village. However, what Zich said next was something Snoc had never learned about as a miner who spent all his life mining: power struggles within a noble family.\u201cWhen infectious diseases are spreading in a village, families don\u2019t usually send one of their members. Furthermore, Joachim Dracul is not just a distant member of the family. He is the Count\u2019s second son. Moreover, the Count is not very healthy right now. No matter how you see it, it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea for the head of the family to send Joachim here.\u201d\u201cThen how did he come here?\u201d\u201cThe most likely explanation is this\u2026\u201dZich made a furtive smile and continued, \u201c\u2026They sent him here to get sick and die.\u201d\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe it.\u201dSnoc was shocked. Even though he was aware that intense power struggles existed among the nobility, it was difficult for him to believe that a person could send another human being to an infectious location for the sole sake of killing them off. It was difficult for Snoc to understand this kind of behavior from his perspective. On the other hand, Hans agreed with Zich\u2019s analysis inside his mind; as a servant of the Count, he had hands-on experience with the power struggles that happened within the nobility. The relationship between Greig and Zich exemplified this.\u2018But this power struggle must be really intense for them to send Joachim off to a village with a full-blown epidemic to kill him off. Would other noble families go to this extent?\u2019Even though Zich\u2019s image in the Steelwall family was not good and many forces had worked hard to drive Zich away from becoming the heir, no one actively tried to kill him.\u201cWhy are you like that? Compared to our family, are they too extreme?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, it seems a bit like that.\u201dHans was getting used to Zich\u2019s harsh, yet playful way of speaking and agreed easily to Zich\u2019s statements.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the atmosphere is like in the Dracul family, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a bit different from ours. In our family, everyone thought I was useless and supported Greig, right? I was not even worth killing, or to be more accurate, I was not worth the trouble to kill.\u201dSnoc and even Hans, who knew the truth of Zich\u2019s background, froze at Zich\u2019s words. Compared to them, Zich was calm; to him, what he said was not really a serious matter.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what would have happened if I didn\u2019t leave the family. I don\u2019t know about father and Greig, but I\u2019m sure that with sufficient time, people who disliked me or supported Greig would have all wanted to assassinate me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs someone who adored the Steelwall family, Hans wanted to deny Zich\u2019s words. However, the aristocratic society he knew was more than capable and vicious enough to do exactly what Zich said, so he could not say anything.\u201cUm-uh\u2026\u201dSnoc broke the tense silence. His expression looked as if he was wondering if he could even speak in this heavy atmosphere. But he couldn\u2019t stifle his curiosity.Snoc asked with a tentative voice, \u201cSir Zich, if I may ask, are you a noble?\u201d\u201cWell, to be more accurate, I used to be a noble. I threw it all away though.\u201dSnoc was completely shaken; he had not imagined in the slightest that the traveler he was learning various skills and knowledge from was of noble lineage. But it was not only Snoc who was surprised.Zich raised his voice and said, \u201cSir, why don\u2019t you reveal yourself?\u201dWho was he saying that to? Hans and Snoc looked around them. But soon, they found Joachim a few feet away from them with a sheepish expression on his face.\u201cI\u2026I apologize. I just wanted to converse with Mr. Zich\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I wasn\u2019t trying to hide my background anyways.\u201dZich made space next to him. Joachim hesitated for a bit, but he finally accepted Zich\u2019s hospitality and sat down next to Zich.Joachim carefully asked to confirm Zich\u2019s words, \u201cSir, is it true that you are a noble?\u201dZich nodded. \u201cI used to be one.\u201dJoachim really wanted to know which family he was from, but he pushed back his curiosity. Zich said he \u2018used to be one\u2019\u2014that meant Zich was no longer a noble. In that case, Joachim was not sure if he could ask which family Zich was from.Instead, he asked a different question, \u201cWould I be able to ask why you left your family?\u201dRecently, Joachim wanted to leave his family more and more as time passed. As his possible senior(?), Joachim wanted to get some advice from Zich.\u201cTo summarize, it was because of problems with the succession. My father and everyone in the family wanted not me, but my younger brother to become the heir, so I left the family.\u201dThere was nothing wrong with Zich\u2019s statement. But Hans knew what Zich did before he left the Steelwall family, and he wondered if it was okay for Zich to summarize his \u201cproblems\u201d like that.Joachim said with a bitter smile, \u201c\u2026Your circumstances are similar to mine.\u201d\u201cSir, are you also struggling because your whole family is partnering up against you? Are you planning to give up on your right to succeed as the heir?\u201dBefore he regressed, Zich used to call Joachim by just his name, but right now, their relationship was more formal. Therefore, Zich followed protocol and called Joachim \u2018sir.\u2019 However, as they became closer after working so many hours together, Zich spoke less politely now.\u201cIt\u2019s not to that extent. Since I\u2019m the second son, my older brother has more legitimacy and he also has more followers. Honestly, it\u2019s kind of laughable to talk about my followers, because they are just people I\u2019m personally close to.\u201d\u201cPeople who are obsessed with power would feel threatened by just that.\u201d\u201cYes, that is true, but I have no interest in becoming the Count.\u201d\u201cDid you tell them that?\u201d\u201cYes, of course. I told them and also showed it through my actions. I even distanced myself from some of my close friends.\u201d\u201cThen I can think of two possible scenarios: first, it\u2019s because you are a really talented person and your old brother feels threatened by that; or second, your older brother is a very petty person.\u201dJoachim looked as if it was difficult for him to answer.\u201cI guess both of them are true.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. My older brother is just very stressed out because of the succession problem, and I\u2019m also not very talented or skilled.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dZich said okay, but his expression or tone seemed as if he disagreed with Joachim\u2019s statements. Joachim was about to add more, but he gave up; he realized it was futile for him to keep making excuses for his older brother. Instead, he changed the topic and asked how Zich lived after he left the family. Joachim wanted to hear a personal account of someone who left their family in case he really decided to completely separate himself from his family. Thinking back to their relationship in his past life, Zich gave various advice and tips to Joachim. After conversing for a long time together, Joachim left and felt more confident about his future.Once again, only the three of them were left. Hans\u2019 gaze followed Joachim\u2019s back as he moved away.\u201cI wonder if that person is also thinking of leaving his family?\u201d\u201cMaybe. But leaving and traveling around the world is not a bad idea either.\u201dZich was the very evidence of that statement. If Joachim really decided to leave his noble family, Zich was also willing to give more advice and help him out.After many long conversations, their dinner was finally over. Then after a week, a return order arrived for Joachim and his soldiers.* * *The soldiers headed towards the estate with light footsteps. It took a long time for them to go back. Soldiers who had family members back home missed their family members, and soldiers who had no family members missed their friends back home. Back at the estate, they could sleep on a bed instead of a smelly smock and eat a simple but loving, home-cooked meal. People\u2019s faces were full of life.It was the same for Snoc and Hans. They were both very happy about being able to live like a normal human again. Soon after they marched on like that, they heard a cry: \u201cI can see it!\u201dThey were finally at the capital city of the Dracul estate, Ospurin.* * *The room was luxurious. It was filled with expensive furniture and decorations. However, the interior was not well designed. Instead of wanting to decorate the room beautifully with expensive items, it gave off the impression that expensive items were stuffed into a room for the sole sake of showing them off. The haphazard placement of the furniture further heightened that impression.The design of the room could be summarized into one word: cheap. On the other hand, the owner of this room\u2014a young man\u2014showed no embarrassment about his room and reclined on his expensive sofa. He scowled at the old man in front of him.\u201cThat bastard eventually made it back up here?\u201dThe young man also wore very expensive clothes. However, in contrast to his fancy clothes, he had poor manners and a cheap attitude. It was easy to see what his personality was like. Like his room, his clothes perfectly reflected the type of person he was.\u201cI sincerely apologize.\u201d\u201cTake your insincere apology somewhere else. What are you going to do about it? Are you going to let him come back here? Why don\u2019t you raid him and his soldiers on the way and kill them all? I don\u2019t want to see that bastard Joachim here ever again!\u201dThis young man was Joachim\u2019s older brother and the current Count Dracul\u2019s first son, Biyom Dracul. Even though Biyom and Joachim shared the same parents and were not half-brothers like Zich and Greig, Biyom\u2019s attitude clearly showed that he didn\u2019t consider Joachim as his family at all.\u201cAssassination is too obvious. There\u2019ll definitely be people who would be very suspicious of you. If they happen to find evidence against you, they\u2019ll use that against you to block your succession.\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dBiyom lost his temper as the situation didn\u2019t go according to his desires.\u201cHow the fuck did that guy even survive? You told me that the disease there was so strong that it wiped out an entire village! You said that there were even some doctors and soldiers who died! I even sent them the least possible amount of resources! How did that stick-skinny guy even survive!\u201d\u201cI can only say that he is very lucky.\u201dBiyom began to throw a tantrum. He kicked the table over and punched his sofa repeatedly. After a long time passed, Biyom calmed himself down.With murderous eyes, Biyom said, \u201c\u2026Quickly make a new plan. A plan that\u2019ll definitely kill Joachim!\u201dThe old man bowed and left the room. A moment later, Biyom\u2019s screams could be heard again as he vented his anger out on the objects in his room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZich and his companions unloaded their luggage in a hotel at Ospurin. They stayed in a luxurious, expensive hotel; it wasn\u2019t a place where aristocrats stayed, but successful merchants and wealthy people frequently resided in the hotel.Thus, the price of one night in the hotel was considerably expensive, and because Zich, Hans, and Snoc each got separate rooms, the fee was three times more than the normal amount. However, Zich didn\u2019t feel burdened by the price of the hotel since Joachim had reserved the rooms for them.Since Zich had done so much to help them during the epidemic, Joachim had initially wanted to invite Zich to his castle. Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t like Zich, Hans, and Snoc had simply helped them out. There was no need to even go on about what Zich did\u2014Hans and Snoc had done the work of tens of people. All of Joachim\u2019s task force greatly appreciated Zich and his companions. Joachim wanted to invite the three of them to his castle and treat them as esteemed guests. However, his plan fell apart as soon as he arrived at the castle.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201dJoachim\u2019s face crumpled intensely. His clenched fist trembled with humiliation, and he felt powerless. The gatekeepers had been ordered to prohibit all of Joachim\u2019s guests from entering the castle. However, Joachim couldn\u2019t blame the gatekeepers who also looked helpless. Their expressions betrayed the fact that they weren\u2019t acting of their own free will.As expected, the gatekeepers were working under the orders of the Draculs\u2019 first son, Biyom. Joachim couldn\u2019t understand why a son\u2014not the feudal lord\u2014would have authority over the entire estate. But judging by the responses of the people in front of him, it seemed like nobody could ignore Biyom\u2019s orders.Zich comforted Joachim. Zich was already satisfied that Joachim wanted to do something for him. The fact that he had developed a good relationship with Joachim after the regression also made Zich glad. However, Joachim wasn\u2019t satisfied with leaving things like that, so he quickly reserved them a place. He asked them to stay in the hotel and said that he would visit them; then Joachim headed for the castle.\u2018He\u2019s quite unlucky.\u2019Zich thought that Joachim\u2019s situation was like his past situation at Steelwall. But after seeing the way Joachim was treated at his residence, Zich thought Joachim\u2019s situation was worse.\u2018The atmosphere here is worse than Steelwall. How can he even swallow his food there?\u2019If Zich hadn\u2019t planned to flip his household upside down at the end, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to survive even one day in Steelwall.\u2018Should I just take him with me?\u2019Zich started to seriously think about this matter. There was no harm to it, and Zich would welcome his past underling to become his subordinate again with open arms. All that remained was what Joachim wanted, and Joachim also had thoughts of leaving his family.\u2018His hemophobia might hinder our travels, but I can adjust to that.\u2019And if things still didn\u2019t work out, Zich could help Joachim settle in a place with good scenery full of mountains and pleasant waters.\u2018I should ask his opinions about it first and plan later.\u2019After making his final decision, Zich decided to enjoy his leisure time that he wasn\u2019t able to have for a while. He ate when he was hungry, slept when he felt sleepy, and had a drink from time to time. And since Ospurin was a sizable city, there were enough places for entertainment.Both Hans and Snoc seemed very pleased with their stay. Hans enjoyed his freedom as much as he could while Snoc couldn\u2019t get enough of the luxurious lifestyle he had never experienced before. Moreover, Zich planned to leave them alone for a while.Several days passed like that. It was about time for Joachim to contact them, but they didn\u2019t hear anything back from him.\u2018Since the hotel is regularly receiving payments for our stay, I don\u2019t think he forgot about us. He might be in some serious trouble.\u201dThis meant that Joachim was dealing with personal affairs or threats against his own life\u2014 to the point that he couldn\u2019t concern himself about Zich. For a moment, Zich thought about infiltrating the castle like he did before. But at that moment, a visitor arrived at the hotel. However, the person wasn\u2019t Joachim; it was one of Joachim\u2019s lieutenants.\u201cHey, it\u2019s been a while, Zich.\u201dEven though he was from a lower class than Zich, he was quite old and a knight of a noble, so he talked informally to Zich. Zich also didn\u2019t say anything against it since this was normal. Only Joachim talked formally to everyone regardless of their status.\u201cYes, it\u2019s been a while Sir Brod. Did Count Dracul send you?\u201d\u201cWell, kind of.\u201dBrod\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t good. It wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t like Zich\u2014 Brod had also worked with Zich at the village affected by the epidemic. It seemed like something had happened to Joachim.Brod continued, \u201cCount Joachim wanted me to pass on his apologies. He is sorry that he couldn\u2019t keep his promise.\u201d\u201cIs there something going on?\u201d\u201c\u2026He is confined in his room for failing to stop the epidemic properly.\u201d\u201cIs it because everyone in the village died?\u201dBrod nodded. \u201cAlthough he explained that the infection and fatality rates were extremely high and there were multiple diseases spreading\u2026\u201d\u201cIt didn\u2019t get through to them.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, the first son of Count Dracul thought differently from us.\u201dBrod clearly looked like he wanted to add all kinds of names before the \u2018first son of Count Dracul\u2019\u2014for example, \u2018that bastard,\u2019 or \u2018damn,\u2019 or even \u2018that greedy pig bastard\u2019\u2014or curses even worse than that.\u201cThe first son? What about the lord of the house?\u201d\u201cOur Lord is bedridden by an illness.\u201d\u201cIs it an infectious disease?\u201dAfter staying in an infected village, the first thing that came to Zich\u2019s mind when an illness was mentioned was an infectious disease. Yet, thankfully, that didn\u2019t seem to be the case. Brod shook his head.\u201cNo, if it was, more people would have caught it.\u201dZich nodded. Truthfully, he wouldn\u2019t have cared if the Lord or even all the residents in this city, Ospurin, caught the epidemic. Zich was simply a person who tried to do kind acts, and he wasn\u2019t actually a kind person. He was just curious.\u201cThen, is Joachim still imprisoned?\u201d\u201cNo, he was released yesterday.\u201dHowever, Brod\u2019s face didn\u2019t get any brighter.\u201cSomething must have happened again.\u201d\u201cIt seems like another village was hit by an epidemic.\u201dHe knew where this was going. The corner of Zich\u2019s lips turned upwards; it was a fishy smile without a shred of positivity.\u201cYou are saying that Joachim has been sent to that village.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dBrod\u2019s voice was solemn.\u2018They are doing all they can to push him to death.\u2019Zich could easily figure out the first son\u2019s intentions; however, the first son probably had other reasons to send Joachim off.\u2018He probably wants to cut down the number of people who align themselves with Joachim.\u201dJoachim had said that he didn\u2019t have many followers, but everyone who was in the task force was completely loyal to him. Although Zich considered the thought that Joachim might have won the hearts of the people around him in the short time he took command of the task force\u2026\u2018But for that to be the case, they seem too loyal to Joachim.\u201dThat meant only one thing.\u2018The first count must have sent Joachim\u2019s followers to fight off the epidemic with him.\u2019It would also not be different this time. No matter how loyal they were, they were bound to feel fearful about death, especially towards infectious diseases that they couldn\u2019t even see while they were dispatched to a village at the peak of their outbreak. There would be many sacrifices.\u2018It would be most ideal for the first son if Joachim dies from the epidemic. And if Joachim doesn\u2019t, the first son plans to decrease the number of Joachim\u2019s followers by letting them die by infectious diseases or encouraging them to leave Joachim\u2019s side to escape dispatchment.\u2019The whole situation was disgraceful. Zich wouldn\u2019t have normally concerned himself in a power struggle between nobles, but Joachim was involved in this case. Furthermore, Joachim was getting one-sidedly beaten.\u2018What was the name of that first son guy?\u2019Zich was sure that his name was something like Biyom Dracul.\u2018He is a bad guy, right?\u2019Biyom satisfied all the conditions: he tried to kill Joachim, who had no greed for power and worked hard to fight the epidemic, simply because Joachim was a threat to his authority.\u2018How should I fuck up this guy?\u2019Zich\u2019s head spun, but then he realized that he was still in the middle of a conversation with Brod and pushed this thought into the corner of his mind.\u201cWhen is his departure date? Because of the connection we made over these past weeks, I want to help this time too.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you serious?\u201dBrod\u2019s face immediately brightened up. Like that, Zich returned to a village infested by an epidemic again.* * *Drop!Hans threw down a corpse into a large pit. The corpse waved limply like a doll that a child got bored of and discarded. Yet, it might have been wrong to compare the corpse to a doll. The corpse, which had died after going through all kinds of pain and despair, looked gruesome. However, Hans was used to seeing corpses in such states now. He had seen countless corpses over his stay in the village, and he worked mechanically like a machine.Tree branches soaked in oil fell over the corpses, and over it, a torch fell.Craaaackle!A fire erupted out of the hole. The oil-soaked branches fueled the fire and continued to let it burn. After checking the pit swirl with fire and heat, people increased their distance from the hazard. Even if they were now used to this work, they still disliked the sight and smell of burning corpses. However, no one completely left the area. Everyone backed away to an area that didn\u2019t smell as much and stared at the flaming pit as if they were standing in front of a solemn funeral.\u201cThat was the last one,\u201d Hans said calmly, and Snoc sniffled beside him. No matter how much they got used to the work, they couldn\u2019t help but feel emotional after seeing the last villager burn. In the end, everyone in this village also died. The villagers\u2019 symptoms were like the symptoms from the last epidemic that they saw and were all truly sickening diseases.Failing gave them a bad feeling. However, they couldn\u2019t go on with this depressing mood; although failing felt terrible, they had already gone through it hundreds and thousands of times. Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t like they were the ones who set this goal.\u2018Since he is going to buy time by making us stay here for a couple weeks anyway, I should start making my plans.\u2019Zich\u2019s plan was to fuck up Biyom Dracul. Zich barely repressed his laughter that was about to come out. No matter how heartless or impudent Zich was, he at least had enough self-restraint to not laugh in this kind of atmosphere.People didn\u2019t leave the area until all the flames disappeared, as if they were wishing for the happiness and fortune of all those who died. Like that, the fire was extinguished. After that, they finally burned the whole village down and finished cleaning up. Then, they sent the news to Ospurin that their work was over. However, they didn\u2019t receive any orders to return.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThey had already gone through the same situation. Since it was their second time receiving such a cold response from the estate, people weren\u2019t surprised and spent the next couple of days in silence. Some people even brought leisure games such as chess or books to pass the time. Still, it didn\u2019t change the fact that they were all wasting their time.But Zich couldn\u2019t allow Hans and Snoc to spend their time idly. He thought he had given them enough time to rest while they were staying at the hotel in Ospurin.\u201cHuff! Huff!\u201d\u201cHaa! Haa!\u201dHarsh breaths kept escaping out of Hans and Snoc\u2019s mouths. Saliva dried off their lips, their mouths gave off a stuffy smell, and their clothes were soaked with sweat. Yet, Zich\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t hold an ounce of sympathy in them.\u201cYour arms are starting to fall, huh?\u201dZich raised his voice; and Hans and Snoc fixed their position instantly. The two were bending their knees like they were sitting on a chair and raising their arms in a horseback riding pose. However, they weren\u2019t doing the normal version of the pose. Pouches filled with stones from their surroundings hung from all over their bodies. In addition, they weren\u2019t even allowed to use their mana and had to endure the weights with just their muscles. Sweat poured down from their bodies like rain.\u201cYou have to train your physique thoroughly. If you thought that there was no need to physically train because of mana or your power over the earth, immediately throw away such thoughts! The only thing you can believe in an emergency is your physical abilities.\u201dZich also worked to increase his physical skills to their maximum potential. This process only involved simple, hard work. It was something that even Zich couldn\u2019t substitute with knowledge or tricks. And even if there was an efficient path, there were no easy paths.\u201cBesides, physical training will help you in normal times. If you guys were magicians, I might not have made you go through all of this. But you guys are not rear-supporters like them! Snoc! Using your power over the earth, you can attack from close-by and far away as well. Not doing all you can do is just being lazy.\u201dZich\u2019s eyes looked at Hans this time.\u201cAnd Hans, you go around with a sword anyway, so you have no excuses! Both of you train properly!\u201d[Yes!]\u201cYour arms are getting lower again!\u201dZich\u2019s voice rang out, and the two fixed their positions again. The training continued, and Hans and Snoc endured it with all they had. Small groans escaped their lips, but they didn\u2019t cry out. Even if they cried out in intense pain, they knew that the possibility of Zich shortening or stopping their training was a far-fetched fantasy. In fact, they would be grateful if they didn\u2019t get more training for groaning at this level of training.However, today was slightly different.\u201cStop.\u201dDrop!Drop!Hans and Snoc collapsed on the ground. The stone pouches attached to their bodies spilled out. They grabbed their aching muscles and groaned, but even while doing that, the two stared at each other and tilted their heads. Zich wouldn\u2019t have stopped them this early. He would have forced them to maintain this pose at least until sunset.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hans asked.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It seems like we have a guest.\u201d\u201cA guest.\u201d\u201cCome out.\u201dThe bushes rustled and Hans and Snoc raised their guards. People came out of the bush. There were five people in total, and all five of them disguised their identities with black robes. Hans and Snoc didn\u2019t let their guard down\u2014a suspicious person could be much more dangerous than a monster.\u201cWho are you guys?\u201d Zich asked calmly.No one answered, but it wasn\u2019t difficult to guess their motives. Seeing their drawn-out swords, they didn\u2019t seem like they were approaching them with goodwill.\u201cDid you guys come for me?\u201d Zich asked with his eyes wide open like he couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cReally, how come there are so many people who don\u2019t even value their lives?\u201d Zich complained as if the whole world wouldn\u2019t leave him alone when he simply wanted to live in peace. However, his face said the complete opposite.\u201cHey, senior.\u201d Snoc asked Hans.\u201cWhy?\u201dAs if their training wasn\u2019t for naught, Snoc talked to Hans while keeping his eyes on the mysterious intruders.\u201cIn contrast to what he says, Sir Zich looks very happy. Am I mistaken?\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019ve correctly judged his expression.\u201dHans\u2019 gaze on the mysterious figures changed from wariness to sympathy.\u201cIt\u2019s because playthings have come at the right moment when he was bored.\u201dIn addition, the people who appeared right in front of him looked undeniably \u201cbad\u201d.Although Hans and Snoc talked in hushed voices, everyone within the area had enough training to hear their conversation. As if their pride had been hurt, bloodthirst exploded out of the robed figures. The intent was strong enough to make Hans and Snoc flinch, and Hans instinctively reached for his sword while Snoc touched the ground with his hands. However, Zich remained calm.\u201cWho sent you?\u201dThere was no answer again. However, Zich also didn\u2019t expect a response.\u201cOkay, let me see. I can tell that you guys are assassins. I wonder who has a grudge against me?\u201dBefore his regression, Zich didn\u2019t\u2014no, he couldn\u2019t deeply think about matters like this. Even without deep contemplation, Zich thought of many people, as many as the fingers and toes on his hands and feet who wanted to kill him. And if he thought a little deeper, he would need more than a hundred thousand pairs of hands and feet to count the total number of people who held a serious grudge against him.However, Zich was living a second life. He was clean and pure. He could only count the people who wanted to kill him with one hand.Some might have thought it was problematic that there were already people who wanted revenge on Zich so soon after his regression and his decision to live a kind life. However, the assassins\u2019 appearance made Zich feel more accomplished.\u2018To think that I can count the number of people who want revenge with just one hand. I am living this life right.\u2019 Zich rejoiced.The first possible suspects were the Steelwalls, but as soon as he thought of them, Zich erased them from his mind.\u2018They are busy organizing their house. They won\u2019t have time to spare for me, and they don\u2019t even know where I am.\u2019And considering the Steelwalls\u2019 unique character, they weren\u2019t the type to send assassins. Of course, they were flexible enough to send assassins if a war broke out or if their opponent had sent assassins to them first (such flexibility allowed them to survive on the frontlines). But they also weren\u2019t the type to send assassins to the Count\u2019s eldest son for separating from them when he had already given up the inheritance.The next line of people Zich thought of was the Bellids. However, the Deputy Mayor had been dragged off, and even the Karuwimans assured Zich that they were going to prevent information about his involvement from spreading to protect his identity. Thus, the Bellid guys were probably only gnashing their teeth at Karuwiman.His third prospect was the assassins at Suol who tried to make Snoc into the Earth\u2019s tyrant.\u2018They look exactly like those guys.\u2019However, Zich killed all the assassins at that time. He didn\u2019t miss a single one, so it didn\u2019t seem likely that their organization received any information about Zich. That led to the fourth prospect: Biyom Dracul. Zich\u2019s help and support to Joachim must have been an eyesore to Biyom.\u2018No, I went too far with that one.\u2019Zich was a collaborator at most; it was too far-fetched to think that Biyom would have already discovered Zich\u2019s skills. In the first place, it was hard to believe that Biyom even knew of Zich\u2019s existence.\u2018Hm, I don\u2019t know.\u2019It only gave him a headache to think about something he didn\u2019t know. Thus, Zich stopped thinking.\u2018I should extract more information after catching them.\u2019\u201cHans, Snoc.\u201d\u201cYes, sir?\u201d\u201cTake one guy each.\u201dBoth of their faces stiffened.\u201cB-But Sir Zich. We don\u2019t have that much strength left from the training. I can\u2019t even move my muscles\u2026\u201dHans, who had served Zich for a bit longer, spoke out on Snoc and his behalf. However, Hans also wasn\u2019t making up excuses. Anybody could see that Hans and Snoc\u2019s bodies weren\u2019t in a good shape. Even if they weren\u2019t able to fulfill the planned training schedule, Zich\u2019s training wasn\u2019t normal. But even Hans didn\u2019t think this excuse would actually work on Zich; and unfortunately for him, these kinds of predictions were always right.\u201cWhat if in the future you defeat an enemy using everything you have, but the enemy\u2019s support arrives afterward? Then, are you going to tell them, \u2018I\u2019m tired, so let\u2019s fight next time?\u2019 Do you think your opponent will really say, \u2018Okay then, I will come later?\u2019\u201dOf course, his protest didn\u2019t work on Zich. Hans forcefully moved his weak legs. His legs trembled like he was a newborn deer, and as he lifted his sword, his arms trembled too. His sword felt like a lump of iron. The sword, which had felt familiar after swinging it around for so long, now felt unfamiliar to him. But in comparison to him, Snoc still had more leeway. Even without muscles or stamina, Snoc could easily use his versatile skills with mana.However, Zich didn\u2019t want Snoc to have it easy.\u201cSnoc, coat yourself with rock armor and only injure your opponent with a sword. And Nowem, get off of him.\u201d\u201cEhh!\u201dSnoc screamed at the command that bound both his hands and feet.Koo\u2026Nowem didn\u2019t want to part from Snoc, and he glanced at Zich. However, he saw Zich\u2019s menacing glare and jumped off Snoc\u2019s shoulders. Although Nowem used to be the symbol of terror as the great Mining Monster, he couldn\u2019t defy Zich. That was how scared he was of Zich.\u201cGood. If both of you are prepared, put some distance between each other. I\u2019m going to throw each of you an opponent.\u201dZich talked as if he was sharing some fish he was going to catch, and Hans and Snoc put some distance between each other as Zich told them to.The assassins were furious at Zich\u2019s words, and they didn\u2019t feel the need to hold back. They quickly began to move. Although Zich decided that Hans and Snoc would each get an assassin, none of the assassins intended to follow that. They all rushed towards Zich, who was the closest one to them. They planned to finish off Zich first and deal with Hans and Snoc later since they both looked exhausted.Five daggers lunged toward Zich at once, and in response, Zich took out a sword.Chachachachang!There were five consecutive sounds. As if they had planned before, all the assassins raised their daggers at the same time. Of course, they hadn\u2019t made a plan like that\u2014it was because Zich had bounced off all their daggers at once.Zich walked towards the assassins who were now full of openings.Punch! Punch!With two loud crashing sounds, two of the assassins\u2019 bodies bounced off. Considering that their bodies were flying into the air, they didn\u2019t receive much damage. The two assassins laughed at Zich\u2019s light kicks and landed on the ground lightly. However, when they saw that there was a person next to them, they scowled because they realized the purpose of Zich\u2019s attacks and why he had kicked them into the air.\u201cFinish them well!\u201dAfter delivering one assassin to Hans and Snoc each, Zich smiled at the three assassins left in front of him.\u201cYou guys can play with me. Don\u2019t worry. I will go easy on you guys so that you can still move your mouths afterwards.\u201dZich swung his sword at the assassins again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One sword constantly collided against three daggers, and the sound of their sharp exchanges rang across the whole space. However, this battle only looked fierce. Zich and even the assassins knew that the battle was not intense for Zich at all.While fighting, Zich calmly analyzed his opponents. \u2018Hmmm. There\u2019s no special technique in their movements or skills.\u2019The assassins lowered their stance and desperately tried to find any openings in Zich\u2019s attacks. However, no matter how hard they tried to find openings, Zich blocked all of their attacks with complete ease\u2014eventually, they had no choice but to accept their assured defeat.If Zich wanted to summarize his current battle in one sentence, it would be: \u2018I\u2019m playing with them.\u2019 He was going to \u2018play\u2019 with the assassins, and the assassins would have no choice but to follow his lead. Zich\u2019s easygoing attitude in this battle was not a good sight to see. Regardless of how great the difference in their strengths was, carelessness could lead to dangerous mistakes.On the other hand, Zich didn\u2019t just \u2018play\u2019 absentmindedly either. He was trying to find clues about the assassins\u2019 identities by drawing out their different skills and movements. However, the assassins\u2019 movements were sharp but colorless; their movements held no shred of ingenuity or uniqueness. Even though they were getting pushed back, it was only because they had little experience with one-on-one fights and because their opponent was Zich. Their skills and movements were perfect as assassins.\u2018Their organization won\u2019t be easy to take care of.\u2019In order to make people into assassins like this\u2014with no special characteristics or style but a \u2018tool\u2019 to kill\u2014the organization needed to go through a considerable amount of investment and hard work.\u2018Should I capture one of them and ask?\u2019Zich\u2019s sword style changed. In an instant, he flicked away all the assassins\u2019 daggers and began to push them back.\u2018First, I got the three of them.\u2019Zich recalled how the assassins he met in Suol exploded themselves to stop him. During that time, he had no time to even capture one of the assassins. But now, he had more time than he needed.\u2018I\u2019m just going to get one of them for now.\u2019Zich was about to make a guy next to him faint, but the assassin suddenly reached out with his hands.Booom!An explosion erupted. Hans and Snoc, who were each taking care of an assassin, jumped in surprise. While they were fighting their opponents, they snuck a glance towards the explosion.\u201cSir Z-Zich?\u201d Snoc asked Zich with concern in his voice. The assassins fighting Hans and Snoc made low laughs, as if they were confident that Zich had died. Snoc bit his lip in worry.However, Hans was not worried at all.Whoosh!Hans just made one quick glance towards Zich\u2019s direction and began swinging his sword towards his opponent again. The assassin who had been laughing a moment ago hurriedly attempted to block Hans\u2019 sword in surprise.\u2018There\u2019s no way Sir Zich will die from that.\u2019Hans was calmer than Snoc, because he had stayed a longer time with Zich and had a higher level of trust.\u2018If Sir Zich died from something like that, the Steelwall family wouldn\u2019t have fallen into a state of chaos, and I wouldn\u2019t have been dragged all the way here.\u2019With this thought in his mind, Hans\u2019 sword style became rougher.Flash!The aftermath of the explosion disappeared in an instant. The assassins, who had moved their bodies back since the beginning of the explosion, shivered in shock. As Hans expected, Zich was calmly standing in the middle of where the explosion erupted.\u201cOh, it\u2019s an artifact?\u201dZich was in a good mood. He was familiar with this style of attack, and how the assassins carried around artifacts.\u201cIt\u2019s you guys.\u201dZich was elated to see assassins from the same organization like the ones in Suol. Zich\u2019s happy expression was like a tiger jumping into a herd of sheep.A promise was a promise. Zich wanted to fervently keep his promise with the robed man in Suol\u2014that as soon as he met anyone in his organization, he would send them to his side in hell. So far, the assassins had only lasted this long because Zich went easy on them. As soon as he became more serious, his opponents were pushed back mercilessly. The assassins used up their artifacts without reservation, and Zich sliced through all of them.\u201cAgh!\u201dA long wound appeared on one of the assassin\u2019s bodies. It was not enough to warrant death, but it was impossible for the injured assassin to continue fighting.\u2018Done with one.\u2019Worried that they might sacrifice themselves, Zich raised his sword towards their heads to make them faint. However, before he could make them faint, one of the two remaining assassins blew a whistle.Fweeet!\u201cTch!\u201dNoticing that something was off, Zich clicked his tongue.Crashhh!An explosion that was incomparably larger than the first one erupted. The magnitude of the explosion was not large, but the intensity of the explosion was at the highest level. While crushing their own bodies, the assassins attempted to harm Zich. However, as if he was escaping small fiery sparks, Zich dusted off his clothes and moved away from the explosion.\u2018This is why I wanted to quickly finish this.\u2019If they were assassins from the same organization as the one from Suol, there was a high chance that they would explode themselves. With that thought in mind, Zich had wanted to quickly capture them.\u2018The quality of their skills is actually higher than the ones from Suol.\u2019When the robed man told Zich that he had quickly gathered a group of \u201clow-level\u201d assassins for his mission in Suol, it seemed the robed man was telling him the truth. Zich turned around. Hans and Snoc were on the ground and blinking their eyes. They were full of scratches and some of the injuries looked very deep, but they didn\u2019t look like they were about to die. Before the assassins exploded themselves, Zich blew away their opponents, so Snoc and Hans had time to escape.\u201cWhat are you doing? Get up.\u201dHans and Snoc quickly got up with Zich\u2019s command. After giving each of them a potion, Zich looked back at the sight of the explosion. He felt regretful that he wasn\u2019t able to get more information out of them, but he soon dusted away this feeling. The assassins he just fought didn\u2019t seem like they knew any important secrets. But most of all\u2014\u2018I think I\u2019m going to see more of them in the future.\u2019Zich was sure of it.* * *It was late in the night. Zich stuffed more sticks into the bonfire and tried to keep the fire going. Tired from their long and arduous battle, Hans and Snoc crashed to bed as soon as they got the chance. On the other hand, Zich looked like a carefree man immersed in his daily routine, as he looked over his fire. Yet, he was deeply lost in thought, thinking about the assassins they beat today.\u2018Without a doubt, I\u2019m sure they are from the same organization as the ones from Suol. But I wonder why those guys are here right now.\u2019Zich tried to analyze the assassins he met in Suol. First, their goal was related to Snoc and Nowem, and their main goal was to make Nowem into the \u2018Tyrant of the Earth.\u2019 Before the incident, Zich had never imagined that Nowem (who caused a whole kingdom to collapse before he regressed) could have been made in such a forceful manner.\u2018I wonder why they are trying to make Nowem or Demon People in general, and what they are doing all the way here. If I assume that they still have similar goals\u2026\u2019Joachim was here. In the distant future, Joachim would become the \u2018The Demonic Vampire\u2019 and serve under Zich, the Demon Lord.\u2018They keep appearing near places where Demon People will appear.\u2019Zich didn\u2019t want to exclude the possibility of a coincidence, but he felt as if these two events were deeply connected.\u2018If these guys are really the bastards who tried to make Joachim into a Demon Person, then\u2026\u2019To think about it, Zich remembered that a bunch of Demon People came out during this time\u2014to the extent it would be called the Demon People Era.\u2018Is there a group of people actually trying to make Demon People?\u2019If this was true, it would be an extremely newsworthy event, because it meant someone or some group was controlling people into becoming Demon People and unleashing chaos into this world.\u2018Of course, they probably didn\u2019t make every Demon Person. I\u2019m sure there were those who naturally became a Demon Person like me\u2026\u2019Zich\u2019s face suddenly turned deathly serious.\u2018Wait, is there any evidence that my transformation as a Demon Person really had no outside influence?\u2019There was no evidence. In the first place, Zich had never thought that an organization was purposely making Demon People. As Snoc became \u2018The Tyrant of the Earth, Nowem\u2019 because of the assassins, how could he be so sure that there was no one trying to make him the \u2018Demon Lord of Strength, Zich Moore?\u2019\u2018To think about it, as soon as I left the Steelwall family, I experienced various events as if someone had planned it all out.\u2019And all the events were perfectly laid out for Zich to become a Demon Person.\u2018I just thought that the world was chaotic, so I experienced a lot of dangerous situations, but\u2026\u2019But what if they were the result of someone else?\u2018\u2026This is interesting.\u2019Up until now, Zich thought he became a Demon Lord through his own free will. But now there was a possibility that someone decided his whole path from the very beginning.\u2018Okay, let\u2019s calm down for now. I\u2019m not even sure if this is certain.\u2019But no matter how much Zich thought about it, he could not help but feel pissed. Before he regressed, there were many frustrating situations, but this was the first time he felt really annoyed.\u2018This means that there might be some bastards who used me like a puppet.\u2019Perhaps, if this was true\u2026\u2018I\u2019m never going to forgive them.\u2019Zich was never going to forgive them. Until now, he just thought of the assassin group as bad guys that irritated him. He simply wanted to send them all to hell whenever he met one of them. But from now on, Zich\u2019s stance on them changed from an irritating group to an \u2018organization that might have played around with his life.\u2019And if this was true, Zich was going to use everything in his power to erase the organization from the face of the Earth. Zich thought all this and then swallowed his anger. Nothing would come off from being angry by himself. Even though Zich usually lived however he felt like, for important matters, he was much more serious. He planned to engrave this anger deep inside his heart and cultivate it further to make it burn hotter, stronger, and sharper.\u2018But why did these guys attack me?\u2019After he swallowed his anger inside, Zich began thinking again.\u2018Do they know I crushed their comrades in Suol?\u2019If the assassins Zich fought today were connected to the assassins in Suol, there was a much higher possibility that this might be true. However, this was not likely. Zich had definitely killed everyone who was involved in Snoc\u2019s kidnapping. The organization wouldn\u2019t have received any news about Zich for that reason. Moreover, Zich also discovered Snoc\u2019s kidnapping by accident so he was sure that he had not been part of the organizations\u2019 plans.\u2018Then what are some other possibilities?\u2019Zich considered the possibility that the Dracul family might be conspiring against Joachim without knowing anything about the assassin organization or what happened in Suol. Then, he thought about how the mysterious organization\u2019s goal here was to make Joachim into a Demon Person. That meant\u2026\u2018Am I an unexpected variable for all of them?\u2019Since he came out of nowhere and began helping Joachim, Zich would have been a hindrance to the organization and Joachim\u2019s family plans. But Zich didn\u2019t make a definite conclusion. So far, it was just one of his highly probable theories.\u2018Then I should stick closely to Joachim for now.\u2019If the organization wanted to make Joachim into a Demon Person, the organization would try all possible means to make contact with him. Since Zich was planning to help out Joachim anyways, this was not a hard decision to make.\u201cYou are not asleep yet.\u201dZich suddenly heard a familiar voice and turned his head back. It was Joachim, and he was moving closer towards him.\u201cHow are you? Is it not time for you to sleep? If you sleep late, it might be difficult for you to wake up in the morning.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for me to do anyways. Is there any reason why I have to wake up early in the morning?\u201dJoachim made a bitter smile. He seemed sad about his current situation since he and his soldiers had to camp out near a village that recently went through an epidemic.\u201cIs it alright if I sit next to you?\u201d\u201cIt would be my pleasure.\u201dZich stared at Joachim who sat across from him. He looked the same as before but a little younger. However, his personality was totally different from Zich\u2019s past life and made Zich wonder how and to what degree he should help Joachim. But he slowly reached his conclusion.\u2018I\u2019m going to at least help him out until I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t become a Demon Person.\u2019Even if Joachim became the Demonic Vampire again, Zich wouldn\u2019t feel any hatred or dislike towards Joachim\u2014instead, he might actually welcome Joachim like an old friend. However, no matter how he saw it, the Vampire, Joachim Dracul, was a bad person. And since Zich made the resolution to live a kind life by beating the crap out of bad guys, his past subordinates couldn\u2019t be an exception to this rule. If Joachim really became a Demon Person, it was likely that Zich might have to fight and kill him off.\u2018For that to not happen, it would be better for him to not become a Demon Person.\u2019 Zich decided.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even a person who didn\u2019t normally stroll for a hobby would have felt a strong urge to go on a walk.\u2018What made him become a Demon Person?\u2019\u2018Currently, there are too few clues. But it must have been something huge for someone who has hemophobia to start using an ability like Blood Domination.\u2019\u201cSir, how is the Count\u2019s condition?\u201d Zich asked to grasp Joachim\u2019s current situation.\u201cYou must have heard the rumors. To tell you the truth, his condition is not very good. It has been half a year since he fainted, but he is still unconscious. I am very worried about him.\u201dZich could see that Joachim was clearly worried for his father. At the least, it didn\u2019t seem like Joachim was the type of son who wanted his father to die to gain more power.\u2018It\u2019s probably different for that bastard Biyom though.\u2019\u201cI guess that\u2019s why the first son of Count Dracul has full authority.\u201d\u201cWell, he is the oldest. Of course, he should take it.\u201dBut Joachim\u2019s voice had a hint of bitterness to it that indicated his negative feelings towards Biyom. From then on, Zich continued to ask about Joachim\u2019s current situation. Of course, Zich was indirect in his questions since he didn\u2019t want to raise Joachim\u2019s suspicions.Many conversations passed between them, but Zich wasn\u2019t able to gain much information. However, it wasn\u2019t all useless since he gained assurance that his guesses had been correct.\u2018The Count lost consciousness half a year ago, and he is still bedridden. Biyom Dracul took that chance to grasp power, and he is now pushing Joachim and his forces to the edge. It\u2019s a common story.\u2019If he looked around the world, Zich would be able to find at least dozens of similar stories. Then Zich suddenly came up with a funny thought.\u2018Should I play a trick and make Joachim Dracul succeed as the Count?\u2019It wasn\u2019t a bad thought.\u2018Then, I can fuck over Biyom at the same time.\u2019The best way that Zich liked to play with people was to give them a false sense of hope and quickly take it away; but he also liked the method of taking away what his opponent wanted or valued the most.\u2018I should stay next to Joachim and make him the Count. At the same time, I can beat up the assassins who\u2019d probably come to make Joachim into a Demon Person and extract information from them.\u2019It was a plan that perfectly suited Zich\u2019s tastes. If he wanted to carry out this plan, Zich had to establish a greater sense of trust with Joachim. He couldn\u2019t simply remain as the traveler who helped Joachim greatly; he had to become a confidant who Joachim trusted enough to confide in about the next course of action.With that in mind, Zich talked to Joachim all night. He lacked time, especially considering that Joachim would likely be confined in his room again when he returned to Ospurin. However, Zich\u2019s worries about lacking time disappeared when Joachim\u2019s task force received another order from the castle. It was a shitty order that told them to relocate immediately to another village hit by an epidemic.* * *Soldiers skillfully blocked the roads leading to the third village and separated the infected villagers from the uninfected villagers. Their bodies were now accustomed to the work. After they separated the villagers into different zones, they began to give out treatments. However, since they had failed to save the first and second village, no one was hopeful about their ability to save the third village. And they began their work with low spirits.In addition, there were significant casualties among the task force. Although the soldiers and caretakers had taken extra precautions when dealing with the patients, some were infected. If most of Joachim\u2019s task force couldn\u2019t control mana and didn\u2019t have a strong immunity towards diseases, they might all have died like the villagers. Naturally, people\u2019s morale was at rock bottom.Then, they realized that the disease spreading in the third village was different. Its deterioration rate was slow, and symptoms weren\u2019t as severe as before. It was a terrifying thing to discover a new disease with a high number of infectants, but everyone\u2019s faces were bright. They hoped for survivors this time.But even that hope soon disappeared. Although the disease\u2019s deterioration rate was different this time, in the end, its fatality rate was also 100 percent. Just like that, the third village disappeared. And something that happened three times was bound to happen another time; an epidemic spread in another village, and the task force forced themselves to move once again.As he moved the corpses again, Zich scowled.\u2018This is definitely weird.\u2019Not only was it strange that there were so many outbreaks, the infection and fatality rates were way higher than normal. Furthermore, all the villages were at a considerable distance from each other. If the epidemic had spread across closeby villages, the trend was understandable, but that was not the case.\u2018It almost seems like someone has purposely staged it.\u2019Zich analyzed the information he already knew, such as the assassins he met some days ago. However, there was no need for him to deeply think about this matter. The word epidemic immediately made him think of one person.\u2018Did that bastard already begin to move?\u2019Zich didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s name, age, or gender. However, there was a figure who left clear marks in history and made the whole world tremble in fear just by their nickname. Their appearance started with the extinction of a kingdom\u2019s capital due to diseases. Because the world was in chaos, the medical system, managed by multiple countries, couldn\u2019t operate properly, and epidemics spread easily through armed conflicts. Thus, in the beginning, people simply thought that a severe epidemic was spreading.However, the epidemic started to spread all over the world and began to kill more humans; and soon, people realized that there was a being artificially spreading diseases all over the world. They only found out about the being\u2019s existence and didn\u2019t find out anything about their identity. As a result, people began to call the person who could control diseases with the name: \u201cDemon Person, Fest\u201d.\u2018The only thing well-known about Fest was that Glen Zenard killed them. Their identity was a mystery till the very end. But was that Demon person here at a time like this?\u2019It was too early to be sure, but there was a possibility.\u2018If Fest is here, that means there are two people who could be Demon People here.\u2019Two Demon People. Before the regression, any normal person would have flipped their eyes and thrown a commotion at hearing that there were not just one but two Demon People in their residence.\u2018Anyhow, I think I\u2019ll only be able to find a solution after returning to Ospurin.\u2019There was nothing much he could do while he was stuck in the countryside. In the worst-case scenario, Zich planned to leave Joachim\u2019s side for a moment to make some changes in Ospurin. Yet, since Fest might be involved in this case, Zich decided to wait and watch for a little longer.\u2018If Fest is involved, I will have to return to Ospurin anyways.\u2019A few days later, all of Zich\u2019s predictions were proven exactly right. After they burned the fourth village down and finished all their work, everyone\u2019s expectations were at the lowest of the low. They expected to go to another village soon. Yet, in contrast to their expectations, they received an order to return as soon as possible.At the capital of the Dracul estate, Opsurin, an epidemic was spreading.* * *They were finally going back as they wanted, but there were shadows cast on people\u2019s faces. The capital city was being swept by an epidemic, and they didn\u2019t know how severe the situation was.The fact that Ospurin was hit by an epidemic seemed to indicate the severity of their situation\u2014especially considering that the current diseases were worse than anything they had ever seen. The task force quickened its footsteps. A large portion of the party, especially knights and officers of high position, had families in Ospurin.When they arrived at Ospurin, the situation wasn\u2019t as hellish as they expected it to be. But the ominous black smoke that shot up into the clear sky made their hearts heavy.Joachim led his forces to Ospurin and observed the civilians\u2019 complexions as he headed for the castle. He could instantly tell that there were fewer people in the streets than usual; and the faces of people who were wandering around were filled with fear. But thankfully, the epidemic didn\u2019t seem to have completely spread throughout the entire city.\u201cOpen the gates!\u201d Joachim shouted when he arrived at the castle. Before, the gatekeepers turned away Zich and his companions under Biyom\u2019s orders, but this time, they opened the path for them.\u2018I don\u2019t know the exact situation, but it seems like the residents in the castle are taking this current situation very seriously.\u2019For Zich, this was welcoming news. He had to get inside the castle to retrieve information so that he could stir something up.Even if everyone was allowed past the castle\u2019s gates, not everyone could enter the castle. Joachim picked his closest subordinates and asked Zich to also accompany him. This was because Joachim thought he would need Zich\u2019s broad knowledge and wisdom; besides, Zich\u2019s efforts to earn Joachim\u2019s trust was also paying off.When Zich entered the castle, he could finally meet Biyom face-to-face.\u2018He looks like the opposite of Joachim.\u2019In comparison to Joachim who was tall and skinny to the point that he looked gaunt, Biyom was short and obese.\u2018How can brothers be so different from each other?\u2019The only characteristic they shared was that they both looked like they were suffering from a chronic disease.\u201cI have arrived, brother.\u201dJoachim\u2019s voice was filled with dissatisfaction. It was natural for Joachim to feel this after all he had gone through; he and his task force had moved from one disease-ridden village to the next without much rest. Considering all this, it was astonishing how little dissatisfaction he showed.\u201cWelcome.\u201dBiyom\u2019s response wasn\u2019t all that great, and it was clear that he didn\u2019t look favorably towards Joachim. However, his eyes, which looked smaller under the piles of fat, darted and made him look anxious.\u201cYou heard about the situation, right?\u201d\u201cThat an epidemic was going around Ospurin?\u201d\u201cYeah, as I expected, it seems like you guys brought the diseases from the villages.\u201dThis was absurd. The words he said to his younger brother after Joachim worked so hard in the infected villages were unbelievable. However, Joachim was used to this, and he didn\u2019t get agitated. Zich thought it was ridiculous that Joachim was even used to a situation like this.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. To prevent ourselves from spreading the diseases, we waited for a long time before we returned to the city. There was no one who developed symptoms in that waiting period.\u201d\u201cThere could have been someone who showed symptoms, and you might have hidden that fact!\u201dJoachim let out a sigh. \u201cThen, what should we do now? Should we stay far away from Ospurin again? Should we stay there for several months this time?\u201d\u201cObviously you and your men should do that, but since I\u2019m so generous, I will give you a chance to make up for the sins you might have committed. Stop the epidemic from spreading in Ospurin.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dJoachim wasn\u2019t even surprised since he had expected this response. If it weren\u2019t for this reason, their return would have been pushed back even further.\u2018I guess he considers me experienced in this field.\u2019Joachim mocked himself. It was ridiculous to call himself experienced when he couldn\u2019t save a village even once. But soon, Joachim made a firm resolve. This was the Dracul estate capital, Ospurin. If this city also reached the same fate as the villages, the number of deaths would be incomparable to the ones in the villages.\u2018I really have to stop the epidemic this time.\u2019\u201cI will move immediately, so please give us some support.\u201d\u201cI will leave that up to Shalom.\u201dThe old man beside Biyom nodded slightly. Was he serious? Biyom had continuously played tricks on their support supplies, so Joachim looked at him doubtfully; but in the end, he looked away.\u2018He can\u2019t play his usual tricks since Ospurin is involved.\u2019Joachim moved out to begin his work in stopping the epidemic, but as he was leaving, he heard Biyom\u2019s voice.\u201cAh, and don\u2019t think about returning to the castle until the epidemic is over. The epidemic can\u2019t spread inside the castle.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand,\u201d Joachim replied while gritting his teeth and tightly clutching his two fists.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A satisfied smile appeared on his face. He was on the chair that his father, Count Dracul, used to sit on. He couldn\u2019t have been happier to sit on this chair which was a symbol of authority and power. He had always looked up to this chair in envy.As long as he sat on this chair, everyone in the Dracul estate bowed their heads towards him. But the best thing about it was that he could now harass Joachim\u2014the sole object of adoration from his parents. Biyom could never forget the anger he felt when he heard people murmur that the second son was a much better fit for the Count\u2019s position if only he wasn\u2019t so frail.\u2018But that\u2019s over now. In the end, the throne is mine!\u2019Biyom stroked the chair\u2019s arms lovingly, but as he did this, he soon remembered the chair\u2019s original owner.\u2018That old fart. I wish he would just die.\u2019Biyom\u2019s mouth twitched into a smirk as he thought of Count Dracul lying sick on his bed. Biyom had no love for his family. Joachim was simply an obstacle in his life.\u201cHey, Shalom. How is the old man?\u201d Biyom asked the butler next to him. Shalom had served the family for a long time. After the Count collapsed, Biyom left all matters concerning the Count\u2019s care to Shalom. Biyom wasn\u2019t even interested in his father and hadn\u2019t visited the Count for a long time. All he did was ask about his father\u2019s condition from time to time.\u201cHe is still unconscious, sir.\u201d\u201cNo signs of improvement?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, no, sir.\u201dTo hide the corners of his mouth, Biyom exaggeratedly rubbed his cheeks.\u201cThat is quite worrisome. Father should wake up quickly.\u201dBiyom spat out words that he didn\u2019t even mean. Shalom bowed his head like he was sorry.\u201cBut is this really all right? You know, the epidemic.\u201dBiyom\u2019s look of self-satisfaction was quickly replaced by an anxious expression. Even Biyom was worried that the epidemic might invade the castle.\u201cOf course,\u201d Shalom replied firmly. \u201cIf we think about the report that Sir Joachim sent us, the diseases spreading in the countryside were as severe as they could possibly be. However, the disease going around Ospurin is not up to that level. I went through it in the past as well.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cSending Sir Joachim to infected villages to get rid of him is helping us now. Since he has gained a lot of experience, he would be able to retain this level of an epidemic.\u201d\u201cHmph! Are you saying that trash is useful for something?\u201dAt the mention of Joachim\u2019s name, Biyom\u2019s mood worsened.\u201cWas there a need to call him to the castle? I could have just given him the mission immediately. What if they really were the ones who brought in the epidemic?\u201dShalom sighed in his mind, but he didn\u2019t show it.\u201cThere are still some voices who sympathize with Sir Joachim who had continued to go around to infected villages.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a treacherous group like that?\u201dTreacherous? Biyom was standing in place of his father, but he wasn\u2019t even the Count yet. Furthermore, Joachim was also the Count\u2019s son, so it was unreasonable to say that those who sympathized with Joachim were disloyal. However, an argument like that didn\u2019t work on people like Biyom.\u201cWhile it is true that there are many fools, humans are naturally foolish creatures. Sir, it is also the responsibility of a person in power to appease and soothe them.\u201d\u201cHmm, I see.\u201dA person in power\u2014those words sounded sweet to Biyom.\u201cThey also probably feel anxious that an epidemic is spreading around Ospurin.\u201d\u201cHow could they feel anxious just by that? What scaredy-cats\u2026\u201dDid Biyom have the memory of a goldfish? Or else, he wouldn\u2019t have forgotten about how he reacted to the epidemic in Ospurin a couple of minutes ago. Still, Shalom continued to bow his head without mentioning it.\u201cSince your lordship personally issued this command, they won\u2019t be able to say anything more about this matter. They have to repress their complaints about this and live on.\u201d\u201cWell, good. I understand your reasoning for bringing him into the castle. But what happens if that guy successfully stops the epidemic in Ospurin? Then what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cSince he would have made a worthy contribution, we can give him a sufficient reward and send him back to the countryside. There are still more villages suffering from epidemics.\u201d\u201cYeah, I see.\u201dBiyom snickered. A feudal lord with common sense\u2014whether they were clean or corrupt\u2014 wouldn\u2019t have been glad that an epidemic was spreading around his estate. However, Biyom was pleased about the epidemic since it could get rid of Joachim. And because Biyom was so preoccupied with his thoughts, he didn\u2019t notice Shalom\u2019s chilly, cold glare.* * *Shalom went inside a large and fancy room. The castle was immense and luxurious to help preserve the family\u2019s dignity, but even among the compartments in the castle, this room was special. It was Count Dracul\u2019s personal room.In the middle of the room, a man was lying on an ornate bed as big as a room; he was the lord of the Dracul estate. Although the Count had managed the estate with his strong charisma and outstanding skills, now he was an ill man with a sickly appearance.\u201cStay outside for a bit.\u201dShalom told this to the maid who was nursing the Count. The maid bowed her head and left, and only the Count and Shalom were left in the room. Shalom stared down at the Count on the bed, and only the sound of the Count\u2019s faint breaths could be heard in the quiet room.Shalom ruffled through his clothes and took out a small bottle. When he flicked the bottle cap open, a tiny amount of liquid swished inside. Then he took the bottle to the Count\u2019s face and tilted it under the Count\u2019s nose.Drip!The liquid instantly vaporized and went into the Count\u2019s nose. The Count\u2019s face turned all red, but the next moment, he regained his color as if the change had never taken place.\u201c\u2026All this is your karma.\u201dIt was difficult to understand what Shalom meant. After saying these words, Shalom turned around and left the room.* * *Joachim ran to work against the epidemic as soon as he got out of the castle. His close associates and Zich\u2019s companions followed him from behind. The area where the outbreak occurred was in the southwestern part of Ospurin.\u201cHow is the situation?\u201d Joachim asked.Fortunately, it didn\u2019t seem like Biyom interfered with the task forces at Ospurin, and all the soldiers there followed Joachim\u2019s orders.\u201cWe locked down all the areas where an infected person was found and blocked the entrance!\u201d\u201cWhere are the locked-down areas?\u201dA soldier handed him a map that marked all the places in Ospurin. All the southwest areas were colored in red; they seemed like the area where the epidemic was spreading the most. It wasn\u2019t as large as Joachim thought, and a sense of relief passed across his face. But his face quickly stiffened again, and he sharpened his focus.\u201cWhat are the symptoms?\u201d\u201cCoughing, fever, rash, vomiting, loss of appetite, and so on. The doctors say that there\u2019s a high chance that the disease is Igram.\u201dIgram was one of the diseases that appeared periodically in the city; it wasn\u2019t one of the terrifying diseases that Joachim had witnessed in the villages. However, Joachim didn\u2019t relax since it could be another disease with initial symptoms similar to Igram.\u201cWhat is the total number of casualties?\u201d\u201cCounting yesterday\u2019s numbers, the total is sixty.\u201d\u201cWhen did it start?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have the exact date, but we think it has been at least two weeks.\u201dSixty people in two weeks\u2014that meant thirty people died per week. The face of the soldier giving the report was filled with fear and despair. As people lost their strength and motivation, there could be more casualties. Yet, Joachim felt hope.\u2018That\u2019s all?\u2019In comparison to the diseases he had seen, the disease in Ospurin seemed\u2014it didn\u2019t seem right to say this but\u2026it was like an angel. If the disease\u2019s symptoms were similar to the one he had seen in the villages, Joachim thought he would have to forcefully empty out the entire city. Of course, he would only be able to do that with Biyom\u2019s permission, and it wasn\u2019t guaranteed that Biyom would allow it.\u201cMaybe this time\u2026!\u201dJoachim thought that they could beat this damn disease. He energized himself again and gave out orders.* * *\u2018He is young.\u2019Zich thought like an old man as he watched Joachim passionately work to overcome an epidemic.\u2018Then should I start moving too?\u2019They returned to Ospurin. Unlike the time they were stuck in a countryside village, they had many more options in the city.\u2018For now, I will move with the assumption that Fest is here.\u2019Zich glanced at the state of the patients.\u2018It\u2019s a normal infectious disease.\u2019It was ridiculous to attach the word \u2018normal\u2019 to an infectious disease, but when talking about Fest, the story changed. Besides, Zich had witnessed all kinds of terrifying diseases in the past too.\u2018There\u2019s even a person who fully recovered this time.\u2019Of course, the disease that Fest spread didn\u2019t kill every infected person. However, everyone who overcame Fest\u2019s disease had considerable power or was treated with special medicine. Even from the rumors, Zich had never heard of an ordinary person recovering.\u2018Medicine only worked in the beginning too.\u2019When people found out about Fest\u2019s existence and diseases spread, there was a great effort to find appropriate cures. Quite a lot of medicine was quickly made to fight against Fest\u2019s early diseases. Yet, as medicine and cures progressed, Fest\u2019s diseases also progressed.\u2018Later on, there wasn\u2019t even a medicine to fight against the infectious diseases.\u2019Fest was a truly horrifying Demon Person that the whole world feared. But the disease in Ospurin wasn\u2019t like Fest\u2019s notorious diseases. Zich thought of the disease\u2019s symptoms again.\u2018I think it\u2019s really Igram.\u2019It might be a \u201cnormal\u201d infectious disease that had existed since ancient times instead of Fest\u2019s infamous diseases.\u2018It could really be a normal disease.\u201dYet, Zich also knew that someone like Fest, who controlled all kinds of different diseases, would also have no problem using a disease that already existed.\u2018However, Fest is not someone who would do that.\u2019There were so many gruesome diseases; for what reason would Fest spread such a normal disease? If Fest was doing something that they normally didn\u2019t do, it was likely that Fest was scheming something. And there was no way that Fest\u2019s scheme would benefit the city. But Zich knew that even the worst situation could turn into an opportunity if used well enough.\u2018If I disclose Fest\u2019s scheme or kill Fest and give the credit to Joachim, it would help him in becoming the Count.\u2019From the first place, Zich was planning to kill Demon People (unless they were special cases like Snoc\u2019s), so if he used Fest to achieve his plans, it didn\u2019t sound like a bad idea.\u2018They are not helpful to anyone anyways, so I should use them to help others.\u2019A person like Joachim deserved to get Zich\u2019s support and achievement; he was someone who dragged his frail body into situations that could kill him and worked his hardest to stop the epidemic.\u2018The problem is that Joachim might not want to take the credit.\u2019If Zich thought of Joachim\u2019s personality, there was a high probability that this could happen. However, that didn\u2019t pose a great problem. Zich could prepare the right timing to let Joachim contribute or make Joachim think he was the one who uncovered Fest\u2019s plans.\u2018First, I have to find what kind of person Fest is. That\u2019ll make it easier for me to plan.\u2019Even before his regression, the only ones who knew Fest\u2019s identity were Glen Zenard and his party. Besides that, there were only fragments of information about Fest. Since Fest had created so many terrible and horrifying infectious diseases, there were rumors that all sources about their personal information had been burned up, but even Zich didn\u2019t know the real truth of the matter.\u2018If only Fest was like Sude who naturally had something eerie about him.\u2019However, Zich didn\u2019t have big expectations. Even if he had many experiences under his belt and his intuition was polished as a result, he couldn\u2019t find out everything with just his intuition. In the first place, nothing was more uncertain than intuition. Most of all, people like Fest never did anything that could bring up suspicions.\u2018It can\u2019t be helped. If I can\u2019t find Fest, I have to make that guy come out. I already have something good in mind.\u2019Zich knew the cure to Igram. Before his regression, when Fest\u2019s diseases had turned the world upside down, all kinds of doctors, magicians, holy priests, and other intellectuals worked together to stop the epidemic; and during that time, one of the diseases they successfully solved was Igram.\u2018Because Joachim was interested in infectious diseases, I also picked up a couple of things while looking over his shoulders. I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s helping me now.\u2019Perhaps, the incidents that were occurring right now were what made Joachim interested in infectious diseases.\u2018Since there isn\u2019t a cure for Igram right now, if I make a cure for it, Fest will probably show interest and try to make contact with me. I can also gain Joachim\u2019s trust simultaneously.\u2019The first thing Zich now had to do was show people that he knew the cure for Igram. Zich made his move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since they arrived at the Dracul estate, their battle against diseases continued all the way to Ospurin. At first, Hans really hated his work because he was afraid of the diseases and the patients\u2019 horrifying appearances. Honestly, even now, Hans was not completely free of these feelings.However, his sympathy and pity towards the patients increased over time. When he was unable to save the village, he was so sad that he wanted to burst out crying. And when he heard that there was hope of recovery, Hans worked harder than anyone else to stop the spread of diseases and aided patients. Therefore, all of Hans\u2019 attention was now focused on Zich\u2019s words and the cure he supposedly knew.\u201cSenior, what\u2019s up?\u201dSnoc walked towards Hans. Using his earth powers, Snoc created earth barriers in infected areas and helped quarantine people. Snoc looked at the area where Hans was looking. Naturally, his stare followed the building Zich just entered.\u201cDoes Sir Zich have business to attend to?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of the rumor.\u201dRumor. Hearing this word, Snoc\u2019s eyes changed with a flicker of curiosity.\u201cDo you think it\u2019s real?\u201dAs if he was sharing a secret plan, Snoc whispered directly into Hans\u2019 ears. When Snoc\u2019s breath reached his ears, Hans jumped back and pushed Snoc away with a fierce glare.\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201dSeeing Hans\u2019 reaction, Snoc scratched his cheek in embarrassment; he realized that breathing directly into another person\u2019s ear was rude.Koo!Nowem, who was on Snoc\u2019s shoulder, bit Snoc\u2019s ear as if to scold him. Hans stopped glaring at Snoc and after letting out a sigh, replied to Snoc\u2019s question. \u201cI think there\u2019s a high possibility that Sir Zich is telling the truth. No matter how shi\u2014capricious Sir Zich\u2019s personality is, I don\u2019t think he is the type to lie about stuff like that.\u201dHans almost let it out that he thought Zich had a \u2018shitty personality.\u2019 To his good fortune, it didn\u2019t seem like Snoc noticed.\u201cThen is there really going to be a cure for this disease?\u201dThe rumor was that Zich knew the cure for Igram. Even Snoc had heard about Igram before. It spread multiple times throughout Suol\u2019s history, and while people were drinking in the bar, it came up a few times in conversations; of course, it was not when the bar\u2019s atmosphere was loud and lively but when there was a lot of fear and insecurity spreading among the miners.The Igram disease was incomparably less deadly than the other infectious diseases spreading around the Dracul estate, but it was such a famous disease that even Snoc knew about it. And to know a cure for a disease like that was unheard of!\u201cDon\u2019t spread this rumor around for now. You also know that the second son of Count Dracul is trying to silence this, right?\u201dEven though they deeply trusted Zich, it was hard to believe that he found the cure for Igram. If word got out and Zich failed to produce the cure, the soldiers\u2019 reactions would be full of despair and anger. By nature, people were more vulnerable to despair right after hope.\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Snoc replied confidently as he agreed with Hans\u2019 reasoning.\u201cThen let\u2019s continue our work. I\u2019m going to go help the soldiers, and you check if there\u2019s anything wrong with their behaviors\u2026\u201dHans closed his mouth. Zich got out of the building and headed off to a different place. The building Zich went in had been set aside for the cure\u2019s clinical trials. Since the cure was so significant and precious, not many people knew about this place.Hans quickly tried to gauze Zich\u2019s expression. Zich\u2019s expression was the same as usual: a face full of confidence, almost on the verge of arrogance. However, Zich didn\u2019t always make this expression. When things did not go according to his plan, he would frown or scrunch up his face; of course, compared to other people, his annoyed or mad expressions were very minimal.However, there was no trace of any annoyance or frown on his face.Thus!\u2018He succeeded in finding the cure!\u2019That was what Hans predicted.* * *Zich quickly looked around for Joachim. Like usual, Joachim\u2019s sickly appearance and pained expression were enough to trick people into thinking that he was a patient.\u201cSir.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dJoachim had been intently glaring at the map with infected areas marked on them. He finally raised his head.\u201cFor what reason\u2026!\u201dJoachim was about to ask Zich why he was here, but he jumped up after seeing Zich\u2019s confident smile.\u201cHave you perhaps!\u201d\u201cYes, it is what we have been waiting for.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go there right now!\u201dJoachim placed all other thoughts out of his mind and followed Zich. If the cure worked, all of his problems would disappear at once. Zich and Joachim headed towards the building where clinical trials were taking place. Joachim silently pressured Zich on, and they walked extremely quickly. They were going so fast that Zich became worried Joachim might collapse from exhaustion.Bam!Joachim burst the door open. The inside of the building was the same as when Zich left it.\u201cSir, have you come to visit!\u201dThe caretaker taking care of the patients greeted Joachim. However, Joachim ignored him and surveyed the patients lying on the beds. The patients tried to get up. They didn\u2019t know who Joachim was, but they thought he must be a high official for the caretaker to address him as \u2018sir.\u2019\u201cYou don\u2019t have to get up for me.\u201dJoachim gestured towards the patients, and the patients awkwardly laid back down. Joachim remembered what their conditions were like before. When he first met them, they were very close to dying. If they didn\u2019t receive treatment immediately, they would have not lasted more than a day or two days and ended up as pitiful victims. But now, the patients were looking at him with curiosity with no trace of death in their features. In fact, they looked healthy enough to not be considered patients anymore.\u201cHow do they look?\u201dStanding behind Joachim, Zich asked confidently. Joachim turned around and saw Zich with his arms folded in front of the building\u2019s entrance. Joachim opened his arms wide, walked towards Zich, and gave him a huge hug.\u201cMeeting you was the most fortunate thing that ever happened to me!\u201d* * *\u2018He\u2019s really happy.\u2019Joachim smiled brightly with not a single bit of restraint; anyone could see that he was overjoyed. Considering how much he struggled and worried about the spread of diseases, Joachim\u2019s bliss was expected.\u2018But this is this and that is that.\u2019Zich pushed Joachim away. Zich\u2019s sexual orientation was as straight as an arrow, and he didn\u2019t want to be hugged by a man no matter how good the circumstances were.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. Because I was so happy, I got too excited.\u201dJoachim said this with embarrassment, but his elated expression showed how happy he was. However, as expected of a veteran who spent the past months fighting against infectious diseases, Joachim quickly calmed down and focused on his tasks.\u201cHow much did they improve?\u201dJudging by their appearance, the patients looked fully healed, but Joachim needed to make sure.\u201cMost of the symptoms have disappeared. They still cough sometimes, but it\u2019s very light.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough for people to trust the cure. What did you say the ingredients were?\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of different kinds of medicinal ingredients in it, but the most important ones are Pulazu Leaf, Bukul Root, and Wim Fruit.\u201d\u201cHmm, they are all medicinal ingredients that I\u2019m not familiar with.\u201dEven though Joachim was the leader of the troops fighting against infectious diseases, he was not a doctor or an apothecary; so, it was natural for him to not know much about medicinal ingredients. Zich omitted all other information about making the cure (he didn\u2019t know too well either) and only gave the information that Joachim needed to know.\u201cAll three of them are extremely expensive. The other ingredients are going to be pretty expensive too.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201dNo matter how severe the situation was, money was always an important factor to consider. There was also a huge number of patients, so if they didn\u2019t plan accordingly, they might not be able to prevent the epidemic even while knowing the cure.\u201cWill you be able to meet the budget?\u201d\u201cIf you give me a little bit more money, I can do it. The ingredients are expensive, but they are not very rare. It\u2019s the same for the other ingredients.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. Then please make a list of those three and the other ingredients. I\u2019ll prepare the money somehow, even if I have to take out all my money or force it out of my brother.\u201dJoachim was overly chatty right now; but seeing his sparkling eyes, he really looked like he would barge into the castle if he needed the money. Joachim commanded the soldiers outside to bring him a piece of paper and a writing tool.\u201cI will try my best to retrieve as many of the ingredients as possible. So, will you be able to tell the doctors how to make the cure\u2026?\u201d Then Joachim closed his mouth.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026I know it\u2019s strange for me to mention this now, but will it be all right? You found the cure for Igram. If you monopolize the cure and sell it, you\u2019d be able to make heaps of money.\u201dPatients weren\u2019t the only ones who\u2019d want the cure; kings, nobles, and other high officials would all desperately fight each other to claim it. But Zich shook his head.\u201cI don\u2019t have much interest in money. Moreover, I\u2019m trying to live a kind life. If people benefit from this cure, it\u2019ll be good for me as well.\u201dIf it also helped Joachim succeed as Count Dracul and bring out Fest, it would be even better.\u201c\u2026I said this before, but I will say it again.\u201d Joachim smiled brightly; his trembling eyes were filled with admiration for Zich. \u201cMeeting you was the most fortunate thing that have ever happened to me.\u201d* * *After Zich revealed the cure, many more patients began to recover. People who were moments away from death completely reversed their conditions, and the severity of overall symptoms dropped significantly. On the other hand, the situation was far from over. Time was needed to retrieve ingredients and make the cure, and since the epidemic was still going on, new cases were still appearing. However, the peak of the epidemic was over, and cases were going down.While making the cure with the doctors, a soldier told Zich that Joachim was calling for him. Zich followed the soldier to Joachim\u2019s headquarters.\u201cSir, I have brought Sir Zich here!\u201d\u201cBring him in!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go in, sir.\u201dEver since Zich revealed the cure to Igram, his authority reached the heavens. From then on, all the soldiers and even Joachim treated him with great respect.Zich opened the door and went in. Since he visited the headquarters many times, everything felt familiar to him. There was a large table and chair in the middle, busy maps on the wooden board, and a large pile of reports on the table; all of these items showed Zich that the epidemic was far from over.The scenery in front of him was familiar. But there was an unfamiliar person in the room; the person was someone Zich had never seen before. No, to be more precise, it was someone who he had never seen working directly in the field.\u2018He\u2019s the guy who used to be next to that fat bastard, Biyom.\u2019With great confidence, he was the old man who proclaimed to be Biyom\u2019s confidant. When the epidemic was at its peak, he was nowhere to be found, but now that the epidemic was waning, he had his chin high up as if he had been supporting them all along.\u201cWelcome in, Mr. Zich.\u201dNow, Joachim used \u2018Mr.\u2019 whenever he addressed Zich. But for some reason, there was a deep frown on his face. This was very strange. Since Zich found the cure, Joachim always looked at him with complete trust and gratefulness oozing out of his eyes.\u2018Is it because of that person?\u2019As Zich thought this, Biyom\u2019s confidant moved towards Zich.\u201cYou are Zich?\u201dThe man had a cold face, and his manners were rude.\u2018Wow,\u2019 Zich thought and scowled. \u2018What\u2019s up with this rude bastard?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although Zich had continued to meet people who approached him with bloodthirst and a sword, Shalom was the first one to pick a fight with Zich since he left Steelwall.\u2018Ah, actually there was Drew.\u2019\u201cI asked you if you were Zich!\u201dShalom pressed on Zich who was a bit dazed from the ridiculousness of the situation.\u2018\u2026Whatever my plan is, should I decide after killing this guy?\u2019For a moment, the current, pure (?) Zich thought of acting like his past Demon Lord days.\u201cWhat are you doing, Shalom!\u201dFortunately, Joachim intervened and prevented Zich from acting out on his anger.\u2018\u2026Yeah, I should bear it. Just for a bit. Joachim is here, and I don\u2019t have the power to take full responsibility for the consequences.\u2019Currently, he wasn\u2019t at Zich Moore\u2019s level and couldn\u2019t pull out his sword at every small annoyance and wreak havoc to his surroundings.\u2018Okay, calm down. I am pure. I have become clean.\u2019Zich calmed his heart; it was like trying to pour icy water onto a beating heart, engulfed by a fierce fire. While Zich calmed himself down and tried to pass this test of patience and self-control, a small argument went back and forth between Joachim and Shalom.\u201cI\u2019ve told you many times! Mr. Zich has helped us tremendously, so you can\u2019t treat him rudely! I\u2019m not going to say much about the way you treat me since that\u2019s our family\u2019s matter, but Mr. Zich has nothing to do with our family! What is this attitude you are showing him?!\u201d\u201cI want to ask you, Sir Joachim. How can you trust this man so much? Like you said, he has nothing to do with our family or this estate\u2014he\u2019s a stranger.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear that he found the cure for Igram?\u201d\u201cThat makes it even more suspicious. Isn\u2019t he just a traveler? How did he know about the cure for Igram? More so, didn\u2019t he appear at the perfect time when Ospurin was hit by an epidemic? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s too much of a coincidence, sir?\u201d\u201cThen, what? Are you saying that Mr. Zich was the one who spread the disease?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t go that far, but it\u2019s true that he is very suspicious.\u201d\u201cYou really are\u2026!\u201dJoachim bit his lips to repress his burning rage. However, Shalom didn\u2019t care for Joachim and stared\u2014no, glared back at Zich. It almost seemed like Shalom was trying to rip Zich apart with his eyes.\u201cAre you Zich?\u201d\u201cI think you already know. Why do you keep asking me?\u201dZich\u2019s gaze was haughty, and his tone was sarcastic. Shalom\u2019s eyebrows twitched.\u201cI am going to ask you one more time.\u201dShalom\u2019s body exuded an immense pressure; it was strong enough to cause Joachim to unconsciously take a step back.\u201cI asked you if you were Zich!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that Shalom didn\u2019t know Zich\u2019s name. This was a battle of nerves. Even if Shalom was aware of Zich\u2019s name, he was trying to make Zich answer his question; it was so that he could psychologically assert his dominance. However, Shalom couldn\u2019t have had a worse opponent than Zich.\u2018What the hell is this old fart doing?\u2019Shalom\u2019s actions were childish and the pressure he was exuding was ridiculous. He seemed like someone who could have been a leading figure in his prime, but his pressure was nothing to Zich who could control his mana however he wanted. Thus, Zich changed his posture. He twisted one of his feet crookedly and supported his back with only one hand. Then he tilted his head and spoke.\u201cI heard you, the first time. As I said before, don\u2019t you already know my name? Or are you losing your memories due to your old age? Did you forget my name in that short amount of time?\u201dShalom\u2019s eyes twitched.\u201c\u2026You bastard, you have no manners.\u201d\u201cIt depends on who I\u2019m talking to. I\u2019m the type of person who believes that courtesy is reciprocal and not one-sided.\u201dIn other words, since Shalom was rude to him, Zich also wouldn\u2019t be polite. Shalom\u2019s eyes grew menacing, and his cheeks shuddered like they were vibrating.\u201c\u2026Fine. I will acknowledge your spirit, courage, or whatever it is.\u201dSeeing that Zich wasn\u2019t about to back down, Shalom took a step back.\u201cBut you have to answer this question! Where did you get the cure to Igram?\u201d\u201cI saw it in a book before.\u201dSince Zich had expected this question to come up, he answered it easily. However, his answer was too simple and shabby, especially considering that he had prepared his answer beforehand. Naturally, Shalom didn\u2019t believe it either.\u201cA book? A book that contains information about the cure for Igram? How can you expect me to believe that?!\u201dIt was the first time this cure had ever been introduced to this world\u2014meaning that no one knew of its existence before then. Thus, it was simply unbelievable that the cure\u2019s formula had been inside a book all along. Even Joachim hadn\u2019t asked about the cure\u2019s origins in case it was a sensitive topic, and he looked at Zich with disbelief. If Joachim felt this way even though he had great faith in Zich, how much more would Shalom be unconvinced?However, Shalom continued the conversation with a smirk on his face.\u201cFine! Let\u2019s say that your ridiculous joke is true! Then what kind of book is that?!\u201d\u201cLet me think\u2026 I saw the book so long ago that I can\u2019t remember it well.\u201d\u201cAre you kidding me?!\u201d Shalom shouted.His voice was so loud that it probably hurt his throat, but Zich responded by tilting his chin a bit.\u201cAren\u2019t you the one joking? What do you want to hear? That I invented the medicine? Or that somebody told me the method to make it? If I say that, will it change anything?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat matters is that I created a cure for Igram, and people suffering from the disease became better. You can\u2019t accept that I found the formula of the cure through a book, so how would you be able to accept any other explanation? Moreover, is there a reason for me to convince you by explaining each step of my process in finding the cure?\u201d\u201cYou, you\u2026!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t grit your teeth. All it\u2019ll do is wear down your teeth. I can\u2019t prove my statement, and even if I could, I have no intention of convincing you by showing you evidence.\u201dBecause it didn\u2019t matter whether or not people believed his words, Zich hadn\u2019t prepared more than a shabby answer. More specifically, Zich knew that people wouldn\u2019t accept whatever explanation he gave them. The cure for Igram was the creation of a collaborative effort of priests, doctors, and apothecaries. Who would simply believe that a common traveler like Zich knew the cure\u2019s formula?Anyone would be suspicious. In truth, even Joachim doubted Zich.\u2018If I say that I created the formula, they will definitely doubt me since my knowledge in physiology or medicine doesn\u2019t go beyond an amateur level. And if I tell them a mysterious figure told me the formula, they will also not believe me. I mean, who would keep their identity a secret when they can get all kinds of wealth and honor for finding the cure?\u2019Zich didn\u2019t even want to try convincing someone who wouldn\u2019t be convinced no matter what.\u201cWhatever anyone says, I saw it in a book.\u201d\u2018Who cares if they don\u2019t believe me or not. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m lying.\u2019Zich saw the formula from a book that Joachim was reading before his regression, so he wasn\u2019t even lying. Shalom\u2019s face turned purple in rage like he wanted to kill Zich. However, Shalom repressed his emotions.\u201cFine. Then, did that book have cures for other infectious diseases?\u201d\u201cNo, all I saw in that book was the cure for Igram.\u201d\u2018And this is also not a lie.\u2019Zich knew the cure for other infectious diseases, but he had seen their formulas in other books. The book which talked about Igram\u2019s cure only contained information about Igram.\u201c\u2026Are you telling the truth?\u201d\u201cCome on, have you been tricked all your life?\u201dShalom closely inspected Zich\u2019s face, but Zich didn\u2019t feel pressured by him. Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t like he was lying, so Zich was confident in his words.\u201c\u2026Fine.\u201dWith those words, Shalom disappeared without a farewell. Shalom\u2019s actions were also incredibly rude to Joachim, who Shalom was supposed to serve, but Joachim seemed to be used to it.\u201cI apologize, Mr. Zich. A person from our family has caused you discomfort.\u201dInstead of feeling upset by Shalom\u2019s attitude towards him, Joachim apologetically bowed his head at Zich.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me. But who is that man? I think I\u2019ve seen him next to your older brother before.\u201d\u201cHis name is Bessnol Shalom. He is our family\u2019s butler.\u201d\u201cHe seems to have a lot of spirit for a butler.\u201d\u201cShalom used to be our family knight. He used to be a skillful captain of our family\u2019s Order of Knights. However, he had to retire because of a leg injury, and my father took Shalom in as our butler for his service.\u201dZich remembered how Shalom lightly limped; that was probably the aftereffects of Shalom\u2019s leg injury.\u201cWhy is a person like that fussing over me?\u201d\u201cHe probably thought that I\u2019ll gain greater authority if I successfully cure Igram in Ospurin. So, he probably came to pressure us while trying to grasp the current situation. You see, he is completely on my brother\u2019s side,\u201d Joachim said bitterly.If Igram wasn\u2019t simply controlled but cured, people\u2019s interests would naturally lean towards Joachim, and that would be an eyesore to the forces supporting Biyom.\u2018But how could he show that kind of attitude to someone who stopped an epidemic that could\u2019ve swept across the entire city of Ospurin?\u2019No matter how much Joachim tried to understand Shalom\u2019s behavior, he couldn\u2019t. Even Joachim didn\u2019t trust Zich about everything; he was especially curious about the cure\u2019s origins. However, Zich was Ospurin\u2019s savior, so Joachim looked at Zich favorably and couldn\u2019t understand Shalom\u2019s rude attitude.But he also had a similar thought as Shalom about one matter.\u201cDo you really not know the cures for other infectious diseases?\u201d Joachim asked while knowing that his question might be offensive to Zich. He wasn\u2019t just asking for himself. If Zich knew the cures for other diseases, many more people could be saved. However, Zich shook his head.\u201cThat book really only had the formula to Igram\u2019s cure.\u201dZich lied with a clever twist of his words.\u2018If I tell him that I know the cure to other infectious diseases right now, it will become really bothersome.\u2019Of course, since giving cures to diseases was also a kind act, Zich didn\u2019t intend to keep the information to himself.\u2018I will tell Lubella some later.\u2019Karuwiman could spread cures and medicines to places more efficiently than any other organization. Furthermore, since they owed him a favor, they would cover up his identity thoroughly. Zich didn\u2019t intend to refuse fame if it was given to him, but he wasn\u2019t so hungry for fame that he wanted it through cures that he didn\u2019t create. He knew that the fame that he didn\u2019t get by his own efforts would bring all kinds of baggage and nuisances.\u201cThat\u2019s a pity, but I\u2019m probably also being too greedy. It\u2019s already a miracle that a cure for Igram was found.\u201dJoachim respected Zich\u2019s privacy.\u201cIs that all you wanted to ask?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s because Shalom insisted on talking to you. I\u2019m so sorry for bothering you when you are busy making the cure. Feel free to leave now.\u201d\u201cThat person named Shalom. How skilled is he?\u201dJoachim answered Zich\u2019s question without much thought.\u201cHis abilities as a knight were greatly affected by his injury, but I heard that he is still a skilled fighter. His ability as a butler is also top-class. Since he has a good head on his shoulders, he handles our family\u2019s matters well.\u201d\u201cIf his head is good, he must also be good at trickery.\u201dPerhaps, Zich had a grudge to settle. Joachim repressed his desire to sigh and nodded his head.\u201cYes, that is true.\u201d\u201cThank you for answering. Then I will leave now. I still have a lot of medicine to make.\u201d\u201cI apologize again for this incident. I know I am shameless for asking you this, but please do all you can for the sick.\u201dJoachim sent Zich off while bowing his head deeply, and Zich began to head back to the path he came from. While walking, Zich thought of Shalom again. He was a rude, old man\u2014yet, what was more important to Zich was not the old man\u2019s image.\u2018Could he be Fest?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Joachim said it was because Shalom was trying to keep them in check, but Zich knew about the existence of assassins and Fest, so he had a different perspective.\u2018Joachim is not wrong.\u2019As a supporter of Biyom, Shalom wouldn\u2019t have liked Joachim gaining credit for stopping the spread of infectious diseases. Likewise, this also would have made him dislike Zich.\u2018But Joachim said he was highly competent and had a good head on his shoulders.\u2019He used to be a knight before, but he was not the brawny type.\u2018Then why did he leave without scolding me?\u2019Zich didn\u2019t outrightly tell people he was a noble; Joachim was also not the type of person to go around telling other people\u2019s secrets. However, Shalom didn\u2019t use his nobility to criticize Zich for his rude behaviors as a commoner.In his interaction with Shalom, Zich displayed his awful personality; but surprisingly, he was precisely calculating his rude behavior.\u2018Judging by that old man\u2019s personality, I don\u2019t think he will easily look over a commoner\u2019s rude words just because he thinks they are right.\u2019Zich had several possible theories. First, since Joachim was next to them and supported Zich, Shalom could have a hard time blatantly disregarding him. Zich was also the person who found the cure, so he received a lot of admiration and respect from the people around him. Honestly, Zich had utilized both of these factors to act even more rudely toward the old man.\u2018But my behavior was not proper. If he was as competent as Joachim said, he should have used my commoner status and his nobility to his advantage.\u2019Shalom could have used his nobility status to bring Zich down and then connect it with Joachim to also tarnish Joachim\u2019s reputation. But Shalom didn\u2019t do that. He only focused on whether or not Zich knew the cure for other diseases and where Zich got his information from.\u2018There are only two possibilities now. First, Shalom thinks that I am not competent enough to meet his standards. Or second, he is so uninterested in these types of affairs that he didn\u2019t even think about using my behavior to his advantage.\u2019If it was the latter, another question appeared in his mind.\u2018This bastard, is he really working for Biyom?\u2019Nothing was clear. But one thing Zich was sure about was that Shalom was a very suspicious person.\u2018Okay, good. So I have one suspect so far.\u2019Shalom could be Fest, or part of the assassin group, or have an entirely different plan. But Zich was satisfied to note down one suspect.While thinking about various topics, Zich reached his destination before he realized it. If he turned around just once, he would be right in front of the building that manufactured the cure. He had taught all the apothecaries how to make the cure, but they weren\u2019t used to making it yet so they still needed Zich\u2019s help. Zich quickly sped up his steps.\u2018What?\u2019Zich halted after entering the manufacturing center. Inside the building, there were the same apothecaries and one unfamiliar person.\u201cAh, he\u2019s here.\u201d One of the apothecaries gestured towards Zich. \u201cThat person is Mr. Zich. He is the person who gave us the cure for Igram.\u201dThe unfamiliar person got up from the chair.She was a woman. The first thing that popped up in Zich\u2019s mind to describe her was the word, \u2018black.\u2019 Zich wasn\u2019t talking about her personality, but the way she dressed. She wore a black hat, a black veil that covered her whole face, a black dress, black gloves, and even black shoes. It was as if she was wearing funeral clothes.\u2018Wait, it\u2019s not \u2018as if.\u2019. I think she really is wearing funeral clothes?\u2019The woman walked towards Zich. Her controlled and careful steps gave off an aura of elegance.Click, clack!The sound of her heels stopped. She stood right in front of Zich. He could see her face through the veil; she looked like she was in her mid-twenties, and she was a beautiful, elegant woman.\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Greta Bargot.\u201dShe gracefully bowed her head. Zich followed her movements.\u201cI\u2019m Zich.\u201dShe looked at Zich all over. Her face was full of curiosity, and her face looked as if she was thinking, \u2018Is this the person who found the cure\u2026!\u2019Before Zich could ask who she was, the apothecary introduced her.\u201cThis is Ms. Bargot. She is the owner of the Bargot Business.\u201d\u2018Bargot Business?\u2019Zich had heard of it before, but it was not the same name that he was familiar with.\u201cAre you talking about the Bargot Trading House?\u201dThe Bargot Trading House. When Zich was young and pushed around by everyone at Steelwall, the Bargot Trading House was renowned all around the world. As a trading house based in the Dracul estate, its fame spread all the way to Steelwall, a location at the edge of a neighboring country.However, Zich had never interacted with them.\u201cIt\u2019s called a business now, not a trading house. The trading house collapsed after my husband\u2019s passing.\u201dMs. Bargot explained this while making a bitter smile; Zich now knew why he had never interacted with the Bargot Trading House. When Zich left his family and began his journey for the first time, the Bargot Trading House had already collapsed and was disappearing quickly into the back alleyway of history books.\u2018From what I remember, after the owner of the trading house died, it was ripped into many parts.\u2019After connecting Ms. Bargot\u2019s words and his knowledge, Zich could figure out that the past owner of the trading house was Ms. Bargot\u2019s husband.\u2018I thought the trading house completely disappeared. I can\u2019t believe it still exists.\u2019However, the Bargot Business seemed as if it was greatly scaled-down, so it no longer had any international influence or presence. If so, it was understandable why Zich thought the business had completely collapsed.\u2018But judging by what I know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s far-fetched to say that they collapsed.\u2019\u201cPlease excuse my rudeness.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. It\u2019s true anyways.\u201d\u201cMay I ask why you came to see me? Moreover, how were you able to find this place?\u201dEven though several patients were getting treated here, the manufacturing center was barricaded and blocked from other people. A simple business owner would not be able to come here.\u201cMr. Zich, I will explain that.\u201d The same apothecary intervened again. \u201cMs. Bargot has tremendous interest in infectious diseases. She invests a lot in disease research and has a lot of medical knowledge. She also does a lot of personal research as well. Honestly speaking, it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that she knows a lot more about infectious diseases than all of us.\u201d\u201cNo, you praise me too much.\u201d With humility, Ms. Bargot waved her hand. But judging by the apothecary\u2019s eyes, it seemed as if he was not exaggerating. For a second, Zich thought maybe the apothecary had some kind of crush on the young and beautiful widow, but his eyes were too clear. The apothecary was looking at Ms. Bargot with pure admiration.\u201cSince Ms. Bargot has so much interest in infectious diseases, she wanted to meet the person who found the Igram cure. Ah, we were the ones who let her come here. To be more precise, it was another team member of ours. With her knowledge, I\u2019m sure that she will be a lot of help to us.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Zich stared back at Ms. Bargot. At his obvious stare, she stiffened a little bit. \u201cThat\u2019s impressive. You look really young, but you are so highly praised by everyone here.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. The small business I have now goes along well by itself, even without my intervention, so I wanted to focus on things I\u2019m personally interested in.\u201d She made a very bitter smile. \u201cMy husband and child both died from infectious diseases. Through my efforts, I want to prevent at least one person from going through what I went through.\u201dIt was a noble cause. But rather than a noble cause, her next few words revealed how miserable her life was.\u201cIf not for that, I would have no reason to live anymore.\u201d* * *Ms. Bargot wanted to continue her conversation with Zich. From the rumors, Zich was a mysterious traveler who found the cure for the infamous Igram disease and was sharing it around to everyone with great generosity. She wanted to approach him after hearing these fantastical rumors about Zich and was expecting a mysterious person with extensive medical knowledge. But Zich could only show his real self.\u201cDid you really happen to find the cure in a book?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s true.\u201dHer disappointment was obvious. For people to not misunderstand the extent of his medical knowledge, Zich told people he found the cure in a book\u2014but the nature of rumors was to exaggerate things to the extremes. The rumors that were spreading about Zich were reaching the point where people were saying that he was an incarnation of a legendary medical guru.\u201cYour knowledge about diseases\u2026\u201d\u201cI know a bit of the basics, but nothing at the professional level.\u201d\u201cDo you know about Kimusu? Mihil and Lastone?\u201d\u201cFor Kimusu, are you talking about plants that stretch their roots inside the ground? It helps lower fevers. I don\u2019t know about Mihil and Lastone.\u201dMs. Bargot asked a few more questions, and Zich replied back faithfully.\u201c\u2026You really know as much as an amateur.\u201d\u201cMs. Bargot, that\u2019s what I told you.\u201dZich could clearly see how disappointed she was, but he was firm about his stance. He didn\u2019t lie or exaggerate the amount of medical knowledge he knew. He couldn\u2019t do anything about the rumors that spread about him. But he was not in the wrong.\u2018It\u2019s a really good thing I said I found the cure in a book.\u2019 If Zich had lied and said he made the cure by himself, his lie would have been caught right away.\u201c\u2026I apologize. I was only thinking about myself.\u201d Realizing that she showed her disappointment too outrightly, Ms. Bargot lowered her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s because I had such high expectations while coming here. Even though we won\u2019t be able to fully cure all the infectious diseases, with your help, we\u2019ll be able to put up a strong fight against Igram.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be so disappointed since the cure for Igram was found.\u201dAs if she was trying to infuse positivity into her body, she stretched out her arms and then placed one hand towards Zich.\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to do all I can to fix this situation. Since your face and name are well-known, please accompany me and help me around.\u201d\u201cIf you are trying to gain credibility, wouldn\u2019t Sir Joachim be a much better choice?\u201d\u201cSir Joachim is the second son of Count Dracul. It\u2019s too hard to be around him. Compared to him, I feel much more comfortable with you, and you also have basic medical knowledge and admiration from the public. A person like you\u2014you won\u2019t refuse a request from a frail lady like me, right?\u201dZich smirked. He grabbed her outstretched hands and made a small wink.\u201cOf course I will help, my lady.\u201d* * *Even though the medical staff greatly recommended her, Zich was able to personally confirm some of Ms. Bargot\u2019s medical knowledge. He hadn\u2019t fully trusted her professional expertise, and Zich was shocked by the extent of her medical knowledge.\u201cThe spread of Igram usually occurs between people using the same water source. You should investigate the well or other water sources that the patients use and block off that water source. You also have to barricade the areas that use the same water source.\u201dThe first thing Ms. Bargot did: was to expand the quarantine area and categorize the people who were in there as observational studies for workers to send constant reports of them.\u201cThis disease spreads from person to person, but it doesn\u2019t spread just by being next to an infected person. It spreads by physical contact and by the exchange of fluids such as saliva. You should be careful about patients\u2019 coughs and sneezes and make sure to avoid patients\u2019 bodily fluids at all costs. Of course, you should also minimize all physical contact with patients.\u201d She delivered specific infection routes to prevent person-to-person infection. \u201cAll the medical staff and anyone who makes contact with the patients must be clean at all costs. Please prepare clean water, and every time a person makes contact with a patient, they must wash their hands. At the minimum, also wash your whole body at least once every day.\u201dMs. Bargot also thoroughly managed the caretakers and medical staff to make sure they didn\u2019t become carriers of the disease.\u201cAfter looking over the ingredients needed for the cure, there are some foods that might lower the cure\u2019s effectiveness. I will give you a list, so please exclude them from the patients\u2019 food. And I will also give a list of foods that will increase the effectiveness of the cure. Please give these foods to the patients at least once a day.\u201dWith a glance, Ms. Bargot was able to analyze and figure out all the ingredients needed in the Igram cure. And her medical knowledge even went as far as knowing which foods increased or lowered the effectiveness of the cure. The strategies and information she knew were things Zich knew a little bit about while traveling in the future, so he was amazed that her knowledge was so ahead of the times. It also helped him accept her words more easily.Moreover, she was highly regarded by the medical staff; so, the staff readily accepted her suggestions and quickly implemented her policies. However, her policies were not implemented in all the treatment areas from the start; like Zich\u2019s clinical trials, they decided on a specific area to test out her policies. But soon after, her policies worked so well that they decided to apply her policies to all the areas.Joachim, who doubted Ms. Bargot\u2019s methods and policies in the beginning, smiled brightly whenever he saw her now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 69": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEver since Ms. Bargot joined the task force, Ms. Bargot and Zich always hung out together. Even though Zich didn\u2019t have much medical knowledge, Ms. Bargot seemed to be fond of Zich for sharing the formula to Igram\u2019s cure, so she shared little bits of medical knowledge with him. It looked like she was one-sidedly dragging him to places, but Zich also followed her without any complaints and listened to what she said.And because of that, rumors about the two began to spread. Zich was a handsome youth from a noble lineage, and Ms. Bargot was also a beauty. When such noticeable people hung out together, rumors began to naturally spread. There was a significant age difference between them, but that fact only made their relationship sound more romantic.Nosy people began to gossip and make conclusions about the two. Both of their efforts to quickly calm the Igram situation also played a significant part in improving their image. Although gossip usually led to tarnishing one or both parties\u2019 reputation, hardly anyone talked badly about their relationship.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dAs Zich was getting ready to make his final blow on Igram\u2019s gradually dying existence, he noticed Hans staring at him and Hans asked, \u201cAre the rumors true, sir?\u201d\u201cWhat rumors?\u201d\u201cYou know, the rumors that you and Ms. Bargot are a couple.\u201d Hans didn\u2019t ask just out of curiosity. He also didn\u2019t have the smallest intention to intervene in Zich\u2019s love life. He had simply asked because he still had some of his habits from his servant days.\u2018If the rumors are true, then I will have to treat Ms. Bargot differently from other people.\u201dHans had a different mindset than Snoc who was listening with his ears perked up, excited to hear a heart-thumping story of fated love. Zich smirked like he knew Hans\u2019 motive for asking such a question.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to treat her differently from before. And in the first place, our relationship is not that sweet.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Hans nodded. If Zich said that was the case, he had no reason to ask further questions. After hearing Zich\u2019s response, Hans grabbed a disappointed Snoc by the back of his neck and got ready to prepare for the day.Knock! Knock!Someone suddenly knocked on the temporary shelter that Zich and his companions were staying at. Hans and Snoc\u2019s expression stiffened. Most of the people who visited their shelter were soldiers who came to get Zich under Joachim\u2019s orders. And most of the time, they didn\u2019t bring good news. They wondered if Igram that was beginning to disappear was starting up a second wave. However, Zich\u2019s words made their worries disappear.\u201cIt\u2019s not a soldier, so don\u2019t worry. They probably came to talk to me about something.\u201d Then Zich personally moved to open the door. Usually, Hans or Snoc opened the door when guests came, so his action was most unusual. But when they saw who was standing outside the door, they understood. They knew who she was by her all-black clothes and the cotton veil covering her face.\u201cGreetings, Mr. Zich. Did you sleep well?\u201d\u201cThanks to you, I was knocked out.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief to hear. Sleep is one of the most important factors to good health.\u201d Ms. Bargot smiled widely.\u201cI am honored to have the fortune of seeing your beautiful face so early in the morning, but to what do I owe this pleasure to?\u201d\u201cFufu! You are so skillful with your words. If I didn\u2019t still love my husband, I would have fallen for you.\u201d Ms. Bargot covered her mouth with her hands and smiled lovingly. Hans and Snoc stole furtive glances at her; she was beautiful enough to make their minds go blank. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to intrude, but there\u2019s someone I\u2019d like you to meet. Ah, I have gotten permission from Sir Joachim of course. Since Igram is slowing down, he told me it\u2019s fine for me to leave for a bit.\u201d\u201cSomeone you want me to meet? It\u2019s a pity that it\u2019s not an offer to go on a date. But since you are the one doing the introduction, it\u2019s more than enough for me to make time. I will get ready immediately.\u201d Zich went back inside the house and finished getting ready.\u201cShould we leave now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dZich offered his arm, and Ms. Bargot placed her hand on his arm. Then he escorted her to the road. Anyone would have thought that there was something going on between them. Hans and Snoc watched the two leave sticking side by side and thought the same thing.\u2018How can he act like that and still say that they\u2019re not in a relationship?\u2019* * *Ms. Bargot led Zich outside of Ospurin. Fortunately, there was another gate near the quarantine area (used for moving corpses outside of the castle to burn them), so they didn\u2019t have to walk through people unexposed to the disease.The outside was quiet without a sign of life. The area that was connected to the gate was also blocked from outsiders. Besides a couple of trees that waved under light breezes, the place was a meadow, colored with green grass. However, the slates on the ground indicated that the place wasn\u2019t only for resting. It was a cemetery.Zich glanced around the cemetery; they all had different names but the same family name: Bargot.\u2018It must be the Bargot family\u2019s cemetery.\u2019The cemetery was well maintained even after the family\u2019s collapse. It proved that somebody was taking care of the place.\u2018Ms. Bargot must be the one taking care of it.\u2019Zich glanced at her. Ms. Bargot moved and stopped in front of the two slates at the end of the cemetery.\u2014Alex Bargot\u2014\u2014Luin Bargot\u2014Even without asking, Zich knew who they were. Besides Ms. Bargot, he looked down at the graves below him.\u2018Are they her family members who died from the epidemic?\u2019\u201cThey are my family,\u201d Ms. Bargot finally said. Her voice was calm, almost as if time lessened the affection she felt for her family. However, that wasn\u2019t it. Time had simply changed a person\u2019s sorrows into longing, and she couldn\u2019t erase the love she had for them in her heart. Ms. Bargot placed her hand on top of the stone slab which had the name Alex Bargot written on it.\u201cThis is my husband.\u201dShe quietly began her explanation.\u201cHe was much older than me, but we truly loved each other. Even while my husband was busy with his business, he was always attentive to me. I loved my husband for that. So when our love bore fruit, I felt like I had the whole world in my hands.\u201dMs. Bargot moved her hands to the slab which said \u2018Luin Bargot.\u2019\u201cShe was such a lovely child. Always smiling, crying, and sleeping a lot. Every time Luin squirmed inside my grasp; I thought my heart would drop from her cuteness. I didn\u2019t know until I had a child of my own and realized what a child meant to their mother. Luin was a child who made me realize why mothers care for their children so much.\u201dAs if time hadn\u2019t fully healed her sadness, her eyes soon watered, and a teardrop slid down her cheek. Then she took out a handkerchief and wiped her tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t help it whenever I come to this place.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cThe people I wanted to introduce to you are my family.\u201d She stood in the center of the two slates and placed her hands on both of them at once. It almost seemed like she was holding her husband and child\u2019s hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you obtained the cure to Igram, but thanks to that, I saw hope. Hope that we can beat all the infectious diseases. Did you notice that I\u2019m wearing mourning clothes?\u201d\u201cI was aware of it.\u201d\u201cI swore at my family\u2019s funeral that I would take these clothes off once we overcame all the diseases.\u201dIt was basically an impossible goal, but who could laugh at her?\u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to show you my husband and child. I wanted to show them that thanks to you, we were able to accomplish a bit of our goal. I wanted to tell them that at the very least, no one would meet the same fate as them from Igram,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cNow that I think about it again, this might be very selfish of me.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not true. You have done so much. No one would find fault in you for this.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d She smiled. As a mother and wife, she shone blindingly. \u201cLet\u2019s go back now.\u201dAs if she was trying to forcefully brighten up the gloomy mood, she increased the pitch of her voice and stated, \u201cIgram hasn\u2019t completely disappeared yet. Let\u2019s go and cut off its last breath.\u201d Ms. Bargot held Zich\u2019s hands, and the warmth of her soft hands slowly spread to his fingertips.* * *After returning to his temporary shelter, Zich lay on his bed. Hans and Snoc had looked at Zich with curiosity when he first returned with his arms crossed with Ms. Bargot, but after Zich slammed each of their heads down with a disciplinary punch, they turned their eyes away. But those punches probably didn\u2019t make them change their minds.\u2018Hmm, lovers.\u2019Zich knew what Hans and Snoc were obviously thinking.\u2018I guess that\u2019s what it looks like to outsiders.\u2019Because Zich didn\u2019t care about what other people thought, he didn\u2019t realize how other people might have looked at him and Ms. Bargot. Yet, to the point that it might shock and exasperate them, Zich didn\u2019t possess even an inkling of romantic feelings for Ms. Bargot.Of course, it was true that since her first appearance, Zich\u2019s gaze continued to search for Ms. Bargot, and he tried to gain her favor. However, the reason for that wasn\u2019t something as sweet as romance but for something much more sinister.\u2018There\u2019s a chance that she could be Fest.\u2019With the introduction of the cure to Igram, Ms. Bargot suddenly appeared and expressed her interest in Zich. She was extremely knowledgeable about infectious diseases and spouted words that Zich knew he had heard of in the future. Truthfully, she was the most likely candidate to be Fest among everyone he had met so far. Thus, Zich didn\u2019t reject the interest she showed him and he instead welcomed it to observe her more closely.However, he didn\u2019t obtain much information so far. All he found was that she possessed a vast amount of knowledge and interest in infectious diseases, and that was it. Overall, she didn\u2019t seem like a Demon Person.\u2018I should observe her for a bit longer and then distance myself.\u2019This didn\u2019t mean that Zich had gotten rid of his suspicions about her. He simply judged that he wouldn\u2019t be able to find out more useful information by staying next to her.Zich thought of the two suspicious figures: Dracul\u2019s previous knight and current butler, Shalom, and Ms. Bargot who lost her whole family in an epidemic\u2014and then fell asleep.* * *A couple of days passed by. After a few more days, Igram seemed to have completely lost its power. It could no longer bring fear to people\u2019s faces. During the previous day, even the lockdown and quarantine policies had been lifted.They had won against the disease. People thought that Igram would soon be done for good. However, the task force, including Joachim, didn\u2019t let their guard down. They would only be able to fully relax after catching and beating all the diseases spreading around the region. Zich thought the same and headed to his temporary shelter again. As usual, he cared for the sick and made the cure.Then, suddenly, someone called out, \u201cZich!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZich knew who he was.\u201cAren\u2019t you Sir Clovey?\u201d Like Brod, Clovey was one of Joachim\u2019s subordinates. Since he was one of the people who worked alongside Zich at the peak of the epidemic, Zich spoke nicely to him. \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d\u201cThe situation doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d Clovey\u2019s face hardened. \u201cI think new cases of Igram are appearing again.\u201d\u201cYou mean, in the containment area?\u201d Zich could not help but make an annoyed face. Even with Ms. Bargot\u2019s advanced preventive measures and Zich\u2019s cure from the future, Igram cases were rising again; it was more annoying because they had been making significant progress. But Clovey shook his head.\u201cFortun\u2014I mean, I don\u2019t know if this is fortunate or not, but it\u2019s not in Ospurin. A disease with similar symptoms like Igram has been spreading around a village between Ospurin and Dobo.\u201dFirst of all, Zich was glad cases were not rising in Ospurin. However, it was bothersome that diseases were spreading near Ospurin. So far, all the infectious diseases apart from Igram in the Dracul estate were all rare and had particularly violent symptoms.\u201cIs that disease really Igram?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Igram, or some other kind of disease, or if many people are just suffering from body pains at the same time. But since people near Ospurin are getting sick, Sir Joachim wanted someone to investigate whether the cases are connected to Igram.\u201d\u201cAnd you are asking me to go investigate.\u201d\u201cSir Joachim feels very sorry about that. But the only one who has basic medical knowledge about infectious diseases and who has high enough mana to not get infected is you.\u201d Clovey said this with confidence, but he glanced at Zich with uncertainty. Zich was not one of Joachim\u2019s subordinates\u2014no, he was not related to the Dracul estate at all in the first place. For that reason, Clovey was nervous whenever he made requests to Zich, especially considering that Zich had already helped them out so much.\u201cI understand. I can go.\u201d\u201cAh, thank you so much!\u201d Clovey\u2019s face brightened while looking at Zich, as if Zich was his savior.\u201cShould I go right now?\u201d\u201cYes. Since investigating new cases is the top priority right now, Sir Joachim told me you didn\u2019t have to go check with him and leave as soon as possible. I already prepared your method of transportation.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d Zich turned back. Hans and Snoc were awkwardly standing in the back while listening to their conversation. \u201cYou heard everything, right?\u201d\u201cAre we following you?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dWithout any complaints, Hans and Snoc nodded. Clovey also didn\u2019t stop them from following Zich.\u201cLet\u2019s quickly go. I prepared the carriage right in front, so you don\u2019t have to walk far.\u201d* * *The village they reached was small. But no matter how small the village was, there should have been some signs of human presence. However, no signs of human presence could be found anywhere.\u201cIt feels ominous,\u201d Snoc said while hugging Nowem. Hans also felt the same way, so he nodded silently. The carriage entered the village, but they found that the village was completely empty.\u201cWe have arrived!\u201dClovey took the position as the carriage driver, and shouted out loud. Zich, Snoc, and Hans moved out of the carriage. Hans and Snoc looked around and didn\u2019t know what to do as the village looked basically like a ghost town.\u201cIt\u2019s over there.\u201dZich pointed at a building in the village. The building looked like a temple for the village\u2019s religious rites. Since the village was small, the temple was also small; in a tiny building, there was one simple statue of a god in it. But still, the temple was bigger than all the other houses.\u201cYeah. When there are infectious diseases, it\u2019s usually the temples that take care of the sick.\u201dClovey also agreed with Zich\u2019s assessment. \u201cThe situation is more serious than I thought. The only place where I can detect human presence is in that temple over there.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that the entire village got infected?\u201d\u201cMaybe. Let\u2019s first find out more.\u201dZich and his companions walked towards the temple. While they were walking there, they were able to see many houses with completely open doors. Through the doors, they saw that the inside of the houses was messy\u2014it looked as if people were in a hurry to leave.When Zich reached the temple, he flung the door open.\u201cAs expected.\u201dThe temple was full of people on the ground. Dozens of people were crammed into one bed, and there were also many people on the ground with nothing below them. It was a familiar sight. Hans and Snoc who were behind Zich scrunched up their faces. Fortunately, not everyone in the village seemed to have fallen ill as there were a few people taking care of the patients.A young caretaker closest to the entrance asked Zich and his companions, \u201cWho are you people?\u201d His complexion didn\u2019t seem too great either. It seemed as if the patients who had less severe symptoms were the ones taking care of the severely ill patients.\u201cI think that everyone here has been infected.\u201dSnoc quietly told Hans his observation. Then Clovey stepped forward and said, \u201cWe are from Ospurin! We heard that infectious diseases are spreading here, and we have come to investigate!\u201d\u201cThank goodness, you are knights!\u201dThe young caretaker\u2019s face brightened up. As if welcoming a savior, the young caretaker reached out his hands towards Clovey and tried to approach him.\u201cWe have to first figure out what happened here. So please give us an explanation\u2014!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Zich blocked Clovey from saying more.\u201cHmm? What are you saying is fine?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t need an explanation. I\u2019ve finished analyzing the situation.\u201d\u201cWhat? The epidemic has spread to this place. Shouldn\u2019t we at least get an explanation?\u201dThe young man glanced at Zich and asked, \u201cUm\u2026who is this person\u2026?\u201d\u201cHe is someone who came to check how far the disease has spread. Please tell him what\u2019s been happening without skipping any details.\u201d\u201cOh, you are a doctor! Of course, we will cooperate for the village. I will tell you all the details!\u201dZich wasn\u2019t a doctor, but Clovey didn\u2019t seem to feel the need to clear the matter up and maintained his silence.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a long story, but I don\u2019t think this is a good place to talk. There\u2019s a room over there. It\u2019s a bit shabby, but if you don\u2019t mind, I will tell you about it there.\u201dThe young man looked over the area where patients were lying around and pointed at a door. Clovey nodded.\u201cI think we should do as the man says. What do you think\u2026?\u201d Clovey asked Zich for his opinion, but he trailed off because Zich was staring at him intensely. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201cI was curious.\u201d\u201cCurious about what? No, but before that, shouldn\u2019t we listen to what this man has to say first? We don\u2019t have much time. We can deal with personal matters later\u2014\u201d\u201cI am curious if\u2026\u201d Zich cut off Clovey\u2019s words and smirked, \u201c\u2026You are acting on your own will or if you\u2019ve been blackmailed.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2014\u201dClang!With that sharp sound, Clovey\u2019s words were cut short again. Ignoring the stunned group of people in his surroundings, Zich moved his unsheathed sword. He aimed at the young man who they just conversed with. Zich\u2019s sword moved as if it was about to rip the young man\u2019s head off.The young man looked at Zich\u2019s sword in shock. But when he felt the sword\u2019s bloodthirst and realized that Zich was not going to stop until he cut his head off, the man\u2019s face changed.Kagagak!The young man took out a dagger and blocked Zich\u2019s sword. The speed of Zich\u2019s sword slowed down.Crack!Zich\u2019s sword sliced the dagger and dashed forward. The young man\u2019s chilly expression turned to shock.Slice!Zich sliced the young man\u2019s head off and moved past him. Everyone in his surroundings didn\u2019t move as if time was frozen, and Zich flicked the blood off his sword with an exaggerated swing. Then he raised his chin and looked around the temple. Everyone, whether they were caretakers or patients, looked at him.\u201cQuit your theatrics and bring it on. I\u2019m not na\u00efve enough to fall for such a sloppy trap like this one.\u201d Zich smirked again. \u201cYour trap was so childish that I couldn\u2019t bear to look at it any longer. You should have paid a bit more attention to the details.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d Snoc didn\u2019t understand the situation yet, but he exchanged glances with Hans and pulled out his sword.\u201cBe careful! They are enemies!\u201dHans gave Snoc a warning when\u2014Bam!Daggers flew in their direction. Zich flung them away with his sword like they were flies. However, he couldn\u2019t treat the sword coming from his side in the same way.Claaang!A sword soaked in mana lashed at him, and Clovey glared at Zich with a demon-like face.\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question yet. Are you acting on your own will or were you blackmailed?\u201d\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cAnswering a question with a question is a very bad habit. Not to mention that I asked the same question twice.\u201d Zich failed to get an answer again, and Clovey gritted his teeth. The bloodlust flowing in Clovey\u2019s body seemed like it would take shape any moment.\u201cKill them!\u201dAt his command, people who were pretending to be caretakers and patients got up from their beds and dashed towards Zich, Hans, and Snoc. On the other hand, not everyone got up; a lot of people stayed crouched on the ground and screamed.Clovey shouted, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, move! I will personally kill everyone on the ground!\u201d The rest of the people got up at Clovey\u2019s words. However, their fearful eyes and hesitant body movements indicated that they were ordinary people who were scared.\u2018They must be the villagers.\u2019 They were probably threatened by Clovey and his allies. \u2018They won\u2019t even put up a fight. Guess I\u2019ll just ignore them for now.\u2019However, as they began running towards Zich and his company, Zich had to change his mind. This was because the villagers\u2019 movements and speed were quite formidable. Of course, it didn\u2019t mean that they were threatening opponents, but Zich couldn\u2019t simply ignore them.\u201cYou guys work together to fight.\u201dHans and Snoc hastily turned their backs towards each other at Zich\u2019s command. Among Zich\u2019s training lessons, there was a method to fight against an opponent or a group through teamwork. Of course, it was too early for the two to move as one body, but because of Zich\u2019s training, they were able to display an impressive level of cooperative fighting. After checking their formation, Zich focused his attention on the enemy again.\u2018Let\u2019s see. Who prepared this trap: Fest or the assassins? Or even Biyom Dracul?\u2019Zich listed all the people who wanted him dead. Ever since Zich revealed the cure and raised Joachim\u2019s reputation, he could confidently put Biyom on the list of people who wanted him dead.\u2018It\u2019s probably from Fest or the assassins.\u2019It looked like a trap, but it was also true that the village was infected. The person or organization probably planned it like this to make the trap look more realistic. Judging by the involvement of diseases, Fest seemed like the most likely candidate for this trap, but the movement of his opponents confused him.All of Zich\u2019s opponents had the same movements as the assassins he met before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No, it seemed very likely that they were collaborating together.\u2018Since the assassin group\u2019s focus is to make Demon People, Fest could be one of their creations.\u2019This was good for Zich either way. The reason why Zich had come to this village while thinking it might be a trap was because he wanted to meet the assassin group again.\u2018Just finding out that Fest and the organization are working together is already a good harvest for me.\u2019Of course, Zich was not satisfied with just finding out this information. If he could, he wanted to get as much information as possible. However, it would be very difficult for Zich to find any more information about them considering that they were so inclined to self-destruct. But Zich was not fazed.\u2018I have to be patient when dealing with guys like this. I need to slowly gather information bit by bit and find the perfect timing.\u2019That was the extent of Zich\u2019s thoughts. He didn\u2019t need to think any further; moreover, Clovey\u2019s attacks put a stop to Zich\u2019s thoughts.Crash! Crash!As expected of a knight, Clovey\u2019s movements were fast, and his attacks had great power. From what Zich knew, Clovey was the strongest among Joachim\u2019s subordinates\u2014no, he was one of the strongest knights in the whole Dracul estate. Compared to Zich\u2019s younger brother, Greig, or a beginner knight like Byner, Clovey was an experienced and powerful knight.\u201cHyaaat!\u201dZich bounced off Clovey\u2019s cleverly placed sword attacks. Since Clovey\u2019s sword was fast and strong, Zich\u2019s hands were becoming a bit sore. However, it was not only Clovey that Zich had to pay attention to.Slide!As if it appeared from the ground, a dagger suddenly jumped towards Zich\u2019s side. With his elbows, Zich pushed the dagger away by hitting its hilt. Just when it seemed as if Zich had avoided one dagger, another came flying towards his side. Zich pushed that one away too, and while he was occupied with the dagger, Clovey made a giant swing.Whish!Just the sound of his swing shook the air. Zich expressionlessly watched Clovey\u2019s sword move in front of him. Since the magnitude of Clovey\u2019s attack was large, the assassins had to take a moment to escape from his attack. Thus, when Zich evaded Clovey\u2019s attack, the battle came to a stop.But this only lasted for a moment, and very soon, numerous opponents came running towards Zich again.\u2018The flow of their movements is very good.\u2019Even Zich was amazed by Clovey and the assassins\u2019 abilities to coordinate their attacks. It was even more amazing because the assassins probably received no professional training in connecting their attacks with Clovey.\u2018The assassins look as if they were trained to coordinate their attacks, but I\u2019m sure that they didn\u2019t train with Clovey.\u2019There were definitely areas where Clovey and the assassin\u2019s attacks did not flow well together. The problem was that those areas were extremely small, and it was very difficult to fight them. However, their opponent was Zich.\u2018Even though it\u2019s their first time working together, it\u2019s amazing that they can work together so well. But it\u2019s not perfect.\u2019There were very small gaps between their attacks, but it was still a gap. Zich pierced his sword in between the openings. Clovey and the assassins tried to respond, but they ended up flinching for a second. The area that Zich pierced was the minuscule gap between their unified attack flow. After a moment of hesitation, the assassins slowed down to let Clovey block Zich\u2019s attacks. An ordinary person would never be able to notice this slight hesitation, but this opening was enough for Zich.Clash!\u201cUgh!\u201d Clovey let out a cry of pain. Since he changed his movement so drastically, he lost a bit of his balance, and Zich used that to his advantage and attacked Clovey. However, Zich\u2019s goal was not to attack Clovey. At that moment when the assassin slowed down and Clovey drew back, Zich squished his body between them and met the assassin\u2019s wide eyes.Whish!Zich swung his sword. The assassin who just slowed down tried to accelerate again, but in the process of gaining speed, the assassin ended up jumping towards Zich\u2019s sword. This was the shining result of Zich\u2019s battle sense honed from countless battles and life experiences.However, the assassin didn\u2019t easily back down. He had also prepared something as well.\u201cAck!\u201dThe assassin reached out his hand and grabbed someone near him; at the sudden pull, the person screamed. However, the assassin paid no attention to the person\u2019s screams and pulled his hand back. The person who the assassin grabbed was a villager.The villagers were blackmailed by the assassins and forced to lie down in the temple, but they awkwardly stayed near the battle. They were paralyzed by the intense battle in front of them, but they also didn\u2019t have the strength or abilities to intervene. But the assassins had a way to utilize these harmless villagers by using them as shields. For any sane person, if they saw an ordinary villager in front of them, they would hesitate for at least a moment. No matter how much they hardened their hearts, it was normal for the end of their swords to waver a bit.But the problem was that Zich was not \u2018normal,\u2019 and he was not completely sane either. Zich slowed down his sword. Since he decided to live a kind life, he couldn\u2019t just kill an ordinary villager. If his life was at stake, he might cut a villager without hesitation, but this was not the case. But Zich did not want to helplessly evade all the attacks directed towards him just because a villager was being used as a shield. He didn\u2019t want to go that far, and his evasions did not help end the situation.\u2018Also, that bastard\u2019s face is annoying.\u2019Zich wanted to destroy the assassin\u2019s arrogant expression which seemed to say, \u2018So what are you gonna do now, huh?\u2019\u201cAgh!\u201dWith a menacing sound, a villager\u2019s scream echoed out. The villager quickly lost his sense of balance and fell down. The villager\u2019s right shin was bent as if it was another joint. Zich\u2019s kick had broken his bone. However, Zich\u2019s attacks towards the villager were far from over.Crunch! Crunch! Crunch!Zich kicked him exactly three more times, and the villager\u2019s limbs looked as if they all gained a few more joints.\u201cAh! Ahhhhh!\u201d All of the villager\u2019s bones broke at once, and he shrieked in pain. The villager wanted to grab onto his wounds, but because the bones in his arms were also broken, he couldn\u2019t do anything else other than scream. Without a care for his struggle, Zich lifted the villager and threw him far away.Drop.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dZich heard shrieks again. Blood poured out of the man\u2019s body like rainfall as the man\u2019s broken bones protruded outside his skin, but Zich didn\u2019t care. The best course of action he could take right now was to immobilize the moving meat shields and scare them away from the battlefield. It didn\u2019t matter if the meat shields suffered injuries in the process.\u201cShould I make the rest of them like this as well?\u201d Zich purposefully said this loudly. Then he saw some of the villagers near him quickly run away after seeing the gruesome state of the villager used as a shield. Yet, Zich wasn\u2019t considerate enough to care for their \u2018trivial\u2019 worries.Clovey and the assassins attacked Zich again. However, Zich didn\u2019t counterattack. He stealthily avoided their attacks and headed towards the villagers. Clovey screamed at the villagers to fight Zich, but it was impossible. They were too demoralized from seeing what Zich was capable of doing; his cruel attacks and the screams that followed had shaken them too much. The villagers screamed and scattered like a herd of rabbits in front of a tiger.\u2018It will be more bothersome if they get out of my sight.\u2019Zich calmly broke another villager\u2019s limbs and threw them far away.\u201cHey!\u201d Zich shouted. Hans and Snoc immediately realized that Zich was calling for them and turned around.\u201cTake care of the meat shields like this!\u201d Zich showed how he broke a villager\u2019s limbs and threw them far away. Like Zich, Hans and Snoc were also suffering from having to deal with the villagers. They also realized that their opponents were ordinary people who had been blackmailed. However, unlike Zich, they were struggling to harm the villagers while knowing that they were dealing with ordinary people. That was why Zich had decided to set a\u2014not so mild\u2014 example for them to follow.\u2018W-We have to do that?\u2019 Snoc was stunned by Zich\u2019s cruel actions, but Hans was different. Of course, Hans wasn\u2019t happy about following Zich\u2019s orders, as his slightly raised eyebrows indicated. However, he swung his sword without hesitation.Slice!\u201cAhhhh!\u201dA sword skimmed a person\u2019s shin. Blood spilled out and cries of pain rang throughout the room. Someone who had no experience in battle couldn\u2019t keep their composure after being sliced by a sword. The villager bent over without caring if he was in the middle of a battle or not. Hans took that moment to swing his scabbard and crush the man\u2019s limbs. Then, he kicked the villager a distance away.Unlike Zich, Hans had always seemed like a sensible person; but seeing him like this, Snoc became speechless.Punch!The ground rose below Snoc and struck the assassins\u2019 stomachs. Snoc had been distracted, but now he was startled.Koo!Nowem cried out loudly on Snoc\u2019s shoulders; he was giving a warning.\u201cSorry! Thank you, Nowem!\u201d\u2018Yeah, that\u2019s right. I can\u2019t just keep going back and forth. It\u2019s better than killing them.\u2019Following Hans and Zich, Snoc also focused on immobilizing the villagers. However, even while doing that, Snoc stole furtive glances at Hans. He shook his head when he saw Hans recklessly crushing the villagers\u2019 limbs with his sword and scabbard.\u2018Even my senior is becoming more like Sir Zich.\u2019At that moment, Snoc almost became certain that he would also become like that. As Zich, Hans, and Snoc ignored the assassins and Clovey to focus their attention on the villagers, the number of mobile villagers decreased quickly. Of course, Zich continued to also slice some of the assassins while everything was going on. There were even some guys who shot out artifacts from time to time, but Zich evaded or intercepted their attacks.\u201cAs expected, you have some skills,\u201d Clovey muttered while glaring at Zich.\u201cMy skills are definitely superior to yours. It seems like you brought those guys to make up for that, but it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re helping much,\u201d Zich retorted.The assassins didn\u2019t move even while Zich ridiculed them. They just stayed in their position and looked for Zich\u2019s blindspots.Thus, Zich spat out some more words. \u201cIt\u2019s at a level where it\u2019s hard to believe you guys are here to create demons out of people, including Joachim, all over the world.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Clovey scowled, but the assassins responded differently. It was fleeting, but Zich noticed a slight disturbance. Even the assassins who had trained to suppress their emotional expressions couldn\u2019t help but respond a little bit after having their goal completely seen through.\u2018I\u2019m right!\u2019This made Zich more certain. These people were trying to make Demon People all over the world. The assassins all moved at once. Their skills didn\u2019t improve, nor did their attacks become more dangerous, but Zich could sense that their mindset had changed; in their eyes, Zich had changed from \u2018a guy they had to kill\u2019 to \u2018a guy they couldn\u2019t fail to kill.\u2019 However, they couldn\u2019t kill Zich just by changing their mindset.Slice!\u201cArgh!\u201dCrack!\u201cArgh!\u201dAt Zich\u2019s sword, the assassins lost their lives one by one. It was the same for the assassins who Hans and Snoc fought.Pop!The assassins avoided the stalagmites shooting up from the ground, but they were traps. Hans expected them to avoid the attacks, so he swung his sword at them.\u201cUrgh!\u201d An assassin groaned as the sword opened up his chest. He was among the many who fell victim to these types of attacks. Some lost their heads. Although the assassin group had laid down a trap, it wasn\u2019t very effective because Zich found it out in the middle. Their large numbers also became useless as the villagers used as meat shields were immobilized.\u201c\u2026Damn it!\u201d Realizing the situation he was in, Clovey gritted his teeth. \u2018I really didn\u2019t want to use this\u2026\u2019Clovey shuffled through his belongings. He hesitated for a moment, but when he saw another assassin lose his life, Clovey made his final decision. He took out a small bottle and drank the whole thing down in one gulp.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Huh?\u2019As he continued to kill off the assassins who dared to attack him, Zich noticed something was strange.\u2018Their atmosphere changed again.\u2019A calm atmosphere enveloped the assassins. They looked like monks who knew they were going to die soon and fully accepted their fate. So far, the assassins had never shown signs of being afraid of death, but now they looked as if death was imminent for them.\u2018He must be the reason.\u2019Zich stared at Clovey who was a few feet away from him. He thought Clovey had gulped down a potion, but Zich had judged wrong.\u201cKuaaaaaaa!\u201d Clovey let out a scream. He pierced his own body and squirmed in pain.\u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t eat random food off the ground.\u201dZich clicked his tongue in an exaggerated way. However, while he was fighting off the assassins, Zich\u2019s eyes never left Clovey.Crack!Clovey\u2019s skin shook like ocean waves; his armor crumpled, and his muscles swelled up to enormous proportions. As his body increased, his lower body also exponentially increased.\u201cRoaaaar!\u201d Clovey\u2019s screams changed to roars in the middle; his voice no longer sounded human. Now one head taller than his original state, Clovey looked down at Zich. His black eyes indicated that he was no longer sane.\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201cT-that\u2014!\u201dHans and Snoc were shocked by Clovey\u2019s transformation. Zich raised his alert level one step higher; but surprisingly, Zich was delighted. Zich had seen Clovey\u2019s transformation before, and he was familiar with its appearance.\u2018It\u2019s Fest!\u2019Now, Zich knew for sure. Even though he didn\u2019t know who Fest was, Zich was now confident that he met Fest at least once in his pre-regression days. No, to be more precise, Zich and his subordinates had coincidentally visited a place where Fest had spread infectious diseases. Like Snoc and Hans, Zich and his subordinates had been eagerly anticipating arriving in a city after a long journey to eat lots of delicious food and sleep in a warm bed, but the city they arrived in was decimated by epidemics.Since Fest\u2019s notoriety was at its peak, Zich and his subordinates knew about Fest\u2019s existence from the very beginning and were furious at Fest for hampering their plans. They looked all over the city for Fest but could not find any trace of Fest\u2019s whereabouts. However, it seemed as if Fest was also annoyed by Zich and his companions since Fest sent assassins to bombard them. And during this time, one of the assassins showed the same characteristics as Clovey.Fortunately, Zich and his subordinates were able to destroy the whole city, along with Fest\u2019s underlings. However, even till the end, Zich hadn\u2019t been able to figure out the source of the assassin\u2019s transformation. Since Fest was involved, the transformation was probably related to a disease, but Zich had never heard of or seen a disease that completely transformed a person\u2019s body. But because of how unknown it was, Zich was sure that Fest was involved.Even though Zich was happy at discovering this information, he was still in the midst of battle.\u2018It\u2019s getting dangerous.\u2019Zich accepted his situation easily.\u201cKuaaaaaaah!\u201d Clovey screamed and jumped towards Zich. Even though he was much larger now, his speed also increased.\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d\u2018No wonder those guys acted like they were about to die.\u2019Clovey was no longer able to differentiate between friend and foe; he attacked everyone that was between his path to Zich.\u2018In my past life, I remember they at least had the ability to differentiate their targets.\u2019It seemed as if the transformation had evolved over time. While Clovey was running berserk, the assassins merely moved a bit away from Clovey and continued to attack Zich. Their will to kill Zich was so strong that they were willing to sacrifice themselves.\u2018Should I change locations first?\u2019If they continued to fight here, there was a high possibility that the whole temple would collapse on them. Then all the villagers inside the temple would die. Fortunately, Clovey senselessly followed Zich, and he was able to bring Clovey out to the middle of the village with relative ease.Slam!Clovey appeared right in front of Zich. It was as if a heavy stone had landed in front of him, and Clovey began to wield his sword with great force.\u2018This is why these guys are so bothersome.\u2019Even though Clovey looked like an ogre on the outside, he still possessed all his skills. Compared to his body, the sword he wielded looked like a wooden stick, and with proficient skill, Clovey moved his sword as naturally as flowing water.Crash! Crash! Craash!They exchanged multiple blows. Zich winced as his hands became sore. Clovey\u2019s strength and speed had increased exponentially. Even though Clovey\u2019s skills dropped noticeably after his transformation, his new strength and speed more than made up for it.Crash!Moreover, the assassins continuously threw daggers at Zich and distracted him.\u201cRoar!\u201dClovey thrust his hand down with his free hand. Zich evaded the attack by a hair\u2019s breadth.Slam!The force of Clovey\u2019s hand made a deep indentation on the ground. Zich wielded his sword between the openings in Clovey\u2019s defense.Crash!Even though Zich slammed his sword on Clovey\u2019s skin, it sounded as if he was hitting metal. Zich could even pierce through metal with his mana, but there was not even a scratch on Clovey\u2019s skin.\u201cHa!\u201dEven though Clovey was in berserk mode, it seemed as if he had enough sense to make a mocking smirk at Zich\u2019s attack. With both of his lips pressed upwards, Clovey moved for another attack at Zich.\u2018As expected.\u2019Even though Zich\u2019s attacks failed, he wasn\u2019t very disappointed because he had expected that to happen.\u2018Judging by how much mana he has, my Mana Resonance won\u2019t work.\u2019The amount of mana that flowed out of Clovey was as great as a tidal wave, and Zich was surprised that the mana didn\u2019t tear apart Clovey\u2019s whole body. With the amount of mana Clovey currently had, Zich couldn\u2019t use Mana Resonance against him.\u2018I guess I can\u2019t help it. I have to strain myself a bit.\u2019Zich checked his mana. The amount of mana he had was much greater than the amount he had at the Iruce mine.\u2018Now it looks like I have some mana.\u2019The amount of mana Zich currently had was the same as a high-level knight in an estate with enormous military power. It was not a small amount\u2014no, by normal standards, Zich had a huge amount of mana; but compared to his Demon Lord days when his mana was comparable to a dragon\u2019s mana, the amount he had right now was barely passable for him.On the other hand, the amount of mana he had was not enough to defeat Clovey. But if he combined all his skills, it would be a totally different situation.Zich used the \u2018Extension of the Senses\u2019 technique to extend his senses to the tip of his sword and make the weapon part of his body. And through Mana Resonance, he gained control of the surrounding mana. But unlike last time, he didn\u2019t take control of his opponent\u2019s mana but nature\u2019s mana that flowed around him.Overall, it was more difficult to control unprocessed mana from nature than a processed one like a human\u2019s. But with Zich\u2019s advanced mana manipulation skills, it was possible. While fighting Clovey, Zich concentrated on his skill. Even for Zich, this skill required a great amount of concentration, so he let many attacks hit his body and acquired scratches all over his body.It appeared as if he was being cornered, but Zich\u2019s eyes were calm. An immense amount of mana concentrated into the ends of his sword. It flared like a wild horse about to run out at any moment, but Zich carefully reined it in. Using the resonance from the mana, he connected the mana at the tip of his sword into the natural mana around him like inserting a thread into a needle.Of course, he didn\u2019t connect it elaborately, and the connection was more like layering the mana over each other. However, nature\u2019s mana could handle the rest. Zich rolled his feet once and distanced himself from Clovey\u2019s attacks. Because of this movement, Clovey seemed to have judged that Zich was running away, so he dashed forward while shrieking.The assassins also collaborated together. Some of them tried to block Zich\u2019s paths of escape, and some of them moved away from Clovey to attack Zich from a distance.\u2018Ah, these assassins can use their heads too.\u2019There was already a significant number of assassins who had died under Clovey\u2019s hands, but the assassins continued to participate in the battle.\u2018But it\u2019s commendable that they didn\u2019t run away.\u2019Zich didn\u2019t have to expend his energy chasing those guys. Zich extended his sword out and took a stance to pierce his enemy. Without hesitation, he aimed for Clovey. With the skill, Piercing Space, he shot out the immense amount of mana concentrated at the tip of his sword.Whoosh!Without form and sound, the attack\u2019s force pierced through space. The formless force spun forward and exploded on Clovey. Feeling the danger, Clovey tried to escape, but the force was faster.Pierce!Even Clovey\u2019s hardened skin couldn\u2019t block this attack. On Clovey\u2019s chest, a hole the size of a finger formed.\u201cUgh!\u201d Clovey let out a groan, and blood spurted out from his wound. But that was it. Clovey smiled at Zich like he was saying that Zich couldn\u2019t stop him with just that. Yet, Zich was also aware of that.\u2018I\u2019ve experienced this before.\u2019Pop!The surrounding mana began to move; they were all flurrying around to squeeze inside the small path that Zich\u2019s attack had passed through. It was the effect of the \u2018structure\u2019 that he had placed in with nature\u2019s mana. All the mana in the area shot forward, resonating with Zich\u2019s mana and the mana that was scattered all over their surroundings. Then, it began to spin.Claaaaash!There was a gigantic current. The mana spun wildly and began to reduce its surroundings into dust. It began to destroy everything\u2014the building and assassins near it, including Clovey in the center\u2014and flipped the ground below them upside down. It was a giant whirlwind.\u201cAhh!\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201dAssassins near Clovey screamed. They got mixed into the whirlwind, and their bodies became mutilated in mid-air. They couldn\u2019t hold in their screams as their bodies got ripped apart alive.\u201cKuuuuuu!\u201dAt the center of the whirlwind, Clovey withstood it with his hardened physical body, mana, and experience. However, that didn\u2019t last long. Mana poured into the areas of his body where there were holes, and the whirlwind hammered the surface of his skin. Cracks appeared all over his body, and blood seeped out.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dPop!Like a dam that had reached its limit, Clovey\u2019s body broke into pieces with a loud death cry. The whirlwind continued for a while as if it couldn\u2019t be satisfied until it destroyed everything within its sphere of influence. When the whirlwind finally died down, they saw that most of the village had been completely devastated.It was difficult to believe that the mass destruction was the work of a human. The whirlwind had been such a destructive force that Hans, Snoc, and the assassins stopped their battles for a moment to stare. Yet, the one who actually caused that destruction snorted like it was nothing.\u2018To think that it only made this much of an effect.\u2019He had expected this \u201cminimal\u201d effect to a certain degree, but it was different seeing it in reality. \u2018Piercing Spiral Blast\u2019\u2014it was a bit of a childish title, but it was a technique that he used while transitioning from being a Demon Person to having the title, Demon Lord. In a way, it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that the skill was one of the many that had given Zich his notorious title.Gurgle!A metallic taste rose from his throat.\u2018Wow! What is up with all these issues?\u2019Zich spat out a lump of blood.\u2018My internal organs suffered injuries from just this?\u2019He was talking about himself, but he thought his body\u2019s condition was pathetic.\u201cSir Zich!\u201d Hans called out in an urgent voice. Zich glanced around and saw a group of assassins charging forward. The assassins had been cowering from behind just a moment ago, but it seemed like they had gathered up their courage once again.\u2018It\u2019s probably because I spat out some blood.\u2019They now thought Zich was an easier opponent, but the price for a hasty judgment was death. Zich fixed his grip on his sword. Frankly, Zich\u2019s condition wasn\u2019t good. Even a potion didn\u2019t immediately heal internal wounds, especially ones inflicted by mana.\u2018But they are all just small fry.\u201dZich blocked the dagger that flew towards him and sliced the nearest assassin. A while later, all who gazed at Zich could see him taking his sweet time wiping the blood off his sword next to a pile of assassins in a pool of blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe battle was over. Zich took out a potion and gulped it down. All the shallow and deep injuries in his body disappeared at once. However, the uncomfortable pain inside his body persisted.\u2018It will probably take at least one or two days for the pain to completely disappear.\u2019It had been a while since Zich experienced this type of pain.\u2018Before I regressed, when I first came out of the Steelwall family, I experienced this type of pain on a daily basis.\u2019It was not only on a daily basis. While his whole body was in severe pain, he had to continuously fight new battles. Zich walked towards Hans and Snoc. They had their backs to each other and were trying to catch their breaths. Their bodies were full of wounds from their fierce battles.\u201cHey, take this!\u201d Zich took out two potions and threw them at Snoc and Hans. They quickly gulped down the potions, and as their injuries and pain faded away, their complexions improved.\u201cThis is really good, right?\u201d Snoc said to Nowem. Snoc was still amazed by the existence of potions that instantly healed people\u2019s injuries. But Hans was calm, and he looked at Snoc with pity in his eyes.\u2018There will come a time when you will get sick of these potions.\u2019To be more specific, Snoc would have many more opportunities to consume potions in the future\u2014from Zich\u2019s training and the events Zich led them into. By now, Hans expected an intense event to come up wherever Zich went, and Hans sighed that his expectations were always right.Zich placed an enormous amount of potions down in front of Hans and Snoc.\u201cTreat everyone in this temple with these potions.\u201dHans became speechless at the giant pile of potions in front of him. He was not only surprised by the number of potions, but the ones that Zich laid in front of them were of the highest quality so it was even more expensive than usual.\u2018I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s giving such expensive goods to commoners like them.\u2019Did Zich just like giving people stuff?\u2018No way.\u2019Even though Hans was the one who thought this, he laughed at how ridiculous this thought was. Instead, Hans asked, \u201cDo we really treat them all? They tried to attack us.\u201d\u201cI saw their skills and movements, but they probably only attacked us because they were blackmailed. But it\u2019s good to be definite about matters like this. Before you heal them, give them a warning\u2014if they try to harm us again, we will show them no mercy.\u201d\u201cWhat if they attack us?\u201d\u201cKill them,\u201d Zich commanded Hans without an ounce of hesitation. Hans and Snoc gulped and nodded at Zich\u2019s menacing aura. Hans and Snoc each carried a pile of potions and went inside the temple. After Zich saw them go in, he turned back and walked towards the assassins\u2019 corpses.Zich began looking through the corpses. From their bodies, he found several self-detonation artifacts that they couldn\u2019t use this time. Assassins typically used these devices. However, other than the artifacts, there were no other clues about their identities.\u2018I wish I could have investigated that Clovey bastard too.\u2019Zich glanced over at the traces of Clovey\u2019s shredded body.\u2018Well, whatever. It\u2019s already enough that I found out that Fest and the organization group are working together.\u2019Moreover, there were more people he could retrieve information from. Zich turned his glance back to the temple and went inside. Hans and Snoc looked like they did a good job in giving out the potions since the villagers looked completely fine. The villagers were sitting together in a group, and Hans and Snoc stood at a distance and watched over them. It seemed as if their warning worked very well because the villagers were trembling in fear, and they could not even bring themselves to resist.Zich walked towards them. The villagers near him dragged their butts and desperately tried to move away from him. However, the walls of the temple stopped them. The villagers\u2019 ages were diverse\u2014 they ranged from elderly men and women to young children. The assassins probably placed them there to lessen Zich\u2019s suspicion.\u2018Even though it was useless.\u2019Their opponents were too experienced. Zich experienced traps like these far too many times that it gave him a headache. In the first place, it was weird that no matter how urgent the situation was, Joachim, who greatly respected Zich, sent Clovey over to ask a request in his stead.\u2018And Clovey also let out his bloodlust a few times.\u2019Since Clovey was not experienced in tricking people, he probably couldn\u2019t help it. But Clovey was not a bad actor.\u2018Snoc and Hans didn\u2019t notice anything was off.\u2019Clovey could have probably tricked most people. However, Zich was too experienced, and his senses were way too sharp to fall for Clovey\u2019s act. The patient\u2019s attitudes had also been off. Whenever a caretaker or a specific individual passed by, fear crept into the villagers\u2019 eyes.If Zich had not known that it was a trap early on, he might have approached the patients to check their conditions; then, the assassins disguised as patients would have jumped out with daggers and forced him into battle.\u201cHey,\u201d Zich called out to the nearest villager. His brash attitude was like that of a gangster\u2019s. \u201cWho is your leader?\u201dThe villagers\u2019 eyes wandered until they all landed on one person: he was an old man whose head was half balding.\u201cAre you the village chief?\u201d\u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s right.\u201d The village chief felt threatened by Zich\u2019s rough way of speaking and readily admitted his position.\u201cExplain.\u201d Zich spat out a very simple, single word. He couldn\u2019t have been any ruder, but the village chief understood what Zich meant and began to explain their situation to Zich. One day, a disease began to spread around the village. The disease was so infectious that by the time they realized the situation they were in, the whole village had been infected. It was also a disease that inflicted great pain and caused intense symptoms strong enough to kill people one by one.It was during this time that the assassins approached them. To their amazement, the assassins had the cure to the disease. The villagers celebrated, but unfortunately for them, they soon realized they were dealing with fiendish people. The assassins blackmailed the villagers with the cure to kill Zich and his companions.\u201cSo that\u2019s why you all worked together to kill me?\u201d\u201cP-Please have mercy! We simply wanted to live!\u201dThe scene of an old man wailing with his knees on the ground wasn\u2019t a nice sight to see. Hans and Snoc felt pity for the old man. However, Zich\u2019s pitch-black heart didn\u2019t feel an ounce of sympathy. He glanced at the villagers. They looked like they still hadn\u2019t recovered from their disease.\u2018It must be that, right?\u2019 When he heard that they were blackmailed, Zich recalled something. \u2018Fest frequently used diseases to get more underlings.\u2019Thinking about how the villagers\u2019 physical abilities had also increased, Zich was even more confident that this was Fest\u2019s doing. From what he knew, Fest also infected their underlings with some kind of special disease to keep them in check. The disease had a long latency period, and once the disease began its onset, it killed its victim with certainty. Fest used a cruel disease that caused intense pain and killed any victims that dared to betray Fest.\u2018The disease came with an increase in physical activities as well.\u2019Thus, it was a humane act to kill all of Fest\u2019s underlings. However, Zich, who was farthest away from the word \u2018humane,\u2019 purposefully didn\u2019t end their lives and let them be.\u2018This disease got so strong that it became impossible to cure it later on. But right now, it might be\u2026\u2019But before that, Zich needed confirmation that this disease was what he was thinking of. He pulled on the ears of the village chief who was crying. The village chief groaned while the villagers screamed and wailed, but Zich just stared at the back of the village chief\u2019s ears.\u2018It\u2019s there.\u2019Zich\u2019s eyes shone.* * *The butler of the Dracul family was busy. Because of the Count\u2019s absence and the catastrophic epidemic around the estate, he was hundreds of times busier than usual. If he wasn\u2019t originally a knight and possessed great stamina, Shalom would have fainted from exhaustion a couple of times by now.But even though Shalom should have still been busy, he was out in the castle\u2019s backyard. Anyone could see that the place wasn\u2019t suitable for work. However, Shalom was staring at a tree with great intensity.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re late.\u201dHe heard some movement near him and looked at where it came from. It was chilling to see only Shalom\u2019s pupils moving while his face didn\u2019t budge. A man wearing a robe stood in front of him.\u201cDo you all not understand the concept of time?\u201d Shalom criticized the robed man, but the man didn\u2019t seem bothered. He simply said one line: \u201cWe failed.\u201d\u201c\u2026Failed?\u201d\u201cYeah. We were annihilated.\u201dShalom\u2019s face turned from annoyance to rage.\u201cWe took a lot of care and time in making Clovey. We let you borrow him even though we didn\u2019t want to since you kept insisting and told us about some unknown variable. But you failed? Got annihilated?\u201d\u201cYeah. He was stronger than we expected.\u201d\u201cSo didn\u2019t I tell you to just leave him alone?\u201d\u201cWe have our own plans like your group has its own plans. Besides, I really hate unexpected variables.\u201d\u201cA plan is just a plan! Unknown variables will always exist! That\u2019s why a plan always has to be revised! Even if you eliminate the unknown variable, another one will pop out! Then, do you plan on continuing to eliminate all the unknown variables! Moreover, what do you mean by an unknown variable!? What is your standard for deciding if something is an unknown variable!\u201d\u201cAny foreign obstacle that is not part of our plan.\u201d\u201cHmph! It almost sounds as if your organization is aware of all the players in their plan beforehand and can control them accordingly. Can you guys see the future or something?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cWhat bullshit.\u201d Shalom immediately cut the man\u2019s words. Was the man saying he was like a god who was able to see the future? However, the unusually stoic man smiled slightly.\u201cDo you still think that even while considering Joachim\u2019s case?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShalom didn\u2019t have anything to say about that. The second son of the Dracul family was too weak to even learn mana. Even if his subordinates had shielded him in the field, he should have been infected by the epidemic in the countryside and died. However, Joachim was still alive.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? That Joachim will come back alive.\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t claim that you guys can see the future with just that much.\u201dShalom still couldn\u2019t believe that the man or anyone in his organization could see the future.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you believe me or not.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dThey had no trust in each other. They had simply joined hands for the same goal.\u201cIt seems like the villagers are still alive.\u201d\u201cThey are going to die anyway, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cBut they could expose us and say we artificially spread a disease.\u201d\u201cAll they can find out is that there\u2019s medicine for the disease they got. If your underlings\u2019 mouths aren\u2019t loose, we won\u2019t get found out.\u201d\u201cMy subordinates have tight lips. I\u2019m not sure about yours though.\u201d\u201cIn any case, the village chief doesn\u2019t know anything about us anyway. He fell to blackmail like the rest of the villagers. That strengthening medicine is rare, but we still have plenty others like it. Don\u2019t you guys also have something similar?\u201d\u201cThat is also true.\u201dThe man didn\u2019t say more. It was an unemotional conversation where they only exchanged information, but both Shalom and the man found this system most suitable for them. Their relationship was perfect like this.\u201cEven if you failed to get rid of him, I have no intention of continuing with your fickleness. I will call that person.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t the unknown variable also have medical knowledge?\u201d\u201cIt was revealed that he doesn\u2019t have knowledge in medicine. It seems as if he really found the medicine\u2019s formula by coincidence.\u201d\u201c\u2026He really is full of unknown variables.\u201dIt was the first time Shalom saw the man disgruntled. The man must really hate unknown variables.\u201cOkay, fine. If I can do my work, I\u2019m fine with that.\u201dThe man finally agreed; he also didn\u2019t intend to continue talking about the unknown variable any longer. Just like that, the night filled with plotting grew darker.* * *Zich, Hans, and Snoc came back to Ospurin. To tell Joachim what happened in the village, they looked for Joachim\u2019s whereabouts. Fortunately, Joachim also had something urgent to tell Zich, so when Zich came to look for him, Joachim spoke first with a stiff face.\u201cThey took Ms. Bargot to the castle.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, Hans and Snoc did not understand the gravity of the situation and just stared at both Zich and Joachim.\u201cSir, what did they say their justification was?\u201d\u201cSince Ms. Bargot is a proficient medical expert, they want her to take a look at the Count\u2019s condition.\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t there a lot of people who already checked the Count\u2019s condition?\u201d\u201cOf course. We brought in a great number of skilled doctors and priests to heal the Count. But they all shook their heads, and most of them said that the Count did not have long to live.\u201d\u201cSir, then what are your thoughts? Do you really think they took Ms. Bargot so that she could check up on the Count\u2019s condition? Or is it\u2026\u201d Zich lowered his voice. \u201cBecause diseases are now spreading in the castle?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHans and Snoc were shocked, but Joachim remained calm. He expected that Zich might have already suspected this.\u201cTo be frank, I don\u2019t really know.\u201d Joachim was not able to give a clear answer. Since he didn\u2019t have enough information, he couldn\u2019t give a definite answer to Zich. However, it wasn\u2019t as if he had no likely conjectures inside his mind.\u201cBut that is also a high possibility.\u201d\u201cSince they took Ms. Bargot, I guess it\u2019s pretty clear that they aren\u2019t going to inform us about the state of the castle.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s probably true. If infectious diseases are spreading inside the castle, Ms. Bargot would be a coveted talent. Not only is she an expert on infectious diseases, but she is also not a threat to my brother\u2019s authority unlike you Sir Zich, who is widely known to be working with me.\u201d\u201cI guess it would be better to not hear back from the castle.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dJoachim\u2019s voice was grave.\u201cIf they call us back to the castle to take care of the disease, it will mean that even Ms. Bargot was not able to curb the disease inside the castle.\u201dMoreover, there was no one here who knew more about infectious diseases than Ms. Bargot. Therefore, this would also mean that an uncontrollable disease was spreading in the castle.\u201c\u2026But since nothing is definite yet, let\u2019s continue with what we were doing. Thinking about it, didn\u2019t you have something to say to me?\u201d\u201cBefore that, did you request something from me through Sir Clovey?\u201d\u201cA request? No, I never did.\u201dZich explained what happened with Clovey to Joachim. At first, Joachim was surprised, but as Zich continued his story, various emotions appeared on Joachim\u2019s face\u2014anger, confusion, disbelief, and more. When Zich finished his account, Joachim\u2019s face was extremely serious, and he stared intently at Zich. Anyone could see that Joachim was in an intense dilemma, and after a while Joachim finally opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026I believe you, Sir Zich.\u201dHans and Snoc nervously stood next to Zich, and they let out breaths of relief. On the other hand, Zich predicted that Joachim would say something like this.\u2018The biggest reason for Joachim\u2019s response must be because I gave him the cure to Igram.\u201dThat was how rare and significant the Igram cure was. Zich expected Joachim to just cover up this affair or sweep it under the rug. Even though Zich gained a lot of credibility with Joachim in an extremely short amount of time, Clovey had been with Joachim for a long time as his subordinate. Joachim would probably do an investigation, but since it was undeniable that Clovey took Zich out to the village, Zich was not worried.\u201cWhat happened to the villagers?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I think they are probably alive.\u201dZich lied this time, but Joachim didn\u2019t seem suspicious of him.\u201cMr. Zich, if your words are true, what do you think my brother is planning?\u201dJoachim didn\u2019t know about the existence of Fest or the assassin organization. In addition, when Zich explained what happened to him in the village with Clovey, Zich took Fest and the assassins out of his narrative. For that reason, Joachim\u2019s suspicion obviously went to his brother, Biyom, and he thought Biyom was the one behind recent events.\u201cYour brother might be irritated that I\u2019m helping you. From their side, they would have never expected your reputation to rise so much from the cure and Ms. Bargot\u2019s prevention strategies.\u201d\u201cSo those are the reasons why he wanted to kill you? Then isn\u2019t Ms. Bargot also in a dangerous situation?\u201d\u201cNo, if he wanted to kill Ms. Bargot, I don\u2019t think he would have called her to the castle. It would have been better for him to take her out of Ospurin with me. There\u2019s a high possibility that he judged her abilities highly and wanted to use her knowledge for himself, especially if we assume that infectious diseases are currently spreading inside the castle.\u201d\u201c\u2026If I can, I really want to file a complaint.\u201d\u201cBut we have no evidence.\u201dA mysterious organization and Clovey were the ones who tried to kill Zich.\u201cI can\u2019t believe Sir Clovey would betray us,\u201d Joachim said with bitterness in his voice. He felt betrayed by someone he trusted, and at the same time, he became worried that another person in his group might betray him.\u201cYou can never tell what\u2019s in a person\u2019s heart.\u201d\u201cYes, I agree. But first of all, let\u2019s quickly end this disease as soon as possible so that I can return to the castle.\u201dJoachim\u2019s eyes were filled with determination.* * *Despite the concern that infectious diseases might be spreading inside the castle, Joachim and Zich continued their work as usual. They were close to ending Igram once and for all. The infected areas were decreasing at a steady pace, and new cases had already decreased at a record rate; more people survived rather than died from the disease. Soon after, the last patient got up from the bed.The people celebrated in unison. Since Igram first spread throughout the world, this was the first time people were able to stop the spread of Igram with such limited casualties.\u201cThis is all thanks to Sir Zich and Ms. Bargot!\u201d Joachim said with happiness in his voice. Even though there were many people who were happy about Igram\u2019s end, Joachim, along with everyone who had been fighting the diseases from the very beginning, were completely elated. It was because this was their first victory after many devastating failures.\u201cBut we can\u2019t let down our guard just yet. New cases might appear again after a few days.\u201d\u201cOf course! We also haven\u2019t completely let down our guards yet!\u201dAs the person said, while their hearts were full of joy, Joachim\u2019s task force was still investigating whether or not there were any infected patients they overlooked, especially in areas with high infection rates.\u201cThen that\u2019s fine.\u201dThe task force was prepared for any unexpected problems. Then Zich brought up something that could be more dangerous than the recurrence of Igram.\u201cDid you hear anything back from the castle?\u201dEven though the mood had been good, Joachim\u2019s face stiffened again.\u201cYes, we ordered some people to look around the castle\u2019s surroundings and inquired about some of the maids there, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything special going on.\u201d\u201cWhat about Ms. Bargot?\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anything about her.\u201d Joachim shook his head.\u201cIt would be ideal if she is residing in the castle to care for my father\u2019s health.\u201d\u201cYes, since all other possibilities are rather gloomy.\u201dThe other possibilities could be that an epidemic was spreading inside the castle, or they wanted to keep an important talent like her from Joachim, or that Biyom had his eyes set on Ms. Bargot\u2019s talents.\u201cWhatever the case is, we can go back to the castle if we completely get rid of Igram. Even my brother can\u2019t stop me for no reason now. I will find out what happened then.\u201dAlthough he had always gone with the flow, Joachim now burned with a firm resolve and determination to take control of his own destiny. Zich chuckled a little, seeing him like that.* * *Quite a bit of time passed since all traces of Igram had disappeared. The disease didn\u2019t reappear, and people thought the disease had been fully conquered. Joachim sent out a report that Igram was gone in Ospurin, and to his surprise, he received an order to return to the castle. However, like the time when Zich and his company arrived at Ospurin for the first time, they ordered Joachim to come by himself.\u201cIt seems like my brother is plotting something again,\u201d Joachim said with displeasure.\u201cWhat do you think he is plotting?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s probably something useless.\u201dNext to Joachim, Hans\u2019 eyes widened in surprise. Considering how Joachim had always talked carefully and only hinted at his bitter feelings whenever Biyom was mentioned, this change was surprising.\u201cI apologize, but you and your companions will have to wait again in your previous lodgings.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do, sir?\u201d\u201cI am planning to make my decision after seeing the state of the castle. I\u2019m going to make sure that my brother won\u2019t have his way like last time.\u201d Joachim had distinguished himself for stopping the Igram epidemic in Ospurin, and he had the people\u2019s support. Biyom couldn\u2019t threaten Joachim like before.\u201cPlease call me if you need help.\u201d\u201cThank you for everything.\u201dWith those words, Joachim took his subordinates and headed to the castle; afterward, Zich stayed in Ospurin at the same lodging he stayed in during his first days in the city. The only difference was that he met up with some of Joachim\u2019s followers from time to time. Joachim made it seem like he would knock down Biyom as soon as he entered the castle, but even after a couple of days passed, Zich didn\u2019t hear anything back from him.And like that, Hans and Snoc spent their usual, carefree days at the hotel. They didn\u2019t rest the whole time, and there were times when they were busy with Zich\u2019s orders. But after having gone through Zich\u2019s harsh training, they didn\u2019t know when they would have another chance to relax like this. Their break felt like a dream, and they enjoyed their time to the fullest. But of course, this happiness didn\u2019t last forever.\u201cWhat is it, sir?\u201d Hans asked Zich when he called them. Yet, in his heart, Hans knew that his happy time was over when he saw a fully armored Zich.\u201cGo and armor yourselves immediately. We have somewhere to go.\u201dHans knew for sure that they were going to do something unsettling. He sighed and wondered what kind of stupid fool angered Zich.\u201cSir, may I ask where we are going?\u201d Hans wanted to know who this fool was. However, when Snoc and Hans heard Zich\u2019s answer, they wondered if they heard his words correctly. Then, they wondered if something was wrong with Zich\u2019s head.\u201cWe are barging into the castle,\u201d Zich said while smiling.* * *This was the Dracul castle\u2019s basement.Inside the castle, which was famous for its fancy but practical interiors, there was a dreary and dirty area underneath. The basement prison locked up those who committed severe crimes such as treason or attempted assassination against the head of the family. Needless to say, the environment was beyond dreadful.A stuffy, fishy smell filled the area, and in the deepest corner of the prison, Joachim was imprisoned. Even in this dirty environment, he sat firmly with his back straight. However, Joachim had a frail constitution, and this environment was even worse for him. His complexion looked terrible, and his breathing was rough. His lips and eyelids were clamped shut, and there was an incredible amount of rage rushing out of his heart.\u2018Biyom Dracul!\u2019Even under all kinds of persecution and slandering, Joachim had respected Biyom as his older brother. However, all of his efforts were useless in the end. To kill him, Biyom had sent Joachim to places affected by fatal infectious diseases; and in the end, Biyom had now finally used his own hands to take care of Joachim. Yet, even in the midst of his rage against Biyom, Joachim wondered about one thing.\u2018How was he able to gain control of the castle?\u2019Biyom had always considered Joachim as a thorn in his side and plotted against his brother. However, the fact that Biyom had gone through the trouble of gathering the support of most of the castle\u2019s forces proved how significant and large Joachim\u2019s presence was in the castle. Even Biyom couldn\u2019t dispose of Joachim without a proper reason. However, to Joachim\u2019s surprise, Biyom was now able to forcefully imprison him in the castle\u2019s basement.Furthermore, he wasn\u2019t simply locked up in his room like last time but locked in prison as if he was a criminal. Even Biyom\u2019s followers should have voiced their concerns about imprisoning the Count\u2019s second son.\u2018It\u2019s completely beyond reason, but he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do this without thorough preparation.\u2019After all, Biyom\u2019s concern for his own personal safety was the greatest of anyone Joachim knew. Joachim kept racking his head to find an answer, but he couldn\u2019t think of anything reasonable. He groaned in frustration. Then, he suddenly heard an unfamiliar voice beyond the iron bars.\u201cYou look like you\u2019re suffering.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJoachim opened his eyes and stared at the man through the prison bars in front of him.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know how my older brother gained control over everyone in the castle, but the security must be terrible if a suspicious-looking person like you can just waltz into a high-level prison.\u201dThe man who came to see Joachim looked as suspicious as hell. In a prison cell where not even a ray of light could shine through, the cloaked man covered himself from top to bottom. But the man did not reply. Instead, he hung the torch on his hand to a sconce next to him. Then the man stepped one closer to the prison bars. His body was huge. Compared to Joachim who was skinny and tall, the man was extremely buff, and he was about a head taller than Joachim. However, Joachim looked straight at him without a shred of fear in his eyes.\u201cThat\u2019s impressive. Your eyes are not full of despair yet.\u201d\u201cStop saying nonsense and get to the point.\u201dJoachim usually addressed everyone with respect and honorifics, but he dropped his manners and spoke roughly to the man\u2014that was how shaken Joachim\u2019s mental state was. The man\u2019s mysterious appearance also played a significant part.\u201cFine.\u201d The man didn\u2019t like talking for long. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to fix what has gone wrong?\u201d\u201cWhat has gone wrong?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about the current state of the Dracul family. Do you seriously think the current state of the Dracul estate is normal?\u201dThere was no way Joachim thought the current state of the Dracul estate was normal. The Count was bedridden, the heir was only obsessed with power and controlled his vassals like puppets. Currently, everything about the Dracul estate was going wrong.\u201cI can\u2019t say everything is going normally. But I can\u2019t believe such a suspicious-looking guy like you is worried about the state of the Dracul estate.\u201d\u201cOf course, I have my own reasons. So, answer my question.\u201d\u201cThen how would you fix it?\u201dThe cloaked man took out something from his body. In his hand, there was a marble the size of a half-closed fist. The marble was red to the core, as if it was condensed from blood. Joachim, who had hemophobia, scrunched his face. However, he didn\u2019t move his eyes away.\u201cThis is called the Bloody Vessel.\u201d\u201cIt looks like an ominous object.\u201d\u201cBut the effects are potent.\u201dThe man who had been talking in a monotone voice so far now had a sliver of excitement in his voice.\u201cAbsorb this into your body, and you will be able to obtain an enormous amount of power. Then you can pay back your brother who insulted and even tried to kill you, and all his obedient followers!\u201dJoachim stared at the Bloody Vessel. As if the marble was calling to him, it reflected the light from the torch fire and shone temptingly. But the man was not able to get the answer he wanted.\u201cI refuse.\u201d Joachim\u2019s answer was firm, and he did not even hesitate. Under his cloak, the man twitched his eyebrows.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I don\u2019t believe in magical fairies that suddenly help me in my time of need. I\u2019m too old for that.\u201d\u201cAre you hoping that someone will take you out of here? No matter how much you persist, your only fate is execution. Your life is over anyway. Why don\u2019t you try trusting a magical fairy?\u201d\u201cIf a fairy\u2019s gift ends with just killing my life, I would take the chance without a single hesitation, but I don\u2019t know how it will affect the people around me.\u201d Joachim continued, \u201cFrom the first place, it\u2019s already too strange that a fairy would give me this gift. Even in all the stories I read, no fairy is a huge, buff man covered completely in a cloak.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe man looked at Joachim. No, he stared at him. At this very moment, he wanted to break into Joachim\u2019s jail and shake some sense into Joachim. But he couldn\u2019t do that. No, he shouldn\u2019t do that. It was okay to fail in changing other people to Demon People, but not Joachim. In his organization, Joachim was a significant figure in their future plans.\u2018If everything was going according to plan, he would have been so angry at Biyom that he would have taken the Bloody Vessel without hesitation.\u2019Everything was going smoothly in their main headquarters, but their plans in Ospurin went awry. Nobody imagined that Joachim and his task force would stop Igram in such a short period of time. According to the initial plan, Joachim shouldn\u2019t have been able to stop the spread of Igram. And during this time, funds and resources would stop coming from the Dracul estate; thus, Joachim would fall more and more into despair at his inability. At the same time, his anger towards Biyom would grow to an astronomical size\u2014to a point that when someone offered him enough power to commit his revenge, he would take it without reason or additional thought.\u2018But because of that variable, everything has gone to waste!\u2019Whenever the man thought about the unknown variable, Zich, he grew irritated despite his lack of emotions. On the other hand, they had to carry out this plan without fail. His job was to lead people on the \u2018right path\u2019 when things were going amiss.\u201cAre you not concerned that the Dracul estate will collapse at this rate?\u201dJoachim did not reply. But even though his eyes were half-open, there was not a trace of hesitation in them. He looked like an ascetic that didn\u2019t waver in front of any temptations. However, the cloaked man did not easily back down.\u201cYou experienced all sorts of diseases since you were young, even diseases that have never appeared in this world and many of them at once. Didn\u2019t you think that was strange?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, you thought it was weird. However, even after all that, you probably didn\u2019t think it was some sort of conspiracy against you.\u201dEven if lightning struck down every village in the country and burned them all down simultaneously, most people would not think it was a result of a conspiracy. The most they would do was cry out to God in anger, and the reasoning for that was simple\u2014it was because such a natural phenomenon was impossible for humans to perform. No matter how great a person\u2019s master plan was, there was a limit to human ability.\u201cBut what if there was a human who could control infectious diseases however they wanted?\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dEven Joachim was shocked by this. He was about to deny that such a human could exist, but the words did not easily come out of his mouth. As soon as he thought that a human could possess such an ability, everything came into place and made sense.\u201c\u2026Was it you guys?\u201d\u201cNo, not us. We are just providing some small assistance to that person.\u201dThe man was happy that Joachim showed a strong reaction. However, he showed no signs of delight and tried harder to mess up Joachim\u2019s emotions.\u201cIt was your brother who directly collaborated with that human. But really, a power-hungry dictator is a fearsome thing to behold.\u201d The man continued, \u201cJust to kill his younger brother, he decimated so many villages with diseases.\u201dCrunch.When Joachim showed a reaction, the man felt glad; but he hid his feelings again and tried to mess up Joachim\u2019s emotions even more.\u201cYour brother is the one who joined forces with a person like that. A powerful person\u2019s obsession with power is truly scary.\u201d And the man continued, \u201cI mean, he burned down several villages to ashes just for the sake of killing one person: his own younger brother.\u201dCrack!A chilling sound rang out of Joachim\u2019s teeth, but the man continued speaking.\u201cBut you didn\u2019t die like he wanted, so he released the epidemic even in Ospurin. Even a guy blinded by power wasn\u2019t crazy enough to burn his capital city to the ground, so he released a weaker infectious disease such as Igram. And in the meantime, he tried plotting against you, but all his plans were completely ruined by your victory against Igram. In the end, it seems like he decided to use all means possible and finally imprisoned you.\u201dJoachim\u2019s haggard-looking face looked even more drained than before.\u201cHow about it? Are you still not going to change your mind? If Biyom Dracul becomes the Count, the hell you experienced will continue. Since he is a pig who is only greedy for power, the rest of the world will soon join this hell. It\u2019s definite. Are you going to throw away your one and only chance to change reality because of some anxiety?\u201d\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t you say that you helped my brother?\u201d\u201cWe worked out of necessity. It\u2019s not like we are going to be collaborators forever. Besides, the period for us to work with your brother is over.\u201dJoachim stared at the \u2018Bloody Vessel\u2019 that the man was holding. If the man was telling him the truth, this matter would not just end with a power struggle for the Count\u2019s position. The man\u2019s words were difficult to believe, but if Joachim thought about everything he had gone through, they didn\u2019t seem so far-fetched.The man urged him on.\u201cWhat are you going to do? Take it? Or leave it?\u201dIt almost seemed like a snake was darting its forked tongue at him. Joachim\u2019s eyes shook. He thought for a moment and was about to say his decision when\u2014\u201cThat looks like a great item. Could you give me a chance to buy it?\u201dFlinch!The man jumped in surprise. He placed the Bloody Vessel inside his robe and heightened his senses towards the area where he heard the voice. In the entrance, hidden by the darkness, he heard footsteps. A moment later, the owner of these footsteps entered into the torchlight.\u201c\u2026Mr. Zich?\u201d Joachim was surprised to see someone he didn\u2019t expect at all.\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026seem well, sir,\u201d Zich commented cynically after seeing the state Joachim was in.\u201cHow did you\u2026?!\u201d\u201cIt was frustrating to see how everything was progressing, so I forced myself in.\u201d\u201cF-Forced yourself in\u2026?\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like Zich had entered by normal means, and Joachim wondered if Zich had really jumped over the castle\u2019s gates by his own might. Listening to Zich\u2019s way of speaking, it didn\u2019t seem like he used a peaceful method to get in.\u201cSir Joachim, I have a lot to say, but I will have to push my conversation with you a bit later,\u201d Zich said and looked towards the robed man, \u201cI need to speak to someone else first.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you Zich?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m Zich. Are you the leader of the assassins?\u201dThe man\u2019s demeanor, aura, and everything were different from the ordinary assassins Zich had seen. The only similarity he shared with the other assassins was that he wore a dark robe that stuck to his body like his own skin. The robed man didn\u2019t deny Zich\u2019s claims.\u201cIf you are talking about the assassins who ambushed you, yes, you are right. I have greatly troubled you.\u201d\u201cYou are taking words out of my mouth. They dashed towards me continuously like moths to a fire. You should have sent more skilled ones.\u201dA vein popped out of the man\u2019s head, but his robe hid it. The man didn\u2019t show his agitation and replied back flatly, \u201cAre you here to save Joachim?\u201d\u201cI heard that someone was about to fall into a devil\u2019s trap, so I came running,\u201d Zich said.Zich\u2019s eyes pointed at the man\u2019s chest\u2014specifically, the Blood Vessel in its grasp.\u201cBut, you know, I have an interest in that thing called Bloody Vessel. Could you explain it to me too?\u201d\u201cEven if I tell you, you won\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like that. Don\u2019t you have compassion for me who went through all kinds of troubles because of your attacks?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201d\u201cCome on, just tell me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHey.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dZich sighed after seeing the man\u2019s tightly shut mouth.\u201cYour companions weren\u2019t like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d the robed man finally responded.\u201cI saw guys like you at Suol. I realized it then\u2014that you all were going around trying to corrupt people. Let me see\u2026what should I call you guys?\u201dZich stroked his chin and looked like he had just naturally thought of something. \u201cShould I try calling you Demon Maker?\u201dThe man\u2019s eyes turned sharp, but Zich wasn\u2019t bothered.\u201cYeah, Demon Maker sounds good since you are an organization that makes Demon People. And the person you are trying to corrupt into becoming a Demon Person is Sir Joachim over there.\u201dAt the mention of his name, Joachim\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.\u201cI think the first step of your plan was to make him absorb the Bloody Vessel.\u201dZich noticed the robed man\u2019s hands flinch. The man looked like he wanted to fling his fist at Zich in that instance. However, the man endured and didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cTch. It\u2019s annoying to deal with someone so unsociable. The last guy I talked to was a blabbermouth and responded to everything I said.\u201dThe last assassin leader had been someone who Zich could have some fun and \u2018converse\u2019 with, but the assassin leader in front of him right now seemed like he was a different type of person.\u2018I won\u2019t learn much from this guy.\u2019Since things like torture didn\u2019t work on people like them, Zich had to extract information from each and every word they said. Thus, Zich tried to make it his standard to talk as much as he could while fighting these assassins\u2014especially their leaders. However, it seemed as if this man\u2019s personality was naturally reticent.Then, they heard noises from outside the prison. It was the sound of many footsteps. As if the owners of the footsteps were wearing armor, Zich, Joachim, and the assassin heard the loud, chaotic sound of iron clacking against each other. Joachim\u2019s expression darkened while the man\u2019s expression brightened up in contrast. Both of them thought Biyom\u2019s troops were making their way down to the basement.However, that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201cSir Zich!\u201d Hans shouted.\u201cWe have secured the surroundings around this prison.\u201dJoachim and the man\u2019s faces flipped. Zich smiled widely at the man.\u201cWhy is your face like that? As you wanted, I bought you some time with useless conversations. Isn\u2019t this what you wanted?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026!\u201dThe robed man couldn\u2019t find the right words to say.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious why a poor talker like you would grit your teeth and endure my provocations to let me continue. You were probably waiting for your reinforcements to arrive\u2014are you shocked that my reinforcements came instead?\u201d Zich mocked as he continued, \u201cHow was that sweet moment of hope?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cYou bastard!\u201d\u201cYep! That\u2019s it! Humans have to portray their emotions like that!\u201d Zich laughed while watching the man suffer. Even though the cloaked man gritted his teeth, he coldly assessed his situation.\u2018The plan has been completely ruined.\u2019It was even worse because he failed in converting Joachim, out of all people, into a Demon Person. Moreover, he accidentally revealed information about his plan and organization.\u2018He is not an ordinary variable.\u2019The man glared at Zich. Since the man hated extraneous variables, he worked extraordinarily hard in getting rid of Zich. However, even after numerous attacks against him, Zich managed to survive and totally shattered his plans.\u2018Can I kidnap him?\u2019 The man wanted to figure out what more information Zich knew. \u2018Considering the unknown variable\u2019s skills and the skills of his companions, it would be too difficult.\u2019The man felt regretful. As soon as he heard sounds of battle outside, he should have knocked out Joachim and dragged him out. \u2018Trying to capture that extra variable has backfired on me.\u2019 The man initially thought that he could definitely capture Zich if his reinforcements came, so he tried to drag out his time with Joachim. He didn\u2019t think that Zich\u2019s group would be strong enough to reach the castle\u2019s jail.\u2018I guess it can\u2019t be helped. I should first get out of this place.\u2019Since the plan failed, he had to make a report about Zich and how some of their plans got found out.\u201cHey, you! Are you trying to get away?\u201dWith his keen instincts, Zich noticed right away what the man was about to do.The man moved.Clang!The iron bars that locked Joachim broke off with ease. The man jumped into the prison cell; his plan was to use Joachim as a captive to escape.\u201cSnoc!\u201d Zich loudly called out to Snoc. At the same time, the prison shook intensely.Crash!The prison collapsed, and an enormous amount of soil and debris poured out of the prison.\u201cS-sir Joachim!\u201dHans, Snoc, and the knights who supported Joachim all screamed.\u201cSir Zich, w-what are you doing?\u201d Brod, the leader of the knights, fervently protested against Zich. Since he knew one of Zich\u2019s followers, Snoc, had the power to control earth, Brod knew who caused the prison to collapse.\u201cDo not worry. Sir Joachim is fine.\u201d\u201cHe is fine?\u201dShake!The earth shook again; however, the vibration was smaller than last time. Brod\u2019s feet wobbled like waves. Then, as if he was rising from the water surface, Joachim rose from the ground.\u201cSir!\u201d Brod shouted and ran to Joachim. Joachim\u2019s face was dazed as if he could not understand what just happened to him.\u201cAre you injured anywhere!\u201d\u201cAh, no. Fortunately, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m hurt anywhere.\u201dEven though he said this, Joachim touched his body to make sure. However, other than the injury he got from resisting capture (which was starting to swell), he had no other injuries.\u201cGood job, Snoc.\u201d Zich complimented Snoc who was able to perfectly execute his orders. In response, Snoc held Nowem in his arms and smiled in embarrassment. However, it was way too early for him to smile.\u201cSo from now on, do a good job in fighting him.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dCrash!As soon as Snoc\u2019s words faded, the pile of debris and soil exploded.\u201cUgh! Arghh!\u201dRough breathing rang throughout the whole room. A figure broke through the pile of soil and crawled out.\u201c\u2026What is that?\u201d Joachim asked in surprise. However, he was not the only person who was surprised. Almost everyone around him stared at the mysterious monster in front of them.Only Zich was calm.\u201cSir, it\u2019s that man who covered himself with a cloak.\u201d\u201cYou mean that is the cloaked man?\u201d\u201cYes. My hypothesis is that he is using a technique that trades his life span for an intense boost in strength.\u201d\u201cYou are very knowledgeable about this.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I fought a guy that used the same technique as him. Moreover, that man is the leader of the assassins that collaborated with Sir Clovey.\u201d\u201c\u2026As expected, that attack was connected to my elder brother.\u201dEven though he expected it, Joachim was still shocked. How far did his brother\u2019s hands reach? Was power so important to him? Rather than anger, Joachim now felt despondent. However, Zich was skeptical of Joachim\u2019s thoughts.\u201cHmmm. Is Sir Biyom Dracul really the mastermind behind all of this?\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you saying that my brother didn\u2019t instigate all of this?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s first head back up. Since the situation has reached this point, let\u2019s see how this entire situation will end. Then we might be able to find out everything.\u201dEven though Zich seemed like he knew something, it didn\u2019t seem like he was going to reveal it now. Joachim gathered his thoughts and finalized his decision.\u201cThat sounds good. I don\u2019t think this situation will end even if I kneel down and beg my brother. Let\u2019s do it.\u201dBy this time, Joachim\u2019s trust and respect towards Biyom was at rock-bottom; he had no qualms about opposing his older brother now\u2014even if it meant dragging himself into a bloody power struggle that he absolutely detested. There was no other way to end this.\u201cBut let\u2019s first deal with that.\u201d Joachim stared at the monstrous figure in front of him. With a glance, it seemed superfluous to say that their opponent looked tough. However, Zich shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s not an urgent matter, but I guess it\u2019s also not good to spend too much time on that. Let\u2019s quickly head upstairs.\u201d\u201cThen who will take care of that\u2026\u201d\u201cSnoc can take care of him.\u201dSnoc suspected that this was Zich\u2019s plan, but he was still shocked that Zich just dumped the monster on him. His mouth hung open in complete shock.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHowever, Zich just ignored Snoc and urged the rest of the people to leave. People hesitated; they felt uncomfortable leaving such a dangerous monster to a boy who looked like a country bumpkin. But Zich was firm.\u201cSnoc will be enough.\u201dJoachim peered into Zich\u2019s eyes for a moment as if to gauge his true intentions. However, he soon nodded his head.\u201cLet\u2019s head upstairs!\u201dSince Joachim said this, the knights couldn\u2019t say much in protest. In addition, they were running out of time.\u201cI leave it up to you.\u201d After Brod tapped Snoc\u2019s shoulders a few times, he carried Joachim out of the tunnel. A bunch of people followed quickly after him.\u201cHuh? What?\u201dSnoc suddenly had to deal with a ferocious monster, and he watched them leave while trying to grasp the reality of his situation. Hans sent a pitiful glance at him, but he also went ahead. The last person to leave was Zich, and he sent Snoc a bright smile.\u201cSnoc!\u201d\u201cY-Yes, sir!\u201d Snoc\u2019s eyes brightened up. He thought Zich might give him some advice, and he felt relieved that Zich was not going to just leave him to face a monster by himself. Yet, Zich betrayed his trust.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you kill him!\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d Snoc blurted without thinking. However, Zich paid no attention to his panic-stricken voice, and after giving Snoc a thumbs up, he headed outside with the others. The only ones left were Snoc, Nowem, and the monster.\u201c\u2026Krgh!\u201dThe monster gave him a mocking smile, and Snoc glanced at him cautiously.* * *After coming out of the basement stairs, Hans asked Zich, \u201cUm, will this really be alright, sir?\u201d Hans had looked after Snoc as his junior, and he kept looking behind in worry. Joachim and the other knights perked their ears as they had the same doubts.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t leave him carelessly.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that Snoc is stronger than the monster?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dHans\u2019 heart, which had swelled with expectations, shrunk with disappointment at Zich\u2019s sharp response. He also began to feel a bit angry at Zich for leaving Snoc without clarifying anything. Snoc could lose his life.\u201cBut with his current surroundings, it\u2019s a different story altogether.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what kind of a magical beast Nowem is?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the Earth\u2019s\u2026\u201dHans looked around his surroundings. The prison was in the basement, and Joachim was locked inside its deepest corner. In short, the area was connected through the ground.\u2018Now that I think about it, even when we were saving Sir Joachim\u2026\u2019Snoc had made the ceiling crumble and took only Joachim out through the ground, impressing even Hans. Zich saw that Hans had come to a realization and looked to the front again.\u2018Before my regression, when the Earth\u2019s Tyrant stayed inside a mine, nobody wanted to go inside.\u2019In other words, the basement was Nowem\u2019s home ground.Crash!\u2018It started.\u2019* * *\u201cUh, um, uh, what should we do, Nowem?\u201d Snoc clutched onto Nowem tightly, and seeing how frazzled he was, the man smiled in satisfaction of his current situation.\u201cThat fool! Does he think someone like that can stop me?\u201d He laughed at Zich\u2019s decision. It injured his pride that Zich underestimated him, but the man was too faithful to his organization to act just on his ego. With only Snoc left, the situation was ideal for the man who was used to making quick escapes.A conversation was unnecessary. The people who went outside could cast a net around the prison\u2019s surroundings to trap him. It was better the faster he moved since he didn\u2019t know what was happening outside. The man began to move with the intention to escape the prison and leave Snoc as a bloody pulp.Crash!With one push of his feet, the man\u2019s body shot out. It seemed as if a single punch would be enough to smash Snoc, but he quickly realized how wrong he was.Crash! Crash!From the ground, walls, and the ceiling, rock pillars burst out. They were much harder than normal pillars and formed a lattice-like pattern to block the man\u2019s attacks.\u2018What!\u2019Craaaash!The man staggered in surprise, and the ground exploded to spurt out masses of stone pieces. The man quickly jumped to the ceiling, but even that place wasn\u2019t safe.Crack!\u201cUrgh!\u201dStone spears burst out from the ceiling and pierced the man. The man hastily spun his body around to smash the spears, but that was after a couple of them had already pierced his body.Slam!The man increased his distance from Snoc. He had already erased his disregard for Snoc. However, for Snoc who could use the power of the earth, the man was within his point of contact no matter where he ran.\u201cThis person is\u2026\u2019The man immediately heightened his sense of danger, but in contrast, Snoc tilted his head and reassessed his situation.\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as dangerous as I thought?\u2019* * *\u201cCould you explain the current situation to me?\u201d Joachim asked while Brod carried him on his back. Brod answered through clenched teeth, \u201cI was blackmailed.\u201d\u201cBlackmailed?\u201d\u201cEveryone in the castle, whether they were knights or soldiers, was infected with an infectious disease.\u201dJoachim recalled what the robed man had told him.\u201cIt must be true that my brother spread the epidemic.\u201d\u201cYou knew, sir?\u201d\u201cThe robed man from before told me.\u201d\u201cSir, it\u2019s not definite yet. But the person who blackmailed us was Shalom, so it seems that all of this is damn Biyom\u2019s work!\u201dBrod didn\u2019t even attach formalities next to Biyom\u2019s name anymore, and Joachim didn\u2019t blame him. Instead of calling him brother, even Joachim wanted to say all kinds of curses and plaster insults in front of Biyom\u2019s name.\u201cSo, are you saying that you couldn\u2019t help but follow Biyom\u2019s orders?\u201d\u201cYes sir. Some of the others and I tried to resist, but since the majority had gone over to him, we decided to quietly observe the situation with our heads low.\u201dIt sounded like an excuse, but Joachim didn\u2019t blame him.\u201cThen, what happens now?\u201d\u201cSir Zich brought us the cure.\u201dAdmiration filled Brod\u2019s eyes. Joachim realized that Brod, who used to call Zich\u2019s name plainly, was now attaching \u2018Sir\u2019 to Zich\u2019s name and using formalities.\u201cThanks to the cure, we were able to save the knights and the soldiers! Since many of Biyom\u2019s underlings were blackmailed with the disease, we could also make them join us! Now, the only thing left for you to do is to lead them on!\u201dJoachim stared at Zich. His face was full of questions; he didn\u2019t understand how Zich had suddenly gotten hold of a cure to the disease or how Zich had realized that the people in the castle were getting blackmailed. But when Joachim saw Zich wink at him, his doubts disappeared, and he couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u2018I can hear the explanation later.\u2019Joachim saw the castle standing in front of them. They heard swords clashing and people shrieking all over the place.\u201cIf Biyom\u2019s forces have joined us, who are the ones resisting?\u201d\u201cSome of Biyom\u2019s forces still haven\u2019t turned over our side! Even after all this, they\u2019re still following him!\u201dJoachim gritted his teeth after hearing that some people were still willing to fight for someone who purposely spread epidemics around.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Knights and soldiers on Joachim\u2019s side surrounded the inner areas and struggled to break through the inner gate. On the other hand, Biyom\u2019s knights and soldiers were also persistent and resisted inside the narrow gate.\u201cSir Joachim has arrived!\u201d Brod cried out loud. The rest of Joachim\u2019s knights and soldiers also cried out in support. Joachim had already gotten off Brod\u2019s back. Even though his health had never been good and it worsened because of his imprisonment, he tried to conceal his poor condition. He straightened his shoulders and strengthened his posture to the point that Brod\u2019s eyes became filled with admiration.\u201cStop the battle!\u201d Joachim\u2019s voice was not amplified by mana. However, the intense charisma in his voice was enough to reach the people around him. Even the people who did not follow Joachim became filled with admiration. His hatred for power struggles was clearly displayed in front of everyone. Joachim pushed away Brod who tried to support him and walked to the front. The knights and soldiers opened up a path for him, and Joachim stopped right in front of the inner gate. Then he stared at the people who were guarding the gate.\u201c\u2026It has been a while, Sir Carlowen.\u201d\u201cYes, it has been a while, Sir Joachim.\u201dA completely white-haired elderly knight greeted Joachim.\u201cSir Carlowen, if I am not wrong, you seem to be the leader of that group.\u201d\u201cYes, you are right.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t you surrender to us?\u201d Joachim requested.\u201cSir, that will never happen.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m disappointed, Sir Carlowen. Don\u2019t you know that Biyom spread infectious diseases and killed countless people? As an aide for my father, haven\u2019t you worked to provide the best lives for the citizens of this estate in the past? Were your past behaviors all lies?\u201dRather than anger, Joachim felt regretful. As a top aide for Count Dracul, Gloce Carlowen was known to be loyal, moral, and most of all\u2014strong. Joachim had a hard time believing that Carlowen, who was respected and admired by all the Dracul knights, would side with a power-hungry person like Biyom.\u201cBiyom. Biyom. You keep mentioning Biyom.\u201d Carlowem muttered Biyom\u2019s name to himself. His mouth was crooked, and he continued with a cynical tone, \u201cDo you think I\u2014no, we are moving for that fat bastard?\u201dAt his words, his surroundings became noisy. \u2018Fat bastard\u2019\u2014it was not a suitable way to call his master\u2019s son at all. Carlowen\u2019s harsh words shocked the people around him.\u201cAre you saying that you don\u2019t follow Biyom? Then for what reason have you thrown yourself into this battlefield! Please don\u2019t tell me that this is my father\u2019s will.\u201d\u201cHow would I know the will of the dying Count? He\u2019s already half-dead, counting the last of his days. As his son, were you seriously not aware of how severe his condition was?\u201dNo. Joachim could not believe the person in front of him was Carlowem. Regardless of how he addressed Biyom, the Carlowem he knew would never talk about his father like that. All of Joachim\u2019s knights and soldiers were shocked that Carlowem talked as if he was mocking the Count\u2019s condition. They were even more shocked because they assumed that while Carlowem was on their opposing side, his loyalty to the Dracul estate was immutable.\u201c\u2026You have already thrown away your honor and loyalty! How have you fallen so low!\u201d Joachim loudly reprimanded Carlowem. At Joachim\u2019s words, Carlowem\u2019s complexion suddenly changed. The mockery in his face disappeared, leaving only cold bloodthirst.\u201c\u2026Honor? Are you talking about honor, Sir Joachim?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Joachim replied. Carlowem laughed hysterically. His laugh was so loud it sounded as if he was letting out all of his mockery, wrath, and pent-up frustration at once.\u201cSir Carlowem, why are you laughing!\u201d With a beet-red face, Brod shouted at Carlowem. Brod\u2019s heart was in turmoil as he watched someone he had respected all his life mock the person he served.\u201cSir Brod, you are young. You are different from old people like me.\u201dCarlowem\u2019s army was made up of older knights. A significant reason why Joachim had not been able to easily attack the inner gates was because Carlowem\u2019s army had a lot of experience and expertise.\u201cYou don\u2019t have much to lose, and you are filled with confidence. You also want to constantly improve yourself. But most of all, you don\u2019t know anything at all.\u201d\u201cWhat do I not know!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. The plan has already been ruined. We will all probably die here. I don\u2019t even want to continue living. Ask the rest to the person behind us.\u201dAnd with these words, Carlowem pulled out his sword. His action clearly indicated that he no longer wanted to continue this conversation. The atmosphere turned violent and tense again. However, Joachim\u2019s army hesitated to approach the inner gate.A few minutes ago, they were caught in the heat of the battle and pointed their swords at Carlowem and his army, but they used to be on the same side. Moreover, the knights who stood guard in front of the inner gate were all knights that the younger knights greatly respected. It was a difficult battle not only because of the older knights\u2019 skills, but because of the younger knight\u2019s affection towards them. However, they could not continue to stand still.\u201cI will go.\u201dWhen Joachim was about to make an order to attack, Zich stepped up.\u201cSince your soldiers highly respect Carlowem and his army, I think it will be better for me to fight them since I have no connection to them.\u201d\u201cAre you sure? Carlowem is the best knight in our estate.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dAfter Zich relieved Joachim\u2019s concerns, Zich walked towards the elderly knights. Carlowem\u2019s eyes sparkled.\u201cYou were the extra variable that ruined our plans.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really have anything I want to say to you folks.\u201dHe had no information to obtain from them. Zich drew out his sword. Even though Carlowem was the strongest in the Dracul estate, he was nothing compared to the strongest knights in Steelwall such as Tiner and Chris Nunn. Steelwall possessed a military force so mighty that it was dubbed as the Kingdom\u2019s metal fortress. Compared to the knights in Steelwall, the knights in Dracul could not compare. There was an unbridgeable gap between their skills.Tap!Zich jumped past the inner gate. Swords came down to pierce him. All of the older knights\u2019 movements were precise and skilled. As older knights, they had less muscular strength, but their mana control and experiences made them much stronger than younger knights. However, Zich was different. The amount of mana he had was similar or more than the older knights. Moreover, Zich had more muscular strength, and his experience and skills were far superior.Classsh!Zich blocked all of the older knights\u2019 swords that came down upon him like a wave. The older knights\u2019 eyes were filled with surprise. They realized that in terms of strength and skill, Zich was far superior to them. But it did not make sense. Unless he was a person from Steelwall that went to war as often as eating dinner, they should have been the ones who were more experienced and skilled. They couldn\u2019t believe that a young person like Zich who looked as if he had just reached adulthood was more skilled than them. However, that was the hard truth.Clash! Clash! Claaaaash!Although the old knights had blocked parts of the entrance to hinder Joachim\u2019s forces, it was backfiring on them now. Of course, since it was an entrance to a castle, it was much wider than normal, but with his skills and experience, Zich was able to use the entrance\u2019s width to his advantage.\u201cYou bastaaard!\u201dA knight with a completely white mustache dashed towards Zich, but he completely missed his attack. Then, he paid the price for attempting to attack Zich.Crack!\u201cKuaaah!\u201dZich\u2019s sword swirled violently with mana and pierced through the knight\u2019s armor and sliced the knight\u2019s heart. The knight clutched onto his bleeding heart and retreated back. Other knights pointed their swords at Zich to save the knight with the mustache, but Zich\u2019s movements were always one step ahead of them.Push!Zich struck his sword into the mustache knight\u2019s face, and the knight dropped his sword.\u201cYou bastard!\u201dAt their companion\u2019s death, the other old knights burned with rage. Joachim sensed their momentum falling and didn\u2019t miss his chance to strike.\u201cIt\u2019s time! Move forward now!\u201dIt was only one death, but the old knights\u2019 forces\u2019 powers had been chipped. Moreover, Joachim used the mustache knight\u2019s death to actively guide the knights and soldiers.\u201cEven if we became enemies, our opponents are the seniors we admired. Are you going to let them die in another person\u2019s hands?\u201dThe looks on the knights and soldiers\u2019 eyes changed, and they put more strength into their grip while holding onto their weapons.\u2018He is different from Biyom.\u201dCarlowen looked at Joachim. Joachim, the second son of Count Dracul, had managed to erase the hesitation of his knights and soldiers. If he didn\u2019t have such a weak constitution, Joachim would have inherited his father\u2019s place a long time ago.\u2018But it\u2019s useless.\u2019It was too late to think about this now, and Carlowem had to accept his fate and meet his end in peace. Joachim pushed ahead with his forces. Long spears pushed them back and knights pierced their swords in gaps between the old knights\u2019 defenses. The old knights counterattacked with all the strength they had, but in the end, they couldn\u2019t beat their opponent\u2019s numbers.Besides, Zich was also attacking and causing them a huge headache. Thanks to Zich\u2019s lead, Joachim\u2019s forces moved smoothly without blocking each other, and even without receiving direct commands, they naturally followed Zich\u2019s movements.\u2018How is this possible?\u2019 Zich\u2019s movements were so impressive that Carlowem couldn\u2019t help but mutter this to himself.Punch! Slice!Armor collapsed and bodies were sliced. Old knights began to fall to the ground one by one. In the end, even Carlowem\u2019s head rolled to the ground. The gate fell below them.\u201cAdvance!\u201d Joachim shouted, \u201cGo inside and find Biyom Dracul and Besnol Shalom! I will go to the Count!\u201dSoldiers rushed into the castle, and Joachim also went inside with Brod and a couple of other knights. Zich, who had been waiting, joined Joachim, and Hans stuck to his side. They immediately headed towards the Count\u2019s bedroom. The old knights at the castle\u2019s gates had been the main ones resisting Joachim\u2019s army, so nobody else in the castle blocked their paths.They jumped down the stairs and crossed through the hallway. A fancy room soon appeared.Bam!Brod kicked the room\u2019s door open. The hinge broke off, and the door crumpled and rolled to the ground. They were able to see the room in full view. In contrast to the chaotic situation inside the castle, the Count\u2019s room was peaceful and calm. It was fancy and clean as usual, and on top of the bed, the Count lay there with his eyes closed. His complexion looked poor, but he was still alive. People sighed in relief at the sight. But when they saw another figure appear behind the bed, they heightened their guard.\u201c\u2026You arrived in the end.\u201d\u201cShalom\u2026!\u201dJoachim got off Brod\u2019s back and glared.\u201cYes, Sir Joachim. Seeing that you are here, it seems that the stupid robed man failed. He kept going on about corrupting people and all that, but I guess he was just all talk.\u201d\u201c\u2026Where is my brother?\u201d\u201cDo you still have some affection for him after going through so much? That\u2019s some touching brotherly love. Even the pigs at the barns would admire you for it.\u201dShalom\u2019s mocking speech wasn\u2019t like that of a person who worked under Biyom.\u201cCarlowem told me you guys don\u2019t follow my brother. It seems you are like him and his comrades.\u201d\u201c\u2026What happened to Carlowem and the others?\u201d\u201cWe killed them.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so? They are all dead?\u201dShalom expressed a bit of sadness. It was a completely different reaction than the one he had shown while talking about the Count and his family. However, that didn\u2019t last long.\u201c\u2026I was caught up in my emotions for a moment. Did you say you wanted to know where Biyom Dracul is? There\u2019s no reason why I shouldn\u2019t tell you.\u201dShalom arched his back and reached his hand to the back of the bed. He moved his hands roughly like he was dealing with a piece of meat and dragged something out. What came out of his grasp was a human\u2014but it was not a human in normal condition.Zich and Joachim\u2019s task force had seen a person in a state like that before. Patients infected by severe infectious diseases in the villages they visited had looked like him.\u201cHe is here. Why don\u2019t you greet him?\u201d\u201cUh, ooh, uhhhhhhh\u2026.\u201d Biyom moaned lightly; because of the intense pain he felt, he couldn\u2019t even properly moan and left his viewers in shock.\u201c\u2026Brother?\u201d\u201cYes. This is your brother.\u201dShalom hit Biyom with the edge of his feet. Biyom spluttered like a fish taking its last breath after having been dragged out of the water. Someone had spread the infectious disease inside the castle; Joachim thought that the culprit was Biyom. However, after hearing the old knight\u2019s words and seeing the situation in front of him, he realized the truth.\u201cIt was you, Shalom! You were the mastermind behind everything!\u201d\u201cYou realized it too late, Sir Joachim.\u201dShalom admitted to Joachim\u2019s words coldly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though he personally thought Biyom was trash, he still respected Biyom as one of the Count\u2019s family. He thought Biyom shouldn\u2019t be discarded and treated like some kind of diseased animal.\u201cHmmm, you call me shameless.\u201dShalom smiled mockingly just like the older knights in front of the inner gate.\u201c\u2026Are you really responsible for spreading the diseases?\u201d Joachim asked carefully.\u201cYeah. I spread it.\u201d\u201cFor what reason?\u201d\u201cFor judgment!\u201dLike a lord making a stern judgment, Shalom said this with gravity and assurance. And from this, Zich found the answer to one of his most pressing questions.\u2018Ah, that guy is not Fest.\u2019The Fest he was familiar with would not say something like that.\u2018Now, there\u2019s only one suspect left.\u2019While Zich calmly made deductions about Fest\u2019s identity, the conversation between Shalom and Joachim continued.\u201cWhat do you mean by judgment? Your words are absurd. If you are so great that you can make judgments, who are you judging in this situation? Is it my family?\u201d\u201cYes. I have a lot of people in mind, but the first group that I have to judge the most harshly and cruelly is you and your family. It is my greatest regret that I left you to that robed man. I should have also judged you with my own hands.\u201d\u2018Also?\u2019 Joachim repeated Shalom\u2019s words inside his mind. Since Shalom said \u2018also,\u2019 there must be other people who he wanted to pass judgments on; Biyom was obviously included in this group of people, but Joachim felt that Shalom meant something else. An awful thought emerged from his mind.\u201cWait, was the reason why my father fell ill\u2014!\u201dShalom laughed out loud. His laugh was cruel and evil. \u201cYep. I did that.\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201dJoachim\u2019s efforts to remain calm went up in smoke. His wrath erupted forth and it was so intense that it felt almost tangible.\u201cIt was really difficult to turn your father into this state. Unlike weak asses like you and your brother, the Count was a really strong person. His natural resistance against diseases is unbelievable. But whatever, I was successful in turning him into this pitiful state.\u201d\u201cWhy! My father was the one who let you work as a butler when you couldn\u2019t work as a knight anymore! How can you pay back his generosity with revenge! Bastards like you are\u2014!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Shalom\u2019s shout rang throughout the house. \u201cGenerosity? You say generosity? Your father forcefully held me captive as a butler! How can I feel thankful to this asshole!\u201d\u201cHe held you captive?\u201d\u201cYes! He held me captive! As his accomplice, he wanted to spy on me and keep me in check so that I wouldn\u2019t spout out his secret!\u201dAn accomplice. It was definitely not a positive word. Considering what Shalom previously said about making judgments, Joachim became more confused about the situation.\u201c\u2026What the hell happened?\u201d\u201cHeh! Are you curious? Fine. Since the situation has turned to shit, I will tell you what happened. Do you remember how infectious diseases spread around this estate ten years ago?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah, I remember.\u201dInfectious diseases were not calamities that appeared once every hundred years. They were common occurrences and spread quickly among people. However, Joachim remembered that the infectious disease that spread ten years ago was particularly dreadful.Shalom pointed his fingers at the unconscious Count.\u201cAt that time, this guy employed all efforts to stop the spread of the disease. Many people died as a result, but his tactics showed some favorable results. However, the estate also suffered a heavy financial loss.\u201dSince many of the populace died, the amount of available human labor and taxes greatly decreased. At the same time, the Count\u2019s efforts to stop the spread of the disease caused a serious dent in the estate\u2019s finances. As a result, the estate possessed a massive amount of debt. Even though they were able to stop the disease, there was an intense 'side-effect.\u201d\u201cI know that as well. However, my father did an excellent job in overcoming this dilemma.\u201d\u201cExcellent? Overcome?\u201dShalom\u2019s face twisted like a demon. He looked as if he wanted to pull out Joachim\u2019s tongue and stuff it back inside his mouth to stop him from talking.\u201cYou spout nonsense because you don\u2019t know anything! In order to save the estate\u2019s finances, your father screwed over a whole lot of people!\u201d His shout carried tremendous pain. \u201cThe disease that spread ten years ago was Horim!\u201dHorim\u2014out of the known diseases in the world, it was renowned for being deadly and ferocious. Out of all the diseases, it competed at the very top places with other dangerous diseases in fatalities and transmission rates. Horim was called a devil\u2019s curse because it not only completely destroyed people but animals as well.\u201cBecause your father was pressured by his piling debts, he secretly collected the corpses of infected animals. And then he spread it around the places that he owed money to!\u201d Unimaginable words came out of Shalom\u2019s mouth. People\u2019s faces became pale. A shiver ran down their backs, and their hearts thumped fiercely. But most of all, Joachim\u2019s face was as white as a corpse.Shalom continued, \u201cThen, of course, Horim appeared a second time to plague the people around us! And the new cases concentrated in places that your father owed money to. Places that trusted your father and his estates to pay their money back to! And as expected, the great amount of debt your father owed disappeared, and the estate was able to escape its dangerous financial situation.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lie! If places that my father owed debts to were the only ones to get plagued by the disease again, everyone would have definitely become suspicious of my father!\u201d\u201cIt was because your father secretly borrowed money while accepting the high interest! While borrowing the money, he made excuses like he did not want to discredit the estate anymore!\u201d\u201cThe people who lent him money didn\u2019t even leave a promissory note?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know that places infected by Horim are burned completely to the ground! Everything has to be burned! Even the building with the promissory notes was burned to the ground!\u201dJoachim could no longer talk.\u201cAnd as you said, your father is not stupid. He also spread Horim to other areas besides the places he owed money to\u2014in places that would not affect the estate if they completely disappeared. At this point, people just thought they were experiencing a second wave of Horim. No one thought that someone would purposely release it again.\u201dAccording to Joachim\u2019s memory, he recalled that Horim significantly disappeared at one point and then rose up again a second time.\u201cOf course, not everyone died. Some people were not infected by Horim, and there were also some places that still had their promissory notes. The Count was very good at repaying the few people who were left. However, the estate was stable because a lot of the debt was gone. And most of all, it was because the place that the Count owed the most debt to collapsed.\u201dAt this point, Shalom\u2019s bloodlust rose a level higher.\u201cThe Bargot Business.\u201dPeople held their breath. They remembered Greta Bargot\u2019s great efforts to contain the epidemic.\u2018Is he saying that the Bargot Trading House collapsed because of that old man lying on the bed?\u2019Zich stared at Count Dracul.\u201cDo you know what\u2019s funnier? The Bargots lent their money out of the kindness of their hearts, unlike places that did it for their personal gains or to obtain interest from the money they lent. The Bargots said that since they started their business at the Dracul estate, they wanted to get involved and help as much as possible.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d Joachim denied Shalom\u2019s claims.He didn\u2019t want to believe his father\u2019s faults, which he had never even heard of before. Yet, Shalom relentlessly crushed Joachim\u2019s hopes by continuing, \u201cWho do you think carried out his orders? Do you really not understand why the Count forced me to become the butler of this household and why all the older knights took my side?!\u201d\u201c\u2026You guys are the people who executed my father\u2019s plans.\u201d\u201cOnly people with tight lips and high resistance to diseases could move the corpses of people and animals who died from the epidemic. At that time, I thought that his orders were what was best for the Count, the people, and this estate. And above all, I was still caught up in the delusion that a knight had to always be loyal to their lord at all times.\u201dA delusion\u2014that\u2019s how Shalom described the loyalty that a knight should have for their lord.\u201cI was young, foolish, and ignorant. I was so beyond help that I can\u2019t describe myself with all the insults in the world. But insulting myself doesn\u2019t erase my past actions, so I thought\u2026I should atone for my sins by placing you all under my judgment!\u201d\u201cAnd with that mindset, you decided to spread infectious diseases to multiple villages and kill numerous people?\u201d Zich spat out his words and mocked Shalom who was self-justifying his actions.\u201cAnd what is the problem with that? They were foolish people who pledged loyalty to Count Dracul without knowing anything! They should also know the pain of those who died and suffered for the sake of their land!\u201d\u2018Man, this guy is completely out of his mind.\u2019 Zich had seen many different types of revenge, but not all of them were alike. There was revenge that was only aimed at the person who harmed them, and there was revenge that stretched its vengeance to the offenders\u2019 family members and everyone who had a relationship with them. Likewise, there were also many different types of methods to complete an act of revenge. Some didn\u2019t want to stoop to the level of their offender and tried to minimize the impact their revenge had on others as much as possible. On the other hand, there were some who thought nothing mattered as long as they completed their revenge and didn\u2019t mind inflicting harm everywhere.In general, if the revenge-seeker didn\u2019t care how their actions negatively impacted innocent bystanders and the more people they involved in their plotting, there was a higher chance that the individual was out of their mind. In that aspect, Shalom was someone who had completely lost his mind. Thus, Joachim, who was shocked at the things his father committed, burned with rage again.\u201cEven if you resent my father, that\u2019s no excuse for killing so many innocent lives! Did you not even consider their pain?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hilarious how the son of Count Dracul is telling me this! Your father\u2019s actions were the cause of everything!\u201d\u2018Oh, his ability to blame others is first-class.\u2019Shalom\u2019s firmness and senseless belief that he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong impressed Zich. However, he was only impressed by this, and Zich didn\u2019t take Shalom\u2019s side. Moreover, Shalom had one-sidedly agitated Zich before.\u2018He probably was worried that his plans were going to fall apart from the cure I spread.\u2019But whatever Shalom\u2019s intentions were, the important part to Zich was that Shalom had tried to provoke him before.\u201cSo, you are saying that you caused this whole situation, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Shalom responded simply to Zich\u2019s question and glared at him. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t intervened, I would\u2019ve gotten my revenge without any trouble! Even the robed guy was right about this\u2014I should have killed you first!\u201d\u2018The one who tried to kill me with everything he had was the robed guy.\u2019 But even after Zich learned of this fact, it didn\u2019t change anything. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. But what can you do when your abilities don\u2019t match up?\u201dShalom gritted his teeth, but he couldn\u2019t retort. Even though he had planned everything out with so much pain, time, and care, his plan had failed in the end.\u201cWas it also you who cured the knights and the soldiers in the castle?\u201d\u201cYep, that\u2019s right. It wasn\u2019t a serious disease, so even an amateur like me could fix it.\u201dZich\u2019s comment seemed to jab at Shalom\u2019s pride, and Shalom\u2019s face reddened with rage. His huffing and puffing rang inside the whole room. However, he didn\u2019t explode with wrath. \u201c\u2026I will admit it. I misjudged your skills. I shouldn\u2019t have thought that as long as I captured Greta Bargot, you wouldn\u2019t hinder me from spreading diseases any longer.\u201d\u201cSo, you took Ms. Bargot for that reason,\u201d Joachim said.\u201cI thought it was better to have fewer obstacles while I tried to spread infectious diseases. Even I was surprised by the amount of knowledge that Ms. Bargot had. I didn\u2019t expect someone from the Bargot Business to be my biggest obstacle.\u201d\u201cWhere is she?\u201d\u201cFind her by yourself.\u201d Shalom replied curtly and sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity, such a pity. There are still so many people left who I have to pass my judgments onto. I can\u2019t believe I have to be satisfied with bringing judgment to only the Count and his eldest son.\u201d\u201cYou bastard! Immediately release the Count and Biyom!\u201dThe reality was separate from the truth, and Brod stepped forward and shouted to save the two.\u201cTake them as you wish. It\u2019s too late to save them anyway. They will die in pain in their miserable states. No matter how superb Zich\u2019s medical abilities may be, he can\u2019t cure this disease.\u201dShalom made a dark smile, and his viewers could see how refreshed and happy he felt. Shalom\u2019s hatred for the Count was unmistakably real.\u201cI have devoted so much care and time to this disease. Regardless of how great a person may be, this disease\u2014\u201d\u201cYou talk a lot for someone who didn\u2019t even create the disease.\u201dShalom was going on and on as if he wanted to boast, but Zich cut him off.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhy are you desperate to brag about a disease that you didn\u2019t even make?\u201dShalom\u2019s face crumpled. \u201cWhat non\u2014\u201d\u201cSir!\u201d Before Shalom exploded in anger, a soldier burst into the room. \u201cWe found Ms. Bargot inside the prayer room!\u201dEveryone\u2019s faces brightened. Since she had played a huge role in calming the situation with Igram, Joachim had placed the matter of protecting her as first priority. On top of that, people felt sympathy and guilt after hearing about what had happened to Bargot Trading House. Thus, people rejoiced as if they had found their own family member. However, Zich\u2019s reaction was different.\u201cBlock the prayer room, and nobody must approach her.\u201d At Zich\u2019s unexpected command, everyone\u2019s eyes shot towards his direction. \u201cThe one who spread the infectious diseases isn\u2019t the butler over there.\u201dZich smiled at Shalom who was looking at him with wide eyes.\u201cShe\u2014Greta Bargot is probably the culprit.\u201dEveryone in the room froze at once.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was not because he couldn\u2019t hear what Zich said. It was because he couldn\u2019t believe Zich\u2019s words. However, since Joachim asked this question, Zich made the effort to repeat his previous statement.\u201cI said, there\u2019s a high possibility that Ms. Bargot is the one who spread the infectious diseases this time around.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPeople had their mouths closed. Their eyes were full of disbelief as they stared at Zich. For everyone in the room, Zich\u2019s words were beyond shocking. Out of all the people, only Hans maintained enough composure to think that despite his shock, he should first try listening to Zich.\u201cStupid fool! You aren\u2019t able to differentiate between reality and imagination anymore! Because you found the cure, you think you can just go around spouting nonsense?\u201d Shalom mocked Zich. \u201cIf that\u2019s not it, do you want to get all the credit for putting an end to Igram? You acted as if you didn\u2019t need any recognition, but I guess you are a shallow person after all. As expected of someone on the Dracul family\u2019s side. You guys go very well together.\u201d\u201cWhy are you being so defensive?\u201d Zich calmly replied to Shalom\u2019s mockery. \u201cYou act as if you have to be the one at fault.\u201dShalom\u2019s face stiffened. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m the one who is the judge. Do you think I will be happy if someone contradicts me!\u201d\u201cSo even if you get killed, you swear on your life that you were the one who invented and spread the infectious disease around this estate?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThen can you tell me how you invented it? Ah, you don\u2019t have to give me a specific explanation. You can just give me a basic outline or theory.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shalom did not reply.\u201cWhat happened? Try saying anything. I told you\u2014if your words make sense, I will believe you. Ah, did you find the information in a book like me? Then I guess it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d Zich smirked while recalling his past events.\u201c\u2026Then is it really true\u2026\u201d Joachim murmured to himself. Other people also began to realize that Shalom did not know much about infectious diseases.\u201c\u2026Fine. I admit it. I just used the diseases that the robed man gave me. But I was the one who judged\u2014\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t it strange?\u201d Zich cut off Shalom\u2019s words again. Like a cat cornering a mouse, Zich slowly drove Shalom into a wall.\u201cAren\u2019t you siding with Ms. Bargot too much? If you acted like you usually did, instead of just telling me that you got it from the robed man, you would have laughed at my face and told me it was my choice whether or not I believed your words.\u201dZich seemed like he was enjoying the situation. No, he was definitely enjoying it. Hans shook his head as he saw that Zich\u2019s sadistic personality had emerged again. However, Hans remained focused on Zich. When Zich was like this, he was as keen as he was demeaning.\u201cI don\u2019t think you are reacting like this out of guilt because whenever it comes to Ms. Bargot, you draw a firm line. Whenever we searched for Ms. Bargot, you just told us to find her by ourselves. But if you were acting this whole time, the entire story completely changes.\u201d Zich\u2019s eyes glistened. \u201cYou guys are working together, and the final plan was for you to take the fall. Then, Ms. Bargot would live on and continue her work. Since Ms. Bargot was the one who invented the infectious diseases in the first place, the judgment you are so proud of will continue.\u201d\u201cNonsense.\u201dShalom\u2019s acting was levels above Clovey\u2019s amateur acting. His denial was clean and simple. He really looked as if he was not related to Ms. Bargot at all. However, Zich was not convinced.\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter. I can find out whether or not Ms. Bargot is the one who spread the diseases after I kill you and get more information out of her. If I\u2019m wrong, then I\u2019m wrong. Don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t torture her. As you can tell, I\u2019m good at shaking up people\u2019s mental states and forcing information out of them.\u201d With an exaggerated movement, Zich moved his thumb. \u201cIf you really have no ties with Ms. Bargot, it doesn\u2019t matter, but if word gets out that you actually do, I don\u2019t know what will happen to her. Maybe she will\u2026\u201d Zich did not finish his sentence. It was not because he didn\u2019t know what would probably happen. But he wanted to leave the rest up to Shalom\u2019s imagination so that Shalom could imagine the worst-case scenario. Zich laughed, and from his parted lips, his sharp canines glistened in the light.\u201cI\u2019m sure that a lot of people who want revenge like you will appear. And like you, they wouldn\u2019t want the perpetrator to get an easy death. So\u2026\u201d Zich snapped his fingers as if he just realized something. \u201cI think I will be the first in line. Ever since I arrived at the estate, I suffered a lot because of the infectious diseases.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shalom did not reply. It was impossible to know whether it was because he really had no ties with Ms. Bargot or if it was because of a different reason. He continued to stare at Zich in silence.\u201cLet\u2019s end this.\u201d Zich fixed his grip on the sword\u2019s handle and headed towards Shalom. The knights looked at each other and then nodded. They followed Zich\u2019s back; for now, they decided to support him.\u201cFirst of all, if you don\u2019t need them, why don\u2019t you return the Count and his son? And why don\u2019t you try your best to give us a good show? You must not have any regrets since you were able to fulfill a bit of your revenge. And you have nothing more to worry about,\u201d Zich said while taking one step further. \u201cSince you have no ties with Ms. Bargot at all.\u201dCrunch!Shalom gritted his teeth and made his move simultaneously. He took out a hidden sword behind the back of the bed and began wielding it around.Crassssh!Two swords infused with mana crashed into each other and sharp sounds filled the whole room. Zich smirked as he blocked Shalom\u2019s sword.\u201cHuh? What\u2019s up with you? Your face looks so serious. It\u2019s as if I just pointed out your weakness.\u201dShalom did not reply. He moved his feet and kicked the bed next to him.Swish!Shalom infused mana into his kick, so the bed easily went up and flew towards Zich. Even though it was a feeble attempt to cover Zich\u2019s sight for a second, the Count was still on the bed.\u201cFather!\u201d Joachim cried out, and the knights moved. However, Zich paid no attention to the Count.\u2018I\u2019m sure the knights can take care of that.\u2019They weren\u2019t people who couldn\u2019t catch one person from falling.Crack!Zich flung the whole bed that was covering his view to the side. Still, since the person lying on the bed was Joachim\u2019s father, Zich controlled his strength to not injure the Count. When his view cleared up, Zich saw Shalom. Shalom was squeezing his body inside the floor where the bed used to be.\u2018It\u2019s a secret passageway.\u2019There was a secret passageway underneath the Count\u2019s bed. It wasn\u2019t anything unusual, and Shalom had probably learned of its existence while acting as the butler. Zich stabbed the air with his sword and used the skill, \u2018Piercing Space.\u2019 Sharp air mixed with mana shot out of the sword\u2019s sides, but Shalom was hidden in the secret passage.Yet, the attack wasn\u2019t aimed at Shalom\u2019s body but the floor surrounding the passage.Whoosh!The air struck the floor, and Zich could hear Shalom\u2019s screams. \u201cUrgh!\u201dZich\u2019s piercing attack had penetrated the floor and pierced Shalom. Shalom received a significant injury, and a little bit of blood splattered outside the passage. However, it didn\u2019t completely finish him off and Shalom moved deeper into the passageway.\u2018Hmm, he\u2019s better than I expected.\u2019Before he became a butler, Zich heard that Shalom had been a skilled knight, and it seemed as if that was true. Shalom was faster than most low-level knights even while limping.\u2018He probably didn\u2019t slack off in his training even after his injury.\u2019\u201cDid you lose him?\u201d Joachim asked while taking care of the Count.\u201cRather than losing him, I didn\u2019t chase after him.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cShalom probably went to Ms. Bargot anyway. You said that Ms. Bargot was in the prayer room, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. I think everything will end there.\u201d Zich\u2019s gaze moved towards Joachim, and Joachim looked at the Count on the ground and the secret passageway that Shalom had escaped out of. Then, with a determined look, Joachim nodded.* * *While leaving a part of their army, they headed to the prayer room. Joachim was among the group who moved to the prayer room as Brod carried him on his back; Joachim\u2019s complexion didn\u2019t look too great, and it seemed as if he was shaken by Shalom\u2019s revelation about his father. But because of their current situation, Joachim didn\u2019t fall into a deep state of concern or guilt. He didn\u2019t have time for it.\u201cSir Zich.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhy do you suspect Ms. Bargot?\u201dEveryone including Hans and Brod perked their ears at Joachim\u2019s question.\u2018I suspected that she might have been Fest from the beginning.\u2019It was either her or Shalom. However, from what Zich knew about Fest\u2019s character, Shalom didn\u2019t match the description. Thus, he naturally placed Ms. Bargot as the most likely suspect. This was the truth that only Zich knew. But Zich and Ms. Bargot had stayed very close together for a while to the point that rumors about their relationship had spread, so others couldn\u2019t understand Zich\u2019s reasoning.\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Zich lied casually.\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cYes. I just got a strange feeling while hearing Shalom talk. Since he kept talking about judgments, he must have felt a great amount of guilt. So, it didn\u2019t make sense for him to treat Ms. Bargot, the representative of the victims of his actions, as someone unrelated to his plans. It didn\u2019t fit somehow.\u201d\u201cThat is true.\u201d\u201cI felt like he was drawing a line between him and her more than necessary. Of course, I couldn\u2019t be certain with just that. As he said, it could also be that he was really trying to prevent her from meddling in his plan. In order to find out the truth, I pressured him a bit, and he took the bait.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a complete lie. He had pressured Shalom to tell the truth, and Shalom conveniently fell into his trap.\u201c\u2026How were you able to think that far in that short amount of time?\u201d\u201cSir, you can also do it too if you gather up some more experience.\u201d Zich winked, and Joachim laughed spiritlessly. Zich said that it was possible for him if he gained more experience, but there wasn\u2019t much of an age difference between Zich and Joachim.\u2018Is this what you call feeling hopeless or having an inferiority complex?\u2019 It was an unfamiliar feeling. Joachim could understand a bit of how Biyom might have felt towards him now and sighed. It did not take long for them to arrive at the prayer room. Soldiers who should have been guarding the door were scattered around with their heads missing. The expressions on people\u2019s faces stiffened, and they ran to the prayer room.\u201cSo, we have to immediately\u2026!\u201d Like he was throwing up blood\u2014no, while he was actually throwing up blood, Shalom shouted, but his voice quickly broke off. Then, he slowly turned his body.\u201c\u2026You came.\u201dWhile clutching his injured heart, he stared towards Zich and his companions bleakly. Behind them, a familiar figure stood below a huge, holy relic hanging on the wall. The woman was wearing all black like usual, and while facing the relic, she turned her body like she was praying. The fabric covering her face slightly fluttered due to her movements.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Ms. Bargot.\u201d Zich waved his hands, and she smiled in response.\u201cYes, it\u2019s been a while, Mr. Zich. How have you been?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t rest well because so many things happened. Worried about the state of the world, I even had trouble sleeping. As a result, my skin worsened.\u201dHans\u2019 expression was a sight to see as he watched Zich feign his pain. However, Ms. Bargot brought her hands to her lips like she was genuinely concerned about Zich.\u201cOh my. Like I told you before, lack of sleep is not good for your health. Should I prescribe you a sleeping pill?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s an appealing offer, but I will refuse it. If I eat your sleeping pill, I think I won\u2019t be able to wake up ever again.\u201d\u201cHow unfortunate.\u201d Ms. Bargot smiled. \u201cI was confident in the pill\u2019s effect, whether it was for sleeping or making you never wake up again.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ms. Bargot\u2019s face was beautiful, her eyes innocent and pure, and her voice was calm like still water. However, her words were frightening as if she poured ice water down their backs.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. My mom told me to not eat random things from strangers.\u201d\u201cOh my, are you calling me a stranger? I\u2019m disappointed. We were in such a passionate relationship. Were you just playing around with me?\u201dMs. Bargot pretended to wipe her tears. Whatever a beauty did became picturesque. Moreover, when a person as beautiful as Ms. Bargot wiped her eyes so pitifully, most people would have felt their hearts stir. However, not a single person pitied Ms. Bargot. On the other hand, they looked at her as if she was a monster, and there were some people who were sweating in fear.\u201cA passionate relationship\u2026yeah, it was really passionate. To get information out of me, we both pretended to be in a relationship.\u201dWhile people thought a romantic atmosphere was blossoming between Ms. Bargot and Zich, they were both merely gauging and spying on each other the whole time.\u201cHave I been found out?\u201d Ms. Bargot stuck out her tongue as if she made a clumsy mistake. However, no one thought she was acting cute. \u201cBecause I put so much effort into spreading Igram around Ospurin, imagine my surprise when a random person just popped out of nowhere and found a cure for it. Of course, I would be curious about the person who found the cure.\u201d\u201cDid I meet your expectations?\u201d\u201cNo, not at all. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014you are definitely a handsome and charming man. Even though your personality doesn\u2019t seem all too great, I guess that can also be a part of your charisma. But your medical knowledge is barely above an amateur, and you are not the great person I expected. So I was a bit shocked\u2014\u201d Ms. Bargot talked softly as if she was talking to a lover, but then her voice turned sharp. \u201cWhen you also found the cure for Galdurim.\u201d\u201cI guess Galdurim is the name of the disease that infected the knights and soldiers.\u201d\u201cI worked pretty hard on that disease. It\u2019s easy to control, and when you are infected, it\u2019s extremely fatal. Moreover, you experience intense pain, but your physical abilities exponentially increase for a short period of time.\u201d\u201cYou made that disease to control people like your underlings.\u201d\u201cWow! Your brain works fast! I shouldn\u2019t have been relieved after finding out that your medical knowledge was subpar. What is actually dangerous about you is your keen sense and sharp judgment.\u201dTo be honest, Zich\u2019s memories from his past life helped him out a lot, but he didn\u2019t feel the need to reveal this information when he was trying to uncover the truth. Moreover, it was true that Zich had keen senses and sharp judgment.Ms. Bargot asked, \u201cHow did you know that the military force in Ospurin was ill?\u201d\u201cOn the day your group tried to kill me, you spread Galdurim to the villagers. Isn\u2019t it suspicious that a rare disease suddenly appeared in a random village, and assassins with that drug appeared at the same time? It was most definitely planned. So I could deduce that the disease was probably manmade.\u201dZich was great at making up stories. While completely leaving out information about his knowledge from his past life, Zich continued to spout believable lies with some truths mixed in.\u201cFrom then on, I began to grow suspicious of everyone around me. After Joachim went back to the castle, I maintained contact with his knights and subordinates. But at one point, they suddenly began to treat me strangely. This is just my advice, but you can\u2019t expect good acting from Clovey or the knights in general. When they lie, it\u2019s very easy for me to tell.\u201d\u201cThank you for your advice.\u201dMs. Bargot glared at Shalom. It seemed as if he was in charge of leading and training the knights. His injured face, which had been twisted in pain, now looked guilty and apologetic.\u201cIn order to completely control the villages, you were the one who gave the medicine to the villagers, right?\u201d Zich smiled brightly.\u201cYou are really impressive.\u201d Ms. Bargot lifted both of her hands up as if she was surrendering. \u201cIt must have been very hard to analyze the medicine with the extent of your medical knowledge. Did you completely trick me? Or if not, did you receive help from that book again?\u201dMs. Bargot\u2019s tone indicated that she did not really believe he found the cure for Igram from a book. But Zich merely shrugged his shoulders.\u201cWhat a sneaky person.\u201d Ms. Bargot stared at Zich with disdain. \u201cFine. Then the next thing I want to know is\u2026\u201d\u201cMs. Bargot!\u201dWhen Ms. Bargot was about to ask another question, a loud shout cut her off. She frowned in annoyance.\u201cSir Shalom, don\u2019t you see that I\u2019m trying to have a conversation?\u201d With a displeased tone, Ms. Bargot reprimanded Shalom. However, Shalom shouted again.\u201cYou have to run away right now! Their reinforcements are going to arrive here at any moment!\u201dTrue to his words, more soldiers and knights came outside the prayer room. After finishing up their work in other areas, more people were gathering around in this room. As expected, they felt ill will towards Shalom and Ms. Bargot who had spread infectious diseases around, and their eyes looked murderous. However, that was the reaction from people who did not know the full story. Joachim and a few of the soldiers who heard the full story from Shalom had more complicated looks on their faces.\u201cSir, let\u2019s first recall the soldiers.\u201d Brod quietly approached Joachim and spoke to him. \u201cMore of the Count\u2019s story might be revealed. It\u2019s better for this to not get out.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that we should hide this matter?\u201d Joachim\u2019s voice was full of disdain, but Brod shook his head. Since Joachim was intelligent, he probably knew why Brod wanted to limit the number of people who knew about the Count\u2019s past. Out of his kindness and guilt, Joachim was just complaining a bit. But it was also Brod\u2019s duty as Joachim\u2019s advisor to correct his words and guide him to the right path.\u201cSir, it will be better for you to have the choice to reveal or not reveal information about the Count. Moreover, we don\u2019t know if Shalom\u2019s words are true. Unnecessary misunderstandings might arise.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBrod\u2019s words were reasonable. Other than the people who had already heard about the Count\u2019s heinous actions, Joachim ordered everyone else to get out of the prayer room. Then he firmly closed the door shut. Since the prayer room\u2019s door had been thickly built to block out all additional sounds, there was very little concern that sound would seep out of this room. And while this was happening, Shalom was urging Ms. Bargot to escape.\u2018Is that the escape door?\u2019Zich\u2019s eyes headed towards a small hole in the wall across from him. That hole was probably the entrance of a secret passageway in the castle. Shalom probably used that secret passageway to go through the Count\u2019s room and into the prayer room.Brod made another suggestion. \u201cSir, why don\u2019t you first capture those two? No matter what their reasons were, they harmed the Count and brought chaos and destruction throughout the whole estate. After we capture them, let\u2019s discuss how to deal with them.\u201d\u201cYou bastards! Do you think that I would just watch!\u201d Shalom stepped forward. Blood dripped out of his wounds, and because he didn\u2019t even have time to get potions for himself, he bound his pierced chest with ripped pieces of cloth. Joachim, who suffered from hemophobia, took a step backward.\u201cMs. Bargot! I will buy some time, so please run away!\u201d Shalom gathered up his mana and a formidable energy poured out of his body. But whatever he did, it didn\u2019t change the fact that he was just a bygone who had retired long ago from an injury.Claash!Zich came out to fight him, and his sword battered Shalom\u2019s sword.\u201cUrgh!\u201dUnlike Shalom, Zich\u2019s legs were both able, and he could sustain the might of his own youthful power and strength. Just that would have been enough to push Shalom back, but the old knight\u2019s body was also wounded all over. Shalom couldn\u2019t have been more at a disadvantage than he currently was.\u201cHaaaaaaah!\u201d Shalom shouted loud enough to shred his throat and struck a blow with all of his power. In his youth, it could have been a terrifying attack to crush his opponent. However, his current attack couldn\u2019t even scratch Zich.Punch!\u201cKugh!\u201dZich\u2019s kick landed on his stomach, and Shalom collapsed onto the floor. But Shalom didn\u2019t let go of his sword.\u201cNo\u2026you can\u2019t\u2026\u201dBlood kept leaking out of the hole in his chest and strained his ability to breathe. Yet, Shalom continued to burn with a combative spirit.\u201cYou can\u2019t land a finger on her at all costs.\u201d His low mutterings expressed his determination.\u201cAre the ones who took everything from her planning to humiliate her too?!\u201d he shouted while coughing up blood. Shadows cast down his listeners\u2019 faces, including Joachim\u2019s. Although they couldn\u2019t forgive what Shalom and Ms. Bargot did, they empathized with the feelings behind Shalom\u2019s actions.\u201cNo matter what happens, I will not hand her over to you!\u201dShalom took out something from his cloak. Zich guessed what it was and clicked his tongue.\u201cYou don\u2019t carry around a potion with you, but you carry that around?\u201dZich was sure that it was the item that Clovey used\u2014the one that changed its drinkers\u2019 body into a monster\u2019s and increased their strength by multiple folds. Shalom drank it in one gulp.\u201cPlease escape, Ms. Bargot!\u201d Shalom carelessly threw his empty bottle and fixed the grip on his sword. Zich knew how bothersome it would be once Shalom turned into a monster.\u201cBefore he transforms\u2026!\u201d Zich flung his body forward, and in the blink of an eye, Zich was right in front of Shalom.\u201cYou bastard!\u201d Shalom threw his sword. Because his body was in the middle of transforming, the sword flew unevenly and trailed off from its orbit without much power. However, his changing physique made up for losing his sword, and his fighting ability shot up as his strength greatly increased.\u2018Still, it\u2019s not like anything else increased other than his strength.\u2019Zich didn\u2019t face the full force of Shalom\u2019s attacks head-on and spread out the impacts. Shalom was already disheveled from transforming and lost his balance. His body expanded forward, and his chest shot out into clear view. Zich aimed and pierced his sword inside Shalom\u2019s chest. Yet, Shalom didn\u2019t block Zich\u2019s attack. His chest was already coated in hardened skin, and Shalom planned to crush Zich flat as he fell.\u2018It seems like he really has fallen behind the frontlines.\u2019Otherwise, Shalom wouldn\u2019t have made a mistake like this. Zich\u2019s sword penetrated the same wounded area that his Piercing Space attack just pierced. With Shalom\u2019s body transformation, most of the wound was getting filled, but there were still gaps in between and Zich\u2019s attack was fatal.Craaack!Zich\u2019s sword crushed Shalom\u2019s hard skin and penetrated his heart.\u201cKugh!\u201dShalom halted, and at that moment, Zich poured in a great amount of mana from his sword.Craaaash!Waves of mana distorted Shalom\u2019s internal organs, and blood spurted out of Shalom\u2019s mouth.Sling!Zich pulled out his sword.Crash!Shalom\u2019s body fell. His bodily transformations came to a stop and half of his body was still in human form. He looked so gruesome that it might have been better if he had completely transformed into a monster instead.\u201cT-this is\u2026\u201d\u201cHow\u2026\u201dJoachim and his men, who had been watching the battle from behind, murmured in shock at Shalom\u2019s grotesque appearance. Zich looked at Ms. Bargot again. She was watching the battle calmly.\u201cWe can converse without distractions now.\u201dSurprisingly, Ms. Bargot smiled even after watching Shalom collapse to the ground although he tried his hardest to protect her. On the contrary, it seemed as if she felt refreshed, as if she had gotten rid of an aching tooth.\u201cYou\u2026! How could you say that about someone who acted for your sake!\u201d Joachim shouted in anger. Even if Shalom had done unforgivable wrongs, he was working for everyone who died an unjust death. How could she, who shared his pains, speak so indifferently about him?Slam!Shalom got up from the ground. He couldn\u2019t move well since he was critically injured, and like a snail, he crawled on the floor with his arms.\u201cM-Ms\u2026\u201dHe headed towards where Ms. Bargot was.\u201cQ-Quickly escape\u2026\u201d Shalom threw up blood. His voice cracked, but he didn\u2019t stop talking and everyone\u2019s eyes were focused on him. \u201cI\u2026will\u2026block them somehow\u2026so\u2026\u201dHe tried to grip his sword, but it slipped down his hand. He had no energy in any part of his body, but Shalom kept trying to grab his sword. Each of his movements seemed to show his desperate devotion to protecting Ms. Bargot. Yet, his feelings didn\u2019t seem to reach Ms. Bargot.\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dThose words stepped and crushed all of Shalom\u2019s efforts. Shalom looked up at Ms. Bargot and saw her indifferent eyes staring back at him.\u201c\u2026Why?\u201d Shalom asked anxiously.\u201cWhy\u2026I-I did it for you\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Ms. Bargot shook her head firmly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t act for me or the victims.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cYou did everything for your own sake.\u201d Ms. Bargot smiled, and the upturned corners of her lips seemed to pierce into Shalom\u2019s heart. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the case?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was avenging you\u2026and the vic\u2026tims\u2026\u201dClack!Ms. Bargot\u2019s footsteps cut Shalom\u2019s words short. She put one foot forward and bent her knees in front of Shalom. As she bent down, she matched her eyes to his eye level.\u201cNo, that is not the case.\u201d Ms. Bargot denied his words again.\u201cYour\u2014no, you and everyone who rebelled against the Count had only one purpose: it was for judgment.\u201d The word Shalom emphasized so much came out of Ms. Bargot\u2019s mouth.\u201cBy Count Dracul\u2019s orders, you and the other knights spread infectious diseases to countless people and sentenced them to a painful death. Because of that, all of you were filled with enormous guilt, but that feeling soon changed to anger. Anger towards the Count who made such an order, all the vassals who followed his orders, and yourselves.\u201dShalom\u2019s face changed. It was not because of his injuries, but because Ms. Bargot\u2019s words pierced the core of his soul.\u201cThat\u2019s why all of you welcomed an existence like me wholeheartedly. You made me the poster child for all the victims who suffered under the Count and his knights and used me to justify your group\u2019s idea of judgment.\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m right.\u201d Ms. Bargot crushed Shalom\u2019s feeble attempt to deny her words.\u201cOur suffering and pain are merely justifications for your actions and so-called \u2018judgment.\u2019 They are merely tools for you and your knights to escape from your sins and guilt.\u201d\u201cNo! I-I did it for you\u2026!\u201d\u201cSir Shalom, I will just say this.\u201dAs if she was telling him a long-held secret, she stressed out each word, \u201cI didn\u2019t want this revenge.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dShalom widened his eyes as if he couldn\u2019t believe her words. But he could see that she was telling the truth as he saw her cold, blank expression. He shook his head.\u201cNo, no. I-I just did it for you and all the people\u2026\u201d His quiet murmurings continued but no one paid attention to him. Joachim and his subordinates looked at Shalom with mixed emotions. The person in front of them was someone who strayed from the right path due to his regret and grief.\u201c\u2026Capture those two.\u201d Joachim gave out his order. Shalom was injured, and Ms. Bargot looked as if she possessed no fighting prowess. It was time to end this chaos. That was what he thought if\u2014\u201cStop.\u201dIf Zich had not intervened.\u201cWhat is the matter, Mr. Zich?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still Ms. Bargot. If we approach her carelessly, it\u2019ll be very dangerous for us.\u201d\u201cBut Ms. Bargot is\u2026\u201d Joachim stole a furtive glance at Ms. Bargot. She stood back up, and she didn\u2019t show any signs of resistance.\u201cMs. Bargot was dragged into this horrific situation by force, or by some misunderstanding or coincidence. So she will follow us without resisting. Well, you are probably thinking of something along these lines, right?\u201dJoachim had no words to say. Zich had pointed out his unconscious bias and thoughts. As if they also shared similar thoughts, people around Joachim flinched.\u201cIf you want me to correct your delusion, please reconsider Ms. Bargot\u2019s words, \u2018I didn\u2019t want this revenge.\u2019 All of you are thinking in a completely different direction than what she meant.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhat did Zich mean about a completely different direction? Didn\u2019t she mean that even after all the injustice and pain she went through, she had no desire for revenge? However, Zich denied what Joachim\u2014no, what most people were thinking.\u201cI can roughly guess what all of you are thinking. However, this woman was the one who invented and spread infectious diseases throughout the whole estate. Do you seriously think she would have such high morals to think such thoughts?\u201dWith Zich\u2019s words, they realized they were being swayed by the strange atmosphere.\u201cThen for what reason\u2026\u201d\u201cMs. Bargot.\u201d Zich spoke to Ms. Bargot.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cSince I worked hard on answering all your questions, would you be able to answer just one question?\u201d\u201cWhat is the question?\u201d Ms. Bargot asked gently.\u201cHow did you feel when your family got infected and was about to die?\u201d\u201cMr. Zich, that\u2026\u201dEven if Ms. Bargot was his enemy, there were basic societal lines that people had to keep. Even as he continued to stare at Ms. Bargot, Joachim tried to stop Zich. However, he stopped dead in his tracks. Because from beneath the veil, he saw Ms. Bargot\u2019s enormous smile.\u201cFu, fufufu! You really are impressive!\u201dMs. Bargot stared at the ceiling. As if she was recalling an old, nostalgic memory, her eyes became dazed.\u201cIt was all so sudden. My child who I kissed goodnight just yesterday began burning up, and my husband suddenly vomited blood as he was about to leave for work.\u201dThere had been an intense commotion. Everyone in the house began to fall one by one, and even the doctors were so overcome with fear that they refused to come to the house.\u201cWhile enduring the fear of getting infected, I took care of my husband and child by myself every day. I did it because that was how much I loved them.\u201dMs. Bargot wiped their burning hot bodies with a wet cloth and cleaned all the fluids and foods they vomited. She cleaned and changed their clothes when they excreted themselves. She did all this while looking at their faces constantly. She looked at them, because that was the only way she could find enough strength to continue living.\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I stared at their faces; it might have been hundreds, no, thousands of times. Despite all my efforts, I saw their faces grow worse day by day. Then a thought suddenly occurred inside my mind. Ah, people who are dying from infectious diseases\u2014\u201dHer eyes exuded light mixed with ecstasy and madness.\u201cHow beautiful they are!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d One knight let out a sound. He felt that he was about to vomit. But nobody blamed the knight because Zich and everyone felt disgusted by Ms. Bargot\u2019s last words. Even Shalom\u2019s eyes were filled with anger.\u201cLike I told you, I don\u2019t want revenge. On the contrary, I feel thankful to Count Dracul for teaching me about this great beauty.\u201d She smiled brightly. However, there was not a single person who returned her smile.\u2018Yep. That\u2019s Fest.\u2019 Zich nodded inside his mind. So far, he stopped Snoc from becoming the \u2018Tyrant of the Earth\u2019 and was in the process of stopping Joachim from becoming \u2018Vampire.\u2019 But out of everyone, he wanted to stop Fest from becoming a Demon Person the most. It was not only because Fest had already started spreading infectious diseases and terror to numerous villages.\u2018Even the Hero Party gritted their teeth at Fest.\u2019Fest was so evil that even the Hero Party that went around killing the trashiest of humans shook their heads at the mention of Fest\u2019s name. Fest was an insane person who was a head above the rest. This was one of the few pieces of information Zich knew about Fest in his past life.\u201cT-then why did you\u2026help\u2026\u201d Shalom desperately asked her this question after finally realizing Ms. Bargot\u2019s true nature.\u201cBecause I needed a place to experiment.\u201d\u201cA place\u2026to experiment?\u201d\u201cI needed some concrete data about the diseases I created. Especially for the knights who have an insane level of resistance from their ability to control mana. In that aspect, the castle was an ideal place. But thanks to a certain someone, everything ended before I could even really begin.\u201d Ms. Bargot looked sulkily at Zich.\u201cI-I can\u2019t\u2026believe it.\u201d\u201cWhy are you making a face like that, Sir Shalom? Just like how you used me to relieve some of the guilt you felt, I also used you. We both used each other, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for you to look so betrayed.\u201d\u201cYou snake-like bitch!\u201d Brod yelled out like he couldn\u2019t contain his emotions any longer. To him, Ms. Bargot was no longer human. \u201cSir! Please give us your order! We have to capture that woman right away!\u201dMs. Bargot asked, \u201cCan you really do that? Do you think I dawdled around this place for no reason?\u201d\u201cWhat more did you do this time?\u201d She was calm even while Brod growled at her.\u201cDo you remember Galdurim, the disease that I infected all of you with?\u201d\u201cHmph! That disease?! We are completely cured from it thanks to Sir Zich.\u201d\u201cWell, do you think you guys are the only ones who got infected?\u201d\u201cWhat are you blabbering about?\u201dJoachim no longer talked politely, and his eyes were scanning her.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really. The reason why I came inside the castle was because the knights and soldiers have a high resistance to diseases, so I had to personally infect you all. For others, I don\u2019t have to go out of my way to do that. Do you get what I mean?\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you have other hostages?\u201d\u201cAs expected, your head works quite fast.\u201d\u201cWho are they?\u201d\u201cAll the residents in Ospurin.\u201dJoachim looked horrified. \u201cY-You infected that many people?!\u201d\u201cDid you forget that my expertise is in infectious diseases? If I just infect a couple of people, the disease spreads naturally. Although it is the same for Galdurim, the strand I spread has a long dormant period, so it\u2019s probably infecting many people without stirring up any suspicions. Of course, I can immediately awaken its symptoms by will.\u201d\u201cYou are lying! If your ability is strong enough to control a disease that can infect all of Ospurin, you should have known immediately when we were fully cured.\u201d\u201cI think that and this is a different matter, but well, it\u2019s true that my ability can\u2019t reach the whole city. However, the result won\u2019t change. I can fully control the diseases around this castle, and I made it so that if I awaken some of the cases, the rest will awaken too like a chain.\u201dMs. Bargot shrugged her shoulders. \u201cI guess if you cure everyone in Ospurin, it could change things.\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201d Joachim gritted his teeth. He had to consider his next step of action carefully in case the entire city of Ospurin was held hostage. Ms. Bargot looked at Zich. She exuded confidence like no one could touch her.\u201cThen, let\u2019s begin our conversation again\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, forget that.\u201d Zich scratched his head. \u201cLet\u2019s end it now.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cI said, let\u2019s end it. I have seen enough of your arrogant and overconfident attitude.\u201dMs. Bargot couldn\u2019t respond immediately, because she was shocked by Zich\u2019s sudden change of attitude. However, Zich only focused on his next course of action. He fixed his grip on his sword and his stance suggested that he was going to dash towards her at any moment.\u201cW-Wait a moment, Mr. Zich!\u201d Joachim tried to stop Zich in a hurry. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if she has the lives of every resident in Ospurin under her grasp!\u201dStill, Zich didn\u2019t change his attack stance. Joachim stared at him anxiously, but he didn\u2019t go out of his way to stop Zich either. Zich had solved all kinds of problems so far, and Joachim wondered if Zich had something up his sleeves again. Hope sprouted out of Joachim\u2019s heart.\u201c\u2026This is a bit disappointing. To think you are so foolish\u2026After all this time, do you not believe me?\u201d\u201cHow could I? I believe you.\u201d\u201cThen, are you going to sacrifice the people in Ospurin?\u201d\u201cIf I have to make that decision, I will choose to kill you even if I have to sacrifice Ospurin.\u201dEveryone looked shocked, and even Ms. Bargot seemed like she did not expect this response.\u201cS-Sir Zich!\u201d Hans yelled in surprise. \u201cD-Didn\u2019t you say that you wanted to live a kind life? Then, how could you say\u2026!\u201dAlthough his personality was nasty and he had a bizarre way of thinking, Zich\u2019s resolution to do kind acts had always been resolute. Hans believed in at least this much, and he was more shocked by Zich\u2019s response.\u201cYeah, I will live kindly. So, that\u2019s why I am trying to kill that woman.\u201d\u201cBut everyone in Ospurin may die!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a sacrifice that can\u2019t be helped.\u201dHans froze in place.\u201cHey, Hans. It might seem cruel to you since you dream of heroes from storybooks, but a person has to always make a choice at some point in their lives. As of right now, a huge decision is pressing down upon me.\u201dIt was a choice between Ospurin\u2019s citizens or finishing Greta Bargot.\u201cIf you really dream of becoming a hero, you have to make a decision even if you have to endure a pain as strong as your intestines twisting up. You saw that woman\u2019s true face too, right? If she escapes right now, do you think she would live like a recluse inside a mountain and repent for her sins? Or do you think she would wander around, spreading more infectious diseases?\u201dHans knew it was the latter. There wasn\u2019t a person in the room who thought the former would happen.\u201cThen, do you think the people who will die from her diseases in the future would be less than the population in Ospurin?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHans couldn\u2019t breathe well with the daunting choice of saving lives against more lives.\u201cBesides, I said that I would live a kind life, but I didn\u2019t say that I will live while comparing every act with another to see which one is kinder. Saving Ospurin\u2019s people is definitely a kind act, but it is also a kind act to kill this witch in front of us. If both are kind acts, I will choose which one I\u2019m going to do.\u201dIt was a truly cruel and heartless decision. People quelled their breathing, and Ms. Bargot looked at Zich chillingly. \u201c\u2026So, are you going to put an end to this?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying.\u201d\u201cM-Mr. Zich! Even so, we can\u2019t sacrifice everyone in Ospurin!\u201d Joachim blocked Zich.Even if Zich was right, as the son of Count Dracul, he couldn\u2019t just watch the fall of Ospurin. Next to Joachim, Brod seemed to agree, and the ends of his sword shook as if it was hinting at an imminent battle.\u2018Well, since you are an aristocrat of this land, it\u2019s understandable.\u2019It would have been stranger if they didn\u2019t act like this.Ms. Bargot ridiculed Zich, \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to agree with your decision.\u201dZich glanced at Joachim and Brod and shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI got too caught up in the moment. Don\u2019t worry, sir. The residents of Ospurin will be fine.\u201d\u201cAh, of course. Mr. Zich couldn\u2019t have really meant those words\u2026\u201d\u201cI meant everything I said.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Joachim, who felt relieved, closed his mouth.\u201cBut that\u2019s only if I have to really make a choice to give up the residents in Ospurin or Ms. Bargot.\u201d\u201cIs there another way?\u201d Ms. Bargot looked at him with innocent eyes. She was mocking him because she was sure that there was no other way. An opponent that was completely confident in themselves\u2014this was Zich\u2019s favorite type of prey.\u201cIn the first place, I don\u2019t need to consider between those two choices. I don\u2019t need to give up on either one of them.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\u201cAll the citizens in Ospurin have already been cured.\u201dEveryone was shocked; beneath her veil, Ms. Bargot\u2019s mouth slightly opened up in surprise. Seeing her surprised face, Zich smiled brightly.\u201cHow about it, Ms. Bargot? How was your sweet moment of hope?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cYou c-cured everyone?\u201d Ms. Bargot was so surprised that she stuttered and could not gather her words. But that was only for a moment. Her eyes soon became calm.\u201cYou are lying.\u201d She was sure of it.But Zich replied, \u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth. As you know, people who are infected by Galdurim get a small red dot behind their ears.\u201d\u201cYou even noticed that?\u201dA small dot on the back of the ear was a very difficult symptom to notice. Not only was it hard to see the back of people\u2019s ears, but most people would think nothing of it. Rather than a symptom of a disease, most people would have thought of it as a person\u2019s birthmark or something similar to that.\u201cWhen you infected people with Galdurim in the castle, I realized that the red dot was a symptom of a disease. Moreover, I also noticed that ordinary citizens in Ospurin also had the same dot behind their ears.\u201dWhen he came back to the village, the first thing he checked was the back of people\u2019s ears.\u201cSo since then, I started on my cure for Galdurim.\u201d\u201cEven if you knew about Galdurim before, it\u2019s still impossible. If you made the medicine, you must also know it too. One of the ingredients for that medicine is biolsam intestine. It\u2019s an extremely rare and precious medicinal ingredient. Even if you were able to miraculously acquire enough biolsam to make medicine for everyone in the castle, it\u2019s impossible to make enough of that medicine to cure all the citizens in Ospurin.\u201dMaking the medicine was not a matter of manpower but ingredients. For that reason, Ms. Bargot was certain of her victory.\u201cBiolsam intestine? What is that?\u201d\u201cAre you pretending to not know? If you don\u2019t have that, you can\u2019t make the medicine, so please stop your useless acting.\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t know. Moreover, I never told you that I analyzed the medicine you handed to the assassins.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dWhen Ms. Bargot had asked Zich if he recreated the medicine for Galdurim after analyzing the medicine she gave to the assassins, Zich did not say anything during that time either.\u201cBiolsam intestines? As someone with only amateur knowledge, it\u2019s an ingredient that I have no knowledge of. The ingredient I used was hulkum.\u201d\u201cHul\u2026kum\u2026?\u201d It was a medicinal ingredient that even Ms. Bargot had never heard of.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cWell, you know, the purple grass that grows all around us.\u201dMs. Bargot could get a general idea of what he was talking about. Then her eyes widened. It was not because she realized he was talking about an extraordinary ingredient\u2014it was actually the opposite.Ms. Bargot shouted, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible! That! T-that grass is\u2014!\u201d\u201cYes, you are right.\u201d Zich made a mischievous smile as he continued, \u201cIt\u2019s just a weed.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dThere was a reason why Ms. Bargot did not know its name. In this period, hulkum was just a weed that grew healthily anywhere. Hulkum\u2019s vitality was so strong, farmers called it \u2018Demon Poop.\u2019\u2018But that weed is super effective on Galdurim and many of Fest\u2019s diseases.\u2019Most of the medicine for Fest\u2019s curable diseases used hulkum as the basis. It was extremely ironic that a weed that people inadvertently stepped on every day could cure some of Fest\u2019s diseases when the most expensive and rare medicinal ingredients failed to do so.\u201cDo you understand now? I don\u2019t know what biolsam intestines are, and I don\u2019t know the ingredients for the medicine you gave to the assassins. All I know is that hulkum can cure Galdurim, and I made my medicine using that. So contrary to your expectations, obtaining the ingredients for the cure was not hard at all.\u201dZich stretched out his fingers to the side. \u201cHulkum is everywhere around Ospurin. Moreover, it\u2019s also very easy to make this cure.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh! There\u2019s no way a disease that I made could be cured by a weed!\u201d\u201cI can see that your pride has been hurt. But what can you do? It\u2019s the truth. Well, it does sound funny when you say it like that.\u201dZich stared impudently at Ms. Bargot. \u201cOr perhaps, is it because your skills are just that lousy?\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d Ms. Bargot looked furious. There was no trace of her self-confident attitude as she told everyone of how she experimented on people with infectious diseases.\u201cAh, even if you made enough medicine for everyone, how could you have fed medicine to all the citizens of Ospurin while not getting noticed by other people\u2026\u201d\u201cYou were the one who taught me how. You said Igram spreads between people who use the same water source. The medicine I made is in liquid form, and it\u2019s almost tasteless.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did you perhaps!\u201d\u201cYes, you are right.\u201d Zich replied energetically, \u201cI drugged the well.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dIn times of war, people put poison in their enemy\u2019s wells, but Ms. Bargot had never heard of anyone putting medicine in a well.\u201cIt was really hard to secretly put medicine in many of the wells throughout this large city.\u201dHans also nodded his head without much thought. With Snoc and Zich, they went around secretly putting medicine in all the wells in the dead of night. This was extremely hard work. If Joachim hadn\u2019t provided them with great care, Hans would have totally passed out.\u2018Wow, it really was medicine.\u2019 Hans let go of his suspicions and vowed to never get found out that he doubted Zich\u2019s words.\u201cAfter we spread the medicine, all the people I checked didn\u2019t have the red dot behind their ears anymore. Of course, I can\u2019t say for sure that I cured everyone in Ospurin, but it\u2019s enough to not let you escape. Is my answer good enough for you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Ms. Bargot did not say anything. She was wondering if she should believe in Zich\u2019s words or not. But regardless, the situation was becoming disadvantageous for her.\u201cIs that really\u2026true?\u201d Joachim asked Zich. He wished with all his heart that Zich\u2019s words were true, and one could see it clearly on his face.\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201dJoachim fell into thought for a moment, but he soon made his final decision. \u201cRound up Shalom and Ms. Bargot right now!\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Brod loudly replied and led the other knights and soldiers forward. Joachim decided to trust Zich.Ms. Bargot bit her lips; her piercing eyes glared at Zich. \u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t think you would be such a hindrance.\u201d\u201cPeople who fight against me usually say that.\u201dThen, her face crumpled. \u201cI guess it can\u2019t be helped. I didn\u2019t want to use this, but\u2026\u201dMs. Bargot lamented and at the same time\u2014Pop!Her clothes burst, and pinkish muscles erupted out of her thin arms, transforming her slim figure into an uneven shape.\u2018Transformation!\u2019It was what Clovey and Shalom had used. Zich swung his sword against Ms. Bargot.Clang!Her palms, which had grown as big as a person\u2019s face, blocked Zich\u2019s sword.Zich said to her, \u201cOh. Since you are the one who made it, it\u2019s different for you.\u201dThe speed at which she transformed was completely different from when Clovey and Shalom had transformed.\u201cI also don\u2019t like myself in this state. It\u2019s extremely hideous.\u201dOnly her face hadn\u2019t finished transforming, and it was a grotesque sight to see a human\u2019s face talking on top of a gigantic monster\u2019s body. However, her face began to change more and more, and likewise, her voice became rougher and even stranger.[But it can\u2019t be helped now!]Ms. Bargot (although she had changed so much Zich wondered if he should still call her that) flung her arm widely, and Zich\u2019s body went flying. It was an incredible amount of power. Zich kicked the ceiling and landed on the floor again. Everyone, including Joachim, was shocked by her transformation. However, since they already witnessed Shalom\u2019s transformation, they quickly regained their composure.\u201cKnights! Surround that!\u201d Brod seemed to not even consider the creature in front of him human as he called her \u2018that.\u2019 And with Ms. Bargot\u2019s current appearance, he wasn\u2019t really wrong.[Kuuuuaaaah!]While ringing out monstrous shrieks, she flailed her arms all around her. Ms. Bargot didn\u2019t seem to have lost consciousness, but her personality seemed to have gotten much more violent.\u201cKuh!\u201d\u201cKuah!\u201dMs. Bargot didn\u2019t use any skills like Clovey and Shalom, but her physical capacities were far superior to their transformed states. Knights blocked her attacks and began to withdraw. Some even flew in the air at the impact of her attacks.\u201cConcentrate on avoiding rather than blocking! Those in front, prepare for the next attack, and those in the back, lead the offense!\u201d Knights began to move under Brod\u2019s commands. They let Ms. Bargot\u2019s attacks pass behind them, and those behind pierced and sliced with their swords.Clash! Claaash!The swords didn\u2019t go through her hard skin. However, the knights hadn\u2019t reached their positions by relying on luck. They attacked the same area or used their own skills to pierce her skin.Crack!One of the knights succeeded in penetrating his sword through her skin.\u201cGreat! It worked!\u201d The knight shouted to let others know of his success and pulled out his sword.Splash!Blood poured out of the wound and landed on the knight\u2019s body. The knight wasn\u2019t concerned since this amount of blood was nothing in battles. He was just glad that his attack worked.\u201cHuaaaap!\u201dEven though the creature before them looked scary, the knights attacked harder than before after they realized their attacks could go through.\u201cIt regenerates!\u201dThe knights were unshaken and continued to corner Ms. Bargot as if they were used to fighting against regenerating monsters.Wobble!\u201cHuh?\u201d One of the knights lost his balance and fell.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?!\u201dThe knight was taken aback since he hadn\u2019t received a direct attack. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no strength in my body\u2026\u201dEven the fallen knight didn\u2019t seem to know why he fell down. \u201cMy body suddenly lost all strength\u2026Gruuah!\u201dSuddenly, foam came out of his mouth. Saliva dripped down, and soon, the knight threw up crimson blood. Then red spots appeared on his face, and his eyes turned upwards.Everyone lost their composure from the strange sight in front of them, but this was just the beginning.Drop! Drop!Knights began to fall one by one, and they all showed the same symptoms that the first knight had shown.\u2018It looks like they were infected.\u2019 Zich thought the states of the knights were similar to the states of the infected patients he had seen in the villages. \u2018But knights with high resistance to diseases got infected? In an instant too?\u2019Ms. Bargot had obviously used some kind of trick. While he was thinking this, Zich spotted the blood droplets on the knights\u2019 bodies. \u2018No wonder!\u2019As the number of knights decreased significantly, Ms. Bargot began to attack more vigorously; and while he struck down her attacks with his sword, Zich shouted, \u201cBlood! You can\u2019t touch her blood!\u201dPeople quickly adapted to Zich\u2019s words and began to avoid the blood on the ground.\u201cAs expected of someone who spreads diseases, you grow a bunch of diseases even in your own blood.\u201d[Fufufu! This one is specially made. No matter how high the knights\u2019 resistance levels are, this will make them roll on the ground in an instant.]Then Zich saw Ms. Bargot open her mouth, and he ran backward by instinct.Spit!Her saliva dropped onto the other side of the prayer room.\u2018Does her saliva transmit diseases too?\u2019 Zich clicked his tongue. \u2018That damn Hero Party. It\u2019s fine if they wanted to hide Fest\u2019s identity, but they should have disclosed this kind of information.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You have to take Sir Joachim and all the other soldiers to a safer location!\u201dEven knights with high resistance fell ill to Ms. Bargot\u2019s blood. If ordinary soldiers merely made contact with Ms. Bargot\u2019s fluids, they would die instantly. It would be especially fatal to Joachim who was frail in the first place.\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Brod quickly carried Joachim on his back.\u201cWe have to save the knights who collapsed\u2014!\u201d\u201cSir, it\u2019s already too late!\u201dAs Joachim saw the knights who were on the ground become completely still, he bit his lips.\u201c\u2026Ms\u2026Bargot\u2026!\u201d A dying voice cried out to Ms. Bargot. Shalom, who was on the ground after getting attacked by Zich, also got some of Ms. Bargot\u2019s blood on him.Despite his half-transformed state, he also couldn\u2019t fight off Ms. Bargot\u2019s disease and had rashes all over his skin. He stared incessantly at Ms. Bargot. It was hard to tell if his eyes were filled with worry or grudge. No one could tell what was reflected in his eyes. However, before people could even guess what it could be, his head lost strength and dropped to the floor.After being consumed by guilt, Ms. Bargot had played Shalom. It was a pathetic end for someone who committed murder against countless innocent people. However, there was not a single person who cared about his death. Everyone around him had already forgotten him\u2014even Ms. Bargot, whom he had called out to in his last moments.\u201cGet all the regular soldiers out of the castle immediately! The knights will fight off Ms. Bargot. Make sure to never touch her blood or any other fluids!\u201d After Joachim loudly shouted this order, he escaped from the prayer room. The soldiers and knights who were gathered outside the door began moving.\u2018He\u2019s really an impressive guy.\u2019Joachim calmed himself down quickly and made the most rational decision for his subordinates. Even though he no longer had the strength as he did when he was the \u2018Vampire\u2019, he was still an impressive person.Zich called out to Hans who was next to him. \u201cHans.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dFortunately, Hans had been a step away from the other knights and had not been splattered by Ms. Bargot\u2019s blood.\u201cUnless you are given a separate order, just step back and help out the knights a bit. If you try to fight Ms. Bargot with your current skill level, you will die pointlessly.\u201d\u201cI understand, sir!\u201d At Zich\u2019s order, Hans moved further away from Ms. Bargot.[I see that Sir Joachim left. How about it? I also have no intention to stay any longer in the Dracul estate. Why don\u2019t we head off to our own paths now?]A knight shouted, \u201cShut up! How can we let a witch like you go!\u201d[But clingy men are not my style.]Whish!She moved her hand. As if to slap the knight, her palms swept past him with a terrifying sound. Just the sound of her palms moving inspired sweat to drip down people\u2019s backs. However, the knights did not waver and moved closer to Ms. Bargot. Zich also put himself between them and wielded his sword. However, they had no choice but to halt the momentum of their attacks. If they wanted to knock her down, they had to stab her with a sword, but if they did, blood would spurt out. And her blood gave mysterious diseases to everyone who came into contact with it.Ms. Bargot fully utilized that to her advantage. If she got injured on her arm, she would wield her arms even more widely, and she would spit at them every few minutes. But most of all, she possessed enormous physical strength.\u2018This would be so much easier with a magician.\u2019Zich clicked his tongue and stepped one step closer than the rest of the knights.[Oh my! Would you also be taking care of me?]\u201cHow can I not? Especially when we were in such a passionate relationship.\u201d Zich aimed his sword.[Fufufu! Thinking back on it, I think you were a good escort despite your cold personality. Then shall I turn up the heat?]Ms. Bargot raised her hand. Her sharp nails shone.Rip! Riip!It all happened in a matter of seconds. Ms. Bargot scratched herself, and a terrible wound appeared on her body. Blood flowed out like a fountain.\u201cDamn it!\u201d The knights quickly tried to move back. With Ms. Bargot\u2019s movement, blood droplets flew across the air. It was as if blood was raining down on them.\u2018Man, she\u2019s making things so complicated.\u2019 Zich poured a large amount of mana into his sword. As if he was knocking on the air with his sword, he slightly hit the air above him a few times. In a matter of seconds, the mana from the end of his sword let out a burst of mana into the air.Explode!As if the air had been hit by a hammer, a shockwave exploded in the air. All the blood droplets in the air flew to a corner of the wall.[\u2026I thought of this when you survived a surprise attack in the village, but your fighting abilities really are impressive.]Since the shockwave was not directed at her, Ms. Bargot did not even feel the slightest bit of pain. Zich\u2019s technique had been aimed at the blood droplets and not at her.\u201cI\u2019m confident that there is no one above me in skills at least.\u201d[How trustworthy. But all you did so far was push away a blood storm. I can make something like that as many times as I want.]True to her words, blood flowed out of Ms. Bargot\u2019s body and soaked the whole floor. Her wound was now almost completely healed, but the amount of blood she let out was already an overflowing amount.\u201cYou really are a troublesome opponent.\u201dThis was the truth, even Zich might get infected if he made contact with her blood.\u201cBut it\u2019s annoying to see you act like you\u2019ve already won.\u201dZich infused more mana into his sword. But this time, he didn\u2019t concentrate the mana into one part of his sword or strengthen his sword by infusing mana to the entire sword. Without any sort of precision, he forcefully injected mana inside the sword. However, the force of his sword was extremely strong.Zing!The sword rang. It sounded almost as if it was ferociously roaring to pay back all the times it was mocked.Hissss!The sword turned red, and the air around it slightly wavered.Thud!Zich pushed off from his feet and lunged towards Ms. Bargot. She reached out her hands at him.Whish!Zich easily evaded her attack. Even though her physical prowess were extremely frightening, she had never received formal training and was full of openings. Her tough skin was now right in front of him. His eyes landed on one area of her body. It was the wound on her body that had not completely healed yet. The wound was now as small as a fingertip, but that was enough for Zich.Push!Zich smoothly pushed his sword. Normally, blood would have spurt out of her wound and erupted all around her. But shockingly, no blood came out of her wound. Only the smell of burnt smoke spread all around.[Urghhhhh!]Ms. Bargot screamed out loud. She squirmed like she couldn\u2019t stand the pain, and Zich pulled out his sword. However, the sword had already cut through her deeply.\u201cHow is it, miss?\u201d Zich asked sweetly while watching Ms. Bargot clutch her wounded areas. \u201cI\u2019m sure you feel like your wounds are burning.\u201dIt was a skill that heated the sword\u2019s body by rubbing it roughly with mana and creating friction. Zich had a simple name for the skill: \u2018Scorching Sword.\u2019\u2018Since it affects the sword\u2019s durability, I didn\u2019t really want to use it.\u2019But it had a definite effect. Blood didn\u2019t spurt out of her wounds and seemed to have burned the disease on the inside.\u2018It also slowed down her regeneration.\u2019It was the most effective attack to use on Ms. Bargot. Zich continued to attack. He avoided her hard skin and targeted the already open wounds with slow regeneration.[Kuh!]Ms. Bargot tried to inflict wounds on her own body and spray her blood; but as soon as her fingernails reached her skin, Zich\u2019s sword blew her way.[Kuahhhh!]As Zich\u2019s attacks sliced pieces of her body, she felt an immeasurable amount of pain. And whenever he stuck his sword into Ms. Bargot\u2019s wounds, the sword\u2019s heat traveled to her insides through mana. Ms. Bargot could not harm herself as the wounds she had purposefully created turned into her weakness.The knights who had been watching her from behind also began to help Zich. Since they couldn\u2019t attack without splashing blood, they helped by blocking Ms. Bargot\u2019s attacks or protecting Zich.[Kuuuah!]Another deep wound formed in Ms. Bargot\u2019s abdomen. The smell of gas and meat reeked out of the wound this time, and Ms. Bargot realized that she could really die this time. She felt a great sense of danger.[I-In a place like this\u2026?] She gritted her teeth. [Do you think that I would die in a place like this!] Her characteristic, composed way of speaking disappeared. She stretched her mouth wide and bit into her own arm.Chomp!Her powerful teeth easily crushed her hard skin. Blood, incomparable to the amount from before, poured out, but Ms. Bargot didn\u2019t loosen her jaws and bit even harder into her arm.Craaack!With a terrifying din, Ms. Bargot\u2019s arm was perfectly severed from her body. Then, she grabbed onto her severed arm and flung it around.\u201cA-Avoid it!\u201d The knights withdrew and shouted in horror. Blood poured out from her arm like a fountain and fell like rain. Even Zich had to increase his distance.While shrieking, she threw her arm at Zich, and to avoid it, Zich made a large leap to the side.Crash!Ms. Bargot turned her back. Then, she dashed forward and slammed her shoulder on a nearby wall.Crash!The thick wall broke down powerlessly, and the downtown area came into view through the hole that formed from the impact. Ms. Bargot jumped down the hole.\u2018Is she escaping?\u2019Zich hurriedly followed her and shouted to the knights, \u201cI will hold her, so all of you tell Sir Joachim immediately that Ms. Bargot escaped! If she heads to the downtown area, there will be a lot more damage!\u201d\u201cY-Yes, sir!\u201d\u201cHans! You follow Sir Brod. Follow his orders!\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dThe knights scrambled to get out of the entrance; they also knew what would happen if Ms. Bargot\u2014who could be called the breeding ground for epidemics\u2014 went outside of the castle. Hans also followed them and ran outside.Plop!Zich jumped down from the hole. The place he landed on looked like the castle\u2019s gardens.\u2018This is actually preferable.\u2019It was more comfortable to battle in a wide area than inside the castle where there were many barriers.\u2018Here, I can just strike any skill without a second thought.\u2019If he thought of it like this, it was actually better that Ms. Bargot had escaped.\u2018Still, I can\u2019t let her go outside of the castle.\u2019If Zich let her outside, the damages she would cause were unthinkable. Then, suddenly, Zich smirked.\u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m trying to reduce people\u2019s sufferings right now.\u2019He wondered what the Demon Lord, Zich Moore, from before the regression would think if he saw Zich\u2019s current self. Perhaps he would mock him, click his tongue, or give off a bloodthirst. But it didn\u2019t matter. Regardless of how he used to be, this was the present now.\u2018Even my past self can\u2019t dictate how I will live!\u2019Crash!After pouring an immense amount of mana to his legs, Zich quickly dashed towards Ms. Bargot. The speed at which she escaped was incredibly fast, but he caught up to her before she got away from the castle. It was fortunate that the castle\u2019s premises stretched far and wide.[Daaamn it!]Formalities were non-existent now. While letting out a string of aggressive curses, Ms. Bargot waved her remaining arm.\u201cThat way of speaking fits your current appearance! Truthfully, I thought it was disgusting how you kept maintaining elegant speech even after your appearance changed like a monster!\u201d Zich also dropped his formalities and swung his sword.After she lost her arm, Ms. Bargot had lost one of her means to attack and struggled to maintain balance. Thus, for Zich, Ms. Bargot\u2019s attacks were very easy to evade.Claaang!His sword and hands shot forth. A rough sound rang out. Zich didn\u2019t engage in a battle of pure strength and only used attacks that could distort her momentum.Wobble!As her large body began to sway, Zich aimed the area where her arms had been severed. His sword was already exuding out steaming heat.Slice![Ah!]Ms. Bargot groaned in pain. She tried her hardest to finish off Zich, but the more she tried, she got tangled up in his movements even more. The difference between their fighting experiences was astronomical.[Kuu!]Perhaps, she judged that she couldn\u2019t succeed no matter what. She turned her back again.\u2018Is she planning to just make a run for it?\u2019 Zich clicked his tongue like he thought it was pathetic. \u2018Does she think I will just watch her leave?\u2019There were already many cuts all over her body, and Zich no longer needed to go through the trouble of trying to pierce through her hard skin. \u2018She\u2019s too dangerous\u2014for me to keep her alive to get information. I should end it here.\u2019 Zich filled his sword with mana. Since there wasn\u2019t anybody near him, he thought he would blow his opponent away with a huge attack.Crash!Red pillars of light shot up. They contained a great amount of heat and scattered their brilliant light to its surroundings and shot forward toward Ms. Bargot.Bam!It wasn\u2019t rough or loud\u2014the sound of the blows calmly resonated and Ms. Bargot\u2019s upper body disappeared entirely. As if the pillars of light weren\u2019t satisfied with just that, they blew up all the ornaments in the garden and vanished into the faraway sky. The force was eye-opening, to say the least.Ms. Bargot\u2019s lower body, which had lost its top, staggered a couple of steps and collapsed to the ground. Its wounded areas were charred completely black that not even blood dripped out of them. And that was the end of \u2018Greta Bargot\u2019\u2014the one who used the Dracul estate as her personal experiment site and playground.Zich\u2019s target, Ms. Bargot, was dead, but he didn\u2019t let his guard down. Instead, he heightened his senses even more. The final blow which had killed Ms. Bargot wasn\u2019t Zich\u2019s work.\u201cWho is it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhile trying to detect the mysterious figure who killed Ms. Bargot, Zich kept glancing back at the traces of the attack.\u2018It was extreme heat that killed her.\u2019Everything that the light pillars touched was scorched black. Zich assumed that the parts that were now gone probably evaporated from the extreme heat, but this was not the most frightening part. The most frightening part was how fast everything evaporated.\u2018It all happened in an instant.\u2019As soon as the light pillar appeared, everything disappeared; it was as if everything the pillars touched teleported to another space.\u2018Those pillars must have contained an unimaginable amount of power.\u2019Zich was on the highest alert because of how powerful that attack was.\u2018Is it magic?\u2019It was an attack that used nature and reproduced special abilities. This attack was slightly different from Joachim\u2019s Blood Domination. Magic took an extremely long time and effort to master. Moreover, every time a person used magic, they had to say an incantation. But the overall effect and magnitude of a magic attack were enormous.\u2018Considering the attack just now, this person is not an ordinary magician.\u2019Furthermore, even though Zich had been focusing all his attention on Ms. Bargot, it was extremely rare for him to not sense anything until the moment of the attack. The person was definitely a formidable figure. However, Zich could now clearly sense someone behind a huge tree.\u201cHey, let me see your face! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to attack you. I just want to know who you are and why you came here.\u201d Zich\u2019s tone returned to his usual easygoing and casual tone. But the only thing casual was his tone; he was still on full alert towards the mysterious figure.Snap!Zich heard someone step on the grass. The mysterious figure slowly came out from behind the tree.\u2018Ah, wow!\u2019Zich almost let out his admiration. Stunning\u2014that was the first word that popped up in his mind when he saw the person come out. Her silver hair glistened in the light, and her red eyes looked like jewels. By a slight degree, she could be considered even more beautiful than Lubella, and when she passed by, everyone would naturally all stare at her.Zich immediately thought, \u2018She doesn\u2019t look human.\u2019However, no matter how beautiful she was, it didn\u2019t change the fact that she was an extremely suspicious figure. Zich was not so foolish to lower his guard just because his opponent was pretty.\u2018No, on the other hand, beautiful people can be more dangerous.\u2019Ms. Bargot, who laid on the ground with her lower body gone, was a clear example of this.\u201cAll right, pretty lady, what is your identity? Why are you here?\u201d Zich tried to get information from her. They were in Dracul\u2019s castle; it was not a place random people could enter, especially at a time like this.\u2018Is she a magician associated with the Dracul estate?\u2019Even though he could not immediately rule out this possibility, magicians were extremely rare in the first place. Even though the head of the Dracul estate was a count, it was hard to imagine he would have such a powerful magician under his power.\u201c\u2026Zich?\u201d\u201cHuh? Do you know me?\u201dShockingly, the woman seemed to know Zich. However, Zich did not know her at all. For a second, Zich thought she might be someone he wasn\u2019t able to remember. Did he not remember her because he met her in Steelwall and they didn\u2019t meet each other for a long time? Zich looked at her from head to toe.\u2018\u2026But I don\u2019t know this person?\u2019No matter how much time passed, there was no way Zich would not be able to remember a person like her.\u201c\u2026Zich\u2026Steelwall\u2026\u201d She muttered Zich\u2019s name again.\u201cSince you call me Steelwall, did we meet each other there? I\u2019m sorry, but could you introduce yourself again? Even though I can\u2019t believe that I would forget a beauty like you, I honestly think this is our first time meeting.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOr did you actually see me from far away and fell in love with me? Then why didn\u2019t you tell me! If a beautiful lady like you came to meet me, I would have run to you at once. Could you perhaps tell me your name or where you live right now? It\u2019s definitely not because I find you suspicious or anything like that; I\u2019m just really interested\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\u201cWhat? What do you mean no?\u201d\u201cYou are not\u2026Zich Steelwall\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss, what are you saying? Didn\u2019t you know me in the past? I did throw away my family name, but Zich Steelwall was my name in the past\u2026\u201d\u201cZich\u2026\u201dHer red eyes stared directly at Zich, as if she was trying to extract his real self out.\u201c\u2026Moore!\u201dWhish!Everything happened in an instant. As always, Zich was trying to get information from the other party in a leisurely manner, but in the next moment, he took out his sword. With bloodthirst, Zich tried with all his might to move his sword as far as possible. However, he was blocked by a semi-transparent wall.Crash!He infused so much mana into his sword that a giant explosion erupted when he hit the wall. Zich continued to push his sword.Screech!But his sword could not move even an inch.\u2018Magic Barrier!\u2019With this, Zich was now completely confident that his opponent was a magician. Zich opened his mouth as he saw her through the semi-transparent wall. \u201cHey miss, do you want to go out on a date with me? I suddenly have an intense interest in you. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll cover all the expenses, find a nice location, and take care of all the meager details. All you have to do is just talk with me a bit.\u201d\u201cWow, that is\u2026\u201d She glared at him. \u201cAn awful way to ask someone out on a date!\u201dExplode!The magic barrier exploded. The force of its explosion pushed Zich back.\u2018Damn!\u2019Zich clicked his tongue as he got further away from the silver-haired woman.\u2018It\u2019s not good to be far away from a magician.\u2019Even though Zich had some long-range attacks, he was still a swordsman. In long-range attacks, magicians definitely had the advantage.The silver-haired woman took her hand out and began to murmur incantations. \u201cEl. Latel. Le. Ward.\u201dA circle with a myriad of symbols began to appear in front of her hand. It was a magic circle.\u2018I can\u2019t let her finish!\u2019Zich ran towards her again.Flash!The magic circle in front of her hand shone, and once again, a pillar of red light stretched out in front of her. Zich had already experienced the magnitude of that force. Without even thinking of fighting against it, Zich evaded the red pillars.\u2018Why the heck is it so fast?!\u2019Zich was surprised by the magic that flew past him. Magic at this level had a tremendous number of incantations for one to remember. However, she had only said a few words.\u2018Incantation Reduction!\u2019It was one of the requirements for a high-level magician to know\u2014a skill that allowed users to shorten spells when using magic.\u2018And now that I think about it, she set up a magic barrier in an instant too.\u2019Zich was sure that it had been \u2018Silent Incantation\u2019 which was an even more advanced skill than Incantation Reduction. As expected, it seemed as if his opponent wasn\u2019t just any ordinary magician.\u2018She\u2019s a high-ranking magician. And she doesn\u2019t seem like those types of protected magicians who fight at the rear; she\u2019s a magician who specializes in combat.\u2019The more he found out about this woman, the more Zich became curious about her. Just from a glance, he could tell that they didn\u2019t have much of an age gap.\u2018If she knows that my name is Zich Moore, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she regressed like me.\u2019If that was the case, it was natural for her skills to be much greater than what her appearance suggested.Whoosh!He swung his sword towards her again, but she didn\u2019t falter.\u201cClate! On!\u201dWhoosh!Sharp blades formed near her body. Zich quickly crouched.\u201cKuh!\u201dZich avoided the blades, but they left whirling winds that made him off balance.\u201cSuni! Con! Chanwel!\u201dBam!The ground shot up and whacked him. Zich was barely able to block the attack with his sword and was pushed back.\u2018Damn it! She is really skilled in combat!\u2019The magician used wind magic against Zich. The wind attack was precise enough to not pose a great danger to bystanders who could be close by, but it broke its opponents\u2019 balance through a strong blast even if it didn\u2019t land directly on its target. As the magician wanted, Zich lost his sense of balance. As soon as that happened, she stomped the ground and flung Zich into the air.\u2018A huge one is coming next.\u2019With a wider distance, she no longer had to worry about getting sucked into her own magic. All that was left for her to do was to use one of the most advantageous abilities that a magician had and sweep the entire area with a wide-reaching firepower.\u201cWing! Son! Clowey! Jinun! Ahatrim!\u201dA huge fireball appeared in front of her. It was already amazing that she could use different types of elemental magic, but it was more surprising that she could use the right magic in the appropriate situations. However, Zich wasn\u2019t an easy opponent either.Whoosh!He threw his sword against the fireball and aimed it towards her. The silver-haired woman looked surprised like she didn\u2019t expect Zich to throw the only weapon he had. But she soon closed her mouth again and shot out fireballs.\u2018She can also do Incantation Suspension?\u2019Incantation Reduction and Silent Incantation were skills that lacked high power, but they were still a very complicated form of magic. However, Incantation Suspension was different. If a magician stopped their incantation in the middle, the spell usually fell apart and nothing would happen\u2014they would have simply wasted their mana.However, if the magician was familiar with Incantation Suspension, they could forcibly materialize an incomplete spell as long as its power level was on the lower end, like now. Zich\u2019s sword and fireball clashed against each other in the air.Craaaash!Strong heat waves flared out with an explosive sound. However, what was dangerous wasn\u2019t really the heat waves.Whoosh!Zich\u2019s hands filled with mana.Clang! Clang! Claaaaang!Zich\u2019s hands swung madly. Something kept roughly hitting his hands and bouncing off. However, Zich couldn\u2019t block all the attacks, and soon, his body was wounded from head to toe. Sword fragments were hitting Zich. After using the skill, \u2018Burning Sword,\u2019 his sword had lost durability; so, when he poured a great amount of mana into it and clashed it with a magic fireball, it broke into pieces as he had expected.\u2018Let me see.\u2019Zich landed on the ground and wiped his stinging wounds. Then, he looked at the silver-haired woman.\u2018It doesn\u2019t seem like that had much of an effect.\u2019He was disappointed. But this didn\u2019t mean the silver-haired woman was completely fine. There was a semi-transparent wall in front of her; but behind the wall, she was spilling blood from all over her body. It seemed she had evaded Zich\u2019s sword at the last moment, but her injuries were clearly worse than Zich\u2019s.Her red eyes glared at Zich.\u2018Woah. She\u2019s angry.\u2019But Zich wasn\u2019t scared at all. Instead, he smiled wider for her to see; for him, his opponent\u2019s rage brought happiness and their despair brought joy to him.\u201cLala! Lastel!\u201dWing!A small magic circle formed in her hands. In front of it, two icicles appeared and shot towards Zich.\u2018Wow. Ice elements now?\u2019His opponent might really be a magician who had mastered all the elements. Zich scowled.\u2018Since the situation was urgent and my sword lost its durability, I threw my sword away\u2014but it\u2019s definitely uncomfortable to not have a sword.\u2019But Zich was also familiar with bare-handed martial arts. He gripped both of his fists tightly and dashed towards the silver-haired woman.Whoosh!He evaded the flying icicles. The silver-haired woman prepared her next spell.\u201cUgh!\u201d She raised her arms and scowled.\u201cHuh?\u201dIt was only for a moment, but her movements were awkward\u2014unfortunately for Zich, it was for a very short moment.\u201cRyde! Well! Crohn!\u201dA gigantic gust of wind came upon Zich.\u201cHu-ah!\u201d Zich fiercely spun mana around his body and collided with the gust of wind.Boom!The impact made such a commotion that it was hard to believe that the sound had been made by a person moving against the wind.\u2018Damn, it hurts!\u2019He succeeded in piercing through the gust of wind, but the injuries on his body increased. And he didn\u2019t have time to drink more potions. Zich dashed towards the silver-haired woman again. Their battle intensified. After losing his sword, Zich swung his fist around and the silver-haired woman shot out magic attacks.Crash!Zich smashed the stone spears that shot up from the ground and spat.\u2018There is something strange about her.\u2019The silver-haired woman\u2019s abilities were strange. Both her magic skills and combat senses were impressive, and she perfectly grasped what spell she should use in each scenario to place Zich into the most difficult spot. Yet, the movements she made in between the attacks were very awkward. A magician skilled and used to battles like her should be able to react immediately, but there was a slight delay after every attack she made.\u2018If she really did regress, this wouldn\u2019t be strange\u2026\u2019Zich had been like her when he first battled at Steelwall. It was the result of the difference between his overflowing battle experiences and lacking physicality. Although what Zich had done was close to impossible, it didn\u2019t mean that no other person would be able to do the same.\u2018But it\u2019s too severe.\u2019Rather than having a mismatch between experiences and physicality, she moved as if \u2018her experiences\u2019 had been artificially programmed into her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It didn\u2019t match up to her fighting prowess.Even now, she was sweating like a waterfall from the wound Zich just inflicted on her, to the extent that it was hard for her to move.\u2018Should I try to force information out of her?\u2019To be frank, Zich was much more curious about the silver-haired woman than Ms. Bargot, who was already dead. On the other hand, Zich\u2019s situation was too dangerous for him to force information out of his opponent like usual.\u2018If only I had my sword.\u2019It had been an unavoidable sacrifice; moreover, he was able to severely injure her by destroying his sword. On the other hand, Zich\u2019s battle power was also clearly compromised. But he was not going to lose.\u201cSir Zich!\u201dZich suddenly sensed a group of people coming towards him, and a person called out to Zich.\u2018It\u2019s Sir Brod.\u2019Brod had left Joachim in a safe place and was bringing a group of knights to him. Hans was with them.\u201cAre you alright!\u201d Seeing Zich\u2019s injury, Brod shouted out to him with concern.Zich waved his hands to show that he was alright. Brod and his soldiers were relieved that Zich\u2019s injury was not very serious; however, their relief lasted only for a moment. Brod began to gauge Zich\u2019s situation. The situation was completely different from what he expected.\u201c\u2026What kind of situation is this?\u201d\u201cHmmm. I also wonder what kind of situation this is.\u201d Even Zich laughed at the surprising development of circumstances. \u201cSir Brod, can I first hear how your situation went?\u201d\u201cAh, we were successful in putting Sir Joachim in a safe place. Sir Joachim asked us to fight as loud as possible in our battle with Ms. Bargot to alert citizens of Ospurin about the danger and encourage them to quickly make their escape.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s reasonable. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary anymore. That woman in front of us killed Ms. Bargot.\u201d\u201cKilled Ms. Bargot?\u201dZich pointed towards Ms. Bargot\u2019s corpse with his finger. A monster\u2019s corpse with only its upper body was rolling on the ground. People\u2019s eyes widened as they saw it.\u201c\u2026You are saying that the woman in front of us made Ms. Bargot like that?\u201d\u201cYes, with just one hit.\u201d\u201cShe was able to defeat that Ms. Bargot in one hit?\u201d\u201cWell, it was a surprise attack, but even considering that, it\u2019s an amazing feat. She\u2019s an extremely powerful magician.\u201d\u201cA magician\u2026\u201dAll of Zich\u2019s words were unbelievable. Brod swallowed his saliva and stared at the silver-haired woman in front of him. If they were not in such a serious situation, he would have been dazed by her beauty. But as a \u2018magician who killed Ms. Bargot with one hit,\u2019 her beauty didn\u2019t even register in Brod\u2019s mind.\u201cI don\u2019t really understand the situation, but are you saying that she is our enemy?\u201d\u201cI would definitely say\u2026\u201d Zich murmured the rest of his words. Brod and the knights, as well as the silver-haired woman, all stared at him.\u201c\u2026Now that I think about it, I was the one who attacked first.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Brod\u2019s piercing eyes stung the back of Zich\u2019s head.Even the silver-haired woman stared at Zich with wide eyes. Zich was also embarrassed and scratched his head. \u2018It was because I was so shocked by her words\u2026\u2019 He never imagined that he would meet someone who knew him as \u2018Zich Moore,\u2019 so some of his old personality came back to him. But now that he thought about it, he had no reason to make her his enemy yet.\u2018She defeated Ms. Bargot for us, and all she did was call me \u2018Zich Moore.\u2019 There\u2019s no reason for me to attack her yet.\u2019On the other hand, he was the one who instigated the fight. Zich raised his hand. \u201cHey! This was definitely my mistake! I apologize!\u201dHowever, they had fought too intensely to go like, \u2018Hey, we misunderstood each other, so let\u2019s stop fighting and end this!\u2019 Moreover, it didn\u2019t change the fact that she was a suspicious person.\u201cIf you want, I can give you compensation, but you should first reveal your identity! Since you entered the castle without permission, you also have some liability.\u201dIt was especially suspicious that she entered the castle when they were in the midst of an intense conspiracy. At Zich\u2019s words, the knights looked back at the silver-haired woman and kept up their guard.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat, are you not going to reply? To be specific, I\u2019m only apologizing for attacking you first without listening to your circumstances. As you can tell, I\u2019m a collaborator of the Dracul estate. If you continue to keep your identity a secret, I also have no choice but to use force against you. Then you would be considered a criminal of the Dracul estate for sure.\u201dThe knights began surrounding the area to support Zich\u2019s statements. Only then did the silver-haired woman finally open her mouth.\u201c\u2026Are they your underlings?\u201d\u201cHave you not been listening to me at all? I\u2019m a collaborator. Answer my question first. Under ordinary circumstances, we would have to capture you without question since you trespassed into the castle. However, since we are in a difficult time, and you killed that being over there without causing harm to the surrounding areas, we are trying to peacefully mediate this situation.\u201d\u2018Even though I did attack you first.\u2019However, Zich really was acting much more peacefully than usual. If his opponent rejected his offer after he went this far to be polite, he\u2019d really use all his skills to defeat her. But contrary to his expectations, the silver-haired woman looked surprised by his words. Her mouth was slightly open.\u201c\u2026You care about harming your surroundings? You?\u201d\u2018Shit, this person seems to have really known me before I regressed.\u2019Then it was understandable that she would be so shocked by that sentence. Now, there was even more reason to listen to what she had to say. However, Brod interrupted him before he could say anything more.\u201cYou wench! What\u2019s up with your manners!\u201d Brod was so furious that blood vessels bulged out of his neck. \u201cSir Zich worked tirelessly for the benefit of our estate! He uncovered an evil conspiracy and saved countless people! All while not caring about receiving anything at all!\u201dAlthough Zich showed some heartlessness by prioritizing Ms. Bargot\u2019s death over all the citizens of Ospurin, he had not been in the wrong. If seen in a favorable light, his choice could be considered decisive and rational.\u201cHow dare you insult such a person? How dare you question his concerns for not causing harm to the surrounding areas? A suspicious magician like you who trespassed illegally into the castle has no right to talk like that to Sir Zich!\u201dBrod\u2019s furious outcries rained down upon the silver-haired woman. However, it was Zich who was shocked by Brod\u2019s fury.\u2018What the hell is wrong with him?\u2019Did he eat something wrong? Or did he get one of Ms. Bargot\u2019s rare diseases? Even though Lubella and Weig had thanked him before, it was the first time Zich received such outlandish \u2018praise\u2019 for doing his version of kind acts. However, because of the kind acts he did, everyone in the Dracul estate treated Zich like a \u2018saint.\u2019 And even among these people, Brod, who had accompanied Zich since the beginning of his arrival at the estate, admired Zich more than anyone else.In short, Brod knew everything Zich did for the Dracul estate. That was why Brod even changed the way he addressed Zich by attaching \u201cSir\u201d to Zich\u2019s name. Besides, Brod didn\u2019t seem to be the only one who felt this way, as all the other knights looked at the silver-haired woman with rage and caution.\u201c\u2026Are you really Zich?\u201d The silver-haired lady seemed to have fallen into a state of confusion.\u201cYeah, I\u2019m Zich.\u201d\u201c\u2026What\u2019s your last name?\u201d\u201cIs that important?\u201dHis last name was no longer Steelwall or Moore. He was simply Zich now.\u201cI don\u2019t know how much you know, but the image of me that you are thinking of right now doesn\u2019t represent me.\u201d Zich was no longer the Steelwall\u2019s eldest son or a Demon Lord in any shape or form. The lady stared at Zich suspiciously, but soon, she looked like she realized something.\u201cIs it?!\u201d She placed her hands on her lips. Her gaze, which had observed him like a mysterious creature, changed; her eyes had so much hostility in them that the knights watching from behind backed off. Yet, there was also a certain sadness in her eyes as if she dearly missed someone. Of course, Zich sensed the change in her gaze.\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t understand her at all.\u201dHe had received so many hostile gazes in his lifetime, but it was his first time meeting someone who also looked sentimental at the same time. Furthermore, her emotions didn\u2019t feel shallow.She muttered, \u201c\u2026But it\u2019s different from that.\u201d\u2018She has no intention of talking to me at all.\u2019Zich realized that trying to talk to her any longer was going to be a waste of time. Zich pulled out a potion and drank it. Then, he borrowed a sword from a knight. Although the knight looked taken aback, he willingly lent his sword to Zich.\u201cOkay, miss. I didn\u2019t want to use such a rough method. But if you keep acting so uncooperative, I can no longer just ask you on a date.\u201dThe silver-haired lady retorted, \u201cYeah, and I already said that is definitely not the right way to ask me out on a date,\u201d but Zich ignored her this time and pointed his sword at her.\u201cI will treat you as a suspicious intruder who trespassed into the castle.\u201dAs soon as Zich showed his hostility, the knights followed suit.The silver-haired lady looked around her surroundings. Fighting Zich alone had kept her hands full, but if the knights came into the picture, it seemed like she had no chance of winning. The lady was aware of this and stared at Zich again. Their eyes locked, as they tried to figure out each other\u2019s existence and thoughts.Slam!Zich moved first. Mana seeped into his sword and made ringing noises, and knights charged at her simultaneously.Clink!A metallic sound chimed near her chest. As if a brilliant star was formed into a jewel, the blue necklace around her neck shone.\u2018An artifact!\u2019He didn\u2019t know what it was, but it was obvious that nothing good would come out of it. Zich stretched out his sword to use \u2018Piercing Space.\u2019Tang!Air filled with mana flew out like arrows. The moment the intangible force was about to reach her\u2014Whoosh!The silver-haired woman disappeared. The piercing force flew out futilely and left a large mark on the wall.\u201cThis is\u2026!\u201d Brod ran to where the silver-haired woman was. He looked around and even tried scraping the dirt ground with his feet. However, her presence was nowhere to be found.\u201cIt\u2019s teleportation.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Brod was surprised by Zich\u2019s words. \u201cI thought teleportation was an incredibly difficult magic.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s true.\u201dIt was magic of the highest difficulty that only specially chosen magicians could use. Zich confirmed Brod\u2019s words, so Brod became even more surprised.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that she was such an amazing magician!\u201d\u201cWhile it\u2019s true that she is an amazing magician, it doesn\u2019t seem like she completed the teleportation magic by herself. She didn\u2019t say a spell before she teleported.\u201dIf she had used Silent Incantation, her magic\u2019s power would have been lower, and she wouldn\u2019t have been able to go very far. However, the woman\u2019s presence had perfectly disappeared from Zich\u2019s sphere of sensing.\u201cIf she didn\u2019t do it\u2026\u201d\u201cHer necklace was probably an artifact.\u201dBrod recalled how the silver-haired lady\u2019s necklace had shone. \u201cWhat? She had an artifact that allows users to teleport! How could such a thing exist?!\u201d\u201cBut didn\u2019t you see it for yourself?\u201d However, Zich also understood Brod\u2019s surprise. \u2018I mean, making an artifact with the highest level of magic like teleportation would consume an immense amount of money and effort. It\u2019s understandable why he can\u2019t believe that such an item could exist.\u2019Well, that was that.\u201cWe will send a squad to pursue the magician.\u201d\u201cIt will be difficult to do that. We don\u2019t even know which direction she teleported to. It would be a waste of time.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf we have nothing else to do, we could do that. But don\u2019t we have to take care of the aftermath of this situation in the estate?\u201d\u201cUghhh!\u201d Brod groaned at the dilemma in front of him, but he knew Zich was right. From now on, the Dracul estate would have to maintain a state of emergency, and they would need all the labor force they could possibly use. Sending a squad to look for a mysterious magician who they barely had any information about would be a complete waste of human resources.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped.\u201d Brod gave up on finding her.\u201cYou made the right decision.\u201d Zich complimented Brod and spoke while looking around his surroundings. \u201cEverything is over now that both Ms. Bargot and Shalom, who did all the plotting, are dead. Let\u2019s clean up.\u201dLike that, the affair that had turned the Dracul estate upside down with diseases, guilt, and madness came to an end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA bell rang over a large temple spire. It was the last sound of farewell to people who passed away. The people of Ospurin said that every soul who heard the sound of that bell would leave all regrets, anger, and lingering feelings behind in the mortal realm to enter the land of the gods where they would be judged.\u201cFather and elder brother probably won\u2019t go to heaven.\u201d Joachim said out loud as he watched the bell and its sound fading away.The vassals next to him could not reply. Under ordinary circumstances, it would have been basic manners for them to deny Joachim\u2019s words since they were addressed towards the former head of the estate and his son.However, since they found out about the Count\u2019s heinous actions, they could no longer support or speak favorably of him. Moreover, Biyom Dracul\u2019s personality had always been complete shit, so there was nothing to speak favorably about him anyways.But Brod couldn\u2019t stand the silence so he spoke a few words. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m sure they will repent their actions. They are probably ready for it.\u201d\u201cRepent\u2026it\u2019s a must. No matter how much suffering and pain follow them, they have to repent. But first, I wish they\u2019ll apologize to all their victims in the afterlife.\u201d\u201cThey will. Definitely.\u201dCount Dracul and Biyom Dracul were unable to overcome their diseases and eventually passed away. Today was their funeral. Even though it was a joint funeral for the Count and his heir, the size of the funeral was small, to the point that it was shabby. However, considering the situation of the estate and the Count\u2019s past actions, they had no choice but to hold the funeral in this manner.\u201cThank you for attending, Mr. Zich.\u201d Joachim, who was greeting each of the attendees at the funeral, made a small bow towards Zich.Since the size of the funeral was very small, Joachim only invited the minimum number of people; Zich\u2019s presence at the funeral indicated how much Joachim trusted and respected him.\u201cOf course. It\u2019s not even a difficult task.\u201d\u201cI also want to send the two of you my regards.\u201d Joachim also slightly bowed towards Snoc and Hans who were standing next to Zich.\u201cAh, ah, no! It\u2019s f-fine!\u201d\u201cAh, I s-send my c-condolences!\u201dAs a previous servant of a noble and a common miner, Hans and Snoc felt that attending an aristocrat\u2019s funeral and receiving the heir\u2019s bow was strange to the point of being frightening. They were both startled and frantically tried to return Joachim\u2019s bow. In an aristocrat\u2019s eye, their behavior would have looked very awkward, even impudent. However, no one, including Joachim, criticized their behavior. Only Zich looked at them as if they were pathetic.\u201cI heard that the three of you will be leaving soon.\u201dZich answered, \u201cWe were only stopping by the Dracul estate for a bit while traveling. We stayed longer than we planned, so we have to start moving again.\u201d\u201cDo you really have no plans to join us here? I assure you that you will be given the best treatment here.\u201dEven while reorganizing the estate, Joachim continuously tried to scout Zich and his companions. During the time they were together, Zich showed his ability to quickly assess the situation, his extensive knowledge, and great fighting prowess; moreover, all the times he saved and helped the estate was more than enough to make him the number one person Joachim wanted to scout. Zich was also young, so he had even more potential in the future.However, Zich was firm in his reply. \u201cI don\u2019t like being stuck in one place.\u201dAs always, Zich refused with the same answer. At this point, even Joachim had already given up halfway, so his disappointment was minimal.\u201cEven without me, the Dracul estate won\u2019t have many problems. There are many people such as Sir Brod who are supporting you. Ah, I can\u2019t address you as a young master anymore since you are going to be the new Count Dracul soon.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still not comfortable with that title. Moreover, it will take an extremely long time and effort to get the King\u2019s approval.\u201d\u201cWill you reveal that about the Count?\u201dThat. It was an ambiguous phrase, but everyone knew what Zich meant. All of Joachim\u2019s vassals and supporters looked downcast. However, there was no trace of hesitation on Joachim\u2019s face.\u201cOf course. Even though it was done in the name of saving our estate, my father\u2019s actions can never be forgiven. I have to start remedying those wrongs. I have to repent and give due compensation and trial to the vassals who planned and participated in my father\u2019s crimes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be a very difficult task.\u201d\u201cBut I still have to do it. My father justified his awful crimes by saying that he did it for the estate, but in the end, his actions led to an existence like Fest and eventually brought more chaos and destruction into the estate. It\u2019s ironic if you think about it.\u201d\u201cFrom the first place, Fest was a mad person with a rotten nature.\u201d\u201cBut before my father spread infectious diseases to the Bargot Trading House, she was a normal lady of the house. You never know. If diseases had never struck her family, she might have reached the end of her life without ever realizing this part about herself and be known as a good wife and mother.\u201d\u201cYou are planning to also take on Fest\u2019s sins upon your shoulders.\u201d\u201cThat is the biggest reason why I want to inherit the Dracul estate.\u201dThe path was bound to be full of thorns and suffering, but Joachim willingly volunteered to walk this thorny path filled with suffering and pain.\u201cJust a couple of weeks ago, I wanted to leave my family and travel around like you, Sir Zich, but now I\u2019m about to inherit the Dracul estate\u2026You really never know what will happen in life.\u201dMoreover, he was now receiving the full support of all his vassals. It was unimaginable that he used to be treated like a burden to the family a couple of days ago.\u201cThen your hemophobia will hamper you a lot.\u201d\u201c\u2026I will work hard to overcome it.\u201dHowever, Joachim\u2019s complexion was already starting to look pale.\u201cFortunately, I had a lot of practice this time around, and even though I saw a lot of blood this time, it was endurable.\u201d\u201cBut I heard that you fainted as soon as the battle ended.\u201dJoachim hesitated. His hemophobia was a significant issue. Despite his abilities and talents, the only reasons why Biyom could steadfastly hold his position as heir were because of tradition and Joachim\u2019s frail constitution and hemophobia.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try using this?\u201d Zich took out something from his pocket.\u201cThat\u2026!\u201dJoachim\u2019s eyes became wide. He had seen that object before; it was the red marble that the leader of the assassins had tempted him with.\u201cBlood Vessel.\u201d\u201cI saw this rolling around on the ground by chance.\u201dZich\u2019s smile was completely shameless. His servants, Hans and Snoc (especially Snoc), seemed like they had a lot to say, but even till the end, they didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d\u201cIf you are asking me about what or where it came from, or who made it, I don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I know its abilities and side effects.\u201d Since he heard it directly from Joachim before he regressed, Zich was sure of his information about the Blood Vessel.\u201c\u2026You really have a lot of strange and mysterious knowledge.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m happy to help people using my knowledge.\u201dBy his reply, it seemed as if Zich was not going to tell him where he got his information from. But Joachim did not deeply pry into the matter.\u201cWhat is its ability?\u201d\u201cIt makes your body healthy and helps you overcome your hemophobia. But most of all, you get a power called \u2018Blood Domination.\u2019\u201d\u201cBlood Domination. It doesn\u2019t sound too good.\u201d\u201cAs the name implies, it lets you control people\u2019s blood according to your will. It\u2019s an extremely powerful skill.\u201dWith that ability alone, Joachim had become one of the four subordinates of \u2018The Demon Lord of Strength, Zich Moore.\u2019 But Joachim scrunched his face after hearing that he would gain the ability to control blood.\u201c\u2026Other than Blood Domination, everything else sounds extremely attractive to me. Then what is the side effect?\u201d\u201cYou will become crazy for blood.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJoachim pursed his lips. The people around him also looked at Zich with surprise.\u201c\u2026That wasn\u2019t a clear explanation, although it sounded rather negative. Could you explain it to me in more detail please?\u201d\u201cTo say it simply, it\u2019s like becoming a vampire. You are going to become a monster who will do anything to see blood.\u201dBefore his regression, Zich thought that Joachim\u2019s love for blood was innate. However, the present Joachim was an ordinary human who hated blood much more than most people.When the past Joachim explained to Zich that his love for blood came from the Blood Vessel, Zich had brushed it off as nonsense\u2014but now, Zich realized that Joachim had been telling him the truth.\u201c\u2026But Mr. Zich, there must be a solution to that issue, right?\u201d Joachim still trusted Zich, so he asked calmly; but if Zich had offered him the \u2018Blood Vessel\u2019 thoughtlessly, he was going to get angry.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. When you absorb it, you won\u2019t feel a great thirst for blood at first. Maybe not at all. But as you use your powers more and more, things will change.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying that my desire for blood will increase as I use more power.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t matter if you use your own blood. But of course, if you use too much of your blood, you will die. Thus, you will only be able to utilize your power to the maximum if you use other people\u2019s blood. However, the more you handle other people\u2019s blood, the desire for blood will increase until it eventually consumes you.\u201d\u201cTo what extent?\u201dZich recalled how Joachim was before his regression. \u201cI think you may reach a point where you would want to kill a bunch of people to just bathe in their blood.\u201dAn eerie silence filled the whole area. People looked at the Blood Vessel that Zich was holding with fear, and some gulped their dried-up saliva back down.Joachim fell into contemplation; in his mind, he balanced the scale between risk and return and thought about what decision he should make.\u201c\u2026If I start to crave blood, it will cause great chaos.\u201d\u201cAre you worried that you would be consumed by your desire for blood and cause chaos in the world?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help but worry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. I\u2019m not someone who will turn a blind eye to something I suggested.\u201dJoachim asked hopefully, \u201cIs there some kind of way?\u201dHowever, Hans knew that Zich probably wouldn\u2019t give Joachim a normal answer.\u201cIf you become corrupt, I will personally come to kill you.\u201dHis response was extreme. Hans and Snoc stared at Zich in shock, but Joachim laughed.\u201cHaha! I see. I\u2019m glad to have a foolproof, preventive measure like you.\u201dSurprisingly, Joachim looked pleased, and his eyes landed on the Blood Vessel.\u201cAlright. Let me accept your favor.\u201dJoachim ended up absorbing the Blood Vessel as he had done so before Zich\u2019s regression, yet there was a low probability that he would abuse his power and cause havoc all around the world like before. Zich had changed Joachim\u2019s past which led him into becoming a vampire.* * *Not long afterward, Joachim officially announced his position to inherit the Dracul estate. No one protested Joachim\u2019s succession, but what he did after that stirred up not only the estate but the whole kingdom\u2014he revealed all the immoral misdeeds his father, the previous Count, had committed.As expected, they received all kinds of criticism and insults, and public sentiment turned sour. Still, the new Count Dracul completed the tasks he had to do calmly and efficiently.\u201cHaa!\u201d Joachim sat in Count Dracul\u2019s office and sighed.He placed down the document he was holding and looked up at the ceiling. There was a mountain of documents in front of him, and there were a lot more unattended documents piled on the opposite side of him.Knock! Knock!\u201cCome in.\u201d Joachim muttered quietly because he was still not used to talking informally. When he saw Brod come in with an armful of documents, Joachim sighed.Brod commented, \u201cYou seem tired, sir.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m confident that if I lay down on a bed right now, I will wake up the next afternoon in one blink.\u201d\u201cStill, isn\u2019t this what you wanted to do, sir?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to remind me. I\u2019m doing all this work without complaining because I know that.\u201d\u201cFufu! But it\u2019s fortunate that the Blood Vessel seems to be having an effect.\u201dJoachim placed his hand on his head. He felt exhausted, but it was understandable, considering all the work he was doing right now.\u201cIf it were like before, I would have collapsed onto the bed by now.\u201d\u201cI am happy to see how healthy you\u2019ve become, sir.\u201d\u201cReally? Isn\u2019t it because you are happy that you can continue to make me work?\u201d\u201cForgive your unfaithful servant, as I am unable to deny that claim.\u201dThen, Brod took the documents he brought and placed them on top of the document pile. Joachim groaned as the mountain pile of documents grew even higher.\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would miss the time when I used to be sickly.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cBut you really did become healthy. To the extent that you are able to complete these types of duties.\u201dBrod laughed out loud. He was extremely happy that Joachim, whom he had served all his life, was now completely healthy. But soon, he erased the smile off his face and said with a serious expression, \u201cHow is your craving for blood?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I was also really worried about that, but I don\u2019t have any cravings rights now. Right now, it\u2019s to the extent that I just want a quick snack once a week; and this hunger also quickly disappears. As long as I don\u2019t control other people\u2019s blood, I think I will be fine.\u201dJoachim bit his thumb. A thin trail of blood dripped down his fingers. However, the trail of blood suddenly changed its path and slowly floated in the air. Then it spread around and the blood droplets began moving.\u201cIt\u2019s a strange ability whenever I look at it.\u201d\u201cI feel the same way even though I\u2019m the one controlling it.\u201dThis was the Blood Vessel\u2019s ability: \u2018Blood Domination.\u2019\u201cSir, you are getting better at controlling it.\u201d\u201cI thought I should at least have the power to protect myself. Since Sir Zich said there are no side effects to controlling my own blood, I\u2019ve been practicing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bad to have a secret weapon at your disposal. No, it\u2019s really good that you have it. However, sir, you have to be careful to not get consumed by the power.\u201d\u201cYes, if that happens, the super scary Mr. Zich will come to kill me.\u201dBrod smirked at Joachim\u2019s reply. \u201cYes, the super scary Mr. Zich will come back. I wonder if he\u2019s out of the estate by now.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Since he is a free spirit, he might stay a bit longer, or he might have left a while ago.\u201d\u201cIf I think about it, he never revealed his identity.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we have to find out his identity. He\u2019s a hero who saved our estate. In this estate, that\u2019s the only status we should be concerned about.\u201d\u201cYes, you are right.\u201d\u201cAnyways\u2026\u201dThe easygoing atmosphere as they talked about Zich suddenly grew heavy and dark. Joachim\u2019s face became serious.\u201cWere you able to find their identities?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately\u2026\u201d Brod put his head down in apology. However, Joachim did not blame him.\u201cEven though Shalom was working with them, those bastards moved around the estate without anyone noticing. If we discover their identities this fast, we have to seriously consider that it might be a trap.\u201dWhile reorganizing and fixing the Dracul estate, they set aside a small number of resources to find information about the assassination organization. However, as expected, it was hard to investigate and find any information about them.\u201cThe estate\u2019s recovery is our top priority right now. We shouldn\u2019t be anxious if we can\u2019t find any traces of them. That\u2019s the same for the silver-haired woman.\u201dThe estate was also tracking the mysterious and beautiful woman who suddenly appeared and killed Ms. Bargot and then disappeared. She didn\u2019t cause any direct harm to the Dracul estate; instead, she could be considered a benefactor as she defeated Ms. Bargot before Ms. Bargot could harm the surrounding areas. However, it didn\u2019t change the fact that the silver-haired woman was extremely suspicious.\u201cI will keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cAre there any more situations to report?\u201d\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\u201cThen you are dismissed.\u201dJoachim returned to his mountain pile of reports and documents on his desk. Brod bowed and left the room. From the mountain of documents, Joachim picked out a document from its peak. No matter how heavy the workload was, it was impossible for the meticulous and hardworking Joachim to sloppily do his work. He began reading through the document. His eyes fervently moved as he scrolled down. But after reading five lines, Joachim put down the document. He looked to the side and saw the moon shining through his window sill.\u2018I guess I don\u2019t have the side effect where I turn into a monster during the full moon or something like that.\u2019At this random thought, Joachim smirked and looked at the moon. His situation was completely different from when he last looked up at the moon. In the past, he could only imagine a future where he escaped his family and traveled around the world with his fragile body; but now, he had a healthy body, and even though there were a lot of dangers and tribulations for him to overcome, he was the master of a noble family.\u2018It\u2019s largely thanks to Mr. Zich.\u2019If it hadn\u2019t been for Zich, he would have died at Biyom or Shalom\u2019s hands, or become a monster after being tricked by the assassin.\u2018If something happens to him, I have to fully repay him.\u2019Joachim would never forget his debt to Zich. After making a solemn promise to himself, Joachim moved his eyes away from the moon and went back to the document he was holding.* * *At the same time, Zich was also looking at the moon. The blistering heat of the bonfire contested the moonlight, but the moon\u2019s subtle and gracious light firmly held up against the blazing light of the fire.Several days had passed since they left the Dracul estate. They went back to their crazy routine where they just powered through the forest without following any paths. In contrast, Zich leisurely looked up at the moon as if he had not gone through much trouble.But that was only Zich.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cArgh\u2026\u201dHans and Snoc lay flat on the ground; only their faint groans indicated that they were alive.Koo\u2026Nowem also laid flat on Snoc\u2019s back. If anyone saw them right now, they would have been mistaken for zombies. Zich clicked his tongue.\u201cDid I let you guys play around in Ospurin too much? Next time, I should at least make the two of you do basic training\u2026\u201d\u201cI-I am all right!\u201d Hans quickly lifted his body up.Snoc, while hugging Nowem, also quickly got up and straightened his back. They moved so fast; it was hard to imagine that they had been lying down on the floor while groaning just a second ago.Zich smirked. \u201cRest easy. I was just joking.\u201dHans and Snoc glanced at each other. However, judging by Zich\u2019s smirk, it didn\u2019t seem like Zich was lying. The two repressed their anger at Zich for making such a frightening joke and lay on the floor again.\u201cThere\u2019s discontentment written right on your faces!\u201d\u201cT-That can\u2019t be, sir!\u201d\u201cYes, yes! We don\u2019t have any complaints!\u201dWith pale complexions, the two denied his claims, and Zich chuckled.\u201cBut the training definitely has an effect. You both must have realized it from the battle this time.\u201d As Zich said, they had both performed brilliantly; Hans had assisted Zich by his side while Snoc had fought against the leader of the assassins by himself.\u201cOf course, you guys are still lacking.\u201d Zich\u2019s eyes turned cold. \u201cYou guys should at least have the skills to fight the leader of the assassins from last time.\u201d\u201cB-But sir, I beat that man.\u201dKoo!Snoc quietly asserted his opinion, and Nowem supported him. Snoc had gained some confidence after fighting the leader of the assassins by himself.\u201cFine. Then, the next time we meet someone similar to that assassin leader, I will offer them to you again. But in return, you won\u2019t have the advantage of being underground.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Snoc closed his mouth.\u201cSeriously, what are you going on about? You barely managed to beat that guy even after you collapsed the whole basement. You should only talk big when you can beat a guy like that even above ground.\u201dIn response, Snoc slumped his head on his blanket, and likewise, Nowem placed his face on Snoc\u2019s back. But Zich\u2019s sharp words weren\u2019t only aimed at Snoc.\u201cHans, it\u2019s the same for you too. Even if Snoc has a cheat-like companion like Nowem, you went through a longer training period than Snoc. Are you planning to let your junior catch up to you already?\u201dZich tried to pull out Hans\u2019 competitive spirit by scratching at his pride. Hans also didn\u2019t feel too comfortable about his junior progressing ahead of him, but at the moment, he had a greater concern than that.\u201cSir Zich.\u201d\u201cWhy? Do you want to ask me something?\u201d\u201cWhat you said before\u2014you know, how you said that you would prioritize defeating Ms. Bargot above the lives of everyone in Ospurin\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still thinking about that?\u201d Zich bent one of his knees and raised his arms to put more wood into the fire. The bonfire let out sparks that chased away the darkness for a few seconds and then disappeared.\u201cYou\u2019re not satisfied with the answer I gave you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Hans didn\u2019t reply, but Zich could guess what he was thinking.\u201cYou can understand my reasoning with your mind, but it\u2019s difficult to accept it with your heart, right? I understand. Most people wouldn\u2019t be able to ignore the people right in front of them no matter how many more lives they could save in the future. But Hans\u2014\u201dUnlike usual, Zich talked seriously without teasing him. \u201cEven if your decision leads to an unexpected outcome, you have to make a decision if you are given a choice. Especially if you want to be a hero.\u201d\u201cI-If you are a hero, shouldn\u2019t you try to solve the situation without sacrificing anyone?!\u201dHans was too immature, and he didn\u2019t know enough of the world yet. It was enough to make listeners frustrated, but Zich\u2019s attitude didn\u2019t change.\u201cDo you want to become a hero or a god?\u201dEven the amazing Demon Lord of Strength, Zich Moore had failed to live the life he wanted, and it was probably the same for the Sun Hero, Glen Zenard who had beaten him.\u201cEven a super genius like me couldn\u2019t achieve everything I wanted. It will be the same in the future too. No matter how amazing a person is, as long as they are \u2018human,\u2019 they can\u2019t do everything they want.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, I guess you can\u2019t accept this right away.\u201dZich understood Hans\u2019 silence.\u201cThink about it carefully. But don\u2019t hesitate so much that you can\u2019t decide on anything. It\u2019s better to make the wrong decision than not make one at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sir Zich, do you really think that I can be a hero?\u201dEven though Zich teased Hans about his dreams from time to time, Zich was really teaching him how to become a hero. Hans thought Zich was making fun of him at first, but he soon realized that there was some sincerity behind his light-hearted attitude.\u201cWhatever, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Zich stomped the little bit of expectation rising in Hans\u2019 heart without a care in the world.However, it was Zich\u2019s first time talking about Hans\u2019 possibility of becoming a hero in a realistic tone, so Hans continued to listen. And Snoc also listened to their conversation with a sparkle in his eyes.\u201cIf you want to become one, you should. You are the one who decides the way you\u2019re going to live. You don\u2019t have to consider what other people think about your dreams. A hero? You should go for it. Since you are my servant, I will do everything within my means to help you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then, can I ask you one more question, sir?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dHans spoke while thinking that he might get scolded for making Zich repeat his words so many times. \u201cYou know the decision you talked about, sir\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dAs Hans spoke nervously, Zich listened without giving much of a reaction.\u201cWas there a way to save a few\u2026just a few more people?\u201d\u201cThere was.\u201dBoth Hans and Snoc\u2019s eyes turned wide.\u201cIt\u2019s simple. Do you know why I asked you if you wanted to become a god? If you have a power like a god\u2019s, even the most difficult things will become simple. If you think like that, the best way to overcome a crisis is to become stronger. The higher your skills and powers are, you\u2019ll be able to save more people and you\u2019ll be able to solve more problems.\u201d\u201cSo, what you are saying is\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you to train harder.\u201dDrop!Hans heard something drop, and he looked back to see that Snoc had stuck his face into his blankets again. It was funny to see how Nowem also took the same pose as Snoc on his back. Then, Hans thought about Zich\u2019s training, which was on the verge of torture, and grew pale; but as he despaired about the upcoming, harsh training in the future, he etched Zich\u2019s words deep into his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhile Hans and Snoc were lost in their own thoughts, Zich thought back to their recent battle and organized all the new information he learned inside his mind.\u2018Well, now I know for sure that the assassin organization is trying to make Demon People. Just finding out that information has made this event meaningful.\u2019Zich was able to find one possible way to reach the assassin group. He could start searching for places where Demon People would appear and slowly extract more information from every group of assassins he met, and as he snuffed out more and more information, he could eventually reach their headquarters.\u2018When that time comes, I have to rip them apart.\u2019Zich didn\u2019t know how big the main organization was, but during his peak, he was called the \u2018Demon Lord of Strength.\u2019 He had strong confidence in his ability to bite down on his opponents. Like a hound, he was going to pierce through their armor, rip apart their muscles, chop their intestines, and smell the sweet aroma of their insides.\u2018I now have a basic vision of what I will do to them.\u2019But when his thought moved to the next topic\u2014the silver-haired lady who had clearly called him \u2018Zich Moore\u2019\u2014even Zich was slightly troubled.\u2018I should assume that she knew me before I regressed.\u2019Then how did she know him? The first thought that came into his mind was that she was also a regressor. If he thought like this, it would not be strange for her to know his name, and her mastery, especially considering her youthful appearance, was not surprising. It would also make sense that compared to her skills, she didn\u2019t seem used to fighting.\u2018Then who is she?\u2019 Zich tried to recall someone who had the same appearance and skills as the silver-haired woman before he regressed. \u2018Well first, I can\u2019t recall anyone who looked like her.\u2019There was no way Zich would not be able to remember an inhumanely beautiful person like her.\u2018Considering her abilities, she seems similar to the Demon Lord of Magic\u2026\u2019In the time of the Demon People, the Demon Lord of Magic appeared at the end of the Era of the Demon People and was one of the Demon Lords with Zich. As his title implied, the Demon Lord of Magic freely used all kinds of magic and also fought with Zich a few times.\u2018But that\u2019s not it. The Demon Lord of Magic is a man.\u2019A wrinkly old man with a long, white beard\u2014that was the Demon Lord of Magic whom Zich was familiar with. The Demon Lord of Magic was completely different from the silver-haired woman.\u2018There\u2019s no one that pops into my mind. She seems like someone I\u2019ve never met before.\u2019It was not as if Zich knew every Demon Person, and she may not have even been a Demon Person. It was not strange that there was someone Zich did not know.\u2018I should think about her later after I get some more information.\u2019There was too little information about her. But Zich thought she should be prioritized even more than the assassin organization that made people into Demon People.\u2018If she also regressed, she might be related to the Key that Distorts Destiny.\u2019Perhaps, she was the one who transplanted the Key that Distorts Destiny into him and twisted his memory and perception. But it was hard to make any more predictions.\u2018Good. That\u2019s it.\u2019 Zich tried to be positive. \u2018If I find out more about her, I might find out the reason why I regressed, and how I was able to regress.\u2019With this conclusion, Zich erased any more thoughts about the silver-haired woman\u2019s appearance. However, his thoughts about her were far from over.\u2018Then does this mean that there could be more regressors like me?\u2019The first possible figures that Zich could think of were the Hero Party that had been next to him in his moment of death. But Zich shook his head.\u2018At least, she\u2019s not Lubella.\u2019If Lubella had her memories from her past life, there was no way she would have fought so pathetically against the Bellids. Instead, she would have been the first to end them with her own hands.\u2018No, if I\u2019m being specific, it\u2019s not the Lubella as of right now.\u2019Zich hadn\u2019t regressed when he was born. There was a possibility that Lubella could awaken her past memories later on.\u2018If the silver-haired woman really regressed, it could have been a regression that was not related to me at all.\u2019 Zich tapped his knees with his fingers. \u2018In the end, there\u2019s nothing I\u2019m sure of.\u2019There were more puzzles to solve. However, that was all the predictions and analyses he could make from the information he currently had.\u2018Well, that\u2019s fine. If we are bound to meet each other, our paths will cross again. If we never meet each other again, that\u2019s also fine.\u2019The most important thing was that Zich himself was living in this world.\u2018Even if there are other regressors like me, it\u2019s not a big deal. They can live their own lives, and I can live my own life.\u2019However, if there really were other regressors, Zich wanted to try solving his curiosity about the topic of regressing; but that was the extent of his thoughts about regressors. If any regressor tried to interfere with Zich\u2026\u2018Well, what can I do? I have to beat them up.\u2019It would not matter if they were regressors. Zich\u2019s response to his opponents was always the same.* * *While Zich, Snoc, and Hans moved through the mountain, they continued to perform their random acts of kindness to the surrounding villages. They helped temples that took care of orphans, gave food to starving people, and provided labor to areas that needed support. One such area that needed their help was taking care of dangerous animals and monsters roaming near the villages.Polrune Village was an ordinary, farming village that was based on agriculture. The size of the village was about average. The village was full of open plains and fertile soil; life was stable and secure. However, even in this village, there were serious concerns shared among the villagers. One such concern was the monsters and wild beasts that occasionally came down from the mountain.Crush!A sharp pillar rose up from the ground and pierced the wolf like a skewer.Skreech!The wolf wailed out loud. The wolf frantically tried to move its feet, but it was unable to reach the ground. As the wolf swallowed blood, it fell into despair. The other wolves in the pack were so surprised, they ran away in all directions. However, Zich\u2019s team did not miss a single one.Thud!Hans threw a mana-instilled rock on a wolf\u2019s head, and its head exploded. Hans quickly threw another stone at another wolf.Crush!But this time, he missed. Instead, the rock hit a tree and broke the tree in half. Hans scrunched his face and threw another stone.Thud!This time, he made a perfect hit. A wolf, which was hit in the back, collapsed and rolled on the ground. The back of the wolf\u2019s hip exploded and its hind legs were separated from its body. Then the wolf\u2019s organs flowed out. However, due to Zich\u2019s intense training and their battle experiences, Snoc and Hans no longer felt disheartened by seeing the bloody sight in front of them. They had finished their training on killing people.Thud!Another rock completely ripped apart a wolf, and a rock pillar pierced another wolf. Like this, the whole wolf pack was decimated in a matter of seconds.\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Zich yawned as he sat on a rock from a distance and got up.\u201cYes, sir! I don\u2019t think we missed anything!\u201d\u201cGood. Let\u2019s get moving.\u201dAfter he placed the dead wolves in his magic box, Zich went deeper into the bushes. Hans and Snoc followed him from behind.\u201cHmm.\u201d With his acute eyes, Zich carefully searched the forest\u2019s surroundings.He didn\u2019t miss anything from the marks on the trees or the conditions of the dirt. Following Zich, Hans and Snoc also looked around. Although both of their skills had significantly increased thanks to their natural talent, including Zich\u2019s guidance and experience, they were still amateurish in many ways.While walking ahead, Zich stopped. His eyes were on the ground. \u201c\u2026They were right.\u201dHans and Snoc stuck out their heads from Zich\u2019s back. On the dirt ground, which had become muddy from water, there were marks stamped on the soil. Although the marks were smudged, they appeared to be footprints; however, they looked too big to belong to a human.\u201cSee, Nowem. I think there really was an orc here.\u201d Snoc lifted Nowem forward and showed him the footprints.Orcs were the reason why they were all wandering inside the mountain. One of the villagers told them that they had spotted an orc on their way up the mountain. To the villagers, monsters were more dangerous than beasts; therefore, the trembling villagers had a meeting to discuss whether they should hire mercenaries or adventurers. When they saw Zich and his companions who looked like skilled travelers, they quickly requested their help.Hans asked, \u201cDo you think a whole herd moved in, sir?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure. We will have to see if it\u2019s an outcast or a whole herd. We only just confirmed their existence.\u201d Zich pointed in the direction the footprints headed towards. \u201cLook for more footprints around here. Whether it\u2019s just one or multiple, we have to find where they are.\u201dHans asked in surprise, \u201cCan we find them with just this one mark?\u201dZich shook his head. \u201cMy tracking skills are not that impressive.\u201d\u201cThen, how do you plan to find them, sir?\u201dZich smirked and lifted his feet up. Then, he pointed at his eyes and ears. \u201cI\u2019m going to walk, see, hear, and feel.\u201dBoth Hans and Snoc turned gloomy from Zich\u2019s answer. Even a child\u2019s rash play would have more planning than this. However, they couldn\u2019t do anything. They knew from past experience that Zich would listen to their suggestions and employ them only if he thought their suggestions were good, but neither Hans nor Snoc had a clear plan.However, Zich also didn\u2019t plan to just keep wandering around. Although Zich said that he was hopeless at tracking, that was only in comparison to professionals\u2014and as someone who used to be called the Demon Lord, Zich only considered people who were on top of their fields \u2018as professionals.\u2019In short, Zich was only hopeless in comparison to tracking experts, and he had the basic skills to track and follow traces. Furthermore, the scope that Zich could sense was immense, and they moved very quickly through the mountain. Thus, contrary to Snoc and Hans\u2019 expectations that they would be wandering in the mountain for a long time, they found the orcs\u2019 settlement just the next day.Then after that, Hans and Snoc massacred the community of orcs without Zich having to step in.* * *People gathered at the village square and murmured amongst themselves. They were gathered in a circle around something, and the different kinds of expressions on their faces were fun to read. Most of their expressions seemed to be filled with curiosity, but there were some mixed with negative emotions such as fear and disgust.What they were looking at were several orc corpses. Unlike weak monsters like goblins, orcs were a rare sight to see since there was a small chance that ordinary villagers would survive to tell the tale. Next to the orcs\u2019 corpses, Zich and his companions and the village chief were standing together.\u201cSo, you are telling me that these monsters were settling inside the mountain?\u201d The old man with completely white hair nudged the pile of corpses.\u201cYes, sir. We don\u2019t know where they came from, but it could\u2019ve been really dangerous for the village. If the orcs knew that there was a village of humans nearby, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to resist coming down here.\u201d\u201cAre these all the monsters in the mountain?\u201d\u201cNo, these are just the monsters we brought here as evidence. There were many more in the settlement, but don\u2019t worry, sir. We didn\u2019t miss a single one.\u201dZich\u2019s words assured the village chief. The mere sight of these orcs\u2019 huge bodies, much bigger than humans amassed with bulky muscles, was enough to threaten them. It was clear to everyone how much damage these orcs would have caused if they ambushed the village. However, the relief he felt lasted only for a moment, and the chief thought of a new concern.\u201cBut\u2026then\u2026do we need to give you all some compensation for this?\u201dSo far, Zich hadn\u2019t requested money for any of the deeds he and his group did for the village. But this time, it wasn\u2019t like he and his companions had simply killed one or two orcs that were running around. They destroyed a whole settlement of orcs and personally brought some of the corpses as evidence. If Zich asked for compensation, the village chief wouldn\u2019t be able to refuse Zich\u2019s request; after all, how could he when Zich and his companions were strong enough to catch all those fearsome orcs? Everyone knew that the danger in front of them was the most fearsome and dangerous one.But Zich shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not like it was anything difficult.\u201d\u201c\u2026You really don\u2019t need any money?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWe are not so in need to exhort a small, rural village for money.\u201d\u201cThank you! Thank you so much, young man!\u201dThe village chief thanked Zich from the bottom of his heart as his last concern disappeared. And as the unexpected event inside the quiet village came to an end, people returned back to their normal, day-to-day lives. Zich and his companions also went back to their lodging. As the village\u2019s saviors, the village chief took extra care of their stay, and a fancy meal welcomed them back.After finishing their meals, Hans and Snoc went upstairs to their rooms to rest. Zich also rested in his room while looking down at the village from the window.\u201cWhat?\u201dHe saw someone loitering around at the mouth of the alleyway. A smile formed on his lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe lodging that Zich was residing in was for travelers. Since the village was not large, there was only one shabby lodging for travelers. Overall, it was a mediocre place to stay.A boy was staring intently at their lodging. He looked to be around ten years old. His clothes were oversized and shabby and his face was dirty. Judging by his appearance, it didn\u2019t seem as if he was living a comfortable life. The boy squirmed around as if he was trying to make a decision, but Zich suddenly appeared behind him. Like a cat catching his prey, Zich hid his presence and moved towards him. The boy did not notice Zich at all, and the corners of Zich\u2019s mouth moved up.\u201cHey!\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dZich tapped the boy\u2019s shoulders. The boy was so surprised, he jumped up in the same place. He couldn\u2019t even scream and turned his head back while choking. There was even a tear on his pale-stricken face. It was an understatement to say that the boy was overcome with shock.\u201cWhat are you secretly looking at?\u201d\u201cMister, y-you surprised me!\u201d The boy cried out to Zich; he tried to make his voice tough, but his small, shivering frame betrayed him.Zich messed up the boy\u2019s hair and put one hand forward. \u201cHere.\u201dThere was a large piece of bread in his hand. The boy\u2019s eyes widened. As his appearance indicated, the boy\u2019s family circumstances were difficult. To him, a soft and savory bread that was the size of a male adult\u2019s arm was like food from heaven. However, because of that, it was harder for him to just take it from Zich.\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t come here for this\u2026\u201d\u201cThen what did you come here for?\u201dThe boy had nothing to say since he did expect to get some free food. Zich forcefully grabbed the boy\u2019s hand and made him take the bread. \u201cA kid shouldn\u2019t refuse an adult\u2019s gift.\u201d\u201c\u2026My mom told me to not take stuff from strangers.\u201d Since the boy felt like he was causing trouble, he tried to refuse once more.\u201cShe was talking about bad adults.\u201d\u201cThen are you a kind adult?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m a bad adult that is trying to live a kind life.\u201d\u201cWhat is up with that?\u201d The boy smirked.Zich sat down with his back against a wall and patted the spot next to him. The boy cautiously sat down next to Zich and took a big bite of the bread. Then, the boy quickly gobbled down the bread; the soft bread tasted completely different from what he was used to.\u201cHey, eat slowly. You are going to get indigestion.\u201d Zich handed the boy a water bottle.The boy quickly gulped down the water, as his throat was parched. Then he quickly stuffed more bread into his mouth. But the boy did not completely finish the bread. Instead, he packed half of the bread into a sack he brought.\u201cAre you going to bring some to your family again?\u201d\u201cYes. My mother and my father are also suffering. I want to at least give some of this bread to my parents.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nice of you. But your parents don\u2019t say anything? Didn\u2019t your mother tell you to not take food from strangers?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201d The boy slurred his words at the end; it seemed as if he was scolded by his parents.\u2018Well, I would do the same thing as his parents.\u2019There were few people who were kind to others for no reason. In the first place, Zich was only doing kind acts because of Glen Zenard\u2019s \u201ckind\u201d suggestion.\u201cMy parents used to scold me, but now they don\u2019t. There\u2019s a lot of rumors going around in this village that you are a kind and impressive person.\u201d\u201cA kind person\u2026\u201dZich felt pleased that his acts of kindness were being recognized, but he couldn\u2019t get used to being called a \u2018kind person.\u2019 Zich felt like he was going to break out in hives from disgust.\u201cBut if a stranger approaches you with more friendliness than usual, don\u2019t trust them. The world is not that beautiful.\u201dMoreover, the world would become more dangerous as it reached the Era of Demon People.The boy replied, \u201cI understand.\u201dSmall talk passed between the boy and Zich.\u201cI have to go now.\u201d The boy saw that the sun was setting and quickly got up.\u201cHead home safely. And next time, just come directly to the lodging and ask for me. Don\u2019t just stare from the corner of an alley like some kind of criminal. In the first place, I\u2019m not at my lodging most of the time.\u201dZich was usually outside helping out a villager or defeating monsters, so it was fortunate that he found the boy today.\u201cBut if a dirty person like me went inside a place like that, I would get scolded.\u201d\u201cI already told them about you beforehand, so it doesn\u2019t matter. Also, that place shouldn\u2019t scold anyone about cleanliness, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dZich\u2019s lodging was not a place of luxury, and travelers usually didn\u2019t wash well and went around like beggars. There was no way a lodging for travelers would reject someone for their dirtiness. Moreover, Zich was a frequent customer of that lodging, and he was now famous around the village.\u201cWhat? Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d Zich asked this as the boy continued to stare intently at him.\u201c\u2026Mister, why are you so nice to me?\u201d\u201cAs you said, isn\u2019t it because I\u2019m a kind person?\u201d Even though Zich said this, he felt a shiver run down his back.The food inside his stomach threatened to come back up, but he managed to keep it down. However, the boy shook his head as if he couldn\u2019t agree with Zich\u2019s words.\u201cEven the people who are rumored to be kind don\u2019t want to get involved with us.\u201dThe boy\u2019s family was one of the poorest in the village. They were so poor that they couldn\u2019t even afford to live inside the sloppily structured wooden fences around the village. Even though the village was on the wealthy side due to its vast plains and fertile soil, the commoners didn\u2019t live in much comfort. The boy, who had experienced subtle discrimination from everyone, was amazed by the kindness shown by a traveler like Zich.\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m a kinder person than those kind people.\u201d\u201cBut didn\u2019t you just tell me that you are a bad person who\u2019s trying to live a kind life?\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s just say that I\u2019m a bad adult who is trying to live a kinder life than a kind person.\u201d\u201cWhat the heck is that?\u201d the boy laughed. He looked poor and starving, but his smile was the same as any other boy.\u201cThere are all kinds of people in this world.\u201d\u201cI wish there were more people like you.\u201d\u201cIf that happened, the world would become a much cooler place.\u201d\u201cI think so too.\u201d As the boy strongly agreed to something he said half-jokingly, Zich felt embarrassed.He was still not used to other people treating him as a kind person. As a result, the boy had successfully achieved the almost impossible task of embarrassing Zich, who could be said to be the manifestation of shamelessness. Zich looked up at the sky. The sun looked a bit brighter than before.\u201cI\u2019m really going now! See you again, mister!\u201d\u201cAll right. Goodbye.\u201dThe boy ran. He moved his short legs with a lot of effort and ran straight until he reached the front of some alleyway. Then, he waved his hands at Zich one more time and disappeared into the alley.\u2018He asked me why I was so nice to him\u2026\u2019Zich thought about the question that the boy asked him. He had jokingly said that it was because he was a \u2018bad adult who wanted to live kindly,\u2019 but that wasn\u2019t the only reason.\u2018It must be that.\u2019He recalled what Timmy told him when he fought those Bellid guys with Lubella. Timmy said that he couldn\u2019t hate Zich because Zich was the first one who helped him for no reason at all. Those words had shocked Zich when he first heard them, so it left a deep impression in his mind. They were the reasons why Zich had reached out his hand toward the boy who walked around while clutching his stomach in hunger, and why he had continued their relationship since then.\u2018I feel like I have really become a kind person.\u2019 Zich laughed and thought that even to him, this sounded like bullshit.* * *Kuuah!A monster screamed; it was a sound terrifying enough to make all the hairs of a person\u2019s body stand.Kiiieeeeh!The monster shrieked again. However, it didn\u2019t sound like it was shrieking to intimidate its opponent or celebrate from feasting on its victims\u2019 flesh. It was simply crying in pain.Crunch!At Hans\u2019 swing, a troll\u2019s forearm easily fell off its body. The troll clutched its severed arm and cried out, but Hans\u2019 heartless sword showed no mercy.Slice!Hans\u2019 sword sliced through the troll\u2019s neck, passing its thick skin, stringy muscles, and hard bones in one chilling blow. The troll collapsed helplessly to the ground.Thud! Thud!Hans turned around to finish off the other trolls when he heard two heavy sounds. From a distance away, there were two trolls on the ground with boulders on top of their heads. The pool of blood collecting beneath the rocks indicated that the trolls would not survive from the impact no matter how good their regenerative abilities were.Then, Hans saw Snoc go to the trolls that he defeated and nudged them with his feet. Even Nowem jumped off Snoc\u2019s shoulders and tapped the trolls; they were making sure that the monsters were dead. The trolls looked dead, but since trolls had amazing regenerative abilities, there was no harm in making sure.\u2018It\u2019s over now.\u2019Hans sheathed his sword. When he turned around, he saw Zich. As if he was satisfied with something, Zich squinted and stared at the trolls.\u201cWe have taken care of all of them, sir.\u201d\u201cGood job,\u201d Zich said plainly.\u201cIs there something wrong, sir?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s strange that there\u2019s this many trolls here.\u201dThe total number of trolls that Hans and Snoc had finished off was seven. It was not a small number\u2014no, considering the dangers of trolls, this was an incredibly high number; especially in a wide, open plain that wasn\u2019t too deep into the mountains.\u2018Since the orcs also tried to settle around here, there must be something going on.\u2019Zich couldn\u2019t pinpoint a specific cause.\u2018The monsters could be just a group who lost a power struggle in their herd or migrated after they ran out of food. Or they could just be strange monsters trying to make some trouble.\u2019 Zich stared deep into the mountain. \u2018Should I stay here for a while and hunt monsters for now?\u2019 Since the mountain wasn\u2019t that big, it didn\u2019t seem like it would take a long time.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Zich shouted to Hans and Snoc.* * *Zich and his companions continued their travels and searched through half of the mountain. Fortunately, there weren\u2019t as many monsters as they thought there would be. They didn\u2019t see another orc or troll settlement and just saw a couple of wandering orcs from time to time. Zich decided to search through the rest of the mountain after resting in the village for about a day.Grab!Even today, Zich gave his bread to the boy whose name he didn\u2019t know and watched the boy eat. The boy ate only half of the bread and put the rest of it in his pocket like usual.\u201cAre you done eating?\u201dThe boy cleanly licked the breadcrumbs around his mouth and answered, \u201cYes!\u201dAs usual, they chatted. It wasn\u2019t a very meaningful conversation\u2014the boy talked about how he was doing, and Zich told him all kinds of stories about the world.\u201cAh, before I forget. Try to stay home as much as possible if you can.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cDid you hear about dangerous monsters in the mountains?\u201d\u201cI heard about it.\u201d Zich had already told the village chief about the situation, so this was old news now. \u201cI am working hard to get rid of them, but I might have missed some. So, don\u2019t wander around for the time being. Especially outside of the village at night.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t wander around.\u201d\u201cAlso, if there\u2019s anything unusual going around, tell me.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dThen, after talking a bit more, the boy ran back to his house.\u2018Ah, come to think about it, I didn\u2019t ask for his name.\u2019This thought suddenly struck Zich while he saw the boy run off. Since all they did was talk for a bit while sharing food, Zich hadn\u2019t been interested in the boy\u2019s name.\u2018I was able to talk to him so well without even knowing his name. Should I ask him what his name is next time?\u2019 Zich returned to his lodging while thinking these thoughts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 90": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe boy, who Zich didn\u2019t know the name of, was sad and disappointed. When he went to visit Zich\u2019s lodging, he was told that Zich was not inside. Since the boy enjoyed meeting Zich and conversing together, getting free bread from him was now a second priority.\u2018Well, it\u2019s fine. This happens often.\u2019Since Zich kept himself extremely busy, there were many days when the boy was not able to meet Zich. Even though this happened frequently, the boy felt disappointed every time. He walked inside the village with heavy and down-trodden steps.His parents were foreigners. Since he was young, his parents found a place for them to stay near the village and began living there. Villages were usually intensely wary of foreigners. For that reason, it took a lot of time and effort for his family to be accepted by the villagers. Fortunately, they were now somewhat accepted by the villagers, but they were still subtly discriminated against.\u2018Huh?\u2019While the boy was returning back to his home, he saw a strange person surrounded by people. The person was a traveler, but that was not the strange part. There were travelers or adventurers who sometimes passed through the village; Zich was also a traveler. However, the person in front of him had an extremely peculiar appearance. He did not have a single strand of hair, and half of his face and head were covered with strange tattoos. His aura was also heavy and threatening. Villagers, whom the boy knew, surrounded the traveler. The traveler was exchanging money for a few packs of food from the villagers. However, even the villagers next to him were intimidated and their bodies flinched every time the traveler moved.Then, the traveler suddenly turned his head and met the boy\u2019s eyes.Twitch!The boy felt a cold shiver run down his back. The frightened boy turned his back and quickly ran away. He went into the nearest alleyway and hid from the stranger\u2019s eyes. But even then, the boy felt as if the traveler\u2019s eyes were following him, so he ran even faster.* * *Zich\u2019s group finished surveying the rest of the mountain. Fortunately, they killed most of the monsters in their first raid, so they only caught two orcs and five goblins. They even considered the possibility that some of the monsters might have moved, so they went back to the places they raided but found no trace of monsters.\u201cGood! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Zich shouted at Hans and Snoc.All the monsters were gone, and thanks to Zich and Hans, the number of wild beasts was also curbed. There were no signs that any more monsters might come. Even when they looked around, there were no factors that might have drawn out the monsters. Zich concluded that a power conflict between the monsters pushed back the weaker monsters closer to the village. For a while, Polrune Village wouldn\u2019t be harmed by monsters and wild beasts coming down from the mountain.\u2018It\u2019s time for me to go.\u2019There was nothing more Zich could do for this village. Zich decided to move to the next village. All the villagers, including the chief, were sad to see Zich go. Even though they were wary about outsiders, Zich had helped them out tremendously. After Zich told everyone that he was going to leave, he waited for the boy. Zich wanted to at least say goodbye to him. However, no matter how long Zich stayed in his lodging, the boy strangely did not appear. Zich asked the owner of the lodging when he last saw the boy.\u201cHmmm. He used to come almost every day, but for the past few days, he hasn\u2019t been coming.\u201dZich wasn\u2019t able to get the answer he wanted from the owner. Should he just leave? But it was true that he was concerned about the boy.\u2018Should I try looking around his house?\u2019Zich knew where the boy lived. Not a lot of people lived past the wooden fence of the village,and the people who lived outside were struggling with poverty like the boy\u2019s family. Since the people who lived outside were few in number, Zich could easily find where they lived.\u2018Let\u2019s just check up on him.\u2019Since it was their last meeting, Zich bought a basket full of bread to give to the boy. And while he was buying it, he asked the villagers how the boy and the people who lived outside the fence were faring.\u201cThinking back on it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen them for the past two days. Usually, they come here to help around with chores and manual labor.\u201dWhen Zich heard this from the baker, Zich felt that something bad might have happened to the boy. It was a very strange incident that the boy, his family, and everyone who lived outside the fence would all suddenly disappear. On the other hand, it had only been two days. There was also a high possibility that there was some unknown reason why they didn\u2019t come inside the village for two days.While carrying the basket of bread, Zich headed outside the village. The boy\u2019s house was not far away. Even though they were living outside the wooden fence, their house was not far from the village. As he walked, he could see the boy\u2019s house more and more clearly. Shabby and dilapidated houses were scattered across the plains.Thud!Suddenly, Zich halted. He scrunched his face slightly. Using his sensing abilities, he couldn\u2019t sense anyone in the house. Since the boy was not in the village, he had expected the boy to be in his house. Zich began walking again. He sensed the house next to the boy\u2019s house, but as expected, he couldn\u2019t sense any human presence. It was the same for the other houses.Then Zich\u2019s senses reached the last house.Tap!Zich quickly sped up his movements. He finally sensed a presence in the last house; however, the presence was very faint.\u2018A person is dying.\u2019Zich could feel it. In a matter of moments, Zich reached the house and opened the door. The house was not locked. The inside of the house was completely messy; the few furnishings in the house were wrecked, and three people were on the ground in the middle of the room.\u2018Two of them are dead.\u2019That was the reason why Zich was only able to sense one person. While stepping on the blood-soaked floor that had turned sticky and dark, Zich walked towards the last remaining person. He took out a potion and lifted the dying person\u2019s body. The figure was much smaller than an adult.It was the boy.\u201cHey! Wake up!\u201d Zich shook the boy and opened the top of the potion to pour it on the boy, but his hand stopped.\u2018This\u2026\u2019There was something on the boy\u2019s chest. A scar was cut on his chest into a specific pattern, and its gruesome existence shook all those who saw it.\u201cMr\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why are you here\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou kept not coming, so I came to you this time.\u201d Zich\u2019s voice was cold and calm.If a bystander didn\u2019t know the context of their situation, they would have thought Zich was having a casual conversation.\u201cI\u2026see\u2026\u201dAs if he was happy that Zich came to find him, a faint smile formed on the boy\u2019s face. The smile made his pale and lifeless face appear even more washed up.\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d Zich asked bluntly.The boy didn\u2019t notice the slight chill in Zich\u2019s voice, and he simply trembled at the memory of the horrific incident.\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026He was someone\u2026I have never\u2026seen before\u2026he suddenly appeared\u2026at night.\u201d Tears trickled down the boy\u2019s cheeks. \u201cAh, he\u2026to my dad\u2026first\u2026then, Mom\u2026!\u201dHe didn\u2019t give specific details, but the corpses of the boy\u2019s parents clearly displayed the terror they had faced right before their deaths.\u201cH-He told me\u2026that if I didn\u2019t shout\u2026he wouldn\u2019t kill\u2026my mom and dad\u2026but it hurt too much and I couldn\u2019t\u2026I tried to\u2026 endure it as much\u2026as I could\u2026\u201d There were knife marks all over the boy\u2019s body. It seemed as if his offender had played a \u2018game\u2019 of torture with a condition that the boy must not make a sound. \u201cAfter\u2026he killed\u2026 my mom and dad\u2026 he did the same thing\u2026to other people\u2026\u201dZich didn\u2019t feel any presence in the other houses; it seemed like the neighbors were also all dead.\u201cHe said\u2026it\u2019s\u2026all my\u2026fault. It\u2019s\u2026all my fault!\u201dThe boy couldn\u2019t cry. He didn\u2019t even have the energy to talk properly, and his consciousness was almost half gone. Instead, the soundless tears dripping down his face conveyed his sorrows.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Zich responded, but the boy\u2019s heart could not be at ease with just a few words. \u201cDo you remember anything particular about the guy?\u201d\u201c\u2026He had no\u2026hair\u2026and a strange\u2026mark covered\u2026half of his face\u2026\u201dZich\u2019s eyes sparkled.\u201cAll right. I understand. You have done well.\u201dZich raised his hands and placed them on the hideous pattern on the boy\u2019s chest. Mana gathered in his hands.Pwiish!His mana-soaked fingernails pierced deeply into the center of the mark.Shaa.The dark energy lingering on the boy\u2019s body disappeared, and the boy closed his eyes at the same time. Then, the boy took his last breath.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will settle this for you.\u201d Zich stroked the sleeping boy\u2019s head once.* * *Crackle!The fire burned aggressively. Its fiery dance grew stronger from the many firewoods inside it. And everything within its reach\u2014including the fearless bugs that flew into the fire and the corpses of those who had died a painful death\u2014were engulfed in its flames.The people living in the outskirts of the village experienced discrimination from the villagers while they were alive, and they couldn\u2019t receive the villagers\u2019 blessings even in their deaths. They were all outsiders who had settled into the village from somewhere else, so they had no clear connection with the rest of the community. In addition, the fact that they had all been brutally murdered scared the villagers from coming out. Thus, the only ones who bid their farewells were Zich, Hans, and Snoc.\u201c\u2026They are so pitiful\u2026\u201dKoo\u2026Snoc sighed while hugging Nowem. The villagers were reluctant to hold a funeral for the people who died. Therefore, Zich volunteered to do the work, and Zich and his companions did everything in preparation from moving the corpses and preparing the funeral. When Hans and Snoc first saw the corpses, they were shocked. Every single corpse was corrupt to the point that it no longer resembled the shape of a human.The three watched the fire, and Hans stole quick glances at Zich. Zich\u2019s expression was the same as usual, but that worried Hans even more.\u2018There\u2019s no way Sir Zich won\u2019t do anything.\u2019He didn\u2019t know the details, but Hans was aware that Zich had cared for a boy in this village. And that boy had died after going through horrible torture.\u2018He won\u2019t act upon things like sentimentality or a sense of justice.\u2019Although Zich vowed to do kind acts, Hans knew common motivators didn\u2019t move or affect Zich. However, killing someone Zich helped and making his kind act useless or torturing and murdering someone related to him would have definitely made a dent on Zich\u2019s ego. And Hans\u2019 analysis was on point. Zich\u2019s heart and mind were like steel. They were like a frozen piece of land that was frozen for thousands of years.Zich waited until the fire dwindled without moving an inch. It took a long time for the fire to fade out, and Zich collected the bones left between the firewood. Then, he ground them up into powder and placed them into a vase and made an urn. Finally, he placed the urn into his magic box.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d These were Zich\u2019s first words since the firewood was lit up.Hans asked, \u201cAre you planning revenge, sir?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cDo you know who your target is?\u201dZich made a faint smile, but Hans and Snoc couldn\u2019t do the same. Zich\u2019s smile was terrifying enough for them to break out in cold sweat.\u201cHans, you remember Lubella and Weig, right?\u201d\u201cAh, yes!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go meet up with them. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dHans\u2019s voice naturally rose as Zich talked about meeting Karuwiman\u2019s Saint Candidate like they were going to meet a friend in the neighborhood. But Zich ignored him and continued walking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLubella was saying a prayer like usual. While she bent down her knees on a white floor, she was fully devoted in her prayers; needless to say, her appearance was the pinnacle of holiness. Then she opened her eyes. She loosened her hands and got up from the floor. Even though her knees felt slightly sore from bending them for so long, Lubella showed no signs of discomfort. She turned around and headed towards the prayer room entrance. A large holy object hanging in front of the prayer room seemed to be blessing her back.Creek!\u201cOh my?\u201d Lubella was surprised to find Weig in front of her as soon as she opened the prayer room\u2019s thick door. Weig stared at Lubella and made a smile.\u201cLady Lubella, are you finished with your prayers?\u201d\u201cYes, but what is the matter?\u201dLubella knew that Weig waited in front of the prayer room when he had something urgent to say to her.Weig nodded his head. \u201cA familiar face has come to visit us.\u201d\u201cA familiar face?\u201d\u201cZich. He has come to visit us.\u201dLubella\u2019s face brightened up. \u201cMr. Zich has come here?\u201d\u201cHe has come to see you and me. If you are busy, I can go by myself\u2014\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go quickly!\u201d Lubella quickly moved her feet. Since she had to be quiet in the temple, she didn\u2019t run, but her footsteps were extremely fast. However, she stopped when she heard Weig\u2019s words. \u201cLady Lubella, do you even know where he is?\u201d\u201c\u2026Where is he?\u201dWeig made a small smile and led Lubella, who was now bright red, to where Zich and his companions were.* * *\u201cWow!\u201d Snoc moved his head around fervently. He looked around the room, which was completely white without a trace of dirt. Even though the room only had one holy ornament, the room seemed to ooze out divinity since it was inside the Karuwiman temple. Even Hans was amazed by the grand sight in front of him, and only Zich remained indifferent to the splendor of his surroundings.Knock! Knock!\u201cYou can come in.\u201d With Zich\u2019s permission, two people came inside the room. Zich and Hans were familiar with them, but it was Snoc\u2019s first time seeing them.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I saw the two of you.\u201d Zich got up from his seat and greeted them first.Lubella and Weig were happy to see him.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Mr. Zich. I\u2019m glad that you look healthy.\u201d Weig greeted him first while making that trademark laugh of his\u2014as if he was a silly old grandpa who lived next door. Even though Zich thought he got used to this laugh while fighting with Weig against the Bellids, it was strange to see Tasnia\u2019s Killing Machine laugh so brightly again. Zich tried to repress his thoughts and shook hands with Weig.\u201cMr. Zich, welcome. Have you been well?\u201d Lubella smiled and gave a small bow.Unlike Weig, Zich felt no sense of confusion with her. Hans and Snoc also greeted Lubella and Weig. After he heard their titles, Snoc froze in place.\u201cLady Lubella, your face looks brighter. Has my advice been helpful to you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been more than helpful.\u201d Weig quickly answered in Lubella\u2019s place. \u201cThose guys can\u2019t even properly stand in front of me or Lubella. In the first place, they weren\u2019t even at our level and were disrespecting us out of jealousy.\u201dWeig\u2019s boisterous laugh indicated how pleased he was.\u201cYou were able to overcome it well.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you, Mr. Zich.\u201d Even though Lubella thought it wasn\u2019t something she should brag about (she even felt embarrassed), Lubella made a shy smile.However, Weig was not going to end his bragging about Lubella just yet. \u201cAfter that incident, Lady Lubella\u2019s position as the next saint candidate has become even more solid. In the first place, she was heads above everyone in morals and ability. Now, whenever someone thinks about the next Karuwiman Saint, 99 out of 100 people think of Lubella.\u201d\u201cSir Weig, please stop.\u201d\u201cAs you can see, she is still very humble like this.\u201dLubella\u2019s face became even redder. Likewise, Weig\u2019s laughter became even louder. Their relationship was still like a grandpa and his granddaughter. \u201cBut all of my words about Lady Lubella are true. Honestly, it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say Lady Lubella is one step away from earning the name, \u2018Primel\u2019.\u201d\u2018Primel.\u2019 It was the middle name given to a saint. It was not a name that the Karuwimans carelessly said, especially for fervent devotees like Weig. This indicated how close Lubella was to becoming a saint to the extent that Weig would confidently mention that name out loud.Zich asked, \u201cWhat do you have to do for that final step?\u201d\u201cAnything really. No, I\u2019m not joking. The only thing we have left is to build her reputation. She just has to complete a small task for the sake of other people. Like last time, we can just go around villages for about a month.\u201d\u201cAnd while you are doing that, are you expecting to meet those Bellid bastards again?\u201dWhen Zich said this, Lubella and Weig burst out laughing at the same time. They both recalled what happened in Porti. Zich laughed with them, but Snoc, who had not been with them during that time, just awkwardly stood there while holding onto Nowem. And Hans shook his head.Even though all Hans did during that time was run like crazy to bring Weig, Hans knew how serious the situation was. But the people in front of him were all laughing while recalling such a terrifying event.\u2018Do all great people have this kind of mindset?\u2019Hans felt that there was a great distance between them.\u201cYeah, yeah. It would be great if I could hunt down those Bellid bastards again. But will an event like that happen again?\u201dZich did not reply. All he did was smile. However, Weig, who had a lot of experience, knew right away from Zich\u2019s smile that he had something on his mind.\u201c\u2026To think about it, I haven\u2019t asked you why you came here. Considering your personality, you wouldn\u2019t have come here without a reason.\u201d\u201cYou told me that there is only one step left until Lady Lubella receives the middle name, \u2018Primel,\u2019 right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd what you need to do is a small task for the sake of others.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThis is the last task Lady Lubella needs to do to become recognized as the Karuwiman Saint. Instead of a small task, why don\u2019t you end it with extravagance?\u201d\u201cSuch as?\u201d\u201cThe total destruction of the northern branch of Bellid.\u201d* * *Tap! Tap!Weig tapped the table with his fingers. He cupped his face with his other hand and made a stern face. Lubella did the same while sitting next to him. On the other hand, Hans and Snoc were wholly frozen in their spots, not knowing what to do\u2014they had come here without hearing much.\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Weig opened his mouth. \u201cThe villagers you helped were brutally murdered, and the ones who killed them were part of the Bellid?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zich asked for a pen and paper and began to draw a picture; it was the scar that was engraved on the boy\u2019s chest. Zich pushed his drawing toward Lubella and Weig.\u201cYou both can probably recognize this mark.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s one of those shit things that the Bellids do\u2014black magic that prevents a person from dying.\u201dHearing that, some might think the magic granted eternal youth and life to its subjects, but it was far from that.\u201cThey taint a person\u2019s life force with Bellu\u2019s energy and forcefully keep the person alive no matter how fatal their wounds are. Since the magic is ineffective to those who harness Bellu\u2019s energy, they use it a lot to torture their victims who should be dead.\u201d\u201cThey also use it a lot to play with people.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did someone fall victim to this?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The edges of Zich\u2019s smile twisted with chilling bloodthirst.\u201cI was quite attached to him.\u201d\u201cWhat a pity.\u201d Weig drew a sign of the cross, and Lubella silently prayed.\u201cBut right before the child died, he told me a trait that his offender had. Apparently, the man had no hair, and half of his face was covered with a tattoo.\u201dBoth Lubella and Weig\u2019s faces hardened; they had someone in mind.\u201cCardinal Trislowa.\u201d\u201cHmph! The title of cardinal is too good for someone like that, Lady Lubella.\u201dBut Weig\u2019s face trembled with tension. As one of the cardinals, right below the Bellids\u2019 pope, Cullun Trislowa was a person who wreaked havoc all over the world. Because of their opposite characters, the two religions, Karuwiman and Bellid, constantly clashed against each other, and Trislowa was one of the main figures responsible for many bloodsheds.\u201cMany Karuwiman followers have died in his hands. We have to obtain his head as soon as possible.\u201d As expected of a man called \u2018Karuwiman\u2019s Sword,\u2019 Weig possessed a great desire to shred the man into pieces. \u201cDid you say that guy came to the village?\u201d\u201cYes. I think he and his men came to the village to get some food and decided to have some \u2018fun\u2019 while they were at it. All their victims were people living around the village\u2019s outskirts\u2014they knew the village wouldn\u2019t make a fuss with that much sacrifice.\u201d\u201cThose bastards!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the only important part. The village that they attacked is covered with wide plains and surrounded by low mountains. But many monsters started to appear there; the orcs were even forming a community.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying that strange herds of monsters appeared at the same place Trislowa appeared. I smell something fishy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure they are plotting something.\u201d Zich agreed.\u201cThank you, Zich. I am willing to run wherever those bastards are. But as you know, those guys move like sly pests, so even we aren\u2019t able to locate their headquarters. You talked about the complete destruction of the northern branch of Bellid, right?\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cSo, does that mean you know where the northern branch is?\u201dZich smiled, and that was enough to answer Weig\u2019s question.\u201cGood, good. If we can wipe out the northern branch of Bellid, then we can crush the small number of dissent that are against Lady Lubella to become recognized as the next saint. Besides, it is one of the main responsibilities for all Karuwimans to kill off the Bellids.\u201dAfter saying this, Weig asked a question he had been curious about, \u201cBut how were you able to find out where those guys were? This is information that not only us, but other countries weren\u2019t able to find out. Of course, this includes your biological family, the Steelwalls too.\u201dIt seemed as if Weig had done a background check on Zich. But this didn\u2019t surprise Zich since he had half-jokingly suggested Lubella to investigate his family.\u201cI learned it by coincidence.\u201d To be exact, Zich found out the location of the northern branch of Bellid before his regression; and at that time, as soon as he obtained the information, he left the place in ruins without even leaving a trace.\u201cI expected as much. Well, it\u2019s fine. Since I trust you, I won\u2019t ask any more questions. But I want you to at least answer this.\u201d Weig\u2019s eyes turned serious. \u201cDo you know the locations of Bellids\u2019 other branches?\u201d\u201cI know about two more. I can tell you if you want.\u201dWeig clapped. \u201cGood! That\u2019s very good news! God Karuna must have really sent you to us!\u201d\u2018I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\u2019Zich recalled how he had fought Karuwiman to the death before his regression.\u201cWe will give you all the support you need. Did you say your target is the northern branch? According to you, Trislowa must manage that place.\u201d Weig stuck out his neck and looked at Zich. \u201cYour motive must be revenge.\u201dZich made a chilling smile. \u201cThanks to that guy, I couldn\u2019t even hear the boy\u2019s name.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDry wind passed over the earth. The wind scattered sand throughout the desolate wilderness. It caused the sand to spin in the air and fall all over the horizon; some pieces landed on nameless plateaus, some hit spiky rocks, and some even landed on small shrubs. The only vegetation that this place had were a few small shrubs scattered across the earth. In this area, farming was impossible, and game was scarce. In this desolate wilderness, two people on horses began to appear in clear view.It was Zich and Weig. After reaching the peak of a low valley, Weig pulled up the reins of his horse and looked ahead. Beyond the endless wilderness, Weig could see the horizon dim. The vastness of the earth left Weig in awe and he exclaimed, \u201cThe world really transcends human imagination. I would have never imagined that there was a place like this.\u201dZich stood next to Weig and said, \u201cEven a great person like you with a lot of experience must have never seen a spectacle like this.\u201d\u201cSince my job is to protect Lady Lubella and fight against heretics, I never had time to leisurely explore the world. Of course, I personally thought I saw a lot of the world already, but it seems like I was too arrogant. I tried to measure the world that God created according to my limited perspective.\u201d With reverence, Weig drew a sign of the cross.\u201cI guess people who serve a god will have that kind of sentiment.\u201d\u201cIf you start to believe in God Karuna, you will also share my sentiments. How about it? Our door is always open for you.\u201d\u201cThank you for your offer, but I refuse.\u201d As usual, Zich lightly rejected Weig\u2019s offer.Weig had also expected Zich to refuse, so he was not disappointed. Moreover, there was something more important. \u201cThat\u2019s regretful, but I guess it can\u2019t be helped. But Zich, is it really true that the northern branch of the Bellid is here?\u201dThe reason why Zich and Weig came to this wilderness was to confirm the existence of the northern branch in this area. Even though Lubella and Weig trusted Zich, this was not a decision that could be made on trust alone. If they really wanted the Church to fight against the northern branch of Bellid, even Aine Lubella and Belri Weig\u2019s words in favor of Zich\u2019s words would not be enough. They needed to bring solid evidence to the Church. For that reason, Zich and Weig were all the way in this wilderness.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe you, but I don\u2019t think this is the type of place where those Bellid bastards would build a temple.\u201dThe god that Bellids served was the god of water, Bellu. For that reason, there was one absolute principle that the Bellids considered when choosing land to build a temple: water. Whether it was next to a lake, river, or ocean, Bellid\u2019s temple had to be built next to a body of water. Moreover, the bigger and more important the temple was, the body of water next to it needed to be significantly larger than usual.For that reason, when Karuwimans were investigating the Bellid temple, they always started their search by looking around places of water. They were currently searching for the northern branch of Bellid. Considering the significance of the northern branch, there needed to be an enormous body of water.But no matter how much Weig looked around the area, it didn\u2019t seem as if a large body of water would be nearby. On the other hand, the dry landscape made it seem like water was extremely scarce, so Bellids would strictly avoid this area.\u201cFrom the surface, it looks like that. But it\u2019s precisely for that reason that people weren\u2019t able to find them here.\u201d\u201cWell, you have a point.\u201dIf there really was a Bellid temple here, this desolate and dry wilderness was a perfect diversion against those who specifically searched for humid and water-abundant areas.\u201cWe just have to go a little further.\u201d Zich pulled on the reins of his horse to start moving.Likewise, with a hopeful heart, Weig followed Zich. Not long after, they reached the entrance of a deep canyon. To their sides, steep cliffs stretched on without end.\u201cLet\u2019s hide our horses here.\u201dZich and Weig found a deep groove in the cliff and tied up their horses. After they threw a few pieces of hay in front of them, Zich and Weig started walking forward. They walked out of the groove and headed towards an enormous rock. The rock was about four or five times bigger than an average person, and even though harsh winds were pressing against the rock, it stood firm.However, the rock was not the important part. It did not matter when and how long the rock could endure the harsh climate of its surroundings\u2014what Zich was interested in was the hole underneath the rock.\u201cThis is it.\u201dThe size of the hole was pretty big. It was big enough for one person to stand and walk. Weig bent his knees and looked around the ground. It was hard to tell, but the top of the stone floor was slightly worn out.\u201cSomeone or something definitely passed through this.\u201d\u201cWe have to be careful from now on. This is their home base.\u201d\u201cWhy, are you afraid?\u201d Weig jokingly asked, and Zich nodded while laughing.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that those bastards might realize we found out about them and run away before we can destroy them.\u201d\u201cYes, that is definitely a situation to be afraid of.\u201d Weig agreed.The two of them went inside the hole. The hole was connected to an extremely large cave. Weig was amazed that such a large underground base would exist under a desolate wilderness.\u201cIn a lot of ways, this journey has definitely expanded my perspective.\u201d\u201cSir Weig, if you become a traveler, you\u2019ll be able to see even more interesting and strange things in the world.\u201d\u201cHey! Is this revenge for my constant badgering for you to join Karuwiman? You got me.\u201dThe two continued to move inside the cave. As soon as they moved away from the entrance, they entered a place where there was not even a trace of light. But they could both use mana to brighten up their eyesight so there was no hindrance in their progress. The cave was long. It was when they walked three hours on a bumpy and slippery cave\u2014A light appeared. Both of them immediately lowered their bodies and quickly found a rock to hide behind.\u201c\u2026There is a place like this here\u2026\u201dWhat appeared in front of them was a vast underground lake. The size of the lake was so prodigious, it was hard to see the other side of the lake.\u2018Considering the size of this lake, it\u2019s completely understandable that those Bellid bastards would build one of their most important temples here.\u2019The light they witnessed was starting to flow out from the other side of the lake. It was far away, but they could clearly see that the light was coming off from the other side. Weig rejoiced.\u2018It really exists!\u2019On the opposite side of the lake, there were many torchlights lighting up a large building into view. The building was tall enough to almost touch the high cave\u2019s ceiling, and the size of its front resembled a great temple. Bellid\u2019s mark stood on top of the building in clear view and welcomed them.They also saw quite a few people going in and out of the building. With his senses that were sharpened with mana, Weig could see the clothes the people were wearing.\u2018They are wearing Bellid uniforms!\u201dThere was no need to see more. As Zich said, the place was definitely an important base for the Bellids.\u201cDo you believe me now, sir?\u201dWith great conviction, Weig answered, \u201cAs soon as I return, I will prepare Karuwiman\u2019s strongest army!\u201d* * *Zich and Weig returned to Karuwiman headquarters. Weig reported everything he saw to the Church such as the wilderness, cave, the underground lake, and the Bellid temple. As Karuwiman\u2019s greatest Holy Knight, Weig\u2019s words carried a much heavier weight than ones from an outsider like Zich. Thus, the Pope immediately led an effort to prepare an army to subjugate the Bellids. Holy Knights and priests from important areas began to gather, resources were piled up, and weapons were delivered. The Church knew that this was a critical chance to wipe away the Bellids they hated so much.The Karuwimans were thorough and secretive; they also made a cover-up in case their plan might reach Bellids\u2019 ears. While the Karuwimans prepared for a looming war, Zich went to meet an extremely important figure.The important figure was a scrawny old man. Wrinkles lined most of his face, and the arms that peeked below his sleeves were bony. He looked gentle like a wise grandfather, but his position made it such that even a king or the emperor couldn\u2019t approach carelessly.\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Zich.\u201d Zich lowered his head. Then, he forcefully pressed down the nervousness he felt and addressed the man with his title.\u201cYour Holiness.\u201d\u201cHoho! It\u2019s my pleasure!\u201d The old man was very carefree; his smile almost seemed to have a halo effect, as if it would take everything in its embrace. At his appearance, an adult wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep themselves from smiling while a child might have run around while clutching onto the hems of his clothes. He was the Pope.\u2018It\u2019s killing me.\u2019The same nervousness he felt when he first met Lubella and Weig went up and down through him.\u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m meeting the original zombie maker before Lubella.\u2019It was even more nerve-wracking that the Pope was greeting Zich in a friendly atmosphere. Before his regression\u2014when he constantly clashed with the Karuwimans\u2014the Pope had been a very tricky opponent. Moreover, before Lubella gained experiences from her travels around the world with Glen Zenard, he had been Karuwiman\u2019s highest priest.\u2018It\u2019s not even a joke that I almost died in his hands.\u2019One time, as Zich\u2019s notoriety kept growing with no signs of stopping, the Pope personally gathered an elite unit to take care of Zich. Without exaggerating one bit, Zich had almost died then.\u2018My enemies just wouldn\u2019t die.\u2019He could still remember it clearly: the Pope protected and healed the Holy Knights from the rear and even let out some support attacks. Zich managed to grit his teeth through it all and resisted with all he had to just survive. But even then he didn\u2019t achieve a clear victory; the Pope\u2019s troops had simply withdrawn to regroup again, and for a while after that, Zich avoided confronting Karuwimans head-on.Of course, Zich had never fought with the Pope after he gained the title of The Demon Lord of Strength; the Pope was dead by then. However, Zich could never forget the Pope\u2019s overwhelming holy power.\u201cAre those your servants behind you?\u201dAt the Pope\u2019s question, Hans and Snoc quickly bowed their heads after watching with their mouths hanging open.\u201cYes, yes! I am Sir Zich\u2019s servant, Hans!\u201d\u201cM-my name is Snoc! T-This guy\u2019s name is Nowem.\u201d\u201cHohoho! You guys are filled with energy.\u201dHans and Snoc couldn\u2019t calm down. In some ways, Karuwiman\u2019s Pope was someone who was harder to meet than a king or the emperor, and they couldn\u2019t believe that they were meeting the Pope in person.\u201cI apologize for my servants\u2019 rude behaviors.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I am also just a humble servant of God Karuna too. There is no need for them to consider formalities as long as we maintain basic etiquette between humans.\u201dThe Pope was a simple and easygoing man. The Pope offered them to sit at the table next to him. Zich sat in front of the Pope; Lubella sat next to the Pope and Weig sat beside her; and finally, Hans and Snoc sat next to Zich.\u201cForemost, as the representative of Karuwiman, I want to thank you for telling us the hiding base of those vile things, the Bellids.\u201dNo matter how benevolent and simple he was, the Pope proved that he was really a Karuwiman by the way he mentioned the Bellids.\u201cThis is simply what I wanted to do. If you thank me too much, it puts me in a difficult position.\u201d\u201cBellid is not just Karuwiman\u2019s enemy. They are pests that only cause harm to this world. Sir Zich, since you have done the world a great favor, you deserve my gratitude.\u201d The Pope smiled. \u201cBut since you seem to be embarrassed about it, I will stop mentioning it. I came to you to thank you and see if there\u2019s a plan that we could discuss. I heard that you wanted revenge\u2014does this mean that you will join our battle against those cursed Bellids?\u201d\u201cYes, certainly. But I will move separately.\u201d\u201cThen, what will you do?\u201d\u201cWhile you all are attacking the temple, I am planning to infiltrate inside.\u201d\u201cI see. You are planning to take care of the guy who killed the boy.\u201dThe Pope was able to perfectly grasp Zich\u2019s motive after hearing about the general situation.Zich made a menacing smile. \u201cYes, I don\u2019t plan on giving him an easy death.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 93": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind93Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was as if frost was falling in the room. Hans, Snoc, and Lubella\u2014of course, Weig and the Pope, who were both currently stronger than Zich\u2014all froze for a moment. Weig\u2019s hands instinctively reached towards the handle of his sword; that was how strong Zich\u2019s bloodthirst was.\u201cHohoho! That was very scary. Even though I understand how furious you must be, I ask that you withdraw your bloodthirst. It\u2019s putting a strain on an old man\u2019s heart who might not see the light of tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOops. My emotions got the better of me. I apologize.\u201d Zich withdrew his bloodlust. Hans, Snoc, and Lubella\u2019s faces began to look relieved. But their expressions were not fully back to normal.The Pope continued, \u201cI understand. I also lost my friends and comrades to those Bellid bastards. It\u2019s a sin for those guys to exist\u2014that\u2019s why we have to kill every single one of them.\u201dEven though the Pope didn\u2019t let out his bloodlust like Zich, his spirit was also fierce. Hans and Snoc gulped their saliva. The Pope, who had been friendly like a next-door grandpa, was now showing his force as the leader of a large and powerful organization.\u201cI heard that your sworn enemy is Cardinal Cullun Trislowa.\u201d\u201cYes, he is.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an extremely vicious person. I don\u2019t even want to say he is human. However, he is strong. Not as strong as Sir Weig, but I predict that he possesses the same strength as Karuwiman\u2019s highest level priest.\u201dWeig made a groan, as he didn\u2019t seem pleased to be compared to Cullun Trislowa. However, nobody, including the Pope, paid any attention to him, even the kind Lubella. Weig felt a little disheartened. He suddenly missed the innocent Lubella for a bit.\u201cMr. Zich, I know that you are very strong considering your age, but I don\u2019t think you are stronger than him. Are you still planning to fight him?\u201d\u201cWhen all of you attack, I will start moving inside. I might not be a good diversion, but I won\u2019t at least be a hindrance to all of you.\u201d\u201c\u2026You are saying that you won\u2019t change your mind.\u201dLubella looked at Zich with concern, but she didn\u2019t say anything because she respected his decision. The Pope spoke again, \u201cWe will be extremely secretive about this plan. We can\u2019t afford to let pests like Bellid realize this plan and crawl away. We will be strictly controlling our information about this plan in our external as well as internal factions. Even the military force that we are gathering right now don\u2019t know they are gathering to fight against the Bellid.\u201d\u201cHow would you deal with the surrounding countries? People would feel threatened by a Karuwiman army.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve already spread some information as bait. It\u2019s not common for us to move our military force, but it\u2019s not like it never happens. When we finish our raid against Bellid, we will then tell the truth. Even though there might be countries that express their discomfort, raiding the Bellid is a right of the Karuwiman, recognized by all sovereign nations.\u201dHowever, as the Pope mentioned, surrounding countries would definitely bring up complaints, especially countries that had land near or on the northern branch of Bellid. However, the Pope had no intentions to withdraw his plans. This was a military and a diplomatic war. Moreover, the Pope was a holy figure respected by all Karuwiman devotees, but he was also a leader of a large organization. He was familiar with the \u2018trick or be tricked\u2019 mentality and used plans that deceived others.Weig, a knight, and Lubella, a devoted priestess, looked uncomfortable by the Pope\u2019s words. They lightly drew a sign of the cross and begged for forgiveness to their god. Hans and Snoc were also shocked by the Pope\u2019s words; even though they realized this was a necessity, the plan definitely relied on tricking people. On the other hand, the Pope\u2019s complexion did not change at all.\u2018A boss of a holy organization is a boss after all.\u2019Just a kind old grandpa who laughed, \u2018Hoho!\u2019 was not enough to lead such a large organization. Moreover, that was how much the Pope hated the Bellid.\u2018Well, it\u2019s because I knew about their aversion for Bellid that I came to them.\u2019Zich was satisfied.\u201cSo I expect the three of you to also be cautious about not letting this information leak out.\u201d\u201cBefore we start our raid, why don\u2019t we stay inside the temple? Won\u2019t that also make you feel more secure?\u201d\u201cIf you do that, I will be more than grateful.\u201d The Pope also thought about suggesting this to Zich, so he immediately accepted Zich\u2019s offer. \u201cWe will treat you with the highest level of hospitality. None of you will feel uncomfortable in the slightest.\u201dAfter that, a few more conversations passed between them. After they decided that they would make more specific plans after the Karuwiman formed a basic outline of their military raid, they decided to go their separate ways.\u201cAh, but would you be able to accept one request of mine?\u201d Zich asked before he got up.The Pope readily replied, \u201cMr. Zich, since we owe you a great favor, I will try to accept your request as much as possible, even if it is difficult. What do you need?\u201d\u201cThe title of Honorary Knight. Would you be able to give it to me?\u201dIt was an unexpected request.\u201cFrom what I heard, when Sir Weig offered you the title of Honorary Knight, you refused.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I didn\u2019t really need it then.\u201d\u201cThen do you need it now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Honestly, there\u2019s no reason for us to refuse your request. It\u2019s also very beneficial for us to accept a person like you as Honorary Knight. You provided more than enough service for us. I will make sure that you receive the title right away.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dLubella and Weig\u2019s faces brightened up. Since they both wanted Zich to become an Honorary Knight, they were happy at how the situation turned out.Then, the Pope asked, \u201cBut will it be all right if I ask why you suddenly need the title of Honorary Knight? Ah, no matter what type of reason you state, no matter how personal it is, I will never say it out loud to anyone. I\u2019m just asking because I\u2019m curious. If it\u2019s hard for you to say, you also don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201dZich laughed. Even though it was not to the extent that Weig had to instinctively reach out for his sword again, Zich\u2019s laugh right now didn\u2019t look too great either. His laugh was sinister and conniving.\u201cAfter that boy died, a thought occurred to me. How can I make that Trislowa bastard even more furious? How can I make him go crazy with anger? While I tried to make my plans accordingly, I judged that it would be better for me to have the title of Honorary Knight. There\u2019s all there is to it.\u201dEveryone, including the Pope, was left speechless.* * *After Zich, Hans, and Snoc left, only the Pope, Lubella, and Weig were left in the room.\u201cHe is even more unique than I imagined.\u201d The Pope made a hearty laugh.\u201cAlthough his personality might be like that, his actions speak differently. They are proper, and it\u2019s actually very praiseworthy that he tries hard to do good deeds even with that kind of personality. Even if becomes a Holy Knight of Karuwiman, he won\u2019t fall\u2026\u201dThe Pope\u2019s laughter grew so loud that it could shake the whole room, and Weig closed his mouth.\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. Sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to laugh at you. It\u2019s because it\u2019s my first time seeing you defend someone besides Lubella so desperately.\u201d\u201c\u2026Was it that noticeable?\u201d Weig felt a bit embarrassed and nudged the table\u2019s legs with his feet pointlessly.\u201cWhat do you think, Lubella? Do you think the same as Weig?\u201d\u201cYes, I do. Mr. Zich\u2019s personality is indeed awful, but I believe that he is someone we can trust.\u201dThe Pope laughed again in response. \u201cPffft! Even Lubella says that his \u2018personality is awful\u2019 in front of me. If it were you from before, I don\u2019t think you would have even thought of such harsh words.\u201dLubella thought that she might have talked too rashly and hung her head in embarrassment.\u201cBut that\u2019s right. He\u2019s someone who has given us a lot of help.\u201dZich had fought the Bellids, helped Lubella develop her character, and told them the solution to a vicious ritual; and now, he gave them the location of one of the Bellids\u2019 important bases.\u201cStill, both of you have to admit that he is a very mysterious figure.\u201dLubella and Weig nodded. They trusted Zich because of the enormous help they received from him, but Lubella and Weig also had to admit that Zich was suspicious in many ways.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t plan on harming him just because he is suspicious. You both can continue to believe him. But I will continue to suspect him\u2014it\u2019s part of my responsibility as a leader of a congregation.\u201d The Pope sighed deeply. He looked completely different from when he was laughing and looked much older than his age now. \u201cBeing a pope is difficult. I have to stand on a thin line between Karuna\u2019s teachings and the ways of this world.\u201d\u201cI admire your holiness for that reason.\u201d\u201cI feel the same way!\u201dBoth Karuwiman\u2019s greatest Holy Knight and a candidate certain to be the Saint assured him. Soon, color came back to the Pope\u2019s worn-out face.\u201c\u2026Hoho! This old man whined a bit. Yes, I mean, what\u2019s the problem when I have at least two people by my side?\u201d The Pope met both of their eyes. \u201cThis war will be one of the most intense wars you might ever see. Even throughout our Karuwiman history, we have never attacked the Bellids at this scale. And you both must lead at the front. Are you confident that you can do that?\u201dThe Pope couldn\u2019t hide the greatest Holy Knight and future Saint from battle just because they were too precious to him.\u201cOf course. From the first place, Sir Zich has brought this information to us. Besides, there is no greater final deed than this for Lady Lubella to do right before she becomes the Saint. And most of all, isn\u2019t this a holy war? Just participating in it is a great honor itself.\u201d\u201cBesides the part about the final deed, I have the same opinions as Sir Weig.\u201d\u201cThen, that\u2019s enough.\u201d The Pope nodded his head in satisfaction. \u201cWith the Holy Knights and priests that are gathering here and you both, we will be able to vanquish the Bellid\u2019s base.\u201dThen, the Pope suddenly thought of something and licked his lips.\u201cIt would have been better if we were able to call Sir Zenard.\u201dLubella asked, \u201cAre you talking about the person who received the title of Honorary Holy Knight?\u201d\u201cYes, his character is noble, and his skills are much greater than his age range. Now that I think about it, he is like Zich in some ways.\u201dBoth of them were young, skilled, and lived with the motto to do good deeds; but of course, they seemed to have opposite personality types.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that our message didn\u2019t reach him. But what can we do? Honorary Holy Knights are not someone we can just call whenever we want.\u201d\u201cAre we still talking about Sir Zenard?\u201d\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d the Pope asked in surprise when he saw that Lubella seemed a bit displeased about the topic.\u201cNo, there\u2019s no problem. It\u2019s just that whenever I meet him, he always asks me if I am worried about something.\u201d\u201cSir Zenard must have an interest in Lady Lubella,\u201d Weig laughed. He was like a typical old person who enjoyed hearing the love lives of young people. Lubella sighed. \u201cAs someone serving Karuna, I will not date or marry. Don\u2019t you all know this?\u201d\u201cAh, I can already hear the sound of men who yearn for you, bleeding tears and blood at those words.\u201d\u201cIf you keep teasing me, I\u2019m going to try my hardest to arrange a date for you.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m too old for that.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know that love in old age is more romantic?\u201dWeig had tried to tease Lubella a bit, but he suffered a total loss. Weig made a fake cough and turned his head\u2014he was admitting his silent defeat.\u201cOur conversation went off-topic. But Sir Zenard doesn\u2019t seem to have feelings for me or anything like that. He had a gaze like he was searching for something.\u201d\u201cHmm. He might have been trying to test you since you are going to be the next Saint. If you feel uncomfortable around him, I can say something to him. Even if his intentions are good, if the other party feels uncomfortable, we have to put an end to the matter.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. He hasn\u2019t been doing it these days.\u201d\u201cMaybe his curiosity disappeared. But if there\u2019s anything that causes you discomfort, please tell me or his Holiness. We will try to mediate the dispute. Your Holiness, you will also\u2026\u201d Weig\u2019s sentence also trailed off.The Pope was staring at Lubella. He seemed to be looking at her expectantly, but there was also mischief mixed into his gaze.\u201c\u2026What is it, Your Holiness?\u201d Lubella noticed the Pope\u2019s gaze and asked him in surprise. Then, the Pope said in a clearly disappointed voice, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to say that you will arrange a date for me too? I\u2019m saddened that you only care for Sir Weig.\u201dA short silence followed. Lubella looked taken aback while Weig burst out in laughter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 94": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe knights\u2019 spears rose high as if they were going to pierce the sky. The swords on their hips were sharp, and the shields on their arms were thick and sturdy. The battle horses were muscular and moved in a steady line, following right behind the tail of the horse in front of them. The knights looked as if they were apostles sent from heaven.Behind them, people wearing white robes and holding a long staff rode on a wagon pulled by a working horse. There were also priests who prayed for the blessing and safety of their comrades who were going to battle and enact judgment and punishment upon their enemies.All of them had the same symbols embedded on their clothes: the Karuwiman symbol. They were the military force that had gathered to fight against the Bellid. They gave off such a tense and sharp atmosphere that it was incredibly difficult to approach them. Their determination to go to war was motivated by the idea of sacrificing their lives for the cause. Even if they died in this battle, they would be merely departing from their flesh and going to Karuna\u2019s side for a life of eternal happiness. Their faith relieved them from their fear and made them even more fearsome in battle.Weig, who was advancing from the very front, raised his hand. In an instant, the entire military force halted. While holding the reins, Weig observed ahead. The vast wilderness he had seen lay before him. He saw the groove where he and Zich had hidden their horses last time, and from further away, he saw the large stone that led to the Bellids\u2019 cave.\u201cIt\u2019s over there.\u201d When Weig pointed his fingers at a rock from a distance, all the people of Karuwiman stared at the rock. \u201cBeneath that rock, there is an entrance to an underground cave.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s finally starting.\u201d Lubella tightly gripped her reins next to Weig. Her heart pounded in anticipation and nervousness.\u201cYes. We are finally starting judgment against those blasted Bellids.\u201d Even Weig was excited by the upcoming war; his eyes were already full of bloodlust. This was the same for the rest of the Karuwiman soldiers. Whether it was big or small, a fiery fire formed in the hearts of all the women and men of Karuwiman.However, one person did not share their sentiments. Zich was extremely calm; no, the coldness of the sword he sharpened inside his heart made him emit a freezing atmosphere. His icy, cold heart completely contrasted the fiery hearts of the soldiers around him.Zich let go of his reins and got down from his horse. It had already been agreed upon that Zich would go ahead and infiltrate the temple first.\u201cPlease be careful.\u201d\u201cMr. Zich, be careful.\u201dWeig and Lubella expressed their concerns. It was an incredibly difficult task to secretly infiltrate a place. Moreover, the place he had to infiltrate was the infamous Bellid\u2019s northern branch.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Even if I\u2019m captured, there\u2019s not much information I know.\u201dKaruwiman didn\u2019t inform Zich about the details of their military force, and Zich also avoided any information about it intentionally. All of that had also been agreed upon.Lubella glared at him and said, \u201cYou know we didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d\u201cYes, you are right. All right. I will be careful, but you don\u2019t have to be really worried about me. I\u2019m going in first because I have a plan in mind. A shameful thing like being captured by the Bellids will never happen to me.\u201dThen Zich glanced next to Lubella; Hans and Snoc were on their horses. \u201cPlease take care of those two.\u201dZich decided to leave the two of them behind. It was too much for even Zich to secretly infiltrate the Bellid temple while carrying those two luggages around.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will take good ca\u2014\u201dEven though it was Zich\u2019s decision to go by himself, Weig felt bitter that he was pushing Zich to a very dangerous situation. In order to lighten Zich\u2019s load, Weig was going to secure Hans and Snoc\u2019s safety.However, this was not what Zich wanted. \u201cNo, make sure to fully utilize them. Don\u2019t protect them and push them onto the frontlines as much as possible.\u201dHans and Snoc let out gasps at the same time. Zich was Zich.\u201cI trained them at least that much. They would at least be able to take care of themselves.\u201d\u201cThey could die on the battlefield.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t just keep them in my nest the whole time. They need to learn how to fly by themselves. If they can\u2019t and fall to the ground and die, it can\u2019t be helped.\u201dHans and Snoc\u2019s bodies trembled. They felt bleak that they would jump head-first into battle without Zich\u2019s support. But surprisingly, they felt nervous but not so afraid that their bodies would freeze. It was definitely a result of Zich\u2019s gruesome training; they were not sure if they should be happy or horrified.Weig also agreed with Zich\u2019s decision. He was also a knight who wielded his sword and constantly faced life and death situations.Weig nodded and said, \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cThen I will go ahead.\u201d Zich\u2019s body quickly moved and soon disappeared below the rock. Weig, Lubella, and Hans never moved their eyes away from him until he fully disappeared.Lubella asked, \u201c\u2026Will he really be alright?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t think the success rate is very high,\u201d Weig coldly replied, and Lubella widened her eyes in shock.\u201cThen\u2026!\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s Mr. Zich after all. If I think back to all the unimaginable feats he was able to do, I think it\u2019s enough for us to put our faith in him. Also, look at those two.\u201d Weig pointed towards Hans and Snoc. They were checking their weapons and doing image training on how they were going to fight.\u201cThose two closest to Zich show no signs of worry.\u201dIt was not as if Snoc and Hans were not interested in Zich\u2019s well-being. They just had firm trust in Zich\u2019s ability to survive. They reached a point where they realized that worrying about Zich was the most pointless action in the world.\u201c\u2026Is that so.\u201d\u201cIf Mr. Zich succeeds, it\u2019ll be easier for us. So let\u2019s all try trusting him for our sake.\u201dWeig raised his hand again and stretched it out in front of him. With this signal, the military force began moving again. Their destination was the Bellid temple inside the cave, and their goal was the complete extermination of all the Bellids.* * *Zich went through the cave speedily.\u2018I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve noticed that the Karuwimans are here by now.\u2019The Karuwimans had an impressive ability to block information. Since they had also dispersed their troops secretively, the Bellids failed to detect the Karuwiman army until they were in front of the northern branch\u2019s entrance. But now, there was no way the Bellids didn\u2019t know.\u2018How could they not know when the Karuwimans have gathered their troops in front of their base like this?\u2019 Zich was sure that the Bellids were hurriedly making defense plans. \u2018As expected, they don\u2019t have many troops in the cave.\u2019The Bellids were probably going to use the lake\u2019s geographical advantage to create a barrier between them and their enemy. Unlike the Karuwimans who had gathered their elite troops from their major branches, the Bellids had an army for only one base. Naturally, the Karuwimans had the upper hand. That was one of the key reasons why Zich had forced Hans and Snoc to participate in this war.\u2018In a war, it\u2019s very rare for one side to have so many advantages, including the element of surprise.\u201dStomp!Zich arrived in front of the lake. He saw people moving in a rush inside the Bellid\u2019s temple. He placed the clothes and items he brought into his magic box. Then, he jumped into the lake, and with a small ripple, Zich\u2019s body disappeared into the water. He slowly but carefully began to cross the lake.* * *Karuwiman\u2019s forces began to enter the cave in full scale. Because the entrance under the rock looked small, it looked like it would take a long time for all the troops to enter. But Weig\u2019s solution to that issue was simple.Craaaash!The entrance exploded with a loud sound. With one blow of his sword, a whole boulder that had stood on top of the wilderness for ages flew out of the ground. A cloud of dust flew out, and an entrance that was bigger than the original by multiple times appeared into view.Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!They looked like an army of militant angels marching to Hell. They didn\u2019t fear the cave\u2019s pitch-black darkness without a strain of sunlight and continued their footsteps. Soon, Karuwiman\u2019s army arrived in front of the lake. People admired the sheer size of the cave and the huge lake right in front of it. Then, when they saw the Bellid temple just across from them, they exuded out masses of bloodlust.On the other side, the Bellids seemed to have noticed the size of the Karuwiman\u2019s forces and their movements became much more intense. Mass of people soon came out of the building, and the Bellids and the Karuwimans faced each other with the lake between them. Even though they were still far away from each other, the tension and bloodthirst in the air were almost tangible. As the two groups were fixated on keeping each other in check, no one noticed a figure secretly sneaking into the side of the temple.* * *\u2018Let me see. Isn\u2019t it around here?\u2019Taking advantage of the fact that the Bellids were preoccupied with the Karuwimans, Zich got out of the lake and crept into a deserted place. But he couldn\u2019t avoid all confrontation, and some managed to spot him.Slice!\u201cUgh!\u201dOf course, the unfortunate ones who noticed Zich met their deaths. Zich placed the dead followers of Bellu into his magic box and continued moving.\u2018This is quite a good sword.\u2019The sword he got from Steelwall broke from the time he fought the mysterious magician. The sword he was using right now was what the Karuwiman had given him, and it was much better than his previous one.Zich continued to move. He followed the temple\u2019s walls and went straight ahead.\u2018It\u2019s here!\u2019Zich saw a small door. It was incomparable to the majestic entrance of the temple, but the door was big enough for Zich to go through. Zich couldn\u2019t feel a presence behind the door, and he opened it. The inside was dark. With all kinds of boxes and items piled up, it seemed like it was a storage room.\u2018It\u2019s the same.\u2019Zich smirked. He knew the temple\u2019s structure well\u2014and it wasn\u2019t because he had an unbelievable skill that let him grasp the interior of the building just by seeing its exterior. It was actually the opposite.\u201cI remember breaking this place down to bits.\u2019Before his regression, Zich considered the Bellids as a thorn to his side and he completely dismantled this entire building. He didn\u2019t even let his subordinates touch this place and did it all by himself. He broke, broke, and then broke some more. He broke down the place so thoroughly that he remembered the building\u2019s interior even to this day. For Zich, who forgot trivial matters easily, this was very surprising.\u201cI also found many secret paths and rooms during that time.\u2019If the Bellids knew of this, they would have clutched onto the back of their necks in rage. Zich got out of the storage room. Bellid followers were running around the building, and Zich passed between them like a ghost. Since most of their focus was on the Karuwimans who were on the other side of the lake, it was difficult for them to notice Zich.\u2018Trislowa must be outside.\u2019Since he was responsible for this base, it was certain that he would be outside to lead.\u2018I should lead him back inside.\u2019After all, the whole reason why Zich had escalated the situation to this level was to finish off Trislowa. It was better to drag Trislowa back in to cause a diversion and create the best chance to torment him.\u2018I can\u2019t let the Karuwimans have him.\u2019Zich\u2019s eyes shone menacingly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMost people in the world shared the same opinions about the religion of Bellid: an evil to the world.One of the reasons why the Karuwiman was so exalted was because they made Bellid their main enemy and acted as exterminators whenever they found a Bellid. Even the Karuwiman Pope was willing to trick neighboring countries to raid Bellid, and he made it clear that even if they strained their diplomacy, all the countries would understand if he said it had all been done to exterminate the Bellids. That was how much all the nations were unified in their antagonism against the Bellids.However, as religions like these spread, the Bellid survived against the world\u2019s hatred and persecution and continued to increase their numbers in the dark. The word \u2018pest\u2019 was really fitting for them.On the other hand, the Bellids who were always on the side of torturing a nation, estate, force, or people, were now the ones being pushed to a corner.\u201cWhat is the size of their army?\u201d The leader of the northern branch and a Cardinal of Bellid\u2014Cullun Trislowa\u2014glared menacingly at the Karuwimans heading towards them.The priest next to him quickly replied, \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it seems to be a little more than a thousand!\u201dA thousand. It was a sizable force, and the Cardinal also had around this number of followers in this temple. However, the quality of the soldiers was different.\u201cAre they all holy knights or high priests?\u201d\u201cYes, that seems to be the case!\u201dIf they came all the way to a central branch, the Karuwimans would have definitely brought their most elite soldiers. And with Karuwiman\u2019s elite soldiers, a thousand of ordinary Bellid followers would be wiped out in an instant.\u201cDamn it! How were they able to find this place!\u201d Annoyed, Trislowa smashed the ground with his feet.The Bellid\u2019s northern branch was on an enormous lake below a dry, desolate wilderness. According to their history, when Bellid followers first saw this miraculous sight in front of them, it was said that tears streamed down their faces. The followers of Bellid said that Bellu sent down a miracle to help his followers hide from the persecution of the world. And true to their beliefs, since its first establishment, this area continued to be a reliable center for the northern branch. He didn\u2019t know where the information had been leaked, but their number one enemy, the Karuwiman, was now leading an elite army against them.\u2018It\u2019s too late to call for reinforcements!\u2019The enemy was already right in front of them and standing on the other side of the lake. They were about to cross the lake.\u201cTreble brothers,\u201d Trislowa called out to the high priests right below him.\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\u201cYou command the troops and stop those Karuwiman from crossing the lake!\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dWithout any rebuttals, the Treble brothers immediately followed Trislowa\u2019s order. Trislowa pushed back his duty and headed back to the temple.\u2018I first have to pack that.\u2019Even if everyone in this branch died, he needed to protect \u201cthat.\u201d So contrary to Zich\u2019s expectations, Trislowa immediately headed back inside the temple.* * *Zich rummaged through the temple. No matter how skilled he was, it was extremely dangerous for him to infiltrate the Bellid temple in a turbulent time like this. To prepare for the worst-case scenario, Zich made sure that all the places in the temple were the same as his memory, so he could easily find a path to escape.\u2018Hmmm, everything is the same.\u2019After Zich twisted another priest\u2019s neck, he made sure that this room was also the same as in his memory. Zich went down the basement again. As soon as he went down, an awful smell wafted up to his nose. In the middle of a hallway, a prison with bars spread out in front of him.\u2018This is also the same.\u2019Numerous people were crowded inside the prison. The people in there were not criminals waiting to be judged but were probably being used as sacrifices, experiments, or even play things by the Bellid. From a glance, the people inside the prison looked extremely weak and unhealthy. However, Zich had no intention to free them right away.\u2018They are not my priority right now.\u2019But they might have a use later on. Zich quietly came out from the basement and went around, checking if the prison was also identical to his memory.\u2018Then let\u2019s head off to the most important place.\u2019A temple was a building built to worship god. Of course, the most important place in the temple was the prayer room, where they could pray to god.\u2018If my memory serves right, it was the large room a bit behind the center of the temple.\u2019No, it was difficult to call the prayer room a room. It was an enormous space that could fit a couple of average homes. That was how big the temple was. Zich secretly hid inside the prayer room. Due to the Karuwiman\u2019s surprise attack, the prayer room was completely empty.On the wall at the end of the room hung a large tapestry embroidered with the sign of Bellid, and a large platform was underneath it. From the center, an artificial lake occupied more than half of the room, and two paths passed through the sides of the room and intersected with the center of the room.\u2018That is?\u2019Zich\u2019s eyes sparkled. At the intersection of the two paths, an object was placed on a high altar. The pyramid-shaped object was as small as a fist, and from its smooth surface, it reflected the surrounding light and let out a soft, silver light.\u2018That was being made here?\u2019For a moment, Zich was surprised to see an object that he hadn\u2019t expected at all. But then he soon smiled. If he had that, Trislowa would prioritize Zich\u2019s capture even more than the ongoing battle.* * *Trislowa walked steadily forward. After he retrieved \u201cthat\u201d object in the prayer room, he was going to pray to Bellu to send his blessings upon them for their upcoming battle. But when he reached the prayer room\u2026\u201cHonorable Cardinal!\u201dA priest stopped him; there was desperation in the priest\u2019s face.\u201cI-in the prayer room\u2014!\u201dSlam!Without even listening to him, Trislowa pushed him away. After the priest slammed into a wall, he rolled on the ground. But Trislowa did not even blink an eye. There was something much more important to him than the life of one priest.\u2018No way\u2026!\u2019If a problem arose in the prayer room, it must definitely be connected to the Karuwimans who were storming in right now; and that was absolutely the worst scenario. The door of the prayer room was completely open. He quickly went inside and saw someone sitting on top of the platform. Several knights and priests were surrounding the platform. He even saw some dead knights and priests on the ground. Judging by the bloody sword on the man sitting on the platform, it was safe to assume that he was the one who killed all the people on the ground.But that was not the problem. The object that should be on top of the altar was gone. It was now in the hands of the mysterious man sitting on the platform. Trislowa\u2019s eyes turned murderous. He cautiously approached the platform, and the knights and priests opened a pathway for him.As Zich stood on top of the podium, Trislowa stood below him and met Zich\u2019s eyes. Trislowa gestured to the knights and priests in his surroundings, and they all backed off two steps. However, they continued to surround Zich and looked ready to siege and chop Zich into pieces if Trislowa signaled them to do so.Zich spoke first. \u201cWhoa. You came faster than I expected. Weren\u2019t you on the battlefield?\u201d\u201cWho are you? Are you Karuwiman\u2019s dog?\u201d Trislowa asked in a voice filled with rage. His gaze went back and forth between Zich and the item he was holding.\u201cI\u2019m someone who has a personal grudge against you.\u201d\u201cThat means you are a foolish person who doesn\u2019t understand and follow Bellu.\u201d\u201cWe have a slight difference of opinions. I think you guys are the ones similar to pests who crawl on the dirty ground, unable to reason and worship a fish head like Bellu as a god.\u201dZich could feel that the people encircling him were greatly irked by his words. Trislowa\u2019s bloodlust became stronger, but all Zich did was tilt his head a bit.\u201c\u2026For a bastard like you\u2014\u201d\u201cAh, wait a moment. I have something to ask you.\u201d Zich cut off his words.\u201cHey, Bellid\u2019s Honorary Cardinal, Cullun Trislowa.\u201dTrislowa wasn\u2019t surprised that Zich knew his identity. Everyone who felt even a little bit antagonistic about the Bellids knew who Trislowa was; that was how famous and central a figure like Trislowa was.\u201cDid you play around with the people living in the outskirts of a village a couple of days ago? Did you also cast magic on a boy so that he wouldn\u2019t die while being tortured?\u201d\u201cDid you intrude this place for revenge?\u201d Trislowa couldn\u2019t comprehend it at all; he couldn\u2019t believe that Zich would come all the way here for such an insignificant reason. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true. I went to a village to get some food and saw a boy.\u201d\u201cSo, you killed him?\u201d\u201cHe is just one of the poor. They are like insects living day by day. Even if those kinds of guys disappear from the world, no problems will arise. Above all, we are people who will rule over the world under Bellu\u2019s great blessings. Since we will be the rulers of this world, they should think that giving us pleasure and dying by our hands is the greatest honor they can ever achieve.\u201d\u201cI heard that you told the boy that everything was his fault as you tortured him.\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s true.\u201d Trislowa cackled. \u201cIt was impulsive. As soon as I met the boy\u2019s eyes, I made up my mind to kill him. I killed the boy\u2019s parents and his neighbors with the same line of thought. So I\u2019m right. Everything happened because of the boy.\u201dTrislowa thought it was a very convincing argument, and other followers of Bellid nodded their heads in agreement. This was their general way of thinking and the reason why they were treated as heretics by the whole world.\u201cHmm. Okay. If that\u2019s how you perceive it.\u201dTrislowa\u2019s response didn\u2019t betray Zich\u2019s expectations even slightly. Zich\u2019s eyes narrowed.Boooom!They heard an explosive sound from far away, and the impact of the collision shook the building slightly. It was clear that the battle between the Karuwimans and the Bellids had begun. Trislowa knew that he couldn\u2019t waste any more time. He tried to attack Zich and take the item Zich was holding, but Zich opened his mouth again.\u201cBy the way, you asked me if I was Karuwiman\u2019s dog. You must think the Karuwimans ordered me to infiltrate this place for some reason.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the case?\u201d\u201cNot at all. You are completely wrong.\u201d Zich raised his thumb and shook it sideways. \u201cYou are mixing up the cause and effect. I\u2019m the one who called them here.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dZich\u2019s unexpected response surprised Trislowa.\u201cYou might be wondering how the Karuwimans found out about your secret hideout. It must have been really surprising since this base has never been found out by any outsiders since its foundation. Truthfully, the Karuwimans didn\u2019t know this place\u2019s location either. They looked all over the world to capture you, but who could have imagined that there was a place like this under a dry wilderness? So now, you tell me\u2014who do you think told Karuwimans about this location?\u201dZich smiled; it was the one he commonly made while flaming his opponents\u2019 emotions. \u201cIt\u2019s me. I told them.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI learned about this base by coincidence. And I knew that you, Cullun Trislowa, would be here. So I immediately let the Karuwimans know about this place.\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201d Trislowa was filled with fury as he listened to Zich. He wanted to immediately slice Zich\u2019s neck, but Zich wasn\u2019t finished yet.\u201cDo you now realize the main reason why I told the Karuwimans about this base? Do you think it\u2019s because I hate you guys? It\u2019s true that I hate Bellids to the point that I think they are hopeless pests, but that\u2019s not it. Do you think it\u2019s because I like the Karuwimans? I don\u2019t want to be on their opposing side, but I have no intention of going out of my way to get on their good side either. Then, what do you think the main reason is?\u201dIt was a very trivial reason.\u201cYou killed a boy whom I cared for\u2014\u201dNot just that, but tortured him while doing so.\u201cLet me organize everything for you. The reason why the Karuwimans have come to this base is because I told them the location of this place. And the reason why I told them this information is because I was furious at the Bellids. And the reason why I was furious was because the boy I mentioned died a painful death.\u201dZich didn\u2019t plan on using his catchphrase, \u2018How sweet was your moment of hope?\u2019 this time; he had another phrase in mind that he wanted to use more.\u201cDo you remember what you said to the boy? You said that the reason why his parents and neighbors died was all because of him. Then, what do you think is the reason why the Karuwiman\u2019s troops have gathered in front of the Bellid\u2019s northern base?\u201dZich snickered while seeing Trislowa\u2019s face twist with rage.\u201cCullun Trislowa. It\u2019s all because of you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In contrast, Zich was delighted; he became happier the more Trislowa became furious.\u201cWhy are you getting so agitated? Am I wrong? If you hadn\u2019t hurt that boy, all of this would have never happened. Then isn\u2019t it right for me to say that this whole situation happened because of you?\u201d\u201cYou bastaaaaard!\u201d Trislowa couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer. He shook his hand.Pop!The water inside the prayer room began to tremble like crazy. The water from the lake began to soar and rise above Zich.Tap!Zich jumped up. He shoved his fingers in a wall and hung from above.\u201cOh my! I thought you would definitely be able to understand my words because you were the one who told that boy that everything was his fault. Did that fish head Bellu tell you that you guys didn\u2019t need to be responsible for anything? No wonder, it\u2019s easier for that fish head. Why are you guys worshipping a god like that?\u201d\u201cDieeeee!\u201dCrash!The water pillar targeted Zich, but Zich easily avoided the attack by climbing higher.\u201cHey, don\u2019t be so agitated. What are you gonna do if something bad happens to this?\u201dThe followers of Bellid running towards Zich halted. Even Trislowa, who was fiercely attacking a moment ago, hesitated.\u201cI guess getting attacked by the Karuwimans was really scary. So much so that you would just leave this unattended in the middle of a prayer room.\u201dTrislowa made a groan. He wasn\u2019t scared of the Karuwimans, but it was true that he had left \u201cthat\u201d unattended. Even though the object had to be left on top of the altar for it to become complete, he should have left a high-level defense team.\u2018In that short amount of time, I didn\u2019t think that would get stolen.\u2019However, he couldn\u2019t really help it. Since the Karuwimans were right in front of him, how could he have placed a high-level defense team here?\u201cI know what this is. It\u2019s the artifact that controls monsters. Let me see, was the name Pyramid of Vengeful Souls?\u201d\u201c\u2026How the fuck do you know that?\u201dZich knew the reason why the boy\u2019s village suddenly became crowded with monsters. Before he regressed, there was a time when the Bellids completely swept the world. The Bellids were so strong that even the Karuwimans were forced to continuously retreat although they were allied with many countries. The reason for the Bellids\u2019 relentless victory was because they had the ability to control high-level monsters. They were not just able to control common monsters like goblins and orcs, but extremely strong monsters that appeared in legends. They were able to control extremely powerful monsters all thanks to their artifact, \u2018Pyramid of Vengeful Souls.\u2019\u2018Since Trislowa had the Pyramid of Vengeful Souls, the monsters must have been drawn towards him by instinct. \u2018Since the artifact was not complete yet, only low-level monsters were unconsciously drawn towards it, but once the artifact was finished, they would be able to cause huge destruction to the whole world.\u2018The reason why he tortured the boy was probably not only for enjoyment but also to complete this.\u2019As the name indicated, the way to make the \u2018Pyramid of Vengeful Souls\u2019 was extremely cruel and vicious. A lot of ingredients were required to make this artifact, but the most important one was the negative emotions of innocent souls. And what the Bellid usually did to bring out these types of emotions was what they did to the boy.\u201cAs you can tell, I know a bit about things. How about it? Are you feeling a bit threatened? If I\u2019m not careful, I might accidentally break this item that is so precious to you guys.\u201d\u201cHah! Do you think we won\u2019t be able to harm you because you might break our sacred object? The Pyramid of Vengeful Souls won\u2019t be that easy to break!\u201dTrislowa only flinched because he hadn\u2019t expected Zich to use the sacred object as a shield. Just like its world-shattering ability, the Pyramid of Vengeful Souls was an extremely tough item. Trislowas raised another water pillar, and the other followers of Bellid also changed to an attack formation.With his current strength, Zich couldn\u2019t win against them. The other followers didn\u2019t matter, but Trislowa really was one of the strongest people in Bellid. However, Zich didn\u2019t feel very threatened.\u201cHmmm. I\u2019m definitely at a disadvantage with this formation.\u201d\u201cDid you just realize that! But it\u2019s too late. I\u2019ll give you the most brutal death in the world!\u201d\u201cHahaha! There\u2019s another person who has the same impossible dream. But it\u2019s alright. I\u2019m cheering for you. People must have a dream to live!\u201dCrash!Zich evaded another water bomb.\u201cIt\u2019s foolish for me to insist on a head-to-head battle even though there\u2019s a clear difference in strength between us. Should I try escaping?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh! How are you going to escape from here!\u201dBellid\u2019s knights and high priests were surrounding him, but most of all, Trislowa himself was blocking him. The only entrance was an exit far away from Zich; in this situation, it seemed as if Zich\u2019s escape was impossible. But it only seemed like it.\u201cWhere would I be running to?\u201dZich made a big movement with the hands he shoved into the wall and pushed his body up. He didn\u2019t move very far. All he did was land a bit below him to the side.\u201cHah! You talk about escape with a movement like that? Well, I guess it really fits you. A stupid choice fitting for a rat.\u201d\u201cThen should I meet your expectations and really move like a rat?\u201d At the same time, Zich jumped and hit three walls about twice the height of a person.Open!A door that was disguised as a wall opened.\u201c!!!\u201dTrislowa, as well as all the followers of Bellid, widened their eyes as if they were going to pop out of their eye sockets.\u201cT-th-that..!\u201d Trislowa was unable to finish his sentence and stuttered. He had no idea that there was something like that in a prayer room.\u201cYour reactions are strange? Did you perhaps forget about this secret entrance?\u201d\u201cH-how did you know\u2014!\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s not something for you to know.\u201d Zich smiled brightly and then waved his hand at the followers of Bellid. \u201cThen, this rat will escape through a rat hole.\u201dZich proudly put the \u2018Pyramid of Vengeful Souls\u2019 in a magic box and shouted out to Trislowa: \u201cSqueak! Squeak!\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dAnyone could see that Zich was mocking him. While leaving the completely red-faced Trislowa behind, Zich disappeared into the secret entrance.\u201cCapture himmmmmm!\u201dThe fury in Trislowa\u2019s voice completely shook the whole prayer room.* * *While Zich was enjoying his time inside playing cat and mouse with his enemies, the battle between Bellid and Karuwiman was going on in full force outside the temple.Pop! Pop!Karuwiman\u2019s holy attacks continued to fly across the lake. The light attacks were imbued with holy power and lit up the inside of the cave; then the attacks landed on the Bellid\u2019s camp base. However, a strong barrier exuding Bellu\u2019s energy protected the temple from the flying attacks.Pop! Pop!Counterattacks also came from the Bellid. As the water jiggled, streams of water shot up.Karuwiman\u2019s priests cast a barrier on their side.Crash! Craaaash!Streams of water hit the barrier of light and collapsed. Lights shot up again, and the skirmish continued for a while.Then, the first one who changed the course of battle was the Karuwimans. Weig, who was near the center of the Karuwiman camp, walked right to the front of the lake. He pulled out his sword, and a metal chime rang out. Then he lightly swung his sword.Craaaaaash!The effect of his swing wasn\u2019t as light as his swing. The light that came off from his blade created an incredible explosion as it crashed into the barrier. The cave shook and the barrier wobbled visibly. Karuwiman\u2019s forces watched with high hopes while the Bellids looked at their barrier with concern. But in the end, the barrier didn\u2019t break.Bam! Bam Baaaam!Weig swung his sword a couple of more times, and the barrier wobbled every time but didn\u2019t break in the end. The Karuwimans felt frustrated, while the Bellids felt relief.\u201cThis won\u2019t end it.\u201dLubella said, \u201cIt seems like they are doing some ritual inside the temple to put up the barrier. If we continue to attack like this, we are going to consume a lot more energy and resources.\u201dIn response, Weig gave out an order. \u201cLet\u2019s move forward.\u201dThe only path that led across the lake was a small, narrow path that circled around the area. One side was blocked by the cave\u2019s walls, and the other side fell into the lake and wasn\u2019t suitable for an army to march over it. Furthermore, the Bellid knights were standing right in front of the path. Still, Weig deployed the Karuwiman troops to the area without hesitation.Thump! Thump! Thump!The sound of footsteps filled the whole cave, and the noise was assuring to their allies but terrifying to their enemies. The Bellid knights assumed their combat positions. But Weig didn\u2019t intend to only use that path; he knew that the more routes they had to cross the other side of the lake, the more advantageous it would be for them.A couple of Holy Knights came out of the lakeshore. They took out a magic box cast with a Storage Expansion spell from their clutches.Pop!A huge raft popped out of the magic box. The raft was made out of hardwood that floated over water well, but instead of a normal rope, the raft was held together with chains. In addition, the Holy Knights took out giant iron stakes.Slam! Slam!They didn\u2019t even need hammers. The Holy Knights smashed a stake deeply into the hard lakeshore.Clank!A Holy Knight took one of the loose, long chains from the raft, wrapped it around a stake, and fixed it tightly. Then, the Holy Knight plugged in a couple of other stakes onto the shore and tightly connected the stake and the raft with a chain.Thug!The Holy Knights climbed on top of the raft. When they walked to the edge of the raft, they used their magic box again.Splash!Another raft popped out, and they connected the new one with the one they were stepping on. Then, they got another one until they built a connected bridge that stretched across the whole lake. However, the bridge of rafts wasn\u2019t their only project in the making.\u201cThere!\u201d Snoc, who had been touching the dirt floor with his eyes closed, pointed at a section in the lake. \u201cThe water is shallow there!\u201dKoo!Nowem shouted in agreement. The Holy Knights approached where Snoc pointed. Then, they took out something from their magic box. It was a stake\u2014but it was different from the ones that the knights had stationed on the shores to fix the rafts\u2019 positions. It was huge. It was more accurate to describe it as a pillar, and the stake was about six times taller than a person\u2019s height. The Holy Knights hung the stake over the shoulders.Thud!One of the Holy Knights jumped over the lake. He moved the stake over his shoulder to his front and hugged it. As his body fell, he reached the lake\u2019s surface.Splash!The Holy Knights slammed down the stakes into the lake\u2019s surface with great force.Craaaash!Waves of water splashed in all directions with an explosive sound. It was hard to believe that a collision between water and a stake could create such noise. The lake\u2019s water wobbled like crazy, and the force of the impact even reached the other side of the lake. With that destructive force, the stake was successfully screwed into the bottom of the lake.Because the lake\u2019s floor was made up of sturdy rocks, the stake was firmly stationed into the ground. The head of the stake that looked above the lake\u2019s surface was flat and circular and secured a considerable amount of surface area.Thud!The Holy Knight who stuck the stake in got on top of the stake. Then, he repeated his actions multiple times. Soon, a stepping bridge made up of the stakes he pushed in appeared across the areas he passed.Karuwiman\u2019s elite forces were used to attacking over a lake or a river, because Bellid\u2019s temples often had these geographical features around their structures. Thus, they had done these kinds of battles many times before and even underwent special training to do so. Furthermore, this time, they even had someone like Snoc who could tell them the terrain or the depth of water beneath them. Snoc didn\u2019t yet have the power to pull up the entire floor beneath him and fill up the lake, but he could feel the structure of the lake\u2019s terrain.However, although the Karuwimans looked like they were advancing ahead, Weig didn\u2019t let his guard down. No matter how much training they had gone through or how experienced they were, it didn\u2019t change the fact that an aquatic environment favored the Bellids.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs piles of raft bridges gradually increased on the lake, Karuwiman and Bellid knights clashed from the front.\u201cHaaaap!\u201d\u201cHaat!\u201dThe leading knights swung their swords; their physical abilities had already been strengthened by the priests\u2019 blessings. They swung their swords filled with holy power, and as the swords clashed against each other, a menacing sound spread throughout the whole area. The battle was fierce, but since the pathway was still small, only a few people were able to engage in direct combat with the Bellids. The rest of the Karuwiman had their swords out and were staring at their opponents with murderous eyes. Unfortunately, even the Karuwiman hadn\u2019t found a miraculous way to rip apart the Bellid with just their eyes.The initial battle was in favor of the Karuwimans who had more battle experience and skill. However, as the Bellid knights slowly drew back and went inside the temple\u2019s barriers, the situation changed. They were able to use the temple\u2019s barrier as a support system to fight against the Karuwimans. Even though the Karuwiman army had stronger and more experienced soldiers, the damage they received slowly began to increase.Moreover, a full-fledged battle was occurring on top of the lake. The raft bridges and stepping stones already reached the center of the lake. As the Karuwimans came closer, most of their holy attacks were able to reach the Bellids; but at the same time, the Bellids\u2019 retaliation became even stronger.Crash! Crash!Water pillars soared above and crashed against those who were making the raft bridges.Splassh!The surface of the lake trembled violently and shook the raft bridges, breaking the balance of the Karuwiman troops and disconnecting the bridge at the same time.Swooosh!Small water droplets soared above and swarmed towards the Karuwiman army like an army of bees. However, the Karuwiman army did not easily give in. High-ranking priests, who were standing on an unshakable pile of stepping stones, held their hands tightly together and gathered their holy powers. Light filled up the whole cave again.Crash! Crash!The light barrier blocked the Bellids\u2019 attack. At the same time, a subtle light began to spread across the lake\u2019s surface.Swishh!As the light passed through the violently shaking lake, the lake became still as if nothing had happened.Bam! Bam!As if it was now their turn to attack, the Karuwimans started throwing balls of light and light beams against their enemies. However, the Bellids\u2019 barrier held steadfastly. The Karuwiman knights glared at the Bellids from across the lake but their attacks weren\u2019t able to reach them. The Bellid temple\u2019s barrier nullified the light attacks every time.In contrast, the Karuwiman priests were now the ones who had to quickly make light barriers to protect themselves from the Bellids\u2019 ferocious attacks. While these types of attacks went on, the Karuwimans finished making their raft bridges and stepping stones and were able to finally reach the other side of the lake. In a few moments, they would be able to make various attacks other than holy attacks from afar, and it would be much easier for the Karuwimans to attack.However, there was no way the Bellids would just let this happen. The Bellid priests closed their eyes and reached their hands towards the lake. The water began trembling like crazy again. The Karuwiman priests tried to desperately block this attack, but they were way too close to the temple. The energy from the temple significantly increased the Bellid priests\u2019 attacks.\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dA few Karuwiman knights were directly hit by the water pillars from the lake or fell in the violently shaking water. A knight who was building the rafts accidentally nailed the wrong side and a part of the raft bridge also became unusable. Weig watched all this from the other side of the lake. Even though casualties were slowly beginning to appear on the Karuwiman\u2019s side, his complexion did not change in the slightest. All battles were like this. No matter how perfect and overwhelming their victory would be, there would always be casualties. It was impossible to not receive some damage one way or another.\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d Lubella, who was standing next to Weig, let out a sigh. Every time a knight who was approaching the other side of the lake received damage, Lubella made a small cry. But Weig didn\u2019t turn around.\u2018She needs to get used to it.\u2019As long as the Bellid existed, Lubella would go through a lot of experiences like this. They needed to endure this. Weig wanted to immediately turn around and ask her if she was all right, but he repressed this emotion and continued to stare at the battle in front of him in silence. Again, a couple more Karuwiman knights were sacrificed.\u2018As expected, that barrier is a huge problem.\u2019The barrier blocked all holy attacks that the Karuwimans shot from afar, and it significantly increased the powers of all Bellids. But they would be able to overcome it since the Karuwiman army was significantly stronger. However, he couldn\u2019t deny that it would be better if the barrier was gone. After he left the deputy in command, Weig began moving again. He walked across the stepping stones. When he was about to reach the other side of the lake\u2014Thud!His movements became dull. As he felt his body grow heavier, he looked up. The disgusting energy of Bellu was pressing down upon him.Bam! Bam!As if they were waiting for this moment all along, the followers of Bellid began to immediately attack Weig. However, all the attacks against him were nullified by a swing from his sword.\u2018Hmm. This isn\u2019t too bad.\u2019An ordinary person would have been crushed under the pressure, but Weig was still full of energy. However, it was also difficult for even him to bring out his full skills. On the other hand, as he looked around, the situation was becoming more favorable for the Karuwimans.\u2018Since they are concentrating most of Bellu\u2019s energy on me, they don\u2019t have enough energy to back up the others.\u2019Just his existence here was extremely helpful to the overall battle. Weig stood straight on a raft and glared at the Bellid temple.\u2018It would be great if Zich could break this barrier.\u2019 Weig had this wishful thought while thinking of Zich who infiltrated the temple. Then he quickly resumed command while standing on a raft.* * *While Karuwiman and Bellid were fighting a fierce battle on the lake, there was a huge commotion going on inside the temple.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Trislowa swore and punched the wall with his fist. He wanted to rip apart that bastard, who dared to mock him, limb by limb while he was alive, but he had already lost sight of Zich. Even though Trislowa was currently stronger than Zich, he was ultimately a priest. In terms of physical strength, there was no way he could beat Zich who trained his body to the limits. Zich was also able to control a lot more of his mana than before, so his skill had significantly increased.Moreover, Zich knew every nick and corner of the temple\u2019s secret entrance and architecture\u2014something even Trislowa had no full knowledge of. Trislowa thought this whole situation was ridiculous, but this was the reality of his circumstances.\u2018Why the hell is there a secret passageway here\u2026\u2019Trislowa felt shocked as he emerged out of the secret passageway that Zich disappeared into. Trislowa was also familiar with the secret passageways of this temple. No, it was not an exaggeration to say that he knew all the secret passages that the Bellids currently knew. However, Trislowa wasn\u2019t aware of the secret passage that Zich used to escape.\u2018How does an outsider know of a secret passage that even I didn\u2019t know of?\u2019When they first built this temple, it was the Bellids\u2019 standard practice to dig up as many holes as possible to run out from. The secret passage that Zich escaped out of was one of them. But as time passed, people began to forget one or two of the passages that they had built in the past. Humans were forgetful animals, and even the Bellids were technically members of humanity. The strong belief that their place was the perfect hideout was also another factor in why they forgot some of the secret passageways. Trislowa was aware of all this, but he couldn\u2019t wrap his head around how an outsider like Zich knew a secret passageway that the current Bellids didn\u2019t know.\u2018He couldn\u2019t have secured a blueprint or anything like that.\u2019There was no blueprint or map with all the secret passages written on it. After the temple was completed, it was said that the blueprint was buried along with the constructors.\u2018Regardless, it\u2019s evident that he knows his way around this place, and most importantly, he has the Pyramid of Vengeful Souls in his possession.\u201d\u201cComrades!\u201d\u201cYes?!\u201dTrislowa called his fellow Bellids next to him.\u201cPlease go to the battlefront and bring some knights with fast legs. Gather about fifty of them in the prayer room.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dAs soon as the other priest disappeared, Trislowa gritted his teeth.\u2018Since we are battling the Karuwimans right now, taking out more men than fifty would be too much. But we have to get the Pyramid of Vengeful Souls back at all costs.\u2019Trisolwa had to find Zich as fast as possible and beat him to death. The men he would take out from the battlefront were soldiers that could be used to fight the battle with the Karuwimans, and Trislowa, who was one of the Bellid\u2019s greatest fighting forces, had to also get back on the battlefield as soon as possible.Trislowa dispersed the remaining troops in the temple as wide as possible. He commanded one group to block the entrance, and after he warned them that they must signal their location even if they were dying, he also went to look for Zich himself.But no matter where he went, he couldn\u2019t find Zich.\u2018That sneaky rat! He didn\u2019t really escape out of here, right?!\u2019He had ordered his men to block all the doors, but Zich somehow knew passageways that even he wasn\u2019t aware of. It wouldn\u2019t have been strange if Zich knew of a passageway that secretly led him outside, but Trislowa didn\u2019t think that Zich escaped.\u2018That guy had a clear motive for intruding.\u2019Even in their conversation, Zich had thoroughly let out his murderous intent. Zich\u2019s ultimate goal was revenge, and his purpose for trespassing into the temple was probably\u2026\u2018\u2026To cause chaos.\u2019In addition to Karuwiman\u2019s attack, there was an internal commotion because of Zich. Moreover, Zich was incredibly adept at causing this commotion.\u2018At the same time, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s zero chance that he just escaped.\u2019That was a serious problem. If Trislowa thought back to Zich\u2019s response when he first saw the artifact, the Pyramid of Vengeful Souls, Zich\u2019s main target didn\u2019t seem to be the item. But upon seeing it, Zich was able to instantly recognize the item\u2019s value.\u2018He might prioritize securing the sacred object now rather than causing chaos. He could have made his escape then.\u2019To Trislowa, losing the \u2018Pyramid of Vengeful Souls\u2019 was a bigger nightmare than losing the northern base, but he didn\u2019t have many options after losing sight of Zich.\u2018I can\u2019t do anything more than hope that he hasn\u2019t gone outside yet.\u2019In the end, Trislowa returned to the prayer room. There, he saw the group of knights that he had requested, waiting for him.\u201cA rat snuck into the temple.\u201d Trislow immediately spoke. \u201cHe stole the Pyramid of Vengeful Souls, and now, we have to retrieve our sacred object back at all costs no matter how dire our state of emergency is. That object is more important than our northern base!\u201dThe knights turned serious. Trislowa\u2019s mad eyes told them how important this job was.\u201cBut that rat\u2019s skills are noteworthy. He evaded my attacks multiple times, and his movements are nimble. They are not skills that we can just ignore. Furthermore, he somehow knows the structure of this temple and its hidden places well. So, all of you move in pairs and don\u2019t think about charging at him recklessly. Send a signal first. If he attacks, avoid it and if he tries to escape, try to follow him as tightly as you can. Stick close to him!\u201d Trislowa said his last words with great force and ended with a voice full of murderous intent. \u201cLet\u2019s corner him to a dead-end.\u201d\u2018Since he described himself as a rat\u2026\u2019 Trislowa planned to treat him like one. Trislowa\u2019s eyes became murderous and shone brightly.* * *While Trislowa was stirring up his bloodthirst for Zich, Zich went down to the basement. The prison he passed by before appeared in view again. Zich turned his head around and checked the area.\u2018There\u2019s no guard.\u2019Even the prison guards seemed to have been mobilized for the battle, as the seat set in place for the guard was empty. Zich walked to the guard seat.\u2018It\u2019s here.\u2019A key ring hung visibly on the wall. Zich grabbed the ring, and many keys clinked as they hit each other on the large ring. After Zich took the keys, he walked slowly towards the front of the prison and checked its insides. Unlike before when he had quickly glanced at them, he could now clearly see the prisoners. All of them were in seriously bad condition, and it was obvious that they endured great torture and violence for a long time.There were bloody scabs all over their bodies, and it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that their skin was like rags. As if all their tendons had been cut off, their limbs stretched loosely from their bodies. There were some who were muttering something like they had lost their minds, and there were also some with missing limbs. There were even people who were already dead.As if the prison had never been cleaned, people\u2019s wastes piled over the floor, and in the cramped space, everyone was smeared with filth. The place wasn\u2019t suitable for a human or even a domestic animal.But Zich looked at the prisoners with emotionless eyes as if he was looking at products in a market, and thought, \u2018Will these things be useful?\u2019 The people inside the prison feared Zich when they first saw him, thinking that he was a follower of Bellid. But then, they saw how his demeanor and clothing looked different from the Bellids and thought something was different from normal.Still, no one said anything to Zich. His appearance might be different from normal Bellids, but there was no evidence that he wasn\u2019t a Bellid follower. Zich walked the full length of the prison once and looked at the prisoners. Then, a satisfied smile appeared on his face.\u2018Well, this much will be\u2026\u2019Zich stood in the center of the prison. People stared at him with eyes mixed with rage and fear.\u201cEveryone,\u201d he stated, \u201cDon\u2019t you want revenge?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter he ordered his underlings to find Zich, Trislowa began to ponder. \u2018If he\u2019s trying to cause chaos internally, what\u2019s the first thing he\u2019d do?\u2019In challenging situations, one should attempt to predict their opponent\u2019s next move and plan accordingly. Trislowa predicted that Zich\u2019s first move would be to cause a commotion inside the temple to trap some of their military force inside and separate them from the rest of the force fighting against the Karuwimans.\u2018He\u2019s already succeeded in this.\u2019Even though thinking about Zich made Trislowa grit his teeth, he had to accept his present situation. Currently, Trislowa, the leader of the northern branch and the greatest military power, was tied up inside the temple and about 50 Bellid knights were also trapped with him. Moreover, people fighting on the forefront would be wondering why a part of their force was not in battle with them. If their curiosity turned into suspicions, the morale of their whole team would fall. In order to solve all these issues, Trislowa needed to deal with Zich as quickly as possible.\u2018If he didn\u2019t infiltrate for the purpose of stealing the sacred object, what did he infiltrate for?\u2019A thought immediately popped up inside his mind.\u2018The barrier.\u2019So far, the barrier was the number one contributor to driving back the Karuwimans and pulling his branch to its peak.\u2018Let\u2019s head to the ritual room.\u2019Trislowa quickly moved ahead; he soon reached the front of the ritual room. The door of the ritual room did not lose in extravagance compared to the door of the prayer room; the luxurious state of the door indicated how important the ritual room was to the whole temple. Trislowa opened the door. The first thing he saw was the statue of Bellu stationed in the center of the room. The unique head of the statue (which Zich called fish head) looked arrogantly down on all those who stared at it. A complicated magic circle was drawn on the floor, with the statue of Bellu in the middle.The ritual room was ginormous, only a little smaller than the prayer room, but the magic circle made up most of the space in the room. And on top of the ritual were numerous Bellid priests who had their knees on the ground, surrounding the statue of Bellu. They were the ones who were keeping the temple\u2019s barrier alive. Two knights were on guard to protect the Bellid priests. When the priests were performing the ritual, they were unable to react to even the slightest outside stimulation and had to focus all their attention on maintaining the barrier. For that reason, having guards was essential. However, due to the Karuwimans\u2019 surprise attack, only two knights were protecting the priests. It was embarrassing to even say there was a defense unit protecting the priests with only two people.Trislowa stopped the two knights who were about to say their greetings with his hands and focused his attention while leaning on the wall. As a priest, he didn\u2019t have sensing abilities like a knight. However, he was able to hide his presence. His holy power surrounded his whole body; the energy from Bellu in the ritual room further helped him hide his presence.If knights were like predators who sensed their prey and actively hunted their prey, he was a predator who camouflaged with his surroundings and waited to find the perfect opportunity to pounce on his prey.Click!Someone opened the ritual room. Trislowa\u2019s eyeballs rolled around. He made eye contact with the person who opened the door. Then, he smiled; his smile was sharp and murderous.Kwaaa!Trislowa immediately released the holy powers he was collecting in his hands. Even though the Bellid\u2019s specialty was controlling moisture, Trislowa was one of the strongest cardinals in the Bellid; just firing his holy power was strong enough to blast his enemies.Crash!\u201cUghh!\u201d\u2018I did it!\u2019 Trislowa was filled with bliss; the rat he threw his holy powers at was starting to come into view.Trislowa loudly shouted, \u201cFollow him!\u201dThe knights guarding the priests all looked at him.\u201cPut off the guarding and chase that bastard who ran away just now.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d\u201cI said, chase after him!\u201dTrislowa snarled at the reluctant guards. Without much choice, they started chasing after Zich.\u2018Right now, securing the sacred object is our top property. I have to prioritize catching that bastard over everything!\u2019There could also be more intruders. If there were more intruders, the priests in the ritual room would be easy prey since they were unable to move. However\u2026\u2018\u2026I just have to hope that doesn\u2019t happen.\u2019This was a once in a lifetime opportunity. They could not lose the sacred object here at all costs. If there were enough people, he could leave some guards behind; but right now, there were only two guards to help him. Since his opponent seemed to be pretty skilled, he needed their support to retrieve the sacred object. After ordering the guards to chase after Zich, Trislowa quickly ran out and followed behind. The only ones left were the priests, who were so focused on maintaining their ritual that they were unable to notice the commotion happening around them.Thud!When Trislowa went out, the door of the ritual room closed. There was a constant uproar outside the room. It seemed as if the injured Zich was doing a very good job running around, so the chase continued. The knights who were searching for Zich moved towards the sound of the commotion. A few more Bellid knights ran past the ritual room. The sound of people chasing after Zich moved further and further away from the ritual room. Soon enough, only soft murmurings could be heard in the front. Moreover, the thick walls in the ritual room blocked all sound. It sounded as if the commotion had passed.Creak!The door opened again.Thud!Like a rock dropped in still water, a footstep from the open door broke the silence. It was an incredibly light footstep. However, the resentment in this footstep was heavier than anything in this room. The door completely opened and dozens of people came rushing in. All of their clothes were ragged, their skin was covered with all kinds of dirt and dust, and their bodies were emaciated. Their hair was dirty and rough, and their beards were overgrown and tattered. Their eyes were sharp and the sharp glint in their eyes glistened in murderous rage\u2014they were the people who had been locked up in the temple\u2019s prison. One of them, Lewan South, glared at the Bellid priests in front of them with rage and recalled what happened to them earlier.* * *\u201cRevenge?\u201dEven while his mind was half-unconscious from being tortured and starved for so long, South responded to Zich\u2019s words.\u2018Revenge.\u2019 It was the wonderful word he had cried out to himself again and again while he was trapped here, and it appeared even in his dreams. It was a word that he could sacrifice the rest of his life for.\u201cYes, revenge!\u201dAs soon as Zich found a person who was interested in his words, he nodded to confirm his statement.\u201cI\u2019ve come here to save all of you. Outside, the Karuwimans have come to raid the Bellids.\u201dHope shone upon people\u2019s faces. Their hearts were filled with joy at the thought they could escape this hell.\u201cI have already secured the path to let all of you escape. Everyone just has to follow my words, but I was wondering if any of you are dissatisfied with just escaping like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026Revenge.\u201dSouth opened his mouth. It had been so long since he last talked that it was hard for him to move his tongue and his pronunciation was slightly off. His throat was also hoarse from screaming continuously.\u201cIs it possible?\u201d\u201cIt sure is.\u201d\u201cRevenge against the Bellids is possible?\u201d\u201cYes, revenge is possible.\u201dLike teaching a child who had just learned his first words, Zich repeated his words patiently without any signs of annoyance.\u201cSince someone\u2019s interested, let me explain right away. I am going to help everyone escape. But I\u2019m sure many of you want to rip apart the Bellid bastards.\u201d\u2018Many\u2019 was an understatement. Anyone who still had their senses left let out their bloodthirst. It was more accurate to say \u2018all of them\u2019 wanted revenge.\u201cSo, I will give you all a chance to get revenge.\u201d* * *South clutched onto his knife\u2019s handle tightly. Unlike before when the Bellids had cut off his tendons, he could make a fist now. His hand\u2019s condition was similar to when he had swung his large sword at monsters before the Bellids captured him.\u2018I can\u2019t believe he was able to cure me even after a lot of time passed since my tendons were sliced off.\u2019His savior had told him that the potions they took were the best quality potions that the Karuwimans made. Thus, it made sense how his injuries were all healed.\u2018I regained a bit of my strength now too.\u2019His body, which had weakened from injuries and starvation, felt stronger now. Of course, his whole physical condition wasn\u2019t the same as before. But it didn\u2019t matter.\u2018It\u2019s enough to kill those bastards.\u2019South raised his sword and approached the closest priest. As his savior told him, the Bellid priests didn\u2019t move even when he stood in close proximity.Smirk.A smile naturally formed on his lips. The sight of the priests praying in uniform\u2014like they were doing a solemn memorial service\u2014was despicable, and the thought that each of them would be shrieking soon made him laugh. South gestured with his fingers and his companions moved.Although everyone in the prison dreamed of revenge, many of them wanted to escape out of this hellish place as fast as possible. They didn\u2019t want to face any danger, so they escaped, and the people here now were those who had chosen revenge over escape. They wanted to show the Bellids a cruel retaliation even if they had to take a dangerous risk. Thus, they grouped in a cluster of four and approached a priest they liked. Of course, the expression \u2018liked\u2019 didn\u2019t include even an ounce of positivity.\u201c\u2026In one and two, we all pierce the priest we chose at once.\u201dThe swords that Zich had stored in his magic box weren\u2019t high-quality weapons, but they were enough to pierce humans clothed only in priest uniforms. The group held their swords hanging upside down and pointed at the priest\u2019s every limb.South counted, \u201cOne\u2026two!\u201dPush!He could hear the sound of skin tearing apart.\u201cAhhhh!\u201d\u201cAh! Ahhhh!\u201dSince the priests\u2019 entire attention was on the ritual, they screamed the very moment the swords pierced into them. Their screams filled the ritual room, and their screams were muffled by the room\u2019s thick walls. The priests who were not stabbed stayed focused on the ritual and barely noticed what was happening around them. There was no one who could help them.After losing their limbs, the priests who were stabbed became immobile and rolled on the ground like a piece of meat. They were hateful pieces of meat.\u201cKill them.\u201dPluck! Pluck! Pluck!\u201cUrgggggh! Urgh! Kkieh, Kkiaaaaaaah!\u201dLike a butcher cleaning up meat, they stuck their swords into the priests\u2019 bodies. The priests resisted, but they had the strength and stamina of a normal person and couldn\u2019t use their limbs, so their resistance was futile. In addition, even if their opponents were in a weakened state, South and his companions were moving in a group of four.\u201cStop!\u201d South shouted and stopped his companions. While they breathed harshly, his companions\u2019 eyes were filled with satisfaction.\u201cOkay, everyone. Let\u2019s move to our next work,\u201d South said while wiping the blood off his cheeks.\u201cThere are still many of them for us to enjoy.\u201dThey sloppily disposed of the meat pieces which used to be \u2018priests,\u2019 with their feet and moved onto their next target.* * *Trislowa chased after Zich. He looked threatening as he moved onto another priest\u2019s back. Besides him, there were a bunch of knights he had gathered together. After receiving Trislowa\u2019s blessing, their physical abilities were heightened, and they chased after Zich with menacing eyes.In comparison, Zich\u2019s state looked terrible. He was clutching onto his bleeding sides while staggering. He looked severely injured, but even in this condition, he was running well at a great speed. However, his unstable pace made it seem like it would come to an end soon.\u201cUrgh!\u201d Zich groaned and switched his direction to the side. Other Bellid\u2019s knights ran towards him in the same path.Trislowa shouted, \u201cYes, like that! Corner him! Since he acts like a rat, we have to treat him like one!\u201dThey looked as if they would capture Zich any moment now, so Trislowa was thrilled. He had high expectations to retrieve the artifact again. No matter how big the temple was, there was a limit to the places Zich could run to, and in the end, Zich was cornered.\u201cYou are good at running!\u201d Trislowa got off the knight\u2019s back and said confidently, \u201cBut in the end, this is your fate. Give me the artifact now. If you do that, I will show you mercy and let you die a painless death.\u201dOf course, this was a lie and Trislow had no intention to let Zich die peacefully. He was planning to torture Zich again and again until he got sick of it. But Zich was silent. He somewhat looked like he was desperately trying to get out of the situation and somewhat like he was despairing at his hopeless predicament.Trislowa didn\u2019t wait long; he didn\u2019t feel the need, nor did he have the time to do so. Thus, he was about to order his knights to kill Zich and take the holy item when\u2014Craaaaash!A large shock shook the whole temple.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe battle between the Bellids and Karuwimans was fierce. Whenever the Karuwimans launched offensive attacks to cross the lake, the Bellids fiercely resisted. Due to the Bellids\u2019 adamant resistance, the Karuwimans weren\u2019t able to secure a bridge to cross the lake yet.In this intense battle, Zich\u2019s two servants were bravely fighting on. Hans was stationed on the frontlines, and he directly engaged with the Bellid knights. Even though he was lower-skilled than his opponents\u2019, he maintained his ground. Zich\u2019s sinister, almost perverted training was showing its full effect again.\u2018In this area, I have to\u2014!\u2019 Hans found a small opening between the Karuwiman knights in front of him and moved his sword to stab a Bellid knight.\u201cUgh!\u201dClash!A Bellid knight quickly smacked Hans\u2019 cleverly positioned sword away. The force of the Bellid knight\u2019s sword made Hans\u2019 hands shake. However, Hans didn\u2019t let go of his sword and hurriedly backed away.Clash!\u201cArgh!\u201dThe Bellid, who lost his balance from Hans\u2019 attack, was hit by a Karuwiman knight and fell down. Hans continued to look for more openings.\u2018My body moved almost by instinct.\u2019The only time Hans experienced a large-scale battle like this was in the Dracul estate at Ospurin. However, since he was already in his second battle, his body skillfully moved along with his allies\u2019 movements. Even he surprised himself.\u2018Sir Zich\u2019s training really makes people speechless.\u2019Hans thought his competency in this battle was all thanks to Zich\u2019s training. However, that was not the only reason. Previously, Zich remarked that Hans\u2019 talent was comparable to Glen Zenard, one of the few people Zich approved of in strength alone; and through Zich\u2019s extreme training, Hans\u2019 talent was beginning to blossom in full display.Likewise, Snoc also played a significant part in this battle. He stood on a stepping stone in the center of a lake and fired his power over the earth towards his enemies.Bam! Bam!Huge earth pillars sprouted out from the walls of the cave next to the Bellid knights. The Bellid knights crushed the earth pillars with their swords. Even though they didn\u2019t receive much damage from these attacks, the pillars continued to pop out and hamper their focus.\u2018If I destroy the pathway that the frontline is standing on, I can attack them all at once.\u2019 Snoc felt regretful. However, in a situation where they had to increase more paths across the lake, he couldn\u2019t afford to destroy any pathways.\u2018Is it because I\u2019m still lacking in skill?\u2019 Even though Snoc was able to safely bring out Nowem\u2019s strength, he couldn\u2019t bring out all of it. If he could, then the first thing he would have done was to break this cave\u2019s ceiling and fill up the lake.\u2018Ah, but would Sir Zich scold me because the entire cave might collapse?\u2019No, if he could completely bring out Nowem\u2019s strength, he might be able to destroy everything that supported the cave and still hold up the entire cave with just his strength. Snoc glanced at Hans. Hans was his senior who joined Zich\u2019s team earlier than him and had longer experience being Zich\u2019s servant. Even though Hans didn\u2019t have a special existence like Nowem next to him, he was showing enormous skills using just his natural abilities.\u2018I should also work harder.\u2019Even though Hans was embarrassed by it, his efforts and goals (with Zich\u2019s advice) to become a hero greatly inspired Snoc.\u2018If I work hard like my senior, Hans, maybe I can also\u2026\u2019 If he worked hard, maybe his childhood dream he nervously told Sam might become a reality. Snoc blocked the Bellid\u2019s attacks and used his earthly powers to support shaky bridges; simultaneously, he continued to attack the Bellids.The battle went on. Without either side gaining a clear advantage, sacrifices were made with each passing minute. However, nothing went on forever. A change began to appear on the battlefield.Crash!\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dIn the center of the area protected by the barrier, a few Bellids were hit critically by the Karuwimans\u2019 light attacks. Regardless of which side they were on, both the Karuwimans and Bellids were shocked. On the other hand, both of the leaders from these two sides were quick to adapt.\u201cThe barrier has weakened! Immediately attack those outside the barrier!\u201d\u201cGet closer inside the barrier! Quickly!\u201dThe two sides immediately followed their superiors\u2019 orders. The Bellids who were now outside the barrier quickly moved back; however, not all of them were able to avoid the Karuwimans\u2019 speedy attacks.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201dThe number of Bellid followers who died from the Karuwimans\u2019 light attacks increased. The Karuwiman knights focused their utmost attention on the areas where the barrier had disappeared.\u201cGet your act together! Block them from coming closer!\u201dThe Bellids also quickly responded and fought back. However, their efforts were fruitless. The barrier kept getting smaller, and the energy of Bellu that supported the Bellids also decreased substantially; soon enough, the entire barrier disappeared. When the Bellids felt all of Bellu\u2019s energy disappear, their faces became filled with despair. In contrast to their despair, the Karuwimans responded back with greater energy and shouted a loud outcry.Weig tightly clenched his fists. The menacing pressure on his body was gone.\u2018It seems like Zich was successful.\u2019* * *\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Trislowa had been full of confidence after finally being able to capture Zich, but he was now hesitant and his expression froze. At the intense vibrations inside the cave, Trislowa looked up. The other knights were also surprised and looked around their surroundings.Thud!There was another shock, and then a large vibration. Some rock dust fell down from the ceiling. Even though sounds of an explosion could be heard every time the barrier blocked attacks from the Karuwiman, the sound this time sounded a bit different. Moreover, just the sound of an explosion would not be enough to shake the entire temple so that rock and debris dust would fall from the ceiling.It felt ominous. Anxiety began to fill up the hearts of all the Bellid followers.Then a calm voice spoke from somewhere, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing important, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dThe Bellid followers looked towards the direction of the voice. They didn\u2019t need to look any further.The person who spoke was Zich.\u2018What is that fucking bastard scheming again?\u2019 Trislowa thought and said, \u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cExactly what I said. That sound is nothing important.\u201d Zich looked completely different. It was difficult to imagine that he had been running away while gasping for breath a few moments ago. The wound on his side was still pouring out blood, but Zich had his back straight unlike before.And with a carefree attitude, he told the Bellid followers shocking news. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the barrier protecting the temple disappeared, so the Karuwimans are attacking the temple. That\u2019s all.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dEvery single follower was astonished. For the Bellids who were at a disadvantage to the Karuwiman in terms of both numbers and quality, the barrier had been crucial in defending their temple. But if that barrier disappeared\u2026\u201cDid you\u2026!\u201d Trislowa finally realized that Zich hadn\u2019t run to escape but to lure him and the remaining guards out of the ritual room.Then, Zich helped erase all of Trislowa\u2019s doubts. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I lured you guys out.\u201dZich moved his body from side to side; he was mocking Trislowa and the knights, showing that his wound didn\u2019t debilitate him at all. For Zich, moving with this kind of injury was nothing.\u201cYou, bastard\u2026! Did other intruders\u2026!\u201d What Trislow had prayed to not happen occurred. However, the situation was a bit different from his expectations.\u201cNo, I\u2019m the only intruder. Even in this place, there are people who are willing to take my side.\u201d\u201cWhat bullshit! No one among the Bellid followers who faithfully worship Bellu will cooperate with Karuwiman\u2019s dog like you!\u201d\u201cI also don\u2019t want to join hands with you Bellid bastards. The people who joined my side are from a completely different group.\u201dZich pointed below him with his fingers. \u201cThe people who used to be down there.\u201d\u201c\u2026The sacrifices?\u201d Trislowa hadn\u2019t even thought of the sacrifices as a possibility, so he became speechless for a moment. But soon, rage overtook him. \u201cSo\u2026our brothers\u2026died from\u2026the sacrifices\u2026out of all things?\u201dIf the Karuwimans were their mortal enemies, the sacrifices were livestock or toys at best. He couldn\u2019t believe that the high priests who maintained the barrier died from such low-class things.\u201cIt\u2019s too bad. I will send you my condolences.\u201d\u201cYooooou bastard!\u201d Trislowa was enraged countless times today. His eyes became so bloodshot that it looked like tears of blood would pour down any moment now.\u201cYour grace! We have to go to the ritual room immediately!\u201d One of the knights said to Trislwowa, but Trislowa shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s too late. If the Karuwimans have attacked the temple, it means the barrier is gone now. In other words, all the priests in the ritual room have left to join Bellu\u2019s side.\u201d\u201cKuh!\u201d The knight tried to calm his fury.\u201cFocus on the enemy in front of you. We have to take back the sacred object that guy stole. That\u2019s our top priority.\u201d\u201cWow, you are a terrible boss. Shouldn\u2019t you try to comfort the feelings of those saddened by their comrades\u2019 deaths? For what reason are you all working for a boss like that?\u201d Zich continued to annoy Trislowa.\u201cKill him.\u201d Trislowa clenched his teeth and gave his command. The knights moved with the strong conviction to not let Zich die an easy death once they caught him.\u201cCome on, I was saying that for your own good. Fine, since I\u2019m in a good mood, I will personally lead you all to the ritual room!\u201d Zich suddenly sank to his knees and touched the ground with his hands. Trislowa couldn\u2019t understand Zich\u2019s behavior and attacked. With impressive control, holy power brushed past the running knights. The knights were shocked as the attack closely passed by them, but Trislowa didn\u2019t care. Attacking Zich was much more important than caring about his shocked knights.Zich quickly took off his hand from the floor and jumped. Trislowa\u2019s holy power missed Zich and struck the ground.Bam!It didn\u2019t even make a loud sound. Trislowa\u2019s attack made a clean dent on the temple\u2019s floor.\u201cDo you think I will let you escape through the secret passageway again?!\u201d Trislowa already knew that Zich could use another secret passageway he wasn\u2019t aware of and prepared for such a scenario. Thus, as soon as Zich looked like he was trying to escape, Trislowa immediately blasted the surface that Zich was standing on top of.\u201cYou can no longer use that secret pass\u2014!\u201d Trislowa trailed off.Although Zich looked like he had jumped to escape the attack, he was using the temple\u2019s high ceiling to move behind them while kicking the walls.\u201cWhat are you guys doing!? Chase\u2014!\u201d Trislowa stopped in the middle of his command.The knights, who had been confident while cornering Zich, were now faltering. Their balance had been shaken from Trislowa\u2019s sudden attack, and it took them a moment to get into position again.Thump!Zich leisurely stepped down behind them. Then, he twirled around with one foot.Clap!And with those raised feet, he clapped his feet together.\u201cA secret passageway? There was something like that?\u201d Zich asked calmly, and Trislowa stared\u2014no, glared at the place he had attacked. In the place where he attacked, there was only a large hole and nothing that resembled a secret passageway. Trislowa had been played again.\u201cHeh, I didn\u2019t know that you knew of a passageway that even I didn\u2019t know of. As expected of Bellid\u2019s Honorary Cardinal. The information you have is on another level\u2014!\u201dPop!Zich easily evaded Trislow\u2019s angry attack.\u201cKiiiiiiill him!\u201d Trislowa\u2019s voice sounded desperate now. The knights passed Trislowa and chased after Zich again.\u201cYou want to chase me again? I\u2019m all for it. But let\u2019s decide on a destination this time.\u201d Zich turned his back and said calmly. He didn\u2019t have to act like he was cornered anymore and healed his wounds by drinking potions.\u201cI told you guys that I would take you to the ritual room, right? We should go together. Let\u2019s see what state the priests are in. I am curious too.\u201d Zich led the Bellid knights and began to run.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Regressed Demon Lord is Kind100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTo prove that his decision to go to the ritual room was not a lie, Zich retraced his steps.Bam! Bam!Trislowa, who was on a knight\u2019s back, threw attacks at Zich. Since he couldn\u2019t concentrate his power on such a shaky position, the force he let out was barely a fraction of his strength; however, as a cardinal, he was far stronger than an ordinary person.\u2018What a thrill.\u2019An energy blast barely missed Zich\u2019s back and made a hole on the wall next to him. However, Zich laughed instead.\u2018Heh! A battle should be thrilling like this.\u2019Zich evaded another close attack and moved forward. Like this, he soon arrived at the ritual room.Crash!Zich kicked the door open. Seeing his rude and careless behavior, the Bellid followers were furious again. The ritual room and the prayer room were the most important places in the temple. They followed Zich and went inside the room. But their anger at Zich for kicking the door only lasted a moment.When they went inside the room and saw the sight in front of them, all the Bellid followers froze in place. Anyone would be paralyzed by the scene in front of them.\u201c\u2026You\u2026!\u201d Trislowa shook from head to toe as he got down from the knight\u2019s back.The knight next to him quickly supported him. But the knight who supported him also couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the horror in front of him. It was a slaughterhouse. The magic circle that encircled the statue of Bellu used to be beautiful and detailed, but now, it was difficult to even see the drawings from all the blood that covered it. There was so much blood that it didn\u2019t even look like blood. It looked more like red paint that someone accidentally spilled all over the room. However, this was not the most shocking part.All the Bellid followers here held high positions, and they were known to be the world\u2019s pests. They all had experience with causing a bloodbath like the one in front of them. However, even for them, the sight of numerous priests covered in an ocean of blood was terrifying\u2014no, it was difficult to even figure out if the corpses were priests. Their clothing no longer showed any of the blue color that signified that they were Bellid followers. As if the uniform was originally red, the entire uniform was dyed bright red. The same could also be said for the shape of the uniform. The clothes were ripped so severely that they couldn\u2019t even be used as rags, and it was more accurate to say that ragged pieces of clothes hung on the bodies of dead priests.On the other hand, the priests\u2019 uniforms looked \u201clovely\u201d compared to the state of the corpses. The body was cut in many places like pieces of meat, and blood flowed out from everywhere. It was hard to even tell if they were human corpses. The entire scene in front of them clearly displayed the deep hatred of the people who killed the priests.\u201cYou\u2026! You\u2026!\u201dEven though Trislowa already predicted that all the priests in the ritual room probably died when the barrier disappeared, it was a whole new experience to witness the aftermath directly. It was a situation that looked horrifying to any person. Moreover, all the priests were high-level priests. If more time passed, one of them would have definitely become a cardinal. Even Trislowa used to perform the rituals before\u2014that was how much the priests who performed rituals were considered the top elites of Bellid. This was also one of the main reasons why they were able to create such a strong barrier against the Karuwimans.However, all of them were dead. Trislowa felt as if all his hair was standing up.Zich leaned crookedly against the Bellu statue and asked, \u201cHow is it, Mr. Great Bellid Cardinal? Do you feel anything after witnessing this sight?\u201dTrislowa glared at him. \u201c\u2026Where are the bastards who caused all this?\u201d\u201cWho knows?\u201d Zich shrugged his shoulders. Even though all the prisoners probably escaped through the secret passageway that Zich showed them, he had no reason to disclose this information.\u2018But they really did a good, clean job.\u2019Zich briefly looked over the gruesome sight in front of him. Zich was worried that the prisoners might still be hacking the priests when he came in; however, they had perfectly fulfilled the role given to them and disappeared off.\u2018No, judging by the state of the corpses, did they feel completely satisfied by their revenge?\u2019Maybe it was not Zich\u2019s advice but the full satiation of their revenge that made them move out. This was how bloody and gruesome the sight in front of them was.\u201cSpeak,\u201d Trislowa threatened Zich with a low voice. However, there was nothing more useless than a threat to Zich.\u201cAre you angry because of the scene in front of you? I understand. When I saw what you did to the little boy, I was also extremely furious. But I think you are trying to shift your responsibility to those people who you guys call sacrifices. Why don\u2019t we talk about your responsibility to the scene in front of you?\u201dZich turned his head and stared at the Bellu statue. \u201cThe great Bellu! He must have witnessed this destruction first hand. Then maybe we can ask him who is responsible for this destruction!\u201dZich hid behind the statue. Then, as if he was Bellu, he made his voice low and rough. \u201cHmph, from what I saw, I think all the responsibility falls on Trislowa. He killed and played with the life of a boy in a village for absolutely no reason. Then, a young man who was close to that boy became furious and decided to avenge him. As a result, this destruction occurred. All of this happened because of Bellid\u2019s Cardinal, Trislowa.\u201dZich slightly moved away from the Bellu statue. He smiled at seeing how Trislowa and the knights looked as if they were going to explode from the slightest touch.\u201cYou heard that? That\u2019s what Bellu said. I also agree with him on this.\u201dAnd then Zich opened his mouth again while staring at Trislowa. \u201cEverything is because of you.\u201d* * *After the barrier broke, the battle completely skewed towards Karuwiman\u2019s favor. Powerful light attacks fiercely rained down on the Bellids. The Bellid followers desperately tried to hold their ground, but Karuwiman knights\u2019 skill levels were now on completely different levels. As the light attacks continued to disrupt the Bellid forces, the Karuwimans were almost finished with making the raft bridges and stepping stones.Tap!Finally, more Karuwiman knights were able to cross the lake. Without a single moment of hesitation, they wielded their swords against the nearest Bellid in front of them.Crash! Crash!The battle between the Karuwimans and the Bellids also continued on top of the lake. However, as they were no longer able to increase their powers from the barrier, they were completely helpless against the Karuwiman knights\u2019 skillful attacks. However, the Bellids continued to resist with all their might. Their chance of succeeding was low, but they didn\u2019t plan to let their enemies have the temple without a fight.Craaaaash!But it was a waste of effort. Enormous holy power blasted like a storm across the lake and swept its surroundings. Everything in its sphere became ruined: the knights, priests, and people in armor or official uniforms.\u201cYou arrived, sir.\u201d A Holy Knight clicked his tongue at the scene before him and turned around to the instigator of this massive attack.Weig walked across the lake. \u201cThe barrier is gone. Bellu\u2019s dirty energy, which was impeding us, has also disappeared. We don\u2019t have to stand still anymore.\u201d\u201cAre you going to stop commanding the troops?\u201d\u201cThe outcome of the battle has already been decided. A commander isn\u2019t important anymore, and someone else can take command from now on.\u201d Weig casually lifted the sword he received from the Pope and tapped it on his shoulder a few times.\u201cWhat do you mean that a commander is not important? How can the commander of the Karuwiman attack force say something so irresponsible?\u201d\u201cAh, I misspoke.\u201d Weig smiled and told the holy knight, \u201cI am saying that my role as Karuwiman\u2019s greatest knight has become more important than my role as a military commander. But don\u2019t worry. Even if the situation gets a bit chaotic, I can just sweep it all away.\u201dWhat he said was incredulous, but the holy knight nodded his head and didn\u2019t refute Weig anymore. The Weig he knew was someone who could make the unbelievable into reality. Then, someone else suddenly came across the raft bridge. The holy knight turned his head thinking that another knight had come when he froze in shock.\u201c\u2026Lady Lubella, why are you\u2026\u201d\u201cI called her here.\u201dThe holy knight stared at Weig. He wanted to ask if Weig was out of his mind.\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. Even Lady Lubella has to experience a situation like this first-hand. That\u2019s how she will gain experience.\u201d\u201cYes, Weig is right. And this is what I wanted, so don\u2019t be too surprised, Sir.\u201d Lubella\u2019s smile seemed to brighten up the dark cave. The holy knight shook his head.\u2018Sir Weig seems to care for Lady Lubella like his own granddaughter, but sometimes, he pushes her mercilessly.\u2019However, that aspect might have made Lubella most like a saint.\u2018Lady Lubella\u2019s tenacity is also amazing.\u2019Who would have thought that he was one of the Karuwimans who used to criticize Lubella\u2019s weak-hearted nature? The holy knight decided to stop thinking so deeply about this matter. He thought he should just focus on swinging his sword at the Bellid bastards and kill as many as he could, so he ran towards the battlefield again.\u201cLet\u2019s go too. We have to squash out the Bellids and find Sir Zich.\u201dLubella asked with concern, \u201cWill he be fine?\u201d\u201cWe are talking about Sir Zich here. He is probably doing very well.\u201d Weig assured Lubella and shouted towards the Karuwiman forces. \u201cFollow me!\u201dAs if they were reenacting a scene of a novel, the Karuwimans roared and ran into the Bellid\u2019s camp base. Lubella also gripped her staff tightly and mixed into the heat of the battle. And like that, the fight outside of the temple ended with Karuwiman\u2019s overwhelming victory.* * *Karuwiman\u2019s holy knights flooded into the temple like a tide. The remaining Bellid\u2019s followers resisted desperately, but they were pushed back without mercy. Even the people in the ritual room could hear the sound of this chaos.\u201cDon\u2019t you guys have to run now? Karuwiman\u2019s troops will rush in. They even have the \u2018Bellid Slaughterer\u2019 Belri Weig among them.\u201d\u2018Bellid Slaughterer\u2019\u2014when Zich first heard this title, he had wondered how a holy knight could keep amassing such violent nicknames; but as he continued to repeat these names, they rolled right off his tongue.However, nobody responded to Zich. Trislowa didn\u2019t even send out orders and simply pointed at Zich. The knights rushed towards him.\u2018It seems like they don\u2019t plan to back off.\u2019Since they weren\u2019t on a path but in a wide room, Zich was surrounded instantly. Bellid knights flung their swords. Their attacks were sharpened with grudge and anger, but Zich continued to mock them.He evaded the first sword flying at him. But the next moment, another sword came in his way. Zich responded to the attack by sticking close to Bellu\u2019s statue.\u201cUrgh!\u201dContrary to the murderous intent he was giving off, Trislowa loosened the strength of his attack. He didn\u2019t want to damage Bellu\u2019s statue while attacking Zich. Zich easily flicked away the sword flying at him, and this pattern continued. The knights continued to launch attacks, but Zich hid behind Bellu\u2019s statue or stuck right beside it.\u2018These fanatics can\u2019t harm their god\u2019s statue.\u2019Moreover, this statue wasn\u2019t an ordinary one; it had been the center of the ritual that protected this temple. There were more meanings attached to it. The knights became more enraged that Zich kept hiding beneath their god\u2019s statue. Zich even had his shoulders on Bellu\u2019s statue and that sight made the knights lose their minds.Crash!Bellu\u2019s statue suddenly exploded. Zich had sensed the attack before and escaped so he wasn\u2019t injured, but the statue was broken into pieces. The knights stared at Trislowa who had attacked the statue with shocked faces.\u201cI will shoulder the sin, brothers. Only focus on killing that guy now.\u201d This was the Honorary Cardinal\u2019s sacrifice. The knights were deeply moved, and they swore to kill Zich with the same amount of conviction.Zich looked around his surroundings. The statue was gone, and he was surrounded by enemies. There was a secret passageway in this room as well, but the prisoners who killed the priests in the ritual had used that passageway, so Zich couldn\u2019t use it. The escapees could become part of the chase then.It seemed like Zich was at a dead-end, but he wasn\u2019t afraid.\u2018Should I face them seriously now?\u201d Zich decided to fight head-on for the first time since he infiltrated the Bellid temple.\u2018I have already fulfilled most of my plans. Now, it\u2019s just a fight against time.\u2019Zich was at a disadvantage now, but time was on his side. It was a matter of whether Karuwiman\u2019s forces would arrive first or Zich would die before that. Zich gripped his sword tightly and looked at the forces rushing towards him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
