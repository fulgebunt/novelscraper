    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: PrologueKim Kangchul, the PR department head for the Korean Players Association, let out a sigh.\u2018Looks like you were very unlucky this time, Mr. Kim Hyukjin.\u2019There was no other way to put it. Looking at the free government-sponsored \u2018Player aptitude test results\u2019, he let out a sigh._____________Name: Kim HyukjinTalent Plates: \u25a1\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u2026\u2026 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0Talent Type: Cannot be determined_____________Here, the \u2018\u25a1\u2019 indicated active talent plates. \u2018\u25a0\u2019 were inactive plates. Talent plates were pretty similar to growth plates for bones. Much like how growth plates determined how tall someone would become, talent plates determined one\u2019s aptitude. The more talent plates a Player had, the higher their chances were of having their talent bloom.\u2018So this was the test result five years ago.\u2019He got into his car, having decided on personally delivering the result to the involved party. This was the last gesture of goodwill he could perform.As a matter of fact, if this testee had been born in a different era, he would have definitely succeeded at becoming an amazing Player. He had an internationally unprecedented 67 talent plates, after all.\u2018If you take into account the fact that Korea\u2019s talent test can only measure up to 67 plates\u2026\u2019It was possible he had far more plates than that. To put it in words, this man was a natural genius.It was to the point that the chairman of the Players Association, Shin Hyungseok, looked at the results and groaned. \u201cAh\u2026 How did we only just find this person?\u201dIt was more of an enraged exclamation than a groan. Why did they only just now discover such a person? In all actuality, he wasn\u2019t actually discovered just now. This man with an unbelievable number of talent plates was found five years ago.\u2018He was a genius, a total genius\u2026 There\u2019s no point in talking about it now, though.\u2019Through some awful luck, this man took the test at the same time as the youngest grandson of Sungshin, Korea\u2019s greatest chaebol family. That was five years ago. The test results weren\u2019t seen by Kim Hyukjin, the test taker himself, but by the youngest member of Sungshin, Song Jinchul. Sungshin checked all test results before any agency could. It was illogical, but that was the custom.TN: A chaebol is a large industrial conglomerate in South Korea controlled by one person or one family, through family members controlling companies and subsidiaries under them. Think old money. Sungshin is a parody of the chaebol company Samsung.Back then, Song Jinchul said this:\u2014 67 talent plates? Talk about bullshit.Song Jinchul had 44 talent plates. It was quite an outstanding amount of talent, but the chaebol\u2019s youngest still felt bad.\u2014 Don\u2019t let this piece of trash do anything.At that time, Kim Kangchul inwardly lamented, \u2018This moron will once again\u2026\u2019A person with incredible aptitude that could be Korea\u2019s, no, the world\u2019s greatest Player would be left to rot. For a brief moment, he thought it was unfair. It was unfair, but nothing could be done about it.\u2018Is this supposed to make sense?\u2019He shook his head. It didn\u2019t make sense. But it did. This was Korea\u2014no, in other words, this was the Republic of Sungshin. It was a place where this kind of nonsensical thing happened every once in a while, so he decided to just accept it.\u2018You were unlucky, Mr. Kim Hyukjin. Your opponent is Song Jinchul.\u2019Song Jinchul was the youngest grandson of the Sungshin family. Kim Hyukjin was an ordinary, perhaps slightly underprivileged, citizen with nothing. From the start, their circumstances of birth were different. Because they were born in different circumstances, there was no other way to put it than \u2018you were unlucky\u2019.The results had already been determined five years ago. But recently, he was re-examined under the pretext of a reinspection. Done for free, like an act of benevolence. It definitely wasn\u2019t benevolence, but to check his talent plates.\u2018Only one talent plate is still active.\u2019Kim Hyukjin was thirty years old. In the latter half of your twenties, your talent plates rapidly close off. It was confirmed that all of his talent plates were closed off. It wouldn\u2019t be a lie to say that he was talentless.As the last act of his conscience, Kim Kangchul went to Kim Hyukjin\u2019s semi-basement room and personally handed him his results.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to be the bearer of bad news. We performed your re-examination, but it was determined that you had no talent.\u201dInwardly he thought, \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019This \u2018dead genius\u2019 happened to anger Song Jinchul. Kim Kangchul gave him a box of luxury drinks as a measure of consolation and apology. Call him a hypocrite, but this was the best he could do.\u201cI heard you were studying to take the civil servant exam. Stay strong.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAgain, he thought to himself, \u201cYou won\u2019t\u2026 ever pass the exam.\u201dBecause he angered Song Jinchul, of all people. There was no grandiose reason why he never passed the exam despite getting high marks for three years. It could all be boiled down to one phrase.\u201cYou. Were. Unlucky. Mr. Kim Hyukjin.\u201dIn many ways, including being born in Korea.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 BobProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *A semi-basement room. In the past, it was a place where my family welcomed me home, but now, no one was left. It was dark. It attracted humidity. I had become used to this.The test result I received from Kim Kangchul was short and simple.[No Talent.]I didn\u2019t really expect anything else. In the first place, I only went to get re-tested because they told me they would do it for free. I looked at the paper again.[No Talent.]I simply chuckled. If I had any talent, I would\u2019ve already awakened as a Player, gotten chosen by a \u2018Guardian\u2019, and be living an extravagant lifestyle.\u2018Let\u2019s focus on studying instead.\u2019I entertained my vain hope for only a brief moment, only a few seconds. In any case, as a 30-year-old, I was too old to start Playing. At the latest, it was the norm to start Playing in your early 20s.\u2018Yep, I have to work hard.\u2019I couldn\u2019t think of anything else I could do other than work hard. I had no talent, no connections, and no money. I had already failed the civil servant exam three times. Five years ago, my mother passed away from illness. My older sister said she would take care of me, went to work at a semiconductor factory, and developed leukemia.\u2018Work hard\u2026\u2019Somehow, the words \u2018no talent\u2019 stung a little more today than usual. Was I lacking in effort, or talent? Or maybe I was lacking in both? Was it my fault that I was living like this, or society\u2019s fault?I laid down on the bed.\u201cThe world sure is a bitch.\u201dEverything felt like my fault. Because I wasn\u2019t good at studying. Because I couldn\u2019t earn a lot of money. Because I didn\u2019t have rich parents. Because I didn\u2019t put in the effort. Because I didn\u2019t overcome the competition. Because I didn\u2019t have any talent as a Player.I looked at the one photo I had left of my mother on my desk. On her final night, she said to me:\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wanted to be your mother.\u201dThe mother in the photo was smiling, like she was telling me, the only person left in the family, that everything would be fine.\u2018Don\u2019t worry, mom. I\u2019ll live well. I\u2019m still doing alright.\u2019It was the night of April 26, 2028. The day drew to a close with an especially humid evening, without knowing that tomorrow, a completely different day would begin.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: Nameless ObserverApril 27, 2028.As usual, I headed to the study room with my book bag in hand. Even if we lived in an era where game concepts like \u2018dungeons\u2019 and \u2018fields\u2019 were the norm and people were running wild with their new careers as \u2018players\u2019, it was all a world completely detached from me.\u2018I should just study hard.\u2019Earning my keep as a civil servant was perfectly fine for an incredibly ordinary person like me. And to become a civil servant, I had to study.\u201cUgh, it\u2019s cold.\u201dIt was 5:20 in the morning. The early morning breeze from a spring not yet touched by summer was especially chilly today. As if they hadn\u2019t expected the cold, the people who had woken up at 5 am fastened their lapels as they strode towards their destination.The study room was located in Jongno, about five bus stops away. Looking at the electronic display, the 702A bus was going to arrive in two minutes.\u2018But something feels off\u2026\u2019It wasn\u2019t like I was deliberately looking at my surroundings, but something felt different from usual. If someone asked me what was wrong, I wouldn\u2019t be able to give an exact answer, but in any case, something was strangely different today.\u2018Come to think of it.\u2019The bus stop\u2019s billboard was featuring makeup being sold by \u2018Pink Velvet\u2019, an idol group that had enjoyed their heydays in the past.\u2018Did they get back together?\u2019I wouldn\u2019t know, since I hadn\u2019t been watching TV lately. Of all the idol groups, Pink Velvet was probably old enough to almost be considered ancients from the previous generation.\u2018It\u2019s been ten years, but they look exactly the same.\u2019Their faces were exactly the same as I remembered them being ten years ago. I had heard the expression that celebrities have \u2018preservative complexions\u2019 many times before, but this made me wonder if they were actually slathering preservatives all over themselves. Their faces hadn\u2019t changed even a little bit.I rummaged through my bag.\u2018Where\u2019s the study sheet\u2026 Ah, here it is.\u2019_____________Ten years ago. Jongno. The beginning of the Cataclysm._____________I read through the notepad in my hand again and again. Modern history was the most important subject in the current civil servant exam, and these notes organized the approximate timeline of the \u2018Ten Years\u2019 History\u2019.The bus arrived. Its doors opened and I climbed up the stairs.[The Tutorial began with the Primordial Fog.]This bus was going to Jongno, the same place that was at the center of the Cataclysm ten years ago.[Out of 150,000 people, around 145,000 died.]While I was focusing on my notes, I started hearing murmurs.\u201cHuh? What\u2019s with the sudden fog?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t see a thing out there.\u201dMy concentration broke when a bunch of people started making a fuss about something. I looked around, wondering what was going on.\u2018Huh?\u2019For a moment, I was struck speechless.\u2018What\u2026 is this?\u2019Was it fog?\u2018I can hardly see anything out there.\u2019It was the first time I had seen fog so thick in downtown Seoul. The Primordial Fog from ten years ago might have been this dense, maybe?\u2018The fog is too thick.\u2019I really couldn\u2019t see a single inch in front of me. Suddenly, I remembered the notes I just read._____________Ten years ago. Jongno. The beginning of the Cataclysm.The Tutorial began with the Primordial Fog._____________The bus slowed down considerably since the driver couldn\u2019t see the cars a few meters ahead. The fog was so dense a traffic accident could happen at any time.\u2018A smell\u2026?\u2019I could smell something weird. It was a bit like a sewer, or if someone let a particularly smelly one rip. It was enough to make me nauseous. I wanted to plug my nose, but endured it.\u2018A sewer smell?\u2019I looked back down at my study sheet._____________With a disgusting sewer smell\u2014_____________Beep\u2014! Beep\u2014!My phone was ringing. An emergency alert had been sent. The contents were approximately:[Seoul Jongno district. Thick fog in the area. High risk of traffic accidents.]I couldn\u2019t peel my eyes away from the study sheet._____________\u2014and the issuing of an emergency alert to the Seoul area\u2026_____________I instantly came to my senses. I looked at my surroundings again.Jongno.A rotten sewer smell.Thick fog.An emergency text.It felt like I\u2019d seen this all before. Was it from a movie? Or a novel? I was getting goosebumps on my arms. No. It wasn\u2019t from a movie or a novel. It wasn\u2019t, but this was a scene that I was definitely familiar with.\u2018No way.\u2019My body began to shiver. My thoughts were turning blank.\u2018No. It can\u2019t be.\u2019I looked back at the study sheet. At the very bottom of the notepad I was holding was information that I had organized._____________April 27, 2018. The Cataclysm began with the thick fog that had covered the Jongno/Gwanghwamun districts._____________My limbs were shaking. The other people were still saying things like \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve never seen fog like this before\u201d in fascination. But if this was the \u2018Cataclysm\u2019 I knew, it was definitely not something to be sitting around being amazed about.\u2018This\u2026 makes no sense.\u2019I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u2018Am I dreaming?\u2019There was no other option than to explain it as a dream. I had no idea why the events from the first part of the \u2018Ten Years\u2019 History\u2019 were suddenly happening right before my eyes. It was baffling. Why? How? How come? How could any of this be explained?\u2018Wh-What date\u2026 What date is it?\u2019I needed to sort things out.\u2018My phone. Right, l-let\u2019s look at my phone.\u2019I glanced at my cell phone, hastily checking the date.\u2018April 27th.\u2019I couldn\u2019t help but be flabbergasted.\u201cHeuk!\u201dI gasped unconsciously.\u20182018?\u2019I definitely left my house when it was 2028, and was on my way to Jongno in 2028. I definitely rode the bus. But the date on my cellphone was definitely saying that it was \u20182018\u2019. Since when did it start saying that? I had no idea. At some point, the phone in my hand changed to the \u2018S8\u2019 phone model that I was using back in 2018. But it wasn\u2019t the time to be thinking about why this was the case.\u2018I\u2019m going to go insane.\u2019It wasn\u2019t enough to just say that I was going to go insane. I was having one of those so-called mental breakdowns.\u2018I\u2019m really ten years in the past?\u2019It seemed like the me of ten years ago went onto the Jongno-route bus of ten years ago. I didn\u2019t, no,\u00a0couldn\u2019t, know why, but that was the conclusion I came to. It was absurd, but that was the conclusion I reached.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 BobProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *\u2018This is insane\u2026!\u2019My heart was pounding like crazy. Something unbelievable had happened. I was really going to lose it. I left the house like usual, and walked to the study room like usual. So how could I suddenly be ten years in the past? What kind of crazy situation was this? Faced with such an incomprehensible phenomenon, my head was pounding and throbbing.\u2018If I really went back in time to 2018\u2026\u2019If by some chance, I was going to Jongno on April 27\u2026\u2018Shit\u2026!\u2019If I wasn\u2019t careful, I could die. April 27, 2018: That was the day that marked the beginning of the Cataclysm. 150,000 people died during the first week, the period called the \u2018Open Beta\u2019 or the \u2018Tutorial\u2019. Only 5,000 survived. The survival rate was absolutely brutal.\u2018Proportionally, that\u2019s only 3 percent.\u201997 percent died and 3 percent survived\u2014that was the Jongno of 2018. I decided to try and calm down for now.\u2018If I don\u2019t get it together, I\u2019ll die.\u2019I couldn\u2019t die so pathetically. I decided I would think about why all of this had happened to me later. Because if this was the Jongno of 2018, there was a 97 percent chance I would die.When I reached that point in my thoughts, an alert appeared.[The Tutorial will soon begin.][Players, please prepare at your current position.]This was pretty much a confirmation.\u2018Even the alert happened.\u2019Whatever the reason may be, I had to acknowledge that I had returned to the past. Sitting on the bus seat, I organized my thoughts. My limbs were shaking, but I tried to stay as composed as possible. I knew the future. In fact, I knew it very well, because I had been memorizing the events of the past ten years for the past three years.\u2018You have to calm down. Calm down, Kim Hyukjin.\u2019Biting my lips hard, I closed my eyes for just a moment. I had to brace myself.As soon as the fog cleared, I would be seeing hell. I would see pools of blood and people being eaten alive by goblins. Many people might have already died. To be honest, I was scared and afraid.\u2018Right. Even so, I have an advantage. I have to believe that. Shit. Shit. Shit.\u2019I have a huge advantage. I can do it. I can do it. I can survive.\u00a0I braced myself by repeating this several times.\u2018For now\u2026 let\u2019s focus on surviving.\u2019I can do it. I can survive.\u00a0If I really did return to the past, I could save my mother who we couldn\u2019t afford treatment for, and my sister wouldn\u2019t have to quit school to work at a factory to pay for my education.My sister, who developed leukemia while working at a semiconductor factory to try and take care of me\u2026 This time, I had the chance to be the one helping her.\u2018I just have to do it.\u2019Although I only ever experienced dungeons in VR, I had read Tutorial strategy guides a thousand times over, and watched Youtube videos on the subject ten thousand times over. There were countless dungeons that emulated the Jongno of ten years ago, and strategy guides showing the contents of those dungeons were widespread all over the market.I was one of the people memorizing all of that information by rote.\u2018I will definitely survive.\u2019I had to check to be sure, but if I had actually gone into the past, my mother would still be alive, and my sister wouldn\u2019t be working at the semiconductor factory yet. At the very least, I could undo a large number of things that had gone wrong in my life. It could be that this was an opportunity.\u2018I have to live.\u2019Still sitting, I took a deep breath. I closed my eyes and organized my thoughts on the current situation.What did I have to do to live through this? What did I have to do from here on out?My limbs were shaking, but I made an effort to keep as calm as possible.\u2018I can do this.\u2019My will to survive was stronger than the shock I was feeling at the occurrence of this improbable situation.\u2018The Primordial Fog. And the 1st wave of goblin attacks.\u2019How should I get through the goblin attack? My talent diagnosis showed me that it was close to \u2018zero\u2019. What could someone with as little talent to be a Player as I do to survive?\u2018There were definitely people without talent who lived through this before.\u2019How did they survive? The survival rate was 3 percent. I had to be in that 3 percent. I took another deep breath and sketched out an approximate plan of what I had to do in my head.\u2018The Tutorial. Since I\u2019m inside the bus right now, a conditional safe zone will probably be announced.\u2019I laid out the actions I was going to take, piece by piece. I was surprised at how good my concentration was. It seemed that my desire to live was stronger than I thought. I was a lot more composed and quick to adapt than I thought I could be.So composed that it was almost unbelievable that I was someone who had an evaluation of [No Talent].Suddenly, another message appeared. In a very short amount of time, I had planned many things in my mind, detailing ways I could raise my survival rate by even a small amount, but I never considered the following message.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is carefully watching your actions.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 has begun to take an interest in you.]My thoughts ground to a halt for a split second.\u2018The Nameless Observer\u2026?\u2019A Guardian had started taking interest in me.\u2018But I heard that Guardians put an utmost importance on talent.\u2019They even had nicknames like \u2018talent leeches\u2019. Didn\u2019t Guardians hunt for talented Players early on so that they could invest in them? They were known for treating talentless people as less than human. So why were they interested in me?That wasn\u2019t the end of the incomprehensible messages.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: Nameless Observer (2)Ten years ago, the \u2018System\u2019 spread across the world, starting from Korea. This phenomenon breathed new life into our civilization and gave birth to countless celebrities, like the Tutorial Ender \u2018Fist King\u2019 So Yoohyun and the \u2018Flame Lord\u2019 Choi Sung-gu.Behind every famous Player was a \u2018Guardian\u2019. Not much was known about \u2018Guardians\u2019, just that they supported Players or requested something from them. Some Guardians made their Players strong, while others led their players to ruin. Guardians were regarded as beings who \u2018observed\u2019 our Playing.\u2018I\u2019ve never heard of the \u2018Nameless Observer.\u2019I didn\u2019t know a thing about the Nameless Observer. It seemed he was a Guardian who revealed himself at the beginning of the Playing. Considering that he wasn\u2019t famous, the \u2018nameless\u2019 moniker suited him well.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 wishes to bestow upon you an \u2018Open Beta Bonus\u2019.][You have received an \u2018Open Beta Bonus\u2019.]\u2018Suddenly?\u2019I didn\u2019t even do anything, but I was given a bonus. Usually, you had to do something to a Guardian\u2019s liking in order to receive such a thing.\u2018Whatever. For now, it must be a good thing.\u2019It was known that the world\u2019s countless rankers received the \u2018Open Beta Bonus\u2019. You could call it a sort of extra boon for the advance party that began first.\u2018A 3 percent chance. This is a gift for surviving those odds.\u2019It was easier to think about it that way. Regardless of the reasoning as to why this Guardian was eyeing a talentless Player like myself, there was no downside to it.[Due to the Open Beta Advantage, you have received \u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019.][\u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 has taken effect.]My wildly thumping heart began to settle down.\u2018Huh\u2026?\u2019My chest felt as hot as ever, but it felt like my head was cooling down, and much of my fear was subsiding.\u2018What a strange feeling.\u2019It felt like I was standing at the eye of a fierce battlefield.\u2018This is the power of the system.\u2019I was scared, but also excited. Everything around me felt muted. Even though my surroundings were ringing with cries like \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019, it felt like those noises were getting naturally filtered away.\u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye, huh.\u2019That was a befitting title. It almost felt like I was watching over the situation with a third-person view.[The Tutorial is beginning.][Conditional Safe Zones will be announced.]\u2018It\u2019s really starting.\u2019In the end, I heard a notice that the \u2018Tutorial\u2019 was starting.[In ten seconds, the Tutorial Quest will begin.][10][9]The bus was stuck in place, perhaps because an accident had occurred.\u201cTo all passengers, I apologize. There is no way I can drive in this situation. I will open the door, so if anyone is willing to walk, please do so.\u201dThis level of fog could be regarded as a natural disaster. The cars were completely unable to budge.\u201cShit! What a way to start the day!\u201dTwo men wearing aviator-style glasses walked towards the exit. It seemed they hadn\u2019t received the \u2018Tutorial Notice\u2019, which meant they hadn\u2019t been selected as Players.[6][5]The timer counted down. I couldn\u2019t just do nothing. I knew all too well what was about to happen. I jumped up and yelled at the two men.\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201dAnd then, I shouted at the bus driver, \u201cClose the door right now!\u201d\u201cW-What?\u201d\u201cClose it right now!\u201dStartled by the strength of my demand, the driver reflexively closed the door. Although I felt a little sorry for the driver, ten seconds was not enough time to explain everything. I then directed a loud voice to the eight or so people on the bus.\u201cDon\u2019t speak, don\u2019t move, don\u2019t even keep your eyes open. Just remain still.\u201dI spoke quickly, unsure if my words would have any effect. To them, I probably looked like a psycho, but I decided to give it my best.\u201cFrom now on, something unbelievable will happen. Everyone here could die. So please do your best to survive. First of all, staying still is your ticket to survival.\u201dThat was the best I could do. There was no more time. I couldn\u2019t risk causing a panic. I had done everything I could.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 looks at you with interest.]The clock ticked on.[2][1]The events I had only seen in history books and textbooks unfolded before my eyes.[The Tutorial Quest is beginning.][ The \u2018Intermediate Administrator\u2019 is appearing.]The space near the driver\u2019s seat in the bus began to distort, and something took form from within.\u2018The Intermediate Administrator.\u2019That was their official name, but the name most commonly used to describe them was \u2018Streamer\u2019, beings that acted as intermediaries between the \u2018Guardians\u2019 observing us and the \u2018Players\u2019.The crowd\u2019s first reaction was to be unsettled by the human-like shape coming from the distortion, and their second was to be astonished by that being\u2019s incredible beauty.\u2018Because most female Streamers are beautiful.\u2019The Streamer who appeared before us could be said to be so beautiful that she could contend for the top position among other Streamers. With her unnaturally silky silver hair and porcelain white skin, she transcended beauty into pure nobility, and the pair of white wings behind her back almost made her look like a real angel.\u2018She really is extremely beautiful.\u2019I wasn\u2019t that drawn in. However, one guy on the bus was unable to take his eyes off her, his expression screaming that he had never seen such a beautiful woman in his life.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dI saw him swallow his drool.\u2018There\u2019s more to them than their beautiful appearance.\u2019I didn\u2019t know about this Streamer, but Streamers never stayed friendly to Players forever. They were obsessed with how they could connect Players and Guardians and how they could earn more \u2018COIN\u2019. Not all of them were that way, but most of them were.The woman began to speak.\u201cMy name is Senia. Everyone here will be participating in the Tutorial Quest.\u201d[Survive the Tutorial Field for seven days.][You cannot leave the Tutorial Field.][Subsequent difficulty will be determined by the number of survivors.]Senia. A Streamer of such beauty should be memorable, but I had no recollection of her. I guessed she was one of the Streamers from very, very early on in the Tutorial. After all, I knew the famous Streamers in the future.\u201cW-What? Do you know what\u2019s going on? Could it be that you\u2019re filming a movie here?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia stared at the man who initiated a conversation with her, her expression utterly unchanged.\u201cAll you must do is use your abilities to the utmost to survive.\u201d\u201cAnd what\u2019s that supposed to mean?!\u201dIt would be best if he behaved himself. Our level was a pathetic 1, definitely not a position where one could be careless with a Streamer. Thankfully, this Streamer didn\u2019t seem violent. If he\u2019d been unlucky, that man would have been a corpse by now.Entries like [An Intermediate Administrator who introduced themselves as \u2018Leitra\u2019 cut anyone who asked them a question in half, saying \u2018I don\u2019t recall permitting questions?\u2019] showed up frequently in people\u2019s narratives later. Personally, I wasn\u2019t very interested in Streamers, despite their otherworldly appearance. I didn\u2019t trust Streamers on a fundamental level, and that was because most of them only thought of us as their method of income.\u2018Most of all\u2026\u2019I wanted to live. I peered through the window, finding everything still blanketed by thick fog.\u2018The Primordial Fog.\u2019This fog muffled sounds. According to the \u2018Fist King\u2019 So Yoohyun, the Tutorial Ender and later someone who became world-famous as a ranker, the fog inhibited sounds and simultaneously made you lose your sense of direction.\u2018A trap that commonly appears in many other dungeons.\u2019Before the great explorer \u2018Jackson\u2019 identified a method of dispelling this fog, the \u2018Primordial Fog\u2019 was one of the most annoying traps.\u2018Such thing appeared in a tutorial\u2026\u2019It was different from what we typically associated as a tutorial. The purpose of a tutorial was to help adjust a new player to a game. In essence, it was there to help. However, the real-life Tutorial was different.Ten years later, people believed that the true essence of the \u2018Tutorial\u2019 was this:\u2018An opening act shown to the Guardians.\u2019This place, Jongno\u2019s Tutorial Field, was the opening act shown to the higher beings reducing mankind to players inside a game so they could watch \u2018from above\u2019, the \u2018Guardians\u2019 that absolutely needed to be struck down one day.Suddenly, a man next to me screamed. He must have seen something outside the window. \u201cH-H-Holy shit!\u201dMy eyes opened, and I bit my lips.\u2018It has begun.\u2019I could easily figure out why the man screamed. The windshield at the front of the bus was painted with a few lines of fresh red streaks. That was blood. Something covered in blood had crashed onto the windshield before falling to the ground.\u201cH-Heok\u2026!\u201d\u201cW-What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cW-What was that just now? That\u2019s blood, isn\u2019t it?!\u201dIn the meantime, Streamer Senia had disappeared. It seemed she was hustling from place to place around the Tutorial Field, striving to draw the attention of the Guardians.I also hadn\u2019t seen what hit the windshield. It could\u2019ve been a severed arm or leg, or even a head.\u2018Even after I told them to remain still.\u2019But I understood that it was easier said than done. Who in their right mind would be able to stay calm if someone\u2019s cut-up corpse flew over and struck the windshield of the bus they were in? They might have heard my warning to \u2018stay still\u2019, but how could they possibly adhere to that?\u2018Stay calm.\u2019[\u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 is taking effect.]The notification appeared as my heart became a little calmer. Due to the Open Beta Bonus, I was able to keep my cool. I continued to sketch out the situation in my head.\u2018The enemies that are coming now are goblins.\u2019The first monster to appear was the \u2018goblin\u2019, a small green humanoid monster. They were only 80-100 cm in size, but they were far stronger than an average male adult and more agile. Their distinctive features were their pointy ears and long tongues.\u2018Monsters with sickening hobbies.\u2019They had a sickening taste for dismembering humans. They were probably enjoying that hobby to their utmost outside, slaughtering the weak humans coming face to face with monsters for the first time.[A great deal of noise and movement has been detected.][The Goblin Legion is starting to get excited.][The 1st wave of goblin attacks is beginning.][The Goblin Legion has begun to invade Jongno.]Thump! Thump! Thump!I could hear them.It was very faint, but my ears were even able to pick up a peculiar kind of laughter that went kikik, kikikik, kikik! I was very familiar with that sound\u2014I had heard it often on Youtube.\u2018Goblin sounds.\u2019The thumping noises were probably from them clambering onto cars and stomping on them.Another notification popped up.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is observing your actions with interest.]Following the start of the Tutorial, even more information flooded into my head. Things like how to use the \u2018Status Window\u2019 to check my stats and how to open my inventory slotted into place in my head like they belonged there.I opened up my Status Window as naturally as a person who had been Playing for a long time. Strangely enough, everything was too easy, like I was someone who already knew how to do this.\u2018Status Window.\u2019All I could do as of now was to find out exactly about myself. I had to use this precious time wisely.I opened up my Status Window. There, something unbelievable was on display.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: The Lion King\u2019s ProposalI closed my eyes, concentrating on the hologram window that only I could see. Even with my eyes closed, I could clearly see the window. I looked at it again with my full attention, but the Status Window was as unbelievable as ever.[Status Window]Name: Kim Hyukjin (Player)Level: 1Title: \u2013Strength: 10Intelligence: 12Agility: 11Perception: 11Constitution: 10Willpower: 13 (+30)\u2018These are my stats?\u2019 They were higher than expected. \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019No, they were way too high.\u2018Why\u2019re they so high?\u2019Those numbers didn\u2019t make any sense.\u2018Fist King So Yoohyun\u2019s stats at the time of the tutorial were somewhere around an average of 9.\u2019The strongest Player in the world\u2019s starting stats were around 9, but my stats were obviously around 11. So what did that mean? Even the lowest stats, Strength and Constitution, were set at a whopping 10, higher than the average of the Tutorial Ender, the Fist King.\u2018And my Willpower is 43\u2026?\u2019Considering that \u2018(+30)\u2019 was tagged on, I guessed that this was the temporarily increased value from \u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019. It wasn\u2019t the sort of value a level 1 Player should have, something you should never even have the chance to see during the Tutorial. Even without the \u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 buff, a starting Willpower stat of 13 was incredibly high.\u2018My Intelligence was this high?\u2019The higher your starting stats, the more advantageous it was in the System. In essence, that was the domain of Intelligence. Level ups were the domain of manual labor and effort, but the growth that came with each level up was the domain of Intelligence and Perception.\u2018I really don\u2019t get it.\u2019It was just yesterday that I received a \u2018No Talent\u2019 evaluation.[No Talent.]It was clearly written on the paper.\u2018Did something change when I returned to the past?\u2019I didn\u2019t know. It was still hard to say. For now, I knew that my starting stats were higher than the Fist King\u2019s, which meant my chances of surviving had dramatically increased.\u2018Taking into consideration the fact that each point of starting stats makes a big difference\u2026 I\u2019m in a really advantageous position.\u2019Just then\u2014Thump! Thump!The inside of the bus began to shake. I didn\u2019t open my eyes.\u2018They\u2019ve got clubs.\u2019The bus was a conditional Safe Zone. As long as we didn\u2019t excite the goblins, it would be safe. For now.I heard the voices of the men.\u201cH-Holy shit\u2026!\u201d\u201cThe hell is that?\u201dHow many of the eight people here could survive? I cracked open my eyes, taking a very small, very faint look.\u2018One person?\u2019 Or maybe two? \u2018It could even\u2026 be none.\u2019Through the windows of the bus, I could see green monsters jumping outside. The goblins were only about one meter tall, but they could leap over two meters in the air. They battered the windows with their clubs, and the glass began to crack.\u2018Stay calm.\u2019Maybe thanks to \u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019, I was able to examine the situation far more calmly than expected.Crack!The window finally shattered. Soon, the goblins would stream in. I quietly glanced at my watch.\u2018The bus earned us five minutes.\u2019This time was the reason I didn\u2019t let the bus driver open the door. Just five minutes. I thought it would be good if I had just five minutes more.\u201cF-F-Fuck off, you monsters!\u201d\u201cUwahhh!\u201dI closed my eyes again.\u2018I guess staying still isn\u2019t something you can do by just being told.\u2019It was simple if you imagined that a one-meter cockroach was walking around in front of you. The goblin right there was far bigger than one meter and was even armed, and it was a creature that relished killing. Anyone who\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0freak out just because they were told to stay still was out of the norm. I squeezed my eyes shut and bit my lips.\u2018It would be better not to look.\u2019My starting stats might be high, but I wasn\u2019t strong enough to face a goblin swarm. I could picture the situation without seeing it. The guys had probably already perished to the crude hands of the goblins. It was possible they had been ripped to pieces. A disgusting smell wafted over me. It was the goblins\u2019 body odor.I heard footsteps, and the voices of the monsters.Kikik! Kikikikik! Kikikik!I also heard the screams of the woman in the rearmost seat, an ear-splitting cry.\u201cH-Help! Help! Kyaaak!\u201dSomething splattered onto me. Something hot ran down my cheek. I had the feeling that the liquid was red.\u2018This is\u2026 blood.\u2019It seemed one of the goblins even had a sword, evidenced by the sharp sound of flesh being sliced. That bloody, wet sound was so revolting I never wanted to hear it again.Even with the assistance of Calm Observer\u2019s Eye, it was so terrible that I struggled to hold on.My limbs were trembling, but I stayed as calm as possible. If I crumbled or panicked here, I would die just like the others. I recalled the picture of my mom, the one who had consoled me yesterday.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll live well. I\u2019ll do my best.\u00a0That\u2019s what I resolved to do last night.\u2018I want to live.\u2019Kiik?The sound came from right next to my ear.The goblins came close to me, the sole survivor. Something cold touched my shoulder.\u2018Might be a palm\u2026\u2019It felt like one, a small palm. The palm of a green-skinned monster touched my shoulder. Fascinated by me, the creature pressed its nose on my cheek and sniffed. The rank breath of the goblin clambering on my body was truly disgusting. I supposed my nausea.\u2018Dammit.\u2019Not a single scream could be heard. Everyone here had probably died. I didn\u2019t have the strength to protect them, and they didn\u2019t have the strength to protect themselves.\u2018This is terrible.\u2019They began to grope my body. One of them licked my shin with its long tongue. I could feel my pants eroding a little because of its acidic saliva. Some even poked my cheeks with claws that must be incredibly dirty, as if playing with a toy.\u2018I only need to hold out for five more minutes.\u2019A total of ten minutes. I needed to hold out without making a sound for just ten minutes. After that, I would be in the clear for a moment. That was a fact well-documented in Fist King So Yoohyun\u2019s memoir and a strategy I had seen many times on Youtube.Each and every second felt so very long. The goblins using me as a jungle gym felt like giant cockroaches crawling on my body.After what felt like an eternity, I heard another notice.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 has begun to take an interest in you.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 wishes to give you a chance.]Yet another Guardian had become interested in me, which now made a whopping two Guardians. One was the \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019, and the other was the \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019. The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 was also a Guardian I already knew.[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 wishes to bestow you an Open Beta Advantage.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 has gifted you \u2018High Strength Elixir\u2019.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 looks forward to your \u2018courage\u2019.]I wasn\u2019t happy about it.\u2018The Courageous Lion King.\u2019The notoriety of this Guardian was particularly high, even among the many Guardians. The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 was very famous as a Guardian that imposed reckless courage, challenge-seeking, and useless zeal on Players, whether that meant Players died or not. He was a wicked Guardian who cared not a whit for the pain of a Player in a dangerous situation.The only thing that mattered to him was that Players had \u2018courage\u2019 and \u2018challenged\u2019 hardship head-on. It didn\u2019t matter to him if that challenge resulted in death\u2014He was a perverted bastard who simply enjoyed the process.\u2018If I were to act courageously here\u2026\u2019I would be eaten alive by the goblin swarm surrounding me. In order to survive, I had to clearly differentiate when to be brave and when not to be, and right now, it was the latter.\u2018You dirty goblin bastards.\u2019I upped my concentration. While these goblins were crawling over my body, running their dirty tongues over me and prodding me all over with their dirty fingers, I had to focus on something else, or I would go insane.\u2018Focus.\u2019Kikik! Kikik! Kiiik?One of the goblins licked my ear. At that moment, my focus cracked. I felt every hair on my body stand on end. My ear stung immensely from the acid in their saliva. It felt like my ear was melting.\u2018Argh\u2026!\u2019[The gifted \u2018High Strength Elixir\u2019 has arrived.][For the duration of the Tutorial, gifted items will be automatically sent to your Inventory.][Would you like to access your Inventory?]I bit down hard on my lower lip in order to keep myself from making a sound. Any movement or sound would be fatal right now. The moment I moved or made a sound, the conditional Safe Zone would shatter, and I would meet the same fate as the eight other people on this bus.I knew exactly how to access my Inventory.\u2018Inventory.\u2019You just had to think it in your head. My eyes were closed, but the Inventory hologram was clearly displayed before me. It wasn\u2019t something you saw with the physical eye, but a perception fed to the brain to make it appear as if you were looking at it with your eyes.[High Strength Elixir]The Courageous Lion King\u2019s gift. An Open Beta Bonus, it will take effect for ten minutes.Temporarily increases Strength by 6.\u2018Plus 6?\u2019You gained 2 bonus stats with each level up. I heard you could gain more bonus stats by satisfying special conditions, but in any case, the base number you got was two.\u2018If I use this\u2026\u2019 I made the mental calculation. \u2018It\u2019d be like leveling up three times.\u2019My current level was 1. If my Strength was increased by 6, it would be like me being level 4 after only raising my Strength stat with every level.\u2018My starting stats are way higher than normal Players.\u2019Players of the highest level averaged around 9 for starting stats, and I had an even higher average. With that in mind, while I was under the effect of this potion, I figured I would be something like a level 5 or 6 Player.\u2018Goblins can normally be hunted at around level 6.\u2019The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 most likely gifted me the \u2018High Strength Elixir\u2019 after taking this into consideration. It might have been that he wanted to see the flailing of a pathetic level 1 Player, a struggle that lasted ten minutes.\u2018You perverted bastard.\u2019I really didn\u2019t like the Courageous Lion King. However, there was another item in my Inventory, one of the items distributed to all Players at random, aka a starter item.[Rusted Iron Sword]An iron sword covered in rust. You shouldn\u2019t expect much killing power from it.Attack Power: 2~5It was an extremely shabby item, but it was still much better than nothing. If I used the High Strength Elixir and the Rusted Iron Sword, I might be able to hunt goblins. But as I had repeatedly emphasized, this wasn\u2019t the time to fight. I could not hunt the goblin swarms on my own.\u2018If I wait a little longer, the goblin\u2019s attack will stop for a moment.\u2019I didn\u2019t know exactly how long, but it was probably something like two or three minutes longer. Afterwards, the goblins would disappear. If the Fist King So Yoohyun\u2019s records were correct, at least.As if to prod me onwards, I heard another notice.[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 looks forward to your courage.]I did my best to ignore the notice. It was true that catching the eye of a Guardian was a favorable thing for a Player. But you couldn\u2019t survive if you always acted according to the desires of a Guardian. That much was an established fact. Taking what should be taken and refusing what should be refused was the right call. When I stayed motionless, my eyes still closed, another notice rang in my ear.[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 requests a trade with an Intermediate Administrator.]That was the moment where things began to derail. That moment.Various thoughts whirled in my head. The disposition of the Courage Lion King. The nature of the Tutorial Field. The potential trades a Guardian could request from an Intermediate Administrator. Like a puzzle coming together, all the pieces connected one by one in the head of me, Kim Hyukjin.\u2018Piecing everything together\u2026\u2019I knew what kind of picture the Courageous Lion King wanted to see.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: The Lion King\u2019s Proposal (2)The space distorted, and a female Streamer, Senia, appeared from within. She was a terribly beautiful Streamer, but she didn\u2019t look beautiful at all to me.\u201cThe Tutorial Field will be altered according to the suggestion of the Courageous Lion King.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThese kinds of events happened sometimes. A Guardian could use their special authority to make slight alterations. I knew what the Lion King would propose.\u2018I hoped this wouldn\u2019t happen.\u2019 I bit my lip a little. \u2018He will definitely try to induce me to fight.\u2019I was sure of it.\u2018The best method at his disposal is to destroy the conditional Safe Zone.\u2019Guardians were limited in how they could engage with Players. They could do things like support a Player or sponsor them with COIN, but there were many restrictions on direct interference with Playing. But this was still within their limits. They could still ask an Intermediate Administrator to destroy a conditional Safe Zone.\u201cThe trade has been concluded. According to the request of the Courageous Lion King, the conditional Safe Zone will be abolished in thirty seconds.\u201dShe unblinkingly spoke such words with complete indifference, despite knowing all too well that I could not handle a goblin swarm with my current strength.\u2018I know you\u2019re aware of that fact and more. I know about this world very well.\u2019It was possible that I knew more about the world than Senia. The Kim Hyukjin who became a Playing nerd over the three years of test prep was not to be underestimated.I said, \u201cIf a Guardian forcefully alters the scenario, shouldn\u2019t there be a corresponding reward for the Player?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia simply stared at me with her emotionless face. I couldn\u2019t read her expression, but it looked like she was saying that the complaints of a level 1 insect mattered not a whit to her. She also wasn\u2019t very ruffled by my talking down on her.\u201cThe Laws cannot be ignored, especially if it is related to my life or death. You cannot ignore the Commandments.\u201dI heard a notice.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 expresses their surprise.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 is silent.]\u201cDid you just say Commandments?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Commandments.\u201dIn this System, there were rules, aka Commandments, that pervaded the entirety of the System.\u201cHow do you know about the Commandments?\u201d\u201cIs that important?\u201dHow could that be important when I was at the fork between life and death?\u201cI\u2019m sure you know that a Player doesn\u2019t have to concretely explain their Playing methods, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia didn\u2019t say anything. Streamers were generally talkative, but this one seemed a little different.\u2018The reason why such a beautiful person didn\u2019t become well-known\u2026 must be linked to that frustratingly tight-lipped nature.\u2019I glanced at the time. Ten seconds had already passed.\u201cI\u2019ve lost out on Safe Zone time talking to you, the Intermediate Administrator. My reward?\u201d\u201cIn accordance with the Commandments, I will increase the Safe Zone time. The Safe Zone will remain in effect for ten seconds after your conversation with me ends.\u201dThat was excellent. That was exactly what I wanted. The 1st wave of goblin attacks would end very soon. I only had to hold out for a little longer. The Courageous Lion King tried to start some nonsense, but it didn\u2019t matter\u2014the time was passing all the same.I spoke again, \u201cThis is a scenario alteration linked to my life or death. I think an appropriate reward is in order. Am I wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLet me ask again. Am I wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI guessed she was rather flustered. A level 1 piece of trash was speaking to a Streamer with such impoliteness, yet there was no justification for punishment. That was because my argument was related to the \u2018Laws\u2019, or \u2018Commandments\u2019 that were only discovered seven years in the future.\u2018She might be happy right now.\u2019My actions right now were definitely eye-catching and likely to draw the interest of many Guardians, so it could very well be that this Streamer was inwardly delighted by my actions.\u201c\u2026\u201d After a short moment, she said, \u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin. Your words are correct.\u201dAs she said that, an item was sent into my Inventory.[Quality Lubricant]Good quality lubrication oil. It can sharpen the blade of an item with an edge, or be applied on a part that requires lubrication. It is characterized by its tremendous slickness.\u2018The scenario alteration reward is only this?\u2019My face twisted into a slight frown. It seemed a bit weak for a reward. Still, a reward was a reward, and I had dragged out the time for as long as possible while talking to the Streamer, the Intermediate Administrator. That was a very valid way to think about it.\u2018Lion King. You idiot.\u2019The Lion King actually ended up helping me. Thanks to him, I was able to drag out plenty of time, and do it safely. I\u2019m sure nobody expected a level 1 Player to bring up the \u2018Commandments\u2019 in a little trick to drag out the time. Of course, that applied to me as well. Such a method only occurred to me on the fly.[The 1st wave of goblin attacks is over.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 is deeply disappointed.]I secretly breathed a sigh of relief.\u2018I survived the 1st wave.\u2019I couldn\u2019t be sure, but the damned Courageous Lion King was probably scratching his ass like a dog with hemorrhoids. Why? Because the goblins were going to disappear now from this field.Kikik? Kikik! Kiiik!The goblins began to move. They had come like the rising tide, and now, they were disappearing like receding waters.\u2018This is my chance.\u2019I jumped to my feet. The Streamer Senia leveled her gaze on my every movement, neither helping nor interfering. Seeing as she hadn\u2019t yet disappeared, it seemed she had a certain degree of interest in me.I headed for the bus exit.\u2018Urgh\u2026\u2019A gruesome hell was laid out before me. There was hardly an intact body to be found. Up until a few moments ago, it was the inside of an all-too-ordinary bus commonly seen on the morning commute, but now,\u00a0seven\u00a0corpses were scattered about, some ripped to pieces and some missing parts.\u2018Eughh.\u2019Bile rose in my throat. It was terrible. I didn\u2019t want to look anymore. It felt like the splayed out man, whose arm was caught on the seat, was staring at me with his open, glassy eyes, like he would rise in the next moment and chase me.\u2018Come to your senses.\u2019I had to keep it together. This was the Tutorial Field, a place with an official survival rate of just 3 percent.\u2018I have to hold out for one week.\u2019One week\u2014that was how long I had to endure. I had ridden this bus day after day for three years and frequently went through this area. At the very least, I knew exactly where the streetside convenience stores were.\u2018The fog\u2019s grown thicker.\u2019After pushing open the bus door, I descended. The disgusting sewer smell together with the intense reek of blood crashed into me. I was actually glad the fog was there. If I had seen this place in the bright light of day with a clear line of sight, I might have gone insane.\u2018First of all, I need water and food.\u2019It was nearly impossible to survive without drinking for seven days. The convenience store was my first destination.I had a total of ten minutes.\u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019Oddly enough, I moved as naturally as a person who had Played before, like someone who had done this many times.Even up until that point, I hadn\u2019t really realized how high my Intelligence was.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *My surroundings looked very hazy. I saw cars amidst the metallic bloody stench, and bodies made into a mess of bright red blood were scattered along the pathway. From the midst of that devastation came the voices of survivors. Inside the fog, eyesight and hearing were greatly inhibited.\u2018Considering we\u2019re in the fog\u2026 quite a few people survived the 1st wave of goblin attacks.\u2019I started running towards the convenience store. They said your sense of direction would pretty much disappear in this fog, and that seemed about right. I glanced back at the blue bus; After just a few steps, it was barely visible. I ran with the bus at my back.\u2018This is the right way.\u2019If I went this way, there would be a convenience store not far from here. I ran forward, relying on my senses. A distance that had to be less than 300 meters felt so inexplicably long. I found out for the first time that I valued \u2018life\u2019 so fiercely.But as I ran, my foot hit something, most likely a person.\u2018Is it another body?\u2019But no, it wasn\u2019t a body. Under my foot\u2026 lay a person who was not yet a corpse.A sobbing voice sounded in my ears. \u201cH-Help me. Please. Please save me.\u201dIt was a young girl in her early teens. Paralyzed with fear, the child was laying on the ground covering her head, trembling. She raised her head and stared at me with the gaze of a child looking at an adult, a gaze yearning for help.I suddenly heard the sound of something being sliced. At that moment, I could only flinch in alarm.\u2018There\u2019s a goblin here?\u2019I hadn\u2019t seen it because of the fog, but there was still a goblin here.\u2018Even though the 1st wave of the goblin attacks is over?\u2019According to countless records and VR dungeon simulations, the goblins should be completely gone. That was the established theory, and none of the many guides described anything like this. In other words, this goblin was a \u2018variable\u2019.Kikik. Kikikik!It was about fifty centimetres tall.\u2018It\u2019s not an adult?\u2019It wasn\u2019t an adult goblin, but a young one. Even so, it apparently knew a measure of the disgusting goblin tastes, because it was hard at work slicing the girl\u2019s ankles with the dagger in its hand.\u00a0Slice, slice\u2014came the gruesome sound. Faced with such a situation, I struggled to make a choice.\u2018Do I run?\u2019To run, or not to run? To run, or not to run?\u2018I do think I can defeat a baby goblin, at least.\u2019It varied per person, but the universal recommended level for hunting a goblin was around 5. The one in front of me wasn\u2019t a real goblin, but a baby one. For me, with the starting stats of a top-level Player, a baby goblin should be manageable, at least if I were given a little time.I heard the sobbing voice again.\u201cHeuk heuk. Please, help me, help me. Please, please, save me. I wanna see my mommy.\u201dI bit my lips. It was possible I might lose my sense of direction completely if I stopped to help this girl. That meant I could be exposed to the 2nd wave with no defenses.\u201cP-Please. Save me.\u201dWhile I was in the middle of struggling to decide what to do, I suddenly realized one strange point.\u2018Come to think of it\u2026\u2019 Goosebumps rose on my arms. \u2018I don\u2019t see any blood. At all.\u2019This girl\u2026 wasn\u2019t even screaming in pain. She wasn\u2019t screaming in pain, just crying out in shock.It might be a baby goblin, but there was still a dagger in its hands. It was using the blade to hack away at this schoolgirl\u2019s ankles. It seemed the baby goblin was completely absorbed with the task of cutting the girl\u2019s ankles.\u2018She hasn\u2019t taken any damage.\u2019Had this schoolgirl also received an Open Beta Bonus? She might have received something that could protect her body.\u2018But even if that\u2019s the case\u2026 How could a girl this young have\u2026?\u2019At best, she was a middle school student. It was known that \u2018talent plates\u2019 typically opened up the most from one\u2019s late teens to early 20s, meaning this girl in her early teens hadn\u2019t even properly opened up yet.\u2018She\u2019s blocking that dagger without any armor, with just the abilities of her bare body.\u2019That would be impossible, even for the Fist King So Yoohyun at level 1. This girl didn\u2019t even know about her own condition right now. She merely felt a sharp sensation at her ankles with some slicing noises. In her state of panic, she didn\u2019t even realize that she was still perfectly fine.\u2018Is this\u2026 the\u00a0talent\u00a0I\u2019ve only heard about?\u2019What would happen if she were given a chance to really grow? And if he could make her an ally? Or even if he could just make her indebted to him for saving her life?\u2018In the worst case scenario, she could\u2026\u2019There probably wouldn\u2019t be many opportunities like that, but this girl\u2019s \u2018resilience\u2019 could be a huge help to me in the worst case scenario. She was orders of magnitude different from a guy like me who had received a \u2018No Talent\u2019 evaluation because I had no talent plates.\u2018There\u2019s no time.\u2019The 2nd wave of attacks would soon begin.Having followed me, Senia said, \u201cEven though it is a baby goblin, it would be very difficult for someone with level 1 abilities to defeat.\u2019Senia had apparently recognized me as \u2018good quality content\u2019. It seemed she had at least judged that it would be a waste to let me die here.I had to make a decision.\u2018I will\u2026!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: Level 8 in PracticeI knew the strategies for clearing the Tutorial very well. No, not just the Tutorial, but all the events that would happen afterwards. After all, that was what I had memorized by rote for three years.\u2018I know about this field better than anyone.\u2019I didn\u2019t have the time, the leisure, or the money. Although hobbies were a luxury for me, I still had one. There was just one thing I had enjoyed, and that was sitting in front of the 10-year-old computer in my half-basement room and watching Youtube videos with the resolution fully turned down.\u2018When it comes to the theory, I\u2019m way more knowledgeable than most Players.\u2019I had no talent. That was the evaluation I received. In a world of Players where talent was valued over all else, \u2018No Talent\u2019 meant you couldn\u2019t rise to the top on effort alone. The talentless me simply browsed Youtube dungeon strategy videos several times over, dreaming of a reality that couldn\u2019t be.[Even though it is a baby goblin, it would be very difficult for someone with level 1 abilities to defeat it.]Those words were meaningless to me. Fighting it head on would be difficult, but I knew its weakness.\u2018A goblin\u2019s weakness.\u2019As expected of a low-rank monster, goblins had one weakness that could be easily exploited.Kikik! Kikikikik!The baby goblin was still focusing on cutting the young girl\u2019s ankles.\u2018The back of the neck.\u2019I breathed out.\u2018The center of the back of the neck.\u2019In the center, there was a large black dot. That was a fatal weak point where a good hit could cause instant death to the goblin. Actually, as long as you knew its weakness, a goblin was an easy monster to conquer. It was just that they tended to move in swarms, the numbers being problematic.\u2018Inventory.\u2019For a moment, it seemed as if a faint light was coming from my hand, and then an item appeared in my grip. To me, it wasn\u2019t that shocking a sight.[You have equipped the Rusted Iron Sword.]I stealthily walked to the back of the baby goblin.\u2018I\u2019ll pierce it.\u2019I was someone who had struggled to kill a single big cockroach before this. I bit my lips hard. I had to completely resolve myself.\u2018Die!\u2019Holding the Rusted Iron Sword, I plunged the blade into the back of the baby goblin\u2019s neck.Squelch!From the tip of the blade, to the hilt of the sword, to my hand, I felt the chilling sensation of piercing through flesh.\u2018I-I did it.\u2019I killed it in one blow.Splurt!Blood splattered, and a part of it landed on my clothes, but I paid it no heed. I didn\u2019t have the time for that.[You have killed a baby goblin.][EXP acquired.]It wasn\u2019t visible to the eye, but I was able to confirm that I had received EXP. It was a feeling that automatically appeared in my head. A third of the EXP bar filled up.\u2018I really killed it.\u2019And in one blow. Yes, it was only a baby goblin, and yes, I knew the strategy, but that I was able to kill it in one blow could only be described as having good luck.\u2018I was lucky.\u2019It was really not easy for a total beginner, no matter how high their starting stats, to kill a monster in one hit.\u2018Wait\u2026 Was it really lucky?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t be sure. Such a situation could only be described as lucky, but\u2026 \u2018Why is it so easy?\u2019Somehow, it was too easy. It was a little iffy to say it boiled down \u2018being lucky\u2019. My hand went through the motions as if familiar with them, like I had been Playing since long ago.It seemed this situation was unexpected for Streamer Senia as well. Her mouth moved almost imperceptibly, and she spoke in a low voice. She was probably narrating the scene to the Guardians.[A level 1 Player has killed a baby goblin with just one attack.]She was speaking calmly, but the tips of Senia\u2019s wings were trembling. It was one of the characteristics of angel Streamers. Whenever there was a disturbance in their emotions, the tips of their wings would tremble.I decided to handle the important matters in front of me first.\u201cGet up.\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes lacked focus. \u201cGet a hold of yourself. If you lose track of me, I\u2019ll leave you behind.\u201dThose words must have had an effect, because the teenager snapped to her senses.\u201cI-I\u2019m coming.\u201dI walked ahead of her.

Glancing behind me, I saw that the girl was trailing closely in a half-conscious state. I closed the door.Senia was standing amidst the goblin swarm, looking noble as she stood there all alone while describing the scenery around her. Perhaps she had set me as her main target, because she didn\u2019t stray far from me.\u201cNo matter what happens from now on, don\u2019t open this door.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cUnderstood?\u201dI understood the girl had been in huge shock, but I had no intention of entertaining excessive childishness. Because this was the Tutorial Field, where 14,500 out of 15,000 people perished, and because I wouldn\u2019t do something so foolish as surrendering my life in order to take care of one kid.\u201cAnswer me. Do you understand?\u201dThe girl nodded.\u201cNo matter who comes, even if they ask you to open it, you must never, ever open the door.\u201d\u201cI-I understand. I promise.\u201dThe girl was completely taken over by fear. To her, I was probably simultaneously her life\u2019s savior and a monstrous man who had stabbed a terrifying green beast to death. Her fear was understandable.[The 2nd wave of goblin attacks will soon begin.][The establishment of Safe Zones is beginning.]I asked, \u201cYou hear the notices too, right?\u201d\u201cN-Notices?\u201d\u201cThe voice you hear in your head.\u201d\u201cAh\u2014\u201dIt seemed this girl had thought of this sound not as a \u2018notice\u2019, but something like an \u2018auditory hallucination\u2019.\u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d\u201cSoon\u2026 an attack will be starting. And that Safe Zones are being established\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere, exactly?\u201d\u201cT-The school and convenience store, the hospital\u2026 they\u2019ve been established as Safe Zones.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dMy guess that this girl had awakened as a Player was correct.\u2018So she heard the hospital.\u2019People with a normal amount of talent would only hear up to the \u2018convenience store\u2019. People with more outstanding talent would hear the \u2018hospital\u2019 as well. That was what was known.\u2018But wait, didn\u2019t I hear the hospital too?\u2019But I even heard an additional notice.[In addition, the 2nd floor of the D-Tower parking lot is being established as an extra Safe Zone.\u2019]I stared at the girl.\u2018I don\u2019t think she heard that?\u2019She hadn\u2019t said anything afterwards, so it seemed she hadn\u2019t heard \u20182nd floor of the D-Tower parking lot\u2019.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019I felt a bit of panic. There was another Safe Zone other than the hospital? That was something I hadn\u2019t known at all. Such a Safe Zone didn\u2019t show up even in the memoir of the Tutorial Ender, Fist King So Yoohyun. None of the past Players had said anything about there being another Safe Zone in the Tutorial.\u2018And it\u2019s the D-Tower parking lot of all places?\u2019Was there always a Safe Zone in the central field of the Tutorial, the \u2018D-Tower\u2019? If there was, it wasn\u2019t widespread knowledge.[The establishment of Safe Zones has concluded.][The 2nd wave of goblin attacks is beginning.]I had to steel myself. Soon, hell would break loose. Those who hadn\u2019t found a Safe Zone, those who hadn\u2019t gone into the buildings fast enough, they would all die.\u201cDon\u2019t open the door, ever. Actually, don\u2019t even look in the direction of the door and sit down with your back to it.\u201dThis place was an established Safe Zone. It was impossible to forcibly break in. Breaking the glass door to come in was also impossible, for monsters and people alike. Only a Player or monster of a rank that exceeded the establishment parameters could break in.\u2018There\u2019s no one like that in the Tutorial.\u2019The moment the door was opened from within, the Safe Zone would be deactivated, and I would have no choice but to greet a gruesome death.[The Primordial Fog is starting to recede.]The world outside the window was ghastly. Laying here and there were corpses. It was as if the city had been painted with crimson red paint. There were pieces of people, not mannequins, scattered about, and the road was absolute pandemonium.\u201cO-O-Open the door! I said open the door!\u201d\u201cOpen up! Open the door.

People gathered in small groups to put up a resistance, but as expected, they couldn\u2019t deal with those numbers.I could only watch from this spot\u2014a safe place\u2014as people died and were eaten alive.\u2018Dammit!!\u2019I didn\u2019t turn away from any of it. I had to watch.\u2018I\u2019ll\u2026 remember it all.\u2019One day, I would fuck over the System and the Guardians that created this situation and were watching this hell like they were enjoying a game.\u2018This moment, this scene. I won\u2019t forget it.\u2019I looked harder.\u2018Never. I\u2019ll never forget.\u2019* * *A day passed. The girl\u2019s name was Kang Sunhwa. She was in her first year of middle school. At first, she was frozen in fear, but she recovered fairly quickly\u2014her mental fortitude was stronger than expected. It was a relief that she got a hold of herself quickly.\u201cUm\u2026 may I call you oppa?\u201dTN: Oppa is a familiar term used by girls for an older man.I gave a slight nod. Oppa was correct, because mister wasn\u2019t quite right. My mental age aside, I had returned to twenty years of age. With a six year difference between us, oppa was about right.After around six hours since the beginning of the 2nd wave, it became rather quiet. By which I meant, there weren\u2019t that many living people nearby.\u201cThank you. For saving me. I haven\u2019t thanked you properly yet. I was just so scared\u2026\u2019Looking at the way her eyes reddened while speaking, it seemed she hadn\u2019t quite gotten over her shock. Yes. That was normal. But still, it was pretty impressive. She looked pretty calm\u2014at least on the outside.\u201cI\u2019m so glad I met you, oppa.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you so much.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe conversation became rather one-sided.\u201cPlease don\u2019t throw me away. I\u2019m a really good girl. I\u2019m good at washing dishes, cleaning, and tidying my clothes.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh. That so?\u201dFor words spoken by a 14-year-old, they were a bit strange. I was surprised she suddenly asked me not to throw her away. People didn\u2019t usually say things like that, even with the situation being the way it was, right? Was it because she was that scared of being abandoned? I didn\u2019t know how to respond.It was true that I saved this girl, but it was also a calculated move, not out of the sheer kindness of my heart.\u201cThat\u2019s enough with the thanks. We don\u2019t know if either of us will survive to the end anyway.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cIf necessary, I will use you as bait and make a run for it.\u201dSunhwa\u2019s face darkened. I decided to give it to her straight.Another six hours passed. In the meantime, Sunhwa had apparently gotten more familiar with me.\u201cI think I can survive if I\u2019m with oppa. Though I\u2019m just as scared as before\u2026\u201dShe attempted a fairly bright smile, trying to put on a brave front.\u2018She\u2019s cute.\u2019It was pretty cute. There wasn\u2019t much meaning behind it, just that she was cute. Obviously, it was absolutely not as a man to woman sense. How should I say it? She was kinda like a niece.\u201cOppa looks very strong.\u201d\u201cIf I were strong, I would have gone out there and killed them all.\u201dI pointed out the window. Outside the Safe Zone, goblins were staring at us, snickering and slamming their clubs into the window. Almost as if we were animals trapped in a zoo.With a shriek, Sunhwa scrambled backwards on her butt and hid behind me. She had a really small build.\u201cO-Oppa, aren\u2019t you scared?\u201cWho knows?\u201dI\u00a0was\u00a0scared. But more pressing than my fear was my anger, the helplessness of not being able to do anything. That was more present in my mind.\u2018After the 2nd wave of attacks\u2026\u2019Until the end of the goblins\u2019 2nd wave of attacks, it was all about staying hidden. But once the 2nd wave ended, things would change a little.\u201cI might not be able to protect you for the seven days of the Tutorial.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd I can\u2019t take complete responsibility for you, either.\u201dLooking after myself was hard enough.\u201cHowever, I won\u2019t leave you here if nothing happens, so get some rest.\u201dSunhwa stared at me with eyes full of tears. It seemed she thought I would leave her and go if she fell asleep.\u201cHey. I won\u2019t. Unless it\u2019s a situation where my life\u2019s in danger, I won\u2019t throw you away, so trust me and go to sleep.\u201d\u201cYou really won\u2019t? I can trust you, right?\u201dShe was rather scared of being abandoned. I said, as if annoyed, \u201cJust trust me. Even if you don\u2019t, what can you do?\u201d\u201cT-That\u2019s true,\u201d Sunhwa said, looking defeated.\u201cSo get some rest for now. You\u2019ll need your energy.\u201d\u201cGot it. I\u2019ll do as you say.\u201dAfter the 2nd wave of attacks, I would have to walk through the road littered with corpses. My destination would be the crux of clearing the Tutorial, which coincidentally happened to be the \u2018Gwanghwamun D-Tower\u2019, the location of the established Safe Zone that no one else had heard of.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If I listened carefully, I could hear something like sniffling and sobbing behind me. I didn\u2019t check to see, but she was probably crying. There was no way she\u2019d seen anything like this before.\u2018I wonder if this is what a city on the verge of ruin, no\u2026 an already ruined city feels like.\u2019It felt like the entirety of Jongno had become a ghost town.\u2018I wonder if there are even 10,000 people still alive by now.\u2019That was my best guess, but in all actuality, the number wasn\u2019t the important thing right now.\u2018I can\u2019t see any people.\u2019There were corpses, not people, lining the road.

Be sure to tell me if you see any jelly-like thing crawling around.\u201dOn the way to D-Tower, we had to hunt. Our primary goal was \u2018slimes\u2019. As \u2018neutral\u2019 monsters, they didn\u2019t attack unless attacked first. Their levels were marked as \u2018-\u2019. They were the safest monsters, ones that even a 10-year-old child could kill.\u201cOppa, there\u2019s one over there.\u201dI also spotted the jelly-shaped monster crawling out from under a car.[Slime -]Sure enough, it had no levels and was marked with a \u2018-\u2019. I approached the slime and swung my sword. As could be expected from its jelly shape, there was a sloshing sensation, but the damage was properly inflicted. They weren\u2019t hard to kill.[EXP acquired.][3 Coins acquired.]\u201cIt disappeared.\u201d\u201cYeah. They\u2019re really weak monsters. Let\u2019s go. We have to keep killing them while we walk.\u201dHere as well, I could feel it.\u2018Why\u2019s it so easy?\u2019No matter how weak a monster it was, it felt way too easy. I had felt this from the start, but it felt like I had always been Playing.\u2018This Rusted Iron Sword\u2026\u2019Did I maybe use it in my dreams? Even if I did, for a weapon I\u2019d never used before, it felt extremely familiar in my hand, almost as if I had trained with it for a long time.\u201cKeep a good eye out for them.\u201d\u201cGot it. I\u2019ll try to find them.\u201dSunhwa did the best she could. Here, in this place littered with corpses, this gruesome place stained by pools of blood, she was adapting far better than I had expected.\u201cOppa. There\u2019s one here!\u201dHer ability to find the monsters alone seemed far better than mine.\u201cOppa, over here.\u201dAfter hunting about five slimes, I heard the level up notice.[Level increased.][Current level: 2][2 bonus stats acquired.][1 random bonus stat acquired.]Sunhwa stared at me in fascination. \u201cOppa, your body was shining just now. How come?\u201d\u201cI leveled up.\u201d\u201cLeveled up?\u201d She seemed amazed by leveling up.\u201cYeah. You level up when you kill monsters. And when you level up, you become stronger.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I see.\u201d After a pause, \u201cI also want to work hard to level up and become like oppa.\u201dSunhwa\u2019s face was still full of curiosity, but perhaps because she didn\u2019t want to annoy me, she didn\u2019t pester me with more questions. I caught a few more slimes.[Level increased.][Current level: 3][2 bonus stats acquired.][1 random bonus stat acquired.]Once again, I noticed that something was strange.\u2018It\u2019s weird.\u2019 For some reason, I had the feeling I was leveling up too quickly. \u2018Is it different when you Play in person?\u2019The only Playing I had experienced was in VR, like VR videos on Youtube and VR experiences like \u2018virtual dungeons\u2019, and the rote memorization of strategy guides through textbooks. That was the limit of my Playing.\u2018In person, it actually feels like I\u2019m leveling up really fast.\u2019 That wasn\u2019t all. \u2018I\u2019ve already gotten 2 random bonus stats.\u2019Random bonus stats weren\u2019t usually given that frequently. That applied in the Tutorial Arena as well.\u2018The Fist King\u2026 So Yoohyun also said he hadn\u2019t seen random bonus stats that often.\u2019Even the pride of Korea, the named Player So Yoohyun who ranked within the top 10 in Korea when it came to talent, said it had been difficult for him to get bonus stats. But I had already earned two, and I was only at level 3.I suddenly thought back to the evaluation results.[No Talent.]A few days ago, those two words had stung particularly badly. I sorted the thoughts in my head.\u2018Did I gain talent I didn\u2019t have in the process of returning to the past?\u2019If that wasn\u2019t it\u2026\u2018An early bloomer Player who sees explosive growth only in the beginning.\u2019That seemed like the most likely option. There were a lot of them in Korea as well. Countless Players had appeared like meteors and had faded just as quickly. Many Players, called \u2018Rising Stars\u2019 or \u2018Super Rookies\u2019, made their names with their explosive speed of level ups and incredible skills in the lower levels, but were unable to pass the middle levels and faded into obscurity.\u2018That I\u2019m an early bloomer is the most likely possibility.\u2019I decided to think of it like that. I had to approach it this way so I wouldn\u2019t be disappointed later. I\u2019d look only a few steps ahead, not a few miles.\u2018For now, it\u2019s advantageous for me.\u2019Someone who had nothing, absolutely jack, returned to the past and somehow survived the 1st and 2nd goblin waves, and even drew the attention of Guardians. Even assuming I was an early bloomer, I was already level 3.\u2018The goal is to survive, and then\u2026\u2019 I came up with a goal. \u2018$1 million.\u2019That was my goal. Even an early bloomer Player could earn $1 million without much difficulty. With that much money, I would be able to get treatment for my mom. In three years, the \u2018illness curing potion\u2019 would be put on the market.\u2018Let\u2019s not look too far ahead.\u2019I did want to strike down the Guardians, but that was too far in the future. I might even be an early bloomer Player. For now, my goal was to survive, and then, earn $1 million. I could think of what came afterwards later.[Level increased.][Current level: 5]I got bonus stats and random stats yet again. Before I knew it, I was level 5.[Party System activation is now possible.]I immediately sent Sunhwa a \u2018party invite\u2019. Sunhwa was shocked and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dBut she accepted the party invite before long.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is observing you with interest.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is showing great interest in you.]I didn\u2019t hear any notices from the \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019.As we continued to walk to D-Tower, the girl trailing behind me said, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do my best. I\u2019ll be of help to oppa.\u201dWhat was she on about all of a sudden again? I was about to say I\u2019d leave her behind if she wasn\u2019t helpful when she continued speaking.\u201cSo\u2026 Please don\u2019t throw me away.\u201dAgain? I really couldn\u2019t understand why she was always begging not to be abandoned.\u201cPlease don\u2019t give up on me. I\u2019ll really do my best.\u201dI did feel a little bad for her. What would drive such a young girl to say something like this? But I kept up a hard front and said, \u201cShow me with your actions and not your words.\u201dIt might\u2019ve seemed cold, but I rationally laid out the reality. Half-assed sympathy or kindness would only harm the child.\u201cIf I don\u2019t need you, I will throw you away without hesitation.\u201dIt was hard enough to take care of myself. My leveling speed was much faster than expected and I had already gotten four random bonus stats, but that was nothing. When I hunted the monster waiting on the 1st floor of the D-Tower, there was no guarantee I could protect Sunhwa.\u2018To begin with\u2026 It was weird I\u2019d be protecting anyone.\u2019What could a level 5 Player do? The path ahead was something you walked on your own. In any case, it seemed like my words had gotten through to Sunhwa.But then, Sunhwa said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that\u2026 a different monster?\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *In the Gwanghwamun area, in front of the Statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin, were different monsters that weren\u2019t slimes.\u2018City foxes.\u2019Their levels were \u20182\u2019 or \u20183\u2019.City Fox LVL 3They weren\u2019t difficult monsters to kill. But killing them felt way harder than slimes. It was because I wasn\u2019t used to killing living beings yet.\u2018Even though the goblins are dead.\u2019The overall grey, fox-shaped monsters were \u2018passive\u2019 monsters. If you didn\u2019t mess with them, they were neutral, but they would aggro the moment you attacked. Attacking one would draw others towards you.\u2018Hm?\u2019But when Sunhwa said \u201cTaunt,\u201d a \u2018!!!\u2019 mark appeared above the heads of the city foxes, and they came running towards Sunhwa. The city foxes wildly bit at Sunhwa\u2019s body.I was shocked. \u2018AOE aggro?\u2019They were just low-level monsters at level 2 or 3, and Sunhwa was only level 3, but she was able to achieve an AOE aggro of this level. It looked like she had taunted all of the city foxes in the area, which looked to be about 14 foxes.\u2018She\u2019s not taking any damage.\u2019I wasn\u2019t sitting around, sucking my thumb, either. Most animal monsters had the neck as the weak spot. I was able to hunt the city foxes without difficulty. Leveling with slimes was difficult now, but when I killed the city foxes, my EXP shot up.[EXP acquired.][7 Coins acquired.][Level increased.][Current level: 8]All of my fatigue disappeared with the level ups. That was a special characteristic of level ups\u2014when you rose one level, all of your fatigue would fly away, and you would return to your best condition.\u2018My leveling speed is way faster than I thought.\u2019I was already level 8. If things had gone as I expected\u2014educated guess from countless strats\u2014I would be around level 5 by now. I thought I would just be getting to the Party System, but I was already level 8. It might seem as though level 5 and 8 weren\u2019t that different, but that was absolutely not the case.\u20184 level ups vs. 7. In terms of speed, it\u2019s nearly twice as fast.\u2019Going from level 4 to 8 was way harder than going from 1 to 4. With that in mind, I was leveling up at more than double the speed. Far faster than expected.\u2018This is a crazy leveling speed.\u2019It was so fast it was absurd. The Guardians seemed to think the same, because Senia, who had been wandering around, approached me. She captured the scene of me leveling up and asked, \u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin, what is your current level?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI thought for a moment. Should I tell her, or not? There were advantages to both options. I decided to tell her, for now.\u201cLevel 8.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia\u2019s wingtips trembled again.\u201cThere\u2019s no mistake that you\u2019re level 8?\u201d\u201cYou can scan me if you want.\u201dSenia stared at me in disbelief for a while. After a long moment, she opened her mouth again.\u201c\u2026You really are level 8.\u201dShe didn\u2019t show it, but she seemed shocked. There was no doubt; My leveling speed was out of the ordinary. It wasn\u2019t just my imagination.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 expresses their surprise at your leveling speed.][A large number of anonymous Guardians are amazed.]After checking my level, Senia returned to her usual half-transparent state.\u2018My leveling speed must definitely be really damn fast.\u2019Sunhwa and I hunted a little longer in the vicinity.[You have killed a city fox.][EXP acquired.][7 Coins acquired.]My EXP rose until I was on the verge of hitting level 9. In the Tutorial Arena, the max level was 10.\u2018Soon, I\u2019ll be level 9.\u2019I decided to stop hunting now. After all, my objective was the \u2018D-Tower\u2019. More specifically, the 1st floor of the D-Tower. If I could clear that floor well, I would gain a ton of bonuses and pretty much become the face of Players worldwide.\u2018If I can just do that part well\u2026\u2019Earning $1 million afterwards would be no problem, even if I were an early bloomer. Sunhwa and I arrived at the D-Tower. There were multiple entrances.\u2018This one.\u2019I chose the one without monsters. I heard a notice.[The necessary level to enter the Tutorial Dungeon, D-Tower, is 5.][Will you enter the Tutorial Dungeon, D-Tower?]\u2018YES.\u2019I selected yes. The revolving door began to slowly move, as if inviting me to come inside. Sunhwa clutched a part of my clothes behind me, a little scared.\u201cYou remember what we have to do when we\u2019re inside, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSunhwa\u2019s voice trembled a little. I knew that, but I didn\u2019t show it on my face, because although Sunhwa wasn\u2019t trying to act spoiled, I had no intention of humoring her, even if she was. For a brief moment, I checked my stats.[Status Window]Name: Kim Hyukjin (Player)Level: 8Title: \u2013Strength: 14Intelligence: 14Agility: 14Perception: 14Constitution: 14Willpower: 13 (+30)Bonus stats: 0Random stats: 4Undistributed stats: 4According to the Rankers, it was best to raise your stats evenly in the beginning. That was the established theory.\u2018Are these really the stats of a level 8?\u2019It was completely different from other level 8s in my memory. It gave me confidence.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dI went ahead first. The half-transparent Senia followed me.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is observing you with interest.]\u2018Carelessness is death.\u2019This was undoubtedly a dangerous place for someone at my level, a place that could become one\u2019s grave if they entered without knowing the strategy, and in just one hit. I reviewed the strategy one more time in my head. And then, I entered the Tutorial Dungeon.[You have entered the Tutorial Dungeon, D-Tower.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: D-Tower 1st FloorOn the 1st floor of the D-Tower, I could see the escalator going to the second floor and a few \u2018city foxes\u2019 and \u2018goblins\u2019 nearby. It might be a Tutorial, but a dungeon was a dungeon.\u201cThey\u2019ll be at least one level higher than the monsters outside.\u201dSure enough:City Fox LVL 4The city foxes and goblins were 1-2 levels higher. Some were even 3 levels higher.Goblin LVL 8Like I had arranged in advance, I disbanded the party with Sunhwa. In other words, we weren\u2019t sharing EXP.\u201cStart with all the goblins you can see.\u201dIf you didn\u2019t touch the foxes, they wouldn\u2019t turn hostile. In higher level dungeons, all the monsters were hostile. But this was the Tutorial Dungeon. This Tutorial might not seem like a tutorial at all, but there was no denying it was easier than a higher level dungeon.Sunhwa did way better than I expected.\u2018As expected\u2026 must be the effect of the talent.\u2019There was a time when she was scared shitless by a baby goblin, but after just four days together, Sunhwa was hunting adult goblins just fine.\u2018She\u2019s killing them well, even though she\u2019s only level 6.\u2019A level 6 Player was making quick work of a level 8 goblin. This had to be the effect of talent.\u201cTake a break after taking care of that goblin.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dSunhwa got rid of the last remaining goblin. For reference, the item she had equipped was \u2018Worn Iron Gauntlets\u2019. Sunhwa clobbered the goblin with her fists, all while precisely striking the weak point I\u2019d told her about.\u2018She\u2019s doing really well.\u2019The goblins\u2019 attacks didn\u2019t register on Sunhwa at all, almost as if she had some kind of special skill or special constitution.Turning to me, she asked, \u201cDid I do well?\u201d\u201cNope. Did you think so?\u201dSunhwa shook her head. \u201cI think I\u2019m way worse compared to you, oppa.\u201dHuh. \u2018Actually, that\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\u2019To be honest, the Playing of this child I considered a genius didn\u2019t look all that impressive to me. Was it because she was young or because I was underestimating her?\u2018But why am\u00a0I\u00a0so good at this?\u2019I didn\u2019t know why. In any case, there was no mistake\u2014so far, I was Playing even better than Sunhwa. So much so that I had the very rational question of \u2018Am I a genius?\u2019\u201cThe miniboss will spawn soon.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe miniboss, the \u2018Goblin Soldier\u2019, would soon appear. The Goblin Soldier\u2019s level would be displayed as \u2018?\u2019, as it would be a much higher level than me. The estimated level was roughly 13. Mine was currently 8.\u2018I can do this.\u2019That was already proven through countless clears. I had seen the VR dungeon Play many times. Of course, that was an artificial VR dungeon based on the recollections of the \u2018Fist King So Yoohyun\u2019 and other survivors, but clearing the 1st floor\u00a0was\u00a0possible from level 8.\u2018No, you\u00a0have\u00a0to be level 8 for it to be possible.\u2019After hunting all of the goblins and city foxes here, the miniboss, the \u2018Goblin Soldier\u2019, would spawn.\u201cGood to go again, right?\u201d\u201cYes. I think I\u2019ve recovered my stamina as well.\u201d\u201cThen catch the rest of them.\u201dWhen the rest were killed, the \u2018Goblin Soldier\u2019 would appear, and we would form the party again before that.\u201cRun back here right away afterwards.\u201dHere, near the ATM. I reminded her again.\u201cGot it.\u201dSunhwa carried out my orders to a T. She killed the rest of the monsters, and in doing so, she hit level 7.\u201cOppa, I got them all.\u201d\u201cI know. Run back here.\u201dSunhwa ran over, and the two of us hid ourselves behind the ATM on the 1st floor. We were squeezed in together as much as possible. It was a good thing Sunhwa had a small build.I said quietly, \u201cLower your head.\u201dJust then, the entirety of the field momentarily turned grey, almost like someone had pressed the pause button in a game.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *\u2018Isn\u2019t this a Pause?\u2019Intermediate Administrators could briefly suspend a field with their individual authorities or with an \u2018item\u2019.\u2018But this item costs a pretty penny.\u2019I didn\u2019t know exactly how much, but I heard you had to invest quite a lot of Coins in it. It was a kind of power used by Streamers when they wanted to interfere with a Player, during which the video transmission to the Guardians was turned off.[A Pause has taken effect.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 expresses intense curiosity.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 has begun to take an interest again.][Anonymous Guardians have begun to clamor.]\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin. Are you in your right mind?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dSenia stared at me expressionlessly. Her eyes lacked emotion, but they were rather intense.\u201cYou have acted as if you know everything. Is this situation also one that you have intended?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of ability you have, but if you have such a power, why in the world are you doing such a foolish thing?\u201d\u201cAgain, what do you mean?\u201dAfter staring at me for a moment, Senia slowly continued. \u201cThe Goblin Soldier is level 13. It\u2019s also receiving a boss monster stat buff. It is not a creature you can defeat right now. Much less with only two people.\u201dWhat the heck? Was this woman always so talkative?\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you would rather not see me die, hm?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe reason was obvious.\u2018Because I\u2019m a Player who can provide the material to create a hit.\u2019It was because I made good quality content. If I had to guess, I had to be the person carrying out the most unique Playing out of the countless Players out there, unless there was another regressor who had memorized every Play by heart like I had.A Player like me was material,\u00a0content, that a Streamer would be hard-pressed to find again.\u201cBy the way, Senia. Your way of talking is insufferable.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Are you insulting me?\u201d\u201cLet me give you a tip.\u201dI knew about the Streamers of the future. I knew about many Intermediate Administrators, as well as many Streamers on Youtube. I knew how they ticked, and even had a rough understanding of how to become a famous Streamer. An expressionless Streamer who spoke with this little eloquence and only had looks going for her wouldn\u2019t be able to survive the fierce competition.\u201cWhen the pause ends, make a big fuss. No, wait. Making a fuss would be difficult with your personality. Just explain that it\u2019s a monster I could never possibly catch. That\u2019s the truth, after all.\u201dThis was going slightly off-topic, but Senia was truly beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that the thought periodically invaded my mind despite not being the time or place.\u2018If she wasn\u2019t able to become famous later despite being this beautiful\u2026\u2019It meant she had been eliminated, unable to survive the competition between the Streamers.\u201cDo some directing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia continued to stare at me with the same expressionless face as before. She didn\u2019t respond, but seeing as her wingtips were trembling, it did seem that my words had caused a ripple in her heart.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll successfully kill the monster without dying.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 will kill the Goblin Soldier?\u201d\u201cYeah. The Goblin Soldier.\u201d\u201cYou are incapable of doing so. It is impossible.\u201d\u201cSo watch. Watch how I kill it. Isn\u2019t it some great hit material? A real scrub of a Player destroying a frickin\u2019 Tutorial Dungeon miniboss.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe more Guardians watching, the better. Famous Streamers were sure to attract famous Guardians, because such Guardians were unstinting in their support to Streamers and Players.\u201cMake a deal with me.\u201dBefore I could say anything, Senia quickly interjected. \u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin. Your impudence has gone too far. You are level 8. There is a limit to how much disrespect I can tolerate.\u201dAs expected, an Intermediate Administrator was an Intermediate Administrator, through and through. She was someone who could kill me anytime for any offense. Unless it was related to the \u2018Commandments\u2019, it was no big issue for an Administrator to kill me. She could have probably split my body into two with a single lift of her finger.I said, \u201cIf you had wanted to kill me, you would have done so already.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut you even used your Pause power to stop me, didn\u2019t you? Could you really bear to kill me? Isn\u2019t that power very expensive?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia\u2019s wingtips trembled once again. I was sure of it. This woman might be a skilled Administrator, but she was an inept talker. She must have been eliminated from the Streamer competition because she was so inarticulate and only had a pretty face.\u201cI, a level 8 Player with no real skills, will defeat the miniboss. The Guardians might even strip naked in utter excitement. And you could instantly become an Administrator producing quality content.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a loss for you, am I right?\u201dIn the end, Senia asked, \u201cWhat are your trade conditions?\u201d\u201cFor now, what do you think about discussing it after I kill the miniboss? I think the pause time is almost over.\u201dFor the first time since meeting me, Senia betrayed a small frown on her face. For the first time since meeting me, there was a change in her expression. It was as if she were asking, \u2018How in the world do you know all of this?\u2019 Naturally, I wouldn\u2019t answer her question, and there was no need to do so.\u201cI understand. I will watch. Keep this in mind. The Goblin Soldier\u2026 is something you could never defeat with your current power.\u201dAt that instant, the \u2018Pause\u2019 ended. The monochrome world returned to normal, the momentarily paused time beginning to tick once more.[All of the field\u2019s monsters have been eliminated.][The conditions to spawn the miniboss \u2018Goblin Soldier\u2019 have been fulfilled.][The miniboss \u2018Goblin Soldier\u2019 is spawning.]\u2018It\u2019s coming.\u2019Currently, I was next to the ATM, crouching there with Sunhwa halfway in my arms.

I spoke confidently to Senia, but couldn\u2019t help but be nervous.[The \u2018Goblin Soldier\u2019 has spawned.][A miniboss zone has been declared.]The miniboss, the Goblin Soldier, appeared. Soon, it would look around, seeing corpses in the vicinity.\u2018It\u2019ll be enraged.\u2019And I was right.[The miniboss \u2018Goblin Soldier\u2019 expresses its rage.]And then, the enraged Goblin Soldier would use its most threatening attack as soon as it appeared. Spear Throw\u2014its most dangerous ability. That was an attack I couldn\u2019t take on with my current abilities, an attack that would instantly kill me if it hit me full-on.Kikikik!The Goblin Soldier\u2019s scream made a shiver run down my spine.Schwip\u2013!There was a whistle in the air. It was hard to put it in words, but it felt like something terrifying was approaching.\u2018It\u2019s coming.\u2019A\u00a0thud!\u00a0rang out as the Goblin Soldier\u2019s spear punched through the ATM. Something sharp was protruding a bit a little above where I was crouching.Drip.Sweat ran down my brow. I\u2019d only seen the clears; doing it in person was incredibly spine-tingling.\u2018First hurdle, done.\u2019The Goblin Soldier\u2019s most threatening attack was neutralized. The very moment it appeared, it would fiercely hurl a spear towards the Players. This attack was the most terrifying one, which was why we hid, using the ATM as a shield.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is astonished by your wits.][Anonymous Guardians are tuning into Channel #19207 in great numbers.][The \u2018Nameless Guardian\u2019 has sent you a 50 Coin sponsorship.]I wasn\u2019t able to pay attention to the notices. \u2018Hiding next to the ATM was the most effective move in the clears.\u2019If a Player moved elsewhere, the Goblin Soldier would move as well, coming closer and then throwing its spear.\u2018This is the perfect distance for making that bastard throw its spear without moving.\u2019The place that could also provide cover at the same time was next to the ATM. This hunting spot, determined to be the optimum location through VR dungeons, was the perfect place for blocking the most dangerous attack.I snuck a glance at the half-transparent Senia.\u2018Watch carefully.\u2019Watch how a lousy level 8 Player kills a miniboss monster.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even more than the Goblin Soldier.She reviewed each and every thing Kim Hyukjin had said, balling her fists.\u2018I can do this!\u2019Sunhwa jumped out from behind the ATM.\u2018Just like what oppa said.\u2019Like Kim Hyukjin said, the monsters in the vicinity had been revived.\u201cTaunt!\u201d[Using the skill Taunt.]Sunhwa used her skill, \u2018Taunt\u2019, and \u2018!!!\u2019 marks appeared over the heads of the city foxes and goblins that had been revived with the appearance of the miniboss monster. It was an indication that she had properly drawn their aggro.\u2018I have to do well.\u2019Some distance away, she saw a goblin around 180 centimetres in size, far bigger and bulkier in appearance than regular goblins.\u2018Because oppa is facing that monster.\u2019The monsters rushed in. But she wasn\u2019t scared. She already knew from experience that even if they bit, attacked, and struck her, it wouldn\u2019t hurt.Putting as little force as possible in her fists, she hit the goblins and city foxes.\u2018That\u2019s enough. I have to stop here.\u2019The HP of the monsters had been reduced to around 10%. Keeping them at that level, Sunhwa waited, periodically using \u2018Taunt\u2019 to keep that \u2018!!!\u2019 over their heads. Surrounded by monsters, Sunhwa stared at Kim Hyukjin. He was panting hard, looking exhausted to the point of collapsing at any moment.\u2018Please\u2026!\u2019Sunhwa put her hands together and prayed. She prayed they would be able to survive.* * *Kim Hyukjin caught his breath, thinking, \u2018The feeling of pressure is insane.\u2019It was bigger than an average adult man. With a little exaggeration, even the muscles were like Hulk\u2019s. It was nothing compared to the monster on the 2nd Floor, but right now, it looked extremely imposing to him. He thought he had grown rather used to that existence called a \u2018monster\u2019, but this monster overturned those thoughts. It was getting a miniboss stat buff, but still, he was floored by the power of a level 13 monster. He couldn\u2019t even imagine how intimidating high level bosses would be.\u2018The thing I have to watch out for is that spear attack.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a high level monster. It was different from a regular level 13 because of the inherent boss mob stat buff, but it still had a very simple attack pattern. A stabbing attack, and a swing from top to bottom. Those were the only two attacks.The \u2018Goblin Soldier\u2019 quickly closed in on Hyukjin.\u2018Here it comes!\u2019Hyukjin gripped the Rusted Iron Sword.\u2018Will he stab, or will he swing?\u2019 He raised his focus to the max. \u2018It\u2019s a swing.\u2019He saw it. He saw that the Goblin Soldier was preparing to swing its spear from top to bottom. He evaded slightly to the side, rushing towards the goblin and swinging the Rusted Iron Sword at the same time.He sliced at the Goblin Soldier\u2019s side. But because his attack power was too low, he wasn\u2019t able to deal an effective blow. It only served to enrage the Goblin Soldier.Kikikikik!Making a sound far louder than a regular goblin, the miniboss swung its spear down on Hyukjin, at a speed that looked extremely fast in Hyukjin\u2019s eyes. It was fast, but not unexpected.Kim Hyukjin swung his iron sword to deftly parry the Goblin Soldier\u2019s strike.The half-transparent Senia focused on that scene. She could see the Guardians making a huge fuss.[Anonymous Guardians are joining Channel #19207 in large numbers.]Senia almost smiled for the first time ever. They didn\u2019t reveal their \u2018True Names\u2019, but the Guardians joined her channel all the same. Her boring, unpopular channel. However, she did not smile. Ever since she was a child, she had been taught that \u2018the act of showing one\u2019s emotions\u2019 was vulgar. She did become an Intermediate Administrator, but she jumped into this job determined not to become vulgar.Various anonymous Guardians peppered her with questions.[Are you sure he\u2019s really level 8?][A level 8 Player is truly raiding the Tutorial Dungeon\u2019s miniboss?]Senia nodded to show her assent. It was true. He avoided the \u2018Initial Strike\u2019 that would cause certain death to a level 8 Player by cleverly using some cover and was fighting the Goblin Soldier. It was unbelievable, but that was the truth. She had never seen a Player like him in any dimension before, at least not in the Tutorial.She wondered what kind of stats he must have to be able to execute such movements. The anonymous Guardians, aka the \u2018Rabble\u2019, were clamoring in disbelief.[Those aren\u2019t the movements of a level 8 though?][How can a level 8 move in that manner?][He didn\u2019t lie about his level?]The Rabble fussed to their content, and the Guardians who had revealed their \u2018True Names\u2019 were keeping an eye on the situation, their eyes glued to the level 8 Player\u2019s incredible Playing. Senia was the same. At this point, even Senia was curious.Yet another Player without much presence caught her eyes. Her name was Kang Sunhwa, an Awakened of the tanker class. She stood still, surrounded by monsters.Just then, Kim Hyukjin yelled, looking so incredibly exhausted it seemed he could faint at any moment.\u201cNow! Kill them!\u201dSenia instantly realized what Kim Hyukjin was trying to do. Sunhwa killed the city foxes.[EXP acquired.][7 Coins acquired.]As someone in the same party as Kang Sunhwa, Kim Hyukjin\u2019s level went up.[Level increased.][Current level: 9]With the level up, his condition recovered. Hyukjin felt refreshed. Moments ago, he was gasping for breath and felt like he could drop dead from exhaustion, but now, he was fine. He purposely timed and planned his EXP like this, so he could level up when needed.\u201cTake the monsters and get some distance between us. The monsters will keep reviving, so kill as many as you can, until I give you the signal to stop.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *After saying that, I engaged with the Goblin Soldier again. Now level 9, I was a little stronger, and a little more used to the Goblin Soldier. Our battle went on for a long thirty minutes. I stuck to the Goblin Soldier like a burr, avoiding critical injuries and occasionally attacking. Time and time again, I aimed for the nape, the common weakness of all goblins.[The Rusted Iron Sword\u2019s durability is decreasing.]Meanwhile, Sunhwa continuously killed monsters.[You have killed a goblin.][You have killed a city fox.][You have killed a goblin.][You have killed a city fox.]We were in the same party, so my EXP continuously rose as well. I managed my stamina, constantly checking my EXP bar.\u2018Soon\u2026 I\u2019ll get another level up.\u2019Kikik! Kikikikikik!Enraged by the annoyance before it, the Goblin Soldier once again swung its spear from top to bottom.I finished my instantaneous calculation.\u2018I\u2019ll let that one hit me.\u2019I decided to sacrifice my left shoulder. I would use my shoulder to aim for the miniboss\u2019 throat, all for the chance of inflicting a deeper blow.\u2018Argh!\u2019The spear plunged into my shoulder. A shoulder-rending agony assailed me, but I held on.\u2018And strike.\u2019I timed it to the millisecond. For that moment, and that moment alone, I forgot I was someone judged to have [No Talent]. It felt as if everything were clear in my eyes, and my entire being was focused on this situation alone.With exactly the right timing, I surged towards the Goblin Soldier. Right at the moment Sunhwa killed a city fox.[Level increased.][Current level: 10]The pain disappeared, and my body returned to normal. I was aiming for this moment. Vigor circulated throughout my entire body as I jabbed the Rusted Iron Sword at the Goblin Soldier\u2019s neck before immediately getting behind it.\u2018I can see it!\u2019I saw the weak spot on the back of the neck, a black dot. That dot seemed large in my eyes.\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201dI thrust the Rusted Iron Sword in with all my strength.\u2018Is it over?\u2019\u2019At that moment:[The Rusted Iron Sword has been destroyed.]It had reached the end of its durability. As the sword was destroyed, the Goblin Soldier\u2019s body began to tip forward.\u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019I finally killed it. The miniboss, the Goblin Soldier.[You have killed the miniboss monster \u2018Goblin Soldier\u2019.][Congratulations.][You are the first to have hunted a \u2018miniboss monster\u2019.]Countless notices flooded in.[EXP acquired.][The level cap of the Tutorial Field is 10.][The minimum number of people required for the Tutorial Dungeon miniboss monster raid has been set to 5.][The system has recognized your raid as a Solo Play.][The Tutorial Field\u2019s level cap has been lifted.]And then:[Leveling up is possible.][Current level: 10][A Hidden Piece qualification condition has been fulfilled.]I was instantly stunned into speechlessness.\u2018I can level up?\u2019The Tutorial Field was capped at level 10. But that level restriction was lifted, and I even fulfilled a \u2018Hidden Piece qualification condition\u2019. I didn\u2019t know what was going on.That wasn\u2019t all. Senia swiftly snagged the body of the Goblin Soldier, and a yellow light radiated from the Goblin Soldier\u2019s body before disappearing. Then, she approached me and handed something to me.\u201cThis is the reward item for hunting the miniboss.\u201d[\u2018Iron Sword\u2019 acquired as a reward.]I was given an \u2018Iron Sword\u2019 to replace the \u2018Rusted Iron Sword\u2019. It had twice the attack power.A sound rang in my head.[The Intermediate Administrator Senia has requested a private chat. Will you accept? Y/N]Senia seemed rather surprised, too, seeing as she blatantly asked for a private chat. This conversation wouldn\u2019t be heard by the Guardians. Sunhwa wouldn\u2019t hear it, either. It was a conversation between Player and Intermediate Administrator, just the two of us.\u2018Accept.\u2019Senia asked me a question expressionlessly.[Did you hunt the miniboss by timing the level up precisely? All while managing your stamina?][I told you I would show you. I\u2019d show you me killing the miniboss.][It was not a Play that someone of your level could show. Do you have a True Name?]A True Name? What in the world was that? I certainly didn\u2019t have anything like that. All I knew was the strategy from the future. However, I didn\u2019t go out of my way to correct her misunderstanding. Even though I didn\u2019t know what a True Name was, there was no big need for me to correct her.[Don\u2019t forget that you agreed to make a deal with me.][\u2026]Was it talent? Was it luck? Or was it something else? I thought I could hear Senia\u2019s voice, but then the private chat ended.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is awed by your shocking ability to concentrate.]\u2018The level 10 cap has been lifted from the Tutorial Field. I also got a new item and even drew admiration from a Guardian.\u2019Did\u2026 I really have [No Talent]? I realized while fighting the Goblin Soldier, but there was no way I was talentless. On the contrary, my talent was immense. I didn\u2019t know what my limits were, but for now, according to what I knew, I had a level of talent unprecedented in the history of the past. It was a bit embarrassing for me to say it, but I ended up wondering if this level of talent was close to \u2018transcendent\u2019.\u2018I even got a sponsorship.\u2019I didn\u2019t notice it before, because I was focusing so intensely, but I had received a \u2018sponsorship.\u2019 It was probably an unprecedented record in the Tutorial Field.It was a very, no,\u00a0incredibly, smooth start. Under the assumption that I didn\u2019t go up to \u2018Floor 2\u2019, at least.However, the notices didn\u2019t stop there.[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 has begun to watch you with interest.]What?I flinched.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: The Tutorial\u2019s Hidden Piece[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 has begun to watch you with interest.]I flinched.\u2018The Lady of the Scales?\u2019Her name alone wasn\u2019t all that impressive. But I was already well-aware of what kind of Guardian the \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 was.\u2018She\u2019s the Guardian of the Typhoon, Jo Sunghyun.\u2019He was one of the 8 Players who represented Korea, and she was a Guardian who prioritized \u2018fairness\u2019 above all and liked Players capable of \u2018doing acts of good\u2019.\u2018Her personality is close to lawful good.\u2019Unlike the \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019, who could care less about whether his sponsored Players died or not, the \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 was a stern upholder of justice and prioritized the wellbeing of her Players.\u2018She also gives appropriate compensation, and is one of the Guardians who gives extremely reliable support.\u2019That the Lady of the Scales had me in her sights was nothing but welcomed news.\u2018Fairness, justice, sacrifice, and commitment. The Lady of the Scales is a Guardian who reacts primarily to such things.\u2019I glanced at Sunhwa behind me. It was commonly said that the Guardians were looking down \u2018from above\u2019.\u2018From up there, it must have looked like I was protecting Sunhwa.\u2019That was my best guess. In any case, it was good. Someone who was told they had [No Talent] like me already had the interest of three Guardians, and the fact I had secured myself a special privilege meant I had made huge strides.\u201cOppa, what do we do now?\u201dMy previous plans changed a little.\u2018Originally\u2026 we were going to leave and hide in the nearby Safety Zone, waiting for the Fist King So Yoohyun to come and kill that thing on the 2nd floor, but\u2026\u2019After killing the Goblin Soldier on the 1st floor, large-scale onslaughts like the goblin attack would end. That meant safety would be pretty much guaranteed afterwards. That\u2019s why I rushed to kill the Goblin Soldier.\u2018For now, we\u2019re safe.\u2019If I killed\u00a0that guy\u00a0on the 2nd floor of the D-Tower, I would get the title of \u2018Tutorial Ender\u2019, but I didn\u2019t hope for that much.\u2018Let\u2019s make full use of the Tutorial Field\u2019s special characteristics.\u2019I zeroed in on my goal, a goal right in front of my eyes. I would earn $1 million.\u2018And then\u2026\u2019To be honest, I wanted to look further ahead. Like anyone else, I wanted to succeed and live well. I wanted to live happily with my family and do everything I wanted. It was too early to jump to conclusions, but currently, I suspected that my talent was very nearly \u2018transcendent\u2019. And I\u2026 didn\u2019t want to let a talent like this go to waste. I no longer wanted to be a burden on my family and study for ages to become a civil servant.Turning to Sunhwa, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go hunt the monsters outside the D-Tower. As many as we can.\u201d\u201cThe city foxes?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dIf we went a bit towards the Cheonggyecheon district, we would run into \u2018city wolves\u2019 instead of \u2018city foxes\u2019. They were pack monsters that were far more ferocious. Even so, they were only slightly higher in level than goblins.\u201cTheir levels are around 7. They sometimes have alphas, and those guys are around level 9. The two of us can hunt them no problem.\u201d\u201cWhere did you learn that?\u201d\u201cI know everything.\u201d\u201cI knew it.\u201dSunhwa didn\u2019t harbor any suspicion. Her eyes showed absolute trust in me.I purposefully didn\u2019t continue to press Senia about the \u2018deal\u2019. She hadn\u2019t mentioned it. I gave a thin smile.\u2018Alright then, let\u2019s dance.

After a few fights, it seemed that \u2018club\u2019-type weapons were more effective than \u2018bladed\u2019 ones, so I hunted them using the \u2018Wooden Club\u2019 that dropped from the wolves.[EXP acquired.][8 Coins acquired.]After hunting for about one hour, we rested in a nearby convenience store before continuing.[Level increased.][Current level: 11]Finally, my level went up.\u2018I really did become level 11.\u2019I broke the level cap of 10. That it was at all possible to reach level 11 in the Tutorial Field was something that even I, a rote memorizer of the Ten Years\u2019 History, hadn\u2019t known at all. I guessed even the Fist King So Yoohyun didn\u2019t know it.The notices continued.[Congratulations!][You are the first to have reached level 11.][Your achievement has been recognized.][You have been granted the title \u2018The First Pioneer\u2019.]I could only doubt my ears.\u2018A title?\u2019There were \u2018titles\u2019 in the System.

Other than Tutorial Ender?\u2019I\u2019d never heard or seen of such a thing. A \u2018title\u2019 could only be gained at around level 30, and even then it wasn\u2019t guaranteed. I killed the Tutorial Field\u2019s miniboss monster, the \u2018Goblin Soldier\u2019, and still didn\u2019t get a title. So I was stunned I got a title just by reaching level 11.\u201cDid you get a title?\u201dGod, she scared me. Senia suddenly appeared behind me.

Find that out!\u201d\u201cI did get a title.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of title?\u201dSenia asked with an impressive nonchalance, but her expression was extremely stiff.

There was no need to expose everything to the Guardians. I had to hide an appropriate amount, choosing and picking what I would reveal.\u2018I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s a 20% buff to EXP.\u2019A boost that big made it a title of the highest level. In particular, an experience buff in the beginning would have a huge butterfly effect that would aid me later, because it would help me get firsts in everything.\u2018If I can keep developing like this\u2026\u2019I could really become a Ranker.

And even if it wasn\u2019t as grand as those things, I could definitely succeed enough to feed and clothe my family very well.\u2018No.\u2019Before, in order to succeed, the only option was to study like all the others to become a civil servant. But now, it was different. I could forge a different path from the past.I said to Sunhwa, \u201cLet\u2019s keep hunting. We\u2019ll level up for another two days or so.\u201d* * *\u201cHiya!\u201dYoohyun punched.Arf!The city wolf yelped.[Level increased.][Current level: 8]Yoohyun rubbed his nose.

So Yoohyun had realized many things over the last five days. He leveled up faster than others. He was stronger than others. He didn\u2019t know why, but it was true.There were hardly any monsters that could survive his one and only skill, \u2018Power Fist\u2019. As a result, quite a lot of people trailed behind So Yoohyun. Those people thought they\u2019d grabbed a real lifeline. Roughly ten people were following him.\u201cYou\u2019re indeed incredible.\u201d\u201cDo you think so?\u201d\u201cOf course. So Yoohyun is the strongest on the Tutorial Field, no?\u201d\u201cPshaw. I\u2019m not that great.\u201dEveryone could see it. Even though he was saying \u2018not at all!\u2019 and acting humble, So Yoohyun\u2019s earlobes were a bit red. He was definitely a bit embarrassed right now. At first sight, he looked like a regular ol\u2019 moron, but his body was quivering with muscles that were anything but ordinary. However, at that moment, So Yoohyun saw someone in the distance.\u201cHuh?\u201dIn the vicinity of Cheonggyecheon, where they were, he saw another team hunting \u2018city wolves\u2019, made up of a young man and girl. The child was taking the tanker role, while the man was handling the DPS.\u201cThere are more survivors!\u201dSo Yoohyun swiftly strode that way.\u201cHello!\u201dHaving just finished hunting the city wolves, Kim Hyukjin stared at So Yoohyun. He was able to recognize the man instantly.\u2018The Fist King\u2019.It was the Fist King So Yoohyun. Hyukjin was meeting him in person. Many people were following So Yoohyun\u2014it seemed he had rescued them all, unlike Hyukjin, who had turned away many people.\u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m seeing the Fist King in person.\u2019He was one of the eight most famous Players in Korea. He looked to be about 190 centimetres tall and had a very bulky physique, but his eyes looked very honest and simple. The dark circles under his eyes gave him a big panda image.After a short conversation, So Yoohyun made a proposal.\u201cWould you like to work with us? Survivors should clump together, right? What do you think?\u201dKim Hyukjin looked So Yoohyun straight in the eyes.\u2018If everything goes the way I saw in the past\u2026\u2019All of the people behind him would die. The only person who survived hunting\u00a0that thing\u00a0on the 2nd floor of Gwanghwamun D-Tower was So Yoohyun. According to So Yoohyun\u2019s reminiscing, he said the thing he regretted most was taking those people to the 2nd floor of D-Tower.\u201cNo thanks.\u201dHyukjin refused So Yoohyun\u2019s offer. He had no intention of hunting\u00a0that thing. It was far more dangerous than the Goblin Soldier, and there was a high chance he would die. This was such a rare chance. He couldn\u2019t let it go to waste in vain.Continuing, Hyukjin said, \u201cI heard the Tutorial Field will end after surviving for seven days.\u201dHis #1 goal was to earn $1 million, and for that reason, he had to survive the Tutorial Field. There was no need to face excessive danger in order to defeat the Tutorial Field\u2019s boss monster. The moment he killed the Goblin Soldier, the \u2018attacks\u2019 or \u2018waves\u2019 ceased for good, which meant there was absolutely no need to flirt with death.\u201cMm. No helping it then,\u201d said So Yoohyun.Yoohyun didn\u2019t dwell on it or insist. His personality had always been like that. No matter what happened, he simply accepted it for what it was. However, the people following him thought that Kim Hyukjin was a little rude.\u2018He must not know So Yoohyun\u2019s strength yet\u2026\u2019\u2018Tsk, tsk. He just kicked away a good offer with his own two feet.\u2019It looked like the pair was pretty skilled themselves, but they didn\u2019t think they had anything on So Yoohyun, who had the power to kill a city wolf in one hit.\u2018Can\u2019t be helped. He\u2019s simply throwing away his own fortune.\u2019They didn\u2019t openly show their discomfort on their faces, but it was palpable to Kim Hyukjin. He said, \u201cSurvive. I wish you good fortune. If you meet a truly powerful monster and are in a truly hopeless situation\u2026 Aim for the left eye.\u201dSo Yoohyun would walk his path, and he would walk his. He just had to think about how to get out of here in one piece. History would continue on its path. And within that prescribed path, Kim Hyukjin would secure as much profit as he could.He continued to hunt wolf packs.[\u2018Mutant Wolf\u2019s Fang\u2019 acquired.][Level increased.][Current level: 12]With the \u2018First Pioneer\u2019 title EXP buff in addition to his original leveling speed, he leveled up much faster than expected.

As time went on, he learned some tricks to hunting and was able to hunt faster than the wolves respawned.\u2018We\u2019ve caught all the wolves in this area.\u2019The wolves had run dry.

    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: The Tutorial\u2019s Hidden Piece (2)[You have fulfilled the conditions for the Hidden Piece.]Was there always a Hidden Piece in the Tutorial Field? Not that I was aware of. Even the man who had taken the lead in clearing the Tutorial Field, So Yoohyun, hadn\u2019t said anything about a Hidden Piece, nor had any other survivor. In other words, I was the first person to discover it.\u2018It\u2019s not necessarily something to be happy about.\u2019The Hidden Piece reward was sure to be big. But it came with just as much liability for risk. Moreover, this \u2018Hidden Piece\u2019 wasn\u2019t something I knew about, so it was an unknown risk.The notices continued.[The King of the Wolves, a lycanthrope, has appeared.]\u2018What?\u2019I urgently yanked Sunhwa\u2019s hand.\u201cSunhwa. Run!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSunhwa was taken aback, but she nodded, starting to run, as if determined not to lose track of me.[The King of the Wolves, a lycanthrope, is enraged.]The bodies of \u2018city wolves\u2019 were littered all around it. That was probably the reason for the lycanthrope\u2019s rage.\u2018Why is a lycanthrope showing up in a Tutorial Field?!\u2019The lycanthrope, simply put, was a humanoid wolf that ran around on two feet. Its level was normally around the 20~25 range. It wasn\u2019t a monster that should appear in the Tutorial. In terms of just physical ability, it was toe-to-toe with the monster on the 2nd floor of the D-Tower. Actually, just looking at the attack power, there was a chance it was even more powerful than\u00a0him.\u2018Dammit.\u2019With just Sunhwa and I, we couldn\u2019t defeat the lycanthrope.\u201cSunhwa. You hide behind that car over there.\u201d\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\u201cHurry!\u201dI pushed Sunhwa away, eyeing the distance. Whether it was survival instinct or a rational thought process doing whatever it had to do to survive, I couldn\u2019t say. I finished making my decision.\u2018It\u2019s all or nothing.\u2019The lycanthrope was fast.\u2018In any case, I can\u2019t run.\u2019The lycanthrope was already looking this way, meaning it had already targeted us. Even if I ran with all my might, I would probably be caught in five seconds. Hiding behind the car I pointed out, Sunhwa trembled.\u2018Sunhwa won\u2019t be able to defend herself from the attack of an animal-type monster over level 20 yet.\u2019The lycanthrope\u2019s teeth and claws were sharp, incomparable to the knives of a baby goblin. I took a deep breath.[Your heartbeat is rising excessively.][\u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 is taking effect.]Calm Observer\u2019s Eye kicked in as usual.\u2018Control the mind.\u2019Stay calm, I urged myself. I took in another big breath, then used one of the items in my Inventory.[High Strength Elixir]The Courageous Lion King\u2019s gift. An Open Beta Bonus, it will take effect for ten minutes.Temporarily increases Strength by 6.The effect of the High Strength Elixir was like 3 level ups.\u201cCome at me, you shitty dog!\u201dI couldn\u2019t defeat it with the High Strength Elixir alone. I was well aware of that, but it wasn\u2019t as if the situation was completely hopeless.* * *A distance away, Kang Sunhwa could only watch the wolf-human through the car window in horror.\u2018It\u2019s so different.\u2019So much that it felt like a creature in a completely different dimension from all the other monsters she had seen so far.Lycanthrope LVL?She clearly saw red letters above the lycanthrope\u2019s head. Even its name looked extremely dangerous. It was like the System was screaming at her that he was a monster she couldn\u2019t yet face.\u2018Oppa\u2026!\u2019She didn\u2019t have a clue about what he was planning to do.\u2018I beg you. I beg you, God. Please, help us.\u2019Even though her mom had abandoned her and run away, Sunhwa still wanted to see her. She wanted to live.\u2018I\u2019ll be good. I\u2019ll study hard.\u2019But just then, she heard Kim Hyukjin yell something.\u201cCome at me, you shitty dog!\u201dIt was as if the sky darkened. Whatever oppa was thinking, that shout at least succeeded spectacularly in irritating the lycanthrope more than any effect of Sunhwa\u2019s \u2018Taunt\u2019 skill could.Awoooooooo\u2013!The lycanthrope howled.[Howl has taken physical effect.][The abnormal status Paralyzation has taken effect.]Kang Sunhwa fell to her knees with a thump.She trembled, and her teeth clattered together, completely at the mercy of the lycanthrope\u2019s howl. The lycanthrope went from two legs to all four and began to run like a wolf.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *\u2018It\u2019s too fast!\u2019The 2-meter large, muscular monster sprang forward, instantaneously drawing near. I felt sweat run down my back.\u2018How can it be so fast despite being so big?\u2019I had seen it often on Youtube, but seeing it on the screen and experiencing it in person were two different things.I counted in my head.\u20183.\u2019The lycanthrope was right in front of me, just five meters away, a distance so short it could be traversed in the blink of an eye.\u20182.\u2019The lycanthrope\u2019s golden eyes glowed brightly. They were the eyes of a predator eyeing its prey, and those glowing orbs were fixed directly on me.\u20181.\u2019I clenched my fists hard.\u2018Now.\u2019The lycanthrope jumped into the air. I instantly rolled forward, just one rotation. I only imagined the movement, but my body followed through more fluidly than expected.Meanwhile, the lycanthrope was high in the air.\u2018Its first attack is always a jump.\u2019I made use of that habit. A few seconds was a short period, but I used every second.\u2018And then\u2014\u2019As if planning on making use of explosive strength, the lycanthrope\u2019s leg muscles expanded.I saw it all in my mind. The lycanthrope would shoot forward towards me as soon as it landed.\u2018Now!\u2019I took out the item in my Inventory.\u2018Aim for where those feet shadows are forming.\u2019My eyes flicked towards that spot, every movement as natural as if I had experienced and learned all of this before. Then, I raised the reward I had coerced from Senia.[Quality Lubricant]Good quality lubrication oil. It can sharpen the blade of an item with an edge, or be applied to a part that requires lubrication.I splashed the lubricant on the ground, and in the very next moment, the lycanthrope landed.\u2018Now!\u2019I threw myself at the lycanthrope, pushing the beast with all of my strength.Sliiiide!It slid backwards, losing its balance, and fell into the Cheonggyecheon River.\u2018I-I did it!\u2019This was the Cheonggyecheon district.\u2018He\u2019s in.\u2019And the lycanthrope fell into the river flowing through it.Aroo?The lycanthrope proceeded to produce sounds that didn\u2019t match its threatening aura, yelping like a drowning puppy.The \u2018Great Explorer Jackson\u2019 said the following about this method: \u201cAny low-level Players who attempt this method might need to be prepared to lose their life. However, this is also the only method that would, if successfully done, allow a low-level Player to kill a lycanthrope.\u201d\u2018It really worked?\u2019The only method available to me was to dunk the lycanthrope into water. Method aside, I successfully achieved that. It had only been made possible by the geographical location, Cheonggyecheon, the \u2018Quality Lubricant\u2019 item, and perfect timing.\u2018I really\u2026 did it.\u2019It was simply unbelievable. Even I, myself, was stunned. I carried it out on the small possibility it might work, but it actually did. In all actuality, a war between logic and instinct had raged within me just now. My logic said, \u2018You\u2019ll never win\u2019, but my instinct said, \u2018You can win\u2019.\u2018It was definitely dangerous, but\u2026\u2019Strangely enough\u2026\u2018It was easier than expected.\u2019If you broke it down, drowning the lycanthrope was absolutely not easy to do. Everything had to line up perfectly in order for it to work. Even a well-trained Player would be hard-pressed to break the lycanthrope\u2019s balance and push it into the river with such precise timing.The gap between my logic and instinct was simply too big. Strangely, it felt far too easy compared to the difficulty.\u201cO-Oppa. Are you alright?\u201dSunhwa approached me, looking down upon hearing the yelping from the water.\u201cI-Is that the lycanthrope?\u201dLycanthrope LVL?It was indeed the lycanthrope, but it had become so much smaller, smaller than a city wolf. It was like a puppy. I walked down the bank and killed the lycanthrope as easily as if I were facing a city wolf. Weakened and turned tiny by the water, the lycanthrope was a breeze to kill, and I finished it off with his Iron Sword. It couldn\u2019t even move, much less resist.\u2018I really killed it.\u2019I killed a lycanthrope, a monster over twice my level.\u2018I saw it.\u2019Everything had played out before me, showing me exactly how I should move. It was as natural as if someone were showing me, as natural as breathing.After killing it, I was absolutely certain.\u2018I\u2019m sure of it. This is the influence of talent.\u2019Talent, that innate value that one was born with and could not be attained by any amount of effort. I had it, although I still couldn\u2019t rule out the possibility that I might be an early bloomer Player.\u2018In any case, I survived.\u2019I had certainly escaped the jaws of death. Sunhwa came closer and expressed her admiration.\u201cOppa. You didn\u2019t do any kind of martial arts before, right?\u201dI hadn\u2019t had time for something like that.\u201cIt was like a movie or something. How did you pull that off?\u201d\u201cDid I look a bit cool?\u201d\u201cNot just a bit, a lot cool.\u201dSunhwa looked more excited than the person who dealt the finishing blow. She was like, \u201cYou went whee\u201d and then \u201ckasham\u201d and then \u201cwhoosh!\u201d\u2018This is reality.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a dream. I, an eternal civil servant student, killed a lycanthrope. With my own two hands. My level instantly went up.[You have killed a \u2018lycanthrope\u2019.][Level increased.][30 Coins acquired.][Current level: 13]\u2018A level up, already?\u2019It didn\u2019t end there.[Level increased.][Current level: 14][Level increased.][Current level: 15]I went up a whopping three levels in one go.[You have successfully hunted the Hidden Piece monster, \u2018lycanthrope\u2019.][You are bestowed the Hidden Piece reward, the \u2018Excellent Hunter\u2019 title.]Even before Hyukjin could check his new title properly, yet another notice came in.[The \u2018Courageous Lion King snorts in disdain at your cowardly tricks.]That meant the jerk was still in Senia\u2019s channel. I laughed inwardly. It looked like the Courageous Lion King was still gawking at me. However, the notices of other Guardians came in as well.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is shocked by your combat sense.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 hopes to sponsor you.][+1200 Coin]The Nameless Observer sent in 1200 Coins, and\u2014[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is in awe of your spirit of sacrifice.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 hopes to sponsor you.][+700 Coin]\u2014the Lady of the Scales sent in 700 Coins. By spirit of sacrifice, she probably was referring to how it ended up looking like I protected Sunhwa with my life on the line. It was a bit off the mark, but who cared? As long as the result was good, it was fine. In any case, I acquired 1,900 Coins in a matter of moments.\u20181900 Coins\u2026!\u2019Currently, the Tutorial was still underway. Before the battle, I was only level 13 and had about 6,000 Coins. But with the gifts from the Guardians, I got a lump sum of 1,900 Coins in one fell swoop.\u2018Which means, my Coins amount to\u2026\u2019I booted up my Inventory Window and looked at the number at the very bottom.[Held Coins: 7,942]I had earned nearly 8,000 Coins, and all in the Tutorial. I was now level 15, with almost eight grand in Coins. I achieved something that no theory or strategy ten years in the future had ever imagined.\u2018Plus.\u2019That wasn\u2019t all. Something truly important was next.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: D-Tower 2nd Floor\u2018Level 15.\u2019From level 15 onwards, it was possible to use the \u2018Item Shop\u2019. Sure enough, I got a notice telling me that.[You can now use the Item Shop.][The Item Shop is Tutorial-Grade.][The Tutorial-Grade Item Shop can be used through an \u2018Intermediate Administrator\u2019.]Intermediate Administrator was System lingo for what we called Streamer, so Senia. She had been continuously trailing me, observing me the whole time, just as I wanted. It was because I made for pretty great quality material.\u201cSenia.\u201dSenia appeared, seemingly knowing why I called her.\u201cI will give you an explanation of the Item Shop.\u201dOriginally, the Shop hadn\u2019t been opened in the Tutorial, so even though I was already very familiar with it, I decided to listen to Senia\u2019s explanation anyway.\u201cWe are currently in the Tutorial Field. The Item Shop\u2019s grade has been set to \u2018Tutorial\u2019, and as such, only four items can be purchased.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t anything all that special in her explanation. I opened up the Item Shop.[Item Shop \u2013 Tutorial-Grade]Low Constitution Potion\u00a0100 CoinsLow Mana Potion\u00a0100 CoinsLow Cure Potion\u00a0200 CoinsLow Safe Zone Return Scroll\u00a03000 CoinsLike Senia said, the Tutorial-grade Item Shop had a lot of limitations.\u2018There are only four things I can buy, but\u2026\u2019In the Tutorial, this was already plenty. Plus, I had 8,000 Coins in my possession.\u201cI ask Player Kim Hyukjin once again. Do you really not have a True Name?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201dI didn\u2019t even know what a True Name was. At my response, Senia\u2019s wings trembled again. She was as expressionless as ever, but when she spoke to me again, her voice was at least half a pitch higher.\u201cI am not very curious about it either.\u201dIt looked like she was lying through her teeth and was actually very curious, but I didn\u2019t pay much attention to her. I looked once again in the direction the Fist King, So Yoohyun, and the others had gone. At the end of that path was the D-Tower.\u2018If I have these\u2026\u2019With the potions, it was doable. I didn\u2019t have to use the level up trick like I did when hunting the miniboss, the Goblin Soldier, because I could definitely handle it by using the Constitution and Cure Potions.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t checked the Excellent Hunter title.\u201dThere could only be one reason why she was saying such a thing. She wanted to make it public to the Guardians. She wanted to tell them the Player she was broadcasting earned this and that kind of title, by doing A, B, C.\u00a0 I was sure the Guardians were also on the edge of their seats.\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll check it now.\u201d\u201cWill you check the Excellent Hunter title?\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019ll do it on my own.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia\u2019s face was as flat as usual.\u201cYou don\u2019t look so happy? Did you think I would open up a public window and let you take a look?\u201d\u201cAs I have emphasized time and time again, I am not curious about you in the least.\u201dAfter saying so, Senia returned to her opaque state, as if to say she wouldn\u2019t meddle with me anymore.\u2018She\u2019s a total newb.\u2019I saw how cleverly the Streamers handled Rankers ten years later, and in my eyes, Senia seemed like a true beginner of beginners. In other words\u2026\u2018She\u2019s easy for me to handle.\u2019It was good for me. To become an \u2018amazing Player\u2019, it would be best not to publicize my information to the Guardians too much. It was most advantageous for the Player to maintain a certain level of mystery. That would stimulate the curiosity of the Guardians, and it was my job right now to slowly sate their desire.\u2018Let\u2019s see here.\u2019What kind of title did I get from killing the Hidden Monster, a lycanthrope, that appeared on the Hidden Field? Normally, it was an impossible monster for someone of my level to hunt. I turned my attention to checking what kind of reward I had received from it.\u2018Check.\u2019I opened the title description.[Excellent Hunter]A special title only given on the Tutorial Field.Applies only to creatures recognized by the System as \u2018non-sentient beings\u2019.20% additional damage.+10% movement speed.Ability to use the skill \u2018Hunter\u2019s Strike\u2019\u2014a low chance to ignore the prey\u2019s unique trait.\u2018Non-sentient beings means\u2026\u2019That would include the lycanthrope I had just hunted, the city wolves, the city foxes, and other monsters of that nature. Goblins probably fell under the umbrella as well. It applied to most low-level monsters.\u2018It\u2019ll definitely be good in the lower-level period.\u2019Most sentient monsters were high-level and tricky to fight. That meant it would be a long time before I came in contact with them, and in the lower-level period, this title would be extremely useful.\u2018Can\u2019t believe I got two titles in the Tutorial.\u2019It was a boon I hadn\u2019t even dreamt of. That was something no one in the past had ever achieved. Even the Fist King So Yoohyun only ever got the \u2018Tutorial Ender\u2019 title.\u2018I even got a skill.\u2019The skill came with an additional effect.\u2018A low chance to ignore the prey\u2019s unique trait.\u2019This was pretty good in its own way, too, though it was unfortunate it was only a \u2018low chance\u2019. Whenever a monster had some kind of unique defense ability, I could pierce through it.After hunting the lycanthrope, I was lost in thought for a moment. It was obscured by buildings, but it felt like I could see it clearly\u2014the D-Tower.\u201cSunhwa.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to D-Tower.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the place where we killed the Goblin Soldier, right? The Tutorial Dungeon.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dTo be precise, we were heading to the 2nd floor of the D-Tower. So Yoohyun and his group had likely already gone that way. By now\u2026\u2018They\u2019re probably looking around the 1st floor.\u2019I didn\u2019t think they had gone up to the 2nd floor yet.\u201cOppa, are you thinking about the 2nd floor over there?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYou said it was extremely dangerous.\u201dThat was definitely true. That thing on the 2nd floor wasn\u2019t something that could be hunted by normal means. Even the Fist King So Yoohyun said later that going in there was the thing he regretted most.\u201cThink about when we first met.\u201dThe very first time we had met, this child was hardly a match for a baby goblin. All she could do was beg for help, shaking in fear.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t even been one week, but what do you think will happen if you meet a baby goblin now?\u201dEven if a goblin swarm were to appear, with this kid\u2019s physical ability, she would be fine. Sunhwa quickly picked up on what I was trying to say.\u201cThat oppa has become that much stronger? Way more than you expected?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t respond. At that, Sunhwa crossed her arms and nodded, her expression incredibly serious. Then, she mumbled like a sage who had uncovered all of the hidden truths and principles of the world. \u201cFigures, oppa is an outstanding ultra genius, after all.\u201d\u201cRight. I\u2019m also a little confused.\u201dBy my original standards, Sunhwa was the real genius, but it seemed like I was even more of a genius than her. Or rather, considering the current situation, that was a fact.I thought of the D-Tower, the 2nd floor.\u2018There\u2019s no chance of winning with a direct confrontation.\u2019But there were also no tricks that worked on it, like with the lycanthrope. It was actually a very tricky opponent. That was why I wanted to avoid it, if at all possible, but the situation had changed. I knew that monster very well, and I came to the conclusion that with my current skills, I could definitely kill it.\u2018I have a plan.\u2019I outlined the plan from start to finish in my head. It would be a lie to say it wouldn\u2019t be dangerous, but\u2026\u2018I can definitely do it.\u2019I could do it. I had the confidence to make it happen.\u2018No. I\u00a0want\u00a0to make it happen.\u2019The desire to accomplish and succeed was growing and swirling within my chest, a feeling that was almost a first for me in my entire life. During my days as a civil servant student, I didn\u2019t feel anything like this. One thing was for sure\u2014the current me was different from the past me.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come if you don\u2019t want to. Go to a Safe Zone and hide.\u201dIf everything went as planned, as I imagined, I would go far beyond simply surviving the Tutorial and would be able to gain something far greater.How many times had I seized such opportunities in my life? Never.I hadn\u2019t had any opportunities. My mom passed early, my sister became sick with leukemia, and I was stuck being a civil servant.But now, it was time for me to seize my chance.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *So Yoohyun\u2019s group entered the D-Tower and heard the notice saying it was the Tutorial Dungeon. At the word \u2018dungeon\u2019, So Yoohyun brought his guard up.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? There\u2019s nothing here?\u201d\u201cYeah, I was nervous for nothing.\u201dThey flattered themselves for having adapted fairly well to the System.\u201cBut it\u2019s a tutorial anyway, right? How strong could something possibly be?\u201dMeanwhile, So Yoohyun discovered something.\u2018That\u2019s\u2026\u2019He approached an ATM. The ATM screen had been completely torn apart. It looked like something with tremendous torque had punched through it.\u2018What the heck could it have been? I haven\u2019t seen such destructive force outside.\u2019Goosebumps rose on his arms. That was how terrifying the destructive force appeared to be.\u2018Not even I could have survived that.\u2019 So Yoohyun had a hunch. \u2018Someone\u2026 was already here.\u2019He believed someone had come here, cleared it, and left. At least the 1st floor, that is.\u2018Who could it have been?\u2019For some reason, one person appeared in his mind. He recalled that man with the powerful presence, the man who had been with the young girl. Why that was the case, he didn\u2019t know, but that was the face that came to mind. That very ordinary-looking person had left a strong impression on Yoohyun.Just then, someone shouted, \u201cOver here! You can click the escalator over here!\u201dIt was like an RPG game. It went without saying that it wasn\u2019t like moving your mouse to actually click on a button. Looking at the escalator with your eyes was enough to know that it was a clickable \u2018object\u2019.[Escalator Going to the 2nd Floor]An escalator going to the Main Field of D-Tower, the 2nd Floor. Can transport fifteen people at once.Cooldown: Twenty minutesSeveral people buzzed in excitement.\u201cWhat should we do? Should we try going up to the 2nd floor?\u201dThese people had already felt that Playing was rather fun. In other words, they were people with the right personality to become \u2018Rankers\u2019. Someone who didn\u2019t think Playing was fun could not become a Ranker. After all, thinking of Playing in that way was a type of talent in itself. They felt themselves grow hot with excitement.\u201cWon\u2019t it be dangerous?\u201d\u201cOther than the 1st and 2nd waves, it wasn\u2019t that dangerous.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s still a dungeon\u2026 and the Tutorial Field will end in a little bit. I have the feeling we shouldn\u2019t overdo it\u2026\u201dSo Yoohyun fell into deep contemplation.\u2018Do we have to go up?\u2019If surviving was his goal, then it would probably be fine to stay here. Did they really have to raid the 2nd floor? It also seemed like monsters didn\u2019t really respawn here, making it a comparatively safe place.\u201cWhat do you think, Mr. So Yoohyun?\u201dJust then, he heard a notice.[The Tutorial Field will be open for 24 more hours.]For some unknown reason, the contents of the quest were altered.[The contents of the Tutorial Quest have been altered.][If Players fail to clear the Tutorial Dungeon, all people within the Tutorial Field will die.]This was a \u2018Tutorial Field-wide notice\u2019.

Well, with you around, everything\u2019ll die in one hit.\u201dEveryone other than So Yoohyun was full of confidence. They activated the escalator heading to the 2nd floor.Completely unaware of what was waiting for them, they teleported to the \u2018Tutorial Dungeon 2nd Floor Raid\u2019 that the Fist King So Yoohyun would later consider his \u2018greatest regret\u2019.* * *A few minutes priorWe saw the D-Tower in the distance.\u201cWe ended up coming back,\u201d she said.Kang Sunhwa had followed before, saying,\u00a0\u201cI just want to Play.

However\u2014\u2018Me being here is also different.\u2019Two people who hadn\u2019t existed in the events from ten years ago were here.

    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: D-Tower 2nd Floor (2)Sung Minchul considered meeting So Yoohyun to be his life\u2019s greatest fortune. In his eyes, So Yoohyun had an enormous talent for \u2018Playing\u2019. To put it in other words, he was a genius.[Let me help you. Come with me.]The sight of the good natured-looking Yoohyun saving him from getting eaten by a goblin was still vivid in his mind. Among the Players, So Yoohyun was simply overwhelming. If he stayed with this person, he would probably be able to, at the very least, survive this \u2018strange phenomenon\u2019. Sung Minchul didn\u2019t doubt for a moment that this \u2018Tutorial Field\u2019 was a field set up for So Yoohyun.However, the situation changed a little. Not far away, he saw a green mass of muscle, named a \u2018Magic Troll\u2019.Magic Troll LVL ?Its name was red, and its level wasn\u2019t even indicated.Uohhhhhh!The magic troll swung its huge fist.\u201cArgh!\u201dSo Yoohyun tried to block it, but the situation wasn\u2019t looking too good. From the way his left arm dangled afterwards, it looked like his shoulder was dislocated.\u201cHah! Haah! Haah!\u201dSo Yoohyun looked exhausted. Sung Minchul barely managed to sit up, blood dripping from his mouth. Next to him were people who had died in one hit of that fist. Whether they had fainted, or died, he wasn\u2019t sure, but they were most likely dead. He didn\u2019t have the luxury of checking. In any case, the only people who still had their heads on straight were Minchul himself and So Yoohyun.Minchul wiped the blood from his lips with his sleeve.\u201cDammit\u2026\u201dHe had a feeling\u2026 that he would die here. If, by some chance, someone were to get out of this place alive, it wouldn\u2019t be him. It wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t consider running away, but\u2026[The Boss Zone has not been deactivated.][Fleeing the Boss Zone is only possible for ten seconds after entry.][You cannot flee.]He couldn\u2019t flee.\u2018I might\u2026 die here.\u2019No, there was a high chance he would die here.\u2018I\u2019m going to die.\u2019Fear swelled within him. He truly regretted his bravado before coming to the 2nd floor.So Yoohyun\u2019s right fist glowed blue.\u201cAahhhhhh!\u201dHe punched out, hitting the green monster, the \u2018troll\u2019, squarely in the side. That fist that had smashed every monster up until now had no effect this time.There was a resounding impact, but the troll merely frowned a little.\u2018Dammit!\u2019Even So Yoohyun felt like he was fighting a massive wall. But just then, he heard another notice.[New Players are entering.][There is no maximum Player limit.][Fleeing the Boss Zone is only possible for ten seconds after entry.]Minchul and Yoohyun turned to look at the escalator at the same time. Minchul cried out, \u201cRun!\u201dTen seconds. They only had ten seconds left.\u201cYou can still run within ten seconds!\u201dIf they didn\u2019t go back on the escalator within ten seconds, they would be trapped here. He saw a young girl, a child in her early teens at best. Suddenly, tears welled up in his eyes.\u2018Mina.\u2019He had a daughter exactly around that age. She had just become a middle school student. His daughter\u2019s face came to mind and seemed to overlap with the face of the girl he saw.\u00a0It would be great if that child didn\u2019t die,\u00a0he thought.\u00a0She\u2019s not my daughter, but it would be great if she lived.\u00a0It would be great if she didn\u2019t come here. Because if she did, the only thing that awaited her was a brutal death.\u201cThis guy can never, ever be killed, so hurry and get out of here!\u201dWhether they heard his words or not, the two people walked over from the escalator not far into the distance.\u201cPlease! Please, run. Can\u2019t you hear me? Don\u2019t you see this crazy monster?!\u201dHe had walked over here just as gallantly, thinking that no matter how strong the monster might look, it was still the Tutorial Field, a\u00a0tutorial,\u00a0and they had So Yoohyun. Because he was with a person who had been born to Play. That conceit had been shattered in just one minute. It was obvious that the same would happen to the newcomers.\u201cDon\u2019t be reckless and go back! It\u2019s too dangerous!\u201dPlease go back. Don\u2019t come to this harsh place and die.Crash!The sound of impact rang out. It was the sound of So Yoohyun getting hit. Taking the troll\u2019s fist to his head, Yoohyun fainted.Meanwhile, Kim Hyukjin came ever closer.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *\u201cI told you to aim for the left eye, didn\u2019t I?\u201dKim Hyukjin walked towards the troll, not too fast or too suddenly. Though the troll was that large, it was as fast as a lithe tiger. He walked slowly on purpose, judging it wouldn\u2019t be good to draw aggro while he still didn\u2019t have a good grasp on the situation.While he was walking, he heard a shout that was nearly a scream, but he ignored it. After coming closer, he saw the troll\u2019s information in his mind.Magic Troll LVL ?The name was written in red, indicating that it was absolutely not a monster Hyukjin could easily kill. In fact, it was likely a very difficult opponent.A little ways to the side, he saw So Yoohyun lying unconscious after getting hit in the head.\u2018It\u2019s a monster that can go up against the Fist King So Yoohyun.\u2019The troll was a monster with incredibly good vitality. It was also extremely resilient. Moreover, it happened to have a particularly high resistance to \u2018fist attacks\u2019. With the addition of the boss monster stat buff, the troll was definitely a tricky opponent, a boss monster that required you to stack on continuous damage with frontal methods.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is watching you.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is watching you.]It seemed even the Guardians thought the current Kim Hyukjin couldn\u2019t kill the troll. However, he didn\u2019t run. Instead, he continued to advance. The notices continued to stream in.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 has high hopes for you.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 marvels at your heroic appearance.]The Nameless Observer seemed to want to observe how Hyukjin would kill the troll, while the Lady of the Scales was more interested in how he would save the survivors here. The two Guardians wanted slightly different things, but in any case, there was no mistake that Hyukjin had to defeat the troll.He pulled out the \u2018Iron Sword\u2019 and checked his \u2018slots\u2019.\u2018I memorized how to use them.\u2019If he used the slots, he didn\u2019t have to physically drink the potions. Items moved to his slots could be used immediately simply by willing it. It was like a keyboard shortcut in a game.\u2018I\u2019m all ready to go.\u2019He was scared. Originally, he would have never come into this place. But now, he had the \u2018Item Shop\u2019. He had potions.\u2018Besides its enormous resilience, its actual attack power isn\u2019t that high.\u2019The fact most of So Yoohyun\u2019s group was still alive was proof of that. They were scattered on the ground, almost all of them unconscious. It lacked the intelligence to check whether the people were dead or not.The troll could be defined as such: a dumb monster with strong resilience and constitution.Kim Hyukjin said, \u201cSunhwa. Those people aren\u2019t dead yet. They\u2019re not corpses.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dSunhwa flinched in surprise. Her face flushed a bit.\u201cI-I didn\u2019t think they were dead. Really. I wasn\u2019t thinking bad thoughts.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. Put this in their mouths.\u201dHe handed her recovery potions, which he had stocked up from the Item Shop. With these, they would be out of the woods for the time being. It was the final act of conscience he could offer after having turned away from so many people. He didn\u2019t intend to die for them, but he could still save them from dying.\u2018This is all I can do for them.\u2019Getting out of here alive was their responsibility.\u201cIf they happen to regain consciousness, be sure to tell them not to move and just stay still. Tell them not to attack,\u201d he added.\u201cGot it.\u201dAfter Kim Hyukjin thought he had done everything he could, he looked forward again.Magic Troll LVL ?The monster that looked like the Hulk stared in Hyukjin\u2019s direction.\u2018The Fist King of the past managed to kill something like this.\u2019Of course, there were differences from the past and now. Other than So Yoohyun, everyone here had died. There was also a high chance that Yoohyun had been the one who had hunted the miniboss, the Goblin Soldier.\u2018As a result, the Tutorial\u2019s Fist King has become as much weaker as I have grown stronger.\u2019Which meant\u2014\u2018His current skills are lacking.\u2019Yoohyun was still unconscious. Hyukjin walked close, but not close enough to greatly provoke the troll.\u2018It has great resilience and moves quickly, but its attacking speed is slow.\u2019There wasn\u2019t any real strat. You had to slowly, steadily pile on the damage over a long period of time. That meant the challenger had to last a long time, too, something that was possible with potions.Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!The mass of muscle began to stomp its way over. It was fast.[The \u2018Excellent Hunter\u2019 title is taking effect.]Whoosh!Within mere moments, a huge fist came swinging his way. However, Hyukjin could follow that fist clearly with his eyes. He couldn\u2019t quite read the next movement or perfectly track its path, but\u2026\u2018I can see the trajectory.\u2019At the very least, at this moment, he could see exactly how that fist would swing.\u2018Duck my head.\u2019Whoosh\u2013!The magic troll\u2019s fist swept past the hairs on his head. As expected of its enormous size, the attack carried a certain degree of strength, but that meant nothing if it didn\u2019t land.Hyukjin thrust his sword into the troll\u2019s abdomen.\u2018It\u2019s not hitting.\u2019Just like how Hyukjin had read the troll\u2019s movements, the troll had read his as well. Their speeds were evenly matched, victor or loser not apparent to the eye. With the buff of the \u2018Excellent Hunter\u2019 title, their speeds were equal.\u2018Okay.\u2019He opened his Status Window.[Status Window]Name: Kim Hyukjin (Player)Level: 15Title: [Excellent Hunter] [First Pioneer]Strength: 17Intelligence: 17Agility: 17Perception: 17Constitution: 17Willpower: 17 (+30)Bonus stats: 2Random stats: 4Undistributed stats: 6He was level 15. Thanks to getting random stats for whatever reason, his stats were a far cry from a regular level 15 Player. A regular Player would have stats like these at level 20.\u20186 undistributed stats.\u2019When fighting the lycanthrope, he had used the \u2018High Strength Elixir\u2019. Back then, he physically experienced how big an effect \u2018+6\u2019 had.\u2018Put them all in Agility.\u2019The troll had high resilience, but its \u2018defense\u2019 wasn\u2019t actually so high that it couldn\u2019t take damage.[Agility increased.]\u2026\u2026[Agility increased.]Adding +6 to Agility, his current Agility was 23. As his Agility stat shot up, he felt his body grow lighter. He could see the troll\u2019s movements more precisely, and with his increased speed, Hyukjin began to gain the upper hand.Uooogh!The troll swung its fists. Hyukjin dodged and struck repeatedly, hunting the troll while continuously avoiding close calls. From afar, Sung Minchul stared in a daze.\u2018Even So Yoohyun was at its mercy, but\u2026\u2019A single person was fighting a monster that not just So Yoohyun, but all fifteen people who had come here, hadn\u2019t been able to touch. Though the fight looked so dicey it seemed as if the Player could be blown away at any moment, he was hunting the troll.\u2018He\u2019s soloing it?\u2019There\u2019s always someone better. That was what people said. Watching the scene before him now, Sung Minchul felt it was true.\u2018How can he be like that?\u2019They had been Playing for the same amount of time, so how could that man handle such a monster on his own?\u2018Is he\u2026 the real genius?\u2019His talent was so overwhelming it made even So Yoohyun, someone Minchul had thought of as a genius, look like an ordinary Joe. A cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me level of talent that relegated geniuses to normalcy. A kind of skill reaching a different world, a domain that couldn\u2019t be approached by any amount of effort. Minchul felt that the man he saw had that kind of talent, skill, and something more.At that moment, that was how the situation played out for Sung Minchul. One hour passed with him watching in awe.* * *Blood flowed from the troll\u2019s left eye. I breathed raggedly.\u201cHaah\u2026! Haah\u2026!\u201dThe troll was estimated to be level 25. With the boss monster stat buff, the constitution of the \u2018magic troll\u2019 was beyond imagination. Despite that, I didn\u2019t feel all that desperate.\u2018I can do this.\u2019While fighting the magic troll, I felt it again. The magic troll wasn\u2019t an impossible foe to hunt. For Players of the Tutorial level, it was considered as a foe that couldn\u2019t be soloed, but that wasn\u2019t true.\u2018I can definitely kill it.\u2019I could kill it normally, without any tricks. As I fought, I could certainly feel that I was most likely a genius.[Low Constitution Potion has been used.][Low Constitution Potion has been used.]Of course, I hadn\u2019t gotten to this point on talent and strategies alone. There was definitely some item abuse going on. \u2018Potion abuse\u2019, to be exact. I was only managing by chugging two potions in one go, but without potions, I would have really fallen over. But now, the end was nearing.Perhaps because they were suffering under the special ability of the \u2018magic troll\u2019, the people seemed to have no intention of stirring. They had been unconscious for one hour. If they at least woke up, if So Yoohyun at least woke up, he could help out a little, but it didn\u2019t matter\u2014it was almost over. The troll was as exhausted as I was.[The magic troll\u2019s \u2018regeneration power\u2019 has been used up.]The troll could no longer regenerate. That was the result of one hour of bloody fighting. Another ten minutes ticked past, and then I clenched the hilt of my sword.\u2018The final blow comes later.\u2019I had to wait. Right now, I had to bide my time. A little later, every piece of the puzzle would come together. The time was coming for me to put the final stroke on the picture.But just then, a kink occurred in my plans.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: This is When I\u2019m the Cheapest\u2018Gotta take my time with the final blow.\u2019I had to take my time killing the troll. According to the strategies I had seen, a delay of at least fifteen minutes was necessary. Otherwise, yet another change would occur in the troll.\u2018Let\u2019s put in one more hit and then wait.\u2019My Iron Sword was about to hit the troll\u2019s left eye, when\u2014[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 wishes to help you.]I instantly stilled, but it was already too late to draw back my sword. The tip of the Iron Sword went into the troll\u2019s left eye.[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 has gifted you \u2018Superb Superhuman Strength\u2019, and it has taken effect.][Due to \u2018Superb Superhuman Strength\u2019, the attack power of this attack has increased by 100%.]I instantly came to a conclusion.\u2018Dammit.\u2019There was no doubt that the damned Courageous Lion King had been waiting for this moment. He was probably snickering, [Now. Show me your courage.] If one day, I had the chance to beat a Guardian to death, that Guardian would be my first target.\u2018It\u2019s too late.\u2019What I had intended on being a light hit had become a finishing blow. I had dealt too powerful an attack without a delay. Now, the troll\u2019s counterattack would begin.Even before I retracted my sword, I made a decision.\u2018I have to run.\u2019Plunge!The Iron Sword plunged into the magic troll\u2019s left eye.Ting!And then, an arrow flew out of nowhere and embedded itself in the middle of the magic troll\u2019s forehead along with a triumphant \u201cI did it!\u201d* * *One of the guys that had been unconscious near the troll had fired an arrow. His name was Jang Hyunsoo. He had received a bow as his random weapon and was a pretty good hand at it. Actually, it had been quite a while since he regained consciousness.\u201cIf you come to, don\u2019t do anything and just stay still. That\u2019s what oppa said.\u201dJang Hyunsoo had heard those words. He had remained lying down in fear, because if he accidentally drew the troll\u2019s aggro, he would die. After praying for what seemed like an eternity for that man to somehow kill the troll, he opened his eyes to discover a shocking scene.\u2018What the hell? Holy shit. It\u2019s almost dead.\u2019A monster that even So Yoohyun couldn\u2019t kill was almost hunted by a man who didn\u2019t look all that special. Hyunsoo hadn\u2019t even imagined that there was a Player stronger than So Yoohyun.\u2018It\u2019s really almost over?\u2019Once this troll fell, the Tutorial would end. Once his desire to survive was satisfied, a different kind of greed began to bud within him.\u2018If I put in the finishing blow\u2026!\u2019There would be a lot of rewards for simply dealing the finishing hit. Even though he couldn\u2019t grab all the rewards, he thought he would be able to get at least half.\u2018I don\u2019t really need to stay still\u2026 just because that little girl told me to, right?\u2019He could just say he hadn\u2019t heard her. Or he could just say he helped that man with no consideration for his own life because it looked dangerous. There were plenty of excuses or justifications he could use.[You have used the skill \u2018Strengthened Arrow\u2019.]He let his arrow fly. The big troll made a large target, and he was lucky this time, managing to plant the arrow precisely in the middle of the troll\u2019s forehead.\u2018It\u2019s a success!\u2019He successfully dealt the final blow. The troll staggered. It seemed as though the Tutorial\u2019s boss monster, the \u2018magic troll\u2019, would disappear like that.\u2018I was the one who killed the boss monster! I killed it!\u2019It was possible he might become stronger than So Yoohyun. His heart began to thump.\u2018Reward! What\u2019s the reward?!\u2019A smile floated unbidden to his lips at the thought of the reward. He felt like he was getting a reward that matched all of his struggles up to this point. He had killed a\u00a0boss monster.Kim Hyukjin, who had run over, asked him a question.\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201dThe final blow wasn\u2019t the end. This man had made a mistake just now.\u201cI think you must have dealt the final blow just now.\u201dA change occurred in the magic troll. At the same time, notices began to stream in.\u201cIf you want to live, run. I can\u2019t save you.\u201dThe magic troll\u2019s gaze turned to Jang Hyunsoo.

I opened the emergency door and ran down the emergency stairs, heading for the 2nd underground floor. It was the \u2018Additional Safe Zone\u2019 only I had heard of, the \u2018D-Tower underground 2nd floor parking lot\u2019.But as we ran, the\u00a0thud thud thud thud!\u00a0of massive footsteps came from above. It almost sounded like a dinosaur.\u2018Shit!\u2019How was a creature two meters in size with that kind of bulk able to move so fast? It almost felt like an earthquake was shaking the stairs.\u2018We have to run faster.\u2019Apparently, it had finished its business on the 2nd floor, because it made a beeline for me. Currently, I was on the 1st underground floor. I dragged Sunhwa along. Sunhwa had extremely good resilience, but her constitution itself wasn\u2019t that great.\u201cRun faster!\u201dI gripped Sunhwa\u2019s thin wrist hard in one hand, starting to drag her down the stairs. She was tripping, but there was no time to pay any attention to that.\u2018She won\u2019t be hurt by this.\u2019Her body had been completely unhurt by a goblin\u2019s dagger. Even if I roughly towed her along, she wouldn\u2019t get any big injuries, just a few scratches, at the most. Ending up with a few scratches was way better than getting smashed to pieces by a berserking troll.Hah! Hah! Hah!I gasped for air.Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!The troll\u2019s footsteps sounded closer and closer, until I could even hear the growl of its breathing.\u2018Why\u2019s the 2nd underground floor so far?!\u2019I saw a sign saying we were heading towards the 2nd underground floor. I ran with all my strength towards that destination, the Safe Zone. And then, I saw the door going into the 2nd underground floor.It was a fire door, the type that could be opened by pushing the bar. I slammed my weight into it to open it, and as I did so, the magic troll was right on our tail.\u201cO-Oppa!\u201dThe berserking troll with only the whites of its eyes visible punched out.Crash!\u2018Shit.\u2019With the sound of an exploding bomb, the fire door crumpled like a piece of paper. I had survived by swiftly ducking, but if that fist had hit me, I would have flown to the heavens. My hair stood on end.\u2018Why the hell are there two layers of fire doors?!\u2019We had to open another one to go inside. Only then could we enter the 2nd underground floor parking lot. Somehow, the fire door felt impossibly heavy today. I pushed it open.I felt a shiver run down my back and knew. The troll was readying its fist again behind us. I couldn\u2019t describe it exactly, but I somehow knew. The back of my head was tingling.\u2018Definitely.\u2019Somehow,\u00a0somehow,\u00a0I felt it. I\u00a0saw\u00a0it, even without seeing it. The trajectory of its fist, and the end of its trajectory, were outlined in my head.[The System has recognized a critical situation.][Confirming that the situation aligns with the Tutorial Field Boss Monster\u2019s \u2018Unique Situation\u2019 and a \u2018Special Encounter\u2019.][Forcibly awakening your dormant talent, the \u2018Innate Ability\u2019 engraved in your body.]Special encounter. Dormant talent. Innate ability. I didn\u2019t hear any of it.[Innate Ability, \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019, has been forcibly activated.]I had no time to pay attention to that notice. However, \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019 vividly sketched out what was happening behind me in my head. I could see, without looking.The troll\u2019s swinging fist, where that fist would land, how fast it would travel\u2014everything was naturally laid out before me. How I should act to avoid that fist, what kind of movement I should show, it was all clear to me, as if I were someone who had been trained to perfection. The outcomes of ten different actions were all instantly sketched out in my head.And the result of that calculation was clear.\u2018I can\u2019t dodge.\u2019There was absolutely nowhere to evade. No matter how I moved, no matter how I dodged, no matter how I blocked, the result of each and every action was my death.I had a feeling.\u2018I\u2019m gonna die.\u2019The fear of death filled my head to the brim\u2026 for one moment. For a very short millisecond, what felt like a long time to me, my innate ability, \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019, loudly proclaimed my death.But then, a miracle occurred.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: This is When I\u2019m the Cheapest (2)Kang Sunhwa could definitely feel it.\u2018If I take that hit instead, I\u2019ll die.\u2019The chances of that happening were high. She didn\u2019t have Kim Hyukjin\u2019s \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019, but she was indeed a talent worthy of being called a \u2018genius\u2019. She could at least feel very clearly that if she took that attack, she could die.\u2018I have to block it.\u2019She didn\u2019t think about it for long. She merely thought that she could lose her life, not what would happen if she didn\u2019t or what she could gain by doing such a thing. She\u00a0had\u00a0to block it. If she didn\u2019t, Kim Hyukjin\u2019s head would be bashed in.\u2018I\u2019m going to block it!\u2019It wasn\u2019t a calculated action. She didn\u2019t stop to weigh the pros and cons. She was simply going to block it.\u2018I will!\u2019At that moment, all she thought about was protecting Hyukjin. And so, she extended her hand.[Using the skill Platinum Shield.]Clang!A clang as loud as two hollow aluminum baseball bats colliding burst out. It was the sound of the troll\u2019s meaty fist glancing off Kang Sunhwa\u2019s thin arm.[\u2018Platinum Shield\u2019 has detected an \u2018excessive physical force\u2019.][The skill Platinum Shield has evenly distributed the impact.]Sunhwa blocked the magic troll\u2019s fist with her thin arm. To be exact, she slightly redirected the fist\u2019s \u2018trajectory\u2019.She lost consciousness before she could even scream. Hyukjin didn\u2019t look behind him to see what happened. He had no time to do so. He just ran, hauling Sunhwa along while clenching his teeth.* * *\u2018Sunhwa used a new ability.\u2019I didn\u2019t know what it was, but it seemed like a Tutorial bonus, as well as a skill she hadn\u2019t used before.[You have escaped the \u2018crisis of death\u2019 while \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019 was in an active state.][You have overcome the \u2018death sentence\u2019 of \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019.][A condition for the fusion of \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019 has been fulfilled.]Even amidst my desperate scramble to flee, I came to a conclusion.\u2018It must be one of the beginner skills given by the Lady of the Scales.\u2019The Lady of the Scales happened to be watching the Intermediate Administrator \u2018Senia\u2019s\u2019 channel. That meant she was watching this scene just like the others. From that, I could guess what kind of ability had just blocked the magic troll\u2019s attack.\u2018Platinum Shield.\u2019Kang Sunhwa had protected him by using Platinum Shield.\u2018For a regular Player, even if they used Platinum Shield\u2026 no matter where they were hit, it would be instant death.\u2019It was because it was Sunhwa. Because it was Sunhwa, a girl whose talent for tanking exceeded genius. She was still at an age where her \u2018talent plates\u2019 had probably not yet bloomed, and yet despite that, she managed to block the magic troll\u2019s attack. This could only be seen as a miracle achieved by Sunhwa\u2019s talent.\u2018We\u2019re almost at the Safe Zone!\u2019The archer Player\u2019s helpful but also not helpful kill steal earned me some time, and Sunhwa\u2019s Platinum Shield earned me some more. To me, all of this was a miracle, a miracle that allowed me to leap over the Lion King\u2019s evil scheme.I displayed a burst of superhuman strength, dragging Sunhwa along.\u2018We just have to get past that glass door.\u2019Once we were past the glass door, it would be the \u2018parking lot\u2019 field, a place that was still valid as a Safe Zone. That was the Safe Zone only I had heard about. I hurled myself forward, Sunhwa in my embrace.The glass shattered, and I rolled on the ground, holding onto Sunhwa.[You have entered the extra Safe Zone, \u2018D-Tower Parking Lot 2nd Floor\u2019.]Kuooooogh!As if blocked by a transparent wall, the troll was unable to come in. Infuriated, it battered the invisible wall with its fists like crazy, but it wasn\u2019t at the level of a ruthless monster that could break through a Safe Zone setting.\u201cHey, Sunhwa! Get a hold of yourself. Kang Sunhwa!\u201dHer arm was limp. She had taken on that crazy troll\u2019s destructive force with such a slender arm. It appeared the shock of impact had traveled up her shoulder into her insides.\u201cHey!\u201dI tried putting a potion into her mouth, but it was no use. She remained in a state of just barely breathing.Kuoooooogh!The magic troll continued to batter the barrier. The look in its eyes was like blazing flames.\u2018It\u2019ll die in a few minutes.\u2019I bit my lips. The monster had about \u2153 of its HP left. A berserking magic troll would be able to release tremendous power, but it wouldn\u2019t be able to handle that power for long and would die. The more intensely it moved, the faster its HP would drain.\u201cDammit.\u201dSunhwa was still as unconscious as ever.Through Sixth Sense, the exact trajectory had been drawn out in my head. I had perceived it mentally, but my body simply hadn\u2019t been able to react. Sunhwa hadn\u2019t been a factor in that trajectory\u2014she had forcibly butted in, slightly redirecting the troll\u2019s fist. Thanks to that, I had survived and Kang Sunhwa ended up on the verge of death. She had put out her arm for\u00a0my\u00a0sake.I glared at the berserking magic troll.\u2018You piece of shit.\u2019The magic troll\u2019s HP was nearly completely drained. To the very end, it burned the flame of its lifeforce with frenzied rage.Oooooooooghh!With a terrible shriek, the troll rampaged outside the Safe Zone it could not trespass. And then, it bravely died a natural death.[The berserk Magic Troll has died.][The Player closest to the Magic Troll under level 20 within the same Field will be recognized as the hunter.]There was no way a Player under level 20 could possibly kill a berserking magic troll. As long as you could survive purely out of luck, the System would recognize you as killing the magic troll. In the past, that person was probably So Yoohyun.Senia appeared.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin. You have been recognized as the Player who hunted the magic troll.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t feel very happy. Without realizing it, I glared at Senia. The Streamer Senia, and the Guardians who turned the world like this so they could watch for their amusement, they were all on the same side.At the same time, field-wide notices rang out.[In accordance with the death of the Tutorial Field Boss Monster, the Tutorial Field will be deactivated.][The Tutorial Quest has been cleared.][Subsequent difficulty will be determined by the number of Tutorial Field survivors.][Checking the number of Tutorial Field survivors.]I didn\u2019t know if that number was important, but it was the #1 recurring question in the civil servant exam.

I had survived, and although she was unconscious, so had Sunhwa. That meant there should at least be two more survivors. But the number of survivors was exactly the same, down to the last digit.[Initiating the Tutorial rewards calculation.][The general system reward, as well as the individual rewards sent through Intermediate Administrators, will be distributed to each Player.]I administered emergency treatment, feeding Sunhwa healing potions so that she could hold onto the ember of life for just a few seconds longer.\u2018I can save her.\u2019I could do it.

Right now, the collapsed Sunhwa required my attention more. My mind whirled, drawing out the next events and how exactly I could save Sunhwa.[In accordance with the successful clear of the Tutorial Field, the \u2018Tutorial Ender\u2019 title will be given.][The \u2018Tutorial Ender\u2019 is a title given to the surviving Player remaining in the \u2018D-Tower 2nd Floor\u2019, the Tutorial Main Field.][The \u2018Tutorial Ender\u2019 title has been given to \u2018Player So Yoohyun\u2019.][Player So Yoohyun has been registered in the \u2018Hall of Fame\u2019.]I already knew this would happen. I knew how to get the Tutorial Ender title. I had planned on not making the troll berserk by slowly shaving away at it until it died, but my plans had gone slightly awry. However, I didn\u2019t regret not getting the title.\u2018On the 2nd floor of the D-Tower\u2026 the only survivor is So Yoohyun.\u2019Everyone else had died, even the man who had yelled at me to run away.\u2018It\u2019s the same as the past.\u2019That was okay.\u201cSenia. We agreed to make a deal, didn\u2019t we?\u201dWe hadn\u2019t negotiated the deal yet. After killing the miniboss monster, the Goblin Soldier, the deal had been delayed. But now, I intended on settling it.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *I said, \u201cI\u2019m sure many prominent Guardians have entered your channel.

The two of them alone are Guardians with plenty of capital.\u201dWhat\u2019s more\u2014\u201cThe Nameless Observer personally sponsored me with more Coins than the Lady of the Scales.\u201dSenia was probably well aware of that.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom the very start, I have proven my value.\u201dSenia didn\u2019t say anything. She had no choice but to acknowledge my words as the truth. No one, not even So Yoohyun, who had gotten the Tutorial Ender title, had been able to show a Play as exciting as mine.\u201cEven an Intermediate Administrator as talentless as you should be able to survive\u2026\u00a0if\u00a0you have good quality content.\u201d\u201c\u2026Though I do not agree with your evaluation of me as talentless, I do acknowledge that I need good quality content to survive.\u201dSenia stared at me with her usual expressionless face.\u201cThe Tutorial Field has ended, and the opening act is finished. Now, the true Tutorial mode will begin. Correct?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSenia was unperturbed. Although this was something no regular Player should know, and I had been acting like I had a strategy guide on hand, she didn\u2019t show much reaction.\u201cI want you to raise the grade of my Item Shop. Right now. The Tutorial is over, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an excessive request.\u201dAfter a short moment of silence, Senia said, \u201cI do not think that is a very sensible method. You have proven your worth. You have the right to demand more from me. Also, the Item Shop\u2014\u201d\u201cWill naturally have its restrictions lifted with time?\u201d\u201cYes. It is a problem that time will solve.\u201dCurrently, it was restricted to the \u2018Tutorial-grade\u2019. However, with the passage of time, the Item Shop\u2019s grade would naturally rise.In my eyes, I saw the barely breathing Sunhwa.\u201cI will buy that time.\u201dThe Tutorial Field had been deactivated. As such, changing the Item Shop\u2019s grade from \u2018Tutorial\u2019 to \u2018Beginner\u2019 with the authority of an Intermediate Administrator wasn\u2019t all that hard.\u2018The reason I want to save Sunhwa is\u2026\u2019Because she had an unprecedented talent for tanking? Or because she was a jewel in the rough with incredible hidden potential? No, my reason for saving her was nothing that grand. Right now, it was \u2018because I want to save her\u2019. Sunhwa would have done the same for me, without any calculations of profit and loss.I faced Senia.\u201cI\u2019ll make an exclusive contract with you. For one year, no other Intermediate Administrator will be able to observe me. The Guardians will only be able to watch me through you, no matter what.\u201dSenia\u2019s eyes grew wide. Of course she did, since I had already offered a \u2018Player-Intermediate Administrator exclusive contract\u2019 as a card.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin. Just exactly how much do you know?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not important. What\u2019s important is\u2014\u201dSenia\u2019s wingtips trembled.\u201cThat I have caught the attention of many Guardians. That I\u2019m the only Player to have already received thousands of Coins. And that I\u2019m a Ranker who lifted the Tutorial Field\u2019s level cap ahead of time. I\u2019m sure the rumors will spread amongst the Intermediate Administrators as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cRemember this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cRight now.

Sure enough, I heard a notice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was truly, truly, a relief.\u2018If not for Sunhwa\u2026\u2019If Sunhwa hadn\u2019t absorbed the hit for him, Hyukjin\u2019s head might have been crushed by now. No, it\u00a0would\u00a0have been crushed. The detailed imagery he\u2019d gotten from Sixth Sense had drawn out his death all too clearly.He was alive thanks to Sunhwa.

That way, he could reduce the shock this little kid had to suffer, if only a little.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 alive.\u201dSunhwa got up. She thought she would die right then and there, but she was alive.

There had been a lot of Players who only burned brightly in the beginner period. They were called \u2018Rising Stars\u2019 or \u2018Super Rookies\u2019, but they quickly faded from the public eye. It felt a little too early for me to be happy about being a genius.\u201cAlso, the Excellent Hunter title has been upgraded.\u201dOriginally, it was \u2018Excellent Hunter\u2019, but it was upgraded to \u2018Excellent Player\u2019.[Excellent Player]A title that is only granted in the Tutorial Field and can only be upgraded after hunting the Tutorial Field\u2019s Boss Monster. Applies to all \u2018hunted prey\u2019.20% additional damage.+20% movement speed.Ability to use the special skill \u2018Excellent Strike\u2019\u2014a medium chance to ignore the prey\u2019s unique trait.+10% EXP gain.The title effects were so astonishing that even I couldn\u2019t help but be shocked.\u2018A title like this was given not in some A-rank or higher dungeon, but\u2026 the\u00a0Tutorial?\u2019Additional damage. Increased movement speed. Ability to ignore unique traits. Increased EXP gain. A special skill. Each and every one of them were gems.\u2018Even though this is the very beginning\u2026?\u2019On top of the +10% EXP gain from this title, the title effect of \u2018First Pioneer\u2019 was also in effect.[The First Pioneer]A glorious title given to one who pioneered a new domain.EXP +20%Stacks with other titles.That meant I could level up 30% faster than others. Leveling up faster on its own wasn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. But the faster you leveled up, the faster you would grow, which meant you would be able to take firsts in everything.\u2018I know the future.\u2019I had the strategy guide in my head. Between the ability to take firsts and the knowledge to make that happen, I had everything.\u2018Who would have known that something like this was hidden in the Tutorial?\u2019To be honest, it didn\u2019t seem like the Tutorial was made for someone to gain these things. After all, to begin with, a low-level Player couldn\u2019t hunt a \u2018lycanthrope\u2019. It was impossible without resorting to tricks. So this stream of events was already impossible from that point onwards, at least originally.Three level ups, plus nine random stats. On top of that, a title upgrade. And that wasn\u2019t the end of the rewards. That alone could certainly be called a \u2018jackpot\u2019, but there was more.\u2018This is the real jackpot.\u2019I recalled the new \u2018individual reward\u2019 I had just gotten.Earlier, back when I was in danger of dying to the magic troll and Sixth Sense was urgently activated, I heard this:[You have overcome the \u2018death sentence\u2019 of \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019.][A condition for the fusion of \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019 has been fulfilled.]My innate ability, Sixth Sense, had undoubtedly warned me of death. No, it foresaw my death. But thanks to Sunhwa stepping in unexpectedly, I survived.[Fusion with the \u2018Tutorial Bonus\u2019 or \u2018Open Beta Bonus\u2019 is possible.]I had received two Open Beta Bonuses. One was the \u2018High Strength Elixir\u2019 I used when fighting the Lycanthrope, which I got from the \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019. The other was the \u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 that was with me nearly from the very start of the Tutorial, given by the \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019.[High Strength Elixir.][Calm Observer\u2019s Eye.]The High Strength Elixir was already used up, so only \u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 was left.Calm Observer\u2019s Eye could be fused with Sixth Sense. I had heard of \u2018fusion\u2019 before, but this only applied to Rankers of the highest level and wasn\u2019t something normal people knew much about. It was the sort of information you could maybe dig up by doing a lot of civil servant studying.\u2018So fusion also existed in the Tutorial.\u2019I had the thought that there might actually be a lot of secrets the populace didn\u2019t know about hidden within the Tutorial.[Will you approve the fusion of \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019 and \u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019?]I approved it. My heart began to race, and it felt like hot blood came rushing out from within my heart to shoot vitality all throughout my body. With a little exaggeration, it felt like steam was rising from my body.[\u2018Sixth Sense\u2019 and \u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 have begun to fuse.][The fusion process is accompanied by extreme pain.][If you are unable to endure the pain, you will die.]At that moment, agony assaulted my heart.\u201cArgh!\u201dThis fucking System. It should have told me this in advance.\u201cO-Oppa, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dI collapsed, clutching my chest. I\u2019d never felt pain like this before. I didn\u2019t know exactly how to describe it, but it felt like my heart was boiling up, like each and every drop of blood in my body was boiling. I writhed, enduring the terrible feeling of my body being burned, like something enormous was piercing through my insides.\u201cUAAAGHHHH!\u201dMy body screamed, heedless of what my mind willed.It hurt.It really fucking hurt. It was difficult to explain beyond \u2018it hurt\u2019, but the pain was so great I would rather die.It felt like something snapped, and I had no memory of what happened afterwards, which meant I probably lost consciousness.While unconscious, I faintly felt like I heard the words \u2018Fusion successful\u2019, though it was like hearing something in a dream. In any case, I had the feeling I heard those words, but I didn\u2019t exactly remember.The moment I regained consciousness, I was greeted with a reality that was difficult to believe.\u2018No way\u2014!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: Innate Ability Awakening (2)I faintly heard some notices.[Innate Ability \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 has been successfully fused.][Innate Ability \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 has awakened.]I began to see the world around me again, and I also heard notices. It seemed, without a doubt, that I was alive. My ears picked up a voice.\u201cWhat was a fellow who went to study doing instead of studying?\u201dThat truly blunt voice\u2026 was my older sister\u2019s, the same idiotic sister of mine who worked herself ragged in a superconductor factory trying to support me and ended up developing leukemia.\u201cNoona\u2026?\u201dTN: Noona is a familiar term used by a male to refer to an older female.My sister whipped around. As usual, she was the epitome of bluntness.\u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you\u2019re not dead.\u201dAnd then, she left the hospital room. I focused on the sounds around me, and as if to prove that clearing the Tutorial wasn\u2019t a dream, I clearly heard a notice.[\u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 is active.]\u2018Innate ability. Eye of Perception.\u2019\u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 and \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019 fused and were reborn into a new ability called \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019. I had the feeling it was the biggest boon I\u2019d gotten from the Tutorial Field.\u2018Eye of Perception is\u2026\u2019I hadn\u2019t heard of it ten years ago. There was no \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 among the prominent Rankers and the countless innate abilities they boasted. The innate ability latent within my body had awakened.\u2018First of all, I think it\u2019s enhancing my senses to their limits.\u2019I could hear every minute sound from outside the hospital room. They were really tiny sounds, but my ears picked them up. That had to be the power of \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019. I focused and listened.\u201cShoulda just gone and died if he was gonna die. Why make a person worry?\u201d someone said, before crying in full force. Outside the room door, my older sister was crouching and crying. It seemed she had left quickly on purpose so she could hide her crying face. She was making muffled\u00a0uwahh, uwahhhh\u00a0sounds, but the sobs went from rather pitiable to bordering on funny. I could only guess she was crying with tears and snot all over her face.\u2018Noona. Sorry, but\u2026 I can hear everything.\u2019Thanks to Eye of Perception, I could hear every single thing. But the fascination about the fact I could hear such a minute sound came second. For some reason, my eyes began to redden.After hearing my sister\u2019s sharp voice, it finally struck me.\u2018She\u2019s really alive.\u2019I had returned to the past, with my knowledge of the future intact, plus an innate ability of the highest level called \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019. Enhancing my senses wasn\u2019t the only thing \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 could do.[Non-Awakened]Name: Kim AhyoungAge: 24State: Relieved / Happy / WorriedDisposition: Self-Sacrificing / Brusque / LovingSummary: Devoted tsundereIs a non-Awakened.The state/disposition/summary only show the most representative and can change according to the situation.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible.The summary seemed a little strange, but it wasn\u2019t really wrong. Devoted tsundere\u2026 was right, after all.\u2018Noona. You don\u2019t have to go to the superconductor factory anymore.\u2019No, it wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t have to go, but that I\u00a0wouldn\u2019t\u00a0let her go. Supporting her foolish little brother\u2026 was something she didn\u2019t have to do anymore.\u2018I\u2019ll make it so you can live in comfort.\u2019I couldn\u2019t be a hundred percent sure, but there was no doubt that my talent wasn\u2019t the same as before. I saw with my own eyes that I had talent and skills even greater than So Yoohyun\u2019s. As long as nothing happened, as long as there weren\u2019t any unexpected variables, there was a high chance that I could even become a Ranker. If that happened, our family would certainly be able to live well, without worries.I filled my lungs, then belted out, \u201cNoona! Buy me a lot of honey! I want to eat honey! A ton of it!\u201dMy sister, crying outside, muttered, \u201cWhat\u2019s that idiot going on about\u2026?\u201d She got to her feet. Eye of Perception captured every sound she made.\u201cHoney my ass. Does he wanna get beat up with honey, seriously.\u201dShe walked off, probably to buy me honey. I said I wanted to eat a lot of it, so she would probably go all out buying it.I heard the sound of someone other than my sister sobbing.\u201cMom.\u201d That one word made my eyes well with tears, too. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. Your son isn\u2019t dead.\u201dMom wasn\u2019t able to stop her tears. Even though I was a son without a single redeeming feature, an eternal civil servant student, I was still her son.My mom wasn\u2019t the only one next to my bed. There was also the kid who had helped me to the very end and called emergency services for me as soon as the Tutorial Field dissipated, Kang Sunhwa.\u201cOppaaaaaaaa!!!\u201dCrying loudly, Sunhwa came bounding over to me as I laid on the hospital bed. She squeezed me tightly with her small body, which I found rather uncomfortable.\u201cOi, oi, hurry and get off me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so glad. I thought you died.\u201dI snorted to myself, looking at the girl who had no intention of getting off me. Telling her to get off just made her stick even closer. She must have really thought that I had died, and that must have scared her. We\u2019d only known each other for a few days, but she was already this fond of me.\u2018Though, well, we did save each other\u2019s lives.\u2019As far as relationships went, ours was indeed rather special. We\u2019d gone through life and death together, so it wasn\u2019t surprising we\u2019d be fond of each other. Of course, I wasn\u2019t seeing her as a woman or anything like that. It was more like looking at a dear niece.\u201cHey, you smell like sweat.\u201dOnly then did the clingy Sunhwa scramble backwards. I felt like I could breathe again.\u201cI-I-I showered yesterday!\u201d\u201cBut you still smell?\u201d\u201cI-I-I don\u2019t smell, okay?!\u201d\u201cEww, the smell.\u201dI squeezed my nose shut. Sunhwa\u2019s face reddened, and she bolted out the door that my sister had left through.\u2018In any case\u2026\u2019However things turned out, I had returned to the past. Here, in this place that had become my \u2018reality\u2019, my mom was here, and so was my sister. There was also Sunhwa, who had saved my life and had likewise been saved by me.\u2018This time\u2026\u2019I would live well.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *So Yoohyun, who received the \u2018Tutorial Ender\u2019 title and was registered in the \u2018Hall of Fame\u2019, became a famous figure overnight. He appeared multiple times on TV and was even called the Tutorial\u2019s Strongest. He was introduced as the most talented man in Korea.\u2013That\u2019s not true. I was simply lucky.So Yoohyun replied with those words. Everyone thought he was just being modest, but So Yoohyun was dead serious.\u2018The true Tutorial Ender isn\u2019t me.\u2019The moment his consciousness began to trickle back, he saw the back of two people. One young girl, and one man. His eyesight was fuzzy, so he didn\u2019t get a clear look, but he was sure of it in his mind.\u2018It\u2019s the man I saw in Cheonggyecheon.\u2019There was no doubt. It was that man.\u2018Come to think of it, what was his name again?\u2019They hadn\u2019t exchanged names.\u2018Did that man\u2026 die?\u2019That man had come up to the 2nd floor of the Gwanghwamun D-Tower and tried to save the others, ultimately saving only Yoohyun before fleeing. The magic troll had gone off in hot pursuit. Yoohyun didn\u2019t think there was much of a chance he\u2019d survived.To the press, he said the following:\u2013There was a true hero in the Tutorial. I simply benefited from his kindness.Yoohyun only said that much, no more and no less. He judged that if that man was alive, he would show himself on his own initiative. It could be disrespectful to run his mouth off when that person hadn\u2019t stepped forward yet.\u2018Could he be alive?\u2019Of course, he didn\u2019t know if that hero was alive, or if he was dead.\u2018If he\u2019s alive\u2026\u2019If he was alive, then he was Yoohyun\u2019s life savior. Yoohyun owed that man his life, owed that man a favor that he absolutely had to repay.\u201cI hope you\u2019re alive, somewhere,\u201d thought Yoohyun from the bottom of his heart. He hoped there would be a chance for him to repay the favor.* * *One month passed.\u2018Slimes\u2019, neutral monsters that even civilians could kill if they put their minds to it, were a common sight along the road. It became daily life for local kids to play around with slimes. Within one month, the world became prepared to accept the existence of monsters, and concepts like \u2018Player\u2019 and \u2018Playing\u2019 began to take root.\u2018Difficulty: low.\u201dFor the time being, it would be safe\u2026 other than the \u2018dungeons\u2019 or \u2018gates\u2019. At most, only monsters like \u2018city foxes\u2019 or \u2018city wolves\u2019 would show up. That being said, even city foxes and city wolves could be pretty dangerous for civilians.\u2013Two injuries and one death have come about from city wolves\u2026Incidents caused by city foxes or city wolves occurred nearly every day. They were conditionally passive monsters, so they wouldn\u2019t attack if they weren\u2019t messed with, but people dying or getting injured because they provoked them for no good reason was commonplace.\u2013The authorities immediately sent police to suppress the city wolves\u2026Foxes and wolves didn\u2019t have \u2018shields\u2019 because they were such elementary monsters.\u2018In time, monsters that can\u2019t be killed with scientific technology will start showing up.\u2019That would happen in one year. By then, the Players Association would be established, Players would have formed guilds among themselves, and the world would be more or less used to the \u2018System\u2019. From that point on, the world would begin to change again, little by little.\u2018Until that happens, I\u2019ll make full preparations.\u2019I would use my knowledge of the future to the fullest, in order to live differently from the past. To live not as an eternal civil servant student, but as an upright and successful person.Today\u2019s date was the 7th of June.\u2018Seoul Station.\u2019I took Sunhwa with me to Seoul Station. It was around 6 in the evening. Because people were getting off work and heading home, Seoul Station was extremely crowded.\u2018Seoul Station, Exit 2.\u2019Here, a small gate would form, a gate connected to the \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon\u2019. The grade would be indicated as \u2018\u2014\u2019. In other words, it had no grade. For convenience\u2019s sake, I called it a beginner dungeon.People began to murmur.\u201cHuh? What\u2019s that?\u201dSome people even screamed. No wonder, because near Exit 2, something akin to a blackish red shimmer began to spread out in the air. The gate was around 2 meters large, at most\u2014it wasn\u2019t a very big one. People kept their distance from it.\u201cMonsters won\u2019t pop out, will they?\u201dPeople hadn\u2019t yet forgotten that day in Jongno, the fateful beginning of the Cataclysm. It was the site of a terrible disaster where only 5,000 out of 150,000 people survived. Normal life was just beginning to resume, but another strange thing appeared before they could even fully get past the trauma of that day. It was only natural they would be apprehensive.\u2018But the world will change too much for you to be surprised by something like this.\u2019These people would also have to adapt in the future, to the new System and the new world. Those who weren\u2019t able to adapt would be eliminated. Just like me in the past.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dI headed towards the gate with Sunhwa. The gate was clickable.[Seoul Station Dungeon Gate]The gate to Seoul Station Dungeon.There was no particular explanation. Perhaps because a gate had appeared, I heard the sirens of police cars coming from afar. The police were probably coming over to check the situation.\u2018It\u2019ll be troublesome if the police come.\u2019It would be best to go in quickly.[Only Players can utilize the gate.][At least seven Players are recommended for this dungeon.][Required level: 10]Both Sunhwa and I were Players, and we were over level 10.\u2018We\u2019re going in.\u2019I moved a few steps forward, and then, the world around me changed.[You have entered Seoul Station Dungeon.][Channel #19207 has been opened.][Guardians have begun to enter.]There, I was greeted with a familiar face, an Intermediate Administrator so beautiful it couldn\u2019t be put into words, with a pair of wings behind her back. It was, in our world\u2019s terms, Streamer Senia.With an expressionless face, Senia said, \u201cAt least seven Players are recommended for this dungeon.\u201dI ignored her, starting to walk forward.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin. I offer this warning as an Intermediate Administrator. At least seven Players should enter. Do not leave the Safe Zone.\u201d\u201cHow come?\u201d\u201cTackling this dungeon with two people is dangerous.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe manual encourages this dungeon be Played by at least seven Players.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFor a very brief moment, I waited. During this time, there were probably many Guardians streaming into Senia\u2019s Channel #19207.\u2018This should be long enough.\u2019After waiting a moment, I spoke to Senia. Or rather, I spoke to the Guardians watching down on us for their amusement.\u201cI said it before, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cSaid what?\u201d\u201cThat I would show you how I Play.\u201dIf that was the way one had to adapt to this world, if that was the path to my success\u2026\u2018I\u2019ll show you.\u2019I walked forward.\u2018How I adapt to this world.\u2019At the same time, I heard a new notice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For now, drawing the attention of a Guardian could be seen as a pretty good thing. Whether or not it could be of profit to me depended on how I controlled them and how I acted.\u2018A lot of Guardians must have joined the stream.\u2019Countless anonymous Guardians had to be watching Channel #19207. Since Sunhwa and I were the only Players that had entered the Seoul Station Dungeon, the spotlight had nowhere to go but on us.[\u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 is active.]Information began to flood into me via Eye of Perception. The world was sketched out in detail in my head, like I was seeing it without my eyes.\u201cThis is\u2026 a dungeon?\u201d Sunhwa asked hesitantly.The Seoul Station Dungeon was generally dark. It gave off the feeling of a dark cave. It was considerably humid, rather chilly, and water dripped from the ceiling. I nodded.\u2018It\u2019s just like what I saw on Youtube.\u2019In the future, this dungeon would become the place countless Players would frequent to accumulate experience, a \u2018Tutorial Dungeon\u2019 in the true sense of the phrase. I fixed my eyes on Sunhwa.[Player]Name: Kang SunhwaAge: 14Level: 15Class: \u2013Guardian: \u2013State: Lonely / Fearful / Trusting / ReliantDisposition: Neutral / CuriousSummary: Slight Brother ComplexClass has not yet been selected.Guardian has not yet been selected.The state/disposition/summary only show the most representative and can change according to the situation.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible.I grinned. \u2018She\u2019s already level 15?\u2019I thought there might be a somewhat weird trait in there, but I decided to ignore it. Somehow, both my sister and Sunhwa seemed to have something abnormal in their \u2018summary\u2019.\u2018With a level like that, she did great leveling up.\u2019The fact she had raised her level to 15 despite there only being monsters like slimes, city foxes, and city wolves in Korea meant that she had worked pretty hard to progress her Playing. It was impressive she could raise her level that much by grinding low-level monsters.I said to Sunhwa, \u201cYou remember everything I told you before, right?\u201dShe nodded. I took the lead and began to walk forward. Streamer Senia followed in a half-transparent state. Her flat expression couldn\u2019t be read, but she certainly looked unsatisfied. It seemed she was worried her \u2018good quality content\u2019\u2014me\u2014would kick the bucket here.\u2018She\u2019s not worrying about me.\u2019 I didn\u2019t delude myself. \u2018She\u2019s worrying about the\u00a0product\u00a0that is me.\u2019There was no need to bother about Senia. In any case, I had no intention of dying. All I was thinking about was how I could sell the product that was me better.\u2018Seven forked pathways.\u2019When you turned into each forked path, that path would be activated. The Seoul Station Dungeon was a dungeon with a set \u2018aggregate difficulty\u2019. When all seven split paths were activated, the degree of danger would also be divided into seven. Put simply, if you divided a difficulty of \u20187\u2019 among \u20187 people\u2019 with \u20187 paths\u2019, each path would only have a difficulty of \u20181\u2019.\u2018In the opposite case, if you only choose one path\u2026\u2019The difficulty of \u20187\u2019 would be concentrated on one path. That was how it would normally be\u2026 if you Played the dungeon the regular way. However, the Seoul Station Dungeon had been cleared by countless Players, and even the Hidden Piece lurking within had been publicized.\u201cOppa. I see the forked pathways there.\u201dI saw the seven caves. They looked like snakes opening their jaws wide.\u201cWait here.\u201d[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is watching over you with interest.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 expresses intense interest in you.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is earnestly observing you.]I went into the first cave to the very left. When I did so, a golden magic array appeared on the cave floor.[Seoul Station Dungeon 1st Forked Path, \u2018Nepalas\u2019 Path\u2019, has been activated.]Then, I immediately left, doing the same with the other paths.[Seoul Station Dungeon 2nd Forked Path, \u2018Dyugo\u2019s Path\u2019, has been activated.][Seoul Station Dungeon 3rd Forked Path, \u2018Delansha\u2019s Path\u2019, has been activated.]\u2026\u2026[Seoul Station Dungeon 7th Forked Path, \u2018Lakitula\u2019s Path\u2019, has been activated.]I activated every path. That was all I needed to do. There was more to dungeon clearing than forging straight ahead. You had to sometimes advance, sometimes retreat, and when necessary, roll to the side. It was possible to freely enter and leave the forked pathways. There was also no condition saying that all paths had to be \u2018simultaneously cleared\u2019. A clear like this, where each path was tackled one by one, was also just as valid.Now, the difficulty of each path was set to \u20181\u2019. I walked to the 1st Forked Path, \u2018Nepalas\u2019 Path\u2019, and stood in front of it.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *So Yoohyun had the hunch that this thing called \u2018Playing\u2019 was not a one-time event. The Tutorial Field appeared, and \u2018Intermediate Administrators\u2019 and \u2018Guardians\u2019 showed up in the world, as well as monsters.He made the bold decision to quit his job at the financial company where he had just been hired. He did so in order to devote himself to \u2018Playing\u2019. Some people ridiculed his decision, many of them cursing him for giving up on a stable and high-paying job.However, So Yoohyun could imagine the future ahead.\u2018As I thought\u2026 it\u2019ll keep going.\u2019If weak monsters existed, then so did strong ones. Strong monsters would drop better items. Right now, just catching slimes, city foxes, and city wolves would drop things like \u2018Iron Swords\u2019 and \u2018Low Constitution Potions\u2019.\u2018Even just those things have a pretty good effect.\u2019Monster drops were of great use in real life. For example, the \u2018Low Constitution Potion\u2019 boasted far better efficacy than most drugs used for surgeries. If such a strong item was dropped from a shoddy monster under level 10, what kinds of things would come from even stronger monsters?Of course, far better things would drop from them. The world was faced with change, and Yoohyun decided to step in time with that change, to quickly adapt. That was his decision.\u2018That\u2019s a dungeon.\u2019At Seoul Station Exit 2, there was a dungeon. The Intermediate Administrator who focused their streaming on Yoohyun, \u2018Neptune\u2019, snickered.\u201cYou need at least seven people for that one. Mm. There are already two people inside, so only four more people need to come.\u201dA few Players approached. They appeared to be survivors from the Tutorial Field. In the one month that had passed, several pieces of information were spread across the world. This information was relayed by the \u2018Intermediate Administrators\u2019.[If a dungeon is not cleared within a certain amount of time after its formation, it will collapse.][Monsters will break free from collapsed dungeons.][That is called a \u2018Dungeon Break\u2019.][The people who can clear dungeons are \u2018those who have Player Qualifications\u2019.]Policemen had begun to seal off Seoul Station Exit 2. Sealing it off was expected, since it wasn\u2019t yet known whether the gate was dangerous or not. That was for the safety of the populace.Someone walked towards the police. Their feet floated about 30 centimetres off the floor. They were walking, but not on the ground. They were definitely not human.\u201cJeez. How annoying,\u201d muttered that blue-skinned being with a horn on his head as he approached the police. \u201cAre you guys gonna take responsibility for my daily keep? Why\u2019re you blocking my stream, huh?\u201dHe lifted a policeman by the throat.\u201cG-Gugh! L-Let him go!\u201d One of his fellow policemen whipped out a taser gun. \u201cI-If you don\u2019t let go, I\u2019ll fire at once!\u201dThe \u2018strange being\u2019 grinned in response, then rotated his neck twice in a grotesque fashion to stare at the policeman.\u201cTry it.\u201dAnd then, the neck of the policeman in his hands broke with a\u00a0crack,\u00a0dying immediately. The people crowding around screamed as they began to run.\u201cYou insects are seriously noisy.\u201dRed marbles were formed at the tip of his finger, and they scattered into the air. The marbles ricocheted like bouncy balls, and wherever they touched, flames sprouted.\u201cSo what I\u2019m saying is, why butt in where you don\u2019t belong? You insects.\u201dThe policeman who had taken out his taser gun was no exception. His body was set ablaze, and he rolled around on the ground, screaming for mercy.Seoul Station Exit 2 became true pandemonium. Several dozen people at the very least were burned to a crisp on the spot, and countless more fled while pushing and trampling each other in a frenzy. In very little time, only Players and Intermediate Administrators were left in the vicinity.\u201cNow, then. Why don\u2019t you start Playing now, you Player bastards?\u201dSo Yoohyun did not flee. He was someone who had survived Jongno\u2019s Cataclysm. He was used to chaos of this degree. He secretly clenched his fists hard. He knew that Intermediate Administrator\u2019s name\u2014it was \u2018Chris\u2019. He also knew the name of the Player Chris was with.\u2018Seo Joohwan.\u2019They had met briefly in the Tutorial Field. Seo Joohwan was hunting a goblin, and Yoohyun realized then that the man was insane. He still vividly remembered Joohwan\u2019s look of relishing killing and cackling while covered in blood. It could be said that Seo Joohwan and Chris were a well-matched Player and Intermediate Administrator pair.Joohwan made a gesture of greeting with his eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t think I\u2019d meet you here, Mr. Tutorial Ender.\u201dEveryone who followed Yoohyun in the Tutorial Field had died. However, five of the people who had followed Joohwan had survived. A total of seven Players had gathered in front of the gate.A man behind Joohwan shrugged and said, \u201cHe\u2019s the Tutorial Ender, after all. He must have smelled the money. Because dungeons and monsters will change the world in the future.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPolicemen and civilians had died here, but the Players were not greatly shaken. This was a world they had already experienced. They had also been a part of the event where 14,000 people had died.Yoohyun thought for a moment. His Intermediate Administrator, \u2018Neptune\u2019, had also recommended going in with seven people.\u2018Do I have no choice?\u2019He didn\u2019t really want to mesh with these people, but he didn\u2019t have a choice. They were survivors of the Tutorial Field and held quite a lot of strength. They would definitely be of help in clearing the dungeon.Steeling himself, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s make a party and go inside.\u201d* * *Kang Sunhwa was still not as used to Playing as Kim Hyukjin.\u201cO-Oppa. They\u2019re too big. Aren\u2019t they too strong?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. They only look strong on the outside.\u201dWhat they were referring to was a completely black \u2018cow\u2019-shaped monster.Black Yak LVL 12The black yak was an animal monster with a large body and great strength. It had a habit of running forward and plowing into its opponent when excited, and that attack was so powerful it could kill higher-level Players in mere moments.Mooooooooo!!!Three black yaks charged towards Hyukjin. After dodging slightly to the side, he sliced off the horn of a black yak with his Iron Sword. At the same time, he ran up the side of the cave and got onto another black yak\u2019s back.Moooooo!The black yak fiercely resisted, but Hyukjin didn\u2019t fall off. Squeezing with both legs, he raised his sword and plunged it down.Splurt\u2013!The Iron Sword went straight into the top of the black yak\u2019s head. It collapsed with a thump, and Hyukjin sliced off its horn.\u201cWha\u2014?\u201dShock flashed through Sunhwa\u2019s eyes. \u2018T-Two in one go.\u2019Each and every movement Hyukjin made was as fluid as one smooth motion. Two black yaks fell over on the spot.After jumping lightly off the corpse of the black yak he had so swiftly dispatched, Hyukjin shot forward towards the one that had stopped in place after its charge, his movements as swift as an arrow.Slice.Another horn was cut off.[You have killed Black Yaks.][EXP acquired.][12 Coins acquired.]Sunhwa said to Hyukjin sourly, \u201cOppa. Um\u2026 About those movements you made just now.\u201d They were a bit strange. \u201cIs that something everyone can do?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI felt it while Playing outside, but I\u2019ve never seen anyone move like you, oppa. I also saw Tutorial survivors, and\u2026 there\u2019s no one like oppa.\u201d\u201cThat so?\u201dHyukjin had seen a lot of Players on Youtube, so he didn\u2019t think too hard about it. Everyone out there right now were low-level Players who hadn\u2019t even advanced yet anyway. Of course a low-level couldn\u2019t move that well. He had seen the future, so he considered his movements to be just so-so.\u201cHow in the world are you doing that?\u201dSunhwa saw it with her own two eyes, but it didn\u2019t seem real. He was\u2026 almost like a beast born to Play. That\u2019s how it looked to the 14-year-old Kang Sunhwa.\u201cHm, I guess\u2026\u201dHyukjin glanced at Senia. He knew his words would be streamed to the Guardians, too.\u201cYou just have to work hard.\u201d\u201cWork hard?\u201d\u201cYeah. As hard as your desire not to regret it. Putting your all in every moment.\u201dHyukjin\u2019s words were sincere. He no longer wanted to regret anything. He wanted to live differently this time. He was undoubtedly speaking from his heart, but a flicker of doubt appeared in Sunhwa\u2019s eyes for the first time. Was hard work really enough? To be able to move like oppa?[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is silent.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is satisfied with your response.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is disgusted by your response.]The young, 14-year-old Sunhwa balled her fists. She doubted Hyukjin for a moment, but she still trusted him wholeheartedly on a fundamental level.\u2018I will also\u2026!\u2019She thought Hyukjin had to be putting in an incredible amount of effort somewhere out of her sight. She felt the \u2018weight of an adult\u2019 from his words just now. As hard as your desire not to regret it. Those words felt heavy to her, and she felt just as much trust as the weight of those words.\u2018I\u2019ll work hard.\u2019Something like vague optimism, the hope that she could become like her oppa if she worked hard sprouted within her. She dreamt.The two of them continued to hunt, and after a while, Hyukjin smiled widely.\u2018It finally came out.\u2019Something dropped, and that \u2018thing\u2019 was a sparkling item. It was the item Hyukjin had been looking for.\u201cOppa, what\u2019s that?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: Nightmare (2)This place, the first forked path, was called \u2018Nepalas\u2019 Path\u2019.In the Tutorial Dungeon\u2019s setting, \u2018Nepalas\u2019 was the name of one of the first gods, and a \u2018ring\u2019 previously cherished by that god dropped in the first forked path. It had a random chance to drop. If you were lucky, it could drop after one kill, but it could also take a long time.\u2018In any case, the total time it takes to collect all seven items is about the same.\u2019If it took a long time in the 1st forked path, it would take comparatively less time in the 2nd.\u2018This one was\u2026 average, I guess?\u2019It didn\u2019t feel particularly slow or fast.[You have acquired Nepalas\u2019 Ring.]Now that we had the ring, we were finished here. I turned without hesitation.\u201cOppa. There are more black yaks in the corner over there\u2026 We don\u2019t have to hunt them?\u201d\u201cNope. Black yaks don\u2019t give much EXP.\u201dThe greatest efficiency in the least amount of time\u2014that was the basic principle of Playing. Black yaks weren\u2019t all that cost-effective. They weren\u2019t very difficult to kill, but the EXP they gave was too low compared to the time it took.\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re going to the 2nd path.\u201dThe order wasn\u2019t really set in stone, but there was an implicit clearing method that Players agreed on. Countless people had cleared the \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon\u2019, and a strategy had formed naturally according to their experiences. Normally, when soloing this dungeon, you went in order from path 1 to 7.We left the first path and went into the second.[You have entered the Seoul Station Dungeon 2nd Forked Path, \u2018Dyugo\u2019s Path\u2019.]* * *So Yoohyun and Seo Joohwan\u2019s group entered the 1st forked path. Joohwan made a sound of admiration.\u201cWowie\u2026\u201dThere were black yak bodies everywhere. Seeing as only their horns were sliced off, it seemed their horns were their weak spot. There were a ton of dead black yaks, at least thirty of them.\u201cIt looks like someone has already passed through this place,\u201d someone remarked.\u201cAll the way down\u2026 Oh, there are some black yaks over there.\u201dThere were still black yaks left. What did that mean?\u201cI don\u2019t see any dead Players. That\u2019s gotta mean they ran away.\u201dAs far as they knew, only two Players had entered ahead of them. It wasn\u2019t strange that they had fled after hunting this many black yaks; it was possible they had run low on stamina.\u201cThey definitely ran away,\u201d said Joohwan with certainty. \u201cHow about kicking things off by killing those guys to stretch our bodies a little?\u201dThe group began to fight in their own way.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *They kept hunting \u2018black yaks\u2019 in the 2nd path as well. In \u2018Dyugo\u2019s Path\u2019, the item \u2018Dyugo\u2019s Necklace\u2019 dropped.[You have acquired Dyugo\u2019s Necklace.]Hyukjin shrugged. \u2018We had good luck this time.\u2019They only had to kill four black yaks before the item dropped. Sunhwa had picked up on his intent, and upon seeing him pick up the item, she quipped, \u201cAre we going to the 3rd path now?\u201dKilling black yaks wasn\u2019t the important thing. Getting those items was what was important. She gained an understanding regarding \u2018key items\u2019.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d[You have entered the Seoul Station Dungeon 3rd Forked Path, Delansha\u2019s Path.]Slightly different monsters appeared on Delansha\u2019s Path. They looked basically the same as black yaks, but they were purple in color. These \u2018purple yaks\u2019 were about 1-2 levels higher than black yaks.\u201cSunhwa. You take the lead.\u201d\u201cM-Me?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dSunhwa inched forward. Hyukjin walked behind the petite girl. Just then, something came hurtling their way.\u201cKyaa!\u201dSomething crashed into Sunhwa\u2019s forehead with a clack before falling to the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You won\u2019t die.\u201d\u201cW-What was that just now?\u201d\u201cA horn.\u201d\u201cA\u00a0horn?\u201d\u201cYeah. A horn shot by a purple yak. They\u2019re basically ranged attackers.\u201d That was why he put Sunhwa in the front. \u201cYou\u2019re sturdier than me, so it\u2019s better for you to get hit than me.\u201d\u201cO-Oppa! Kyak!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. See, you\u2019re not dying.\u201dIt was true. The purple yak horns couldn\u2019t damage Sunhwa at all.More \u2018purple yak\u2019 horns came shooting towards them. Still not completely used to Playing, Sunhwa screamed every time, even though there was zero impact to her body. After a while, the two of them heard a notice.[You have killed Purple Yaks.][EXP acquired.][13 Coins acquired.]Sunhwa was somewhat slack-jawed. She simply stood and took some hits, but the purple yak croaked all on its own. Without understanding the reason, she continued walking forward and spotted the \u2018purple yak\u2019 bodies on the ground.\u201cThese guys die after shooting their horns twice.\u201dRealization dawned on Sunhwa. \u201cE-Even so, did you just use me as a shield?\u201d\u201cYeah. You\u2019re a tank, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cS-Still.\u201d\u201cWell, even if you die, it\u2019s you who\u2019s kicking the bucket and not me, so whatever,\u201d Hyukjin said, cracking a joking smile. \u201cRight then. Go forth, my amazing Miss Tank.\u201dTo Players, things like age or gender weren\u2019t important. Only their class, stats, Guardian, and skills were important. Sunhwa had far more \u2018tanking ability\u2019 than Hyukjin. If each Player had a \u2018total score\u2019, his number would be far higher, but she would have the higher score when it came to \u2018damage tanking ability\u2019.Surprisingly, Sunhwa seemed to be moved by his offhand comment.\u201cI\u2019m amazing?\u201d\u201cMore than expected, I guess?\u201dShe looked happy for a moment, but her expression soon turned strange as she mumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s true I\u2019m a tanker, but\u2026\u201dShe really wasn\u2019t used to it. This oppa who used her, a 14-year-old, very petite kid, as a shield\u2026 could she really believe in him? Of course, she\u00a0did\u00a0believe him. She\u00a0did,\u00a0but still, something about it made her feel a little unsure.Hyukjin chuckled. \u201cGet your head on straight. You\u2019re not just a 14-year-old kid. This is a dungeon, and you\u2019re a Player.\u201dWhen Playing, everyone had to do what they were good at. He didn\u2019t put Sunhwa in the front just because he didn\u2019t want to get hit by purple yak horns. He had recognized Sunhwa\u2019s talent early on, and as long as he didn\u2019t intend on throwing her away and would continue to walk forward with her in the future, she had to get used to experiences like this. Hyukjin spoke jokingly in order to help her relax, but this was absolutely not a joke. In fact, making her take the lead like this was also a good thing for Sunhwa\u2019s growth.\u2018I may know all the strategies, but there\u2019s no doubt about it. Playing is dangerous.\u2019With the danger came a need for everyone to be faithful to their own roles. Rather, they had to be\u00a0good\u00a0at their roles. That was the correct thing to say.[You have acquired Delansha\u2019s Bracelet.]\u2018Delansha\u2019s Bracelet\u2019 was the item that dropped from the 3rd forked path, \u2018Delansha\u2019s Path\u2019. They had collected the items from three out of the seven paths.\u201cWe\u2019re just leaving the rest of the purple yaks, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cIt seems like the purple yaks give a lot of EXP, though\u2026\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dPurple yaks were certainly foes that gave a lot of EXP. With a good tank like Sunhwa around, killing them was also easy.\u201cIs there\u2026 a reason why you\u2019re leaving them?\u201dThat went without saying.\u201cDo you think we\u2019re the only ones who came in here?\u201dSunhwa didn\u2019t understand what those words meant. In her eyes, Hyukjin was an \u2018adult\u2019 who knew a great many things, and she thought it was only natural for her not to understand all the words of an adult.Hyukjin shrugged and walked back.\u201cWe have to leave those guys here to slow down the small fry.\u201dBecause if the past repeated itself, Seo Joohwan had definitely entered the dungeon.* * *So Yoohyun and Seo Joohwan\u2019s group killed all of the black yaks in the 1st fork.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing special around.\u201dKim Hyukjin had already acquired \u2018Nepalas\u2019 Ring\u2019. The only reward that could be gained now from the 1st forked path were the EXP and Coins gained from hunting \u2018black yaks\u2019.Joohwan scowled. \u201cThey\u2019ve got frickin\u2019 good defense, but give shit EXP.\u201dYoohyun nodded. The cost-effectiveness of black yaks was the worst.\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t known that the horns were their weak spot, we might have had a really tough time.\u201d\u201cStill, as expected of the Tutorial Ender, you\u2019re indeed outrageous. If someone like me were to get hit by that fist of yours, they\u2019d die in one hit,\u201d said Joohwan, making idle chatter.\u201cI think we\u2019ve killed everything here, so shall we go to another path?\u201dNot a single person even thought of trying the kind of Playing Hyukjin had shown, where he was basically \u2018soloing\u2019. After all, they had seen the horrors of Jongno not too long ago. Because they remembered the Tutorial Field, where 145,000 out of 150,000 had perished, neither Yoohyun nor Joohwan were able to consider moving on their own.[You have entered the Seoul Station Dungeon 2nd Forked Path, \u2018Dyugo\u2019s Path\u2019.]There weren\u2019t many bodies in the 2nd fork, only four. The fact there were some dead monsters meant that someone had hunted here, but there were still many living black yaks. However, there was no Player body. It was at this point that Yoohyun began to feel that something was a little strange.\u2018What is it?\u2019Did the Player who was in the 1st path go into the 2nd one before running again? It was difficult to figure out. While he was thinking, Joohwan said, \u201cFor now, let\u2019s catch \u2018em.\u201dThey caught all the black yaks remaining in the 2nd pathway. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to them, Hyukjin acquired the \u2018Athenia\u2019s Necklace\u2019 from the 4th fork, \u2018Athenia\u2019s Path\u2019, and the \u2018Zenith\u2019s Cudgel\u2019 from the 5th fork, \u2018Zenith\u2019s Path\u2019.When Hyukjin and Sunhwa were in the 6th path, Yoohyun and Joohwan\u2019s party went into the 3rd. There, both Yoohyun and Joohwan finally caught on.\u201cThey didn\u2019t run away; they left them,\u201d said Joohwan, scowling.\u201cI think so as well.\u201d\u201cThere must be key items for clearing the dungeon.\u201dJoohwan felt slightly incensed. He couldn\u2019t be sure whether the mystery Player left the monsters here on purpose or not, but he felt a spike of irritation knowing that there was someone stepping far ahead of him.\u2018Who the hell is it?\u2019He was with the Tutorial Ender, So Yoohyun, so who would dare to step ahead? While leaving only small fry for them to deal with, no less.Yoohyun looked serious. \u201cLet\u2019s just leave the monsters and go to the other paths.\u201dWhile they were discussing, Hyukjin got the \u2018Victoria\u2019s Shield\u2019 from the 6th path. Yoohyun and Joohwan\u2019s party followed right on his heels.In the end, they all came face to face in the 7th forked path.* * *Even before we entered the 7th forked path, I knew other people would come looking for us.\u2018That was slower than I expected.\u2019To be honest, I thought we would meet at around the 6th path, but they were a little slower. They were certainly still beginner Players.\u2018Figures. From their point of view, this is all completely new to them.\u2019They were different from me, who had the strategy guides memorized by heart. I\u2019d seen the Seoul Station Dungeon strategy video on Youtube probably close to thirty times. From the very beginning, our starting points were different.Sunhwa and I met the other Players in the 7th fork.\u2018Fist King So Yoohyun.\u2019I immediately activated Eye of Perception.[Player]Name: So YoohyunAge: 20Level: 17Class: \u2013Guardian: \u2013State: Gladness / SurpriseDisposition: Neutral / Just / Generous / Narrow-mindedSummary: Debt-Repaying MagpieClass has not yet been selected.Guardian has not yet been selected.The state/disposition/summary only show the most representative and can change according to the situation.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible.His level was 17, a very outstanding number. There was something other than his level that shocked me.\u2018What\u2019s with his disposition?\u2019 Neutral and just were fine, but\u2026 \u2018How can he be both generous and narrow-minded at the same time?\u2019Was Eye of Perception broken? The results were clear, but I didn\u2019t quite understand. I didn\u2019t actually think Eye of Perception\u2019s analysis was wrong. It must be that when it came to some things, So Yoohyun could be very generous, and in others, narrow-minded. His summary was \u2018Debt-Repaying Magpie\u2019, in reference to the Korean folktale of the magpie that gave its life to repay its debt to the farmer who saved its chicks. It wasn\u2019t a bad summary.\u2018So Yoohyun isn\u2019t the important one right now.\u2019That man who had a strange smile on his lips while looking at me, I knew him.\u2018He still looks young, but\u2026\u2019He was as young as the Fist King.[Player]Name: Seo JoohwanAge: 21Level: 16Class: \u2013Guardian: \u2013State: Lust / DispleasureDisposition: Evil / Violent / FakeSummary: Violent PedophileClass has not yet been selected.Guardian has not yet been selected.The disposition and traits/summary only show the most representative and can change according to the situation.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible.We were still in the early stages of Playing, but even though he had just come out of the Tutorial Field, in my eyes, he looked rotten to the core.\u2018So we meet here.\u2019 I had expected it. \u2018Seo Joohwan.\u2019Later, there would be a massive organization called \u2018Nightmare\u2019. It went by the alias \u2018Demon King Army\u2019. Seo Joohwan would be one of the famous lieutenants of that Demon King Army.\u2018What a disgusting summary.\u2019He was the first \u2018evil\u2019 alignment Player I was meeting, though he hadn\u2019t completely blackened yet. Even so, I needed to exercise utmost caution when dealing with him.\u2018If Seo Joohwan moves as I expect\u2026\u2019It could just so happen that today, I would have to fight him to the death. I had already foreseen this situation and had come prepared.\u2018If we truly end up fighting\u2026 the one who will put their life on the line won\u2019t be me, but you, Seo Joohwan.\u2019Just then, I saw him opening his mouth. His first words were rather unexpected.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: MandraThe Demon King Army.The brutal atrocities they committed were indescribable. This was slightly off topic, but the eight Heroes representing Korea earned their hero titles while confronting the Demon King Army. Most of their heroic tales originated from battles against the Demon King Army.\u2018In other words, the Demon King Army is strong enough to resist and fight those heroes.\u2019In any case, it was valid to say that having become a lieutenant of the Demon King Army, he\u2019d run the gamut of all sorts of despicable deeds, though that hadn\u2019t happened yet.\u201cHello! Didn\u2019t think there was a senior here.\u201dSeo Joohwan made a rather polite bow. It was unexpected, but I understood after a beat.Disposition: Fake\u2018Fake\u2019 was unmistakably mixed into his disposition. He greeted me with a good-natured expression, but I was determined not to let my guard down.\u201cOn the way to the 7th fork, we saw that the monsters had already been killed. Was that you, senior?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI looked at So Yoohyun. He was blinking at me in a daze, obviously very surprised.\u201c\u2026You were al\u2014\u201dI cut him off. \u201cNice to meet you. You must be So Yoohyun, the Tutorial Ender. I saw you on TV.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 I\u2026 Ah\u2026 Yes. I mean, yes, thank you. You\u2019re too kind. I\u2019m truly humbled and don\u2019t know what to say.\u201dAfter floundering for a short moment at my \u2018nice to meet you\u2019, Yoohyun promptly expressed his modesty. It seemed he really meant it when he said \u2018you\u2019re too kind\u2019.However, the look in his eyes towards me spoke volumes. They were filled with goodwill. I could feel through Eye of Perception that his look went beyond goodwill, almost into adoration. Those were Yoohyun\u2019s sincere feelings. The \u2018Debt-Repaying Magpie\u2019 summary truly suited him to a T.\u201cWe\u2019ve come as support,\u201d Seo Joohwan said. \u201cLet\u2019s work together.\u201dI stared at Seo Joohwan. \u201cI wonder about that. You\u2019ve seen the other paths already, I\u2019m sure?\u201dSunhwa and I had cleared most of the monsters in the forks. We had left the rest of the monsters simply because we didn\u2019t need them.Seo Joohwan was struck speechless for a moment. \u201c\u2026That\u2019s true. You\u2019re doing perfectly fine on your own already.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut couldn\u2019t you achieve a slightly more desirable clear with our help? This place isn\u2019t a dungeon with a set owner, anyway.\u201dHe was being roundabout, but what he was implying was, \u2018You\u2019re not the owner either, so you can\u2019t refuse us\u2019.\u2018Right, Seo Joohwan was one of the first people to assert that dungeons had owners,\u2019 I thought. Later dungeons fell under the possession of individual guilds. They taxed things like the items and Coins that were obtained from the dungeons at their own discretion, solely on the basis that they owned the dungeon. Later on, wars were even waged for dungeons. The Demon King Army committed murder for them without reserve.\u201cI think it will be fine if everyone Plays on their own. However, there\u2019s an item I\u2019m looking for. The Guardians said they wanted it.\u201dI sold off the Guardians.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 expresses their misgivings.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 expresses her disappointment.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is happy.]The Guardians didn\u2019t really like it when their names were used in vain. However, I had no choice. I couldn\u2019t just carelessly give off the \u2018I know everything\u2019 feeling. This was the easiest road available to me.\u2018Is the Whispering Devil a pervert?\u2019I did something Guardians usually didn\u2019t like, but the Whispering Devil was happy about it.\u201cI\u2019d also gladly Play with everyone. But I would like to ask that if an item bearing the name of this path, Lakitula, appears, that you concede it to me. Of course, I will fully compensate you.\u201dSo Yoohyun and Seo Joohwan seemed interested in the item I was looking for. Joohwan asked, \u201cAn item bearing the name Lakitula? Did other items like that appear in the other paths, as well?\u201dI expected a conversation like this to come about even before coming here. It was all a part of the picture I was drawing. There was no need to lie, and even if I did, it would be quickly exposed at the next checkpoint. There was no real reason to lie.\u201cYes, there were. I\u2019m working on a quest to gather the seven items.\u201d\u201cThere was a quest like that? We didn\u2019t get that.\u201dBecause I had already predicted such a situation, my response was also prepared in advance. \u201cIt is a quest given to the first person who enters.\u201d\u201cAha.\u201d Seo Joohwan seemed convinced.\u201cI think the item won\u2019t be of much use to you even if you get it. They don\u2019t really have any good effects. None of them are better than shop credit.\u201dThese guys had passed level 15, so they could also use the Item Shop.\u201cIf someone else ends up obtaining that item, I will buy it from them at a higher price than what is offered in the shop.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *On the 7th fork, \u2018Lakitula\u2019s Path\u2019, black and purple yaks appeared together.So Yoohyun extended his fist with a loud, rousing shout. \u201cHiyaa!\u201dOne black yak fell over.\u201cTaunt!\u201d\u2018!!!\u2019 marks appeared over the purple yaks\u2019 heads, indicating that their aggro had been properly pulled. Two purple yaks fired their horns, and while they were doing so, Seo Joohwan and the three members of his group quickly approached the purple yaks and killed them. As she watched, Kang Sunhwa felt a little odd.\u2018Those people are survivors of the Tutorial\u2026\u2019 There was another man. \u2018And that mister using his fists is the Tutorial Ender, right? That super famous guy.\u2019There was no doubt he was currently the most famous Player in the world.\u2018So why\u2026\u2019She might just be imagining it\u2026\u2018How come\u2026\u2019She didn\u2019t know exactly why, but\u2026\u2018They look so weak?\u2019Somehow, she got the feeling that they were weak. After a moment of contemplation, Sunhwa realized the reason.\u2018It\u2019s because I\u2019m comparing them to oppa.\u2019Be it Mr. So Yoohyun, the Tutorial Ender, or that nimble-looking Mr. Seo Joohwan, both of them had quick and concise movements, but\u2014\u2018Compared to Hyukjin oppa\u2026\u2019She couldn\u2019t help but think that they fell far short. But something else was strange, and it was that Hyukjin wasn\u2019t showing his full prowess.\u2018Oppa\u2019s movements have gotten much slower and cruder than before.\u2019Sunhwa couldn\u2019t be sure whether he was doing it on purpose, or if he was just tired. In any case, as it was right now, Hyukjin, Yoohyun, and Joohwan all looked to have about the same level of skill, though their Playing styles were a bit different. What was significant was the fact that only 14-year-old Kang Sunhwa was able to precisely compare their movements. However, Sunhwa herself did not think of that as an impressive feat. She wasn\u2019t even cognizant of what she was doing.* * *The person who acquired the item was none other than Seo Joohwan.\u201cI got the item.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Lakutula\u2019s Earrings. It has no defense or durability, so it\u2019s nearly about to fall apart. It\u2019s also got no special effects. You really want to buy this?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s a quest item, after all.\u201dJoohwan nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll just give it to you, then. Take it as a sign of my goodwill to you, senior,\u201d he said with a smile. It was a friendly smile, but I didn\u2019t really like it. I activated Eye of Perception again.Disposition: Evil / Violent / FakeSummary: Violent PedophileThis was definitely not goodwill. He might call it goodwill now, but I didn\u2019t want to accept it at all.\u201cI appreciate the thought, but I won\u2019t accept goodwill without good reason. Your intent is enough for me.\u201d\u201cOh, come on, senior. Why so rigid? And if I won\u2019t sell it?\u201dFor a moment, Seo Joohwan\u2019s eyes subtly changed. They quickly returned to normal, but I didn\u2019t miss the change.He had clearly thought that Hyukjin and Sunhwa were extremely strong at first.\u2018But he probably felt that we weren\u2019t much after actually fighting together.\u2019I purposely didn\u2019t show my full strength, matching my skill level to Yoohyun and Joohwan, and that had quickly drawn out Joohwan\u2019s true colors. He was still calling me \u2018senior\u2019 and acting polite, but I could faintly feel venomous fangs hidden behind his smiling fa\u00e7ade.\u2018Because you have a talent more specialized to hunting Players than hunting monsters.\u2019After a beat, Seo Joohwan laughed with a \u2018haha\u2019. \u201cJust kidding, just kidding. It\u2019s useless to me anyway. I\u2019ll sell it for just 500 Coins.\u201dTo get 500 Coins, you had to kill a staggering forty black yaks. For reference, the \u2018Beginner Iron Sword\u2019 in the Item Shop cost 500 Coins. The \u2018Lakitula\u2019s Earrings\u2019 could probably be sold in the Shop for about 15 Coins at most. It was neither expensive nor cheap, but somewhere vaguely in between.\u201cAlright.\u201dThe trade system could not be used inside dungeons. As such, I took out 500 Coins from my Inventory, and Seo Joohwan passed over the \u2018Lakitula\u2019s Earrings\u2019 like a trade in real life. With that, the trade was complete.I stowed away the item. \u201cLet\u2019s move.\u201dThe group led by So Yoohyun and Seo Joohwan ended up being led by me, a change that occurred all too naturally.* * *I went through the 7th fork with So Yoohyun and Seo Joohwan.\u2018After this, we\u2019ll reach the Statue of Mandra.\u2019When we reached the end of the 7th fork, a clearing appeared.[You have reached the \u2018Plaza of Mandra\u2019.]In the underground cavern, I spotted a stone statue some distance away.[The \u2018Statue of Mandra\u2019 opens its eyes.]The stone statue\u2019s eyes flashed open. Frightened, Sunhwa clutched the hem of my clothes. An androgynous voice that was neither female nor male echoed through the cavern.[Who has awakened me from my slumber?]I walked towards the statue bearing the \u2018Mandra\u2019 name.[One without qualifications. You shan\u2019t escape punishment.]The cavern began to quake, making it feel like something dangerous was about to happen. Pebbles fell from the ceiling.\u201cI have come to prove my qualifications.\u201dThe Seoul Station Dungeon was a \u2018beginner\u2019 dungeon. It didn\u2019t involve complicated, bizarre tricks or solutions. All you had to do was clear it straight and simple with a frontal assault.[Prove your qualifications.]A red light shot out from the Statue of Mandra like a laser pointer and focused on my chest. If I messed up here, my heart would be penetrated and I would die. Before coming into the Seoul Station Dungeon, I reviewed the process again and again, coming here only after running at least a hundred simulations in my head to avoid making any mistakes.\u2018In order.\u2019Any mistake would be my death. Before the strategy was discovered, within the scope of the beginner grade, the Seoul Station Dungeon was considered to be nearly impossible to clear.\u2018I\u2019ll die if I make a mistake.\u2019But I made no mistakes. I thought of the order once again in my mind.1st. Nepalas\u2019 Path.2nd. Dyugo\u2019s Path.\u2026\u20267th. Lakitula\u2019s Path.You had to put the items on the Statue of Mandra in order. An inventory window appeared before my eyes, probably visible only to me. Just like when a Player equipped an item, I had to drag items with my eyes into that inventory window.\u2018As I thought, it\u2019s the same.\u2019It was exactly the same as what I had seen in Youtube videos. I went through seven prompts.[Transfer Nepalas\u2019 Ring? Y/N]\u2026\u2026[Transfer Lakitula\u2019s Earrings? Y/N]I answered \u2018Y\u2019 to all seven prompts. The items were equipped on the \u2018Statue of Mandra\u2019, one after another. Then, the red light coming from the statue\u2019s eyes disappeared, and the tremors shaking the cavern subsided as well.[You have proven your qualifications.][Speaker. Your name is?]The question I had been waiting for so eagerly appeared at last.\u2018Finally.\u2019I had gathered the seven items in order to be asked this question.\u201cMy name is\u2026\u201dI wasn\u2019t going to say Kim Hyukjin, my real name. If I said my name, I would get an ordinary reward. I decided to give the answer that Mandra wanted to hear.I would be the first to use the ultimate clearing method that had been discovered by the Great Explorer, \u2018Jackson\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Mandra (2)The Great Explorer, \u2018Jackson\u2019, was known to have cleared the \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon\u2019 at least 300 times. He said this about the dungeon:[In Latin, mandra means stable.]Jackson interpreted the name \u2018Mandra\u2019 as stable or barn, and was said to have tried various answers based on his interpretation.Finally, I found the correct clearing method for the Seoul Station Dungeon.Simply saying your name would give you so-so rewards, exactly the right kind of items for a beginner dungeon. Of course, they weren\u2019t bad. However, they didn\u2019t quite deserve to be called a \u2018Hidden Piece\u2019.\u201cMy name is\u2026\u201dJackson\u2019s strategy guide was like a rulebook for beginners, and I had memorized it from cover to end. He had said it like this:[The correct answer is\u00a0Rancher.]\u201cYour master, the one who has granted you new life. I am Rancher.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Mandra Statue began to shake. Finding my response curious, Seo Joohwan and So Yoohyun were unable to tear their eyes away from me. The statue had asked me for my name, but I had answered in English as \u2018Rancher\u2019.The Great Explorer Jackson\u2019s strategy was indeed correct.[Greetings to my master.]I heard a notice.[You have found the \u2018correct answer\u2019.][You have fulfilled the Hidden Piece.]Notices from Guardians flooded in at the same time.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 tilts their head.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is surprised.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is feeling great interest.]Yes, that was only natural. I could guess that the Guardians were getting just as heated as I was. They viewed Playing as their one and only amusement and stimulant. For them, I would become an incredible stimulant. I was aware of that fact, and would use it properly to my advantage.Golden light began to emerge from Mandra\u2019s body.[Master, please select one.]A hologram appeared before my eyes, visible only to me. There were three choices listed on it.[Choose a Reward]Mandra\u2019s CuirassMandra\u2019s GreatswordMandra\u2019s GlovesI already knew these choices would appear. In the meantime, Seo Joohwan asked, \u201cIt seems you\u2019ve been given something special\u2026 We should wait, right?\u201d\u201cI would be grateful if you would wait a moment. I think one minute will suffice.\u201dWhile I had been distracted, Eye of Perception had picked up something nasty. Seo Joohwan\u2019s lecherous gaze had repeatedly landed on Sunhwa. He wouldn\u2019t actually do anything, but that disgusting gaze was unpleasant. However, I didn\u2019t show my disgust outwardly. After all, nothing good would come from revealing to the world that I could read someone\u2019s emotions, disposition, and special traits.I picked a reward without hesitation.\u201cI\u2019ll take the gloves.\u201dMandra nodded.[Understood. I offer you my gloves. I hope these gloves become a gift that help forge your path forward.]I already knew the effects, but I still checked the gloves.[Mandra\u2019s Gloves]Mandra\u2019s Gloves have a special effect. They have a special resistance to \u2018poison\u2019 and will protect the wearer from countless infectious diseases.Defense: 2Effects: Poison resistance +3The notices came in.[You have passed \u2018Mandra\u2019s Test\u2019.][The \u2018Plaza of Mandra\u2019 has been cleared.][The next scenario quest, \u2018Two Forked Paths\u2019, will proceed.]A quest was issued.[Two Forked Paths]The final crossroad of the Seoul Station Dungeon. Find the appropriate clear conditions to complete the Seoul Station Dungeon. If you cannot clear the dungeon, a Dungeon Break will occur. At least one Player must enter each passage.Not far in the distance, I saw two forked pathways. The \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon\u2019 was a dungeon that had a fundamentally forked structure. The difficulty of both paths were about the same.Seo Joohwan was the first to speak. \u201cI analyzed the best way to proceed, and\u2026\u201dI could feel a repulsive nastiness coming from him via Eye of Perception. His obscene gaze towards Sunhwa was extremely unpleasant.\u201cAs you all know, I am the type of DPS who moves quickly to strike weak points. It\u2019s a class that can perform very well in combination with a reliable tank, like Miss Sunhwa.\u201d Joohwan continued, \u201cI think that it would be good to form a team with me, Sunhwa, and two people from my group. The other pathway can be handled by Yoohyun-nim, Hyukjin-nim, and the other person from my group. The balance should be right that way.\u201dTN: -nim is a formal honorific to express respect.On the outside, he made it seem like he was paying heed to balance. However, I had no intention of letting Sunhwa go. At least, not to a sickening bastard with a summary of \u2018Violent Pedophile\u2019.\u201cNo,\u201d I responded flatly.Seo Joohwan didn\u2019t look all that surprised. \u201cPlease tell me why.\u201d\u201cSunhwa is like a little sister to me. In fact, my mother is considering adopting her. I will act with Sunhwa.\u201dI was curious as to how Seo Joohwan, a lieutenant of the Demon King Army I knew from the past, would respond.\u201cEven though I conceded the item to you with good grace\u2026 Won\u2019t it be bad from an efficiency standpoint?\u201d\u201cEfficiency? From the start, I was planning on clearing this dungeon with just me and Sunhwa.\u201d\u201cAnd you think it\u2019s possible with just the two of you? Even the Intermediate Administrators recommended seven Players. Think carefully.\u201dHis eyes weren\u2019t good-natured anymore. It couldn\u2019t quite be called openly rude, but there was no real goodwill to be found, either. The look in his eyes had changed from before.\u201cIf I had thought it impossible, I wouldn\u2019t have come in.\u201d\u201cYou sure have a great deal of confidence.\u201dI could feel Joohwan\u2019s emotions. Whenever someone felt intense emotions, Eye of Perception picked it up without fail. If I were to put it into words, he was cursing me as a \u2018irritating son of a bitch\u2019 right now.\u201cIt seems you have met a Guardian who is providing you a lot of information and benefits.\u201d\u201cWell, something like that.\u201dI didn\u2019t get a scrap of information from the Guardians, but it was a decent reason to convince Seo Joohwan, who promptly grinned.\u201cIf you have received information from a Guardian\u2026 That must effectively mean that Miss Sunhwa and Hyukjin-nim\u2026 are capable of clearing this dungeon with the two of you, correct?\u201dIt was effectively correct. Sunhwa and I could clear this dungeon on our own. I saw Joohwan\u2019s eyes sparkle, and I knew the reason why.\u2018You think you and I are on the same level?\u2019He probably thought so. I had hidden my skills in order to make him think that.\u2018That\u2019s why you\u2019ll probably assume that if I can clear it, you can clear it too.\u2019It wasn\u2019t strange that he would misunderstand. From the start, I had saved my strength in order to make him think that. I wanted to see just how he would react now.\u201cThen, how would you like to proceed, senior? Since you were planning on clearing the dungeon with Sunhwa as a pair\u2026 Will just the two of you go into one pathway?\u201d he asked. He continued a moment later, \u201cBut if you do that, we\u2019ll be too unbalanced, so\u2026 Let\u2019s do it like this, instead. How about our group moving as one unit and Yoohyun-nim going to the other side?\u201dHe gave a cunning smile. I checked his disposition again with Eye of Perception, clearly seeing one word on the list.Disposition: FakePerhaps noticing that the mood had turned a little strange, So Yoohyun intervened. \u201cThat sounds good. I will move to the other party.\u201dAnd so, the parties were divvied up\u2014me, Sunhwa, and Yoohyun in one team, Joohwan and the three Players he led in the other. Their side only had damage dealers.Seo Joohwan headed to the right forked pathway first. \u201cWell then, I wish you the best of luck.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *I went into the left fork. As soon as we separated from Joohwan\u2019s group, So Yoohyun spoke up. \u201cYou seemed very unhappy.\u201dFrom Yoohyun\u2019s point of view, it was probably strange that I blatantly made things difficult for Seo Joohwan. I had never really shown him any goodwill, even though he hadn\u2019t shown any reason to deserve such cold treatment.\u201cYes. I don\u2019t really like that kind of person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI decided not to say too much. I wouldn\u2019t say that the man would become a named Player of an organization called \u2018Nightmare\u2019 in the future, or that his current dominant disposition was \u2018fake\u2019, or that his summary was \u2018pedophile\u2019. Nor would I tell him that he hadn\u2019t noticed, but that bastard had been looking at Sunhwa with a dirty gaze. There was no need to say those things, and I had no reason to convince him of anything.Notices came in.[You have entered the first forked path.][Please reach the end of the path.][There will be a \u2018clue to the clear\u2019 at the end of the path.]The notices aside, Yoohyun easily accepted my half-assed explanation of \u2018I just don\u2019t like him\u2019.\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201dAnd then, he suddenly reached out and grabbed my hand. I almost shook him off by instinct. I didn\u2019t have a perverted disposition like Seo Joohwan, and I didn\u2019t swing that way either. Simply put, a man\u2019s hand? No thanks. I very nearly attacked him.\u201cYou are the person who saved me, correct?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI am sure I saw you in the D-Tower\u2019s 2nd floor. The two heroes who left with the magic troll.\u201dHm. He seemed to be remembering things a little strangely. It wasn\u2019t that we left\u00a0with\u00a0the magic troll. We had fled for our lives\u00a0from\u00a0the magic troll.\u201cAll of my teammates died there\u2026 but I survived. I owe you my life.\u201dOh. Hm. So, um. That\u2019s\u2026 Is that how it was?\u201cYou are my hero.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease give me a chance to repay you. I\u2019m very good at repaying favors.\u201dI had no idea how to respond. I desperately wanted to tear my hand away, but it was a little tricky to do so with those big, glistening eyes shining at me. This was the reason why I couldn\u2019t really shake off his hand:State: Goodwill / Respect / Adoration / GratitudeI didn\u2019t go out of my way to activate Eye of Perception, but I could very clearly feel what kinds of emotions this person had towards me. So Yoohyun\u2026 was being completely sincere. Sincerity was overflowing from every pore of his body.\u201cIf it is alright with you, may I call you hyungnim?\u201dTN: Hyungnim is a respectful form of hyung, used by a male to refer to an older male.\u201cBut we\u2019re the same age?\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter, does it? You are my life\u2019s savior.\u201dI scratched my head. This thing called Eye of Perception was really nice and all, but it was pointlessly sensitive and forced me to understand a person\u2019s inner feelings far too well. So Yoohyun\u2019s sincerity was relayed to me loud and clear through Eye of Perception. Was this guy always so simple and honest?\u201cWell\u2026 do as you please.\u201d\u201cPlease speak casually to me, hyungnim.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSunhwa smiled, as if finding the situation very amusing. \u201cBut you know, Hyukjin oppa is oppa. And Yoohyun mister is a mister. So if mister\u2019s hyung is oppa, then what should I call you?\u201d After contemplating on her lonesome, Sunhwa also came to a conclusion on her own, and very quickly. \u201cMister is still mister. And oppa is oppa. That settles it.\u201dYoohyun\u2019s brow wrinkled a little at being called a \u2018mister\u2019, but he didn\u2019t show his feelings openly.\u201cBut\u2026 it feels like you are staying here on purpose. Am I correct?\u201dThis man, So Yoohyun, was pretty quick on the uptake.\u201cYou are correct.\u201d\u201cCome now, hyungnim. Like I said, please speak casually.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI nodded.\u00a0Fine, okay.\u00a0It shouldn\u2019t be a bad thing to have the future Fist King as my little brother. It wasn\u2019t like I forced him or anything. This was what he wanted, so there wasn\u2019t any reason to refuse, was there?\u201cYeah,\u201d I repeated, more casually this time.\u201cWhy? Is there some genuine secret I don\u2019t know about?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll find out if we wait here a little.\u201dYoohyun didn\u2019t question me, and neither did Sunhwa. Waiting at the Safe Zone without leaving was a strange thing to do, but the two of them waited patiently.After about ten minutes, we heard a notice.[A new Player is entering.][The Safe Zone will be deactivated, as the limit of five Players has been exceeded.]There was only one reason why I had waited without expending my stamina. It was because I predicted that the others would enter our path, though I hoped my prediction wouldn\u2019t come true.\u201cDid they already clear the other path, hyungnim?\u201dI knew Seo Joohwan would come here. I also knew he would stab me in the back. I knew he had a summary of \u2018Violent Pedophile\u2019, and that his disgusting gaze had been straying towards Sunhwa.And I knew one last thing.That the current Seo Joohwan was no match for me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: Second Innate AbilityI stared at Seo Joohwan and his group of three, numbering four in total.He said to me, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem all that surprised?\u201dHis way of speech had suddenly become very casual. I, of course, responded in the same manner.\u201cI had a vague idea of what you would do. Though I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d really go for it.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d He smirked. \u201cThen we can cut the useless chatter.\u201dHe took out his weapon, the \u2018dagger\u2019. He had come here determined.\u201cThere\u2019s no video surveillance here and no police to protect you, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware.\u201dOf course I was. There were tons of cases where people went into dungeons and their bodies could not even be found. Murders occurred frequently within. Later on, the Players Association would be established and there would be implicit promises and rules between Players, but that was a thing of the future.\u201cYour reason for doing this?\u201d\u201cI just find you really annoying. You\u2019re real irritating, see?\u201d Seo Joohwan stared at me in distaste before adding one more thing. \u201cBut if you give me that girl, I\u2019ll let you go this time.\u201dSeo Joohwan turned to Yoohyun and offered him the proposal as well. \u201cHow about it, Yoohyun? All you have to do is give me that girl and this situation can be settled nice and neatly.\u201dSunhwa clutched the hem of my clothes. I could feel how small her hand was, just how small a 14-year-old girl just barely out of elementary school was.\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re asking for Sunhwa,\u201d I said.Actually, I knew the truth. His summary had laid his nature bare.Summary: Violent PedophileIn other words, he was a psychopath. I stared at the man. Right now, the Seo Joohwan in my eyes didn\u2019t look that strong.\u201cYou said it. There are no surveillance cameras here.\u201dThat also applies to you, you psychopath.He snickered. \u201cWhat? You can\u2019t be thinking of fighting us, right? I\u2019m sure Yoohyun will be neutral. You think you and that tiny little girl will be a match for us four?\u201dI was so dumbfounded I had to laugh. What in the world had him so confident that Yoohyun would be neutral?Yoohyun also clarified. \u201cBut I\u2019m on hyungnim\u2019s side?\u201d he said, his raised fists making him seem like a cow determined to butt heads with Seo Joohwan.That didn\u2019t seem to faze our opponent much. \u201cWell, whatever. I\u2019ve already seen the full extent of your skills.\u201d His eyes grew serious. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one last chance.\u201dEye of Perception relayed an electrifying sensation to me. It was as if a sharp blade were pricking my body. I had learned this feeling through Eye of Perception.\u2018Murderous intent.\u2019It was his bloodthirst, his desire to kill someone. That man was serious right now.He spoke, as if giving a final warning. \u201cWe\u2019re about tied when it comes to hunting monsters. But I\u2014\u201dKnowing what he was about to say, I cut in. \u201cHave an ability specialized for PVP.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJoohwan was briefly taken aback, having had the words taken from his mouth. However, he quickly recovered his relaxed air.\u201cYou\u2019re well-informed.\u201dI smiled. \u201cHave you learned Shadow Ambush, at least?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe probably hadn\u2019t yet. He hadn\u2019t even advanced to a class. From his reaction, I could tell he hadn\u2019t learned any techniques like \u2018Shadow Ambush\u2019. If so, I wasn\u2019t all that worried.\u201cLet me ask you one more time.\u201d\u201cFeel free.\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t give you Sunhwa, you really intend on killing us?\u201dSeo Joohwan grinned. \u201cI told you already. There\u2019s no surveillance here. This is really your last chance. Decide. Whether you\u2019ll all die, or just give that girl to me.\u201dBecause there were no police here, no laws. Because this was a dungeon.\u2018That\u2019s right. That\u2019s the sort of place this is.\u2019I hadn\u2019t forgotten. I hadn\u2019t experienced it before in the past, but the dungeons during the beginning period were all lawless zones.\u201cHow about it? Decided in your heart?\u201d\u201cMy answer to you is\u2026\u201dThis.I shot towards Seo Joohwan first, bending slightly for a takedown tackle.\u2018He\u2019ll dodge.\u2019I could see his movements as clearly as day. His trajectory, and how he would move, they were all drawn out in my head.\u201cYou crazy bastard\u2014!\u201dThe long-ranged DPS nocked an arrow at me, an action that was not lost on me. My Eye of Perception that had absorbed Sixth Sense completely read his movements.\u201cSlow.\u201dFrom the beginning, Joohwan wasn\u2019t my objective. My target was the irritating long-ranged DPS, Go Janghan.\u2018I hoped I wouldn\u2019t have to use it, but\u2026\u2019I twisted in place and used the \u2018thing\u2019 I had prepared in Janghan\u2019s direction.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *So Yoohyun was instantly stunned.\u2018Huh?\u2019It was already surprising that Kim Hyukjin had predicted all of this, but more surprising was that his movements were completely different from before.\u2018He was hiding his full strength?\u2019That was the only explanation. Hyukjin\u2019s movements were incredibly clean. Yoohyun had always been well-versed in various martial arts, and in his eyes, Hyukjin\u2019s movements just now looked like they had come from a long-time wrestler.\u2018He purposely\u2026 didn\u2019t show all of his strength,\u2019 Yoohyun realized. Hyukjin had done so exactly for a situation like this. That one movement just now had proven it without a trace of doubt.Yoohyun also steeled himself to fight. It was all or nothing.\u201cYou assholes.\u201dHe started running towards one Player. Just then, Kang Sunhwa jumped in.[Using the skill Platinum Shield.]Clang!A loud clang echoed out. Sunhwa had blocked Joohwan\u2019s dagger attack, protecting Yoohyun.\u201cThanks.\u201dThis child who was only 14, a kid whose talent plates hadn\u2019t even fully opened up yet, had read the attack of a man specialized in surprise attacks.[Using the skill Power Fist.]White light gathered in Yoohyun\u2019s fist. He landed his fist squarely in the abdomen of a Player.\u201cGugh!\u201dThe Player curled like a shrimp. At the same time, Kim Hyukjin approached and scattered something sweet-smelling.Hyukjin was sure of it.\u2018We can beat them.\u2019The other side had underestimated them too much.\u2018No, we\u00a0will\u00a0beat them.\u2019Yoohyun moved far better and faster than he expected. Sunhwa\u2019s sense for combat was second to none. She was completely different from the scared and cowering girl she had been moments before.\u2018The moment the battle started, Sunhwa completely changed.\u2019Sunhwa blocked a whopping three of Seo Joohwan\u2019s rather tricky attacks, even though she was breathing hard and trembling because she had used \u2018Platinum Shield\u2019 many times in succession.Hyukjin poured honey water over Seo Joohwan, like he had already done with Go Janghan. That was the honey his sister had bought for him. He had diluted it into honey water.\u201cThe fuck are you doing?!\u201dSeo Joohwan had the feeling that things were not going as planned. Both Yoohyun and Sunhwa were far stronger than he expected. He thought they\u2019d be able to overwhelm the three of them, but his group was the one getting overwhelmed.\u2018No, the problem isn\u2019t Yoohyun or Sunhwa.\u2019It wasn\u2019t them. The person completely responsible for this situation was Kim Hyukjin. His movements were difficult to chase. As if he were using some kind of special footwork, Hyukjin attacked them while nimbly dodging.\u2018Just how fucking high is his Agility?!\u2019Joohwan had invested a ton of his points into Agility. But Hyukjin was still faster. The rat weaved in and out, breaking their center of gravity. There were also Yoohyun\u2019s powerful blows to contend with, and Sunhwa blocked their occasional attacks.\u2018Fuck!\u2019That bastard. He had to catch that bastard. As long as they could do something about Hyukjin, everything would work out. He thought Yoohyun would be the biggest problem, but it was actually Hyukjin. Joohwan\u2019s entire body felt sticky. His hair and clothes were a mess of sweat and honey water.\u2018Is he trying to rile us up?\u2019Hyukjin could have easily gone for a fatal blow, but he didn\u2019t use any weapons and simply poured honey water on them.Booooom\u2013!Booooom\u2013!He started to hear loud booms coming from deeper along the pathway.* * *\u201cGet down!\u201dAt my shout, Yoohyun and Sunhwa immediately ducked. When we first came in here, I had told them in advance:[On the off chance that something happens, if I tell you to get down, get down no matter what\u2019s going on. Got it?]Both Yoohyun and Sunhwa got down immediately, as did I. A swarm of bees rushed past our heads. They were far bigger than regular bees, even bigger than the Asian giant hornets that were frequently called the scariest bees.[The attack of the Buzzing Bees has begun.]Buzzing Bee LVL 18Their individual levels weren\u2019t that high, but there were\u00a0thousands\u00a0of them in a swarm. Without a fire mage, it was better to not even consider trying to kill them.\u201cW-What the fuck?!?\u201dThe screams began.Buzzing Bees were very sensitive to sweet smells.\u201cU-Uaaaghhhhh!\u201d\u201cS-Save meeee!\u201d\u201cP-Please save me!\u201dAnd they had a habit of drinking Players\u2019 blood.\u201cI-I beg you\u2026!\u201cSave\u2026\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201dCovered from head to toe in thousands of Buzzing Bees, the screams of the four Players sticky with honey water became quieter and quieter.[The attack of the Buzzing Bees has ended.]Hundreds of Buzzing Bees that had become bloated from drinking too much blood had fallen to the ground, along with four Players who had become as desiccated as mummies.\u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019Eye of Perception couldn\u2019t sense anything from them anymore. There was no trace of life. Now, they could no longer be considered living.\u2018They died.\u2019Technically,\u00a0I\u00a0was the one who killed them.\u2018I don\u2019t\u2026 feel as much as I thought I would.\u2019I was more emotionless than I expected. Even though I had just committed murder, I didn\u2019t feel much guilt or pangs of conscience, nor was I nauseated or scared by the sight of those mummified bodies. I was so calm I was a little scared of myself.I cast one last glance at Seo Joohwan, whose body had become mummified.\u2018You brought this on yourself.\u2019If you were resolved to kill someone, you had to be resolved to meet your own death.The bodies were sucked dry of their blood. The Buzzing Bees scattered on the ground, round as balloons with blood. I had created this situation, almost like a conductor directing an orchestra.The reactions of the Guardians were mixed.[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is greatly disappointed in you.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is silent.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 claps his hands in glee.]Standing behind me, Yoohyun and Sunhwa held their silence for a moment. After all, what had just happened before them was not something they had seen in their everyday life. The calmest person here wasn\u2019t the future Fist King So Yoohyun, but actually me, Kim Hyukjin. The same Kim Hyukjin who had received a [No Talent] evaluation.I heard some notices.[A special situation has been exposed.][The System has recognized the situation as a PK (Player Kill).][Forcibly awakening your dormant Innate Ability due to your first PK.]I had already heard a notice like this before. Back when we were running from the magic troll, there was a notice like this. That was when I awakened my innate ability \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019, and that Sixth Sense had been fused into the \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 I currently possessed.\u2018I had another innate ability?\u2019Most Players only got one innate ability, and it was orthodox for it to unlock at around level 60. Fast Players would get it at around level 40. But I already had two of them.[Awakening your Innate Ability.]\u2018Huh?\u2019And to my surprise, that innate ability\u2026 was one I was already very familiar with.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Second Innate Ability (2)There were more notices.[The Innate Ability \u2018Eye for an Eye, Tooth for a Tooth\u2019 has been awakened.][Check the Innate Ability?]\u2018Eye for an Eye, Tooth for a Tooth\u2019 was among the relatively common innate abilities. However, there was a class Player who had won her fame with this ability as a foundation.\u2018Sword Empress Shin Yeonseo.\u2019The Sword Empress never revealed the name of her innate ability exactly as \u2018Eye for an Eye, Tooth for a Tooth\u2019.\u2018Hers was probably an innate ability of a higher grade.\u2019The innate ability of the Sword Empress ten years later was thought to be \u2018Hammurabi\u2019. Of course, that was just a guess\u2014it wasn\u2019t confirmed by the Sword Empress herself.\u2018In any case, they\u2019re the same in essence. There\u2019s a high chance this is the ability the Sword Empress started with.\u2019The Sword Empress\u2019 raiding capabilities were very outstanding, but her PVPing ability was even better than that. There were rumors on the Internet that the Fist King So Yoohyun and the Flame Lord Choi Sung-gu had lost in 1:1 PVP to the Sword Empress.\u2018I think she had a tie with the Typhoon, Jo Sunghyun, right?\u2019It was said that the Sword Empress had the higher skills, but Jo Sunghyun had the advantage in playstyle. The people in question didn\u2019t state it outright, but it was something known by most people who had an interest in \u2018Playing\u2019 or civil service students studying for the civil servant exam that had new questions every iteration based on the history the current figures wrote.[Status Window]Name: Kim Hyukjin (Player)Level: 18Title: [First Pioneer] [Excellent Player]Innate Ability: [Eye of Perception] [Eye for an Eye, Tooth for a Tooth]Strength: 17Intelligence: 17Agility: 23Perception: 17Constitution: 17Willpower: 17 (+30)Bonus stats: 6Random stats: 3Undistributed stats: 9I clicked the innate ability.[Eye for an Eye, Tooth for a Tooth]It\u2019s only right to return what is dealt to you, even more so if it\u2019s revenge.

Things like titles were also easier to upgrade the sooner they were given. With that in mind, I really wasn\u2019t sure if it was okay for me to get something like this in the \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon\u2019, a mere \u2018beginner\u2019 dungeon and essentially the \u2018first dungeon\u2019 outside of the Tutorial.\u2018But wait, actually\u2026 innate abilities are kind of like a talent my body was originally born with.\u2019The only issue was whether you could awaken them or not. In other words, these two innate abilities were abilities I always had within me.Just then, another notice interrupted my thoughts.[The Intermediate Administrator \u2018Senia\u2019 has requested a chat. Will you accept? Y/N]However, it wasn\u2019t a simple chat.[A Pause has taken effect due to the Intermediate Administrator \u2018Senia\u2019.]* * *Senia reached out first and requested a chat with Kim Hyukjin. She was so curious that she really couldn\u2019t hold back. To be more precise, it was the Guardians who were curious, especially the \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 who had expressed great disappointment in Hyukjin.\u201cA Pause has taken effect. Nobody else here can hear this conversation. Player Kim Hyukjin. This is a conversation between the two of us.\u201dSenia said it like it was just a chat between the two of them, but Hyukjin already knew.\u2018The Guardians must be listening, too.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a chat between him and Senia. If it was, they would be talking with an actual \u2018whisper\u2019. In other words, this conversation right now was a \u2018Player Video\u2019 being shown to the Guardians. Hyukjin had picked up on that quickly, unbeknownst to Senia.She said, \u201cThere was a flash of light just now. What was it?\u201dHyukjin looked around. Everything had become black and white\u2014the world was on \u2018PAUSE\u2019.\u2018I\u2019m surprised she went for a pause.\u2019It was rare for an Intermediate Administrator to independently come out and use their \u2018pause authority\u2019 during a dungeon play. In most cases, that meant some Guardian\u2014one with quite a lot of financial power\u2014had requested a pause.\u2018If a Guardian stepped in\u2026\u2019That meant the Guardians were going crazy with curiosity.\u2018There was a flash of light like I got something, after all.\u2019It wasn\u2019t time for a level up yet, so there was no reason for there to be a flash of light. I was well aware of that.\u2018They\u2019re probably making a fuss at her to find out what it is.\u2019After all, these damned Guardians were completely unable to resist their curiosity. I could see it in my head. Right now, I was merely a thing of amusement for the Guardians as a \u2018Player\u2019, but actually, I was the one who could make them antsy. If I played my cards right in the future, I could even lead the Guardians by the nose. It wasn\u2019t possible right at this instant, but I could already see that possibility.\u201cI got an emergency quest.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs an Intermediate Administrator, Senia was aware that Hyukjin\u2019s words were a lie. At the very least, information related to \u2018quests\u2019 were shared to Intermediate Administrators.\u201cIf I were to summarize the quest\u2026 Kill those who are trying to kill me. Only, I couldn\u2019t kill them directly.\u201dSenia didn\u2019t say anything, maintaining her usual expressionless face. She simply listened.\u2018A definite lie. What is this Player thinking?\u2019Hyukjin was an incomprehensible Player who couldn\u2019t be predicted at all. Even Senia was curious about what words would come from the mouth of this strange Player who was only level 18.\u2018Does he know\u2026 that these words are being relayed to the Guardians?\u2019They were in a pause state right now. She hadn\u2019t told him that the Guardians were listening in, but could it be that he knew?\u201cPlease continue,\u201d Senia said.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *\u201cIf I were to summarize the quest\u2026 Kill those who are trying to kill me. Only, I couldn\u2019t kill them directly.\u201dThe reason why I said this was because I was conscious of the \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 listening in. I\u2019d heard earlier that the Lady of the Scales was greatly disappointed.\u2018I killed someone, so she probably wasn\u2019t happy about that.\u2019To say it in extremes, the Lady of the Scales was a Guardian with a very \u2018moralfag\u2019 personality. It wasn\u2019t strange that she was disappointed in me, since regardless of the situation as a whole, I did end up killing them. This was why absolute good types were exhausting to deal with.\u201cThat yellow light was the indicator for getting the quest reward.\u201dI stilled for a moment, examining Senia\u2019s expression. What were the Guardians saying? But Senia was as expressionless as ever, and I wasn\u2019t able to glean any hints from her expression.\u201cAs the quest reward, I got an innate ability awakening.\u201dI decided to tell the truth on this.\u201cEye for an Eye, Tooth for a Tooth. It\u2019s an innate ability where I must attack back if someone attacks me first or directs ill will towards me. If I don\u2019t do anything after getting hit\u2026 I\u2019ll have a seizure as a side effect. If you want, you can scan it.\u201dThis much explanation was probably enough to appease the Lady of the Scales a little, too. I was simply following the rules of the System. A Player is an existence bound to scenarios and quests. That was, in effect, an \u2018Absolute Law\u2019.\u2018It\u2019s about time for the Lady of the Scales to bite.\u2019This time, I received a real whisper, a voice only I could hear. Even the Guardians couldn\u2019t hear it.Why did you lie?Is the reason important?Lies can lead to later problems.This Streamer\u2026 still had a long way to go. I could tell she was a beginner simply from the way she blatantly whispered to me.Your objective is getting Coins, and mine is living a good life. If we can help each other in achieving those goals, there shouldn\u2019t be any reason to butt heads.Did you really get that ability?It was true that I got an innate ability called \u2018Eye for an Eye, Tooth for a Tooth\u2019. Senia continued talking to me in a businesslike tone.Your lie cannot be exposed, not even by mistake. The Guardians are sensitive to lies. They can even give the command to kill you for fabricating the quest.How very cute. I grinned, but only inwardly. I couldn\u2019t show the Guardians my expression.What\u2019s higher? The chance of you making a mistake, or of me making a mistake?The fact she had aided and abetted my lie meant we were in the same boat.You overlooked my lie. One misstep, and you\u2019ll also become a target for the Guardians. After all, they can\u2019t tolerate being deceived by lower beings.It was a relief she wasn\u2019t glib-tongued or talkative. She didn\u2019t talk much, so there should be less of a chance for her to slip up.\u2018It\u2019s actually better than being talkative.\u2019Her talent as a Streamer was at the bottom of the barrel, but it didn\u2019t matter\u2014she could still survive if she had quality content that could cover for her lack of talent, and then some.I said a few more things aloud. If a whisper went on for too long, the Guardians would definitely think something was up, though this blockheaded Streamer didn\u2019t even know that.\u201cI don\u2019t feel good about it,\u201d I said, making a dark expression. \u201cI was also an ordinary person until very recently, and leading someone to their death like this is scary and terrifying. I feel that way, even now.\u201dLady of the Scales, are you listening?\u00a0I didn\u2019t want to have to say this much, but I had no choice.\u201cBut I\u2019m even more fearful of someone precious to me getting hurt. I would rather become a murderer\u2026 than let something terrible happen to a child who sacrificed her life for me.\u201dThis was the final nail in the coffin.\u201cBecause that is what I consider to be the greatest justice I can carry out.\u201dI finally heard a notice.[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019\u2019s misunderstanding has been resolved.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 acknowledges the \u2018Absolute Law\u2019.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 understands your true heart.]The lovely notices continued.[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 has gifted you 300 Coins.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is seriously considering bestowing a \u2018large gift\u2019.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 decides to postpone the \u2018large gift\u2019.]Ah. The result fell a little short of the mark. If possible, I would have liked to make her feel a bit sorrier and direct the play a bit more dramatically so that she wouldn\u2019t just consider, but actually \u2018bestow\u2019.\u2018Well in any case, I\u2019ve acquired the possibility of getting a large gift from her.\u2019You couldn\u2019t expect too much with the first swing.\u2018The pause will end soon.\u2019Shortly afterwards, the pause ended.* * *So Yoohyun was a future Ranker. He was someone who would rise to the position of \u2018Fist King\u2019 even without my help or meddling. Naturally, he was a Player of overwhelming talent, and so I thought he would quickly become accustomed to death.\u201cI would have done the same. Even death was too good for them. Hyungnim, don\u2019t be too torn up about them for no reason.\u201dI expected this response from him. However, Sunhwa\u2019s reaction was unexpected. She was unexpectedly extremely calm, and was unmoved by the indirect murder I had committed.\u201cIt was really scary, but those were bad people.\u201dShe didn\u2019t go so far as to say \u201cgood riddance\u201d, but it didn\u2019t look like Sunhwa was all that fazed by their deaths. The phrase \u2018influence of talent\u2019 was a very famous set of words that described why someone could adapt so quickly in a situation like this.\u2018Hm?\u2019 Come to think of it\u2026 \u2018The person most unfeeling about this situation\u2026 is me.\u2019I had just essentially killed Seo Joohwan\u2019s group with my own hands, but despite that, I suffered absolutely zero mental shock. On the contrary, I was calm enough to use the situation to soothe the Lady of the Scales and paint the situation I wanted. It was enough to make me wonder if I was a psychopath.\u2018Though they\u00a0were\u00a0trash who deserved to die.\u2019In any case, it was surprising to me that I could be so aloof to someone\u2019s death.\u201cI trust you, oppa.\u201dI picked up on an intense emotion via \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019.State: Trust / Reliance / RespectUnder my direction, Yoohyun and Sunhwa hunted the \u2018Buzzing Bees\u2019 littered on the ground with reddened bodies and bulging bellies.

Once we got both, we could achieve what I wanted.We continued forward, hunting the Black Yaks and Purple Yaks along the path.[Acquired Black Yak\u2019s Lean Meat.][Acquired Black Yak\u2019s Lean Meat.]Yoohyun and Sunhwa showed a fairly impressive Play.\u201cOppa, over there.\u201dI saw a crystal exuding purple light floating in the air, around thirty centimetres in size.Just then, a notice came in.[The \u2018Seoul Station Crystal\u2019 does not welcome intruders.]An ominous purple energy began to spread from the crystal like a fog.[Eye of Perception detects danger.]It was a vicious poisonous gas.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even though I knew the strategy from beginning to end, even though I knew how to get rid of that poisonous gas, I would still die if I messed up.I strode towards the crystal.\u2018Around here, I guess.\u2019I drew in a big breath. Having become a Player, I could now hold my breath far longer than a regular person. My eyes were fixed on the crystal exuding the poisonous smoke.\u2018Here I go.\u2019I inspected the item one last time, the Hidden Piece item I got from Mandra.[Mandra\u2019s Gloves]Mandra\u2019s Gloves have a special effect.

I continued to approach the crystal, holding my breath as best I could.\u2018Senia must know.\u2019She had to know that I, someone who didn\u2019t have full poison resistance, wouldn\u2019t be unscathed from approaching the crystal simply on the merit of the \u2018Mandra\u2019s Gloves\u2019.\u2018And the Guardians must be focusing, too.\u2019Senia and the Guardians, both of them were likely focusing on my Playing. They wanted to see. They wanted to see if a mere level 18 Player could truly clear this place on his own.

It was the item we had acquired earlier, \u2018Buzzing Bee\u2019s Stinger\u2019. It was a monster that gave little EXP and not many Coins. Despite that, we worked hard to hunt them, not missing out on a single one.[The crystal\u2019s poison has begun to seep into your body.][Resisting the poison.]\u2018It\u2019s hard to keep my eyes open.\u2019Thanks to my stats being far higher than the regular Player, my poison resistance was likely higher than the average Player.\u2018I\u2019m also at my limit for holding my breath.\u2019I had reached the crystal, but the poisonous smoke was so thick I could hardly see in front of myself.

Their way through was almost the same, and so was the difficulty.They then reached the vicinity of the crystal and heard the notice once again.[The \u2018Seoul Station Crystal\u2019 does not welcome intruders.]It was a repetition of the same trick. To some extent, the \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon\u2019 was a beginner dungeon and didn\u2019t have a complicated or difficult clearing method. As long as you knew the strategy, it had a very high clearing chance and the death chance was also very low.[Eye of Perception detects danger.]Like before, Eye of Perception sent Hyukjin warning signals.

Even her expressionlessness was beautiful. It went past beauty into something more noble.\u2018She\u2019s\u2026 Hyungnim\u2019s Intermediate Administrator?\u2019He almost drooled.

He already owed Hyukjin his life.

That was how it normally was. The fact an Intermediate Administrator personally appeared to deliver the reward meant they had used some item or authority.\u2018I think there\u2019ll be a level up point, as a fundamental reward.\u2019Senia nodded. \u201cYes. I will distribute level up points to all members of the group that cleared the Seoul Station Dungeon.\u201dThat was a very unsurprising reward, an all-too-ordinary compensation.\u2018What I want is\u2026\u2019There was something else that Hyukjin wanted. His true goal for clearing this dungeon was something else. It was the first step and the starting line for his plan.\u2018She\u2019ll probably give me a choice.\u2019Hyukjin silently waited\u2014no good came from being hasty. At last, Senia continued.\u201cFor showing an astonishing Play, a choice will be offered to Player Kim Hyukjin.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: Korean Father (2)\u201cA choice will be offered to Player Kim Hyukjin.\u201dI already knew what the Seoul Station Dungeon\u2019s first clear reward was.\u2018Number one is gold.\u2019Actual wealth would be given. I even knew exactly how much it was in grams. It was a regular exam question.\u20183.75 kg.\u2019In grams, that was a whopping 3,750. I knew why it was that number, too. That number was necessary in story dungeons that progressed the story, not just one-time dungeons. It would be used later.\u2018But right now, it\u2019s meaningless to me.\u2019Of course, it was true that my heart was racing. Nearly 4 kg of gold had a value of 200 million won, or approximately $200k.As was befitting of a \u2018number\u2019 related to a later scenario, Senia personally read out the number.\u201cYou can acquire a pouch filled with 3.75 kg of gold.\u201dA hologram appeared before my eyes. It was visible only to me. I was given a choice, to take the gold or not. An ordinary person would probably choose the gold without looking back.\u2018200 million won.\u2019It was a quantity I\u2019d never had in my life\u2014no, never even seen. On the TV or the Internet, everyone and their mother was a wealthy person with millions and owned buildings worth hundreds of millions. But me? Much less millions, I didn\u2019t even have a few thousand. For me, even a few dollars was money I was loath to part with.\u2018But where this gold came from is uncertain.\u2019The \u2018System\u2019 hadn\u2019t properly taken root in society yet. If someone came out with a lump of gold of uncertain origin they picked up somewhere, it would be difficult to properly prove its worth.\u2018It would already be a relief if it didn\u2019t get taken by the state.\u2019The Players Association would be established, and the big corporations would start dipping their feet into the Player world with Sungshin at their lead. After that, related legislation would start to be enacted.In the early stages of Playing, as unreasonable as it was, many Players were forced to donate their rewards to the state, as \u2018taxes\u2019.\u2018What was it again? \u2018Goods that came from an unknown world are dangerous, so they will be confiscated\u2019 or something like that.\u2019The country seized the pouch, armed with such ridiculous nonsense and even justifying themselves by calling it \u2018taxes\u2019. It was complete hogwash according to the common sense of ten years later, but that was how it was right now, during the early stage of Playing.\u2018So the gold is a no-go.\u2019It was an attractive reward, but I suppressed my greed.\u201cAnd the other choice?\u201d\u201cThe other choice is a Recovery Elixir.\u201dAnother hologram appeared.[Choose a reward]1.

They were quite a distance away from me, but I could still hear everything.\u201cWhat\u2019s with that dirty guy? Who the hell comes here looking so piss-poor? This is Sungshin\u2019s headquarters, dammit.\u201dHe was wearing what appeared to be the uniform of a prestigious private elementary school, and it looked like silk. Even his uniform looked good and utterly exuded glamor.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have my Herm\u00e8s handkerchief, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to breathe.\u201dAh. That handkerchief was that Herm\u00e8s or whatever brand name. I chuckled to myself, actually more dumbfounded than angry. Did that kid really have any idea what he was saying?\u2018Song Jinchul.\u2019This no-good ass of the chaebol family was very famous.\u2018Goodness, so he was like that from a young age.\u2019He would later go on to cause small and big scandals alike due to alcohol and women. He was from the chaebol third generation that was often said to be problematic. More specifically, he was the youngest grandson of a chaebol family. What was it again? He kept pushing back the talent plates examination that could be done at 14, saying it was fine, and finally did it at 19, or something like that.\u2018I think I heard he had like 44 talent plates.\u2019When he finally had the exam done, it was about the time for his talent plates to close, but he still had a whole 44 plates. The world was truly unfair. Someone like me had \u2018No Talent\u2019 and was someone who didn\u2019t have talent even though I desperately wanted it, yet this guy had a whopping 44 talent plates even though he loudly protested, saying it was a pain.Song Jinchul spoke to the middle-aged man bowing and scraping in front of him. \u201cIs he a janitor? Tell him to go around with something decent. Dude\u2019s so frickin\u2019 unfashionable it\u2019s disgusting. How can a person wear absolute cheap shit from top to bottom like that? It\u2019s so nasty to breathe the same air.\u201dHe was definitely saying those words about me. To be fair, he wasn\u2019t wrong\u2014I had neither expensive clothes nor shoes. I did my best to be cleanly dressed, but in the eyes of a chaebol family\u2019s youngest grandson, it looked like I was wearing cheap shit. I figured that was just how it was. Compared to the future Song Jinchul, the current Song Jinchul simply seemed cute.The man bowed deeply. \u201cUnderstood, Young Master. I will be sure to give him a firm warning. I deeply apologize for making you feel uncomfortable. We will be more careful going forward.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Take care of these things better, hear?\u201d\u201cI will be doubly sure to keep that in mind.\u201dIn the meantime, I checked Jinchul\u2019s information once.[Non-Awakened]Name: Song JinchulAge: 14State: Calm / Conceited / DisdainfulDisposition: Arrogant / Destructive / SelfishSummary: Self-Proclaimed Chosen OneIs a non-Awakened.The state/disposition/summary only show the most representative and can change according to the situation.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible.As I thought, his name was Song Jinchul. Maybe because his grandpa was in the office, he was in a calm state. His disposition was arrogant and destructive, and his summary was set as \u2018Self-Proclaimed Chosen One\u2019.\u2018He\u2019s the same age as Sunhwa.\u2019So to summarize the year 1 middle school student Song Jinchul, he was a self-proclaimed chosen one who was arrogant, destructive, and selfish, to boot.\u2018Let\u2019s not bother with him.\u2019What I had to pay attention to wasn\u2019t the young Jinchul. I did want to squash the sucker\u2019s nose in once if I had the chance one day, but it wasn\u2019t the kid I should be cursing, but the chaebol second generation that had raised him to be that way.What kinds of things had this young 14-year-old seen and learned to be like that? This wasn\u2019t the kid\u2019s fault, but the fault of the adults.Jinchul went up in the elevator, and the middle-aged man who had been bowing to him walked towards me.\u201cHow may I help you?\u201d\u201cI can treat the President\u2019s illness.\u201dSeo Joohwan had apparently said the same thing. The man\u2019s face went hard upon hearing me.\u201cThere have already been over ten people who have come here claiming that.\u201d\u201cBut no one managed to actually do it, right?\u201dAfter all, the President\u2019s illness was none other than male-pattern baldness. The name of the \u2018Type B Recovery Elixir\u2019 I picked was actually \u2018Extremely Effective Hair Growth Solution\u2019.\u201cThe President is a strict person. Can you take responsibility for your words, sir?\u201dHe was totally looking at me like I was a scammer. There wasn\u2019t a trace of faith in his eyes. That was only natural. Over ten people had already done something similar. Despite that, seeing as he was still taking me upstairs, the Sungshin President was apparently rather desperate.\u201cAllow me to guide you there. Please follow me.\u201dHe turned briskly and walked away. His back, which had bent so severely towards Song Jinchul, didn\u2019t look very happy.State: Doubtful / Humiliated / PerseveringI could see the wrinkly back of the middle-aged man\u2019s hand. There was a big wedding ring on his left hand.Summary: A Korean FatherOf course this man didn\u2019t want to bow and scrape and hear curses from a mere 14-year-old fledgling, either. It was all in order to live as a father in Korea. That was why he endured this humiliation. It wasn\u2019t right, but everyone lived like that, as wretched as it was.\u2018Fight on.\u2019I got into the elevator with the man. I didn\u2019t know if the President had given the order to let me up, but I was taken directly to his office.Knock, knock.\u201cPresident. I have brought a guest.\u201dI went inside, coming face to face with the first generation president of the Sungshin Group, Song Kiyoung. He started with nothing and turned Sungshin into the massive company it was now. He was a self-made businessman who established the number one company in Korea. Later, he would play a leading role in the creation of the Players Association and become the first generation Players Association Chairman.\u201cNice to meet you. I am Song Kiyoung.\u201dAnd when I saw him, I was greeted with a slightly unexpected situation.\u2018Huh? What?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: Flash Gate \u2013 Underground TunnelMany people described Song Kiyoung as a \u2018scary person\u2019.Apparently, if this person was in front of you, you\u2019d find yourself nervous and scared, or something like that. It was public knowledge that he had a strange ability to make people tense.I felt like I had an inkling as to why.\u2018Song Kiyoung was a Player, too.\u2019It was something no one had known. After all, President Song hadn\u2019t revealed it. Although he had awakened as a Player, he didn\u2019t do any Playing.[Player]Name: Song KiyoungAge: 68Level: 11Class: \u2013Guardian: \u2013Innate Ability: [Charisma] [Pressure]State: Hope / Doubt / FatigueDisposition: Progressive / NeutralSummary:Magnanimous Man of Reasonable DoubtDoting GrandparentClass has not yet been selected.Guardian has not yet been selected.The state/disposition/summary only show the most representative and can change according to the situation.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible.Through Eye of Perception, I was able to discover something interesting.\u2018Charisma? Pressure?\u2019My current level was 19, and President Song\u2019s was 11. Perhaps because there was a big level difference between us, I could even see his innate abilities. He was only level 11. It was very curious that President Song had already awakened his \u2018innate ability\u2019 when we had just gotten through the Tutorial and he hadn\u2019t even Played.\u2018And he\u2019s even got two.\u2019As expected, a dragon was a dragon.\u201cThis is the cure.\u201d I extended the \u2018Type B Recovery Elixir\u2019. \u201cI am a Player. I believe you need no explanation on what a Player is.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dThe man on the sofa fixed his piercing gaze on the \u2018Type B Recovery Elixir\u2019 I presented.\u201cIt should be possible to activate the item description. If the President has awakened as a Player, that is.\u201d\u201cI am not a Player.\u201dRight\u2026 Not a Player,\u00a0right.\u201cIn that case, I will explain the effects for you.\u201dThe \u2018Type B Recovery Elixir\u2019 was, by all accounts, a hair growth solution. It could make hair grow lushly on your head. Seo Joohwan used this to get a billion won, aka $1 million, from Song Kiyoung.His summary said it all.Magnanimous Man of Reasonable DoubtThis person was generous. If you gave him something he wanted, he would give an appropriate reward in full.\u201cSimply ingesting it will make your hair grow.\u201d\u201cHow much growth?\u201d\u201cCertainly as much as you want.\u201dSong Kiyoung glanced at me.[Eye of Perception detects an Innate Ability.][The Innate Ability \u2018Charisma\u2019 is active.]I could feel the President\u2019s intensity through Eye of Perception.\u2018My heart feels a bit itchy.\u2019I didn\u2019t feel scared or fearful like people described.\u2018Come to think of it, I think I heard your heart\u2019s supposed to feel electrifyingly tingly when you talk to Song Kiyoung.\u2019He had an innate ability called \u2018Charisma\u2019, but he was only level 11. I wasn\u2019t all that intimidated. I at least knew that this effect was the power of his innate ability.\u201cI do not tell lies. And I\u2019m not so bold as to lie to the president of Sungshin.\u201dI looked straight into President Song\u2019s eyes. After a moment, he chuckled.\u201cIt seems to me that your assertion that you are not bold is a lie. I feel like it has been a truly long time since I\u2019ve seen someone be so confident in front of me.\u201dThe way President Song looked at me changed a little. It was a minute change, but I could definitely feel it.\u201cWhat is it that you desire?\u201d he asked directly.I didn\u2019t intend on asking for pure cash.\u201cI would like one condo and a little money.\u201dA normal person might have yelled \u2018You must be nuts!\u2019, but not Song Kiyoung.\u201cA condo and money?\u201d\u201cIn a newly constructed apartment complex located near the Digital Media City. A condo costs about 900 million won.\u201d\u201cA condo, huh?\u201dSong Kiyoung looked me straight in the eye.[Eye of Perception detects an Innate Ability.][Detecting the Innate Ability \u2018Pressure\u2019.]I received a notice from Eye of Perception.A sense of oppression pressed down on me, and it became a little difficult to breathe. I confirmed the true nature of the innate ability called \u2018Pressure\u2019.\u2018It feels\u2026 like I\u2019m wearing a slightly thick face mask?\u2019 It was exactly around that level. \u2018It\u2019s nothing much.\u2019To be honest, the effect was so light it was almost laughable. It made sense\u2014I was nearly twice his level.\u201cI\u2019m clear on the condo. How much money do you want?\u201dThe condo\u2019s market price was around 900 million won, or around $900,000. Seo Joohwan received 1 billion won, $1 million, in cash for this elixir. I didn\u2019t complicate things.\u201cI would like 100 million won.\u201dSong Kiyoung continued to stare at me, almost as if probing my intent. It wasn\u2019t just a simple stare. He used his abilities as a Player on me for a good ten minutes.[Still detecting the use of \u2018Pressure\u2019.]Time passed in silence.\u201cIt seems you\u2019re not lying.\u201d Song Kiyoung stood up. \u201cVery well. I will try believing you once.\u201dThe president of Sungshin, who seemed unaware that \u2018Pressure\u2019 didn\u2019t affect me at all, continued with a warning. \u201cWe\u2019ll write the contract immediately. But if your words are a lie, then you will have to pay the price for robbing me of an entire forty minutes of my time.\u201dI nodded. I wasn\u2019t all that scared of his warning\u2014I was already very accustomed to the \u2018new technology\u2019 of the System. Feeling relaxed, I added something I almost forgot to say.\u201cI would like the world not to know of me. I don\u2019t want any attention.\u201dI chose a different path from Seo Joohwan, who had decorated the newspaper headlines.\u201cAlright.\u201dThat left just one more thing to say.\u201cOne more thing.\u201d* * *I left Sungshin\u2019s headquarters with a light heart.\u2018I thought I\u2019d be super nervous, but\u2026\u2019I had swung through the meeting with far more leisure than expected. The past me probably wouldn\u2019t have even been able to meet the man\u2019s eyes, but Hyukjin the regressor was different. Now, the aura exuded by the Sungshin President wasn\u2019t anything much.\u2018The trade is complete.\u2019The name of the apartment I asked for was \u2018DMC Riverview Xi\u2019. Later, when the Korean Players Association sprang up in the vicinity, the value of this cream of the crop apartment would skyrocket. It would be the safest place in the country, an apartment building that would become a landmark in Korea. I didn\u2019t ask for this place just because of the price jump or the money.\u2018And if I need money in three years, I can sell it then.\u2019In three years, the Players Association would already be mostly established, and the DMC Riverview Xi condo would be a nest egg I could cash in at any time. I might not have gotten cash from the President, but this condo was basically the same as getting cash.\u2018I\u2019ll need a billion won in three years.\u2019My final bastion was prepared. I now had a property I could convert into cash at any time.\u2018More than anything\u2026\u2019Our family no longer needed to squeeze together in a half-underground room. My older sister, who\u2019d been getting up at the break of dawn to support me, could have her own room now.My mom\u2019s lifelong wish was to live in a real apartment once. I would finally be able to realize her wish.\u2018We\u2019ll have a home to call our own.\u2019We had been anxious that we might be kicked out of even that tiny half-subterranean room because of the possibility that every two years, the rent would increase, but now, that was a worry of the past. Because in my hand right now was the contract.The president of Sungshin had been truly amazed.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. Is this\u2026 the new technology?\u201dHe was no longer bald. He was frozen in front of the mirror for a long time. He called up his secretary on the spot and had him find out about the DMC Riverview Xi. For the president of Sungshin, buying a single condo was no big deal.\u201cOf course. I agree to all of those contract conditions. Secretary Kim! Come into the bathroom.\u201dEverything was handled with lightning speed. There happened to be an empty condo for sale, and Secretary Kim was able to purchase it right away.\u201cAh. And about that child named Kang Sunhwa. If she wants it, assist in her adoption to a woman named Lee Soohyun. Ensure there are no setbacks.\u201dLike a true magnanimous person, President Song settled everything quickly. My mom kept saying she wanted Sunhwa to live with us, so I asked him to help in the adoption proceedings. For my mom, for Sunhwa, and for me.\u2018Going into dungeons later will be way easier if we\u2019re brother and sister, too.\u2019She was a genius among geniuses whose talent plates hadn\u2019t even fully opened yet. Keeping Sunhwa by my side had many plusses for me as well. More than anything, it was true that I wanted to protect her.\u2018I\u2019m sure Sungshin has realized the potential of new technology now, too.\u2019I had to keep the general flow of the timeline the same. Due to Seo Joohwan, \u2018Sungshin\u2019 became very interested in the \u2018new technology\u2019. Under President Song\u2019s lead, Sungshin provided active support to \u2018Players\u2019 and unfurled business ventures related to \u2018Players\u2019, all because President Song had the chance to experience the marvels of the new technology for himself.\u2018They\u2019ll move quickly now.\u2019It was the same as the past. Things had progressed like that in the past, too. In the same big events, I would do the best I could.Not long afterwards, I got a text.[Digital dispatch. Korean Bank. 100,000,000 won deposited.]I could hardly believe it. In my hand, I held the condo ownership contract, and in my bank account, was 100 million won, or $100k. It was difficult to believe this was reality. It really didn\u2019t feel real.Still marveling, I walked quite a distance until I reached Hongje-dong, a neighborhood in Seoul. I waited about fifteen minutes in front of a certain building.\u201cNoona. You\u2019re off work?\u201dThe ultimate boss of tsunderes, my older sister, stared at me up and down like she was looking at a ghost.\u201c\u2026What do you want?\u201d\u201cI just dropped by somewhere and was going home, and it coincided with you getting off work, so I wanted to go home with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMy sister didn\u2019t really respond. She acted as if I were a huge pain in the ass, turning around and walking to the bus stop, her attitude utterly frosty.State: Good mood / Relieved / Happy\u2018She\u2019d probably wanna die if she knew I was reading her mood, right?\u2019I inwardly grinned.\u2018What\u2019s with the relief?\u2019I guessed it was a residual emotion from the relief of my being alive, because I had been one of the few to come back alive from the \u2018Cataclysm\u2019.\u201cThe bus is here.\u201dThe two of us got on the bus, and Eye of Perception immediately picked up on the gazes of people. Actually, even before I had Eye of Perception, I had been keenly aware of people\u2019s looks. My sister was someone who could draw the eyes of everyone in the room despite not having a trace of makeup on her face. My sister and I didn\u2019t pay much attention to those gazes.\u201cNoona. How about we move?\u201d\u201cGot a lotta money?\u201d\u201cYeah. About 100 million won.\u201d\u201cYou drunk? Wake up.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m serious though?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMy sister clearly dismissed my words as pure nonsense. She didn\u2019t even bother responding and just stared fixedly out the window.I knew, of course, that my sister wanted to move. She wanted to move out of the house where cockroaches came skittering out with every thump. She just didn\u2019t show it.Like the brother and sister we were, we didn\u2019t talk. My sister just kept looking out the window, and so did I. It was totally fine even if we didn\u2019t talk. The silence wasn\u2019t awkward between us.\u2018She\u2019d probably faint if she knew this paper in my hand is the new condo contract.\u2019And if she also found out there was 100 million won in my bank account? I felt happy just imagining her reaction.\u201cNoona.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make it so we can move to a nice place.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMy sister continued to look out the window.\u201cLet\u2019s live\u2026 in a good place from now on. I\u2019ll make it so you can also quit your job.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to get something like leukemia in the future. You don\u2019t have to work at a factory because we have no money.\u201cToday, let\u2019s go with mom and\u2026\u201dI was about to propose going out to eat with the family, but at that moment, I found myself unable to continue.\u2018Huh?\u2019I saw something outside the window. A golden light was shimmering next to a roadside tree. It didn\u2019t look like the people passing by could see it. That was only natural\u2014after all, they weren\u2019t Players. That light could only be seen by Players.\u2018A flash gate?\u2019The Seoul Station Dungeon had just been cleared. Did a flash gate form in Hongje-dong at this time before? I combed through my memories and had a very faint recollection of something.\u2018Yes. There was one.\u2019It wasn\u2019t considered important on the civil servant exam, simply and briefly described as a gate in the early stage that was cleared by the Sword Empress.The weak golden light shimmering next to the tree, and the woman standing in front of it\u2026 I knew her.\u201cNoona. There\u2019s something urgent I have to do, so I\u2019m getting off first.\u201dThe strongest juggernaut of PVP, a Player so strong you would have nothing to fear from if you were on the same side as her. The Slayer of Two Faces.I had found the Sword Empress Shin Yeonseo, along with a very small flash gate.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: Flash Gate \u2013 Underground Tunnel (2)My sister also got off the bus with me.\u201cYou\u2019re also getting off, noona?\u201d\u201cYa. Might as well get some exercise. I\u2019ll walk.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dNoona walked off, and I quickly strode off towards Shin Yeonseo.\u2018She does look pretty young.\u2019The woman I was looking at now was very different from the Shin Yeonseo during the peak of her activity, in 2028. Other than the fact that she had a cute and pretty appearance that would draw attention in any crowd, the 20-year-old Sword Empress didn\u2019t look all that special.\u2018A tennis skirt?\u2019She was dressed up pretty adorably, to the degree that I couldn\u2019t even imagine the Sword Empress of 2028 wearing such a thing. She was wearing a light yellow, short sleeved t-shirt with a heart on it and a white tennis skirt, as well as an ivory reusable bag like any other university student.\u2018She\u2019s cute.\u2019We were the same age, but she looked two or three years younger than me. The Sword Empress who had taken the battlefield by storm in that famous \u2018Battle of the Maldives\u2019 was not here.[Player]Name: Shin YeonseoAge: 20Level: 19Class: \u2013Guardian: \u2013Innate Ability: [Single Hit Finisher]State: Curious / Fearful / Having funDisposition: Inquisitive / Daring / PositiveSummary: Pure, Easily Lovestruck Girl with Two FacesClass has not yet been selected.Guardian has not yet been selected.The state/disposition/summary only show the most representative and can change according to the situation.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible\u2018She\u2019s outstanding.\u2019She was already level 19 and even had an innate ability.\u2018As if anyone would accuse you of not being a top-class talent.\u2019Her speed of growth matched Fist King So Yoohyun\u2019s. There was no doubt, \u2018Playing\u2019 required talent. You couldn\u2019t stand at the top with effort alone. Even from the low-level period, there was already such a glaring difference between her and ordinary Players. Her level was proof enough of that.\u2018Her summary\u2019s confusing.\u2019A pure, easily lovestruck girl with two faces? I was a little confused because the word was hardly used in 2028, but I remembered the meaning. Basically, it was \u2018a person who falls in love easily\u2019, or something like that.I heard Shin Yeonseo\u2019s voice.\u201cIs it okay to go in?\u201dShe appeared to be contemplating whether to go in or not. It looked like she was talking to someone, so I assumed she was talking to an \u2018Intermediate Administrator\u2019 I couldn\u2019t see.\u2018This is a gate the Sword Empress cleared.\u2019Flash gates had similar traits to dungeons. If they weren\u2019t cleared in time, the gate would collapse, and monsters would come spilling out.\u2018Well, I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be that hard.\u2019I had already cleared the \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon\u2019. A gate was easier compared to a dungeon. That was the established theory, at least. The interior structure was comparatively simple, and the clear conditions weren\u2019t all that complicated.I took the initiative to start a conversation with her. \u201cAre you thinking about going inside?\u201d\u201cH-Hello!\u201dShin Yeonseo looked very lively. As she dipped in a bow to greet me, her hair swished. We\u2019d only exchanged one greeting, but she gave me the feeling of being very outgoing.\u201cUm\u2026 Do you know much about this thing?\u201d\u201cThis is called a gate. If it isn\u2019t cleared in time, monsters will come out of it.\u201d\u201cI did hear that from the Intermediate Administrator, but\u2026 do you think it\u2019s really true?\u201dIt was. Originally, the \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon\u2019 also ended up breaking a few times. It simply didn\u2019t this time because I cleared it in one shot.But regardless, there would be breaks elsewhere.\u2018As time passes, gates will break out here and there.\u2019I couldn\u2019t cover all the gates and dungeons on my own.Shin Yeonseo asked, \u201cWhat is your level?\u201dI shrugged. This was before the \u2018Ranking Board\u2019 went up.\u2018Oh, right.\u2019 That reminded me, I had to change my settings in advance before the Ranking Board went up. If I didn\u2019t, it would become possible to read my info. \u2018Settings.\u2019[Opening the Settings Window.]\u2018Info sharing off.\u2019[Player info has been changed to private.]For now, I was someone who hadn\u2019t existed in the past.

At least for now.\u201c19,\u201d I said.\u201cReally?\u201dShin Yeonseo\u2019s eyes went round. Her diverse and ever-changing expressions, along with her blinking eyes, made her look like a bunny.\u201cThe Intermediate Administrator said my level up speed is incredibly fast and she said I might be the fastest one\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your level?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also 19! Wow. There\u2019s another person like me, huh? Awesome!\u201dShe was praising herself without any sense of pretense, so I couldn\u2019t really dislike her for it.\u201cIn any case, I\u2019m planning on going in.\u201d\u201cW-Will it be alright?\u201dThis woman was not yet the Sword Empress, but an ordinary university student.\u2018You betcha.\u2019The past records said that Shin Yeonseo cleared this gate on her own. It wouldn\u2019t be that hard.\u201cI think so, yes. Even a dungeon was cleared.\u201d\u201cB-But that was because the Tutorial Ender was there\u2026\u201dMiss, even that amazing Tutorial Ender So Yoohyun would be no match for you in one on one.\u00a0I almost wanted to tell her that. It felt weird to see Shin Yeonseo the Sword Empress being all nervous about a gate in a beginner zone.\u201cWe could go in as a party, then.\u201dJust then, Senia showed herself. It seemed she had gotten the news from Yeonseo\u2019s Streamer that I was Playing.\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI had purposely waited a little. Since I was going to Play anyway, I might as well get the eyes of the Guardians on me and get sponsorships, right?\u2018And we\u2019ve got two Streamers here, too.\u2019I could only see Senia, but the Sword Empress\u2019 Streamer was definitely here as well. Her Streamer, \u2018Roa\u2019, was poised to be an extremely famous Streamer.She was sponsored by many influential Guardians. In other words, it was possible I could catch the eye of a few of the Guardians who had supported the Sword Empress in the past.\u201cWoah. Oppa. You speak down to your Intermediate Administrator?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s awesome.\u201dExcuse me, we\u2019re the same age, so why am I your oppa? You\u2019re calling me oppa without even asking my age, miss.\u201cI\u2019m 20.\u201dOf course, I had the mentality of a 30-year-old uncle on the inside, but it didn\u2019t change the fact that right now, I was 20.\u201cOh, really? I thought you were definitely older than me.\u201dShe broke out into a big grin, giving me the smiling eyes that had condemned countless men to a fate as \u2018Sword Empress crushers\u2019. Seeing it in person made me think she really was worth crushing on. Looking at that radiant, sunny smile made the world seem so much brighter. At least, that was how she looked on the outside.\u2018Is that why she\u2019s got [Two Faces]\u2026?\u2019The normal Sword Empress vs. the Sword Empress in battle. It was said that the two were completely different people. I didn\u2019t know since I\u2019d never seen her fight, but looking at her summary, it seemed she really did have something like a dual personality.After finding out that we were the same age, Yeonseo became a little more proactive. \u201cI\u2019ll send you a party invite! I also wanted to go in.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *Kim Ahyoung got off the bus. She went into a nearby convenience store, buying some chocolate and putting it in her bag.\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dFor a moment, she felt her vision dim. She reached out her hand on the spot. Because not far from her, her little brother who\u2019d been talking to some woman was suddenly sucked into the tree by the roadside.Thud!She dropped her bag.\u2018No.\u2019She remembered. The Jongno of April 28, 2018. Her little brother miraculously came back from there alive, and afterwards, the world turned strange. Monsters appeared, as well as Intermediate Administrators who killed people. It seemed her little brother was getting sucked into some weird place again. Ahyoung ran to the roadside, standing at the place where she had last seen him.\u2018Where\u2026 did you go?\u2019Stop joking and come out,\u00a0she pleaded. Her heart dropped and grew cold. He had suddenly disappeared again. For Kim Ahyoung, who didn\u2019t know anything, this was a natural reaction. She felt her mind grow blank with panic. For that one week while her brother was missing, for those seven days of the Tutorial, she hadn\u2019t been able to swallow a single proper spoonful of rice.\u201cWhere the hell did you go, you crazy bastard?!\u201dHer back to the tree, Ahyoung slumped to the ground, as if losing all strength. Her body felt completely limp. She mumbled in a daze, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you when you get back.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t think. She just sat there.\u201cI won\u2019t give you any chocolate, dammit. You little bastard.\u201dShe had just bought the chocolate her brother liked, planning to toss it onto his blanket. But now, she didn\u2019t want to give it to him anymore. She tried calling his phone a few times, but she only heard a message saying, \u2018Your call cannot be connected\u2019.\u2018Please. Please, let nothing happen.\u2019Ahyoung cried while leaning on the tree. Time passed.Meanwhile, Kim Hyukjin, who possessed a transcendent level of sense for \u2018Playing\u2019 but was otherwise not all too meticulous, went into the gate with Shin Yeonseo.\u201cI think a gate is far simpler in structure than a dungeon,\u201d he said.He was talking to Yeonseo, but at the same time, he was also saying it to the Guardians who were watching.Yeonseo smiled brightly. \u201cWe\u2019re the same age, so how about dropping the formalities?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHyukjin turned to stare at her, and her earlobes became slightly red. She gave a faint laugh of embarrassment. Many people described her smile as a \u2018cheat-level smile\u2019, and Hyukjin was able to feel that with his own eyes.\u201cHello?\u201d\u201cRegarding dropping the formalities, I\u2019ll consider it if we get out of here alive first.\u201dYeonseo\u2019s expression became a little stiff at that. Jongno had been a terrifying place for her as well. She was able to adapt quickly to Playing thanks to her outstanding talent, but it wasn\u2019t like she had completely shed her fear from that time yet. She would need a little more time to completely adapt. It wasn\u2019t that she was lacking in any way, it was just that Kim Hyukjin was unique and strange.Meanwhile, Yeonseo\u2019s Intermediate Administrator, Roa, sent a whisper to Senia.Excuse me, Ms. Senia. What\u2019s with that Player? He said he was level 19.His info is set to private.It was currently the early stage of Playing. The competition between Streamers hadn\u2019t gone into full swing yet, but the veiled fight between the Streamers to acquire quality content was well underway.Come now, don\u2019t be like that. Did you tell him in detail about the difference between a dungeon and gate, Ms. Senia?\u2026Otherwise, he couldn\u2019t have realized the difference between them with a single look. A Player of that level can\u2019t have that much intuition yet, right?\u2026We\u2019re not allowed to get too involved in their Playing.I haven\u2019t done anything that goes against the Commandments, so please mind your own business.In fact, Senia was the more curious one here. How in the world did Kim Hyukjin know the difference between a gate and dungeon? She had never told him. It seemed Roa had gotten the whiff of \u2018something big\u2019.I\u2019ll stream that Player, too. Well, I can stream whoever I want, but I\u2019m just letting you know, to be ethical about it.You cannot.Why not?Senia stared at Roa. She was as expressionless as ever, but Roa was able to read \u2018confidence\u2019 from Senia\u2019s face, a faint confidence within that expressionlessness. It came off looking like a sort of sense of superiority, and the fact that it was indeed superiority was proven by Senia\u2019s next words.Because Player Kim Hyukjin has already signed an exclusive contract with me.Eh? Exclusive contract?Roa stared slack-jawed at Senia. An exclusive contract could only be made with three Players total.You\u2019ve already signed something like that? Seriously? Something you can only do three times?Roa was shocked. Senia had already used one of her three chances. Roa also got a whiff of something extraordinary from that Player, but it was still too early to come to a hasty conclusion.There\u2019s a very high chance he could be an early bloomer\u2026 but you already used one?It\u2019s none of your business.Senia ended the conversation there.[Anonymous Guardians are entering Channel #19207 in great numbers.]Several Guardians also jumped from Roa\u2019s channel to Senia\u2019s. That meant the Guardians also had an interest in \u2018Player Kim Hyukjin\u2019.Meanwhile, Hyukjin continued to walk. \u201cThe Safe Zone goes up to this green line.\u201d\u201cYessir, Safe Zone, roger that.\u201dYeonseo nodded, acting like an elementary school student learning something fun. Hyukjin walked past the green line.[Leaving the Safe Zone.][You have entered the Flash Gate \u2013 \u2018Underground Tunnel\u2019.]This gate\u2019s name\u2026\u2018Is Underground Tunnel.\u2019It didn\u2019t look that dangerous.\u2018I should check once.\u2019He glanced behind him. The door they had come in through was still there.\u2018Because it\u2019s not escape locked.\u2019If things got dangerous, they could still escape. The gate didn\u2019t seem to have a very high difficulty. This field called \u2018Underground Tunnel\u2019 took the shape of a big clearing.[Monsters are spawning.]With that notice, various spots in the clearing began to shimmer.\u2018Huh?\u2019But something unexpected showed up.\u2018Those things come out here?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: Flash Gate \u2013 Underground Tunnel (3)I was progressing well. Way better than I thought.After all, I could feel that even the Sword Empress, the \u2018strongest in 1 vs 1 PVP\u2019, was weaker than me, at least right now. I was progressing well, but it was still true that I hadn\u2019t gotten out of the \u2018beginner\u2019 level yet.\u2018You have to reach level 30 to stand at the real starting line.\u2019Real \u2018Playing\u2019 could be seen to start from level 40 and onward, at least according to the standards of the future.\u2018Leveling from 30 to 40\u2026 isn\u2019t easy.\u2019At level 30, there weren\u2019t that many monsters good for leveling, and fast level ups were difficult. From that point, leveling demanded continuous grinding.\u2018Lycanthropes that are on the high EXP side\u2026 have way too low cost-effectiveness.\u2019Unless there was something like a creek nearby, Lycanthropes were difficult to kill. People with a lot of money actually just went around with fire trucks and hunted them, but even that wasn\u2019t all that effective. Lycanthropes were only level 25. They didn\u2019t merit such exaggerated tactics in the level 30s.\u2018But\u2026 it\u2019s a different story if I have these guys.\u2019I saw the monsters in front of me. Three of them were huddled together. They were huge rabbit-type monsters.Monster Rabbit LVL 18Monster Rabbit LVL 20The two male Monster Rabbits were level 18, and the female Monster Rabbit was level 20.Yeonseo said to me, \u201cOne of them is coming up as red. Is it like a boss monster?\u201dHer level was 19. It appeared she wasn\u2019t able to check the level of the level 20 female Monster Rabbit.\u201cThey don\u2019t look all that strong\u2026\u201d mumbled Yeonseo to herself.She was right. They weren\u2019t very strong monsters. It didn\u2019t always apply, but normally, a monster\u2019s \u2018strength\u2019 tended to be reflected to a certain degree in their \u2018appearance\u2019. Most rabbit-type monsters were weak. They might have become huge, but they were still confined to the constraints of the \u2018rabbit\u2019 category.\u2018Might be different if they were Demon Realm Rabbits.\u2019A bunny inhabiting a field set as a different dimension entirely might be different, but these guys were still rabbits, even if they had \u2018monster\u2019 attached to their name.\u2018The problem is that they\u2019re really tough to catch.\u2019They had a habit of running away when they sensed danger. That was fine, but the problem was that they were so fast it was difficult to catch them. Because they fled through underground tunnels, unless you had an earth-attribute Player, these monsters were practically impossible to catch.I looked closely at Shin Yeonseo.\u2018She cleared this gate on her own.\u2019That meant she had a method to catch these monsters.\u2018But I\u2019m sure she just cleared it.\u2019Simply clearing this gate was meaningless. I had to catch as many of those \u2018Monster Rabbits\u2019 as possible. They were monsters that were absolutely necessary for later Playing, for level 30-40 Playing.\u2018I never thought I\u2019d end up meeting them here.\u2019I felt my mood go up, and I wasn\u2019t the only one feeling happy.\u201cHow about it? Shall we try catching them? It looks fun.\u201dShe seemed a little excited. Her cheeks had become ruddy, but her cuteness wasn\u2019t the only thing I noticed.\u2018So the Sword Empress was always this way, starting from the low levels.\u2019This, too, was the influence of talent\u2014that she felt \u2018curiosity\u2019, not fear, towards a new monster. She might look cute, but there was surely an incredible battle instinct lurking within. The whole person changed as soon as there was a sword in her hand. Some people even gave her the nickname \u2018Rakshasa\u2019, aka demon.\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d I said before giving an explanation. \u201cRabbits usually have a tendency to run away when they\u2019re in danger. It would be best to kill them in one shot if possible. Do you think you can do it?\u201dFor example, with your innate ability \u2018Single Hit Finisher\u2019.Yeonseo innocently thumped her chest. \u201cOf course! I even have a skill that kills in one blow.\u201dThe two of us hunted the Monster Rabbits. Killing them in itself wasn\u2019t hard. The only attacks they had were kicking with their hind legs or biting with their fangs, so they weren\u2019t all that dangerous.\u201cNow.\u201dThat instant, Yeonseo\u2019s sword glowed blue. For a very brief moment, it looked like her body whooshed backwards.Swoosh\u2013!The whistle of air being sliced rang out.A straight trajectory of blue light was traced in the air.\u2018It\u2019s fast.\u2019Her movements were fast. For the briefest moment, Yeonseo\u2019s body had shot backwards like a bullet, like her sword was almost a spear.\u2018That\u2019s the Sword Empress\u2019 innate ability, Single Hit Finisher.\u2019It was already astonishing that she\u2019d already awakened an \u2018innate ability\u2019 at level 19, but it was also surprising that she could use it so well.[You killed a Monster Rabbit.][EXP acquired.][26 Coins acquired.]One Monster Rabbit died, and the other two fled. I \u2018clicked\u2019 the Monster Rabbit\u2019s body.[There are no dropped items.]It was a bit of a shame. Monster Rabbits dropped \u2018lifesteal items\u2019, and at a very high rate. Lifestealer items were absolutely necessary in order to quickly get through the level 30-40 stretch that was called the \u20181st Hellish Hurdle\u2019.\u201cAw. They all ran away.\u201dShin Yeonseo looked like she sincerely found it regretful. Here, I could feel it again, that this girl was really born to be a Player, that she truly enjoyed this.

Hyukjin? Ah, whatever. Let\u2019s just drop the formalities. Whatever. I\u2019m just gonna be casual with you. We\u2019re like friend-age. It\u2019s actually hella embarrassing to speak politely when we\u2019re the same age,\u201d she mumbled quickly to herself before simply deciding to drop the formalities.\u201cDid you always know about this place? Have you been here before?\u201dHyukjin also naturally dropped the formalities. It wasn\u2019t all that important to him.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time, though?\u201dThat was the truth. It was just that he knew most of the strategies of the future.\u201cReally? It\u2019s your first time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYeonseo\u2019s eyes grew wide. It was hard to believe this woman and the woman who unleashed Single Hit Finisher on a Monster Rabbit just now was the same person.\u201cBut how can you be so calm? To me, it looked like you already knew a lot about this place.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe air began to shimmer again, right on cue. It saved me from talking, since Monster Rabbits appeared again.\u201cLet\u2019s keep catching these guys.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dYeonseo seemed to subconsciously trust me quite a lot. She followed my lead without protest. The two of us continued to hunt Monster Rabbits.[You killed a Monster Rabbit.][EXP acquired.][25 Coins acquired.]After we hunted around eight of them, an item dropped.[Quality Iron Sword]An iron sword that has likely been made by a fairly high-level craftsman. It has excellent durability and attack power.Grade: NormalAttack Power: 7-18Durability: 300/300Dammit. Something like this was meaningless. It was pretty decent for a beginner item and even had a durability meter, but I didn\u2019t need something like this.\u201cMm.\u201dBut I pretended to be troubled. There was one item, but two people.\u201cYou have it,\u201d I said, as if doing her a kindness.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYeah. It looks like you\u2019re better at the sword than me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFor a moment, Yeonseo looked like she was wondering if it was really okay, but then she nodded.\u201cGot it. I\u2019ll take it with gratitude! In exchange, I\u2019ll definitely give you the next item that comes out.\u201dShe grinned, as if thinking she owed me one. That smile\u2026 was certainly pretty.Yeah,\u00a0I thought.\u00a0You take that trash loot. I\u2019ll take the lifesteal item, thanks.[Legolas\u2019 Ring]A ring made by refining a \u2018topaz\u2019 that holds a mysterious power.Defense: 1Effect: 2% attack damage HP absorption.It finally showed up. Yeonseo didn\u2019t recognize this item\u2019s value.\u201cEhhh, it\u2019s only 2%?\u201dIt was indeed only 2%. But it was possible to equip a total of ten rings, and it was even possible to strengthen them as long as you could satisfy the conditions.Yeonseo, who didn\u2019t know that, looked apologetically at me. \u201cFeels like only I got a good item.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re gonna keep hunting monsters anyway, so it\u2019s fine.\u201dA long time passed. I didn\u2019t measure exactly how long, but at least five hours passed of doing the same thing. Apparently, the Guardians didn\u2019t find our Playing very fun.[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 is bored.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 has stopped observing.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 finds the actions of the Players odd.]Normally, I would try to keep their interest up, but not right now. The frustration and repetition now would actually come back as intense gratification later.In that time, I acquired a whopping eight Legolas\u2019 Rings. My heart thumped. The only issue was that Yeonseo became a little uneasy.\u201cBut\u2026 isn\u2019t it taking too long? I feel like we\u2019ve been doing the same thing for too long. We\u2019ll be able to get out of here, right?\u201dIf I kept too tight of a lid on the information, Yeonseo\u2019s unease would hit a peak. The two of us were a team. There was no need to put a damper on the team\u2019s morale.\u201cI\u2019ve already found a way to go out.\u201d\u201cHm? How?\u201dHer eyes grew round again. She looked up at me with such surprise that even her lips turned into an \u201cO\u201d. I really didn\u2019t understand how the gap between when she had her sword and didn\u2019t could be so big. I wasn\u2019t so sure about the \u2018easily lovestruck\u2019 part, but the \u2018two faces\u2019 part was definitely right.\u201cOver there.\u201dI pointed some distance away at a certain spot. It was dark.\u201cI don\u2019t see anything.\u201d\u201cA Clear Crystal has formed there.\u201dLike I expected, it wasn\u2019t a high difficulty gate. After killing a certain number of Monster Rabbits, a \u2018Clear Crystal\u2019 would form. If that crystal was destroyed, the gate would be cleared, as simple as that.\u201cA Clear Crystal?\u201d\u201cWe can get out if we destroy that.\u201d\u201cAha. Then you dragged it out on purpose, huh?\u201dThat was the moment Yeonseo seemed to have realized something. That in the beginner period, lifesteal items only dropped from these rabbits. Yeonseo stared absentmindedly at me. I could feel goodwill from her through Eye of Perception.And then, she said something I\u2019d never even considered.\u201cIs it because you\u2019re interested in me?\u201dShe said it cheekily, but why did her ears redden? She should decide whether she was going to be cheeky or embarrassed, and not mix the two of them. What kind of answer did she want to hear?I was saved by the clock when a notice came in.[There are no more respawning monsters.]I was a bit sorry to hear it, but I was still able to acquire\u00a0nine\u00a0\u2018Legolas\u2019 Rings\u2019.[Monsters will not respawn.][The Clear Crystal will be forcefully destroyed.][\u2018Flash Gate \u2013 Underground Tunnel\u2019 has been cleared.]When a \u2018gate\u2019 closed once, it wouldn\u2019t open ever again. That was another trait that differentiated gates from \u2018dungeons\u2019, which remained in place.It had grown very dark outside. It looked like it was dawn.\u2018A lot of time has passed.\u2019At that moment, Eye of Perception picked up on two things.\u2018Huh?\u2019One was my sister\u2019s presence. My head whipped around, and I saw my sister, who was slumped on the ground with swollen eyes. I also felt another presence.\u2018Ah, fuck. What is it this time?\u2019The next moment, the world changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: Duel with the Sword Empress\u2018Ah, fuck. What is it this time?\u2019I couldn\u2019t see my sister anymore. The view around me was similar\u2014empty cars, shops without any people, roadside tree my sister had been at.\u2018If the field\u2019s the same but there\u2019s no people, it can only be\u2026\u2019I knew what this field was.\u2018A PVP zone.\u2019PVP meant \u2018Player vs. Player\u2019. And a PVP zone referred to a space where duels between Players took place.\u2018The one who created this\u2026 is the Sword Empress\u2019 Streamer.\u2019The Guardians watching over the Sword Empress probably put the Streamer up to it. And I knew who the Sword Empress\u2019 Guardian was.\u2018The True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain.\u2019He was the true master, the true owner, of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain. He was one of the few Guardians who revealed their identity of their own accord.The Sword Empress\u2019 Guardian. Heavenly Demon. He, who revealed himself as the \u2018Lord of the Heavenly Demonic Cult, was famous as a Guardian with an extremely belligerent disposition.\u2018A courage-lover who likes flattery.\u2019 However, he wasn\u2019t as reckless as the Lion King. \u2018One who enjoys personally meddling in the System.\u2019Of course, that also meant he had the strength to do so.\u2018A Guardian that doesn\u2019t skimp on sponsorships to both Players and Streamers.\u2019 There was no doubt that he was the one who interfered. \u2018I think he issued a quest to Yeonseo to have a go at me.\u2019I finished evaluating the situation.\u2018Even in the worst case scenario, I won\u2019t die.\u2019I had already escaped death in the Tutorial Field, the Cataclysm of Jongno. Compared to there, a PVP zone was basically heaven. It would still hurt if you were hit and you\u2019d still bleed if you were pierced, but even in the worst situation, you wouldn\u2019t die. This place was a completely different dimension.\u2018A special field where you revive, even if you die.\u2019\u2018Roa\u2019, Yeonseo\u2019s Streamer, who would make it big as a Streamer in the future, appeared before us.\u201cAt the request of the Guardians, specifically the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain, a PVP zone has been opened.\u201dAt a glance, her image was similar to Shin Yeonseo. She was just 150 centimetres. She was extremely short, but her race called her a \u2018giant\u2019, or something like that. Roa was from the pixie race, and there were four pairs of transparent wings on her back. Whenever her wings fluttered, sparkly powder fell to the ground.Roa was very different from Senia. She knew how to make use of the situation. She energetically streamed the field to the Guardians.\u201cA genius who has caught the eye of the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain, versus a Player of unknown identity who has a strangely outstanding amount of knowledge and intuition. How will a battle between them go?\u201dI chuckled. On the contrary, Senia, the Streamer who had made an exclusive contract with me, was absolutely silent, even though such stoicism would make her really unpopular. But actually, I preferred this kind of Streamer, one who lacked both talent and skill.\u2018Because she has no choice but to need me.\u2019Yeonseo looked at me. \u201cSorry. I got a quest, so. But I\u2019m told you won\u2019t die, even if you get stabbed. Don\u2019t worry!\u201d\u201cI know. This is a PVP zone, after all.\u201d\u201cYou know this, too? This is my first time seeing it.\u201d\u201cI just didn\u2019t think a PVP zone would be opened when the Guardian selections haven\u2019t even happened.\u201d\u201cGuardian selections? What\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something like that.\u201dGuardians, you heard that, right? I know about the Guardian selections, guys.[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 expresses her surprise.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is unable to repress his astonishment.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 snorts.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is silent.]Yeonseo pulled out the sword I conceded to her earlier and raised it.\u201cBut Hyukjin. You let me have this sword earlier, right?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cYou gave it to me, saying you thought I was better at the sword than you.\u201dI did, and those words weren\u2019t wrong. The moment I finished figuring out the situation, I had been thinking nonstop about how I should face the Sword Empress.Yeonseo was good at the sword, even now, when she was just a \u2018beginner\u2019. At the very least, if you just looked at our \u2018techniques for handling the sword\u2019, Yeonseo was several steps ahead of me. That was my honest judgment.\u201cBut personally, I think you\u2019re no slouch yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHow could that be the case? To begin with, the Tutorial Field was the first place where I ever picked up a sword.\u201cHow to say it\u2026? You don\u2019t feel like someone who\u2019s learned the sword.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is just my feeling, but it was kind of like seeing a genius. You\u2019re swinging by instinct without having formally learnt, but you\u2019re pretty much a technique genius.\u201d\u201cThat so?\u201dI was realizing that myself, but hearing it from the Sword Empress\u2019 lips gave me a weird feeling. I also took out my \u2018Iron Sword\u2019. Then, I opened my Status Window. Ever since level 18, I had been steadily piling up my stat points.[Status Window]Name: Kim Hyukjin (Player)Level: 24Title: [First Pioneer] [Excellent Player]Innate Ability: [Eye of Perception] [Eye for an Eye, Tooth for a Tooth]Strength: 17Intelligence: 17Agility: 23Perception: 17Constitution: 17Willpower: 17(+30)Bonus stats: 18Random stats: 13Undistributed stats: 31I was level 24. A relevant fact I should mention was that I had 3 unused random stats when I was level 18. From level 18 to 24, over the course of 6 level ups, I got a whopping 10 random stats. From my knowledge, that was an absolutely unprecedented random stat acquisition rate.\u2018Even if I\u2019m an early blooming genius\u2026 In any case, I\u2019m a genius.\u2019That was an undeniable fact. Numbers didn\u2019t lie. Shin Yeonseo\u2019s level was also a number. Just looking at the numbers, the level difference between us was 5. And earlier, I had seen her Playing firsthand.\u2018If I want to draw out a perfect picture\u2026 it\u2019d be best to invest generously.\u2019[Strength +5][Intelligence +5][Agility +5][Perception +5][Constitution +5]I boldly invested 25 stats in one go.

For now, I left 6 stats undistributed.\u2018Her fundamental techniques and skills are better.\u2019And my physical stats were better.\u2018Guess this is a fight between a woman with good techniques and a man with good physical parameters.\u2019The fun thing was that I wasn\u2019t that scared of PVPing with Yeonseo. There was definitely the chance I could lose, but on the flip side, I also felt like I could win. While this PVP process was underway, it would be best if I took every action available to me.\u201cTrue Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain. It appears the noble Guardian is one who encourages betrayal, without any sort of justification, seeing as you have issued a quest to have an ally betray the person they had fought with, the person they had entrusted their back to.\u201dBefore the battle started, Roa approached me. She had picked up the smell of content.\u201cDid you just mention the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain by name? How did you know?\u201d\u201cYou said it, didn\u2019t you? That it was the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain.\u201d\u201cAha.\u201dThis pixie, who was considered a huge giant for their race, Roa, looked like her eyes were positively sparkling. The reason why she was dragging out the beginning of the battle was probably to see how the \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 would react.\u2018If it\u2019s the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain I know\u2026\u2019This Guardian had freely asserted his identity as the Lord of the Million Heavenly Demonic Cult. He was a demon among demons who dominated the heavens with overwhelming strength as his foundation, a hero who pursued simple strength while disdaining injustice and cowardliness.\u2018A disposition that disdains betraying someone\u2019s trust.\u2019Still, he was on the rather simple side when it came to his fundamental disposition.\u2018So I\u2019m sure he just got ahead of himself because of the fun in front of his nose.\u2019In any case, to them, our Playing was merely an \u2018amusement\u2019, a \u2018game\u2019. It was difficult to really argue about faith or trust with them. However, the situation would change if you called out a being in the middle of this amusement by name.\u2018Even if it\u2019s only out of pride, they can\u2019t defy their own standards and rules.\u2019So, what will you do, oh True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain?\u2018To make this duel fair and even, he\u2019ll either strengthen me or weaken Yeonseo.\u2019However\u2014\u2018Weakening Yeonseo doesn\u2019t suit the True Master\u2019s disposition, so he\u2019ll strengthen me.\u2019I fit all the puzzle pieces together.\u2018As far as they know, Yeonseo and I are the same level.\u2019If our levels were the same, in order to have a fair and even duel, he would have to give me some sort of buff on the techniques side of things.[The True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain wishes to bestow on you a temporary skill.][You have been given the temporary skill \u2018Single Hit Finisher\u2019.][The temporary skill can only be used within the PVP zone.]I almost laughed in spite of myself.\u2018He really did it.\u2019I simply made a deduction based on the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019s disposition, but that deduction hit the bullseye. It was essentially like I had a strategy guide in my hand.\u2018Her Single Hit Finisher and my Single Hit Finisher, they\u2019re the same.\u2019I wasn\u2019t very scared of the battle with the Sword Empress Shin Yeonseo, the woman who was called the Ruler of the Sword. It was a PVP zone where no one would die, anyway.\u201cWell, then, shall we have some fun?\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *\u201cI won\u2019t hold back.\u201dYeonseo leveled her sword at Hyukjin. The moment she had her sword in her grip, the look in her eyes changed.The difference when she was holding her sword and when she wasn\u2019t was obvious. That was the trait that defined the Sword Empress, the martial spirit acknowledged by the Heavenly Demon who was the true master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain.A genius of PVP with a natural-born talent for the sword\u2014that was Hyukjin\u2019s evaluation of Shin Yeonseo.\u2018My whole body is tingling.\u2019He could feel it through Eye of Perception. Yeonseo\u2019s aura was fierce. She was facing him with the intent to kill him. In other words, this feeling was bloodthirst, an intense energy seldom felt from a low-level Player not even at level 20.However, Hyukjin was not cowed by Yeonseo\u2019s aura. His \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 was an innate ability with a base function of \u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019, a catalyst that could maintain a cool head in any situation and allow him to take a step back to look at the situation objectively. \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 was very helpful in allowing Hyukjin to maintain his composure.\u2018She\u2019s coming.\u2019Shin Yeonseo slightly lowered her body. Every movement of her body, her aura, her flow, he saw all of it.\u2018Here. To the left.\u2019Hyukjin took one step back and swung his Iron Sword, defending to the left. At this moment, he didn\u2019t see anything else. Here, there were only Yeonseo and him, him and Yeonseo. Only the two of them existed.Clang!Sword clashed on sword.\u2018With a little less strength.\u2019There was no need to expose all his cards. In terms of physical stats, Hyukjin was head and shoulders ahead. However, he didn\u2019t show that. To Yeonseo, the two of them were equally matched in strength.Her attack flowed organically, almost like a living snake.\u2018The trajectory is going for my side.\u2019But he had already seen through her with Eye of Perception.\u2018But her real target is my throat.\u2019That blade seemingly coming for his side would instantly switch its trajectory and aim for his throat. He read that naturally, with ease. This was, by all accounts, the influence of combat sense. It was a sense for instinctively reading the opponent\u2019s movements.Even so, there was no gap in Shin Yeonseo\u2019s attacks.\u2018I can\u2019t see a way to counterattack.\u2019In that brief moment, Hyukjin jumped backwards, almost like he was pulled by a magnet. It was a fluid, natural movement that widened the distance to a point where sword and sword could no longer touch.Yeonseo asked, \u201cYou haven\u2019t learned swordsmanship, have you?\u201dTo Yeonseo, it felt like their physical abilities were equally matched. However, her sword technique was far superior. If so, she should be overwhelming him. That was how it should be, but she hadn\u2019t been able to land a single real blow.\u2018To make such a result, it must be\u2026\u2019It could only be explained by one thing.\u2018The difference in sense.\u2019Or the difference in their talent. Yeonseo judged that this result could only be categorized as those two things.\u201cI\u2019ll be getting serious now, too.\u201d\u201cYou weren\u2019t serious before?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I was feeling a bit apologetic. It might be a PVP zone, but it still hurts and is scary to get stabbed.\u201dSuch an expression probably didn\u2019t suit the situation, but Yeonseo smiled brightly. Her eyes narrowed. At least right now, Yeonseo saw Kim Hyukjin as her rival. At least in this moment, he was an opponent she wanted to overcome without fail. She recognized that.Hyukjin adjusted his sword position.\u2018How in the world can a fierceness like that come from an appearance like that?\u2019He still had a hard time believing that such an aura could come from such a cute and adorable appearance. Hyukjin found himself relaxing a little more.\u2018Now, I\u2019ve got the advantage.\u2019It seemed she had judged that their physical abilities were similar, and she would come in with an attack befitting that evaluation. Hyukjin\u2019s prediction was right on the mark.Clang! Clang! Clang!Their swords clashed.The distance between their swords widened and decreased as they fought a battle that could hardly be called a battle between regular people. Although there were no flashy skills, martial arts, or foot techniques, it was, without a doubt, a battle of a level that was a rare sight in the \u2018beginner\u2019 stage.Both Hyukjin and Yeonseo panted raggedly. Neither of them had been able to land a lethal hit. Hyukjin had been slashed twice in the sides, Yeonseo twice in her left arm. Neither of them had injuries that would impede fighting.As the battle continued, Yeonseo had a feeling.\u2018It\u2019s my victory.\u2019At this very moment, her desire to win was set ablaze. She did not want to lose. She wanted to\u00a0win.\u00a0The driving force that had resulted in her growth into the Sword Empress, her desire to win, was endlessly spurring her on.Her eyes fixed themselves on Hyukjin\u2019s throat.\u2018Now!\u2019She grasped a chance that wouldn\u2019t come again\u2014an opening.[Using the Innate Ability \u2018Single Hit Finisher\u2019.]She had moved nonstop and had struck with her sword all this time for this one opening. For this moment, she had saved Single Hit Finisher. She could see an opening, and she aimed precisely for it. Her experience so far told her. This fight was her win.\u2018Huh\u2026?\u2019But just then, a situation so very different from Yeonseo\u2019s expectations occurred. A situation so very different from her expectations, but was exactly in line with the picture Hyukjin had drawn.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: Duel with the Sword Empress (2)Hyukjin had been painting a picture the entire time.In this fight of sword vs. sword, where the odds were stacked against him, he made it this far by making up for his relative lack of technical ability with his advantage in physical stats. He held back, leaving the slightest amount of give.\u2018Now.\u2019Exactly at that moment, he moved faster than Shin Yeonseo. He lowered his body and charged forward as if going for a tackle, like he was using a wrestling move on her. From Yeonseo\u2019s point of view, it looked like Hyukjin suddenly disappeared from sight.\u2018Fast\u2014!\u2019His movements were completely different from before, far faster. There was only one explanation for this.\u2018He was hiding his strength?\u2019She was doing her utmost, but Hyukjin apparently hadn\u2019t been as transparent. It seemed that he had been saving his strength, waiting for this moment.\u2018He got me.\u2019Yeonseo was unable to redirect her sword. Single Hit Finisher, an innate ability bearing the meaning of \u2018killing the opponent without fail in one attack\u2019. It was a high-speed attack that pierced one spot with incisiveness and alacrity. But her attack did not land. Her sword, which had struck forward, aiming for Hyukjin\u2019s throat, ended up embedding itself in the roadside tree.That was exactly what Hyukjin wanted. Though theirs was a battle of sword vs. sword, Hyukjin knew how to use the objects in his surroundings to his advantage. While fighting Yeonseo, he had been inching closer and closer to the tree, all in order to paint this picture, in order to have a fight that wasn\u2019t a duel.\u2018Single Hit Finisher is fast.\u2019It was fast and precise. As long as the opponent moved within the predicted range, the skill could pierce the designated target with precision.\u2018It also has high killing power.\u2019It meant that you had to attack with a great deal of weight behind the blow.\u2018So when it fails, the risk is as high as its speed and strength.\u2019When it hit the mark, it would likely be a fatal blow, but if it failed to hit, it left a large margin for getting counterattacked. As fast and large as the movement was, it would take time to regain balance. In a case like this, with Yeonseo using the skill only to have it end with her sword lodged in a tree, she was completely vulnerable to a counterattack.Hyukjin\u2019s eyes clearly saw a spot. He pinpointed a gap in the defenses of the future Sword Empress, Shin Yeonseo.\u2018Now it\u2019s my turn.\u2019Single Hit Finisher\u2014a high-speed attack and the innate ability the Heavenly Demon who was the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain had allowed him to temporarily use.[Using the temporary skill Single Hit Finisher.]The target was one hair in front of Yeonseo\u2019s throat.\u201cKyaaa! Mommy!\u201dThis woman might have the qualities to become the Sword Empress, but as of now, she still didn\u2019t have much real battle experience. Yeonseo fell backwards onto her butt.Hyukjin grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s my win, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYeonseo reddened. She was embarrassed by the way she\u2019d whined when she was unable to dislodge her sword from the tree, and also embarrassed by the way she\u2019d fallen onto her butt just now.\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dYeonseo knew as well as he did. If Hyukjin had truly struck her with the blade, she would have died, no two ways around it. It might be fine to die since it was a PVP zone, but no human could truly be free from a fear of death.\u201cI lost.\u201d[Player Shin Yeonseo has acknowledged defeat.][You have won a victory in the first PVP zone, the first PVP battle.]\u201cMan, if our Mrs. Han Myunghye had seen me just now, she would\u2019ve been shocked, huh? I haven\u2019t called for my mommy since elementary school,\u201d Yeonseo mumbled to herself in embarrassment.Hyukjin didn\u2019t hear her muttering. He tilted his head.\u2018The first PVP zone, first PVP battle?\u2019Was there always a notice like this?\u2018No, there wasn\u2019t.\u2019April 28, 2028. The notepad that had always been in his hand had been placed carefully in his Inventory. Whenever he had the time, he carefully looked through the notepad and organized the events of the future, making a new strategy guide. But in his notes, there was nothing related to \u2018the first victory of the first PVP zone\u2019.Hyukjin helped Yeonseo to her feet.\u2018There\u2019s\u2026 a high chance it was originally Yeonseo who had the first victory.\u2019He came to that conclusion quickly. The Sword Empress had never been defeated by anyone other than Jo Sunghyun the Typhoon in a 1 vs. 1 PVP. She most likely received some kind of special bonus from the first PVP battle.\u2018And she kept it a secret from the world.\u2019[The title \u2018First Adversary\u2019 is being generated.]\u201cThanks. But man, you\u2019re really strong. You haven\u2019t formally learned the sword either, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHow can someone who hasn\u2019t learnt be like this? And you hid your strength in the middle on purpose, right? Your last movement was completely different. I feel like you got a real one over on me.\u201dYeonseo\u2019s mumbling didn\u2019t reach Hyukjin\u2019s ears.\u2018Another title?\u2019He got yet another title, something even rankers would seldom get.\u2018First Adversary.\u2019This was probably the title the Sword Empress was supposed to have gotten.[First Adversary]A title given to the Player who won in the first battle between Players.The \u2018Adversary\u2019 holds a considerably advantageous high ground in battles with Players.Attack speed: +7%Movement speed: +4%Special Skill: Can use Flash Step.Hyukjin was sure of it.\u00a0Flash Step,\u00a0of all things,\u00a0had appeared. It was a skill of an entirely different nature from other instantaneous movement magic-based spells like \u2018Blink\u2019 or \u2018Warp\u2019. With absolutely zero use or flow of mana, it could allow you to change positions instantly, before your opponent could even notice what was happening.This formidable lightness technique, that had allowed the Sword Empress to shine radiantly in 1 vs. 1 PVP, this skill called Flash Step, was relegated to Hyukjin.\u2018A skill the Sword Empress should have originally gotten\u2026\u2019He saw Yeonseo, who had already shaken off all her embarrassment and had a faint smile on her lips. Looking at that nearly completely innocent smile, his emotions were a little complicated.\u2018I got, instead.\u2019Thanks to his knowledge of the future, he ended up getting an ability that the Sword Empress was supposed to get.\u2018I\u2019m not sorry.\u2019He wasn\u2019t completely at ease, but that didn\u2019t mean he was extremely troubled, either. The Sword Empress was doing her best, and likewise, he, Kim Hyukjin, was doing his best to Play, using everything within his capacity.They had both done their best, so they would each take responsibility for the result. It was a simple, clear-cut principle.Hyukjin\u2019s victory also surprised the Guardians.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 expresses their surprise.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 has sent you a Coin sponsorship.][+400 Coins]The Nameless Observer sent me yet another sponsorship.[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is awed by your chivalrous spirit.]By chivalrous spirit, she was likely referring to the fact that I didn\u2019t kill Yeonseo.\u2018If you\u2019re awed, you should at least give some Coins.\u2019I heard that she was so very generous to one of the 8 Heroes representing Korea, Jo Sunghyun the Typhoon, but to me, she only expressed her admiration without opening her purse.[The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 likes your scheming.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 has begun to pay attention to you.]It felt fun to Hyukjin.\u2018A whopping four Guardians have begun to send messages to me.\u2019The number of Guardians who could send messages to a single Player was limited to five. No one knew the exact details, but it was said that the Guardians also competed amongst themselves in order to squeeze into those five slots.\u2018Getting into the first four slots also takes a huge amount of Coins.\u2019Not every detail of the System was known. However, one thing they did know was that Guardians also had to compete in order to send messages. In other words, even among the Guardians who \u2018revealed their names\u2019, message-sending Guardians were the \u2018real deal\u2019.\u2018Just one more, and all five slots will be filled.\u2019But the notices continued.[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 ridicules your petty tricks.]It was almost a little absurd, even. How much did he have to compete among the Guardians in order to send that message? Thinking about it like that, it really was laughable.\u2018Even though there\u2019s no doubt that he doesn\u2019t like me.\u2019But even so, he was unable to take his eyes off Hyukjin. Despite falling slightly short compared to famous Guardians like the \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 and the \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019, seeing as he continued to persist in sending messages\u2026\u2018Is he a tsundere?\u2019His flip flopping made me feel like there was some sort of love-hate relationship here.\u201cWhat are you thinking about so hard?\u201d asked Yeonseo, peering at Hyukjin. \u201cThe PVP zone is supposed to be disabled after three minutes.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dRight, Yeonseo was in front of him. He had been so focused on various things that he forgot about Yeonseo.\u201cUm\u2026 hey.\u201dYeonseo\u2019s cheeks reddened a little. Hyukjin\u2019s Eye of Perception picked up on a strange emotion from her.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019It was hard to describe in exact words, but this slightly itchy feeling of some sort, emotion of some sort, came sweeping towards him via Eye of Perception like a spring wind.\u201cTell me your phone number.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWell, um\u2026 It\u2019ll be convenient to party up if I get to know a Player of your level in advance\u2026 Ah.

Not long after this announcement, \u2018Tutorial Fields\u2019 appeared all over the world.I knew.\u2018Globally, at least 20 million people will die.\u2019This was something I could do nothing about. I was neither a hero nor a god. I could not save them. I wasn\u2019t even able to save the people right in front of me, the people on the D-Tower 2nd floor. This was a flow of events I could do nothing about.\u2018Sungshin\u2019s vigorous involvement, and the transition of the world into Tutorial mode.\u2019The world was proceeding exactly as I knew.One day passed.I stumbled upon a \u2018mini gate\u2019 that formed near my house, where I found \u2018baby orcs\u2019. Their level was about 15. They weren\u2019t full-growns, but I still needed to face them seriously.\u2018Not too far in the future, I will have to kill orcs.\u2019And not just one, but a great number of them.Another day passed.[Level increased.][Current level: 25][2 bonus stats acquired.][1 random stat acquired.]\u2018Level 25.\u2019I reached level 25. This was the number one thing I\u2019d been waiting for. Before a Player reached the 30-40 stretch, the level up period from hell, level 25 was the first \u2018turning point\u2019 of that Player.\u2018I should be getting a notice now.\u2019I waited for the level 25 notice.\u2018Huh?\u2019But something was a little strange.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: Six-Tailed FoxLevel 25, the first turning point a Player faced.The reason it was called \u2018the first turning point\u2019 was precisely because of \u2018advancement\u2019. When Players reached level 25, they were given a choice to advance to a class. Normally, it was the biggest turning point before level 40.\u2018How come I\u2019m not getting a notice?\u2019Normally, you\u2019d get a list of choices without delay. The \u2018first advancement\u2019 was set to several basic choices.\u2018Usually, it\u2019s tank or damage dealer, plus a few miscellaneous classes.\u2019Miscellaneous classes referred to the \u2018non-combat\u2019 classes. Choices like explorer or blacksmith definitely existed. It was just that no one chose them.The first advancement was exactly as it sounded\u2014the first class change. It played the role of determining the body\u2019s \u2018direction\u2019.\u2018In the early Play period, everyone always advanced at level 25.\u2019But as time passed and strategies were published, people no longer chose to do their first advancement at level 25.\u2018Level 30. That\u2019s the real advancement point.\u2019I would wait for that point. So to me, level \u201825\u2019 itself wasn\u2019t all that important. However, I should have still heard the \u2018advancement is possible\u2019 notice. How come I didn\u2019t?\u2018Did something go wrong?\u2019I got a call from Sunhwa.\u2014I went to D-Tower like you told me to, but\u2026 it\u2019s just a normal building?That meant it still looked like the normal \u2018D-Tower\u2019, having fulfilled its purpose as the Tutorial Dungeon.\u2014Got it.I hung up. The D-Tower was still the same as before, and I didn\u2019t get the advancement notice. I was able to draw a conclusion.\u2018It hasn\u2019t been updated yet.\u2019In conclusion\u2014\u2018I leveled up too fast.\u2019It seemed that I had leveled up faster than the System had expected, so the advancement system hadn\u2019t been patched in yet. No wonder. The other countries had just barely started their \u2018Tutorial Quests\u2019 now.\u2018This is correct. It\u2019s correct that the update hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u2019My level was 25. I relaxed a little after figuring out the situation. Nothing would change from the past. When I thought back, I remembered that in the early Play period, the person with the fastest level ups had been the Tutorial Ender.The Tutorial Ender, So Yoohyun, who would later be called the Fist King. I guessed that his level was currently somewhere in the early 20s.\u2018So Yoohyun was probably the first to get the first advancement notice, too.\u2019Thinking about the timeline according to his level up speed would be easiest.\u2018I can just check, can\u2019t I?\u2019I sent Yoohyun a call.\u2013Hyungnim! My level is 22. I\u2019ve been doing my best to hunt, but it\u2019s really slow-going.Yoohyun was level 22. That was certainly an extremely fast leveling speed. It was just slow compared to me.\u2018Then for now, advancement is on hold.\u2019I decided to busy myself with other matters and organize my thoughts until the Tutorial Dungeon \u2018D-Tower\u2019 turned into the \u2018Tutorial Building\u2019, until a new system called NPCs took effect.\u2018Inventory.\u2019In my Inventory was the compiled \u2018summary\u2019 I had brought with me from 2028. I didn\u2019t know why I had it, or why I had returned to the past. I didn\u2019t know those things, but it was okay. To me, right now, the reason wasn\u2019t important.[May 11, 2018. The beginning of the Cataclysm on a worldwide scale.]Today was June 13.[June 16, 2018. Gates/dungeons appear simultaneously in Korea.]Soon, \u2018beginner\u2019 or \u2018tutorial\u2019 level gates and dungeons would be simultaneously generated all over the country.\u2018Thinking about it like that, my leveling speed is really fucking fast.\u2019It wasn\u2019t just my level up speed. I got extra random stats whenever I leveled up. That meant I\u2019d gotten way more stat points than regular Players of the same level.\u2018There are three more days until the 16th of June.\u2019What could I do during these three days? The new house was nearly ready for moving in. Tomorrow, our family would be able to move to our new home. I was itchy to find out how happy my mom and sister would be after finding out. My mom\u2019s lifelong wish had been to live in a real apartment, after all.\u2018Okay.\u2019I decided what I would do today. The goal for today was \u2018Mt. Inwang\u2019.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://discord.gg/reapercomics* * *At the foot of Mt. Inwang, in the early evening of a weekday, I saw quite a lot of climbers.\u201cOppa. Why are we here?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019ll be a monster somewhere around here.\u201d\u201cA monster?\u201dSome distance away, I saw a monster getting trampled under the climbers\u2019 feet. It was a Slime.\u201cLike that Slime?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t really call that thing a monster.\u201dSlimes were only technically monsters by classification. Even civilians who weren\u2019t Players could easily kill them. Slimes were simply a tool to get people accustomed to \u2018Playing\u2019, to get them used to destroying something.\u201cThen what? Is there something else here?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI knew. There was definitely a \u2018Lycanthrope\u2019 living here, somewhere on this mountain. There hadn\u2019t been any victims yet, but someone would die here\u2026 at the Lycanthrope\u2019s claws.\u201cA Lycanthrope.\u201d\u201cEhh?!\u201d Sunhwa stumbled back one step. \u201cA-A Lycanthrope?\u201dIt was a monster we had already seen. The Lycanthrope was a bipedal, walking wolf-type monster. The Lycanthrope we\u2019d seen on the Tutorial Field was the essence of fear itself, at least to Sunhwa.\u201cW-We\u2019re going to kill that?\u201d\u201cWe have to.\u201d\u201cO-Oppa. Please reconsider.\u201dI could understand why Sunhwa was so frightened. How scared must she have been back then? The fear engraved in her head must still be very present.\u201cI\u2019m level 25 now.\u201d\u201cWhat? Already?? I\u2019m only at 21.\u201dIt was actually shocking. She was in her early teens, so her \u2018talent plates\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be completely open yet. For her to have almost the same level as So Yoohyun at her age was insane. Her talent hadn\u2019t even bloomed yet. If this young child was this incredible, just how crazy would she be when all her talent plates opened? It was a bit iffy coming from my level 25 mouth, but this kid really was a \u2018damn genius\u2019.In any case, Sunhwa and I started going up Mt. Inwang. I tried to remember the newspaper article.\u2018They said six people died gruesome deaths on the trail.\u2019One of the six had captured the \u2018Lycanthrope\u2019 on her phone camera. A military unit was dispatched to hunt down the Lycanthrope, and they managed to succeed because Lycanthropes could be hunted with modern weapons.\u2018But it was a real mess.\u2019It felt really different. I had only come in contact with the incident through a newspaper article, and back then, I simply thought that it was a terrifying creature. But now, I was climbing Mt. Inwang to kill that very creature.The sun crept down, the sky dimming.\u2018They said it was around the halfway point.\u2019Once you hit level 20, even a child would have the physical abilities of most adult men, or better. Sunhwa didn\u2019t struggle much.\u201cOppa, will a monster really show up here?\u201dThe only monsters we could see were slimes. Even the commonly seen city foxes were nowhere to be spotted, and there weren\u2019t any rabbit monsters. It was so peaceful I started to wonder if this was all in vain.\u201cIt\u2019s possible we might not find it today.\u201dIt could go either way. I hadn\u2019t been thinking that we would find the Lycanthrope in just one day. However\u2014\u2018Ah.\u2019I felt something through my constantly active \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019.\u2018Bloodlust.\u2019I didn\u2019t see the source of the bloodlust. We were on a steep slope, with a not-too-thick forest on both sides. Nearby, a few climbers were chattering jovially as they descended the mountain.\u2018In the newspaper article\u2026\u2019The situation had been described with comparatively greater detail. I was almost fascinated by my ability to remember all of that now. I didn\u2019t know why I could remember it. Was it because I was a genius?\u2018Old schoolmates in their 40s experienced an unlucky mishap while descending the mountain.\u2019I didn\u2019t come here because I wanted to save them. Incidents like this would occur in tandem all over the country anyway, and I couldn\u2019t save them all. This might make me seem a little violent and cold-hearted, but I came here in order to test my current strength. I wanted to see if the level 25 me could face a level 25-ish Lycanthrope head-on.\u2018Where is it?\u2019I definitely felt its bloodthirst, that feeling of a savage beast eyeing its prey. \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019, the far more developed version of \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019, heightened every sense of my body to the utmost.\u2018Where is it?\u2019Before long, I was able to find it.\u2018There\u2026!\u2019* * *Han Myunghye, who was 43 years old this year, climbed down Mt. Inwang while chattering with her old school buddies, who she hadn\u2019t seen in a while.\u201cThey say events like Jongno have happened all over the world.\u201d\u201cHaa. How terrifying. Don\u2019t talk about it. I don\u2019t even wanna think about it.\u201dOut of 150,000 people, just 5,000 managed to survive Jongno. That was, in every sense of the word, a calamity and a disaster.\u201cI hear those Intermediate Administrators or whatever monsters are killing people at random, and not even the police can do anything about them?\u201dHan Myunghye shook her head.She had many worries these days, too. Her daughter awakened as a Player, or something of the sort, and insisted that Playing was fun. She tried to scold her daughter to not say such crazy nonsense, but the child didn\u2019t want to listen to her.\u201cYeah. Those Intermediate Administrators? I hear those guys are real monsters, too.\u201d\u201cNot even guns work on them. They appear and disappear suddenly, so\u2026 there\u2019s nothing we can do about them.\u201dThe world had changed too much these days. Ever since the \u2018Cataclysm\u2019, it felt like Earth had become a completely different world.\u201cWe\u2019ve lived fifty years, but who would\u2019ve known that something like this would happen?\u201d\u201cSeriously.\u201d\u201cBut I hear the items those monsters drop are being sold off at a pretty high price?\u201d\u201cThat, you know, Sungshin President described them as new technology.\u201dNew technology. Monsters. Tutorial. To them, the terms were far too unfamiliar. Even slimes were fascinating to them, despite having seen them many times.\u201cAnd these squishy things have appeared on the ground, too.\u201dBut just then, they saw someone running over.\u201cH-Huhh?\u201dHan Myunghye was startled out of her wits. It was almost like some crazy person was charging towards them.\u201cK-Kyaaaa!\u201dShe screamed, falling backwards to the ground. Some crazy person was running over with a huge knife in hand, after all. Myunghye\u2019s school buddies also screamed. One of them even fled without a single look back, and the three remaining women screamed in place.\u2018I-I have to call the police!\u2019But her body was frozen. She couldn\u2019t move\u2014she was just too shocked. What kind of bolt from the blue was this? How could there be a sudden suspicious man with a knife here?\u201cPlease stay still. Don\u2019t make pointless noise. It\u2019ll stimulate it.\u201dHyukjin gestured towards his mouth with his index finger. Myunghye shut her mouth, but the three women around her continued to shriek, apparently caught in a panic. They could do nothing but scream.\u201cT-T-T-T-That is\u2014!\u201dBehind the collapsed Myunghye, something enormous appeared.Grrrrrrr\u2013!It was a lifeform of a kind they had never seen in their lives, a monster with golden eyes and saliva dripping from its sharp fangs.Lycanthrope LVL 24It was a\u00a0level 24\u00a0Lycanthrope. Hyukjin reached out with his left hand, grabbed the slumped Han Myunghye, and dragged her behind him.\u2018Before, I could only use petty tricks\u2026\u2019How would it be this time, now that he was a level 25 Player? Just how well could he really hunt this level 24 Lycanthrope?\u2018I\u2019m curious.\u2019He readjusted his grip on the \u2018Iron Sword\u2019. But just then, Eye of Perception picked up on \u2018bloodlust\u2019.\u2018This feeling.\u2019It was the same bloodlust he had felt earlier. Now that he could see the beast with his own eyes, he knew. The bloodlust from earlier\u2026 wasn\u2019t coming from this Lycanthrope. The source of the bloodthirst he\u2019d felt through Eye of Perception was from something \u2018else\u2019, something giving off an energy more refined than the Lycanthrope.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: Six-Tailed Fox (2)It wasn\u2019t just the Lycanthrope.\u2018Where is it?\u2019I felt it.\u2018Behind me!\u2019There was a creature giving off even fiercer bloodlust than the Lycanthrope before my eyes. I heard a piercing scream.\u201cKyaaaaaa!\u201dOne of the three women who had fallen over was attacked by the Lycanthrope, her arm torn off by its brute, monstrous strength.Spurt!Hot blood gushed from the gaping wound.Hyukjin didn\u2019t pay much attention to that. Rather, he wasn\u2019t\u00a0able\u00a0to. The moment he let himself get distracted by the Lycanthrope, that still unidentified \u2018something\u2019 would stick a dagger in his back.\u2018I\u2019ll kill it. Now.\u2019It seemed to think that it was perfectly concealed. In all truth, I couldn\u2019t see it with my eyes. But my eye that wasn\u2019t an eye, the evolved form of Sixth Sense in my head, Eye of Perception, picked up on its position. Despite being level 25, I had abilities that far exceeded a regular level 25 Player.[Would you like to exchange the title \u2018Excellent Player\u2019 with \u2018First Adversary\u2019?]Excellent Player afforded me great advantages in \u2018monster hunting\u2019, with its damage increase and increased movement speed. Each and every effect was a rare gem. But right now, I needed \u2018First Adversary\u2019.[The title \u2018First Adversary\u2019 is taking effect.]Eye of Perception pinpointed \u2018its\u2019 location, but there was no point in simply figuring out where it was. In the end, I would have to catch its movements myself.[Using the special skill Flash Step.]Flash Step, the Sword Empress\u2019 iconic movement skill and a high-speed lightness technique that could allow one to reach the designated position instantaneously, without any readying or change in posture. The foot technique that made the former Sword Empress shine so radiantly was reborn because of me.It felt like the world instantly moved far away, like my body was getting sucked somewhere. Like my body was being shrunk by a vacuum cleaner or some powerful force. However, I didn\u2019t panic. My body reacted naturally, as if this feeling were familiar to it.\u2018Here.\u2019I used one lightness technique over another. Immediately after using a foot technique that gave me a movement speed that couldn\u2019t even be imagined for a level 25 Player, I swapped the titles again in what was called \u2018switching\u2019.[The title \u2018Excellent Player\u2019 is taking effect.][Additional damage +20%][Movement speed +10%]The moment my body reached its location using Flash Step, I swapped the title effects, a feat that demanded precise combat sense. I managed the switch in a span of time so short it could be counted in \u2018seconds\u2019. It was so fast that one would never be able to say this was the sense of a level 25 Player.On top of that\u2014[Using the skill \u2018Excellent Strike\u2019.]I used a title skill, not a regular attack\u2014\u2018Excellent Strike\u2019. I struck out with the Iron Sword. Starting from Flash Step and ending with Excellent Strike, my attack could almost be called instantaneous.Spuuurt!My sword struck flesh.I couldn\u2019t see it properly; I couldn\u2019t properly activate Eye of Perception. But I did see one name:Six-Tailed Fox LVL 27\u2018Six-Tailed Fox?\u2019It was a \u2018spirit-type monster\u2019 with six tails. Six-Tailed Foxes were skilled in stealth and sneak attacks and were capable of using a smidgen of \u2018spiritual arts\u2019.\u2018A Six-Tailed Fox is already appearing?\u2019I already knew about Six-Tailed Foxes, including how to hunt one. The problem was that it wasn\u2019t the right time for a Six-Tailed Fox to show up yet\u2014it was too early. Six-Tailed Foxes fell under the \u2018spirit\u2019 classification, and these \u2018spirit-type\u2019 monsters were slightly trickier to face than other monsters of the same level.\u2018And it already fled.\u2019Only the Lycanthrope was left.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *One woman\u2019s arm was ripped off, and a fountain of blood arced through the air. Sunhwa did not close her eyes.\u2018Oppa would\u2026\u2019To Sunhwa, Kim Hyukjin wasn\u2019t just \u2018some oppa\u2019 she knew. He wasn\u2019t someone she liked as someone of the opposite sex, wasn\u2019t the target of her love. No, he was closer to \u2018the target of her awe\u2019, a realm far removed from those things.And in this moment, the only thought in her head was this:What would oppa do?\u201cTaunt!\u201d[Using the skill Taunt.]\u2018!!!\u2019 marks appeared above the Lycanthrope\u2019s head. It craned its head towards the sky and howled.Awoooooooo\u2013![Howl has taken physical effect.]She had experienced this howl before. Back then, Sunhwa was hidden behind a car, unable to do anything. Her body and legs had trembled unstoppably, completely frozen by the abnormal status \u2018paralyzation\u2019.\u2018It\u2019s different this time!\u2019Sunhwa opened her eyes wide.[The status abnormality has not taken effect.]In the Tutorial Field, in Jongno, the Lycanthrope they met was like fear itself\u2014but not anymore. If the relationship between the Lycanthrope back then and her was like predator and prey\u2014\u2018Now, I\u2019m going to be the one who\u2019ll hunt you!\u2019\u2014now, their positions were swapped. The System, the levels, and all the growth that came with those things had strengthened and trained Sunhwa.Gau! Gau! Gau!Uttering something akin to the barks of a dog, the Lycanthrope rushed forward, showing its sharp claws.Swiiiiiipe\u2013!It slashed its sharp claws at Sunhwa\u2019s throat with the whistle of air being sliced.Sunhwa did not fear it. She did not falter a single step. Rather, she moved forward half a step, assuming balance. Putting force right into her toes and tightening her abdomen, she lowered her center of gravity.[Using the skill Platinum Shield.]The moment she used her skill, she snatched up the Lycanthrope\u2019s wrist.\u2018Urgh\u2026!\u2019Her wrists were numb. \u2018Platinum Shield\u2019 did dissipate a great deal of the impact, but the Lycanthrope\u2019s full power still exceeded her expectations.\u2018I blocked it.\u2019Even so, she had changed greatly from the past. Sunhwa had a good understanding of what her role was, of what she had to do.\u2018I won\u2019t let you go!\u2019She grabbed it hard, not letting the Lycanthrope wriggle free from her grasp. In her small hand, using her thin wrist, she grabbed the much stronger-looking Lycanthrope\u2019s wrist and restrained the beast.Grrrrrrrr!The Lycanthrope opened its jaws wide, exposing a red mouth and enormous teeth. It gave off a fierce aura, like it was going to rip Sunhwa to pieces right this instant.In the meantime, Hyukjin quickly drew near.\u201cBark some more, you shitty dog.\u201dSpuuuurt!He plunged the \u2018Iron Sword\u2019 deep into its wide-open mouth. Hyukjin\u2019s \u2018Iron Sword\u2019 went through the monster\u2019s mouth and out the back of its head. Blood surged out of the Lycanthrope\u2019s snout, showering Hyukjin from head to toe.Sunhwa punched out.Bam!There was a resounding thud. Her small fist had landed precisely in the Lycanthrope\u2019s abdomen.[You have killed a Lycanthrope.][EXP acquired.][30 Coins acquired.]The predator of the Tutorial Field, the King of the Wolves and the Hidden Piece, the Lycanthrope, was no longer a match for Hyukjin and Sunhwa.Hyukjin had already wiped away his sweat.\u2018That was easier than I thought.\u2019Killing the Lycanthrope was far easier than he had anticipated. If there hadn\u2019t been an unexpected Six-Tailed Fox, they would have probably been able to hunt it down without any damage. Unfortunately, one person died to the Lycanthrope, her body missing an arm.\u2018Rest\u2026 in peace.\u2019The two survivors were trembling nonstop.\u201cD-D-D-D-Don\u2019t come any closer\u2026!\u201d\u201cM-Monster\u2026!\u201dThe two of them weren\u2019t in their right mind. Hyukjin had no intention of blaming them. Their reaction was normal. A 2-meter large wolf monster suddenly showed up before their eyes, and there was an even greater monster that had stabbed that wolf monster to death.Hyukjin didn\u2019t really curse them or resent them. When it came down to it, he and Sunhwa were indeed their saviors, but it was difficult to expect such gratitude from them. Because they really weren\u2019t in their right mind right now.\u201c\u2026\u201dIf things had gone like in the past, they would have died. But they had lived.\u2018A difficult life in the mire is better than one in the clouds.\u2019They would likely have to live with a great deal of trauma and fear, but that was still better than dying, wasn\u2019t it? Their lives were their own to live.However, there was still one questionable loose end.\u2018A Six-Tailed Fox, huh\u2026\u2019According to the government notice he remembered, they succeeded in killing the culprit behind the incident, the \u2018Lycanthrope\u2019. They had paraded that feat extensively, garnering praise from the populace.\u2018Was there no Six-Tailed Fox back then?\u2019This was just Hyukjin\u2019s hunch, but\u2026\u2018No. It was there at that time, too.\u2019He had no proof. He just felt that was the case.\u2018It was there, but\u2026 they probably didn\u2019t manage to kill it.\u2019\u2018Spirit-type monsters\u2019 were, after all, extremely tricky to kill with modern technology. Moreover, it was a fox-type monster particularly specialized in escape. At the level of a Six-Tailed Fox, there was a very high chance that they had failed to kill it and it escaped.Immediately after the \u2018Lycanthrope\u2019 incident on Mt. Inwang, there was a grotesque series of events that had become famous all over the world.\u2018The serial killings in the vicinity of Mt. Inwang.\u2019He recalled the gruesome incidents.\u2018The victims\u2019 bellies were cut open, and all their guts were gone.\u2019Both details were characteristic of Six-Tailed Foxes. It was a horrific monster that lusted for the guts of humans. There was no doubt about that, but the government announced that they were the horrible and perverted acts of a serial killer. They even caught the perpetrator.Hyukjin recalled a \u2018conspiracy\u2019. The perpetrator had claimed that he was wrongly accused time and time again, before finally committing suicide because he felt so wronged.Hyukjin was sure of it.\u2018The government\u2019s announcement at that time must have been a lie.\u2019Because the acts were so gruesome, if there was no criminal to act as a scapegoat, the arrow of blame might have headed to the government or the police.\u2018I\u2019ll kill the Six-Tailed Fox.\u2019It was injured and had likely been unable to escape far. Hyukjin promptly decided to catch it. A Six-Tailed Fox wasn\u2019t in his original plans, but with it, his plans would be pushed closer to \u2018completion\u2019.\u2018If I\u2019m lucky\u2026 I might be able to get a [Fox Tail].\u2019At that moment, his Eye of Perception captured something. It was faint, but he heard a scream further down the mountain. Hyukjin moved first, followed by Sunhwa. He didn\u2019t explain to her what he was doing, but Sunhwa naturally followed his lead. Despite being only 14 years old, her sense and perceptiveness were first-rate.Hyukjin didn\u2019t push himself to an excessive speed.\u2018Control my breathing.\u2019He couldn\u2019t wear himself out too much. If his stamina was worn out, he wouldn\u2019t be able to hunt the spirit, and he might be the one on the losing side. It wouldn\u2019t do to hurry in this situation.\u2018The one woman who fled earlier.\u2019The wounded Six-Tailed Fox was likely aiming for that woman. Thinking back, he remembered that the Six-Tailed Fox\u2019s escape route was in this direction. It wanted to gorge itself on human guts to recover. The scream coming from some distance down the mountain was likely from that hapless woman.Hyukjin felt the bloody aura he\u2019d felt earlier. This time as well, it was the same kind of bloodthirst. Because Eye of Perception had captured it once, the feeling was relayed to him in sharper clarity.\u2018It\u2019s an extremely voracious monster.\u2019Plus, it was wounded, so that voracious appetite would be even more explosive. Whenever it was eating something, it saw nothing else. As such, when hunting Six-Tailed Foxes, the innards of young calves were used to make a trap.\u2018I see it.\u2019There it was\u2014the Six-Tailed Fox. Under its six swishing tails and furry body was a person. He heard screams of \u201cS-Save me!\u201d\u2018Am I too late?\u2019No, he wasn\u2019t too late. Eye of Perception captured something new, something that couldn\u2019t quite be called a \u2018variable\u2019.\u2018I\u2026 knew it.\u2019Hyukjin had already been expecting this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33: Display of the GuardiansSix-Tailed Fox. This spirit monster with six tails used special skills called spiritual arts or Taoist magic. In all actuality, it was because the Six-Tailed Fox was categorized as a spirit monster that its skills were called that, but it was perfectly fine to just call them skills.The Six-Tailed Fox\u2019s skill, Doppelg\u00e4nger, allowed it to divide its body into two separate entities.\u2018That one\u2019s a fake.\u2019The clone had a physical form, but \u2018that thing\u2019 that was created as a doppelg\u00e4nger was weaker than the true body. If it had been the true body, the woman pressed underneath it would have already died. Her stomach had been slashed and blood was seeping out, but that level of injury was a blessing.\u2018If it were the real one, it would\u2019ve already gobbled everything up.\u2019She would\u2019ve been far beyond Hyukjin\u2019s help.\u2018Where\u2019s the true body?\u2019Hyukjin honed Eye of Perception to the max. He didn\u2019t even hear a notice like \u2018Eye of Perception has been activated\u2019. One month had already passed since he first gained the ability.No one had taught him how to use it, and he never learned how best to use it. But Hyukjin naturally, so very naturally, became familiar with Eye of Perception\u2019s use. Just like how a baby didn\u2019t need to be taught how to breathe, it was the same with Hyukjin and Eye of Perception.\u2018The true body.\u2019Hyukjin\u2019s innate ability heightened his senses to the greatest degree, and that same ability thoroughly swept through the surrounding area.\u2018Found it.\u2019At Hyukjin\u2019s 11 o\u2019clock, sitting in a tree, was the Six-Tailed Fox, the color of its body cleverly changed to match the color of the branches and leaves. Most spirit monsters protected themselves with this kind of \u2018camouflage\u2019. It wasn\u2019t anything special.\u201cSunhwa. Aggro it,\u201d Hyukjin said to the girl next to him.For now, he acted as if he hadn\u2019t noticed the true body. Six-Tailed Foxes had an uncanny sense for running away, so if the true body figured out its cover was blown, it would immediately flee.\u201cGot it.\u201dSunhwa used her skill right away.[Using the skill Taunt.]The Six-Tailed Fox\u2019s clone was chomping at the stomach of the woman underneath it. Green \u2018!!!\u2019 marks appeared above its head.[Using the skill Taunt.]The \u2018!!!\u2019 marks turned yellow. Sunhwa used Taunt one more time.[Using the skill Taunt.]Finally, the \u2018!!!\u2019 marks turned red, indicating that Sunhwa had completely drawn its aggro. With Eye of Perception active, Hyukjin watched the true body\u2019s movements.\u2018Come. Even the true body in the distance nearly got aggroed.\u2019By Hyukjin\u2019s evaluation, Sunhwa\u2019s aggroing ability was so outstanding that no one of the same level could hold a candle to her. A Player in their early level 20s who could successfully draw the aggro of a Six-Tailed Fox with \u2018prey\u2019 in front of it?\u2018I can\u2019t remember anyone who could do that.\u2019As expected, Sunhwa was\u2026\u2018A damn genius.\u2019In any case, the aggro was properly applied, and the Six-Tailed Fox\u2019s clone with the red \u2018!!!\u2019 over its head charged towards Sunhwa.Six-Tailed Fox LVL 22The true body\u2019s level was 27, but the clone\u2019s level was set to 22. Both the true body and clone had physical form, but a decrease in ability was an unavoidable side effect. The Six-Tailed Fox opened its jaw full of sharp teeth wide as it bit Sunhwa\u2019s throat.Cruuuunch\u2013!The clone\u2019s teeth were unable to pierce through Sunhwa\u2019s neck.Meanwhile, Hyukjin finished his calculations.\u2018The true body\u2026 has no intention of coming here.\u2019If they attacked the clone too fiercely, the true body would unconditionally flee. That left only one option\u2014he had to catch the true body.\u2018My 11 o\u2019clock. About thirteen meters away.\u2019Eye of Perception pinpointed the Six-Tailed Fox\u2019s location, but he had no way to drag it down or hunt it right now.\u2018Or wait.\u2019Upon second thought, there\u00a0was\u00a0a way to kill it.[You have opened the Item Shop.]Like a long-term Player, Hyukjin opened the Item Shop with practiced ease and selected the sub-category he wanted.\u2018Weapons &amp; Armor.\u2019[Item Shop \u2013 Beginner-grade \u2013 Weapons &amp; Armor]Beginner Iron Sword 500 CoinsBeginner Helmet 470 Coins\u2026Beginner Dagger 260 Coins\u2026Beginner Shoes 480 CoinsThey weren\u2019t in a dungeon or a gate, but a regular \u2018field\u2019. There was no restriction on shop use.[Beginner Dagger purchased.][-260 Coins][Beginner Dagger purchased.][-260 Coins]The Iron Sword disappeared from Hyukjin\u2019s hand and was replaced by a \u2018Beginner Dagger\u2019. He would throw this dagger to kill the true body hidden in the tree.\u2018I\u2019ve never done it before, but\u2026\u2019Somehow, he was full of confidence. He\u2019d never thrown a dagger before, and never hunted anything like this, yet the evolved form of Sixth Sense, Eye of Perception, was drawing out Hyukjin\u2019s success. It outlined exactly how he should throw the dagger and the exact trajectory it would follow.\u2018If I throw this\u2026\u2019The question wasn\u2019t\u00a0will it hit?\u2018I can hit it.\u2019It was an instinctive feeling.[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 shows interest in your throwing ability.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 observes you.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 sneers at you.]His intention indeed merited ridicule. After all, Hyukjin had no System skill whatsoever, and certainly nothing like Knife Throwing.\u2018Here I go.\u2019He didn\u2019t think about it for too long. He simply threw the dagger, unassisted by any kind of skill. Hyukjin threw the dagger, relying purely on his physical ability.Fwip!The dagger left Hyukjin\u2019s hand and whistled forward like an arrow.And shortly afterwards\u2014Thud!A thump came from afar. Something fell from the tree. Hyukjin ran to his 11 o\u2019clock, and as he did so, the clone Sunhwa had been fighting grew faint before disappearing.\u201cOppa?\u201d Sunhwa exclaimed, staring at Hyukjin as he ran past.His movements were extremely fast. Sunhwa followed his path to the base of the tree, where she saw a fox with a dagger planted precisely in the middle of its forehead. Blood was flowing freely from its forehead, and the fox was convulsing with occasional twitches.\u2018Wha\u2014?\u2019 Seeing it now, the situation became clear to her. \u2018He threw a dagger and hit it?\u2019That was absolutely no small distance.\u2018From here, to there??\u2019But he had hit it, and squarely in the middle of the head.\u2018Did oppa have a throwing skill?\u2019She didn\u2019t think so. Sunhwa dazedly saw that Hyukjin had already re-equipped his Iron Sword. He swung his sword at the Six-Tailed Fox standing briefly stunned at the base of the tree, precisely slitting its throat open.Hyukjin\u2019s movements weren\u2019t very flashy. They were\u00a0clean.Thump.The fox\u2019s head fell to the ground.[You have killed a Six-Tailed Fox.][EXP acquired.][30 Coins acquired.]A ray of blue light shone from Hyukjin\u2019s body.[Congratulations.][Your level has increased!][Current level: 26]Hyukjin himself was a little bewildered.\u2018It really worked?\u2019Before throwing the dagger, he was sure it would hit, but seeing it really become reality was a strange feeling.[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 is pleased by your dagger throwing ability.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 is flabbergasted.]Hyukjin tapped the body of the \u2018Six-Tailed Fox\u2019, and a yellow light flashed from its body. An item dropped onto the ground.\u2018Oh.\u2019It was only a slim possibility, but he really did get it. Later, he\u2019d be able to make good use of it in the Shot Table Dungeon.[\u2018Fox Tail\u2019 acquired.]He was packing it away when Senia appeared.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin.

I was sure she was curious about my level. The Guardians were probably itching to know as well.\u201cScan me.\u201dShortly afterwards, Senia\u2019s wingtips trembled.\u201cYou\u2019re level 26.\u201dI shrugged. Her words weren\u2019t said to me, but for the benefit of the Guardians. Sure enough, a stream of notices showed the Guardians were shocked by my leveling speed.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 finds your leveling speed intriguing.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 feels pride in your leveling speed.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 feels a sense of kinship with your leveling speed.]\u2018That\u2019s right.

Because I can be your \u2018good quality content\u2019 anytime.\u2019[The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is spurred by your leveling speed into contemplating giving you a trial.]\u2018Don\u2019t think about something like that. The Courageous Lion King\u2019 is crazy enough for me.\u2019[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 complains to the Intermediate Administrator.]Hm?\u2018Complain?\u2019I thought about what kind of complaint it might be. The Streamer Senia opened her mouth, but I couldn\u2019t hear her voice. She was most likely conversing with the Guardians.\u2018What the Lady of the Scales could be complaining about in this situation has to be\u2026\u2019It was obvious.\u2018I\u2019m level 26. But I haven\u2019t advanced yet.\u2019I hadn\u2019t had my first advancement yet. The Guardians knew that when Players hit level 25, they were supposed to advance.\u2018That the System update hasn\u2019t happened yet is one thing, but\u2026\u2019 I hummed to myself. \u2018The problem is that Senia didn\u2019t make any notice about it to me.\u2019I became level 26 without getting a notice from her. The Lady of the Scales prioritized fairness above all. Her complaint was probably something along those lines.\u2018This is gonna be troublesome.\u2019So I approached Senia. The Lady of the Scales was an extremely famous and powerful Guardian. She was an upper being so powerful she could easily bury a new Streamer like Senia six feet under.\u2018I also need Senia.\u2019Where else would I find such an inarticulate and lousy Streamer? A Streamer like her was the easiest to take advantage of. I sent Senia a whisper request. Although she was expressionless, considering the intensity of her wingtip trembling, she was apparently having quite the mental breakdown.I whispered to Senia.\u2013You\u2019re in trouble because of the advancement notice, yeah?Unable to pay much attention to me, Senia continued to mumble.\u2013I\u2019ll tell them that I already got the advancement notice and I\u2019m waiting to advance when I reach level 30.Only then did Senia turn to stare at me. Her eyes were trembling ever so slightly, but I could see countless questions within them, almost like she was asking, \u2018Just who are you?\u2019 Of course, I had no intention of answering that.\u2018You and I are already in the same boat,\u2019 I thought. \u2018You\u2019ve just got to believe me. What other choice do you have?\u2019And it wasn\u2019t going to be for free.\u20133,000 Coins.To get 3,000 Coins, you\u2019d have to kill a whopping 100 Six-Tailed Foxes that gave 30 Coins each.\u2013\u2026\u2013If you don\u2019t want to, forget it. The Lady of the Scales\u2019 temper has got to be something else, but oh well. Do your best to figure it out.I turned without reluctance. I heard Senia\u2019s voice. Naturally, it was a whisper only I could hear.\u2013How about 2,000 Coins?\u20133,000.\u20132,200.I shook my head. She was the one in the frying pan, not me.\u20133,000.\u2013\u2026She had to have made at least 5,000 Coins while streaming me as her content. Since it seemed she wasn\u2019t grasping the gravity of her situation, I said a bit more.\u2013Senia. You\u2019re getting pressure from the Lady of the Scales right now, right? The Lady of the Scales is fundamentally a Guardian who\u2019s capable of acknowledging her own mistake. As long as I put in a good word for you, the Lady of the Scales will probably apologize to you, you know? She\u2019ll send at least a few thousand Coins.Actually, I didn\u2019t know whether the Lady of the Scales would send that much or not, but it didn\u2019t matter. It wasn\u2019t my problem.\u2013How about 2,700?\u20133,000.Senia\u2019s wingtips trembled once again.\u2013I agree to 3,000.Senia was a nearly expressionless rock, but somehow, I had the impression she was speaking through gritted teeth.\u2013Send the contract. I\u2019ll sign it.A contract was sent to my Inventory, meaning our deal was a success.Feigning total ignorance, I said, \u201cOh, right. I\u2019m gonna advance when I reach level 30, Senia. So don\u2019t nag me about it.\u201dEven if the situation hadn\u2019t been like this, I had been planning on saying this anyway. I said them to the Guardians, making it clear that I would advance at level 30.\u2018Level 30.\u2019That was the one and only time when a Player could stand above the Guardians\u2014the time when the Player selected their Guardian.The flurry of unexpected messages that came next took me by surprise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At the very least, the sword\u2019s attack power was very nearly the best you could get in the \u2018beginner period\u2019. It did have the weakness of low durability, but even so, it was an item of a prowess far above my current level.\u2018Why this?\u2019It wasn\u2019t just the Lady of the Scales.[The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 wishes to nurture you.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 shows a great favor towards your craftiness and resourcefulness.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 wishes to gift you \u2018Devil\u2019s Fruit\u2019.]This time, even the Devil\u2019s Fruit made an appearance.\u2018A fruit that forcefully advances you into the evil-alignment faction.\u2019Players in the evil faction enjoyed fast growth and were very strong. Up until the middle period, most of the people who could be called \u2018masters\u2019 had evil-alignment classes. If I were to use the \u2018Devil\u2019s Fruit\u2019 right now, I would instantly become the top-level ranker.\u2018But I\u2019m already the top-level ranker anyway.\u2019Other nations were just starting the Tutorial, and I most likely had the highest level in Korea. The \u2018Devil\u2019s Fruit\u2019 came with disadvantages that were as big as its advantages. After a certain point, further growth was difficult, and in the worst case scenario, you would be swallowed by \u2018demonic energy\u2019 and lose all reason.\u2018One misstep, and you\u2019ll become a berserker.\u2019The only person who overcame that and climbed to the top was the Demon King himself, Kang Sun-il.In any case, I had an idea as to why these Guardians were suddenly wanting to send me gifts.\u2018Could it be\u2026\u2019Actually, I already knew. It was just that I needed a little time to be sure.\u2018That they\u2019re trying to brown-nose me before the Guardian selection?\u2019I couldn\u2019t believe it, but that was how it was. I would pick my Guardian when I reached level 30. The Guardians were always reigning high \u2018up there\u2019, but for the Guardian selection, and the Guardian selection alone, they were at the mercy of the Player.\u2018That\u2019s what it is.\u2019So basically, the Guardians were preening their feathers, saying:\u00a0Look, I\u2019m this great of a Guardian.\u00a0But I found it a little absurd. I was just one person, but a whole range of descriptions were tacked onto me. Prudence, composure, courage, sense of justice, chivalry, craftiness, the whole gamut. These guys clearly only saw what they wanted to see.[The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 shows great interest in your talent.]Finally, even the Guardian of the Sword Empress began to come forward.[The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 wishes to make you a priest.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 wishes to pass down the \u2018Heavenly Demonic Art\u2019 to you.]The Nameless Observer. The Courageous Lion King. The Lady of the Scales. The Whispering Devil. And now, even the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain. I wasn\u2019t even level 30 yet, but there was a frenzied rush to recruit me.Compared to the rest, the notices from the \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019, who had observed me ever since the Tutorial, were a little shabby. They only said they were continuing to observe me.Senia said to me, \u201cThe Guardian Lady of the Scales has gifted me a \u2018pause\u2019 authority. As Player Kim Hyukjin knows, pause authorities are extremely expensive.\u201dThe world turned gray. The only spots of color were me and Senia. I took this as the Lady of the Scales acknowledging her mistake.\u2018A pause authority. It\u2019s not just a reconciliation gift.\u2019Why did the \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 gift Senia a \u2018pause\u2019 at exactly this time? To let me and Senia talk comfortably? It couldn\u2019t be just that.\u2018She\u2019s showing off her wealth.\u2019Simply put, she was saying:\u00a0I have a lot of money; I have a lot of Coins. So when you reach level 30, pick me.\u2018In all honesty, the Lady of the Scales is a Guardian who gives really generous support.\u2019I was left contemplating for a moment.\u2018At least in the early period, there\u2019s no mistake that my talent is remarkable.\u2019I had met both the Fist King and the Sword Empress, but no one had greater talent than me. At least in the current period, my talent was the most outstanding, and the same went for my knowledge.\u2018That must be why the Guardians are competing amongst each other like this.\u2019It was all in order to nurture the Players who would become their avatars or incarnations. I had no right to converse with the Guardians in person. You could say I was a character in a game. The Guardians and I could only communicate through the Streamer Senia.\u201cSenia. You know all the proposals I got, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI could see her wingtips trembling again. My Eye of Perception picked up on a touch of Senia\u2019s emotions. Normally, it would be impossible for someone at my level to read the emotions of an \u2018Intermediate Administrator\u2019. The fact I could perceive them right now could only mean one thing.\u2018Even though she looks calm on the outside\u2026 she\u2019s just that agitated on the inside.\u2019This was what winning the lottery had to feel like. Right now, Guardians who had revealed their names, aka influential Guardians, were tripping over each other to reveal that they wanted to give gifts to the Player she had an exclusive contract with. The more Guardians like that there were, the more successful of a Streamer Senia would become.\u201cI am\u2026 very grateful for the Guardians\u2019 offers.\u201dTruthfully, I wasn\u2019t that grateful. According to what we learned over ten years, mankind was simply \u2018entertainment\u2019, nothing more and nothing less. Even \u2018absolute good\u2019 alignment Guardians were just exercising the influence of good within the \u2018fun\u2019; they didn\u2019t treat humans like real individuals. Whatever the actual truth was, that was how mankind had interpreted the Guardians.\u201cBut right now, I can\u2019t accept any of them.\u201dThis was an important moment. Guardians had a more petty side to them than one might expect, so many of them disliked it when a mere \u2018character\u2019 in a simple amusement rejected their offer.\u201cI dare not accept the offer of just one Guardian.\u201dRight now, in this very moment, it was the time for me to lower myself and be as humble as possible.\u201cAnd I dare not accept the offers of all of them.\u201dThose gifts weren\u2019t just \u2018good will\u2019 or \u2018good intentions\u2019. They were wordless messages telling me to choose them when I reached level 30. So what would happen if I accepted their presents and didn\u2019t choose them?\u2018I\u2019d be failing to draw the big picture.\u2019Now that I had returned to the past, I wanted to draw a big picture. I wanted to look a little further ahead. No matter what happened, I wanted to achieve my dreams and succeed. I too was born as a man, as a proud Korean, and I didn\u2019t want to live hand in hand with poverty any longer.To make that happen, I needed to look slightly further ahead and be more careful.\u2018Right now\u2026 I\u2019ll bow my head.\u2019There were differences depending on their dispositions, but as a whole, Guardians tended to prefer Players who were deferential to them. For most cases, my current actions were the right call.\u201cFor now, I will simply appreciate the intent of all the Guardians who are sponsoring me\u2026 and Play with my very best effort.\u201dThe Guardians retracted their \u2018gifting intentions\u2019. I grinned inwardly. Depending on what I did, what actions I took, I could serve the Guardians like they were my masters, or turn them into total pushovers.\u2018Just like how you guys are watching me like your personal jester for entertainment\u2026\u2019I would turn them into pushovers.\u2018I\u2019ll make full use of you.\u2019Like boiling a frog, very, very slowly, little by little. Especially that courage-lover. I was determined to make the Lion King go bankrupt, without fail. Even now, thinking about the time I almost died in the magic troll raid gave me a spike of rage.Senia\u2019s voice interrupted my thoughts.\u201cThe pause will soon end.\u201dWith that, the pause ended.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://discord.gg/reapercomics* * *After hunting the Six-Tailed Fox, the two of us started heading home. In one day, my home would change\u2014we\u2019d be moving to the apartment my mom had always dreamt of. While on the road, I got a call. It was from Shin Yeonseo.\u2013That was you, right?\u2013What?\u2013You killed a monster at Mt. Inwang, yeah?What the heck? The incident hadn\u2019t gotten in the media and wasn\u2019t at all publicized. I had no idea how she found out so soon and called me.\u2013Yeah. That was me.And then, out of nowhere\u2014\u2013Thanks.After talking with her a little, I found out that she wasn\u2019t joking. When I nabbed the win in the PVP battle we had, Yeonseo had said something after yelping, \u201cMommy!\u201d[Man, if our Mrs. Han Myunghye had seen me just now, she would\u2019ve been shocked, huh? I haven\u2019t called for my mommy since elementary school.]One of the women Sunhwa and I had saved today was named \u2018Han Myunghye\u2019. In other words, the person we saved today on Mt. Inwang was the mother of the future Sword Empress, Shin Yeonseo.\u2018I can\u2019t tell\u2026 if this is a good or bad thing for Yeonseo.\u2019If Yeonseo\u2019s mom, Han Myunghye, had died today?\u2018She would\u2019ve been burning for revenge.\u2019The Sword Empress had once said that the driving force for her growth was \u2018anger\u2019 or \u2018desire for revenge\u2019. Back then, I didn\u2019t know exactly why that was the case, because she never publicized her personal matters, but it turned out that way back in the beginning, one of the victims of the tragedy of Mt. Inwang was the Sword Empress\u2019 mother.\u2018But now, her mom is alive.\u2019Did that mean the Sword Empress\u2019 growth would be stalled? Because her driving force was gone? Was I changing the future a lot right now? I didn\u2019t know. I\u00a0couldn\u2019t\u00a0know. But I didn\u2019t regret my actions. I couldn\u2019t save everyone, and there was no need to give up on my gains purely to save people, but it was only right to save the people I could save in front of me. I did the right thing.\u2013Thanks. I\u2019ll be sure to repay this favor.Those were the same words I\u2019d heard multiple times from So Yoohyun. Somehow, Yeonseo and Yoohyun overlapped in my mind.\u2013What favor? I just happened to be there by coincidence.\u2013I believe that there\u2019s no such thing as coincidence. It\u2019s merely that the inevitable strings of fate move us, and we call that coincidence.What kind of nonsense was she going on about now?\u2013I\u2019ve decided. I\u2019ll attend to you well.And then, the call ended. I could guarantee it\u2014this girl just said what was on her mind without realizing it. Attend? I was so dumbfounded that I had to laugh. The kid walking next to me, Sunhwa, tilted her head at me.\u201cOppa. Why\u2019re you laughing like you just heard something ridiculous?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nunya business.\u201d\u201cTch, you should tell me.\u201dYep. The future Sword Empress just said she wants to attend to me. But she probably didn\u2019t know what that word really meant. Attend. The heavily implied meaning was a woman assisting a man\u2026 with\u00a0that.\u2018Whatever, I inadvertently have her owing me now.\u2019It was fine. A lot had already changed from the past. I got an apartment in my name and had $100,000 in my bank account. The future Fist King and Sword Empress had a great deal of goodwill towards me. And also, by my side was Sunhwa, a tank of perhaps even greater talent than them. So much had changed.One day passed. The Mt. Inwang incident was treated as important news in the media, with headlines like:\u2013The high-level monster that appeared on Mt. Inwang.\u2013One hiker dead, two injured with varying degrees of severity.\u2013The hero of Mt. Inwang is?It was publicized that new monsters of a completely different class from slimes had appeared, and one of those monsters killed someone. One person bled a great deal from a gash in their stomach and underwent surgery after being transferred to the hospital, but there was no danger to their life.I received a call from Yoohyun.\u2013Hyungnim! The hero of Mt. Inwang, is it you?I was about to call Yoohyun anyway. My level was 26. I had to raise it to level 30, and up until level 30, it was really helpful to have help from a party. Or rather, a party was absolutely necessary.\u2013Cut the chatter and come out to meet me.I didn\u2019t say much, but Yoohyun seemed sure that I was the hero of Mt. Inwang.\u2013I knew it was you. The true hero of this era is you, is it not?He sure was good at blathering all by himself.\u2013I admire you, hyungnim.I called Yeonseo and Yoohyun to meet at a caf\u00e9 in downtown Seoul. Of course, Sunhwa was there, too.When we were seated, I said, \u201cThere\u2019s someplace I need to go.\u201dPlaying was, of course, accompanied by danger, and that applied to geniuses, too. In order to go higher than others, faster than others,\u00a0of course\u00a0everyone would take risks. It was the same right now. I couldn\u2019t do it alone. I needed their help.\u201cWe\u2019re going\u2026\u201dI told them our destination.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35: Turtle NestJust as I expected, Yoohyun\u2019s big, calf-like eyes grew wide.\u201c\u2026What?\u201dHis massive arm moved, his bulging muscles squirming. He was sticking his pinky into his ear to scratch an itch, and the veins standing out on his biceps were like frickin\u2019 earthworms. There was no doubt about it. They were overwhelming muscles. As far as outside appearances went, this guy was undoubtedly the (future) Fist King.Yeonseo, who looked almost like a kid next to Yoohyun, stared blankly at me. \u201cAre you serious right now?\u201dAt about 160 centimetres, she had a cute appearance that didn\u2019t suit the Sword Empress moniker. She poked my side and laughed with a \u201cCome on! You\u2019re joking, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201dI really wasn\u2019t. I meant every word. Yeonseo blinked at me, dumbfounded. She kind of gave me the impression of a chipmunk.\u201cSo let me get this straight. You\u2019ll pay for our flight tickets and accommodations, so let\u2019s go on a vacation to Japan?\u00a0Tomorrow?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhen did I ever say we were going on a vacation?\u201cGet your head on straight. We\u2019re not going on a vacation. We\u2019re going to do a raid.\u201d\u201cAh, yeah. Right. Sorry. Thought it was a vacation.\u201dI definitely said raid, but I guess she interpreted it as a vacation since it would require a flight on an airplane. It would apparently be Yeonseo\u2019s first flight, or something like that.\u201cBut we\u2019re not that close, are we? Not enough to stay out overnight and go on a trip together,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cJeez, why so harsh? It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to.\u201d She seemed a bit troubled. \u201cIf I skip class again, I\u2019ll get an F\u2026\u201dAh. The current Sword Empress was just an ordinary university student. The sight of the future Sword Empress being troubled over an F was almost fascinating to me. She was thinking about it really seriously.Eye of Perception was telling me as much.State: Serious / Thinking HardIt was obvious even to Eye of Perception, which only picked out the most salient states.\u201cAhh! Whatever. I\u2019ll just think about it like a date. I\u2019m coming, too.\u201dActually, I thought Yeonseo would refuse. I might have saved her mom before, but we weren\u2019t all that close, and it wasn\u2019t like we were in an intimate relationship. Even so, she said she would come. I was going to go to Osaka even without her, but this was better.\u2018It\u2019s much better if Yeonseo comes along.\u2019After Yeonseo agreed to come, Yoohyun pounded his chest a couple of times with those bulky arms of his. He was like a human gorilla.\u201cI\u2019ll go wherever hyungnim goes, no matter where! Even if that place is Japan!\u201dTo be more precise, it was Osaka, Japan. It wasn\u2019t possible to go to Tokyo at the moment because the Tutorial was still in progress there.\u201cI already owe you my life. Where\u00a0wouldn\u2019t\u00a0I dare to go for you? I might hate Japan, but I\u2019ll go anyway.\u201dIt didn\u2019t look like Yoohyun went through much mental calculation or anything. He didn\u2019t ask what would happen if he came or what was there and simply gave me his answer first.\u201cIf you\u2019re a man, once you give your word, that\u2019s that, right?\u201dI remembered his summary.Summary: Debt-Repaying MagpieBefore, I only focused on the \u2018Debt-Repaying\u2019 part, but now, I was starting to understand why the \u2018Magpie\u2019 part was so apt.Magpies are birds, and birds aren\u2019t that smart. There was a reason why Eye of Perception referred to magpies, a type of bird. The Fist King ten years later seemed to have become smarter after rolling with the punches for a decade, but the current Yoohyun was the epitome of simplicity and honesty.\u2018That\u2019s not a bad thing.\u2019Though simple and honest, this \u2018Debt-Repaying Magpie\u2019 put an immensely high value on loyalty. The way he was right now, he would probably even sacrifice his life for me.Sunhwa asked, \u201cOppa, what about me?\u201dSunhwa, who was clutching a corner of my clothes, seemed to be saying, \u201cI want to go too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take care of your paperwork. If you don\u2019t want to go, tell me.\u201dLike it or not, she was now my little sister. With President Song Kiyoung\u2019s assistance, everything sorted itself out with lightning speed, almost like popping a bag of popcorn with a lightning bolt. This was the power of a chaebol. In any case, Sunhwa was now legally 100% my little sister, and her name was even changed to \u2018Kim Sunhwa\u2019.\u201cNo! I want to go! A lot! I\u2019ve never gone on a plane before!\u201dWith that, our party was set. The future Fist King, the future Sword Empress. Me, the person familiar with the strategy. And finally, our little tank, who I felt was even more talented than the Fist King or Sword Empress.\u2018With this combo\u2026 It\u2019s got to be the strongest for the beginner level.\u2019Yoohyun was a tank/DPS.Yeonseo was a DPS.Sunhwa was a tank.\u2018And me?\u2019What was I? It was a bit hard to say. I was also a tank/DPS, but\u2026 It didn\u2019t feel quite right to just put it as that.\u2018Whatever.\u2019That wasn\u2019t important. The important thing was that our party was formed and we\u2019d be going to Osaka tomorrow.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://discord.gg/reapercomics* * *My sister\u2019s reaction was exactly as I expected.\u201c\u2026\u201dShe didn\u2019t let much of her feelings show, simply staring at me once with a curt expression. Then, she asked, \u201cThe hell is this?\u201d\u201cOur house.\u201d\u201cSo, I\u2019m asking, the hell is this?\u201d\u201cThe house where we\u2019ll be living.\u201d\u201cExplain.\u201dFor now, my sister didn\u2019t seem too happy.State: Uneasy / Doubt / WorryIt was a natural reaction. I suddenly brought her to a 110 m\u00b2 newly built apartment in downtown Seoul, something ordinary folks could hardly dream of, so she was more taken aback and fearful than happy. She was worrying about whether I did something bad, or what in the world I did to get this. Her suspicion and fear was all too natural and reasonable.\u201cI won something like the lottery.\u201d\u201c\u2026Lottery?\u201dIt would take a long time to explain, and I couldn\u2019t explain everything in detail anyway. I also had no real desire to do so. The Playing I was going to keep doing was dangerous, no two ways around it, and both my mom and sister would worry greatly about me if they knew. I didn\u2019t really want to worry them.\u201cNoona. Listen. I\u2019ve become a Player, and I\u2019m now enjoying first-mover advantages. I recently met with the president of Sungshin and got a sponsorship.\u201dI gave her a bare-bones explanation.\u201cSo I bought a house. Mom, you, and me. Sunhwa getting adopted as a daughter of our family was also super easy thanks to this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t do anything really dangerous. You know me, noona. I\u2019m a wuss.\u201dThough I\u00a0did\u00a0kill a lycanthrope and a magic troll in the Tutorial, cleared the Seoul Station Dungeon and a gate, and was leaving the country to go to Osaka tomorrow. Ah, right. I also caught a six-tailed fox. All of those things screamed Danger with a capital D, but I said it was safe.\u201cThe world is changing quickly, and I\u2019m adapting to it.\u201dThere was no need for my mom and sister to adapt. They could live as they always had. They just had to keep going, staying safe. I would do all the adapting. I alone was more than enough.\u201cI\u2019m adapting really well, you know?\u201dThe former civil service student was gone. I was combing through strats hundreds\u2014even thousands\u2014of times a day, making plans for the future. And with every passing day, I was making those plans a reality. Because I didn\u2019t want to be filtered out by natural selection like last time, I was spending every second like it was precious and doing my best. This time, I was determined to live well.\u201cSo don\u2019t worry. This is a house I purchased through totally reasonable and not dangerous means by enjoying my first-mover advantage. Noona, explain it to mom for me later.\u201dMy sister\u2019s \u2018state\u2019 changed a little.State: Doubt / Uneasy / ReliefRelief was added, and she became a little more relaxed. For today, that was enough.\u201cNoona. Trust me. I don\u2019t do bullshit things.\u201dI asked her to explain things to mom for me. My mom was a woman of many worries. She wouldn\u2019t accept things as easily as my sister, and it would take time to explain every little thing.I grinned.\u201cI\u2019m getting on an early morning flight to go on a trip to Japan. With my friends. I\u2019ve won the lottery, so I\u2019m gonna go enjoy it once.\u201d* * *Our destination was Osaka. In order to get to Osaka, our plane landed in the \u2018Kansai International Airport\u2019.\u201cAwesome. Awesome. Freaking awesome.\u201dYeonseo, who was donning a light and fluttery sky-blue dress, kept spewing out \u2018awesome\u2019, her face full of excitement. There was no need for her to be tense yet, so I just let her be.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time ever going on an airplane, and it\u2019s not even to Jeju Island, but over frickin\u2019 seas. And for\u00a0free.\u201d She raised her thumb at me. \u201cOur magnanimous Mr. Hyukjin is covering all our costs. Are you actually a chaebol? I\u2019ve never heard or seen of this. Usually, you\u2019re supposed to carefully plan a vacation several months in advance while saving up before you go.\u201d\u201cMy god, you have a lot to say.\u201d\u201cAnyhoo, thanks. I don\u2019t know you all that well yet, but I\u2019ll definitely buy you a meal.\u201dA meal? She would be doing quite a bit more than that. I didn\u2019t tell her yet. There was no point in telling her\u2014she just had to experience it first-hand.We took the bus all the way to the \u2018Nanba Terminal\u2019.It was called the Nanba Terminal or Nanba Station, but despite being a station, it was a place for buses to go in and out, not a subway.\u2018The place where the Nanba Terminal Dungeon will form.\u2019I hadn\u2019t decided yet whether I would come back here to clear that dungeon or not. It was still a minimum of one year in the future, after all. Nevertheless, it was good to learn the layout of this area in advance.I\u2019d seen it many times on Youtube, but seeing it in person was a different experience. It was especially important to take note of \u2018means of transportation\u2019 like the stairs, escalators, elevators, and \u2018cover\u2019 where you could hide. It was also good to visually confirm areas (spots) where you could run to in case of emergency.\u2018I think I\u2019ve got a pretty good grasp of it now.\u2019I made a point of coming here to walk around in order to engrave this place in my mind.\u2018Though well, there\u2019s nothing special yet.\u2019I took the kids on a trip around the Nanba area, absorbing information the entire time. Now that we were in Osaka, it was time to start getting a little more serious.\u201cLet me remind you once again that we\u2019re not here to play.\u201dWhen the dungeon was first generated here in Nanba Terminal, 300 people died. That was what Playing was like. Not just one, or maybe two victims, but hundreds, sometimes thousands, could be slaughtered in one fell swoop. In just Jongno alone, a staggering 145,000 people had died.\u201cWe\u2019re going to the hotel to rest a little, and then we\u2019ll go to Dotonbori.\u201dDotonbori. You could think of it as Japan\u2019s version of Korea\u2019s Myeongdong. It was a bustling place with all sorts of restaurants and shops. It was essentially the main street of Osaka. Running along the main street was a canal far bigger than Seoul\u2019s Cheonggyecheon, but still too small to be called a real river.At that, Yeonseo started to become a little tense.\u201c\u2026A gate will form in Dotonbori, right?\u201dYes. I didn\u2019t know exactly where, but there was no mistake. A gate would be generated there, almost at the same time Japan\u2019s Tutorial ended.\u2018If you look at the time at which the gate broke\u2026 It either formed right after the Tutorial, or\u2026 formed even before the Tutorial was cleared.\u2019Originally, this gate wasn\u2019t successfully cleared. After a certain amount of time, it \u2018broke\u2019. From the gate spilled out \u2018Gold Turtles\u2019 that dragged over 100 people into the water and ruthlessly devoured them.\u2018If possible, I want to find the gate and clear it.\u2019And if that was impossible\u2026\u2018We have to catch them, even if we have to do it outside the gate.\u2019Gold Turtles. Like their name suggested, they were creatures that dropped a huge amount of Coins, creatures I absolutely needed to kill.On the first day, we weren\u2019t able to find any particular things of note in Dotonbori.The second day was the same. We didn\u2019t gain much. However, there was a big change in Japan. On the second day, the \u2018Tutorial Field\u2019 in \u2018Tokyo\u2019 was cleared, and the Tutorial Ender of Japan, \u2018Seijuro\u2019, was born.\u2013The survival rate has been tallied at around 33%\u2026Far more people survived in Japan\u2019s Tutorial than in Korea\u2019s. Most of the advanced countries were familiar with Korea\u2019s situation in advance, and they had made some preparations, just in case.Soon, the world\u2019s Tutorial would come to an end. Everyone would enter \u2018beginner\u2019 fields. The levels of Players would surpass 30, going past the beginner period into level 40. When that happened, Playing in the true sense of the word would begin.The second day was as fruitless as the first. But on the third day, while we were combing through the Dotonbori region like before, we suddenly heard a voice.\u201cI\u2019ll start off by telling you in advance that you are the only ones who can see me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: Turtle Nest (2)\u201cI\u2019ll start off by telling you in advance that you are the only ones who can see me.\u201dTurning around, they saw the Streamer Senia who had an exclusive contract with Hyukjin. She was as expressionless as ever, and it was impossible to tell what she was thinking.\u2018Once the proficiency of Eye of Perception gets higher, I\u2019ll probably be able to read Senia\u2019s state.\u2019It was still a long way in the future, but Hyukjin was sure it was possible.In any case, it wasn\u2019t hard to guess why Senia made a personal appearance right now.\u2018She must be curious as to why we came to Japan, and why we\u2019ve specifically been going around like this in Dotonbori for the past few days.\u2019A Streamer had the role of transmitting and relaying coverage of Playing to the Guardians.\u2018She\u2019ll want to explain to the Guardians.\u2019Explanations like \u2018he\u2019s doing this and this kind of Playing here for this and that reason\u2019.\u201cWhy are you in Japan?\u201d\u201cVacation.\u201d\u201cThe composition of your group is too unordinary to see this as a simple vacation.\u201dHyukjin also acknowledged the truth behind her words, but that didn\u2019t matter.\u201cDo I have to reveal my personal matters to you? Business is business, and personal life is personal life. Even Players certainly have something called a private life. I\u2019d bet the Guardians also respect that?\u201dThe channel was likely already open. He waited for a Guardian to back up his words. For example, someone like the Lady of the Scales.[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 sympathizes with your words.]Sure enough, the Lady of the Scales backed Hyukjin up.[The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 detests your words.]Hyukjin very nearly scowled. Every time he said something undeniably right, this guy just had to show his hate.\u2018Maybe he\u2019s just a hater. For someone who\u2019s only sponsored me once, he\u2019s sure got a lot of nerve.\u2019Hyukjin crossed his arms. \u201cWhy? Is there something related to Playing here?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYep, caught red-handed.\u201c\u2026In accordance with the Commandments, an Intermediate Administrator is forbidden from personally interfering in Playing or acting in a way that leaks information.\u201d\u201cBut you\u00a0can\u00a0give information in the form of a quest.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia closed her mouth. That alone was a big clue for Hyukjin.\u2018So it\u2019s correct that a gate will form here.\u2019If he had to find the gate anyway, it would be better to get a \u2018quest\u2019 and look for it rather than going in blind. That would help in finding it, too. He could also get a quest reward just for finding the gate, so it\u2019d be like killing two birds with one stone.\u2018Though that wasn\u2019t in my plan.\u2019But that was fine. The greatest efficiency in the least amount of time\u2014that was the fundamental principle of Playing, wasn\u2019t it?Hyukjin knew.\u2018If I say something like this\u2026 then the small fry will make a fuss.\u2019He knew the insignificant Guardians who hadn\u2019t revealed their names\u2014simply put, the peanut gallery\u2014would be making a big fuss in Senia\u2019s channel.Hyukjin was right on the mark.[That\u2019s right. Let\u2019s give out a quest.][The Japan Tutorial is also over, so let\u2019s give out a quest to mix things up.][Quest! Quest! Intermediate, give him a quest!][Is there any billionaire here who would do the kindness of issuing a quest to that Player?]Senia stared at Kim Hyukjin. Actually, she had been observing Hyukjin for several hours with the channel closed. After several hours of watching, she concluded that there was no way Hyukjin was here for a vacation. From his Playing, he was definitely searching for something. And then, he suddenly riled up the Guardians by mentioning a quest, which the Guardians fell for\u2014hook, line, and sinker.\u2018Could it be\u2026 that this was what he intended?\u2019Surely not. It was unlikely that his actions were so calculated. All things considered, he was still a Player in the beginner period, and he didn\u2019t seem to have had a \u2018True Name Awakening\u2019. How could a new Player possibly manipulate the Guardians like that?\u2018It couldn\u2019t have been intentional\u2026\u2019There was no way. No matter how shabby the Guardian, as long as they wanted to, it was no difficult feat to squash one measly Player, though it did take a lot of Coins. How could a Player dare to play tricks on such powerful beings?A Player who didn\u2019t know that fact wouldn\u2019t be able to do such a thing, and a Player who did know wouldn\u2019t dare to do such a thing.\u2018There\u2019s no way, but I think it was intentional.\u2019The possibility was very high. Logically, it shouldn\u2019t be the case, but Senia\u2019s eyes and intuition were telling her that this Player, Kim Hyukjin, intentionally created this situation.The Player she was doubting, Hyukjin, was just as aware. He knew it was absolutely a dangerous thing to scheme with the Guardians as his opponents, to manipulate them. You could say it was like treading a tightrope.\u2018But it\u2019ll take more than this to kill me.\u2019And one day, the roles would be reversed. Because the Guardians were many, but he was just one person. There were many Guardians who could replace another Guardian\u2019s spot, but there was no Player who could replace him. He would make it so that he was irreplaceable.Senia calmly opened her mouth, forming silent words that Players couldn\u2019t hear in a \u2018Guardian\u2013Intermediate Administrator\u2019 conversation.\u201cI have the authority to issue a quest, but I lack the Coins for one.\u201dShe was perfectly calm about it and only spoke the truth without expecting much. A stream of administrator messages instantly flooded her.[The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 wishes to issue a quest.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 wishes to issue a quest.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 wishes to issue a quest.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 wishes to issue a quest.]A whopping four Guardians requested a quest. Senia was rendered speechless for a while. It took a lot for Guardians to open their purses, but they were clamoring over something as minor as a \u2018quest bestowal\u2019. And they weren\u2019t even small fries, but four\u2014four!\u2014Guardians who had \u2018True Names\u2019.That just meant they were watching Kim Hyukjin\u2019s Playing that seriously.But just then, another message popped up.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 has sent you a 3,000 Coin sponsorship.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 wishes to issue a quest.]With that, the Nameless Observer became the quest giver. The other Guardians fell quiet.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 does not wish to reveal their name.]As such, the quest was given in Senia\u2019s name.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 Ash* * *Senia issued our party a quest.[The quest \u2018Turtle Nest\u2019 has been triggered.][Clear the \u2018Turtle Nest\u2019.]I found it a little odd.\u2018Senia herself issued the quest?\u2019By the standards of the future, she was a Streamer who wouldn\u2019t be able to survive. In other words, she lacked the funds. She had even sacrificed 3,000 Coins to me, so she shouldn\u2019t have any leeway to issue a quest.\u2018An Intermediate Administrator\u2019s quest\u2026\u2019Was she overflowing with Coins?\u2018I thought one of the Guardians would issue it.\u2019I couldn\u2019t read anything from Senia\u2019s expression. It did look like she had a chat with the Guardians opened and was talking to them, but it was hard to discern everything from just that.Yeonseo murmured as if amazed, \u201cIt\u2019s a quest.\u201d[Quest \u2013 Turtle Nest]Traces of a suspicious gate have been discovered somewhere in Dotonbori.Find and destroy the Turtle Nest.\u201cLooks like there really is a gate somewhere around here.\u201d\u201cThen did you think there wouldn\u2019t be one?\u201dI could feel that Senia was concentrating on our conversation. She had to be extremely curious. Why I formed a party and came to Japan, and Dotonbori in Osaka of all places, how I knew, she had to be curious about it all.\u201cBut you know, it\u2019s really amazing. You seem like a genius, or maybe like you have some kind of special ability.\u201dI just chuckled. I could only laugh when faced with this Sword Empress in her pure days who was sincerely amazed. I never knew that one of the 8 Heroes who would lead the future, the Sword Empress who confronted the Demon King, was ever this pure and innocent.\u201cWhy\u2019re you laughing?\u201d\u201cJust \u2018cause.\u201d\u201cBe honest, you thought I was cute, right?\u201d\u201cYou crazy? Do you not know what cute is?\u201d\u201cBut really, how did you know to come here? I\u2019m like seriously curious.\u201dEven though I was talking to Yeonseo, I was still keenly cognizant of Senia. My brain was whirling, thinking about how best I should answer.\u201cI had a dream.\u201d\u201cA dream?\u201dSenia\u2019s wingtips fluttered. Yes, a dream. This was a good answer. I decided to elaborate a little.\u201cSomething like a precognitive dream.\u201d\u201cP-Precognitive dream? That kind of stuff really exists?\u201d\u201cThere are Players, there are monsters, and there are dungeons, so do you think precognitive dreams are out of bounds?\u201d\u201cT-That\u2019s true, I guess.\u201dOf course, I hadn\u2019t had one. Seeing as Senia was talking to the Guardians again, it looked like she had begun to fall for it. After all, there really were Players who awakened an innate ability called \u2018Precognitive Dream\u2019. It was also a somewhat more common ability than one might expect.After walking for a bit, Sunhwa tugged my sleeve. \u201cOppa, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\u201cThat so?\u201dIt was indeed\u00a0about time to eat. We\u2019d all become Players, but after walking all day long, it was natural that Sunhwa would become hungry and tired.I decided to stop for a meal.\u201cIs there anything you want to eat?\u201d\u201cCan I really say what I want to eat?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a big deal or anything, but Sunhwa only answered after squirming for a while, like she wasn\u2019t used to such kindness.\u201cI want to eat gyukatsu.\u201d* * *Hm. How to explain this.\u201cKyaaaaaaa!\u201dPeople were screaming as they scrambled out. I could see a Japanese sign in front of me, and even though I couldn\u2019t read it because it was in Japanese, the picture was definitely \u2018gyukatsu\u2019. We came here to eat gyukatsu because Sunhwa said that\u2019s what she wanted, but it turned out that people were screaming as they fled from that very gyukatsu restaurant.\u201cD-Do you think it\u2019s okay to go inside, hyungnim?\u201dYoohyun appeared a little frightened, which didn\u2019t match his enormous bulk in the least. It almost looked like his big, sturdy muscles were shriveling a tiny bit.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dI walked into the gyukatsu restaurant. Everyone had left, leaving the restaurant completely deserted. Inside, I saw something that looked like a black hole. It was possible to click it.[Gate \u2013 Turtle Nest]\u201cWe found\u2026 it?\u201d said Yeonseo, rather bitterly.My feelings mirrored her own. We came because Sunhwa said she wanted to eat gyukatsu, and it just so happened that a gate opened here, as if to mock our efforts for the past three days.\u2018It must be a coincidence, right?\u2019It was probably just a coincidence, but why\u2026 did I get the feeling it wasn\u2019t? Still, it was more appropriate and simple to pass it off as a coincidence for now.\u201cAre we going in, hyungnim?\u201d\u201cYeah. Sunhwa, you take the lead.\u201dYoohyun and Yeonseo were clearly not yet used to pushing a young girl to the front, but they didn\u2019t contradict me. We had to get used to this. Even that strong-looking body of Yoohyun\u2019s wasn\u2019t as sturdy as Sunhwa\u2019s. We couldn\u2019t let ourselves be misled by outer appearances.Sunhwa was also used to my methods by now. To be more precise, she was faithful to her role.\u201cGot it.\u201dOnce a gate was cleared, it would normally disappear. Before I regressed, the \u2018Turtle Nest\u2019 was originally a gate that had broken, and because of that, there was no strategy for it. In other words, we would have to clear this gate without a strategy guide.[You have entered the Turtle Nest.]Even so, I had plenty of confidence. Japan had just barely cleared their Tutorial. At most, the gate wouldn\u2019t exceed \u2018beginner\u2019 grade. And we were a party of four people who could be called top rankers in the beginner grade.\u2018It\u2019s dark.\u2019The whole place was dark. Although the day and night cycle didn\u2019t apply to gates, to put it in terms of the time of day, it wasn\u2019t nighttime, but sometime around evening, the point at which it starts getting dark.\u2018A swamp?\u2019It was humid. The field was a large swamp, with mud at our feet and reeds and other unknown grasses growing here and there. There were also pools scattered about, with lotus flowers blooming on the surface.It was the first gate I was challenging without the strategy.\u2018Let\u2019s start by figuring out the geographic features.\u2019That was gate clearing 101. Ascertain the geographic features. Figure out the traps, the Safe Zone, and the monsters. Getting information was the first step.\u2018Huh?\u2019But someone had beaten us to it and was already inside. That someone approached us and asked,\u201cJust what the hell are you guys?\u201dThat someone\u2026 had completely slipped past Eye of Perception\u2019s radar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37: Pull it Together Already\u201cJust what the hell are you guys?\u201dI could see them with my eyes, but Eye of Perception couldn\u2019t pick up on them. That meant they were a lifeform with far greater ability than me, an existence I couldn\u2019t figure out with my level of strength.I already knew what such a being was. Even Senia, who I spoke to \u2018as if\u2019 I were careless of her status, was naturally far stronger than me. It was the same for the tiny pixie who addressed us.\u2018A Streamer.\u2019I knew this Streamer\u2019s identity. She was the Intermediate Administrator whose fame would spread wide and far in the future, one of the top three famous Streamers in Japan.\u2018The pixie Celine.\u2019She was only about as big as my finger. She had yellow hair. Looking at just her face, she gave off the feeling of \u2018Tinkerbell\u2019 from the fairytales, but her stomach was round and protruding. There was another name that was often used to refer to the obese pixie Celine. Like famous Players, she was a Streamer with a nickname.\u2018Rising Star Excavator.\u2019Celine had uncovered many genius-level Players. She had such a knack for it that there was a popular saying that those in Japan who were picked by her had at least a 50% chance of success.Before I could respond to her, Senia stepped forward first. I was the Player she had signed an exclusive contract with, her source of \u2018quality content\u2019. She was taking initiative to exclude any possibility of Celine harming me, which made this a conversation between Streamers. We couldn\u2019t butt in.\u2018If Celine is here, that means\u2026\u2019 It could only mean one thing. \u2018There should be a Player here, too.\u2019She had to be streaming someone, but I couldn\u2019t detect that Player. I had no idea where they were. They might even be in stealth mode using a \u2018bonus\u2019 they got from a Guardian.\u2018Is there a Player who already awakened and came here\u2026 In Japan, where they just finished the Tutorial?\u2019I didn\u2019t know, and I couldn\u2019t know. As far as my experience from the past went, the \u2018Turtle Nest\u2019 definitely broke. That meant it hadn\u2019t been cleared. If things followed the path of history, that meant the Player who came in here had died.\u2018Even if they already awakened, they\u2019re low-level anyway.\u2019While I was sorting out my thoughts, Celine and Senia\u2019s conversation seemed to have wrapped up. Celine snickered as she addressed us again.\u201cIn my eyes, there\u2019s something about you guys. I get the whiff of something.\u201d She stroked her protruding belly. \u201cThat\u2019s what my belly is telling me. There\u2019s something special about you guys. Like the smell of an old veteran, perhaps?\u201dCeline\u2019s eyes narrowed, almost as if she were searching us.\u201cMy, oh my. I get the strong feeling I chose the wrong server.\u201dRubbing her nose regretfully, she fluttered in place, sparkling powder falling from her tiny wings. Then, she muttered all to herself, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit late, but maybe I should switch to the Korean server\u2026?\u201dShe pointed at me with her small hand. \u201cYou. Especially you. There\u2019s something about you. I get the feeling there\u2019s something huge about you. Though I don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d Then, she turned and fluttered away like a butterfly, becoming smaller and smaller. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see each other often.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *We searched our surroundings thoroughly. The swamp had sludgy mud, thickets of plants that could be either weed or thatch, and small crabs or insects I couldn\u2019t identify crawling at our feet.After around one hour, Yeonseo asked me, \u201cWill the Clear Crystal even show up if we just look around like this?\u201dIt\u00a0was\u00a0important to look for the Clear Crystal. To clear a gate, you either had to destroy the \u2018Clear Crystal\u2019 or hunt the \u2018boss monster\u2019. Normally, you had to do one of the two.\u201cWho knows? I don\u2019t know the strategy either. We have to try to find something that might be a clue, no matter what that might be.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a lie. I knew there were definitely \u2018Gold Turtles\u2019 somewhere here, but I didn\u2019t know where. Seeing as the name of this place was \u2018Turtle Nest\u2019, the gate clearly had a close connection to \u2018Gold Turtles\u2019.\u2018It\u2019s too inefficient for us to all move in a group.\u2019\u201cLet\u2019s split up into pairs.\u201dYeonseo stared at me with a \u2018huh?\u2019, and Sunhwa tugged the hem of my clothes a little. It seemed she was reluctant to be apart from me. It was an obvious show of childishness. I didn\u2019t react to each and every one of her little actions.\u2018Because this shouldn\u2019t be that dangerous of a gate.\u2019It had appeared in a country that had just finished their Tutorial. It should be a gate that matched Japan\u2019s current level. \u2018Gold Turtles\u2019 themselves were also not very dangerous. Basically, it shouldn\u2019t be as dangerous as Sunhwa felt it was.\u201cIt\u2019s more efficient to move separately.\u201dYeonseo gave me a doubtful look. \u201cIn such a big place? What if we can\u2019t find each other again? Our smartphones have no reception here. What if we get lost?\u201d\u201cBuy a Gate Map from the Item Shop.\u201d\u201cEh? Something like that exists?\u201dOf course. Though unfortunately, it cost 1,000 Coins.\u201cWhat? But you know this thing costs 1,000 Coins?\u201d\u201cShould be cheaper than your life.\u201dYeonseo looked on the verge of tears. \u201cI just barely saved up 1,000 Coins\u2026\u201dThe mighty future Sword Empress whined, crying crocodile tears. Future Sword Empress she might be, but a low-level beginner was exactly that\u2014a beginner. Of course, I had no intention of entertaining her whining.Yoohyun resolutely said, \u201cIf hyungnim says to do it, I gotta do it.\u201d He immediately purchased the Gate Map. I also opened the Item Shop.[You have purchased a Gate Map.][-1,000 Coins]Gate Maps were \u2018minimaps\u2019 that could be used within a gate. You could check the location of party members in real time and also send a signal on the minimap when necessary.\u201cThe way to use it should be provided.\u201dThe activation word was \u2018Gate Map\u2019.\u201cIn case you\u2019re in a dangerous situation or need help, or need to communicate something, you can send a signal through the minimap.\u201dI gave a quick demonstration. The Gate Map opened up in front of me like a hologram. Our locations were marked with \u2018red dots\u2019.\u201cIf you\u2019re not in danger, but need to send an alert, use yellow.\u201dA yellow light flashed at my location.\u201cIf you\u2019re in danger, red.\u201dThis time, a red light flashed.\u201cPay constant attention to the Gate Map while you\u2019re going around. And be careful to not make too much noise, since you might pull unexpected aggro or something. The signals will alternate between yellow and red. Everyone clear?\u201dAfter trying it a few times, Yoohyun and Yeonseo quickly got the hang of using it. The same went for Sunhwa.\u201cYes, hyungnim. I\u2019ll go with Yeonseo.\u201dWe split up and started looking for something that might serve as a clue.* * *Yoohyun\u2019s Intermediate Administrator, Neptune, was forced to come to terms with an unbelievable situation.\u2018Guardians who didn\u2019t reveal their names\u2019 were definitely rabble. They were commonly referred to as \u2018beggars\u2019 among the Streamers, but they were certainly important all the same. There had to be many of these \u2018beggars\u2019 in order to increase Guardian viewer count, which then increased an Intermediate Administrator\u2019s rank, allowing them to draw in more Guardians.\u2018My channel\u2026\u2019Wasn\u2019t just a little emptier than usual, but\u2026\u2018Is way emptier than usual.\u2019How could this be?[The \u2018Constellation of the Red Wish\u2019 has left.][The \u2018Master of the Whirlwind\u2019 has left.]Even two Guardians who had revealed their True Names left his channel.\u2018There\u2019s even Shin Yeonseo here!\u2019Shin Yeonseo was an outstandingly talented Player, a promising Player who had caught the attention of important Guardians like the \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019. Even though there were two talents here, nearly half of his viewers had left.There was one reason for it.\u2018There\u2019s no mistake. They\u2019ve flocked to Senia.\u2019So Yoohyun was definitely \u2018quality content\u2019. But Senia had \u2018quality content\u2019 even better than that, and the Guardians had apparently entered Senia\u2019s channel in great numbers.Neptune began to do his role as an Intermediate Administrator, using his characteristic way of speech.\u201cGreat Guardians, don\u2019t you think Player Kim Hyukjin is simply too strange? Do you think Senia explained the Gate Map to him in advance? He seemed too familiar with it.\u201dKim Hyukjin already had an \u2018exclusive contract\u2019 with Senia. He could only be closely observed through Senia.Right now, it was necessary to stir up \u2018intrigue\u2019 that had no basis in reality.\u201cIn order to relieve your curiosity, I will try making a formal appeal. I get the feeling that he\u2019s using a bug somehow. I will look into it.\u201d* * *So Yoohyun cleared the reed forest as he walked.\u201cCareful, careful.\u201dHyukjin had told him to constantly watch his feet, since there could be pits of water in the ground. In swamps like these, there were usually quagmires. That\u2019s why they moved in pairs\u2014one person in front, one in the back. In case the person in the front fell into a bog, the person in the back could fish them out.\u201cIsn\u2019t that a monster over there?\u201dThere was something moving slowly within the thicket.Gold Turtle LVL 11\u201cIt\u2019s only level 11. Do we kill it?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s send a yellow signal to hyungnim first.\u201dWhen they slowly got closer, they saw a turtle with a yellow shell. It was about the same size as a \u2018city fox\u2019. For a turtle, it was really big.Very slowly, they approached the Gold Turtle. However, the Gold Turtle seemed to be an extremely sensitive monster.\u201cHey, Muscles. It\u2019s hiding in its shell. What do we do?\u201d\u201cDunno. Should I beat it up?\u201d\u201cI think there\u2019s a bog up ahead. It\u2019s better to be a bit careful about it.\u201dAfter sending a signal through the \u2018Gate Map\u2019, the two of them decided to just observe. They were currently inside a gate. There was no knowing what might happen. They decided to wait for a moment until Hyukjin arrived.When a little time had passed, someone appeared from within the reed thicket.\u201cIs it you, hyungn\u2014 Ah, it\u2019s not. Who is this dude? You. Player?\u201dHe looked like a Japanese person. It was the Japanese Player being streamed by the Streamer who had a knack for uncovering rising stars, \u2018Celine\u2019. Yoohyun and the Japanese person communicated using hand gestures and broken English.\u201cUm, so. That thing. That\u2019s. You hunting?\u201dYoohyun was trying to ask if the other person was hunting that, and the Japanese person seemed to understand. He shook his head.\u201cNo. Monster. Defense. Very, very strong.\u201dHe was probably saying that the monster\u2019s defensive strength was very high. The Japanese person took something out of his Inventory. Seeing that, Yoohyun\u2019s eyes grew wide, as did Yeonseo\u2019s.\u201cWhat the heck, is this guy some kind of fisherman?\u201dInside the Japanese person\u2019s Inventory was a net-like item, and captured within that net were ten or so \u2018Gold Turtles\u2019. The problem was that all of them were hiding in their yellow shells.Yeonseo had caught the drift. \u201cSo basically\u2026 he caught them, but their defense is too high for him to kill them. So he\u2019s just collecting them. In any case, it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re strong monsters.\u201dAs far as monsters went, the only ones they could see here were those Gold Turtles, which could mean that the Gold Turtles were the key to clearing this gate. There was a high chance of that, but as beginner Players, Yoohyun and Yeonseo hadn\u2019t quite realized that yet.\u201cWhen\u2019s Hyukjin coming?\u201dIt seemed they would see a way to resolve this only if Hyukjin came. The reed thicket shook, and the three Players felt someone approaching. But just then, the Japanese person screamed and buckled.\u201cGyaaagh! N-Nandayo! (W-What the!)\u201dWhile screaming, he flailed and caught Yeonseo\u2019s ankle. Yeonseo instantly had the feeling of being sucked forward. As she staggered, she caught sight of something.\u2018W-What\u2019s that?!\u2019There was something completely different in shape than a turtle. The monster sprang out of the bog and chomped down on the Japanese person\u2019s leg, dragging him back into the bog. Before long, the bog was red with the blood pouring out of the Japanese person\u2019s body.\u201cT-Tasukete! (Save me!)\u201dHe flailed, trying not to get sucked in. He put every ounce of his strength into the hand clutching Yeonseo\u2019s ankle. Yeonseo had a hunch. If things went on like this\u2026\u2018I-I\u2019ll get sucked in, too.\u2019His determination to live, his craving for life, all of it drew forth \u2018dormant strength\u2019. Strength far greater than what he could normally muster concentrated in the Japanese Player\u2019s right hand. Some Guardian might have even gifted him something like \u2018grip strength for desperate struggling\u2019.\u2018W-What do I do?\u2019Yeonseo, who was still much closer to being a regular person than a Player, was unable to handle this unforeseen accident. Yoohyun was the same. Both of them had genius-level talent, but they were still regular people who had lived twenty ordinary years of life. They panicked, their minds going blank, and that left them completely unable to react.The Japanese man\u2019s body was already chest-deep within the bog, which was a complete sea of blood. Desperation was stark on his face. His craving for \u2018life\u2019 was written in bold letters in his eyes, as it would be for most people.\u201cTasukete! (Save me!)\u201dYeonseo\u2019s body reeled and swayed. Yoohyun, who was standing behind her, grabbed her arm. However, the strength dragging Yeonseo into the bog was stronger than his strength to resist.For a moment, Yeonseo was completely unable to act.\u2018Huh\u2026 huh?\u2019If things went on like this, it was nearly certain that her body would be dragged into the swamp. And just as she was dazedly thinking that, Hyukjin appeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38: Pull it Together Already (2)As soon as he saw a yellow signal on the Gate Map, Hyukjin moved in that direction. When that signal turned red, Hyukjin saw it.\u2018That\u2019s\u2026\u2019He couldn\u2019t get a proper look at it because of its long, protruding snout. He didn\u2019t see its name or description, and he couldn\u2019t read its exact information through Eye of Perception. However, that long, protruding snout, the sharp teeth, its hunting method of dragging prey into the swamp\u2026 Hyukjin was very familiar with this monster.\u2018A Swamp Alligator.\u2019This monster with the straightforward name, the Swamp Alligator, was about level 17. The monster\u2019s true abilities themselves weren\u2019t that strong. The problem was that this place was a \u2018swamp\u2019.\u2018An alligator in a bog\u2026 has the strength of a level 25 monster at\u00a0least.\u201dNo, it might even be higher than that. They were very tricky to hunt. In order to catch one within a bog, your attack had to punch through the bog. Normally, they were hunted by long-ranged Players with longspears, bows, or ammunition weapons.\u2018And you have to be very high-level.\u2019The bog protected it. Not only was the alligator not visible inside the bog, but it also took an attack with great piercing power to hit it. It was a monster with the exact opposite trait as a lycanthrope\u2014weak on land, but in water or when it was in a bog, it became extremely strong and difficult to face.\u201cSunhwa, take your time following,\u201d Hyukjin said.The moment he saw that snout, that bloody bog, Hyukjin instinctively realized what he had to do. He still didn\u2019t have any real experience doing this, and he had never done it personally. All he knew were the countless pieces of knowledge and strategies from the future. However, he moved naturally, as if that knowledge were already engraved in his body.[Using the special skill Flash Step.]Flash Step. The peerless, lightness technique that the \u2018Sword Empress\u2019 he knew had used. Hyukjin\u2019s body instantly disappeared and reappeared directly in front of the bloody bog, right between Yeonseo and the man being sucked in. There, he swung his sword.Crrgk\u2013!Something was sliced.At the same time, Yeonseo screamed.\u201cKyaaaa!\u201d* * *Yeonseo didn\u2019t see Hyukjin coming. She wasn\u2019t even able to determine where or when he appeared. That was because his special skill, \u2018Flash Step\u2019, allowed him to move freely to any point within the skill\u2019s range without any sound or trace.\u2018W-What?\u2019The moment Hyukjin appeared, he swung his sword. Yeonseo looked down and saw it\u2014A severed, masterless wrist, still clutching her ankle.\u2018H-H-He cut it.\u2019Blood surged out of the severed wrist like a red fountain. That fountain of blood covered Yeonseo, and the hand that had gripped Yeonseo\u2019s ankle with desperate strength fell to the ground, twitching before falling still. The \u201cKyaaaa\u201d scream that had disappeared into silence now felt like an auditory hallucination.A lot of blood splashed onto Hyukjin\u2019s body as well. He quickly ascertained the situation.\u2018He was able to grab Yeonseo\u2019s ankle this hard with just one hand?\u2019That was impossible.\u2018A Guardian\u2019s ruse.\u2019Some Guardian probably bestowed some kind of bonus in order to see an amusing spectacle. Hyukjin bit his lips. As one might expect, he was ill at ease. He had just cut off the hand of a person who had been alive until just now. He\u2019d made the decision quickly, but it wasn\u2019t like carrying it out was easy.The Guardians sent messages in response to the situation.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 continues to observe.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is happy.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 claps his hands.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is silent.]However, Hyukjin decided not to show his emotions. He turned to Yeonseo.\u201cPull it together already, will you? Why did you scream? What were you going to do if there was a monster sensitive to sound?\u201d\u201cB-But\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you had gotten dragged in, you would have also died.\u201dThe future Sword Empress, Yeonseo, hadn\u2019t yet shed her civilian shell. It wasn\u2019t like Hyukjin didn\u2019t understand that, but it was simply too dangerous.Yeonseo bit her lips, thinking, \u2018I\u2026\u2019Her mind had gone blank. She couldn\u2019t think. While she was floundering, Hyukjin had appeared and sliced off the Japanese man\u2019s hand, and thanks to that, she was able to survive. She stared at the bog, which had become a sea of blood. Even without seeing it, she knew. The Japanese Player was dead.\u2018Scary.\u2019For the briefest moment, she thought that it was scary. She bit her lips again.\u2018No. It\u2019s not scary.\u2019To be exact, it wasn\u2019t scary, but too unfamiliar. Blood. Corpses. Monsters. People dying. It was all still unfamiliar.\u201c\u2026\u201d For a long time, Yeonseo was unable to say anything. She finally opened her mouth. \u201c\u2026Sorry.\u201dShe was born with outstanding talent and qualities. It was just that they hadn\u2019t bloomed yet. She didn\u2019t have any thoughts of quitting Playing. Rather, she\u00a0wanted\u00a0to Play. Even if it was very dangerous, right now, her interest in \u2018Playing\u2019 in itself was growing.\u201cI was so shocked I couldn\u2019t think of anything.\u201d\u201cYou have nothing to apologize for,\u201d Hyukjin grunted resolutely. \u201cJust don\u2019t forget that if you hadn\u2019t been lucky, there wouldn\u2019t have been a next time.\u201dHis words were true. Even for the amazing Sword Empress, if her heart was pierced or her neck sliced, she would die. If she\u2019d been dragged into the quagmire like the man just now, she would be long dead by now. If she had been unlucky, Yeonseo wouldn\u2019t be standing here.She nodded. She understood what Hyukjin was saying. She couldn\u2019t define what he did as \u2018correct\u2019, but at the very least, she knew it was thanks to his actions that she survived.\u2018He\u2019s right.\u2019She learned something by looking at Hyukjin. It was hard to put into words, but it felt like she broke a wall. She learned firsthand that this was how you were supposed to Play. She felt like she learned a great deal about something she couldn\u2019t quite explain.\u201c\u2026Thank you. For saving me.\u201d* * *The quagmire that had sucked in the Japanese Player quickly absorbed everything, even the blood the man had spilled, becoming a bog so ordinary that nothing seemed to have happened.\u201cHyungnim, why are we still waiting here?\u201d asked Yoohyun.\u201cWe have to kill it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 alligator-like monster?\u201dI nodded. We couldn\u2019t dive into the bog. That would maybe be possible only if there were a rather outstanding elementalist or magician here.\u201cHow do we kill it?\u201d\u201cOnce it finishes its meal\u2026 it\u2019ll be drowsy.\u201dMy heart felt heavy. \u2018Finishing its meal\u2019 was basically the same thing as saying that it had eaten the Player. Regardless, after filling its stomach, the monster would emerge from the bog. Swamp Alligators liked to take naps on land.Sunhwa peered doubtfully at the bog. \u201cDoes that mean the monster will take a nap or something?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think there\u2019s a possibility that might happen?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a possibility, but a sure thing. The monster would soon surface.\u201cIt\u2019d be great if that did happen, by some chance. I get the feeling I saw something like this in a dream. For now, let\u2019s wait.\u201dMy party members looked at me with dubious expressions, shooting me looks that clearly wondered whether the alligator would truly surface, but I didn\u2019t relieve their doubts. There was no way to explain, anyway. The Streamer who couldn\u2019t violate my exclusive contract with Senia, Celine, was observing from a distance, and Senia was also waiting in silence.\u2018They must think that I\u2019m a Precognitive Dream user.\u2019Playing wasn\u2019t done alone, in a vacuum. I had to use the situation I was given to the utmost. I just had to give a justification for my actions.\u201cMy Precognitive Dream isn\u2019t complete. I can\u2019t see everything. But I know its habits, at least.\u201dThat implied that I hadn\u2019t been able to foresee the Japanese Player\u2019s death.\u2018The Lady of the Scales should be convinced with this.\u2019It was fine as long as she wasn\u2019t disappointed and was just silent. The Lady of the Scales had to know that my actions were the best I could have done in that situation. She had to know that it was better for one person to die rather than two.\u201cHuh? Hyungnim! I see bubbles.\u201d\u201cTake a few steps back.\u201dA monster with a bloodied snout came out of the water. Its name was, as expected, \u2018Swamp Alligator\u2019.Swamp Alligator LVL 18Level 18. On land, this thing was simply a level 18 prey. As if it couldn\u2019t be bothered with the likes of us, the beast heaved itself further onto land before curling up and falling asleep.Yoohyun raised his fists. \u201cI will go beat it to death.\u201dHis fists glowed with a faint blue light. He was a Player who had just reached his early level 20s, but\u2014\u2018He can already put mana in his fists?\u2019The Fist King was indeed the Fist King. Most Players would have to get through the beginner period in order to replicate the feat.Yeonseo stopped him. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll kill it.\u201dMy Eye of Perception captured Yeonseo\u2019s state.State: Rage / Cool-headed / RationalShe was definitely enraged, but cool-headed at the same time. Basically, she was in a state of cold rage. I could see that her eyes were filled with intense murderous intent.\u2018She\u2019s already grown one stage higher.\u2019Intense murderous intent billowed out from her. Once she surpassed this stage, she would learn how to hide her bloodlust, but she wasn\u2019t there yet. In any case, she had shed her civilian shell much more than before. Her near-death experience had pushed her growth.\u201cYeonseo. You do it. The weak points of most animal-type monsters are their heads.\u201dFor most of them, the middle of the forehead was one of their vulnerable spots.\u201cGot it.\u201dWith her sword drawn, Yeonseo\u2019s very aura was like a well-honed blade. She gave off the feeling of a sword. I knew this state very well. She had already reached the so-called \u2018one with the sword\u2019 realm.\u2018It\u2019s said to be the basic quality of Rankers who use the sword.\u2019It might even be that she had grown even faster than in the past. Yeonseo composed her breathing. In just one strike. Quickly. Her movements were fast and precise, aiming unerringly for the middle of the forehead, exactly one point. She quickly and powerfully pierced that spot.[You have killed a Swamp Alligator.]On top of EXP and Coins, an item dropped. Yeonseo picked it up and showed it to me.[Swamp Alligator Claw \u2013 Quest Item]The claw of a Swamp Alligator. Present it to an Intermediate Administrator to receive a quest.\u201cI think it would be best if you gave this to Senia,\u201d said Yeonseo, offering me the claw.\u201c\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t refuse. The rule was that the person who acquired the item, Yeonseo, should personally go and receive the quest. It was a fixed fact that the quest recipient would get the lion\u2019s share of the rewards. Yeonseo probably knew that as well as I did. But even so, she conceded the right to me, and I accepted it. I wasn\u2019t running a charity here.\u201cSenia. Here. Quest item.\u201dSenia issued me a quest.[You have received the \u2018Swamp Alligator Claw Acquisition\u2019 quest.]The quest wasn\u2019t all that complicated. We needed to acquire 5 \u2018Swamp Alligator Claws\u2019. The current progress was [1/5].\u2018We\u2019ve already got one.\u2019We only needed to get four more.\u201cOppa,\u201d Sunhwa said. \u201cCan we really get five of these? I can\u2019t figure out how to hunt them.\u201dIn all actuality, we had no way to hunt Swamp Alligators if they didn\u2019t come out of the bog. In the end, we had to drag them onto land somehow. Yeonseo also looked deeply troubled by the conundrum.\u201cWithout a sacrifice\u2026 we can\u2019t drag them out.\u201dThe monsters only came onto land to nap when their bellies were full.\u201cCan we really\u2026 clear this quest?\u201dWe had two quests. The first was \u2018Turtle Nest\u2019, and the second was \u2018Swamp Alligator Claw Acquisition\u2019.If we cleared the second, the first would be almost automatically cleared.\u201cWe can do it,\u201d I said.\u201cHow?\u201dThe emotion I could feel from Yeonseo via Eye of Perception was \u2018fear\u2019. It was fear towards me. I knew where that fear came from. She was likely scared that I might throw the others as sacrifices to catch the alligators.I chuckled. Did she see me as some kind of monster?\u201cLike this.\u201d[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 and four other Guardians cannot wait to hear your response.]I decided to show them the method.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39: Random Coin Box\u201cLike this.\u201dI pulled out the \u2018Beginner Longspear\u2019 I\u2019d purchased from the Item Shop, as well as another item.[Black Yak\u2019s Lean Meat]Very juicy meat.A food ingredient that can make the eater extremely full even with a very small amount.It was the Black Yak\u2019s Lean Meat I\u2019d acquired in \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon\u2019, where I\u2019d met Seo Joohwan. I never knew I would end up using this item I had stored in my Inventory here.\u2018I\u00a0was\u00a0planning on using it at some point.\u2019But I didn\u2019t think that time would come so soon. The Black Yak\u2019s Lean Meat was a big chunk of meat. I skewered two chunks of it at the end of the spear.\u201cStarting now, we\u2019ll look for bogs.\u201dThe monsters lived in bogs. If we found them on land, we could hunt them right away, and if they were submerged, we just had to drag them out.\u201cAh. So we\u2019ll be luring them out with this.\u201dI nodded. \u201cAlligator fishing. Your first time, right?\u201dOf course, it was a first for me, too.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is observing you.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is amused by your petty tricks.]The other Guardians didn\u2019t send notices. It seemed they intended on watching me a little longer.After some time, we cleared the reed thicket and discovered a large stretch of bog almost completely made up of muddy water. It was almost closer to being a pond.I submerged the spear with the Black Yak\u2019s Lean Meat in the water and swished it around. There was no need for any elaborate fishing technique or anything like that.\u2018Have a bite.\u2019If there was an alligator in this water, it would probably eat the meat. As long as it ate the meat, it would come onto land due to the special trait of the Black Yak\u2019s Lean Meat.A food ingredient that can make the eater extremely full even with a very small amount.\u2018When\u2026 will you come out.\u2019\u201cCan you really catch an alligator like this?\u201d asked Yeonseo.It did look slapdash in my eyes, too. The Beginner Longspear from the Item Shop could only be so good, and I\u2019d just slapped a few pieces of Black Yak\u2019s Lean Meat on there. Who would believe that you could catch an alligator with just this?\u201cAs long as there\u2019s one in here. Don\u2019t let your guard down. There\u2019s no knowing when it\u2019ll jump out and bite our ankles.\u201dOn the very off chance that happened\u2026\u201cCut off your ankle. That\u2019s the only way to survive.\u201dI focused my attention on the water, watching the bog that was somewhere between a swamp and a muddy pond.\u2018There\u2019s one in here.\u2019I could feel it. I couldn\u2019t see it with my eyes, but there was definitely one in there. Through Eye of Perception\u2019s faithful information relay, I felt the energy of the alligator we\u2019d seen earlier.\u2018Come.\u2019I felt it coming closer and closer, and I readied myself, not lowering my guard.\u2018So it doesn\u2019t bite me.\u2019I swished the longspear, standing as far away as possible from the bog so that the alligator wouldn\u2019t bite me instead of the meat.\u2018Bite.\u2019It came closer. The speed at which it traveled up the water was greater than I imagined. That was its special trait. I felt a slight vibration at the tip of the spear. The alligator was apparently giving it a taste.\u2018Bite.\u2019And then, there was a splash of water. Like what had happened to the Japanese Player, the alligator surged out of the water before returning to the depths.\u2018It ate it!\u2019The alligator ate the Black Yak\u2019s Lean Meat.\u201cNow, we just have to wait.\u2019It was just two chunks, but the alligator would probably feel more full than if it had eaten a human. It might taste like shit, but the \u2018Black Yak\u2019s Lean Meat\u2019 was a wildly popular dieting food.Sure enough, the full alligator crawled onto land to take a nap, and I was able to kill it without a hitch.[Swamp Alligator has been killed.][Swamp Alligator Claw 2/5]Yeonseo blinked at me. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen a monster get caught like this. How in the world did you come up with this?\u201d\u201cJust randomly.\u201dI suddenly had a certain thought. \u2018If I hadn\u2019t known this method, what would it have been like?\u2019This method was something everyone in the future knew about. But what if I weren\u2019t a regressor and were in the same position as Shin Yeonseo? And if I could use the Item Shop and already had the Black Yak\u2019s Lean Meat with me?\u2018I would have probably\u2026 figured out that these monsters came up for naps when that Player died.\u2019Even if I hadn\u2019t known the strategy from the future, I might have still been able to come up with this method. Even without the strategy, I got the sense that I would have been able to figure it out anyway.\u2018This gate is actually one I have no information about.\u2019It was still just a beginner gate, but technically speaking, I was also just a beginner level Player, wasn\u2019t I?\u2018It\u2019s easier than I thought.\u2019Even though I was challenging this gate without the strategy, I was clearing it extremely smoothly.[Swamp Alligator has been killed.][Swamp Alligator Claw 3/5][Swamp Alligator Claw 4/5][Swamp Alligator Claw 5/5]In the end, I gathered all five Swamp Alligator Claws and gave them to Senia, who took them and stood in speechless silence for a while.\u201cWhat? Is there a mistake somewhere?\u201d\u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s nothing.\u201dIn any case, the quest was cleared.[The \u2018Swamp Alligator Claw Acquisition\u2019 quest has been cleared.][Receiving quest rewards.]Since the quest was issued by an Intermediate Administrator, I also received the rewards for clearing it from Senia.\u201cThis is the quest clear reward.\u201dIt was an item.[Map of the Turtle Nest]A map of the Turtle Nest. It marks the primary features of the Turtle Nest.I got a map item. Seeing as how the map was given out so easily, this was indeed a low-level period gate.\u2018A map, huh?\u2019With this map, you could say this raid was pretty much over. Having the map was no different from starting a raid knowing almost everything about the gate.\u2018Let\u2019s take a look.\u2019I looked over the map.\u2018The habitat of the Swamp Alligators is marked\u2026 This must be the actual turtle nest.\u2019I noticed a certain spot. There was a high chance the Clear Crystal would be there. My shoulders felt quite a bit lighter.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d* * *Senia stared at Hyukjin\u2019s back as he walked in the front. He looked considerably at ease from the back, like he had become far more relaxed after getting the map.\u2018Do you know\u2026 just what you have done?\u2019The Guardians were going wild right now.[The \u2018Wanderer of the Milky Way\u2019 reveals their True Name and joins the chat.][The \u2018Eye of the Abyss\u2019 reveals their True Name and joins the chat.]Two\u00a0Guardians revealed their names. The act of doing so meant they would take action in earnest. It was known that it took a staggering fee of 1,000,000,000 Coins for a Guardian to reveal their True Name. As such, Guardians who paid the fee to do so were, at the very least, not insignificant rabble.Of course, there were still way more Guardians who didn\u2019t reveal their True Names. Like always, their responses dominated the chat.\u2013What is he?\u2013Wasn\u2019t this gate originally supposed to break? It\u2019ll get cleared if this goes on!\u2013Isn\u2019t the first scenario of the Japanese server bound to get messed up at this rate?\u2013Shouldn\u2019t the difficulty be higher for a Player of that level?The clear was nearly set in stone. Japan\u2019s first scenario quest was botched. Of course, Kim Hyukjin didn\u2019t use any illegal methods in the process. Rather, he only used the best methods available to him.\u2018Two Guardians revealed their names, and the Japanese server\u2019s scenario has gone off the rails at the first station.\u2019She peered again at Kim Hyukjin\u2019s back some distance away.\u2018Just what are you?\u2019She had scanned him last time. He didn\u2019t have anything like a \u2018True Name\u2019. He was really a \u2018human\u2019. He claimed to have the Precognitive Dream ability, but Senia didn\u2019t think he could tow along the situation like this with that alone.\u2018It might be that\u2026 the difficulty has to be readjusted.\u2019Because of just one person. No, because of the party that person led, the difficulty of the whole world might have to be readjusted.She decided to watch him a little longer.* * *I discovered a cave. It wasn\u2019t hard, since I had a map.\u2018They\u2019re not here.\u2019I couldn\u2019t see any Gold Turtles. It wasn\u2019t hard to figure out why.\u201cThe Japanese man from earlier must have found this place first.\u201dThat was likely why he had so many Gold Turtles with him. He was unable to hunt the Gold Turtles hiding inside their shells, so he just carried them along in nets.\u201cThere are a total of three caves.\u201dWe combed through this one, but there was no \u2018Clear Crystal\u2019. Since the Japanese Player had died, if the Clear Crystal had been in his Inventory, it would have respawned here. That meant it wasn\u2019t here.\u201cWe\u2019ll go through all three of them.\u201dThe next cave was inhabited by Gold Turtles. There was a fairly large pond right next to the cave.\u201cYoohyun, Yeonseo. You two make sure they don\u2019t escape into the water.\u201dEach and every one of them dropped a large number of Coins. That number was nothing to scoff at. If you were lucky, they could even drop Random Coin Boxes.\u201cWe can\u2019t get them if they go into the water.\u201d\u201cGot it, hyungnim! Leave it to me!\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll earn my keep.\u201dThe two of them blocked off the path from the cave to the pool. Upon spotting us, the Gold Turtles instantly shrank into their shells, which made them super easy to hunt. To be exact, we stuffed them all into nets, like the Japanese Player had done.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to kill them?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll do it all in one go later.\u201d\u201cWhy not do it right now?\u201d\u201cCause when all is said and done, AOE hunting\u2019s the best, you know?\u201dGathering them in one place and killing them was the most efficient. Yoohyun expressed his admiration with light claps of his hands.\u201cI see. This is also a kind of AOE farm! Didn\u2019t think we\u2019d AOE farm like this.\u201dThe Clear Crystal wasn\u2019t in the second cave, either. We arrived at the third cave, which was inhabited by quite a lot of Gold Turtles, too. We were able to catch them without any difficulty.Since the grade of the gate wasn\u2019t that high, the Clear Crystal was also not very difficult to find.\u201cOppa. The Crystal is over there.\u201dOnce we destroyed that sparkling purple crystal, this gate would be cleared.\u201cWhat should we do? Destroy it?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dFirst, we would finish hunting. I poured out all the Gold Turtles hiding in their shells in one spot. I didn\u2019t count their exact numbers, but there were around sixty of them.\u2018We should be getting a notice around now.\u2019This strategy would become very famous later on. When hunting Gold Turtles, gather as many of them as you can in one spot. It was so effective that there were even Gold Turtle farms and slaughterhouses.\u2018You\u2019re supposed to have a minimum of forty, right? I think I remember the name being Gold Turtle\u2019s Collective Spirit.\u2019[You have fulfilled the Hidden Piece \u2018Gold Turtle\u2019s Collective Spirit.\u2019]Though it was technically a \u201chidden\u201d piece, this was a strategy everyone and their mother knew about in the future.[For 30 minutes, the drop rate of Random Coin Boxes is increased by 10%.][For 30 minutes, the Coin acquisition is increased by 10%.]The least amount of effort for the greatest efficiency. This strategy accomplished that perfectly. No matter how you sliced it, this raid could be considered a huge success. It was indeed an impressively big success.

Maybe because we were in the \u2018beginner period\u2019, the System was thankfully very helpful.\u2018Detailed explanation.\u2019If a Player with the [First Pioneer] title is the first to discover a [Hidden Piece], it is possible to trigger a linked scenario. Linked scenarios can be triggered three times.Linked Scenarios Triggered: [0/3]Linked Hidden Piece: [Gold Turtle\u2019s Collective Spirit]Scenario: Hidden Boss Monster [Poison Gold Turtle] SpawnI focused on the hidden boss monster, the \u2018Poison Gold Turtle\u2019.That was a monster with a level in the early to mid-30s.\u2018If it gets a boss monster stat buff on top of that\u2026 It\u2019ll have the strength of at least a level 35 monster.\u2019In addition, the \u2018poison\u2019 attribute Poison Gold Turtle was very tricky to hunt due to its very high physical defense and propensity to spew poison at attackers. Only a Player with high poison resistance could think of hunting one.\u2018I\u2026\u2019I had to make a decision.\u2018\u2026will give up on this one.\u2019I didn\u2019t think about it for too long. Commencing a linked scenario using the \u2018First Pioneer\u2019 title was limited to three times.\u2018The risk is bigger than the benefit.\u2019It was true that I had \u2018Mandra\u2019s Gloves\u2019, an item with a \u2018poison resistance\u2019 that was nearly impossible to get in the beginner levels, but there was no real need to run the risk. I might have taken the gamble if there\u2019d been a lot to gain from killing the Poison Gold Turtle, but that wasn\u2019t the case.[Will you connect the title \u2018First Pioneer\u2019 with the Hidden Piece \u2018Gold Turtle\u2019s Collective Spirit\u2019 and commence with the linked scenario?]\u2018NO.\u2019The linked scenario commencement was canceled.\u201cWhatcha doing?\u201d asked Yeonseo, puzzled by my pause.\u201cI was just checking something real quick.\u201d\u201cI heard a notice, too. The drop rate of something and the Coin acquisition is greatly increased, or something like that.\u201d Yeonseo took the initiative to draw the line. \u201cI\u2019m satisfied enough with the good experience I gained from this raid. I won\u2019t be greedy for the Coins. You guys divvy it up amongst yourselves. I learnt a lot from you today, and owe you my life again\u2026\u201dLike usual, the swordless Yeonseo grinned cutely.\u201cAnd I guess this counts as a date.\u201dI had no idea how this was anything close to a date, but in any case, Yeonseo conceded everything to the rest of us.\u201cHyungnim. I came here to help you anyway. I never wanted a reward.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI was silent for a moment.\u2018What\u2019s important is how many Coins come out of the Random Coin Boxes, if we get any.\u2019This hadn\u2019t been in my original plan, but we had managed to come this far. Thanks to this successful raid, I would be much closer to getting \u2018that thing\u2019 I\u2019d been thinking about. As long as Lady Luck gave me her blessing, I could even get \u2018that thing\u2019 right away.\u201cI\u2019ll also do as you tell me to, oppa,\u201d said Sunhwa.It looked like Sunhwa, like the other two, didn\u2019t want much. She had complete trust and faith in me, and simply enjoyed doing something with me. She wasn\u2019t greedy for the Coins.\u2018For now\u2026 let\u2019s get some Coins.\u2019I didn\u2019t want to completely monopolize the rewards. I wasn\u2019t the only one who had worked hard. All of us had gotten this far together.\u2018Of course, I do have priority.\u2019Since the MVP of this Play was me, I definitely had priority. However, there was no need to be greedier than necessary right now. As long as these turtles yielded an amount that could satisfy me, I would give the others the rest.\u2018These guys also need to get rewards to get motivation.\u2019I would probably keep this party together for the time being. Somehow, I became the party leader. From the viewpoint of a party leader, party members being motivated was incredibly important.\u2018It\u2019s only natural you\u2019d have no enthusiasm if you worked to the bone and even worked overtime only to get miniscule rewards.\u2019Stick and carrot. A leader had to manage the party by utilizing both elements in appropriate measure.\u201cWe\u2019ll be getting Coins starting now.\u201dI made the baseline crystal clear, a concrete and clearly tangible base.\u201cI\u2019ll take up to 70k Coins.\u201dTheir eyes grew wide. That was only natural.\u00a070k Coins.\u00a0When I got big sponsorships from Guardians before, that only added up to 8k Coins. Even killing the level 25 lycanthrope yielded a scant 30 Coins. So for us, 70k Coins was a fortune we could hardly even fathom.Yeonseo laughed in amusement. There was no malice in her laugh. Her eyes curved into crescents.\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll happily accept.\u201dHer laugh seemed to say \u201870k Coins, there\u2019s no way there\u2019ll be more than that, anyway\u2019. I still couldn\u2019t understand why I could feel strong \u2018goodwill\u2019 from her. I had no idea what part of my words would make her feel goodwill towards me.In any case, I decided to start the Gold Turtle hunt.\u201cAnyone happen to have a big, blunt weapon?\u201d\u201cHm? Hyungnim, I\u2019ve got a [Large Hammer]!\u201d\u201cGive it to me for a moment.\u201dThe Large Hammer was about the same size as a warhammer. It was indeed a weapon for beginners, but no one used it. It was too heavy, making it nearly impossible to hit monsters.It was also difficult to swing it properly. But if the opponent was as still as a fencepost, like these turtles, it wasn\u2019t a difficult weapon to use.\u2018Alrighty, let\u2019s give it a swing, shall we?\u2019I swung down the Large Hammer.* * *Whumpf\u2013!The sound the weapon made as it traveled through the air was as hefty as its size. Hyukjin heard notices.[Gold Turtle has been killed.][EXP acquired.][241 Coins acquired.]For a mid-10 level monster, it dropped a huge amount of coins.Whumpf\u2013!The hammer landed squarely in the middle of the shell.Crack\u2013!A loud impact struck the eardrums, like steel clashing against steel.Crack\u2013! Crack\u2013! Crack\u2013!Hyukjin continued to swing the \u2018Large Hammer\u2019.[301 Coins acquired.][99 Coins acquired.]Though all the turtles were around the same level, they dropped a varying amount of Coins.[119 Coins acquired.][167 Coins acquired.][222 Coins acquired.]Yeonseo gulped her drool. \u201cMy god\u2026\u201dYoohyun simply stared at Hyukjin, his calf-like eyes dazedly blinking. He heard Yeonseo whisper something next to him.\u201cWhat\u2026 is he?\u201dYoohyun didn\u2019t know, either.\u201cCould\u2026 it be that he\u2019s some\u2026 I dunno, higher-level class that\u2019s specialized in handling blunt weapons?\u201dYoohyun had never thought there would be anyone who could use the \u2018Large Hammer\u2019 so well. When it came to strength, Yoohyun thought he wouldn\u2019t lose to anyone, but somehow, he got the feeling he would lose to Hyukjin in an armwrestling match. How in the world could such a slender body produce such strength? The realization that he had become a Player swept through Yoohyun again.\u201cI think hyungnim\u2019s Strength stat is super high.\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s also faster than me?\u201d\u201cThen his Agility must also be higher than yours.\u201d\u201cHow can his Strength be higher than yours and his Agility higher than mine? Even considering he\u2019s a higher level than us\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYoohyun wasn\u2019t sure.Sunhwa, who had been listening quietly from the side, gave them the correct answer.\u201cUnnie, mister. Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\u201dTN: Unnie is a familiar term for sister, used by a girl to refer to an older girl.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIn the eyes of the natural-born tank Kim Sunhwa, Hyukjin\u2019s movements didn\u2019t boil down to just ordinary \u2018swinging\u2019.\u201cIf stats could represent technique, they would\u2019ve probably been extremely high.\u201dYeonseo agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re right. He\u2019s not just wildly swinging the hammer. He\u2019s precisely aiming for the center of the shell and making the impact register fully right now.\u201dEven for the great Kim Hyukjin, he wasn\u2019t able to kill the Gold Turtles in one hit. He had to attack each one at least four times.\u201cHe\u2019s hitting almost the exact same place at set intervals.\u201dSet intervals, sending set vibrations through the shell. Hyukjin was stacking them up, amplifying each hit. Before she knew it, Yeonseo was thoroughly observing Hyukjin with the same eyes she had when she was holding her sword.She knew what his movements were.\u201cResonance.\u201dResonance, the phenomenon of sharply increased amplitude on a vibrating object. It was an amplification effect that occurred when the frequency of a periodically applied force became close to the intrinsic frequency of the object.Yeonseo continued speaking as if bewitched. \u201cHe\u2019s creating massive shock waves inside the shell in order to maximize the destructive power.\u201dIt didn\u2019t look like he was using a skill, nor did it look like this was a trained movement.\u2018He\u2019s doing that\u2026 by instinct alone?\u2019* * *While I was engrossed in hunting the Gold Turtles, I discovered something.\u2018Finally.\u2019[Random Coin Box acquired.]\u2018Please, let it be seven of them.\u2019There was a higher chance to get them. As long as seven of them dropped, it was enough. As long as I gathered seven, I could trigger a new hidden piece.[Random Coin Box acquired.][Random Coin Box acquired.]Around two hours passed, after which I had a total of six boxes. There was only one Gold Turtle left. Just one more box, and I would have seven.\u2018Please!\u2019[Gold Turtle has been killed.][Random Coin Box acquired.]\u2018Seven\u2026! Got \u2018em.\u2019My whole body was drenched in sweat.\u2018Finally\u2026\u2019I was satisfied. Seven Random Coin Boxes had dropped. That meant I had reached my first goal. I paused to take some deep breaths to regulate my ragged breathing and also used a Constitution potion. I took one of the towels in my Inventory out to wipe my sweat. It was almost like I\u2019d taken a shower in sweat.\u201cIs\u2026 your body made of steel or something?\u201d Yeonseo asked. \u201cHow can you swing that big thing for\u00a0two hours\u00a0straight?\u201d\u201cI drank a lot of Constitution potions.\u201d\u201cEven so. Are you really human, dude?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that I wasn\u2019t exhausted. After swinging a hammer for two hours, my waist and shoulders felt like they were about to break.\u2018But it\u2019s alright.\u2019This feeling of having worked hard, of drawing out my future and reaping rewards in the process, it wasn\u2019t a bad feeling. Every muscle on my body was screaming in exhaustion, but that fatigue wasn\u2019t unpleasant to me.\u2018Seven Random Coin Boxes.\u2019On top of that, I had acquired a whopping 20k Coins already. I was already \u2153 of the way to my goal of 70k Coins. Things were going far more smoothly than expected.\u201cHyungnim. Should we destroy the Crystal and leave the gate?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThere was still something to do. We had to crack open the Random Boxes. I clicked the \u2018Random Coin Boxes\u2019 in my Inventory.\u2018Will 50k Coins come out of the Random Coin Boxes?\u2019I didn\u2019t know. I had to crack them open to find out. They were random, after all.The first Random Coin Box\u2014[Open the Random Coin Box?][6,400 Coins acquired.]The second\u2014[Open the Random Coin Box?][1,400 Coins acquired.]1,400 Coins. With two boxes, I got 7,800 Coins. That added up roughly to 30k Coins, leaving 40k Coins to the goal.\u2018Five Random Coin Boxes left.\u2019Would 40k Coins come out of the boxes? It would have to be an average of 8,000 Coins per box. I had the feeling fewer Coins were coming out than expected.\u2018Is my luck kinda bad?\u2019The third Random Coin Box\u2014[70 Coins acquired.]I scowled. 70 Coins? It was the worst of the worst. With this, I became a little more certain of it. I didn\u2019t have very good luck.The fourth Random Coin Box was decent, at least.[9,000 Coins acquired.]In a stroke of shit luck, the fifth was [700 Coins acquired], and the sixth was [2,000 Coins acquired].As a result, I had about 40k Coins. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t look like I\u2019d be able to scrape together a surplus I could share with the others. I doubted that 30k Coins would come out of one box.\u2018But it\u2019s okay.\u2019This was the seventh. When I opened the seventh Random Coin Box, a new notice would definitely be announced, as long as it was the same as the past I remembered.[Open the Random Coin Box?]\u2018Please.\u2019Please be the same as the past, please.I finally heard the notice I had been waiting for.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was currently the early stage of the Tutorial, so ten years before the year I had lived in. Before my regression, hidden pieces were thought of as commonplace.Things considered so very natural ten years later were so very new right now, ten years prior. This \u2018Challenge to the Jackpot\u2019 was something everyone in the future knew about.The notices continued.[You are the \u2018first\u2019 to have fulfilled the conditions for \u2018Challenge to the Jackpot\u2019.][There is a title that can be connected to the first discovery of the Hidden Piece \u2018Challenge to the Jackpot\u2019.]When I discovered \u2018Gold Turtle\u2019s Collective Spirit\u2019 earlier, I didn\u2019t connect my title because there hadn\u2019t been much merit in doing so.\u2018But this time?\u2019[The title that can be connected is \u2018First Pioneer\u2019.]I pulled up the detailed explanation.If a Player with the [First Pioneer] title is the first to discover a [Hidden Piece], it is possible to trigger a linked scenario.

While I was standing there, thinking, the Guardians sent notices, apparently feeling antsy.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 observes your actions.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is curious.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 focuses on you.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 feels impatient.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 strikes his chest.]Of course they were curious as to why I didn\u2019t crack open the seventh box right away.\u201cSenia, share the reward I got.\u201dI publicized my reward to the Guardians. Should I change the Random Coin Box to a Double Coin Box, or not? I was showing my actions to the Guardians right now, showing them exactly what I would do.\u201cGuys. I\u2019m in a place right now where I can get a Double Coin Box.\u201dBlinking, Yeonseo asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that? Gonna give it to me?\u201dShe almost looked like a squirrel wanting an acorn. I knew she was just joking, so I ignored the second part of her words with ease.\u201cIt\u2019s a box that doubles the number of Coins you have when you get it.\u201d\u201cAha. Then can\u2019t you wait to get it when you have more Coins? It would be more profitable to get that when you have more money, right?\u201dAs expected of Yeonseo\u2014she hit the bullseye. I was thankful she was so smart. Lady of the Scales, are you listening?\u201cYeah. That\u2019s true in theory. But it doesn\u2019t work with Coins gained through trades.\u201dIn other words, there was no point in getting all their Coins and then obtaining the Double Coin Box.\u201cAnd also, this is a place where all of us worked hard together and cleared together, right? We\u2019re all party members who\u2019ve fought with our backs to each other.\u201d\u201cH-Huh? I\u2026 guess?\u201dYeonseo glanced at me doubtfully.State: Uneasy / Doubt / AnxiousIf I had to hazard a guess, she was probably thinking along the lines of \u2018What\u2019s up with him all of a sudden? Did he eat something strange?\u2019 I fully understood her feelings. Even I felt awkward saying such words.\u201cIt\u2019s my belief that there should be a fair distribution of rewards here. That\u2019s what\u2019s right.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dUnable to adapt to my sudden change of tune, Yeonseo simply stared, almost like a fearful squirrel.\u201cSo I\u2019m gonna get the box now. If I do that, I can give you guys at least 3,000 Coins each.\u201dI would easily reach my goal of 70k Coins, leaving me a surplus of about 3,000 Coins to give to the others.\u2018It\u2019s a lot of money for beginners.\u2019It was an amount that could buy fairly good items in the beginner grade, as well as potions, which could be called a Player\u2019s second life. Considering that ordinary Guardians gave sponsorships of 10 Coins or 300 Coins at most, 3,000 was no paltry sum.[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is impressed by your character.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 detests you.]Senia appeared. \u201cFirst Pioneer can only be connected to hidden pieces three times. Will you still use it?\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s what\u2019s fair.\u201dActually, I wasn\u2019t doing this to be fair, but because I needed 70k Coins right now.\u2018What I need right now is 70k Coins.\u2019These 70k Coins would take me to a far higher place, at least according to the strategy in my memory.\u2018It\u2019s originally a strategy that can only be done by silver spoons.\u2019Who in their right mind would invest 70k Coins in a beginner? This strategy was only possible for truly high-level Players or children from chaebol families. It wasn\u2019t something ordinary working class people could even dream of.\u2018Plus\u2026 there\u2019ll be the gate clear reward, as well as the quest clear reward.\u2019And not only that, but as long as things went well, there was a possibility that the \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 would give me a generous sponsorship. The picture was drawn in its entirety.[Will you connect the title effect of \u2018First Pioneer\u2019 with the Hidden Piece \u2018Challenge to the Jackpot\u2019?]This time, I chose \u2018YES\u2019.[The connection between the title effect and Hidden Piece has been completed.][Random Coin Box has been switched to Double Coin Box.]I immediately opened the Double Coin Box.[Current held Coins: 43,219 Coins][You have opened a Double Coin Box.][43,219 Coins acquired.]My Coins were instantly doubled, meaning I currently had 86,438 Coins.\u201cI\u2019ll distribute 3,000 Coins each to you guys.

Compared to the Lady of the Scales\u2019 fame, it was indeed too feeble a reward, though it was better than nothing.\u201cHyungnim. Should I destroy this thing now?\u201dYoohyun had a purple crystal, the Clear Crystal of the Turtle Nest, in his meaty, pot lid-sized hand. I nodded. He let go of the crystal, and it floated in midair.\u201cUryah!\u201dHe punched out, and after a few attacks, the crystal shattered.[The Gate \u2018Turtle Nest\u2019 has been cleared.][Distributing Gate Clear rewards.][All Players are given +500 Coins.][All Players are given \u2018Beginner Tower Return Scroll\u2019.]I was surprised to see a Beginner Tower Return Scroll in the rewards. It was an item that was usually given after clearing a gate.\u201cWe\u2019re gonna use the Beginner Tower Return Scroll. Use it right away without saving it.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a very high difficulty gate. We only took the roundabout way of getting Coins, but we could have cleared it as soon as we found the crystal. The gate\u2019s overall difficulty was low, so the rewards were also not very high. In any case, I never expected much from the gate clear rewards to begin with.\u2018If there\u2019s a Beginner Tower Return Scroll, that means\u2026\u2019It essentially meant that the Beginner Tower had formed while we were in the Japanese gate.The notices continued.[The quest \u2018Turtle Nest\u2019 has been cleared.]That was the quest Senia had issued us. She approached us, then spoke while looking at me. \u201cI will now deliver the rewards for clearing the Turtle Nest.\u201dI didn\u2019t expect much.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you waiting for? We have to use the Return Scroll before we get kicked out, so spit it out.\u201dWhen we left, we would probably be swarmed by police or reporters. I wanted to avoid such a tiresome thing, if possible. It would be much more convenient to go straight to the Beginner Tower.[Distributing rewards for clearing the quest \u2018Turtle Nest\u2019.]Senia handed me a pouch.\u201cHm?\u201dBy all appearances, it looked like a pouch filled with Coins.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cPlease take a look.\u201dI took the pouch from her and got Coins.[7,000 Coins acquired.]The heck was this?\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA moment of silence fell between Senia and me. The gate clear reward was a paltry 500 Coins, but the reward for a quest issued by an Intermediate Administrator was 7,000 Coins?\u2018This isn\u2019t\u2026I had a hunch. About the Turtle Nest clear quest.\u2018A quest issued by an Intermediate Administrator.\u2019It was obvious by looking at the attitude of this easily handled newbie Streamer. This was a quest she had been asked to issue as a proxy, and similarly, these rewards were given by someone else. And that someone did not reveal their identity.\u2018Who is it, then?\u2019I had no idea. Was there ever a Guardian who would give 7,000 Coins for a beginner gate?\u2018Could it be the Demon King\u2019s Guardian?\u2019Only someone of his level would do such a thing.\u2018Or\u2026 they\u2019d have to be someone on the level of the Herdsman of Las Vegas.\u2019But the \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 had to be watching the US server right now, so it couldn\u2019t be him.\u2018Who could it be?\u2019I could only guess. If it was the Lady of the Scales, she would have personally issued the quest with her name on it. Something was strange about this. I was happy, but it was strange. There was no further information I could glean about the current situation.\u2018Who could it have possibly been?\u2019I pulled my thoughts away from the big question with effort. \u201cAll of you, use the return scroll we got as a reward. At least if you want to avoid something troublesome.\u201d* * *[You have used a \u2018Beginner Tower Return Scroll\u2019.]I was struck with a moment of dizziness, and it felt like I was getting sucked somewhere. When I recovered my senses, I was suddenly standing somewhere completely different.[You have arrived at the Korean Beginner Tower \u2013 D-Tower.]I looked around.\u2018So the Beginner Tower really opened.\u2019I could see people with their names written above their heads. They weren\u2019t actual people, but NPCs. They only existed in special places and were like artificial intelligences. You could think of them as NPCs in a game.\u2018Aria of the Potion Store. Charles of the Weapon Store.\u2019They were all familiar names. The NPCs managed stores that sold better quality items than the weapons you could get from the System shop. If you had enough intimacy with the NPCs, they sometimes sold hidden items as well.\u2018We\u2019ve really arrived.\u2019D-Tower. This place, the former Tutorial Dungeon, was now the \u2018Beginner Tower\u2019. Looking around with wide eyes, Yeonseo grabbed my sleeve and shook it.\u201cMy god, is this real life?

The original shops had all disappeared, as well as the ATM Sunhwa and I had used to block the Goblin Soldier\u2019s spear. The whole floor had been completely transformed.Yeonseo\u2019s mouth was wide open.\u201cHoly cow\u2026\u201dThis was a world where monsters appeared, over 140,000 people died, and gates and dungeons existed, so what was all this fuss about return scrolls about?\u201cAmazing. So frickin\u2019 amazing. Amaaaaaazing!\u201dHer excited appearance was a little cute, but it was a bit irritating that she was grabbing my sleeve while jumping around. I shook her off.\u201cThat\u2019s rude, treating me like I\u2019m dust or something,\u201d Yeonseo muttered, pursing her lips.\u201cThanks for your hard work. You guys go do what you have to do now. In a few days, I\u2019ll contact you again, so Yoohyun and Yeonseo, you go clear just 25 rounds of the Seoul Station Dungeon.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, hyungnim!\u201d\u201cGot it. We just have to do 25 rounds, right?\u201dIn the meantime, Players who had recognized Yoohyun started to come this way.\u201cHuh? Isn\u2019t that So Yoohyun?\u201d\u201cReally? The Tutorial Ender?\u201dEveryone\u2019s interest in our sudden appearance quickly focused on Yoohyun. I was glad about it\u2014he could take all the interest.I was pretty impatient right now. The Beginner Tower had formed, and I had my advancement and Guardian Selection in front of me.\u2018Before that\u2026\u2019I walked forward to carry out the strategy that only chaebols could do.\u201cOppa. What should I do?\u201d\u201cYou go home and rest. I\u2019ll be back at night.\u201d\u201cWhat are you gonna do, oppa? Can\u2019t I come with you? I\u2019m good at tanking, right?\u201dJust then, I recalled her summary.Summary: Slight Brother ComplexThe \u2018brother\u2019 in there couldn\u2019t be referring to me, right?\u201cGo home.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get ice cream on the way home.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dSunhwa smiled brightly, like she had never been pouting. The happiness I could feel from her through Eye of Perception told me she really loved ice cream.After a few steps, I saw the escalator that, unlike before, now had zero cooldown and required a usage fee.[Escalator Going to the 2nd Floor]The escalator going to the 2nd floor of the Beginner Tower. 15 people can teleport at the same time. Currently, there is nothing on the 2nd floor.Cooldown: \u2013Required Coins: 100 CoinsI got on the escalator. Senia, who hadn\u2019t closed her channel yet, followed me. She probably thought my actions right now were a waste of money.\u201cYou think my actions are a waste of money, right?\u201d\u201cYes. There is currently nothing on the 2nd floor.\u201dYour attention, please, Guardians. Allow me to show you what I\u2019m going to do here.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: Speak, Pygmy (2)I knew as well as anyone that there was nothing on the 2nd floor.\u2018But the fact the 2nd floor has been opened\u2026\u2019Meant that someone had opened the 2nd floor. I knew who the first person to open the 2nd floor was. The Demon King\u2014the Player Seo Joohwan had served, whose identity had still not been discovered after ten years. No one knew if he was even Korean, only that he started Playing in Korea and later became the leader of the \u2018Demon King Army\u2019, aka \u2018Nightmare\u2019.\u2018Not much is known about the Demon King.\u2019It was known that he had the capability to easily face the 8 Heroes all on his own, and he was always involved, in one way or another, in wars, gate breaks, and big incidents like large-scale massacres.\u2018One thing that\u00a0is\u00a0known\u2026 is that he was the very first person to open the 2nd floor of the Beginner Tower.\u2019The bonus he received from doing so was also public knowledge.\u2018The first three Players to enter are given a bonus.\u2019It could be that the Demon King was still somewhere on the 2nd floor. When that possibility occurred to me, my heart began to thump. What did the current Demon King look like? I already considered Yoohyun and Yeonseo as genius enough, but the supreme commander of the Demon King Army far outstripped them. Could it be that he really was on the 2nd floor?\u2018Could it be\u2026 that I\u2019m stronger than the current Demon King?\u2019Suddenly, Eye of Perception picked up on something, a feeling different from usual. It felt like something heavy was going over my eyelids.[A powerful presence has been detected.][Eye of Perception has been temporarily disabled.]\u2018My eyes\u2026 hurt.\u2019I closed my eyes. Or rather, my eyes closed involuntarily.\u2018I feel like I saw someone just now.\u2019What I remembered was only a black afterimage, the mere feeling that a black fog appeared before my eyes before disappearing. If not for Eye of Perception being \u2018disabled\u2019, I would have thought that I had only imagined it. But I could tell.\u2018I came face to face with someone just now.\u2019It was just my hunch, but I had the feeling that \u2018someone\u2019 might be the Demon King. I didn\u2019t know who the Demon King was, but what I did know was that he definitely existed in this world, somewhere. If that pressure I felt just now really was from the Demon King, then\u2026?\u2018If we faced off, what would happen?\u2019I didn\u2019t know yet. While a thousand thoughts went through my head, the status abnormality faded.[Eye of Perception is no longer disabled.]\u2018Will I ever end up confronting the Demon King?\u2019That didn\u2019t have to happen. Even if we never met, I could live perfectly well.\u2018Let\u2019s think about it later.\u2019I decided to focus on what I could do right now.[Escalator Going to the 2nd Floor]I went up to the 2nd floor with the escalator.* * *[You have entered the Beginner Tower 2nd Floor.]The 2nd floor of the D-Tower, which was now the Beginner Tower, was once the place where I fought the magic troll. But now, there was nothing. It was just a dark and empty lot. Even though it wasn\u2019t underground, the air was humid and damp. The whole place gave off the impression of an empty underground parking lot.\u2018Item Shop.\u2019[Item Shop \u2013 Beginner \u2013 Potions &amp; Return Scrolls]Beginner Constitution Potion 300 CoinsBeginner Mana Potion 300 CoinsBeginner Cure Potion 400 CoinsBeginner Safe Zone Return Scroll 3,000 CoinsBeginner Healing Potion 400 CoinsCurrently, I was on the \u2018Potions &amp; Return Scrolls\u2019 tab. That wasn\u2019t important. The important thing was that right now, I was on the 2nd floor of the Beginner Tower.\u201cI wish to open the Hidden Item Shop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The Streamer Senia stared blankly at me. \u201cThe\u2026 Hidden Item Shop?\u201dShe was staring at me with no expression, but the tips of her wings were trembling. Though she appeared expressionless on the outside, it seemed she was extremely flustered on the inside. My Eye of Perception couldn\u2019t read Senia\u2019s state yet, but despite that, it was as clear as day to me.\u201cLooks like you\u2019re very taken aback.\u201dThat my low-proficiency Eye of Perception could read her shock indicated the degree of her emotional upheaval, the degree to which her emotions were showing.\u201cLook carefully through the manual.\u201dSuch cases, where Players shared tips and strategies amongst each other and knew something the Intermediate Administrator in charge of them didn\u2019t, happened occasionally. I understood. Senia was a beginner. It was because she was a beginner that it was easy for me to manipulate her. But as easy to manipulate she might be, she also had disadvantages like this.\u201c\u2026\u201dSeveral Guardians seemed to find the time it took for her to read the manual boring.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is observing.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is waiting.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 is impatient.]I was idly wondering when that courage-lover would leave this channel when Senia opened her mouth again, five minutes later.\u201cA Hidden Item Shop exists.\u201dYes, and it could only be accessed here. It required 50k Coins to open, an impossible hurdle for a real beginner. It was out of the question for a beginner to have 50k Coins.\u201cIt requires\u2026 50k Coins.\u201d\u201cThose 50k Coins, I\u2019ll give them.\u201d[You have requested the opening of the Hidden Item Shop.][Opening the Hidden Item Shop requires 50k Coins.][Will you open the Hidden Item Shop?][The Hidden Item Shop can be accessed for 60 seconds.][All items in the Hidden Item Shop are limited to 1 in stock.]Before you could even peruse the items, it required 50k Coins simply to open the shop for a pathetic 60 seconds. As long as you didn\u2019t have bricks for brains or had a crazy amount of money rotting in the bank, not going ahead with such a cost was the right call. In addition, there was only one of each item. Even if the item I wanted was there, it was over if someone had already purchased it.[Opening the Hidden Item Shop.][The Hidden Item Shop has been opened.]In addition to this, the bonus for the first three was applied.[You have succeeded in being the second to open the Hidden Item Shop.][You are given an opening bonus.][The opening bonus \u2018Bargain Sale\u2019 is taking effect.]The Bargain Sale took effect, halving the prices of the items.[Hidden Item Shop \u2013 Beginner \u2013 Assist Scrolls]Low Advancement Assist Scroll 14,000 Coins \u2192 7,000 CoinsIntermediate Advancement Assist Scroll 26,000 Coins \u2192 13,000 CoinsHigh Advancement Assist Scroll 40,000 Coins \u2192 20,000 CoinsThe shop was beginner grade, and within the Assist Scroll tab, there were only three items that could be purchased.

Thanks to reaping an unexpectedly large harvest from the \u2018Turtle Nest\u2019, I still had 13,000 Coins left, even after purchasing the \u2018High Advancement Assist Scroll\u2019.\u2018I have more left over than expected.\u2019I felt like I\u2019d profited greatly somehow, seeing as I had 13k Coins left over when I had expected 0.There was no time to look through the other tabs. Sixty seconds had passed in a flash.[High Advancement Assist Scroll]A scroll enchanted with magic that assists in advancement. Has a high chance to increase the grade of the \u2018class\u2019 the Player advances to.Used: 0/1The High Advancement Assist Scroll is an item purchased from the Hidden Item Shop.Cannot be traded or transferred.After confirming the item, I shared all of the information to my Intermediate Administrator, Senia, telling everyone that I had just purchased a \u2018High Advancement Assist Scroll\u2019. In other words, I was considering \u2018advancement\u2019.\u201cMy level is currently 26. As you know, it\u2019s about time for me to start considering my advancement, right?\u201dI said last time that I would advance at level 30.\u2018That\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to Play with a slightly more advantageous method.\u2019There was, of course, a method behind the madness. When I reached level 30, it would be time to choose the Guardian I would contract with. Through this contract, a close relationship would be established between me and the Guardian, and I would be able to receive a great deal of support from this Guardian.\u201cThough you said you would be waiting last time\u2026 What is your reasoning for waiting? That Players advance at level 25 is a universal process. Just what kind of belief is behind your actions?\u201dI grinned on purpose, knowing that many Guardians had their eyes on me.\u201cA feeling? Or maybe a dream?\u201dIf Players advanced through their Guardians, they could get a class of at least rare grade.\u2018For them, hypotheticals aren\u2019t important, anyway.\u2019To the Guardians, things like how I knew all of this, or whether it really was a feeling or a dream, weren\u2019t very important to them. What was important was how fun and enjoyable a Play I could show them could be.\u00a0That\u00a0was what mattered to them.\u2018That\u2019s why\u2014\u2019The Guardians would overlook my current actions. But just then, I heard a notice.* * *[The Intermediate Administrator Neptune\u2019s \u2018Bug Investigation Request\u2019 has been received.]In this dark place where only Senia and I were standing, someone else appeared.\u2018The Intermediate Administrator Neptune.\u2019He was a pygmy with skin somewhere between green and emerald. The one-eyed Streamer was So Yoohyun\u2019s Intermediate Administrator.\u201cIt really is too strange. Don\u2019t you think so too, great Guardians? This Player, something\u2019s fishy about him for sure. Even for a Precognitive Dream user, this is simply too much. There\u2019s a high chance of a System bug or error. That\u2019s why I have submitted an Investigation Request. Oi. Is your name Kim Hyukjin?\u201d Staring at me, Neptune continued talking with an overbearing attitude. \u201cCome closer.\u201dA feeling similar to what I felt in front of the escalator earlier washed over me.[Eye of Perception is temporarily disabled.][Intermediate Administrator Neptune\u2019s coercion is activating.][The \u2018Forced Submission\u2019 power of the Intermediate Administrator Neptune is taking effect.]I was forced to walk to Neptune, regardless of my will.Thud.And then, I knelt. Like the name \u2018Forced Submission\u2019 implied, it was a humiliating power.\u2018Senia, you dunce. Say something, goddammit.\u2019Senia wasn\u2019t able to say anything to Neptune. As one would expect from a real beginner Streamer, she couldn\u2019t handle Neptune\u2019s unexpected actions.\u2018That\u2019s why she\u2019ll be eliminated.\u2019She was being suppressed by Neptune\u2019s aura. He likely held a far higher rank than her in the Streamer world.\u2018You won\u2019t survive like this, Senia.\u2019I decided to speak for her.\u201cFeel free to scan me.\u201dI didn\u2019t do anything that was forbidden by the System. To begin with, there was no way a Player barely in their mid-level 20s could use the \u2018bugs\u2019 that would appear only five years from now. Neptune had to know this fact very well. This was what was commonly called \u2018stirring the pot\u2019, or \u2018aggroing\u2019.\u2018Probably to promote his channel.\u2019Since he couldn\u2019t independently stream me, he was slandering with me, the center of attention for the Guardians right now, as his target. You could think of it as something like marketing buzz.\u2018And the current me is an easy opponent.\u2019I was way weaker than him. That was an undeniable fact.\u201cBut.\u201dIf marketing buzz was what he wanted, and he was trying to use me for his own gain, then he should have looked a little more into the person he was trying to use.\u201cWhat is your reasoning for accusing me of using a bug? How do you plan on paying the price for threatening and treating a completely innocent Player like a criminal?\u201dI might be kneeling under the effects of Neptune\u2019s power, but I was confident I could overcome this situation \u2018better\u2019 than anyone else. There was no need to cower. I already knew about Neptune, as well as why he was doing this.On top of that, I even knew Neptune\u2019s weakness.I said one more thing.\u201cSpeak, pygmy.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Shot Table Dungeon\u201cPygmy.\u201dThe moment I uttered that word, I coughed violently, feeling intense pain. It was like someone had rammed into my solar plexus.\u2018Gugh!\u2019It was difficult to breathe. Kneeling on the ground, I could do nothing else but clutch my stomach.\u2018That\u2019s right. Get worked up.\u2019Neptune was definitely a Streamer of a race called the \u2018pygmies\u2019. Everyone acknowledged that. Even the Guardians watching right now used that term. But Neptune really disliked the \u2018pygmy\u2019 appellation.\u2018Whether you dislike it or not, I\u2019m not the one who attacked you first.\u2019Neptune came closer.\u201cI dare you to keep mouthing off, you lowly little shit.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cGo on, bark. I\u2019ll end your miserable life for you.\u201dIt was difficult to talk. A heavy pressure was crushing me. Fear that I might even die at this rate began to swell within me.\u2018No, he can\u2019t kill me.\u2019A tremendous amount of bloodlust needled my skin. If Eye of Perception hadn\u2019t been temporarily disabled, that bloodlust might have given me vivid images of my head being cut off. Just like the last time I was here on the 2nd floor of D-Tower, when I was getting attacked by the Magic Troll.\u201cI said, bark.\u201dI raised my head with difficulty. He couldn\u2019t kill me anyway. Right now, many Guardians were focusing on me, and I had even received sponsorships from many of them. If he were to kill me here, he would become the enemy of the Guardians who had sponsored me.\u2018You can\u2019t kill me.\u2019I was the one in the right.\u201cI only talked down to you because you did so to me first. I only put up an appropriate resistance because you threatened me with a wrongful method first. I only called you pygmy because your race is pygmy. Just what did I do to suffer this kind of treatment?\u201dIf you were ignorant, you couldn\u2019t fight back. If you knew nothing, you could only become a victim. But I knew. I knew that my words were in line with the \u2018Commandments\u2019 in this System. My actions weren\u2019t just \u2018self-defense\u2019, but straight-out \u2018justified\u2019.\u201cAt this point in time, I shouldn\u2019t be a criminal yet. Is it right for the strong to persecute the weak without justified reason? To persecute a Player doing a justified Play?\u201d[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 deeply sympathizes with your words.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 applies the special power \u2018Innocent Until Proven Guilty\u2019.]The pressure crushing me disappeared, and I was able to breathe again.[Due to \u2018Innocent Until Proven Guilty\u2019, the effects of \u2018Forced Submission\u2019 are removed.]That was only natural\u2014a Guardian\u2019s power was far higher in authority than a Streamer\u2019s.[The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 nods.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 has contempt for cowards.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 applies the special power \u2018Strong to the Strong, Weak to the Weak\u2019.]Be strong to the strong, and weak to the weak.

Apparently, the \u2018Strong to the Strong, Weak to the Weak\u2019 power the True Master granted me only worked on Neptune.\u2018Right now, I feel like I wouldn\u2019t lose in a 1 on 1 against Neptune, but\u2026\u2019A Player directly fighting a Streamer wasn\u2019t very desirable. The Guardians didn\u2019t really welcome that, unless they were courage-lovers like the Courageous Lion King.\u201cIt seems the Guardians think the same as me.\u201dRight on cue, a notice came in.[System Scan Result: No bug values have been discovered.][System Scan Result: No illegitimate methods have been used.]I came this far using my knowledge of the future and by putting my life on the line.

If I hadn\u2019t done anything, I would have become a literal punching bag.\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s cowardly?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNeptune bit his lips. From the way he tightly clenched his fists, it seemed he was very enraged. He still didn\u2019t want to acknowledge his fault, but Guardians stronger than him were watching, so he wasn\u2019t able to say anything.\u2018I didn\u2019t lose in a battle of wills.\u2019This was actually an unexpected win, seeing as I could direct the situation to my benefit.\u201cApologize.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause you were in the wrong.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re also\u2026!\u201dHe was about to say something like \u201cyou\u2019re also in the wrong\u201d, but stopped short because he had no rationale for such an accusation.I saw him wracking his brains, but I didn\u2019t give him the tiniest bit of ammunition to work with. I may have called him \u2018pygmy\u2019 in order to provoke him, but that wasn\u2019t actually a mistake. It wasn\u2019t derogatory\u2014I just called him pygmy because he was from the pygmy race. Just like how calling a human a human wasn\u2019t an expletive, this was the same logic.\u201c\u2026rry.\u201dI heard him say something very quietly.

Mom said she already ate, so eat, or don\u2019t, I don\u2019t care.\u201dFrom her attitude, it was like she was trying to say \u2018Who cares if you eat or not, I made it for Sunhwa and me anyway\u2019, but the four sets of utensils on the table were very telling.\u2018Ah. Is that why there was \u2018expectant\u2019 in her status window?\u2019I washed my hands and sat down at the table.\u201cThanks for the food, noona.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dState: Expectant / Restless / AnxiousIt looked like I\u2019d have to make a big ado about this stew being super delicious.Come to think of it, before, my sister hardly ever cooked.

Why\u2019re you cooking and all?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do it for you. It\u2019s just that the kitchen is so big, so I just gave it a try. It\u2019s a waste to let that kitchen rot.\u201dAh, uh-huh.\u00a0Her state was too transparent for that to fly. It was obvious that she was devoting every ounce of her concentration onto my spoon.\u2018It\u2019s not tasty.\u2019It was pretty much her first soybean paste stew ever. Being tasty would be more unusual. However, I lied through my teeth.\u201cIt\u2019s good, noona. Where did you learn to cook, noona? Why\u2019s it so tasty?\u201d\u201cShut up, I know it\u2019s not good.\u201dState: Embarrassed / Happy / Relieved / JoyfulIt was fun to watch her state change by the minute. And this \u2018embarrassed\u2019 part was particularly amusing. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell had I not been looking for it, but her ears were ever so slightly red. Her expression was a block of ice, but her ears were red.\u2018I should feign ignorance.\u2019The quick-witted Sunhwa also professed the stew\u2019s deliciousness as she chattered, and when our meal was almost over, Mom came home. She had a few pieces of bread in her hand, and I was suddenly struck with the feeling that today\u2019s meal was extremely joyful.\u201cAhyoung made a stew? Goodness!\u201dMom was surprised, too.\u201cJust \u2018cause. The kitchen\u2019s too pretty, so I just gave it a try.\u201dMom slapped my sister\u2019s butt, saying, \u2018Well done! Our Ahyoung\u2019s ready to get married now\u2019. I sat at the table and savored this feeling of leisure. My sister was here, and so was Mom. It wasn\u2019t very tasty, but we had this warm soybean paste stew, too. There was bread and milk in Mom\u2019s hand, and now, Sunhwa was here as well.\u2018They\u2019re all very small pleasures, but\u2026 it feels great.\u2019Would it be too much of an exaggeration to call this happiness?\u2018I have to protect it.\u2019Be it this happiness, or this leisure, or these small pleasures. No matter what it was, I would protect this way of life, and achieve greater success while doing so. Because now, I could do the things I hadn\u2019t been able to do in the past and had the ability to draw out my own future.I went to my room and reviewed my plans again and again, something I\u2019d done every day since returning to the past. To prevent any possibility of information leak, the notebook I\u2019d regressed with was safely stored in my Inventory.\u2018Next\u2026\u2019The next step could be summed up as two plans.\u2018This is better, but\u2026\u2019Gates were appearing all over the world, along with dungeons of an even higher difficulty. At the same time, \u2018breaks\u2019 were also occurring, and people were slowly getting used to such phenomena.\u2018Let\u2019s think about it a little more.\u2019I had to extract the greatest efficiency from the least amount of time. I went onto the Internet and pulled up the newly started \u2018Real Player\u2019 forum. This place, the beginnings of the future full-fledged \u2018Real Player\u2019 website, was currently a gathering place for Players, as well as a place for exchanging information.I could even see quite a few threads like \u2018LF Raid Party Members\u2019 here.\u2018Even though\u2026 there\u2019s no structure or rules yet.\u2019Even so, mankind was slowly adjusting to this world.\u2018Will I find what I\u2019m looking for?\u2019After around 10 minutes, I found a certain post. The title was very closely related to one of my two plans.\u2018Could this be\u2026?\u2019I looked at the poster\u2019s name. If my prediction was correct, then the poster was definitely someone I knew.[Poster: JayangdongFireMaster]\u2018As I thought.\u2019JayangdongFireMaster was the nickname of Choi Sung-gu. Even though his nickname was a little silly, his later moniker wasn\u2019t silly in the least. His moniker was Flame Lord.\u2018Found you, Choi Sung-gu.\u2019I clicked on the post.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Shot Table Dungeon (2)The title was ordinary.\u2013LF players to challenge the Shot Table dungeon with.In these times, with the world of Players being created day by day, posts seeking party members weren\u2019t all that unusual. I checked the poster again.[Poster: JayangdongFireMaster]The Flame Lord Choi Sung-gu had finally made his appearance. I read the post\u2019s contents.\u2013LF players to challenge the Shot Table dungeon with. The intermediate administrator recommended going in with at least 3 players. Just to be perfectly clear, this is a dungeon, not a gate. Everyone knows that dungeons are the higher forms of gates, right? I am recruiting people to clear the dungeon with. Only people level 20 and up are welcome. Things like items and coins will be shared evenly. I am a magician of the fire attribute, and I\u2019d like to work with a tank who can protect me. We can discuss the details in person. Oh, right. You can only go inside the dungeon if you make a party with me.It was a post written however the author wanted, without any structure or rules. It wasn\u2019t even that eye-catching.\u2018Normally, you don\u2019t publicize the dungeon\u2019s name or location.\u2019Currently, Players were intimidated by the big word that was \u2018dungeon\u2019 and avoided dungeon clearing, but later, it would be a completely different story. Although dungeons were dangerous places, they were also \u2018treasure troves of new technology\u2019 that could completely turn your life around.\u2018Casualties are happening every day in the Seoul Station Dungeon.\u2019I had already cleared the Seoul Station Dungeon, and as a result, there was no dungeon break. Even so, people continued to die while attempting to clear it.\u2018The Shot Table Dungeon, huh.\u2019It was the very first dungeon the Flame Lord Choi Sung-gu cleared. There wasn\u2019t much information about it.\u2018An event dungeon that disappears after getting cleared.\u2019Unlike the Seoul Station Dungeon, which remained in place even after being cleared, the Shot Table Dungeon was a one-time dungeon that would permanently disappear once it was cleared.I wrote a comment.\u2013I\u2019d like to help with the raid. I\u2019m a level 25 tank.Whether I sent him a DM or wrote a comment, it didn\u2019t matter\u2014he would contact me back. After all, there weren\u2019t many Players trying to recklessly clear dungeons right now.After writing the comment, I headed to the Seoul Station Dungeon with Sunhwa.* * *Before we arrived at the Seoul Station Dungeon, Senia appeared. Her creepily accurate timing made me wonder if she was observing me at all times.\u2018Whatever, I needed to talk to her anyway.\u2019\u201cWhen we go into the dungeon, stand behind me,\u201d I said to her.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin. Are you giving me a command right now?\u201dWhat the heck? Did she get lectured by other Streamers to not get led around the nose by a Player? Why was she being so petulant all of a sudden?\u201cYou couldn\u2019t say anything to Neptune, who was persecuting me in defiance of the Commandments, but you sure have a lot to say to me.\u201dSenia\u2019s wingtips trembled. This was no new revelation, but it occurred to me again that this Streamer was truly easy to handle. If her skill was even 1% of her beauty, she would have probably been a famous Streamer in the past. She even let her emotions get the better of her, making her lose the timing to say something. I seized the initiative to say something first.\u201cIt\u2019s related to Playing. You\u2019ll see that my request isn\u2019t unjustified at the dungeon entrance.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia stood behind me with an expressionless face. The Seoul Station 2nd Exit, which had now become the entrance to a dungeon, was being guarded by two policemen.\u201cIdentification, please.\u201dI didn\u2019t commit a crime and placidly handed over my ID card.\u201cAnd the lady next to you?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s my younger sister. She doesn\u2019t have her ID card because she\u2019s still a minor.\u201d\u201cHm. Are you Players?\u201d\u201cYes. Our levels are in the early 20s.\u201dThe city\u2019s response was still too sloppy. The person who checked my details wasn\u2019t even a Player, but a regular policeman. It was obvious that the policeman was tense.State: Tense / Uneasy / Restless / FearfulThere was one reason why this person was so tense. It was because Senia was standing behind me. Even though my dedicated Streamer, Senia, didn\u2019t do awful things like putting holes in people\u2019s heads, slicing open their necks, or cutting them into two, to this policeman, she was definitely a terrifying existence.\u2018Guns don\u2019t work on them, they appear freely, unconstrained by the laws of time and space, and they are strange, otherworldly beings with the power to cut a person in half with one wave of their hand.\u2019That was the way the policeman saw \u2018Intermediate Administrators\u2019. That\u2019s why the policeman didn\u2019t give us much trouble. One misstep, and his head could go flying.\u201cPlease enter.\u201d[This dungeon has already been cleared.][Will you enter the Seoul Station Dungeon?]Of course. However, I wanted to clear it as a separate instance. I turned to Senia.\u201cRequesting an Independent Play. That\u2019s possible, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d After a moment of speechlessness, Senia finally opened her mouth. \u201c\u2026It\u2019s possible, but\u2026\u201dI saw bite her lips ever so slightly.\u2018You must be curious, too.\u2019She must be very curious as to how I knew this kind of information, how a Player who had cleared the Seoul Station just once could possibly know about \u2018Independent Play\u2019.\u2018The more curiosity and interest there is towards me, the better.\u2019[It is possible to request an \u2018Independent Play\u2019 of an already cleared dungeon.][Would you like to submit an \u2018Independent Play Request\u2019?][Your \u2018Independent Play Request\u2019 has been accepted.]An Independent Play was exactly as it sounded\u2014Players would clear the dungeon with only the group they entered with, in a separate instance from the Players who had already gone inside. Only the space itself was different. The contents were the same.[Entering the Seoul Station Dungeon.]The two of us went through the dungeon the same way we did the first time. We saw Mandra.\u201cThe correct answer is Rancher.\u201d[You have found the \u2018correct answer\u2019.][You have fulfilled the Hidden Piece.][Choose a Reward]Mandra\u2019s CuirassMandra\u2019s GreatswordThe \u2018Mandra\u2019s Gloves\u2019 I had already gotten weren\u2019t included in the list of choices.[You have acquired Mandra\u2019s Cuirass.]The Seoul Station Dungeon was a beginner dungeon, but it gave items with special resistance effects.[Mandra\u2019s Cuirass]Mandra\u2019s Cuirass has a special effect. It has a special resistance to \u2018fire\u2019 and will protect the wearer from countless debuffs.Defense: 7Effects: Fire resistance +3After acquiring the cuirass, we cleared the Seoul Station Dungeon with the same method as before.[You have cleared the Seoul Station Dungeon.][EXP acquired.][350 Coins acquired.][\u2018Black Yak\u2019s Lean Meat\u2019 acquired.]There was no special reward like last time. We were only given Coins and \u2018Black Yak\u2019s Lean Meat\u2019 for clearing the dungeon. I hadn\u2019t expected any special rewards to begin with.\u201cOppa, can we go in again?\u201d\u201cYeah. We\u2019ll do it four more times.\u201d\u201cFour times? Why? You said we only had to get the three items, right?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want any?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah!\u201dSunhwa\u2019s eyes grew wide.\u201cI can also get them?\u201dShe smiled brightly. Apparently, it hadn\u2019t even occurred to her that she might get items of her own.\u201cMakes it easier to use you.\u201d\u201cOppa really is the only one who\u2019s got my best interests in mind!\u201dI gave her a slight noogie. \u201cDon\u2019t stealthily drop the formalities. If I had married early, I could\u2019ve had a daughter your age.\u201d\u201cTch, we\u2019re only six years apart.\u201dI just chuckled. The way she rubbed her head, even though it didn\u2019t hurt at all\u2014she was a genius tanker, after all\u2014made her look like a little kid.\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201dWe went into the Seoul Station Dungeon again. It was time to get the Mandra\u2019s Greatsword.[Mandra\u2019s Greatsword acquired.]Mandra\u2019s Greatsword has a special effect. It has a greater attack power against \u2018earth\u2019 attribute creatures.Attack Power: 18-22Effects:+10% attack power against earth-attribute creatures+10% crit chance against earth-attribute creaturesSunhwa and I finished four rounds of \u2018Independent Play\u2019, and by the end of it, we had two gloves, two cuirasses, and two greatswords.As if she were extremely tired, Sunhwa moaned, \u201cOppa, you\u2019re not a machine, are you?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t whine.\u201dShe was probably tired, but she wasn\u2019t at her limit. She was just acting like a spoiled child right now, and I had no intention of humoring her. Regardless of her cuteness, humoring her at this point in time would interfere with her growth.\u201cYou haven\u2019t reached your limit yet.\u201dI was telling her not to let herself feel tired with just this. In the future, a tiny bit of carelessness could lead to her losing her head. Even I, someone who knew the strategies of the future like the back of my hand, couldn\u2019t afford to be too lax.Sometime during our clears, I had received a DM from the Flame Lord Choi Sung-gu.* * *I set up a meeting with Choi Sung-gu.\u2013Let\u2019s meet at Konkuk University Station.He was definitely an interesting guy. Despite not knowing what the inside of the \u2018Shot Table Dungeon\u2019 looked like\u2026\u2013The more members there are for the clear, the fewer the rewards for each person. I\u2019ve gone in and run back out a few times, and I think three people will be enough. If it really doesn\u2019t work out, we can just leave again.That was his reasoning for insisting on going in with the minimum number members, three. In front of Konkuk University Station, I saw a man wearing glasses.\u2018So he was skinny ten years ago.\u2019Ten years later, the Flame Lord would be much fatter. Choi Sung-gu, prior to his weight gain, was a rather nimble-looking, ordinary man.[Eye of Perception is active.]I read his information, or rather, tried to.[Player]Name: Choi Sung-gu\u201cArgh.\u201dIntense pain assaulted my eyes, almost driving me to my knees.\u201cOppa, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d[The \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019 is invoking their innate power.][You cannot examine \u2018Choi Sung-gu\u2019 with Eye of Perception.]The eye-splitting pain suddenly faded.\u201cI\u2019m alright. Think something got into my eye.\u201dI couldn\u2019t read Sung-gu\u2019s status.\u2018Even though he shouldn\u2019t be level 30 yet?\u2019And even if he was, even if he had picked a Guardian, no one should be interfering this directly so soon.\u2018\u2026Something\u2019s fishy.\u2019I didn\u2019t know what it was, but there had to be a reason why the \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019 blocked my innate ability.\u2018Damn, things would\u2019ve been better for me if I knew why.\u2019For now, I didn\u2019t express my feelings. As Sunhwa and I walked up, Choi Sung-gu looked askew at me.\u201cC\u2019mon man, even if we\u2019re Playing and all, isn\u2019t it a bit much to bring such a young girl into this?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYes, I knew. This man, Choi Sung-gu, had a weakness for kids, and not in a dirty sense like with Seo Joohwan.\u201cDon\u2019t you know that kids are precious treasures who should be protected?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a kid; I\u2019m a young adult.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, in my eyes, you\u2019re a kid. Kids and fried chicken have to be protected.\u201dThe future Flame Lord Choi Sung-gu, and the \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019 who was hiding something. My meeting with the two of them, and our upcoming challenge of the \u2018Shot Table Dungeon\u2019 together.\u2018How interesting.\u2019It was said that the Flame Lord had a significant enlightenment in the Shot Table Dungeon and underwent a great awakening to later become famous as the \u2018Flame Lord\u2019.\u2018What\u2026 will you show me here?\u2019I decided to see for myself just what kind of awakening he would show me here.\u2018And if need be\u2026\u2019It was possible that I might gain the ability that Sung-gu should have gotten, just like the Sword Empress\u2019 \u2018Flash Step\u2019.\u201cYou said you\u2019ve already gone in and come out a few times.\u201dThe Shot Table Dungeon was a dungeon you could freely enter and leave.\u2018I don\u2019t remember anything about that, though.\u2019It was suspicious. It was suspicious that the \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019 was being overprotective about him, and suspicious that the Shot Table Dungeon was apparently a dungeon you could enter and leave freely, something that hadn\u2019t been known in the past. Something was being hidden here.In any case, Sung-gu went on to say that he had challenged the \u2018Shot Table Dungeon\u2019, failed, and ran away a few times. He said there was a monster that was too powerful at the 2nd gateway.\u201cWhat comes out at the 2nd gateway?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSung-gu was silent for a moment.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201dI listened to what he had to say. He did his best to describe it. Even though the description itself was total shit, I was able to deduce what it was.\u2018It can\u2019t be.\u2019The monster Sung-gu was describing\u2026\u2018That\u2019s showing up already?\u2019That monster was one I knew.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: Cross the Ravine of FireThe world I had studied was close to the \u2018regular world\u2019. World history, the general outline of Korean history, knowing the key elements of a few important events, that sort of thing. Universal elements the vast majority of Players had to know.\u2018But there must be a Ranker world for Rankers.\u2019Apparently, that fact applied even now, during the \u2018beginner\u2019 period.What Sung-gu described was a monster that took the form of a large horse, a red steed with a mane and tail made of flames. Wherever its hooves touched, flames would burst forth, dealing fire damage.\u2018Has a level of around 32. A Flame Horse.\u2019The Flame Horse was an animal-type monster usually around level 32. It took the shape of an animal and was simultaneously a spirit-type monster, just like the six-tailed fox.\u2018I don\u2019t think the former Choi Sung-gu revealed the fact that there was a Flame Horse here.\u2019Of course, there was the world of top Rankers that I didn\u2019t know about.\u2018Then how come the former Sung-gu hid the fact he met a Flame Horse in this dungeon?\u2019I didn\u2019t know if it was simply because there was no need for him to say so, or because there was a specific reason why he wasn\u2019t supposed to reveal it.Sung-gu shook his head back and forth. \u201cHaah. Thank god that monster lets you go if it thinks you\u2019re weaker than it. If not for that, I would\u2019ve prolly been reduced to ash by now.\u201dTo summarize Sung-gu\u2019s words\u2014\u201cIf someone\u2019ll take on its attack instead of me, I\u2019ll give it a thrashing. Huhuhu.\u201dFlame Horses were offensive powerhouses, but they had weak defense. Because they were animal-type creatures, they had a glaring weak spot\u2014their heads. So basically, Sung-gu was saying, \u201cYou get hit instead of me, and I\u2019ll attack.\u201d\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve had some amount of success fighting it already.\u201d\u201cYes. Even on my own, I was able to get it to bleed once.\u201dThat\u2019s why he was able to get out of there alive. If the Flame Horse\u2019s blood fell under 20%, he wouldn\u2019t have even been able to flee.\u2018I never thought a Flame Horse would ever show up in a beginner dungeon.\u2019After hearing about the Flame Horse, I understood.\u2018That\u2019s why it\u2019s a dungeon you can freely enter and leave.\u2019It was because the fundamental difficulty was too high. Players were allowed to run away in order to balance the difficulty. Flame Horses were monsters that were inherently lenient to the weak. If you turned tail and ran, they wouldn\u2019t give chase. They would simply look on with the attitude of the strong.\u201cThat means you certainly haven\u2019t progressed to the next gateway, then,\u201d I said.\u201cYes. There wouldn\u2019t be an even stronger guy at the next gateway, right?\u201dYeah, there probably would be. This called for a little preparation.\u201cPlease wait a moment. I need to take care of something real quick.\u201d\u201cEh? So suddenly?\u201dWe didn\u2019t nail down a time for the raid, anyway. Sunhwa and I merely had our first meeting with Choi Sung-gu. Though, well, the person in question seemed to have thought that we would be going straight into the dungeon.\u201cWhat do you need to do so suddenly?\u201d\u201cUnexpected poo.\u201dSung-gu nodded sagely. \u201cI get it.\u201dHe sent me a look of encouragement. At the same time, I also felt jealousy from him. Because he was being protected by the \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019, I couldn\u2019t read his exact state, but I did feel a powerful emotion from him.\u2018He\u2019s sincerely jealous?\u2019Sung-gu said to me, \u201cStay strong. Best of luck. I\u2019m cheering you on. Man, I\u2019m jealous.\u201dSuddenly, I remembered a line in an article saying that for a while, Choi Sung-gu had suffered from severe constipation.* * *We met up with Sung-gu again.\u201cShit. That frickin\u2019 flamin\u2019 donkey. It\u2019s too strong.\u201dHe was right. The Flame Horse was too powerful a monster for us to defeat right now. For one, it was over level 30. It was correct that the beast was difficult to kill.The inside of the dungeon was, as per usual, like an underground cavern.\u201cOnce we pass this part, we\u2019ll reach the 1st gate. I killed a Goblin Soldier there, along with a few black cow-looking guys.\u201dBy black cow, he was probably referring to Black Yaks.\u2018As expected of a one-time dungeon, the monsters don\u2019t respawn.\u2019Killed monsters either didn\u2019t respawn, or had an extremely long respawn time.We encountered a forked path once.\u201cThis path is a dead end, and if we keep going on this one, that monster will show up.\u201d\u201cYou said the field changes, right?\u201d\u201cYes. It changes to a, what\u2019s it called, a grassland.\u201dThe field would change to a place perfectly suited for a Flame Horse to romp around, an expansive grassland. On such terrain, the \u2018Fire Walls\u2019 the monster put up would be very powerful.\u201cThe jerk spews fire, so you have to be careful. If you get hit by that, it\u2019s game over.\u201d He glanced at Sunhwa. \u201cMan, it still bothers me. Making a young lass like her do the tanking is a bit\u2026\u201d After mumbling to himself for a while, he shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s fine since I\u2019m not the one getting hit, I guess\u2026\u201dEven though he was saying it didn\u2019t matter since he wasn\u2019t the one getting hit, there was still a glimmer of worry in his eyes.Sung-gu pleaded for the umpteenth time, \u201cIf you end up needing to bounce, you gotta say so before you book it, alright? So I can book it, too. Got it?\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dSunhwa looked a bit done with Choi Sung-gu now. Just then, the field changed.[You have entered the \u2018Flame Horse\u2019s Grassland\u2019 within the Shot Table Dungeon.]A green grassland stretched out in front of us. A warm sun hung in the sky that was high above us. It almost felt like we were on a Mongolian grassland.\u201cJesus, fuck. Gave me a scare.\u201dAnd just three meters in front of us was the Flame Horse. I observed it with interest. It was a monster I already knew, but it was my first time seeing it in person.Flame Horse LVL 35\u2018It\u2019s higher than normal Flame Horses?\u2019They were usually around level 32, but this one was 3 levels higher. Also, even though it was quite a bit higher than me, I could still see its level.\u2018It\u2019s not normal.\u2019There was no doubt. Something was hidden in this dungeon. Everything was pointing towards that, starting from being freely excitable to the strange actions of the \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019.Sung-gu seemed a little nervous. \u201cWhen shall we attack?\u201dThe Flame Horse was looking this way almost like a ruler, like the strong staring down at the weak from above.[Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is too low to produce a detailed explanation.]If my Eye of Perception proficiency had been a little higher, I would have been able to see more detailed information about the Flame Horse, but\u2026 At least for now, the Flame Horse lined up with what I had studied.\u2018It\u2019s a neutral monster, alright.\u2019I took one step. The Flame Horse\u2019s gaze followed me.\u201cSunhwa and I will do the tanking.\u201dIt was alright to leave the damage dealing to Sung-gu, at least until it was at half HP. Since he had a few rounds of experience, he should be able to manage that easily. Sunhwa followed me in taking one step forward.\u201cSunhwa. You must always be sure to block the flames it spews from its mouth with your shield. That means avoid direct contact. Are we clear?\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dSunhwa\u2019s body would automatically protect her from any other attacks.\u201cSung-gu, please make your preparations as well.\u201dSung-gu clenched his fist hard. The flames flickering around his fist showed that he had already awakened his \u2018attribute ability\u2019.\u2018As expected. The ability to wield flame.\u2019He had already awakened the power of the fire attribute. He might have even advanced already.\u2018He fought well, considering he got to half HP with the same attribute.\u2019\u201cFor now, it\u2019s most wary of me,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll take the front.\u201dI bought a shield from the Item Shop. It was my first time actually tanking. It wasn\u2019t as if I wasn\u2019t nervous being pinned by that monster\u2019s gaze.\u201cSunhwa, you get behind it. Watch out for its kicks.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dSunhwa moved forward. The Flame Horse continued to stand in place and stare at us.\u201cSung-gu, please attack the side. The goal is to bring its HP down to 40%.\u201d I continued, \u201cIf you happen to have a buff that increases crit chance, be sure to use it.\u201d\u201cMm? A buff that increases crit chance?\u201d Sung-gu scratched the back of his neck. \u201cHow\u2019d you know? I do have a skill like that.\u201d\u201cBecause crits are super effective against animal-type monsters.\u201dI didn\u2019t give him more details. I turned my attention to the Flame Horse, approaching it first. Now, it was right in front of me. Level 35. One wrong hit, and I could kick the bucket. The fire ball it spewed from its mouth was particularly dangerous\u2014taking a frontal hit from that was basically almost impossible to recover from.With the shield in one hand, I took out a dagger with the other.\u2018I\u2019ll aim for the middle of the forehead.\u2019I wasn\u2019t thinking about landing a fatal blow with this. If I could hit it, that was great, and if I couldn\u2019t, then it couldn\u2019t be helped.Fwip\u2013!I hurled the dagger. Although I had never learned knife throwing, I did my best to make use of the experience I had throwing the dagger that one time.Neeeeeeeeeeigh!!The Flame Horse screamed, rearing and flailing its front legs, reaching a whopping four meters in height.My dagger had struck it right in the middle of the forehead. But unfortunately, I was apparently unlucky, because it didn\u2019t register as a crit. The HP went down by a bit, and that was all. I hadn\u2019t expected much, anyway.\u2018The battle starts now.\u2019My first battle in this place, which was hiding something, began.* * *Choi Sung-gu felt his confidence grow.\u2018Gosh, the two of them are doing great, huh?\u2019The aggro didn\u2019t jump to him a single time. The Flame Horse was fighting back in a rampage, but it only attacked Kim Hyukjin or Kim Sunhwa.\u2018A fireball!\u2019The Flame Horse suddenly whipped its head around and fired a fireball. Sunhwa turned her body slightly to the side and blocked the flames with her shield, like she had anticipated the attack.\u2018She bounced it off by changing its trajectory.\u2019She blocked it in the way that put the least amount of strain on her body.\u2018This brother and sister duo is seriously great.\u2019[Using the skill \u2018Fatal Flames\u2019.]Flames flickered around Sung-gu\u2019s fist. While the Flame Horse had its attention on Hyukjin and Sunhwa, Sung-gu planted his fist in the monster\u2019s ribs.[\u2018Fatal Flames\u2019 is taking effect.][+3% crit chance]They had accumulated a staggering +33% crit chance, and they had already shaved off at least 30% of its HP.\u2018This is going way more smoothly than I expected.\u2019The Flame Horse\u2019s movements were swift and dangerous, but Hyukjin and Sunhwa\u2019s timely aggro switching and blocking were able to contain it.[\u2018Fatal Flames\u2019 is taking effect.][+3% crit chance][+36% accumulated crit chance]Only Sung-gu could hear the game notices. Hyukjin couldn\u2019t hear the notices, but he could still guess.\u2018He\u2019s stacking up Fatal Flames.\u2019Hyukjin made a calculation with Sung-gu\u2019s current level in mind.\u2018The accumulated crit chance should be around 35%.\u2019He was almost exactly right, despite not hearing the notices. It was like he was taught by someone, even though that was far from the case.\u2018An additional 35% crit chance.\u2019Plus its fatal weakness of being a beast-type monster.\u2018It also has some prominent weak points, like the middle of the forehead and heart, the neck, and the spine.\u2019There was already a dagger embedded in its forehead. In its current state, the chance to land a crit on the Flame Horse was even greater.\u2018Now\u2019s the time.\u2019Hyukjin shouted, \u201cSunhwa! Get close to it! Towards its side.\u201dShe understood immediately. If you approached it in a straight line, there was a high chance you\u2019d get kicked.\u201cGot it!\u201dSunhwa closed in rapidly, making a big motion like she was going to swing her shield. The Flame Horse responded to that movement, turning as fast as Sunhwa, and backed away a little, intending on defending against her attack.Hyukjin had learned the Flame Horse\u2019s habits from fighting it. He judged the distance and waited.\u2018Now.\u2019Stowing away the shield, he pulled out his sword, taking advantage of the brief moment the Flame Horse\u2019s gaze was away from him.[Using the special skill Flash Step.]He reappeared above the Flame Horse, landing on its back. Because its mane was made of flames, it was rather hot.[Mandra\u2019s Cuirass resists fire.]Mandra\u2019s Cuirass, an item with a +3 fire resistance, gave Hyukjin the strength to endure.\u2018If this guy\u2019s master shows up, it\u2019ll be way too tiresome.\u2019It wouldn\u2019t just be tiresome\u2014the ones to die would probably be them. Hyukjin saw the back of its neck.[Using the special skill Excellent Strike.]Spurt!He plunged into the back of the monster\u2019s neck, not with a regular attack, but with a special skill granted by a title. The tip of his sword went through its neck.\u2018It\u2019s not over yet.\u2019It hadn\u2019t been a crit. With some luck, he could have landed a crit with this attack, but he hadn\u2019t had high expectations for getting a crit with just this.Neeeeeeeeigh!The Flame Horse\u2019s HP began to rapidly drop.The flames of the spirit-type Flame Horse, which had special abilities, started becoming even more fierce. It was about to call its master.\u2018Now,\u2019 Hyukjin thought, pulling out yet another thing from his Inventory.Seeing that, Sung-gu\u2019s eyes grew wide.\u2018Da fuq? Are you for real?\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: Cross the Ravine of Fire (2)Choi Sung-gu\u2019s eyes grew wide.\u2018Da fuq? Are you for real?\u2019The thing that came out of Hyukjin\u2019s Inventory wasn\u2019t an item from the System.\u2018A\u00a0fire extinguisher?\u2019The thing in Hyukjin\u2019s hand was definitely a fire extinguisher. It was a convenient spraying type of extinguisher. Sung-gu had seen it before in Internet advertisements. It was purported to extinguish fires much more effectively than regular extinguishers, or something like that.\u201cEh?\u201dBut what surprised Sung-gu even more was that not just Hyukjin, but also Sunhwa, pulled out fire extinguishers. And she was even dual wielding them!Sung-gu was stunned.\u201cHey! How come I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t have one?!\u201dLooking at them now, these two had clearly prepared this in advance. They had planned this together.Szzzzzzzzz\u2013!With the spraying sound, the blazing flames on the Flame Horse\u2019s body were quickly being extinguished.Neeeeeeeigh!The Flame Horse galloped about, emitting a piercing noise that was either a scream or a whinny\u2014it was impossible to tell.\u201cWhy am I the only one left out?!\u201dChoi Sung-gu muttered to himself, wondering if he should go and pee on it, at least, while backing off a little. He did complain that they were leaving him out, but in any case, the key members of the raid right now were Hyukjin and Sunhwa. They both had one in each hand. A total of four fire extinguishers were fully performing their roles.\u2018The places where that horse walked always went up in flames, but now\u2026\u2019Those flames became incredibly annoying traps. But now, they were getting put out. The flames were almost completely gone.\u2018Should\u2019ve used the fire extinguishers sooner, then.\u2019 Or wait. \u2018If they\u2019d used them at the beginning, it probably wouldn\u2019t have worked.\u2019He wasn\u2019t exactly sure, but it seemed to Sung-gu that this Hyukjin fellow used the fire extinguishers at the right time and chance, aiming for the timing where the item(?) that was the fire extinguisher could shine the brightest.\u2018Looks like the flames are pretty much extinguished.\u2019He was almost fascinated by the sight of Hyukjin clinging onto the rampaging horse without falling off. Did he learn horseback riding somewhere? It couldn\u2019t be that he was staying on with his leg strength alone.Sung-gu stealthily approached.[Using the skill Fatal Flames.]Having gotten close, Sung-gu enveloped his fist in flames and struck the Flame Horse\u2019s side.Pow!A loud impact rang out. At the same time, Hyukjin pulled his sword out of the Flame Horse\u2019s neck.Fwish!And then, his sword drew a big arc.The Flame Horse\u2019s head was cut off. It fell onto the ground with a plop.[Flame Horse has been killed.][EXP acquired.][22 Coins acquired.]Hyukjin jumped off the collapsing horse\u2019s back, then shot Sung-gu a grin.\u201cYou backed off and returned with very good timing.\u201dSung-gu\u2019s fist had landed with perfect timing. Thanks to that, Hyukjin was able to cut off the monster\u2019s head with a little more ease.\u201cHmph. I\u2019m in a really bad mood right now, so don\u2019t talk to me.\u201dState: Happy / Excited / Having Fun\u201cLike seriously, why\u2019d you guys leave me out? I\u2019m good at using fire extinguishers too. Shwa, shwa. When I was a kid, I wanted to be a fireman.\u201dHyukjin was so dumbfounded he had to laugh. Even though Sung-gu was complaining, he seemed to be happy to have finally killed the Flame Horse that had stymied his progress.\u201cOppa, an item dropped!\u201d Sunhwa said excitedly.\u201cAn item?\u201dHyukjin examined the item. Its name was \u2018Essence of Flame\u2019.\u2018Eh?\u2019It was already strange enough that there was suddenly a \u2018Flame Horse\u2019 here, but that Flame Horse dropped an \u2018Essence of Flame\u2019.\u2018An Essence of Flame drops from a frickin\u2019 Flame Horse?\u2019Essence of Flame wasn\u2019t a beginner period item. There was a place in the Philippines famous for dropping Essence of Flames, the \u2018White Beach Dungeon\u2019 on Boracay Island.\u2018To clear that dungeon, you need at least ten level 50 Players.\u2019Meaning, this really wasn\u2019t an item that should show up in the beginner period, at least.\u2018So why? Why\u2019d it show up here?\u2019Hyukjin bent to pick up the \u2018Essence of Flame\u2019 that was giving off a yellow light.[Essence of Flame]An awakening material that awakens one\u2019s fire attribute magic power. When ingested by a Player with fire affinity, all their fire attribute abilities will increase.Level requirement: 20Ingestion condition: Must have a contract with a special GuardianAfter reading the item description, Hyukjin was sure of it.\u2018The Shot Table Dungeon is a dungeon made by the Giant of the Sunset to awaken Choi Sung-gu.\u2019The original level requirement of the \u2018Essence of Flame\u2019 was 40. It varied depending on the grade of the essence, but it was normally around 40.\u2018The level requirement is 20, plus there\u2019s an ingestion condition that usually isn\u2019t there.\u2019This item didn\u2019t normally have an extra ingestion condition. If a Player without fire affinity ingested it, their other abilities would be weakened as a side effect. In other words, only people with the appropriate constitution should consume the \u2018Essence of Flame\u2019, and it wasn\u2019t that great of an item for people like Hyukjin who didn\u2019t have an affinity to a specific attribute.Hyukjin recalled the notices he had heard earlier.[The \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019 is invoking their innate power.][You cannot examine \u2018Choi Sung-gu\u2019 with Eye of Perception.]The Giant of the Sunset was blatantly aiding a Player here. This was a place he had prepared and given to Choi Sung-gu.\u2018If I were to eat this thing here\u2026\u2019I would 100% become the Giant of the Sunset\u2019s enemy. That was not a desirable development.\u201cWhat\u2019s that item you just got?\u201d asked Sung-gu.\u201cEssence of Flame. When eaten by a Player with a constitution that matches the fire attribute, this awakening material will enhance their fire abilities.\u201d\u201cHuh? I\u2019m exactly that, a Player suited to the flame attribute.\u201dHis \u2018huhuhu\u2019-ing made him look like he was gleefully saying \u2018that thing\u2019s mine!\u2019Hyukjin said, \u201cI think this could fetch an incredibly high price if it were sold later. What do you think about splitting the earnings?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Sung-gu flinched. \u201cR-R-Right, it can be sold, huh.\u201dThat was what was fair. It was only one item and couldn\u2019t be split. Hyukjin continued to examine Sung-gu. It didn\u2019t seem like he was hearing anything special from the Guardians, particularly from the Giant of the Sunset.\u2018In the past, Choi Sung-gu cleared this place alone.\u2019There was a high chance he\u2019d absorbed the Essence of Flame here.\u2018The fact there\u2019s a Flame Horse at the 2nd Gateway means there might be even stronger foes at the later gateways.\u2019If that was true, it was possible Sung-gu, who had the Giant of the Sunset\u2019s direct protection, would need to play a prominent role.\u201cBut I think it would be best if you were to eat this now, Sung-gu.\u201dBeaming from ear to ear, Sung-gu took the item. Despite taking it with a whoop of \u2018Yas, it\u2019s mine!\u2019, he wasn\u2019t actually able to ingest it. He was all smiles on the outside, but was apparently feeling a great deal of pressure on the inside.\u201cWait. Um. I should really eat this?\u201dHe looked like he would gulp it down right away just moments ago, but was hesitating now that he had to take the plunge.\u201cI think you\u2019re the Player with the highest fire affinity.\u201d\u201cI should really eat it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSung-gu stopped short of eating it several times, hesitating. Everyone had worked hard together, so it was only right to share the reward, no?\u201cBut.. why give it to me? You could eat it too, Hyukjin. To be honest, you\u2019re the one who had the biggest influence on this raid.\u201dHyukjin thought for a moment. The Giant of the Sunset was sure to be watching at this very moment.\u201cTake a look at the item description.\u201d\u201cName, Essence of Flame. An awakening material that\u2026\u201dHe read out the description.Ingestion condition: Must have the protection of the \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019\u201c\u2026It requires the protection of the Giant of the Sunset.\u201dHyukjin almost laughed out of speechlessness.\u2018The description changed from when I had it?\u2019When Hyukjin had it, it definitely said \u2018Must have a contract with a special Guardian\u2019, but when the ownership changed to Sung-gu, the description explicitly said \u2018Must have the protection of the Giant of the Sunset\u2019.\u2018I\u2019m sure of it now.\u2019This place was a dungeon belonging to Choi Sung-gu, made for Choi Sung-gu, and made because of Choi Sung-gu. The \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019 had used his power to make that happen. The Guardian had probably invested an astoundingly huge amount of Coins. Very rarely, there were Guardians like this\u2014Guardians crazy about a Player, ones that poured everything they had on us Players who were called their avatars or incarnations.\u2018If I had eaten it, I would\u2019ve had a seizure.\u2019Hyukjin would have suffered a pretty big side effect, since he hadn\u2019t satisfied the actual condition.\u201cI have never heard the name \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019.\u201d\u201cReally? I hear it every day.\u201d\u201cThen that must mean you have been chosen by that Guardian. Don\u2019t get hung up on what that means and just ingest the item for now.\u201dSung-gu scratched his head, clearly bothered by his conscience.Hyukjin smiled. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let it bother you too much. If you really feel that way, let\u2019s do it like this. We\u2019ll have dibs on the next reward that comes out. Of course, I\u2019m not saying we\u2019ll get it no matter what. We\u2019ll still need to discuss it first. That\u2019s enough, right?\u201dOnly then did Sung-gu nod. \u201cThat\u2019ll make me feel a bit better. I\u2019ll eat this then, alright?\u201dHyukjin nodded, feeling satisfied too. This place was a training center made by the \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019 to awaken Choi Sung-gu by investing a ton of Coins. There was no knowing what kind of wonderful goodies might be hidden inside.Hyukjin\u2019s words just now spoken were addressed to the Giant of the Sunset rather than Sung-gu. Since he had said this well in advance, he had a justification now.\u2018And Sung-gu himself said he would concede ownership.\u2019The Giant of the Sunset had no grounds to protest anymore. With a small investment of around five minutes, Hyukjin had secured definite justification.[The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is enjoying your Playing.]* * *Sung-gu ingested the Essence of Flame. Other than a brief moment where his body was covered in flames, there was no obvious, visible change. Our group moved onwards, finding a \u2018portal\u2019 at one side of the grassland. It was a magic circle, like a gate that would teleport us to a different place.We were able to reach the next gateway through the portal.[Entering the \u20183rd Gateway\u2019 within the \u2018Shot Table Dungeon\u2019.][You have entered the \u2018Ravine of Fire\u2019.]Some distance away, I could see a valley. It was exactly as its name suggested\u2014a ravine where fire flowed instead of water. It almost looked like a river of lava.The air was blistering hot. Sweat began to bead on my forehead.\u2018It\u2019s hot.\u2019It wasn\u2019t just a normal level of hot. It was\u00a0hot.\u00a0The ravine flowing with fire was exuding a great deal of \u2018heat energy\u2019.The gap between the ravine stretched about seven meters. We had to cross that, but there was no bridge to be seen. Meaning, we had to go through the flames.Sunhwa tugged my arm. \u201cOppa, the portal\u2019s disappearing.\u201d[Satisfy the clear condition for the 3rd Gateway, the \u2018Ravine of Fire\u2019.][If you do not satisfy the clear condition, you cannot leave.]My brows furrowed.\u2018Clear?\u2019We were given a System quest.[Cross the Ravine of Fire]On the other side of the Ravine of Fire is a land of riches and wealth. It is known that there is \u2018Kuntan\u2019 there. Please cross the Ravine of Fire.Sung-gu\u2019s expression turned serious. \u201cI think I can cross it, but\u2026\u201dNaturally. He was a Player\u2014one who would later be called the Flame Lord\u2014with an affinity to fire, had just ingested an \u2018Essence of Flame\u2019, and was under the protection of the \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019 who had undoubtedly designed this dungeon.\u201cI have a feeling. I can definitely cross that.\u201dOf course he could. I didn\u2019t contradict him. After all, I had already judged that this \u2018Ravine of Fire\u2019 was something created to allow Sung-gu to absorb that \u2018heat energy\u2019 to begin with.\u201cDo you think you two can cross it?\u201d Sung-gu asked.\u201cNot sure.\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t be easy. The ravine had a width of seven meters and a depth of approximately seventy centimetres. If Sunhwa and I went in unprepared, we would certainly die.\u2018The Giant of the Sunset\u2026 doesn\u2019t want there to be any survivors other than Choi Sung-gu.\u2019This place was made for Sung-gu, and Sung-gu alone.\u2018With this degree of difficulty, I think it\u2019s the highest difficulty a beginner grade dungeon can go\u2026\u2019No matter how many more Coins were put in, the difficulty couldn\u2019t be raised any higher.\u2018In other words, this is the stretch of the dungeon with the highest difficulty.\u2019How they would go through this highest difficulty stretch was the issue at hand. And fortunately, I knew the method to resolve this issue.But just then, Sung-gu said something I hadn\u2019t expected.\u201cAh, but you know\u2026\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Giant of the Sunset\u201cAh, fuck it. A man\u2019s got to have some pride. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going alone,\u201d Sung-gu said.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat the heck was with this guy? I was about to tell him to go alone, but he preempted me, as if he had an Eye of Perception and had read my mind.\u201cSung-gu. Please listen to me carefully.\u201dThis is a place made by the \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019 for you. That Guardian has gone all-in for you and dislikes other people.\u2018And telling us to cross that ravine is like telling us to die.\u2019For now, it would be best to separate from Sung-gu and come up with a strategy. If we were with Sung-gu, the Giant of the Sunset who was only looking out for Sung-gu would find some way to kill us, in order to make it so that the rest of the rewards would go to Sung-gu alone.\u201cI believe you have a very high fire affinity, and you have even eaten the Essence of Flame.\u201dThe original level restriction for Essence of Flame was 40.\u201cAlso, there\u2019s a high chance you even have a special skill that increases your resistance to fire.\u201dEveryone knew that no fire on earth could harm the Flame Lord.\u201cJust as you said earlier, you can cross that ravine with no problems.\u201d\u201cYes. \u2018Cause I\u2019m a genius. I can cross it,\u201d Sung-gu said, cutting me off. \u201cBut still, how could I possibly go on alone, leaving you two behind? I have some pride. I won\u2019t do that.\u201dThe tight line of his lips seemed to express his powerful resolve.\u2018He\u2019s being sincere.\u2019 He was sincerely refusing to cross. \u2018But that\u2019s not actually helping me\u2026\u2019You\u2019ve gotta go ahead and clear this place on your own, dude. Sunhwa and I are probably blocked from entering the rest of the dungeon anyway, and the Giant of the Sunset will make it so you can clear this place no matter what.\u201cSung-gu.\u201dI stared at Sung-gu. I was grateful for his intent. If it were me, I might have made a different choice. In truth, I didn\u2019t open the convenience store door in the Tutorial Field in order to guarantee my own survival. I put my life before all others. I didn\u2019t think that was wrong or bad. It was just that Sung-gu was a little unique.\u201cSunhwa and I can\u2019t cross that anyway. We would burn to death trying.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to figure out a way.\u201dThere was already a method. It was just that I didn\u2019t want to be noticed by the \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019.\u201cNo, I think it would be better for you to go through alone.\u201d\u201cAnd what I\u2019m saying is, I\u2019m absolutely opposed to that!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not telling you to abandon us. I\u2019m asking you to quickly clear this place before something happens while we wait here. As quickly as possible.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dChoi Sung-gu\u2019s eyes widened. \u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve even eaten the Essence of Flame and have the protection of a special Guardian. In your current state, you will be able to clear this dungeon.\u201d\u201cBut, but still\u2026\u201dSung-gu wasn\u2019t an idiot. He was one of the 8 Heroes representing Korea. At first, he stubbornly rejected my proposal, but before long, he understood what I was getting at.\u201cAh, dammit. Alright.\u201d Sung-gu\u2019s face twisted into a scowl. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go clear this reaaaal quick, so just wait a sec.\u201dWhat little I could read from Sung-gu\u2019s status with Eye of Perception changed slightly.State: Apologetic / Determined / Fired UpSummary: Emotionally Moved ChampionSung-gu walked towards the Ravine of Fire. For some reason, his back gave me the impression that he was deeply moved.\u201cThanks for making the correct judgment in this situation. And for not being greedy about the item and giving it to me. This is what Playing is. This is how Playing should be done. Thanks for teaching me that.\u201dAh. Was this why he was touched?\u201cI will definitely clear this goddamned place and save you. You guys stay right here and wait for me.\u201dUm\u2026 this isn\u2019t really a \u2018goddamned place\u2019. It was made for you, Mr. Emotionally Moved Champion.Sung-gu crossed the Ravine of Fire first.\u2018Phew.\u2019I was relieved. The Giant of the Sunset would now focus his attention solely on Sung-gu, which meant it was now time for us to take the next step.* * *Sunhwa and I talked a little. What we said wasn\u2019t all that important. Just \u2018will it be okay?\u2019 and \u2018let\u2019s hope so\u2019, \u2018all we can do is wait here\u2019. Stuff like that.This little conversation was just to divert attention, to fool the \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019 in case he was in Senia\u2019s channel.As I chatted with Sunhwa, I bought a \u2018Whisper Stone\u2019 from the Item Shop. It was an item that would allow me to have a private conversation with a Streamer, an Intermediate Administrator.[Sending the Intermediate Administrator Senia a whisper request.][The Intermediate Administrator Senia has accepted your whisper request.]Senia. Can you go stream some other Players? Or just turn off your broadcast entirely.I will decide how I stream.No, you idiot. You\u2019re a fucking beginner. Listen to your oppa.I\u2019m just going to be sitting here. It\u2019ll be boring for the Guardians, you know?It wasn\u2019t that hard to coax Senia. It was a little tricky to carry on a voiced conversation with Sunhwa while whispering Senia, but this too, was manageable.Senia. Think carefully. From the Tutorial Field to now, you\u2019ve always just focused your streaming on me. And what has that process been like? I\u2019ve come this far without much difficulty or hurdle.Senia didn\u2019t respond. She simply stared at me, as if to tell me to go on.That is to say, you\u2019ve been directing the same way the entire time. With no sense of crisis, nothing. Just the same old method. You think that\u2019ll appeal to the Guardians, who are in constant pursuit of fresh excitement?\u2026It seemed she was already half-convinced. It really was a breeze to coax beginner Streamers ten years ago.That Ravine of Fire is a big trial for me. The Guardians must be curious about what I\u2019ll do, right?This wasn\u2019t a lie.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 closely observes you.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 cannot wait to see how you will overcome the difficulty in question.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 recommends that you challenge the Ravine of Fire.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is bored.]A whopping four Guardians who had revealed their names were watching me. The ones that hadn\u2019t revealed their names were probably kicking up a fuss altogether.Turn off your broadcast here. Make it sound like I will either die or give up here, and then show them a recorded broadcast later. Dramatically.In all truth, this technique was one that future Streamers often utilized, because it was more effective than showing the same material, creating the same pattern all the time.In exchange, I will cross that Ravine of Fire. Using a method unique to me.Is it really possible to cross the Ravine of Fire?Of course it was. In the end, Senia accepted my proposal. See? She was planning on accepting it from the start.I will pause the stream after thirty seconds. Afterwards, I will go into recording mode.Senia asked one more thing, as if to satisfy her curiosity.But, how\u2026 are you continuing to converse with Player Kim Sunhwa right now?Speaking and whispering at the same time was confusing and tricky at first, but I quickly got the hang of it.Why do you ask?\u2026It\u2019s nothing.I could do it because it wasn\u2019t all that hard once I tried it. Come to think of it, I couldn\u2019t quite remember any Players in the future who could do both simultaneously. Or was I mistaken?I was just\u2026 able to do it when I tried?* * *[Channel #19207 has closed.]The channel was closed. Now, there were no Guardians who could watch me.\u2018Senia also looks super curious.\u2019She was probably very curious about how I would go across the Ravine of Fire. Even after getting her to close her channel, the trials didn\u2019t end there.[The Ravine of Fire does not tolerate living beings.][The Ravine of Fire is moving to swallow all life.]From that, I knew.\u2018The Giant of the Sunset is trying to make sure we\u2019re dead.\u2019Even if he couldn\u2019t see, he wasn\u2019t one to let things slip his grasp. He was one thorough bastard. You could see that from the way he designed things to kill us no matter what.\u201cSenia. Don\u2019t worry too much. We were planning on crossing it anyway.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Ravine of Fire was getting closer? All the better. I was intending on going through it anyway, without catching the attention of the Giant of the Sunset. I moved towards the ravine. Since it was coming my way, my relative speed would actually increase.\u2018Maybe I need to thank him instead. Haha.\u2019\u201cSunhwa. It could get a little hot.\u201dThat being said, this kid had a body of stone. She wouldn\u2019t be greatly injured.\u201cGot it. I trust you, oppa.\u201dI picked up Sunhwa. Even though she was in her first year of middle school, she was so petite that she could pass for an elementary school student. She wasn\u2019t very heavy.\u2018Hoo.\u2019This wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d ever done before.\u2018Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be using Flash Step while holding someone.\u2019It wouldn\u2019t be easy. That Ravine of Fire was a trap put down by the Giant of Sunset to roast us to a crisp. The air was getting hotter and hotter. The Ravine of Fire was truly moving towards us.\u2018The Sword Empress used Flash Step like this before, too.\u2019Flash Step was different from a magician\u2019s Warp. Warp didn\u2019t have \u2018continuity\u2019. It was teleportation between one point to another, with no in-between. But Flash Step moved via a \u2018line\u2019. Your body moved quickly in order to go from one point to another, so quickly the opponent couldn\u2019t react.\u2018To put it another way, we have to go through those flames anyway.\u2019If I was using Warp, those flames wouldn\u2019t touch us, but with Flash Step, they would graze us for just a split second.My heart thumped. I was intending on crossing it quickly with this Flash Step skill, but I would be doing it with Sunhwa in my arms. If I messed up, one of us could be seriously injured or even die.The bright-red flames whirled and whipped. Even the Flame Lord Choi Sung-gu had gone through it, screaming, \u201cOw! Fuck! Fucking hell, it\u2019s hot! Fuckity fuck, it\u2019s hotttt!\u201d while downing potions like a madman.I stopped right in front of the ravine.\u2018It\u2019s outrageously hot.\u2019One tiny step, and my legs would come into direct contact with those flames. Sweat poured like rain from Sunhwa\u2019s body as well, and her face was wet with sweat. This degree of heat should be painful, but she didn\u2019t voice a single complaint.\u2018Hoo.\u2019From here on out, it would be the real deal. It wasn\u2019t possible to cross this thing with Flash Step alone. If we went through as we were now, those fierce flames would swallow us alive.[Fox Tail]A Six-Tailed Fox\u2019s tail. It\u2019s said that the Six-Tailed Fox uses the strength from this tail to carry out its spiritual arts, and if used by someone else, the Six-Tailed Fox\u2019s tail will lose its strength and be destroyed.Can generate \u2018Foxfire\u2019.Foxfire: A small field with very high fire affinity/resistance.2.

It would make a very small field. Its range was about thirty centimetres around the ground I was standing on.\u2018Hoo.\u2019I took a deep breath. A distance of seven meters. I couldn\u2019t mess up.\u2018Here I go.\u2019I tensed my legs and slightly lowered my waist in preparation to jump. Flash Step could be used even without a preparation stance, but it should still be slightly more favorable to take a stance beforehand.I drew out the motion in my head.\u2018The other side of the Ravine of Fire, past the surging flames.\u2019I had already used Eye of Perception to see how Choi Sung-gu got to the other side, which wasn\u2019t visible. I hadn\u2019t been able to see how much he had to walk with my eyes, but I did see it with Eye of Perception.[Use Fox Tail?][Generating \u2018Foxfire\u2019.][You are within the domain of \u2018Foxfire\u2019.][Your fire affinity and resistance have dramatically increased.]I used the Fox Tail.[Using the skill Flash Step.]Then, I used the Sword Empress\u2019 skill, Flash Step, immediately afterwards. I surged forward with Sunhwa in my arms. The moment I did so, I felt flames far hotter than I\u2019d imagined enveloping my body. I clenched my teeth.\u2018Without fail\u2026 we will cross\u2026!Giant of the Sunset, you biased asshole. I won\u2019t die here!____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: Giant of the Sunset (2)Hyukjin used the foot technique for the instantaneous, swift movement that the former Sword Empress used.\u2018It\u2019s hot.\u2019For a moment, he almost dropped Sunhwa. It felt like the flames were eating him alive, like he had jumped into a blazing blast furnace. Intense fear of being burned into nothingness and the thought of melting away if he stayed for a moment longer in those flames assailed him.[You have been exposed to intense heat energy.][The durability of Pygmy\u2019s Ring has begun to rapidly fall.][Mandra\u2019s Cuirass has been destroyed.]The cuirass with fire resistance was destroyed. Not just Hyukjin\u2019s, but also the one Sunhwa was wearing crumbled apart, never to be repaired again.[The intense heat energy has begun to affect the Player\u2019s body.]Hyukjin sucked in ragged breaths.[Pygmy\u2019s Ring has been destroyed.]A whopping rare-grade item was destroyed. Although they were in the flames for a very short moment, the ring was obliterated. Even so, they somehow barely made it.\u201cAre you\u2026 okay?\u201dSunhwa nodded. Hyukjin put her down onto the ground. Both of them looked terrible. The ends of their hair were singed off, and they had scorch marks all over. The only relief was that at least the scorch marks covered their bare bodies.\u201cOpen the Item Shop and buy something to put on. It\u2019s fine if it\u2019s cheap.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhether it was because of the heat exuded by the Ravine of Fire, or because she was embarrassed, Sunhwa\u2019s face was as red as a tomato. Hyukjin turned around and dodged her eyes out of pointless embarrassment.\u201cSorry.\u201dShe was at a very sensitive age, and all of her clothes had been unintentionally burnt up. Hyukjin also bought beginner leather clothing from the Item Shop and put them on. Wearing them posed no inconvenience\u2014one click, and they were automatically put on his body, almost like a game.\u2018I did see this sort of thing often on Youtube\u2026\u2019During a raid, a Player\u2019s clothes were often the first to take the fall instead of their body. That was why some Rankers put on an inner layer of clothes with a focus on extremely high durability regardless of their defense in order to avoid being exposed. Tanks were especially prone to doing so.\u2018For me, well\u2026 It\u2019s alright.\u2019Hyukjin didn\u2019t see Sunhwa as a woman. In his eyes, only mentally ill people like Seo Joohwan would see Sunhwa as a woman. So he wasn\u2019t all that concerned by the fact that he inadvertently flashed his naked body. He was simply a little concerned that he had made all her clothes burn up when she was at a very sensitive age.\u2018She needs to get used to situations like this, too.\u2019If Sunhwa was going to walk the path of a tank, this sort of thing would happen.After a moment, Sunhwa spoke up.\u201cNo, if not for oppa, I would have burned to death over there.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that she was completely unabashed. Hyukjin might be a person she trusted and relied on, but it was still embarrassing and awkward. However, her relief at having gone through those flames mostly intact was greater than her embarrassment.\u201cYeah.\u201dHyukjin didn\u2019t say much, either. To be more precise, he couldn\u2019t. It was because the notices had continued even before he bought new clothes and put them on.\u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019 Earlier, when he instantly accelerated to an incredible speed using Flash Step, he\u2019d heard a notice.He hadn\u2019t heard it properly because the heat was so suffocating and intense, but when he thought back to it, he was able to remember the notice.[The intense heat energy has begun to affect the Player\u2019s body.]It didn\u2019t boil down to simply \u2018affecting\u2019 his body.[You have succeeded in going through the \u2018Ravine of Fire\u2019.][All those who go through the \u2018Ravine of Fire\u2019 are granted a title.][You have been granted the title \u2018Person of Fire\u2019.]\u2018Person of Fire\u2019?[Person of Fire]A title that increases one\u2019s fire affinity and resistance a considerable amount.+5 fire affinity+5 fire resistance+10% additional damage when using a fire attribute attack-10% damage taken from a fire attribute attackHyukjin got a sense for what kind of title \u2018Person of Fire\u2019 was.Ten years later, one of the Flame Lord Choi Sung-gu\u2019s titles was \u2018Immortal Vulcan\u2019.This \u2018Person of Fire\u2019 title would probably become \u2018Immortal Vulcan\u2019 after a few evolutions.\u2018Sung-gu must have gotten this title here, too.\u2019Actually, it was a title only Sung-gu was supposed to get. After all, if things had gone according to the Giant of the Sunset\u2019s plans, we would have been long reduced to ashes in the Ravine of Fire.\u201cOppa, I got a title, too.\u201d\u201cI know. You got Person of Fire, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSunhwa looked really happy that she got a title.\u201cHappy?\u201dSunhwa nodded. \u201cTo be honest, I was really scared earlier.\u201d\u201cOf what?\u201d\u201cI thought the flames would swallow me alive.\u201d\u201cYour body\u2019s sturdier than mine. Even I was fine, so it goes without saying that you\u2019d be fine.\u201dThat was a certainty. I had the help of \u2018Pygmy\u2019s Ring\u2019. Sunhwa had gone through without that, wearing only Mandra\u2019s Cuirass.\u201cMy brain knows that, but I don\u2019t think my heart is able to accept it yet.\u201dHyukjin chuckled. That was only natural. Sunhwa was keeping up with him, but she was still undoubtedly a beginner Player. Only two months had passed since the Cataclysm.\u2018I\u2019ve done all I can now.\u2019All that was left was to wait. They had to wait until Choi Sung-gu, the one under the Giant of the Sunset\u2019s protection, cleared the dungeon.\u201cWe\u2019re gonna stay right here.\u201d\u201cHere?\u201dHyukjin whispered to Sunhwa in a voice so quiet that Senia wouldn\u2019t be able to hear. \u201cBecause the Giant of the Sunset might try to kill us again if he discovers we\u2019re still alive.\u201dThe sole monopolizer of this dungeon\u2019s treasures had to be Choi Sung-gu. That was the reason this dungeon existed. That\u2019s why he had asked Senia to pause her stream. Sunhwa nodded in understanding.\u2018Choi Sung-gu will definitely clear this dungeon.\u2019He just didn\u2019t know how much time Sung-gu would need. In any case, Sung-gu would be able to do it. Hyukjin decided not to worry about it.* * *We crossed the Ravine of Fire and earned the \u2018Person of Fire\u2019 title. I tried to stay as relaxed as possible\u2014nothing good would come from being impatient here. Sunhwa seemed very tense, so I chatted with her to try to ease her nerves.\u201cWhat do you wanna do when we get out?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d As she hummed in contemplation, Sunhwa looked like she had let go of the nerves you couldn\u2019t help but feel in a dungeon. I could feel it through Eye of Perception.\u201cI want to eat.\u201d\u201cEat? What do you wanna eat?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dSunhwa thought seriously for a long while again. To this 14-year-old middle school student, the question of what she would eat was apparently a very serious matter.\u201cTonkatsu! I wanna eat tonkatsu!\u201d\u201cAh, tonkatsu.\u201dSunhwa\u2019s expression brightened as she exclaimed, as if she were a little happier by simply thinking about tonkatsu.\u201cYeah. Tonkatsu\u2019s tasty.\u201d Then, she asked, \u201cIf I go with you, can I eat it without getting in trouble?\u201d\u201cIn trouble? Why?\u201dAfter hearing what she had to say, I was taken aback. Sunhwa said she had gotten an allowance at the orphanage. Of course, it wasn\u2019t much. She\u2019d gotten a really tiny amount from the education program in order to get a sense of economics.She told me she had patiently saved up penny by penny before going to a nearby snack stand.\u201cA poor brat like you wants to eat tonkatsu? No chance in hell,\u201d some grandpa said, punishing her and making her really scared, even though the tonkatsu at the snack stand had only cost six bucks.My heart ached. I could see my former self in her.\u201cLet\u2019s go eat tonkatsu.\u201dBack before I returned to this year, I had mumbled something while laying on my bed after realizing once again that life was not easy.\u201cThe world sure is a bitch.\u201dAfterwards, I fell asleep. Similar to how the world had seemed so cruel to me, it might have been a scary place for Sunhwa. I thought once again that I didn\u2019t want to live like that ever again.Time passed. It wasn\u2019t a short amount of time, something around six hours. I was fine, but Sunhwa endured the time with a patience that didn\u2019t suit her fourteen years of age, and at long last, the dungeon was cleared.[The \u2018Shot Table Dungeon\u2019 has been cleared.][Distributing the \u2018Shot Table Dungeon\u2019 clear rewards.]Naturally, the lion\u2019s share of the rewards would go to Sung-gu. Sunhwa and I would get a set portion, but I didn\u2019t expect much.[150 Coins acquired.][EXP acquired.]My level also went up.[Level increased.][Current level: 27][\u20181/3 Map Fragment\u2019 acquired.]* * *We left the Shot Table Dungeon. There weren\u2019t policemen waiting on the other side like with the Seoul Station Dungeon.I heard a voice.\u201cThank fucking god!\u201d It was a naked man. \u201cYou\u2019re alive!\u201dHe pulled me into his arms. It had happened so suddenly that I hadn\u2019t been able to dodge.\u201cPut some\u2026 clothes on, will you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re alive. It took so long that I worried you might have died!\u201d Tears poured out of Sung-gu\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou did well. You did really well to live. If you two had died, I was planning on just ending it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEye of Perception told me he was serious.\u201cThank you for surviving!\u201dState: Gratitude / Relief / JoyHe had truly been worried for us. Senia\u2019s stream was off, but Sung-gu\u2019s currently invisible Streamer was apparently still streaming. I heard some notices.[The \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019 is astonished.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is happy.][The \u2018Boundary of Blue Light\u2019 has begun to pay attention to you.]A new Guardian who had revealed their name in the channel of Sung-gu\u2019s Streamer began to take note of me. It wasn\u2019t a name I remembered. They didn\u2019t seem to be a very famous Guardian, but I was still happy. This was how a Player got their name out.\u2018He must have already known as soon as the map was split into three parts. That we were alive.\u2019But the Giant could only be astonished after confirming it for himself.\u2018Biased asshole.\u2019If the Courageous Lion King was a courage-lover, then the Giant of the Sunset was a jerk who loved playing favorites. While I was thinking that, Sung-gu extended a \u2018magic tome\u2019 to me.\u201cHere. Take it.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cWhen I got the Essence of Flame, I said so, didn\u2019t I? That I would give you the next item.\u201dLooking at his expression, which seemed to be loudly proclaiming, \u2018I\u2019m a guy who always keeps his promises!\u2019 I couldn\u2019t help but laugh in amazement.\u201cThat\u2019s why you want to give this to me?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI was able to click the magic tome\u2019s name.[Vulcan Body Tome]The Vulcan Body Tome. Even in the world ten years from now, this magic tome was so rare it had only been found ten times. Every single person who acquired this tome became one of the top Rankers in the world, and Choi Sung-gu was among them.\u201cA promise is a promise!\u201dSung-gu puffed out his chest, looking proud of the very fact that he was giving this to me. It seemed he thought that this was what a person should naturally do.\u201c\u2026\u201dI deliberated for a moment. Should I take it, or not?\u2018If I take it\u2026\u2019The Flame Lord would probably disappear from this world. The changes Choi Sung-gu formerly brought about would never happen.\u2018I don\u2019t fear changing the future.\u2019I didn\u2019t fear that in itself. There was a problem that was more pressing than that.[The \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019 is watching you.][The \u2018Giant of the Sunset\u2019 is monitoring you.]A certain biased asshole was watching me, and not in the good sense. This Guardian had tried to block any Player other than Choi Sung-gu from getting rewards. So what would happen if I continued to defy his will and accepted that magic tome?\u2018He\u2019ll probably go into Senia\u2019s channel and try to kill me, no matter how.\u2019Simply put, I would be put on a Guardian\u2019s hit list, one strong enough to raise the future Flame Lord. Getting on the wrong side of a Guardian that powerful could make life very hairy.\u2018Annoying bastard.\u2019I already had a courage-lover to deal with, and now this biased asshole. One day, I would definitely make these two pay, no matter what I had to do.\u2018Instead of taking that right away\u2026\u2019I decided to draw a slightly bigger picture and future. Instead of going for a small profit now, I would wait to reap a bigger profit a little further down the line. Because as long as I had the \u20181/3 Map Fragment\u2019, it was possible to change the person in the driver\u2019s seat from the Giant of the Sunset to\u00a0me.\u201cSung-gu. Allow me to make a proposal.\u201dAlright then, shall we draw?____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: A Real PartyI had received a 1/3 Map Fragment. Ultimately, it meant that the other 2/3s would be necessary in order to clear whatever dungeon or gate was coming after the \u2018Shot Table Dungeon\u2019. Choi Sung-gu had to do it with us.\u2018I\u2019m sure the Giant of the Sunset knows that, too.\u2019He was probably in quite the shock up there. The dungeon was one he prepared for Choi Sung-gu\u2019s sole enjoyment, but two sudden variables showed up in the form of Sunhwa and me and took a bigger portion of the reward than Sung-gu.\u2018Even though he\u2019s super biased\u2026 he still can\u2019t ignore the order itself. Isn\u2019t that right? Biased asshole.\u2019The System had its own set of rules. That\u2019s why the Giant of the Sunset was going through the trouble of fostering Sung-gu through the gateway that was a \u2018dungeon\u2019. Without his direct interference, he prescribed a set of trials and issued rewards only when those trials were properly surmounted.\u2018Maybe it\u2019d be different if he were as reckless and brash as the Demon King\u2019s Guardian.\u2019If he were on the level of the Demon King\u2019s un-named Guardian, he might\u2019ve been able to ignore things like order or rules altogether. It was known that the Demon King\u2019s Guardian was more powerful and had more authority than any other Guardian in the world. That Guardian didn\u2019t even bother to give things through dungeons; They just rained down rewards indiscriminately. At least, that was how the rumors went.\u2018In any case.\u2019I decided to make a mutual contract with Choi Sung-gu, and I had to get Sung-gu to go into it 100% voluntarily.\u201cI have special eyes.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a total lie that I was deceiving him. I used a clever combination of truth and lies to lead him into doing what I wanted.\u201cThe Vulcan Body Tome is an item that you need far more than I do. So I think it would be best for you to use this.\u201d\u201cAh. Like I said, that\u2019s not what\u2019s important here. I\u2019m saying you absolutely need to have this, y\u2019know? I won\u2019t be able to sleep at night otherwise!\u201dYes, I understand. So listen to me, please.\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to do this thing called a contract with you. Of course, you can refuse if you don\u2019t want to.\u201dThere were now NPCs on the 1st floor of the Gwanghwamun D-Tower, including NPCs that would oversee contracts. They were called \u2018notary NPCs\u2019.\u201c\u2026A contract like this.\u201dChoi Sung-gu scowled. \u201cI\u2019ve got some pride, y\u2019know. What\u2019s a measly 3%? I\u2019ll give you 30% like a real man.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe details of the contract weren\u2019t anything special. It was a contract stating that for the next ten years, 30% of all profits earned by Choi Sung-gu would go to me.\u2018Players, as well as the new tech market, will grow rapidly.\u2019And the profits the Flame Lord Choi Sung-gu would earn would be beyond imagination. Even 3% of that would be a staggering amount.\u201cNo, 3% is enough.\u201dIt was better not to do it at all than to be too greedy. Plus, the Giant of the Sunset wouldn\u2019t be too reluctant about 3%.\u2018The Giant of the Sunset doesn\u2019t ignore the rules. Rather, he puts high value on order and justification.\u2019Knowing that, what would happen if I conceded the \u2018Vulcan Body Tome\u2019, a magic tome of a grade that could never exist in the beginner period, and for a contract that asked for just 3% of Sung-gu\u2019s profits?\u2018Even the Giant of the Sunset would be convinced.\u2019I had created a scenario where he would have no choice but to be convinced, even if he didn\u2019t want to be. We would go and draw up a contract notarized by a notary NPC and even make a \u2018party contract\u2019 of sorts saying that Choi Sung-gu voluntarily wanted to dungeon Play with me.\u2018He won\u2019t try to kill us anymore.\u2019No, he\u00a0couldn\u2019t. That meant that the door was open to jumping into the Flame Lord Choi Sung-gu\u2019s personal scenarios, as well as taking a cut of whatever information and rewards came his way in the future.\u2018Nice.\u2019We headed to the D-Tower\u2019s 1st floor, where we received a notarization from the notary NPC \u2018Senna\u2019. The woman in her early 30s wearing a black suit and black high heels stared at us strangely.Giving Sung-gu a weird look, she said, \u201cHm. It looks to me that you really like the other person. A 3% share. An ally declaration. And it looks like you even want to do personal scenarios together.\u201dThose were the terms of the contract. We wrote it up like that on purpose. This contract showed that Choi Sung-gu was \u2018voluntarily\u2019 working with me. On the other hand, nothing about it showed that I was doing anything for him. I simply conceded the \u2018Vulcan Body Tome\u2019 he got without any fanfare.\u201cVery well. The contract has been implemented. When it is registered in the System, it will cost 1,000 Coins. Who will pay the fee? The payer will be listed as such on the contract as well.\u201dChoi Sung-gu\u2019s hand shot up. \u201cMe, me! I\u2019ll do it!\u201d He put on an air of mock severity as he looked at me. \u201cSplitting the bill, I don\u2019t like that kind of stuff. This one\u2019s absolutely on me.\u201d\u2026I had no intention of paying for it anyway, but I was still thankful.See you in ten days, friend.* * *Sunhwa and I took a taxi. Yes, even someone like me was able to ride a taxi now. During my civil service student days, I only ever rode the bus. Taxis were an extremely expensive method of transportation for my station, and there was of course no occasion that demanded riding one. It\u00a0was\u00a0pretty nice to ride one, though. There was no harassment from others, and the air conditioner was cool.We decided to go to a tonkatsu restaurant in Sinchon. On our way there, I saw the Sinchon Hyundai Department Store and the connected U-Plex building.\u2018That\u2019ll also become a dungeon.\u2019That building would be the location for the formation of a dungeon with a whopping seven floors. But the current Sinchon was overflowing with vitality. Many people who looked like university students arranged to meet there and filled the street with liveliness.\u2018The U-Plex Dungeon.\u2019It was a place I absolutely needed to clear.\u2018I should go and get used to the layout a few times before the dungeon appears.\u2019We arrived at the tonkatsu restaurant.\u201cUwah!\u201dSunhwa reacted like a starstruck kid. Her wide eyes were full of happiness. She drooled at the sight of the freshly fried tonkatsu.State: Happy / Having Fun / ExpectantHer summary even changed.Summary: Tonkatsu-Enamored Little Sister\u2018What\u2019s with these summaries all the time?\u2019Last time, it was Slight Brother Complex, and this time, it was Tonkatsu-Enamored Little Sister. There were all sorts of words you could attach to \u2018Tonkatsu-Enamored\u2019, like middle school student, human, or gourmet, but seeing as it just had to be \u2018little sister\u2019, it seemed Sunhwa herself was really clinging to the position of \u2018little sister\u2019.\u2018It does look good.\u2019The tonkatsu was piping hot. The crispy fried coating over the appropriately thick meat was shining.\u201cIt\u2019s so tasty. It\u2019s really, really tasty.\u201dI felt my mood improve a little. Sunhwa was sincerely happy right now, all because of one tonkatsu. It wasn\u2019t all that bad to see her happy face.\u201cA poor brat like you wants to eat tonkatsu? No chance in hell.\u201dShe didn\u2019t have to hear words like that anymore.\u201cThe world sure is a bitch.\u201dI didn\u2019t have to think those kinds of thoughts anymore.\u201cIs it good?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dI tousled her head once. For some reason, I just wanted to do it all of a sudden. Sunhwa stared at me for a moment like she didn\u2019t dislike it before breaking into a happy grin.\u201cYou\u2019re that happy?\u201d\u201cI am. It\u2019s good. I\u2019m so happy.\u201dOn our way home, Sunhwa gave me a confession that wasn\u2019t a confession with a reddened face.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cIt feels like I have a family now.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just a feeling, but a reality. Legally, we were family, and I thought of Sunhwa as family, too. This was a child who had put her life on the line for me. It might even be that we were more of a family than some other regular families.\u201cWe\u2019re family.\u201dSunhwa smiled brightly at that. Her eyes were glistening a little with tears, but I pretended not to notice.\u201cI\u2019ll do my best in everything, without being a bother.\u201dI gave her the lightest noogie.\u201cNo need for that. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re employed or anything.\u201dBecause that wasn\u2019t what family was. It wasn\u2019t that you had to work hard and do well in everything to be loved and cherished. You didn\u2019t have to be successful to receive love. That was what I thought. For me, a failure who hadn\u2019t accomplished anything, my mom and sister sacrificed themselves. They loved me.Through them, I learned what love and devotion was.\u2018Though I won\u2019t be able to match them in that regard\u2026\u2019Even so, since I was alive, I wanted to live like a real person.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do well in everything.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thanks for saying so.\u201dI grinned.\u201cJust one thing. Take the hits for me. Turns out getting hit by monsters is pretty painful.\u201d\u201cI-I will.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did your expression just get darker just now?\u201d\u201cI-It didn\u2019t, okay?\u201d\u201cIn that case, take a lot of hits for me. Got it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHaha. It didn\u2019t matter one whit that she looked like a small and young little sister on the outside. Since she could tank better than me, she obviously had to take the hits, even if it\u00a0did\u00a0hurt to get hit.\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine \u2018cause I\u2019m not the one getting hit anyway.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI grinned as brightly as Sunhwa had when she was eating tonkatsu earlier.\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d* * *June 23, 2018.\u2018In two weeks, a dungeon will appear in the Peace Park in Paju, Seoul.\u2019It was the hardest dungeon in the beginner grade, far more difficult than the Seoul Station Dungeon. It had produced countless casualties.\u2018And five days after that\u2026 Choi Sung-gu\u2019s personal scenario dungeon will begin.\u2019Every single day, I thought about and planned out the things I had to do, because now, I was the architect of my life.\u2018I have to clear the Peace Park, without fail.\u2019But not yet. Countless casualties would arise, but I didn\u2019t have the strength to prevent that. I had to be at least level 30 to be able to clear it.I looked through the news. A few incidents caught my eye.[Launch of the Players Association]With the conglomerate Sungshin\u2019s powerful support, the \u2018Players Association\u2019 was established. Mankind was becoming just a little more used to this changed world.[CEO Song Kiyoung elected to be the 1st Chairman of the Players Association]The president of Sungshin, Song Kiyoung, was elected as the 1st chairman of the Players Association. There were a few more incidents.[The \u2018Lion\u2019s Roar\u2019 Guild officially registers as a guild in the Players Association][The \u2018White Butterfly\u2019 Guild officially registers as a guild in the Players Association]White Butterfly had already registered, too. For reference, White Butterfly was the guild led by the future Sword Empress Shin Yeonseo.This was all stuff I knew. I had changed a few things in between, but history was flowing the way I remembered.\u2018And even in this very moment, the Demon King\u2019s out there somewhere, growing stronger.\u2019No one knew who the Demon King was. I was still unable to make a decision. If the only thing I was concerned about was my own welfare, I didn\u2019t have to butt heads with the Demon King. The 8 Heroes of Korea chose to oppose the Demon King, and two of them perished at the Demon King\u2019s hands.I shook my head.\u2018Let\u2019s not think too far ahead.\u2019For now, I would focus on the happiness right in front of me, like Sunhwa being happy over tonkatsu. In order to focus on the happiness right in front of me, I needed to stick to the things I had to do.Sunhwa and I continued to run through the Seoul Station Dungeon. We did Independent Play and earned a lot of EXP through continuous grinding.\u2018One more clear, and it\u2019ll be our 30th.\u2019We finally reached it.[You have cleared the Seoul Station Dungeon 30 times.][You have fulfilled the Hidden Piece \u201830 Seoul Station Dungeon Clears\u2019.]Good. This was why I had gone through the Seoul Station Dungeon over and over again, to get this hidden piece. This hidden piece was, like some of the others, pretty much public knowledge.\u2018But\u2014\u2019It would be different for me. I predicted that I would get another notice.\u2018As expected.\u2019My prediction was correct. More notices that weren\u2019t just about the hidden piece started to come in.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: A Real Party (2)They were the notices I\u2019d predicted.[There is a title that can be connected to the first discovery of the Hidden Piece \u201830 Seoul Station Dungeon Clears\u2019.][The title that can be connected is \u2018First Pioneer\u2019.]This was why I intentionally told So Yoohyun and Shin Yeonseo to only clear 25 rounds of the dungeon. Sharing the hidden piece was fine and all, but the \u2018first\u2019 had to be me.[Will you connect the title \u2018First Pioneer\u2019 with the Hidden Piece \u201830 Seoul Station Dungeon Clears\u2019 and trigger the linked scenario?]I went on to see what kind of scenario it was this time.If a Player with the [First Pioneer] title is the first to discover a [Hidden Piece], it is possible to trigger a linked scenario. Linked scenarios can be triggered three times.Linked Scenarios Triggered: [1/3]Linked Hidden Piece: [30 Seoul Station Dungeon Clears]Scenario: Marked increase in the difficulty/rewards of the Hidden Field within the Seoul Station Dungeon.I fell into a moment of deliberation.\u2018If it was only a marked increase in rewards\u2026\u2019Then I would have used one of my two remaining title effects, because the oft-mentioned reward from the \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon Hidden Field\u2019 was something I absolutely needed. If there was a marked increase of that reward, it would definitely be a big help to me.\u2018But the difficulty goes up as well.\u2019What should I do? It was time to make my decision.\u2018The party would be me and Sunhwa, Yoohyun and Yeonseo.\u2019The original difficulty was about the level at which this party of four could clear it. That was my objective assessment. A level at which we could clear it with everyone surviving. In other words, it wouldn\u2019t be easy.\u2018More than that would be greed.\u2019I decisively gave up on linking the title.\u2018Normally, this hidden field is supposed to appear much later.\u2019In the history before my regression, this hidden field appeared when the average level of regular Players, not Rankers, was 30. Considering that regular Players were between level 15-20 currently, its appearance had been greatly accelerated in the timeline. The levels of those of us who could be called Rankers were in their mid-to-late 20s.\u2018By the standards of 2018, the hidden field was conquered when the Rankers\u2019 levels were in their mid 30s.\u2019At first, Players had struggled a great deal. Only later, when the strategy had been figured out, did the clear rate become much higher.\u2018At our current level\u2026 This is perfect.\u2019Greed could invite disaster.\u201cOppa, are we going in again?\u201d asked Sunhwa.\u201cNo. We need to rest a bit.\u201dHer face brightened at that. It seemed the continuous runs had taken their toll on her stamina. Potions could recover one\u2019s actual stamina, but she had to have considerable mental fatigue.\u2018It\u2019s normal for your eyes to hurt and ache from just looking at your phone or computer for a long time, so\u2026\u2019We had been in a dungeon, where you had to maintain a state of tension that looking at a phone couldn\u2019t even compare to. It was only natural to feel tired as time went on. To put it in other terms, you\u2019d lose your steam.\u201cYeonseo and Yoohyun will also do their 30th clear soon. Sunhwa, you heard the notice too, yeah? About the hidden piece.\u201d\u201cI did. Ah. So that\u2019s why you told Mister Yoohyun and unnie to clear it 25 times.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dWith Yeonseo\u2019s personality, if she were told to do it 25 times, she\u2019d probably do it around 28 times. And my prediction was right on the money. Yeonseo was currently on her 29th clear, and Yoohyun on his 28th.Another day passed. Yeonseo and Yoohyun both fulfilled the hidden piece. We gathered again in front of the Seoul Station Dungeon.I believed that with this combination of four Players, the hidden field was definitely possible.[Enter the Seoul Station Dungeon?][The special condition \u201830 Seoul Station Dungeon Clears\u2019 has been satisfied.][It is possible to trigger the hidden scenario and proceed to the \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon Underground 2nd Floor\u2019.][Proceed to the \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon 2nd Underground Floor\u2019?]I turned to the others.\u201cEveryone, move to the 2nd underground floor. There might not be a safe zone, so stay on your guard.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a \u2018might not\u2019, but a certainty\u2014there was no safe zone. There was also a high chance we would be attacked as soon as we ported in.\u201cSunhwa, don\u2019t forget what I told you.\u201d\u201cYep, got it.\u201dWe did the final inspection. As long as we weren\u2019t careless, we would be able to get through this without serious injury.[Entering the \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon 2nd Underground Floor\u2019.]Like I remembered, the attack started right away.* * *Song Kiyoung, the first chairman of the Korean Players Association, as well as the president of the leading conglomerate, Sungshin, took the report he was handed.\u201cSo the Seoul Station Dungeon has been cleared almost thirty times.\u201d\u201cYes, sir. Some time has passed since the start of the police records, so\u2026 it might have even been cleared more than thirty times.\u201d\u201cMore than thirty times, you say\u2026\u201d President Song Kiyoung\u2019s eyes were serious. \u201cAnd his clear speed compared to other Players?\u201d\u201cHe is so fast it is beyond comparison. I believe he has a special strategy.\u201d\u201cAs we thought.\u201dName: Kim Hyukjin; age: 20 years old. Despite his young age, the young fellow hadn\u2019t been cowed in the least by Kiyoung\u2019s \u2018Charisma\u2019 and \u2018Pressure\u2019 and had left a very unique impression on Kiyoung.\u201cHis party members are the Tutorial Ender So Yoohyun, a young woman named Shin Yeonseo, and a child named Kim Sunhwa.\u201d\u201cI remember her.\u201dHe had put in a special word and assisted in her adoption.\u201cThe world has changed rapidly. We must walk in time with those changes.\u201dIf they didn\u2019t, they would be eliminated. Several advanced countries like the United States and Japan had already permitted Players to possess personal defense weapons. They were places where Playing using guns was possible. Naturally, their leveling speed was faster than the leveling speed of Players in Korea.\u2018The United States is said to have already reached an average level of 20.\u2019Even though Korea had started first, there was a big difference in their average level, and that gap would continue to grow.\u2018And Japan has a similar speed.\u2019Even China was the same. Their speed of growth made him feel a slight sense of crisis. Players, new tech\u2026 He didn\u2019t know how such things would change the world. Though he didn\u2019t know that, a sense of crisis that knew they couldn\u2019t afford to fall behind was welling up within him.\u201cApproach Kim Hyukjin.\u201dIf it were Sungshin, they should be able to give him a huge amount of support.\u201cAre you telling me to scout him, sir?\u201dThe President was suggesting they scout Kim Hyukjin for the guild Sungshin was preparing and planning. \u2018Taeguk Shield\u2019.TN: Taeguk is the symbol used for the Korean national flag and means \u2018the supreme ultimate\u2019 or the \u2018great duality\u2019.\u201cWhat kind of position are you considering, sir?\u201dThe assistant probed the President\u2019s intentions. The Player Kim Hyukjin was definitely out of the ordinary. There was something about him. The mere fact that he was a cohort of So Yoohyun was enough to prove that. In addition, he had also sold the \u2018hair growth solution\u2019 that was \u2018new tech\u2019 to the President for a huge profit.\u2018He will need to give him a middle manager position at the very least,\u2019 thought the assistant.So Yoohyun would probably be given the deputy position, and Sungshin would recruit a few Players who were distinguishing themselves.The guildmaster role would probably be given to the President\u2019s eldest grandson, \u2018Song Jinseok\u2019.\u201cOffer him the guildmaster position.\u201d\u201c\u2026Pardon? B-But\u2026\u201dThis was a guild receiving the powerful support of a conglomerate. The assistant thought it was only right for the guildmaster of such a guild to be Song Jinseok. The annual salary alone would be in the hundreds of thousands. He didn\u2019t think that the value of new tech and Kim Hyukjin were that much.\u201cWhat? You think the guildmaster position is excessive?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, yes.\u201dSong Kiyoung shook his head.\u201cNo.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t excessive. Kiyoung was sure of it. New tech was the future. And Kim Hyukjin had the potential to become the Player representing all of Korea at the center of the storm.\u201cIt\u2019s not excessive at all. In fact, the opportunity itself may disappear altogether with time.\u201dHe was confident in his eye for people, his capability to differentiate a jewel from a stone. Song Kiyoung believed he had that ability. And he judged Kim Hyukjin to be a jewel among jewels. It was just that he hadn\u2019t started to shine yet.\u201cI\u2019m trusting you to relay my thoughts to him faithfully.\u201d\u201cYes, sir. For Kim Hyukjin, it will be a big honor.\u201d\u201cGo.\u201d\u201cYes, President.\u201dIn the solitude of his CEO office, Kiyoung sat on his chair and visualized the future.\u2018If we can obtain Kim Hyukjin and wield him at will\u2026\u2019If the future he was imagining was correct\u2026\u2018If we can raise Taeguk Shield really well\u2026\u2019Then Sungshin would be able to take one step forward. No, it would be able to jump\u00a0ten\u00a0steps forward.\u2018Kim Hyukjin.\u2019He couldn\u2019t forget the look in that young man\u2019s eyes. He could forge him into an excellent blade.\u2018Work for Sungshin.\u2019The one doing the honing would be him,\u00a0the president of Sungshin. He was confident he could bring Hyukjin under his banner and raise him into a faithful dog for Sungshin. That was what he had always done, and that was what he was sure he could continue doing.\u2018I\u2019ll let you become my hunting dog.\u2019* * *[Entering the \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon 2nd Underground Floor\u2019.]As soon as they entered, Sunhwa used her skill. She had already heard the general strategy from Hyukjin, who had purposely picked a time when the Intermediate Administrator (Streamer) wasn\u2019t there to explain it to her. Because she trusted and relied on him completely, Sunhwa didn\u2019t pay much attention to the fact that Hyukjin knew this sort of stuff.[Using the skill Taunt.]Like the natural-born tank that she was, she could sense that she had successfully pulled the aggro even without seeing the \u2018!!!\u2019 marks. She figured out where the attack would come by feeling. This was, in every sense of the word, the influence of \u2018genius\u2019.[Using the skill Platinum Shield.]Her Platinum Shield had grown a little. It now took the fairly tangible \u2018shield\u2019 shape. Holding up her golden circular shield that glowed white, she blocked something.\u2018Urgh\u2026!\u2019Sunhwa felt quite a lot of pain in her shoulders.Plop!Something fell to the ground. With her sword aloft, Yeonseo went and checked what it was.\u201cAn arrow?\u201dThe 2nd underground floor of the Seoul Station Dungeon was a cave-type dungeon. Rough breathing noises were coming from some distance ahead in the cave.\u2018There\u2019s more than just a couple,\u2019 thought Yeonseo. She didn\u2019t have a skill like Hyukjin\u2019s \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019, but she knew there were living beings of some sort in the far corner.In a small voice, Hyukjin said, \u201cThere\u2019s a monster capable of long-ranged attacks.\u201dHe knew what this monster\u2019s identity was.\u2018Orc Archer.\u2019Actually, \u2018Orcs\u2019 were the starting point for true monsters. That was because from Orcs onward, monsters had a strong resistance to modern weapons. It was difficult to face an Orc with guns or knives that weren\u2019t items. Of course, it was a different story if you had something like a machine gun, but in any case, from Orcs onward, it was real monster territory.\u2018No matter what normal people do, they can\u2019t win.\u2019Even with the strongest monster in the Tutorial, the \u2018Lycanthrope\u2019, it was possible for a regular person to prevail if they had the strategy and modern weapons. But not with an Orc. It was impossible for a regular person to kill it with ordinary weapons.Notices came in.[You are given the 1st flash quest.][Hunt the Orc Archer first.]\u2018This is a kind of tip.\u2019Though it came in the form of a quest, the notice was basically a tip telling challengers that you had to hunt the Orc Archer first in order to clear this place. Since it was a tip, there would probably be no rewards for the quest.\u2018I see\u2026 the Orcs.\u2019They were about 170 centimetres tall and had muscles on par with Yoohyun\u2019s, grotesquely twisted faces, protruding fangs, and monstrously large mouths, from which disgusting smelling saliva dripped profusely.\u201cChwik\u2013! Chwiiik\u2013!\u201dThey could hear the sound of the monsters\u2019 rough breathing, as well as footsteps coming from a distance away.Yoohyun\u2019s brows furrowed. \u201cThey\u2019re real\u2026 monsters, hyungnim. Are we really going to square off with them right away?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dIn the meantime, Sunhwa had blocked another arrow using \u2018Platinum Shield\u2019. Her arms were trembling. Hyukjin had realized that.\u2018Two more is her limit.\u2019She couldn\u2019t keep blocking the arrows.\u201cChwik\u2013! Chwiiiiiiiiiik\u2013!\u201dThe footsteps drew nearer, and the Orcs became visible from within the darkness.Orc LVL 27It wasn\u2019t just one or two Orcs. There were close to ten of them. The closer they came, the greater the stench of their breath became, to the point that it was painful to breathe. And then, they saw two red Orcs.Orc Archer LVL 28One of them was nocking another arrow. \u2018!!!\u2019 marks were above its head. Its target was Sunhwa.\u2018Let Sunhwa take one more, and then.\u2019There was no room for mistakes. If Hyukjin slipped up, one of their crew could die.\u201cSunhwa. Block that one\u2019s arrow. And Yeonseo, follow me. Stay within three footsteps of me.\u201d\u201cWhat are you planning on doing?\u201d\u201cNo time to explain.\u201dHe purposely didn\u2019t explain to Yeonseo. There was a reason for it.\u2018From now on.\u2019They had to move organically, each person faithfully carrying out their role. If they didn\u2019t, they could all be wiped out. That was the level of danger this place posed. But you could also think about it in the reverse.\u2018We\u2019ll move as a real party.\u2019If they moved as a real party, smoothly and organically, they could kill the Orcs without taking any damage. Hyukjin was sure of it. He made a conscious decision to believe they could do it.\u2018We can do it.\u2019Ready, set\u2014The Orc Archer fired.Go!Hyukjin surged forward.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Yeonseo\u2019s AwakeningExactly when the Orc Archer fired its arrow, a path appeared through the regular Orcs protecting the Orc Archer for the slightest moment. In soccer terms, it was a very brief moment where a player could dribble straight through the defense for the goal.\u2018Here I go.\u2019Hyukjin shot forward. He didn\u2019t attempt an instantaneous approach like Flash Step.Whoosh!He felt an Orc\u2019s iron club swing towards him. It wasn\u2019t able to hit him. The Orc swung into the empty air where he had just been.\u2018From here, to the left.\u2019The current Kim Hyukjin wasn\u2019t using anything like a \u2018movement skill\u2019 or a \u2018foot technique\u2019. His movements right now were driven purely by his physical ability and reflexes.He ducked a little.Whoosh!Another iron club split the air above his head.The Orcs didn\u2019t stand idly by.\u201cChwik! Chwiiiiiik!\u201dEver so often, there were intelligent ones who could speak the human language.\u201cChwik! Eat! Eat\u2026 him! Chwiiiik!\u201dOrcs of this level could only utter words like \u2018eat\u2019, \u2018hit\u2019, or \u2018kill\u2019, but they were still creatures capable of a slight degree of communication.\u201cChwiiiiik! Eat!\u201dAt one Orc\u2019s shout, the other Orcs\u2019 gazes zoomed in on Hyukjin. They didn\u2019t really have a \u2018top dog\u2019, but they were aware that chasing prey while communicating was much more advantageous than playing on their own.Yeonseo, who was scrambling to follow Hyukjin, thought she was going to die.\u2018W-What the hell?!\u2019There wasn\u2019t even time for her to scream. She urgently bent at the waist. After bending with a slightly awkward movement, she hurled herself forward.Whoosh!A metal club embedded with sharp thorns cut through the air.\u2018If that\u2019d hit me\u2026 I would\u2019ve died.\u2019And even if she didn\u2019t, it would have given her a fairly big wound. And if she was injured in the midst of this Orc horde? It would be a death sentence.\u2018Dammit!\u2019In Yeonseo\u2019s eyes, Hyukjin was dodging like a slippery snake. He slipped through the horde with ease, finding the gaps between the Orcs like a phantom.\u2018The Orcs\u2019 reaction speed\u2026 is at least half a beat slower than him!\u2019She couldn\u2019t tell whether the Orcs were slow or Hyukjin was fast, but the result was that they couldn\u2019t hit him. Their reactions were half a beat too slow, and consequently, the attacks rained down on Yeonseo behind him.[Using the movement art Heavenly Demonic Flying Step.]Her current attainment in the Heavenly Demonic Flying Step was 1. She was merely beginning to toddle, but the Heavenly Demonic Flying Step was a movement art granted to her by the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain himself.\u2018He\u2019s going left.\u2019Which meant\u2014\u2018I need to go right here.\u2019Only then would an organic movement be possible. She was beginning to see paths that she hadn\u2019t seen before using the Heavenly Demonic Flying Step.Hyukjin\u2019s Eye of Perception caught Yeonseo\u2019s movements.\u2018She\u2019s finally started to move properly,\u2019 he thought.Orcs weren\u2019t very fast monsters. He had predicted that if he dove into their ranks, they would undoubtedly attack him half a beat slower. And Yeonseo immediately dodged those attacks, making it so that their paths of movement would collide and tangle.\u2018Yeonseo\u2026 is more than capable of confusing the Orcs.\u2019While the two of them were charging in, one of the Orc Archers nocked an arrow. Hyukjin could read the arrow\u2019s destination.\u2018Not me.\u2019It was also not Yeonseo, who was running around in the Orc horde.\u2018Sunhwa. You\u2019re doing well.\u2019He could only guess that Sunhwa was having a tough time. She was taking on successive attacks from two Orc Archers, after all. Her arms might even break. But that was fine\u2014it was better for her bones to break than to die. When Hyukjin jumped into this pack, he was also resolved to get a few broken bones somewhere.\u2018But it\u2019s\u2026 easier than I expected.\u2019He could see the paths far more easily than expected. He didn\u2019t know whether it was because of Eye of Perception or his instincts, but the way the Orcs would move, the way they would swing, how they would try to surround him, all of it was sketched out in precise clarity in his head without having to think.\u2018Did it.\u2019He had managed to approach the Orc Archer. Compared to regular Orcs, Orc Archers had much lower defense. An unprotected Archer was the perfect prey.\u2018I\u2019m killing it.\u2019[Using the special skill Excellent Strike.]Hyukjin thrust his sword into the Orc\u2019s abdomen.Squeaaaaaal!A strangled scream came bursting out. The Orc Archer dropped the bow and bent in agony.\u201cBack of the head! Pierce it!\u201dHyukjin\u2019s attack power was insufficient to kill it in one blow. But it was alright, because to his right, Yeonseo was quickly coming in from a different path.Yeonseo leapt weightlessly into the air.\u201cHaaaah!\u201dFrom top to bottom, her sword went in.Spluuuurt!The tip of the sharp sword punched through the Orc Archer\u2019s helm.Thudunk!The Orc Archer\u2019s body crumpled. Yeonseo\u2019s sword went through the back of the Orc Archer\u2019s head and into the ground.\u201cOkay! Got it!\u201dYeonseo heard a notice.[Orc Archer has been killed.][EXP acquired.][31 Coins acquired.]At exactly the same time, Hyukjin kicked Yeonseo away. Rather than saying he kicked her, he pushed her away with his foot with enough force for her to roll several times on the ground.\u201cGet it together! You wanna die after killing one?\u201dAt the place where Yeonseo had just been standing, an Orc had swung its club. If Hyukjin hadn\u2019t kicked her out of the way, Yeonseo\u2019s head would have been crushed.\u2018One more arrow.\u2019Sunhwa could only endure one more Orc Archer attack.\u2018I\u2019ll kill him while Sunhwa\u2019s got its aggro.\u2019The reason why he and Yeonseo were able to dive into the Orc horde, the reason why they could dodge and move freely through the monsters, was because the Orc Archers were only aiming for Sunhwa. Hyukjin was aware of that fact.\u2018We can do it.\u2019The Orcs were slower and Yeonseo was faster than he anticipated. He thought he would have to sacrifice his left arm or so, but it didn\u2019t look like that would be necessary.\u2018Move\u2026!\u2019Drawing in a fairly ragged breath, Hyukjin charged towards the other Orc Archer.* * *Hyukjin and Yeonseo hunted the remaining Orc Archer.[Orc Archer has been killed.][EXP acquired.][31 Coins acquired.]At the same time, a notice came in.[The clear conditions for the 1st quest have been satisfied.][The path to the next gateway will be opened.][Destroy the Clear Crystal of the 1st Gateway.]Ruuuumble!One side of the wall crumbled down, exposing a cave. The Clear Crystal was definitely within.Yoohyun had the hunch that the time for him to play his part had come.\u2018I just have to avoid fatal blows.\u2019The aggro was currently being pulled by Sunhwa, Hyukjin, and Yeonseo.\u2018Slowly. Without hurrying.\u2019If he moved too quickly, the aggro would bounce to him.\u2018One or two is fine.\u2019He wouldn\u2019t fight them himself. The moment he did so, the others would swarm towards him.\u201cChwiiik!\u201dHe felt one of the Orcs approaching him.\u2018Soon. It\u2019ll swing.\u2019That club, he would take it on, letting it land at the place where it would hurt the least. He had to keep his right arm intact just in case.\u2018Sacrifice my left arm.\u2019Yoohyun clenched his teeth hard, then blocked the club with his left shoulder.\u2018Gugh!\u2019Incredible pain assaulted him. It felt like his shoulder was breaking. Even so, he forged onwards.\u2018Did it.\u2019For a very short period after an Orc attacked, it couldn\u2019t move. After taking one attack, Yoohyun was able to enter the cave with a few more steps.[You have reached the \u2018Crystal Zone\u2019 of the 1st Gateway.]The Orcs no longer chased him. His decision-making had been good, and so had his luck. He saw a crystal exuding purple light in the depths of the cave.\u2018My right arm is still perfectly fine!\u2019He punched the crystal with his right fist. After a few successive attacks, the Clear Crystal began to crack.Thud! Thud! Thud!His fist slammed into the crystal.[The Clear Crystal of the 1st Gateway has been destroyed.]Hyukjin heard that notice as well. Yoohyun had done his part very well, even without instruction.\u2018I knew he\u2019d be able to do well even without being taught what to do.\u2019Hyukjin hadn\u2019t given a detailed explanation on purpose\u2014there was no need to make it too obvious that he knew this place already. How Yoohyun would act had been a part of Hyukjin\u2019s calculations.\u2018A destroyed shoulder can be quickly healed with potions.\u2019Yoohyun would be fine.\u201cChwik! Chwiiiik\u2013!\u201dThe grunting Orcs stiffened in place.Krrrgk\u2013krrrgk\u2013!They began to turn into stone. From the soles of their feet to their heads, they all became stone.Petrified Orc LVL 27Yeonseo\u2019s heart finally settled again.\u201cPhew. A little later, I would\u2019ve gotten hit.\u201dYeonseo crouched a little and slipped out from under the club that had become stone. As soon as she was out, she apologized to Hyukjin.\u201cSorry. For being too excited earlier.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHyukjin didn\u2019t respond. The thought that even the Sword Empress made mistakes like that in her beginner days was fresh to him. He had never thought the Sword Empress would ever let her guard down for one moment to celebrate killing an Orc Archer and nearly take a fatal blow.\u201cIf you\u2019d been hit back then, I would have been in danger, too. Do you realize that?\u201dWithout Yeonseo\u2019s assistance, it wouldn\u2019t have just been difficult to weave through the Orc horde, it would have been close to impossible to punch through the throng and kill the remaining Orc Archer.\u2018But wait, would it have really been impossible?\u2019Before coming in, he had thought that would be impossible. But after running around in the Orc horde in the flesh\u2026\u2018It might have been possible.\u2019The Orcs were slower than he expected. It was true that their attacks were dangerous, but not if you didn\u2019t get hit.Nevertheless, he put on a harsh front. Playing wasn\u2019t a joke or a game. It was an incredibly dangerous act with your life on the line.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to Play like that, go home.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know that one action of yours can endanger the rest of the party?\u201dYeonseo didn\u2019t retort back. Her shoulders slumped. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be more careful.\u201dWhile they were talking, Yoohyun came over and started destroying the Orcs that had become statues. Blunt weapons or fist attacks were most effective against petrified monsters. Yoohyun was doing his role well. At that sight, Yeonseo clenched her fists hard.\u2018Only I did poorly here.\u2019Even the young Sunhwa carried out her task well, and the big Yoohyun did what he was supposed to do. That went without saying for Hyukjin.\u2018I can\u2019t go on like this.\u2019It wasn\u2019t like she had some clear goal. Rather, she was crushed by the pressure she felt when she realized that everyone here could have died because of one mistake from her. She was incredibly scared when she thought of that possibility.\u2018Get your head on straight, Yeonseo.\u2019The moment monsters appeared and the world changed, Yeonseo made a vow. A vow to safeguard at least her family and friends from danger. To protect the people who were precious to her without fail. That was what she swore.\u2018I\u2019ll do well.\u2019A small drop created a big ripple in her heart. If her heart was a lake, then a large wave was beginning to spread out on the surface of the water.\u2018I have to become stronger.\u2019She absolutely had to become stronger. She couldn\u2019t become a burden. At least right now, at this very moment, the moment when she made a mistake, a burning desire to \u2018become stronger\u2019 took root in her heart. That wish blazed brightly within her. She ended up comparing herself to Hyukjin.\u2018At least as much as Hyukjin.\u2019Strong enough that she wouldn\u2019t be a burden. Strong enough to repay her debt to him for saving her mom. She had to at least become that strong.At the same time, she heard a stream of notices.[The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 has perceived your burning desire.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 responds to your burning desire.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 extends a hand to you.]Yeonseo wasn\u2019t the only one hearing the special notices.\u201c\u2026\u201dHyukjin, who was about to scold Yeonseo further, was stunned into speechlessness. On the 2nd underground floor of the Seoul Station Dungeon, yet another new notice rang in Hyukjin\u2019s ears, a notice that hadn\u2019t existed in previous raids.\u2018This sort of thing\u2026 was possible?\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: Yeonseo\u2019s Awakening (2)Notices came in.[The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 extends a hand to you.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 wishes to offer you a special proposal.]The True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain, the Sword Empress Shin Yeonseo\u2019s reliable Guardian. This Guardian went so far as to use the adjective \u2018special\u2019 to offer me a proposal.\u2018What could it be?\u2019[The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 offers you the \u2018Heavenly Demon\u2019 title.][If you accept the title, your advancement will automatically occur.]I could only doubt my ears.\u2018Advancement due to a title?\u2019Advancement through a contract with a Guardian typically happened at level 30. I wasn\u2019t level 30 yet, but the True Master wanted to make me \u2018advance\u2019 using a \u2018title effect\u2019 as a bypass?\u2018And it\u2019s a title with a Guardian\u2019s name in it.\u2019That implied a lot.\u2018A Guardian who thinks he\u2019s the best in the world and is very weak to praise and flattery.\u2019That was the evaluation the world had of the \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019, though of course no one dared to say that outright.\u2018But seeing as a Guardian like that wants to bestow a title with his name in it using an expedient, it must be an incredible title.\u2019It could even be\u2026\u2018A title that the former Sword Empress got.\u2019Since it was a title given in the beginner period, it was definitely capable of growth. The higher one\u2019s attainment, the stronger the title\u2019s effects would become.[The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 says frankly that Heavenly Demons have a \u2018I am my own Lord throughout heaven and earth\u2019 temperament.]Simply put, he was bragging that the \u2018Heavenly Demon\u2019 title was a really amazing title.\u2018I think this is probably a special title granted to only one person\u2026\u2019Then what would happen to the Sword Empress?\u2018Do I take it, or not?\u2019It might be an unfortunate development for Yeonseo, but it could also be a truly huge opportunity for me. The True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain was trying to persuade me to advance, shouting \u2018I am my own Lord throughout heaven and earth\u2019 and offering me a title bearing his name. Of course it was a good thing for me.\u2018Since he even ignored the level 30 advancement rule and went this far, he\u2019s certainly a powerful Guardian.\u2019There was no doubt about that. It was such a big opportunity for me that I had to seriously contemplate whether I should accept it or not.\u2018No.\u2019I couldn\u2019t accept it.\u2018The Sword Empress Shin Yeonseo.\u2019The Sword Empress I knew was truly strong. She was said to be the strongest in 1 vs. 1 PVP. But even so, her limitations were clear.\u2018Only by gathering all 8 Heroes of Korea were they able to confront the Demon King and his army.\u2019If the \u2018Demon King\u2019 was the object of comparison, then the class the Sword Empress had possessed definitely had its limitations.\u2018Since I\u2019ve somehow returned to the past\u2026\u2019I had to become someone greater than the Sword Empress. I was given this chance, so I decided to do my utmost. I didn\u2019t want to limit myself to being a \u2018Sword Emperor\u2019 or \u2018the strongest in 1 vs. 1 PVP\u2019.I made my decision.\u2018The True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2026\u2019Wasn\u2019t that petty of a Guardian. Meaning, even if I rejected his active offer of sponsorship, he wouldn\u2019t harangue me afterwards.\u2018I refuse.\u2019Notices came in instantly.[The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 is greatly disappointed.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 feels great regret.]Thankfully, his reaction stopped at disappointment. Petty Guardians sometimes went and declared a Player as their \u2018enemy\u2019. When they did so, there was probably an accompanying notice saying that the Guardian was \u2018greatly enraged\u2019.\u201cYeonseo, didn\u2019t you also get a notice?\u201d I said intentionally.\u201cYeah, I did. You got one too?\u201dShe was really naive. A seasoned Player would have hidden such an occurrence from me. What kind of contract a Guardian had offered her, what kind of title or abilities they were Playing with, all of that was a kind of strategic asset.\u2018She\u2019s so naive.\u2019The Sword Empress in her beginner days was extremely naive. Even without psychological warfare or trades, she blathered a stream of information on her own initiative.\u201cIt said he responds to my burning desire.\u201d\u201cBurning desire?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2026\u201d After a moment of silence, she continued. \u201c\u2026want to get stronger.\u201dSo she was saying she had a burning desire to get stronger. I understood that desire, because even I wanted to get stronger, right this moment. Later on, people judged \u2018burning desire to become stronger\u2019 in itself as a part of one\u2019s talent.\u2018Of course the future Sword Empress would want to become stronger.\u2019The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 had reacted to that desire.\u201cThe True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain offered me an advancement.\u201d\u201cI thought he would.\u201d\u201cEh? Really? You predicted this? How did you know? Did you also get a notice?\u201dOf course I hadn\u2019t predicted it\u2014this girl was just coming to her own conclusions. Everything she said were things that others wouldn\u2019t have ever known if she hadn\u2019t said them herself.\u2018So she definitely got an advancement notice.\u2019The Heavenly Demon had offered advancement to two people simultaneously, and before level 30. He certainly seemed powerful.\u2018He offered me the Heavenly Demon title, but\u2026\u2019There was a high chance that it was a unique title, which meant that it was highly likely the True Master offered Yeonseo a title of a lower grade.\u2018That won\u2019t do.\u2019Yeonseo was a teammate I would be working with hand in hand. She might be inexperienced and unreliable right now, but there was a big chance she would become one of the heroes representing Korea.\u2018How can I manipulate the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain?\u2019I couldn\u2019t lie. Spouting obvious lies to Guardians was a suicidal act.\u2018I have to make him give her the Heavenly Demon title.\u2019After thinking, I said, \u201cHe gave me very good advancement conditions, too. But I rejected it.\u201d\u201cEh? Why? Why? Is this actually not a good thing? Should I not agree to this?\u201dThankfully, it didn\u2019t look like she chose \u2018YES\u2019 yet.\u201cI thought it was really good. It\u2019s not? Tell me.\u201dMmhm. I didn\u2019t know what exactly she was offered, but it couldn\u2019t be as good as Heavenly Demon.\u201cOf course it\u2019s really good.\u201d\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you accept?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019ve got a relatively clear idea of what my playstyle is.\u201dMy playstyle was currently something close to an all-rounder Player. I could go into most classes. But out of all those classes, the one that could fully bring out all of my strength right now was a class similar to a \u2018sovereign\u2019.\u201cUsing my knowledge and intuition to make party Playing go smoothly.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201dYeonseo\u2019s expression was one of slight doubt. It was understandable, since I had gone for the Orc Archer with more efficient movements than her.* * *\u201cJust now, without you, Sunhwa, or Yoohyun, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to clear this place.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a lie. The True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain was probably listening seriously to my words as well.\u201cIn other words, I have an aptitude for determining the traits and uses of each Player and putting each Player in the right place.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019re more suited to be a leader, yeah?\u201d Yeonseo nodded in understanding. \u201cYeah, I did think that while seeing you Play. You move like someone who knows all the strats.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way that could be true, right?\u201dExcept there was. I knew all the strategies. But even if I didn\u2019t, it almost felt like I knew them instinctively. Somehow, it felt like I had that kind of talent. Doing this here, and that there, that intuition came to me automatically, though I didn\u2019t know if it was because of my talent or because of Eye of Perception.\u2018Since Eye of Perception is an innate ability, can you call it talent?\u2019Well, whatever.\u201cYou can just think of it as a special talent of mine. The ability to determine a person\u2019s abilities and direct them appropriately.\u201d\u201cI think I get what you\u2019re saying. I definitely feel like the path is clear when I move according to your words.\u201d\u201cI probably have a better understanding of you than you yourself.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a lie. After all, this girl had no idea that she had the qualities to become the future Sword Empress.\u201cYou do?\u201d\u201cAt least in swordsmanship, your dormant potential is way higher than mine.\u201d\u201cReally? You think so?\u201dI didn\u2019t know whether that was true or not, but it was hardly a blatant lie. It also sounded quite truthful.\u201cI trust my eyes.\u201d\u201cHm. I see.\u201dYou listening, True Master? This conversation is actually not between me and Yeonseo, but me and you. Are you really going to leave such a big treasure?\u201cYeah. It\u2019s hard to describe it in detail. It\u2019s something that only the special eyes I have can pick up on. If I hadn\u2019t been observing you right here in person, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to see your dormant potential.\u201dBasically, I was saying, \u2018You Guardians watching from above probably can\u2019t see this girl\u2019s true value\u2019.\u201cYou were observing me that closely?\u201dWhy was her face getting all red for no good reason?\u201cYeah. Because your dormant potential is huge.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you thought so highly of me.\u201dState: Embarrassed / Shy / ExpectantWait a sec, what was she expecting here? Why was \u2018expectant\u2019 in her state? I really couldn\u2019t figure out what Yeonseo was thinking. Was I unable to understand the 20-year-old Yeonseo because I was a 30-year-old bachelor on the inside?\u201cYou really mean it?\u201d\u201cYeah. I think that the things I can do well and the things you can do well are different.\u201d\u201cHm, hm.\u201dYeonseo seemed a little happier than before. The carrot had to taste all the better after getting the stick.\u201cThat\u2019s why I thought that the honorable title the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain was offering me would suit you better.\u201dAn honorable title.\u00a0Hey, Heavenly Demon. I really want that title too, dearest True Master. But sigh, there\u2019s no helping it. It\u2019ll suit this girl better, you know? You\u2019ll want to give it to her, you know? She\u2019ll be better than me, you know? She\u2019s a real genius.\u201cThat\u2019s why I refused. Because I judged that you could make that honorable title shine more than me.\u201dAs I expected, the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain was paying close attention to my words.[The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 is pleased by your words.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 praises your insight.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 praises you.]I decided to give a little more lip service.\u201cIf you were to become the exclusive holder of the title that I almost got, I\u2019m sure you could make that title shine brighter than anyone. It\u2019s my belief that you could even become the most famous Player in the world.\u201dYeonseo\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course. Because a great Guardian like the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain offered an advancement through a title in person.\u201dTrue Master, you\u2019re listening, right? And all the other Guardians, you\u2019re listening, yeah? Can\u2019t you see that the \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 just used a trick to try and recruit us? You guys should step it up.\u2018The other Guardians will definitely take action now.\u2019That was why I intentionally uttered \u2018advancement through a title\u2019.\u2018With this, he\u2019ll have no choice but to give Yeonseo the Heavenly Demon title.\u2019Since it was already exposed that he had played a cowardly(?) trick, if he didn\u2019t settle this properly, Guardians like the \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019, who valued justice and impartiality, would strongly complain.\u2018I saved his face, justified my reason for refusing, told him she has a huge amount of dormant potential, and plus, his back is to the wall.\u2019In the end, the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain would grant Yeonseo the \u2018Heavenly Demon\u2019 title. Sure enough\u2014\u201cHyukjin. I\u2019ve advanced.\u201dJust in case this silly girl blathered more personal information, I blocked her mouth with my hand.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to give every little detail about your personal information. Even to me or your party members.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cGot it? If you understand, I\u2019m taking my hand off, alright?\u201dYeonseo nodded, and her state was updated.State: Shy / Expectant / AflutterIt became even more incomprehensible. Where in the world was she getting this \u2018aflutter\u2019 feeling from?[The valid time of the 1st Gateway has run out.][You will be automatically sent to the 2nd Gateway.]When we were sent to the 2nd Gateway, I found myself in a completely different \u20182nd Gateway\u2019 than the one I remembered.\u2018Goddammit\u2026\u2019I had a feeling I knew what this was.\u2018Why is this happening\u00a0now?\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: Great Orc Warrior[Entering the 2nd Gateway, \u2018Village of the Orc Warrior\u2019.]That much was fine, but\u2014[The 2nd Gateway\u2019s scenario, \u2018Village of the Orc Warrior\u2019, has been partially altered.]The scenario was suddenly altered, and I knew why.\u2018This is conclusive proof that the True Master gave Yeonseo the Heavenly Demon title.\u2019Nothing in life was 100% good. He had forcefully given Yeonseo something so good that it changed the contents of the gateway. It was only natural that there would be a counterreaction.\u2018The True Master didn\u2019t break the rules.\u2019When a Guardian actively interfered with a Player\u2019s Playing in such a manner, something would happen to counterbalance it. The True Master likely knew that as well.\u2018What changed, and how?\u2019Whatever it was, it was definitely not a good thing for us.[The perk of the 2nd Gateway, \u2018Orc Warrior becomes stone when the crystal is destroyed\u2019, has been removed.]As long as we destroyed the crystal, the \u2018Orc Warrior\u2019 that was this gateway\u2019s boss monster would turn into stone. But now, that would no longer happen. This alone dramatically increased the difficulty.And it didn\u2019t end there.[The grade increase restriction of the \u2018Orc Warrior\u2019 in the 2nd Gateway scenario has been removed.][You are given the 2nd Gateway\u2019s scenario quest, \u2018Kill the Orc Warrior\u2019.]The Orc Warrior was a monster that would grow stronger the longer you fought it. Since we were in a beginner-grade area, its growth was limited to \u2018Advanced Orc Warrior\u2019.\u2018If the grade increase restriction has been removed\u2026 that means it can become an Orc Warrior of a higher grade.\u2019I mentally sifted through a lot of information.\u2018With the conditions of this place, it can\u2019t evolve all the way into a High Orc.\u2019To begin with, High Orcs and regular Orcs were like apples and oranges\u2014they were on completely different levels. If a High Orc showed up here, we would all be annihilated, 100%, no question about it.\u2018If I connect the 2nd Gateway\u2019s perk and the current situation\u2026\u2019Then it was possible to deduce a rough estimate of how strong the Orc Warrior could become.\u2018It\u2019ll evolve to a Great Orc Warrior.\u2019Starting from the Great Orc Warrior, there was a wide variation in the levels of individual monsters of the same species, but they were typically around level 37. The higher level ones were even level 40. Such an opponent was, of course, impossible for us to face with our current strength.\u2018Dammit.\u2019The scenario hadn\u2019t started in full force yet. We were currently in the safe zone, but even this safe zone would soon disappear.\u2018What do we do?\u2019I had to think and figure out a strategy to clear this place.\u2018Is there\u2026 nothing we can do?\u2019Right at this moment, it seemed like there was no way forward.We were in the 2nd Gateway, called the \u2018Village of the Orc Warrior\u2019. It was a grassland field, and I could see tents built in a messy cluster in the distance. It was more likely that the orcs had picked them up and were using tents that someone had made rather than making the tents themselves. Metal stakes of various lengths were scattered on the ground around us.[The 2nd Gateway scenario quest, \u2018Kill the Orc Warrior\u2019, has begun.][If you are unable to destroy the 3 Crystals within the set time, Orc Archers will spawn.][Remaining time\u2013 10:00]This was the original content of the 2nd Gateway. I already knew where all of the crystals were.\u2018If we can\u2019t break three crystals within 10 minutes, three Orc Archers will spawn.\u2019I bent to pick up a few stakes.\u2018A key item.\u2019These stakes looked unrelated, but they were definitely items you could acquire, important items.Yeonseo asked, \u201cBoss. What do we do? Should we start by splitting up and looking for the crystals?\u201dI nodded.\u201cYou saw the way the Orcs moved earlier, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. I think I can dodge them. Some way or another.\u201dI had to think hard for a moment. I already knew where the crystals were. The Orcs were still in their tents and hadn\u2019t shown themselves yet, but normal Orcs would soon swarm.\u2018If there\u2019s an Orc horde with Orc Archers in it\u2026 and an Orc Warrior shows up on top of that, clearing this will be impossible.\u2019We absolutely needed to block the appearance of Orc Archers, even if we took some damage to achieve it. I had to calculate my actions well. It would be troublesome if it looked like I obviously knew where the crystals were on the stream.\u2018In that case\u2026\u2019I would use the most basic method, looking for them one by one.\u201cYou see that tent in the distance with the flag flying high? We\u2019ll search with that point as the center.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d\u201cStart at the very right from that point and look for the crystals while moving towards the center.\u201d\u201cAnd don\u2019t fight the Orcs?\u201d\u201cYeah. Avoid contact as much as possible. The crystals come first and foremost.\u201d\u201cRighto.\u201dYeonseo set off first. A hazy black energy was wisping off her legs, as if she were using a special movement technique.\u2018It\u2019s probably the Heavenly Demonic Flying Step.\u2019There was a high chance it was the 1st stage of the Heavenly Demonic Flying Step.\u201cSunhwa and Yoohyun, you two take the other side. Move from the very left towards the middle together.\u201dThey immediately understood. Yoohyun had slightly lower agility and speed. That meant he couldn\u2019t swiftly weave through the enemies like Yeonseo. They would have to take on a few attacks, which Sunhwa would block.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, hyungnim.\u201dWith this method, we would be able to destroy two crystals within ten minutes, no problem.\u2018I have to break the last one, but\u2026\u2019That last crystal was inside the central tent. The problem was that the \u2018Orc Warrior\u2019 was surely sleeping within that tent.\u2018If I go inside, it\u2019ll probably start attacking.\u2019Originally, I was planning on having Yeonseo pull the aggro while I went in to destroy the crystal, and that would be a wrap.\u2018Because as long as we destroy the crystal, the Orc Warrior would turn into stone.\u2019But now, that benefit was gone.We were now in a situation where we had to kill the Orc Warrior anyway. I was still unsure. Could we really kill it?\u2018If we can\u2019t, then I just have to make it happen.\u2019My head couldn\u2019t come up with a method to kill it, but when I actually went into the central tent and had a look for myself, I had a flash of inspiration.\u2018We can do it.\u2019I heard two notices.[1 Crystal has been destroyed.][Destroy the Crystals: \u2153 complete.]\u2018Must be Yeonseo.\u2019Yeonseo would join me soon. Yoohyun and Sunhwa would take a little longer.Yeonseo came running over with a slightly brighter expression.\u201cI destroyed a crystal. The Orcs were chasing me, but looks like they gave up in the end.\u201dOrcs were slow. They couldn\u2019t keep up with Yeonseo. As long as the aggro was weak, they would stop chasing her once she got a certain distance away from them.\u201cWell done.\u201d\u201cDid I really do good?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI examined the inside of the tent very carefully, finding a purple crystal and a snoring \u2018Orc Warrior\u2019. There were also regular Orcs napping around the Orc Warrior.I explained the method I came up with to Yeonseo.\u201cListen up.\u201dA cloud of dust was being kicked up. An Orc horde came running this way.\u201cChwik\u2013! Chwiiiiiik\u2013!\u201dUnlike Yeonseo, who had properly shaken off the Orcs, Yoohyun and Sunhwa had a good ten or so Orcs hot on their tails.Yeonseo wasn\u2019t surprised. That was because she had already heard this would happen from Hyukjin.\u201cThose two will definitely pull Orcs this way. They\u2019re not as fast as you, after all.\u201dHyukjin shouted, \u201cYoohyun, Sunhwa. Just get in the Orc horde and keep their aggro on you!\u201dTo make it easy for each party member to understand, I instructed them separately.\u201cIn the meantime, Yeonseo, you attack them one by one. Keep the aggro on Sunhwa!\u201dYoohyun and Sunhwa understood exactly what they had to do.\u201cI think we have to keep moving together, Mister.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dOtherwise, both of them would die. They had to work together. That was the only way they could survive while effectively stirring up the Orc horde. As they did so, Yeonseo started attacking them one by one. Her movements were indeed swift and precise.Splurt!Yeonseo\u2019s sword pierced an Orc\u2019s throat, severing what would be the carotid artery for a human. Blood gushed out of the Orc\u2019s neck.\u2018I did it.\u2019Her goal was not this Orc\u2019s death. She carried out Hyukjin\u2019s orders to the letter.\u201cWhen you attack the Orcs, killing them isn\u2019t the goal. Make them bleed.\u201d\u2018Next!\u2019A wound of this level was more than enough.[Using the skill Swift Strike.]With a strike 1.2x faster than a regular attack, Yeonseo\u2019s sword pierced another Orc\u2019s neck, causing another stream of blood to fountain out. Yeonseo was covered in the spray as well. As she stood there, covered in dark red blood, she almost looked like a yaksha from hell.\u2018Next.\u2019Three, four, five Orcs. She aimed for the same spot every time, and successfully struck the same spot every time.\u201cHah\u2026 hah\u2026\u201dLittle by little, her breath became labored. Even though she wasn\u2019t completely killing them and was only wounding them, fighting a whopping five Orcs at once was no easy feat.Sunhwa jumped in front of her.\u201cUnnie! Watch out!\u201d[Using the skill Platinum Shield.]Clang!With a loud clang, Sunhwa heard a \u2018cra-crack!\u2019 sound from within her body.\u201cUrgh\u2026!\u201dHer left arm hung limply. Her body was unable to handle the impact, and her shoulder was in pieces.While that was going on outside, Hyukjin approached the crystal.\u2018Getting to it immediately will be tough.\u2019The chaos outside was rousing the sleeping Orcs. The Orc Warrior opened its eyes as well.\u2018I can\u2019t make a straight line to the crystal.\u2019He couldn\u2019t see a route there. From now on, Hyukjin would have to fight the Orcs and \u2018Orc Warrior\u2019 simultaneously, with no hope of support or help.\u2018I have to kill them.\u2019Even if he broke the crystal, they would remain alive.\u2018Starting with this guy.\u2019He lowered his body a little and approached one Orc with a speed that matched Yeonseo\u2019s while she was using \u2018Heavenly Demonic Flying Step\u2019. Then, his sharp blade aimed for the Orc\u2019s throat with a precision that rivaled Yeonseo\u2019s.\u201cChwiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiik!!\u201dBlood surged out of the Orc\u2019s neck as it screamed. Hyukjin jumped back immediately after leaving the big wound. He couldn\u2019t brute force it and charge straight in.A single mistake could be the difference between life and death. If he were to take a blow from the Orc Warrior\u2019s huge club right now\u2026\u2018Would I even be able to survive one hit?\u2019Even that was uncertain. If he was unlucky and was injured, he would be surrounded by the Orcs in seconds. He could easily become the hunted instead of the hunter.Hyukjin filled his lungs and yelled, \u201cCome in!\u201dYeonseo, Yoohyun, and Sunhwa, who had been fighting the Orcs near the tent, immediately ran inside. The injured Orcs thumped and clunked in after them. In mere moments, the \u2018Orc Warrior\u2019s tent\u2019 was thrown into total chaos.\u201cChwik\u2013chwiiik!\u201d\u201cChwiiik! Chwik! Chwik!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that wide of a space, and nearly ten Orcs crammed themselves in. The Orcs\u2019 characteristic rotten stench and metallic reek of blood filled the space. In just moments, the inside of the tent was hot with fervor.And then, something shocking began to happen. Yeonseo\u2019s jaw dropped.\u2018Hyukjin\u2019s words\u2026 were true!\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: Great Orc Warrior (2)The Orc Warrior stood up, its nostrils flaring. Its body was nearly twice the size of regular Orcs.\u201cChwik?\u201dIt smelled like something delicious\u2026 the smell of blood.\u201cChwiiiiiiiik!!\u201dThe Orc Warrior\u2019s eyes turned red. It didn\u2019t see that the ones bleeding were fellow Orcs and became completely intoxicated by the smell of blood.Hyukjin confirmed that the Orc Warrior\u2019s eyes had changed.\u2018It worked.\u2019The Orc Warrior was weak to the smell of blood. With this much, it would instantly go completely bonkers. Now, it would start hunting its allies like a train running off its tracks.Cruuuunch!The Orc Warrior ripped off an Orc\u2019s arm and chomped it down whole, crunching down on bone.\u201cSqueaaaaaaaal!\u201dIts hapless victim squealed. The Orc Warrior grabbed it at the waist and began to consume it, chomping and munching from the head down.Completely intoxicated by the smell of blood, the Orc Warrior became even more fevered.Delicious things!Delicious things!Delicious things!Only one thought, \u2018prey\u2019, dominated the Orc Warrior\u2019s instincts.The Orc Warrior roared, dark red blood flying out of its mouth. The Orcs began to flee in terror.\u201cChwiiiiiik!\u201dA notice came in at the same time.[The Orc Warrior\u2019s innate ability, \u2018Orc Fear\u2019, has been triggered.]Hyukjin grinned.\u2018There it is. Orc Fear.\u2019Actually, this wasn\u2019t an Orc Warrior-exclusive innate ability. It was a technique most \u2018boss monsters\u2019 had.\u2018Normally, it\u2019s an ability that freezes Players or makes them unable to flee.\u2019But not right now.\u2018Right now, it\u2019s to prevent the escape of its delicious prey, the Orcs.\u2019This \u2018Orc Fear\u2019 wasn\u2019t aimed at them, the Players, but at the fleeing Orcs. As a result, Hyukjin and the others weren\u2019t greatly affected.\u2018And\u2026 the Orc Warrior isn\u2019t a super high level boss monster.\u2019He didn\u2019t know for sure, but he believed it was very unlikely that the Orc Warrior would use its fear move again. It probably had an extremely long cooldown. With the really high ranked monsters, they would fire fear at random and make things difficult for Players. But not the Orc Warrior.\u2018The cooldown being extremely long basically means that its innate ability has been used up.\u2019In that case, it would be much easier to face from now on.\u201cSqueaaaaaal!\u201dThe Orcs became sacrifices to the Orc Warrior. The great beast chomped down Orcs as soon as it could grab them, as if the word \u2018satiety\u2019 did not exist in its book.[The Orc Warrior has evolved into an \u2018Advanced Orc Warrior\u2019.]Breathing hard, Yeonseo asked Hyukjin, \u201cCan we really leave it be? Even though its body got bigger?\u201dIt was already a hulking lump, but it became even bigger.\u201cHyungnim. The definition of its muscles has become crazy high. I think it\u2019s gotten a lot stronger.\u201dHyukjin nodded.\u201cFighting one Advanced Orc Warrior is better\u2026 than fighting the Orc Warrior and its horde of Orcs. At least for us.\u201dThe choice he had made was to fight one general rather than hundreds of soldiers. That was Hyukjin\u2019s choice\u2014to fight one strong being rather than a multitude of weak ones.\u2018This method is our path to survival.\u2019He also knew its limits. It couldn\u2019t grow all the way to a High Orc anyway. If it stopped here, that would be great, but even if it grew a little more, it would stop at a \u2018Great Orc Warrior\u2019.\u2018It\u2019s going to be dangerous anyway, so\u2026 it\u2019d be fine to evolve into a Great Orc Warrior, at least\u2026\u2019The perceived difficulty would be similar. Both the Advanced and Great Orc Warrior were monsters that he and his party members couldn\u2019t defeat at their current level without knowing the strategy, anyway. Both of them were strong. The perceived difficulty would be similar, but the quality of the items they dropped would be completely different. Since things had come to this, Hyukjin thought it would be good if it evolved into a Great Orc Warrior.Cruuuuunch!The now Advanced Orc Warrior was in a frenzy to murder and consume its allies. It ate yet another Orc, bones and all.It didn\u2019t show the slightest interest in the Players, Hyukjin and his party members. That was because the delicious scent\u2014the smell of blood\u2014was exceedingly weak on them.\u201cSqueaaaaaaaal!\u201dInside the tent, the last Orc disappeared inside the Advanced Orc Warrior\u2019s belly.[The Advanced Orc Warrior has evolved into a \u2018Great Orc Warrior\u2019.]It finally seemed full. Only then did the Great Orc Warrior begin to have an interest in the Players.[A flash quest, \u2018Kill the Great Orc Warrior\u2019, has been triggered.][Kill the Great Orc Warrior]Kill the Great Orc Warrior. You cannot kill the Great Orc Warrior with your current abilities alone. However, the Courageous Lion King will watch over your courage and guts.Quest reward: Special ability \u2018Mettle\u2019It wasn\u2019t a quest given to just Hyukjin. Yoohyun, Yeonseo, and Sunhwa got it as well.\u2018Mettle.\u2019Mettle: A person\u2019s grit and resilience in dealing with difficulties, no matter what they were.\u2018This\u2026 came out here?\u2019There were a great number of ways you could acquire this ability. Hyukjin had also written up a plan to acquire Mettle, because it was one of the key abilities for Rankers. If you had Mettle, your resistance to mental attacks became much higher, and it would negate a good portion of boss monster fears.\u2018\u2026I have to do it.\u2019It was unexpected, but he was happy about it.\u2018How unusual that the damned courage-lover is being helpful for once.\u2019In any case, he could earn Mettle with this.\u2018As long as I can kill that monster, that is.\u2019Raids were always one or the other. It came down to whether the foe died, or you did. Whether the monster died, or the Player did. It would only end with one or the other.\u2018It\u2019s big.\u2019It was about 3 meters tall, so enormous that it made even the giant Yoohyun look small. Yoohyun and Yeonseo stood on either side of Hyukjin, and Sunhwa stood right in front of him.\u201cBoss. Hyukjin. This\u2026 is gonna be fine, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHyukjin didn\u2019t know.\u201cWe have to hope that our plan worked.\u201dIf it didn\u2019t? Then they would die here. There was no other way. In this scenario, which had changed because of the \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019, there was no other way for them to survive.Yeonseo regripped her sword. A bead of sweat ran down her forehead, traveling over her cheeks and down her nape. She stared at the \u2018Great Orc Warrior\u2019 with a piercing intensity. It wasn\u2019t making any real movements yet. This was the calm before the storm, the moment before two forces collided.Thump!Thump!Her heart trembled. Yeonseo kept her nerves stretched taut.\u2018At least\u2026\u2019The good thing was that the current situation was perfectly in line with what Hyukjin had schemed.\u2018Hyukjin created this situation.\u2019This was definitely the desired outcome of Hyukjin\u2019s tactic.Hyukjin said, \u201cI\u2019m going in.\u201d\u201cOppa. Won\u2019t it be better for me to go in? I\u2019m sturdier.\u201dHyukjin chuckled. \u201cBeing sturdy means nothing. One hit, and it\u2019ll be over, anyway. The level indication shows up as question marks to me.\u201dThe Great Orc Warrior\u2019s level was around 37. Sunhwa as she was now would not be able to block a single hit from such a monster.\u201cSo it\u2019s better for me to go, since I have a slight chance of being able to dodge.\u201dHyukjin moved forward.\u2018Did it really\u2026 work?\u2019Seeing as the Great Orc Warrior hadn\u2019t moved this whole time, it did look like their plan worked, somewhat.\u2018It ate a lot in a hurry, so its stomach must be very bloated.\u2019And most likely\u2026\u2018The Mutant Wolf\u2019s Fang should have taken effect.\u2019The Mutant Wolf\u2019s Fang was an item Hyukjin had steadily collected ever since the Tutorial. It was also essentially the first item he acquired in the Tutorial Field.[Mutant Wolf\u2019s Fang]The fang of the poisonous Mutant Wolf. It possesses a fatal \u2018paralyzation poison\u2019.The Orc Warrior had swallowed the Orcs whole. Hyukjin knew that it would do so in advance and had embedded \u2018Mutant Wolf\u2019s Fangs\u2019 all over on the Orcs\u2019 bodies. The reason why they left the Orcs alive, why they pulled them all the way into the tent, and why they made the Orc Warrior eat the Orcs was all for this outcome.\u201cHyungnim. Will that really have an effect?\u201d\u2018A few wouldn\u2019t have made any difference.\u2019He drew even closer to the Great Orc Warrior.\u2018But this guy swallowed at least seventy fangs.\u2019He didn\u2019t expect the fangs to be able to completely paralyze the monster. Mutant Wolf\u2019s Fangs were unable to completely paralyze a Great Orc Warrior, of all things.\u2018But\u2014\u2019They could greatly slow down the monster\u2019s movements. Hyukjin slightly lowered his center of gravity.The Great Orc Warrior saw a Player coming near it. For some reason, its body felt sluggish, but it was fine. That puny human was nothing\u2014one bite, and it would be over. The Great Orc Warrior did not feel much danger.Hyukjin used the special skill \u2018Flash Step\u2019 by title switching. The monster ahead would be unable to react to his speed.Whoosh\u2013!The Great Orc Warrior swung its massive, 1-meter large club.\u2018It\u2019s faster than I thought.\u2019The Great Orc Warrior reacted a little to Flash Step. It was definitely a high-level monster.\u2018But this much, I can manage.\u2019It was only a little faster than he expected, not something he couldn\u2019t handle. Hyukjin whipped around to the back of the Great Orc Warrior using Flash Step.\u201cYeonseo!\u201dGiving a signal to Yeonseo, Hyukjin swung his sword at the Achilles tendon of the Great Orc Warrior.The monster raised its left foot, as if it had eyes on the back of its head. Then, it whirled rapidly around. Despite suffering from the effects of paralyzation poison, it evaded Hyukjin\u2019s attack very easily.In the meantime, Yeonseo used Heavenly Demonic Flying Step to get close.\u2018That guy is aiming for Hyukjin.\u2019Its back was unguarded.\u2018My goal is the ribs.\u2019She couldn\u2019t deal a fatal blow in one hit. They had to pare down the monster\u2019s health little by little.\u2018Here I go!\u2019But just then, the Great Orc Warrior swung down its arm.Clang!Its arm blocked Yeonseo\u2019s sword. Even though it wasn\u2019t wearing armor, the sound was like steel meeting steel.\u2018How can its body be so sturdy?\u2019That meant at Yeonseo\u2019s current level and attack power, she was unable to penetrate the monster\u2019s skin, especially the tough skin of its arm.Hyukjin saw it all.\u2018The look in its eyes has changed.\u2019Those were not the eyes of prey being hunted. The beast in front was full of confidence. The Great Orc Warrior was convinced that it was the predator here. Even though its body didn\u2019t move as it wanted, it could catch and swallow these measly humans no problem. Those were the thoughts Hyukjin saw in its eyes.\u2018The eyes of a predator.\u2019He had been waiting for this very moment. They would only have one chance. In order to come this far, he had designed and painted the situation stroke by stroke.\u2018Now.\u2019The opportunity had come. Hyukjin moved, determined to make a miracle happen.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Great Orc Warrior (3)The Great Orc Warrior was convinced it was the predator here. It filled its lungs, preparing to let out a bellow full of confidence.\u201cGUROAAAAR!\u201dIt roared, opening its jaws wide. These tiny humans. Even if they came in a swarm, it would not fear them in the least. It wondered how delicious human meat was, if it could become even stronger by eating humans. Its thoughts were dominated by such instincts.But then\u2014Spluuurt!Hyukjin\u2019s sword pierced through the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s mouth.\u201cSQUEAAAAAAAAAAAAAL!\u201dThe moment it roared\u2014that\u00a0was the moment Hyukjin had been aiming for. The Great Orc Warrior\u2019s skin was tough. Even its eyes were sturdy. The mouth was very nearly the sole vulnerable spot of such a sturdy monster.\u2018Now. The inside of the mouth!\u2019It was a fleeting moment, but Hyukjin didn\u2019t let it slip through his fingers.\u201cSQUEAAAAL!\u201dWith a sword lodged in its mouth, the Great Orc Warrior screamed as it crouched. Hyukjin\u2019s attack didn\u2019t end there.\u2018I have to see it through.\u2019The Great Orc Warrior\u2019s right fist came flying at him, but Hyukjin dodged it with ease. The force behind the punch was great enough to kill him instantly, but only if it hit him. Hyukjin took out the item he\u2019d picked up earlier.He drove the \u2018Steel Spike\u2019 upright at a 90 degree angle in the beast\u2019s mouth.\u2018Now, it won\u2019t be able to close its mouth\u2026!\u2019He had utilized the strategy to the utmost, not missing the tiny opening he was given. He took a step back.\u201cYoohyun!\u201dYoohyun swiftly ran over. The Great Orc Warrior had fallen to its knees. It was clawing desperately at its face, but the pain was too great for it to grab the sword lodged deep inside. It flailed in pain, unable to do anything.\u201cAim for the temples.\u201dThe Great Orc Warrior on its knees was at a height where Yoohyun\u2019s fists could easily reach its head.\u201cYes, hyungnim!\u201dYoohyun approached quickly. He used his left foot as a central axis and pivoted his hips. A right fist loaded with all the force of Yoohyun\u2019s weight slammed into the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s temple.Bam!A resounding boom burst out.Yoohyun\u2019s fist landed precisely on the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s temple. Staying in place, Yoohyun threw his left fist with his weight behind it.A left hook after a right hook.Yoohyun\u2019s sturdy legs allowed him to perfectly keep his balance. The momentarily incapacitated Great Orc Warrior was no different from a sandbag to him.The Great Orc Warrior\u2019s upper body swayed.\u201cHyungnim! Can I attack its jaw?\u201d\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t dislodge the stake.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dYoohyun grabbed the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s head with both hands and thrust his knee into its chin.[Using the skill Beginner Knee Kick.]The knee kick planted perpendicular to the ground didn\u2019t dislodge the stake. Rather, it pushed the stake further into the monster\u2019s gums, fixing it more firmly in place.\u2018It went through\u2026!\u2019Normally, the Great Orc Warrior would counterattack or block, but not right now. First of all, it was under the paralyzing poison of \u2018Mutant Wolf\u2019s Fang\u2019, and secondly, it had suffered an attack to a vulnerable part of its body\u2014the mouth. The current Great Orc Warrior was not the usual Great Orc Warrior. It was far weaker.Yeonseo came in as well.[Using the skill Single Hit Finisher.]Yeonseo had also determined that the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s weakness was the inside of its mouth. She aimed at a point directly inside the mouth, and her sword pierced its mark.After around five minutes, the Great Orc Warrior finally collapsed limply to the ground.Splurt!Hyukjin buried his sword into the back of the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s head.[Great Orc Warrior has been killed.][EXP acquired.][50 Coins acquired.]He was able to get an item from the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s body.[Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Molar]A long molar of the Great Orc Warrior. It is imbued with the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s strength. If processed in a special way and ingested, you will be able to acquire a special power.No other items were dropped.[The 2nd Gateway scenario quest, \u2018Kill the Orc Warrior\u2019, has been cleared.][Distributing the \u2018Kill the Orc Warrior\u2019 quest clear rewards.][\u2018Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Iron Armor\u2019 has been acquired.][\u2018Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Leather Shoes\u2019 has been acquired.]Hyukjin craned his ears at the notices.\u2018The Great Orc Warrior set\u2026 is pretty valuable, even in the middle period.\u2019He was given iron armor and one pair of leather shoes. Currently, considering it was the beginner period, where most Players hadn\u2019t even advanced properly yet, he had gotten extremely good items.\u2018It should be really helpful in the level 30 period.\u2019But it didn\u2019t end there.[The special ability \u2018Mettle\u2019 has been acquired.]The rewards for killing the Great Orc Warrior, a nearly impossible, highly difficult foe to defeat if not for Hyukjin\u2019s quick thinking, were absolutely not small.[Mettle]\u2018Mettle\u2019 is the aura of a ruler and the higher form of \u2018Pressure\u2019. It induces instinctive fear and awe in those who are of a lower level than the user.Unlike an \u2018innate ability\u2019, which was a dormant power within a Player, a \u2018special ability\u2019 was a new power granted to a Player by an external force. Among those \u2018special abilities\u2019, Hyukjin acquired \u2018Mettle\u2019.\u2018Ah, so this is the higher form of Pressure.\u2019\u2018Pressure\u2019 was the ability the President of Sungshin, Song Kiyoung, had used. Now, Hyukjin had the higher version of it, Mettle.But just then, he heard another notice.* * *[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 has begun to watch you.]For a moment, I could only doubt my ears.\u2018The Herdsman of Las Vegas?\u2019Even among Guardians, he was an extremely famous one. He was the Guardian of \u2018Michelle\u2019, one of America\u2019s top Rankers. Her nickname was \u2018Pyramid\u2019, or more precisely, \u2018Gold Pyramid\u2019.\u2018Michelle\u2019s Guardian is watching me?\u2019The Herdsman of Las Vegas was a Guardian who placed a great deal of importance on \u2018effective team plays\u2019 and \u2018teamwork\u2019. Michelle was a Player optimized for that.\u2018The queen at the top of countless sovereign class Players.\u2019Each and every one of the Players under Michelle\u2019s banner, the so-called \u2018Michelle Division\u2019, were national powerhouses of the highest level. The sovereign they followed was Michelle, and the Guardian Michelle made a contract with was the \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019.\u2018I thought he would be in the US server?\u2019He was watching the Korean server instead of the US one? This was certainly unprecedented.\u2018The only person who successfully contracted with the Herdsman of Las Vegas was Michelle\u2026\u2019A Guardian who had given almost exclusive support to Michelle and based his operations in the US server suddenly started to watch me. However, it didn\u2019t end at simply \u2018watching\u2019.[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 has sent you \u2018Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Leather Pants\u2019 as a sponsorship.]He kicked things off with a very generous sponsorship. With that, I was able to acquire the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s armor, shoes, and pants.\u201cDid anyone else get a notice from a Guardian called the Herdsman of Las Vegas?\u201d I asked.Everyone shook their heads. The Herdsman of Las Vegas was only interested in me.[The clear condition has been fulfilled as a result of clearing the scenario quest.][Hunt the remaining Orcs.]Originally, the 2nd Gateway in the 2nd underground floor of the Seoul Station Dungeon would be finished once you destroyed the three crystals and smashed the petrified Orcs. But now, we had to kill all the living Orcs. The difficulty itself was far higher.However, they weren\u2019t Orc Warriors, but regular Orcs, and terrified ones, at that. It wasn\u2019t difficult to hunt them down.[Orc has been killed.][EXP acquired.][Level increased.][Current level: 29]We went around the dungeon for about one hour.\u201cSqueaal!\u201dAnd then, we succeeded in killing the last Orc.[You have cleared the Seoul Station Dungeon 2nd Underground Floor.][300 Coins acquired.][Dungeon title \u2018Conqueror of the Seoul Station Dungeon\u2019 acquired.][Leaving the dungeon in 30 seconds.]Dungeon titles were different from regular titles. Dungeon titles were special titles that only applied within the dungeon where it was acquired. Normally, they weren\u2019t that useful.\u2018Having it is still better than nothing, though.\u2019Sunhwa smiled wide. \u201cWe cleared it!\u201dHer brightly smiling face looked really cute. I wondered if this is how it would feel if I had a daughter later. Everyone relished the joy of the clear.Yeonseo went into a big stretch. \u201cI\u2019ll need to sleep for about three days when we get out.\u201dWhile she was stretching, something caught my eye.\u2018Huh?\u2019Over there, near the tent of the Great Orc Warrior, I saw a door in the air.\u201cWhat\u2019s that door?\u201dYeonseo turned.\u201cI don\u2019t see anything?\u201d[Leaving the dungeon in 20 seconds.]Sunhwa also tilted her head. \u201cWhat? Is there something there?\u201dYoohyun was the same. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there, hyungnim!\u201d[Leaving the dungeon in 13 seconds.]I was sure of it. Only I could see that door. I had never heard of any kind of \u2018door\u2019 within this hidden piece, the Seoul Station Dungeon 2nd Underground Floor, not even in the exploration logs of the Great Explorer \u2018Jackson\u2019.[Leaving the dungeon in 9 seconds.]A door only I could see. What did it mean? I had never experienced a phenomenon like this in the flesh.[In addition, the 2nd floor of the D-Tower parking lot is being established as an extra Safe Zone.]During the Tutorial, I had heard a special notice that no one else had heard.\u2018An unfair notice\u2026 determined by talent.\u2019That was what I was seeing right now.\u2018It\u2019s because of that notice that I attempted the D-Tower 2nd Floor.\u2019It was because I heard that extra safe zone notice that I was able to come back alive from the Tutorial.A door visible only to me\u2026I made a decision.\u201cThere\u2019s a door only I can see. I think it\u2019s a special hidden piece,\u201d I said quickly.[Leaving the dungeon in 6 seconds.]\u201cSo you guys go out first. I\u2019ll come out after clearing it.\u201dThe clock kept ticking down. There was no time to spare.[Leaving the dungeon in 3 seconds.]I immediately used \u2018Flash Step\u2019 with title switching and reached the door instantaneously. Voices came from behind me.\u201cHey! Boss! What is it? What\u2019s going on!\u201d\u201cHyungnim!\u201d\u201cOppa!\u201dI wasn\u2019t able to explain any more.[Leaving the dungeon in 1 second.]My hand touched the door.[You have discovered a Special Hidden Piece, \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019.][Entering the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019.]____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: The Herdsman of Las VegasSenia\u2019s wings trembled. She was maintaining an expressionless face, but inside, she was greatly shocked.\u2018Are you telling me there was a special hidden piece here?\u2019That was something even she, an Intermediate Administrator, didn\u2019t know about. She had never thought that such a hidden piece would exist in what was merely the beginner period, not even a higher level period.A special hidden piece. It was the sort of thing the Guardians, as addicted to spectating as they were, went crazy over.The messages of Guardians reacting and entering her channel hit her almost like a deluge.[Anonymous Guardians are entering Channel #19207 in great numbers.][The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 has sent a subscription contract request to Channel #19207.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 has sent the Intermediate Administrator a 200 Coin sponsorship.]\u2026[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 has sent the Intermediate Administrator a 120 Coin sponsorship.]The stream of notices continued without end. A whopping \u2018special hidden piece\u2019 that no one had anticipated in the beginner period was discovered. And that was being streamed\u00a0exclusively by Senia.\u00a0The Guardians were not stingy with their sponsorships to such a commendable(?) Intermediate Administrator. Of the guardians who had just come in and didn\u2019t know yet what was going on, the anonymous Guardians shot out a barrage of questions.\u2013What in the world is this?\u2013Isn\u2019t this the beginner period? A special hidden piece actually existed?\u2013Could it be a special area made by some respected Guardian?\u2013Can someone explain this to me please?The \u2018True Name Guardians\u2019 who, unlike such rabble, could be called the real Guardians, watched the situation in silence. They might be staying quiet, but it was a definite fact that they, too, were on the edge of their seats.Senia was bewildered.\u2018This is the strength of good quality content.\u2019Actually, she knew. She knew she wasn\u2019t good at talking, that she couldn\u2019t make things fun like the other Intermediate Administrators, and that she couldn\u2019t accommodate the Guardians\u2019 tastes very well. The only advantage she had was her appearance, which could contend for the top ranks even among Intermediate Administrators in beauty.\u2018But beauty alone\u2026 isn\u2019t enough for me to survive.\u2019That was something Senia knew keenly, as well. But now, there was already a Guardian wanting to \u2018subscribe\u2019, and countless Guardians were showering her with Coins. There were also many Guardians who didn\u2019t go into the channels of other Intermediate Administrators and stayed exclusively in hers, Channel #19207.Standing in front of the door going into the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019, Senia stared at Kim Hyukjin. His movements held no trace of hesitation or delay.To Hyukjin, it was definitely uncharted territory, but he didn\u2019t look fearful in the least.\u2018Player Kim Hyukjin.\u2019Just like Hyukjin had guaranteed, he certainly proved his worth as \u2018quality content\u2019. If not for him, Senia would have probably not even made it this far.[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 has sent a subscription contract request to Channel #19207.][A great number of anonymous Guardians have become excited.][A great number of anonymous Guardians are unable to take their eyes off Player Kim Hyukjin.]She looked at Hyukjin once again. She, like the Guardians, was unable to take her eyes off him.\u2018Please don\u2019t die.\u2019Senia was suddenly taken aback, greatly startled by her own emotions.\u2018No. I was just mistaken for a moment.\u2019She unconsciously shook her head, and three times at that.\u2018This emotion isn\u2019t me worrying about Player Kim Hyukjin.\u2019She, Senia, did not stoop to the likes of worrying. Such an emotion was worthless. She had no emotions. She was convinced of that. So the thought that had just run through her mind was absolutely not worry.\u2018This is merely uneasiness about what I would do if something happened to my quality content.\u2019Though no one was listening, she thought that to herself.\u2018Because it would be difficult to find such quality content again.\u2019While she was thinking, Hyukjin entered the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019, and she followed, still amazed that he had discovered such a thing.The field changed. She saw an extremely dense forest, which suited the area\u2019s name perfectly.[You have entered the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019.][Issuing a clear quest.][Find the master of the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019 and converse with them.]A clear quest was issued. Hyukjin had to find the master of the forest. Senia cast her senses far into the distance.\u2018It\u2019s large.\u2019It was a massive forest the likes of which could not exist in the beginner period. The size of this one forest was almost on par with the size of all of Seoul.\u2018I can hardly believe he was given a quest to find the master of such an enormous forest. Is this really a hidden piece that can be cleared?\u2019There was no knowing where he could be, or who the master of the forest was. This was really a quest with a lot of legwork.She heard his voice.\u201cThis\u2026 If things go wrong, I could die of hunger. Even though I\u2019m almost level 30 now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia didn\u2019t respond. Hyukjin\u2019s words weren\u2019t wrong. It was possible he could starve. This place was so large, and he hadn\u2019t brought any provisions.* * *I anticipated a response to my meaningful words. This was a place that the Guardians would go crazy for, a so-called special hidden piece. There probably weren\u2019t many Guardians who wanted a super rookie like me to perish out of hunger in such a place.\u2018My level is 29. The Guardian selection time is coming up.\u2019So what will you do, Guardians? What kind of card will you offer me?In mere moments, the notices rushed in.[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 lends you a \u2018Magic Camping Set\u2019.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 lends you \u2018Magic Spring Water\u2019.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 lends you the \u2018Heavenly Demonic Breathing Art\u2019.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 lends you a \u2018Magic Campfire\u2019.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 temporarily increases the grade of your \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019.]Though I was the one who wanted this to happen, even I was struck speechless.\u2018What the hell is this?\u2019The number of Guardians who could send messages at the same time was limited to five. Therefore, the previous stream of messages meant that all five slots were filled up to send me aid.\u2018Magic Camping Set, Magic Spring Water, Heavenly Demonic Breathing Art, increase in Eye of Perception\u2019s grade, Magic Campfire?\u2019A Magic Camping Set was basically some simple cooking tools and equipment for camping bundled as a set.Senia approached me. \u201cI will begin explaining the items. The Magic Camping Set is\u2026\u201dI knew everything even without her explanation.\u2018Magic Camping Set. Even though it looks shabby, it\u2019s a camping set that costs over $30k.\u2019This set of items was something future Rankers possessed at least one of and wasn\u2019t something that should appear in the beginner level period. With this, I could even establish a safe zone, though it would be weak.\u201cAlso, the Magic Spring Water is\u2026\u201d\u201cDrinking water.\u201d\u201c\u2026Correct.\u201dIn an extended dungeon exploration, this \u2018Magic Spring Water\u2019 was even more important than the Magic Camping Set. You could get at least 1,000 liters of fresh drinking water from it.\u201cMoving on, the Heavenly Demonic Breathing Art is a special skill temporarily granted by the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain that\u2026\u201dIt was a skill that the Sword Empress would get in the future. You could think of it like a cure-all that instantly restored your fatigue. Even though it counted as a crucial ability of the Sword Empress, I would be able to use it, at least temporarily.\u201cThe Magic Campfire is\u2026\u201dAs one might expect, it was an enchanted campfire that could be turned on and off repeatedly. It was thought to be able to stay lit for at least 3,000 hours, could not be extinguished by rain, and also had a great effect in keeping monsters away.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin. Are you listening to me?\u201dMy eyes whipped to Senia. Was it my imagination, or did she raise her voice just now?\u2018Is she mad because I ignored her words?\u2019But the feelings I could pick up from her with Eye of Perception were a little strange.\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s simple anger.\u2019I couldn\u2019t say what exactly she was feeling. For now, I increased the grade of Eye of Perception with the help of the \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019.[Temporarily increasing the grade of \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019.]Afterwards, I was able to perceive Senia\u2019s emotions in greater detail. Things that I hadn\u2019t seen before were revealed to my eyes.[Intermediate Administrator]Name: SeniaAge: 332Level: ?Race: AngelSubscriber Guardians: [Courageous Lion King], [Herdsman of Las Vegas], +1State: Neutral / Observing / FacadeSummary: Woman Denying Her FeelingsLevel cannot be determined.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible.\u2018Something\u2019s a little weird about her state and summary.\u2019Neutral and observing were fine, but what was with facade? And the summary was \u2018Woman Denying Her Feelings\u2019.\u2018It\u2019s not even Angel Denying Her Feelings, but\u00a0woman?\u2019Was she bound by some kind of taboo where she had no choice but to deny her feelings?\u2018It would have been nice to be able to see more detailed information.\u2019What I found funny was that the \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 and the \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 were subscribed to Senia.\u2018They sure did it fast.\u2019There was also a +1 next to their names, but I didn\u2019t know who it was.\u2018In Eye of Perception\u2026\u2019Strangely enough, I got the feeling that a little \u2018worry\u2019 was mixed into Senia\u2019s emotions. However, that feeling disappeared before long.\u2018I must be mistaken.\u2019An Intermediate Administrator would never worry about a mere Player. Streamers and Players had a you-use-me, I-use-you relationship. In other words, a business relationship. It was hard to imagine that she would worry about me when I was only a business partner.Senia reiterated, \u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin. I asked if you were listening to me or not.\u201d\u201cI heard it all, don\u2019t worry.\u201dSurprisingly, Senia\u2019s face reddened. Her wingtips trembled visibly.\u201cI do not lower myself to \u2018worry\u2019. Don\u2019t be mistaken. Player Kim Hyukjin.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThat kind of reaction made me think she really did worry about me. But Senia continued, and I shelved that thought.\u201cWith my authority as an Intermediate Administrator, I will issue a quest.\u201dIn order to make the content more fun, an Intermediate Administrator could issue a quest that wouldn\u2019t alter the scenario. It wasn\u2019t that unusual an occurrence.But\u2026 the quest was a little strange. No, it was very strange.[Receiving the quest \u2018Repeat After Me\u2019.]\u201c\u2026Is this a real quest?\u201d\u201cYes. There is no doubt.\u201dRepeat After Me. It was self-explanatory.[Repeat After Me]A quest from the Intermediate Administrator Senia. Explain all the information Senia gave you in detail.Quest reward: 300 CoinsGiving me this kind of joke quest, was she really worried about me? Was she purposefully trying to confirm that I knew everything? Even at the cost of her precious Coins?\u2018Well, it\u2019s easy enough.\u2019\u201cFirst of all, a Magic Camping Set is\u2026\u201dI already knew all there was to know about these items.\u201cAnd the Magic Campfire\u2026 on and off repeatedly.\u201dWhen I finished explaining all the items, I got a quest clear notice.[The quest \u2018Repeat After Me\u2019 has been cleared.]From that, I noticed something odd. It was only one small oddity, but it didn\u2019t evade me.\u2018What the heck?\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: Herdsman of Las Vegas (2)I was able to earn 300 Coins from this joke of a quest. But that wasn\u2019t the important thing.\u2018I didn\u2019t say anything about Eye of Perception\u2026\u2019I hadn\u2019t said anything about Eye of Perception\u2019s grade increase, but the quest was cleared anyway.\u2018What does this mean?\u2019It meant\u2026 that Senia didn\u2019t know about the gift the Nameless Observer gave me.\u2018But why?\u2019 I had no idea. \u2018Is that really how it is?\u2019I was probably correct. Senia didn\u2019t know that my Eye of Perception\u2019s grade was temporarily increased.\u201cSatisfied? I memorized it perfectly, right?\u201d\u201cYou did. But Player Kim Hyukjin needs to listen more carefully to my explanation. It could be directly tied to your survival.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it fine since I memorized it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, but\u2014\u201dIt wasn\u2019t good to talk to a Streamer for too long. A chat between a Player and Streamer wasn\u2019t what the Guardians wanted to see. What they wanted to see was how I would clear this \u2018special hidden piece\u2019.\u2018Though, for someone like the Whispering Devil, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d like to see me suffer and suffer some more.\u2019In any case, I moved forward. I could tell from Eye of Perception that the scale of this forest was enormous, so large that it was difficult to determine exactly how far it extended.\u2018It\u2019ll take a while.\u2019Everything else wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem, but I was a little worried about my mom and older sister.\u2018But nothing will come out of worrying now.\u2019This was a path I chose to walk. There were no take backs, and there was no path back, anyway.\u2018The clue is to find the master of the forest.\u2019That was my only hint.\u2018It\u2019s evening right now.\u2019The \u2018flow of time\u2019 existed in this hidden piece. The sun was setting, which meant that side was to the west.\u2018Without a dungeon compass, that\u2019s the only way for me to tell the direction.\u2019According to the wisdom of the Great Explorer Jackson, when you didn\u2019t know where to go, it was most favorable to walk to the \u2018west\u2019. There wasn\u2019t any law behind it, but in his experience, west was best.\u2018It shouldn\u2019t be a high difficulty dungeon that changes directions on its own.\u2019I decided to begin my survey after setting a point of reference. A day passed in that manner.* * *Using the camping tools the Guardians provided, I set up my campsite. The effect notifications of the Magic Campfire and Magic Camping Set came in.[A Safe Zone has been established.][The Safe Zone will be marked in green.]I was inwardly satisfied. \u2018This is on the big side, too.\u2019I was able to set up a safe zone 5 meters large in diameter, fairly large for a safe zone. When inside, I wouldn\u2019t be attacked by monsters.\u2018It\u2019s still the beginner period, after all.\u2019Among the monsters in the beginner period, there weren\u2019t any crazy ones that could destroy a safe zone parameter and barge inside.\u2018And if there is\u2026\u2019Safe zone or not, I would die anyway. I hoped there wasn\u2019t a monster like that, but if there was, it was game over for me. Otherwise, this safe zone was extremely useful.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin. What have you discovered while investigating this place?\u201dI could tell. This wasn\u2019t her own question; she was just the mouthpiece.\u2018A Guardian\u2019s question.\u2019The process of exploration itself wasn\u2019t that fun or exciting. Right now, I had to collect clues and clear the quest. I couldn\u2019t make the entire process interesting. Sometime along the way, there would be Guardians who would stop watching me.\u2018I should explain the most essential things.\u2019I understood this System well, and I was determined to use that knowledge to the utmost.\u201cFirst of all, this is a forest field.\u201dThat was all too obvious.\u201cWhile surveying today, I saw about three different sets of claw marks. They were gouged on tree trunks.\u201dI was faithful to the basics that the Great Explorer Jackson wrote in his basic strategy guide. My focus was on figuring out what kind of monsters existed in the dungeon, what their habits were, what the terrain was, that kind of basic information.\u201cLooking at the height at which the claw marks were gouged and their size, there\u2019s a high chance that they belong to a cat-like beast monster.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia listened to me in silence. With the upgraded Eye of Perception, I could read Senia\u2019s emotions a little. Even though she didn\u2019t express it on her face, she was currently impressed. The Guardians were probably in the same boat, because by their standards, I was a beginner who hadn\u2019t even had his advancement yet.\u201cThere\u2019s a high chance the beasts have individual territories. Considering that I didn\u2019t see any traces of fighting, they avoid fighting amongst each other. That means there\u2019s no fighting between them at all.\u201d\u201cWhat use is that to Player Kim Hyukjin?\u201d\u201cIf I move along the borders of their territories, where one monster\u2019s territory meets another, I can minimize the chance of getting attacked by them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAlso, nocturnal birds of prey are flying around at night.\u201dThey moved at night. They weren\u2019t so strong they could punch through my safe zone, but they were still pretty dangerous monsters.\u2018Like the Red-Eyed Owl.\u2019The Red-Eyed Owl was only level 29, but it was a \u2018bird\u2019 type monster. It also had better eyesight at night than me, so it would be much more difficult to face than regular level 29 monsters.\u201cWhich has to mean there are creatures out there for those monsters to hunt.\u201dIf there was a predator, there was prey. That was normally the case. Dungeons were places ruled by the law of the jungle.\u201cStrangely enough, I don\u2019t see traces of prey. So what does that mean?\u201dI didn\u2019t know, either. But something was definitely strange.\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia didn\u2019t respond.[The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 feels great interest in your exploration.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 finds your Playing fun.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 is bored.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 expresses her admiration at your composure.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 observes you without pause.]Another day passed. I wasn\u2019t able to discover anything more.\u2018Let\u2019s not be impatient.\u2019It was only the third day. Dangerous dungeons often took several months to clear.\u2018I\u2019m strangely calm.\u2019Actually, if you were in an unfamiliar, potentially dangerous place for three days all alone, it was probably normal to be scared. And yet\u2026\u2018Weirdly enough, I\u2019m not.\u2019I had no choice but to honestly acknowledge my feelings.\u2018No.\u2019It wasn\u2019t just that I wasn\u2019t scared. To be perfectly honest\u2014\u2018I\u2019m having fun.\u2019Right now, I was having a great deal of fun Playing. Feeling that Playing was fun was certainly influenced by one\u2019s talent. That was how many people had put it.\u2018I just have to hope I\u2019m not an early bloomer.\u2019Whether I was an early blooming Player or not would be determined by whether I could break through level 40. Normally, early bloomers stalled at around level 30-40.On my fourth day of exploration, I stumbled upon a burnt-down village.[Entering the \u2018Razed Village of Forest Dwellers\u2019.][Entering a \u2018Safe Zone\u2019.]In this \u2018Razed Village of Forest Dwellers\u2019 within the special hidden field, the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019, there were only scorched frames left of most of the houses. It was a designated safe zone.\u2018Will there be a clue here?\u2019I didn\u2019t know. I would only know by digging around. If there was something I could \u2018click\u2019, then I would be able to obtain a clue.\u2018This house is pretty intact.\u2019One of the houses was still standing. Even though it was a roughly made wooden house, it still looked like a \u2018house\u2019. I went inside.\u2018Huh?\u2019I instantly turned, taking out a sword from my Inventory.\u2018What was that just now?\u2019It was undoubtedly a safe zone, but I felt something strange. It was very minute, but there was definitely something there.\u2018Eye of Perception\u2026 is telling me.\u2019I could feel a gaze on me.\u2018Something\u2019s out there.\u2019But I couldn\u2019t figure out what that thing was. Something was watching me. I was barely able to capture its presence with my upgraded Eye of Perception. If I hadn\u2019t gotten the upgrade, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to feel it at all.\u2018Even though this is a safe zone.\u2019It seemed I had to keep my guard up. I had a bad feeling, somehow.\u2018That\u2019s clickable.\u2019I saw a scorched set of drawers that was clickable. When I clicked it with my gaze, the drawer automatically opened, revealing a letter within.[\u2018Letter of the Forest Dwellers\u2019 Chief\u2019 acquired.]I examined the letter.Dear Old Man Lepry,This is a letter sent from the westernmost village Dott to the easternmost village Dante. Old Man Lepry. It\u2019s already over for us. The Master of the Forest is enraged. They have unleashed their fury on us. There is no way for us to avoid their wrath. I hope that you\u2026I couldn\u2019t read the rest because the letter was partly burnt.\u2018So the setting is that the Master of the Forest is enraged, and because of that, this place was burnt down?\u2019That was definitely a plausible setting. I had to use this letter as a launchpad to find more clues and meet that Master of the Forest.\u2018The letter says this is the westernmost village, Dott.\u2019Which meant that if I moved eastward, I would find a village to the far east.\u201cWhat do you intend on doing? Will you go eastward?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThe letter said this was the westernmost village. There was a high chance that I was almost at the western end of this \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019. It could be helpful to know what was at the end of this field.\u201cI\u2019ll explore the west side a little more before moving east. That could very well be the more efficient strategy.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dI wasn\u2019t able to get any additional information from the \u2018Razed Village of Forest Dwellers\u2019. I headed west some more.At some point, I was blocked by a transparent wall.[You cannot go any further.]The field, a dense forest, continued before my eyes. But I couldn\u2019t go past this wall.\u2018There\u2019s a chance this is the end of the field.\u2019Or\u2014\u2018It could also be set to become traversable only after satisfying a special condition.\u2019I thought that the latter was more likely, because I could physically see more of the field.\u2018Not much came of that.\u2019Now that I had checked, I had to turn to the east. A dungeon clear carried out without knowing the strategy was a little boring. Like I first expected, the beast monsters had some sort of agreement and didn\u2019t leave their territories, and as a result, I was able to explore without getting attacked.\u2018There might be something if I go to the east.\u2019It might be a little boring, but it couldn\u2019t be helped. For the Guardians, this might just be a game or amusement, but for me, this was a matter of life and death. Even when challenging the unknown, it was best to do it as safely as possible.\u2018That faint gaze I felt in the village\u2026\u2019Very occasionally, I felt that gaze again. Something I couldn\u2019t identify in the least was watching me. It didn\u2019t look like they were going to attack me right away, but it weighed heavily on me and was part of why I couldn\u2019t be careless here.But just then, I heard a new notice.[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 offers you a proposal.]This notice ushered the scenario into a new phase.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: Elf in the Well[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 offers you a proposal.]I knew about the Herdsman of Las Vegas. Other than being the Guardian of Michelle, the \u2018Gold Pyramid\u2019, the Herdsman of Las Vegas was a Guardian who greatly enjoyed \u2018gambling\u2019.\u2018I heard he made a lot of cracked wagers.\u2019Attractive proposals that a Player would be hard-pressed to resist.\u2018But the only one who survived that wager and succeeded\u2026 was Michelle.\u2019That was why his only \u2018successful\u2019 contractee was Michelle.\u2018It will definitely be an appealing, hard-to-resist proposal.\u2019That proposal unfolded.[If you clear the special hidden piece, the \u2018Unknown Forest\u2019, within 3 days, he will grant you 100,000 Coins.]Such a massive quantity of Coins would make even a dead man perk up. Guardian sponsorships were limited to 100, 200, or maybe 300 Coins, at most. But now, he was offering a whopping 100,000 Coins. In the Player world, it was pretty much like a lottery jackpot.[Accept the quest \u2018Clear within 3 days\u2019?]Upon closer inspection, it was actually a little fraudulent. He only waved the sweet reward I would get upon succeeding and didn\u2019t tell me what the penalty would be if I failed. You\u2019d be setting yourself up for bankruptcy if you were blinded by that 100,000 Coin sum.\u201cSenia. What happens if I fail this quest?\u201d\u201cI will share the quest information at the Player\u2019s request.\u201dFor some reason, I had the feeling that Senia was a little relieved.\u201cIf you cannot clear within three days\u2026\u201dSenia\u2019s wingtips trembled, something that seemed to happen an awful lot these days.\u2018What\u2019s making her act like that?\u2019 I wondered what was making her so shocked.\u201cThen when it becomes time to choose a Guardian, you must unconditionally choose the \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 as your contracted Guardian.\u201dFor a moment, I was also rendered speechless.\u2018That\u2019s\u00a0the penalty? Just that?\u2019A staggering 100,000 Coins was on the line.\u2018The penalty is only that?\u2019It was an enormous reward that could never have existed in the beginner period, and even if it did, it probably shouldn\u2019t. But the penalty was merely \u2018choose me\u2019.\u2018Actually, someone on the level of the Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2026 wouldn\u2019t be a bad choice.\u2019He was the Guardian of that famous Gold Pyramid, Michelle, wasn\u2019t he? A Guardian like the \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 would cement a foundation that would potentially allow me to grow into the world\u2019s top Ranker. The scale of the current gamble was proof of that. He was a dependable Guardian who was willing to throw himself into developing a Player once he made up his mind to do so.\u2018Three days.\u2019\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin, will you accept the quest?\u201d asked Senia.I contemplated for a moment.\u2018The Herdsman of Las Vegas.\u2019He was a Guardian who didn\u2019t skimp on supporting the Player he treasured. I thought about it a little more. But even after thinking about it some more, my answer was the same.\u201cNo. I cannot accept this quest.\u201d[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 is curious about what you are thinking.]The Herdsman of Las Vegas didn\u2019t express disappointment, only his curiosity. He was definitely no petty bastard.As expressionless as ever, Senia said, \u201cMay I ask why?\u201dBecause the Herdsman of Las Vegas was a Guardian who loved gambling to an excessive degree. Michelle was lucky enough to succeed such a gamble, but I wasn\u2019t the type to enjoy gambling.\u2018More than anything, I\u2026\u2019Had no need to gamble. With my knowledge of the future, I\u00a0was\u00a0able to \u2018invest\u2019 in the unlikely. But when it came to things that weren\u2019t just unlikely, but almost impossible, there was no need to \u2018gamble\u2019 on that low, low chance of things working out.\u2018It\u2019s more than enough to just invest.\u2019With that in mind, taking on a high risk, high return gamble wasn\u2019t very wise.So the question was, how should I put it? I had to express my thoughts in a way that least offended a so-called named Guardian like the Herdsman of Las Vegas. At the same time, I had to be able to win over other Guardians who were currently watching this all unfold very intently.\u201cPlacing a bet is something one does when you have a chance of victory.\u201d\u201cWas the proposal made by the Herdsman of Las Vegas one that was impossible to complete?\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s not the case.\u201dClearing within three days? It was possible.\u201cBut I can\u2019t orchestrate the probability. At least not in the current field.\u201dI still lacked too much information.\u201cI want to be the one who orchestrates the probability and makes a situation where I can win. Only idiots would let themselves be blinded by the tantalizing reward and bet without any information.\u201dIt was the kind of disposition the Herdsman of Las Vegas liked. Michelle had also said something like this. Gambling was a fight of probability, but she, the Player, would create that probability so that she would have a slightly higher chance to succeed. She said people who bet without preparation were idiots.\u201cThat\u2019s why I refused. A gamble entrusted to luck alone is no different from throwing the game.\u201dI didn\u2019t know if that answer would satisfy the Herdsman. Notices came in.[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 is satisfied by your response.][The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 respects your thinking.]Other notices came in as well.[A great number of anonymous Guardians are impressed by your response.]Even though they saw the same situation and heard the same things, the reactions of the Guardians were mixed.[A great number of anonymous Guardians ridicule you.]I could understand why they would ridicule me. I was still only level 29. To them, I was like a flickering candlelight they could extinguish with a single puff of their lips. Someone so weak refused the proposal of the Herdsman of Las Vegas of all Guardians, saying they would bet while orchestrating the probability. They were big words spoken with a great deal of bravado.\u2018Laugh all you want.\u2019The day when the Guardians could no longer ridicule me would come. I would see to that.I moved east. Starting from the westernmost village, which the letter had called \u2018Dott\u2019, I went to \u2018Dante\u2019 in the east.While doing so, I had to prepare food.Splurt!I jumped on the back of a wild boar as big as me and thrust my dagger.Squeaaaaal!The boar\u2019s name was \u2018Fanged Boar\u2019. It was about level 25, but it had a pretty volatile temperament.[Fanged Boar has been killed.][EXP acquired.][17 Coins acquired.]It gave way less Coins than other monsters of the same level, but it had its own virtues that made it worth killing.[\u2018Fruit Bundle\u2019 acquired.]I had to admit it was a little strange. I had never heard of Fanged Boars dropping \u2018Fruit Bundles\u2019. Normally, they didn\u2019t.\u2018Maybe it\u2019s a hidden piece put in to allow a Player to survive?\u2019I brushed it aside for now, but it was a bit strange. In any case, I hunted a few more Fanged Boars.[\u2018Fruit Bundle\u2019 acquired.]In the process, I was able to procure a little more information.\u2018They\u2019re not wary of their surroundings.\u2019Normally, \u2018Fanged Boars\u2019 were monsters that were watchful of their surroundings, especially if there were \u2018beast monsters\u2019 in the vicinity.\u2018From the traces left on the trees, there are definitely beast monsters around here.\u2019But despite that, these boars weren\u2019t wary. That meant the beast monsters were weak, or that they didn\u2019t attack Fanged Boars.\u2018Those traces are definitely\u2026 from a Red Tiger. There are Red Tigers around, but they don\u2019t attack the Fanged Boars?\u2019That was indeed very peculiar. The weird gaze I could feel with Eye of Perception also bothered me. It could even be that the \u2018Master of the Forest\u2019 was watching me right now.\u2018That\u2019s\u2026\u2019There was no doubt about it. As I was walking along the forest floor, I discovered a trap made of rope, a snare designed to catch animals using a rope and net. It was enchanted with very basic \u2018capture magic\u2019.\u2018What?\u2019In this field, in which a very small village of forest dwellers existed, there was an\u00a0artifact?\u00a0And an enchanted artifact, no less?They used an artifact to hunt animals? As basic as the magic was, enchanted items were expensive. It was absolutely not an item a tiny village in a forest would use.\u2018Something\u2019s going on.\u2019As I thought, there was more to this place than the eye suggested. I couldn\u2019t say what exactly it was, but it was definitely strange. There was a high chance I was missing something right now.I stowed the snare in my Inventory. Then, I continued to move east, and eventually, I found the easternmost village, \u2018Dante\u2019.The same notices I had heard in the westernmost village came in.[Entering the \u2018Razed Village 2 of Forest Dwellers\u2019.][Entering a \u2018Safe Zone\u2019.]I combed through the village. Like the other village, there was a fairly intact shack with a clickable set of drawers inside. When I opened it, I found a piece of paper with words on it, just like before.Dear Old Man Dudia,This is a letter sent from the easternmost village Dante to the westernmost village Dott. Old Man Dudia. We need a sacrifice. The Master of the Forest demanded an offering from us. But you know as well as me. The restriction of this forest. So I am very troubled. Oh, right. The offering for the Master of the Forest is\u2026\u2018The restriction of the forest?\u2019I had no idea what that could be.\u2018An offering for the Master of the Forest\u2026\u2019What I could be sure of was that this place had some kind of restriction, had a \u2018Master of the Forest\u2019, and the villagers needed an \u2018offering\u2019 for the Master of the Forest.\u2018If you can\u2019t make an offering to the Master of the Forest\u2026\u2019It might be that I would also be annihilated, like these villagers. Then where in the world was I supposed to find the Master of the Forest? I left the shack and walked around the village. In this village reduced to ruins, there were only burned down shacks\u2026\u2026and a well in the center of the village.\u2018Huh?\u2019Eye of Perception told me that something was in the well. I approached it. The inside was dark, and I couldn\u2019t see anything.\u2018Someone\u2019s inside.\u2019They were barely breathing, their presence so faint that they could die at any moment.\u2018It\u2019s probably not a Player.\u2019Which meant it was an NPC. An NPC that might give me a huge hint to clearing this place.\u2018I have to take them out.\u2019According to what I felt through Eye of Perception, the person inside the well was one hair away from death. There was no time to waste.\u2018I can do it.\u2019My careful exploration on the way here was a big help. I thought this rope trap enchanted with capture magic was strange. For such an out-of-place object to exist here meant that it would be helpful in clearing the dungeon. It was good I\u2019d surveyed my surroundings thoroughly, even though that was a little more time-consuming.[Use the \u2018Snare\u2019?]I tossed the enchanted snare into the well.[Capture was successful.]I hauled up the snare. Eye of Perception told me it was unmistakably a person. Before long, I saw her\u2014 a woman with extremely long hair and clothing that had become rags. She was markedly emaciated, like she hadn\u2019t eaten in a long time. For now, I poured a Constitution Potion and Cure Potion into her mouth.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: Elf in the Well (2)The woman who absorbed the potion recovered her vitality remarkably quickly. Her emaciated body of just skin and bones suddenly grew flesh at a speed at which \u2018growing\u2019 really was the right word to describe it. Her crumbly, dull hair completely fell out, replaced in moments by glossy, green-colored hair.As she regained consciousness, a breeze carrying a refreshing arboreal scent blew over.\u2018She\u2019s an elf?\u2019In conclusion, the woman I saved was an \u2018elf\u2019.\u2018The elves\u2026\u2019They were a race with exceptional curing and recovery abilities, one that loved nature and had very beautiful appearances. Among their kind, \u2018Oak Elves\u2019 were famous for adhering to unconditional \u2018nonviolence\u2019.\u2018Later, there\u2019ll be people who abuse that trait of theirs.\u2019For example, people like that notorious slave trader \u2018Seo Jun\u2019.In any case, I had just saved an elf. I had seen them often on Youtube, as their beauty was renowned and there were a lot of streamers who exclusively filmed elves.\u2018Seeing one in person\u2026\u2019The phrase \u2018jaw-dropping beauty\u2019 seemed a little exaggerated to me.\u2018Is it because Senia is next to me?\u2019I couldn\u2019t see her right now, but maybe I wasn\u2019t that blown away by the elf\u2019s beauty because I was already used to Senia\u2019s appearance. It kind of just felt like my mind recognized the elf as an incredible beauty, but that was it. Just \u2018ah, she\u2019s super pretty\u2019.Thanks to Eye of Perception\u2019s temporary upgrade, I was able to read the elf\u2019s status.[NPC]Name: LindiaAge: 91Level: ?Race: Oak ElfState: Confused / Hungry / ScaredSummary: Confused PacifistLevel cannot be determined.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible.\u201cThank you for saving me.\u201dThat was how our conversation began. As per usual, conversations with NPCs who gave quests or clues began with greetings. Afterwards, you\u2019d get into the nitty gritty, like asking them why they were here or if they knew something that could be of help. It was pretty much an official format, so I was able to speak to her without much difficulty.\u201cYou seem to be a resident of this village. And it seems\u2026 that you have suffered the wrath of the Master of the Forest.\u201dShe nodded. She said that she fled the Master of the Forest by jumping into the well and was barely able to survive. We talked for a while, and in the end, the answer was this.\u201cYou make an offering to the Master of the Forest.\u201d\u201cAn offering?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt had to be the same offering that showed up in the letter.\u201cWhat needs to be offered?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Lindia looked embarrassed.\u201cYou don\u2019t know what the offering is, I see.\u201d\u201cYes. I really cannot figure out what it could be. If I knew\u2026 I would have offered it at the altar to the south\u2026\u201dI at least found out that there was an altar to the south.\u201cI will soon return to nature\u2019s embrace.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIn our words, so human words, she was saying she would die. From what Lindia was saying, she hadn\u2019t completely recovered, but had regained her strength for a brief moment.\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. I will return to the embrace of the Great Mother who gave birth to me. Do not be alarmed. I will turn to dust and become nutrients for the oaks.\u201dThe sight of the elf clasping her hands at her chest was the very picture of a goddess who loved the forest.\u201cI see.\u201dHowever, there was more to this woman than her goddess-like exterior suggested. The forest scent tickling my nose wasn\u2019t as fresh-smelling as before.\u201cBut you know,\u201d I started to say.I became certain of it after talking to the elf.\u201cCan you really return to the oaks?\u201dI said one more thing.\u201cYou fake.\u201dFrom the very first moment I entered this forest, the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019, there was something off about it.\u2018There are traces of predators, yet no traces of prey being caught.\u2019The boars also acted like they had never been hunted before.\u2018And they don\u2019t fight for territory like beast monsters usually do.\u2019Also, I could hear nocturnal birds of prey at night, but there weren\u2019t actually any monsters that they could catch. Something was weird about this ecosystem.\u2018And\u2026 Fanged Boars don\u2019t drop Fruit Bundles out of nowhere.\u2019That wasn\u2019t all.\u2018There\u2019s even an enchanted artifact in a place like this.\u2019The System tended to put quite a lot of importance on fundamental \u2018settings\u2019 and \u2018realistic situations\u2019. Of course, there were also scenarios that were random and came out of left field, but those wouldn\u2019t appear in the \u2018beginner period\u2019.\u2018And there\u2019s an elf here?\u2019It was true that an elf\u2019s ability to recover was unrivaled, but even an elf couldn\u2019t recover so quickly from just a \u2018beginner\u2019 recovery potion.\u201cWell, let\u2019s just let a hundred inconsistencies slide and say there\u2019s really an elf here.\u201dHowever\u2014\u201cWhy did you say you were a resident of this village?\u201dElves didn\u2019t harm trees. They lived for the trees and would never even dream of putting a saw to a tree. So if elves were to live in this village, there shouldn\u2019t be any huts. But this village had huts. That was why I purposefully asked her if she was \u2018a resident of this village\u2019.\u201cCan an elf build and live in a hut?\u201dFrom the first point to the last, it was all strange. If you looked at it closely, there were many inconsistencies, ones that strayed far, far away from a realistic situation.I stared at the elf, who was turning to dust and disappearing.Lindia the elf looked at me with an expression of utter confusion. \u201cI have no idea what you are talking about.\u201d Then, she pleaded, \u201cMake an offering to the Master of the Forest. The altar is to the far south.\u201dFrom her expression and attitude, she looked sincere.\u2018She probably is\u2026 sincere.\u2019She was probably set to be that way. Lindia was an NPC created to relay this information. In other words, she wasn\u2019t a real \u2018Oak Elf\u2019, but a fake created in a form that was suitably appropriate for this special hidden field, the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019.\u2018What I read with Eye of Perception\u2026 was probably just Lindia\u2019s set values.\u2019Lindia, who believed she was an elf, turned to dust and disappeared. I chuckled.\u201cIt\u2019s true that Oak Elves turn to dust and disappear.\u201dBut the execution was a little sloppy.\u201cA green-colored wind is supposed to blow at the same time.\u201dI turned around and tried looking around me, but I didn\u2019t find anything. Eye of Perception didn\u2019t pick up anything, either.\u201cIt\u2019s strange.\u201dI\u2019d been in a forest the entire time.\u201cWhy was there a burst of forest scent just because an elf regained consciousness?\u201dElves didn\u2019t generate bursts of forest scent. It was just that their bodies carried the strong scent of the forest in which they lived. Focusing on the details, something was definitely off.\u201cDoesn\u2019t it feel way too deliberate?\u201dI assembled all the pieces of the puzzle. The field I was standing in right now, this \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019, was a fake. It was a fake world sloppily created by someone\u2019s hand. A fake created with little attention to detail by someone who had only experienced the world through books.\u201cThat feeling of someone staring at me all this time\u2026\u201dThat, too, could be explained. If this was an artificially created fake field, there had to be someone managing it, and that someone had to be the person staring at me.\u201cIt bothers me.\u201d[You have recognized the \u2018magic effect\u2019 of the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019.][\u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 has begun to resist the \u2018magic effect\u2019.]I was suddenly struck with the feeling that all the strength was leaving my body.\u2018If they can make a fake of such enormous scale, then\u2026\u2019Such a feat would require a huge amount of magic power. That meant that whoever it was that made this fake world, they weren\u2019t an easy opponent.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dI hastily used the recovery potion I\u2019d bound to a slot. It felt like every drop of energy in my body was being sucked away. My head began to throb with a terrible headache.[\u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 has begun to determine the truth.][\u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 has begun to gaze at a distortion.]\u201cGugh!\u201dBlood surged from my mouth. It felt like I lacked the strength to break this special space.\u2018No.\u2019I could do it. There were many things I wanted to do. I was going to live proudly, with my head held up high. I wouldn\u2019t fall down here to something of this level.[\u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 reacts to the Player\u2019s \u2018strong will\u2019.]It felt like my eyes would burst, like every blood vessel was popping. I could tell.\u2018If I\u2019m unable to break this fake right now\u2026 I will die.\u2019There was another possibility.\u2018Or I\u2019ll have to live like this fake elf, believing the fake is real in this fake world.\u2019I might even become an NPC who would give a fake quest to the next Player who stumbled upon this place. I couldn\u2019t let that happen. I had to live in the real world, not a fake one.\u2018Break it\u2026!\u2019I clenched my teeth.\u2018Even this fake has to have its limit.\u2019The person who created this place probably didn\u2019t want to expose their limits. That was why they put \u2018easternmost\u2019 and \u2018westernmost\u2019 on the letters. It was to discourage anyone from going any further, where they would see the end of the field.\u2018They\u2019re definitely listening to my words.\u2019Making them falter, no matter how little, was good for me. My eyes felt like they were exploding, my head felt like it would crack open and my whole body felt like it was crumbling apart, but I endured the intense pain and smiled, looking as relaxed as possible.\u201cThis fake of yours that has such an obvious limit, I will break it for you right now.\u201d[\u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 has begun to crush the \u2018magic effect\u2019.][The condition to destroy the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019 has been satisfied.][The \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019 has begun to be destroyed.]I lost consciousness.* * *After who knows how long, I opened my eyes.\u2018I\u2019m alive.\u2019It looked like I was still in the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019. However, I could feel it with certainty.\u2018The range has become much, much smaller.\u2019Originally, this forest was so enormous and wide that Eye of Perception couldn\u2019t even tell me how large it was. But now, it was as small as the Village of Forest Dwellers. It felt like a garden cultivated to look like a very small forest.Eye of Perception picked up something\u2019s presence. It wasn\u2019t a person.\u2018There\u2019s something there.\u2019However, I didn\u2019t pay attention to whatever it was right away. There was something more important I had to do.\u201cI destroyed the fake.\u201dHonestly, it had been pretty dicey for me, but in any case, I destroyed it.\u201cBut you know\u2026\u201dYou\u2019re listening, right? Master of the Forest.\u201cNo matter how you think about it, you shouldn\u2019t be able to make such a huge field with your true ability alone.\u201dIf they were capable of that, they would have made the field with greater attention to detail. This was merely a shoddy imitation.\u201cWhich means\u2026\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t take long to explore this small space.\u201cYou must have gotten help from something.\u201dFor example\u2014\u201cLike an artifact that can dramatically increase your magic power.\u201dItems like that were sold at extremely high prices. Actually, they were so rare they weren\u2019t even sold on the market. When they did occasionally pop up, they were artifacts that could only be used one or two times at most.\u201cI wonder where such an artifact might be?\u201dIt was said that misfortune often turns into a blessing. After figuring out everything about this field, I could see what it was that I had to get here. I also knew it was an extremely valuable treasure, one that truly befitted a special hidden field found in a hidden field.\u201cBut huh, I can see it very clearly, you know?\u201dI moved forward. As I did so, \u2018it\u2019 appeared.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: The Final PuzzleThere was a website where countless people, starting with the Great Explorer Jackson, shared information they possessed. It was called \u2018Playpedia\u2019, and it was an open-collaboration encyclopedia site like Wikipedia.The habits and unique traits of each monster were naturally important subject matter for civil service students to study, and that was also a field I had a personal interest in.The \u2018Thin Hobgoblin\u2019 is a spirit monster that is capable of growth. This growth-type monster that has only been found a few times across all the servers experiences a total of three stages of evolution.Three stages of evolution: Thin Hobgoblin. Chubby Hobgoblin. And finally, Fat Hobgoblin.This monster with three evolution stages was considered fairly important.\u2018It appeared a total of four times, and only in Italy.\u2019The \u2018Fat Hobgoblin\u2019 appeared for the first time in Italy, where 400 people were eaten by it. The Fat Hobgoblin\u2019s second name was \u2018Maneating Hobgoblin\u2019.At the first and second stages, it is simply a \u2018slightly dangerous\u2019 monster that enjoys playing pranks. It is skilled at apparition or illusion magic. In addition, it excels at creating spatial distortions and likes to harass Players.The monster that appeared before my eyes was a \u2018Thin Hobgoblin\u2019.Once its true form is discovered, the Thin Hobgoblin is not all that difficult to defeat.And that was because\u2014\u2018When it panics, its intelligence drops to that of a young child\u2019s.\u2019They were skilled in apparition or illusion magic and had an uncanny ability to create spatial distortions. When I first realized that this place was a \u2018fake\u2019, the first monster that came to mind was this \u2018Thin Hobgoblin\u2019.\u2018Even for a special hidden piece, a Fat Hobgoblin wouldn\u2019t show up.\u2019Special hidden piece or not, this dungeon was still generated from the beginner-grade Seoul Station Dungeon. If a Fat Hobgoblin showed up here, I would have to find some way to escape, strategies or whatever be damned, because that would be the only way I could survive.\u2018No. I would die without even being able to escape.\u2019Such a monster was impossible to oppose with my current abilities. However, the monster that appeared before my eyes was a \u2018Thin Hobgoblin\u2019, a humanoid monster with blue skin. It was generally thin, but had a protruding belly like ET.\u2018That tiny horn on its head is the weak point.\u2019It had a head of dry and brittle, brown hair. Underneath was one big eye. It didn\u2019t have a nose or ears, but had a mouth even bigger than its single eye.\u2018The average level is around 31.\u2019Thin Hobgoblin LVL ?Even considering that this was a hidden field, its level shouldn\u2019t exceed 35. My current level was 29, and I had far better stats than other Players. It wouldn\u2019t be hard to fight a single Thin Hobgoblin. I just had to watch out for one attack.The Thin Hobgoblin that had revealed itself yelled, \u201cDon\u2019t lie!\u201dI grinned. \u201cWhat are you saying I lied about?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way a mere human can figure out where my treasure is.\u201dThe treasure the hobgoblin was referring to was a \u2018mana crystal\u2019. The one this Thin Hobgoblin was using was specifically an \u2018amplification mana crystal\u2019.\u201cHmm. Is that really so?\u201dI took one step closer to the Thin Hobgoblin. As expected for a monster that could talk, I was able to read its state with Eye of Perception.State: Panicked / Doubtful / DenialWhen Thin Hobgoblins panicked, they would become as smart as a young kid. This one was still immature and far from becoming a Fat Hobgoblin. If I couldn\u2019t face an opponent this easy, I would be putting the regressor name to shame.\u201cBut it\u2019s very clear to my eyes.\u201dI pointed in the direction of the Thin Hobgoblin.\u201cN-No! It can\u2019t be.\u201dThe hobgoblin stumbled three steps backwards. I took one step forward, but the hobgoblin didn\u2019t move.It screamed frantically at me. \u201cYou lying conman! If you come any closer, I\u2019ll cut out your tongue!\u201dThanks to its actions, I figured it out.\u2018So that\u2019s where the mana crystal is.\u2019For a Thin Hobgoblin to make a field of such scale, one as big as the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019, it would require a very high-quality \u2018mana crystal\u2019. Finding the location where it was hidden was, of course, impossible with my abilities alone. Even though my Eye of Perception was upgraded, it couldn\u2019t detect the exact location.Thin Hobgoblins tend to have an obsession over things they consider their treasures. Sometimes, that can be a worthless piece of shit, and sometimes, it can be a truly valuable gem. The Player must judge which of the two the \u2018treasure\u2019 is based on the situation.And I had made my judgment\u2014there, right under the hobgoblin\u2019s feet, was an \u2018amplification mana crystal\u2019.\u201cOf course I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cI-I knew it!\u201dAt that moment, I used the naive hobgoblin\u2019s relief as an opening to use Flash Step. There was no way a hobgoblin that wasn\u2019t even a Chubby Hobgoblin would be able to read Flash Step\u2019s movements.\u2018I can see it.\u2019I saw its little horn. That was the monster\u2019s weak point. I couldn\u2019t be slow to attack. If it detected danger, the hobgoblin would hide its horn under its skin, making it harder to defeat.\u201cH-Huh?\u201dI saw the Thin Hobgoblin\u2019s body instantly stiffen. Its muscles went rigid, freezing the hobgoblin in place for the slightest moment. As fleeting as the moment was, it was more than enough time for me. Holding the dagger well-suited for quick attacks, I made a powerful vertical stab.[Using the special skill Excellent Strike.]An additional 20% damage, plus\u2014[Critical hit!]This time, I was lucky and landed a critical hit. The Thin Hobgoblin and I weren\u2019t that far apart in level. If you took my stats into consideration, you could even say I was stronger than the Thin Hobgoblin.\u2018On top of that, I hit a weak point.\u2019And it was even a critical hit.\u201cUwagh!\u201dWith a short cry, the Thin Hobgoblin fell onto its butt and jumped back onto its feet.\u201cY-You fucking dickhead!!!\u201d squealed the Thin Hobgoblin.This. I just had to get past this crisis. The Thin Hobgoblin was probably channeling the mana crystal right now. It would be difficult for me to handle a blast from an amplification mana crystal capable of creating a field of this size.\u2018I have to believe in it. The Great Orc Warrior set.\u2019I had three Great Orc Warrior items on me.[Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Iron Armor.][Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Leather Shoes.][Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Leather Pants.]Of course, I had them all equipped, which triggered a \u2018partial set effect\u2019.Partial Set Effect: Defends against a physical attack the wearer cannot handle, limited to once per day. However, the wearer\u2019s level must not exceed level 30. If their level exceeds 30, a damage reduction effect will be triggered depending on the attack\u2019s power.A huge club was formed above my head.\u2018It\u2019s huge\u2026!\u2019It looked to be at least five meters large. This huge club was the lethal move the Thin Hobgoblin could use only one time.\u201cVroom, vroom! Hobgoblin Club!\u201dThe shadow of the hobgoblin club covered my head.\u2018I can\u2019t dodge anyway.\u2019It was a special attack I couldn\u2019t dodge with my current physical abilities. Even if I tried, I would still get hit. I had no choice but to defend.\u2018While getting hit\u2026 I\u2019ll also attack.\u2019I would believe in the power of the Great Orc Warrior set while unleashing a blow of my own, something like cutting off an arm to save the body.\u2018It\u2019s coming down\u2026!\u2019I clenched my teeth. It was possible there would be some momentary pain.Thud!From my head to my toes, I felt a massive impact.[Registering unmanageable damage.][Damage is negated once per day.]There was an impact, but I didn\u2019t take any damage from it. I just recognized mentally that I was attacked.\u2018If you use a technique this big\u2026 you\u2019ll leave an opening.\u2019I wouldn\u2019t miss it. I switched from my dagger to the sword. For this humanoid monster, even though their horn was their biggest weak point, the throat and heart were also significant weak points.\u2018The heart.\u2019It wasn\u2019t hard to hunt a Hobgoblin that had lost its cool.[Thin Hobgoblin has been killed.][EXP acquired.][42 Coins acquired.]Since I killed a hobgoblin, I was hoping that something like a Spirit Art Club, a pretty pricey item, would drop.\u2018Darn, it didn\u2019t drop.\u2019Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t drop. The notices continued.[The \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019 distortion has been recognized.][The hobgoblin controlling the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019 distortion has been eliminated.][The clear condition of the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019 has been satisfied.]I satisfied the clear conditions of the special hidden piece generated within the Seoul Station Dungeon\u2019s hidden piece.\u2018I can\u2019t be sent outside.\u2019Since I cleared the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019, I would be kicked out of this place after the rewards were distributed.\u2018I have to find the mana crystal.\u2019I pushed aside the hobgoblin\u2019s body and set to digging. The Item Shop had most things, but strangely enough, it didn\u2019t sell a shovel. In the end, I had to dig with my hands.[Distributing the clear rewards for the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019.]Once the rewards were fully distributed, I would be sent out.\u2018Before that happens, quick!\u2019An amplification mana crystal that could create a field of this scale would be worth at least $10 million in just three years. I had to find it.My hands didn\u2019t stop moving. It would\u2019ve been really nice if I had a digging skill or something like that.[500 Coins acquired.][1 level up point acquired.][One new trait for \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 has been added.][\u2018Hobgoblin Perfume\u2019 acquired.]I was so busy looking for the mana crystal that would become $10 million in three years that my ears didn\u2019t even register the notices.\u2018Where is it?\u2019Even after digging what appeared to be twenty centimetres into the ground with my bare hands, I couldn\u2019t see it.\u2018It shouldn\u2019t be buried any deeper than this.\u2019If the mana crystal was buried too deep, its power would be greatly weakened. No matter how outstanding the amplification mana crystal was, the hobgoblin wouldn\u2019t have buried it this deep.\u2018I messed up somewhere.\u2019Digging any further was a wasted effort. The tips of my fingers were bleeding, but I didn\u2019t give a damn. I straightened, looking around.\u2018What am I missing?\u2019And then, I realized something.\u2018It definitely said the clear conditions were satisfied\u2026 yet I\u2019m still in the dungeon.\u2019There wasn\u2019t even a remaining time indicator. That meant there had to be something else here.\u2018An exitless dungeon?\u2019A dungeon without an exit, one you couldn\u2019t leave even after satisfying the clear conditions. There was no way such a ridiculously difficult dungeon would have appeared already. I had to believe that.\u2018Exitless dungeons\u2026 could only be forcibly pried open by magic class Rankers seven years later.\u2019If this place really was an exitless dungeon, I would either die of starvation, loneliness, or wait for seven years. In any case, it would definitely be a shit situation.\u2018What am I missing?\u2019There had to be something.\u201cHuh?\u201dSome distance in front of me, I saw something on the ground.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dSomething very small with four limbs was standing on the ground like a person and staring at me.\u2018A squirrel?\u2019It was a squirrel, but the expression on its face was almost humanlike. The squirrel was looking at me with what I could swear was a pompous expression, laughing at me like a human.\u2018Was there ever\u2026 a squirrel like that?\u2019It didn\u2019t appear to be a monster, at least, and it was obviously not an NPC. Even for a person who had knowledge of the future, this squirrel was an unfamiliar existence.\u2018Seeing as Senia hasn\u2019t appeared, it\u2019s not a bug.\u2019The squirrel stood on two legs and held out an arm(?) to me, wearing an expression of \u2018I get it, so hand it over\u2019.\u2018Is it asking me to give it something?\u2019The squirrel spread out its other palm. When it did so, a huge mana crystal the size of a watermelon appeared over its tiny palm.\u2018The squirrel\u2019s using magic?\u2019It had an Inventory, or was using summoning magic. Or maybe it had something like its own innate squirrel ability. It was definitely no ordinary squirrel.It finally struck me.\u2018That is\u2026 the final puzzle of this place.\u2019And I had the feeling I could solve that puzzle.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: The Final Puzzle (2)\u2018That is\u2026 the final puzzle of this place.\u2019I walked to the magic-using, anything-but-ordinary squirrel. It didn\u2019t run away and simply watched me come with a self-confident expression.\u201cYou want to make a trade with me, right?\u201dThe squirrel appeared to understand me. It nodded. Even I had no idea what this squirrel was.[Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is too low to identify the target.]However, there was no mistake that it wanted to trade with me.\u2018Rather than giving it what it wants right away\u2026\u2019Lighting a slight fire up its butt wasn\u2019t too bad an idea.\u201cCould this be what you want?\u201dThe item I pulled out was none other than \u2018Black Yak\u2019s Lean Meat\u2019.The squirrel stomped in place in anger. Of course, it was a squirrel, so its stomps didn\u2019t produce any vibrations whatsoever.I heard a notice.[The \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 is watching you.]Well, look who we have here.\u2018Looks like a lot of Guardians who would normally be in the Italian server are pretty interested.\u2019The Merchant of Venice was a very prominent Guardian from Italy, the Guardian of a Player called the \u2018Queen of Water\u2019, Elliana.\u2018The Merchant of Venice, huh.\u2019I studied civil service, so I knew more about domestic Guardians than foreign ones. However, I still knew the basic disposition and traits of foreign server Guardians.\u2018He\u2019s probably watching to see how I can work this trade in my favor.\u2019The \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 was a Guardian who believed that being a successful negotiator and bargainer was a kind of achievement. The Queen of Water Elliana was not only an outstanding magician, but also a genius at commerce. It was often said as a joke that she held 30% of Italy\u2019s GDP.\u2018The Merchant of Venice made an appearance at the negotiation table that held a mere squirrel.\u2019The special hidden field in the Seoul Station Dungeon 2nd underground floor was indeed a very unique place.\u201cThen is it maybe\u2026 this?\u201dI pulled out the \u2018Hobgoblin Perfume\u2019 I just acquired, something completely useless for a squirrel. The squirrel shook its head roughly. It raised a cotton ball fist, upon which a yellow number popped up next to it.\u20181?\u2019It was trying to express itself with magic. The number one. It was probably saying that this was my last chance. I grinned.\u201cAh\u2026 I honestly think this is a loss for me.\u201d I dithered and dallied. The yellow number next to the squirrel\u2019s fist grew bigger.[1!]It was like the squirrel was yelling, \u2018This is your last chance! Your last, I said! Hurry! Hurry and gimme what I want!\u2019 From the way it folded its arms and huffed at me, I apparently had something it really, really wanted.\u201cThink about it. You\u2019ve gotta admit, it was really difficult for me to get something this special.\u201d[Taking out a strawberry from the \u2018Fruit Bundle\u2019.]I picked up a strawberry from the Fruit Bundle safely stored in my Inventory. The squirrel\u2019s eyes widened. The number changed from \u20181\u2019 to \u2018!\u2019. For most monsters, a \u2018!\u2019 meant that you had properly pulled their aggro.[Taking out a banana from the \u2018Fruit Bundle\u2019.]\u201cAh. I really hate to let this stuff go, since it\u2019s so good. And I can\u2019t even eat the thing you\u2019re offering, let\u2019s be honest.\u201d[Taking out a clementine from the \u2018Fruit Bundle\u2019.]\u201cThis is also really delicious\u2026\u201d[Taking out a blueberry from the \u2018Fruit Bundle\u2019.]The squirrel hopped in place. The yellow \u2018!\u2019 mark changed to a red \u2018!!\u2019.Its eyes were glued to the fruits in my hands. Where the fruits went, the squirrel\u2019s gaze dazedly followed.\u201cBut if you really want them\u2026 guess I have no choice. Wanna trade?\u201dThe squirrel nodded vigorously. It was rubbing its palms. The self-confidence and arrogance I\u2019d seen at first was gone.\u201cCan\u2019t be helped, I guess. Alright. Let\u2019s trade.\u201dIt was a ridiculous trade, but one that couldn\u2019t be seen as just ridiculous.\u2018There\u2019s definitely\u2026 something about this place.\u2019It wasn\u2019t like the \u2018Shot Table Dungeon\u2019 the Giant of the Sunset created to nurture Choi Sung-gu. It wasn\u2019t a place made by some Guardian by investing Coins, but a real hidden field existing within the System itself.\u2018A Thin Hobgoblin coincidentally made Fruit Bundles\u2026 in a place like this?\u2019Fanged Boars dropped \u2018Fruit Bundles\u2019, which had made me a little more sure that this was a fabricated space.\u2018Was that really a coincidence?\u2019There was a very high chance it wasn\u2019t. Disguising the Fruit Bundles as a \u2018mistake\u2019 of the Thin Hobgoblin was a deliberate, intricate trick played by the System. If I hadn\u2019t acquired this Fruit Bundle or had already eaten it, it was possible I wouldn\u2019t be having this trade with the squirrel right now.\u2018If I wasn\u2019t able to trade with the squirrel\u2026 I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to get out of here.\u2019The chance of that was very high.\u2018I hope that this is the key to the exit.\u2019I heard a notice.[Squirrel proposes a trade.]A trade window opened up.\u2018Eh?\u2019It was my first time seeing a squirrel that could activate a trade window. To be fair, it was also my first time seeing a squirrel that could use magic, so this much was par for the course.[Trade complete.][\u2018Amplification Mana Crystal\u2019 acquired.]The trade was completed nice and sure with a trade window.[Amplification Mana Crystal]A mana crystal that amplifies magic power.Grade: UniqueAmplification value: ?Remaining uses: 2/3The amplification value was marked as \u2018?\u2019, which meant it was an item of a level that I couldn\u2019t fully grasp at my current level.\u2018It also has two uses left.\u2019I obtained an item that would be worth $10 million in three years. My goal for three years later was originally $1 million, but now, I had $10 million.The Merchant of Venice seemed satisfied by my trade as well.[The \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 is greatly satisfied by your trade.][The \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 has decided to watch your progress.]On top of that, they gave me a special item.[The \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 has gifted you a \u2018Forced Exchange Scroll\u2019.]Senia, who had been watching from start to finish, let out a long breath.\u2018He finally\u2026 did it.\u2019She thought that Kim Hyukjin would be able to do it somehow, and he really did it. The Guardians were seriously making a ton of noise right now. The Guardians who had revealed their True Names were doing their best to maintain their silence, but they had no intention of leaving her channel, and the anonymous Guardians were sending so many messages it was hard to read them all.\u2013Isn\u2019t he level 29 right now?\u2013He\u2019s 29, but I think he got a level up point?\u2013What? Then he\u2019s level 30?It was an issue of huge importance for the Guardians in the Korean server. Level 30. The point at which a Player chose their exclusive Guardian. Even out of all the Players in Korea, Hyukjin\u2019s Playing was obviously exceptional. He was showing them a Play that was impossible to replace, a Play of a completely different level.\u2013We\u2019ll only know the exact details after the Intermediate Administrator checks.\u2013Hurry and tell us what exactly his rewards are!While the rabble were making a fuss, the \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 sent Senia a 1,000 Coin sponsorship. He was demanding one thing from her\u2014he wanted her to publicize what rewards Hyukjin got.[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 has sent the Intermediate Administrator a 1,000 Coin sponsorship.][The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 has gifted the Intermediate Administrator a \u2018Pause authority\u2019.]Thanks to that, Senia was once again able to use the pricey \u2018Pause authority\u2019.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin. May I ask a few questions?\u201d* * *When the world turned black and white, I already guessed what Senia would do. It was obvious she was using a \u2018Pause authority\u2019 to ask me what rewards I got, so I already had an answer prepared.\u201cYou\u2019re going to ask about the rewards I got, yes?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dI shrugged. There wasn\u2019t much to hide right now. Or actually, this was a moment where I couldn\u2019t hide things.\u201cFirst of all, as you probably know, I got one level up point.\u201dMy level right now was 29, so with this, I would become level 30.\u2018The Guardians must be\u2026 going wild right now.\u2019There were quite a few Guardians who had made both overt and covert attempts to recruit me. In the current situation, I was a one-of-a-kind, limited edition. There were Guardians to replace Guardians, but no Player that could replace me.For now, I moved to a different topic to amp up the anticipation a little.\u201cA new trait was added to Eye of Perception. I\u2019ll briefly set information about Eye of Perception to public. You can also scan me if you want.\u201d[Eye of Perception]Type: Innate AbilityBasic acquisition conditions:Sixth SenseCalm Observer\u2019s EyeAdditional acquisition condition:Overcome the death sentence of \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019Overcome painDetailed explanation:Eye of Perception is an eye of \u2018intuition\u2019, meaning the user gains concrete knowledge about objects in the outer world through their sense of intuition.

That alone was already more than sufficient a reward, because it was also something I could make good use of later in the \u2018Gwanghwamun Dungeon\u2019.\u201cOn top of that, I got a mana crystal.\u2019I shared the information about the mana crystal. Senia\u2019s wingtips trembled. It was possible she could see the \u2018amplification value\u2019 that was marked as a \u2018?\u2019 for me.\u2018Looking at her reaction, it must be an incredible item after all.\u2019It would take at least three years for the world to become aware of this crystal\u2019s true value. This thing was like a surefire winning lottery ticket.\u201cAlso, I got Hobgoblin Perfume.\u201d[Hobgoblin Perfume]A perfume hobgoblins apply when playing tricks.

However, overly large movements will cancel the spirit art.Effect: Transparency spirit artUses: 1This Hobgoblin Perfume, one of the items that would later undergo stringent management by authorities because it could be used for crime, was another of my gains today.On top of that\u2014\u201cThe Merchant of Venice also gifted me a special item.\u201dI intentionally publicized this as well.[Forced Exchange Scroll]When a Trade Window is active, this scroll can forcibly complete the exchange.If someone put an expensive item into the trade window by accident, I could use this item to forcibly steal the item. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t really the type who liked these kinds of items. It was\u2014how should I put it?\u2014the minimum amount of decency left in me. However, I mentioned this item because I was about to level up.Because I was getting to level 30, the point at which I would choose my Guardian.\u2018Now, then. You all heard that, didn\u2019t you, Guardians?\u2019The Merchant of Venice gifted me a special scroll like the \u2018Forced Exchange Scroll\u2019, even though he only started watching me today.\u201cWell, then\u2026\u201dI had drawn things out long enough. I\u2019d probably excited a lot of people with this. I could only guess how many Guardians were gathered in Senia\u2019s channel.\u201cShall we level up?\u201dJust as I said that, something strange started happening to Senia.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: Five NotesSomething strange started happening to Senia.\u2018Huh? No way, that\u2019s\u2014!\u2019I knew what was happening.Bzzt\u2013 bzzzzzt\u2013!There was a buzzing noise as Senia\u2019s body began to twist and distort. Parts of her body faded and reappeared repeatedly.\u2018It\u2019s server overload.\u2019Senia\u2019s body became more and more faint.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin\u2026!\u201dSenia was urgently trying to say something to me, but then her body completely disappeared from sight. The Intermediate Administrator who had been exclusively streaming me, Senia, disappeared.\u2018She was kicked out by server overload\u2026\u2019There was one thing I could be sure about. This moment, the moment I turned level 30, was being watched by countless Guardians.\u2018It\u2019s not common for five Guardians to compete to send messages to begin with.\u2019Whether it be six or ten Guardians that were interested, the number that could directly send messages to me was limited to five. The fact that all five slots were filled meant that at least five Guardians might be sending messages to me very soon.\u2018Senia must not have an advanced enough System to handle an excessive number of Guardians yet.\u2019It was a little tricky to explain, but if I put it in human terms, it was like not having enough server capacity. I heard that professional human streamers used extremely high spec computers for smoother broadcasting. Intermediate Administrators were the same.\u2018She wasn\u2019t able to handle the deluge of Guardians and was kicked out.\u2019Streamers getting kicked out like this happened in several very famous incidents.\u2018It also happened in the Battle of the Maldives that Yeonseo played a big role in.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a super common occurrence, but also not super rare.\u2018I need some time.\u2019It went without being said that I wouldn\u2019t choose my Guardian right now. That was extremely good content for me, as well. I decided to put it off for the time being, since it would take a little time for Senia to recover her System and get back online. I could also guess what she was trying to shout at me earlier before she blinked out.\u2018She was probably panicking out of worry that I might choose my Guardian without her there.\u2019I chuckled.\u2018Was she so worried that she might lose her quality content?\u2019Senia and I had a you-use-me, I-use-you relationship. Such a relationship where the Player and Intermediate Administrator sought to profit off of each other wasn\u2019t all that unusual. I didn\u2019t believe the horseshit rumor that there were Streamers out there who were devoted to their Players. Nothing changed the fact that they were streaming Plays with our lives as collateral and fulfilling their greed. In the Tutorial, some of them also killed multiple people who hadn\u2019t been able to adapt to the Tutorial.\u2018A you-use-me, I-use-you relationship is perfect.\u2019It wasn\u2019t bad\u2014after all, I could use Senia more than she could use me.I emerged from my thoughts and looked around.\u2018The Pause has been canceled.\u2019Notices came in at the same time.[\u2018Amplification Mana Crystal\u2019 acquired.][The Special Hidden Field \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019 has been completely cleared.][The exit for the Special Hidden Field \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019 is being created.]I saw the squirrel in front of me.

The way a [?] appeared above its head was a little cute.\u201cJust what are you, really?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a monster, nor was it an NPC. It was a squirrel that understood human speech and could even use what I assumed was magic.\u201cHow can your cheeks be so full?\u201dAnother few question marks appeared. This time, there were three of them.[???]The squirrel tilted its neck, scratching its cheek like it didn\u2019t understand what I was talking about.\u201cWell, whatever.\u201dI didn\u2019t think I could get more out of it with further questioning. I decided to stop with this.\u2018Everything was paused until just now.\u2019During a Pause, other than Senia and me, everything turned to black and white and the world was temporarily put on hold. That was the kind of authority that had been used.\u2018Up until the Pause, the squirrel\u2019s cheeks were flat.\u2019But after the Pause ended, its cheeks were round and full.\u2018Which means, it wasn\u2019t affected by the Pause.\u2019It wasn\u2019t affected by the Pause and filled its cheeks with the fruits I had given it. I had no idea what this little rascal was.Exclamation marks appeared over the squirrel\u2019s head.[!!!]It had discovered the \u2018Warp Crystal\u2019 that would take us to the exit.[Exit]The Warp Crystal that links the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019 to Seoul Station Exit 2.

The person managing the Players in the \u2018Seoul Station Exit 2\u2019 was no longer a policeman.There\u2019d been a big change.I could only be shocked.\u2018It\u2019s been\u2026 three months?\u2019When I checked my phone, which was starting to get reception again, I saw that it was already September. It was far hotter than the time when the Tutorial Field first appeared.\u2018It\u2019s become insanely hot.\u2019I took a look at the news through my phone and found out that a record-breaking heat wave had begun. It was the worst heat wave ever measured.\u2018Three months\u2026\u2019That in itself was shocking, but my headache was just beginning. There was a mountain of missed calls logged in my phone.[Noona][Mom][Choi Sung-gu][Noona][Mom]\u2026[Shin Yeonseo][So Yoohyun][Noona]A feeling more terrifying than what I felt when I killed the Lycanthrope or went through the insane Magic Troll hunt during the Tutorial traveled down my spine. Cold sweat beaded on my forehead.I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dI started walking home.\u201cI should probably\u2026 call, right?\u201dI might give my mom a heart attack if I called right now, so I decided to call my sister first.\u201cUh\u2026 noona?\u201d\u2013 \u2026I couldn\u2019t hear her voice. The call simply ended with a beep. I scratched my head sheepishly.\u201cMm.\u201dMy sister didn\u2019t end the call just now out of anger. I could say that with 120% certainty.\u2018Guess she burst out into tears.\u2019There was no doubt about it; she started sobbing and didn\u2019t want me to hear, so she quickly ended the call.I also got a call from Yeonseo just then, right on cue. She hit me with a flood of words.\u2013Huh? What the? You actually picked up? What happened? You\u2019re alive, right?\u201cOf course.\u201d\u2013Holy, shit. It took you three months to clear that place? Holy shit. That\u2019s nuts. But anyway, anyway! What a relief that you\u2019re alive! I was a little worried, you know! A-Anyway! I have something super important to tell you, so let\u2019s meet up asap when you\u2019ve got the time!Apparently, Yoohyun was with Yeonseo. I didn\u2019t see it happen, but it seemed he had ripped the phone out of Yeonseo\u2019s hands. In the background, I heard shrieks of \u201cHey! That\u2019s my phone! Give it back! If a muscleman like you is so rough with it, it\u2019ll break!\u201d\u2013H-Hyungnim! May I inquire if your body is in good health?\u201c\u2026\u201dJust where did he learn that weird way of speech from?\u201cI\u2019m fine, yeah.\u201d\u2013Hyungniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiim!!!I also heard Yeonseo\u2019s voice.\u2013Hey! Muscle pig! Tears are enough! Why\u2019re you putting your snot all over my phone! So fucking dirty!For the people of this changed world, three months was apparently a very long time. In any case, I ended up returning to the world after three months.I went home by taxi to the DMC Riverview Xi, our new home where Mom, my sister, and Sunhwa were at.\u201c\u2026Hm?\u201dMy family was in better condition than I thought. Of course, everyone\u2019s eyes were red and swollen from crying, but they were relatively fine, to the point that I wondered if their attention had been diverted to something else.\u201cWhat the?\u201dWhy was\u00a0that\u00a0here?\u201cOppa!\u201dSunhwa came running. The way she dashed over and jumped into my arms was kind of like a puppy greeting their owner. My sister was pointedly avoiding my gaze. Mom came to the front door and greeted me.\u201cWhat a relief that you\u2019re alright, Hyukjin.\u201d\u201cOf course I am.\u201dHer eyes reddened a little, but it wasn\u2019t the soap opera I was dreading.\u201cWhy is this guy here?\u201dA yellow exclamation point appeared above its head.[!]This brat, this unidentifiable\u00a0squirrel,\u00a0showed up along with my family. Sunhwa picked it up and put it on her palm.\u201cOppa. This little guy is super cute.\u201dWhen I looked closer, I saw that things like sunflower seeds were scattered across the table. They had been purchased to feed this squirrel.\u201cWe named him Darongi!\u201d\u201c\u2026Darongi?\u201dFor whatever reason, the squirrel on Sunhwa\u2019s palm once again put on pompous airs and puffed out its chest.

    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: Five Notes (2)It looked like a Pause.\u2018It\u2019s not that it looks like a Pause, but that\u2026\u2019It actually was a Pause.\u2018Even though I\u2019m not in a dungeon but in a neutral field\u2026\u2019It wasn\u2019t common for a \u2018Pause\u2019 to take effect during everyday life. First and foremost, this \u2018Pause authority\u2019 was known to be an extremely expensive authority, one that both Guardians and Streamers couldn\u2019t squander. So I was surprised that a \u2018Pause\u2019 state was triggered by using such an authority.\u201cSenia. What\u2019s going on?\u201dWhen I turned around, Senia was there.\u2018She really\u2026 would have become a huge success if she was a little more eloquent.\u2019I thought I\u2019d become accustomed to her appearance from seeing her so many times, but no. I had never seen anyone as beautiful as Senia. The strange aura and feeling of grace she exuded didn\u2019t feel like they were a part of the mortal world. This angel Streamer was a better fit for the word \u2018beautiful\u2019 than any other person I\u2019d ever seen.\u2018Well, it has nothing to do with me.\u2019I knew she was pretty, but her beauty didn\u2019t have much to do with me. Whether my Streamer was pretty or not was no concern of mine. The reason I made a contract with Senia was because she was easy to manipulate. And of course, Senia had recognized that I was good quality content.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin.\u201dI already knew what Senia would say. She was going to ask if I had chosen my Guardian.\u2018Her channel is closed right now.\u2019She wasn\u2019t streaming me to the Guardians.\u2018She\u2019s scared shitless that I might\u2019ve chosen my Guardian already.\u2019I couldn\u2019t say for sure, but there was a high chance I was the Player receiving the most attention in the beginner period. Such a Player reached level 30, which meant the time to select a Guardian had come. Of course such an event would inevitably draw a great deal of focus and interest from the Guardians.\u201cHave you selected a Guardian?\u201d\u201cYeah, of course.\u201dOf course I didn\u2019t.\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia\u2019s wingtips trembled.\u201c\u2026Why did you choose your Guardian without the Intermediate Administrator around?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t hear any notices saying the Intermediate Administrator had to be present for me to pick my Guardian.\u201dSenia\u2019s face reddened a little. She looked a little mad.\u2018I just wanted to see how she would react, but\u2026\u2019As expected, my prediction was correct.\u2018She\u2019s mad?\u2019For a Streamer as stoic as her, the fact I could visibly see that she was angry meant she was extremely enraged.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin is very intelligent. So why did you use a moment while I wasn\u2019t streaming to continue Playing? And something as important as the Guardian selection?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI felt pressure from her, a formless energy pressing me down. It felt similar to the \u2018fear\u2019 ability used by boss monsters. Right now, Senia was agitated.\u201cAnswer me. Allow me to inform you that I may make an extreme choice depending on your answer.\u201dTechnically speaking, Senia had no grounds to be angry. If I had chosen my Guardian at level 30, that was my natural right.\u2018So for her to become that mad despite that\u2026\u2019Why was she able to get angry without just cause?\u2018It\u2019s because she looks down on me.\u2019I had ten years of experience that others lacked. Right now, those ten years were a valuable wealth of experience you couldn\u2019t buy with any amount of money. I knew what a great number of Intermediate Administrators thought of Players and how they treated them.\u2018Well, Senia\u2019s still on the easygoing side.\u2019It was only because Senia was Senia that she was able to grit out such a polite warning. A nasty-tempered Intermediate Administrator might have threatened me while throwing in f-bombs. There really were a lot of Intermediate Administrators like that.\u2018In any case, it\u2019s because she sees me as a way to make money.\u2019That was why she reacted like this. I didn\u2019t dislike it. To begin with, Senia and I needed each other and were using each other. So I had to make my position more clear and define our relationship in black and white. That was what I, at this point in time, decided was necessary.I chuckled. It was a very deliberate laugh.\u201cTo borrow your words, I am very intelligent.\u201dUp until now, I had resolved many difficult situations. I also brought a conflict with another Intermediate Administrator, Neptune, to a good resolution. Senia had seen all of it from start to finish.\u201cBut I really can\u2019t figure out what the extreme choice you mention could be.\u201d\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin and I have signed an exclusive contract. I have given up on a great deal of profit to exclusively stream you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because each and every action of mine is profitable for you. Don\u2019t try to make it sound like you\u2019ve sacrificed a lot for my sake.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia, you beginner Streamer. Haah. Looking at this pretty woman who was reduced to speechlessness with a few words actually made me feel a little regret. She was such a rookie that it wouldn\u2019t be odd for her to be eliminated from the competition between Streamers.\u201cAnd say things right. You\u2019ve given up on a great deal of profit?\u201dI snorted again with an intentional sneer, as if to tell her not to say BS.\u201cYou don\u2019t remember your channel getting overloaded?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYour personal server wasn\u2019t able to handle the sudden influx of Guardians.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cWas it because you were good at talking? Because you made things fun? Because you yourself make good content?\u201dNo, that wasn\u2019t it at all. The answer was already determined. It was because\u00a0I\u00a0was good quality content.\u201cYou yourself know that\u2019s not the case. You\u2019ve experienced a flood of Guardians so intense your personal server couldn\u2019t handle it and you\u2019re still able to say you gave up on profit? Do you have any conscience?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t think I would already be carrying out the \u2018Intermediate Administrator Domestication\u2019 that was still a good five years in the making. Several Rankers said that this process was absolutely necessary. If you didn\u2019t make the hierarchy between you and your Intermediate Administrator black and white, many cases of getting dragged along at the Intermediate Administrator\u2019s behest would occur later down the line.\u2018There were a lot of cases of that, yeah.\u2019An Intermediate Administrator had one goal. Coins. That was their first and last goal. They weren\u2019t all that interested in something as insignificant as a Player\u2019s wellbeing. Their eyes were fixed only on whether a Player could make money or not. The more time went on, the more intense the streaming war between the Intermediate Administrators became, the more apparent that fact would become.\u201cYou and I have an exclusive contract, and we\u2019re in a business relationship. You recognize that, yes?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dSenia was still kind and pure for a Streamer. After all, there were a lot of Streamers who stubbornly shouted, \u201cSue me!\u201d and refused to listen. At the very least, it was possible to talk to Senia.\u201cBut in such a situation, you spoke like you were threatening me.\u201dUp until now, most beginner Players were scared of Intermediate Administrators. That was because most Intermediate Administrators were far more powerful than Players. Because Players didn\u2019t fully understand this System, they couldn\u2019t make real complaints to their Intermediate Administrators.\u2018But not me.\u2019I continued with a serious expression.\u201cIf you use coercive force on me or vent your unjustified rage on me one more time\u2026\u201dI gave it right back to her.\u201cKeep in mind that I\u2019m the one who might make an extreme choice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI put the final nail in the coffin.\u201cThere are no Players to replace me, but there are many Intermediate Administrators who can replace you. Intermediate Administrators who would pay the huge contract violation fee for me.\u201d* * *[Channel #19207 has been opened.]Channel #19207 was the channel run by the angel Intermediate Administrator Senia, a Streamer who was focusing her attention on a single Player.Senia spoke.\u201cA Pause is currently in effect. I would like to express my sincere thanks to the certain Guardian who gave me the Pause authority.\u201dShe didn\u2019t reveal who that \u2018certain Guardian\u2019 was.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin will now begin his Guardian selection.\u201dGuardian selection, and the 1st advancement that would come alongside it. This was the turning point for a Player that occurred when they reached level 30.I heard a stream of notices.[Level increased.][Current level: 30]They were all notices I knew about.[The number of direct messages you can receive from Guardians is limited to five.][Choosing the Guardians that can send you a direct message.]\u2018It\u2019s\u2026 taking a while.\u2019It was just a guess, but the Guardians were probably fighting tooth and nail right now in order to secure the right to send me a direct message. Basically, in order to \u2018contact\u2019 me.[Guardian messages will be sent to you in the form of a \u2018note\u2019.][A note has arrived.][A note has arrived.][A note has arrived.][A note has arrived.][A note has arrived.]Hyukjin trembled unconsciously.\u2018I immediately got five notes.\u2019Could this really be called luck?\u2018No. This is absolutely not luck.\u2019Luck alone could not produce such a result. It was hard work in addition to luck, with a heaping spoonful of talent on top. By now, I was sure of it. I had enough talent to make the average genius look like an ordinary Joe. I just didn\u2019t know how long this talent would last, or what my limit of growth was.\u2018Five.\u2019The past me wouldn\u2019t have even imagined this would happen.\u2018There are plenty of Players who can\u2019t even get contacted by one Guardian.\u2019But I received a whopping five messages.\u2018From what I know\u2026\u2019I combed through my memories. It wasn\u2019t a topic my civil service studying had covered thoroughly. You couldn\u2019t know how many contacts a Player received unless they revealed it themselves, so it was hard to tell exactly.\u2018But from what is known, four was the highest.\u2019There hadn\u2019t been any Players\u2014at least from what I knew\u2014who had received notes from five Guardians.\u2018Check the notes.\u2019I checked the names of the Guardians who won the battle and were able to send notes to me.[A note from the \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 has arrived.][A note from the \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 has arrived.][A note from the \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 has arrived.][A note from the \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 has arrived.][A note from the \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 has arrived.]Two Guardians who were very famous in the Korean server, one who was extremely famous in the Italian server, and one who was immensely famous in the US server. And then, there was one Guardian even I didn\u2019t know that much about.\u2018Five?\u2019But it was a little unexpected.\u2018It\u2019s a little weird.\u2019The Guardian I had been expecting didn\u2019t send a message.\u2018This choice\u2026 wasn\u2019t in the picture I was drawing.\u2019I didn\u2019t think that Guardian would be eliminated from the competition. The Guardian I was thinking about was none other than the \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019.\u2018Did the Nameless Observer\u2026 not choose me?\u2019That could be the case. Because if the Nameless Observer didn\u2019t choose me, I wouldn\u2019t be able to hear the notice about it.\u2018For now\u2026 let\u2019s check the messages one by one.\u2019They were all famous Guardians. I was confident that no matter who I chose, I had a promising future ahead of me.\u2018As long as I\u2019m not an early bloomer.\u2019It all hinged on me being a \u2018true genius\u2019 with no early growth limit. After reading the notes, I thought long and hard. I thought over and over about which of the five Guardians who had sent messages to me I would choose.After a long period of time, Senia asked, \u201cWhich Guardian will you set as your contracted Guardian?\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: 1st Advancement\u201cWhich Guardian will you set as your contracted Guardian?\u201dI already decided on the answer to Senia\u2019s question. It was a decision I had made a very long time ago, ever since I decided I wanted to live like a real person and resolved myself to living more successfully. From that moment on, I made preparations for this choice.I remembered very clearly. When I was sitting in the conditional safe zone that was the bus, I heard Guardian notices for the first time.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is carefully watching your actions.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 has begun to take an interest in you.]That time was still vivid in my mind. The 1st wave of Goblin attacks began with the Primordial Fog, and all of the other people on the bus died.That was when the \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 granted me a bonus.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 wishes to bestow upon you an \u2018Open Beta Bonus\u2019.][\u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 has taken effect.]You could say that was the moment my Playing began. The Calm Observer\u2019s Eye I got back then fused with Sixth Sense to become the Eye of Perception I had now.\u2018But\u2026\u2019The important thing was this.\u2018Back then, Senia wasn\u2019t in the bus.\u2019Not just Senia, but no other Intermediate Administrators had existed in the world at the time. I could say that for sure because after I was bestowed an Open Beta Bonus from the Nameless Observer, I received a notice like this:[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 looks at you with interest.]And only then did I receive the following notices:[The Tutorial Quest is beginning.][ The \u2018Intermediate Administrator\u2019 is appearing.]The Intermediate Administrators began to show up only then.\u2018In other words, the Nameless Observer was watching the situation even before the Streamers were streaming.\u2019No Guardian, no matter who, could observe Players without a Streamer. That was a widely accepted theory. According to what I knew, that was how it was. But the \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 was an existence that completely flipped that theory on its head.Senia asked again.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin. Which Guardian will you set as your contracted Guardian?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSo why did the Nameless Guardian not send me a message? Were they really pushed out by the other Guardians?[True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain][Herdsman of Las Vegas][Lady of the Scales][Whispering Devil][Merchant of Venice]I opened the notes, which only I could see.\u2018The True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain.\u2019The note held things I already knew the gist of. He started by praising himself as the strongest heavenly demon in the world and the true master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain, and that he would turn me into the most outstanding martial artist alive, or something of that nature.\u2018They\u2019re all amazing Guardians, it\u2019s true.\u2019Even though I didn\u2019t know the Whispering Devil that well.\u2018But\u2026\u2019I still couldn\u2019t understand.\u2018Why did the Nameless Observer not send one?\u2019I remembered another clue.[Distributing rewards for clearing the quest \u2018Turtle Nest\u2019.][7,000 Coins acquired.]I was sure of it. I knew that quest wasn\u2019t issued by an Intermediate Administrator.\u2018The quest was cleverly disguised to look like a quest issued by an Intermediate Administrator.\u2019But that, too, was ridiculous. Because to describe it in our terms, Guardians were \u2018attention whores\u2019. When they sponsored Players and Streamers, they received a great deal of attention. The more skilled Streamers actually gently coaxed Guardians into giving them a ton of sponsorships.\u2018If there\u2019s really any Guardian who isn\u2019t like that\u2026\u2019I judged it was the Nameless Guardian. After all, the adjective in their name was \u2018nameless\u2019. From every angle, it looked like \u2018anonymity\u2019 was this Nameless Guardian\u2019s fundamental attribute.While I was thinking, I also checked the note I got from the \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 again.[Note from the Whispering Devil]I will be straightforward. I will make you into the Demon King. If you choose me as your contracted Guardian, you can become the Demon King. Think long and hard.The note made me sure of it.\u2018This guy\u2019s a total scammer.\u2019He wasn\u2019t called the \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 for nothing. Demon King? His whole argument fell apart at Demon King. If this guy was really the Demon King\u2019s Guardian, I would probably be somewhere in the level 40s by now. Nothing was known about the Demon King\u2019s Guardian, but the Demon King had to be out there somewhere.\u2018You can\u2019t believe everything a Guardian says.\u2019You couldn\u2019t believe things that weren\u2019t explicitly stated. Unless they stated things clearly, like saying they would grant some skill or title, such vague words were merely empty promises. To put it simply, a scam.With the notes floating in front of me in the air, I read through them again and again.\u2018I do have to choose someone\u2026\u2019I needed a contracted Guardian to grow far more efficiently. The more they had to give, the more of a pushover Guardian they were, the better it was for me. In exchange for the fun I would give them, they would sponsor me.\u2018But what is it?\u2019I had the niggling feeling that something\u00a0other\u00a0was between the notes.\u2018How should I put it?\u2019It was a strange feeling, like there was something I shouldn\u2019t miss between the notes. It was like there was an unwritten message among them, but it was something that couldn\u2019t be seen with the eyes.\u2018I should put more focus on Eye of Perception.\u2019I looked through the notes not with my physical eyes, but with Eye of Perception. I just had a feeling that was what I should do.Senia asked once again, \u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin. Have you made a decision?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dI shook my head.\u201cEach and every one of them are such great Guardians that I really don\u2019t know how an ant like me would dare make a decision.\u201dSure enough, the notices came in with lightning speed.[The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 is pleased.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is feigning modesty.][The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 is earnestly waiting.][The \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 nods at your composure.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 detests you.]Countless Guardians were watching right now. But it wasn\u2019t right for me to make my choice here and now. I didn\u2019t know why; I just felt it.\u2018Eye of Perception.\u2019This niggling feeling of something else, this feeling like I was missing something\u2026\u2018Show me something\u2026 whatever it is.I captured a sort of hazy shimmer between the notes.\u2018There\u2019s something\u2026 there.\u2019I was sure of it.\u2018There.\u2019I focused. I focused with everything I had. And then, a notice came in.[Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency has increased.][Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency: 2]The proficiency that hadn\u2019t gone up the whole time finally increased, and with it, I was able to see something new.[Note from the \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019.]With the increase in proficiency, Eye of Perception picked up yet another note.\u2018There it is\u2026!\u2019My heart began to thump.\u2018The max is originally five Guardians.\u2019For ten years following the beginning of Playing, countless people rose to the position of Rankers and became famous across the world. But not a single one of those Rankers was \u2018chosen by six Guardians\u2019. I didn\u2019t know how it was for the Demon King, but officially, five was the max.\u2018But\u2026 I got six.\u2019Moreover, one of them was a hidden note, a special note I wouldn\u2019t have seen if Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency hadn\u2019t gone up.\u2018It\u2019s all good now.\u2019My answer was decided from the very beginning.\u201cI\u2026\u201dMy choice was the \u2018Nameless Guardian\u2019.Each of the Guardians who weren\u2019t selected sent messages, saying they were disappointed, or detested me, or that they honored my choice. But I didn\u2019t really pay much attention to the messages. They were thirsty for good quality content, so as long as I Played properly, they would never be able to discard me. If they liked my Playing, then that was that\u2014their fundamental characters would never allow them to hate me.\u2018The truly important thing is\u2026\u2019That I made my contract.[A contract with the \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 has been completed.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 has been set as Player Kim Hyukjin\u2019s contracted Guardian.][A new class will be set in accordance with the contract with the \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019.]I\u2019d been waiting for this. I wondered what class the \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 would give me.[You have been given the class \u2018Onlooker\u2019. Accept the class?]It didn\u2019t look like a very good class.[Onlooker]A class that is characterized by observing all things. No matter what happens, the Onlooker sees watching in the background without stepping forward as a virtue and simply stays one step removed from all things.Detailed explanationThe description was nothing special. From the description alone, there was no trashier class than this. I didn\u2019t even activate the detailed explanation, because I never intended on accepting this class.\u2018I believe in you, Nameless Observer.\u2019I had taken a gamble of sorts with this choice, a gamble I judged had a very high chance of success.\u2018Even if I had chosen someone other than you, I would have been able to live a perfectly satisfactory life.\u2019There was no doubt about that. By my former standards, I\u2019d already succeeded plenty. I even had a mana crystal that would fetch $10 million in three years.\u2018However\u2026\u2019It was because I couldn\u2019t be satisfied with that, because I wanted to go even higher, that I took this gamble. That was why I went all in. Everything I did was for this moment.[Use the High Advancement Assist Scroll?]This was an item that only one lucky person could purchase. The items in the Hidden Item Shop were limited to one in stock. I was only able to purchase this by killing Gold Turtles and satisfying the Hidden Piece linked to them to get a ton of Coins.\u2018It was all for this moment.\u2019Opening the shop had cost 50k Coins, and purchasing had required 40k. When using this ridiculously pricey item, you had to do it boldly.[Using a High Advancement Assist Scroll.]It wasn\u2019t a low scroll, or a medium scroll, but a\u00a0high\u00a0one. I didn\u2019t know how much it could increase the grade of my class. It was random.[The class \u2018Onlooker\u2019 has been upgraded to the higher grade class, \u2018Observer\u2019.]\u2018Please, get upgraded just one more time.\u2019I put my hands together and prayed. Normally, \u2018High Advancement Assist Scrolls\u2019 would make your class jump in grade twice or thrice.\u2018Please\u2026!\u2019But I didn\u2019t hear any additional notices.\u2018Once?\u2019It was over with this?\u2018Even though it\u2019s a High Advancement Assist Scroll?\u2019I\u2019d been blessed by RNG all this time, but this time, it failed me.\u2018Ah\u2026 is this the end?\u2019Even the name didn\u2019t look all that impressive.\u2018Observer. Observer, you say\u2026\u2019I\u2019d never heard of a class like this. I prided myself on knowing about quite a lot of hidden classes, but it was a completely new class to me.\u2018It at least has the Guardian\u2019s name in it, but\u2026\u2019It was based on the Guardian\u2019s name, but the name alone didn\u2019t give it much merit.[You have been given the class \u2018Observer\u2019. Accept the class?]The milk had already been spilled. Refusing the class granted by the Guardian at this point wasn\u2019t a good choice. It could spoil the mood of the contract bearer, aka the Nameless Guardian, from the very first day of our contract. The dice were tossed and I was the one who had planned this, anyway. I couldn\u2019t do something foolish here and destroy it.\u2018It can\u2019t be helped.\u2019Though it was a shame, I had no choice but to accept.[You have advanced to the \u2018Observer\u2019 class.][The Player\u2019s information is being updated.][The update will take a slight amount of time.]I opened up the explanation about \u2018Observer\u2019 right away.[Observer]A class that is entitled to observe the world in its entirety. Observe all things in-depth. You will see a new path.Detailed explanationThe description was at least a bit better than \u2018Onlooker\u2019, because at least there was a hopeful message of \u2018you will see a new path\u2019 at the end.\u2018I\u2019ll need a little more time to fully adapt after the update is finished.\u2019I opened up the detailed explanation. When I saw what was written, my mouth dropped.\u2018This is\u2026 the Observer class?\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: 1st Advancement (2)\u2018This is\u2026 the Observer class?\u2019It was a completely new class to me, one that no one had Played during ten years of Playing.I opened up the detailed explanation.[Detailed Explanation]The Observer must maintain the \u2018position of an observer\u2019. The Observer avoids excessively proactive Playing.0% EXP in direct hunting0% Coin acquisition in direct hunting0% item drop rate if Observer makes the killThe Observer can determine the domain he observes.Can use the class skill \u2018Observer\u2019s Domain\u2019.

(+detailed explanation)Current proficiency: 1\u2018Observer\u2026\u2019Did \u2018must maintain the position of an observer\u2019 mean that I had to sit back and only observe? I had to look into it a bit more.\u2018Direct hunting\u2026\u2019I applied what I knew. \u2018Direct hunting\u2019 basically meant that I would be cutting down at least 50% of the monster\u2019s HP.\u2018And if I make the final blow, the item drop rate is 0%.\u2019The class was just as the name described.\u2018It really is an observer\u2026\u2019Up until now, there didn\u2019t seem to be many positives, despite this being a special class I acquired by using a High Advancement Assist Scroll.\u2018No. That can\u2019t be.\u2019There were definitely classes out there that looked unimpressive on the outside but were capable of enormous power. Observer had to be one of those classes. I didn\u2019t have concrete evidence for this conviction; it was simply a feeling I had from the Playing I\u2019d done so far, something like the oft-mentioned \u2018intuition\u2019.\u2018Let\u2019s check the class-exclusive skills.\u2019I could read the detailed explanations of both skills.[Detailed Explanation]Skill name: Observer\u2019s Domain (Current proficiency: 1)Skill effect:Creates a field where \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 takes effect.For party Play, EXP +50%Range: 5 metersIt increased the EXP gain when Playing in a party and created a field linked to \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019. That meant I had to find out what Observer\u2019s Eye was.[Detailed Explanation]Skill name: Observer\u2019s Eye (Current proficiency: 1)Skill effect:Flow Perception: Visualize the flow of nature.Action Duplication: Copy the actions of an observation target (currently cannot be used).Title Duplication: Use the title and similar abilities of an observation target (currently cannot be used).Ability Share: Share an ability with designated observation targets (currently cannot be used).Conditions for use:Must possess the ability \u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019.Must be contracted with the \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019.Must be in a private area set for Playing.I was speechless for a moment.\u2018At least right now\u2026 it\u2019s terrible.\u2019I couldn\u2019t call this \u2018awesome!\u2019 right now. It didn\u2019t even have a class-exclusive attack or defense skill that were so common. Plus, I would actually get no EXP if I hunted a monster directly.But there was a silver lining, and that was the \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 that appeared to be the core of the Observer class.\u2018To summarize\u2026\u2019I felt like I knew what kind of class Observer was. It was a class where you carefully observed a certain target. The target of observation had to be within the \u2018Observer\u2019s Domain\u2019, and I would use \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 to examine them.\u2018I think it means I can then copy the abilities of the target being observed.\u2019The current proficiency was 1. The higher the proficiency became, the more abilities I would be able to unlock.\u2018Not just abilities, but even their titles.\u2019Even if I didn\u2019t go out and earn titles of my own, once Observer\u2019s Eye grew in proficiency, I would eventually be able to use the titles of others.\u2018And later on\u2026\u2019I could even share my abilities with others.\u2018I\u2019d be able to see a Fist King using Single Hit Finisher.\u2019The class had an intermediary playstyle that would allow me to share the abilities of those within my domain, giving the right ability to the right person. At the moment, that was what I had figured out about the \u2018Observer\u2019 class.\u2018Or for example, Yeonseo using Platinum Shield.\u2019Of course, I didn\u2019t expect it to be an omnipotent skill. I wouldn\u2019t be able to arbitrate everything like I wanted.\u2018But\u2026\u2019The profit I\u2019d be able to earn by sharing a useful skill or innate ability at the perfect time was likely something I couldn\u2019t even imagine.\u2018To make that happen, I need to make sure my party members have excellent abilities to begin with.\u2019That condition was already partially fulfilled. Kim Sunhwa. So Yoohyun. Shin Yeonseo. These three alone were party members who were top of the line no matter where they went, and they all wanted to party with me.I purposefully said aloud, \u201cThe problem is\u2026 leveling up.\u201dI was now level 30. The stretch between level 30 and 40 was called the Hell Phase. Mindlessly trying to push through the level 30-40 period was a fool\u2019s errand. Of course, it was something that could be settled with hard work, but it would take at least five years to get through this stretch with effort alone.\u2018Let\u2019s think about it slowly.\u2019This class called Observer was one with very obvious pros and cons.\u2018A class that can\u2019t shine in the beginning.\u2019But later?\u2018Its value will be unlimited.\u2019Looking at it now, that future was a bit far-off. How exhausting was it to get less EXP from killing monsters? How was I supposed to get through the Hell Phase?\u2018But\u2026\u2019Strangely enough, I was starting to feel confident that I could do it. I couldn\u2019t express exactly why that was.\u2018I think I can do it.\u2019I felt like I could do it. Or rather, to be more precise\u2014\u2018Feels kinda like it fits me perfectly\u2026?\u2019I didn\u2019t know why, but a sense of inexplicable confidence that I had gotten a class that fitted me like a glove was blooming within me.\u2018For now, let\u2019s give it a shot.\u2019I said aloud, \u201cI thank the Nameless Observer for giving me such a good opportunity.\u201dBut when I spoke, an interference I\u2019d never even imagined occurred. When I said \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019, it came out as wordless buzzing.\u2018Wha\u2014?\u2019It seemed the Nameless Observer didn\u2019t want to reveal that they were my contracted Guardian.\u2018That\u2019s why they\u2019re nameless.\u2019There was also a condition like the following in order to use \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019:Must be in a private area set for Playing.At least from what I could tell right now, it seemed the Nameless Observer was fundamentally the type of Guardian who didn\u2019t like to reveal themselves to the public. Matching a Guardian\u2019s disposition was also important.\u201cIn order to carry out your will and not disappoint all the esteemed Guardians, I vow to do my utmost to Play.\u201dThose words were a sort of pretense that was cemented over a long period of time. The great majority of Guardians liked to hear words like that during a Player\u2019s advancement. I didn\u2019t get any real notices, but I was sure that many Guardians were finding me laudable right now.[The Pause has been deactivated.]The world began to regain its color.I was lying on my bed. I got the \u2018Observer\u2019 class, and there were a lot of things I had to do moving forward. I also recalled the threat my sister gave me earlier.\u2013Pull something like this again, and\u2026 I\u2019ll kill you.Her words were pretty savage, but her expression made it seem like she was on the verge of tears, so I just said \u2018ok\u2019. I said I was sorry for being late, but my sister just whirled around and went into her room. It was the same as when she ended the call. Apparently, she really hated showing me her tears. Really, she was such a softie at heart.\u201cOi. What\u2019ve you been chomping on this whole time?\u201dThe squirrel that got a name from me, \u2018Darongi\u2019, was clinging to the ceiling. To my fascination, he was able to scuttle about perfectly fine while upside down, like a frickin\u2019 cockroach.A [!] appeared over his head.I didn\u2019t know what it was, but it seemed my older sister or Sunhwa gave him some dried fruits or something. Startled by my words, Darongi jumped down from the ceiling onto my stomach. Then, he covered his mouth and looked around warily, almost like he was guarding against someone stealing his food.\u201cNo one\u2019s taking it from you. Would anyone take something you\u2019ve been eating?\u201dAs if reassured by those words, Darongi nodded and snuggled up to my side.A [\u2669\u266a] mark appeared above his head, and after burying himself between my arm and ribs, he proceeded to fall asleep.[zzZ] [zzZ] [zzZ]The snoozing marks kept popping up, and honestly, it was a bit cute.Knock knock.The person who knocked and came in was Sunhwa. Wearing loose pajamas, she was petite and cute today as well. Sometimes, it was hard to tell whether she was an elementary schooler or a middle schooler. Though to be fair, being in your first year of middle school wasn\u2019t that far off from being an elementary school student.\u2018Is it \u2018cause we overcame the crisis of death together?\u2019I felt myself growing fond of her, and every time I saw her, I had the feeling of wanting to protect her somehow, like it was good that she became my little sister.\u201cOppa. I got a call from Yeonseo unnie.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she call me directly?\u201d\u201cShe said you wouldn\u2019t pick up\u2026\u201dOh right, I had my phone on mute. When I checked my phone, I found a whopping seven missed calls.\u201cDoes Yeonseo unnie like you, oppa?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this about all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cIt seemed like she was too obsessed with you.\u201d\u201cShe must have something important to say.\u201dCome to think of it, before I chose my class, Yeonseo did say she had something important to talk about.\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t accept it yet. Even though Yeonseo unnie is pretty\u2026!\u201dShe said some nonsense, and then I saw:Summary: Slight Brother ComplexShe went from a \u2018Weak Brother Complex\u2019 to a \u2018Slight Brother Complex\u2019. Should I be calling this\u2026 progress?TN: Previously, I had her at \u2018slight\u2019 brother complex, but weak was the more accurate word, so it has been changed.\u2018Well\u2026 it\u2019s puberty.\u2019With time, her brother complex would probably fade on its own. I didn\u2019t think about it that hard.I called Yeonseo, who yelled at me as soon as she picked up.\u2013Hey! Why\u2019d you pick up so late!\u201cMy phone was on mute. What\u2019s up?\u201d\u2013Can\u2019t you be a bit better at picking up?\u201cI\u2019m ending the call if you have nothing to say.\u201d\u2013W-What? W-Wait a sec! I do have something important to say.I listened in amusement. Yeonseo was the one who needed to say something, not me.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u2013So basically\u2026Yeonseo began to talk. After hearing what she had to say, I had a hard time saying it was (in my opinion) all that important.\u2018That\u2019s right. It\u2019s about the time\u2026 when the Players Association starts becoming more active.\u20193 months had already passed since I went into the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019. It was about time for the Players Association to start taking an active role. They were convening Players from all over the country and giving them \u2018Player Licenses\u2019, and soon, they would start assigning \u2018ranks\u2019.\u2018Various rules. Tacit agreements. The distribution of items or profit. Big guilds sponsored by conglomerates.\u2019This was a time when such things were starting to get hammered out. Mankind was becoming more prepared to accept new tech a little more proactively.\u2013The 1st Player Convention is happening tomorrow afternoon. We should be able to gain a lot of information there, don\u2019t you think? They say there\u2019ll be a lot of open positions in big guilds. You can even get contracted with a conglomerate and get a high annual salary! You\u2019re going tomorrow too, right?Come to think of it, it was already almost September 13. The 1st Player Convention was the first convention within Korea. Just as I was about to respond, Darongi sprang upright like a meerkat. I thought he was repositioning himself, but he then jumped off the bed and ran off. At the same time, I heard the doorbell go off.I knew that at some point, someone would come to our house. Actually, I knew it would happen before the \u2018Player Convention\u2019.\u201cHey. Wait a bit. Someone came over, I\u2019ll call you back.\u201dI hung up the call with Yeonseo.\u2018That person is\u2026!\u2019This was something I had long-since predicted, but I didn\u2019t know it would be the person who I now saw at our door.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: 1st Players ConventionSeptember 13. The day of the 1st Players Convention.It was the first formal gathering of Players held by the \u2018Korean Players Association\u2019 established with Sungshin\u2019s massive support. You could call it a symbolic event.\u2018The president of Sungshin knows me.\u2019I could guess he had done a lot of background research on me. I knew that, and it was also something I had induced.\u2018That\u2019s why I knew he would make contact with me, but\u2026\u2019I just didn\u2019t know the person who would come would be \u2018Kim Kangchul\u2019. I still remembered all too clearly. On the night of April 26, 2028, he was the person who came to my door and personally delivered my results.\u2013No Talent.He said the following:\u2013\u201cI\u2019m sorry to be the bearer of bad news. We performed your re-examination, but it was determined that you had no talent.\u201dGiving me a slightly pitying look, he told me to study hard for my civil service exam and gave me a box of luxury drinks.\u2018But the Players Association in its early days was almost like a subsidiary of Sungshin\u2026\u2019After some time passed, the Players Association became independent from Sungshin, becoming a government-affiliated institution. It was the majority opinion that a single company could not monopolize the enormous value that \u2018Players\u2019 and \u2018new tech\u2019 held. As such, a new Players Association was established with the same name as a government agency through talks with Sungshin.\u2018Kim Kangchul was the Head of PR of the Players Association back then.\u2019Something was a little weird.\u2018It was announced that civil service employees with career experience were picked out specially to hold positions in the Players Association.\u2019A position in the Players Association gave better annual salary and treatment than other civil service jobs. In any case, you were supposed to be from civil service to get a Players Association position.\u2018But at this point in time, Kim Kangchul is a team leader in Sungshin?\u2019The public was told that civil service employees with experience were picked out for positions in the Players Association, but a person working as a current employee of the conglomerate Sungshin became the Head of PR in the Players Association ten years later?\u2018It doesn\u2019t add up.\u2019Kim Kangchul came to see me. That fact alone was enough for me to come to a conclusion.\u2018It was all a big fat lie.\u2019Both the current Players Association and the one ten years later were under Sungshin\u2019s control. It was like people said; there really was no one you could trust but yourself.\u201cHello, I am Team Leader Kim Kangchul.\u201d\u00a0Read first at L i g h t n o v e l r e a d e r . o r gRight now, he called himself the leader of the newly created \u2018Player Scouting Team\u2019. He also said he was part of the \u2018New Tech Division\u2019, or something like that. I checked his information.[Non-Awakened]Name: Kim KangchulAge: 38State: Curious / Dubious / Confident / FascinatedDisposition: Ordinary / Ambitious / Full of DriveSummary:Ordinary Person Hungry for SuccessPillar of the HouseholdIs a non-Awakened.The disposition/state/summary only show the most representative and can change according to the situation.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible.\u2018Curious, dubious, fascinated, huh.\u2019He was definitely curious about me.\u2018An ordinary person hungry for success.\u2019According to his summary, for now, he didn\u2019t seem like a bad person. I also didn\u2019t remember him having committed any evil acts.\u2018Also, he\u2019s the pillar of the household.\u2019He was one of countless Korean breadwinners working hard to provide for their family. The man who gave me a great amount of information with his appearance alone had something very shocking to say.\u201c\u2026And so, the President would like to offer you the guildmaster position of Taeguk Shield.\u201dHe offered me the guildmaster position of \u2018Taeguk Shield\u2019, of all guilds. In the early days of Playing, Taeguk Shield was a guild that experienced a crazy amount of growth thanks to being carried by Sungshin.\u201cHe must have had a very good impression of me.\u201d\u201cYes, he did. He thinks very highly of you.\u201dAccording to the current standards, the proposal itself wasn\u2019t bad.\u201cHe has offered you an annual salary of $200k. The terms regarding item and Coin acquisition are written in detail in the contract.\u201dOnly then did I realize why Kim Kangchul was feeling confident.State: Curious / Dubious / Confident / FascinatedHe came offering a staggering $200k annual salary. Even by the standards of ten years later, even if you passed the civil service exam, your initial salary would begin at $30k. The salary he was offering was almost a whopping 7x the civil servant salary, and this was just the initial pay.\u201cOf course, benefits are also included, and even though it is a little tricky to give you exact numbers now, the rate of salary increase will be very high.\u201d Continuing, Kim Kangchul said, \u201cI can tell you right now that such an outstanding offer is the first and last of its kind. What would you like to do?\u201d\u201cDo I have to make a decision right now?\u201d\u201cNo. However, we would like you to make a decision as fast as possible.\u201dTeam Leader Kim Kangchul seemed to have thought I would accept the offer, no questions asked. To be fair, for the standards of ordinary folk, the conditions were indeed incredible. People hadn\u2019t quite figured out what \u2018new tech\u2019 really was yet, so a $200k annual salary was ahead of its time.Before leaving, he informed me that a gathering of Players was being held tomorrow and gave me an invitation ticket. With that, my meeting with Kim Kangchul ended.\u201cGoodbye. I will contact you shortly.\u201dAfter seeing Kim Kangchul off, I chuckled.\u2018Just $200k?\u2019Kim Kangchul aside, I was sure that Song Kiyoung had already seen the value of \u2018new tech\u2019. And yet, $200k was all he could offer. There was probably no malice in it, but it felt like he was taking me a little too lightly.\u2018Though, well, I wouldn\u2019t have accepted even if it were $2 million and not $200k.\u2019I already had an \u2018Amplification Mana Crystal\u2019 in my possession, an object that would command a $10 million price tag in three years. Actually, it wasn\u2019t a matter of money. My decision also had to do with my class, as well as my contracted Guardian.\u2018The Nameless Guardian\u2026 doesn\u2019t want me to do things in the limelight.\u2019I didn\u2019t know what the \u2018Nameless Guardian\u2019 wanted from me. But for now, I knew they wanted me in the back rather than the front, to Play while maintaining the position of an \u2018observer\u2019.\u2018For now, I\u2019ll go along with that.\u2019The guildmaster of \u2018Taeguk Shield\u2019 would command a great deal of authority, but the position would also come with many responsibilities. I would be tied to Sungshin. It might help with the things I was trying to achieve, but it was more likely that the position would hinder me.\u2018I\u2019m going to Play at my pace, my way.\u2019\u00a0Read first at L i g h t n o v e l r e a d e r . o r gI decided to participate in the 1st Players Convention tomorrow. I already knew what would happen. I would also be able to meet the Typhoon, Jo Sunghyun, at the convention.\u2018If things go like in the past\u2026 I\u2019ll also be able to decide exactly how to proceed with my Playing.\u2019I started preparing for tomorrow.* * *\u201cSenia. Senia. Senia. Senia. Senia.\u201dNo matter how much I called her, she didn\u2019t answer. The darned angel wasn\u2019t streaming me at the moment, it seemed. There was something I absolutely had to tell her before going to the convention, but I couldn\u2019t reach her. I had no choice but to make an appointment with Yeonseo, since Yeonseo said she was with her Streamer, Roa.\u2018In that respect, Senia should learn a little from Roa.\u2019Roa was marvelously diligent. It wasn\u2019t like Yeonseo was doing a dungeon clear or anything, but Roa was still streaming her. It\u2019s because Roa was so earnest that she was successful later.It was 11 p.m. We agreed to meet in front of Hongdae University Station, Exit 9. Even though it was pretty late and it was Wednesday night, the place was bustling. But among the crowd, one person was radiating an obviously overwhelming presence.\u201cHyuuuuungnimmmmm!\u201dThat person was So Yoohyun. With his nearly 2-meter tall massive frame and biceps the size of an average adult\u2019s head, the sight of him barreling towards me was almost like a furious wild boar\u2019s charge.\u2018Ah, shit.\u2019Getting a bad feeling that he would pull me into a crushing bear hug, I dodged him ever so slightly. Though I managed to barely avoid him, I ended up in another minefield.\u201cI thought you died!\u201dI dodged Yoohyun, but Yeonseo appeared out of nowhere next to him. She had come up to me extremely quickly, so I guessed she used \u2018Heavenly Demonic Flying Step\u2019. As true as it was that I\u2019d had my guard down, she found an opening all too easily. Simply put, I was hugged by Yeonseo. Against my will.\u201c\u2026Oi. Not letting go?\u201d\u201cI was super worried, okay? I thought you died. Do you know how nervous you made me by being unreachable for three months?\u201dAnd then, she broke into a bright grin, like she could finally feel relief after physically confirming I was alright. I felt extremely strong feelings from her.State: Relieved / Happy / JoyfulHold on, we were honestly not that close. We weren\u2019t even lovers, nor were we blood-related. Why in the world was she so happy? But I was certain that Yeonseo\u2019s feelings weren\u2019t a pretense or a lie. What I was feeling through Eye of Perception was her sincerity. Her sincerity\u2026 wasn\u2019t all that bad.\u2018Feels strange.\u2019I never would have thought that there would be people other than my family who would be so happy about my life or death.\u2018She\u2019s already gone up to level 32?\u2019She made it to level 32 without any strats, increasing her level twice in three months. Two level ups in the Hell Phase in just three months was actually a lot, since the stretch between level 30-40 was extremely difficult to break through.\u2018Yoohyun is also level 32.\u2019Geniuses were certainly geniuses, alright. Sunhwa was also level 31. All three of them would be able to level up much faster if they used the strategy with me.\u2018But first, I have to get through tomorrow well.\u2019At around 11 p.m. at night, we went to a small bar near Hongdae.The time I spent with Yoohyun and Yeonseo wasn\u2019t that bad. No, it wasn\u2019t just \u2018not bad\u2019, but enjoyable.\u2018It feels pretty great.\u2019I hadn\u2019t been able to enjoy this kind of leisure before. Yeonseo, whose face was a little red from drinking beer, laughed from the belly.\u201cAh, I dunno. It just happened, ok!\u201dThey were telling me about when Yoohyun fell flat on his face, and both of them looked truly happy. I didn\u2019t have to look with Eye of Perception. Even with my bare eyes, they looked really happy.\u2018This is nice.\u2019It wasn\u2019t anything special, just a casual drink with friends. This trivial and ordinary experience was completely new to me.\u201cHold on, hyungnim. It wasn\u2019t like that. There just so happened to be a slippery trap right there\u2026\u201dAfter some time, Senia finally showed up. Seeing as Yeonseo and Yoohyun didn\u2019t react, she set it so that only I could see her.\u2018Roa is probably working hard to stream, even now.\u2019It seemed Senia came over after seeing that.\u00a0Take notes from Roa. The more diverse your content, the better. There are definitely viewers out there who want to see not just bloody Playing, but also this sort of trivial everyday life. Watch and learn, Senia.Yeonseo waved at us.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to drop me off! See you tomorrow!\u201dThe sight of her walking off humming to herself in perfectly good cheer was a bit cute, but it didn\u2019t even occur to me that she would need to be dropped off. Even though this was a beginner Shin Yeonseo, Shin Yeonseo was still Shin Yeonseo. What could possibly endanger her?\u201cHyungnim! See you tomorrow!\u201d\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201dI turned around. Senia was there. Actually, the reason why I met up with Yeonseo was to call Senia. Now that the fun times were over, it was time to get down to business.\u201cSenia.\u201d\u00a0Read first at L i g h t n o v e l r e a d e r . o r gFrom here on out, this was the real issue at hand.\u201cListen carefully. Tomorrow, I\u2019m going to participate in the formal convention hosted by the Players Association.\u201dJust as our business talk began, Senia opened her mouth.\u201cPlayer Kim Hyukjin.\u201dSenia brought up something I hadn\u2019t even hoped to hear from her, in very commendable fashion.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: 1st Players Convention (2)I put my phone to my ear. Of course, there wasn\u2019t anyone on the line. Other people couldn\u2019t see Senia right now. If I spoke to the empty air, people would think I was insane, so I pretended to be on a call while I walked home.Senia spoke first.\u201cAllow me to notify you that my channel is currently closed.\u201dIn other words, the Guardians weren\u2019t watching us right now. It appeared that Senia had taken my earlier words to heart. Always showing the same stuff with the same method would reduce both the excitement and the enjoyment. Streaming to the Guardians with a slightly more diverse, slightly different pattern was the job of a Streamer and a sign of their skill.\u201cIt sounds to me that you want to coordinate with me for the event tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI am simply considering more diverse directing methods.\u201dThat\u2019s right. That was the way.\u2018For now, just tickle the Guardians\u2019 curiosity.\u2019The Players Convention was a \u2018man-made gathering\u2019 being held in the Korean server for the first time. It was a different sort of spectacle from System-made Playing. There had to be quite a lot of Guardians who wanted to see it, and it would be even better if there were some kind of conflict or dispute thrown in.\u2018She stopped filming, huh.\u2019Among Streamers, this move was called \u2018Sudden Cut\u2019 or \u2018Sudden Cliffhanger\u2019, but those terms weren\u2019t yet established.\u2018After exciting their curiosity, she\u2019ll start streaming again tomorrow.\u2019Moreover, there were probably a few things she wanted to consult me about right now, which was something I wanted to do as well.\u2018Senia, you\u2019ve really grown.\u2019It felt like just yesterday she was frozen and helpless against the Streamer Neptune, but she was picking things up quickly. At this rate, she would probably be able to earn her keep pretty well.\u201cDid you meet with Player Yeonseo in order to call me?\u201d\u201cCorrect. Because Yeonseo was with Roa.\u201dSenia had become a lot smarter. She was even able to figure out why I met up with Yeonseo.\u201cThere must be a reason why.\u201dI nodded. \u201cAs you know, tomorrow\u2019s the Player Convention. This isn\u2019t a scenario set by the System, but a choice humans have made in response to the new world.\u201dWith that, our conversation continued for about one hour.\u201cUnderstood, even though what you say is far too detailed, even for something you have deduced through Precognitive Dream.\u201dSenia looked a little doubtful. Over one hour of conversation, I gave Senia a lot of tips. I told her in advance what would happen tomorrow and what she had to do.\u201cLook a little further ahead, not just at the here and now. It\u2019s best to use your combined experience of various situations to predict what will happen before they happen. Don\u2019t you think you\u2019ll be able to make good quality content that way?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSenia seemed to be struck speechless. In any case, our conversation wrapped up nicely. All that was left was for Senia to do her job as a Streamer, and for me to do mine as a Player.We reached my house, the DMC Riverview Xi. One way or another, Senia kind of ended up bringing me home.\u201c\u2026Understood. I shall wait and see if the scenario Player Kim Hyukjin predicts is correct.\u201dHer words carried a slight edge of warning, perhaps because I had talked to her in such a lecturing tone. It was reasonable for her to feel displeasure. But what could she do? She might have improved a little, but she was still a newbie Streamer. From the viewpoint of someone who had ten years of experience, she was far too shabby a Streamer. There was so much she had to learn.\u201cYou seem a little doubtful.\u201d With a grin, I provoked her. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re scared, forget it.\u201d\u201cAre you provoking me right now?\u201dYeah, I am.\u201cThink of it however you please.\u201dAfter thinking for a long time, Senia said, \u201cWhat will be the conditions of the bet?\u201dAs expected of our angel Senia, she was really easy to bait.\u201cOpen the intermediate-grade Item Shop for me.\u201dThat was obviously not possible. I was still only level 30. To open the intermediate-grade Item Shop, you had to be over level 40. Even I knew it wasn\u2019t possible.\u201cThat is an excessive demand. It is impossible.\u201d\u201cThen how about one time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI proposed something entirely excessive at first, then followed it with a more practical condition.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cForget it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201c\u2026I accept.\u201dThat\u2019s right, of course you would. I knew you would accept.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked.\u201cI will tell you that if I win the bet.\u201dI almost snorted. Guess I didn\u2019t need to hear what it was, since I would be winning anyway. I went up the elevator, which reached the 10th floor.Ding!\u2013The door is opening.Number 1004. Our house. The place where Mom, Noona, and Sunhwa were waiting. I suddenly felt happier. It was like I was slowly getting a grasp on my future. It was a feeling I hadn\u2019t been able to experience before. A sense of achievement, a desire to challenge the trials ahead, and\u2026 the happiness of coming back home.Every time I saw our house, all of the changes that had occurred struck me anew.\u2018Let\u2019s do our best tomorrow, Senia.\u2019* * *The Players Association made under Sungshin\u2019s lead was in the DMC, the \u2018Digital Media City\u2019. It was within walking distance of our house.\u2018As expected, the Association was put here.\u2019Later on, even once the Association became a government institution, the building was still in the same spot.\u2018It\u2019s a government institution in name, but there were a lot of rumors that it was actually a tool of Sungshin.\u2019I was able to verify that those rumors were true after seeing Kim Kangchul. It didn\u2019t have that much to do with me, but it did make me a little bitter. The phrase \u2018Republic of Sungshin\u2019 didn\u2019t exist for nothing.\u2018That means they\u2019ll probably do rank measurements today, too.\u2019The ranks would be evaluated with a method that was absurd by future standards. It was fine to see the \u2018Player ranks\u2019 determined now as completely meaningless.\u2018The concept of \u2018talent plates\u2019 hasn\u2019t been established yet.\u2019There was no concept of talent plates, or magic, for that matter. The ranks would be set by evaluating physical factors. For example, things like running or grip strength. They would measure Player ability with the same methods used to evaluate athletes, a ridiculous method according to future standards.\u201cYes. I do not wish to receive a rank evaluation.\u201d\u201cA rank evaluation can be very favorable for the Player. Many avenues will be opened up to you if you gain a high rank. Even if you get a low rank, it won\u2019t be of any harm to you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cIf you do not want to go through the rank evaluation, are you okay with being given an F-rank for the time being?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s fine.\u201dWhat use was there in getting a rank that would be obsolete soon anyway? I didn\u2019t come here to submit myself to long-distance running or push ups.\u201cHyungnim! I got an A!\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201dLike the Fist King and Sword Empress they were, Yoohyun and Yeonseo received A\u2019s from the very beginning. Seriously, people who could succeed in whatever they did sure were on a different level. Sunhwa also went through the rank evaluation with them, but she got a C.It was 2:20 p.m. The convention would start at 3 p.m. The Main Hall on the 12th floor was already bustling. The four of us went down to the cafe on the 1st floor to wait.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, it\u2019s alright.\u201dI patted the sullen Sunhwa. Figures, how would they even evaluate her tanking qualities, anyway? They could hardly stab her arm with a knife or take a hammer to her head. Such a result was inevitable.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, C is better than my F.\u201dI didn\u2019t say that it was because F was the rank given if you refused the evaluation, but it still wasn\u2019t a lie. What kind of score would I get?\u2018I think I\u2019d also get an A.\u2019I wasn\u2019t sure, and I didn\u2019t have that much interest in a rank evaluation done with a completely meaningless method.\u201cReally? Oppa got an F?\u201dYeonseo and Yoohyun\u2019s eyes widened as well.\u201cCome on, that\u2019s ridiculous. You, an F?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, hyungnim!\u201dOf course it was. I chuckled in spite of myself.\u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s ridiculous. Because they used a ridiculous evaluation method, only the Players in combat classes will have gotten a high rank.\u201dApparently greatly comforted by my words, Sunhwa slurped the chocolate shake we\u2019d ordered with enthusiasm, as if she could forget the shock of getting a C-rank with the taste of chocolate.Yeonseo grinned widely. \u201cThat\u2019s true. Well, nothing more needs to be said if you got an F. The rank measuring method is a hundred percent wrong. A monster like Kim Hyukjin getting an F? Gosh darnit. Here I was, getting all happy for nothing that I got an A.\u201d\u201cSeriously, hyungnim. This rank has zero meaning.\u201dWhile we were waiting on the 1st floor, I constantly checked the Players coming through. One of the Players I saw was a man with a huge physique no inferior to Yoohyun, and a flashy tattoo covering his right arm. His whole aura was screaming, \u2018Mess with me and you\u2019ll get hurt\u2019.\u2018The Fire Bear, Kim Taechun.\u201dHis current level was 28.\u2018What a funny summary.\u2019Summary: Self-Proclaimed Predator Seeking PreyHe was one of the \u2018starting pieces\u2019 for what would be happening today.\u2018Where\u2019s Jo Sunghyun?\u2019I kept looking, but I didn\u2019t see him. Instead of Jo Sunghyun, someone ran helter-skelter through the 1st floor.\u201cUwah! I was almost late!\u201dAfter seeing us, he immediately ran our way. His breathlessness made him seem a little out of shape.\u201cGoodness, look who it is. Isn\u2019t this our mighty hero who was unreachable for three months?\u201dState: Gladness / Having Fun / ReliefChoi Sung-gu also joined the fray. From what I heard, Sung-gu also got much closer to the others, or something like that. Sunhwa had introduced him, and they had gone through the Seoul Station Dungeon a few times together. They\u2019d also cleared a few gates together.\u201cCan I kiss you to celebrate your safe return? Wh-whoa there. Alright, sorry, sorry. C\u2019mon man, do you really need to give me the death stare?\u201dIt seemed Sung-gu was still under the protection of the Giant of the Sunset. I couldn\u2019t read his information with Eye of Perception. However, since he had used the \u2018Vulcan Body Tome\u2019, had the \u2018Person of Fire\u2019 title, and three months passed, with his degree of talent, he had probably grown quite a lot. And my prediction was correct\u2014he said he was level 31. He was indeed high level.It was now 2:40 p.m. Sung-gu said, \u201cI\u2019m already late, so I think I won\u2019t be able to get the rank evaluation. Was it on the 12th floor? Let\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dAs I thought, what I remembered was correct.\u2018Jo Sunghyun.\u2019That person was coming in. The young man coming through the 1st floor revolving door was tall and had a slender frame. He was wearing a school uniform and looked to be a high school student.\u2018His current age\u2026 is 18.\u2019His talent plates wouldn\u2019t be completely open yet. Of course, he wasn\u2019t the \u2018Typhoon\u2019 he would be in the future.\u2018Current time, 2:45 p.m.\u2019It was about time for Senia to show herself. Sure enough, just like we arranged ahead of time, Senia appeared.[Channel #19207 has opened.]The caf\u00e9 on the 1st floor, 2:45 p.m. The high schooler \u2018Jo Sunghyun\u2019 who had just come into the 1st floor. And Kim Taechun, the self-styled predator lurking around in search of prey.\u2018Let\u2019s watch for a bit, shall we?\u2019Just then, I heard a notice.[The \u2018Nameless Guardian\u2019 is greatly satisfied with your observing.][The \u2018Nameless Guardian\u2019 has sent you a 300 Coin sponsorship.]My \u2018act of watching\u2019 was interpreted by the Nameless Guardian as \u2018observing\u2019. Well, it was all good, since it meant the Guardian I had a direct contract with was looking at me in a good light. After all, I would have to keep the contract with this Guardian until at least level 50.As I watched, I sensed it.\u2018It\u2019s starting.\u2019Right here and now, the Typhoon would be making his first move.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: 1st Players Convention (3)I tried remembering everything I knew about the Typhoon, Jo Sunghyun.\u2018Someone who defeated the Sword Empress Shin Yeonseo in a one-on-one\u2026 and the only formal magic class Player.\u2019As his name suggested, Sunghyun was a mage who used wind.\u2018His talent plates haven\u2019t completely opened yet, and\u2026\u2019In the early days of Playing, it was inevitable that magic classes were overshadowed by close-combat classes. Mages were very weak in the early period, and their starting difficulty was extremely high. But if they succeeded and made it big, they had incredible killing power and destructive force.\u2018At least in the beginning, he\u2019s no match for Kim Taechun.\u2019Before I regressed, it was commonly known that Taechun purposefully picked a fight with Sunghyun at this time. Taechun never said from his own mouth why, but people were pretty sure that was the case.\u2018There\u2019s a high chance it\u2019s a quest from the courage-lover.\u2019The Fire Bear Kim Taechun\u2019s contracted guardian was none other than the \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019. As one might expect from the Courageous Lion King\u2019s personality, he often issued quests that went along the lines of \u2018Show your courage\u2019, and Taechun carried out such quests faithfully. He also had an aptitude for it.\u2018Just as planned, I will make Sunghyun my ally.\u2019Only then could I safely get through this day and make things happen the way I wanted. While I was thinking, I briefly met Taechun in the eyes.[Eye of Perception recognizes some weak hostility.]I couldn\u2019t suppress a smirk. Weak hostility, huh. He wasn\u2019t at the point of being able to exude bloodthirst yet. At most, he could only let out \u2018hostility\u2019.\u2018I\u2019ve been caught on your radar, you say?\u2019Right now, what Taechun wanted was to be in the position of a predator who could show their courage. That meant his victim couldn\u2019t be much weaker than him, nor could they be much stronger.\u2018If he looked at me\u2026 that means I look like the best target out of our party, I suppose.\u2019Good, that was excellent.\u2018For now, Yeonseo\u2019s been underestimated.\u2019Yeonseo was too delicate a girl\u2026 at least on the outside.\u2018Needless to say, Sunhwa has been as well.\u2019In all actuality, gender or age weren\u2019t all that big an issue when it came to Playing, as long as you were in your early 20s or younger, since all your talent plates would be open at that point. However, the current Taechun wouldn\u2019t think that way, so the potential targets were narrowed down to Yoohyun, Sung-gu, and me.\u2018And out of the three of us, I look like the easiest target.\u2019Eye of Perception made me very certain of that. He hadn\u2019t picked a fight with me, but if Sunghyun hadn\u2019t shown up right at this moment, he would have jumped at any opportunity to make trouble with me.Summary: Self-Proclaimed Predator Seeking PreyThat self-proclaimed predator had found his prey, a perfect prey called Jo Sunghyun.* * *Even as Senia streamed the situation unfolding before her, she found it difficult to believe. She recalled what Hyukjin had said to her last night.\u2013Suppose there\u2019s a guy who wants to draw attention. The easiest way to do so is to fight someone. It\u2019s simple and easy to make that happen, and it\u2019s the sort of material that Guardians like.That, Senia could agree with. There were always one or two Players like that, after all.\u2013If they pick a fight with someone, the target won\u2019t be too strong or too weak.Senia was seeing that with her own two eyes right now. The Player called Kim Taechun purposefully picked a fight with the Player called Jo Sunghyun.\u201cOi. If you hit someone, you should apologize.\u201d\u2013And suppose again that Choi Sung-gu was watching; he wouldn\u2019t be able to let it go. He\u2019s got a pretty strong sense of justice, as well as a fiery temperament.Senia continued to stream the situation. After glaring at Kim Taechun, Jo Sunghyun simply turned around. Taechun yelled, \u201cOi, you little shit. Stop right there.\u201d\u2013Then in the end, Sung-gu and that person would clash.The situation you have cooked up is quite detailed. The longer you spend describing this situation, the less likely it\u2019ll happen.And yet, Sung-gu really did step forward.\u201cHey! What are you doing with this kid!\u201d\u2013It\u2019s a really good situation, don\u2019t you think? The sort of situation Guardians will also find amusing.\u2013Is it not a product of excessive imagination?Even for a Precognitive Dream user, Senia thought it was too fictitious.\u2013You already agreed to make the bet, so hear me out all the way.\u2013Go ahead. I will listen.And how were things turning out? It was all happening like Hyukjin said yesterday.\u2013If it gets to that point, the picture will almost be complete.Taechun would pick a fight with Sunghyun, and Sung-gu would jump in the middle, unable to simply watch.\u2013Then what\u2019ll happen next is the guy\u2019s Streamer will get involved. Their Player made the opportunity, so the Intermediate Administrator has to fan the flames, right?\u2013\u2026\u2013If I were an Intermediate Administrator, I would absolutely open a PVP zone.Sure enough\u2014[A PVP Zone has been declared.]With that appeared a humanoid figure with the head of a rhinoceros. Senia\u2019s wingtips trembled. Even though she was streaming, she couldn\u2019t take her eyes off Kim Hyukjin.* * *Hyukjin knew that Percy would declare a PVP zone. In a PVP zone, you couldn\u2019t die, even if you were killed. It was a field with a built-in \u2018revival\u2019 function.[A PVP Zone has been declared.][In the current field, pain will be registered.][When the PVP request is made and accepted, the PVP match will begin.]\u2018Of the types of PVP fields, pain exists in this one.\u2019This was a field where pain could be felt. You wouldn\u2019t die, but you would feel the pain of death in its totality.\u201cWhy\u2019re you messing with the Player I\u2019m streaming, huh?\u201dPercy didn\u2019t have much respect for humans. He only saw them as ways to make money.\u201cTrash like you needs to be swept away.\u201dThe current Sung-gu was no match for Percy. To spur on this situation, Percy would leave Sung-gu half dead, clearing the way for Taechun to show as much courage as he wanted to the terrified Players.\u2018So now\u2014\u2019Hyukjin glanced behind him, urging Senia to make her entrance.\u201cIntermediate Administrator Percy. It appears that you are about to use coercive force on a Player. Am I correct?\u201d\u201cAnd who the hell are you?\u201dPercy spat onto the ground.Szzzz\u2013!His green saliva steamed on the ground. The Players gathered nearby whispered amongst each other.\u201cWh-What\u2019s happening?\u201d\u201cShh. Be quiet. You could get killed if an Intermediate Administrator looks at you wrong.\u201d\u201cShh, shh. Let\u2019s just watch from afar.\u201dSenia was not shaken. She continued to speak, uncowed. \u201cI, too, know the unwritten law that Intermediate Administrators should not greatly interfere in each other\u2019s matters.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s with this ridiculous interference?! Move aside. I need to proceed with my content.\u201d\u201cHowever, this is an issue related to the absolute Commandments of the System. Why are you trying to use coercive force on a Player without justified reason?\u201dHyukjin found himself smiling. It looked like Senia regretted not having been able to say anything in front of Neptune last time. She had learned and grown quite a lot. As a Streamer, she was still a greenling, but it did feel like she went up quite a few levels.\u201cIs that something you need to know?\u201d\u201cYes. Player Choi Sung-gu is one of the Players I am focusing on.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHyukjin didn\u2019t know how long Senia had been focusing on Sung-gu, but Percy would have no comeback for that. Well done, Senia.Senia would block any Intermediate Administrator interference. The PVP zone was established, and Percy wouldn\u2019t be able to jump forward and usher things along. That was Senia\u2019s role\u2014to make sure that thugs like Percy wouldn\u2019t be able to screw around.The Guardians were probably watching this situation, too.\u2018The Courageous Lion King must be watching right now.\u2019Now then. The picture was all finished. The Courageous Lion King was a courage-addled courage-lover who wanted to see the \u2018courage\u2019 of Players. Thanks to Senia stepping forward, Percy could no longer give the situation a strong push. In such a situation, I knew what the Courageous Lion King would do.\u2018He\u2019ll definitely give Taechun a quest, telling him to fight with me, since the PVP zone is already established and it\u2019s a good opportunity.\u2019[Feeling strong \u2018competitive spirit\u2019 through Eye of Perception.]The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 was egging Taechun on to fight me, offering the weaker Player some kind of support at the same time.Senia\u2019s wingtips trembled nonstop. Everything was happening so precisely according to Hyukjin\u2019s words that she would believe it if someone told her he had written the plot.\u2013When that happens, Taechun will be impatient to have a PVP match with me.Player Kim Taechun first started by picking a fight with Jo Sunghyun, then Choi Sung-gu. With all these eyes around them, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to make trouble with him, someone just sitting quietly on the sidelines.\u2013So then, Percy will switch his focus to you, since he needs to get me involved somehow.In fact, Senia hadn\u2019t put much importance on Hyukjin\u2019s words yesterday. Even if he was a Precognitive Dream user, she thought he wouldn\u2019t be able to see in such detail. The only thing she was concerned about was what she should demand when she won the bet.\u201cThen is that Choi Sung-gu guy your exclusively contracted Player?\u201d\u201cThat is not the case.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s your exclusively contracted Player then?\u201d\u201cMy exclusively contracted Player is\u2026\u201dSenia\u2019s gaze moved towards Hyukjin. She didn\u2019t state him by name, but her look was answer enough.\u2013Afterwards, he\u2019ll request a PVP match with me.Kim Taechun grinned, rubbing his tattooed arms. He had the habit of doing that when he was getting ready for a fight. In the meantime, Percy said to Senia, \u201cFine, then. It can\u2019t be helped since you\u2019re bringing up the Commandments and all. As this guy\u2019s exclusively contracted Intermediate Administrator, I request a PVP match with your exclusively contracted Player.\u201dSenia was silent for a moment.\u2013What do you think? Of my hypothesis?She recalled how Hyukjin said those words last night, grinning. She nearly got goosebumps.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Scared? Scared your Player will die miserably in front of all the Guardians? Huh?\u201dPercy snickered. Senia wasn\u2019t affected much by his sneering.\u2018From the beginning\u2026 to the end.\u2019To Senia, it felt\u2026 like Hyukjin had predicted\u2014no,\u00a0designed\u2014 this situation from beginning to end. It was a little terrifying now.\u2018Everything is happening as Player Kim Hyukjin predicted.\u2019How could this be? It felt to her that everything was in the palm of Hyukjin\u2019s hand.\u2018He read the situation in this much detail\u2026 based merely on the preposition that there\u2019ll be a crazy Player and a crazy Intermediate Administrator here today.\u2019Kim Hyukjin was still weak. But his insight alone was unmatched. Senia had always known this, but she could be 100% sure of it today.\u2018In the entire world, throughout all of history, there\u2019s no Player with such a talent.\u2019Hyukjin was a genius among geniuses. She could only acknowledge that he was a genius who went far beyond the realm of geniuses.Did Percy and Taechun have any idea that their actions were all in line with Hyukjin\u2019s blueprint and picture?Yesterday, Hyukjin said the following to her:\u2013If something like that happens\u2026 this is what you need to do.Senia decided to act exactly as Hyukjin said.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: 1st Players Convention (4)Yesterday, Hyukjin said the following:\u2013Refuse him. It\u2019s fine if it makes me look a little cowardly. I\u2019m not a direct combat class, anyway.\u2013\u2026What?\u2013What? It\u2019s true. I\u2019m not a combat class.It wasn\u2019t a lie. He really wasn\u2019t a direct combat class\u2026 even though he did win a 1-on-1 PVP match against Shin Yeonseo. In any case, it\u00a0was\u00a0technically true that he wasn\u2019t a direct combat class.\u2013But if someone like that really shows up\u2026 He\u2019ll probably keep pestering endlessly for a PVP match, and a lot of Guardians will agree with that. PVP is content that Guardians go wild for.If that happened, the mood would make it tough to completely refuse a PVP.\u2013So make someone other than me fight in the PVP.Hyukjin knew the best person for that\u2014the future Sword Empress, the strongest Player in 1-on-1 duels, Shin Yeonseo.\u2013Yeonseo would be a good fit.\u2013\u2026I understand. If the situation truly occurs like Player Kim Hyukjin says, I will act like you have said.And after saying that, Senia continued.\u2013\u2026Very well. I\u2019ll wait and see if Player Kim Hyukjin\u2019s excessively detailed scenario will actually happen.They even made a bet.\u2013If things happen like you say, I will open the intermediate-grade Item Shop one time for you.But it actually happened. With one mistake, a massive pile of Coins flew away. Senia resolved to never make a bet with Hyukjin ever again.\u201cI refuse the PVP match. My exclusively contracted Player is a non-combat class. He is not suited for a 1-on-1 PVP match.\u201d Senia spoke quickly, seizing the initiative in the conversation with Percy. \u201cHowever, I will select a teammate who can carry out the match in his stead, if she agrees.\u201dAs soon as Yeonseo heard \u2018she\u2019, she jumped forward.\u201cMe! Me! Me-me-me-me!\u201dYeonseo actually thought she wouldn\u2019t have the chance, since she figured Hyukjin would take care of it. However, Hyukjin was ruled out of the PVP with the ridiculous reason of \u2018he\u2019s not a combat class\u2019, and now, she held the dice.Hyukjin took a look at Yeonseo\u2019s summary.Summary: Two-Faced Swordsman Aspiring to Become a WifeHyukjin almost tilted his neck in spite of himself.\u2018Something about this summary is weird again\u2026?\u2019A swordsman aspiring to become a wife. Something about it was a little weird. Wife? Did that mean there was a husband somewhere? Somehow, all the summaries of the people around him were strange. That aside, just as he expected, Yeonseo was full of fighting spirit at the moment.\u2018Because Yeonseo is a Player who enjoys 1-on-1 PVP.\u2019She was the type of Player who really enjoyed 1-on-1 PVP, to the point that it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that the future Sword Empress grew strong through PVP.\u201cYou heard her, right?\u201dHyukjin took a step back, and Yeonseo took a confident step forward.\u201cNice, I was itching for some PVP.\u201dYeonseo rolled her neck and shoulders, loosening her muscles. Her \u2018hehe\u2019ing appearance made her look every bit a kind and cute university student. However, the moment she grasped her sword, her aura would completely change. Hyukjin knew that very well.\u2018Two-faced swordsman.\u2019Yeonseo, whose growth was accelerated by Playing with him, was a Player contracted with the \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019, one who had already reached the realm of being one with the sword.Kim Taechun gave a dumbfounded laugh. \u201cMen are hiding behind a woman, huh? Can you guys still call yourselves men? You\u2019re nothing but dogs, you fucking trash.\u201dAnd so, the PVP match between Yeonseo and Taechun began, and the result was obvious. As soon as the match started, Yeonseo moved rapidly, stopping in front of Taechun.\u201cWhat the heck, so boring. Why\u2019s this dude so weak?\u201dThe tip of Yeonseo\u2019s sword rested on Taechun\u2019s throat. If she thrust forward with a little strength, his neck would be severed. It looked like the match would end that way.I hadn\u2019t just predicted \u2018today\u2019. I drew out today\u2019s situation, and I understood exactly what I had to do within that canvas.\u2018Observer\u2019s Eye.\u2019There was no better opportunity to practice using Observer\u2019s Eye to ascertain the situation. Having decided to give myself more time to research more about the Observer class, I read this PVP match precisely.\u2018Over in one. Taechun does look a little unreconciled.\u2019Although Taechun looked very unreconciled with the result, there were actually a lot of nuances in Yeonseo\u2019s movement.\u2018Though you\u2019d need the eye to see it.\u2019The current Taechun probably wasn\u2019t able to read the entirety of Yeonseo\u2019s movement. For him, things simply ended with a cry of alarm, and she was there.\u2018This is Observer\u2019s Eye.\u2019I could perceive Yeonseo\u2019s movements more precisely than when I looked with my physical eyes. With a little exaggeration, it felt as if I could even see the movement of each of her muscles under her clothes. When she twisted, I saw the rotation start from the bottoms of her feet and go up her legs into her body.\u2018As expected\u2026 It\u2019s not a simple eye for observing alone.\u2019She twisted to dodge Taechun\u2019s large axe. Then, she activated her footwork technique, and \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 read the technique in detail.\u2018A distance at which Taechun\u2019s axe won\u2019t reach. The angle at which he cannot swing. She aimed precisely for his blind spot and narrowed the distance.\u2019Yeonseo was at least one step ahead of Taechun in this close-combat fight, and I saw it all.\u2018I can see the flow of mana.\u2019My proficiency was only 1, so I couldn\u2019t see it precisely, but I could feel the rough strokes\u2014how it was flowing, what kind of mana was moving, and how it was affecting the body.-Flow Perception: Visualize the flow of nature.This was the power of \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019. Through it, I was able to see something I\u2019d read about in textbooks more clearly.\u2018If I get used to this and my proficiency goes up\u2026!\u2019Action Duplication: Copy the actions of an observation target (currently cannot be used).Not right now, but in the future, I would definitely be able to use the ability. From the \u2018observing\u2019 I was doing now, I was able to grasp my own abilities a little more concretely.Taechun didn\u2019t look all that frightened of the sword resting on his throat.\u201cIt\u2019s not over, you know?\u201dHe moved the huge axe in his right hand to his left and swung it with all his strength.\u201cYou have to kill your opponent to end it, you arrogant bitch!\u201dI chuckled. \u2018You think Yeonseo didn\u2019t expect that?\u2019I had already seen it with Observer\u2019s Eye. The weak mana flowing in Yeonseo\u2019s body was already heading towards her legs, meaning she had prepared to dodge in advance.\u2018She\u2019s still the future Sword Empress.\u2019She did lose to Jo Sunghyun because of the bad matchup once, but she was still destined to become the strongest PVPer in both name and reality in the Korean server.\u2018Hold on a sec.\u2019 Something suddenly occurred to me. \u2018From here, in the position of an observer, I can see it well, but\u2026\u2019Normally, it was easy to see things when you took a step back. You might not be able to play soccer, but you could easily offer advice while watching from afar.\u2018If I were really in the thick of it, would I be able to see other Players\u2019 movements like just now? If I could know in advance that mana was concentrating in someone\u2019s legs\u2026\u2019Then that would mean I could move while predicting the opponent\u2019s movements, no? I would be able to react knowing how exactly they would move.\u2018Even if it\u2019s not a Player\u2026\u2019It would be the same if the opponent were a monster. If I had eyes that could read the movements of muscles, the flow of mana, it meant I could assume a far more advantageous position in battle. The more experienced I became, the more marvelous the power of \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 seemed to become.\u2018It\u2019s already this good\u2026 even though the proficiency is only 1?\u2019I felt my heart thudding hard. If the proficiency went up a lot, I would be able to go much higher, even higher than I thought.\u201cThis guy\u2019s no good.\u201dYeonseo\u2019s sword plunged into the middle of Taechun\u2019s forehead.\u201cGAAAAAAGH!\u201d he screamed.[The PVP match has been concluded.]Taechun died on the spot. The shocking sight stunned everyone to silence, which was quickly broken by the shutters of the journalists who had gotten in on the action.\u201cS-Sir. Can we really broadcast this? It\u2019s a murder.\u201d\u201cFor now, keep shooting. Did you get it? Answer me!\u201dA few Players began to whisper as well.\u201cIsn\u2019t this murder?\u201dBut then, they witnessed a miracle. Kim Taechun\u2019s body looked like it was becoming dust and disappearing, and at the same time, the body began to glow and became sparkling particles of light. Those particles began to reform into a whole, healthy body.\u201cA-Amazing!\u201d\u201cH-H-He came back to life!\u201dCamera flashes went off nonstop. The likes of the \u2018Players Convention\u2019 wasn\u2019t important right now. Everyone had just witnessed the miraculous sight of someone dying and being revived in a PVP match.\u201cWh-What I\u2019m seeing right now is the truth, right?\u201d\u201cNo way, no way.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, no way? There are monsters, Streamers, and the world has changed. This is the world after the Cataclysm.\u201dWhile the crowd was murmuring in awe, I heard a different notice.[EXP acquired.]If I hunted directly, I couldn\u2019t get EXP.But it also meant that even if I didn\u2019t do anything and just sat around, my EXP would rise.[Detailed Explanation]Skill name: Observer\u2019s Domain (Current proficiency: 1)Skill effect:\u00a0Creates a field where \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 takes effect.For party Play, EXP +50%Range: 5 metersEXP +50% for party Play. Add onto that the title I already had, \u2018First Pioneer\u2019, with its +20% EXP effect, and I had a +70% EXP boost in total.The System apparently recognized this as a party Play. Every time a party Play was recognized, I would get about 20% additional EXP.\u2018It\u2019s 20% additional EXP because the EXP is shared half and half with Yeonseo.\u2019For example, if we worked together in a party to kill a monster with 100 EXP, killing it would give us 120 EXP. If we had both contributed the same amount, that 120 EXP would be divided in half, with each person getting 60 EXP.\u2018If I get the additional 70% bonus here\u2026\u2019I would get an extra 42 EXP of that 60, which added up to 102 EXP. To sum it up in simple terms, I\u2019m actually getting more than if I PVPed on my own?And it didn\u2019t just apply to PVP. When hunting, when clearing dungeons, it would be the same. Simply put, just watching from the back would net me the same reward as engaging in back-breaking labor in the front.\u2018Isn\u2019t this\u2026 amazing?\u2019This seemed to be the true value of the \u2018Observer\u2019 class.\u2018Is this really okay?\u2019It was kind of like stealing nearly half of Yeonseo\u2019s EXP even though I didn\u2019t lift a finger. Just as my thoughts were going that way, I heard someone clapping.\u201cGoodness, how very impressive. The beautiful lady over there, you\u2019re at an incredible level, aren\u2019t you? You were a marvel to behold.\u201dSomeone who wasn\u2019t a part of the picture I\u2019d been drawing suddenly showed up, and the situation began to move in a way I hadn\u2019t predicted.\u2018Huh?\u2019Looking down, I saw [!!!] marks appear over Darongi\u2019s head.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: 1st Players Convention (5)I didn\u2019t know this person would show up here, but he was a Player I knew.[Player]Name: Gu SungminAge: 31Level: 19Class: Coin ThiefInnate ability: [Wallet Perception]State: Excited / Expectant / NervousDisposition: Selfish / Quick-witted / BoldSummary: Promising Thief Thirsty for CoinsGuardian has not yet been selected.The disposition/state/summary only show the most representative and can change according to the situation.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible.It was Gu Sungmin, a Coin-specializing thief who\u2019d gone around swindling beginner Players out of Coins in the early days of Playing. I remembered him as the most famous thief Player in the early period.\u2018And he\u2019s got an innate ability of his own, too.\u2019That was why he was able to rob so many Players of their money.\u2018Wallet Perception, huh.\u2019From the looks of it, he could roughly see how many Coins were in a Player\u2019s inventory. Since this was the early period of Playing, he might not know the exact figure, but he could probably determine who in the room had the greatest number of Coins.\u2018Currently, the person with the most Coins is\u2026\u2019There was a good chance it was me, since I had about 13,000 Coins at the moment. Sure enough, Gu Sungmin\u2019s gaze flitted to me. He wasn\u2019t staring at me, but he was definitely keeping me in sight.Sungmin drew the attention of the crowd with his characteristic sly laugh and exaggerated clapping.\u201cIt\u2019s not just your face that is beautiful, but also your skills.\u201dHe came closer.\u2018Hrmmm?\u2019Many early Players experienced the strange phenomenon of the Coins in their Inventory suddenly dropping to 0. If Gu Sungmin hadn\u2019t done the braindead act of revealing that he was a thief Player, those Coin losses might have remained a mystery for an eternity.\u2018He often bragged about all the foreign cars he had, and then\u2026\u2019He made a drunk post on Instagram detailing exactly how he earned his money.\u2018Looks like he\u2019s trying to draw attention, come to me, and take my Coins.\u2019I saw his movements precisely. His mouth was busy with other things and he appeared to be paying attention solely to Yeonseo, but I could still see it. Just like how I could read Yeonseo\u2019s \u2018sword path\u2019, somehow, I was simply able to see his intentions.\u2018But how come he can\u2019t see Darongi?\u2019[!!!] marks clearly appeared over Darongi\u2019s head, but Gu Sungmin didn\u2019t seem to have much interest in Darongi. To be more exact, it didn\u2019t look like he could see Darongi.\u2018I think it\u2019s because of his innate ability.\u2019For a frickin\u2019 squirrel, he had an incredible amount of innate abilities.Innate abilities: [Pickup] [Pathfinding] [Gnawing] [Theft] [Subspace] [Big Belly] [Hole Digging] [Stealth] [Master Selection]Come to think of it, Darongi\u2019s summary was nothing to scoff at, either.Summary: Gluttonous Theft GeniusA promising thief met a theft genius. Darongi stared at me, the [!!!] marks shining red above his head. He seemed to want something from me, like he was asking, \u2018If I bring you a ton of Coins, what\u2019ll you give me?\u2019We couldn\u2019t converse, but we could communicate well enough.\u201cFruit Bundle.\u201dTwo words, and Darongi was off, moving as swiftly as an arrow.[Using the innate ability Theft.][Coins have been acquired.][Using the innate ability Subspace.][Coins have been stored in the \u2018Subspace\u2019.]Gu Sungmin didn\u2019t notice Darongi at all.\u201cAre you fellows her party members?\u201dIn the meantime, the obviously defeated Kim Taechun stealthily snuck away. Gu Sungmin was drawing the crowd\u2019s attention away, so he left without another word.[Eye of Perception detects a foreign energy.][Eye of Perception grasps the use of an innate ability.]I continued to stay where I was. I knew what he was trying to do. When I looked with Observer\u2019s Eye, I could see that a bunch of mana was gathered around Gu Sungmin\u2019s hand\u2014he seemed to be in the process of taking my Coins. I opened my Inventory to find that my Coins were slowly decreasing in amount.\u2018Wow.\u2019What a fun ability. To think he could really suck Coins from others, and even from a target that was over ten levels higher than him. He was indeed a promising thief.\u201cMy friend is an incredibly competent journalist\u2026 Would you be willing to do an interview with us?\u201d\u201cWhat? N-No. Um, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dYeonseo reddened. In the meantime, Darongi jumped onto Sungmin\u2019s shoulder with \u2018Stealth\u2019 activated and stared at me with [!!!] over his head. When I gave him a nod, Darongi snorted and waited, like he was shouting, \u2018Watch, I\u2019m this awesome!\u2019\u201cThis is my business card. I really would like to interview you. Please contact me.\u201dThe whole time, my Coins continued to dwindle. When the number hit 0, Darongi took action with terrifyingly impeccable timing like the theft genius he was.[Using the innate ability Theft.][Coins have been acquired.][Using the innate ability Subspace.][Coins have been stored in the \u2018Subspace\u2019.]A [?] popped up above Darongi\u2019s head. It was a message I could click. There really was no shortage of fascinating things when it came to this fellow.[As the one who has become Darongi\u2019s master, you can access Darongi\u2019s Subspace.][Currently, there are \u201847,000 Coins\u2019 in Darongi\u2019s Subspace.]I almost laughed, dumbfounded. Just by sitting around, I was about to come into possession of 47k Coins. All it took to replicate this was to go to the store and buy a bunch of snacks that squirrels liked.-13,000 became +47,000 in mere moments. I obtained a whopping 34,000 while sitting down.\u2018Hah.\u2019Making money sure was easy. Thinking of how I got just 17 Coins from killing a level 25 Fanged Boar, this was one crazy amount of Coins to get in one go.\u2018And it looks like this guy doesn\u2019t even realize he\u2019s lost all the money in his Inventory.\u2019He gave a very polite farewell, like he had finished everything he needed to do here.\u201cI will get in contact with you at a later time.\u201dAnd then, he turned and left, which made me certain of it.\u2018He really doesn\u2019t know?\u2019 Even though he was sure to have checked his Inventory? \u2018Wow.\u2019Darongi, this little squirrel, was the real deal.\u2018He really is a theft genius.\u2019I didn\u2019t know for sure, but I guessed that Darongi secretly put fake Coins into Gu Sungmin\u2019s Inventory to fool him, if only temporarily. There was no other explanation. In any case, I rubbed the top of Darongi\u2019s head with my finger after he returned to my shoulder. The boastful Darongi purred like a cat, enjoying the petting with [\u266a\u266a] marks.\u201cJust wait a little. I\u2019ll buy you a ton of the snacks you like.\u201d\u201cHm? Boss, what are you saying? Why\u2019re you talking about snacks all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dCome to think of it, Yeonseo couldn\u2019t see Darongi, either. This little rascal had a real convenient ability.\u201cHey, this kid says his name is Jo Sunghyun. He said thanks to me, so I told him to say thanks to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Typhoon Jo Sunghyun was the type of Player who didn\u2019t forget grudges, but also remembered favors even more clearly, to the point that he got the absolute good \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 as his contracted Guardian.[Player]Name: Jo SunghyunAge: 18Level: 30Class: Child of WindGuardian: Lady of the ScalesInnate ability: [Standstill]State: Gratitude / Closeness / RageDisposition: Just / Strong Pride / Unyielding SpiritSummary: Not-Yet-Mature Incarnation of HammurabiThe disposition/state/summary only show the most representative and can change according to the situation.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible.His talent plates weren\u2019t completely open, but he was already level 30, and he had one innate ability.\u2018As expected of Jo Sunghyun.\u2019It was the same as the past. He made a contract with the Lady of the Scales.Jo Sunghyun bowed to me, saying, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to be thankful about. That person earlier wasn\u2019t acting like a real adult.\u201dThe Jo Sunghyun I knew from the future always said, \u201cIf an adult cannot act like an adult, they\u2019re not a real adult.\u201dAs was par for the course for a Player contracted with the Lady of the Scales, he was one of the Players who put great importance on \u2018justice\u2019 and \u2018principles\u2019, a Player who lived by the principle of \u2018an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth\u2019.\u201cIf a person cannot act like a person, I will not treat them like one.\u201dHis mentality was probably the same right now. Even when he was appointed as one of Korea\u2019s 8 Heroes, he spoke politely, even to little kids.\u2018If Sunghyun\u2019s disposition is like that\u2026 it\u2019s probably best to speak politely to him.\u2019In any case, we exchanged proper greetings. Thanks to Taechun and Percy\u2019s brilliant role(?), I was able to leave a good impression on Sunghyun.With that, the first step was done. It wasn\u2019t my intention, but I also got a bunch of Coins as a bonus. It would make the next steps a lot easier.\u2018Alright, next is\u2026\u2019Looking at Sunghyun, I said, \u201cYou are a magician class, correct?\u201d\u201cHow do you know that\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe way you moved when that large man was picking a fight didn\u2019t strike me as a combat class.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201d\u201cYou are not a combat class, but it looked to me that you were mentally prepared to some degree for a fight. From your body movements, you were ready to jump back and widen the distance.\u201dMore than anything\u2014\u201cThere was a weak wind in the room.\u201d* * *\u201cThere was a weak wind in the room.\u201dAt those words, Yoohyun exclaimed in admiration, \u201cHyungnim, just when did you pick up all that?\u201d\u201cDammit, any way you slice it, this guy\u2019s really a genius. When did you see all that? I was just spacing out.\u201dYeonseo elbowed Yoohyun and Sung-gu in the ribs. \u201cDarn it, shut up, you two. You have to let him say these things so we can learn. Let\u2019s just pay attention.\u201dThe journalists were clicking their shutters nonstop, broadcasting the current situation, but Yeonseo didn\u2019t pay any attention to the outsiders and focused on Hyukjin\u2019s words.\u201cWhich means, you\u2019re a combat class who doesn\u2019t use weapons or fights with your fists and feet, one who uses wind.\u201dThere was only one class like that.\u201cYou must be a combat magician, one specializing in wind.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLike a Player in the early period, Jo Sunghyun naively nodded.\u201cImpressive.\u201dHe looked calm on the outside as he nodded, but Sunghyun was feeling greatly shocked on the inside. It surprised him that there were adults who would step up in such a situation, and that there was a Player who could guess his class from a few tiny movements.Of course, it wasn\u2019t just a guess. Hyukjin was looking at Sunghyun\u2019s class very clearly.Class: Child of WindFor his 1st advancement, he got the Child of Wind class. That wasn\u2019t a class name Hyukjin remembered, but it wasn\u2019t hard to figure out that it was the 1st class of the future \u2018Typhoon\u2019.As he exchanged greetings with Sunghyun, Hyukjin checked the time.\u2018Almost 2.\u2019Everything was settled with very appropriate timing. The Players Convention would soon begin.\u2018This is where it really begins.\u2019For now, Hyukjin succeeded in bringing Sunghyun to his side, though it was hard to call him 100% an \u2018ally\u2019. But anyway, the first step was successfully taken. In the event that would happen today, Jo Sunghyun could essentially be called a \u2018key person\u2019, and Hyukjin managed to make positive contact with that key person. It was all within his plan.\u201cWould you like to come up with us? The convention is in the 12th floor\u2019s main hall.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dWe got onto the elevator.1F, 2F, 3F\u2026The elevator moved quickly.\u2013Arriving on the 12th floor.\u2013The elevator doors are opening.\u2018The time right now\u2026\u2019Hyukjin glanced at the clock on his phone.\u2018It\u2019s 2:03.\u2019He took a step forward.\u2018The notice is coming.\u2019If things went the same as he remembered, there would definitely be one.[Entering the Flash Gate, \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019.]This was the place the Typhoon later said was responsible for his awakening. I stepped into the site of the 1st Players Convention, as well as the flash gate \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019.\u2018We\u2019ll probably get a quest.\u2019During the 1st Players Convention, at least half of the participants died. Right here.\u2018If I can save them\u2026 I will.\u2019Hyukjin thought back to the Tutorial Field, the convenience store safe zone. He could still vividly see the countless people who had died in front of him, separated by glass. If possible, he wanted to minimize the damage. As much as he could.\u2018While also awakening Jo Sunghyun.\u2019And along with those two goals, he would also obtain \u2018that\u2019.\u2018I have to get it\u2026 without fail.\u2019In no time at all, the field changed, and he began to see countless people on the new field.\u2018Let\u2019s do this.\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: Hill of Blowing WindI couldn\u2019t stop what was bound to happen.\u2018Even if it didn\u2019t happen today\u2026\u2019It would definitely happen eventually. A Players Convention would be scheduled one day, and during it, an \u2018event\u2019 would certainly occur. Since that was the case, I decided it was best for me to use the knowledge I had and the factors I was capable of controlling to do my best.\u2018I\u2019m going in.\u2019[You have entered the Flash Gate, \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019.]The field was a large hill. I looked around, seeing a crowd of Players that hadn\u2019t yet figured out what was happening.\u2018Even without knowledge of the future\u2026 if you step back a little and think, it\u2019s natural for something like this to happen.\u2019This was a place full of Players in their beginning days, and most of the ones chosen in one way or another were here. With Streamers and Guardians alike watching, of course it would be a big event. It was the first gathering of Players independent of the \u2018System\u2019. It would be fun if \u2018something\u2019 happened during it, no?\u2018Like what the Giant of the Sunset did.\u2019The Giant of the Sunset made the \u2018Shot Table Dungeon\u2019 for Choi Sung-gu. The Guardian likely had to invest a massive amount of Coins to make it happen, all for his own amusement and pleasure. In other words, a Guardian\u2019s extravagance. There were many Guardians who could afford such extravagance.\u2018They can easily make one flash gate.\u2019Actually, there was no way to check if it was a gate artificially made by a Guardian. I simply estimated that there was a high chance it was.\u2018Broken pillars.\u2019There were marble pillars broken at various heights. In the past, Jo Sunghyun once revealed the following:\u2013There were eighteen broken pillars there.As I was looking at the pillars, people discovered that Yoohyun had entered. Yoohyun had made several appearances on TV, so he was already famous.\u201cHuh? Isn\u2019t that the Tutorial Ender?\u201d\u201cIt-It\u2019s So Yoohyun!\u201dYoohyun instantly became the focus of the attention of the disoriented Players who were running around in confusion.\u2018Still, it\u2019s much more disappointing than I thought.\u2019It might be the early days of Playing, and only the 4th month since the Cataclysm, but this was too severe.\u2018It\u2019s already been three minutes since they came in.\u2019They were still running pell-mell. I didn\u2019t really see any Players who were trying to ascertain the terrain. Of course, the few Players I\u2019d nurtured were already calmly inspecting the surroundings and moving towards clearing the flash gate, but\u2014\u2018I don\u2019t see any Players with leadership.\u2019In most cases, and especially for a gate or dungeon where large numbers of Players could join at the same time, it was nearly impossible to achieve a solo clear, even if you knew the strategy.\u2018I guess I can\u2019t expect too much from the early period, but still\u2026\u2019I would have still liked to see a few people come forward and round up the Players, dividing people into various roles based on each person\u2019s traits and class. There was a stark absence of a leader, aka a sovereign. That was the biggest problem these guys were facing right now.\u201cYoohyun. You take the public leader role.\u201d\u201cWh-What?\u201d\u201cWhy? Never did it before?\u201dDuring the three months while I was in the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019, Yoohyun must have grown in his own way. As was befitting for the \u2018Tutorial Ender\u2019, he must have experienced being a leader several times, too. At a time like this, his Tutorial Ender fame would be very compelling.\u201cTh-That\u2019s not the case, but\u2026 How could I dare to when\u2026\u201dBasically, he was trying to say he couldn\u2019t dare take such a role when his mighty hyungnim was here.\u201cI\u2019m not famous. Do you think those guys will listen to me?\u201dThe look in Yoohyun\u2019s hesitant eyes changed a little. Like the phrase \u2018clothes make the man\u2019, the position you found yourself in changed how you behaved. When Yoohyun considered commanding those people, his aura changed under the weight of the responsibility.\u201cThere\u2019s something off about this wind.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s weak, but the wind has mana in it. It feels different from a natural wind. If, by any chance, the wind starts blowing hard\u2026 tell everyone to get flat onto the ground. Multiple times. You can warn them multiple times. Because the wind uphill seems off, too.\u201dThis was all I could do right now.\u201c\u2026Understood, hyungnim.\u201dI didn\u2019t think I could save everyone here. Even if I said that \u2018this and this is going to happen, so everyone listen to me,\u2019 it\u2019d already be a blessing if I weren\u2019t treated like a total lunatic.\u2018I can\u2019t save everyone.\u2019Someone, or some people, would definitely die. I would just do everything within my power.[Monsters are appearing.]A bleak wind blew in along with the notice. Many hero stories or promotional videos had been filmed based on what Jo Sunghyun said, and I remembered them all very clearly.\u2013A weak wind began to blow. Following that, specter monsters appeared all over the place. As you know, they were neutral monsters\u2014Wraiths.A slightly somber wind.\u2018Specter monsters, Wraiths.\u2019Their average level was around 20. The specter monsters floating around looked like large seagulls. Other than the fact that physical attacks had no effect on them, they weren\u2019t very strong monsters.Wraith LVL 21\u201cIt-It\u2019s monsters.\u201dA few people even attempted to attack them.\u201cThe attacks aren\u2019t doing anything!\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t attack them!\u201dOne of the large seagull-shaped monsters went from flying slowly to opening its wings wide and wrapping a Player within them. It then pecked the Player\u2019s head with its beak.\u201cA-AAAGHH!\u201d screamed the Player.\u2018Does it hurt that bad?\u2019No, it shouldn\u2019t hurt that much. It was painful, yes, but the Wraith\u2019s attack shouldn\u2019t be that terrible\u2014it wasn\u2019t that strong of a monster.\u2018This is pathetic.\u2019I might\u2026 have messed up a bit. I had cleared the \u2018Seoul Station Dungeon\u2019, which was supposed to break a few times, too quickly. The Players might have lost one of the ways in which they could become stronger.I heard a loud shout.\u201cORYAAA!!!\u201dIt reminded me of a record someone had written.\u2013There was the sound of someone shouting \u201cOrya\u201d. It was Kim Taechun, who is now called the \u2018Fire Bear\u2019. He had just won an overwhelming victory in a PVP match against Jo Sunghyun and was full of confidence. It only took him eighty seconds to destroy one of the pillars with his huge axe.There were eighteen broken pillars here. Every time one of the pillars was destroyed, there would be a slight change.A notice with large arrows appeared over the entire field.I quietly prepared myself. A strong wind would soon blow over the field, so strong you could hardly stay upright.\u2013Wind began to blow. The Players had a hard time staying upright. We realized then that the arrows were showing the direction of the wind.Before long, the wind picked up, starting to blow hard. I had to take care of my party members.\u201cEveryone, get flat onto the floor.\u201dThe wind was buffeting us so hard it was hard to remain standing.\u2018This isn\u2019t enough to send anyone flying.\u2019It was true that it was a very strong wind, but everyone gathered here were Players. They could resist a breeze of this level. However, it was good to respond with extra care, since there was no knowing when a \u2018whirlwind\u2019 would strike. Every time a pillar was broken, a strong wind with a different trajectory would blow.\u2018When some pillars are destroyed, the Central Pillar will appear.\u2019When Jo Sunghyun was reminiscing about this time, he said\u2014\u2013When we had destroyed seven\u00a0 pillars, a huge pillar appeared. Its name was the \u2018Central Pillar\u2019, and on top of it, there was a clue for the clear.In any case, we had to destroy at least seven pillars.\u2013Thinking back on it now, I think the ideal clear method might have been to destroy just twelve or thirteen pillars.The more pillars were destroyed, the stronger the wind would become, and the more ferocious the Wraiths would become. New monsters would also appear, and countless people might lose their lives.\u2018Though the Central Pillar gets lower the more pillars are destroyed\u2026\u2019Only one pillar had been destroyed so far. A strong wind was blowing, but the Wraiths were still weak.\u2018And they\u2019re still neutral monsters.\u2019Kim Taechun shrugged, looking completely confident. Raising his voice, he shouted, \u201cSeeing as the broken pillars are attackable, I think we need to do something about them!\u201dAs if to show off his courage, he swung his axe and started hacking away at another pillar.Pillar of the Ruined TempleThe pillars could be attacked. After hearing that, the other Players began to destroy the pillars using their own individual ways.I turned to Sung-gu. \u201cYou hunt as many of the Wraiths as you can with magic.\u201d\u201cM-Me?\u201d Sung-gu trembled. \u201cAh, fuck. I\u2019m scared of ghosts.\u201dBut apparently, he must have known it wasn\u2019t the time to joke around, because after one full-body shudder, Sung-gu headed towards the area where the Wraiths were gathered.\u201cSunhwa, go support him.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dSunhwa followed Sung-gu. Yeonseo asked, \u201cWhat about me? What should I do?\u201d\u201cDestroy pillars along with Yoohyun. Don\u2019t overdo it.\u201d I gave a little more advice. \u201cGo at it gently, while keeping an eye on your stamina. Other monsters might show up, after all. You\u2019ve got the most agility, so if something unexpected happens, stick to me.\u201d\u201cOkidoki, gotcha.\u201d Yeonseo smiled brightly. \u201cIt really is nice to Play with you. It\u2019s reassuring.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt kinda feels like you concretely draw out what I have to do. As expected of our boss!\u201dAfter giving me a big thumbs up, Yeonseo used Heavenly Demonic Flying Step to move to the pillars. Here and there, pillars were being destroyed. In the meantime, the \u2018Tutorial Ender\u2019 So Yoohyun took the temporary \u2018party leader\u2019 role under the recommendation of the other Players.Yoohyun said some pretty smart stuff. \u201cLet\u2019s not destroy all of them at once,\u201d he said to the listening crowd. \u201cWe need to see what changes occur whenever we destroy a pillar.\u201dJo Sunghyun, who had been silent up until now, finally came up to me and spoke.\u201c..What\u2026\u201d He hesitated a little. \u201cWhat\u2026 should I do?\u201dThat\u2019s right. I knew he would be like this. Sunghyun couldn\u2019t be forced to do something or be pulled along at someone else\u2019s pace. You had to make him move of his own will. That was my evaluation of him, and he was acting exactly as I expected.\u201cMm.\u201d I did have him hooked, but I couldn\u2019t be too hasty. \u201cFor now, how about you join our party? The others just now are party members who\u2019ve been with me from the start.\u201d\u201cSounds good.\u201dSunghyun entered our party.\u2018You are the core key of this raid.\u2019The Central Pillar couldn\u2019t be cleared without Sunghyun\u2019s ability. According to what I knew, we needed his innate ability \u2018Standstill\u2019. And if he was willing to help me, we could clear this gate a little more safely and quickly.\u201cPlease hunt Wraiths with Sung-gu, keeping an eye on your stamina. I\u2019d like you not to overdo it and just approach it like stretching your muscles. Take all the items that drop.\u201dFor now, it was important that he learned how to cooperate with Sung-gu. That would be the key to the clear. I believed that they would do well without me laying out every detail. Both of them were geniuses, and it wasn\u2019t something I could influence with my words.\u201cCan I\u2026\u201d Once again, Sunghyun hesitated for a long time. \u201cCan I call you hyung?\u201dHis voice was trembling a little, and I couldn\u2019t figure out why he was so nervous about something like this. I almost snorted at the sight of the future Typhoon acting like this.\u201cYou can do so if you want. I don\u2019t think our ages are that different, anyway.\u201d\u201cHyung, please feel free to speak casually.\u201dJo Sunghyun was famous for not opening his heart easily to others, but apparently, the teenage Sunghyun was still pretty amenable. It seemed like he had accepted me.\u201cIf monsters other than Wraiths happen to appear, bring everyone back to me. Sung-gu and Sunhwa should understand if you tell them that.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dSunghyun joined up with Sung-gu and Sunhwa.\u2018Alright then\u2026 Guess I should go to Yoohyun\u2019s side, too.\u2019Just then, another pillar was broken. Yoohyun bellowed, \u201cHalt!\u201dIt was too much to expect perfect order or anything like that. Only after several others repeated the command did all the Players stop moving. By future standards, it was truly nothing short of deplorable.With the arrows, began another bout of wind.\u2018The wind has definitely gotten stronger.\u2019Hearing shouts of \u2018Get down!\u2019 from a few quick-witted people and Yoohyun, the Players got flat onto the ground. As they did so, the Wraiths\u2014unaffected by the wind\u2014attacked the Players.\u2018Sunhwa\u2026 should be fine.\u2019Most of the aggro was being drawn by Sung-gu, Sunghyun, and Sunhwa. They were also not taking much damage from the Wraiths. It was thanks to them that the Players on this side could focus on destroying the pillars without paying much attention to the Wraiths.The third pillar was destroyed. Yoohyun shouted, \u201cEveryone, get flat on the ground!\u201dMost Players were now used to the routine and went straight down. But a few people didn\u2019t follow his instructions.\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. It was okay even standing up.\u201d\u201cWhy does he keep telling us to get down and all?\u201d\u201cIt seems a little excessive to me\u2026\u201dIn terms of percentages, 90% of the Players followed Yoohyun\u2019s instruction, and the remaining 10% didn\u2019t. For the next pillar\u2014the fourth\u2014the number of Players who stayed standing increased a little, perhaps because they had realized that they wouldn\u2019t get hurt even if they stayed standing.\u201cSee? It\u2019s fine even if you don\u2019t get down.\u201d\u201cAh, jeez. That was a waste of strength earlier.\u201dThere were even people who blatantly complained. That much was enough to make Yoohyun feel bad, but he faithfully carried out my words to keep getting down, since the wind was getting stronger. He kept repeating the same things, saying that by getting down, we could markedly reduce the effect of the wind.\u201cSomething\u2019s off about this wind. I would be grateful if you were to please listen to me!\u201dHe kept saying that, but Yoohyun had no power, nor did he have the ability to force them. Several Players refused to listen to him. Kim Taechun, who had lost the initiative due to Yoohyun, even overtly ridiculed him.\u201cWhat\u2019s got you so scared that you\u2019re trembling like a little bitch? Come now, let\u2019s just destroy all the pillars. Are you men, or are you boys?\u201dSeveral people agreed with him. I simply watched. I was no Superman and I had no power to forcefully command them. More than anything, I was not a saint. They were choosing to be reckless. I\u2019d done what I could through Yoohyun.The fifth pillar, then the sixth, were destroyed. The number of arrows increased from 7 to 10.This time, a powerful gust blew in, almost like a tornado. It was a \u2018whirlwind\u2019.\u201cUwaaaaaaaaahh!\u201dSomeone lifted into the air, sent flying high by the wind. I squeezed my eyes shut, already aware of what would happen. The three Players in the air were cut into pieces.Drip, splat, splatter.Chunks of human flesh fell to the ground, along with blood rain. If you were lifted into the air, that was what would happen to you. I felt my head becoming ice cold. Perhaps it was the effect of the \u2018Calm Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 bundled into my \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019, but I was much calmer than when the Tutorial happened.\u2018From here on out\u2026 the real clearing begins.\u2019With the three deaths, a distortion appeared in the field. Although I knew it would happen, I was also able to feel it instinctively.\u2018And now, that monster will appear.\u2019I knew that it wasn\u2019t the time for me to be taking the position of an \u2018observer\u2019.\u2018I\u2019m going.\u2019Right now, I absolutely had to move.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: Hill of Blowing Wind (2)Hyukjin was the first to move.\u2018I\u2019m going.\u2019His gaze was pointed towards Sung-gu, or more precisely, a black haze to the right of Sung-gu.Yeonseo saw him move.\u2018Huh?\u2019The wind was abating, but it was still dangerous to move quickly.\u2013If something unexpected happens, stick to me.She remembered those words. Just moments ago, three Players had been pulled into the air and killed.\u2018If Hyukjin is moving like that\u2026\u2019It meant there was definitely an important reason for him to do so.\u2018I have to go, too.\u2019Matching the timing, Yeonseo followed him.[Using the movement skill Heavenly Demonic Flying Step.]With the help of her movement skill, she quickly reached Hyukjin. Because he was moving with physical ability alone, she was faster than him.During the three months while Hyukjin was in the \u2018Forest of Unknowns\u2019, Yeonseo had grown a lot. Her burning desire to catch up to him, no, to become stronger than him, made her strong.Hyukjin pointed at the black haze, and Yeonseo understood what he meant.\u201cOkidoki,\u201d she said, using Heavenly Demonic Flying Step to rapidly move to the haze.[Using the skill Single Hit Finisher.]Less than two seconds afterwards, Hyukjin also got within range and thrust his sword into the haze.[Using the special skill Excellent Strike.]Yeonseo heard a notice.[Devil Wraith has been killed.][EXP acquired.][55 Coins acquired.]It varied between monsters, but when killing level 30 monsters, you could get approximately 40 Coins.\u201855 Coins?\u2019She didn\u2019t even get a proper look at the monster, yet she obtained a whopping 55 Coins. That was even more Coins than when they killed the Great Orc Warrior.\u2018What did we just kill?\u2019Yeonseo was sure of it. If she hadn\u2019t worked with Hyukjin to kill this monster just now, an incredibly dangerous creature would have emerged.\u201cLooks like they\u2019re at their weakest when they\u2019re in their haze form,\u201d Yeonseo said.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd our boss realized that in advance.\u201dHyukjin nodded.\u2013Devil Wraith. With our skills at the time, we couldn\u2019t kill it. As you all know, the Devil Wraith is a monster that concealed itself on its own after killing ten people.The Devil Wraith was the product of the specter monster Wraith taking actual \u2018form\u2019 into a new monster. Its entire body was black, and it looked like a seagull the size of an eagle.\u2013As everyone here knows, the only way to kill it is to strike before it has completely taken form.Once it emerged, the Devil Wraith would continue to move until it killed ten people.\u2018A monster we can\u2019t kill with our current skills.\u2019That meant ten random people would be sacrificed. We had to kill it before it took complete form.\u2018The EXP\u2026 has been reduced.\u2019I attacked it directly, abandoning the observer position. Still, I knew it was a much better choice than seeing ten people die.[The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 admires the clean strike.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is surprised by your discernment.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 finds it regretful.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 continues to observe.]Hyukjin directly hunted the \u2018Devil Wraith\u2019, and as such, he didn\u2019t get EXP or Coins. Only Yeonseo got rewards. However, Hyukjin was a little shocked.\u2018How\u2026 should I interpret this?\u2019For a kill to count as him directly killing it, he had to do at least 50% of the damage to the monster.\u2018So I did over 50% of the damage?\u2019Did he get a lucky crit? Did he really deal more damage than Yeonseo, even though she was sure to have used Single Hit Finisher? It was hard for him to understand. He was forced to interpret the situation as him having done more damage than the Sword Empress whose level was higher than his.In any case, the atmosphere had turned on a dime.\u2018Because of what just happened\u2026 they\u2019re finally thinking straight.\u2019Three people died. The Players seemed to have gotten a bit more serious. Most of them were focused on destroying the rest of the pillars rather than getting distracted by what was happening over here.\u2018Good, that\u2019s a bit better.\u2019There were definitely Players who were interested in what was happening on this side, but for now, they appeared to be focusing on their task.\u2018Currently, there are four groups.\u2019The Players were currently raiding this gate in four groups: Players who were destroying the pillars, Players fighting the Wraiths, and Hyukjin and Yeonseo, who just killed the Devil Wraith. The last group was non-combat Players who were unable to do any of those things.\u2018The 7th pillar is falling.\u2019The 7th pillar collapsed, and at the same time, a change occurred in the field.[The \u2018Central Pillar\u2019 is appearing.]All of the Players got a quest notice.[Quest: Find the \u2018Offering Box\u2019.][The \u2018Offering Box\u2019 is located on the top of the \u2018Central Pillar\u2019.]The faces of the Players brightened. They got a clue to the clear\u2014the Offering Box, and the top of the Central Pillar.Kim Taechun yelled out in excitement, \u201cI was the one who found the clue!\u201dHis contribution in destroying the pillars was obviously unrivaled. As he swung his massive blunt weapon, an axe with great destructive force, he looked like a warrior born to fight.[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 is satisfied.]The situation was very favorable for Taechun. Blunt weapons had a great deal of attack power, but they were slow and it was hard to land a hit. That\u2019s why they could only be used with footwork techniques or skills that increased attack speed. However, such assist skills weren\u2019t necessary against pillars that didn\u2019t move.\u201cOryaaa!\u201dThe work on the 8th pillar began. The situation cast Players of the same type as Taechun in a good light.\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s do this!\u201dThe Players went at the pillars with greater intensity. There were a total of eighteen pillars here. Since a clue appeared after destroying seven pillars, they wanted to keep going in the same manner.Standing a little distance away from the pillars, Hyukjin spoke, his gaze pointed towards Sung-gu, Sunghyun, and Sunhwa.\u201cI\u2019m seeing a change in the mana around the Wraiths.\u201d\u201cShit, are they gonna become even scarier?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure. But the flow of mana surrounding the Wraiths has changed. It\u2019s probably one of two things. Either the Wraiths themselves will change to a different form, or different monsters will appear.\u201d\u201cGot it. I\u2019ll be mentally prepared.\u201d\u2013When the 7th pillar was broken, the Central Pillar appeared. We thought of that as a clue to the clear. It gave us hope. But then, we were forced to fight a terrible battle of life or death. Because the Wraiths disappeared and were replaced by Ghosts.Wraiths were specter monsters that came in the form of seagulls. Ghosts were human-shaped monsters made of black smoke.In regards to the Ghosts, Jo Sunghyun said this:\u2013They were skilled in both close and ranged attacks and had a paralyzation ability, making them extremely tricky to face. Their appearance marked the beginning of hell.They could fire black, concentrated marbles of mana from their fingertips, and not only did this cause damage, but it also had a special \u2018paralyzation effect\u2019 that rendered you unable to move.\u2013The wind in the latter half was so strong you couldn\u2019t endure it without getting down. The paralyzed Players were unable to get down, so\u2026The paralyzation itself wasn\u2019t all that scary. What was scary was that you wouldn\u2019t be able to get down if you were affected. If you couldn\u2019t get flat on the ground, the wind would send you flying into the air, and if that happened, you would meet a gruesome end, just like the three Players moments ago. The wind would tear you to pieces in midair.\u2018They\u2019ll start showing up here and there.\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Just then, one of the Players shouted, \u201cWatch out! A monster that can paralyze has shown up! If you get hit by that, it\u2019s over for you!\u201dHyukjin looked in the direction of the pillars. The speaker was mixed into the crowd, so he couldn\u2019t figure out who it was. However, he now knew that someone among the Players had the ability to immediately determine monster abilities.\u2018It\u2019s probably Han Seokmin.\u2019If his guess was right, that Player was Han Seokmin, one of the important figures of \u2018Taeguk Shield\u2019, the big guild propelled by Sungshin. So Han Seokmin was here, too.\u2018Doesn\u2019t look like he can see weak points yet.\u2019He was a Player with the special ability to determine the traits and weak points of monsters, but it didn\u2019t look like he could see the weak points yet.Human-shaped monsters made of black smoke began to appear. They weren\u2019t affected by the wind here. Their red eyes glowed brightly.\u2018They\u2019ll attack soon.\u2019Hyukjin turned back to his teammates. \u201cYou must absolutely avoid getting hit by the paralyzing poison.\u201dEveryone had to be on their guard. The Ghosts extended their hands. \u2018Condensed mana\u2019 the size of marbles would now come shooting from those fingertips. The spheres weren\u2019t all that fast. With a little determination, you could dodge them.However\u2014You had to check the wind arrows. The trajectory of the marbles changed according to the intensity and direction of the wind. The other people aside, Hyukjin had to quickly share what he knew and had figured out to his party members first.\u201cBe sure to check the intensity and direction of the wind. They\u2019ll influence the ranged attack.\u201dThe wind intensity and direction changed constantly. The field\u2019s overall difficulty was quickly rising.[Eye of Perception detects \u2018murderous intent\u2019.]\u2018That probably means I\u2019ve drawn the aggro.\u2019Eye of Perception didn\u2019t betray Hyukjin.\u2018That one.\u2019One of the Ghosts was aiming at Hyukjin. It was the fastest Ghost, apparently the strongest of the six that had appeared in various places around the field. Hyukjin focused on his senses.\u2018I can dodge.\u2019He saw it. Black, marble-sized spheres came flying towards him. They appeared to be flying in a straight line, and there were a staggering ten of them, aiming straight at him and him alone.He checked the wind once more.He had to dodge with that direction in mind.\u2018I can\u2019t make too big of a movement.\u2019His mind honed to peak concentration. He saw nothing else in his surroundings\u2014just him, the Ghost, and those black spheres.\u2018If I make too large a movement, the others will target me.\u2019He had to avoid the Ghost\u2019s attack with the smallest movement possible, the most efficient way.[Observer\u2019s Eye seeks the flow of nature.]\u2018I can\u2026 see the trajectory.\u2019The path Hyukjin drew out in his head and the trajectory \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 showed him were exactly the same.\u2018Half a step to the right.\u2019He didn\u2019t move much, just half a step. He had to show his party members. He wanted to show them with his body how they should move.The black spheres shot towards him like an arrow, as if to pierce his body. At that moment, Sunhwa flinched.\u201cOp-Oppa!\u201d she nearly shouted. In her eyes, Hyukjin was in great danger. It looked as if he would be struck right this instant by those spheres. He only took half a step to the side, and for the slightest moment, it seemed as if time stopped.Swoosh\u2013!The Ghost\u2019s attack didn\u2019t hit him, the black spheres barely whizzing past his body.The smallest movement, the greatest efficiency. The way he dodged was seen by all of his party members. They were all geniuses.Sung-gu nodded, thinking, \u2018So that\u2019s how you do it.\u2019Yeonseo, Yoohyun, Sunhwa, and Sunghyun read Hyukjin\u2019s intent as well. He had just taught them with his body. He showed them that this is what they should do, that there was no better method than this. It was literally a living lecture.In the meantime, screams came from the area where the pillars were.\u201cI-I-I-I can\u2019t move!\u201d\u201cW-Wait! Stop! Don\u2019t destroy the pillar!\u201dPeople screamed, but it was too late. The 8th pillar was destroyed. It wasn\u2019t done on purpose. It was simply terrible timing.The four paralyzed Players blanched in horror.\u201cN-N-No\u2014!\u201dYoohyun instantly tackled one of them, bringing the paralyzed man forcefully to the ground. One of them was fortunate, fortunate that Yoohyun happened to be standing next to him.\u201cA-AAAAAAH!\u201dThe other three faced the same terrible fate as the earlier Players. They were lifted into the air and brutally killed. Body parts fell to the ground, a fountain of blood bursting in the air, scattered everywhere by the strong wind.The Players were instantly rendered speechless.\u201c\u2026\u201dBecause of a timing mistake, another three people died.Kim Taechun growled, \u201cWhich son of a bitch destroyed the pillar with that timing?\u201d It was almost as if he\u2019d become the true leader here. He roared in rage, acting like he was the arbitrator of this place. \u201cWho the hell was it?!\u201dFor him, this was a good opportunity to show his strength.Using Heavenly Demonic Flying Step, Yeonseo quickly swept past him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time for it, in my opinion. Not gonna kill the Ghosts?\u201dAfter using its ranged attack, a little of the \u2018black smoke\u2019 that made up the Ghost dissipated. It obviously looked weakened. Yeonseo focused on the \u2018red eyes\u2019. She didn\u2019t know if the eyes were a weak point, but they looked like it.\u2018The red eyes.\u2019She decided to thrust her sword at that point. Her intuition told her that she couldn\u2019t kill it in one hit. The wind would continue to blow, and she couldn\u2019t kill the Ghost with one hit. She had to whittle it down slowly. Yoohyun also grasped what he had to do and moved towards another Ghost.Yeonseo, Yoohyun, and Sung-gu. The three of them started hunting the Ghosts, and other Players began to hunt the Ghosts around them as well. If they didn\u2019t kill the Ghosts, they would be the ones to die.Most of the Players saw this:Ghost LVL ?However, they had no other choice, because it was kill or be killed. While they were fighting, Hyukjin stood next to Sunhwa and activated Observer\u2019s Eye.\u2018The 8th pillar was destroyed.\u2019That meant from here on out, the key item could appear.\u2018I have to find it.\u2019His party members were doing the best they could in their individual roles. Regardless of how other people saw it, the true leader was Hyukjin. And as the leader, as the person responsible for these people, he already knew exactly what he had to do.\u2018Find it\u2026!\u2019The description of Observer\u2019s Eye was \u2018eyes that can read the flow of nature\u2019. From the locations where the Ghosts appeared to the places where the Wraiths first showed up, he pieced together all of the information and examined the field anew with Observer\u2019s Eye.\u2018I\u00a0must\u2026 find it.\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: Hill of Blowing Wind (3)\u2013The pillars of the Ruined Temple were a clue for the clear.The pillars could be destroyed. Every time these special pillars were destroyed, the field would change a little. Those changes weren\u2019t limited to gusts of wind or monsters being spawned.\u2018Inside the pillars, there should be two randomly generated clear-necessary items\u2026\u201dSo how\u2026 did they end up in Darongi\u2019s Inventory?

Inside were two items.[Wind Shoes 1/2]Shoes imbued with the blessing of wind.

He had somehow managed to snag both shoes.\u2018Just where the heck did you get these?\u2019As if he read my mind, Darongi opened his mouth wide\u2014though it was still tiny\u2014and showed off his front teeth.\u2018Did you gnaw a hole into the pillars to get them?\u2019Darongi puffed out his chest and beat his cotton-ball fist into his chest with pride.[\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605]A strange set of marks appeared over his head, which I interpreted to roughly mean, \u201cI\u2019m this awesome, see?\u201d This fellow sure was full of amusing surprises.\u2018The future has changed once again.\u2019Everywhere I went, history changed. In the past, the Players here were unable to show a united front. The reason was simple; it was because this item was divided into two parts.\u2018Two different Players got one part each of this item.\u2019One was picked up by Jo Sunghyun, and the other was picked up by some other Player. As the description made clear, this item would only work if it was worn as a united pair.\u2018After many twists and turns, Sunghyun finally managed to get both parts, but the process took quite a long time.\u2019It was a\u00a0rare\u00a0grade item. If I\u2019d been one of the people to get a part of this item in the past, even I might have found it difficult to hand it over to Sunghyun.Sunghyun said this:\u2013In the meantime, many more Players died. Things might have been different if we\u2019d had an outstanding leader at the time, but\u2026 it was still too early back then.Did that mean I was an outstanding leader, then?\u2018I\u2019m not too sure about that.\u2019At the very least, I knew what I had to do right now. What I did now would determine the number of survivors from this field and the rewards we would reap at the end.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 continues to observe.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 wonders how you will act.][The \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 is curious about the details of the exchange.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 would like to see a slightly more exciting scene.]As always, the Guardians were watching us.

You didn\u2019t forget your bet with me, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026I have not.\u201dAfter saying that, Senia\u2019s mouth moved silently. I couldn\u2019t hear what she was saying, so she was probably giving the Guardians some background info, like what kind of bet we made and how I won, which entitled me to a one-time opening of the \u2018intermediate-grade\u2019 Item Shop.\u201cOpen it for me now.\u201d\u201cI will open the Item Shop for you. However, I can only do it one time.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dSenia was implicitly asking me if I was really going to open the store in such an unsafe place.

As expected, the System wasn\u2019t as easy to navigate as I hoped. This time, I was able to scrape by thanks to fate and luck. It was merely a so-called \u2018curious coincidence\u2019.\u2018There\u2019s no guarantee that I\u2019ll continue to have this kind of luck.\u2019That meant I had to plan while thinking of the slightly worse scenarios, as well as the worst-case scenarios. My mistake turned into a learning experience.\u2018But I\u2019m still 3,000 Coins short.\u2019What method would allow me to get 3,000k Coins right now? I\u00a0could\u00a0call everyone and get Coins from them, but that didn\u2019t seem all that easy. They were all focused on faithfully carrying out their roles. They were destroying pillars, hunting Ghosts, and staying on their toes for any Devil Wraiths that might appear. The others didn\u2019t have any time to spare, either.\u2018I need at least 50,000 Coins.\u2019Just then, my Eye of Perception sensed something.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 LeiProofreader \u2013 AshJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The promising thief, Gu Sungmin, was enraged when he found out that all of his Coins had vanished. He realized that there was a thief out there with more outstanding skills than his own.\u2018I can\u2019t go back like this!\u2019He felt too wronged to go back empty-handed. It was fine for him to steal, but getting stolen from was unforgivable.\u2018Just who the hell was it?!\u2019He had no idea, but it was fine. Wanting to make up for his losses, he went up to the 12th floor. There had to be a lot of Players there, after all. He was determined to undertake the slight risk and empty all their pockets.But it really wasn\u2019t his day, and he suddenly ended up in a flash gate called the \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019.\u2018Fine, this is better anyway!\u2019Using the chaos to his advantage, it was a very good opportunity for him to steal coins while pretending to break pillars.[Coins acquired.][+1,600 Coins]Darn, a paltry 1,600 Coins? These Players were supposed to be famous and all, but they were all broke as hell.[Coins acquired.][+900 Coins.]Regardless, he was raking the Coins in.

As long as he did as So Yoohyun said, there wasn\u2019t any risk of death, for the time being. A few super speedy Players were also fighting those terrifying monsters called Ghosts for them. All he had to do was to keep pretending he was breaking pillars while leeching Coins.\u2018What if they can\u2019t buy potions because of me?\u2019Potions were crucial in raids. It was no exaggeration to call a potion a second life.\u2018Ah fuck, whatever. That\u2019s none of my concern, is it?\u2019His precious, precious money was more important right now. Other guys hitting the bucket was actually no concern of his, was it? That was just their luck.[Coins acquired.][+4,300 Coins]That should bring his total count to 23,500 Coins.

Fuming, he looked around.[Using the innate ability Wallet Perception.]One of these fuckers definitely stole his money.

Starting now, I\u2019m going to do item enhancement.\u201dEnhancement was content that Guardians liked to watch. There were definitely Guardians who went wild for this kind of stuff.[The \u2018Barrier of Blue Light\u2019 has established a temporary Safe Zone around you.]I had heard a notice from this Guardian once in the past, saying that the Barrier of Blue Light was paying attention to me. Afterwards, I didn\u2019t get any more notices, so I forgot about them.\u2018The Barrier of Blue Light\u2026 was still watching Senia\u2019s channel, huh.\u2019In any case, I was thankful.

If that was true, there shouldn\u2019t be any reason for the System to go out of its way to state that the success rate was 140%. There had to be something different about it for sure.\u2018What could it be?\u2019The notices continued.[Enhancing Wind Shoes.][Congratulations!][The enhancement was successful!][Wind Shoes have been enhanced to Wind Shoes +1.]For a brief moment, I saw it.\u2018This was\u2026 a blue enhancement?\u2019I mentally reeled.\u2018Ah. This is what it is!\u2019It was known that the people who were called \u2018Masters\u2019 in the past did enhancements using a specific method. They had distribution channels and connections all over the world and shared tips and tricks only among their exclusive ranks. Their special ability to make outstanding items was so coveted it was no exaggeration to say that they were raking in all of the world\u2019s money.\u2018The color of the item name\u2026 is blue.\u2019With the enhancement, the previously white item name turned blue.\u2018Above blue is purple. Above purple is brown. Above brown\u2026\u2019Was the legendary black grade, which could only be found a few times in the entire world.\u2018It was definitely said that you need an extremely special method\u2026\u2019I hadn\u2019t done all that much just now. I did buy the materials at a ridiculously high price because of the penalty, but that couldn\u2019t be helped. I didn\u2019t use any of those special enhancement methods the \u2018Masters\u2019 were said to have used, nor did I have a specific enhancement skill.\u2018But I was still able to make a blue item?\u2019What in the world?\u2018I didn\u2019t do anything all that special.\u2019Could it be that I had an incredible talent for enhancement? I was able to pull off a blue enhancement without any skills or innate abilities. It varied between items, but I think I remembered people saying that a +1 blue item was typically about the same level as a +2 white item.\u2018Let\u2019s think about it later.\u2019For now, it was more important to clear this gate and get out.___________[Wind Shoes +1]Shoes imbued with the blessing of wind.

Incredible fortune. Just as I was thinking that, I felt one of the Ghosts aiming for Jo Sunghyun. Black spheres had already been fired.\u2018Sunghyun\u2026 can\u2019t dodge.\u2019There was no one else who would take the hit for him. Eye of Perception was telling me that the only person who could act was me.\u2018Will he be okay if he gets hit by that?\u2019I wasn\u2019t sure. He might be fine, or he might not.

As soon as I saw the black spheres, as soon as the Ghost attacked Sunghyun, I moved.\u2018Guess I should take some insurance.\u2019\u201cYeonseo!\u201d I shouted loudly.I felt her turn to look at me.

His body wasn\u2019t capable of keeping up with his thoughts yet, and he didn\u2019t have a class specialized in physical ability to begin with.\u2018Oh-Oh no.\u2019He recognized that he was in danger, but there was nothing he could do. A gruesome future started sketching itself out in his head. But then, the hyung he met earlier, the hyung who called himself Kim Hyukjin, helped him. Perhaps from his haste to jump in, he got hit by the spheres in his vital points.\u2018...\u2019At that moment, Sunghyun was moved. He never thought that someone would throw themselves into danger for his sake. After receiving Sunghyun\u2019s thanks, Hyukjin said, \u201cIt\u2019s way better for me to get hit than you.\u201d\u201c...You were a tank?\u201d\u201cWell, no. Not really.\u201dHyukjin was about to say \u201cI\u2019m overgeared\u201d, but he swallowed the words.Right now, Jo Sunghyun was extremely touched. Hyukjin wasn\u2019t even a tank. He wasn\u2019t a tank, yet he still threw himself into harm\u2019s way.\u201cThis person put his life on the line,\u201d thought Sunghyun.That was a slight misunderstanding, but in any case, Sunghyun currently believed he owed Hyukjin for saving his life and that he had met a real adult.\u201c...I will repay this debt until I die.\u201d\u201cNo need to die,\u201d Hyukjin said with a smile. \u201cSee that Central Pillar over there?\u201d\u201cYes. We have to get the Offering Box from there.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that every time the small pillars are destroyed, the Central Pillar gets lower.\u201dThat was why Kim Taechun and the other Players were breaking the pillars right now.\u201cHowever, with every pillar that is broken, the difficulty will also rise.\u201dAs a result, if possible, it would be best to clear the gate now.\u201cYou should see a weak current of wind in a spiral shape around the Central Pillar. Take a close look.\u201d\u201c...\u201dSunghyun peered at the Central Pillar, heightening his mana perception as much as possible.\u2018There really\u2026 is one?\u2019He didn\u2019t realize all this time, but after taking a closer look, there really was a current.\u201cNow, take this.\u201d\u201c...Huh?\u201dHe got an item, a\u00a0rare-grade item. It was a precious item he\u2019d never heard of, one that even had an agility stat boost.\u201cY-You\u2019re giving this to me?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m letting you borrow it.\u201dOnce again, Sunghyun was moved.\u2018How can he trust me\u2026?\u2019How could this hyung trust him enough to lend him an item like this?\u2018And why? Just what does he see in me?\u2019He hadn\u2019t done anything to help Hyukjin, but Hyukjin was lending him such a precious item, as if saving his life wasn\u2019t enough.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be that moved. This is a place of life and death. I\u2019m just trying to use the method that can achieve a slightly more efficient clear.\u201dSunghyun nodded. He was sure of it. Kim Hyukjin was a \u2018real adult\u2019. As an 18-year-old youth, his sensitivity for such things was massively heightened.\u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d* * *Like a true observer, I gave Sunghyun the information I had obtained through observation and told the boy what he needed to do in rather concrete detail.\u201cYou can do it, right?\u201d\u201cI will try.\u201d\u201cIt might be dangerous.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cYou have to ride the current well.

No, it was\u00a0definitely\u00a0dangerous.\u2018But you pulled it off in the past.\u2019Even with just the base, unenhanced Wind Shoes, Jo Sunghyun cleared this gate. At least half of the Players died, but he cleared it all the same. He would be able to do it this time, too.I stared at the Central Pillar. Captured by Observer\u2019s Eye was a stream of wind-attribute mana flowing faintly in a spiral around the Central Pillar.\u2018He\u2019ll ride that current up.\u2019That current would protect Sunghyun from the strong winds blowing in this field. As long as he could ride that current without falling out, he\u2019d be able to get all the way to the top without being influenced by the other wind.\u2018Jo Sunghyun\u2026 can do it.\u2019Sunghyun began to run. In my eyes, the kid was indeed full of talent.\u2018He\u2019s got exactly the right route.\u2019Sunghyun had a precise eye for the flow. He started climbing up the current, looking as if he were stepping on empty air, almost as if there were an invisible spiral staircase.\u2018He\u2019s doing great.\u2019The kid was doing much better than I expected. Was it thanks to the Wind Shoes enhanced into a +1 blue item? In any case, Sunghyun was climbing up the Central Pillar in his own way.\u2018Alright. Now\u2026\u2019It was time for me to do what I had to do, because starting now, the situation would change yet again. I approached Yoohyun, taking care not to walk too fast, going at a speed that wouldn\u2019t catch the eye.\u201cYoohyun. Listen to me while you attack. Be discreet.\u201dWhile punching the 10th pillar, Yoohyun answered in a small voice, \u201cYes, hyungnim.\u201d\u201cSee Sunghyun starting to go up the Central Pillar over there?\u201dYoohyun nodded after looking from the corners of his eyes. He was a little surprised, but he didn\u2019t show it too much.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a change.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a System induced change. Some new quest wasn\u2019t going to be issued. This was just my prediction based on the current situation.I gave him only one order.\u201cIf anyone acts up, beat them up. \u2018Til they\u2019re on death\u2019s door.\u201d\u201cOn death\u2019s door?\u201d\u201cYeah. Don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t argue, just smash.\u201dSure enough, Kim Taechun suddenly shouted in rage.\u201cHEY, YOU SON OF A BITCH!\u201dHis gaze was pointed towards the kid climbing the Central Pillar.\u201cWhat kinda shit are you trying to pull on your own?! Why\u2019re you taking action without any orders, you little shit!!!\u201dHaving received an order from me, Yoohyun moved towards the man loudly displaying his courage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: The Offering Box\u201cWhat kinda shit are you trying to pull on your own?! Why\u2019re you taking action without any orders, you little shit!!!\u201dHe was being an embarrassment.That was exactly how I saw it\u2014what Kim Taechun was doing right now wasn\u2019t \u2018leading\u2019. He was simply embarrassing himself. The situation was favorable for Taechun, so he was showing off his power by whacking the stationary pillars with his slow but destructive weapon, making large, flashy movements that looked impressive but wouldn\u2019t be at all effective in a real battle.\u2018Actually, Yoohyun\u2019s dealt more damage.\u2019It was just that Yoohyun was using his fists and had slightly more efficient and simple movements that weren\u2019t obvious to the eye.Taechun was merely a grandstander reveling in the attention right now. What kind of insight did he have to give the orders around here?\u201cShut up, friend.\u201dHaving gotten in range, Yoohyun swung his fists without any notice.\u2018Whoa.\u2019 Honestly, I was surprised. \u2018They did say there were times when Yoohyun was a real hardass, but it\u2019s my first time seeing it.\u2019People said that he was normally an extremely mild-tempered and kind guy, but in certain special situations, he\u2019d show unmatched decisiveness and swiftness of action. I guessed now was one of those moments.Pow! Pow! Pow!Before Yoohyun\u2019s merciless fists, Taechun wasn\u2019t able to show a single ounce of his courage.\u201cY-Y-You son of a bitch!\u201dTaechun swung his axe wide.Whoompf!His axe did have a great deal of destructive force, but it was simply too slow.\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201dSimply by taking one very, very casual step backwards, Yoohyun rendered Taechun\u2019s axe attack ineffective.\u2018I can\u2026 see it again.\u2019I saw strength gathering on Yoohyun\u2019s heels. What I saw with Observer\u2019s Eye was rather different from seeing with my physical eyes.\u2018He\u2019ll definitely step in now.\u2019I could see how he would go in, how he would attack.\u2018Aiming for the abdomen.\u2019Yoohyun extended his right fist, exactly as I\u2019d seen with my Observer\u2019s Eye. Then, he attacked the place I\u2019d eyed, the spot right underneath the solar plexus.\u2018Afterwards, he\u2019ll immediately grab the back of the neck\u2026\u2019I read Yoohyun\u2019s movements.\u2018And strike with his knee.\u2019Yoohyun was going to use one of his skills, \u2018Beginner Knee Kick\u2019. I could see the flow of mana, like Observer\u2019s Eye was showing me how the mana moved when Beginner Knee Kick was used.Crack!As his knee connected, the loud crack of breaking bone rang out. After taking a Beginner Knee Kick to the jaw, Taechun blacked out on the spot. No matter how great he thought he was, the extremely spirited Kim Taechun was helpless in front of So Yoohyun.The Players breaking the pillars halted for a moment.\u201cWh-What the\u2014?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on all of a sudden?\u201dBut no one was able to stop Yoohyun. They simply watched the one-sided beating from afar.\u201cWh-Why\u2019s he getting hit?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 getting beaten up pretty badly\u2026?\u201d\u201cC-Could it be a quest?\u201dUnless it was a quest, why would Kim Taechun get beaten so mercilessly? The guy was even knocked unconscious, as if a simple beating wasn\u2019t enough. Yoohyun scratched his head, returning to his usual kind, gentle herbivore look.\u201cDidn\u2019t think he\u2019d pass out, but oh well.\u201d With a good-natured smile, Yoohyun returned to the pillars. \u201cWell then, let\u2019s leave that guy be and do what we have to do, fellows.\u201dEven I was a little dumbfounded. Yoohyun was the real \u2018two-faced\u2019 person here, not Yeonseo. The faces of the Players hardened over. Not a single one of them dared to protest.From this, I learned one thing.\u2018Rational persuasion based on logic and reasoning\u2026\u2019What would have happened if Yoohyun had tried to do that, instead?\u2018It would have wasted a ton of time, and someone would\u2019ve definitely tried to interfere with Sunghyun in that time.\u2019Kim Taechun\u2019s influence had been extremely strong. If he tried to pull down Sunghyun for whatever reason, a few Players would have been influenced by him. What Yoohyun did was very efficient.\u2018Beating first and asking later\u2026\u2019It wasn\u2019t exactly what I had envisioned, but I found my lips quirking into a smile.\u2018Is sometimes a pretty good choice, huh?\u2019Rational persuasion was, of course, the best, but there were certainly situations where it wasn\u2019t possible. In such cases, subduing the opposition with violence and strength wasn\u2019t too bad an option. I learned something new again. In front of Yoohyun\u2019s overwhelming force, all the Players were as meek and calm as lambs.\u2018Gu Sungmin\u2019s as busy as ever.\u2019The man was busily stealing Coins. I was surprised he was still going at it in a situation like this.\u2018Well, he\u2019s just Playing in his own way.\u2019Just like how combat Players focused on killing monsters in combat, Gu Sungmin was also simply Playing in his own way. That was how I decided to look at it.\u2018Then I need to Play my way, too.\u2019Thanks to Gu Sungmin\u2019s contribution, the completion of my scenario became much more likely, since I would need a lot of Coins today. I glanced at Darongi.[!]He didn\u2019t move. It wasn\u2019t hard for me to figure out why.\u201cAh, does he not have that many Coins?\u201dFrom Darongi\u2019s lack of enthusiasm, Gu Sungmin apparently didn\u2019t have that many Coins in his Inventory. The cunning squirrel was probably planning on stealing them later, once they\u2019d been gathered into a tidy pile. Looking at Darongi\u2019s expression, I said, \u201cWhat? Is he too amateur hour for you?\u201dDarongi nodded. In the eyes of a theft genius, a promising thief\u2019s movements were far too pathetic.\u201cBut you\u2019ll still go for me later, right?\u201dI needed Coins\u2014I would need a lot of Coins in the next part. The enhancement took too many Coins, but thankfully, I had Darongi.The 11th pillar was destroyed.A powerful gust of wind rushed in again. Laying flat on the ground, I craned my head up, wondering if Sunghyun was doing well.\u2018He is.\u2019He was moving up the weak mana current. When I focused my gaze on him, I was able to see his movements with far greater clarity.\u2018Now. Right now.\u2019The timing I saw was the same as the timing Sunghyun saw. He jumped high into the air, using the special ability of the Wind Shoes, \u2018Imaginary Running Start\u2019. Down here, an incredibly strong wind was blowing, but the mana of the Central Pillar was protecting Sunghyun from its influence.He was so high that clouds were obscuring him and I could no longer see his path.\u2018He\u2019ll get to the top soon.\u2019The wind abated a little. There were no victims from the 11th pillar\u2019s destruction. Everyone got flat on the ground to avoid the wind, and it looked like most of the Players had gotten used to the Ghosts and Wraiths. The Players now were a lot different from the Players that first came in. Even if someone was hit by a Ghost\u2019s projectile, the others would push them to the ground while someone would go out to fight the Ghost.* * *\u2018Things\u2026 are progressing pretty well.\u2019My initial disappointment faded a little. Time passed, and I eventually saw Sunghyun climbing back down from high above. He had something on his back, like he was shouldering a backpack.\u2018The Offering Box.\u2019The crux of the clear, the end-all and be-all of the key items, the Offering Box, was coming down.\u2018We\u2019re now on the 12th pillar.\u2019It would soon break. This was the perfect time to clear. If we broke too many pillars, the field\u2019s difficulty would get too high, and if we broke too few, it would be too difficult to get up the Central Pillar.\u201cSung-gu.\u201d\u201cYeah, what?\u201d\u201cWhat does your long-ranged attack look like?\u201d\u201cAbout 50 meters, at most? It\u2019s pretty accurate, too. But it does lack a bit of power.\u201dThat was enough.\u201cThere\u2019s a high chance that monsters will spawn near the Central Pillar.\u201d\u201cMonsters?\u201dSung-gu scowled. His expression said something like, \u201cThe Wraiths and Ghosts are already enough to handle, but there are gonna be more?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of monsters?\u201d\u201cNot sure. If this is a gate artificially made for someone\u2019s amusement\u2026\u201dThere was a high chance it was. However, I didn\u2019t outright say that it was made by the Guardians.\u201cIf it were me, I would throw in some flying monsters about now.\u201dSung-gu\u2019s mouth opened in a big O. He pointed upwards.\u201cJust what\u2026 are you? You\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 boss.\u201dThere were two flying monsters in the sky. They had the bodies of a bird, but their faces were rather human-like. They were birds with the approximate resemblance of a human face, one that looked like it was clumsily sculpted out of mud.\u2018Inmyeonjo.\u2019Of these mythological creatures, these two were low-grade Inmyeonjo. The higher in rank an Inmyeonjo became, the more human-like its face became.\u201cIf I had designed this gate, there\u2019s a very high chance I would have interfered with Sunghyun.\u201d\u201cThen I just have to cover him, right?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cDayum. Your insight\u2019s hot shit, that\u2019s for sure.\u201dStanding some distance away, Yoohyun had also spotted the Inmyeonjo. I saw him stealing a glance at me. It seemed that he guessed something was happening from me talking to Sung-gu. In very commendable fashion, he took initiative to yell, \u201cThose of you who can support the Player coming down over there with the Offering Box, cover him!\u201dHowever, I knew it was pointless. There wouldn\u2019t be many Players who would do as Yoohyun said.\u2018They\u2019ll be too afraid of pulling the aggro.\u2019Inmyeonjo LVL 29It was absolutely not a low-level monster. The top Rankers like Yoohyun were currently level 32. For the majority of the Players here, the level of the Inmyeonjo would appear as a red \u2018?\u2019 It was only natural that they would be scared.Sung-gu rushed towards the Central Pillar. Of course, I did so as well.\u2018To prepare for any unexpected circumstances.\u2019It was right for me to keep my distance as an observer as much as possible, and I did intend on doing that for the time being, but it was always possible a situation might arise where I would need to act.Sung-gu used a skill.\u2018It\u2019s probably\u2026 Fire Arrow.\u2019He didn\u2019t seem all that concerned by the possibility of drawing the monster\u2019s aggro. Sunhwa had joined us, sticking close to Sung-gu\u2019s side. She was taking action on her own, without needing me to explain the details.An arrow made of fire landed directly on the wing of one of the two Inmyeonjo that had appeared.Sung-gu said to me, \u201cThe goal isn\u2019t to kill them anyway, right?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dThe goal right now was to protect Sunghyun, not hunt the monsters.\u201cThe cooltime on this skill is short, so I\u2019ll keep giving cover fire. If I pull the aggro, Sunhwa, help me out a bit.\u201dSung-gu used another Fire Arrow. Jo Sunghyun continued to clamber down along the Central Pillar\u2019s mana, not very bothered by the Inmyeonjo that had spawned right in front of him.\u2018He\u2019ll be down s\u2014\u2019At that moment, I saw something. Something was crawling up the pillar from the ground, a monster about 2 meters large with the shape of a lizard.Bigmouth Lizard LVL 22It was a lizard that could open its mouth incredibly wide. The monster was crawling rapidly up the Central Pillar, opening its mouth wide as if to swallow Sunghyun alive.\u2018That thing itself won\u2019t be a problem.\u2019But if Sunghyun were to slip out of the mana current because of it?\u2018He\u2019d die.\u2019And I couldn\u2019t let that happen.[Using the special skill Flash Step.]I approached the Central Pillar quickly, then began to climb it. Even though I couldn\u2019t go all that high, I could certainly catch up to the lizard. I launched myself at it, tightly grasping its slender body with my legs. Then, I raised my dagger and stabbed it in the crown of its head.[Using the skill Excellent Strike.]Thankfully, this lizard monster\u2019s skin was extremely thin, and it wasn\u2019t a monster with very high defense.Splurt! Splurt! Splurt! Splurt!My hand went down multiple times, green blood pouring out the entire time.Szzzzzz\u2013!The acidic monster blood landed on my body, but I didn\u2019t flinch. Right now, I was wearing \u2018Great Orc Warrior\u2019 armor, which was used all throughout the mid-game.While I was doing that, Sunghyun passed me and continued down. Sunghyun seemed to know exactly what he needed to do, too. In the end, his two feet touched the ground.[Bigmouth Lizard has been hunted.][EXP is decreased.][Items will not be dropped.]That was fine. A reduction in EXP was an acceptable loss right now. It stung a little, but it was a loss I could swallow.But just then, I got notices.[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is impressed.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 gives you a sponsorship of 300 Coins.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 continues to observe.]There was even another kind of notice.[The \u2018Barrier of Blue Light\u2019 wants to help you.][The \u2018Barrier of Blue Light\u2019 states their strong will to sponsor you.]\u2018What?\u2019Helping was helping, and sponsoring was sponsoring, so what was \u2018stating their strong will to sponsor\u2019 all about? Were they just expressing aloud their desire to help me?[The \u2018Barrier of Blue Light\u2019 promises a big sponsorship.]I didn\u2019t know what they would give me. For now, I decided to focus on what was more important and clear this place.\u2018So now\u2026 the Offering Box\u2019s influence will kick in.\u2019A notice confirmed my thoughts.[The \u2018Offering Box\u2019 holy relic is beginning to assert its influence.]____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76: The Offering Box (2)The Offering Box reached the ground.[The \u2018Offering Box\u2019 holy relic is beginning to assert its influence.][The \u2018Offering Box\u2019 holy relic calms the wind blowing in the \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019.][The \u2018Offering Box\u2019 holy relic heals all who are injured.][The \u2018Offering Box\u2019 holy relic eliminates all monsters.]Thanks to the Offering Box\u2019s effects, we were out of the woods. The wind disappeared, as did the monsters. All injuries were treated. Naturally, the unconscious Kim Taechun also got up.\u201c...Dammit. Let my guard down.\u201dHe grumbled, but he didn\u2019t blatantly seek trouble with Yoohyun. He must have sensed that the atmosphere had changed somehow and wanted to see how the situation proceeded.\u2018Alright. Then we have to move onto the next part.\u2019In order to clear this gate, we had to \u2018satisfy\u2019 the \u2018Offering Box\u2019. Anyone could click the Offering Box, and anyone could read its description.[Offering Box of the Wind Temple]A small box for collecting offerings. Those who come to the Temple of Wind must show their sincerity to this Offering Box. When the Offering Box is full, the Blessing of the Wind Temple will be granted.The same quest was given to everyone who clicked on it.[Quest: Donate 100k Coins!][Quest reward: \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019 clear]So basically, the final quest of this place was to donate 100k Coins to the Offering Box. No matter who made the donation, the gate would be cleared. How much someone donated would not be publicized.In the past, Jo Sunghyun put it like this:\u2013In the end, we started putting in Coins in order of time of arrival, leaving it to people\u2019s consciences. There was no way to check how much each person put in. Still, we thought it was the most reasonable method.Jo Sunghyun did say that he had dumped all 15,000 Coins he had on him at the time.\u2018That\u2019s why Sunghyun was chosen by the Offering Box.\u2019He put in 15,000 Coins and was chosen by the Offering Box. In other words, all of the other Players put in less than 15,000 Coins.\u2018There were probably a lot of people who pretended to donate but didn\u2019t.\u2019On the other hand, the rather naive Jo Sunghyun invested his entire fortune. He might have done so thinking that it was something a person should do, the right thing to do so that everyone could live.\u2018If it\u2019s the same as the past\u2026 I just have to donate at least 15,000 Coins.\u2019Then, I would be chosen by the Offering Box.The de-facto leader right now, Yoohyun, stated his opinion. \u201cShould we go around and put in as many Coins as each person can handle?\u201dEveryone shuffled awkwardly. It wasn\u2019t surprising. The clear would be achieved even if you didn\u2019t put in any Coins and someone else did it instead. Naturally, what ended up happening was that people went up one by one, pretending to put in Coins. I couldn\u2019t see anything with Eye of Perception or Observer\u2019s Eye.\u2018I can\u2019t see how much they put in.\u2019It was my turn.\u2018I\u2026\u2019I checked how many Coins I had. I had 21,500 Coins left after buying Enhancement Crystals and Element Affinity Powder, but Darongi had earned more Coins in the meantime.[Held Coins: 31,500]The theft genius Darongi had stolen again from the promising thief Gu Sungmin. It was a very good development for me.[Set how many Coins you will offer to the \u2018Offering Box\u2019.][Coins: ______ ]In the past, Sunghyun was chosen by the Offering Box with 15,000 Coins.[Coins: 30,000][Offer 30,000 Coins?]There was a second confirmation notice, and I invested 30,000 Coins just like that. After all, the Coins themselves weren\u2019t important right now, so I decided to play it a little safer. I would probably be the person who donated the most Coins here.A few people did yell out that they\u2019d been robbed.\u201cHuh? My Coins?\u201d\u201cM-My Coins have disappeared!\u201dHowever, they quickly shut up. Making a big fuss about their Coins disappearing in a situation like this was the same thing as saying \u2018I don\u2019t have Coins, so I can\u2019t pay\u2019. Even if they were frustrated, they couldn\u2019t quite say so. They could only pretend to put Coins in the Offering Box.Sunghyun also went up to the Offering Box and put in Coins. Not long after that, a notice rang out.[The Offering Box is full of offerings.][The Blessing of the Wind Temple will be granted to the Players who have come here.]The Offering Box was filled faster than I expected. I put in 30k, and Sunghyun probably put in 15k. Collecting the remaining 55k didn\u2019t take as long as I thought.[Once the rewards calculation of the Flash Gate \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019 has concluded, all Players will automatically leave the gate.]The Players rejoiced. With the Ghosts appearing and strong gusts killing the Players, approximately fifteen people died here.\u2018The victim count is far lower.\u2019In the past, at least 150 people had died. Compared to that, we experienced 1/10 of the loss. I would just have to see what kind of butterfly effects this result would have in the future.A yellow [!] appeared over the Offering Box. It was apparently only visible to me. When I clicked it with my eyes, a message popped up.[The Offering Box has chosen you.][You are granted the Offering Box\u2019s reward.]The Offering Box would only reward one person\u2014the Player who donated the most Coins.[The Offering Box will determine what you most \u2018need\u2019.]This was the reward I\u2019d wanted.

Cognitive dissonance refers to the phenomenon that occurs when there are discrepancies or inconsistencies with what one believes and actually sees. This ability, which forcefully creates \u2018dissonance\u2019 between what is seen and what is perceived, will be a great help when concealing the Player\u2019s abilities, achievements, or crimes. The ability of this \u2018dissonance\u2019 is tied to one\u2019s talent, whereby its efficacy and effect are based on the Player\u2019s innate talent.Duration: 30 minutesCooldown: 12 hoursConditions to use:The will to assist from a Guardian with [Bulwark] [Hallucination] [Illusion] [Defense] [Fortress] [Mountain Fortress] [Barrier] [Eye] [Apparition] in their name.A body that has awakened an innate ability related to perception.It was an ability that forcefully created disparity between what one saw with their eyes and what one actually perceived.\u2018And the use and effect is determined by my talent.\u2019Since I\u2019d never used it before, I didn\u2019t know what exactly that would look like.

The motes of blue light looked like they would be scattered into the air, but then, they began to fly over like a cloud of fireflies.\u2018It\u2019s heading\u2026\u2019I could tell.\u2018Towards me.\u2019This was basically screaming to the whole world, \u2018GUYS, I GOT THE REWARD!\u2019 I couldn\u2019t even refuse it. I didn\u2019t know how effective it would be, but I decided to use the ability I just got right away.[Using the special ability Cognitive Dissonance.][Cognitive Dissonance is an ability based on the Player\u2019s innate talent.][The ability to perceive reality is being distorted.]The way to use it came to me naturally, like a baby knowing how to breathe without being taught.[Calculating the use/effect/range of Cognitive Dissonance in real time.]I just automatically made a calculation in my head, drawing out the situation I wanted to see. Just like when I designed my future based on what I knew, I did the same now.\u2018I\u2019ll make a distortion so that\u2026 people cannot perceive the sight of me getting the reward.\u2019I made it so that the Players wouldn\u2019t focus on me. It was like looking at trees on the side of the road\u2014unless you concentrated and counted how many trees there were, you wouldn\u2019t remember it and just think, \u201cHuh? How many trees were there? Or wait, were there even trees there?\u201d\u2018This\u2026 is Cognitive Dissonance.\u2019It was a strange feeling, like I was implanting a situation in people\u2019s minds the way I wanted. Though temporary, I used this ability to create the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance.[The duration of Cognitive Dissonance is set to 30 minutes.]It was fascinating.\u2018I\u2019m not drawing any attention.\u2019It was as if people weren\u2019t able to mentally process what they were seeing with their eyes. In the end, the blue dust poured onto my head.[Granting the \u2018Blessing of the Wind Temple\u2019.]It was the thing that had been in the description of the Offering Box.When the Offering Box is full, the Blessing of the Wind Temple will be granted.In the past, no one got the Blessing because all of the pillars were destroyed. It was different this time.[5,000 Coins acquired.]Another pillar became dust and showered down on me.[5,000 Coins acquired.]I got 5,000 Coins each from five pillars. This was literally \u2018winner takes all\u2019. The other Players didn\u2019t get a single scrap of rewards, but I\u2019d already gotten 25,000 Coins.\u2018The last one.\u2019If I got another 5,000 Coins from the last pillar, that would make 30,000 Coins total, which would mean I broke even. The 6th pillar disappeared, becoming glowing blue dust and falling down on me.[5,000 Coins acquired.]From this part alone, I got 30k Coins. However, it didn\u2019t even end there.[Granting the \u2018Blessing of the Wind Temple\u2019.][Confirming that you have 6 Blessings.][The Hidden Piece \u20186 Blessings\u2019 has been fulfilled.]Six Blessings. If at least six pillars were left intact, this Hidden Piece would be fulfilled.\u2018So there was something like this\u2026!\u2019What Sunghyun said in the past about how \u2018it would have been perfect if only about twelve pillars were destroyed\u2019 was actually turning into reality. In any case, this was great. The more rewards there were, the better.[30 minutes left in the duration of Cognitive Dissonance.][Dramatically increases your wind-attribute affinity.]In addition, I got an item.\u2018What?\u2019This\u2026 could be gotten here?Venti Body TomeIt was an item, a magic tome, that was discovered less than ten times over ten years. It was the wind version of the \u2018Vulcan Body Tome\u2019 that Choi Sung-gu currently had.\u2018There should only be about five wind element classes\u2026\u2019But this tome had already shown up.\u2018The Vulcan Body Tome is already out, and there\u2019s no law that says the Venti Body Tome shouldn\u2019t come out, too, but\u2026\u2019This was an item that enormously amplified the abilities and talent of a \u2018wind element class\u2019, a special artifact that would turn an ordinary guy into a talent, and a talent into a genius.\u2018If someone who was already specialized in the wind element were to use this\u2026 someone like Jo Sunghyun\u2026\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2018If someone who was already specialized in the wind element were to use this\u2026 someone like Jo Sunghyun\u2026\u2019That effect would be indescribable, like making a genius to trump all geniuses. Just as I was thinking that, I saw something. Something was sticking out of Sunghyun\u2019s back.\u201cYou\u2026 what\u2019s that?\u201dWhen I looked closer, I realized what \u2018that\u2019 was.\u2018A candle.\u2019Specifically\u2014\u2018A Bluelight Candle.\u2019It was called a \u2018Bluelight Candle\u2019. Like the name suggested, the candle was burning with a blue flame.\u2018When the light is extinguished, a new field will be opened.\u2019This class of items was called \u2018random artifacts\u2019 because you never knew when or where they would appear. One kind of random artifact, candles, had two different types\u2014Redlight Candles, and Bluelight Candles.Yeonseo also went up to Sunghyun, saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s with this candle-like thing on your back? It\u2019s blue.\u201dNext to her, Sunhwa also stared at the light with fascination. \u201cAmazing. The candle is attached to your back. Do you think it would go out if I blew on it? I wanna try.\u201dThe way her eyes sparkled was really cute. It struck me a lot these days, but I was truly glad she became my sister. Her cuteness blessed me every day.\u201cYou can\u2019t blow it out.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dDespite being at a rebellious age, she was very obedient.Turning to me, Sunghyun asked, \u201cDo you\u2026 happen to know what this is?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201dI pretended to just be observing.\u2018If it\u2019s blown out too quickly, the difficulty will be too high.\u2019By the same token, if the flame went out completely because it was blown out too late, the candle would disappear. We had to blow it out before the wick completely burned up.\u201cDayum, this is one fascinating flame. I\u2019m amazing when it comes to fire, you know.\u201dThanks to the Vulcan Body Tome, Choi Sung-gu\u2019s dormant potential for the fire element was second to none. He seemed to find the \u2018candlelight\u2019 very fascinating.\u201cI think something new will happen if this is blown out?\u201dHe was pretty much right on the money.\u201cBut I get the feeling that it shouldn\u2019t be blown out too quickly.\u201dFrom the way he guessed it with one glance, a genius was indeed a genius. Sung-gu\u2019s gaze turned to me.\u201cWhat\u2019ll we do?\u201d* * *\u201cWhat\u2019ll we do?\u201dWith that one question, Jo Sunghyun became absolutely sure of something. The true leader of this group was Kim Hyukjin. He was a little confused. Honestly, he hadn\u2019t thought there would be someone who would be above the Tutorial Ender. He had also seen Shin Yeonseo\u2019s movements earlier, and they were simply incredible.\u2018If I were to face her\u2026\u2019He would lose, no doubt about it. She was amazing, as was Kim Sunhwa, who had a ridiculous tanking ability. And of course, there was Choi Sung-gu, whose fire magic was obviously the most outstanding out of all the magicians here. But all of them were waiting for Hyukjin\u2019s words and judgment, like it was natural.\u2018That must mean that Hyukjin hyung is just that amazing.\u2019It was so very natural, the way Sung-gu asked for Hyukjin\u2019s opinion. When he saw it, Sunghyun felt a feeling akin to longing surge up within him.\u2018I want to learn.\u2019* * *Unbeknownst to him, his feelings and gaze had already been picked up by my Eye of Perception.State: Slight Longing / Trust / FaithI had achieved my goal in coming here\u2014acquiring Jo Sunghyun\u2019s trust.\u2018The candle\u2026 offers greater reward than risk.\u2019It was even a Bluelight Candle. There was a high chance for a bigger reward.\u2018Also, whoever blows out the Bluelight Candle can pick the Players who will participate.\u2019It was decided. If it was low risk, high return, giving it a go was the only answer, at least in my opinion.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is watching you.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is waiting for your choice.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 is impatient.][The \u2018Barrier of Blue Light\u2019 regards your prudence in high esteem.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is bored.]I waited a little longer.\u2018I have to get the timing right.\u2019I had to wait for the point where the wick was almost completely burned out. 0.5 seconds could very well make a huge difference in the difficulty. It was random.\u2018Now\u2026!\u2019I blew on the \u2018Bluelight Candle\u2019.Hoo\u2013!The moment I blew, the light went out, and a notice immediately rang out.[The \u2018Bluelight Candle\u2019 has gone out.][Perfect timing!][The timing could not be any better.]I got the feeling I heard fanfare.[The perfect timing greatly decreases the difficulty.][The perfect timing greatly increases the rewards.]I also heard the party selection notice.[Select the Players who will proceed. Maximum raid participants: 6]I picked right away. Jo Sunghyun, Choi Sung-gu, So Yoohyun, Kim Sunhwa, Shin Yeonseo, and finally, Kim Hyukjin.\u2018Was\u2026 this made for me? Or is it because my timing was so spot on?\u2019I couldn\u2019t be sure, but how was it possible that even the max party limit was perfect for us? In any case, it was a good thing. The wind, a refreshing breeze, began to blow again.It blew gently in whimsical directions. At the same time, the stream of notices continued.[Leaving the Flash Gate \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019 and entering the Flash Gate \u2018Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2019.]Our surroundings were quiet. A gloomy fog had settled over the dark scenery, giving off the feeling of a poorly maintained cemetery or an abandoned field. Occasionally, there was the raucous cawing of a crow.\u201cEugh, fuck. I\u2019m scared.\u201d Sung-gu grabbed my right arm.\u201cHy-Hyungnim. I don\u2019t like this,\u201d said Soohyun, clutching my left arm. Then, he shivered all over, squealing, \u201cA-Ahhh! It-It\u2019s a mouse! A mouse! I hate mice!\u201d He was half clinging to me, and trust me, I was over it.\u201cIf the two of you don\u2019t get off right now, I\u2019ll kill you right here and now.\u201dIt might be different if it were Yeonseo or Sunhwa, but what were these guys who were bigger than me doing?\u2018Well, it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re actually terrified.\u2019Sung-gu\u2019s state was:State: Fascination / Slight Fear / BravadoAnd Yoohyun\u2019s was:State: Slightly Scared / Determination / A Little AfraidSince fascination and determination were there, they would do just fine if we had to keep Playing. Just then, I picked up something with Eye of Perception.\u201cOn your toes, everyone.\u201dIt was a Bluelight Candle, and I extinguished it at the perfect timing. The difficulty shouldn\u2019t be terribly high, but we couldn\u2019t be careless.The ground shook. A slight distance away, a tomb began to emerge from the ground. From it, I felt something familiar.\u2018This feeling is\u2026\u2019It felt like something I\u2019d already experienced before, a monster that I had already fought before.\u2018Great Orc Warrior?\u2019A Great Orc Warrior was getting to its feet. Next to it, other tombs were coming up as well, but\u2026\u2018They\u2019re just for show.\u2019Nothing would come out of them. The difficulty was greatly reduced. If my guess was right, it should have originally been a Great Orc Warrior plus an Orc Archer and maybe one or two regular Orcs to support the Orc Archer. Weirdly enough, I just knew that.\u2018I can see it.\u2019Even without seeing it happen, I could envision what this place\u2019s difficulty should have originally been, and how it would have progressed.\u2018Two Orc Archers. One regular Orc. And a Great Orc Warrior.\u2019That\u2019s what we would have been up against, and if that had really happened, it might have been a little tough for us at our current level\u2026 but not impossible. If we had moved well as an organic team, that was a challenge we could have definitely managed, though it would have been quite tricky if there were three or four Orcs guarding the Orc Archers.Yeonseo pulled out her sword.\u201cI get what this is about.\u201dYeonseo seemed to have sensed it, too. She knew that we had to fight the Great Orc Warrior, a monster we had fought in the past.\u201cHyukjin, you still have one of the steel stakes we used last time, right?\u201dHow admirable. She remembered the strategy.\u201cYeah, I do.\u201dJust then, I heard a notice.[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 offers a new quest.][The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 shares the details of the new quest.][In accordance with the request of the \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019, a \u2018Pause\u2019 takes effect.]The Herdsman of Las Vegas, who relished gambling, offered me a quest. A note was in my Inventory.Can activate the quest \u2018Secret Within the Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2019. If you accept the quest, the difficulty will be adjusted to the original difficulty of the \u2018Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2019, and an additional five \u2018Orcs\u2019 will be spawned.Upon quest clear, you will receive 100,000 Coins.Upon quest clear, you will receive \u2018Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Gloves\u2019.Upon quest clear, you will receive \u2018U-Plex Dungeon First Entry Rights\u2019.Upon quest failure, all party members will die.100,000 Coins was a given, but what really caught my eye was the U-Plex Dungeon First Entry Rights. It had to refer to the U-Plex next to the Hyundai Department Store in Sinchon, the Seoul district Sunhwa and I went around last time. I would obtain the right to enter that dungeon even though it wasn\u2019t even formally open yet.\u2018Does that mean it\u2019ll open to us, first?\u2019It was never revealed in the past how that dungeon opened up.\u2018That\u2019s somewhere I absolutely have to go.\u2019Plus, I would get Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Gloves. For a wearer of the partial set like myself, it was truly a tantalizing offer. This fellow, the Herdsman of Las Vegas, didn\u2019t put up a bad offer.Yoohyun asked, \u201cHyungnim, what should we do about this?\u201dThe fact that we could all talk to each other in the Paused field meant that my party members also got the same proposal.It wouldn\u2019t just be an additional two Orcs, but\u00a0five.\u00a0And they wouldn\u2019t be regular Orcs, but ones that would be closely guarding the two Orc Archers.\u2018Clearing that difficulty the way we are right now is impossible.\u2019The one who made this proposal was none other than the Herdsman of Las Vegas.\u2018The Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019s proposal is pretty much a gamble.\u2019It was a dangerous but simultaneously attractive gamble. The Gold Pyramid Michelle successfully won all her gambles with the Herdsman of Las Vegas and once stood at the peak of the sovereign-class Players. Which meant\u2026 if I could win this Guardian\u2019s bets, that was also possible for me.\u2018But it bothers me that all party members would die if we fail the quest\u2026\u2019This time, Yeonseo spoke up. \u201cBoss. I think it would be good to accept this offer.\u201d\u201cHow come?\u201d\u201cBecause I think we can definitely clear it?\u201dBut what in the world was her summary all about?Summary: Swordsman Putting Faith in Their WifeThe strange summary aside, I had to make a decision as their leader. To be honest, I was thinking along the same lines as Yeonseo. A slight risk for a huge reward.\u2018I\u2019ll\u2026 take a closer look.\u2019Since we were in a Pause anyway, I examined the field again and again with Observer\u2019s Eye. This was a matter where our lives were on the line. If my observations and intuition were wrong, then everyone would be in danger. If it was going to be too dangerous, staying out of it was the right thing to do. Because if we died, everything would be over.\u2018Originally, clearing would be impossible.\u2019But for some reason, there was confidence bubbling within me, confidence that we could do this.[3 minutes remaining until the Pause is deactivated.]I had to make a decision.\u201cSunghyun.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dThis kid was the still-unripe Incarnation of Hammurabi. He would repay a favor with a favor twice over, and a grudge with a grudge ten times over. That was the Typhoon\u2019s ironclad rule.\u201cI\u2019ll let you hold onto this.\u201dWe couldn\u2019t accept the Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 offer at our current level. It would be too dangerous if we did that.\u2018But if we did it with a Venti Body Tomed Sunghyun\u2026\u2019It was more than doable. Not only would we be able to get out of here alive, but we would also be able to gain a hefty reward.\u201c...Huh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not giving it to you. I\u2019m letting you borrow it.\u201dI handed over the Venti Body Tome.\u201cTh-This is\u2026\u201dSunghyun wouldn\u2019t realize the exact value of this item. However, he should be able to tell that it was incredibly good, and he\u2019d realize that even more after he experienced its effects.\u201cRepay a favor with a favor. I\u2019m giving this to you because I think this item is better suited to you than to me.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cSo that we can survive this.\u201d\u201c...I understand.\u201dSunghyun didn\u2019t refuse as vehemently as Sung-gu. It wasn\u2019t that hard to get him to accept.Summary: Incarnation of Hammurabi Resolved to Repay a Favor\u201cUse it right away. It\u2019ll likely cause a big change in your body. It was the same for Sung-gu.\u201d\u201c...\u201dIf a genius of the wind element was boosted by the \u2018Venti Body Tome\u2019, they\u2019d become a genius exceeding geniuses.\u201c...I\u2019m not sure this is okay.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can just repay me back twofold.\u201d\u201c...I don\u2019t understand what you see in me to be this generous.\u201d\u201cHm, potential?\u201d\u201c...\u201dIt was obvious to everyone that Sunghyun was deeply moved. In any case, this was good. To clear this place safely, Sunghyun\u2019s \u2018awakening\u2019 was necessary.\u2018The Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2026 balanced the proposal with our strength.\u2019He set the difficulty so that we would barely be able to clear it, making it just hard enough that a mistake would spell our death. I was sure he set it to around that level, and it was exactly the sort of thing the expert gambler the Herdsman of Las Vegas would do.\u2018But he didn\u2019t know I had the Venti Body Tome.\u2019 I hadn\u2019t publicized it. \u2018If we have Sunghyun with the effects of the Venti Body Tome applied\u2026\u2019Then the balance the Herdsman of Las Vegas envisioned would completely fall apart. The scales of the gamble would tip our way.\u201cThank you. I will do my best to live up to your expectations.\u201dSunghyun\u2019s words were full of sincerity.\u2018That\u2019s right, repay this favor twofold,\u2019 I thought with satisfaction. \u2018Because although I\u2019m not doing this just for you or investing only in you, a favor\u2019s a favor.\u2019\u201cI will use it right now.\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201dSunghyun used the \u2018Venti Body Tome\u2019. A strong wind enveloped Sunghyun and whirled around with him in the center. The tempestuously raging wind was absorbed by his body. That alone changed his aura. The process took about one minute.\u2018We\u2019re ready.\u2019There was about one minute before the Pause ended. The preparations were finished.\u2018So there\u2019s only one thing left to do.\u2019\u201cSenia,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to convey a proposal to the Herdsman of Las Vegas.\u201dLike they said, strike while the iron was hot. After hearing what I said, Senia, who had been streaming us in her transparent state, urgently sent me a whisper request.\u2013Player Kim Hyukjin. Are you out of your mind?Don\u2019t worry, Senia. My mind is perfectly sound, and I\u2019m confident I can create a far more favorable picture and situation.\u2013Did you forget what I said before?\u2013What are you talking about?The Herdsman of Las Vegas opened the doors to this stage. That was it\u2014he only opened the doors.From here on out, I would be the one to set the stage.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: Tomb of the Wind Warrior (2)In the past, when the Herdsman of Las Vegas proposed a gamble with me, I refused. Back then, I said this:\u2013I want to be the one who orchestrates the probability and makes a situation where I can win. Only idiots would let themselves be blinded by the tantalizing reward and bet without any information.\u2013That\u2019s why I refused. A gamble entrusted to luck alone is no different from throwing the game.That was the answer I came up with after using all of the knowledge at my disposal and thoroughly analyzing the disposition of the Guardian that made the proposal.Naturally, it was well received. The Herdsman of Las Vegas sent me signals that he respected my thoughts and was satisfied with them.There was also a notice like this:[A great number of anonymous Guardians ridicule you.]Many of the same Guardians were probably watching me through Senia right now. Back then, they must have ridiculed me a great deal.\u201cI want to make a counter proposal. A kind of bet. I\u2019d like you to convey my intent to the Herdsman of Las Vegas.\u201dTo that, Senia responded like this:\u2013Player Kim Hyukjin. Are you out of your mind?Of course, my mind was perfectly sound.\u2013Did you forget what I said before?\u2013What are you talking about?\u2013I don\u2019t do luck-based gambles. I will orchestrate the chances and set the board.\u2013But even so, what qualifies you to make a counter proposal to a Guardian?\u2013Why not? Is there any law saying I can\u2019t? Is that forbidden in the Commandments?Senia was speechless. It was natural, since there was no notion of this in Senia\u2019s mind. It was because I knew that the peak of sovereign classes, the Gold Pyramid Michelle, had made bets and counter proposals with the Herdsman of Las Vegas for many years that I could brazenly offer a counter proposal.\u2018The Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2026 actually likes these kinds of counter proposals and bets more.\u2019It was different for every Guardian. You couldn\u2019t make a counter proposal to a Guardian who was arrogant and looked down on Players as trash\u2014they might label you as impudent.\u2018But not the Herdsman of Las Vegas.\u2019Senia\u2019s worries were indeed unfounded.\u2018See? I said you didn\u2019t need to worry, Miss Beginner Streamer. Matching your response to the other party\u2019s disposition is Playing 101.\u2019[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 is interested in your counter proposal.]Senia\u2019s wingtips trembled. She was wearing a mask of expressionlessness, but I could see traces of shock, and she was saying something I couldn\u2019t hear. She was probably explaining something to the Guardians.[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 wants to hear the details of your counter proposal.]As expected of the famous Gold Pyramid\u2019s Guardian, he very generously used another Pause, even though it was said to be an extremely expensive authority.[The Pause has been prolonged.][2 minutes have been added to the Pause.]With that, I had a total of three minutes. I got a whisper from Senia.\u2013Do not underestimate the Guardians.I knew that. If he didn\u2019t like my proposal, I would be greatly penalized for the offensive crime of deceiving the Herdsman of Las Vegas.\u2018I know that, too.\u2019There was no such thing as perfect. I was expanding and manipulating this board, but I couldn\u2019t control everything and have things go exactly as I wanted. I wasn\u2019t a god.\u2018But the return is far greater than the risk.\u2019This sort of thing was called an investment. When the rewards I could expect were far greater than the risks I had to undertake, it was my belief that I should boldly advance. Because I resolved myself to live differently from the past. Because I decided to be the one to make my own path.[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 is waiting.]I began to speak. \u201cAccording to what I have determined with my humble abilities, I believe that in this place, the Tomb of the Wind Warrior, a Great Orc Warrior, two Orc Archers, and one Orc will appear.\u201dI didn\u2019t see it with my eyes, but my guess was likely spot-on. If we accepted the \u2018Secret Within the Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2019, an additional five Orcs would spawn, which would make a total of six regular Orcs.\u201cThe Herdsman of Las Vegas has not concretely stated the terms of the new quest.\u201dSometimes, there were quests like this, insidious ones where the end goal was left up to interpretation. Such quests were undesirable. Quests with concrete tasks, like \u2018Hunt the Great Orc Warrior!\u2019 or \u2018Destroy the Clear Crystal!\u2019 were good quests.\u2018The Herdsman of Las Vegas tested me with this proposal.\u2019He wanted to see if I was truly a Player worth his attention. There was no doubt that he had been curious to see if I was a Player he should sponsor.\u201cAs such, I would like to ask that the quest terms be concretely stated, and at the same time\u2026\u201dWith this, I should have secured an easy pass for the Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019s test. Considering his disposition, this answer should score a hundred points in his book.\u201cI would like to propose those concrete terms as a counter proposal.\u201dSenia\u2019s wings continued to tremble. Her impudent(?) Player dared to make bets and counter proposals with a Guardian, so she, a powerless beginner Streamer, was unsurprisingly nervous. She seemed way more nervous than me, the person involved. She really had to grow a spine.\u201cI will make an offering using proof that we have hunted the Great Orc Warrior.\u201dJo Sunghyun did his best to not miss a single word Hyukjin said.\u2018He\u2019s making a deal not just on the level of Intermediate Administrators, but\u2026 on the Guardian level.\u2019It was a Playing method he\u2019d never even considered.\u2018Today\u2026 I\u2019m really learning a lot.\u2019It felt like a new world opened up to him, like he received enlightenment. Not only that, but even his body changed. His affinity with the wind attribute dramatically increased, and he felt abundant mana, as well as the confidence to be able to achieve all things related to the wind.\u2018This is the Venti Body Tome.\u2019The person who gave him such an incredible item was Kim Hyukjin. Just who was this person? He became curious, and beyond that, he was awed.\u2018In the end, he successfully made the deal.\u2019Sunghyun didn\u2019t quite get it.\u2018Proof that we have hunted the Great Orc Warrior.\u2019Just what could that be? Did something drop if you hunted a Great Orc Warrior? Did they just have to offer that? Like how they put Coins into the Offering Box?\u2018No idea.\u2019He didn\u2019t get it, but the quest was about to begin. Hyukjin turned to his party members.\u201cThe quest is starting.\u201dThey heard a notice.[The quest \u2018Secret Within the Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2019 has been activated.]Thanks to Hyukjin\u2019s efforts, they could now read the quest details.[Secret Within the Tomb of the Wind Warrior]A Great Orc Warrior has been set as the guardian monster protecting the \u2018Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2019. In order to find out the secret within the tomb, acquire the \u2018token\u2019 that proves you have hunted the \u2018Great Orc Warrior\u2019.An additional five Orcs will be spawnedUpon quest failure, all party members will die.The Paused field returned to life and began to move again. Tombs began to surge up, and the monsters began to appear.Shin Yeonseo was a bundle of nerves.\u2018Just what the heck is this boss guy thinking?\u2019Rather than a regular hunt, they had to offer the proof of the hunt. If they failed, all of them would die.\u2018What\u2019re we gonna do if nothing drops?\u2019They needed a \u2018token\u2019 proving that they hunted the Great Orc Warrior. She had no idea what that could be, but what if it didn\u2019t drop? Even if they barely managed to hunt the Great Orc Warrior, if that didn\u2019t show up, then they would fail the quest, right?\u2018Ah, fudge.\u2019Whatever. Yeonseo still trusted Hyukjin. Now wasn\u2019t the time to be quibbling over what was right or wrong. They had to join forces to clear this quest.\u201cBoss guy. Should I harass the monsters while Sunhwa pulls the aggro like last time?\u201d\u201c...\u201dHowever, Hyukjin did not respond.\u201cBoss?\u201d\u201c...\u201dIn the meantime, the Great Orc Warrior emerged completely, along with the Orc Archers and regular Orcs. The pressure they put out was incredibly intense.Sunhwa swallowed nervously as well. She had seen them before, but she still found monsters scary. They were all gross and too large.\u2018Do I just need to pull the aggro like last time?\u2019Her target would be the Orc Archers. She just needed to block their attacks.\u2018If I hunt the regular Orcs and buy time with Sung-gu mister, Sunghyun oppa, and Yoohyun mister\u2026\u2019Then Yeonseo unnie and Hyukjin oppa would be able to hunt the Great Orc Warrior together in the meantime. Hyukjin didn\u2019t tell her what to do, but she was able to come up with a plan.\u2018But\u2026\u2019To Sunhwa, it looked a little dicey. It wouldn\u2019t be easy. She judged that hunting that many monsters with a Great Orc Warrior of all things thrown into the mix with their current party and abilities\u2026 would be very difficult.\u2018What in the world could oppa be thinking?\u2019* * *I waited a little longer, until the Great Orc Warrior and the Orcs fully discovered our presence and were directing hostility towards us.\u2018By now, there should be plenty of attention on us.\u2019Countless Guardians had to be curious as to how we would clear this difficult quest. That was enough.\u201cSenia. Here.\u201dGetting down to one knee, I held out an item to Senia with two hands. My posture was reverent, as if I were offering something.I already had proof that we hunted the Great Orc Warrior.[Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Molar]A long molar of the Great Orc Warrior. It is imbued with the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s strength. If processed in a special way and ingested, you will be able to acquire a special power.Senia took the item with a sour expression. She might look expressionless to others, but I could see she was wearing a bitter expression. It was written pretty clearly over her face.\u201cWhat? Is there any problem?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 no.\u201dI tsked inwardly. Other people aside, Senia should already know I had acquired the \u2018Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Molar\u2019.\u2018When I got the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Molar, the Herdsman of Las Vegas wasn\u2019t watching me yet.\u2019To be more precise, it was after we killed the Great Orc Warrior and got all the rewards that the \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 started to watch me. The timing simply aligned like that, and that was why I made a bet like this.[The quest clear condition has been satisfied.][A portion of the \u2018Secret Within the Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2019 has been cleared.][The approval of the \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 is necessary for the complete clear of the \u2018Secret Within the Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2019.]Looked like that would take some time.[The System has forcefully applied a Pause.]The monsters stopped in place. My party members stared at me in total shock. They must have been racking their brains to figure out what to do, but the quest was partially cleared out of nowhere.[The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is delighted.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 is greatly disappointed.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 continues to observe.]This time, I was the one to send Senia a whisper request.\u2013What are you doing?\u2013What do you mean?\u2013I\u2019ve set the stage. I pulled a fast one on the Herdsman of Las Vegas just now, and a lot of Guardians must be watching.The Herdsman of Las Vegas wouldn\u2019t be displeased. I was sure of it. He would definitely just think that my hand of cards was better than his. That was confirmed by the notice I heard next.[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 is impressed by your hand.][The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 is debating whether he should acknowledge the complete clear.]\u2018I know the Herdsman of Las Vegas is satisfied with my clear,\u2019 I thought. \u2018He acknowledged that I had a good hand.\u2019So the reason why he was debating acknowledging the complete clear was solely because of the other Guardians. That was why I whispered Senia.\u2013Aren\u2019t the other Guardians kicking up a fuss, saying this isn\u2019t a proper clear?Guardians like the Courageous Lion King would be particularly outraged. Even I had to admit that my Play just now was a little sneaky.This kind of Playing was polarizing. Guardians with dispositions like the Herdsman of Las Vegas would definitely be okay with it, but there were bound to be quite a lot of Guardians who wouldn\u2019t like it.\u2013That\u2019s why you need to step up and take an active role. You\u2019re an Intermediate Administrator.Obeying the rules of the System, while saving the Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019s face and simultaneously pushing for content that would satisfy the Guardians, wasn\u2019t that what an Intermediate Administrator, a Streamer, should do? They were producers of content that could satisfy a great number of Guardians.\u2013You should either give me a new quest\u2026 or round up the suckers.In other words, what Senia needed to do right now was guide the situation so that another Guardian would issue a new quest in a way that didn\u2019t violate the rules of the System, thus satisfying the countless Guardians who wanted to see us hunt that horde of Orcs.\u2018One of these amusement-addicted Guardians will issue a quest for us to hunt those Orcs. Definitely.\u2019But they couldn\u2019t just issue it outright. I had already satisfied the clear condition. As far as the System was concerned, the quest could be cleared with one word from the Herdsman of Las Vegas. So if the Guardians wanted to dismiss that clear and make us clear it again, they would need to offer something more.\u2018An extra reward\u2026 should be attached.\u2019In cases like this, where the quest had to be cleared a second time, it was typical to offer a bigger reward. Of course, the Player would be able to choose whether they accepted or not.\u2013We will hunt the Orcs.That was my plan from the beginning. I was just trying to maximize the rewards right now, but I always intended on taking on the original gamble. For a moment, Senia was speechless, perhaps out of shock. I grinned.\u2013Do you really intend on hunting them? That horde of Orcs?Her wings quivered.\u2013I told you, didn\u2019t I? I will set the stage.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: Tomb of the Wind Warrior (3)Senia herself admitted that she didn\u2019t have much of a \u2018gift of gab\u2019. She had little confidence when it came to expressing herself with words, and consequently, she tended not to say much when streaming Players.Among the Guardians, as well as the other Intermediate Administrators, she was starting to be called the \u2018Intermediate Administrator of Silence\u2019.\u2018I am well aware that it isn\u2019t really a good moniker.\u2019Intermediate Administrator of Silence sounded good enough, but frankly put, it was \u2018Streamer who can\u2019t talk\u2019. In any case, Senia knew that very well, so she chose the strategy of simply being tight-lipped. She could afford to do so because she had such good quality content, Kim Hyukjin.\u2018But\u2026\u2019This time, she could not be taciturn. She heard Hyukjin\u2019s words.\u2013I told you, didn\u2019t I? I will set the stage.He was a Player far weaker than herself. But despite that, he was forging ahead with such a Play.\u2018Player Kim Hyukjin. You are right.\u2019From his actions, his confidence, and his words, she realized something. She herself grasped what she had to do right now, and how she should do it.And so, she opened her mouth.\u2013The clear condition has been satisfied. However, I believe this may not be a very gratifying clear for many of you. That is also the reason why the Herdsman of Las Vegas is debating whether he should acknowledge the clear.Even as she spoke, Senia surprised herself. It felt like the longest string of words she spoke in her entire streaming career. And she had the feeling that she could actually speak quite well; it was just that she hadn\u2019t practiced it much.\u2013...So if there is anyone who would bestow a new quest given within the prescribed rules, I would be grateful for your participation.The quest was already cleared. To coerce another clear, a force of equal value would be necessary. In other words, a reward.A little time passed. Hyukjin and his party members heard new notices.[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 and \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 make a proposal to the Players.][Hunt all the Orc species monsters.][The Players can refuse the Guardians\u2019 proposal.]Senia\u2019s wings trembled. It felt like she realized something huge today.\u2018Ah\u2014!\u2019So this was how you were supposed to do it. You could get Coins like this, too. This was precisely that sponsorship inducement she\u2019d heard all about.[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 and \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 have donated 50,000 Coins each.]They didn\u2019t donate those Coins to the Players. They donated them to her, the Intermediate Administrator, so she could issue a new quest. She, too, would need a small reward for acting as the intermediary. She got a whopping 50k from each of the \u2018suckers\u2019, as Kim Hyukjin put it. A total of 100k Coins.\u2018With this\u2014!\u2019She could afford to feed and support her young siblings, who only had her to rely on after their parents passed away. With this, she could give her siblings good clothes and good food.\u2018This is how you do it.\u2019Goosebumps rose along her arms. She had the feeling that Hyukjin taught her something big today. Her reaction was not visible to the eye.\u2013Thank you for the sponsorships. Player Kim Hyukjin\u2019s party will soon proceed with the Tomb of the Wind Warrior raid.And then, her gaze moved to Hyukjin. The Pause would end soon, and the Orcs would appear.\u2018The cards are stacked against them.\u2019He gave something to Jo Sunghyun, and after receiving it, there was certainly a change in the young wind magician. However, the difficulty was too high for that to make a difference. It wasn\u2019t just three or four Orcs, but a staggering six.\u2018Orc Archers, regular Orcs. And a Great Orc Warrior. It won\u2019t be easy.\u2019But Hyukjin looked confident. Because she was talking to the Guardians, she wasn\u2019t able to fully relay what Hyukjin and the other Players were saying. To be more precise, she intentionally didn\u2019t stream it. This, too, was a type of directing technique.\u2018If it\u2019s Player Kim Hyukjin, he will have come up with some kind of method.\u2019It was a lie to say this wouldn\u2019t be dangerous. It definitely was. But even so, Hyukjin pushed ahead, which meant he had some kind of trick up his sleeve. He must have shared that plan with the other Players.\u2018I didn\u2019t\u2026 share the method with the Guardians.\u2019By this point, Senia was curious, too. Just how would Kim Hyukjin hunt that big horde of Orcs?\u2018How will you do this?\u2019* * *Yoohyun understood exactly what he had to do.\u201cGot it, hyungnim. I\u2019ll move exactly like you instructed!\u201dYoohyun and Sung-gu fist bumped.\u201cAhh! You muscleman, why\u2019s your fist so hard?\u201d\u201cHuhuhuhu. You\u2019re just weak, Sung-gu. You weakling.\u201d\u201cHa. You watch your back, I swear. And watch out for fire. Seriously, if it weren\u2019t for Hyukjin, I wouldn\u2019t bother playing with you.\u201dDespite the barbed words, the two of them often met up to go to caf\u00e9s and had run several raids together. They were just loosening their nerves and working up their fighting spirit with a very short conversation. Yeonseo went up to Sung-gu, saying, \u201cWhy\u2019re you guys quarreling when you can\u2019t even fight?\u201dYeonseo, Sung-gu, and Yoohyun made one team.Sunhwa walked in front of Sunghyun, almost like she was protecting him.\u201cYou\u2019re with me, right, oppa?\u201d\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s do our best.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be the core of this battle, oppa.\u201d Sunhwa flashed him a smile. She was standing in front of Sunghyun with her tiny body. \u201cI\u2019ll protect you no problem, so please do your best with what my oppa asked you to do!\u201dThe nuance behind \u2018my oppa\u2019 and \u2018oppa\u2019 felt very different when she said them. Of course, \u2018my oppa\u2019 referred to me, and just \u2018oppa\u2019 was Sunghyun. From the nuance to her attitude, her treatment of the two was very different.\u201cAl-Alright.\u201dSunhwa and Sunghyun made another team. I grinned.\u2018They\u2019ve taken up good positions.\u2019We didn\u2019t have much time. I knew that Senia deliberately didn\u2019t stream them while they were preparing, and other Streamers weren\u2019t contracted with me.\u2018It\u2019s just a guess, but I bet our words were turned into static.\u2019It was probably something like that.\u2018Senia, I\u2019ll raise your value.\u2019I heard a notice.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 continues to observe.]With this, I was sure of it. The Nameless Observer didn\u2019t actively encourage me to stand on the frontlines, but they also didn\u2019t dislike me going forward and leading. They simply maintained the position of a \u2018neutral observer\u2019. Like their name suggested, they were truly just \u2018observing\u2019. The Nameless Observer was a fairly magnanimous Guardian who didn\u2019t forcefully push \u2018observation\u2019 as the Playing method.I suddenly realized something.\u2018I was given Onlooker at first, right?\u2019Observer felt more active than Onlooker.\u2018If I can upgrade the class through the 2nd advancement\u2026\u2019If the next class followed the same trend, there was a high chance I might get a class that would encourage slightly more active Play.\u2018A class more active than Observer\u2026\u2019I had an idea of what that would look like. It would be a class that obtained information through observation and then used that information and knowledge to garner the greatest profit possible. It might end up feeling similar to a \u2018sovereign\u2019 class.\u2018It\u2019s not set in stone yet.\u2019I decided to focus on the battle for now. I could feel the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s intense energy.\u2018It\u2019s okay.\u2019I wasn\u2019t worried. I had faced him once before. That fear of the \u2018unknown\u2019 one felt when facing a completely new opponent had disappeared long ago.* * *All of the monsters finished appearing.[The Great Orc Warrior is starting to roar.]At the same time:[The morale of the Orcs increases.][The Orcs are becoming violent.]The Orcs spotted us, [!!!] marks appearing over their heads.\u201cYour opponent is here, you pieces of scum!\u201dYoohyun smashed the ground with a thud, giving off the energy of a massive bull. Yeonseo flew past him.[Using the movement skill Heavenly Demonic Flying Step.]It was so she could get between the Orcs and disrupt their movements. Trusting them, Choi Sung-gu began to chant an incantation.[Speller Kartina Neu-Armi]A hard-to-understand special magic incantation flowed from his lips. There were a whopping six regular Orcs. Yeonseo was messing up their advance and movements while Yoohyun was aggroing them. However, it was impossible for him to pull all of the violent Orcs.Hyukjin moved to the Orcs with a speed that was neither fast nor slow and used a skill.[Using the special skill Mettle.][Mettle]\u2018Mettle\u2019 is the aura of a ruler and the higher form of \u2018Pressure\u2019. It induces instinctive fear and awe in those who are of a lower level than the user.Hyukjin\u2019s level was 30, and the Orcs\u2019 was around level 27.[Using the special skill Mettle.][Using the special skill Mettle.]Yoohyun and Yeonseo also used Mettle at the same time. They had gained the ability with Hyukjin, and their combined Mettle squashed the Orcs.A smile floated to Yeonseo\u2019s lips. The Orcs\u2019 movements definitely dulled, and their reaction speed was also greatly slowed. Mettle had the ability to overwhelm multiple lower level creatures.\u2018With this\u2026 we should be able to hunt them.\u2019She wasn\u2019t the Shin Yeonseo of the past. Yoohyun and Sung-gu were the same. They had been able to hunt Orcs even when their levels were low, but now, they were five levels higher than the Orcs. There might be a lot of Orcs, but they were up against three Players.Yoohyun yelled \u201cOryaaa\u201d as he punched.Squeaaaaaal!He struck one of the Orcs right in the solar plexus.\u2018It\u2019s just as hyungnim said.\u2019The Orc Archers didn\u2019t have a chance to look their way\u2014they were perfectly aggroed by Sunhwa.Fwip fwip!Two arrows were fired in succession. One aimed for Sunhwa\u2019s forehead, and the other her heart. Staring directly at the arrows, Sunhwa said, \u201cOppa,\u201d and used a skill at the same time.[Using the skill Platinum Shield.]To that, the prepared Sunghyun added his magic.[Wendies Napera]Wind began to blow. Earlier, Hyukjin had instructed him to recall the wind that blew in the \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019. He cast his spell while imagining those gusts.[Visualize those gusts in your own way and recreate them. They don\u2019t have to be strong. They just need to slightly change the trajectory of the arrows so that Sunhwa can avoid a direct hit.]When he was listening, he wasn\u2019t sure he could do it. But he\u2019d grasped it right away when he tried. After using the \u2018Venti Body Tome\u2019, he could visualize the wind.\u2018I can do this\u2026!\u2019He became sure he could do it.\u2018It\u2019s like Hyukjin hyung said.\u2019Hyukjin\u2019s suggestion was spot on. Two small arrows appeared.[\u2190\u2190]He produced a wind so feeble it was hardly fair to compare it to the gusts from the \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019.\u2018Wind that can change the trajectory.\u2019He only needed to give them a slight nudge. He also wasn\u2019t casting an AOE spell to cover the entire field, just the two arrows. He focused. Boosted by the \u2018Venti Body Tome\u2019, his body had become incredibly sensitive to \u2018wind\u2019.Clank!As the metallic sound rang out, Sunhwa smiled brightly.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much impact. Oppa, I think you did it.\u201dThey brushed off two arrows with ease. At that moment, Sunghyun felt a pounding that could not be put into words. It wasn\u2019t something he felt from Sunhwa, but a pounding that came from deep within.\u2018What is this feeling?\u2019It felt like he had stepped foot on a completely new world.\u2018My heart\u2026 is pounding.\u2019He simply listened and acted according to Hyukjin\u2019s words. Both Sunhwa and him, as well as the other Players, simply carried out their individual roles in their individual positions. But the picture that had been so hazy earlier was becoming so concrete that it was nearly a reality.\u2018Is this the power of a real leader?\u2019A shiver went down his spine. The mere presence of an outstanding leader was enough to make him feel like each party member could give 120%. There was no doubt. Sunghyun inferred Hyukjin\u2019s ability and class.\u2018Sovereign class.\u2019Not just a regular sovereign-type class, but an excellent one supported by outstanding talent and sense.\u2018But\u2026\u2019Would everything truly happen like Hyukjin said? Would everything continue to go well? It was nearly impossible to hunt the Great Orc Warrior with a head-on attack, and Hyukjin himself had said that. Still, they had made it this far. Sunghyun could only trust and move on.\u2018I will do what I need to do.\u2019And so, the quest created by the joint bets of the Herdsman of Las Vegas, the Whispering Devil, and even the Courageous Lion King began in earnest, right on Hyukjin\u2019s palm.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80: Tomb of the Wind Warrior (4)I stared at the faraway \u2018Great Orc Warrior\u2019 as it tilted its head back in a roar that loudly proclaimed its position as a predator. Its level appeared as a \u2018?\u2019 to me.\u2018It\u2019s around level 40.\u2019Although I couldn\u2019t confirm my guess with my physical eyes, I had a very useful skill called Eye of Perception.[Monster]Name: Great Orc WarriorLevel: 41Race: OrcLevel 41. The one that showed up this time wielded an enormous axe.\u2018That\u2019s good.\u2019It was like Kim Taechun\u2014a monster that smashed its enemies with sheer power and possessed a powerful punch.\u2018The others are doing well.\u2019All that was left was for me to do my part. Now wasn\u2019t the time for me to linger in the back as an \u2018observer\u2019. I had to move as actively as possible and kill the monster.I focused my mind. The opponent was level 41. I was level 30. Actually, it was nearly impossible to solo a monster without a special strategy if you were around 10 levels under it. That was what was widely accepted. The \u2018Great Orc Warrior\u2019 wasn\u2019t even a monster that had a fatal weakness like the Lycanthrope.\u2018Last time, we got help from paralyzation poison.\u2019We had embedded dozens of Mutant Wolf Fangs into the Orc\u2019s body, slowing it down so we could hunt it. However, we didn\u2019t have that this time. Which meant\u2026 I had to go toe to toe with the monster on even footing.\u2018If I mess up and get hit, I could even die.\u2019If I got unlucky, that was possible. But the situation was different from before.\u2018Back then, I didn\u2019t have the Great Orc Warrior set.\u2019It was different now. I had the partial set.Partial Set Effect: Defends against a physical attack the wearer cannot handle, limited to once per day. However, the wearer\u2019s level must not exceed level 30. If their level exceeds 30, a damage reduction effect will be triggered depending on the attack\u2019s power.It didn\u2019t offer perfect defense, but there was definitely a \u2018damage reduction\u2019 effect.\u2018After all, they\u2019re items used throughout the mid-game as well.\u2019I was wearing a whopping three pieces of that set.\u2018I should be able to take at least three hits.\u2019I never thought that I would be able to kill this behemoth without a scratch. My strategy was to sacrifice the flesh to preserve the bone.\u2018As long as my vital points aren\u2019t hit, I won\u2019t die in one hit.\u2019I continued to approach the Great Orc Warrior. The others had fully pulled the aggro of the other Orc, allowing me to draw closer while focusing solely on the Great Orc Warrior.But somehow, my movements felt strangely light. It was hard to describe, but I wasn\u2019t just imagining it. I could feel the Great Orc Warrior getting closer and closer. It stared at me, seemingly recognizing me as \u2018prey\u2019.\u2018This time\u2026 I\u2019ll go for as straight a battle as possible.\u2019Many Guardians were focusing on this battle. I intentionally chose a frontal battle. Our average levels were in the early 30s at best.\u2018I\u2019ve shown a lot of tricks so far.\u2019An orthodox hunt of the Great Orc Warrior was sure to kick the Guardians into a frenzy. It might result in me getting hurt a little, but I felt that it was more than doable.\u2018Here I go.\u2019Squeaaaaaal!Uttering a roar that was more like a scream, the Great Orc Warrior hooked its axe on its shoulder and began to run towards me. It was almost like a massive bison was charging my way.Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!Even as it thudded towards me, I was still reading its movements with Observer\u2019s Eye.[\u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 is observing the target.]An image was drawn out in vivid detail in my head. This situation was similar to when I was attacked by the Magic Troll in the Tutorial Field and overcame the \u2018death sentence\u2019 of Sixth Sense.\u2018The feeling from that time\u2026\u2019At that time, Sixth Sense visualized everything I couldn\u2019t see with my eyes in my head. If things had gone as Sixth Sense showed me, I would have been struck by the Magic Troll\u2019s club and sent flying, my head crushed.Just like that time, the situation was automatically drawn out in my head.\u2018I can see it.\u2019I could see how this level 40 monster would move.\u2018I need to rush in on the left side here.\u2019I saw the path.Like Hyukjin planned, he quickly moved to the left. He instinctively calculated the distance and speed at which the Great Orc Warrior was running and lured the beast into swinging its axe towards him.Whumpf\u2013!The axe split the air. For the slightest moment, the Great Orc Warrior staggered. It had swung the axe so forcefully that it lost its balance for a moment.Taking advantage of that, Hyukjin swung his sword. He had chosen a frontal fight, so some groundwork was necessary.\u2018For now, I should provoke its temper a bit.\u2019Wham!It sounded like he was striking leather with a blunt weapon. Hyukjin\u2019s sword was unable to penetrate the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s side, but he hadn\u2019t intended on doing so from the start. His goal was to agitate it.Squeaaaaaaaaal!It only partially worked. An insignificant fly that was merely prey, merely food flitting around, could not irritate it too much. It roared.\u201cChwiiik! I will\u2026 eat! Eat! I will\u2026 eat!\u201dWhile fighting the Orcs, Yeonseo looked at how Hyukjin was doing. She could afford to look because fighting the Mettle-affected Orcs wasn\u2019t all that hard. She had full confidence in Hyukjin, but her slight worry was unrelated to that.\u2018Huh?\u2019However, she saw something a little\u2026 odd.\u2018Those movements just now\u2026\u2019Hyukjin\u2019s movements felt very familiar to her.\u2018Heavenly Demonic Flying Step?\u2019The way he was moving bore a resemblance to her movement skill, Heavenly Demonic Flying Step. It wasn\u2019t 100% the same, but similar enough that she had to wonder if Hyukjin was perhaps learning Heavenly Demonic Flying Step as well.\u2018No, it\u2019s not Heavenly Demonic Flying Step.\u2019It was strangely different from her skill, almost like he was using a version of the skill with more muscle strength and power. \u2018Heavenly Demonic Flying Step\u2019 was fundamentally called a \u2018movement skill\u2019. It was different from a \u2018foot technique\u2019. The way Yeonseo understood movement skills was that they were abilities that allowed one to move quickly or move in places that only allowed very difficult footing.Yeonseo thrust her sword.\u201cHaah!\u201dShe pierced the Orc precisely in the back of its neck. As she did so, she could feel it.\u2018I feel like that\u2019s how it would look\u2026 if you took Heavenly Demonic Flying Step and turned it into a foot technique.\u2019It occurred to her that if you took Heavenly Demonic Flying Step, a \u2018movement skill\u2019 that focused primarily on movement, and used it like a \u2018foot technique\u2019 that had a focus on combat, you would get something like that.Yeonseo\u2019s interpretation was close to the truth. Hyukjin didn\u2019t realize it himself, but he was instinctively replicating the movements he saw from Yeonseo through Observer\u2019s Eye. No one taught him, and he didn\u2019t even do it intentionally. His body simply moved like that automatically.The Great Orc Warrior screamed.\u201cSQUEAAAAL!\u201dIt tried to somehow remove the \u2018Steel Spike\u2019 lodged in its mouth, but was unable to do so. The piece of steel was completely buried in the roof of its mouth and jaw. The weakness of the Great Orc Warrior, the mouth, was open.The enraged Great Orc Warrior used its innate ability.[The Great Orc Warrior\u2019s innate ability, \u2018Orc Fear\u2019, has been triggered.]The Orc Fear crashed down on Hyukjin.[Mettle resists the Orc Fear.]He couldn\u2019t completely shake off the fear\u2019s influence. He could feel his movements being duller than before.\u2018My shoulder\u2019s gonna get smashed here.\u2019As Hyukjin rushed in, the Great Orc Warrior powerfully swung its axe from top to bottom. Hyukjin clenched his teeth. He had overdone it a little to put the Steel Spike into the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s mouth, predicting that he would take a hit as a result.\u2018I just need to avoid getting hit in the vital spots.\u2019By moving forward, he avoided the axe\u2019s blade, allowing the axe\u2019s \u2018hilt\u2019 to strike his shoulder instead of the \u2018blade\u2019. It was like taking a blow from a club.Bam!A loud impact rang out.[The Great Orc Warrior\u2019s partial set effect is activating.][Reducing damage.]He was wearing the Great Orc Warrior items and neutralized a lot of the damage with the partial set effect, but the impact was still massive.\u201cAgh!\u201dA pained groan spilled from Hyukjin\u2019s mouth. Thanks to the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s partial set effect, his shoulder barely escaped being destroyed.\u2018The attack won\u2019t end with this.\u2019Right now, he was close enough that the monster\u2019s fists could reach him. It would instinctively throw a fist at Hyukjin. Observer\u2019s Eye drew out the situation. The fist would come for his temple.\u2018I can\u2019t dodge.\u2019This was all an investment he made to be able to insert the Steel Spike.\u2018After taking this\u2026 I\u2019ll take one more.\u2019He wasn\u2019t in the position to use Flash Step, nor did he have the time. Like an MMA fighter raising their guard, he brought up his arms to protect his temples, clenching his teeth and preparing for impact.\u2018Wait.\u2019He thought that defense was his only avenue, but he glimpsed another way. In that fleeting moment, a brief moment that flashed past, he made a decision.\u2018Its belly!\u2019Hyukjin kicked the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s belly. It wasn\u2019t in order to do damage to the Great Orc Warrior, but to push himself away.Whumpf\u2013!The Great Orc Warrior\u2019s fist whooshed through the air.\u2018I dodged it.\u2019He felt the fist graze past him, like a massive boulder flew past his nose.\u2018If that had hit me\u2026\u2019Even with his guard up, that fist would have dealt quite a lot of damage. Hyukjin flipped into a backwards roll, hitting the ground. Rolling on the ground looked less than graceful, but it was much better than getting hit by the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s fist.Hyukjin picked up a very strange feeling.\u2018This feeling\u2026 What is it?\u2019Up until the last moment, there was definitely no path. The only choice was to block. But then, a path naturally opened up, like his instincts reacted as soon as the moment was upon him. However, he wasn\u2019t able to focus on that sensation for long.\u2018I can see it again.\u2019In its excitement, the Orc swung wide and hadn\u2019t yet found its balance.\u2018The Orc\u2019s mouth.\u2019It was wide open.\u2018Right now\u2026\u2019Could he use Flash Step? If he wasn\u2019t able to deal a fatal blow, he would suffer a counterattack right after. But there wasn\u2019t time to ponder. The opening in the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s defense wouldn\u2019t last long. He didn\u2019t miss this brief moment or the tiny opening it afforded. There was no such thing as a perfectly safe attack, especially when the opponent was stronger than him.When fighting a strong opponent, a little gambling was necessary.[Using the special skill Flash Step.]He moved along a straight line that represented the shortest distance between one point to the next, instantly closing the gap. He saw the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s red, gaping mouth like he was looking at it through a telescope.\u2018Using the extra speed from Flash Step\u2026\u2019As one might expect, if this speed could be harnessed, it would lend incredible destructive force. If he could strike the Orc\u2019s weak point with this speed plus his own weight and strength, he would be able to deal a great deal of damage. He saw the Orc\u2019s mouth as a \u2018point\u2019.\u2018Pierce that point.\u2019Hyukjin wasn\u2019t conscious of the fact that he was physically embodying the \u2018Single Hit Finisher\u2019 he saw from Yeonseo before. The \u2018Observer\u2019 class Kim Hyukjin reproduced the skill used by the \u2018Swordsman\u2019 class Yeonseo. Even though their classes were different, his body was showing a new stage.Schwiiing\u2013!With the whistle of steel\u2014Spluuuurt!Hyukjin\u2019s sword penetrated the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s mouth, sticking out the back of the Orc\u2019s neck.\u201cSQUEAAAAL!\u201dThe Great Orc Warrior ululated a strangled cry, windmilling its arms at random from the unbearable pain.Bam!Hyukjin was struck by one of its flailing fists. Pain assaulted his wrist. He didn\u2019t get hit at a vital spot, and it wasn\u2019t a strike with real force behind it. It was literally just a graze, but he still took a lot of damage.\u2018I think my wrist is fractured.\u2019Like before, he kicked off the Great Orc Warrior to widen the distance, then looked briefly around.\u2018Everyone\u2026 is finished.\u2019Everyone completed their individual roles in their individual positions. They were indeed the heroes of the future. If just one person was missing, this raid would have been nearly impossible.Between choppy, labored breaths, Hyukjin said, \u201cMy last order. Remember it?\u201dAs soon as they heard his words, the waiting Sunghyun and Sung-gu moved. As Hyukjin recovered his breathing, he looked towards Senia, who was as expressionless as ever.\u2018I said I would set this stage, Senia.\u2019They weren\u2019t empty words. It wasn\u2019t possible to sway the Guardians with the likes of lies or deception. If you said you would show them, you had to show them.\u2018Since I told them I would show them a straight fight, I need to do that.\u2019What he had already shown them was certainly a more-than-decent spectacle, considering a level 30 Player had the clear edge over a Great Orc Warrior a good 10 levels higher.However, Hyukjin wasn\u2019t satisfied with that.\u2018This\u2026 is the climax.\u2019The quest bet on by the Herdsman of Las Vegas, the Courageous Lion King, and the Whispering Devil hurtled on to its climax, towards the climax Hyukjin directed.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81: Tomb of the Wind Warrior (5)The Great Orc Warrior flailing in pain would be greatly enraged that I, a human that was surely prey, could injure it to such a degree. Through Eye of Perception, I could feel it. A predator\u2019s rage.And I could tell.\u2018That rage is directed solely at me.\u2019Its blazing eyes were glaring at me over the distance I had put between us. But because of the pain, it wasn\u2019t able to do anything other than stare.\u2018So it will choose\u2026\u2019The Great Orc Warrior was an extremely strong monster. It also possessed considerable prowess in throwing its weapon. The throw would have very high accuracy in addition to great destructive force.\u2018...to throw the axe at me.\u2019And with a great deal of strength. In order to tear me, and me alone, to pieces, it would use every ounce of its strength. Because those crimson red eyes saw nothing other than me.\u2018It\u2019s moving.\u2019The Great Orc Warrior was definitely stronger than me. If I took a direct hit, a single blow might kill me. But that wasn\u2019t relevant until it happened.\u2018I\u2019d be a fool to get hit even though I know it\u2019s coming.\u2019I knew the attack was coming, and had even clearly perceived the speed and trajectory of that attack. Of course I wouldn\u2019t sit around to get hit by it. I had long since mentally prepared myself to dodge.I looked carefully, focusing. The moment it hurled its axe, it would reveal an opening.Sure enough\u2014\u201cSQUEAAAAL!\u201dThe Great Orc Warrior gave a guttural scream as it threw its axe at me.Whumpf\u2013 whumpf\u2013!The axe rotated fiercely in the air as it hurtled my way, so fast that it was no exaggeration to say it truly hurtled.From the very sound it made in the air, I could feel it.\u2018Massive destructive force.\u2019The attack was filled with insane power and was so fast it would have been difficult to dodge had I not predicted it in advance.But unfortunately for the Orc, both Sunhwa and I had expected it. Sunhwa was standing right next to me to prepare for potential danger, but even our little tank couldn\u2019t take that axe straight on. In a situation as dangerous as this, what she could do was limited to slightly changing its trajectory.\u2018That is Sunhwa\u2019s role.\u2019As commendable as it was, Sunhwa was well aware of her own role and was prepared to do her job.I turned slightly aside and dodged the axe.Bam!The axe buried itself into the ground. Having failed to land the hit, the Great Orc Warrior shrieked in even greater agitation.And then, I spoke.\u201cNow.\u201dNow was our chance, while the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s mind was solely concentrated on me.\u2018The really scary attack\u2026 is the one you don\u2019t know about.\u2019Even if the attacks were the same, getting hit by one you knew about was different from one that blindsided you. Right now, right here, Sung-gu and Sunghyun\u2019s attack could be called an \u2018unexpected attack\u2019 to the Great Orc Warrior.\u2018I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve practiced well for this.\u2019I made them practice matching their breathing, and it was all for this moment. From their lips came a unique language I couldn\u2019t understand, an incantation.[Phemo Haritanaya][Wedow Le-lavica-ta]A flame flickered to life in Sung-gu\u2019s palm, then became fierce flames that formed a whip. It was an ability that Sung-gu had used a lot in the past as well.\u2018Flame Whip.\u2019The Flame Whip he was showing now was pathetic compared to when he was a hero of Korea, but for the beginner period, it couldn\u2019t be any more magnificent. The next moment, that Flame Whip was covered by blue wind.\u2018They\u2019re doing well.\u2019Even though they were coordinating today for the first time, they were performing much better than I expected. The Flame Whip flew taut and straight at the Great Orc Warrior like an open-mouthed snake.\u2018Sunghyun is providing good support.\u2019If Sung-gu was handling the destructive force, then Sunghyun was fueling the flames and handling the precision. The two of them were covering each other\u2019s inadequacies.\u2018This is probably\u2026 the first magic fusion shown since the Cataclysm.\u2019These two certain geniuses were managing their first \u2018magic fusion\u2019 quite well.\u2018I knew they would do well.\u2019After all, the two of them were a famous combo to begin with. Even though they usually looked like two archenemies itching to have at it, as soon as they went into a raid, they showed off a partnership that was as harmonious as peanut butter and jelly. The way their personalities and classes matched up was unequaled.The Flame Whip wrapped in wind went straight into the Orc\u2019s mouth. Yoohyun balled his fist, yelling a triumphant \u201cNice!\u201dThe flames blazed within the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s mouth. Sweat poured from Sung-gu\u2019s forehead.\u201cThis goddamn bastard. It\u2019s resilient as all hell.\u201d He was using up all his mana to continue feeding the flames. \u201cDie, you goddamn bastard!\u201dThis was the climax I directed\u2014the Great Orc Warrior blazing like a torch.\u2018And the Iron Sword I put in there earlier\u2026\u2019The \u2018Iron Sword\u2019 penetrating its mouth would become molten iron that would melt the Great Orc Warrior from the inside, running down its esophagus to turn all of its insides to mush.\u201cSQUEAAAAAL!\u201dThe Great Orc Warrior flopped onto the ground. This play was coming to completion.\u201cYeonseo, Yoohyun.\u201dYeonseo and Yoohyun, our close combat fighters, stepped up. Yeonseo used her movement skill \u2018Heavenly Demonic Flying Step\u2019 to approach first. So that they could coordinate, she told Yoohyun what technique she would be using and where.\u201cSingle Hit Finisher. Back of head.\u201dMore precisely, the hole I\u2019d left in the back of the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s head. Yoohyun followed, barking out the name of his finisher. It wasn\u2019t really necessary, but he still said the skill name out loud. It was probably a habit he\u2019d gained from coordinating with Yeonseo.\u201cHammer Fist!\u201dYoohyun followed up Yeonseo\u2019s \u2018Single Hit Finisher\u2019 with his \u2018Hammer Fist\u2019 on the back of the collapsed and frothing-at-the-mouth Great Orc Warrior\u2019s head.Boom!The sound that shook the air was almost like an explosion, though it of course fell far short of the fist I remembered from the \u2018Fist King So Yoohyun\u2019.[Great Orc Warrior has been killed.][EXP acquired.][52 Coins acquired.]\u2018Perfect.\u2019It didn\u2019t count as a \u2018direct hunt\u2019. I did deal some damage and directed the hunt like a sovereign, but it was still calculated as me doing less than 50% damage.\u2018I think the Coins were given to me, the party leader.\u2019I just had to distribute them later. The \u2018Observer\u2019 class\u2026 seemed better than I first thought. If controlled well, I wouldn\u2019t need to worry too much about losing EXP.[\u2018Hunt all the Orc species monsters!\u2019 has been cleared.]* * *In addition to what the Herdsman of Las Vegas proposed, we cleared the gamble-of-a-quest issued by the Whispering Devil and Courageous Lion King. A gamble wasn\u2019t a gamble for nothing. It was high risk, high return.[The first proposal of the \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 is still valid.][Distributing rewards to all Players who participated.][The rewards being currently distributed are from clearing \u2018Secret Within the Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2019.]The rewards distribution proceeded in order. Right now, I couldn\u2019t even feel the throbbing from my broken wrist. The rewards were just that sweet.\u2018The rewards this time\u2026\u2019No rewards I\u2019d gotten before could even compare. A stream of rewards as massive as what Michelle must have gotten in the past came in, dazzling my eyes.[100,000 Coins acquired.][Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Gloves acquired.][U-Plex Dungeon First Entry Rights acquired.]Those were the rewards from the quest proposed by the Herdsman of Las Vegas.[Calculating an additional reward.][50,000 Coins acquired.]It didn\u2019t feel like a lot because I had just gotten 100,000 Coins, but frankly, 50,000 Coins alone was a massive amount. We got a measly 50 Coins from hunting the Great Orc Warrior. Considering that, I had just gotten a huge pile of Coins.\u2018Is it over?\u2019It wasn\u2019t.[Receiving a secret reward.]Hm?\u2018Secret reward?\u2019This must be the reward from the quest proposed by the Whispering Devil or Courageous Lion King. Of the two of them, the Whispering Devil was more likely to hatch such a scheme.[\u2018High Orc Spell Scroll\u2019 acquired.]Apparently, only I got this reward. The others didn\u2019t seem to know about it.\u2018The Whispering Devil gave this to me, huh.\u2019I could clearly see what the Whispering Devil was thinking. He was definitely an interesting bastard. By sending me this, it meant the Whispering Devil had, like me, already predicted what exactly would happen.\u2018This is gonna be fun.\u2019Our resident Two-Faced Swords(wo)man, Shin Yeonseo, became a lively young woman in her early 20s after sheathing her sword. She jumped with joy, her face as red as an apple, showing that she was extremely pleased with what she got.\u201cWowww! I got an Agility Potion!\u201dYoohyun got a Strength Potion, while Sunghyun and Sung-gu each got Elemental Affinity Potions. Everyone seemed to have gotten an item that suited them. As long as you could successfully win a gamble, it would indeed yield plentiful rewards.\u201cDayum. Hey, you saw that, right? I was super strong, no? Jo Sunghyun, you were just like a pedestal for my greatness, you hear? I did it all, you just assisted! Uhahah!\u201d\u201c...\u201dSung-gu was busy putting on airs in front of Sunghyun.\u201cShabam, shabam! You saw it, right? My Flame Whip was super awesome. You admit it, right? Yeah, of course you do. Admit it again? Right, gotcha. Wooow. I must be really fuckin\u2019 strong. Right?\u201d\u201c...Ah, yes. You\u2019re very strong,\u201d said Sunghyun in a flat voice.Everyone was excited from killing the Great Orc Warrior. Sunghyun was comparatively chill, and his eyes were saying, \u2018Okay, you bark all you want. I\u2019m gonna check my rewards,\u2019 which made me feel like I was almost looking at the future Sunghyun and Sung-gu.\u2018So they were like this from their beginner days, too.\u2019The young Sunghyun just answered, \u201cAh, yes\u201d, but later, he would bicker and quarrel with Sung-gu. But well, they could afford to enjoy this leisure right now.As she watched Sung-gu puff out his chest, Sunhwa muttered, looking somewhat displeased, \u201cIt was all thanks to my oppa, okay?\u201dSummary: Slight Brother Complex\u201cOppa did it all, okay?\u201dI decided to ignore her summary. I acted like I didn\u2019t hear her. Maybe she was acting like this because of puberty. Thankfully, the others didn\u2019t hear her because she spoke so quietly.Once the rewards calculation was finished, Guardian notices came in.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 continues to observe.]Like always, the Nameless Observer continued their endless observation. Guardians like the Lady of the Scales, True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain, or Giant of the Sunset didn\u2019t send me messages, most likely because they were focusing on their favorites.[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 is happy.]The host of this quest, the Herdsman of Las Vegas, also enjoyed the amusement. Up to this point, I heard two notices. Notices from the others aside, I was waiting for a notice from a certain someone.\u2018You\u2019re\u2026 gonna send a notice too.\u2019The Whispering Devil sent me a \u2018High Orc\u2019s Spell Scroll\u2019. That meant he\u2019d already seen something brewing among the Guardians. He went out of his way to send me this as a \u2018secret reward\u2019.\u2018When are you gonna send it?\u2019I waited patiently. He would definitely send me a notice, most likely before this flash gate was completely cleared and we were sent outside.I spoke up.\u201cI think we\u2019ve eliminated all the dangerous elements, but we need to look around. The condition to completely clear this place was to find the \u2018Secret Within the Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2019.\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t be hard. Eye of Perception didn\u2019t pick up anything dangerous, either. There was probably a Clear Crystal somewhere inside the tomb.So that meant we\u2019d cleared this place without a hitch. Everyone understood my words and moved towards the tombs.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYep!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201cGot it, hyung.\u201dAnd then, I heard some notices.\u2018I\u2019ve been waiting.\u2019They were the notices I had predicted.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82: Tomb of the Wind Warrior (6)[The \u2018Ruler of the Plains\u2019 burns with hostility towards you.][The \u2018Ruler of the Plains\u2019 detests you.][The \u2018Ruler of the Plains\u2019 has reached the limit of their patience.]In the past, when I hunted the Thin Hobgoblin, the Ruler of the Plains sent me a message saying that he disliked me.\u2018I can\u2019t be respected and chosen by every Guardian.\u2019I was producing content that would suit the tastes of the majority of Guardians, but I was well aware that I couldn\u2019t cater to the small portion of Guardians who had unique tastes.\u2018They must have been focusing on me ever since I killed the Thin Hobgoblin.\u2019The Ruler of the Plains could be considered a Guardian who had a greater fondness for monsters than for Players. There was an extremely famous incident in the past where the Ruler of the Plains caused trouble to Yoohyun.\u2018I\u2019ll discard the Ruler of the Plains here.\u2019The Whispering Devil already knew that the Ruler of the Plains would direct their gaze of hatred towards me. That was why he sent me the \u2018High Orc\u2019s Spell Scroll\u2019 as a secret reward. I saw in my mind\u2019s eye how things would play out.The Whispering Devil, the Ruler of the Plains, and me. What kind of scenario would occur with all three of us involved in one place?\u2018That\u2019ll be fun.\u2019I wasn\u2019t scared. Within five years, the Ruler of the Plains would disappear. I didn\u2019t know what kind of mechanism was behind the appearance and disappearance of Guardians, but it was known that no Players had heard notices from the Ruler of the Plains in five years\u2019 time.\u2018Alright, come at me, then.\u2019Right now, they wouldn\u2019t be able to try anything to get revenge. I made a legal Play. It was just that the Ruler of the Plains didn\u2019t like that Play.\u2018They won\u2019t be able to do anything right now, at least because the other Guardians might notice.\u2019But one day, they would move against me. For sure.\u2018Aiming for my weakness.\u2019A sudden attack was scary, but one I already knew about wasn\u2019t. It could be blocked. Just then, Sunhwa shouted.\u201cOppa!\u201dHolding something in her right hand, Sunhwa smiled brightly.\u201cI found it!\u201dA crystal glowing with a purple light was in her hand.\u2018She\u2019s smiling really brightly.\u2019It wasn\u2019t just my rose-tinted glasses as her brother kicking in\u2014it really was a 1000k watt smile, and it wasn\u2019t just her trying to look pretty or cute.State: Full of Enthusiasm / Addicted to Fried Chicken / Excited / HappyI felt Sunhwa\u2019s true feelings through Eye of Perception. She was extremely happy and thrilled that she found the crystal, though that \u2018addicted to fried chicken\u2019 part in the middle was a little funny.Sunhwa called out from afar, \u201cI found it! I did well, right?\u201dShe was covered in dirt from head to toe, like she seriously gave it her all. Even her face was smudged with something that looked like mud.Sung-gu said jokingly, \u201cDamn, I was trying to find it, but I lost to a frickin\u2019 middle schooler. How humiliating.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a normal crystal. It wasn\u2019t a crystal that would clear the gate when destroyed, but an information crystal that held some kind of info.[Crystal Holding the Secret Within the Tomb of the Wind Warrior]There is a special secret hidden within this crystal. When destroyed, you will acquire information related to the \u2018course of the Wind Warrior\u2019s life\u2019.Yoohyun got the crystal from Sunhwa.\u201cI\u2019ll destroy it, hyungnim!\u201dWhen it was in Sunhwa\u2019s palm, it looked pretty big, but the crystal looked like a kid\u2019s toy in Yoohyun\u2019s massive hand.\u201cHere I go!\u201dYoohyun started exerting his muscles. The veins in his right arm stood out. As his blood vessels expanded, Yoohyun\u2019s face turned beet red.\u201cHaah\u2026 haah\u2026!\u201d Breathing hard, Yoohyun turned to me. \u201cHyungnim, this thing isn\u2019t budging at all?\u201dI came closer to inspect the crystal.\u201cHm,\u201d I hummed, thinking. Apparently, it wasn\u2019t a crystal you could just break. Pure physical force wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201cSunghyun, you give it a try.\u201d\u201c...Alright.\u201dThe teen nodded. He hadn\u2019t spoken up, but it seemed like he had already picked up some kind of hint. As he put the crystal in his palm while we all watched to see what he would do, I could tell one thing.\u2018His movements are super natural.\u2019He acted almost like a person who knew exactly what he had to do to this crystal. It wasn\u2019t like he had knowledge from the future or anything. This was just his talent playing a role.\u2018Knowing what to do simply by looking\u2026\u2019It was like a mechanic who automatically knew how to work a machine even without a manual, like being able to play a game without reading the instructions. As soon as Sunghyun saw the crystal, he figured out what he had to do.[Observing with \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019.]I saw mana swirling within Sunghyun\u2019s body.\u2018It\u2019s fascinating to see every time.\u2019It felt very different from seeing with my physical eyes. I couldn\u2019t quite put it in words, but an energy shining with blue light went through Sunghyun\u2019s heart and out his palm and back in, over and over again. The energy seemed to be alive\u2014it moved almost like it had its own will.\u2018I guess this is how the mana moves when we use skills.\u2019I could only observe the tip of the iceberg right now. After all, my \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 proficiency was only 1 at the moment.\u2018The more my proficiency increases, the more I should be able to observe.\u2019I already couldn\u2019t wait for that moment. I\u00a0 didn\u2019t know how long it would take, but in any case, I was full of anticipation for the future. My life was already miles apart from the past, when I lived without a future, without hope, just trudging on with my eyes fixed on the present. I could succeed now. I could forge my own future. That\u2019s what I believed.\u2018The mana inside the Clear Crystal\u2026 is being transferred to Sunghyun\u2019s body.\u2019It was only possible to trace the flow with Observer\u2019s Eye. An energy resembling purple smoke went into Sunghyun\u2019s palm and was absorbed into his body.\u2018He probably got some quest or something.\u2019I guessed he got something related to the \u2018Secret of the Wind Warrior\u2019, but I didn\u2019t pry. There was no pressing need to find out right now.[The Clear Crystal has been destroyed.][The Flash Gate \u2018Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2019 has been cleared.]The gate itself was cleared, but we didn\u2019t get any additional rewards.[The rewards that can be obtained within the \u2018Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2019 have already reached their maximum limit.][The reward for clearing the Flash Gate will not be given.]I wasn\u2019t too sorry to hear that. I\u2019d already received a way bigger harvest than I had expected.\u2018150k Coins total, High Orc Spell Scroll, U-Plex Dungeon First Entry Rights, and Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Gloves.\u2019They were all fantastic. But there was a prize better than all others.\u2018I\u2019ve fully determined how the Observer class will grow.\u2019I had the pros and cons of the Observer class nearly down pat, and figured out what the Nameless Observer wanted from me a little more concretely. That gave me a direction for my future Playing.\u2018That\u2019s the biggest gain.\u2019And plus,\u2018I\u2019ve also acquired Sunghyun\u2019s full trust.\u2019We earned a great party member. Though there were strong indications that he wouldn\u2019t get along with Sung-gu, when these two worked together, their power would be equal to ten magicians put together.[Teleporting from the Flash Gate \u2018Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2019 to the Flash Gate \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019.][The key, the \u2018Final Wind\u2019, is necessary.]A hologram appeared before our eyes.[ _ _ _ _ _ _ ]And underneath it appeared a keyboard of arrows.Apparently, we were supposed to type in the correct combination.\u201cBoss Hyukjin. What is this? I\u2019ve got no clue.\u201d[If you cannot find the key, one of the Players will die.][You have 1 minute.]Everyone\u2019s expressions darkened. My heart became heavy as well.\u2018This is\u2026\u2019I had a feeling. But I couldn\u2019t be 100% sure.[Remaining time: 40 seconds]I spoke quickly. \u201cI think I know what this is.\u201d35 seconds left.\u201cBut I can\u2019t be 100% sure. I remember the wind shape that blowed when we left the Hill of Blowing Wind. The arrows match the number of blank spaces.\u201d25 seconds left.\u201cIf you guys agree, I\u2019ll try putting it in.\u201d15 seconds left. There wasn\u2019t much time, and I was the only one who had a clue.\u201cOkay, I\u2019m in full agreement.\u201d\u201cOppa, me too.\u201d\u201cDammit, me too.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d5 seconds left.\u2018The wind that blew when I blew out the candle.\u2019I remembered a refreshing wind blowing then as if to celebrate the clear we had just achieved.[You have successfully found the key.][Teleporting to the \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019.][The flow of time has been distorted.][Entering the \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019.]We came back.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - LeiProofreader - AshJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u2018The flow of time was distorted.\u2019That had to mean that while we were clearing the \u2018Tomb of the Wind Warrior\u2019, the time within the \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019 was frozen. When we found ourselves back on the hill, the other Players didn\u2019t realize our absence at all.\u2018So this moment\u2026 is when I discovered the candle on Sunghyun\u2019s back.\u2019I heard a voice.\u201cWhat nonsense are you tryna say?\u201dIt was the voice of the Brown Bear Kim Taechun. He was glaring at me. He\u2019d seen me on the 1st Floor and had apparently pegged me as \u2018prey\u2019, since he was a self-proclaimed predator.I retorted back, \u201cWhat?\u201dScowling to show his displeasure at my casual tone, Taechun rolled his right shoulder, producing cracking noises.\u201cThat\u2019s weird. I thought there was something on the kid\u2019s back. Anyway, I dare you to try something weird. I\u2019ll cut off your head.\u201dYoohyun stepped forward. \u201cOi. You sure have a lot of crap to say.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cYou asking for another beating?\u201dTaechun tucked his tail between his legs, muttering, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I messed with you, jeez.\u201dMumbling to himself was all the resistance he could muster.\u2018Tsk tsk.\u2019He was still a famous Player in his own right, so it was a little pathetic to see him so cowed by a single beating. If he acted like this, he would also lose the Courageous Lion King\u2019s backing.\u2018Guess he\u2019ll disappear before long.\u2019He would either die within a dungeon or gate, or be killed by some Player. In any case, it was unlikely he would leave his name in history\u2019s annals.\u2018Originally, Kim Taechun never got beaten by Yoohyun or Yeonseo.\u2019Once again, the past changed a little because of my Playing. However, I didn\u2019t regret it. I did what I should, and thanks to that, many Players survived.[The Flash Gate \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019 has been cleared.][Leaving the gate.]I had earned so much from this place. It was no exaggeration to say I was walking a path paved with gold, one that couldn\u2019t even compare to the past. My mood soared.Someone shouted, \u201cWe\u2019re back!\u201dAt least in this moment, everyone was a friend and an ally. A few people even embraced each other and ran around in joy. Yoohyun and Sung-gu stood next to me.\u201cHyungnim. Shouldn\u2019t we be acting like that, too?\u201d\u201cDamn, yeah. We should also hug it out and cheer, let our bromance shine\u2026\u201d The words died in Sung-gu\u2019s throat. He and Yoohyun took a cautious step back.\u201cWait, hyungnim. I wasn\u2019t saying I\u2019d really hug you.\u201d\u201cGoddamn, so scary. You could destroy the world with that gaze.\u201dYeonseo snickered. \u201cIyaa, anyway, we got a safe clear again. And the rewards are also uh-may-zing. Like I thought, it\u2019s most fun to Play with the boss. Right, Sunhwa?\u201dSunhwa nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s super reassuring when oppa is there. And it also feels super efficient.\u201d\u201cYeah, your oppa is the best.\u201dI just feigned deafness. Jo Sunghyun was looking around in silence.\u2018I\u2019m sure he got something related to the Clear Crystal earlier. He\u2019s probably thinking about whether he should share that or not.\u2019Without Observer\u2019s Eye, I wouldn\u2019t have known, either.\u2018With his personality\u2026 it will take a little time.\u2019He was calm and cool-headed. He would take his time thinking about it subjectively. And if he decided in the end that I was worthy of his trust, he would come and consult me for advice.\u2018There\u2019s a very high chance he\u2019ll do that.\u2019Personally, I thought there was a 99% chance he would come to me.\u2018Let\u2019s give him a little time.\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83: Laying Bear BaitWe made it back to the hall of the 12th floor that immediately ported us to the first gate, the \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019. The hall had several entrances and exits, and on the far side of the room, I saw members from the guild that would later stand tall as Korea\u2019s top guild, \u2018Taeguk Shield\u2019. They had intentionally come in late.\u2018The reason why they\u2019ve come in only now\u2026\u2019 In the past, I didn\u2019t think anything of it, but now, I knew better. \u2018Is because they have the Precognitive Dream user Ham Sohyun.\u2019I didn\u2019t know the range of her Precognitive Dream ability, but there was a high chance that she predicted some kind of danger here, which caused Sungshin\u2019s flagship \u2018Taeguk Shield\u2019 to come later.\u2018Or it\u2019s because they wanted to make a late arrival, like protagonists.\u2019Either way, I could now see the Taeguk Shield guildies that hadn\u2019t been present during the clear of the Hill of Blowing Wind. Among them was Song Jinchul\u2019s oldest brother, Song Kiyeol. He was the guildmaster of Taeguk Shield.TN: Author has changed the name of Sungshin\u2019s eldest grandson from Song Jinseok to Song Kiyeol.\u2018I guess he\u2019d be in his early 30s now.\u2019The guildmaster shared the same nickname as the guild\u2014Taeguk Shield. He became well-known as a fairly outstanding tank. In addition to him, there was the Poison Witch Cheon Sooji, the Golden Priest Gong Jinhoon, and the Spear Demon Byeon Gilsup\u2026\u2018Wow. Lots of bigshots here.\u2019They finally showed up. They were the people I would be drawing out the future with. Soon, they would make my worth skyrocket. They were supporting actors in my scenario, so to speak.As I mused, many Players celebrated.\u201cW-We\u2019re back!\u201d\u201cI survived!\u201dAs they relished in the joy of being alive, some started talking about the clear rewards again, while others cried, their expressions dark.\u00a0While everyone was still elated from their safe return, someone approached me.\u201cMr. Kim Hyukjin. I am relieved to see you are safe.\u201dIt was a group of four men.\u2018What\u2019s this now?\u2019 I thought with amusement. Two of the four men were familiar faces. The person standing at the very front was Kim Kangchul, who I had been acquainted with in my previous life as well, and the other was Song Jinchul.[Non-Awakened]Name: Song JinchulAge: 14State: Disdain / Slight Rage / JealousyDisposition: Arrogant / Destructive / SelfishSummary:Self-Proclaimed Chosen OneSelf-Judged Expert of Negotiation and ThreatIs a non-Awakened.The disposition/state/summary only show the most representative and can change according to the situation.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible.I was still getting \u201cBecause Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible\u201d, but I was still able to read more information than before. I could now see two summaries.\u2018I only saw Self-Proclaimed Chosen One in the past.\u2019 This time, there was another summary under it. \u2018Self-Judged Expert of Negotiation and Threat?\u2019Jinchul moved to the front to blatantly look me up and down. Being in his first year of middle school, he was short, small, and had a reedy voice, yet he acted like he was on top of the world. Apparently, the task of talking to me had been entrusted to Jinchul.He pointed at me, someone much older than him, with his chin.\u201cYou\u2019re Kim Hyukjin?\u201d\u201c...\u201dI stared back at the youngest grandson of the Sungshin chaebol. Our first meeting had been rather unpleasant as well.\u201cWho are you to make Grandpa so interested in you?\u201dWas this the jealousy of a grandson who was robbed of his grandpa\u2019s attention? Ah, that explained his state.State: Disdain / Slight Rage / JealousyI found him more cute than anger-inducing. He was clearly jealous, but still trying to look down on me.\u2018The reason why President Song sent such a kid to me\u2026\u2019 I immediately read his intent. \u2018Is because he\u2019s curious as to how I\u2019ll handle him.\u2019There was a really high chance he was testing me. He wanted to see if I was truly someone with the skills to back my refusal of the Taeguk Shield guildmaster position.\u2018If he\u2019s really that curious, I\u2019ll show him.\u2019For the time being, dancing to the President\u2019s tune wasn\u2019t that bad an option. That would increase my value and worth.\u2018He\u2019ll probably be very shocked.\u2019Even I was shocked by myself.My party members. Taeguk Shield guild members. Kim Taechun. The youngest grandson, Song Jinchul.Using these keywords, I drafted a completely new picture, one where I would work with my party members and use all of the above elements to maximize our value.\u201cYeah. I\u2019m Kim Hyukjin, what about it?\u201d\u201cMister. Did you just speak down to me?\u201d\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d\u201cAre you crazy? Do you not know who I am?\u201d\u201cNope, I don\u2019t.\u201dThe no-good chaebol scion quickly flared to anger, spitting out with agitation, \u201cIf you don\u2019t know who I am, then you have to be taught. Oi, make that bastard kneel before me.\u201dBeing this disillusioned at his age was called chuunibyou syndrome.\u201cWhat are you doing? I said grab that trash and make him kneel before me! Didn\u2019t you hear me?!\u201dThe members of Taeguk Shield glanced our way.To start things off, this brat was due for a friendly little beatdown.[Using the special ability Mettle.]My Mettle had crushed Orcs that could tear apart Song Jinchul and the other four men here with one hand. This ability was a rank higher than the one possessed by Jinchul\u2019s grandfather, the 1st President of Sungshin, Song Kiyoung.Mettle instantly crushed the group of four.\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dJinchul became deathly white. Kim Kangchul in front of him was the same. It was my first time using the ability on people, but it was apparently extremely effective.I patted Jinchul\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHave some manners, kid. A person\u2019s at their coolest when they talk to others with respect.\u201dI then walked past the frightened Jinchul. As Sunhwa trailed behind me, she stuck out her tongue and blew a quiet raspberry, but I just let it slide. Being slighted by a little girl he\u2019d never seen before might actually be even more humiliating to Jinchul.Knowing that it would take the kid some time to shake off the effects of Mettle, I walked to one of the hall\u2019s exits. I could feel with Eye of Perception that quite a few people had been gathered here to control the Players within.\u2018They purposefully went for a heavy-handed atmosphere.\u2019All the \u2018Players Association\u2019 had to do was formally apologize much, much later.\u2018To push the Players into submission.\u2019The Players were still in their early stages of growth. It was clear to me that the Players Association wanted to grab control while they still could. At least in the early game, that wasn\u2019t a terrible strategy\u2014it would allow the Players Association to quickly take its place and gain the wholehearted(?) cooperation of the Players.\u2018Sometimes, force is more effective than democratic or peaceful methods.\u2019Yoohyun had proven that to me earlier. Sungshin must have come to the same conclusion.\u2018President Song Kiyoung intentionally crafted this situation.\u2019I could see his intent like it was written in red paint. It was fun.\u201cYou cannot leave.\u201dThey weren\u2019t as big as Yoohyun, but intimidatingly large people, hired muscle in black suits, were blocking the door.\u2018Most of them are non-Awakened.\u2019Seeing that made me laugh. Even the oh-so-mighty President Song hadn\u2019t even begun to see the true power of Players yet.\u2018What would have happened if the Players hadn\u2019t submitted in the past and rioted?\u2019Even Kim Taechun over there could have easily wiped out these hired guards if he went wild with his axe. That was how enormous the gap between a Player and a non-Awakened was.\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked.\u201cThe Players Association Chairman has instructed it.\u201dI hummed, then looked around again. Up to this point, it was still the same as the past. Quite a lot of people were milling around on the 12th floor.Someone I didn\u2019t know picked up a mic and started talking. \u201cPlayers, your attention, please. With the situation the way it is, I will get right to the point.\u201dWhat he said was simple. There were a lot of casualties, so the Players Association would use their authority to find out exactly what happened in the gate. To do that, they would seek the cooperation of one person after another to hear what they had to say. They said it was to assemble a \u201cdatabase\u201d, but the atmosphere in the room was almost one of interrogation.\u2018The beginner Players have been pretty much cowed.\u2019It might also be that they were unwillingly surrendering to the authority held by the \u2018Players Association\u2019. What they did was none of my business. I just had to Play my own way.\u2018I\u2019ll leave\u2026 the big picture for another day.\u2019I decided not to wrangle with the big picture today. Even if I didn\u2019t step in, in a future not too far from now, the Players would realize on their own that there was no need to be so submissive to the Players Association.\u201cBoss,\u201d said Yeonseo, her voice low. \u201cThe mood here is so frosty\u2026 Did we commit some kind of crime? It seriously feels like they\u2019re treating us like criminals.\u201dShe was smiling brightly, but I could feel bloodthirst from her. I felt the hired muscle blocking our way flinch.Picking his nose, Sung-gu drawled, \u201cJust gimme the okay anytime and I\u2019ll burn them all to a crisp. You know my online handle, right? I\u2019m the Jayandong Firemaster.\u201dI\u2019d leave the big picture for another day, but there was no need to lower my value and the value of my team. I decided to live this life differently. I would forge my own life, and I wasn\u2019t going to be unfaithful to that creed here.Intentionally speaking up so that the surrounding people could hear me, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. We didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Someone purposefully created this heavy-handed atmosphere. Though I won\u2019t say who that someone is.\u201dFinally breaking free from the influence of Mettle, Song Jinchul shouted at me like he was having a fit. \u201cWhat bullshit are you saying?! What you\u2019re saying makes zero sense!\u201dI would show this kid\u2014no, President Song\u2014whether I was saying bullshit or not.\u2018Let me show you how I set the stage.\u2019That stage\u2026 would be bigger than he expected.Just then, Senia sent me a whisper request.\u2013Player Kim Hyukjin. I have a question.\u2013Ask away.\u2013What is the ultimate picture you are drawing? I cannot figure out where you are going with this.I wasn\u2019t surprised.\u2013Trying to spoil the Guardians?\u2013No. It is just that I need to know your intent so I can film a little more properly.Very good, Senia was also continuing to grow. I was happy to see it.\u2013I\u2019ll explain it just once, so listen up. If you can, use one Pause authority.Senia hesitated, but in the end, she used a Pause. Everyone and everything other than Senia and me became black and white.\u201cI\u2019ll make it brief. I\u2019m going to use that kid Song Jinchul to send President Song Kiyoung a message\u2014to not look down on us, and to properly evaluate our value.\u201d\u201cIs that all?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019d be no fun if that was all.\u201dI had to design this step by step, layer by layer.\u201cListen well. First, I\u2019ll provoke Song Jinchul. Afterwards, Kim Taechun will take action, and when that happens, Taeguk Shield will also take action. After that, other Taeguk Shield guild members will move.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t understand the process. I\u2019m just talking about the result. I hope you\u2019ll film accordingly.\u201d\u201cThen is your provocation just now of Song Jinchul bait?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSenia definitely grew a bit. She evolved from a fucking beginner to just a beginner.\u201cAnd then Kim Taechun will move?\u201d\u201cI have to make that happen, yeah.\u201dAlright, it seemed she was clear on that much.\u201cBut how is Kim Taechun taking action connected to Taeguk Shield taking action? I cannot see any connection.\u201d After saying that, Senia\u2019s wings quivered for a moment. \u201cAh, you can\u2019t mean\u2014!\u201dOho, she must have guessed without me even needing to explain. Like Senia realized, there were other elements involved in this picture, though they couldn\u2019t be seen with the naked eye.\u201cYour prediction is correct. I will make them move.\u201d\u201cSong Jinchul is bait, as is Kim Taechun. I have judged that your true goal is Taeguk Shield.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re quite close.\u201dIt seemed like Senia got the gist of what I was going to do. She had really gotten much smarter.\u201cDo you plan on acquiring Taeguk Shield?\u201d\u201cYeah, something like that.\u201dI did omit a few parts of the process. There would be several stages to acquiring the guild. It wasn\u2019t something I could swallow in one gulp just because I had a vague desire to do so.\u201cI understand your intent, but I cannot see the process.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll show you.\u201dSenia\u2019s wings trembled once, very quickly.\u201cI will use this knowledge to inform my filming. Although I don\u2019t know the exact details of the process, I can see where you are going now.\u201dShe\u2019d see soon enough.\u2018In the end, Taeguk Shield will become mine.\u2019And through it, I would have a share of Sungshin\u2019s hefty support. I would get everything there was to get, and this would open the doors to a far more efficient Play.The first stroke of this grand blueprint would be drawn out now.[The Pause has been deactivated.]The world regained its color.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84: Laying Bear Bait (2)\u201cMr. Kim Kangchul,\u201d I said, trying to remember what his actual title was. Oh, right. It was Team Leader. Team Leader of the Player Scouting Team.\u201cYes, Mr. Kim Hyukjin.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t affected by Mettle anymore, but I could feel he was more restrained with me.\u201cSomehow\u2026 it feels like we are being treated like subordinates.\u201d\u201cSurely not. That\u2019s not the case at all.\u201d Kim Kangchul shook his head, his expression earnest. \u201cIt is just that we wish to acquire slightly more precise information about the gate that just formed, as well as confirm Player casualties. We must know what happened in the gate in detail. That is the duty of the Players Association.\u201d\u2018Players Association\u2019 was the grand name for what was actually a private subsidiary of Sungshin. In other words, this was all just a corporation\u2019s profit-seeking.For now, I kept up the charade and put it nicely.\u201cIt sounds like you intend on building a database.\u201d\u201cYes. We will gather all kinds of data and make a large collection of information. In a way that will help mankind.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t information that would help mankind, but information that would help Sungshin. But I didn\u2019t say that. They were doing what was profitable for them, and I, of course, was doing the same. That wasn\u2019t bad. Rather, it was all too natural. It was just that there was no need for me to lower myself for their profit.\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t want to cooperate?\u201d\u201cYou will have no choice but to cooperate.\u201dHe was exuding the same peculiar confidence I had felt last time, too.\u2018Even though he\u2019s a team leader\u2026\u2019It wasn\u2019t like his insight was particularly outstanding.Summary:Ordinary Person Hungry for SuccessA lot could be inferred from his summary. \u2018Ordinary Person\u2019 being in his summary meant that he was a regular guy with no special traits.\u2018In ten years, he\u2019ll become the Players Association\u2019s Head of Personnel.\u2019Making it fairly high up despite having ordinary abilities could only mean one thing. He either hugged the right thigh, or made a good impression on his superior. He was good at climbing the so-called \u201ccorporate ladder\u201d.\u2018That\u2019s why he hasn\u2019t recognized the worth of Players and is responding like this.\u2019Had President Song really not known that Kim Kangchul would act like this?\u2018No. He must have known.\u2019I had an inkling that he purposefully sent Team Leader Kim. He picked out a person who could act calmly, without a hint of reserve. That was the President\u2019s tactic to maintain this farce. He was also bound to be curious as to how I would handle his grandson, a long-time sufferer of chuunibyou.\u201cYou seem to be very confident.\u201d\u201cBecause all Players in Korea will become members of the Korean Players Association.\u201d\u201cIs that law?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t. It was just that the Players themselves hadn\u2019t realized their own value and were still dazed after the whirlwind of events where several Players died. That was why they were cooperating with Sungshin.\u201cIt will soon become law.\u201dI had no doubt it would. After all, Sungshin had an enormous sway over the government.\u2018However.\u2019As enormous and powerful as Sungshin was, the latent power and worth we Players held was just as big.\u201cBy soon, you mean that it isn\u2019t law yet.\u201d I took a step closer to Kim Kangchul. \u201cI\u2019m not very happy about this high-handed atmosphere, the feeling of being interrogated. I refuse to cooperate with Sungshin in such a situation. I am not an employee of Sungshin.\u201dThe prey should be taking the bait around now. I could feel Song Jinchul\u2019s body trembling with rage.\u201cAnd I have absolutely zero desire to kneel to a rude brat like him.\u201dConsidering that he submitted to \u2018Mettle\u2019 earlier, his pride was surely well and properly dented.Summary: Self-Proclaimed Chosen One Whose Pride is Injured\u201cMister. Move.\u201dMy target was never Kim Kangchul. It was always the young rascal named Song Jinchul. Kim Kangchul stepped back.\u201cDid someone shit in your cereal? Is your head for show? Do you not know who I am?\u201dOf course I did. A 3rd generation chaebol spoiled brat. I retorted back, \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cJust why the hell are you kicking up a fuss when you don\u2019t even know who I am?\u201dJinchul\u2019s eyes filled with astonishment. He was really easy to handle. This chaebol young master had surely never experienced such treatment before. A delusional edgelord just needed to be treated like a delusional edgelord.\u201cDoes being a 3rd generation chaebol kid make you invulnerable to pain?\u201d\u201cY-Youuuu\u2014!\u201d Jinchul\u2019s body quivered, and then he burst out with a stream of hostility. \u201cI am Song Jinchul! The person who will one day become the rightful master of Sungshin!\u201dAfter revealing his identity, Song Jinchul puffed out his chest. The powerful name \u2018Sungshin\u2019 filled him with hot air.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Scared?\u201d\u201cAs if.\u201d I gave him an intentional smirk. \u201cA middle school student who talks down to a team leader of Sungshin. A young kid with no qualifications who can willfully barge into matters between Players and the Association. A moron with not a single rat\u2019s tail of respect or manners.\u201d Even without Eye of Perception, I would have realized who this brat was. \u201cAnyone could tell with their eyes closed that you\u2019re most likely a 3rd generation chaebol brat.\u201d\u201c...\u201dSong Jinchul\u2019s face flushed red hot.State: Very AngryAll the other emotions had been pushed aside, making it so that Eye of Perception could pick up only \u2018rage\u2019. The boy was very mad, it seemed.Song Jinchul spat out, \u201cYou. You\u2019re going to regret this.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to make you feel regret right now?\u201dI took one step closer. The three bodyguards behind Jinchul stepped in front of him, almost like they were his guardian knights. But it was fine; I\u2019d never intended on laying a hand on the kid anyway.\u2018Now, he\u2019ll run off to grandpa and tell him what happened today.\u2019What President Song\u2019s spoiled grandson would tell him would inevitably differ from what Kim Kangchul would tell him. The kid would probably spill the whole story without a filter.I looked Song Jinchul dead in the eye. \u201cThe information we have is essentially new culture. That will soon become the driving force for the future.\u201d\u201c...\u201dPresident Song Kiyoung, please listen up.\u201cI won\u2019t sell my worth for mere peanuts.\u201d I smirked again. \u201cAnd especially not to a spoiled brat like you.\u201d\u201cY-Y-Youuuu\u2014!\u201d\u201cNo matter how young you might be, it\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve got absolutely zero eye for things. Do you think a 3rd generation chaebol kid like you could really inherit the company? Is your grandpa really so foolish?\u201dI blatantly attacked the premier chaebol of Korea, as well as Song Kiyoung himself. All of my words would no doubt enter the President\u2019s ears via his grandson. Without a filter.[The \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 is greatly satisfied by your attitude and guts.]It seemed the Merchant of Venice liked my response, too.\u2018Considering President Song\u2019s personality\u2026\u2019I had already met the President once. He might be slightly incensed that I went after a young kid, but he was definitely not one to mix private and work matters. He would actually end up seeing me in a new light. After all, there weren\u2019t many people who could talk to Jinchul like this even after knowing he was President Song\u2019s grandson. At least, not in Korea.\u2018I\u2019ll show you that this kind of method won\u2019t work on me, on us.\u2019I didn\u2019t look kindly to being treated like a criminal dragged to the interrogation room and being made to share each and every thing that happened, rewards and tips included. In this rapidly changing new world, information was essentially money, power, and authority. I couldn\u2019t just sit here and let that be taken from me with cattle prods.\u2018And even if I were to give you information, there should be appropriate compensation.\u2019I was sending President Song a message loud and clear through his grandson. Instead of using a method like this, come with a more attractive carrot next time. Something a little better than a pathetic 2 million annual salary contract. Something a little more appropriate for our worth.\u2018If it\u2019s President Song, he\u2019ll get what I\u2019m saying.\u2019That was enough for using Jinchul as my mouthpiece.\u2018Alright, I\u2019ve laid the framework.\u2019Now, it was time for the slightly bigger picture. There were two reasons why I refused to cooperate with them. The first was that I didn\u2019t want to lower our value and asking prices. The second was to make someone witness our quarreling.\u2018Someone in this room.\u2019 I glimpsed someone with a bulky physique walking over in a rage. \u2018Someone like the Brown Bear Kim Taechun.\u2019Taechun had already lost to Yeonseo in a 1 vs. 1 and was one-sidedly beaten by Yoohyun, so his pride must\u2019ve been sorely bruised. Despite that, his summary was still \u2018Self-Proclaimed Predator\u2019. It seemed he was still riding the \u2018hero high\u2019 from destroying the pillars.\u2018Taechun has labeled me as prey.\u2019I had already sensed his gaze stabbing into me. My Eye of Perception continuously picked up a gaze prickly with not-so-friendly intentions. There was no doubt that the Courageous Lion King\u2019s quest was still unfinished.The picture was all drawn out.\u2018You must be desperate to catch the eye of Sungshin, yes?\u2019If he wanted to do that, he\u2019d have to pick a fight with me. He also had decent justification to do so, since I was the only one refusing to cooperate. If he suppressed me, he would look very valiant.\u2018Ah.\u2019But he was hesitating and not rushing in. From the look in his eyes and the energy I could feel from him via Eye of Perception, he clearly wanted to dash over and shout, \u201cWhy\u2019re you the only one acting out, you bluffing piece of shit!\u201d But he was holding back.\u2018Wait, I think it\u2019s because Yoohyun and Yeonseo are next to me.\u2019I realized the reason.\u201cYoohyun and Yeonseo, go somewhere else. Naturally. Without making it obvious,\u201d I said quietly, turning briefly to the two.Yoohyun immediately started whistling. There wasn\u2019t even music, but he even danced with his shoulders. All of a sudden? Whistling, here? I told him to not make it obvious, but he made it so awkward I nearly withered on the inside. Sung-gu shook his head and followed, muttering, \u201cHaah, that idiot.\u201d\u2018I shouldn\u2019t\u2026 make him act.\u2019It looked, by all accounts, that I shouldn\u2019t make Yoohyun act.In comparison, Yeonseo slipped away and blended into another group of Players rather naturally. From her noticeably light steps, I suspected she was using her movement skill.That left just me, Sunghyun, and Sunhwa.\u2018Sunghyun is a thorn in his side.\u2019Sunghyun played a decisive role in the \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019 clear. Taechun was sure to be unhappy with him.\u2018And Sunhwa\u2019s easy to underestimate.\u2019As far as Taechun could see, I no longer had anyone to protect me.\u2018He\u2019ll come now, right?\u2019Sure enough, the large man approached. This bear was very good at taking bait.\u201cOi. I\u2019ve been listening over there.\u201d He came right up to me, looming over me with his massive frame. He lived up to his nickname. \u201cYou\u2019re being a bit harsh there. Do you think all the Players here are stupid? The folks from the Association are saying we should work together to gather data, so why\u2019re you being so difficult? Are you the only one who\u2019s too good for this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think the folks from the Association will do after gathering the data?\u201d\u201cWell obviously, they\u2019ll\u2026 make things way better for later Playing. Cause we\u2019ll have more info.\u201dOnce again, I smirked. Perhaps finding my actions amusing, the Merchant of Venice sent me a gift.[The \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 sends you the temporary skill \u2018Smiling Provocation\u2019.]Like the name suggested, it was an ability that would make the opposite party feel terrible as you smiled at them. It wasn\u2019t some big awesome skill, and later, it would even be frequently used via scrolls. The ability was something akin to a \u2018joke\u2019.[Using the temporary skill Smiling Provocation.]I smirked, knowing that it would greatly irritate Taechun.\u201cDo you truly think it will make things better for Playing?\u201d I shook my head, as if telling him he was wrong. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t think the Players Association is moving for the good of the public? Since when has Sungshin been a charity?\u201dAt this time, the Players Association would not act for the good of the public. They were 100% a private subsidiary working for Sungshin.\u201cThis is a place where Sungshin, recognizing the value of new tech,\u00a0invited\u00a0Players, the people most closely related to new tech.\u201dTo say it outright\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s laughable that they\u2019re already treating us like their company employees. It\u2019s hard to tell whether they\u2019ve invited us or are interrogating us.\u201dTaechun\u2019s face reddened a little.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a superior-subordinate relationship.\u201d Raising my voice a little, I said, \u201cThis is a type of business cooperation, one where our interests must align for us to work together. Do you think that in a business, the other party will give me equal treatment if I\u2019m lowering my worth, taking initiative to bow down low, and scrambling to present myself as a slave? Idiot.\u201dI continued to read his mood with Eye of Perception.\u2018That\u2019s right. Get mad. Exactly as I want you to.\u2019\u201cIs that block above your shoulders an ornament?\u201dI never intended on having a logical debate with Kim Taechun. That wasn\u2019t his role in the picture I was drawing.\u201cShit like you who\u2019s all bark and no bite dares\u2026!\u201d Taechun fumed. \u201cI tolerated you because you\u2019re a non-combat class, but there\u2019s no second chance for you, you piece of shit.\u201d\u2018That\u2019s right. In my scenario, this is your role. Getting whipped into a frenzy,\u2019 I sneered inwardly. Up to this point, the scene was progressing as I wished.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is observing you.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 ridicules your articulate mouth.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is having fun.][The \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 has a high evaluation of you.]The next part was already set in stone.\u2018As I thought.\u2019The situation unfolded exactly as I conceived it.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: Enlightenment\u201cI tolerated you because you\u2019re a non-combat class, but there\u2019s no second chance for you, you piece of shit.\u201dSo what was he gonna do about it? PVP with a non-combat class Player?\u2018Though by future standards, that\u2019s completely out of the question.\u2019Before I regressed, there were many cases where non-combat classes played a more active role than combat classes. Be it detoxification, heals, or buffs, there were fewer non-combat class Players than combat Players, and they were rare.In addition, the worth of a Player had massive differences depending on their proficiency and type of ability. With that in mind, each of the guilds made tacit rules to prevent combat class Players from persecuting non-combat class Players.\u2018A combat Player sending a non-combat Player a PVP request?\u2019That was ridiculous. If guilds were a little more well-established, Kim Taechun would\u2019ve probably gotten dragged away and beaten by his guildmaster.Especially\u2026 because I was a Player with a class called \u201cObserver\u201d and played a role close to a \u2018sovereign\u2019.\u2018Well, it\u2019s not like he knows.\u2019Among the non-combat classes, the classes that received the best treatment were the ones in the sovereign category. It was a little embarrassing to say it myself, but there was a reason why Yeonseo constantly praised me, saying that the perceived difficulty was worlds apart when I was there versus when I wasn\u2019t. Sovereign classes were literally noble classes. They were hard to raise, hard to pull off, and even harder to become a high-level Ranker with. But once they made it there, they were nobles who stood above all others.Notices came in.[You have received a PVP request.][If you accept, a PVP Zone will be declared.]From this, I inferred one more thing.\u2018A beginner Player under level 30 sent the PVP request on his own accord.\u2019In order to send a PVP request, you had to receive the permission of a high-level \u2018sovereign Player\u2019, or receive the help of an Intermediate Administrator, like what Percy did earlier. Or\u2026 a Guardian would have to intervene.\u2018The courage-lover stepped in again.\u2019It seemed our little courage-lover bestowed Taechun the right to make a PVP request. That was how much he wanted to see this fight between us.\u201cI\u2019m certain I\u2019ve already told you many times that I\u2019m a non-combat class.\u201d\u201cSo what? Gonna run away like a coward?\u201dHe openly sneered at me. His eyes were full of scorn, as well as the confidence of a predator. The current Kim Taechun was convinced that \u2018combat Players are the true Players\u2019.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m just a little worried.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You won\u2019t die,\u201d Taechun said, guffawing. This dumb brick was completely missing my point.\u201cHow will you have the face to walk around after getting beaten up by a non-combat class?\u201dI\u2019m not worried for myself, but for you.\u201cSenia. Notarize the fact that I\u2019m a non-combat class.\u201dSenia showed herself, which drew a round of astonished murmurs.\u201cSo\u2026 beautiful.\u201d\u201cPlaying must be so amazing if you do it with that kind of Intermediate Administrator\u2026\u201dBoth Senia and Hyukjin ignored the trivial mutterings of the crowd. The stage was set, a stage where even an Intermediate Administrator had stepped in.Hyukjin continued, \u201cThis is definitely a proposal made by a Player to another Player, yes?\u201dAn Intermediate Administrator hadn\u2019t mediated it. Percy, the Streamer who had spat a ball of highly acidic green saliva, was likely streaming the scene in invisible mode. The fact that Percy hadn\u2019t appeared yet despite the situation having developed to this extent meant that an existence ranked higher than Percy was involved. Hyukjin was sure that existence was the Courageous Lion King.That was why it was necessary to make things very clear here.\u201cYes, that is correct. The results of my check show that Player Kim Taechun personally made a PVP request to Player Kim Hyukjin.\u201d\u201cThen that means this is a matter between humans unrelated to System-made scenarios.\u201dOnly then did Senia realize Hyukjin\u2019s intent.\u2018A matter between humans.\u2019Hyukjin\u2019s sentence precisely defined this fight as a matter unrelated to the System.[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 nods.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is having fun.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 observes.]They were now, to a certain degree, exempt from the System\u2019s rules.\u2018Player Kim Hyukjin has made a nominal pretext\u2026 to not act as an observer.\u2019It was decided with one sentence. Hyukjin would no longer move like an observer, but like a combat class Player taking on a PVP. He made it seem like he was talking to her, Senia, but his actual intent was clear and defined.\u2018The Nameless Observer said that they would observe.\u2019With that, all of Hyukjin\u2019s bases were covered. There wasn\u2019t a single hole in this tightly weaved scenario. Now, Hyukjin had the freedom to play out his own role in the scenario he himself crafted.[Accepting the PVP request.][A PVP Zone has been declared.]A space free of death, the PVP zone, was established. Kim Taechun smiled broadly.\u201cGood.\u201dHe was certain he could wreck Hyukjin. He was humiliated twice earlier, but thankfully, an opportunity to recover his face landed in his lap. He had finally grasped a good opportunity for him to prove his courage.\u201cHere I come.\u201dThe match began. Taechun took out his massive axe, the weapon that had made him stand out in the \u2018Hill of Blowing Wind\u2019.Hyukjin wasn\u2019t all that intimidated by that imposing weapon. He read Taechun\u2019s entire body with \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019, seeing everything with his eyes.\u2018His balance is passable.\u2019From the looks of it, Taechun would step with his right foot before approaching.\u2018He\u2019s underestimating me, so he\u2019ll make a direct approach.\u2019He would come close enough to put Hyukjin inside his range. Observer\u2019s Eye read every single one of Taechun\u2019s movements. It felt distinctly different from when he was observing Yeonseo or Yoohyun.\u2018It\u2019s like\u2026 watching a video in 0.5 speed.\u2019When he was reading Yeonseo or Yoohyun, a constant stream of information came in at real time, and he had to quickly derive new analyses. But it was different with Kim Taechun. It looked to Hyukjin that the hulking man was moving slowly to fulfill an already predetermined action.\u2018This is a new feeling.\u2019It was true that Taechun was lower level, but reading an average Player\u2019s movements felt so much easier after reading only top Players all this time. It felt enlightening, somehow.\u2018I can see it.\u2019He could see it precisely\u2014Taechun\u2019s fight pattern.Yeonseo watched the PVP closely.\u2018Let\u2019s focus. Simply watching Hyukjin move will be a big lesson for me.\u2019She had the feeling that something about Hyukjin\u2019s movements was odd. While Taechun was moving in, Hyukjin moved one small step to the right, far more slowly than normal.\u2018He should be able to instantly subdue the opponent if he used Flash Step.\u2019He wasn\u2019t using it on purpose, and she understood why.\u2018It would be idiotic to show off your skills in front of this many people.\u2019This was different from when he killed the \u2018Bigmouth Lizard\u2019 earlier. There was no need to expose all his abilities. Yeonseo had instinctively realized that showing 70% of one\u2019s abilities and hiding the remaining 30% was favorable for a Player.Whumpf\u2013!The large axe grazed past Hyukjin\u2019s forehead. Taechun swung his axe in quick succession.Whumpf\u2013!Whumpf\u2013!He attacked Hyukjin, his axe creating loud noises as it swung by, looking extremely threatening.\u201cKuhahahaha!\u201dTaechun felt a rush of exhilaration and triumph. His opponent was busy scrambling to dodge. He knew as well as anyone that his attack speed wasn\u2019t very fast. But the fact that he could attack to his heart\u2019s content like this meant that his opponent was just that slow.\u201cJust how long are you gonna keep running away?\u201dWhumpf\u2013!He kept swinging his axe. After making an opening, he would crush Hyukjin\u2019s head with a single downward swing. He was sure of his victory.\u2018This guy has a big mouth, but it looks like he\u2019ll be one hit KO\u2019d?\u2019Confidence bubbled up within him. Many of the Players watching the match were also unable to discern Hyukjin\u2019s movements.\u201cAs I thought\u2026 a non-combat class is different from a combat class, after all.\u201d\u201cHe was super confident, so I thought there would be something special about him, but nope.\u201d\u201cYeah, he\u2019s gonna get wrecked.\u201dBut among all the Players gathered here, some were outstandingly skilled. These Players, the top 10%, felt that something was weird.Jo Sunghyun was the same.\u2018There\u2019s something more to those movements.\u2019It was hard to explain in concrete terms, but something was strange. He could feel it through the wind. The wind that Hyukjin\u2019s movements created, the movement of the air, was extremely peaceful.\u2018Ah\u2014!\u2019When he focused, he realized it. His class was \u2018Child of Wind\u2019. He analyzed the information he got through the wind, the movement of the air.\u2018I get it.\u2019He understood why it felt so odd.\u2018Does this\u2026 make any sense?\u2019It shouldn\u2019t make any sense, but it was happening in front of his very eyes.\u2018Hyukjin hyung is dodging\u00a0before\u00a0Kim Taechun\u2019s attack?\u2019Hyukjin wasn\u2019t seeing the attack and then dodging. He was moving in advance to a position where he wouldn\u2019t get hit even before the attack started. He didn\u2019t move while Taechun was actually moving his axe.\u2018Almost like he already knows where the axe will go.\u2019He was like a speedrunner who had the game memorized, someone who knew exactly where and what kind of attack would occur. That was why he was able to dodge even without seeing the attack. There was no doubt about it. There was hardly any time delay\u2014unless you looked closely, you wouldn\u2019t notice it at all. But Jo Sunghyun could feel it keenly.\u201cHah, hah\u2026!\u201dAfter a furious flurry of attacks, Taechun gasped for breath, showing his failure to regulate his stamina. He looked like someone who had never once considered what it meant to pace himself.On the other side, Hyukjin briefly forgot he was fighting Taechun. His thoughts were focused wholly on the strange sensation he was experiencing. When fighting an opponent far weaker than himself, a function of \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 seemed to be kicking in. It felt like something was being sketched out in his head and fading away, over and over again.\u2018Like I can almost grasp it, but it\u2019s gone the next moment.\u2019He intentionally provoked Kim Taechun.\u201cTry attacking some more, why don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYou slimy little rat!\u201dHyukjin purposefully kept dodging Taechun\u2019s attacks. He read Taechun\u2019s fight pattern and the trajectory of his axe. Instead of doing it fully consciously, he partly entrusted that mysterious sense to his instincts. He entrusted his body to the flow.Almost like a person born with a god-given gift for battle.\u2018Ah\u2014!\u2019He had a flash of understanding.\u2018This.\u2019The hazy feeling that had been bothering him became a little more concrete.\u2018This is it.\u2019It was like a dam bursting and overflowing. At the same time, the notices came in.[You have become cognizant of a new enlightenment.][The grade of \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019 has increased.][You have reached a new stage.]The PVP match with Kim Taechun gave Hyukjin a completely unexpected \u2018new stage\u2019.\u2018A new stage\u2014!\u2019Hyukjin realized instinctively what that was.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86: Enlightenment (2)After reading that Eye of Perception had leveled up, I immediately checked the details.Type: Innate AbilityBasic acquisition conditions:Sixth SenseCalm Observer\u2019s EyeAdditional acquisition condition:Overcome the death sentence of \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019Overcome painDetailed explanation:Eye of Perception is an eye of \u2018intuition\u2019, meaning the user gains concrete knowledge about objects in the outer world through their sense of intuition. It allows the user to intuit and receive information about the target.Proficiency: [2]Traits:Distinguish between Awakened and Non-awakenedRead Status WindowsSense dangerResistance towards illusory attacks or apparition magicAdditional power:Future SightWith the increase in proficiency from [1] to [2], a new category, \u2018additional power\u2019, was added.\u2018Future Sight.\u2019I knew what it was without having to open up the detailed explanation. Just like the name suggested, it was the ability to see the future. I took a look at the detailed explanation anyway.[Future Sight]An eye that can glimpse the future. When PVPing or hunting, you can precisely predict the movements and attacks of the opponent or monster. However, be warned that a great deal of mental power and mana will be consumed in proportion to the opponent\u2019s abilities.I was already feeling the effects of the new ability. As expected of the cheat-level \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019, it produced an ability that could read an opponent\u2019s movements in advance.\u2018What I was sensing earlier\u2026\u2019This meant it wasn\u2019t just a vague feeling anymore, but a concrete skill I could use far more reliably and methodically.\u2018Let\u2019s try using it right away.\u2019There was a note that the consumption of mental power and mana would be enormous depending on the opponent\u2019s level. It shouldn\u2019t be very draining with Kim Taechun as my opponent, so it was worth taking for a spin. In all things, trying it out in practice was the best.[Activating the power Future Sight.][You are within \u2018Observer\u2019s Domain\u2019.][You are using \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019.][The mana and mental power consumption of Future Sight is reduced.]I saw a panting Kim Taechun.\u201cDieee!\u201dHe made a big swing of his axe.\u2018No.\u2019He hadn\u2019t swung yet. What I felt just now\u2026 was an \u2018illusion\u2019. In reality, Taechun hadn\u2019t swung his axe yet.\u2018This\u2026 is Future Sight.\u2019While I was awed, Taechun ran in exactly like I had seen him do moments earlier.\u2018When facing Taechun, I can see about one second in advance.\u2019An unprecedented ability to read what an opponent would do one second in advance. A vivid future that had a time delay but appeared before my eyes in perfect clarity like it didn\u2019t. A fight pattern that was even more definite and concrete than sensing it with my intuition.\u2018I do feel myself tiring.\u2019That had to be what it meant by the consumption of \u2018mental power\u2019 being high. I couldn\u2019t describe it exactly, but it kind of felt like I was losing steam, like my vigor was being eaten away. I could feel my body growing heavier, even though it wasn\u2019t actually that tired.\u2018As the proficiency of Eye of Perception rises, Future Sight should grow stronger, too.\u2019I couldn\u2019t expect too much from the beginning. This ability was one that would shine brighter the more my level increased and the more Eye of Perception leveled up.I dodged every attack from Kim Taechun with ease. That was enough testing, for now.[Stopping the use of the power Future Sight.]Taechun gasped for breath.\u201cHah\u2026! Hah\u2026!\u201dIn comparison, I wasn\u2019t all that tired. I felt like I\u2019d gone on a short walk\u2014I did feel a little tired and drained, but it wasn\u2019t severe.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you about my class?\u201dNon-combat class. Class name, Observer. There was no reason to state the name outright, but there was also no need to hide every little bit of my abilities. I wasn\u2019t planning on openly doing things at the forefront, but I also didn\u2019t intend on bending backwards to lower my value.\u201cI\u2019m a non-combat class.\u201d\u201cSHUT UP!\u201dKim Taechun swung his axe again, but I didn\u2019t even dodge this time, knowing it wouldn\u2019t reach me in the first place. His swing was full of power. It was no wonder that he ran out of strength so quickly.\u2018Well, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s fucking pissed. He hasn\u2019t been able to hit a non-combat class even once.\u2019How embarrassing must it be for a combat class Player to be helpless before a non-combat class Player in front of so many people?But it wasn\u2019t my business to worry about him. There was only one reason why I was saying this.\u2018Kim Kangchul and Song Jinchul. Listen up.\u2019It was to send a message to those two, as well as to the powers-that-be in Sungshin who still didn\u2019t get it and the Taeguk Shield guild members who were acting like they were the chosen ones, like nobles.\u201cThe foundation of my class is observation.\u201d\u201cI SAID TO SHUT UP!\u201dHe charged at me again, his movements slow and clumsy from exhaustion. I casually closed in on him. The distance between us was now mine to control.I chopped his wrist with the side of my hand.[Using the skill Excellent Strike.]Though I wasn\u2019t using a weapon, even my bare hand would deal a great amount of damage to Taechun.\u201cAhh!\u201d he yelped, dropping his axe.Thud!The large axe fell to the ground with a boom. Taechun clutched his wrist and pulled away a little. His foot lifted into the air in instinctive retreat, his balance crumbling a little.\u2018Is this how you do it?\u2019I immediately grabbed him and threw him over my back, mimicking the judo \u2018shoulder throw\u2019 I\u2019d glimpsed on Youtube before. It went unexpectedly well. I\u2019d never learned how to do it, but maybe reading Yoohyun\u2019s movements had helped.\u201cGugh!\u201dAs his back hit the ground, there was a resounding crash as loud as his heavy body. Struggling to right himself, he coughed painfully.\u201cMy class is fundamentally one that continuously observes.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a total lie. 70% was the truth, while 30% was a lie. That was the ratio I was aiming for, like countless Rankers in the future I came from. And now, I was going to resolve this situation my way.\u201cOne that, while continuously observing, plays an intermediary role to ensure that each Player\u2019s Playing joins smoothly into one fluid whole.\u201d\u201cCough! Cough!\u201d\u201cOne that, using the information gained by observing, directs the battlefield my party members and I are on to our favor and occasionally gives orders.\u201dWith this, the people at Sungshin and the Guardians alike would know what I was trying to say. But I still spelled it out a little more clearly, in a way that was slightly easier to understand.\u201cA class that draws out the efficiency of the party and maximizes each Player\u2019s latent potential to allow the raid or hunt to progress as optimally as possible.\u201dI intentionally made things a little more dramatic, taking my time to build up the climax. Because the people at Sungshin were watching, as well as the Guardians.\u201cMy class is\u00a0sovereign.\u201dA short and sweet personal r\u00e9sum\u00e9, effective and to the point.After the commotion that ensued, Kim Hyukjin and his party members left the Players Association building. As soon as they went out the front door, Choi Sung-gu reproduced the event that had just occurred, intentionally deepening his voice.\u201cMy class is sovereign,\u201d he mimicked, his face serious. And then, he marveled all by himself. \u201cKyaa, that was hella classy.\u201dHe clearly remembered the scene earlier. Somehow or another, when Hyukjin delivered the \u201cMy class is sovereign\u201d line, the room happened to be pinprick silent. And at least from what Sung-gu had seen, Hyukjin was absolutely compatible with a class called \u2018sovereign\u2019.Sung-gu continued to make a fuss. \u201cThis kind of thing\u2026 is a little chuunibyou, but hot damn, do I love it.\u201d He suddenly grabbed Hyukjin\u2019s hand. \u201cDayum. But great Sovereign, I have a question.\u201d\u201c...\u201dGrasping Hyukjin\u2019s hand with both hands, Sung-gu gazed at Hyukjin with eyes he probably thought were shining.\u201cWhat kind of sovereign lays out a combat Player with his bare hands?\u201d\u201c...\u201dFor a moment, Hyukjin pondered. If he chopped the back of this guy\u2019s neck with his hand, would he faint, or not? Perhaps sensing Hyukjin\u2019s murderous intent, Sung-gu quickly took a step back.\u201cBut seriously, though! I think even Yoohyun wouldn\u2019t have been able to move like that. Right?\u201dYeonseo, who had particularly remarkable talent for 1 vs. 1 PVP, offered her own analysis. \u201cMm, it\u2019s not cut and dry. Yoohyun obviously wins in pure physical ability and damage, but our boss Hyukjin was using observation to read Taechun\u2019s movements in advance and assume a far more favorable position. That\u2019s why he was able to dominate the guy so easily.\u201dHyukjin glanced sideways and saw Sunhwa grinning from ear to ear, looking very pleased. The sight of her smiling so brightly made him happy, too.\u201cWhy\u2019re you smiling like that?\u201d\u201cIt was super satisfying when you threw that guy, oppa. You went swoosh! And his body went whee! And crashed with a ba-bam! Totally serves him right.\u201d\u201cThat so?\u201dSunhwa nodded vigorously, fiercely agreeing. Smiling, Hyukjin walked a little more.\u201cBut oppa, you\u2019re walking slowly on purpose, right?\u201dThe rest of the party had noticed it as well, even Jo Sunghyun, who wasn\u2019t that close to Hyukjin yet.\u201cI am.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m waiting for something.\u201dYeonseo licked her lips. \u2018What\u2019s this feeling I\u2019m getting\u2026 that something fun is about to happen?\u2019It felt like fun things happened around Hyukjin. It was like that in their first gate together, when they went to Japan, and now.\u2018What could it be?\u2019She didn\u2019t ask, but she could feel it. Hyukjin wasn\u2019t at ease right now. From the way he moved and the look in his eyes, she could tell that right now, Hyukjin was preparing for battle.As if Yoohyun had also picked up on the strange atmosphere, he turned his head, his neck cracking. Hyukjin stopped in place and turned around.\u2018There\u2019s no way it would end like this.\u2019This was something that hadn\u2019t happened in the past. Kim Taechun wasn\u2019t reduced to such a sorry state, and he never PVPed with Hyukjin. But despite that, Hyukjin was able to read the future based on \u2018Guardian disposition\u2019 and \u2018Kim Taechun\u2019s personality\u2019. He had a rough idea of what was going to happen.\u2018With the Courageous Lion King\u2019s personality, he would never want things to end on such a bland note.\u2019Hyukjin didn\u2019t kill Taechun on purpose earlier. Even though the man would revive if killed since it was a PVP zone, Hyukjin stayed his hand intentionally. There was no real need to kill him, plus he figured it would stimulate the Courageous Lion King and Taechun even more.\u2018This makes a better stage.\u2019That was why he left him alive and left the building.What would the Courageous Lion King and Kim Taechun really choose to do?\u201cStop right there, you piece of trash! I won\u2019t be satisfied unless I fucking kill you!\u201dGiving off a different feel from before, Kim Taechun charged at Hyukjin, his eyes bright red. He was definitely not his normal self\u2014he almost looked like the Magic Troll in its \u2018berserker\u2019 state.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely kill you! Let\u2019s finish this!\u201dAnd then, Taechun let out a furious scream. Heat billowed out of his body.Grrrrrr.A strange growl came from his lips, and he looked every bit like an enraged bull. Not only that, but some shapes started materializing behind him.\u2018As I thought.\u2019Hyukjin\u2019s lips curled upwards.\u2018As I thought, this is how you want to do it.\u2019He had been waiting for this. The \u2018Ruler of the Plains\u2019 had finally made their move.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: Heroic DebutI intentionally left the building, knowing the Courageous Lion King and Kim Taechun wouldn\u2019t leave things at that. I wanted a more open space to fight a little more comfortably.\u2018So that the Ruler of the Plains can move a little more freely.\u2019There were a lot of Players on the 12th floor. An equally large number of Guardians were watching, and in the crowd were Players those Guardians valued. The \u2018Ruler of the Plains\u2019 didn\u2019t have the guts to cause an uproar in such a place.I remembered it very clearly.[The \u2018Ruler of the Plains\u2019 burns with hostility towards you.][The \u2018Ruler of the Plains\u2019 detests you.][The \u2018Ruler of the Plains\u2019 has reached the limit of their patience.]They sent a whopping three messages saying similar things in one go. It wasn\u2019t confirmed, but people believed that the number of similar messages a Guardian could send was limited to three. The Ruler of the Plains went all the way to the limit to warn me.\u2018They were waiting for their chance.\u2019And so, I gave them that\u00a0 \u2018chance\u2019.\u2018The Courageous Lion King was also eyeing a chance to make Taechun and me fight again. Me being down here is perfect for that.\u2019I knew the Ruler of the Plains would throw a fit at some point. And I knew that when that happened, the Courageous Lion King would also join in, exactly like I planned.\u2018I told you, I\u2019ll set the stage.\u2019Rather than the \u2018Ruler of the Plains\u2019 causing an uproar alone, it was better for the \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 to join the fray. The two of them probably had an agreement to act against me right now.The berserk Taechun made a strange growling noise from his throat.\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 kill\u2026 you\u2026!\u201dBehind him, chimera monsters were baring their fangs like they wanted to charge at us right away.Orcanthrope LVL 32They were fusions of Orcs and Lycanthropes. Basically, chimeras. There were six of them.\u2018They sure made a lot of them.\u2019They probably made as many as their Guardian abilities or the System-prescribed limits allowed.\u2018It must have cost an enormous amount to make that many.\u2019Overall, the monsters looked similar to Lycanthropes, but they had misshapen green skin instead of wolf fur. They were also using weapons like clubs or spears, like Orcs.\u2018They\u2019re fundamentally stronger than Lycanthropes.\u2019They had no weakness of being enfeebled by water. They were also physically strong and belonged to a race categorized as Orc level or higher. Naturally, modern weapons wouldn\u2019t work against them.Yeonseo drew her sword.\u201cBoss. This\u2026 looks a bit dangerous. They\u2019re all level 32, and the energy they\u2019re giving off is no joke. And what\u2019s with Kim Taechun? He\u2019s acting like he\u2019s gone mad all of a sudden.\u201dEven without my orders, my party members fell into position on their own accord. To my amusement, Sunghyun and Sung-gu were standing with their backs to each other, taking the optimal position to synergize. In order to protect the two magicians, Sunhwa was holding a large shield next to them, and Yoohyun stood next to me, readying his mana.\u201cHyungnim,\u201d he said to me. \u201cHow come they\u2019re not attacking Taechun?\u201d\u201cBecause Taechun is no different from a monster right now.\u201dTo be more precise, the monsters recognized him as a monster. The Guardians surely had a hand in it.\u201cListen up. Those guys are faster than Lycanthropes.\u201d My words implied that no one other than me or Yeonseo could overpower the Orcanthropes. \u201cTheir characteristics have changed a lot, so I don\u2019t think the weakness of Lycanthropes will apply, and it\u2019s also impossible to fight them like when we fought the Great Orc Warrior.\u201dIn other words\u2014\u201cIf we fight them head-on, we\u2019ll take significant damage.\u201dIf we were unlucky, someone could even die.\u201cFuck. Should I just burn them to a crisp then? Want me to show you the Jayangdong Firemaster?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t being serious. Sung-gu knew that throwing out a big attack would pull the aggro to him. The moment that happened, there was a 99% chance the magician class Sung-gu would die.\u2018Mettle probably won\u2019t work right now.\u2019I said one more thing to my party members.\u201cFor now, stay put while drawing as little aggro as possible. The police and other Players will come to support us.\u201dIf my prediction was correct, the people upstairs should already have seen this coming, and someone would eventually come down. That \u2018someone\u2019 would very likely be the Taeguk Shield guild members.Taeguk Shield coming down didn\u2019t necessarily mean that a new path opened up for me. It simply meant that the police and reporters would take action as well.Sungshin might only be a corporation, but I was sure the government would act. Even if they didn\u2019t bring fighter jets and tanks, they would at least send special forces armed with automatic weapons, and quickly. Naturally, reporters would also rush over to provide coverage.\u2018To make a flashy debut, Taeguk Shield will intentionally take their time coming down.\u2019But the Ruler of the Plains also wanted to drag things out, because they wanted to see me shrivel in fear. So in essence, the two parties had the same intent.\u2018In that case, the picture is clear.\u2019The Orcanthropes weren\u2019t attacking us right away. They were simply giving off a threatening aura. The Courageous Lion King, who was getting a share of the action instigated by the Ruler of the Plains, was also waiting.\u201cThey won\u2019t attack us right away. Stay on the ready. In a little while, they\u2019ll fight with the police. The government might even send special forces here.\u201dThe special forces would definitely start attacking the monsters, and there was a very high chance they\u2019d act overbearing with us, like Sungshin had done upstairs. Why? Because they had to dampen our spirits.\u201cThere\u2019s a high chance they\u2019ll act overbearing with us, but don\u2019t respond and just stay put. We won\u2019t be killing the mobs this time.\u201dI had already leveled a veiled declaration of war against Sungshin. Not only did I basically threaten the youngest grandson of Sungshin\u2019s president, but I also confidently declared that I would raise my value with my own two hands. In order to control me and the other Players, Sungshin would want to show their strength by moving government forces and saving our lives to get us indebted to them.Yeonseo asked, \u201cBoss Hyukjin, what do we need to do?\u201d\u201cMake sure the aggro doesn\u2019t go to the civilians. Taeguk Shield will hunt the monsters.\u201d\u201cWill Taeguk Shield really go in and hunt them?\u201d\u201cI have to make them.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t boost the casualties, will it?\u201d\u201cTrust me. Today, those guys will be hunted without any losses on our side.\u201dWas I just imagining it, or did Yeonseo\u2019s cheeks redden a little?\u201cO-Okay. I will trust you.\u201dFor some reason, she seemed to be awfully polite all of a sudden. Just then, I heard another growl. Kim Taechun was exuding an aura no inferior to the growling Orcanthropes. And then came the loud sounds of sirens.\u201cHuh? Like Boss said, the police really are coming.\u201dBe it police or special forces, it was useless.\u2018They can\u2019t be killed with modern weapons.\u2019There was just no way. From Orcs onwards, modern weapons were useless.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is observing you.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is delighted by your scheme.][The \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 has pinpointed exactly what your intent is.]The incomprehensible \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 and extremely quick-witted \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 seemed to know what kind of situation this was. Right now, the stage was set and the action was waiting for the right moment to begin. The two Guardians were greatly enjoying the show I had crafted with the Guardians\u2019 dispositions, Kim Taechun\u2019s personality, and all the other elements in mind.\u201cThis is the police!\u201dPolice cars pulled up, and the sound of helicopter blades came from above.The police and special forces streamed out of their cars. As if to show off their strength, they spoke to us in a commanding tone. \u201cWe will kill the monsters!\u201dIn the meantime, the Taeguk Shield guild members also came down. Their timing was absolutely impeccable, like they had measured it with a ruler.To start, I gave a warning.\u201cI am a Player with a special class. It\u2019s dangerous here. Modern weap\u2014\u201dI wasn\u2019t able to continue. A policeman wearing a black special forces uniform gestured me into silence. \u201cWe will handle it. Civilians, for your own safety, please get far away.\u201d\u2018Get far away\u2019 was the nice version of what was really \u2018fuck off\u2019. That was the true message written in every part of his expression and tone. They seemed to have a lot of faith in their abilities.\u2018Maybe\u2026 I stopped too many dungeon breaks.\u2019Actually, Orcs\u00a0should\u00a0have already appeared in the real world. They\u00a0should\u00a0have caused a lot of damage. But because I prevented that from happening, these guys had no clue about the \u2018shields\u2019 monsters of a certain level possessed.A person who looked like a commanding officer said sternly, \u201cIf you do not cooperate, we will use force to temporarily detain you.\u201dThey looked ready to use their guns if we didn\u2019t comply. I raised both hands behind my head and gave them one last piece of advice. This was all I could do.\u201cYour weapons won\u2019t work against them. You need the strength of Players.\u201d\u201cWe will be the judge of that. Back off.\u201d\u201cThey have a shield that modern weapons don\u2019t work against.\u201d\u201cI said to\u00a0back off.\u201dI had given as much warning as I could. I took a few steps backwards. Seemingly pleased by my submissive attitude, the man spoke into his radio.\u2013Fire on my signal.Reporters also rushed in to broadcast the situation. With them, every piece was present.The Courageous Lion King and Ruler of the Plains, working together. The Brown Bear Kim Taechun being controlled by them. Taeguk Shield, who wanted to become heroes. The police, who had most likely received commands from Sungshin\u2019s upper management. And finally, the reporters who were here to show the world what was happening.The picture I\u2019d told Senia about when we whispered earlier was fitting into place exactly as I\u2019d envisioned it. Taeguk Shield would come under my command. And through it, I would obtain every benefit there was to obtain. After a few more steps, that was well within the realm of possibility.Without standing in the fore, I would be able to secure a share of Sungshin\u2019s mighty support.\u2018Taeguk Shield. You want to have a flashy debut, right?\u2019Song Kiyeol\u2019s future path would change depending on how he developed Taeguk Shield. It would determine whether he would inherit Sungshin or not. After all, Taeguk Shield was essentially hand in hand with the new tech business.\u2018But he can\u2019t do it alone.\u2019The guildmaster of Taeguk Shield, Song Kiyeol, didn\u2019t realize that modern weapons wouldn\u2019t work on the Orcanthropes. From the very start, his plan to suppress the monsters with modern weapons and then have the guild make a flashy debut in front of the reporters was flawed.\u2018But\u2014\u2019It was still possible if I helped, using a Playing method that was mine alone. At least in this moment, right now, only I could pull it off.The Ruler of the Plains was incensed by the fact I wasn\u2019t showing a hint of fear, even after so much intimidation.[The \u2018Ruler of the Plains\u2019 withdraws the final chance they gave you.]Final chance? Apparently, they\u2019d wanted to see me sniveling and begging for mercy. They still thought this stage was under their control.[The \u2018Ruler of the Plains\u2019 bears very intense hostility towards you.]If I could have sent a message, I would have told them that I felt exactly the same way, and that we would see who would come out on top.With that notice, the chimera monsters, the Orcanthropes, began to move.\u2018It\u2026 has begun.\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: Heroic Debut (2)Taeguk Shield\u2019s plan went awry as soon as they counted on the policemen being able to suppress the monsters. There would be no beautiful conclusion like Taeguk Shield\u2019s guild members going in to mop up the monsters after they were first quelled with modern weapons.\u201cAHHHH!\u201dOne of the policemen firing his pistol behind the barrier of his police car door was ripped apart lengthwise.Shaaa!Blood fountained out, turning the police car that was protecting the man just moments ago bright red, almost like someone had thrown several cans of red paint onto the vehicle.There was a moment of stunned silence.\u201c...\u201dThe Orcanthropes growling as they exhaled hot breaths were perfectly at ease. It seemed they had come to the conclusion that they were the strongest beings here. They prowled with leisure, filling their prey with fear, savoring the thrill. Kim Taechun simply huffed and puffed in place, probably on orders from the Courageous Lion King. Even without moving, he cut quite an intimidating picture. He was definitely not in his right mind.\u2018I warned you.\u2019I warned them, but they didn\u2019t listen. A life was lost right in front of me. Could I have saved that policeman if I had moved more proactively? The answer was \u2018no\u2019.\u2018I would have been arrested before I could save him.\u2019The agitated policemen might have even fired at me with their guns. They wouldn\u2019t listen to me anyway. Humans would only believe what they saw and heard with their own eyes and ears.Whap whap whap whap whap!A large shadow\u2014a helicopter\u2014passed over my head. I saw a sniper aiming at the monsters in the helicopter. We were in the heart of downtown Seoul, and there were a lot of people nearby. They weren\u2019t able to use heavy weapons capable of intense firepower, so sniping was the best option.\u2018Like I said, it\u2019s no use.\u2019Even if they came with machine guns instead of sniper rifles, they wouldn\u2019t be able to do a thing to monsters above Orc level.The head honcho of Taeguk Shield, Song Kiyeol, was also unable to stay completely calm right now.State: Slightly Flustered / Cautious/ Vigilant\u2018So sorry you couldn\u2019t make a cool entrance and finish off the mobs,\u2019 I thought to myself. Turning to my party members, I said, \u201cNobody move.\u201dThe policemen had completely pulled the aggro. The crack of bullets being fired was still ringing out, but they should know by now that modern weapons were ineffective. It wasn\u2019t even that they were doing chip damage, but that their bullets were being nullified altogether.\u201cIf anyone does end up drawing aggro, Sunhwa, you go to the front and defend. Shout loudly to get my attention.\u201dThere was no such thing as 100% perfect. The policemen armed with personal weapons were currently drawing all the aggro, but it could bounce to the Players at any moment. I told them what to do if that happened.Sunhwa tilted her head. \u201cI should shout?\u201dThat would draw even more aggro, and potentially capture the attention of other monsters. Her worries weren\u2019t unfounded. It was reasonable that she would question it.\u201cYeah. Don\u2019t worry and shout loud enough to let me know.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dThe perceptive Sunhwa immediately bobbed her head, and I began to slowly walk forward. Someone yelled at me.\u201cHey! I told you not to move!\u201dIt was the man who looked like the commander here, the same one who had told us to stay put earlier. He didn\u2019t have a name badge on, but I could see what his name was.Name: Park Jiseok\u201cMr. Park Jiseok. If this continues, it will be a slaughter. I have business with the guildmaster of Taeguk Shield, Song Kiyeol, over there.\u201d\u201c...\u201dI intentionally mentioned Song Kiyeol. Even if the commander didn\u2019t know \u2018Kim Hyukjin\u2019, he certainly knew \u2018Song Kiyeol\u2019, the person who should have originally been this stage\u2019s main character. Song Kiyeol, a 3rd generation chaebol scion and the guildmaster of Taeguk Shield. He was probably wracking his brains to figure out how to resolve this situation, and it went without being said that he must have seen me walking his way.A message came over the comm.\u2013Guildmaster Song Kiyeol says he would like a brief meeting.I shrugged, then walked slowly towards Song Kiyeol, taking the utmost care not to draw any aggro.\u2018That was the highest level of respect on comm just now.\u2019Song Kiyeol was just the guildmaster of \u2018Taeguk Shield\u2019, a guild that wasn\u2019t even that famous yet. Right now, he was merely a 3rd generation chaebol. And yet, the policeman stepped aside simply because Song Kiyeol wanted to see me.\u2018Sungshin really is powerful.\u2019Well, it was all the same to me. Actually, the more powerful Sungshin was, the better it was for me, since I would be able to get that much more.While I was inching forward, the second victim occurred. A ripped off arm arced through the air, rotating before landing onto the ground with a wet thud. Red blood puddled around it.\u2013Reinforcements! Requesting reinforcements!\u2013We have two casualties! The situation is critical!I also heard the policemen urgently requesting reinforcements. And then, I finally made it to Song Kiyeol. He hadn\u2019t managed to take a position among the \u20188 Heroes\u2019, but he was still one of the Players who represented Korea, not by virtue of his personal power or skill, but by his leadership of Korea\u2019s strongest guild, \u2018Taeguk Shield\u2019. He was also known as being relatively righteous for a 3rd generation chaebol heir.\u201cMany people are watching, so it looks like you can\u2019t stay out of it, Guildmaster Song Kiyeol.\u201dAll of the reporters had their cameras pointed at this scene. The stage had been set so that Taeguk Shield could no longer keep out of it, no matter how pyrrhic the battle would be. Of course, that stage had been set by me.\u201cIt seems you have something to say to me,\u201d Song Kiyeol said.\u201cI gave a warning in advance. I said that modern weapons won\u2019t work on those monsters. The policemen didn\u2019t listen or believe me. They rushed in for the sake of someone\u2019s glorious entrance.\u201d\u201cAre you picking a fight with me?\u201d\u201cI am not, nor do I have any reason to do so.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t my intent to make Song Kiyoung falter. I would turn him into the hero of this place. For all I cared, he could wear the hero cape.\u00a0I\u00a0would secure the actual profit.\u201cGAAAHHH!\u201dAnother person screamed.AWOOOOO\u2013!One of the Orcanthropes howled, which got the rest of the Orc-Lycanthrope hybrids sitting on their haunches to howl at the sky.Awooooooo\u2013!Awooooooo\u2013!Their howl seemed to sweep through the city like an emergency siren, a funeral dirge for the bloodied humans collapsed all over the place. The sound was extremely grating on the ears.\u201cThe longer this goes on, the more casualties there will be. There\u2019s no knowing where the aggro will go next.\u201dThe police were still attacking, and the special forces were still firing, but soon, they too would hesitate. As soon as that happened, there was no knowing who those monsters would attack next. They might even run out and attack the countless civilians in the vicinity.\u2018I won\u2019t let that happen.\u2019Once I secured the maximum profit for myself, I would prevent as many deaths as possible. That was my Playing method.[The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 is watching gleefully.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is observing.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is disappointed in you.]Even if the Lady of the Scales was disappointed in me, it wasn\u2019t the time for me to jump in. If I were to run into that battlefield where it was hailing bullets, my life would be the first to go. Bullets didn\u2019t have eyes to distinguish between friend and foe.\u201cI will get to the point. I intend on making Guildmaster Song Kiyeol into a hero.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cIf you minimize the losses here and successfully kill those monsters, you can become a hero. Along with Taeguk Shield.\u201dThat was your guys\u2019 original plan, wasn\u2019t it? That was the debut Taeguk Shield wanted.\u00a0Although I didn\u2019t say it out loud, Song Kiyeol understood my words.\u201cHowever, all items and byproducts that come from the hunt will go to me and my party members.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cOh, right. Starting now, I will record this conversation. I need a little assurance as well.\u201dI could feel Song Kiyeol\u2019s psychological state.State: Doubt / Distrust / SuspicionWell, that was only natural. He didn\u2019t know much about me.\u201cUsing my special ability, I can put the monsters into a groggy state, a condition where a severe impact makes them stagger around, unable to steady themselves. It will last about five minutes. That should be more than enough time for you to hunt them with us.\u201d I added one more thing. \u201cIf you\u2019re unable to kill them even while they\u2019re groggy\u2026 It just means that Taeguk Shield\u2019s abilities are too weak. Their weak points are the back of the neck, heart, forehead, temples. They have relatively weak defense at every spot that can be considered a weak point.\u201d\u201cYou speak almost as if you have faced them yourself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m well-informed about those monsters.\u201dI shrugged. Song Kiyeol stared at me.[Eye of Perception detects a foreign energy.][Eye of Perception detects the use of the innate ability \u2018Eye of Truth\u2019.]Was this kind of talent hereditary? President Song Kiyoung awakened an innate ability at only level 10, and his grandson, Song Kiyeol, already had an innate ability too. Seeing as how both Yoohyun and Yeonseo also had them, the \u2018innate ability awakening period for geniuses\u2019 must be much sooner than the world thought.[The grade of the innate ability Eye of Perception is higher than the grade of Eye of Truth.][Eye of Perception completely negates the ability Eye of Truth.]I grinned, smiling widely on purpose.\u201cI distinctly recall saying that I had a special power.\u201d I lowered my voice a little, wanting to surprise him a little more. \u201cSomething like Eye of Truth is incapable of seeing through me.\u201d\u201c...\u201dState: Shock / Flustered / DoubtEye of Perception was laying his state bare before me, but the Guildmaster\u2019s expression was an unperturbed poker face. He was really damn good at keeping his expressions off his face.\u201cYou can say this to the reporters: Watch Taeguk Shield\u2019s hunt.\u201dMonsters that were invulnerable to modern weapons, and the heroes who would kill them. The guild members of Taeguk Shield would become those heroes.\u201cWe will work to keep the aggro from going to the civilians.\u201d\u201cAre you sure they will suffer the groggy state?\u201d\u201cEven if you don\u2019t believe me, do you have any other option?\u201dDragging this out any further was meaningless. There were definitely times when a leader had to make a quick decision. Right now was one of those times.\u201cAlso, I propose $100k as compensation.\u201d$100k. It was neither too small nor too large an amount to pay to achieve what Taeguk Shield wanted. In my opinion, it was the perfect amount.\u201c...You\u2019re very confident. You seem to be sure that I will accept your proposal.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure of it, yes.\u201dHe had no choice but to accept. We could run away here, and that would be that. Who would throw sticks and stones at us for running so we could live? But Taeguk Shield was different. They had the name of \u2018Sungshin\u2019 attached to them and were Korea\u2019s largest guild. If they fled here, they would suffer an irrecoverable blow.\u2018Of course he will accept.\u2019My proposal wasn\u2019t terrible for Taeguk Shield. In the end, Song Kiyeol made his decision.\u201cHow will you turn us into\u2026\u201d He stopped mid-sentence. \u201cNo. There are many things I am curious about, but I will trouble you to answer my questions later.\u201dI knew there were many unresolved doubts in his head. However, the situation was too urgent. Five people had already died. Song Kiyeol was well aware that it wasn\u2019t the time to be chatting around like this.\u201cI will answer your questions one by one later.\u201dFrom talking to Song Kiyeol, I became sure of it. I might not be able to control President Song Kiyoung, but I could certainly keep his grandson Song Kiyeol in the palm of my hand. Everything was going as I predicted.\u2018If my prediction and scenario are correct, then the next place we\u2019ll meet will be the police station, huh?\u2019The scenario was steadily progressing the way I had drafted it. I would be able to bring Taeguk Shield under me like I intended.I added one more thing.\u201cOh, right. You know that I am not alone, yes?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt will be $100k per person. Since we will move as a party.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like that, then it can\u2019t be helped.\u201dSong Kiyeol would definitely accept. To him, a few hundred thousand dollars wasn\u2019t all that important right now, something I knew well. I counted down in my heart.\u2018Three. Two. One.\u2019Sure enough\u2014\u201cFine. You\u2026 must put them in a groggy state, without fail.\u201d He didn\u2019t look very happy. \u201cIf you fail to do so, I will take it as you deceiving and insulting me.\u201dHe was biting his lip a little, but to be honest, it was more cute than threatening, kind of like an elementary school kid being surly with an adult.\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dI got what I wanted, so now, it was time to do what he wanted.\u2018Normally, they wouldn\u2019t be capable of killing Orcanthropes.\u2019If they had clashed straight-on with this many Orcanthropes, I would have decided without hesitation to flee. That was the way to ensure that as many of my party members would survive as possible. But it was different now. Now, I had a way forward.\u2018Now then. Shall we hunt?\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89: Heroic Debut (3)I temporarily made a party with the Taeguk Shield guild members. Everything was ready.With our strength, killing those Orcanthropes without taking any losses was nearly impossible. On top of that, there was Kim Taechun. We couldn\u2019t just shoot him to death, since he was still a human. Though it was unclear why he was just standing there without attacking anyone, he would definitely start moving once we did. If we just fought him straight-on, we would lose more than we would gain.\u2018However\u2014\u2019The current me was different. I took out an item.[High Orc\u2019s Spell Scroll]The High Orc reigns as the upper-ranking predator of the Orc race. This scroll is imbued with the abilities of a High Orc with a special bloodline that sets it apart even from other High Orcs. This item will have an outstanding effect on Orcs, and one of four possible abilities can be used.Remaining uses: 1Affects: OrcsSpell of Super StrengthSpell of IllusionSpell of InfatuationSpell of SubmissionI could pick one of four spells to use. The High Orc\u2019s Spell Scroll was a gift the \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 secretly gave me, having already predicted this situation.\u2018From this alone\u2026 you can tell that the Whispering Devil is a Guardian with greater power and ability than the Ruler of the Plains.\u2019A Guardian who was almost always in the five limited slots for sending notices, and the item he sent me. This was the item I had relied on to draw out the current situation.What caught my eye was the \u2018Spell of Submission\u2019.[Spell of Submission]Using the powerful authority of the High Orc, invokes the power of forced submission on all Orcs lower in rank than the High Orc.It was time to finish up the picture I had drawn based on this item.[Using the High Orc\u2019s Spell Scroll.][Use the Spell of Submission?]I lifted the scroll into the air, knowing that at least the Guardians would be watching me. Then, I intentionally uttered the incantation in a very quiet voice that was still loud enough to be streamed to the Guardians.\u201cSpell of Submission.\u201dA powerful gravitational wave pulsed out. It wasn\u2019t visible to the eye, but my Observer\u2019s Eye showed me exactly how this spell unfurled. Countless invisible \u2018vertical lines\u2019 slammed down on the bodies of the Orcanthropes.Thud!One of the Orcanthropes fell to its knees, whimpering like an already defeated puppy.\u2018Some of them are resisting it.\u2019Some were resisting the Spell of Submission with growls, most likely because they weren\u2019t completely Orcs, but Orc-Lycanthrope hybrids.\u2018But even so\u2026\u2019I was sure of it.\u2018None of them can escape the High Orc spell\u2019s influence.\u2019At most, they could only resist it, and only for a brief moment. Maybe a Great Orc Warrior-Lycanthrope hybrid might be capable of shaking off the spell, but these were regular Orcs fused with regular Lycanthropes. These early level 30 monsters could never hope to be free of this power of \u2018forced submission\u2019.\u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2026 can see it.\u2019The countless vertically-descending black lines only I could see were hard to put a name on. A gravitational wave? No, it felt subtly different.\u2018Can I just see it as a wave imbued with some kind of powerful force that makes them kneel?\u2019I wasn\u2019t able to analyze the true nature of this power. While I was contemplating, the guild members of Taeguk Shield began to take action, slashing and piercing the kneeling or collapsed Orcanthropes at random.\u2018The spell has fully taken effect.\u2019Now, Taeguk Shield could just mop them up. I watched from the side, keeping Observer\u2019s Eye and Observer\u2019s Domain active.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 respects your stance.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 feels a little regretful.]Apparently, this wasn\u2019t the picture the Whispering Devil had wanted. He probably wanted me to do something like personally go out and slaughter the monsters or make some kind of big scene.[EXP acquired.][EXP acquired.]The EXP was building up without me lifting a finger. Right now, I was in the level 30 period that was called the Hell Phase, so my level didn\u2019t go up, but I was still getting pretty good EXP.In the meantime, many reporters filmed Taeguk Shield\u2019s performance.\u2018By tomorrow, Taeguk Shield will have become heroes.\u2019Taeguk Shield, the guild that defeated the incredibly strong monsters that even the military and police couldn\u2019t subdue!\u00a0Articles of that nature would plaster the front pages.\u2018As for Kim Taechun\u2026\u2019I was amazed to see that he was still not moving. Was it simply because of a quest? He wasn\u2019t an Orc, so he shouldn\u2019t be affected by the High Orc\u2019s Spell Scroll. Why was he just standing there?\u2018Wait.\u2019It felt off. I thought back to the black lines that had appeared by the power of the High Orc\u2019s Spell Scroll.\u2018Those lines\u2026\u2019They had evaded Kim Taechun in a strange way, almost like there was a round barrier or something around his body.\u2018No, that\u2019s not it. He didn\u2019t just block them.\u2019It was something far more intrinsic than that. He didn\u2019t just block the black lines\u2014they weren\u2019t able to approach him altogether. They were\u00a0extinguished.The scroll imbued with the High Orc\u2019s power registered on everyone here. It was just that the actual effect only triggered on Orcs. The \u2018effect\u2019 didn\u2019t show up on regular humans, but the spell\u00a0did\u00a0affect them. Which meant\u2026 those black lines affected everyone here in the same way.\u2018But\u2026\u2019Kim Taechun was different. That power wasn\u2019t able to approach him altogether.\u2018A power higher in grade than the High Orc\u2019s power\u2026\u2019Upon closer inspection, I saw a shimmer around Kim Taechun\u2019s body, like his body was giving off some kind of heat. Something was weird about it.[Eye of Perception perceives a strange energy.]At the same time, I unknowingly groaned in pain.\u201cGugh!\u201dI clutched my right eye as it throbbed in extreme agony. There was blood on my palm and it flowed from my eye and dripped through my fingers.\u2018It can\u2019t be.\u2019I thought I could guess what this phenomenon might be.\u2018Come to think of it\u2026\u2019I didn\u2019t hear any notices from the Courageous Lion King, who was deeply involved in the current situation. If he knew I was hatching this kind of scheme, he would have definitely sent messages like \u2018The Courageous Lion King is sneering\u2019 or \u2018The Courageous Lion King snorts at your cowardice\u2019.\u2018He\u2019s so occupied with something that he can\u2019t pay attention to me.\u2019Then there could only be one answer.\u2018It can\u2019t be.\u2019But that answer made no sense. We were only in the early game.\u00a0That, in the early game? And from a Guardian like the Courageous Lion King, a pretty famous Guardian in his own right?\u2018Descent\u2026?\u2019Descent.In the dictionary, it meant a god coming down from the heavens to the human world.Occasionally, some Guardians would invoke a \u2018descent\u2019. It put an incredible burden on the Player\u2019s body, and there was no knowing what kind of side effects they would have afterwards. There were even cases where Players exploded, unable to bear the Guardian\u2019s authority and power.\u2018That fucking crazy courage-lover.\u2019He was borrowing Kim Taechun\u2019s body to try and invoke the power of \u2018descent\u2019. It went without being said that the current Taechun wasn\u2019t capable of safely shouldering a descent.\u2018Though I don\u2019t know how much power he\u2019s putting into this descent\u2026\u2019I wasn\u2019t clear on what kinds of descents there were, either. Even ten years from now, not much was known about it.\u2018In any case, Kim Taechun\u2019s done for.\u2019The Courageous Lion King might be a courage-addled addict, but he wasn\u2019t a complete idiot. I was sure he would use the perfect amount of force to have a fierce battle with me. After the fierce battle\u2014basically, once the courage-lover was done with his tool\u2014Kim Taechun would die.\u2018It might be dangerous for me, too.\u2019The situation was urgent. This was no time for me to be watching idly from the side.[Using the special skill Flash Step.]I closed in immediately, not stopping to think about the particulars. I took up position behind Taechun, who was still defenseless. There was no time to contemplate. My eyes flitted to the back of his neck, which I grabbed in a hasty choke. I squeezed his neck with all the strength I had, crouching down. From a 3rd party\u2019s perspective, I must have looked like a cicada clinging to a tree.I didn\u2019t know how much time passed like that, maybe a few seconds. It was just that urgent.Thud!Kim Taechun\u2019s body slumped to the ground. The strange sensation surrounding him, the shimmering aura I had felt through Observer\u2019s Eye, disappeared. What would be a good way to describe it? God energy, maybe?[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 continues observing.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 is impressed by your quick judgment.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 denounces the \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019.]Seeing as our just Lady was publicly denouncing him, it seemed the courage-lover really\u00a0was\u00a0trying to invoke \u2018descent\u2019.\u2018He\u2019s well and properly nuts, trying to pull a descent on a beginner Player\u2019s body.\u2019But if you considered it another way\u2014\u2018It also means\u2026 that I\u2019ve stimulated him so intensely that he couldn\u2019t resist the overwhelming itch.\u2019That was another possible interpretation. I had given him so much stimulus and fun that the courage-lover charged straight in, consequences be damned. So much fun that he completely flipped his lid.\u2018Nice.\u2019Of course, this incident would become famous among the Guardians, and that would definitely work out in my favor.Having already finished off the Orcanthropes, Song Kiyeol approached me, eyeing the unconscious Kim Taechun.\u201cWe\u2019re nearly finished here. Did you PVP just now?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s settle the payment next time,\u201d I responded. \u201cI\u2019m a little busy right now. I will answer your questions soon.\u201dThat would probably happen at the place I was predicting, the police station.\u2018For now, we\u2019ll get out of here.\u2019In order to bring the picture I\u2019d been drawing to its completion, it was best to step aside for now. Taeguk Shield would take care of the rest.\u201cWe will soon meet again.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure how soon, but if my guess was correct, it would be very soon. However, I continued talking like I didn\u2019t know. \u201cI think it would be best for me to step aside so you can sort things out over here.\u201dAs if he had wanted that in the first place, Song Kiyeol nodded immediately. \u201cUnderstood. I will get in contact with you.\u201d* *\u00a0*I quickly left the place that had come within an inch of becoming the site of a Guardian descent. No matter how I thought about it, the Courageous Lion King was seriously insane, considering he tried to use a descent that even high-level Players had a hard time handling.\u201cLet\u2019s call it quits for the day,\u201d I told my party members.This was enough for today\u2019s Playing. Too much had happened in one go. I was also very tired from my continuous use of Eye of Perception and Observer\u2019s Eye. Both my ability to concentrate and my stamina were exhausted.\u201cOppa\u2026 are you alright?\u201d\u201cBoss Hyukjin! Is your eye alright? Who did that to you?!\u201d\u201cHyungnim!\u201d\u201cHyung\u2026 are you alright?\u201d\u201cGoddammit. Just tell me who it was, and I\u2019ll burn \u2018em down.\u201dI calmed down my overreacting party members. An injury of this level would go away with a cure potion.\u201cGet some rest. I\u2019ll contact you soon, so see you then.\u201dEveryone seemed tired.Yeonseo said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I want to ask our Boss Hyukjin\u2026\u201d She still looked worried. \u201cBut I\u2019ll ask you later. Boss Hyukjin, take care of yourself. Get well soon. When your eye\u2019s better, let\u2019s go get a meal together.\u201dHer use of the possessive when referring to me slightly bothered me somehow, but I didn\u2019t comment on it and watched as she waved goodbye. Yoohyun and Sung-gu also left, leaving just me, Sunhwa, and Sunghyun.\u201cSunhwa and I are gonna go by taxi.\u201d\u201cAlright, hyung. My house happens to be in the same direction.\u201dSunhwa was so tired that she was dozing off on her feet. Her sense of tension had left her, leaving her deflated. This little sister of mine had a real talent for sleeping on her feet.My bleeding eye was throbbing, but it didn\u2019t bother me too much. I glanced at Sunghyun.\u2018Mm.\u2019He certainly had something to say to me. He was probably still debating whether he should say it or not. I decided to wait for him, since it wasn\u2019t a pressing issue.The taxi came. The moment Sunhwa and I were about to get in, Sunghyun spoke up.\u201cHyung. I have something to tell you.\u201dAfter apologizing to the taxi driver, I closed the car door and turned around to face Sunghyun.\u201cI was waiting.\u201d\u201c...What?\u201dIn the beginning, when we came down to the 1st floor and left the building and I was walking slowly, I said,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m waiting for something.\u201dWhat I had been waiting for wasn\u2019t the Orcanthropes or my plan involving Taeguk Shield. I had been waiting for Jo Sunghyun to speak up.\u201c...\u201dHe blinked, staring at me. Then, he said, \u201cSo you were saying that about me.\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cIf I am not mistaken, it seems you already know what I am about to say.\u201dOf course I did. I just didn\u2019t know if he was going to bring it up today, or later. I gave him a light nod, looking at him. Judging from his inability to hide his shocked expression, he seemed pretty darn surprised.\u201cWant me to guess what you\u2019re going to say?\u201dYou\u2019re ten years too young to get the jump on me, kid.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90\u201cI was waiting.\u201dWhen he heard those words, Sunghyun felt his heart drop.\u201cWant me to guess what you\u2019re going to say?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t guilty of anything, but it felt like he was, like he did something wrong to his lifelong savior. Like\u2026 he was too late.\u201cNo, I will say it. I apologize for being late.\u201dHyukjin shrugged and smiled, then patted Sunghyun on the shoulder. \u201cNot at all.\u201dHyukjin didn\u2019t think Sunghyun was late at all. In fact, he thought it was rather fast. He had always known what Sunghyun\u2019s disposition and personality were like. The lad didn\u2019t need to feel like he did something wrong or feel guilty just because he didn\u2019t say it right away.\u201cIt\u2019s not like you have an obligation to tell me.\u201d Hyukjin fully discerned Sunghyun\u2019s feelings, almost like a mind reader. \u201cYou have no obligation to tell me what you got there. If you were to feel any obligation, it would be because I\u2019m your benefactor.\u201dHyukjin had given him the incredible artifact that was the \u2018Venti Body Tome\u2019 and even lent him the \u2018Wind Shoes +1\u2019. He protected him from the \u2018Bigmouth Lizard\u2019 and the Ghost\u2019s attack. To Jo Sunghyun, Hyukjin was most definitely his benefactor.\u201cBut it\u2019s okay. You can repay the debt you owe me at your own discretion. You\u2019re not obligated to share and tell me everything.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to differentiate the cards in your hand from favors you owe. Because it\u2019s not like you\u2019re repaying a favor by revealing every card in your hand.\u201dSunghyun nodded. \u201c...Okay. Thank you for the lesson.\u201dIn his mind, he was wondering, \u2018Just how old is this hyung?\u2019He thought Hyukjin was 20, but he seemed at least ten years older in mental maturity. Sunghyun didn\u2019t think there were many proper adults out there in the world, but he got the feeling that he was facing a \u2018real adult\u2019 when talking to Kim Hyukjin.* * *\u201cI want to tell you. I think that will make me feel most at ease.\u201dI also nodded. There was no need to refuse when Sunghyun wanted to say it.\u201cAs you know, when I destroyed the Clear Crystal, it felt like that crystal was being absorbed into my body.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dI\u2019d seen it myself, which was why I was curious about it.\u201cThere was a notice saying the Clear Crystal\u2019s energy melted into my life, and if I satisfied a certain condition, I could activate the \u2018Wind Temple\u2019.\u201d\u201cWind Temple?\u201dI already knew where the \u2018Wind Temple\u2019 would activate\u2014in the \u2018Hill of Wind\u2019 dungeon that would spawn on Geoje Island in Gyeongnam, quite a distance away from Seoul. Only, I didn\u2019t know the particulars about the dungeon.\u2018It was known as a dungeon that the Typhoon Jo Sunghyun cleared on his own\u2026\u2019Was that \u2018Wind Temple\u2019 the same as the \u2018Wind Temple\u2019 being discussed now? I couldn\u2019t be sure, and that was because Sunghyun and I cleared the \u2018Tomb of the Great Orc Warrior\u2019, a place that hadn\u2019t existed in the past. The Clear Crystal of that flash gate had given Sunghyun this opportunity.\u2018When did the past Sunghyun get this opportunity?\u2019Back then, the Herdsman of Las Vegas wouldn\u2019t have proposed a gamble, and there hadn\u2019t been a \u2018Bluelight Candle\u2019 then, either. The process was a little different, so it might have been that Sunghyun was originally supposed to have gotten this \u2018opportunity\u2019 later. I didn\u2019t know\u00a0when\u00a0the past Sunghyun got this opportunity, but the general flow of events seemed to be going in a similar direction as the past. It was just that the timing was different.Sunghyun continued. \u201cI don\u2019t know any details yet either.\u201dI glanced sideways at Senia. It looked like she was still streaming.\u2018Should I throw out some bait?\u2019Appealing hints that could put Guardians on pins and needles were called \u2018bait\u2019, aka \u2018foreshadowing\u2019. Some Players and Streamers were skilled at using such bait to fire up the Guardians.\u2018Even if you only make good on seven out of ten baits thrown, it\u2019ll be a jackpot.\u2019That was a publicly known fact. If none of your baits became relevant, you would be cussed out, but there was no need to make good on every single one you threw. The Guardians would go crazy even if only seven out of ten hit the mark.\u201cBy any chance, if you get a condition for a dungeon you have to clear alone\u2026 Let me know. I think I\u2019ll be able to give you some advice.\u201dSunghyun\u2019s eyes quivered.State: Very ShockedMy Eye of Perception, a skill capable of seeing various representative emotions, showed that Sunghyun was only feeling \u2018Very Shocked\u2019 right now. It meant he was just that surprised.\u201cHyung.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSunghyun pulled up his sleeves and showed me his arms.\u201cI have goosebumps right now.\u201d\u201cHow come?\u201d\u201cI heard a notice just now. A notice saying that I\u2019ve just satisfied one of the Clear Crystal\u2019s conditions.\u201dEven I was flabbergasted.\u2018Out of nowhere?\u2019Just what kind of condition did he satisfy?\u201cApparently, this energy is embedded and fused into my body. So it\u2019s linked to my cognitive system.\u201dSo basically\u2014\u201cAs soon as I thought of the keywords \u2018dungeon you have to clear alone\u2019... the condition was satisfied. Those keywords were the condition, hyung.\u201d\u201c...Is that so?\u201dI acted unperturbed, but I was just as shocked. I just casually said a sentence, and that in itself became a hint. Was it really okay for something like that to happen?\u201cYou only said one thing\u2026 How is this possible?\u201d\u201c...\u201dThat was exactly what I wanted to know. I was surprised, too, but I kept feigning calmness.\u201cIt must be because you have a sovereign class, hyung.\u201dNo, I didn\u2019t think my class had much to do with this.Sunghyun looked very excited, which was unusual for the usually quiet boy. He was talking faster. \u201cNew information was unlocked. It looks like an item called \u2018Fox Tail\u2019 is the key.\u201d\u201c...\u201dFox Tail. It was an item I had already possessed before. Back in the dungeon the Giant of the Sunset crafted with all his power to raise his all-time favorite Player Choi Sung-gu, I used the Fox Tail in the Valley of Fire.\u2018Fox Tail was the clear item?\u2019 From that, I could infer something significant. \u2018When the serial murders happened near Mt. Inwang in the past\u2026\u2019In the past, the government covered up those grotesque murders, and in the end, the man arrested as the suspect for the serial murders even committed suicide. This time, I successfully hunted the \u2018Six-Tailed Fox\u2019, which prevented the serial murders from ever happening.This time, I hunted it. But what about in the past?\u2018I think\u2026 Sunghyun must have killed it.\u2019When that occurred to me, it felt like the somewhat hazy pieces of the past became more clear.\u2018The past Sunghyun didn\u2019t publicize the unlock conditions for the Wind Temple.\u2019It was a dungeon he cleared alone, so there hadn\u2019t been much reason for him to reveal the unlock conditions. However, Jo Sunghyun valued \u2018impartiality\u2019 and \u2018justice\u2019. When it came to information that he didn\u2019t necessarily\u00a0have\u00a0to publicize, but\u00a0could, he would choose nine times out of ten to publicize it on the off chance it might help others even a little bit.\u2018The Fox Tail he got back then, and the Six-Tailed Fox that dropped it.\u2019He wasn\u2019t able to reveal his acquisition of the Fox Tail from the Six-Tailed Fox\u2026 because the government had covered up the very existence of the \u2018Six-Tailed Fox\u2019. It was possible that the Jo Sunghyun of that time realized that the true culprit of the serial murders going on at the time was the Six-Tailed Fox.\u2018If he did\u2026 he must have felt an incredible amount of guilt.\u2019With his personality, he must have felt stuck between a rock and a hard place, with a heavy sense of guilt weighing down on him. He must have really wanted to reveal the truth about the wrongly accused man\u2019s unfair death. No wonder he hardly ever mentioned the \u2018Wind Temple\u2019.\u2018If I hadn\u2019t regressed and more time passed\u2026\u2019If the Typhoon grew stronger, and his desire to reveal the truth grew, would he have exposed the truth? Would he have told the world that the government and police back then fabricated the incident and unfairly robbed a person of his precious life?\u2018He might have, yes.\u2019I didn\u2019t know, but from what I had seen of Jo Sunghyun, I thought it was very possible. But there was a Korean saying like this: You can sound water ten fathoms deep, but the human heart is unfathomable.\u2018It didn\u2019t happen in this life, and it won\u2019t happen in the future, either.\u2019In this timeline, Sunghyun would be able to Play with a slightly less burdened heart. He had no idea, but I had inadvertently freed him of one of his lifelong sources of guilt.I smiled broadly.\u2018Is it\u2026 too grandiose to say that I\u2019m correcting the past?\u2019It might be. I was just lucky.\u201cFox Tail is dropped by a spirit-type monster called Six-Tailed Fox. Its level is in the late 20s.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a commonly appearing monster at this point in time. But later, the day would come when he would find a Six-Tailed Fox. It wouldn\u2019t be that hard.\u201cAs long as you watch out for its Doppelganger technique and talent in running away, it shouldn\u2019t be all that difficult to hunt.\u201d\u201cHave you already killed one before?\u201d\u201cYeah. Near Mt. Inwang.\u201dCome to think of it, I also inadvertently saved Yeonseo\u2019s mom at that time.\u2018I saved Yeonseo\u2019s mom and also helped Sunghyun.\u2019It felt like my return to the past was having a good influence on the people around me.\u201cBut it probably won\u2019t appear near Mt. Inwang again.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely shrewd monster, so it won\u2019t appear where another of its kind showed up before, much less a place where one was killed.\u201d\u201c...Thank you for the information.\u201d After thanking me, Sunghyun made up his mind. \u201cI want to become a person like you who can share that kind of information to others.\u201d\u201c...That so?\u201dThat reminded me\u2014the \u2018Typhoon Jo Sunghyun\u2019 and the \u2018Great Explorer Jackson\u2019 were known to be pretty close friends.\u201cI\u2019ve really felt and learned a lot from you.\u201dIt was a little embarrassing, but I simply nodded, knowing that his feelings were sincere.\u201cI will work hard to become someone like you, hyung.\u201dInside the taxi, Sunhwa went from dozing on her feet to dozing in the car. She was snoozing with her head on my shoulder, and I was amazed she could sleep so deeply even inside a lurching car. She was so fully out of it that she probably wouldn\u2019t even notice if someone carried her off.\u2018It does feel like the pieces of the past are a bit weird.\u2019The covering up of the Mt. Inwang serial murders, the existence of Sungshin\u2019s Team Leader Kim Kangchul, and Jo Sunghyun, who hadn\u2019t been able to tell the truth.\u2018Something off.\u2019It was just my feeling. I couldn\u2019t put a finger on what exactly it was, but it felt like there was a big mistake in my understanding of something in the past.\u2018Though I have the feeling\u2026 that I\u2019ll find out more as my Playing progresses.\u2019By this point, I trusted my \u2018gut\u2019, my \u2018intuition\u2019. There was definitely something in the past, something I wasn\u2019t getting.\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201dWe made it back home. The taxi stopped at the entrance to the complex, not going all the way into the parking lot.\u201cI\u2019m sleepy, oppa.\u201dSunhwa seemed as sleepy as ever. She was clutching the hem of my clothes as she trailed behind me like a zombie, unable to keep her eyes open.\u201cYou\u2019re walking like a zombie.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a zombie. Yaaaaawn.\u201dYawning widely, Sunhwa mumbled something like, \u201cZombies look scary. I don\u2019t look scary\u201d while trudging behind me.\u2018Huh\u2026?\u2019I instantly got a feeling that something was weird. I focused my mind, then stopped in place, turning around to put my hands on Sunhwa\u2019s shoulders. I peered into her eyes. She was still half-awake, unable to open her eyes fully.\u2018No matter how tired she is\u2026\u2019From my experience of Playing so far, this level of odd behavior should have been obvious. But I didn\u2019t notice it, and Eye of Perception didn\u2019t catch it, either. If I was right, I was under the influence of \u2018that\u2019.But at least I knew now. Thankfully, I noticed it relatively quickly. Staring into Sunhwa\u2019s eyes, I asked,\u201cWho are you?\u201dAt that moment, Sunhwa\u2019s body started to tremble uncontrollably, convulsing bizarrely.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91:Sunhwa\u2019s body began to spasm, almost like she was getting electrically shocked. Her pupils looked like they were covered with a white film.A strange sound came from her mouth.\u201cGrr\u2026 grrrr.\u201dI was well informed about this phenomenon. Called \u2018possession\u2019, it was caused by one of three possible things.The first was Demon Realm parasites. The second was a mind control attack from a \u2018ghost\u2019-type monster, a kind of spirit monster. The third was the aftermath from a Guardian\u2019s descent.The Great Explorer Jackson explained it like this:\u2013Divided even further, the causes of possession can be classified in six different ways, but generally, we differentiate the causes in three ways. Thankfully, mankind has come up with preventative measures for each case.Demon Realm parasites hid in the human brain, controlling the human\u2019s actions while consuming brain tissue.\u2013An outstanding cleric Player can exterminate the parasites without much trouble. The host of the Demon Realm Bugs must immediately request the help of a cleric of at least level 50. In this respect, Korea\u2019s medical system is very well established.If those bugs were to appear in the world right now, we wouldn\u2019t be able to do a thing about them, but I didn\u2019t think that was happening yet. I didn\u2019t see the symptoms of Demon Realm Bug affliction.\u2013If a person is afflicted by Demon Realm Bugs, their eyes will turn pitch black, followed by their hands and feet. They will present with similar symptoms to a Pearl Centipede affliction.Sunhwa was making a bizarre sound that was neither groaning nor breathing roughly, just a very odd sound.\u201cKghhh\u2026\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like she was afflicted by Demon Realm Bugs.\u2013The method to determine whether the patient has suffered the mind control attack of a ghost monster is very simple. All you have to do is ask the possessed person a question. If they don\u2019t answer the first time, ask them multiple times.It was like Columbus\u2019 egg. The method to diagnose a ghost monster attack was hard to come up with, but once it was discovered, it was an easy thing anyone could do.\u201cI\u2019ll ask again. Who. Are. You?\u201d\u201cKghhh\u2026 psheee\u2026!\u201dSunhwa\u2019s body continued to convulse.\u2013If you suspect that the possessed is afflicted by a ghost monster, all you need to do is ask them the question, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 multiple times. There will definitely be a reaction. Eventually, they will answer \u2018who they are\u2019.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cKghhhh\u2026!\u201d\u2013If you ask them multiple times and they do not respond, then it\u2019s almost certain that they are not afflicted by a ghost monster. The third cause is the aftermath from a Guardian\u2019s descent, but\u2026Because \u2018descent\u2019 wasn\u2019t a common occurrence, even Jackson could only guess what he thought might be the case.\u2013There are times when temporary symptoms similar to possession show up due to a Guardian\u2019s descent. It has only been observed a few times on a global scale, and is said to disappear naturally on its own with time.When a descent occurred, not all Players were affected by it. It wasn\u2019t like the Guardian picked someone out to control their mind; it was basically something like a side effect from a descent.\u2018Side effect from a descent. It affected Sunhwa\u2026 and even affected me.\u201dAs expected of a Guardian\u2019s descent. That was why I hadn\u2019t noticed something being off. I really couldn\u2019t deny it if you said this was just my mistake, but I did get the feeling I was indirectly under the influence of a Guardian\u2019s ability and power. My hunch was probably correct.\u2018In any case\u2026\u2019Right now, Sunhwa was suffering from a side effect.\u2018Side effects\u2026 don\u2019t affect people the same way. Some people get them, some people don\u2019t.\u2019Sunhwa was just unlucky and ended up manifesting that side effect.\u2018Jeez, this girl.\u2019I put the spasming girl on my back. Her condition would settle on its own with time. I was relieved to see no one was nearby, since she would draw weird looks at the moment. I could feel her convulsing on my back.\u2018This is actually a good thing,\u2019 I thought while moving forward. \u2018I might have gotten indirectly influenced, but it\u2019s still true that I failed to notice it.\u2019There was something I missed other than Sunhwa\u2019s condition being off, something directly related to Sunhwa.\u2018It\u2019s true that Sunhwa has genius-level talent.\u2019She had proven that as early as the Tutorial. Sunhwa was a diamond in the rough who would shine more and more radiantly with every passing year.Even before all her talent plates were open, before her body was done growing, her growth speed and skills were already on par with guys like Yeonseo and Yoohyun. In terms of talent alone, she might actually outstrip them by a mile. Once she was a little older and had a more proper evaluation done, her results might cause a huge uproar.\u2018It\u2019s possible she\u2019ll even be marked as having 67 talent plates.\u2019Considering the upper display limit for Korea\u2019s talent plate evaluation device was 67, it was possible she had an immeasurable level of genius. But even for such a genius, there was definitely a weakness.\u2018She\u2019s mentally weak.\u2019She was still a kid in her teens. No matter how remarkable her talent for tanking was, her mind wasn\u2019t as strong. She couldn\u2019t be good at everything.\u2018Her resilience against physical attacks is ridiculous\u2026 but she\u2019s weak to non-physical attacks.\u2019When I thought about it, it was obvious. Even with such a talent, she was a kid who had been reduced to tears of terror because of a baby Goblin.\u2018If one\u2019s weakness is unknown, there\u2019s not much you can do.\u2019But if you knew, you could cover for it. It was actually good that I knew now. Where could you find a person who was perfect in every aspect? Take the Byeon Gilsup, for instance. The man who became famous as the \u2018Spear Demon\u2019 had terrible poison resistance, so he went wild buying all the poison resistance items.Thanks to the Ruler of the Plains, I was able to grasp a simple fact that I had missed. I should actually thank them.\u2018We\u2019ll need to invest in mental defense items. With that, she\u2019ll be perfect.\u2019I should also have her put more points into her Willpower stat.\u2018Thanks to this, I\u2019ve learned something important.\u2019I now had a better idea on how to nurture Sunhwa.\u201cMmm.\u201dBefore I knew it, Sunhwa\u2019s convulsions had subsided. The descent side effect seemed to have mostly passed. She was murmuring something to herself, and when I craned my ear to hear, they were just meaningless mumbles.\u201cFried chicken.\u201d\u201cHamburger.\u201d\u201cPizza.\u201d\u201cTteokbokki.\u201d\u201cSoondae.\u201dAfter listing a stream of foods, Sunhwa suddenly made a sound of utter bliss, going \u2018Hyaaa!\u2019 Her sleep talking didn\u2019t end there. She screamed a \u2018Sho tashty!\u2019 and then suddenly came back to her senses. I couldn\u2019t see her since she was on my back, but if I had to guess, her eyes probably flew wide open.\u201cGeh!\u201dShe flailed like she wanted to get down, so I simply let go.Thud!She flopped to the ground with a thud. For her, an impact like that wouldn\u2019t even sting. Her mind might be tofu, but her body was as sturdy as could be.\u201cOp-Oppa.\u201d\u201cBack to your senses? Remember everything?\u201d\u201c...\u201dSunhwa\u2019s face turned beet red.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be that embarrassed.\u201dShe just suffered a descent side effect, that was all. It could happen to anyone. The redness of her face had even spread to her ears.In a small voice, she mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m on a diet.\u201d\u201c...\u201dWhat was this girl going on about now?\u201cI don\u2019t eat that much.\u201dAnd?\u201cSo the things I muttered about just now\u2026 I\u2019m absolutely not saying I want to eat them. It\u2019s just\u2026 sleep talking. Yeah, something like sleep talking.\u201dThe fact she could remember everything made it pretty unlikely that she was just sleep talking, but I decided not to mention that.\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about it at all.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re telling the truth, right?\u201dThat seemed to reassure her. Her summary instantly changed a little.Summary: Slight Brocon Denying their IdentitySunhwa spoke to me seriously, like she was trying to brainwash me.\u201cI\u2019m not a pig.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cI\u2019m absolutely not a pig. Seriously. Seriously.\u201dDenying their IdentityI could see her summary all too clearly, but I didn\u2019t show it.\u201cShould I order fried chicken?\u201d\u201cFr-Fried chicken?\u201dSunhwa\u2019s eyes widened like saucers, and she suddenly broke out into a blissful smile.\u201cYeah, fried chicken. Want some?\u201dSunhwa 0, Fried Chicken 1.Summary: Slight BroconThe \u2018Denying their Identity\u2019 part cleanly disappeared from her summary.All her embarrassment forgotten, she smiled brightly as she clamored, \u201cYou\u2019re going to buy two chickens, right? One per person, right? I\u2019ll be disappointed if you don\u2019t!\u201d* * *Sunhwa was not the only one vulnerable to the allure of fried chicken.\u201cWe\u2019ve ordered half spicy, half regular.\u201d\u201c...\u201dNoona just stared indifferently at me. At least on the outside, the person sitting at the table didn\u2019t seem all that interested.\u201cPlus an extra soy sauce chicken on the house, which makes a total of three chickens, one per person.\u201dNoona was crazy about soy sauce chicken.\u201cNot interested.\u201dMy sister experienced almost losing me once. Perhaps because of that, she was always very alarmed whenever she heard about gates or dungeons appearing. The press must have made an uproar about the flash gate that appeared in the \u20181st Players Convention\u2019 as well as the Orcanthropes, so I could only imagine how anxious she must have been again.\u201cBut it\u2019s half spicy, half regular, with a soy sauce chicken on top?\u201d\u201c...\u201dNoona, I can totally see the saliva going down your neck. Why\u2019s your hand trembling like that?\u00a0It appeared that the members of my house had very capricious summaries. Food might be an even stronger form of mind control than possession to them.Summary: Tsundere Tempted by Fried ChickenWell, Tsundere Tempted by Fried Chicken was better than Devoted Tsundere, I guess. After all, I had received plenty of my sister\u2019s devotion in my past life.\u201cAre you buying?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll help you out and eat it this time.\u201dSo why\u2019re your lashes quivering? How come your lips are curling up? And why are you gulping your drool?\u2018Is it because of Eye of Perception and Observer\u2019s Eye\u2026?\u2019Even without activating them on purpose, I could see my sister\u2019s expression in high resolution. My vision was very different from my past life. Even if I saw the same things, I could see more, and in greater detail. From the way she was sneaking into her bedroom, she was probably planning on paying for the chicken herself.\u2018Is it because I\u2019ve become a Player?\u2019The formerly \u2018talentless\u2019 me was now already in their early level 30s. I was walking shoulder to shoulder with heroes. I\u2019d have to get through level 40 to know if I was an early bloomer, but for now, anyone would say that I was speeding along.\u2018And now, I can even eat fried chicken like this with my sisters.\u2019It would have been great if my mom could have joined us, too, but she would be coming in an hour or two.\u2018Two hours, huh.\u2019Her return time wasn\u2019t 100% set in stone, so I was curious as to who would come first. I called my noona and Sunhwa to the table.\u201cIn a little bit, someone will probably come looking for me.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cMm, one of two possibilities. In any case, don\u2019t be too surprised, no matter who ends up coming.\u201dI informed this tsundere older sister and tofu-mind little sister of mine in advance so they wouldn\u2019t be shocked silly.\u201cJust trust me and don\u2019t do anything. Okay?\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cYou trust me, right?\u201dNoona gave me a dubious stare.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t go out and cause a mess somewhere.\u201dSunhwa, looking totally excited by the prospect of fried chicken, chirped, \u201cI trust you, oppa!\u201dTo the current Sunhwa, \u2018I can eat chicken soon\u2019 was more important than my safety or her trust in me. I could almost see the thoughts of, \u2018That doesn\u2019t matter, I wanna eat chicken soon!\u2019 swimming around in her brain.\u2018Anyway\u2014\u2019I glanced at the time. It was 6:40 pm. Would my mom come first, or would they? While I was waiting, [!!!] marks popped up over Darongi\u2019s head.At the same time, the doorbell rang. Someone had come to our house.\u2018Ah.\u2019 I found myself grinning. \u2018So this is how they wanna do it, huh.\u2019It was amusing. With this, my course of action was also set. Perhaps because Senia was streaming me, I heard a new notice.[The \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 is focusing on you.]It wasn\u2019t my mom who came first. As I expected, the people who came to our house were the police.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92:I asked over the intercom, \u201cWho is it?\u201dThe response I expected came over.\u2013This is the police. This is the home of Mr. Kim Hyukjin, correct?The police came, and I knew very well why. As they entered our apartment, Noona gave me an indifferent stare, and I tried to smile to reassure her that everything was okay.\u201cNoona, it\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t worry and just stay put. Let me go take care of things real quick, and then we can eat fried chicken together.\u201d\u201c...You really didn\u2019t cause a mess somewhere, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I didn\u2019t. This is, well. Hm, something like a big show of force.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cGo to your room for now. I\u2019ll take care of it, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019ve made a mess somewhere, you\u2019re dead.\u201dShe was looking at me with distrust, with what appeared to be a little loathing. That was what her expression said, but I knew what she was actually feeling.State: Extreme WorryI could see it from her state, and I could feel her true feelings through Eye of Perception as well. She was terribly worried about me. It probably meant I was just that important to her.In any case, I turned my attention to the police.\u201cWe must ask you to accompany us for a little bit.\u201dJust then, Senia appeared, her wings unfurled. My exclusive contracted Streamer exuded absolute aloofness and beauty with her very presence.As soon as Senia revealed herself, the two policemen flinched.\u2018Naturally.\u2019They must know what Senia was. To them, she was probably something like an unknown being who looked different from humans and could suddenly appear out of thin air, transcending time and space (though that was actually just coming out of the transparent state). An almighty alien who could erase the life of one or two humans with a single swipe of her finger.\u2018As expected, they\u2019re scared.\u2019Be it policemen or detectives, they were reduced to mere puppies with their tails tucked between their legs in front of Senia. Guns didn\u2019t even work on her, and she wasn\u2019t human, so they couldn\u2019t enforce human laws on her, either.\u201cLet\u2019s go then,\u201d I said, walking forward.\u2018What an obvious little trick.\u2019I was well aware of why I was being taken to the police station. It was because of \u2018assault\u2019. I strangled Kim Taechun into unconsciousness. However, I knew he hadn\u2019t made charges against me, because he must still be out of it from the aftermath of the failed descent. That meant someone else had reported me to the police, and it was because of that person that the police took action so quickly.\u2018It\u2019s almost ridiculous how obvious this is.\u2019If things dragged on too long and I ended up not being able to eat fried chicken with my chicken-tempted older sister and my chicken-loving little sister, this little scenario wouldn\u2019t go over nicely.\u2018Song Kiyeol.\u2019The second place I would be meeting Song Kiyeol would be the police station. There, we would have an intense talk. I arrived at the station, and a little time passed.* * *There were none of the browbeating policemen I\u2019d seen on TV here.Summary: Rod of the People Experiencing Love at First SightSummary: Old Bachelor Blinded by BeautyEach and every summary was amusing. There was a guy who fell in love with Senia at first sight, one that was \u2018blinded by beauty\u2019, and one summary was even:Summary: Policewoman Enlightened to a New WorldThe fact that her summary said \u2018policewoman\u2019 instead of \u2018policeman\u2019 meant that person was very conscious of their gender.\u2018What new world?\u2019From the way she was sneaking glances at Senia, she almost seemed like a pubescent teenager in love.\u2018Well\u2026 It\u00a0is\u00a0peaceful, that\u2019s for sure.\u2019These people were simultaneously fearful of Senia and charmed by her beauty. Thanks to this terrifying yet awe-inspiring Intermediate Administrator, I wasn\u2019t subjected to much harassment.\u2018Guess Song Kiyeol\u2019s plan is already off the tracks from the start.\u2019 I guessed his plan. \u2018He probably intended on putting me in hot water, then coming in to save me like a knight in shining armor.\u2019That way, he would hold the higher ground in any future engagements or negotiations with me. His intentions were so blatantly clear. Even as the policemen interrogated me about my assault, they seemed to be waiting for someone.\u2018Observation is such a wonderful thing.\u2019I couldn\u2019t read their inner thoughts, but \u2018observation\u2019 relayed a great deal of information to me. The quality and quantity of the information I received was different compared to other people.\u201cI can wait until my lawyer comes, yes?\u201d\u201cYes, feel free.\u201dWith Senia backing me, the policemen couldn\u2019t treat me roughly anyway and they had their own intentions, so they just let me be. As a result, I was able to wait in peace.I whispered to Senia.\u2013Making me feel enough pressure before he makes a sufficiently heroic entrance should last about forty minutes, don\u2019t you think?\u2013Forty minutes?\u2013Yeah, it should be about forty minutes.After making calculations of her own, Senia began to stream using a strange language I couldn\u2019t understand.[The \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 is watching with interest.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 focuses on the 40 minute time limit.]And to my surprise, he really did appear after forty minutes.\u2018Iya, fancy seeing you here, Mr. 3rd Generation Chaebol Song Kiyeol. That was easy?\u2019Was it because he was still inexperienced? I\u2019d felt this for a while, but I felt like I could read Song Kiyeol like an open book. In terms of gambling, my hand of cards was way better than his.I smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve come, my lawyer.\u201dThis was where I would make my decision. Would I move forward with the card called Song Kiyeol, or would I discard it?* * *Sungshin was a global conglomerate. In the modern day, money was power, and Sungshin commanded immense power in Korea. He didn\u2019t publicize Kim Hyukjin\u2019s existence to the media because Kim Hyukjin was a \u2018variable\u2019, and because right now, the most important fact the world had to know was that Taeguk Shield hunted the Orcanthropes, monsters invulnerable to modern weapons.That was what he told the media, but the whole incident left him feeling irked.\u2018Just what kind of guy is he?\u2019Kim Hyukjin. A subject of interest even to his grandfather, and a sovereign-class Player with the incredible ability to instantly put the Orcanthropes into a groggy state.\u2018I don\u2019t get him at all.\u2019He needed to know a little more about this enigma. The man\u2019s ability was desirable. If he could turn Kim Hyukjin into a subordinate, then he would, and if he couldn\u2019t, then he really did have to establish a working relationship. Otherwise, the man would have to be eliminated.For now, he decided to put Kim Hyukjin into his debt before their conversation together. He didn\u2019t release it to the mass media, but the scene where Kim Hyukjin assaulted Kim Taechun was clearly recorded from start to finish. Using that, he mobilized the police.\u2018Let\u2019s see if he can be that relaxed even in the police station.\u2019His opponent was a regular person. Certain that Kim Hyukjin wouldn\u2019t be resting easy in the police station, he intentionally waited a little.\u2018He\u2019ll probably be anxious enough to bow and scrape.\u2019As a Korean, he should know how much authority and power he, Song Kiyeol, held. He truly had enough power to make a little assault charge fly away with a single word. To begin with, the police wouldn\u2019t have even gotten themselves involved in a matter between Players if Kiyeol hadn\u2019t instigated it.He entered the police station\u2026 and was greeted with someone\u2019s voice.\u201cYou\u2019ve come, my lawyer.\u201dTo his shock, Kim Hyukjin looked incredibly relaxed. Kiyeol had the bad feeling that things had gone awry from the start.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019He saw her right away. The Intermediate Administrator, Senia. A woman possessing angelic beauty that didn\u2019t seem to belong in this world.\u2018Even though he\u2019s not even Playing\u2026\u2019She appeared in the police station?\u2018Was that intended by Kim Hyukjin?\u2019Did he make Senia do as he wanted? But how could a mere Player make an Intermediate Administrator act as they wished? According to Song Kiyeol\u2019s common sense, that was impossible. It couldn\u2019t happen.\u2018He was lucky.\u2019That was the only way he could interpret this.\u2018That attitude, like he knew I\u2019d be coming\u2026\u2019Kiyeol had already lost once in a battle of wits. Even so, he was the one with the advantage. But the words that came next challenged that thought.\u201cKim Taechun is in a coma, yes?\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because of descent. I stopped a Guardian descent that was about to happen. If that descent had actually occurred\u2026\u201d Hyukjin shrugged. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be talking here like this.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBoth of us would be dead.\u201d\u201c...\u201dSenia took a step forward. \u201cI, an Intermediate Administrator, confirm the veracity of that statement.\u201d* * *Song Kiyeol turned to the investigator who had been interrogating me. \u201cWould it be alright if I had a private conversation with Mr. Kim Hyukjin for a moment?\u201dWow. Was that really okay? I was amazed that he suddenly requested a private meeting. The funny thing was that the private meeting was actually permitted.\u2018Even though he\u2019s not a policeman? He\u2019s not even a lawyer.\u2019Well, whatever. We were taken to a room within the station.\u2018Just my guess, but I doubt this won\u2019t be recorded. If it is, even better.\u2019I started talking first. \u201cDid you come to help me?\u201d\u201cYes, I did.\u201d\u201cShould I be saying thank you?\u201d\u201cThat is something for you to decide.\u201dI sat down. Senia had returned to her transparent state, but I could feel her presence.[The \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 continues to focus.]After I choked Kim Taechun and made him black out, when I didn\u2019t see myself on the news or hear any mention of my name on the radio in the taxi, I knew for a fact that this situation would occur.\u201cI\u2019ll start then.\u201d I raised the index finger of my left hand. \u201cFirst. The comatose Kim Taechun cannot report me. Second. If so, someone else did. Third. That someone has the power to make the police move this swiftly and without delay.\u201dWith three fingers outstretched on my left hand, I started counting on my right hand now.\u201cFirst. The appearance of the variable Kim Hyukjin was not publicized to the media. Second. The variable called Kim Hyukjin does not desire becoming known to the media. Third. In the end, Kim Hyukjin was not publicized.\u201dI stretched out all my fingers and shrugged. \u201cWhat could these things mean?\u201dSong Kiyeol\u2019s eye twitched. \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d\u201cA person who can perfectly control the media, someone capable of moving government forces. I\u2019m here right now because that person wanted it.\u201d\u201cAnd you think that person is me?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was you, Mr. Song Kiyeol.\u201dIt\u00a0is\u00a0you, and everyone knows it. But I didn\u2019t say that. I simply smiled with an air of calm. After watching his reaction for a moment, I continued.\u201cThere must be someone out there who wants to have the higher ground in a negotiation with me.\u201d\u201cI have come here to help you. I find your remarks very unpleasant.\u201d\u201cHow did you know I was in the police station?\u201d\u201c...\u201dThis man seemed as lofty and unreachable as the heavens in my previous life, but now, I felt like I was dealing with a child. It was really amazing. So much had changed after coming to the past.\u201cThe police do not like to involve themselves in matters between Players. Why? Because there are Intermediate Administrators in the middle.\u201dAnd yet they moved this rapidly?\u201cI would guess they had no choice even though they didn\u2019t want to. Because there was pressure from up top.\u201d I grinned. \u201cBut alright, let\u2019s just say I don\u2019t know who the source of that pressure was.\u201dThis was enough for a show of my hand. There was no need to shout \u2018You\u2019re the criminal!\u2019 outright. What I was going for was just \u2018Your scheme is dogshit!\u2019\u201cI also don\u2019t intend on resenting it, either.\u201d\u201c...\u201dFor the briefest moment, uncertainty flashed over Song Kiyeol\u2019s face. For the briefest moment, there was a trace of panic.\u2018He\u2019s wavering nicely.\u2019This was the negotiation table. A business table between me and this 3rd generation chaebol scion, a man whose name would fly high as the guildmaster of Taeguk Shield, but would still lose the battle of inheritance to his younger sister, Song Junghye.\u201cAfter all, it was a pretty decent choice using the cards that could pressure me.\u201dIf\u00a0I were a moron who didn\u2019t know anything, that is. But I didn\u2019t say that. In business, everything was calculated on profit and loss alone. For a moment, Song Kiyeol made an expression of uncertainty before quickly schooling his countenance into expressionlessness.\u201cIt was just that those cards were ineffective on me.\u201dMy cards were just a little better than his. My field of vision was a little wider than his, that was all.I had completely seized the initiative.\u201cShall we start our conversation? There must be a lot you want to ask. I\u2019d like this to be a useful time for me, no\u2026 for us.\u201dTo be more precise, my test for Song Kiyeol began.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93In a single patient general hospital room, Byeon Gilsup perched on a chair. His gaze moved to the bed.\u201cHaah, this absolute dunce.\u201dFor some reason, Kim Taechun had turned monster-like and then was quickly dispatched. And via a back choke, no less. A combat class Player letting a non-combat class grab them by the back of the neck? That wasn\u2019t just a disgrace. It was utterly humiliating.\u201cIf it were me, I woulda just bit my tongue and ended it.\u201dGilsup was only here because the Guildmaster, a freaking 3rd generation chaebol,\u00a0told him to keep a good eye on this guy.\u201cHow can you call yourself a combat class with shit skills like that? You might as well eat shit, dude.\u201dByeon Gilsup had watched Kim Taechun and Kim Hyukjin\u2019s fight on the 12th floor earlier. He was one of the people who were able to read Hyukjin\u2019s movements.\u201cIt\u2019s cause you were so fucking slow that you got slammed by a non-combat class, idiot.\u201dHe sighed like he was frustrated. He was confident that if it had been him, he wouldn\u2019t have lost so pathetically.\u201cBro, you gotta just loosen up there, and then move fast like whoosh and go wham wham! Like this, dude! Gah, so frustrating. Just like me, wham! Wham! Like this.\u201dHe was sure that if it were him, he could have easily taken Hyukjin down. He believed in his \u2018spearmanship\u2019.\u201cAll that weight you had on him, wasted. The heck was that? And when are you gonna wake the hell up? How long do I have to stay here babysitting your ass?\u201dHe clicked his tongue as he continued to cuss out the unconscious Kim Taechun, calling the man an idiot to top all idiots.But just then, someone came into the hospital room.\u201cThank ya.\u201dIt was a white-haired grandma. Her face was full of lines that showed the passage of many years. She grabbed Gilsup\u2019s hand, looking quite composed.\u201cThank ya, sonny. Thank ya for savin\u2019 our Taechun. Thank ya so much.\u201dWhen she bent 90 degrees, Gilsup hurried to bend 100 degrees with extreme alacrity.\u201cGoodness, it\u2019s nothing, granny. This fellow fought really courageously and well. We were able to clear the flash gate because of him, too. He is a hidden hero.\u201dThe Gilpsup who had been cussing out Taechun moments ago was nowhere to be seen. He gazed warmly at the grandma\u2019s hand\u2019s grabbing his and spoke with a very sincere attitude.\u201cI owe my life to his efforts, granny. Don\u2019t worry too much. He\u2019ll get up soon. Our Taeguk Shield will do its best for his recovery. And you don\u2019t have to worry about the hospital fee.\u201dThey spoke for a while. After some time, Gilsup\u2019s face turned bright red.\u2018She wasn\u2019t his granny, but his mom?\u2019He had called a mom a granny. That was no different from telling her \u2018you look really fucking old\u2019. Cold sweat ran down his back. Today\u2026 was a really tough day.\u2018I-I would be an even bigger piece of shit if I apologized now, right?\u2019The man who would one day become famous as the Spear Demon was forced to undergo a very difficult night.* * *At around the same time as when Byeon Gilsup was undergoing hardship, Kim Hyukjin and Song Kiyeol were conversing.\u201cShall we start our conversation? There must be a lot you want to ask. I\u2019d like this to be a useful time for me, no\u2026 for us.\u201dKiyeol definitely heard it. That \u2018for me, no\u2026 for us.\u2019\u2018A slip of the tongue?\u2019 Had Hyukjin unintentionally misspoken? \u2018No. It wasn\u2019t a mistake.\u2019When he arrived at the police station, he was forced to completely renew his evaluation of Kim Hyukjin. He had devised this situation, but it actually felt like he was the one getting played like a fiddle.\u2018A trick to unsettle me. Or to sound me out.\u2019He was sure of it.\u201cOh right,\u201d said Hyukjin. \u201cI should remind you that this is, of course, being streamed. She is transparent right now, but Senia is transmitting this footage to the Guardians.\u201dThe Guardians were watching. It was a veiled warning not to do anything foolish. That was how Kiyeol heard it.Kim Hyukjin looked extremely relaxed. \u201cI thought there was a lot you wanted to know about me. We have time, so I\u2019ll answer all your questions. Please, ask away.\u201dKiyeol nodded. For now, it was true that he was getting pushed back. He had also lost the initiative. However, since he could have his questions answered, the situation wasn\u2019t\u00a0that\u00a0terrible.\u201cFirst of all, I need an explanation about the sovereign class.\u201dHyukjin gave him a simple explanation. It was a class that allotted roles based on every Player\u2019s ability and maximized their skills and efficiency.\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of class it is.\u201d\u201cYou acted as if you knew that I would come to the police station. Are you a Precognitive Dream user?\u201dHyukjin shrugged. \u201cI have a similar ability.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dTaeguk Shield also had a Precognitive Dream user. Hyukjin grinned, saying, \u201cTaeguk Shield has a person like that too, right? Someone with Precognitive Dream.\u201d\u201cThat is a secret.\u201d\u201cI saw through Guildmaster Song Kiyeol\u2019s Eye of Truth. Do you think I wouldn\u2019t know about a Precognitive Dream user?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt might even be that you were tardy to the Players Convention because of them.\u201d\u201cYou are overthinking it.\u201d\u201cShall I try guessing the name of the Precognitive Dream user?\u201dThat person is Ham Sohyun, right? He didn\u2019t say that.\u201c...\u201dKiyeol flinched. For a very brief moment, he felt a chill. It was almost as if\u2026 everything about him and Taeguk Shield was being \u2018observed\u2019. It was actually more scary that the name \u2018Ham Sohyun\u2019 was left unsaid. It felt like Hyukjin didn\u2019t say it on purpose.\u2018Is it a trick?\u2019It was difficult to guess how much this man knew and how much of what he said was the truth. That made this conversation all the more confusing and difficult. This 20-year-old youth in front of him\u2026 almost made him feel like he was talking to his grandfather.\u201cI\u2019m joking. Even for me, I can\u2019t know things in such detail.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cYou are more timid than I expected.\u201dHe kept feeling like he was ensnared in Hyukjin\u2019s web. Kiyeol pulled himself together and moved to the next question.\u201cHow did you suppress the Orcs?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t the one who suppressed them, but Taeguk Shield.\u201d\u201cAllow me to rephrase the question. How did you put them into a groggy state?\u201d\u201cIt is one of my special skills.\u201dThat was a lie. Hyukjin was only able to use the Spell of Submission because the Whispering Devil had helped him. However, he didn\u2019t show all his cards truthfully.He made an idle remark. \u201cYou can\u2019t try to uncover all my trade secrets. There has to be give and take. I will only say that it is one of my special skills.\u201d\u201c...\u201d* * *Kiyeol continued with what he considered a \u2018trump\u2019 question. \u201cI heard that you treated my youngest sibling almost threateningly. From what I hear, you even wrapped up our grandfather in your denouncement.\u201d\u201cAh. Is that how it was told?\u201dThe truth was the truth. There was no use in talking to the underlings. Hyukjin had dealt a direct blow to the grandson so that his message would reach President Song Kiyoung without a filter.\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I meant.\u201d\u201cYou seem to be confident you can deal with the aftermath.\u201d\u201cThe aftermath?\u201dSitting with his legs crossed, Hyukjin looked insively Song Kiyeol. The Guildmaster of Taeguk Shield still had a long way to go. That was why he would later lose to the second oldest grandchild, Song Junghye.\u201cDo you think that President Song would have sent his beloved grandson to me without any reason whatsoever?\u201d\u201c...\u201dKiyeol had a weird feeling. It felt like Kim Hyukjin knew his grandfather very well. Something was weird. It was like\u2026 Hyukjin knew his grandfather better than he did. For now, he decided to listen.\u201cWhat\u2019s more, an ordinary little kid who holds no position in the company and no responsibilities?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because Jinchul was insisting so much\u2026\u201d\u201cHe is not the kind of person who would simply give in to his youngest grandson\u2019s begging. He only makes it\u00a0seem\u00a0like that. That, too, must be an intentional part of his act.\u201dIt was likely true that he did love his youngest grandson. Jinchul was a grandson he received in his old age. There was no doubt that he had a special fondness for the boy. But not to the point of being unable to separate personal matters from business.\u201cTry to see through the President\u2019s intent. He wasn\u2019t just convinced by a kid\u2019s cute tricks. He wanted to see how I would handle Song Jinchul.\u201d Adding to that, \u201cI\u2019m sure his desire to hear about the situation without a filter was part and parcel. I merely acted in accordance with what he wanted. There was no aftermath to consider in the first place.\u201dSong Kiyeol\u2019s body flinched almost imperceptibly. The new perspective Hyukjin showed him gave him a slight shock.\u201c...You speak as if you know our president very well,\u201d he barely managed. \u201cThough as far as I know, you have only met him once.\u201d\u201cThere are things you only need to see once to figure out.\u201dHyukjin simply fixed Kiyeol with a leveled look. It was a very small clue, but he didn\u2019t miss it.\u2018He called him president instead of grandfather?\u2019It seemed this grandson felt a certain level of distance from his grandfather. After a slight pause, Hyukjin continued staring at Kiyeol.\u2018In other words\u2026 Do you think that President Song wouldn\u2019t know that you\u2019ve come to see me?\u2019He didn\u2019t spell it out. If Kiyeol could realize that on his own, Hyukjin planned on cooperating with him, to a certain extent. To be more precise, he would move forward with bringing the guild under Song Kiyeol\u2019s leadership, Taeguk Shield, under him.\u2018He has to realize at least that much to have the qualifications of a business partner.\u2019If he was so clueless he couldn\u2019t figure this much out, there was no need to work with him. Hyukjin would discard him without reserve. It was because of Song Kiyeol\u2019s wealth and power, as well as his character that was considered quite decent even in the future, that Hyukjin gave him a chance. Kiyeol had to be a much better choice than the Blood and Iron Witch Song Junghye.\u2018Well, he\u2019s a 3rd gen chaebol, after all.\u2019He had things Hyukjin didn\u2019t have. Song Kiyeol and Taeguk Shield had access to nearly unlimited wealth and power. If they used each other and gave each other what was owed, then they would be able to establish a win-win relationship.Thankfully, Song Kiyeol wasn\u2019t a fool.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019He understood Hyukjin\u2019s words and actions. If his grandfather had observed a situation involving Hyukjin via his youngest brother, then what about now?\u2018Grandfather is watching me, too.\u2019It was very simple, but it enlightened him. Actually, Kiyeol\u2019s main interest wasn\u2019t really \u2018Taeguk Shield\u2019. Taeguk Shield was merely a tool and a stepping stone to solidify his position in the succession battle. His true goal was to be acknowledged by his grandfather and ascend to the position of the next president.\u2018This\u2026 wasn\u2019t me testing Kim Hyukjin, but Grandfather testing me.\u2019Hyukjin read that thought. \u201cIt seems that we can communicate more properly now.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cI would guess that the way the President sees you will be affected by the result of your negotiation with me and how your conversation with me progresses.\u201dSong Kiyeol earnestly asked, \u201cI apologize, but are you really 20?\u201d\u201cYes. Would you like to see my ID card?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s no need for that.\u201dHow could a 20-year-old act like this? From his actions and speech, it would be believable if someone said Hyukjin was a 60-year-old man who had experienced the vicissitudes of life.Kiyeol decided not to go around in circles. Hyukjin already knew exactly what the opposite party wanted and was aiming for, and was acting accordingly. Kiyeol understood perfectly well that Hyukjin was a level higher than him.\u2018I\u2019m not the fiddler in this situation.\u2019He came totally convinced he was the fiddler, but he was actually the fiddle. If so, going around in circles was meaningless. He decided to advance directly.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201c$100k per member of our team. And all the items that were dropped earlier.\u201d\u201cI have already promised you that. I will prepare it immediately. Useless oil items also came out, but do you want those as well?\u201d\u201cI believe I asked for everything, did I not?\u201d\u201cUnderstood. I will give you everything.\u201dHe didn\u2019t linger on that. Kiyeol already knew their basic personal details. Kim Hyukjin, Kim Sunhwa, So Yoohyun, Choi Sung-gu, Shin Yeonseo, Jo Sunghyun. A total of six people.\u2018$600k.\u2019It was that much money. Song Kiyeol could easily handle that much on his own.He inquired again, \u201cBeyond that, I am asking what you want in exchange for maintaining a cooperative relationship between my Taeguk Shield and your team.\u201dOnly then did Hyukjin flash him a smile of satisfaction. \u201cIt seems we can get to the true matter at hand.\u201dAs expected of the Guildmaster of Taeguk Shield, Song Kiyeol was still one of the people who wasn\u2019t eliminated in the future and continued to push forward on the front lines as the leader of one of the world\u2019s pre-eminent guilds. He did lose to his younger sister, but he wasn\u2019t a total idiot. No, in all actuality, Song Kiyeol belonged to the elite upper group.It was just a little interesting that the person leading such an elite by the nose was Kim Hyukjin.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94:Once a celebrity took off, they could rake in an enormous amount of wealth and fame. In exchange, they had to give up on their private life. Wealth and fame vs. private life. Where there was light, there was shadow. Only by being popular in the media could you acquire wealth and fame, and in the process, you ended up forfeiting most of your private life and freedom. You win some, you lose some.\u201c...So basically, Taeguk Shield can take all the fame and glory. I don\u2019t need that kind of thing.\u201dMy eyes were solely on the practical gains. I didn\u2019t need the troublesome interest of the public. But I still wanted the benefits that came with such fame. Normally, that would be impossible, but not if I worked with Taeguk Shield.Might as well pick out only the good stuff, right? The method where I could have my cake and eat it too was to put Taeguk Shield in the front and operate in the back.\u201cSo you want to put Taeguk Shield on the outside and take the actual profits?\u201dThat\u2019s right, bullseye.\u201cOf course, my teammates will do their best to cooperate with Taeguk Shield. We can meet later to decide the particulars.\u201dHow favorable would those particulars be? That would be an enjoyable conundrum.\u201cIt\u2019s win-win for us both. I would put Taeguk Shield on the outside and get the practical benefits. Taeguk Shield would get our help and gain the fame and power the guild always wanted.\u201dThey would become the heroes of Korea. That had always been Sungshin\u2019s true aim with Taeguk Shield. The guild\u2019s success would have an enormous effect on improving Sungshin\u2019s image.\u201cThrough that, Guildmaster Song Kiyeol would take a big step forward in the fight for succession.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cYou would be able to win the high ground in your competition with your particularly strong competitor, your second-oldest sibling.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve even seen through that much?\u201dSong Kiyeol must have never imagined that he would have such a conversation with an ordinary person, and in the police station, no less.\u201cI don\u2019t intend on becoming a guild member of Taeguk Shield, but I will think of your guild as an ally of the highest priority.\u201d\u201c...\u201dKiyeol had completely lost the initiative to me. If that was enough to bruise his pride, then he wouldn\u2019t develop any further. He would only grow if he viewed this situation as a learning experience and got something out of it.\u2018What will you do?\u2019I would be happy to see him ask the one question that really hit bullseye. \u2018Just why did you insist on Taeguk Shield? With this much insight, you could have gotten another partner. Is it really only because you dislike the public\u2019s interest and find it troublesome? It\u2019s a little difficult to understand if that is your only reasoning.\u2019 If he sent me such an appropriate line of questioning, I would give Song Kiyeol a few more brownie points.\u201cI have one question.\u201d\u201cFire away.\u201d\u201cIs that really all you want? A simple cooperative relationship? Judging by the current situation, you have already seen through us. You have far more information than we do and have the skills to stand in a far more dominant position.\u201d\u201cYour assessment is sound.\u201dYes, that was exactly right. Then there\u2019s a question you need to ask me, isn\u2019t there? I gave him some more time.\u201cBut is it really because you dislike the public\u2019s interest? Currently, I find it a little difficult to understand\u2026 why you are refusing fame and glory.\u201dGood, well done. It was a pretty good question. I decided to reward him with a little more information.\u201cThat is in part related to my class. The one I have a contract with\u2026 does not like to see me acting in the front.\u201dActually, the Nameless Guardian didn\u2019t particularly prohibit me from doing so. They simply observed in silence. Even so, this kind of gesture was necessary. All things considered, my Guardian was my biggest customer, my VVIP. It was good to show at least this much goodwill.\u2018And it\u2019s an explanation that can convince him.\u2019After some time, his summary changed.Summary: Enlightened 3rd Generation ChaebolHe still had a long way to go. He needed to become an enlightened \u2018Guildmaster\u2019, not an enlightened \u20183rd Generation Chaebol\u2019.\u2018Well, he\u2019s still a beginner.\u2019He had performed well enough to deserve some leniency.\u201cWill you agree to a cooperative relationship of the highest priority?\u201d I asked. \u201cOf course, it would be a verbal agreement for now. We\u2019ll have to discuss the particulars later.\u201dA spoken contract was nonbinding. Naturally, there had to be a written contract. I was saying this to see Song Kiyeol\u2019s guts and willingness to cooperate.In this situation, where I was the \u2018superior\u2019 and he was the \u2018inferior\u2019, it might very well be a bold move for him to decisively accept a contract with me without concrete clauses. No, it was definitely a bold move\u2014he didn\u2019t know what exactly I would demand.\u2018Well then. What will you do?\u2019He had barely scraped by in my test. All things considered, Taeguk Shield\u2019s Song Kiyeol was still way better than the Blood and Iron Queen.\u2018Queen\u2019 sounded nice, but she was actually more often called \u2018Witch\u2019. It was my personal judgment that working with Song Kiyeol was much better than working with Song Junghye, the woman who had wielded nearly absolute power after President Song Kiyoung passed away. I didn\u2019t know what kind of influence this decision would have on the future, but in any case, it was far more favorable for me.\u2018Answer me.\u2019I gave the \u2018inferior\u2019 party more time. Shortly afterwards, Song Kiyeol gave me his response.\u201cI agree.\u201d He continued calmly, \u201cThough I do get the feeling that I was dragged along by you the whole day.\u201dAt least he knew.\u201cIt was a very educational day.\u201dHe seemed more humble than how I had judged him to be when I first saw him on the 12th floor.\u201cNext time, I will look a little more broadly and seize the initiative from you, Mr. Kim Hyukjin.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I want.\u201dThat\u2019s right. You, the Guildmaster of Taeguk Shield, need to become a little more smart and wily so that I, your partner, can have an easier time.With a slightly more relaxed expression, Song Kiyeol said, \u201cShall we leave, then? I have already arranged to have you escorted back in comfort to your home.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dI was thankful, but I wasn\u2019t done talking yet.\u201cIf I were you, Guildmaster Song Kiyeol, I would have made a different proposal.\u201dI decided to give Song Kiyeol, a man considered to be relatively kind and honest for a 3rd generation chaebol, a little tip.\u201c...Pardon?\u201d\u201cThe President aside, isn\u2019t it true that both Guildmaster Song Kiyeol and the other members of Taeguk Shield still do not know much about me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201dHe knew that I had choked Kim Taechun to unconsciousness, put the Orcanthropes into a groggy state, and had a \u2018sovereign\u2019 class.\u201cI\u2019m sure the Players of Taeguk Shield are particularly skilled people.\u201dThat was a no-brainer, since each of them had been carefully selected.\u201cSo how do you intend on explaining to them that Taeguk Shield and I have established a tight knit cooperative relationship? Do you think you can convince them? To them, I am an unknown Player who never even gave a proper explanation of how I subdued the Orcanthropes.\u201d\u201c...\u201dThe higher one\u2019s skill, the more likely it was that they had strong pride. Knowing that very well, I gave the Guildmaster another push.\u201cThere are definitely Players from Taeguk Shield who were able to read my movements.\u201d If so\u2026 \u201cThere must be Players who boasted that they could beat me.\u201d\u201c...\u201dState: Awed / Surprised / Slight FearI could tell from his state. I had clearly hit the bullseye with a single prod. I decided to prod a little more.\u201cFor example, the Player wielding the spear. Or the Player who uses poison.\u201d\u201cYou simply\u2026 continue to surprise me.\u201dIn the end, Song Kiyeol acknowledged everything I said, which was far better than not acknowledging the truth of my words and feigning ignorance. I decided to throw him another tip.\u201cIf you are unable to seize full control of Taeguk Shield, your grandfather will be disappointed.\u201dThat was actually Song Kiyeol\u2019s biggest immediate issue, the issue he had to settle before all else. He had to first turn Taeguk Shield into his loyal hands and feet. Only then would he be acknowledged by his grandfather and have a favorable position in the future fight for succession.\u201cI truly cannot believe you are really 20.\u201dThere was nothing he could do even if he didn\u2019t believe it. I, too, had no idea that I was this capable. I thought I was an idiot because I kept failing the civil service exam, but looking at it now, that didn\u2019t seem to be true. I surprised myself.I scratched his itch a little more.\u201cTo prevent the Guildmaster from being in an awkward spot, I will gladly accept a test.\u201d\u201c...What?\u201dHe really needed me to hold his hand from start to finish, huh. There was a lot to teach him.\u201cIf I were you, I would have proposed a test.\u201d\u201c...\u201dSo come on, say it with your own mouth. That way, you can look more justified in front of your guild members, right? I\u2019ll do you a solid and simply accept.I spelled it out more concretely. \u201cFor example\u2026 something like a PVP.\u201d\u201cA PVP? But you are\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I am a non-combat class. My specialty isn\u2019t combat.\u201d So in other words\u2026 \u201cWhat kind of influence do you think a sovereign class Player who could win against a combat class Player would have in their specialty field?\u201dWas that enough for him to finally get it?\u201cIf I were to tell you I could even prove my Playing abilities as a sovereign, what would you do?\u201dI would prove my outstanding abilities my own way, and Song Kiyeol would prove his discernment his own way.\u201cAnd what do you think the evaluation would be of the Guildmaster who was the first to recognize and actively approach the Player who proved his abilities?\u201dAfter a short moment, Song Kiyeol spoke with a serious expression. \u201cPlease allow me to test you. The test will be a PVP match. As for your opponent, I will choose a Player from Taeguk Shield and inform you at a later time.\u201dWhile saying that, he snuck glances at me like he was scared I might be displeased or offended.\u2018Of course not. You did well. This is how you do it. Keep going like this in the future. You finally seem more like the Guildmaster of Taeguk Shield. You\u2019ve gotta do well so that I\u2019ll wanna cooperate again with you in the future, dude.\u2019\u201cI accept the test.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cIt would be best if you were to bring up a reasonable proposal like this first next time.\u201d\u201c...\u201dFor the briefest moment, Song Kiyeol\u2019s eye twitched.\u201c...I will keep that in mind.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t simply unhappy. His summary changed.Summary: 3rd Generation Chaebol who Met his TeacherThat was a pretty decent change, wasn\u2019t it?* * *One day passed. My opponent would be the future Spear Demon, Byeon Gilsup. It went without being said that the Guardians were also told about the PVP match. It was one of the types of content they went wild for.\u2018PVP, huh.\u2019A PVP against the Spear Demon. Rather than nervousness, I felt excitement.\u2018It should be fun.\u2019The day of the match was just around the corner. It would happen tomorrow.\u2018A simple frontal duel would be a bit risky.\u2019I didn\u2019t think I would be defeated even in a frontal battle, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to show an \u2018overwhelming difference in skill\u2019. The opponent was the future Spear Demon. He would be a far stronger PVPer than the Brown Bear Kim Taechun.\u2018I have to show them an overwhelming difference in skill.\u2019Then, Guildmaster Song Kiyeol would have a justification, and he would be able to show his grandfather that his discernment was correct. And considering the days of cooperation ahead of us, it was best to show overwhelming strength. Even better if I could prove my entire party\u2019s strength, not just my own.\u2018Then I guess\u2026 that\u2019s the method I\u2019ll have to use.\u2019There was a method that would allow me, a non-combat class Player, to win against the combat class Player Byeon Gilsup with an \u2018overwhelming difference in skill\u2019, and that method wasn\u2019t far away.\u2018Time to get overgeared.\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95:There was a saying that went like this: Know thy enemy and know thyself. If you know your enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.I already knew a lot about the Spear Demon Byeon Gilsup. It was believed that even Shin Yeonseo, one of the strongest Korean PVPers, had to be on her toes when PVPing with Byeon Gilsup.\u2018Only a tiny few think so, but\u2026 there were people who put Byeon Gilsup above her.\u2019In PVP, a match between Players, there were countless variables. The battle could go a million different ways depending on how you utilized your opponent\u2019s weakness, timing, how quickly you could read your opponent\u2019s plan, the element and terrain of the field you were fighting on, how your condition was that day, etc. There were countless variables, and you couldn\u2019t always win. That was the reason why Shin Yeonseo wasn\u2019t called the \u2018strongest Korean PVPer\u2019, but \u2018one of the strongest Korean PVPers\u2019.\u2018Because victory or loss is decided by many variables and your luck.\u2019At least for this match, I could control those variables and create my luck. To start, I got an item from Sunghyun.[Wind Shoes +1]Shoes imbued with the blessing of wind. Dramatically increases one\u2019s affinity with the wind element, bestowing a synergistic effect when using wind attribute foot techniques or movement skills. However, a full pair of two shoes must be worn for that function to apply.Attribute: WindAgility +2Grade: RareLevel Restriction: 25Special Skill: Can use \u2018Imaginary Running Start\u2019Equip Restriction: Wind-attribute classIf I used the special skill imbued in the Wind Shoes, I\u2019d be able to fight a slightly more favorable ranged battle.Sunghyun asked, \u201cHyung. Um\u2026 You just equipped the Wind Shoes, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. I did, just now.\u201d\u201c...\u201dHe had an expression of extreme dubiousness that I didn\u2019t quite get. After a moment, he seemed convinced of something.\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure, but you really can equip them after all.\u201dI quickly understood what Sunghyun meant.\u2018Come to think of it\u2026\u2019Even I had to admit it was a little bewildering. My eyes were drawn to one part of the item description.Equip Restriction: Wind-attribute classIt was clearly written in black and white that only a wind-attribute class could equip them, so how was it that I could wear the shoes? One conjecture I could come up with was that the \u2018Observer\u2019 class was a higher grade class with a bigger scope, and the \u2018wind-attribute\u2019 fell under its umbrella.\u201cThe sovereign class seems to be a class that includes a great number of things.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dTo be precise, it wasn\u2019t sovereign, but Observer\u2026\u201cIf you think about it, maybe you can equip them because you have a kind of null-attribute class.\u201d\u201cMaybe.\u201dHis words had some sense to them. Even I didn\u2019t know everything about the \u2018Observer\u2019 class. It was indeed possible that it had an attribute that took precedence over all other attributes. To borrow Sunghyun\u2019s turn of phrase, a \u2018null-attribute\u2019.\u201cEven then, it\u2019s a little hard to accept.\u201d\u201c...\u201dIt was the same for me. I couldn\u2019t quite wrap my head around it, either. I just went to put them on, and they were on. Since I couldn\u2019t say that, I just kept my mouth shut.\u201cI\u2019m sure that you have a secret of your own.\u201dSunghyun actually seemed uplifted by this revelation. His eyes were filled with a sort of\u2026 longing? The look was a little too intense for me, so I slightly averted my gaze.\u2018Let\u2019s just inspect the items.\u2019I also checked the new Great Orc Warrior item I got this time. I\u2019d added the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Gloves to the set via the bet with the Herdsman of Las Vegas.Partial Set Effect: Defends against a physical attack the wearer cannot handle, limited to once per day. However, the attacker\u2019s level must not exceed level 35. If their level exceeds 35, a damage reduction effect will be triggered depending on the attack\u2019s power.With the addition of the Great Orc Warrior\u2019s Gloves to the partial set, the upper level limit for the complete nullification effect went up from 30 to 35.\u2018Byeon Gilsup\u2019s level 30.\u2019I would be able to nullify at least one attack from him. So it was time to go to the next item.* * *After parting with Sunghyun, I met up with Yeonseo next. We picked a coffee shop in Yeonnam-dong, a neighborhood in Seoul.\u2018She looks cute in casual clothes.\u2019In her casual clothes, she looked like any university student and gave off a refreshing, even lively, appearance. Maybe because I was thirty on the inside, I saw her as cute rather than pretty.Sitting on the other side of the table, Yeonseo gave me a smile that reached her eyes.\u201cWhat the, is this a date? Have you finally decided to see me as a woman?\u201d\u201c...\u201dThis smile had consigned countless men to the fate of \u2018Sword Empress crushers\u2019, but it didn\u2019t make me think much. Just \u2018oh, she\u2019s cute\u2019.Of course, I hadn\u2019t called her to have a date.\u201cLend me your sword once.\u201d\u201cMy sword?\u201d Yeonseo seemed troubled for a bit. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can lend it to you.\u201dIt was probably an artifact bestowed by the True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain. Since this was the early game, it would be nothing compared to the \u2018Demonblade Asura\u2019 she would use in the future, but it would still have the highest attack power out of all the sword items I could get my hands on right now.\u2018The sword\u2019s name was Asura.\u2019The future Sword Empress\u2019 beloved sword, Asura.Asura was the king of the Asura Realm, also called the World of Chaos. It also meant he was the king of ghosts. That was why \u2018Asura\u2019 was sometimes called a ghostblade, sometimes a demonblade. It was an artifact of the highest level that had even won the title Sword Among Swords.\u2018I remember the way Shin Yeonseo looked when she swept through the Battle of the Maldives.\u2019The video documenting Shin Yeonseo\u2019s performance had set a huge new Youtube record of half a billion views. In any case, considering there were less than ten artifacts deserving the name \u2018Sword Among Swords\u2019 in the entire world before I regressed, Asura was a named blade that ranked within the global Top 10, at least in the \u2018sword\u2019 category.After a long moment of intense contemplation, Yeonseo opened her mouth.\u201cIf I let you borrow this, will you go on a date with me?\u201dIt seemed\u2026 I needed to make things clear to her. Yeonseo was obviously a pretty woman, but she wasn\u2019t my type. I didn\u2019t know why. I just couldn\u2019t see her as a woman.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re not my type.\u201d\u201cBut will you go on a date with me though?\u201d\u201cI said you\u2019re not my type?\u201dYeonseo\u2019s smile actually widened. I told her she wasn\u2019t my type, so why was she even happier?\u201cDo you always only wear clothes that are your type, eat food that\u2019s your type, and watch movies that are your type? You don\u2019t.\u201dHer summary changed.Summary: Woman Blazing with DeterminationThe dreaded \u2018wife\u2019 disappeared and a new keyword\u2014\u2018determination\u2019\u2014was formed. Even \u2018swordswoman\u2019 disappeared, replaced by \u2018woman\u2019. At least in this moment, she wasn\u2019t the Swordswoman Shin Yeonseo, but the woman Shin Yeonseo.\u2018Determination?\u2019She smiled brightly at me.\u201cMy mum says that there isn\u2019t a tree out there that won\u2019t go down after ten swings.\u201d She balled her hands into fists, pumping herself up. \u201cIf you don\u2019t go down after ten swings, I\u2019ll give up 100%. How about it?\u201d\u201c...\u201dNo matter how I looked at her, she seemed serious.\u201cJust lend me your sword.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve promised me a date, okay?\u201dYeonseo lent me her sword. When I took a look at it, my mouth dropped wide open.\u201cOi. What\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, what\u2019s this? I thought you wanted to borrow it? The True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain also gave permission.\u201dThe Shin Yeonseo who once rejoiced over a \u2018Quality Iron Sword\u2019 was long gone.\u2018She\u2026 had this?\u2019 I almost ended up rubbing my eyes in disbelief. \u2018Why does she already have Asura?\u2019It looked very different from the Asura I remembered. I opened up the item description.[Asura - Growth-Type - Fully Sealed]The named blade the Heavenly Demon has bestowed upon his chosen successor.A legendary weapon made by smelting the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Vital Ki / Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019s Spirit Ki / Magic Pearl of a Dragon.Grade: TranscendentAttack power: 40-63 (currently sealed)Additional effects:DisabledDisabledDisabledDisabledDisabledDisabled30% offensive innate ability damage amplificationCan be freely modified to any shape of \u2018blade\u2019Special note: In a fully sealed state. Not all of its strength can be drawn upon.A fully sealed state. That was why the majority of its additional effects were \u2018disabled\u2019. On top of that, it was a growth item.\u2018I see now, Asura was a growth item.\u2019The more Yeonseo grew, the stronger this artifact would become. It was even \u2018transcendent\u2019 grade. There were rumors that the transcendent existed and the top Rankers were equipped with those transcendent items, but it was my first time confirming it with my own eyes.\u2018Transcendent items really do exist.\u2019It was said that the top Rankers had a world of their own, the so-called World Above. A world that ordinary people didn\u2019t know about and could never hope to reach. It seemed that was really true. But seriously, why did an item of a grade this ridiculous even exist in the early game? There were\u00a0eight\u00a0frickin\u2019 additional effects currently shown.\u2018Even though most of the effects are disabled and the attack power is also greatly weakened\u2026\u2019Even despite that, it was an extremely outstanding item. Of the items in my possession, the one with the highest attack power was Mandra\u2019s Greatsword. Considering that Mandra\u2019s Greatsword had 18-22 attack power, you could say this was one hell of a sword.\u2018What a jackpot.\u2019My plan to get overgeared and give myself the \u2018item halo\u2019 was going way better than I thought.* * *The formal name was the DMC Lucentia Tower, but it was normally called the \u2018Player Center\u2019. Even the taxi drivers didn\u2019t know where Lucentia Tower was, but they knew the Player Center.In any case, I headed to the Players Association with my party, the Player Center where the first convention had been held on the 12th floor. A space for PVPing had been arranged on the roof.I found the choice of location mind-boggling.\u2018They really have no fucking clue.\u2019It didn\u2019t matter now because we were in the beginner period, but once we got into the mid-game, indoor PVP was extremely dangerous. One misstep, and there could be significant damage to the building. Normally, PVP was done in specially made \u2018fields\u2019 or in open areas like clearings.\u2018The Players could even fall off.\u2019This misinformed choice was made because the concept of PVP still wasn\u2019t full-fledged. Anyway, our PVP today would be private, by my request.\u2018No need to make Taeguk Shield\u2019s smackdown public.\u2019Taeguk Shield needed to be heroes in the minds of the people. In light of our partnership, I wanted to protect their image. However, the other party seemed to have a different understanding of my request.A woman in tight-fitting black clothes that revealed every curve of her beautiful body with long, flowing, black hair that contrasted sharply with a snow-white face was sneering at us. Her name was Cheon Sooji.\u2018Poison Witch. Cheon Sooji.\u2019State: Ridicule / Slight Contempt / Desire to WinThere was another Taeguk Shield guild member standing next to her, a considerably handsome man with dyed blond hair. This man, who I remembered as having quite a lot of female fans but also many scandals, was named Gong Jinhoon. Nickname, Golden Priest.State: Regret / Pity / Slight ExpectationThey were staring at me with ridicule or regret. Most of the seven Taeguk Shield guild members here were the same.\u2018The reason why I asked for a private PVP\u2026 was to save Byeon Gilsup\u2019s face, not mine.\u2019They were clearly misunderstanding my intent. It seemed they thought that I feared my immediate and pathetic destruction and therefore asked for a private PVP.The Guildmaster of Taeguk Shield and I shared a simple greeting.\u2018Song Kiyeol\u2019s gaze is strangely shifting to Cheon Sooji.\u2019It was impossible to tell with the physical eye. I couldn\u2019t really put it in words, but his \u2018invisible gaze\u2019, his attention, was on Cheon Sooji.I could guess the reason without much difficulty.\u2018My first opponent won\u2019t be Gilsup, but Sooji.\u2019The Poison Witch Cheon Sooji. By the looks of it, this woman was going to try a little trick on me, in a way that couldn\u2019t quite be called a PVP. She probably had a trifling scheme up her sleeve. I smiled readily.\u2018That\u2019s right, this is what you should do. You should try every little trick in your book. Only then will you be qualified to work with me.\u2019I waited a little, and sure enough, Cheon Sooji came up to me. I would be able to gain at least one thing from her approach, a thing that would be very useful in the Plum Blossom Gate, the \u2018Centipede Cave\u2019.Sooji had an item that I had to acquire before we went into the Centipede Cave.\u2018The first step begins now.\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96:I took a look at Cheon Sooji.[Player]Name: Cheon SoojiAge: 27Level: 29Class: Poison ShamanGuardian: Soundless SerpensInnate ability: [Lustvenom Finger]State: Ridicule / Slight Contempt / Desire to WinDisposition: Sadistic / Erotic / QueenSummary: Queen Chasing StrengthThe disposition/state/summary only show the most representative and can change according to the situation.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible.In the three months while I was in the special hidden piece, most of the top Players hit level 30. Actually, leveling up to 30 was relatively easy. It was just that there were a ton of Players who weren\u2019t able to push through the Hell Phase that was level 30 to 40 and fell apart after reaching the limits of their talent.\u2018In any case, level 29 at this point in time puts her at the top.\u2019Her Guardian was the \u2018Soundless Serpens\u2019. Not much was known about them other than their exclusive sponsorship of Cheon Sooji. They only rarely sent the \u2018Guardian is interested\u2019 or \u2018Guardian is watching\u2019 notices that were so common.\u201cMr. Kim Hyukjin. There\u2019s something I\u2019d like to ask before the PVP match.\u201d\u201cFeel free.\u201dSong Kiyeol smoothly stepped aside, like he and Cheon Sooji had arranged this ahead of time. She asked, \u201cWhy did you ask specifically for a private PVP? This would be a good opportunity to become famous.\u201dShe looked me up and down. Her eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly, almost like she had found a tasty piece of meat. The look in her eyes was strangely provocative, the kind of ambiguous gaze that made a man\u2019s heart thump.\u201cI didn\u2019t really want to publicize it.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to show the world how their team\u2014my business partner\u2014was crushed by a non-combat class Player.\u201cIt seems you already know it will be a\u00a0thorough\u00a0thrashing.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dNot me, but him. Byeon Gilsup was the one who would get thrashed.\u201cAre you a masochist by nature? What compelled a non-combat class to go into a PVP with a combat class, and one from Taeguk Shield, no less?\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cI admire your courage and backbone. It\u2019s the sort of look I like to see.\u201dCheon Sooji licked her red lips. Combined with the look in her eyes, she exuded an extremely ambiguous feel. It was like she was seduction made manifest.Clearly, Cheon Sooji was well aware of her strengths. She seemed very well-versed in how she should act to look flattering, what kind of look she should produce to arouse her opponent, and how to use her appearance to her advantage.She extended a hand as snow white as her face with natural grace.\u201cMake a promise with me.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of promise?\u201d\u201cIf you lose to my teammate Gilsup, come drink with me once. At night. Just the two of us.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cReckless guys like you are my type, you see.\u201dBut her state of ridicule and contempt exposed her too much for me to believe that. I looked at her extended pinky. Her little scheme was obvious to my eyes.\u2018Innate ability, Lustvenom Finger.\u2019Her innate ability hadn\u2019t been revealed even in the future, but I was able to see it with \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019.\u2018She\u2019s got an amusing ability.\u2019Lustvenom Finger.\u2018A finger that inflicts lust poison.\u2019Eye of Perception had long since shown me the name of her ability, and \u2018Observer\u2019s Eye\u2019 traced the flow of mana in her body. I saw energy flowing towards her fingers. One part of her mana was gathered in her fingers, one part near her heart, and another part in her eyes.I was almost certain I knew what she was up to.\u2018She wants\u2026 to work me up before the PVP, I guess.\u2019It was hard to tell how effective Sooji\u2019s current level of innate ability would be on me, but I guessed it would only cause a little acceleration in my heartbeat or breathing, at most.\u2018But even just that could easily have a big influence on the PVP match.\u2019So what should I do? What would the Guardians like to see me do? What kind of Play should I show them? I thought for a moment.Cheon Sooji stared openly at me with her white face and eyes of seduction that radiated the pheromones of the opposite sex.\u201cYou won\u2019t promise me?\u201dAt the same time, my Eye of Perception perceived something.[Eye of Perception perceives a \u2018seductive energy\u2019.][Eye of Perception is higher in grade than the \u2018seductive energy\u2019.][Eye of Perception completely destroys the \u2018seductive energy\u2019.]It went beyond simple destruction.[The grade difference between Eye of Perception and the \u2018seductive energy\u2019 has been evaluated as 'very high'.]Oho. I\u2019d never heard a notice like that before.\u2018I did expect Cheon Sooji to take the initiative to approach me.\u2019That was something I had already known. I was sure she would approach me somehow and try to pull something. I was planning on using that to prepare for the \u2018Centipede Cave\u2019, but I hadn\u2019t expected this kind of notice to come up.[The proficiency of Eye of Perception is at least 2.][The unlock condition for a new Eye of Perception ability has been fulfilled.]The \u2018seductive energy\u2019 Cheon Sooji used seemed to be an exceedingly low level ability. My Eye of Perception proficiency was at 2. The System recognized a very high grade difference, and thanks to that, a new Eye of Perception ability was unlocked.[A power of Eye of Perception, \u2018Mirror Sight\u2019, has been activated.]Last time, when I fought Kim Taechun, I got the additional power \u2018Future Sight\u2019. Yet another new power was activated. This time, it was \u2018Mirror Sight\u2019.[Mirror Sight]An eye that reflects intangible energy. This power has a strong reflective ability against all non-physical mental attacks, including vital energy. However, it will only activate when the energy trying to violate the wielder is markedly lower in grade than the wielder\u2019s \u2018Eye of Perception\u2019. If Mirror Sight is used on an ability of equivalent or higher grade, the user may lose their eyesight.The new power given to me, Mirror Sight, could reflect energies that were much lower in rank than Eye of Perception.\u2018I can\u2019t use it carelessly.\u2019If I used it wrong, I could even lose my vision. However, it was safe to use it this time.[Use Mirror Sight?]I used it immediately. Since I just got it, why not give it a try? Cheon Sooji\u2019s body instantly flinched. What was the energy I\u2019d reflected just now?\u2018Ah. It was seductive energy.\u2019Did that make me the one seducing her, then?\u2018At its current level, she won\u2019t get super seduced or anything like that.\u2019It would just make her eyes a little more drawn to me, or make me look a little more handsome for no reason. That was all, so I didn\u2019t think it would cause any trouble for me.Once Mirror Sight kicked in, Cheon Sooji\u2019s mana flow got tangled up. By the looks of it, the activation of \u2018Lustvenom Finger\u2019 was cancelled.I spoke to the momentarily speechless Sooji.\u201cWhat will you give me if I win?\u201d\u201cWhatever you want.\u201dI stuck out my pinky and hooked it with hers. Her Lustvenom Finger had been deactivated, so it shouldn\u2019t be dangerous.\u201cDon\u2019t forget your promise. I want the \u2018Rot Water\u2019 that poison-class Players can make.\u201dAfter finishing what I had to say, I turned my gaze away from Cheon Sooji and fixed my eyes on Song Kiyeol right next to her.\u201cGuildmaster Song Kiyeol. You have disappointed me considerably.\u201d\u201c...I apologize. Miss Sooji insisted so strongly that\u2026\u201dThankfully, Song Kiyeol didn\u2019t deny it. He acknowledged his fault and immediately apologized. He wasn\u2019t too unsightly.\u201cI apologize for acting rashly.\u201dNo matter how successful and strong Cheon Sooji might be, she would have never made a move with Song Kiyeol right there unless he was in on it. That meant she had informed him of her intent in advance, and the Guildmaster had given her tacit consent.\u201cYes, you were wrong. I would like this to be a fair PVP.\u201dThe looks in the eyes of the Taeguk Shield guild members changed a little, as if they saw me in a slightly different light after I saw through Sooji\u2019s little trick with one glance.\u201cBut there won\u2019t be a second time. Sound me out like this one more time and I will not work with Taeguk Shield.\u201dThey were trying not to show it, but I could feel the guild members\u2019 displeasure. They were probably thinking something like \u2018Who the hell are you to think you deserve to work with Taeguk Shield?\u2019\u2018They must think they\u2019re Korea\u2019s top elites.\u2019They were a guild sponsored by Sungshin, after all. On a guild level, they were indeed the top in Korea.\u2018But individually, they don\u2019t reach the 8 Heroes.\u2019That went for the Taeguk Shield Song Kiyeol as well.\u2018They\u2019re still frogs in a well.\u2019I would show these frogs in a well a far broader sky.* * *Byeon Gilsup stood in front of me.\u201cMy name is Byeon Gilsup. My main weapon is the spear.\u201d\u201cMy name is Kim Hyukjin. No real main weapon.\u201dFor now, I tended to reach for the sword, but it was hard to call it my \u2018main\u2019 weapon, since my most-used skill, \u2018Excellent Strike\u2019, wasn\u2019t limited to the sword.We finished up our simple introductions.\u201cClass, sovereign.\u201d\u201cClass, spearman.\u201dI took a look with Eye of Perception.[Player]Name: Byeon GilsupAge: 26Level: 30Class: Successor of the Rayn FamilyGuardian: Gatekeeper of the Old GraveInnate ability: [Instant Acceleration]State: Desire to Win / Desire to Destroy / RestraintDisposition: Risk-taker / ImpatientSummary: Spearman Full of Desire to DestroyThe disposition/state/summary only show the most representative and can change according to the situation.Because Eye of Perception\u2019s proficiency is not high enough, viewing more detailed information is impossible.His innate ability was Instant Acceleration. I only learned this while interacting with future top Rankers, but there was a world I didn\u2019t know about. There were countless people out there who couldn\u2019t unlock a single innate ability, but these people had at least one innate ability starting from the beginner period.\u2018This is why they say Playing is all about talent.\u2019A somewhat bitter world where you couldn\u2019t stand on the top with effort alone vs. the wretched world of futility that I\u2019d experienced in the past.\u2018In any case\u2014\u2019I wasn\u2019t very nervous. I already knew a lot about Byeon Gilsup, including how he would attack.Disposition: Risk-taker / ImpatientSummary: Spearman Full of Desire to DestroyUsing this disposition and summary as a base, I already knew how he would move. It was so very clear that I didn\u2019t even need to use Future Sight. As soon as the match began, he would come charging at me full-blast.\u2018Tsk, tsk, how can you be so worked up before we\u2019ve even begun?\u2019The PVP zone was established through Senia.[A PVP Zone has been declared.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 is focusing.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 is observing.][The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is indicating her interest.][The \u2018True Master of the Heavenly Demonic Mountain\u2019 is full of anticipation.]The start and end of this PVP was already set in stone.

Who will it be?\u2019It would be great if the Herdsman of the Las Vegas or the Merchant of Venice were to send a notice. Depending on which of the two was focusing on me, I would change my Play style a little.\u2018Not sending?\u2019Right on cue, a notice came in.[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 watches with interest.]It was the Herdsman of Las Vegas. Without missing the perfect timing, I spoke. It was true that life was all about timing, but the ability to create and seize that timing was also a skill.\u201cMr. Byeon Gilsup. Do you like to bet?\u201d\u201c...What?\u201d[The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 is even more interested.]As he should be. Gambling and bets were the first things to come to mind when you thought of the Herdsman of Las Vegas.\u201cWould you like to have a bet with me?\u201dWell then, shall we play?

    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97:\u201cWhat kind of bet?\u201dByeon Gilsup tilted his neck, probably wondering what kind of nonsense I was spouting all of a sudden.\u201cI will not move from this spot.\u201d\u201c...What?\u201d\u201cThe first strike, I won\u2019t defend against it at all.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you know where the vital points of humans are. Try attacking one of those points with all your strength. Of course, I won\u2019t dodge.\u201dGilsup\u2019s expression hardened. He was likely thinking that I was underestimating him right now.\u201cWill I truly be able to take that hit without dodging, or will I die?\u201d\u201cJust what in the world are you saying?\u201d\u201cExactly as it sounds. I am certain that I will be able to take that attack without any damage.\u201d I provoked him a little more. \u201cThe reason why I requested a private PVP today was to show everyone here a new world.\u201dI wanted to show these frogs in a well that the sky was far bigger than the well-sized piece they\u2019d been staring up at all this time.\u201cI will defeat you with an overwhelming difference in skill. To convince everyone in Taeguk Shield.\u201dThe spear Gilsup was holding quivered.\u201cHow about it, Mr. Byeon Gilsup? An attack with every ounce of your strength. Would you like to try? I swear that I am not a tank. Let\u2019s bet on whether someone who isn\u2019t a tank like me can take such an attack without any damage or not.\u201dSure enough\u2014[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 advises against unnecessary provocation.][The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 observes.][The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 is frustrated.][The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 claps his hands with glee.][The \u2018Herdsman of Las Vegas\u2019 is very interested.]Gilsup raised his spear. \u201cFine,\u201d he gritted, grinding his teeth. \u201cThat high and mighty confidence of yours, let\u2019s see how long it can last.\u201dIt looked like he was pretty pissed off. Well, he was a Player with a lot of pride, so he was probably even more galled. Who would have thought that a non-combat class Player who wasn\u2019t even a tank, but a\u00a0sovereign, would ever be treated with such scorn?\u2018I can\u2019t say for certain, but\u2026\u2019There was a high chance the Herdsman of Las Vegas made \u2018some kind of proposal\u2019 to Gilsup. If he accepted my bet, he might have a chance at a big reward.\u2018Which is why he accepted without hesitation.\u2019All the Taeguk Shield guild members were staring at me in bafflement, except for just one of them, Cheon Sooji. That made me sweat a bit\u2014was \u2018Mirror Sight\u2019 too effective? There was slight but unmistakable interest in her gaze.\u2018Whatever, it\u2019ll probably fade soon.\u2019\u201cI\u2019ll make you regret it within one minute,\u201d said Gilsup.Our PVP match began.* * *Byeon Gilsup raised the main weapon he\u2019d enjoyed using lately, \u2018Nox\u2019s Spear\u2019. It had an attack power of around 35.He was sure of it.\u2018Excluding powerful blunt weapons, it has the highest damage.\u2019Blunt weapons could deal a heavy, powerful blow, but they were much harder to swing. To use them, you had to sacrifice a lot of dexterity. But Gilsup\u2019s weapon was different.\u2018I believe in you, Nox\u2019s Spear.\u2019He finished all his preparations to penetrate the heart of the rookie who had arrogantly claimed he would show them all a different sky.\u2018I\u2019ll stab through.\u2019He drew back his arm, leveling his spear so it was parallel to the ground. A single-point stab. When his speartip reached the target point, he would increase the rotational force.\u2018You will definitely regret this.\u2019He loaded the balls of his feet with far more strength than usual. That was so he could deliver a \u2018stab\u2019 with all his weight behind it. You couldn\u2019t use such an exaggerated movement in a real battle, since there would be too much danger of counterattack if you threw all your weight into one attack like this.\u2018I\u2019ll stab his heart.\u2019Song Kiyeol observed Gilsup in silence. He, of course, did not doubt Gilsup\u2019s powerful stab.\u2018His target seems to be the heart.\u2019The heart was a big weak point for humans. And yet, Hyukjin was allowing an undefended attack on such a vulnerable spot. Did sovereign Players have some kind defense skill?\u201cHere I come!\u201dGilsup\u2019s spear surged forward in a horizontal line with all his weight behind it, looking like he was one with the spear. The point of his spear rushed in unwaveringly, aiming precisely for a single spot.Hyukjin wasn\u2019t all that shaken by it.\u2018It\u2019s coming.\u2019There was a very brief moment during which he read Gilsup\u2019s movement. This was the strongest single attack Gilsup was capable of, his strongest stab. He saw how Gilsup\u2019s body moved to create the stab, how the mana in his body flowed.Thud!Something hit his heart.[The Great Orc Warrior\u2019s partial set effect is activating.][All damage has been nullified.]The strike that should have gone through his heart felt like a kid\u2019s weak fist hitting his chest. Actually, it couldn\u2019t even really be called an \u2018impact\u2019, since it was as weak as the kind of drumming you did when your chest felt stuffy.\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dGilsup made an expression of disbelief.\u2018There was\u2026 zero damage?\u2019Hyukjin grinned. \u201cAre you sure that was your strongest attack?\u201dSong Kiyeol was just as flabbergasted. He did think that Hyukjin had something up his sleeve, but he never thought Hyukjin would be able to shrug off Gilsup\u2019s attack with absolutely zero damage.\u2018What in the world\u00a0was\u00a0that?\u2019Just then, Han Seokmin said, \u201cIt\u2019s the power of items.\u201dHyukjin nodded. He hadn\u2019t intended on keeping it a secret anyway, and he knew that Taeguk Shield had Han Seokmin. He had seen a glimpse of Han Seokmin\u2019s ability in action in the Hill of Blowing Wind. This man, who would one day become famous as the \u2018Analyst\u2019, wouldn\u2019t find it difficult to figure out this much.\u2018Seeing as he concluded that \u2018it\u2019s the power of items\u2019 instead of \u2018it\u2019s probably the power of items\u2019, he\u2019s pretty skilled.\u2019The Analyst Han Seokmin. He might be second best now, but he would be a big help later on. Plus, he would be a pretty good match with Hyukjin, an Observer.Song Kiyeol still had a look of disbelief on his face. No matter how good the item was, how could it completely nullify Gilsup\u2019s attack? It was mind-boggling. No item he could think of was capable of that. That mystery item Hyukjin possessed had completely blocked an attack from a determined spearman aiming at a vital point. Wasn\u2019t that essentially like giving you a second life?Hyukjin explained. \u201cBeing overgeared is also a skill.\u201dSince he had decided to show them the broad sky above, he elaborated in slightly greater detail. Simply subduing Byeon Gilsup was meaningless.\u201cA set effect that completely blocks any attack from under level 35 kicked in.\u201d\u201c...There\u2019s an effect like that?\u201d\u201cDo you think President Song was blinded by new tech for no reason? Think he didn\u2019t expect an effect like this?\u201d Hyukjin continued to talk to Kiyeol, completely ignoring the spearman he was in a PVP with. \u201cDo not underestimate new tech too much.\u201dSince he was doing this, he wanted to raise them well.\u201cBecause Taeguk Shield may just become the cornerstone business of Sungshin.\u201dThat was enough to drive in his point. Song Kiyeol had seen the power of \u2018new tech\u2019 for himself. Having a vague estimation of something\u2019s power was world\u2019s apart from seeing it in action.Kiyeol felt goosebumps rise on his arms. \u2018Mr. Kim Hyukjin isn\u2019t PVPing right now\u2026\u2019 he thought numbly.This wasn\u2019t a PVP. It was a\u00a0lecture,\u00a0one\u00a0given to him and the guild members Taeguk Shield while everyone was gathered in one spot.\u2018He\u2019s educating us.\u2019It stung his pride, but Kiyeol would take what was offered. The business that could give him a definite edge in the competition with his little sister\u2026 was the new tech business. The attack just now had engraved that lesson in his bones.Hyukjin smiled.Summary: Guildmaster who Met his TeacherSong Kiyeol seemed to finally have the right mindset. Only once he was satisfied with his progress on the Guildmaster did Hyukjin turn his gaze back to Byeon Gilsup. The spearman looked like he had suffered quite the shock.\u201cThere is a wide range of item effects. The effect and worth of items will completely change based on how you distribute and use them.\u201d\u201c...\u201dGilsup regripped his spear.\u201cI\u2019ve lost the bet, but I haven\u2019t lost the PVP yet.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Hyukjin tossed him a little hope. \u201cThe absolute defense ability I just used can only be used once per day.\u201dBefore he regressed, the set effect of the Great Orc Warrior set was simply a natural part of everyday life, something so well-known that there were all sorts of strategies that hinged on it. There was no need to bend over backwards to keep it a secret, so he used it to teach a lesson instead.\u2018The Players need to get their act together.\u2019Thanks to Hyukjin, the difficulty of the Korean server was noticeably reduced, and as a result, the Players were quite a bit weaker than they were in the past. He judged that a little education was necessary in order to strengthen what was weakened.\u201cIf Taeguk Shield changes first, becoming more proactive after realizing the worth of new tech for themselves, it will definitely influence the other Players to do the same.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t just a PVP, but a stroke in the big picture. The Guardians who were watching all this from one step away scrambled to send messages.[The \u2018Lady of the Scales\u2019 is awed by your unbiased view.][The \u2018Barrier of Blue Light\u2019 keenly understands your feelings.]The justice-aligned Lady and defense-attribute Barrier Guardians actively endorsed him,[The \u2018Courageous Lion King\u2019 is bored.]the courage-lover was bored,[The \u2018Whispering Devil\u2019 snorts at your scheme.]and the Whispering Devil wasn\u2019t very amused by his Playing.[The \u2018Nameless Observer\u2019 continues to observe.]The Nameless Observer seemed to always be among the five Guardians who sent messages. As usual, they were maintaining their neutral position.\u2018In any case, I\u2019ve sufficiently shown the Guardians the picture I\u2019m going for, too.\u2019That meant it was time to wrap up the PVP.\u201cLet\u2019s return to the PVP,\u201d said Hyukjin. Then, he pulled out Yeonseo\u2019s sword, the item of a grade he hadn\u2019t even been sure had existed.\u201cThis time, I will use a sword.\u201d* * *The movements of the future Spear Demon Byeon Gilsup were fast. He appeared to be stepping straight forward, but suddenly swerved right and left as he aimed for Hyukjin\u2019s side.\u201cHiya!\u201dHe made it seem like he was going for the side, but his spear whipped upwards without any warning and came down like a guillotine.Whumpf\u2013!His spear shaft came hurtling down towards the crown of Hyukjin\u2019s head.Hyukjin had completely read Gilsup\u2019s movements. He nudged the spear shaft away with his palm, twisting.It was difficult to block a vertical strike from the bottom. At worst, the impact could even fracture his wrist. Instead of opting for a reckless head-on match of strength, Hyukjin slipped away to the side.\u2018I can see the opening.\u2019If he immediately rushed in and swung his sword, he could easily subdue Gilsup. However, he didn\u2019t do so.\u2018What a\u2026 strange feeling.\u2019It was similar to what he had experienced when fighting Kim Taechun, an opponent far weaker than himself; a similar feeling to when he\u2019d gotten Eye of Perception\u2019s special power, \u2018Future Sight\u2019. A strange feeling, like he could see something.\u2018No, I can actually see it more clearly than that.\u2019The King of Swords Asura was showing him the sword path, and unbeknownst to Hyukjin, he was being drawn into it.Hyukjin, who had never learned swordsmanship, began to learn.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98:\u2018Asura\u2026 is showing me the sword path.\u2019I was definitely the one moving the sword, but it felt like Asura itself was fighting. I could see new paths and points I hadn\u2019t seen before.\u2018I could have pierced his forehead just now.\u2019But once again, I stayed my hand. All these paths and points, the so-called sword path, were a new learning experience and lesson for me.\u2018My movements have become much lighter, too.\u2019I realized that my movements had become very similar to Yeonseo\u2019s. Of course, they weren\u2019t as clean as hers. Looking purely at \u2018sword-related technique\u2019, Yeonseo was a step above me. But I had something Yeonseo didn\u2019t.\u2018Stats and items.\u2019With the edge they gave me, I was creating movements that almost mirrored hers. I was physically creating a technique.\u2018Modifying Heavenly Demonic Flying Step into a foot technique would probably feel something like this.\u2019I could feel that I was growing in the midst of battle. It was different from fighting a monster. My growth felt far faster when I was facing humans. I swung my sword in a trance, in the state that was called being \u2018one with the sword\u2019.After not much time passed, I heard a notice.[The innate ability \u2018Sword Path Tracing\u2019 has been awakened.]\u2018Huh?\u2019The notice startled me out of the trance I\u2019d been in.\u2018Sword Path Tracing?\u2019[Sword Path Tracing]An ability that creates sword paths. No matter the situation, it will trace sword paths to attack an opponent within attack range.For a moment, I nearly forgot I was in a battle against Gilsup.\u2018This\u2026 is a pretty famous innate ability.\u2019It was an innate ability typically possessed by cream of the crop swordsmen, commonly called the swordsmen Rankers. At least 50% of them possessed the special talent called \u2018Sword Path Tracing\u2019.And I\u2026 acquired that.\u2018No, I didn\u2019t acquire it; I awakened it.\u2019Innate abilities were talents you already had within you, already-existing abilities that could be awakened via special means. I had unintentionally unlocked another innate ability.\u2018Even if I were going mad with pain, even if I myself couldn\u2019t see any paths. Even if I lost both my arms\u2026 it will create a path and follow through, no matter what.\u2019That was the power of \u2018Sword Path Tracing\u2019. Both your arms could be cut off and the ability would still carry out the attack as long as the opponent was within attack range. There was even a case where the Sword Ghost Lee Changhyun successfully pierced the \u2018Red Eye\u2019 by gripping his sword with his teeth because his arms had been cut off.I felt a surge of happiness. \u2018It kinda feels like I just got a killer move.\u2019The day would undoubtedly come when I would be able to make very good use of this new card. I fought Byeon Gilsup with leisure, moving far more naturally and smoothly than before, now that Asura had taught me to read sword paths.* * *From the side, Yeonseo perceived it clearly: Hyukjin had gotten stronger once again. Every time she thought she was catching up to him, he pulled ahead again, and the process repeated. Looking at her rival made her feel a burst of agitation once again, a feeling that quickly transformed into happy excitement. Excitement from seeing a strong person, and happiness from the fact that she was that strong person\u2019s closest teammate.\u2018Like I said, he\u2019s got a serious talent for exciting people.\u2019She filled her eyes with the sight of Hyukjin. Just then, Byeon Gilsup\u2019s spear fell out of his hands.\u201cHaah\u2014! Haah\u2014!\u201dHyukjin\u2019s sword, Asura, rested lightly on the spearman\u2019s throat.\u201cDo you acknowledge defeat?\u201d\u201c...\u201dThe panting Gilsup bit his lips. He had no choice but to acknowledge defeat, but he was being stubborn. It was hard for him to acknowledge that he, a spearman class Player, was defeated by a sovereign class. And that was a result Hyukjin had intentionally crafted.\u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s quite pissed.\u2019Hyukjin intentionally showed him openings and chose not to attack. He gave Gilsup many opportunities to win. Reason number one was because he was having fun with the new ability Asura had given him, and reason number two was to agitate Byeon Gilsup even more.The spearman spoke, barely managing to swallow his rage. \u201cIt seems that the sovereign class\u2026 has many chances to acquire good items.\u201d\u201cYes, of course. It\u2019s called sovereign for a reason.\u201d\u201cYour items are so strong that I\u2019m left wondering if this is truly a fair fight.\u201dBy the standards of the future, that was a completely ridiculous thing to say. In the future, the \u201citem halo\u201d was recognized as another kind of skill. That was just a natural fact of life.\u2018But in the beginning days of Playing, being overgeared wasn\u2019t recognized.\u2019In the early game, the public sentiment in not just Korea, but the whole world, was stacked against items in PVP. Hyukjin was keenly aware of that.\u2018It\u2019s the same now, huh.\u2019The flow of the past and now was the same.\u201cItems, you say.\u201dHyukjin handed the Asura he was holding to Yeonseo, simply returning it to its original owner. He also gave the \u2018Wind Shoes +1\u2019 back to Sunghyun.\u201cAlright then. I\u2019ve passed on all the outstanding items.\u201dHe stopped himself from saying one more thing, which was \u201cI haven\u2019t even used the special ability of the Wind Shoes\u201d. He thought he would need to use \u2018Imaginary Running Start\u2019 at least once, but that wasn\u2019t the case.His thoughts on the battle with Byeon Gilsup were simple.\u2018It\u2019s way easier than I expected.\u2019The PVP was way easier than he thought, even considering he had the help of Asura.\u201cOn the other hand, you have something called the class halo, Mr. Byeon Gilsup. Am I wrong?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you want to comment on items with me, it\u2019s only right to talk about your class halo first.\u201d\u201c...\u201dGilsup wasn\u2019t the type of person to harp on the ridiculous. He was rendered speechless for a moment.\u201cThough well, even your class halo is meaningless.\u201dHyukjin closed in on the spearman instantly using Flash Step, an attack he\u2019d shown everyone here before. He got behind Gilsup\u2019s undefended back and stabbed his neck with a dagger, severing the carotid artery.\u201cYou mustn\u2019t let your guard down until the very end.\u201d It all happened in an instant. \u201cIt was you who said that the PVP hadn\u2019t ended yet.\u201dWith a single attack, blood surged out of Gilsup\u2019s neck. Hyukjin released his grip.Plop!The spearman slumped to the ground like a puppet with cut strings, dying on the spot.[You have won the PVP match.]Cheon Sooji\u2019s eyes widened as she watched. She hadn\u2019t been able to read Hyukjin\u2019s movements just now.\u2018A clean strike free of superfluous movements.\u2019No, it wasn\u2019t just about being clean. It was downright\u00a0terrifying.\u2018The way he cut a person\u2019s throat\u2026 was extremely natural.\u2019They might be in a PVP zone where Players were resurrected, but even so, severing a living person\u2019s carotid artery wasn\u2019t something just anyone could do. Just now, Hyukjin almost looked like a demon of slaughter who had killed a thousand, tens of thousands of times. Sooji felt the breath catch in her throat.\u2018Scary.\u2019It was scary and terrifying. She replayed it in her mind and found that she wouldn\u2019t have been able to avoid that merciless strike, either. She was sure of it.\u2018If that man wanted to, he might be able to kill all of us here.\u2019No, she knew that was an exaggeration. But still, she felt a strange sense of pressure from that man. Her heart thumped unbidden, and a strange nervousness, a strange\u00a0fear, pulsed through her veins. And in the midst of it, there was a tingly, exhilarating thrill.Her heart began to beat wildly.\u2018That man. I want him.\u2019In the meantime, Byeon Gilsup revived in a flash of light.* * *After reviving, Gilsup\u2019s face flushed red. Hyukjin grinned at him in open provocation.\u201cWe can fight again if you like.\u201d\u201c...\u201dBut Gilsup had already felt it. Facing Hyukjin was like facing a wall. He was a strong person Gilsup couldn\u2019t even begin to face with his current skills.\u2018I\u2019m furious.\u2019He was angry, but there was nothing he could do. A defeat was a defeat.\u2018And I\u2019m scared.\u2019On one hand, he was furious, and on the other, he was scared. Those two contradictory emotions gripped him as Hyukjin continued talking.\u201cI\u2019m a sovereign class. You\u2019re a spearman class. I imagine that 1 vs. 1 PVP is a spearman\u2019s specialty.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cThough in terms of the result, the class difference was pretty much meaningless.\u201dHyukjin himself was a little fascinated. It had simply been too easy. Even if two people were the same level and a similar class, their abilities would be heaven and hell apart based on talent. They were both \u2018men in their 20s\u2019, but there was a marked difference in skill within that group.\u2018Even though Byeon Gilsup\u2026 should be a Player with a talent that Kim Taechun can\u2019t even compare to.\u2019And yet, he won, and far more easily than he expected. So easily that he wondered if this was really alright. In any case, he successfully carried out the 1st round of forestalling, which meant he could also get the thing Cheon Sooji had promised him.This was where it really began.\u201cI\u2019ve brought all my party members here.\u201dHe\u2019d gone out of his way to bring all his party members here for this picture. After winning a 1 vs. 1 and provoking the other party, they would have a group battle. Hyukjin wanted to prove not only his individual strength, but his overwhelming skill even in a guild vs. guild battle. He wanted to show them that there was a true sky beyond the one they knew.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a battle that shows off your specialty\u2026\u201d Hyukjin stared at Song Kiyeol as he spoke, \u201cSo how about having a battle that shows off mine this time? It\u2019s only fair that I also get a chance to show you what a class halo is. What do you think?\u201dKiyeol fell into a moment of thought. What Hyukjin was saying was that direct battle wasn\u2019t his forte, so they should come at him if they had the balls, and he would show them his true ability, the \u2018sovereign class\u2019. The gears in Kiyeol\u2019s brain turned rapidly, flicking the abacus beads of profit and loss from accepting this battle.He realized Hyukjin\u2019s intent. Hyukjin wasn\u2019t asking them to fight like this simply to provoke.\u2018His intent is clear.\u2019A simple fight wasn\u2019t what he wanted. Goosebumps rose up not just on his arms, but on the back of his neck.\u2018How can a person like him possibly be 20 years old?\u2019He was almost sure he knew what Hyukjin intended. When he realized it, Kiyeol found himself growing calm.\u2018First. To show not just his individual dominance, but the dominance of his entire team.\u2019In addition\u2014\u2018Second. To bolster my assertion that we need to actively cooperate with his party.\u2019In other words, to prove that his discernment as the Guildmaster of Taeguk Shield was correct.\u2018Third. To make the Taeguk Shield guild members submissive by showing an overwhelming difference in skill.\u2019In other words, he was pre-empting every possible problem. Once he fully realized Hyukjin\u2019s intent, Kiyeol had to really think for a moment. If things went as Hyukjin intended, it was almost guaranteed that Taeguk Shield would be defeated. He couldn't be sure if their loss would truly be a good thing.\u2018And if we were to win?\u2019That would be good in its own way. He had more than enough willingness to cooperate with Hyukjin anyway. From what Kiyeol had seen so far, Kim Hyukjin had competence in spades. If Taeguk Shield won, Kiyeol would be able to take a slightly more favorable position in their relationship moving forward.\u2018We\u2026 will do our best to win.\u2019Winning was of course good, but there wasn\u2019t much to lose from losing, either. That was the kind of big picture Hyukjin had drawn for him.And so, he accepted.\u201cI accept your proposal, Mr. Kim Hyukjin.\u201dTheir side had a rough estimation of the other side\u2019s forces, compiled based on the eyewitness reports of the survivors from the Hill of Blowing Wind. Kiyeol figured that they might have a slight edge in that regard.Hyukjin spoke to Senia. \u201cSenia. Can you declare a GVG zone instead of a PVP zone?\u201d\u201cThe declaration of a GVG zone requires the sponsorship of a Guardian.\u201d Not long afterwards, Senia spoke again. \u201cIt is possible to declare a GVG. This GVG will be sponsored by the Herdsman of Las Vegas.\u201dNotices came in.[A GVG Zone has been declared.][Moving to the GVG Zone.]The Players were covered in light, and no one was able to see the profound smile on Hyukjin\u2019s lips.Song Kiyeol\u2019s belief that this was a \u2018big picture drawn Hyukjin drew for him\u2019 was only half right.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99:I craned my ears to hear the notices.\u2018We\u2019re probably the first people to have satisfied the GVG conditions.\u2019If PVP was Player vs. Player, GVG was Guild vs. Guild. The scale varied depending on the situation, but it was often called \u2018a small-scale war\u2019.\u2018Is it one after all\u2026?\u2019Whether the first GVG was a hidden piece or not was a long-standing debate. Was the first GVG truly a hidden piece? No one had confirmed which guild was the first to open a GVG. Several guilds claimed to have held the first GVG, so everyone said something different.Now, I would be able to resolve this age-old question. GVG content was actually something that showed up in the mid-game, so I had pulled it way forward in the timeline.The next moment, I heard a notice.[This is the first GVG.][A Hidden Piece has been fulfilled.]We had been moved to an open clearing. The ground was hard cement, and it was a plain, featureless place with no slopes or obstacles, kind of like a training hall. The opposing guild, the guild members of Taeguk Shield, grew wide-eyed.\u201cHid-Hidden piece?\u201d\u201cA hidden piece was triggered.\u201dTheir faces were flushed with great excitement. Seeing their reactions, Sunhwa tilted her head.\u201cOppa. Was a hidden piece really that amazing?\u201d\u201c...\u201dYeah, it was. Ordinary people were hardly ever able to experience a hidden piece, and finding an unpublicized one was near impossible. I thought about telling Sunhwa that, but I didn\u2019t.\u2018She probably won\u2019t get it.\u2019After being exclusively around me and other Players with top-level talent, her common sense was very twisted. If I had to guess, it might be something like a rich kid who had a chauffeur not knowing how much a bus ticket cost.In the end, I settled for just saying, \u201cNormally, they\u2019re hard to find,\u201d and Sunhwa nodded, but as I thought, she didn\u2019t seem all that convinced. In any case, it was true that this was a hidden piece.A new quest was given on the heels of the last notice.[The hidden quest \u2018Achieve Victory in the First Battle!\u2019 has been triggered.]This was a reward given by the System itself and had nothing to do with the reward from the sponsor of this battle, the Herdsman of Las Vegas.Song Kiyeol was, of course, a little flushed as well.\u201cShall we begin the battle?\u201d\u201cOne moment, please. There is something I need to check. Let\u2019s begin a little bit later.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dWith that, their side earned some time to strategize, which our side needed as well.\u201cBoss Hyukjin. How should we act now?\u201d\u201cHold on.\u201dStrategizing was important, too, but there really was something I needed to check. The yellow [!!!] marks in front of my eyes.[The Hidden Piece \u2018Achieve Victory in the First Battle!\u2019 has been fulfilled.][There is a title that can be connected to the first discovery of the Hidden Piece \u2018Achieve Victory in the First Battle!\u2019]That title was \u2018First Pioneer\u2019.[Will you connect the title \u2018First Pioneer\u2019 with the Hidden Piece \u2018Achieve Victory in the First Battle!\u2019 and trigger the linked scenario?]I checked the details immediately.If a Player with the [First Pioneer] title is the first to discover a [Hidden Piece], it is possible to trigger a linked scenario. Linked scenarios can be triggered three times.Linked Scenarios Triggered: [1/3]Linked Hidden Piece: [Pioneer who Seized the First Victory]Scenario: Make a significant contribution in the upcoming war.

This time, my choice was\u2014\u2018YES.\u2019The part about making a \u2018significant contribution\u2019 was a little vague, but I judged that it was best to accept this time. The reward was a title upgrade, of all things, and the title in question was one with a whopping 20% additional EXP bonus. Upgrading it if possible was a no-brainer.[The connection between the title effect and Hidden Piece has been completed.]I made my decision. The GVG with them was part of the picture from the start, ever since I was first notified about the \u20181st Players Convention\u2019. Ever since I whispered to Senia and told her I would \u2018bring Taeguk Shield under me\u2019, this situation was part of my plan.\u201cI\u2019ll distribute the roles starting now. Listen up.\u201dThe reason why I came here in the first place was to prove my ability as a sovereign. And now, it was time to do that.* * *Hyukjin was already well aware of the other side\u2019s forces. All of them would be famous Players in the future. The numbers didn\u2019t match up, so one of them stepped out for a total of six Players.The Taeguk Shield, Song Kiyeol.The Poison Witch, Cheon Sooji.The Golden Priest, Gong Jinhoon.The Spear Demon, Byeon Gilsup.The Analyst, Han Seokmin.The Sand Giant, Shin Kangha.Each of them would grow into Rankers everyone would acknowledge. But Hyukjin\u2019s side weren\u2019t easy foes, either.The Fist King, So Yoohyun.The Fire Lord, Choi Sung-gu.The Typhoon, Jo Sunghyun.The Sword Empress, Shin Yeonseo.They weren\u2019t just easy foes, but people who were actually far more famous. Not yet, but still. With the Kim siblings, Hyukjin and Sunhwa, added to the four, their team had six Players as well.[The GVG has begun.]As soon as the match began, Hyukjin used his special skill, Flash Step. His goal was to get behind the Golden Priest, Gong Jinhoon. The blonde-haired man was currently wearing a silver armor item, and all for a simple goal\u2014to hide that he was a \u2018healer\u2019.\u2018I already know that you\u2019re a healer.\u2019Closing in instantly, Hyukjin stabbed at Gong Jinhoon\u2019s neck with his dagger. Rather, he\u00a0tried\u00a0to. Song Kiyeol had reacted with alacrity.\u201cI knew you\u2019d do this\u2026!\u201dThe Taeguk Shield Kiyeol protected Jinhoon\u2019s neck with a special energy. Hyukjin had already shown them Flash Step before, and Han Seokmin had analyzed Hyukjin\u2019s most likely first step, using that as a base.For a very brief moment, Song Kiyeol tasted the hope of victory.\u2018It was exactly as Seokmin analyzed.\u2019If that side had the sovereign Kim Hyukjin, their side had Han Seokmin, a tactician class Player who could even use a special ability called \u2018Oracle\u2019.The problem was that Hyukjin knew that Taeguk Shield had Han Seokmin, and he knew Seokmin would read him.Hyukjin grinned. \u201cI knew, too.\u201dAt the same time, Yeonseo charged. Hyukjin was bait. The true attack was from Yeonseo. She moved far faster than she normally showed, an explosive speed that wasn\u2019t quite as fast as Flash Step, but more than speedy enough to stab the opponent. She cut right into the momentary opening and pierced Gong Jinhoon\u2019s neck.\u201cGugh!\u201dYeonseo\u2019s Single Hit Finisher showed that it fully deserved its name. Jinhoon crumpled on the spot. He didn\u2019t die, but he flailed, unable to bear the pain. He wouldn\u2019t be able to heal in that state.In the meantime, Cheon Sooji attacked Yeonseo. Black marble-like spheres of poison sprayed towards Yeonseo.Whooosh\u2013!A wind came out of nowhere. It was a man-made wind, a special breeze manifested via magic. A Magic Wind blew in.It was Jo Sunghyun.\u2018I\u2019ve already done this once before.\u2019They had already experienced a similar attack. The poison marbles were similar to the attack used by the Ghosts on the Hill of Blowing Wind. The experience they\u2019d gained from dodging those marbles was already engraved in their bodies. Sunghyun slightly altered the trajectory of the poison marbles, and that slight change gave Yeonseo a great deal of breathing room when dodging.\u201cThanks!\u201d she called out, widening the space between them in an instant. Hyukjin hadn\u2019t been able to extricate himself yet, but Song Kiyeol could sense that something was going off-kilter.\u2018Still\u2026\u2019There was hope.\u2018We\u2019ll kill the sovereign!\u2019He knew that Hyukjin held a huge role in their party. If Hyukjin died, a big crack would definitely form in their side.[Using the skill Restraint.]Something like a pool of blue mana appeared under Hyukjin\u2019s feet. It was Kiyeol\u2019s skill, a restraining skill.Thinking that Hyukjin was restrained, Gilsup stabbed with his spear.\u201cHyaaa!\u201dThe extremely fast attack looked as if it would pierce Hyukjin\u2019s heart, but he had already seen the future.[Utilizing the power of Future Sight.]Even Hyukjin couldn\u2019t predict every single situation that could occur in a battle. He couldn\u2019t overcome everything with his intuition and analysis alone. Therefore, he used Future Sight, though it would exhaust him. Through it, he read Byeon Gilsup\u2019s attack like it was telegraphed.The spearman\u2019s goal was his neck.\u2018Though he\u2019s making it look like he\u2019s going for my heart.\u2019In the end, the path would end at his throat. It was probably a special skill that suddenly changed path and struck a different weak point, something similar to \u2018Sword Path Tracing\u2019.Hyukjin twisted a little. Armed in the Great Orc Warrior set, his defense far exceeded the average Player\u2019s.\u2018I can definitely do it.\u2019As he slightly twisted, he pushed away Gilsup\u2019s spear.\u2018Break the weapon balance, and\u2026\u2019He rushed up to Gilsup.Splurt! Splurt! Splurt!He stabbed the dagger he was holding into Gilsup\u2019s side multiple times in quick succession. He wasn\u2019t greedy; inflicting an injury was enough.\u201cOryaa!\u00a0Boulder Fist!\u201dWith Yoohyun\u2019s assistance, Hyukjin got out of the Taeguk Shield encirclement. It was only a brief confrontation, but the tide of the battle had already completely shifted.Song Kiyeol couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cMay I ask you one thing?\u201d\u201cAnytime.\u201d\u201cAre you sure you are a non-combat class?\u201dShin Yeonseo moving much faster than expected was surprising on its own, but Hyukjin\u2019s movements were beyond all imagination. It was impossible to view him as a non-combat class.\u2018His movements are one thing\u2026 but what the hell is that ridiculous tanking ability?\u2019He didn\u2019t just take an attack; he used his sturdy body and outstanding reflexes to knock away Gilsup\u2019s spear.\u2018Despite it being an unconventional attack Gilsup didn\u2019t show in the PVP match.\u2019The unconventional nature of the attack meant absolutely nothing to Hyukjin, who saw through it in a single glance like he knew it was coming. As a result, he had the leisure to get close to Gilsup and had about 0.5 seconds to deal an injury.His ability to adapt, his agility, his situational judgment, all of it went beyond expectation. Kiyeol thought to himself\u2026 that this was how it would feel to meet a genius above geniuses.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt. I notarized it through my Intermediate Administrator.\u201d Hyukjin shrugged. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m a sovereign.\u201d\u201c...\u201dThere was no law forbidding a sovereign from directly engaging in battle, but still, this was too much, wasn\u2019t it?Song Kiyeol asked again, \u201cJust in terms of fighting capability alone\u2026 about where do you stand inside your team, Mr. Kim Hyukjin?\u201dIt was an important question. Hyukjin grinned.\u201cI will only say that I am indeed a non-combat class Player.\u201d\u201cDo you mean\u2026 that you are the weakest one?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tank as well as this kid, I\u2019m worse at single-hit DPS than Yoohyun, I\u2019m slower than Yeonseo, and of course, these two are better than me at magic.\u201d He shrugged again. \u201cWell, something along those lines.\u201dHe smiled, giving a boast that wasn\u2019t just empty words. \u201cBy the way, these guys haven\u2019t even gotten started yet.\u201dHe phrased it exactly to make the Taeguk Shield guild members misunderstand. The weakest one, the sovereign, nearly single-handedly created this situation. He was saying one thing: Think you can really face us as a team when the weakest one among us was capable of wreaking such havoc?\u201cHow did you cast off my restraint?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a secret.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t anything big, just that Hyukjin\u2019s magic resistance was far higher than Kiyeol\u2019s restraining ability. Hyukjin was just as surprised when he saw the future via Future Sight.\u2018Guess my magic resistance is super high.\u2019Eye of Perception, which alerted Hyukjin to danger, didn\u2019t go off this time, which meant the Guildmaster\u2019s Restraint was simply that weak. There was just that much of a gap between them.\u2018Byeon Gilsup is weaker than I thought, and so is Song Kiyeol\u2026\u2019They were all a little weaker than Hyukjin expected. While Hyukjin was feeling that it was easy, Kiyeol felt like he was facing a massive wall.\u2018I really\u2026 cannot see a way to win.\u2019It was like chipping away at a stone wall with a spoon.Just then, someone said to Hyukjin, \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten started yet, either.\u201dThe voice belonged to Shin Kangha, the Player who would one day become famous as the Sand Giant. His extremely strong competitiveness made him a Player who would rather die than lose.At Kangha\u2019s words, Kiyeol snapped out of his daze. It felt like they were fighting a wall, but they still had to do their best to the very end. His combative spirit blazed up again.Hyukjin raised his index finger. \u201cThe GVG hasn\u2019t ended yet. I merely engaged in conversation because you asked me to.\u201dHe pointed his finger at Song Kiyeol and mumbled a stream of incomprehensible words.Kiyeol panicked.\u2018Mag\u2026ic?\u2019____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100:Hyukjin raised his finger on purpose, as if he were going to do something. As if\u2026 he were going to use magic. He pointed his finger at Song Kiyeol and called out, \u201cBang!\u201dKiyeol flinched, and Observer\u2019s Eye captured the mana moving urgently in his body.\u2018That\u2019s the energy of a tank.\u2019Hyukjin couldn\u2019t put how it differed in words; he just felt it instinctively. That was the energy of a tank, an energy with a focus on defense. That energy covered the Guildmaster\u2019s body, and Hyukjin had the feeling it was especially concentrated on the forehead.A cheeky voice came from behind Hyukjin.\u201cHeh. Fooled ya, huh?\u201dIt was Choi Sung-gu. His flame whip was making another appearance. The magic was moving significantly more smoothly than before, an indication that his cooperation with Sunghyun had become much more natural.Hyukjin\u2019s finger was a fake.\u201cShabam! Fiery Flame~ Whip~!\u201dSung-gu and Sunghyun\u2019s fusion magic, Flame Whip, smashed down on Shin Kangha.\u201cTake this! Gooooo!\u201dFwoooosh\u2013!Flames raged on Shin Kangha\u2019s body.Hyukjin read Kiyeol\u2019s mental state.State: Panic / Mentally GroggyIn order to properly block a spell from two mages who had been quietly preparing all this time, you would need the tank Kiyeol, or Gilsup or Sooji would have to attack the mages.\u2018Gilsup is injured. Sooji is being marked by Sunhwa and Yeonseo.\u2019That left Song Kiyeol as the best person to block the spell, but he was completely tricked by Hyukjin\u2019s fake out.Hyukjin didn\u2019t think the spell alone was enough to kill Shin Kangha.\u2018With his defense, he\u2019ll be able to survive it.\u2019Sure enough, Kangha\u2019s body started to transform.\u2018Morph enhancement Player.\u2019Sand wrapped all around his body, and it looked like he had become a sand person. He clearly took a lot of damage from the Flame Whip, but being injured didn\u2019t seem to restrict his movements as much as it did with Gilsup.Hyukjin saw Han Seokmin\u2019s mouth moving.\u2018He\u2019s probably telling his guild members what he analyzed with his special ability.\u2019Basically, they were doing something like a guild chat. But that was fine.\u2018Because I\u2019m much higher rank than Han Seokmin.\u2019There was no need to keep him in check. Taeguk Shield would be famous in the future, but they were still complete beginners to a GVG like this. No matter how outstanding their talent might be, they couldn\u2019t be perfect at something from the very start. Actually, rather than saying that Taeguk Shield was bad at this, it was more accurate to say that Hyukjin was simply doing too well. He was the odd one for being so proficient when it was also his first time.Shin Kangha shouted, \u201cDie!\u201dA massive fist of sand, a magic attack capable of dealing quite a lot of damage, surged into the sky.Hyukjin stood quietly in place and stared at the sand fist without a hint of urgency. As a sovereign, he didn\u2019t look daunted in the least.\u2018The attack target is me.\u2019He simply watched. After all, their side had an amazing tank.\u201cDream on!\u201dA shield glowing with white light formed above Sunhwa\u2019s right hand. Kangha\u2019s sand fist crashed into Sunhwa\u2019s shield and streamed to the ground as formless grains of sand.Meanwhile, Yeonseo killed Gilsup and Yoohyun smashed Seokmin\u2019s head in. The result of the GVG was all too obvious.Kiyeol\u2019s body trembled.\u2018This isn\u2019t just an ordinary difference in skill\u2026\u2019He had to acknowledge the glaring truth in front of him.\u2018It\u2019s an\u00a0overwhelming\u00a0difference in skill.\u2019They were strong, so strong that Taeguk Shield should be the ones begging to cooperate. He was experiencing that with every cell of his body. Experiencing something personally was completely different from knowing something.\u2018This is for the best.\u2019His primary goal was indeed accomplished as planned. He just hadn\u2019t thought that they would be so overwhelmingly steamrolled even though they had done their best.Hyukjin patted Kiyeol\u2019s shoulder.\u201cToday is the last time I will offer you trade conditions as an equivalent partner.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cSeize the opportunity, Guildmaster Song Kiyeol.\u201d Coming closer, Hyukjin whispered very quietly in Kiyeol\u2019s ear, \u201cI will prop up Taeguk Shield as Korea\u2019s heroes, as Korea\u2019s greatest guild. I will make it so that you can take the lead in propelling the new tech wave.\u201dThis was the last opportunity.Kiyeol had a gut feeling. If he failed to grasp this opportunity, Kim Hyukjin would give up on him. He would probably seek another guild to work with. It was possible that the next chance might be given to Kiyeol\u2019s younger sister, Song Junghye.The person who would surely shape the future\u2026 was Kim Hyukjin.\u201c...It\u2019s our loss. I acknowledge our defeat.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - LeiProofreader - AshJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Song Kiyeol trudged out the elevator.\u2018What do I tell Grandfather?\u2019Three hours prior, up until the GVG started, Kiyeol never doubted that it would be a well-matched fight. Their opponents might have named Players like the \u2018Tutorial Ender\u2019, but he was confident there wouldn\u2019t be a huge difference in skill between the individual Players.That was a miscalculation.\u2018To think there was this much of a gap\u2026\u2019As he headed to his grandfather\u2019s office, his steps became as heavy as lead. It wasn\u2019t like he failed to predict defeat, but it was also true that defeat was a bitter pill to swallow.\u201cWell, then. What are your thoughts after meeting Kim Hyukjin?\u201d asked President Song, his hands laced together on his desk.\u201cHe absolutely does not seem like he is 20 years old.\u201dPresident Song nodded. He had thought the same. The gaze and aura he\u2019d noticed from Hyukjin was not something that could possibly come from a 20-year-old kid. His ability to manipulate the board was also outstanding, so much so that Kiyoung wanted the man as his hunting dog.\u2018No. He\u2019s not a hunting dog.\u2019Kiyoung had thought so before, but not anymore. Kim Hyukjin was not merely a hunting dog. If he had been born as one of Kiyoung\u2019s sons or grandsons, he might have become the ruler of Korea. That was how highly Kiyoung thought of him.\u201cIt seems to me that you having a guild vs. guild match with Kim Hyukjin\u2026 was planned from the start.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI get the feeling Player Kim Hyukjin crafted the current situation step by step, starting all the way from his participation in the Players Convention.\u201dSong Kiyeol nodded at that. It really stung his pride, but he still analyzed the situation with a cool head.\u201cI believe there\u2019s a high possibility of that being the case.\u201d\u201cHooh. You acknowledge it?\u201dPresident Song looked at his grandson with a look of slight surprise. Kiyeol looked like he wasn\u2019t that displeased by the fact that he had been dancing in his opponent\u2019s palm, something that would have angered and wounded anyone\u2019s pride. President Song was inwardly satisfied to see it.\u201cKim Hyukjin crushed us with an overwhelming difference in skill. He had us completely figured out and analyzed what we would do before the fight even started.\u201dIt was embarrassing to admit, but Kiyeol judged that nothing good would come of hiding things from his grandfather. His grandfather was someone who forgave mistakes and failures, but not lies.\u201cAs a result, the guild members of Taeguk Shield, including me, were pushed into a situation where we had no choice but to acknowledge him.\u201dSkills proved everything. That was likely what Kim Hyukjin wanted from the start.\u201cThe non-combat class Kim Hyukjin\u2019s movements\u2026 were truly beyond imagination.\u201d\u201cWas that all?\u201d\u201cNo, sir. His analysis was far more outstanding than the tactician on our side, Han Seokmin.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cThe fusion magic of Jo Sunghyun and Choi Sung-gu\u2026 had me honestly intimidated.\u201dHe was honest about everything. Being intimidated wasn\u2019t something to be ashamed of. It was natural to feel that way in front of someone far stronger than yourself. The important thing was what you learned from it, what you gained from it, that you didn\u2019t just wallow in defeat. Kiyeol was well aware that that was what his grandfather wanted to see from him right now.\u201cWas it a big spell?\u201d\u201cYes, I believe so. They didn\u2019t do anything in the beginning.\u201d\u201cI see. Kim Hyukjin\u2019s team must have bought them time to use that fusion magic.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPresident Song nodded. \u201cThey intentionally bought time to be able to use a big spell.\u201dThey\u2019d had the leisure to do so. In other words\u2014\u201cThey could have easily defeated you even without a big spell like that.\u201dAnd yet, they used a flashy and strong spell.\u201cIt must have been a completely calculated move to break your spirits.\u201d\u201c...Yes. I think so.\u201d\u201cYou said Jo Sunghyun and Choi Sung-gu met for the first time at the Players Convention, yes?\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cThe fact they could show a cooperative Play of that level must mean that Kim Hyukjin had them practice beforehand.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cWhich means he must have been preparing for today ever since the Hill of Blowing Wind. For the climax today.\u201dSong Kiyoung stared at his grandson for a moment. He saw that Kiyeol was biting his lip, unable to conceal a little anger.\u2018Good.\u2019He was well and properly stimulated by Hyukjin, a man ten years his junior. If he could apply this stimulus in a positive direction, his grandson would be able to become a far greater person.\u201cKim Hyukjin has already gathered teammates of that level and is nurturing them into their respective roles. Do you acknowledge that?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNot only that, but he chose to put you guys in the front and operate in the back. I\u2019m sure he intends on avoiding the public\u2019s excessive attention while garnering the actual profits. That will also greatly free up his movements. Then, by once again showing his overwhelming skills to other people of skill, he will reign as a skilled Player among Players.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t all.\u201cAnd by choosing to cooperate with you, he will also get access to Sungshin\u2019s support.\u201dPresident Song smiled faintly without realizing it. 20 years old. He was only 20 years old. A 20-year-old created this picture and was thinking of taking only the good and leaving others to deal with the bad. It was almost chilling. And because it was chilling, President Song was delighted.\u201cLearn from his discernment. People are the greatest resources. Learn from his mindset. You will gain much from working with him.\u201dKiyeol was inwardly shocked. His grandfather never encouraged learning from someone.Kim Hyukjin\u2026 was that amazing? A 20-year-old was that amazing in his grandfather\u2019s eyes? It stung his pride, but stubborn determination reared its head in him regardless.\u2018I\u2019ll learn what there is to learn.\u2019He would maintain a public system of cooperation with Kim Hyukjin, and learn everything he could learn. He believed that was his ticket to personal growth.\u201cWhile learning from Kim Hyukjin, I will fully cooperate with him to advance the new tech project.\u201dKiyeol didn\u2019t forget to make his aspirations clear.\u201cOne day, I will surpass Kim Hyukjin and lead Sungshin into the future.\u201d* * *Sunhwa wasn\u2019t all that talkative when other people were around, but when it was just the two of us, she tended to talk a little more. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was because of puberty, or because she was a shy girl by nature. In any case, she was noisier when it was just us.We got out of the taxi and started walking home, going through the large park we had to cross to reach the apartment building.\u201cOppa. Before you distributed roles to us earlier...\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYou heard another notice, right?\u201dDid it show? Well, it wasn\u2019t something I was trying to hide, anyway. I told her the truth.\u201cYeah. You know I have a title called First Pioneer, yeah?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cThat was upgraded to Pioneer of Victory.\u201d\u201cReally? Is that really awesome then? Even better than fried chicken?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost on par with fried chicken.\u201d\u201cWoah. It\u2019s huge then.\u201dI grinned in spite of myself. By clearing the linked hidden piece, \u2018Pioneer who Seized the First Victory\u2019, I was able to get the new title \u2018Pioneer of Victory\u2019.[Pioneer of Victory]A glorious title given to one who pioneered a new domain and seized the first victory in a new domain.All party members +20% EXPStacks with other titles.Stacks with other effects (buffs/debuffs).As soon as Sunhwa heard the title effects, her eyes grew round. She blinked in visible awe.\u201cWow\u2026 Oppa. Does that mean as long as we\u2019re in a party with you, we also get extra EXP?\u201d\u201cYep. But you have to stay within a certain distance.\u201dIt added wings to the Observer class that could rake in EXP even while sipping tea. No matter who it was, they could get 20% more EXP simply by Playing with me.\u2018It\u2019ll shine especially bright in the 30-40 period.\u2019An EXP buff, and one that applied to the entire party and could stack unconditionally with any effect, was an effect anyone and everyone would go crazy for.\u201cWith an effect like that, it really\u00a0is\u00a0on par with fried chicken.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201d\u201cOh yeah, oppa. Did you get something from that pretty unnie?\u201d\u201cYeah. I got a special poison item called Rot Water.\u201d\u201cDunno what that is, but it sounds weird.\u201d\u201cDoes it?\u201d I tousled Sunhwa\u2019s hair. \u201cLet\u2019s just go in and get some chicken.\u201dI took a look at Sunhwa\u2019s state. Her face was flushed with excitement.State: Happy / Proud / JoyousMe getting something good was a source of happiness and joy for her too. It was amazing. We didn\u2019t share a single drop of blood, but it felt like I really got a sister. Her happiness was infectious.This joy, I would protect it.Or more accurately, she would protect me.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
