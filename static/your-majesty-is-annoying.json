Falling frequently seemed to be a hobby at this point. Even jumping off a running carriage\u2026Honestly, in Lyle\u2019s eyes, it was a curious miracle that Medea was still alive and not dead.Did he say you fell off the balcony on the second floor this time? It\u2019ll break your neck if you fall.Seeing that there was no mention of the empress\u2019s death from the servant\u2019s mouth, she seemed safe again, but the servants only looked around without saying a word, \u201cYour Majesty\u2026 shouldn\u2019t you go see her?\u201dLyle picked up the bow irritably. Something was moving in the distance between the bushes. It seems to be a deer in size and form.\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of it yet,\u201d Lyle said, and his servants looked at each other.Lyle didn\u2019t even spare a glance at the frozen servant.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to replace that deer, you\u2019d better tame your mouth.\u201d The attendant quickly bowed, covering his mouth.Lyle held his arrow to the bow and aimed at the deer in the distance.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If Lyle, who went to bed and didn\u2019t embrace me, it\u2019s because I am ugly. If Lyle didn\u2019t sleep in the room because of a heavy workload\u2014he was actually rejecting me and advising me that I was too fat.Medea was hungry for Lyle\u2019s affection and used possible resource to obtain it.The Empress, who now considered herself fat, quickly dried up in three months.When Lyle, who could not stand it, banned fasting, Medea secretly threw up her food.Lyle refused to sleep with her, seeing Medea\u2019s emaciated state. When he declared that he would not sleep with her until she reached a certain weight, Medea reluctantly ate her food.When dieting was banned, she started to focus on the women around her.Medea was terrified that Lyle would have an affair.Many of the Emperor\u2019s maids were replaced with servants, and the maids who kept by his side were chosen because they were ugly.Controlling the castle didn\u2019t satisfy her, so she began to monitor and interfere with Lyle\u2019s every move inside or outside the palace.\u2018Have you seen that woman now?\u2019At that stinging remark, my blood dried up; it had been a while since I used a separate room because I didn\u2019t feel like it.At the request of nobility, at an appointed night, Lyle reluctantly shared his body without uttering a word.Medea complained that she was always lonely and distressed.Why don\u2019t you tell me I\u2019m beautiful or look at me with a sweet glaze? Even my screaming and begging don\u2019t seem to work. I want to depose Lyle twelve times a day, but instead, I\u2019m enduring without an end in sight.Medea\u2019s father, Duke Caird, was still the head of nobility and could fight against Lyle.There was the presence of his uncle, Archduke Rowendal.Duke Caird pretended to remain neutral and refused to rout Rowendal.If Rowendal was defeated, who would be next?\u201cUmm \u2026 .\u201dThe maids who were restlessly nursing Medea were startled.The eyelids covered with long eyelashes trembled and opened.Soon the blue eyes looked at them.The maid looked at Medea, trying to suppress the trembling of her fingertips. \u201cY\u2026 Your Majesty the Empress. Have you come to your senses?\u201dThen Medea showed an expression she had never seen before.She scanned the maid warily as if she was guarding herself. Her eyes seem to ask the maid, \u2018what\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019Intuitively, the maid felt something was wrong. \u201cYour Majesty?\u201dMedea blinked and looked at the maid. It was a beautiful face, even if it was often frowning or screaming. But the maid didn\u2019t know how many years it\u2019s been since she saw that face don such a calm expression.\u201cUh\u2026\u2026 me?\u201dThe maid swallowed dry saliva. She had been ready to receive the poison; the next words to come out of Medea\u2019s beautiful deathly lips would surely ask: \u201cDid you tell him to come?\u201dThe maid was trembling and wondered what possessed her to become a maid.No matter how much the Emperor hates the Empress, they are the first to suffer from the Empress\u2019s antics.\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026 Empress?\u201dMedea got up from bed in a hurry. The maids hurriedly grabbed her as she had just suffered a concussion and would be dizzy.Medea shook off the hands and grabbed her hair.Then with a frightened face, she said, \u201cLong hair!\u201dThen she pulled the hem of her dress and looked down, \u201cWhat\u2019s this dress\u2026 \u2026 . Huh, it\u2019s totally big.\u201dThen her hand came down and studied her waist and stomach. \u201cNo belly fat? I\u2019m thin? What\u2019s this\u2026\u201dI looked around with a stiff face.The high and magnificent ceiling paintings with sculptures of gods and heroes.A magnificent lobby? No, there\u2019s a bed\u2026..bedroom?!Even women dressed in medieval maid outfits\u2026. My eyes started to spin.Then she passed out. It was too much.The screams of \u201cEmpress!\u201d rang in the queen\u2019s bedroom.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lyle was so excited,\u201cIf she loses her memory, then I\u2019ll sleep in peace tonight!\u201d\u201cBecause you don\u2019t remember me, I won\u2019t have to hear the ranting of that delusional woman that I\u2019m hiding a woman in my bedroom.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no time for you to joke around. I think it\u2019s true this time.\u201dEven with Sid\u2019s grave tone, Lyle wasn\u2019t very trusting.Whenever Medea tried to commit suicide, she had lost her breath for a few moments and had \u2018died.\u2019\u201cMemory loss\u2026\u2026 Would the Empress be trying to make a ridiculous request regarding the couple\u2019s appearance\u2026 have you looked into it, and has she been checked?\u201d\u201cYes. Your Majesty should also come\u2026 \u2026\u201dBut Lyle\u2019s expression was cold. \u201cI can\u2019t heal her. If she truly does have amnesia, I would be a stranger, so it would be better not to show my face.\u201d\u201cHa, Your Majesty\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dLyle walked away with a face that said he didn\u2019t want to hear anymore. Sid chased after the emperor with a flustered look.Five days later, Lyle had to visit her even though he didn\u2019t want to.He was going to verify if she really lost her memory.I\u2019d rather sleep on that fifth day.Lyle asked Sid about today\u2019s schedule, erasing the disgusting Empress\u2019s face from his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No, it was very, very bad.And wtf the background is in the Middle Ages.Medieval settings fit movies and are suitable for novels, but there are no games, television, or web novels here!\u2018How do I live!?\u2019It was like a death sentence (I feel you chica if I didn\u2019t have the internet during quarantine\u2026 ekkk) for her, who looked forward to reading her web novels during her commute.\u2018I\u2019m addicted to web novels!\u2019 Medea shed tears of blood as she recalled a web novel that had not yet been completely read. (A moment of silence for all the promising and not completely translated web novels out there)It was regrettable that she had not read all the web novels before falling into the Middle Ages.Besides\u2026 \u2026 she died without spending all the money she had saved!This is the most annoying and infuriating fact.\u201cWhy am I dead?\u201dMy last memory was when I drank a bottle of bomber liquor and wine recommended by my boss at a dinner party.I was already in the middle of drinking my 18th cup and about to stop when that dog manager said, \u201cWon\u2019t it be hard on Oh Soo-Yeon if she can\u2019t be a full-time employee this time around?\u2019She smiled and recalled his face while he was recommending alcohol.Medea kicked off the blanket.I drank that one cup and I died! At that time, I should have ripped off his hair! After drinking that last cup, my eyes started spinning\u2026 \u2026 and I fell.After that, the other staff screamed, and before I completely blacked out, I saw the face of that dog manager\u2026 \u2026\u201d I\u2019m dead, so yeah, I\u2019m not alright!\u2026 Aren\u2019t you abusing your position and thanking the stars you won\u2019t be sued because I\u2019m an orphan? No\u2026nevermind \u2026 . My uncle is not a person that would miss this chance.\u201dSoo-Yeon\u2019s uncle was a terrible person.It was him who took the house in her parents\u2019 name and put her into an orphanage.When Soo-Yeon entered a well-known company as an intern, uncle contacted her as if nothing had happened before.\u2018Let\u2019s make do with garbage and put it in the dump.\u2019 The trash was her uncle and that dog manager.It was a sad tale of a distant country that could not even be shared, plus she had already died\u2026That\u2019s right, what\u2019s the meaning of possessing a web novel character suddenly?Medea was to jump off the balcony on the second floor and die\u2026 \u2026 Medea\u2019s soul may have disappeared, but Medea\u2019s body is still alive.She may have been a nominal empress but the plot already suffered a huge blow.The male protagonist, Lyle, was portrayed as a character with a slight case of misogyny due to his suffering at the hands of the concubines of his predecessor as a child and suffering from Medea as a teenager.He was reluctant to meet a new woman, so he tried to see to it that the Empress bore him a successor so he could stop relations as soon as possible.Oh crap, I can\u2019t do that. Are you telling me to have a baby?Su-Yeon, who has been single since birth, is virtually ignorant of love affairs. She read romance novels, but that didn\u2019t mean she wanted to date.Her desire for love was fulfilled by all the web novels and romance books consumed, so there was no reason to lean on reality. When her parents were alive, she tried her hand at unrequited love and flirted a bit here and there, but that all occurred when she was young and had her parents\u2019 security.After having to survive alone in the world, she gave up on her dream of romance; because of student loans, living expenses, and the glow of monthly rent.Love was considered a luxury.\u201cI can\u2019t date anyone here either. If I was going to do this, I would have been the protagonist or a mother character that starts with a baby\u2026 No, it\u2019s a good thing I didn\u2019t start as a beggar or slave.\u2019I\u2019ve read quite a few web novels that start with beggars or slaves.After suffering tremendous abuse and suffering for a long time, they meet the male protagonist or go out on their own.\u2018I don\u2019t have such energy.\u2019 (Mood)The fluffy bed was really comfortable.On top of it, Medea concluded she was ready fortunate to be in the Empress\u2019s body.I could have been much more miserable or unfortunate.The male protagonist Lyle hated Medea, but still treated her as Empress.It wasn\u2019t merely because Medea was a politically necessary entity; Lyle wasn\u2019t a bad guy either. He hated her for a good reason; Medea emotionally terrorized him.Still, Soo-Yeon had always liked and sympathized with Medea more than Lyle.Born as the eldest daughter of the Duke of Caiad, Medea was abused by her mother from an early age.She was a woman who was burning with the ambition to be Empress.The lecherous Emperor ended up giving as a reward to the Duke of Caird to settle that annoying ambition.But the method was cruel.From the moment Medea learned to speak, she had to learn imperial courtesy, and her diet was strictly controlled.There was nothing she didn\u2019t do to preserve her beauty and maintain her elegance and perfection; the Duchess whipped up her the only person she loved, the nanny, whenever Medea made a mistake.Even when she gained weight, stuttered, or stumbled during a dance, her nanny was beaten into a bloody pulp.It was useless for Medea to cry and beg. In the meantime, her nanny embraced and consoled her.Crying about her failures, for being fat, ugly, and ill-mannered, Medea was consoled by her nanny that she is the most beautiful girl in the world.But on the day Medea marries Lyle and becomes Empress, the Duchess accidentally kills the nanny.When Medea found out, she broke.It was then that Lyle showed meager polite affection for her.Being the sole person left in her life that showed her kindness, Medea became obsessed with him and began to display abnormal behavior.I still remember the scene where the nanny died.Medea\u2019s nanny begged the Duchess to send her to the young Empress. \u2018If I don\u2019t go, she\u2019ll be anxious.\u2019The Duchess was annoyed by such a nanny. She had never shown affection to Medea but was envious of Medea\u2019s possession of someone\u2019s love and loyalty in addition to her new title.\u201cHow dare you have such confidence!\u201d The Duchess whipped and clubbed the nanny to death.The Duchess ended up blaming Medea:\u2018It was her lousy luck to be with you.\u2019Medea was deeply scarred.Her nanny had praised her beauty, but she believed she was ugly and cursed.Even though she became the wife of Emperor Lyle and had power, wealth, status, and beauty, Medea was not happy and was still hungry.Lyle and Medea were both just young, traumatized fools with too much power. In addition to those stressors, Lyle was busy seizing power in order to survive in the cruel world of politics.Recalling the novel\u2019s length, comparatively, the actual explanation of Medea and her appearance was short-lived.The main character of was a knight. The main character was the Count\u2019s young lady, Seira, who becomes a crossdressing knight to protect her house and her brother Ian after the death of their father.At first, she plans to pretend she is Ian until he inherits the title, but when she gets involved with Lyle, her plans go awry.\u2018What will happen to the two because Medea is alive?\u2019The Emperor likes Seira and puts her by his side, and the people of Seira\u2019s county estate also try to hide her secret.They were a lovely group of weak people rooting for her.In the middle of the story, a bully shows up and threatens Seira with her secret. It was infuriating, but\u2026 \u2026 \u2018Can I help you with that? Ah- I don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019When I was alive, my purpose was to just hold on to my job. Then buy a house, save money for retirement, and then relax\u2026. \u2018I tried to find happiness by reading web novels until my death, but\u2026\u2026 I had only had a little more to go to finish the book\u2026 . Ugh\u2026 \u2026Medea, sulking and bowed her head while thinking, worried.Looking at the progression, the protagonist surely demanded a breakup from the male protagonist, who was cold-hearted because he was embarrassed by his obsession with her.Medea considered divorce.\u2018Is this an era where you can live properly as a divorcee?\u2019There is no electricity and no conveniences.It would be extremely uncomfortable and challenging to live in a world without basics like a washing machine and a gas stove.Now, she possessed the Empress and is living a luxurious life\u2026.. but what if she gets kicked out of here? Will the Duke truly accept her back?Scenario 1. She\u2019s driven out to the temple and lives as a nun for the rest of her life.Scenario 2. If the Duke doesn\u2019t accept her, Medea can become a commoner.Well. Is it bad\u2026 \u2026 . \u2018I\u2019ll have to look at the situation here and think about it.\u2019\u2018The room is not bad, and the maids I saw today were dedicated to Medea.Unless it was a situation where I had to give birth to the Emperor\u2019s child, I could get used to this. \u2026 .Since there are no web novels, I would like to live watching a love story for a lifetime\u2026 \u2026 . But I don\u2019t know if the novel here is to my taste.Ugh\u2026 \u2026 . My writers. I loved you so much.Thanks to you guys, I was really happy for a moment during my tough working life\u2026\u2026 While thinking those thoughts, Medea fell asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(or\u2026.. ABS!)Thanks to this, no assassin came to Lyle\u2019s bedroom, but Lyle had to lose sleep as he watched the search that took two or three hours every night.\u2018\u2026\u2026 She\u2019s really not coming.\u2019Lyle frowned while lying in bed, and it seems to be the time he had such a peaceful night since marrying Medea.When they shared a bed, she was always crying or enraged, and even when she inspected each room, she chastised Lyle for having a woman.What was the problem?During her engagement, she was mild and well-mannered. There was no sign of her instability.It was right after she went to the duchy after her marriage that she became strange.It was from then on, Medea started obsessing over Lyle.At the time, he couldn\u2019t pay attention to her for long because he was too busy fighting against his uncle.I\u2019m a little sorry about that, but\u2026\u2026\u2018If she lost her memory\u2026\u2026 Is she\u2026\u2026 Is the girl who looked nervously down at the back of my hand and who hiccuped\u2014is she back?\u2019It occurred to me that \u2018It doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u2019Even if she doesn\u2019t remember, everything she did doesn\u2019t disappear. Being hurt doesn\u2019t allow you to hurt others.She will continue to be the Empress, but Lyle decided he would have nothing to do with her heart.***The next day, the following day, and the successive day, Medea did not come to Lyle\u2019s room.Although her maids tried to halt gossip from circulating, rumors of the Empress\u2019s amnesia spread among the courtiers of the Imperial City.And some of the most noticeable things were the things that the Empress didn\u2019t do.For instance, there was no sign of the Empress harassing the Emperor, of a maid or attendant being kicked out of a room or slapped across the face.\u201cDoes she really have amnesia?\u201dLyle was walking down the hall, his face twisted.There was no movement from Duke Caird\u2019s side, showing his careless regard toward Milledia, but he wasn\u2019t wholly unconcerned about his daughter\u2019s safety.The Duke was the one who politically pressured the Emperor to share a bed with his daughter; because sharing a bed with the Emperor gave one higher importance in and outside the Palace.This made Lyle hate Medea more.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dThe voices of the maids who seemed to burst into tears came from afar.Lyle crumpled his face as soon as he heard the sound of \u201cEmpress!\u201dEven if it was only three days ago, she had a major concussion. It\u2019s a serious injury that would typically leave a noble lady lying in bed for at least a week.\u201cYour Majesty! Empress! Don\u2019t run! You shouldn\u2019t even take off your shoes!\u201d\u2018What?\u2019 Hearing, Lyle turned to the maids\u2019 words in disbelief.Medea was the incarnation of perfect etiquette. Every fingertip, every strand of hair was always in place.Lyle couldn\u2019t believe his eyes, as she had never violated the rules of etiquette.\u201cShut up, you stalkers! I want to be alone!\u201d said the stranger that resembled the Empress.She rolled up her skirt for easy running, and her strides were as broad and robust as a man\u2019s. Medea ran past Lyle, Sid, and several servants without a glance, as if she hadn\u2019t even seen them.The men looked at the Emperor mutely, holding their breath with bright faces.\u2018Are you crazy?\u2019 That\u2019s the only thought Lyle had in his head.But Medea staggered and fell forward, stepping on the hem of her skirt.Because she was the Empress and a lady in name, Lyle and all his men flinched forward as if to help.However before she could be helped, she grabbed at a suit of decorative armor from one side of the hall.The armor fell on top of Medea with a massive crash. With a fright, everyone screamed.\u201cYour Highness!\u201d\u201cAhhhh.. \u2026\u201dMiledia, covered in decorative armor, looked irritated.Lyle\u2019s eyes went wide when he registered that not only was she barefoot, but she had no makeup on.She was barefoot only when she went up to bed, but Lyle had never seen Mildia walk down the hall in slippers.Plus, her bare face\u2026!I had never seen her face without makeup before or after our marriage. Even when we first met\u2014even though she was 12 years old at the time!\u201cMedea?\u201dThe attendants and the maids hurriedly removed the armor around her. Still sitting on the floor, Medea slowly looked around. As if she was trying to find out who called her.Sly, she pretended as if she doesn\u2019t know who called her and is just trying to look for a hole to escape in.\u201cMedea.\u201dLyle sang in a low tone, wondering if she dared to ignore him, the maid quickly gave Medea a hint.Medea turned to Lyle with clear eyes as if she were looking at something unfamiliar; she looked him up and down and then fixed her gaze on his face again.\u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 The gaze was quite different from his recollection. Those twinkling eyes are like\u2026\u2018It\u2019s like a five-year-old looking at chocolate through the window of a candy shop.\u2019He realized it was a creepy analogy; Lyle coughed loudly to push the thought away.\u201cEmpress, what are you doing here?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe expression of Medea, who was recklessly sending a longing look, changed.Lyle was surprised again because she was clearly showing varied expressions.Until now, Medea always had strong expressions of contempt and hatred, but vague responses to anything else.\u201c\u2026 It was uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dWhen Lyle asked back in confusion, the maids exchanged anxious eyes.Lyle looked back at them, realizing that there was not only himself but also his lieutenants, Sid, and other officials.\u201cGo ahead first. I have something to say to the Empress.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d Sid and other officials expressed courtesy to Lyle and Milledia and withdrew.As they were utterly estranged from each other, Lyle looked back at the maids, not Milledia. They had a lot to say.\u201cI can\u2019t believe the Empress is running in the hallway of the Palace. What\u2019s going on here?\u201dNo one could persecute the Empress. Except for maybe the Emperor himself, Lyle.\u201c\u2026The Empress, Her Highness awoke, so I tried to do her hair and face as usual. But then suddenly, the Empress insisted that it wasn\u2019t necessary and stopped us. She said\u2026 she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, opened the door, and kept running\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat about the shoes?\u201d\u201cShe took off her indoor shoes\u2026 \u2026 she said they were uncomfortable to have shoes inside\u2026 running.\u201dThe maid said slowly, bowing her head as if she was too embarrassed to speak.Lyle could not believe her word even though there was visible evidence.\u201cReally, Empress?\u201d\u201c\u2026 .\u201dMedea felt like hiding in a mouse hole.Honestly, most of the cosmetics here are natural and have a similar color\u2026 \u2026 but the quality was much worse than modern cosmetics.When I put on makeup, my face was itchy, and powder flew away.There was an inflator device to shape hair, but why is it so heavy?It seemed strange that all the noble ladies weren\u2019t bald already.I put up with it for two days, but I wasn\u2019t even meeting with anyone, and so I just ran away in annoyance, but the maids chased me. They kept following me as I ran, and I took off my slippers because it was uncomfortable.\u201cIn the presence of His Majesty\u2026 I\u2019m ashamed of showing offense\u2026 ..and I\u2019m here\u2026 .. asking you to please forgive me.\u201dI squeezed out words based on what I read in web novels.But it was difficult to speak these words, and it was hard to get the itch out of her mouth, so Medea spoke while turning her head away.Lyle frowned. \u201cWhere are you looking at, Empress?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m too ashamed to face you.\u201d\u2026 The horse was a good talker, but Lyle couldn\u2019t believe a word.Lyle, impatient, approached Medea and turned her head. It wasn\u2019t a rough touch, but Medea looked at Lyle with a shocked face. As if she didn\u2019t know Lyle would touch her.Lyle looked down at Medea with a slight sense of embarrassment.Medea shut her mouth tightly and glared.\u201cI was wrong.\u201dI never recalled one time where she admitted that she had done something wrong.She always blamed and accused Lyle.It was because he didn\u2019t give me love, because he didn\u2019t laugh, and because he didn\u2019t come\u2026.It was as if someone who resembled her was pretending to be the Empress\u2026 or twins were reversed \u2026\u201cStand up.\u201dLyle ordered, it was annoying to see Medea still sitting on the floor.The attendants and the maids quickly supported Medea up. Two maids put her shoes on, and Medea got up, brushed off her dress as if it was insignificant.The maids were also grooming her clothes, but it was strange to see.\u201cEmpress,\u201d Lyle impulsively called Medea.Medea reacted late. As if the name Empress was not hers.\u201cDo you really not remember anything?\u201dA complicated look flashed through her beautiful face. An embarrassed face that was apologetic, confused and as if it couldn\u2019t be helped, Medea affirmed.Even though her eyes told him otherwise, Lyle felt as if he was being deceived for some reason.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you when you must be busy with your work. If you have nothing further to say, I\u2019ll see you.\u201dI bow politely and wait. It wasn\u2019t perfect etiquette, but it was rare for Medea to say that she would go first.Lyle frowned and said, \u201cYes. Go ahead.\u201dWhen he allowed it, she quickly turned away coldly. Lyle watched Medea walk away for a while with a thoughtful face.\u201cHis Majesty\u2019s eyes were hot when he looked at Her Highness\u2026\u201dTo the maid carefully spoken words, Medea shuddered.\u201cI\u2019m mistaken.\u201d\u2018Oh crap, did you hate me already?\u2019While her throat burned with a sense of crisis, the maids kept watching Medea face and spoke even more ridiculous words.\u201cIsn\u2019t His Majesty concerned about your illness\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Majesty seems to be worried about your Majesty, the Empress.\u201dMedea looked back at the maids with a frown. As if they were awakened,\u2019 Hyuk!\u2019 they stopped smiling.\u201cI\u2019m going to the library, so don\u2019t let anyone approach it.\u201d\u201cAre you going to the library again?\u201d\u201cFor health, one should take a walk once a day.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a long way to the library.\u201dResponding in a flat tone, Medea started walking.She looked back at the following maids and said, \u201cDo not enter the library. Do not open the door until I call you.\u201dAs she entered, Medea shook her head. I am grateful to the maids, but every five minutes, they asked me if there was any inconvenience.She felt burdened and uncomfortable to be waited on by maids. It was natural for her to bring her own water and dress herself.\u201cYour Majesty, if you walk so\u2026\u201dWhile she was lost in thought, he must have walked quickly without realizing it. The poor maid advised Medea.\u2018If I keep acting rude, will Lyle dethrone me? Or confine me?\u2019But neither action was fit for the novel\u2019s male lead.The reason he did not become Medea\u2019s supporting strength was simply because he did not know.Lyle didn\u2019t know that Medea was ill. He never knew that she was abused as a child,If Medea had asked for help, Lyle would have protected her thoroughly.\u2018Well, I think you might be a little eccentric.\u2019 Lyle was such an emperor.He was an emperor who had no blood or tears and could be cruel, but he worked hard to be generous to his own people.It was also against such loyal consciousness that Medea wasn\u2019t already deposed even though she tormented him.\u2018Because she was my person. I thought I should protect her.\u2019\u2018Since Lyle is her\u2014err my husband, I might be able to do something about that.\u2019Brought out of her thoughts, Medea was told that she breached some rule of etiquette while walking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you going to visit?\u201dLyle sighed.It seems that Medea has become a completely different person he doesn\u2019t know.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen what are you worrying about? Is it because the union night is in two days\u2019 time?\u201dFor a moment, Lyle was confused and then stunned.I was so preoccupied with Medea that completely I forgot that the day of our union was approaching.Sid nodded as if he was troubled.\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t remember\u2026 \u2026 she may refuse.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s her duty as Empress. She won\u2019t reject it.\u201dI replied, irritated.But to my annoyance, Sid\u2019s expression seemed to say, \u2018Is that so?\u2019\u201cBut it didn\u2019t seem to me that she even remembered etiquette. It is even questionable whether something like the Empress\u2019s duty remains in her head now.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u2026\u201dThinking about Milledia already gave Lyle a headache, now it feels like there\u2019s already another problem he will stress out about.Lyle became very uncomfortable.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and take a look?\u2019\u201cIt seems like someone wants me to be close to the Empress.\u201d\u201cHer Majesty, the Empress has changed. That\u2019s a good enough reason.\u201dSid, who answered in an even tone, met Lyle\u2019s glare.The Duke of Caird was not entirely on Lyle\u2019s side, even though their political views were consistent. Perhaps if there were a son between Lyle and Medea, he would be a loyal ally of Lyle\u2019s, unless Lyle abused her greatly.He might even be willing to deal with Lyle\u2019s uncle, Lord Rowendal.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to be with the empress anyway?\u201dLyle did not intend to dethrone Medea even if he did wonder if she was infertile.I have no intention of adding another task to my pile of burdensome responsibilities like having an affair or taking in a concubine.The former Emperor had too many affairs, mistresses, and concubines\u2014his innumerous infidelities had shocked the country.Fortunately, the Emperor had only one woman, but rumors spread that the Emperor was cursed because of the his father\u2019s excesses.\u201cI\u2019m not reluctant.\u201dJust like you have to drink medicine, Lyle thought of Medea as something bitter that must be swallowed and used. Well, not even a must-swallow treatment. Medea was only bitter. That\u2019s what Lyle felt for Medea.I almost spat in my tea.In a voice that barely swallowed and choked, Medea asked:\u201cUnion day?\u201dHer voice increased a couple of notches, loud enough to ring in the room.The maid-in-waiting looked at Medea with an expression that wanted to point out her lack of propriety.After losing her memory, she became like a child.She is the highest woman in the Empire, the mistress of the imperial family. Additionally, if her memory comes back, she was also the woman who would point out everything the maids had done and discipline them harshly.\u201c\u2026You are the mistress of the Imperial Palace, and you have an obligation to continue the imperial family line and bear it\u2019s heir and descendants.\u201dIn the novel, Medea was only portrayed as a dead empress, but there was no such story of the joint nights.Medea, who thought that Lyle would never come to her bedroom because of their estranged relationship, was embarrassingly bewildered.\u201cBut\u2026 \u2026 But I don\u2019t remember His Majesty!\u201d\u201cYou can think of it as the first night.\u201dIt was the first night in many ways.But Medea shook her head.\u201cNo. I\u2019m not in that condition. I fell off the second floor and still have a concussion!\u201d\u201cHis Majesty also witnessed your Majesty running down the hall.\u201dWhen the Emperor, who was staring with his mouth open, came to mind, the maid became more embarrassed.\u2018She wasn\u2019t like this\u2026 \u2026 .\u2019\u201cChit. Is there any other way\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dIf it were Medea before she lost his memory, she would have been anxiously waiting for the union night. And her tension and anxiety would have been relieved by grabbing and pulling at the maids as if they were rats.After recalling the memories of that time, the maid in waiting thought things were better now. The Empress\u2019s attitude seemed to be softer than before.\u201cHis Majesty is a very chivalrous man. So don\u2019t worry, just follow His Majesty\u2019s lead\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIf he had been really a chivalrous man, he would have stopped by at least once to see his sick wife\u2019s condition, but the criticism was swallowed.Lyle not coming to see her was a good thing while she was new in Medea\u2019s body.\u2018Ah\u2026 do I have to run away\u2026\u2019Medea sank on the sofa with a tired face. Even if you run away, where would you go?I couldn\u2019t figure out what this world was like in the perfectly coordinated imperial palace.She knew she was perfectly protected because she was an Empress.What is the level of security in this world? Is it safe to walk out in the streets? If you run away and get a job, what kind of job can you get? What about your identity? Won\u2019t they ask for your ID?Tens of thousands of worries and thoughts were in my head.As I started my day with a web novel and ended the day with a web novel, my imagination took off. The branches of my thoughts continued to spread out continuously, depending on various scenarios, and the endless possibilities grew.\u201cHow secure is it in the capital city? Is it safe even if a lady doesn\u2019t carry an escort?\u201dWhen Medea suddenly asked this, the maid-in-waiting turned pale.It wasn\u2019t hard to guess what the Empress was thinking, even if she had changed noticeably in just a few days.\u201cIt\u2019s never safe. You could be kidnapped and sold to traffickers in no time!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Isn\u2019t lying to the royal family worthy of a severe punishment?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re a regular child, you could be safe. But you are the most beautiful woman in the Empire.\u201dThe maid-in-waiting ignored her beating heart, trembling nerves and managed to speak in a confident, calm tone.\u201cYour beauty is not obscured by disguise. Please consider the difficulties of those who serve you.\u201dMedea frowned at the maid bowing gracefully.\u2018You seem certain that I\u2019ll run away from home. Well\u2026\u2026 If it\u2019s dangerous as a woman, you can dress like a man\u2026.\u2019The maid was nervous as she watched Medea\u2019s twinkling eyes. She was worried about the Empress, who had made so many mistakes. Thinking so, she dilberated about whether she should increase the number of her servants.\u2018Maybe we increase the number of guards and escorts by telling His Majesty!\u2019While thinking of many things, the maid informed the Empress that she had finished preparing for her bath.The day of the union was the next night, but the original Medea reportedly had to undergo a skincare regimen starting from the day before.\u2018Tomorrow is the problem. How do we avoid it? Are you sure you won\u2019t die if you refuse? Um\u2026\u2026 should I just close my eyes and get it over with? Even if you do this and that, you\u2019re still very handsome. Plus, he\u2019s the male lead\u2026..\u2019Meh! Where\u2019s my pride? I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m falling into this world\u2019s way of thinking where women\u2019s rights are weak.It was the worst.If I was going to possess someone, couldn\u2019t it have been a body with some ability?There is no answer to my questions.Meh, I don\u2019t even have the motivation\u2026\u2026\u2019 (Girl, I feel you I haven\u2019t even died or lost my internet connection and I\u2019m depressed af)Medea sighed as she headed to the bathhouse with her maids.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Usually, Medea would have been awkwardly waiting in bed for him. Lyle sighed deeply. Spending the night with Medea was not easy.Even during those moments, she had many demands, complaints, and resentment.\u2018Why haven\u2019t you depose me?\u2019Of course, there was a political issue. But Lyle knew how to politically maneuver around risks to get what he wanted.It had neither to do with his ability nor to do with his power to do so.The First Empress.He must have been unable to do so because he thought of his mother, whom he had witnessed being tormented and poisoned by the eighteen other concubines.\u2018I have a hunch that it\u2019s going to be annoying.\u2019In front of the queen\u2019s bedroom, maids and escort knights were standing by. When the maid-in-waiting saw Lyle, the Emperor, she bowed down.\u201cWhat about the Empress?\u201dWhen he asked with a dry voice, the maid-in-law bowed her head and said:\u201cShe is in bed.\u201dYou\u2019re not sleeping first, are you?\u201d It was possible when I thought of her running through the hallway. But isn\u2019t she Medea? Lyle erased the thought that came to mind.\u201cI\u2019m going in. Stay back.\u201dLyle went into the room without noticing the attendants bowing. When the emperor entered the bedroom, the maids quietly closed the door.The Empress\u2019s bedroom was utterly calm and quiet. When the Emperor was coming, a few lanterns and candles were lit, and a faint light flowed.Lyle walked straight to the bed and pulled open the curtains expecting Medea but the Empress was nowhere to be seen.\u201cMedea?\u201dThere was no answer.Could it be\u2026. Is she hiding?No, no, no\u2026. she\u2019s the Empress. There was no reason to hide from himself, her emperor, and husband.\u201cMedea!\u201dLyle annoyingly called her name and felt his nerves on edge.That alarm spread quickly. He started to check throughout the spacious bedroom; he was a Sword Master and was sensitive to instinct; he promptly turned around, ensuring no one was in the room.He was dumbfounded. The Empress had ran away. To avoid sharing his bed.Irritated, Lyle was inclined to go straight back to his bedroom, but he held it in.His opponent was sick. The fact that Medea had amnesia in an accident from her suicidal attempt should not leak out.Lyle opened the bedroom door and looked at the maid and escorts.\u201cThe Empress is not in the room. She seems to be wandering somewhere\u2026 \u2026 bring her here quickly.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d The frightened maid-in-waiting squeaked, ready to make a thousand excuses.Lyle was not interested and closed the door with a sharp *Bang!* He closed the door, went to bed, and plunged into it.\u2018I have to wait for her\u2026 \u2026\u2019He felt like a beggar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nope. Nada. It\u2019s impossible!\u2019I ended up doing it anyway.I had exhausted all my tactics before I made that decision. I even tried to tell my maid-in-waiting, \u201cI have a cold\u201d excuse. But she wasn\u2019t fooled by my reason.I knew that she wouldn\u2019t accept my concussion as an excuse.So this was what I came up with:\u201cYour Majesty didn\u2019t come, so I sneaked out and got lost while trying to find you because you didn\u2019t come!\u2019\u2026 \u2026 Being coy and lying while trying to pass off such a weak excuse as truth is hard, but it makes sense for now.The only thing left to figure out was where I could spend the night while hiding covertly.If I caught in the middle, this would all come to naught.The question is, how do I avoid the next bed-sharing day even if I manage to avoid it today\u2026 \u2018Let\u2019s focus on the immediate problem now, well\u2026 \u2026 . \u2018Hick!\u2019Medea hurriedly hid behind a pillar at the sound of guards running,After confirming that the sound of the steps had faded away, Medea sneaked out from behind the pillar, spied the end of the corridor, and quietly tip-toed away.There wasn\u2019t such a thing as being too cautious in such a big palace when she had no idea how many people roamed these halls.Soon she had to hide again. Why did the people suddenly increase?\u2018Is it because of me? Maybe they discovered that I have disappeared.\u2019Earlier, Medea had been left alone in the bedroom. Knowing that no one would enter her room but the Emperor on this night meant he had already arrived at the bedroom and discovered that she had escaped.Medea glanced out the window. The night was already deep, and the moon had already passed it\u2019s zenith.Even as a modern person without a watch, I could that it was late.\u2018You jerk, you only arrived now?\u2019It was probably close to 1 am.He must have been trying to arrive as late as possible.I admit that Medea was a terrible bully, but it took two to tango when it came to relationships.\u201cWell, whatever, it works out for me. With this, if I\u2019m lucky, I\u2019ll even get deposed.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Do you really want to get locked up in a temple like that?\u201dI didn\u2019t anticipate a creepy voice appearing behind my back with such horrifying timing.Medea flinched and leaped away in fright.\u201cWh-who?

In short, through the window.Seeing the natural escape route from the window, railing, and balcony, Lyle immediately went out of the window and followed Medea\u2019s trail.The thought of Medea traversing this dangerous way, in a skirt no less, aggravated me.Yeah, I wasn\u2019t angry or worried. It didn\u2019t matter to me if she died, so why would I be mad?However, I am annoyed to be put in this embarrassing situation of having to search the Imperial Palace after a run-away Empress in the middle of the night.. \u2026 .\u201cIt seems even now you are looking for an escape and trying to run away.\u201dLyle was so thunderstruck he thought for a moment his soul was going to ascend to heaven.\u201cWhy am I, the Empress, alone in this place? Am I forgetting my identity?\u201dMedea could die from embarrassment, but upon seeing Lyle\u2019s angry visage, decided to use her prepared-in-advance \u201cgetaway\u201d card early.She continued with her rehearsed excuse.\u201cI remember being worried because you didn\u2019t come no matter how long I waited, so I went to search for you.\u201d\u201cAlone? In the middle of the night?\u201d\u201cBecause there was the possibility of you not coming, and I didn\u2019t want to attract humiliating rumors.\u201d So I sneaked out without a maid or guard; this was the alibi Medea had spun. It was watertight while pointing some blame at him. Lyle couldn\u2019t be mad after this.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the path to my office.\u201d\u201cOh, really?! My memory is incomplete, and I got lost. The Imperial Palace during the day and the Imperial Palace at night are different.\u201dWhat a shameless lie.This point did not change significantly before or after losing her memory.Lyle frowned.\u201cYou could have asked for directions.\u201d\u201cBut if I did, it would have surely caused a big commotion. I wanted to avoid the attention.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it night?\u201dThe sight of Medea not losing a word between them filled Lyle with anger.\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I unintentionally made your Majesty uncomfortable.\u201dLyle watched Medea politely bowing her head to apologize.Even though it was a blatant lie, between her smooth-talking and plausible deniability, and the futility in arguing over it, Lyla decided to leave it be for now.\u201cIt\u2019s very late.\u201dLyle spit out coldly.

You devotedly went to look for me. Don\u2019t worry; today, I will make sure you will have children.\u201dI shouldn\u2019t have gone there.Medea reflexively took a couple of steps back.Seeing her thus, Lyle narrowed his eyes in contentment. \u201cHmm? What\u2019s wrong, Empress? You don\u2019t want to run away from me, do you?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 \u2026 . Hahaha\u2026 \u2026 .no way.

Maybe her words were too bizarre.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re saying that\u2026 \u2026 I\u2019ll have to show you closer.\u201d Lyle strode towards Medea, and she instinctually stepped back again.Then the Emperor\u2019s eyes, looking at Medea, sank coldly.\u201cEmpress.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cYour words and actions are different.\u201dMedea hurriedly searched the ground for an answer and then quickly changed her words.\u201cMy body smells bad\u2026 \u2026 I\u2019m afraid to offend your Majesty.\u201d\u201cYou smell?\u201dLyle laughed icily as he looked at Medea.Then he continued walking towards her in big strides.Medea retreated and held both of her hands out.\u201cOh, don\u2019t come!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see if it smells or not.\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t need to! Totally bad smell -completely nasty\u2026 \u2026 . Ahhhhhh!\u201dAs Lyle got closer, Medea couldn\u2019t stand it and started running away. Lyle, seeing her treat him like a creep, made him furious.Lyle snatched Medea\u2019s runaway waist and pulled her into his arms.Let\u2019s see what you smell like!From the body of Medea, only the delicate fragrance of the flowers \u2014light and clear came out. The Duke must have sent his favorite incense to her. But something was distinctly different. Medea\u2019s own scent was mixed, and it felt strangely weird and sweet. \u2026 something changed.Every two weeks, Lyle had joined Medea in bed. No matter how uncomfortable and irritating it felt, Lyle did it so without strain on Medea\u2019s body.But it was the first time he smelled something like this. Lyle felt his body heating up and blushed.\u201cY-Your Majesty\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d a flustered Medea was struggling in his arms. An unsettling sensation washed over me. It was so sudden it made me hold my breath and pause. Isn\u2019t this woman Medea? But why\u2026 it hit me.\u201cDid you use an aphrodisiac again?\u201dMedea had said in the past that she didn\u2019t like Lyle\u2019s reaction and had used aphrodisiacs secretly more than once.When she was caught, he had skipped a couple of union nights, and she had never used them again. Or so he thought.But when Lyle met Medea\u2019s eyes, she had a look of genuine puzzlement. The woman in front of him didn\u2019t even try to be hugged by her husband.\u201c\u2026 Do you know, Empress, you are elbowing my chest right now?\u201d\u201cI have eyes to see. Get off\u2026 \u2026 . God!\u201dLyle, looking down at Medea in disapproval, still embraced her.The eyes of the attendants widened as they watched the two with lanterns on.Lyle asked the attendant with an irritable face.\u201cWhat happened to the bedroom?\u201d* * *Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lyle strode behind him, hugging embarrassed Medea.\u201cI-I, Your Majesty!\u201d\u201cQuiet.\u201dSpeaking in a cold voice, Lyle tried to focus and maintain this sensation he now feels. It occurred to him that he could forego this bitter ritual in the future and make it unnecessary if they bore a child.The attendant guided them to a nearby bedroom. The door was already open, and there were already escorts and maids waiting at the door. Medea hid her head, unable to face them.As if the current situation wasn\u2019t bad enough, being hugged by Lyle this whole time made me feel embarrassed to death.Lyle, bringing Medea in tow, went into the bedroom without looking at them.\u201cHiccup!\u201dMedea turned pale when she saw the bedroom door shut without a sound. Lyle walked straight to the bed, dragging her with him.\u201cY-Your Majesty!\u201dLyle looked at Medea, frowning with his handsome eyebrows. Lyle went to bed and put Medea down on the bed in a surprisingly gentle manner.She felt relieved that she wasn\u2019t thrown on it but was surprised to see Lyle\u2019s face getting closer.Reflexively she captured his face with both of her hands.For a moment, a spark of fire flickered in Lyle\u2019s red eyes.\u201cEmpress\u2026\u2026 what are you doing now?\u201d\u201cOh, uh\u2026\u2026 you\u2019re handsome again today. Your Majesty,\u201d Lyle was bolder than ever.Feeling a sense of crisis getting closer and closer, Medea hugged Lyle\u2019s neck tightly so that he couldn\u2019t kiss her. Lyle thought for a moment with a disorganized face contemplating what was this all about.\u201c\u2026 Does the Empress desire an embrace more than a kiss?\u201dHe hugged her with a powerful force. His arms wrapped around her shoulders and waist and his body wholly adhered to hers.\u201cHiccup-ik!\u201dMedea wriggled in Lyle\u2019s arms in burning shame.\u201cE-e-eexuse me!\u201d\u201cAre you requesting I go there now?\u201dThe Lyle growled with a low subdued voice.Medea stopped moving with a \u2018Hic!\u2019 Lyle, who put Medea down on the bed, stared at her from a short distance.Medea blankly blinked at him, looking down at her, stunned by the sight. With his black hair hanging over, the emperor was just as beautiful as Medea\u2014abet in his manly, dark and broody sort of way.His straight forehead, sharp nose, and red lips were so beautiful that even beautiful women would be envious. On top of that, his masculine lines gave a dominant feeling.\u2018Wow, wow\u2026 \u2026\u2019Overwhelmed by Lyle\u2019s magnificence, even at such a dangerous moment, Medea couldn\u2019t help be breathless, admiring him oblivious to the echo of blood rushing in her ears.Lyle peered at a seemingly calm Medea, grabbed her chin, and stroked her lips with his thumb. \u2018Is she about to sleep?!\u2019A tongue pierced through the crevice between her lips.* * *Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All her memories really had disappeared. Including all \u2018first memories\u2019 that they had together were gone.Even so, Medea\u2019s attitude was too strange.Lyle remembered his first relationship with Medea. They married when she was sixteen, and he was nineteen, but he did not touch her until she was twenty.Lyle was molested and sexually abused since childhood by the Emperor\u2019s concubines.They had thought since Lyle had the same coloring as the Emperor that they could bear his child and pass it off as the Emperor\u2019s direct child.He feared telling the Emperor and earning his wrath, so Lyle had suffered in silence. Eventually, the First Empress, enraged upon finding out the truth, called them all and ordered them to drink poison.Thanks to her, he was able to escape their clutches, but the scars on his heart remained long after.Even as he grew up, his repulsion and fear of women had persisted. So Lyle refused to have sexual relations with Medea, with the excuse that she was too young.As a young couple, at first, they had slept in the same bed with nothing more than a light hug.Until the day she turned 20. That night she had lightly drugged him and forced him. That was the first night they had.Lyle clearly remembered Medea\u2019s face, looking triumphantly from above him. Her face overlapping with the former Emperor\u2019s concubines, Lyle couldn\u2019t bear to be affectionate. Her eyes were so distorted.\u201cHaaa\u2026 .\u201dMedea\u2019s panting lips were soaked in Lyle\u2019s saliva, shining bewitchingly. \u2018I want to kiss her again,\u2019 Lyle, who inadvertently had that thought, was baffled and ashamed by his bizarre impulse.He started to loath himself for these sentiments. It was dangerous. He would get hurt. And Medea was dangerous. And wasn\u2019t she Medea?* * *Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They only had each other to produce an heir.\u201cMedea.\u201dWhen he called her name, Medea glanced up at Lyle.Lyle was shocked by her lovely hazy dewy eyes.That Medea looks lovely! It was evident that my head was weird! For a moment, he was struck dumb by his thoughts\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sleep with me anymore if we have a child. I won\u2019t look for you anymore, so don\u2019t reject me.\u201d Neither did Lyle want to find Medea.At Lyle\u2019s words, Mildia looked at him breathlessly and seemed to be pondering for a moment.\u2018You really don\u2019t seem to remember.\u2019Medea was contemplating whether or not she could get out of this situation.It was the Middle Ages with no electricity or subway. They say there\u2019s magic, but she\u2019s no magician. She was only a daughter of an influential aristocrat who had no skills\u2014only lucky enough to have an outstanding appearance\u2014the only quality she could take outside the palace. Plus, she wasn\u2019t even the protagonist.Could she reject the Emperor and escape the palace?I have longed for the strong heroine of the novel. But they were the ones who had unlimited amounts of potential and luck that the writer gave them in a fictitious world.My reality is different. It was cold and unforgiving. No. It was so cruel that it made me shudder.She was not an innocent child who believed in luck.\u2018I\u2019m not the protagonist,\u2019 she thought.Without the protection of her father, the Duke, or the Emperor, she was no better than a powerless child stranded on an island.It would be too predictable that as soon as she stepped outside, her eye-catching appearance would gain her too much attention, and she would be kidnapped and sold into slavery.When analyzing her inevitable doom, Medea\u2019s face became bitter.I don\u2019t want the Emperor\u2019s favor, but I have a huge advantage of staying here.Medea recalled the comfort of the Imperial Palace, Lyle\u2019s handsome countenance, and his gentle manner that was described in the novel: \u2018I won\u2019t be rough.\u2019If I tolerated this night, I could spend my whole life comfortably.I wondered, \u2018Is this okay?\u2019 My moral compass was spinning in confusion.But on the other hand, I was curious.Here was a well-praised hero, as described in the novel, so it was unlikely that it would be the worst night ever.It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have any resistance or shame, but really, this was already somewhat determined.It was fortunate that Lyle tried to persuade me and not force me.\u201cThen\u2026\u2026 please don\u2019t hurt me\u2026\u201dLyle sucked in his breath at a flustered Medea, who hesitantly replied without making eye contact.She was like a completely different woman.The Medea he knew never showed this expression.\u201cYes.\u201dLyle reached out to Medea.\u201cI promise,\u201d he whispered, slowly kissing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I couldn\u2019t stand it until the dress was all undone.Lyle had the thought that he had never been so excited, but soon he couldn\u2019t entertain thoughts anymore.As Medea reclined, Lyle started to go up her skirt.He felt Medea\u2019s \u201coooh\u201d s and gasps as he pulled down her inner skirt.Lyle\u2019s rough palm slowly caressed and fondled her thigh.Medea felt her heart beating like crazy.Do I like it? Or is it disgusting?All I knew is that I was trembling.\u2018Is it okay to do this?\u2019The Emperor is the Hero and belonged to Seira, but as long as Medea was in the picture, nothing would go the way it was supposed to due to Lyle\u2019s nature.I can\u2019t believe I am going to sleep with Lyle.\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Seira. I have first insure my life and then see what will happen.\u2019At least Seira had a talent with the sword. Other than her pretty face, Medea was useless.I didn\u2019t know if the Duke loved his daughter but Medea\u2019s brother\u2026 \u2026 Oh, he followed her around a lot.He was a sub hero who accused Medea of being killed by the Emperor and tried to take Seira away.As Medea was preoccupied with her thoughts, Lyle\u2019s fingers reached the space between her thighs.In front of her tightly closed knees, Lyle was silent for a moment.\u201c\u2026 Medea.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dMedea responded with a clueless and absentminded face.Irked, Lyle looked down at Medea.\u201cOpen your legs.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dMedea hesitated and spread her legs a little.Then Lyle grabbed Medea\u2019s thighs and spread them wide.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Medea was startled.Lyle was embarrassed when he realized that she was barely wet. The past Medea would be wet enough at this point.\u2018Oh, no, if you try it now, it\u2019ll be painful.\u2019However, further delay would have put Lyle in trouble.Lyle traveled back and forth between the cracks with delicate fingertips.Dampening his fingers where it began to get wet slowly, he moved as if he had applied the sap on the petals.It was the first time someone had touched it, so it was more stimulating. With her cheeks dyed, Medea endured.\u201cHee!\u201dFingers came in and out without warning.Now Lyle was in a hurry. But if Medea got hurt now, she would cry and run away from the bedroom.\u2018I don\u2019t have feelings for her, but forcing someone with no memory to embrace me is detestable too.\u2019\u201cAhhhh\u2026Oh! Ah\u2026. There\u2026\u201d\u201cHere?\u201dWhispering, Lyle rubbed the area where Medea had reacted to.Medea\u2019s bouncing waist made Lyle strangely hot.She was avoiding his eyes as if embarrassed but also tried to tolerate the discomfort.While Lyle bent his fingertips and wandered from place to place, he tried to teach her all the pleasing places. Lyle felt possessed, engrossed in Medea\u2019s secrets, which began to melt away her reluctance as she started to moan and purr through her nose.\u2018Something\u2026\u2019It didn\u2019t feel bad.No, in fact, it felt terrific.\u201cHeee!\u201dIt was at that moment, Lyle dug as deep as his fingertips could reach. Medea, startled, tightened her secret place.With a sensual touch that made her shudder with pleasure, Lyle instinctively taunted the place.\u201cAh, ah\u2026 \u2026 ! Uhhh\u2026.\u201dLyle didn\u2019t relent, as a sweet look colored Medea, struggling with embarrassment.He quickly loosened her narrow passage and stretched his fingers, making room for two and then three.\u201cUhhhh.\u2026!\u201dThe obscene stimulus made Medea\u2019s eyes flushed and hazy as she flustered and reddened.What kind of facial expression would Medea make if I pushed myself in here?At his stimulating thought, Lyle swallowed his dry saliva.

In the past, her allure had been erased by her harsh words and overbearing actions.\u201cAhh! It\u2019s hot\u2026\u201dMedea murmured as she rubbed against his penis, applying her flowing liquid. Why was her whispering to herself so provocative?Lyle couldn\u2019t take it and pushed his the head of his member into her entrance with a blurry expression.The narrow and hot texture seemed to resemble the Medea that Lyle remembered, but it was completely different. Lyle clenched his teeth, intoxicated by the melting sweet stimulus.\u201cHuuunn\u2026.\u201dMedea was trembling with delicate, small shivers under the pressure.Lyle couldn\u2019t get rid of the feeling that it was as if he was embracing her for the first time.As Lyle\u2019s stiffness slowly entered her deeper and deeper, a hotter pressure began to build up.Medea lips were swollen, and her heavily lidded, blurred eyes pleaded at him.\u201cUhh, more\u2026 no more\u2026.\u201dSweating from holding himself back, Lyle couldn\u2019t help but grin from the grievance of such an alluring enticement. The look in his eye held a devilish mischievousness.\u201cReally? Is that so?\u201dHe pushed his penis to the root.Whooo! Moaning, Medea lowered her head to the side. Lyle tried to search her eyes to see if she was in pain as he kept still in her tightness.\u201cMedea. Millie\u2026.\u201dEven nicknames that I had never sung before flowed through my lips.Medea, who was swallowing a groan with her cheeks dyed, glanced at Lyle.She looked so adorable that Lyle grabbed Medea\u2019s cheek and kissed her hurriedly.Medea fluttered in Lyle\u2019s arms with his coveted kiss.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dHer wet flesh that was swallowing his organ to its roots.

At the deepest thrust, he poured out his semen, and Medea felt his liquid fulling her up.I knew he was going to ejaculate inside, but it was different to feel it directly.

Last night\u2019s Medea was cute as ever \u2026.I don\u2019t want to admit it, but to a certain extent, no, I thought it was very, very lovely.Maybe he wanted to make sure and see how Medea, who had spent a hot night with him, would face him the next day.If Medea had the same old reaction as before, it seemed that this tickling feeling he had begun to harbour would immediately disappear.Therefore, this was the only foolproof plan to eliminate these mysterious feelings before he realizes what it is.Lyle made this excuse and hurried to put his ass back on the sofa.Medea started to wake, her eyelids still heavy, and her eyes foggy. She looked around with a faint look.Her half-sleep expressions were adorable, making Lyle feel more uncomfortable with a pang.Medea looked like she hadn\u2019t figured out the situation yet. \u2018Ugh\u2026\u2019 Even the sound of her breathing while deep in slumber made Lyle\u2019s heartbeat.Lyle stared at Medea with an uncomfortable expression; her eyelids blinked, flickering like butterfly wings, revealing her beautiful eyes.Gulp.Lyle thought Medea was beautiful.Even before her engagement, Medea had been praised as the most beautiful woman on the continent. So it\u2019s nothing new, but\u2026\u2026. Previously, because of Lyle\u2019s prejudices, she had despised herself after he spent nights with her, so her beauty never reached his eyes nor gave him a chance to see her properly.But now Lyle feels whiplashed by Medea\u2019s charm.A human being awoke with a face bearing such glamour that it made previous \u2018beauties\u2019 claim to be striking again. This was common to Medea. The title \u201cThe most beautiful woman on the continent\u2019 was by no means a myth.Lyle couldn\u2019t even breathe properly upon witnessing such extreme loveliness.Without blinking his eyes, he stared at Medea. His lips parts as he started at her visage, a vision of beauty, clear eyes deeper than the sea, looked back at him, her silver hair hanging over the silk bedding.Medea was also gawking at him as he stared at her straight into her blue eyes, stunned as if she had not expected Lyle.Wow! His heart started to beat even wilder, his eyes inflamed at the sight of her beautiful pale pearly skin turning into a feverish peach.Medea, who pulled the blanket over her breasts, also hid her face. She looked at Lyle with resentment, barely showing her eyes.\u201cWh\u2014 why are you still here?\u201d cried Medea in an anguished voice of shame.Her words incited sadistic and surly tendencies that Lyle didn\u2019t even know existed within him.\u201cIs that something you should say as soon as you see your husband\u2019s face?\u201dLyle said in a displeased tone as if denying this strange fresh feeling that spread through his heart.Then, when he stood up, his penis, which had been terribly excited, as if revealing his innermost thoughts, shook up and down and hit his thighs with a slap in accordance with Lyle\u2019s movements. Medea turned her head in a panic, adding insult to injury; she had just woken up completely naked.At night lanterns barely lit their bodies and seeing it in the bright morning was very destructive.Lyle, who saw Medea\u2019s reaction, also looked at his apex. He knew this would happen because he was already heated when he watched Medea\u2019s abdomen.It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t feel embarrassed, but\u2026\u2026 He was the Emperor, and Medea, lying on the bed, was the Empress. The recognized woman of an emperor.Do I, the Emperor, need a time and place to desire my woman? Does it matter if it was the day or night? I am your husband.Lyle strode towards the bed, determined to be a little brazen.* * *Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lyle grabbed her wrists, pressed them into the mattress next to her head, and stared at Medea\u2019s naked body with a greedy gaze.Medea was in tears, confused.\u201cWhy, why are you\u2026\u2026. union day was yesterday!\u201d cried Medea.Medea twisted her body and struggled.Because of that, her white, plump breasts bounced up and down and jiggled back and forth, delighting Lyle\u2019s eyes.\u2018This woman is mine\u2026 \u2026 .\u2019Lyle\u2019s gaze, which seemed to lick and devour her, turned Milledia red.His desire, which darkened his eyes, was so explicit that even an idiot would know.\u201cOh!\u2014 why? We did it until dawn!\u201dHer pouting at such injustice was charming, and her crying blue eyes were stunning.She was a woman who wasn\u2019t comfortable with admitting she too wanted to swallow him up.\u201cThere is no law saying we can\u2019t do it in the morning because we did it at night.\u201dAs he lasciviously peered at Milledia with lecherous red eyes, Medea\u2019s mouth opened as if astonished.\u201cEh, what, no! The character is different! Your Majesty, didn\u2019t you hate me?\u201d\u201cI hated you.\u201dMedea\u2019s blue eyes didn\u2019t even shake even though he said something hurtful with a heartless face.Medea really did completely lose her memory. \u2018See, I\u2019m right!\u2019Lyle wasn\u2019t pleased with Medea\u2019s expression when she asked:\u201cThen\u2014Why are you doing this\u2014 since you hate me?\u201dHe frowned and said, \u201cBut it\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve been married to the Empress, and we still have no children? The Empress has been striving to have a child, but I think I have been too indifferent\u2026\u2026. and I am thinking of changing our relationship a little.\u201d\u201cOh, no! You don\u2019t need to change it. Your Majesty has done well so far\u2026\u2026.wait! What are you doing?\u201dStartled, Medea struggled, forgetting to use honorific language.Lyle thwarted her efforts and constrained both of Medea\u2019s hands above her head with one of his.It won\u2019t budge! What kind of strength do you have? Why are your hands so big?Lyle\u2019s right hand caressed Medea\u2019s breast before she could protest.Medea\u2019s face turned red when his impudent hand squeezed her soft breasts, caressing and rubbing them.\u201cWh\u2014 what are you doing\u2026 \u2026 . Oooh\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cKeep talking. I\u2019ve been doing well so far, and what else?\u201dAs if he was savoring her slowly, his hand was not rough, but it was lustful, lewd and weird.Medea glared at Lyle even though he shook her heart so much.\u201c\u2026. \u2018Touch it like that\u2019\u2026.. you can say that\u2026\u2026but you can\u2019t, can you\u2026.\u201dLyle, who was fiddling with her smooth flesh moving it from side to side, put the nipple between his middle and index fingers and rubbed the sensitive fore-end with his thumb.\u201cI just rubbed the tip. This is the really sensitive one. Isn\u2019t that right, Millie?\u201dMedea\u2019s face was even hotter when he called her nickname so sweetly like he did last night.Why is the Emperor doing this? You said you hate me!\u201cAh, aaaah\u2026 \u2026 . Stop if you know\u2026 \u2026 . Yes\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cDo you feel good? I think I should have held you during the day. It was intriguing to have you moan under dim light, but it\u2019s more fascinating to taste you under such bright sunlight\u2026. Where you can\u2019t hide any expressions,\u201d whispered Lyle so intensely and seductively to Medea\u2019s face, that she felt a thrill and a chill at the same time.When she thought he was about to kiss her lips as he lowered his head, she closed her eyes.Lyle laughed and pressed his lips against Medea\u2019s fiery cheeks.\u201cIt\u2019s a delicious color.\u201dAfter his chaste kiss, he bared his teeth and bit her cheek.Medea looked at Lyle in astonishment.Who are you?! It\u2019s a fake wearing Lyle\u2019s mask\u2014you!A wave of deja vu overcame me\u2014something about Lyle\u2019s way of speaking.You are saying different things than what you said before\u2026..but weren\u2019t the words similar to the ones Lyle spoke when he spent the first night after marrying Seira, the original protagonist? This was the same behavior too\u2014sly and libidinal\u2026 \u2026 .\u2018No, wait! I am not Seira? Why is your debauched personality you showed on the first night of your honeymoon coming out now?\u2019After spending the first night with Seira and entering into a full-fledged honeymoon, Lyle burned the night with Seira to the point where he wondered where his fear and hate against women went.As it was a romance novel, there was no detailed description.For the first month, she was unable to get out of the Emperor\u2019s bedroom. For the next year, there were a few lines that he wanted Seira five or six days a week\u2014followed by an epilogue where eight years later, Seira and Lyle were unhappy and argumentative.No, why? What the hell? What flag did I touch? I\u2019ve never seduced you. We didn\u2019t even date\u2014or have a relationship!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It couldn\u2019t be only desire\u2013Lyle knew himself too well. He had desire but detested it with disgust.This tickling weightless excitement in his heart could never have been only lust, but to acknowledge it meant conceding it was because of Medea, who was too intertwined with his irreparable wounds that were too deep to ignore.\u2018Medea\u2019s lips\u2026 \u2026 How sweet and fragrant\u2026 \u2026\u2019And even before these confusing feelings emerged, Lyle was a man who couldn\u2019t throw away the Empress, who he had hated but also felt sorry towards.Lyle, unable to conquer his raging ardor in the midst of the boiling chaos within him, sweetly violated Medea\u2019s soft lips.As he sucked her lips like delicate petals, Medea in his arms first struggled and then let out a sweet sigh.\u201cAhhhhh\u2026. Aaah\u2026\u2026. Your Majesty\u2026\u2026 ~\u201dHer wet voice was dripping with unusually sweet tenderness.Lyle swallowed a curse that was about to soar through his throat and bit back Medea\u2019s lips that were soaked in his saliva.\u201cYou must have used the aphrodisiac as well. Your lips must be so sweet\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cUuhhhhhmm\u2026 \u2026 . Uh aaaaa am\u2026 \u2026 \u201cMedea shuddered at the kiss that afflicted her weak spot and took her breath away. When she scratched Lyle\u2019s hard back because she wasn\u2019t getting enough air, Lyle released Medea\u2019s lips.\u201c\u2026 . Hnnnnngh, huh hukk\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dWinded, her harsh breathes were far from being erotic but were simply endearing.He didn\u2019t completely let go, and Medea disliked that her lips were sticky.\u201cStop sucking! My lips are going to be swollen\u2026 \u2026 . Haae up anngh\u2026 said\u2026\u2026eup \u2026\u201dHer breath was scarce, but Lyle\u2019s lips and tongue in combination dazzled her with pleasure, and Medea scratched Lyle\u2019s back again.Even though she scratched with all her might, Lyle\u2019s lips opened with a strange groan full of something, and it wasn\u2019t pain.Medea glared at him with a blistering face. If someone overheard, they would be thinking I am touching your penis! Why are you groaning like that when I am scratching?\u201c\u2026\u2026 Did you know that hurting the Emperor\u2019s body is a felony?\u201dLyle whispered in a low, sexy-sounding voice. When Medea unintentionally tensed, Lyle plucked Medea\u2019s hand that had scratched him, bit her fingertips, and said,\u201cIf you allow me to hold you during the day, I will forgive you that much.\u201dHe was playing dirty! Who was it that made me claw you?Lyle laughed in a deep voice that vibrated when he saw Medea with a tearful, disgruntled face.She was too cute. With wet glaring eyes, her face looked like a kitten with a wide-eyed look.\u201cUmm? Millie\u2026 \u2026 . see I\u2019m begging you like this. Have you forgotten last night? How you hung on to me and made you so happy\u2013enough to cry?\u201dMedea\u2019s face flushed with a fever as he joyfully spoke of last night. It was true\u2026 it was a little good last night.Lyle couldn\u2019t hide his smile because of the Empress\u2019s charming face, embarrassed at being caught.\u201cEven though I\u2019m the Emperor, I\u2019m saying that I\u2019ll serve you. I\u2019ll hug you softer and more tenderly than yesterday. If the bright sunlight makes you shy\u2026 \u2026 I\u2019ll hold you tightly like I\u2019m doing right now. I won\u2019t ogle your cute body outright. I promise.\u201dThe whisper was charming and alluringly sweet. With a fresh smile and the bright sunlight on his back, Medea was shaken by the seductive Lyle.Here was the strongest, handsomest, and most powerful man in the novel, enticing her with a smile. Lyle\u2019s change in appearance and laughter\u2014so different from his usual frown\u2014made Medea feel weak.\u201cOh, I\u2019m embarrassed\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dShe looked like she was about to cry and showed an expression of conflict.With such an adorable countenance filling his heart, Lyle had to hold on tightly to his patience so as to not pour out kisses on her.\u201cWell, then just a little\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cIf you give permission, open your mouth.

Why do you want to bother me like this?As Lyle waited for me, his half-opened eyes were stunning.With my lips half-opened, I glanced at Lyle when he didn\u2019t kiss me, wondering if he noticed.I was surprised when our eyes met.\u201cYou have lovely lips, Millie\u2026 \u2026 . I\u2019ll have to taste them more often from now on.\u201dWhispered Lyle as he lowered his head slowly.As his face neared, Medea was flustered, and her eyes panicked back and forth and then closed tightly.\u201cHuumm\u2026 .\u201dHis hot, neat lips pressed down, rubbing gently, and then his tongue poked in.Before, he invaded freely and wandered around lustfully, but this time it was caressing. As if seducing Medea\u2019s tongue by fondling it.\u201cHmm \u2026 .\u201dWhen she gathered enough courage, she carefully stroked his tongue with her own, so he wasn\u2019t doing all the work.Lyle groaned low.Then he hugged Medea harder.\u201cMillie\u2026 \u2026\u201dI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s so excited? Medea thought, as her body started to relax and give itself to her rising lustful heat.In the midst of this Lyle\u2019s hot palm slid between her legs. He was gently stroking, caressing her entrance, which had traces of last night\u2019s affair.\u201cHnngh\u2026..\u201dLyle joyfully laughed as Medea wriggled her waist and closed her legs with at the bizarre feeling. Each reaction that Medea revealed furthered endeared her.\u201cEmbracing you all night until dawn has rewarded me a prize. I think I can put it right away.\u201dSatisfied, he whispered words that confused Medea.Lyle gently grabbed her thighs, spreading Medea\u2019s knees open.\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll let you go soon\u2026\u2026.. Millie.\u201d***\u201cHungh, oh! Don\u2019t look\u2026 \u2026 .Ooooh! Aang!\u201dLyle, with a ravenous gaze, held Medea\u2019s hands against the bed.It was a magnificent sight to see her body shake and her voluminous breasts sway and jiggle with his weight when he pushed in.Lyle\u2019s ferociously large penis rushing in and out could not be missed as it pumped in between Medea slender legs that were spread wide open.Lyle had a surly smile.\u201cI lied. I\u2019d be stupid to deprive myself of this thrilling view.\u201d\u201cHung! Hnngh! That way! Oh! Ahhh! Ah yeah\u2026\u2026. Aang!\u201dAs Medea\u2019s secret stirred in despair, Lyle violently shook his back.Her lips that moaned and scolded him were too lovely, so he murmured and dropped a kiss.\u201cHmph! Uh-huh! Oooooooh!\u201dPanting, Medea struggled, hitting Lyle\u2019s arms that now embraced her. She couldn\u2019t avoid him, and he kissed her more persistently as her tangled tongue still conveyed Medea\u2019s complaints.I didn\u2019t know I had this taste.Lyle continued to rhythmically penetrate Medea, grasping her ass to avoid deep insertion. And every time Medea wriggled in his arms, his pleasure doubled. He filled her with his passion.\u201cHaa, Millie \u2026.\u201dWholly aroused by Lyle, Medea also climaxed and drooped in his arms.Medea\u2019s expressions, melting into ecstasy, seemed to permeate into Lyle\u2019s heart one by one.This is Medea? I couldn\u2019t believe it.But even though she changed like this, she was still Medea\u2026 and she was still the Emperor\u2019s woman.\u2018You\u2019re mine. You are my woman.\u2019Jubilant with that fact, Lyle raised his back again.Medea, who had been thawing in a sweet afterglow, was startled when she noticed his enlarging member.\u201cYou said a little bit\u2026 Huungh\u2026..!\u201d\u201cIt is only a little bit.\u201dSpeaking naturally, Lyle smacked her ass.Medea blushed and pinched Lyle\u2019s hard forearm even though he didn\u2019t even get a scratch.* * *Am I insane? Lyle was restless as he left the palace.He had embraced and coveted Medea until she had melted from, and for that reason, he had kept all the officials present at a political affair meeting waiting.He had to leave when he couldn\u2019t delay it anymore\u2026..\u2026 and I couldn\u2019t be more aggrieved.I would have to wait another two weeks for the next union day.\u2018Two weeks. Two weeks\u2026\u2026.\u2019Even if it was just ten days, I thought I could breathe easier\u2014but it was two weeks.After ten days and there were four more days of waiting.Lyle\u2019s mood was plummeting while he rushed back.Before, I was so happy while holding Medea. And now I\u2019m dying because of the hated fact that I can\u2019t hold her again tonight.\u2014No, wait. I didn\u2019t mean that. It\u2019s Medea we\u2019re talking about here, remember?Until last night, who had delayed entering Medea\u2019s residence until he couldn\u2019t anymore? Who kept to his office until late at night to handle all the things he had on his plate and didn\u2019t have? Who had pretended not to know when he received resentments for keeping to the office until midnight?But.\u2026.\u2018I just changed my mind overnight?\u2019Well, it was a long and sweet night.It was so precious that the long night was fleeting.Medea was also very attractive, and she was fun to tease.When Lyle whispered a lewd word in her ear, her face turned rosy quickly, and her pupils shook like an earthquake.\u2018It was good in the morning.\u2019 If possible, I wanted to stop by the palace in the middle of the day and hug Medea\u2014No. No, no no.\u2018No, that\u2019s Medea!\u2019Lyle, who was smiling happily unconsciously, frowned again. And when he remembered Medea, who had been tearfully whimpering and trapped in his arms, his mouth lost its tense frown.No matter how much he tried, his face loosened.Lyle forcibly drew stern lines on his forehead.I can\u2019t believe you are lusting for that Medea. I know that there are times when it is inevitable that a man\u2019s body gets excited\u2026 \u2026 .\u2018Yes.\u2019Last night when he embraced Medea, he didn\u2019t have the strange guilt and disgust that he always had.He had been distracted by Medea\u2019s reactions and had forgotten.Lyle, recalling the ugly moments of his childhood, felt his mood sinking disastrously low.Wasn\u2019t it also Medea, the arrogant and shameless woman who unearthed Lyle\u2019s painful traumas and smiled triumphantly?I had thought that I would never give you my heart\u2026\u2026 Empress.\u2018We did that much yesterday, so a child was probably conceived. So\u2026\u2026\u2019There\u2019s no need to visit again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, when Medea had suffered an injury from falling off the second-floor balcony, the doctor declared her not pregnant earlier than usual.\u2018If it was no use sleeping before that\u2026 \u2026we might have another relationship in two weeks.\u2019It would be difficult to believe that Medea wasn\u2019t impregnated after yesterday\u2019s and this morning\u2019s multiple, vigorous activities.But the result won\u2019t be known until about a month later\u2026 \u2026 Anyway, wouldn\u2019t it be right for us to join once more after two weeks?Lyle\u2019s expression became bizarre when he realized what he was inadvertently thinking, wanting, and expecting.

Your Majesty is the Emperor, and her Majesty is the Empress. Is she not the one who runs with joy whenever your Majesty calls?\u201dCome running with joy? Medea? Lyle frowned as he recalled Medea, who climbed and jumped off the walls of the imperial palace last night to escape him.I don\u2019t know if that was the case before, but now Medea can\u2019t do that.Sid took a glance at Lyle\u2019s pondering gaze and said one more thing:\u201cEven if that\u2019s not the case\u2026 \u2026 . Your Majesty can always ask the Empress to sleep with you. Both of you are young\u2026 \u2026 . The excuse is perfect because the two of you have no children yet.\u201dLyle was speechless; Sid had somehow spoke to his unspoken troubling concerns.When he turned to look at Sid, Sid quickly avoided his eyes and looked down with an anxious face.\u2018\u2026.But he didn\u2019t say anything wrong.\u2019As Sid said, he was the Emperor.Currently, the imperial couple had no children\u2026 \u2026 . It was also an essential duty of the Emperor and Empress, to produce heirs\u2014 Because they were royal, but\u2026 \u2026 How are you going to meet Medea\u2019s face after everything that happened this morning\u2026?Lyle felt even more ashamed when he recalled embracing Medea without any self-consciousness or pride\u2013 and desiring her as much as he liked\u2014 Why was he doing something he had never done before?Wasn\u2019t he the person that deeply frowned when Medea\u2019s voice entered his ears?\u2018This is nothing more than lust. You\u2019ve done it before. Just ignore it, and it will disappear. There\u2019s no way I want to see Medea. Remember what she has done to you!\u2019Lyle shook his head, struggling to ignore the painful seizuring heartbeat that had arisen; he was never going to seek out Medea. And he was definitely not going to revisit her tonight.***The Emperor\u2019s Inconsistency\u2018Why is the Emperor here?\u2019Medea, who had entered the living room like a newborn baby deer, freaked out.I was so worn out and tired that I was planning on eating lunch in the bedroom, but I came out to the living room when the maids stared at me with knowing gazes. I wanted to die from shame.\u2018I heard that you\u2019ve been involved with Lyle every joining day, but what\u2019s up with these burning stares? Weren\u2019t you, the former Medea, embraced like this?\u2019The maids were rejoicing, \u2018Our beautiful Empress has finally begun to be favored by His Majesty!\u2019However, the present Medea had no way of knowing this. Instead, what mattered to her was her overworked, cramping waist, back, and thighs.Her thighs couldn\u2019t seem to close, and her abdomen ached from having to deal with Lyle\u2019s ridiculously enthusiastic riding.Medea felt better after taking the medicines delivered to her by the maids and meeting a massage therapistFortunately, my important place was intact without lacerations or swelling, so I could fully appreciate and experience the terrifying power of a romance novel.\u2018At the end of the story, it did have the atmosphere like a r-19 novel, with scene, scene, scene, scene, scene, scene, scene, scene \u00a0(\u2018scene\u2019 is slang for smut scenes)\u2026. it went on for a while.\u2019I had enjoyed reading it.At the time, I had relished in the embarrassing situations unfolding as Seira and Lyle tangled together\u2026 but Seira could withstand it because she had the stamina of a knight. Me? I\u2019m going to die.\u2018But it felt good. Lyle was really good\u2014 Admit it!\u2019As she entered the living room, Lyle suddenly appeared in a chair. Medea screamed and jumped\u2014completely unempress-like.\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201dMedea yelled at Lyle, who was stunned.\u201cWhy is your Majesty here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I even managed to do what I had to do in the future.Lyle, Sid, and Lyle\u2019s staff were all competent, so the work was not late. And it had primarily to do with Lyle completing all his work so he could arrive late on joint nights.\u201cI had all the urgent work done yesterday so that I can afford it.\u201dI couldn\u2019t hold up until the night.No, I came for lunch on the pretext that if I came to the palace at night, I would surely carry Medea straight to the bedroom.\u2014Because Medea is the Empress, and you can have lunch with the Empress.Lyle had laughed deeply when he heard that Medea couldn\u2019t leave the house in the aftermath of their tryst.I was embarrassed when I caught myself daydreaming\u2014wanting to go to her bedroom where Medea was lying down, teasing her, and kissing her.Medea glared at her maid-in-waiting. Why wasn\u2019t she told Lyle had arrived?I would have hid in my room and said I was sick!Medea had several exclusive maids, but her maid-in-waiting was openly watching her because of her recent amnesia and unusual behavior.\u201cI told them not to deliver the news that I arrived. I thought the Empress would get \u2018lost\u2019 again if she knew I was here.\u201dIndeed, Medea looked at Lyle like she wanted to go back to the bedroom and lock the door, and Lyle couldn\u2019t help but hide his amused chuckle in his heart.If I go into the bedroom right now, I really won\u2019t be able to get out of bed\u2026\u201cCome on and sit down. I heard that the Empress prepared foods according to your preferences.\u201dLyle was a little surprised by the menu.The former Medea had eaten only grass while today\u2019s Medea prefers meat to the point of being a carnivore. The only vegetables present happened to be a part of the meat dishes.Medea, who could not hide her unpleasant expression, dragged her feet to the table.Lyle sat down at the head of the table, suppressing his desire to snatch the sulking Medea.As she sat across from Lyle, the food was transferred to the table. \u00a0Her uneven expression melted when he saw the food.Huh. You like food more than me?It was a drastic change from the pre-amnesia Medea, so Lyle felt a bizarre sensation. The feeling of unfairness and jealousy squeezed his heart.I deliberately took time to see you, but what is this attitude?I thought we liked each other last night.Lyle stared at the plate of food in front of him, feeling betrayed by the current Medea. Steak, it was one of Medea\u2019s favorite foods now.\u201c\u2026 It seems like I\u2019ve come for nothing.\u201dAll of the maids and servants were embarrassed by Lyle, who suddenly got up with a frown.Medea was the only one who looked puzzled, a little surprised, but that\u2019s all.\u201cAren\u2019t you going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m happy to leave quickly.\u201dLyle crumpled his face, turned around, and left the room.\u201cOh, yeah!\u201dMedea lifted her utensils, ready to dig in.\u201cYour Majesty, Empress! Won\u2019t you hold onto him? His Majesty has come all the way here!\u201d\u201cOh. Maybe something urgent has happened. Doesn\u2019t he always have an emergency when he sees my face?\u201dMedea said in a peaceful and relaxed manner, teasing her fork and putting the braised beef ribs into her mouth.The imperial chef\u2019s skill was so high that it touched the sky, so the meat melted in her mouth.\u201cWow, it\u2019s so delicious! The best taste!\u201dMeanwhile, Lyle, who had enhanced senses since he was a Sword Master, was able to listen to the whole exchange.His feverish temper had surged for a moment, and he had left in a fit, but he could not go back.Besides, Lyle indeed acted that way whenever he had met Medea..\u2026\u2018I won\u2019t look for you again!\u2019With his face dyed with rage and humiliation, Lyle stomped out of the palace.I wasn\u2019t even fighting with Medea. So why did I feel so utterly defeated?***I want to touch her\u2026 \u2026I wanted to embrace her, suck those soft lips, and covet her until she looked up at me with wet eyes, panting\u2018Am I really crazy?\u2019I can\u2019t believe I am so voracious for Medea. This couldn\u2019t be happening if I wasn\u2019t insane.But now Lyle\u2019s throat is sore and parched just by hearing Medea\u2019s name.I want to hold her in my arms. I want to caress and kiss her.\u201cDid you not eat together?\u201dSid asked in a dull tone. He didn\u2019t even bring out the \u2018M\u2019 of Medea\u2019s name, but they both knew who he was referring to.Lyle turned his head because he didn\u2019t even want to respond.As he looked at the papers spread out on his desk, Sid clicked his tongue mentally.If it were like before, there would be liberation after the Emperor\u2019s joining day.All the other employees returned home except Sid.\u201cOh, why? What else is wrong? What happened to the atmosphere that caused you to be late to that important political meeting today?\u201dLyle delaying a meeting had never occurred since he ascended as Emperor.Thanks to this fact, and the fact he was five hours late the morning after his union day with the Empress, rumors already abounded.\u201cYou talk too much, Sid. Are there any other documents to report?\u201d\u201cOf course not. Didn\u2019t you take care of everything, even the items you didn\u2019t have to do, because of last night? Thanks to that kind of work ethic, everyone knows that our Majesty even cares about the small towns in distant provinces, and people say the Emperor\u2019s eyes won\u2019t miss a thing in the imperial country.\u201d\u201cDamn it.\u201d\u201cFor eight years, you\u2019ve been cleaning out the wounds of this nation and treating its blood and pus quite often. There\u2019s no more to do; it will come in only four days.\u201dLyle pushed the documents to one side and deeply sighed.\u201cWhy does work have an end?\u201d\u201cBecause we have human rights?\u201dSid retorted, hoping he would get the hint.Lyle glanced at Sid and shook her head to erase the indelible image of a limp Medea that had been suffering under Lyle.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and meet her Majesty the Empress?\u201d\u201cWhy should I?\u201d\u2018I can see who you were thinking with your cheeks dyed just now.\u2019Sid looked pitifully at a withering Lyle, who had turned his head with a sour expression.\u201cYou should use this chance. Since her Majesty was exhausted after having a hard night with his Majesty, isn\u2019t this a good excuse to comfort her?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the Empress\u2019s duty to comfort me?\u201d\u201cThe rumors spread that you did it hard enough to be five hours late for the political meeting.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d* * *Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thanks to you, wasn\u2019t the Duke quiet today?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dIndeed, because the Emperor was late attending the political affairs meeting while spending time with his daughter, the Duke quietly passed on today without much disagreement.Although Lyle was said to be in a power struggle with the Duke, none of the Duke\u2019s faction protested him being late, even though they didn\u2019t like Lyle\u2019s tight grip on the political situation.Talk of their relationship was already widespread; many knew the Empress tormented Lyle and was hungry for his love.\u201cIsn\u2019t it better? If your Majesty planted a lot of good memories before the Empress recovers her memories\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t she stay the same as she is now even when her previous memories come back? \u00a0You don\u2019t want the Empress to go back to her former self, do you?\u201dOf course, I didn\u2019t want the former Medea to return.If I saw a hint of her previous self, this heart, which began to thaw slowly, would freeze in an instant.\u201c\u2026 \u2026Indeed.\u201dThe former Medea.It was an old image that I didn\u2019t like to recall, but it was clear that if I searched for a little bit of the previous figure in the current Medea, I would lose my affection again.Lyle nodded with a look of hope. Sid, on the other hand, was delighted that his advice had worked.\u201cAre you going to look for her?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll look for her.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to see her face again, considering the humiliation I received at lunch, but on the other hand, I wanted to see Medea one more time.\u2018No. This is to calm my mind. Medea is Medea\u2026 \u2026 you\u2019ll find her former self if you talk to her.\u201dLyle thought so, and ordered Sid to go home and left the office.* * *\u201cLibrary?\u201dAfter losing her memory, I have heard reports that Medea frequently goes to the library.Since it was Medea, I thought she was reading books related to history or politics. \u2026 but he said that she was readingromance novels.\u2018Are you reading such a book?\u2019The Imperial Palace\u2019s library boasted an enormous collection of books, the largest on the continent. Among them was a library that only the royal family could access.Only a few people used it. However, most books go into or out of the library without being checked out. And books that are frequently borrowed or related to them remain in place.Many books related to romance were recently moved back to the library\u2019s bookshelf because Medea had been reading love novels diligently.\u201cEmper\u2026!\u201d\u201cShh.\u201dWhen the Emperor entered the library, the director of the Imperial Palace library was shocked. He almost raised his voice but was silenced by Lyle.When Lyle gestured for them to leave the library with an expressionless face, the director and librarians hurried out of the library.Medea had also restricted her maids from following her into the library so they wouldn\u2019t nag about her only reading romances.The library door was closed at Lyle\u2019s instructions. Lyle locked the door of the library by hand and turned around.Now there was only Medea and himself in the library.Somehow Lyle hesitated, pressing down on his wobbly chest. \u00a0As he was leaving, the library director went and pointed out the direction where Medea was. But even if he hadn\u2019t, Lyle could easily sense Medea with his superior senses.\u2018I\u2019m not nervous. This is\u2026\u2026\u2019Ignoring his burning face, Lyle took a deep breath and attempted to steady his breath. He laughed at himself; he was so nervous even though he was only going to meet Medea.\u2018Good.\u2019Lyle, who barely managed to lessen his blushing by a degree, started to walk towards her.I wondered if it would be better to make footsteps, but I decided not to do so because I wanted to see Medea, unguarded, and reading a book.Medea was standing between the bookcases near the central table of the library. There was a large pile of novels that she had intended to read and a corresponding empty bookshelf.\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2026\u2019The way she read the book, immersed in it, was so different from her this morning. Her focus and serious expression should have reminded me of her former self\u2026 \u2026but the whole countenance felt softer and more drowsy.* * *TN: Mwhaha the infamous library scene nears\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When she lost control, Medea cried and clung on to him\u2026.. As soon as Lyle remembered it, he felt heat gathering below his hips\u2014and frantically sought to distract himself from his thoughts.It had almost become dangerous.\u2018Is it okay if I piss off Medea?\u2019I\u2019m not very confident, but it didn\u2019t seem difficult because I quarreled with Medea before commencing their affair last night.\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cKyya!\u201dMedea, who had looked up for something, yelled in astonishment and hugged her book tightly as if to shield her.Lyle was embarrassed, not knowing that she would be so startled.\u201cWhy are you so surprised?\u201d\u201cWhy did you sneak up on me?\u201dMedea interrogated back again, glaring at Lyle and on guard.Then, as if she had realized something, she turned the book over as if she was trying to hide the book cover.\u2018What is it?\u2019Since this is the Imperial Palace Library, there won\u2019t be any suspicious books.What\u2019s more, isn\u2019t this just an ordinary romance novel section?\u201cEmpress. What were you reading?\u201d\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a love story\u2026\u201d (OMG I WOULD DIEEEE)\u201cI know it\u2019s a love story. What\u2019s the title of the book you were reading just now?\u201dMedea hid the book behind her back and her eyes, avoided Lyle, searching the floor as if trying to find the answer.Lyle became even more suspicious.Medea took two steps back as he grinned and stepped closer.\u201cW, why, why are you doing that? You\u2019ve never cared about what I\u2019ve read.\u201d\u201cBecause you are suspicious now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not suspicious now either\u2013I\u2019m completely the same as usual.\u201d\u201cYou are the same, as usual?\u201dAs he inquired, Lyle\u2019s gaze looked at the pile of books Medea had stacked up.At that moment, Medea ran in front of Lyle with a fright. Well, to be precise, in front of the pile of books.Lyle had already seen the title of the book, so his mouth stiffened.\u201cThat\u2026 What is that?\u201d\u201cI-it\u2019s a book.\u201d\u201cYou know perfectly well I\u2019m not asking if it\u2019s a book.\u201dLyle said sharply and grabbed Medea\u2019s arm\u2026 \u2026 and was about to pull her but stopped when he looked down at her face.No, noo, wake up, this isn\u2019t the situation to be doing this\u2014really, really not. \u2026The eyes looking up at me were beautiful. Her shy expression was lovely. Her gaze was so adorable that I wanted to hug her and rain down kisses.\u2018Damn it!\u2019I didn\u2019t come here to feel this way!Reading erotic books in the library, this is not something that Medea would do!\u2018Doesn\u2019t this mean you didn\u2019t satisfy her?\u2019\u201cMillie, if you keep doing this, I\u2019ll call the head librarian to make a list of the books you\u2019ve checked out so far and take them back.\u201dSpeechless, Medea\u2019s face became a rose red.Gah, even that expression was delightful, so I looked down slowly.Medea shouted, her face bright.\u201cYou can pretend you don\u2019t know! I am an adult too! I can read it!\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Don\u2019t you have any awareness that you are the Empress?\u201dWhen asked, Medea pouted and impulsively retorted in dismay:\u201cWhat your Majesty does to me is more erotic\u2014\u201dMedea, horrified, covered her mouth.Lyle, openly bewildered, stared at Medea.\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dThere were only the two of them, so it was oppressively quiet when the two closed their mouths.Unlike Medea, who turned away, bemoaning her slip of the tongue and started beating her mouth, Lyle was already regaining his composure.\u201cIt looks like being with me last night wasn\u2019t that bad?\u201d What else\u2026 \u2026 .\u201cYes?\u201dMedea looked back at him without concealing her mortification.Lyle looked down at Medea with a polite but beguiling smile.There was a strange glow in his dark red eyes.\u201cDo you have to look for something like this after spending that lewd time\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe hand that had reached Medea plucked the book out from between her arms.The title of the book read .\u201c\u2026Is it that you were thinking about me while reading these scenes?\u201d\u201cAh, noo\u2013that-ah! -No!\u201d How hateful!Medea tried to take the book out of Lyle\u2019s hand, but Lyle was already opening the book and reading its contents.\u201cThe Demon King\u2019s long, smooth fingers spread the princess\u2019s soaked petals and digs inside. The princess twists her limbs tied to the chains\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy are you reading that!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t the Empress say it was okay for adults to read?\u201dLyle was even older than Medea, so of course, he was an adult.With a sexy low-pitched voice, he continued to read the r-19 scene of the romance novel she had been reading.Medea, burning with shame and rushed to steal the book back from Lyle\u2019s hand.Lyle easily evaded her and read the next passage:\u201c\u2026He spreads wide her defenseless shaking thighs. The Demon King pushed his finger to the place where the princess showed the most obscene reaction, and then with his fingertips\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2013Ughhh! Ahh! Oh my god!\u201dMedea shrieked with embarrassment, utterly modified as Lyle chuckled and then bursted into laughter.Medea, who had enough, ran at Lyle.He easily eluded her again, but Medea, who was still unfamiliar with long skirts, stepped on her hem and fell forward.Lyle quickly pulled her into his arms. Medea, who was held in Lyle\u2019s hug, became quiet. Lyle, while embracing her and holding the book high and out of reach with his other arm, also became silent.\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dLyle was already watching Medea with heavy red eyes when she looked up and met his stare with her eyes wide and shaking.\u201cYou ran into my arms first.\u201d*Thump!*Lyle dropped the book, and it hit the floor with a rather hefty sound.The tension was so thick Medea couldn\u2019t move her upturned head or meet Lyle\u2019s eyes.His flaming red eyes were coming closer and closer.\u201cYour Maj\u2014\u201dLyle\u2019s hot lips swallowed Medea\u2019s words before she could even finish.

None of that was a reason to separate.\u201cAh,\u2026 .Well, Pfft \u2026 .\u201dLyle hugged Medea with trembling lips.

In the novel, I think he said something similar to Seira.Lyle looked a little out of his mind.\u201cIf you let me eat you out, I\u2019ll stop from spilling semen on the library floor,\u201d Lyle said generously as if it was a fair deal.Excited and shy, Medea protested, \u201cNo! You\u2019re the Emperor, don\u2019t you have any dignity?\u201d\u201cDo you have any dignity to protect in your bedroom?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not your bedroom!\u201dMedea was even more exasperated because he looked handsome with a grumpy smile. It\u2019s like a goddamn male protagonist buff!But Medea remembers how he felt good when Lyle licked her there.\u201cAre you really going to keep your promise?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf you are lying to me, you\u2019ll have to give me the throne and be the master. I\u2019ll be the Emperor.\u201dLyle laughed unintentionally, imagining Medea sitting on his throne and spreading her legs. Eating her out in such a place seemed to be particularly fun.\u201cLet\u2019s do that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 That laughter is annoying, but I\u2019ll trust it this time.\u201d\u201cGood. Lift that skirt up and take off your panties.\u201dWhen Lyle proudly demanded, Medea was speechless.Was that something the male lead would say?\u201cYou didn\u2019t hit your head, right?\u201d\u201cAre you worried about me?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 I am saying that your Majesty has changed so much.\u201dMedea sighed and reached out to her petticoat.As I lifted the hem to take my panties off, I realized Lyle was staring at me.\u201cI\u2026 b-because I\u2019m shy\u2026 \u2026 .I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t finished talking yet!\u201dBut Lyle was very brazen. He pulled a chair and sat down and looked at Medea with a gaze of appreciation.\u201cI wanted to see the Empress take off herself, so I told you to take it off. But if you don\u2019t like it, come here. I\u2019ll take it off myself.\u201dWith his lustful gaze on her, it wasn\u2019t likely that she would ever peel it off.Medea stared at Lyle as if she was stunned and lifted her dress.\u201cOkay.\u201dMedea\u2019s face turned a deep red as she felt Lyle\u2019s burning gaze on the hem of her raising petticoat. He reached out and touched her thong strap hanging from her hip, unwrapping the finely made bow tie.The thin piece of cloth loosened.\u201cHa\u2026..\u201dI could hear Lyle breathing loudly.Medea felt hot, the tension of the bow squeezed her, and Lyle pulled the rest of the knot.The fabric fell, what lay between her thigh gap completely exposed under Lyle\u2019s gaze\u2026\u2026Medea hurriedly lowered her dress to hide it.\u201cWhat is it? You said I could lick it.\u201d\u201cYou can lick, but I never said that I would let you see!\u201d\u201cIs this saying that it would be nice to for me to eat you out with my eyes covered?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dA hesitant Medea finally realized that there was no way that she could get around it and lifted up the hem of her petticoat.Lyle\u2019s hot gaze drilled into her as she revealed her pale thighs, her pussy, and crevices.Seeing it, Lyle rose from his seat and approached Medea.\u201cUmm \u2026.\u201dLyle, who was groaning low, reached out and gently spread Medea\u2019s wet petals.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019ve seen it plenty this morning!\u201d\u201cSo you can show me\u2026. While you\u2019re standing like this already.\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dLyle\u2019s fingers went under Medea\u2019s arm and lightly pinched her nipples. It wasn\u2019t painful, but the lewd prank made her moan.\u201cYou said you were licking, but \u2014other jokes\u2026 \u2026 ! Ugh!\u201dHolding Medea\u2019s two indignant cheeks while she scolded him, Lyle poured down a multitude of kisses over her, and he finished her off with an incredibly passionate, devouring kiss.The dress slipped out of Medea\u2019s hand, now utterly devoid of energy.\u201cHuuah\u2026oooh hnngh\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll lick you now,\u201d Lyle whispered, looking into Medea\u2019s blue eyes after he released from his sweet kiss.Medea hesitated when she saw Lyle willingly kneel in front of her. She curled up her petticoat again and, with a shy glance, seemed to permit him to go ahead. An immaculate pussy was revealed between thighs trembling with tension.\u201cHaaaa\u2026 .\u201dLyle, with his fingers, opened Medea\u2019s fold and gazed at it with a sticky glaze.Medea was embarrassed and kept closing her legs.\u201cMillie.\u201d\u201cYes, yes?\u201dReplied the parched Medea, surprised.Lyle pointed his gaze at Medea\u2019s trembling knee and said, \u201cIf you keep closing your legs, I won\u2019t be able to get between them.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tease me\u2026.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t lying when I said I want to clean you with my tongue.\u201dWith such a neat and beautifully handsome face, he spoke dirty words that had a great destructive power. Medea was momentarily dazed.Lyle said:\u201cIf you keep moving your hips or closing your legs, I understand that it means asking for the bigger one. You\u2019ll be fine, though, right?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dIt was obvious what the bigger one was.\u201cEkkk!\u201dThe faltering Medea\u2019s knees were spread wide open by Lyle\u2019s hands. While kneeling, Lyle reached out to her petals.\u201cAh!\u201dHe spread her petals from both sides, exposing her flower dripping with wine. Lyle looked at it and breathed in. Medea swallowed her shaky breath, and the moist tip of his tongue caressed her blossom.\u201cAhhhh\u2026 .\u201dEven his breath made me trembled at the sweet stimulus.Lyle glanced at the flower bud that had started to stand up.When the tip of his tongue tickled the eye of the flower, a strange sensation started to spread out.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dLyle decided to taste only the eye of the flower without touching the other places. He rubbed it up and down, pushed it from side to side, bit it with his lips, and kneaded it.\u201cEkk!\u2026.haha\u2026 ahhhh\u2026. stop\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dAll my nerves turned to places I wasn\u2019t even aware of. The only thing that Lyle\u2019s lips touched was that bud, and although he hadn\u2019t even touched anything else, I could tell just by feeling that my core inside contracted and the love liquid overflowed.\u201cOhhh\u2026 . Uhhh humm. Haak, Your Majesty, stop\u2026 \u2026 . Ah\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cRemember what I said if you moved your ass away? I\u2019ll hit it with your ass poking out.\u201dMedea eyes widened at words like a bolt from out of the blue.That means you\u2019re going to put it in!I thought I could just hold on by being licked right now, but I wasn\u2019t confident of holding out until the end.\u201cNo\u2026 \u2026 . Stop licking, uh\u2026 \u2026 . Ha! Oh oh\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dThere was a sweet shudder that ran all over my body when his tongue smoothly rolled my bud.Medea sobbed, unable to pull her ass away or close her thighs, because of her wager with Lyle.Because she was feeling so good, it was even more difficult.\u201cNo, I think I\u2019m going to\u2026\u2026Ahhh\u2026 Stop. Ah ohhh\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was no way Lyle would quit with Medea begging with such an anguished cry. Lyle eventually pulled her ass towards him and pushed his tongue into Medea\u2019s entrance.\u201cHaa, wow! Oh Ahh!\u201dAt the obscene stimulus, Medea cried out and hung on to Lyle\u2019s head.I was so embarrassed to do such a lewd thing in the library but what Lyle did to me felt so good.Every time he licked it, I felt like I was going crazy.\u201cAh, ah\u2026 \u2026 No\u2026 \u2026 . Wait, no! Your Majesty, stop\u2026 \u2026 . I think I going to\u2026 \u2026 . Ohh\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cHold on\u2026 \u2026\u201dLyle whispered in a very excited low voice.Medea shook her head and sobbed, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t stand it anymore!\u201d\u201cAh, ah ah, ah, ah, Ahhhh!\u201dMedea wobbled and sank as she reached her zenith.Lyle, on his knees, smiled cooly as he received her.\u201cHah, ha\u2026..\u201dLyle rose up and picked up a dreamy Medea in his arms. He strode to the front of the library table and laid Medea down.The hem of her dress was rolled up, and two smooth white legs were wide open.\u201cHah, ahhhh!\u201dSuddenly, Lyle, who had pulled out his penis, quickly pushed it in and up. When he tasted the peak, Medea\u2019s spirit was aroused. When his head rose again, she felt ashamed.\u201cAh, no\u2026 Aang! Lyle!\u201d\u201cI kept my promise. It\u2019s the Empress who\u2019s been acting out of control.\u201dWhat promise?Medea\u2019s protest was buried in a moan at Lyle pushing in his fiery penis.He wrapped his arms around Medea while he kept his rhythm.\u201cHaa\u2026..Millie\u2026.\u201dOh, gosh! I can\u2019t accept this\u2026\u2026.Why are you staring at me with that face, that face that looks like it\u2019s in love!***The lifted body shook violently up and down.Medea sobbed, desperately wrapping around Lyle\u2019s waist with her slender legs. Her dress, which had been hanging over her waist, had been torn and long since fell to the floor.There was a messy trace of lovemaking mixed with semen and love liquid near Lyle, who was churning.\u201cUgh, yes! Aang! Aaang! Lyle~!\u201dWhenever Medea sang his name in a wet voice, his passion grew out of control.Did the former Medea ever call his name? It seems likely.But every time, Lyle was angry with a raging fire and never let her call his name again.Even though the only being allowed to call his name was the Empress.\u201cAh! Ahhh! That\u2019s so good, ooh! Aang\u2026\u2026. Whoa\u2026\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He groaned deeply as he was doing hectic back work.He was so engrossed in the pleasure that he grabbed Medea by her ass and pushed himself in and up so fiercely her ass cheeks felt beaten.\u201cMedea.\u2026. Millie\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWow! O, oh\u2026\u2026. Ahhhh! Oh, no!\u201dHanging from his chest, she rubbed her white breasts against Lyle\u2019s shirt. The debauched feeling felt through his shirt made Lyle growl a groan through his teeth with fervor.While he was wearing all his clothes, Medea was not wearing a stitch.Wait. Isn\u2019t this the library? In a place other than her bedroom, where she was tasting pleasure in the arms of the Emperor with her naked body completely exposed, utterly indecent.But at the same time, it was also incredibly alluring, and the fact that he coveted a woman with the highest status in the kingdom as if he was dealing with a bedroom slave gave Lyle ingratiating pleasure.\u201cAh, aahhhhh!\u201dDespite being soaked with the pleasures she shunned, Medea was simply and utterly beautiful. Lyle poured out his passion inside of Medea. As a hot liquid gushed through his fiery cock, Medea was frightened and hung from Lyle\u2019s throat.\u201cHooo..\u201dThree or four times, he had already ejaculated. Her insides were full of Lyle\u2019s semen.Overflowing, some of it was pushing out of her entrance and fell on the floor.\u201cMillie\u2026.. You\u2019re supposed to hold it in. It\u2019s flowing out.\u201dLyle whispered in a low, teasing voice. And Lyle relaxed his back. Because of Medea\u2019s weight, his pillar, which was already inserted deep in her depths, wriggled against her insides. The vaginal wall, which had just reached a climax, puffed and twitching, tightened with the stimulus.\u201cAhhh \u2026. again, like that\u2026.. Umm\u2026\u201dLyle kissed her lips because Medea, who glared at him with a tearful face, was so charming.Even though she was ashamed, Lyle\u2019s kiss seemed good. Her expression became more relaxed.\u201cWhat? If you don\u2019t like it\u2026 stop it with a kiss.\u201dWhispering, Lyle spilled a short kiss on Medea\u2019s soft lips. Medea sighed, and her hand held Lyle\u2019s cheek.Medea\u2019s blue eyes met with Lyle\u2019s red gaze.She had beautiful eyes. And it wasn\u2019t because I was in a state of pleasure, nor was it because of the people around me that praised her so much.But it was only a few times that I was conscious of her beauty. That was all after Medea lost her memory.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026..?\u201dMedea called out to the silent Lyle, seemingly puzzled.Lyle was looking at Medea with a frightening burning look. Somehow it felt like it was choking her.\u201cCall me Lyle,\u201d said Lyle, roughly snatching Medea\u2019s lips.Medea\u2019s groan flowed from his greedy, trampling kiss. His tongue was digging through the soft gap between her lips.I knew what this feeling was.But Lyle didn\u2019t want to admit it; if he did, he was afraid it would mean that he would eventually forgive Medea \u2026and the sins she committed against him were unforgivable.***\u201cAaohh\u2026\u2026 .\u201dHis male organ pulled out of her, and the obscene liquid mix of semen and love juice poured out.With that lewd touch, Medea trembled and leaned against the table, her knees rattling.\u2018You damn Emperor! It\u2019s worse than in the morning!\u2019Medea glared at Lyle because she couldn\u2019t curse out loud when her opponent was the Emperor.Lyle was looking at Medea with a somewhat frustrated look at the subject that had been screaming.It was the opposite of the morning when he left her bedroom with a very satisfied face.\u201cWh, what?\u201d\u201cYour legs are rattling.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of your Majesty.\u201dAs she grumbled, Lyle looked at Medea with a complicated expression.Unable to understand Lyle\u2019s feelings, Medea looked wary.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with him?\u2019\u201cIf you can\u2019t get up, why don\u2019t you sit on the chair?\u201d\u201cOh, there\u2019s a stain on the chair! Ugh, I\u2019m so embarrassed!\u201d\u201cWhy does that matter?\u201dLyle, who found her attitude incomprehensible, swiftly pulled out a chair and sat Medea there.Medea, who was about to resist for a moment, saw a puddle on the floor and changed her mind. Nevermind a stain \u2013they had already made a pond!How can I face the librarians anymore? How can I ever come back\u2014I am so ashamed!\u201cOh my gosh! What is this? I won\u2019t be able to come to the library anymore! I could die from the shame.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re only going to borrow novels, you can tell a maid to fetch it for you.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t! It doesn\u2019t fit the dignity of an Empress that I am borrowing only unsavory romance novels! I just want some fun!\u201dHer grumbling sounded like whining\u2026Since she was not wearing anything, Lyle\u2019s gaze kept going back to Medea\u2019s body.Medea noticed it,\u201cWhat is it? Where are you looking\u2026\u2026. I can\u2019t do it anymore! My waist and back are smacked raw!\u201d\u201cSo, if your back was okay, would you plan to continue?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u2026 His majesty\u2019s face and body are far beyond my standards, and he has good skills\u2026\u2026.\u201dHer compliments should have made me feel good\u2026 but I felt bad listening to it for some reason.

Rather than saying that anyone with a face and body could enter Medea\u2019s bedroom, it meant that only her husband, Lyle, could embrace her.\u201c\u2026 I call the maid.\u201d\u201cNo, wait! I\u2019ll put on my clothes first.\u201dMedea cried as she stumbled from her seat, grabbing her clothes from the floor. As she fumbled for her thong and put it on sloppily, Lyle sighed and turned away, trying not to get excited.\u201cUnderwear.\u2026 why aren\u2019t you working?\u201dgrumbled Medea, who was tying the strings together on the corset.Lyle, who couldn\u2019t watch her struggle anymore, came up to her.\u201cCome here.\u201dLyle pulled up the corset, tied the corset\u2019s laces with a better skill than Medea. After helping her put on her dress again, she managed to look more dignified than she did in the nude.Medea picked up her torn petticoat and hesitated whether to wipe off Lyle\u2019s semen. She grew flustered again.\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of wiping it, stop; it\u2019s not the Empress\u2019s job. Throw this away, too.\u201dLyle bluntly said, snatching away a bundle of clothing that was in Medea\u2019s hands.Medea couldn\u2019t understand why Lyle was now brusque.\u201c\u2026 What?\u201dasked Lyle, conscious of Medea\u2019s gaze.Medea shook her head.\u201cNothing.\u201dIt\u2019s none of my business. We aren\u2019t dating\u2014not that I wanted to. But for now, being sexual partners was enough.His face, body, and personality are good\u2026\u2026, and I also have admit it was good sex.Well, it wasn\u2019t good, but it wasn\u2019t enough to say that it was bad.\u2018That\u2019s enough, I guess.\u2019\u2026 Anyway, it seemed that if I gave birth to a child, my life as an Empress would be secure.Because Lyle, the male protagonist of this novel, was loyal.\u2018Then Seira?\u2019Seira was truly like the main character. According to her character described in the novel, it was clear that she would not even be interested in a married Emperor.The first time Seira sees the Emperor as a man rather than a monarch, it was only after Lyle first shook Seira.\u2018How did the original work begin?\u2019I was worried about changing the original timeline. Things were already unpredictable enough in this strange world.The story began around the time Medea died, and her funeral was held. Around that time, Seira\u2019s uncle attempted an attack to take over their territory.Seira\u2019s brother was very weak, but Seira tried to lure the pursuers by changing clothes with him to protect him.However, Seira\u2019s brother is murdered while wearing Seira\u2019s clothes, and Seira decides to pretend to be her brother, Ian. Seira planned to hold out until her second youngest brother, Nicole, reached adulthood so that they wouldn\u2019t lose their land to their uncle.\u2018But now I am Empress now.\u2019It was late autumn when the incident broke out, and now it was at the end of summer and the beginning of autumn. It was said that nothing had happened yet. It wasn\u2019t because I really wanted to take it, but\u2026\u2026. If Seira\u2019s brother is saved and kept alive and Medea could protect them, wouldn\u2019t it be compensation for taking Lyle away from Seira?In addition, if I appointed Seira, who is skilled in swordsmanship, as my escort knight, I would be able to support Seira\u2019s dream to be a knight.There will be overenthusiastic writers who try to kick, interfere, sexually harass, and rape a woman for daring to be a knight.\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be better to have her dress up as a man? It seems that the uncle\u2019s child is still trying to murder Ian\u2026\u2026. It would be better if Seira came to the capital pretending to be Ian. Ian pretends to be Seira and manages the estate.\u2019If Ian left in the manor and took care of his younger brother Nicole, the original work would not be damaged, and Seira would become a knight according to the storyline of the novel.\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201dAs soon as he finished putting her clothes on, Lyle harshly asked Medea, who was lost in thought and did not even look at her husband who was in front of her.Medea raised her head and looked at Lyle with distant eyes and asked,\u201cI want to go on a retreat. Where\u2019s the Siloere province?\u201d***Naturally, Lyle immediately refused.Now that the summer was almost over, it wasn\u2019t a good time to travel, and during the harvest season was when taxes were due.The Emperor said that he should be guarding the capital.\u2018Couldn\u2019t I go alone?\u2019When Medea asked, only Lyle\u2019s unpleasant gaze responded.Medea returned to the Empress\u2019 Palace, surrounded by maids, while Lyle returned to his bedroom of the Emperor\u2019s Palace to change his clothes.Medea\u2019s request to go on a recuperation trip circled in his ears.\u2018I want to go on a recuperation retreat, I\u2019d like to take a rest.\u2019\u2018You want to go on a trip alone? Leave me\u2014the Emperor?\u2019While continuing to deny the feelings that fill my heart, Medea\u2019s words were unpleasant\u2014no, it was beyond simple displeasure\u2014they filled me with anger.It sounded as if she wanted to leave me in the capital and run away. And although Medea didn\u2019t express that nor did it seem like she meant it that way, knowing my own struggles of trying to keep my feelings hidden and cold I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if this wasn\u2019t also her intention.I knew why I kept getting angry, why I couldn\u2019t get away from what Medea said\u2014it was me, Lyle\u2014himself.But Lyle still wanted to deny it, so he was upset without understanding Medea\u2019s thoughts and unable to stop speculating about them.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t know that her injury and accident was kept a secret so that she couldn\u2019t use a recovery retreat as an excuse.\u2018I still have enough time. According to the novel, Ian is still safe\u2014for now. Before that incident occurs, I have to somehow make contact with them\u2026 \u2026\u2019The plan to use the recuperation retreat outing as a pretence to visit Seira\u2019s castle and then naturally become friends was finished. She needed to come up with a new plan.It was challenging to make direct contact because she was in the Empress\u2019s body.\u2018I need an intermediary \u2014 a person who can act like my limb.\u2019Since Medea only came up in the novel through Lyle\u2019s and her brother, Luke\u2019s memories, the description of someone the Empress could trust to act on her behalf was omitted.Additionally, the novel began shortly after the Empress\u2019s death and the funeral.\u2018Luke\u2026. Can I borrow Luke\u2019s power?\u2019Luke Francis Caird, aka Caird\u2019s heir and Small Duke, was the only person who missed the deceased Empress, Medea.In fact, even though they were raised separately and had few if any memories together, he still cherished her. He had no memories of her, and she had little to do with Luke because she had to go through the rigorous lessons of the Duchess since childhood.After entering the imperial palace, her father, the Duke, refused to meet her, which made Luke misunderstand that Emperor Lyle was using Medea as a hostage to seize power.He also believed that the Emperor spread rumors about Medea\u2014a trick to undermine the Empress\u2019s authority.It was no wonder he hated Lyle.And frankly, it was true that Lyle used Medea as a hostage against Duke Caird.This happened when he was just crowned, and Lyle\u2019s was in danger. But now that the regime is stable, it is only a seemingly conflicting political, mental battle.In this way, Duke Caird and Lyle were looking in the same direction.Unlike Duke Caird, Luke would probably be happy to assist his sister and would run to the Imperial Palace.But what would he say? \u2018Want to be Seira\u2019s supporter? Asking to raise Seira as a knight? Hmm\u2026\u2026.\u2019Everyone would be perplexed and wonder why the Empress suddenly thought about it\u2026\u2026The troubled Medea remembered that there was one thing that could be used; in the latter part of the work, a mine emerged from the mountain range of the estate where Seira lived.It was a vast mine that hosted quail-sized Velbright grade mana stones, of which it could fetch the same price as a handful of diamonds in her old world.Swamps and mountains surrounded the estate where Seira lived; additionally, it was surrounded by fog that made it doubly challenging to farm, but mana stones often appeared.That\u2019s why her uncle wanted to kill them and take possession of the territory\u2014a fact in which his nieces and nephews were clueless about.Medea felt accomplished and a little bit of pride that she was able to remember this fact through a briefly mentioned conversation of three or four lines revealing that Seira was able to develop the mine with Emperor Lyle\u2019s investment. And\u2026\u2026\u2018I\u2019ll be rich! Isn\u2019t that right!\u2019\u201cUm, your Majesty\u2014Empress?\u201dMedea suddenly leaped up on her massage bed, startling the maid who was massaging Medea.Medea apologized for surprising her and came down from bed, her eyes shining triumphantly.\u2018I\u2019ll send Luke to invest in the mine in Seira\u2019s territory. Ha ha ha ha ha! Although Lyle benefits in novels! Here I will benefit! The heroine and me and win-win! Hahaha!\u2019Of course, I laughed inside.***Medea prepared a letterhead but found out she couldn\u2019t call Luke right away.Medea needed to know if she had enough money to invest, and a number of preparations, such as bringing in someone who knows well about the province where Seira lived.After being eaten by Lyle last night, this morning, and this afternoon, Medea was suffering and needed sleep.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 What is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your pajamas, your Majesty.\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s pajamas! But why are they all vaguely see-through and shiny!\u201dShe was trying to change her clothes to go to bed, but the maids were recommending only negligees that are all pretty and sparkling.It was very soft to the touch, but the intention was suspicious, Medea rejected.\u201cHis Majesty might come.\u201dMedea clenched her teeth. \u201cHe will not come! If he has a conscience, he won\u2019t come. My body is already in this state, can\u2019t you see this?\u201d asked Medea incredulously, pulling the neck of the dress she was wearing.All over were flushed traces left by Lyle, who had not cooled down even after the love affair, biting, sucking, and licking Medea\u2019s whole body.\u2018You are not a beast\u2026 \u2026 . Why are you leaving so many kiss marks?\u2019The maid\u2019s cheeks were dyed red and gave soft exclamations, \u201cOh!\u201dBut Medea felt no sympathy from the startled audience; instead, it seemed to her that it was evidence or medals of favor from the Emperor.\u2026.\u201c[Sigh]..\u201dA maid tried to convince Medea again, who had her shoulders drooping.\u201cNow, his Majesty will come in every night. You have to get used to pajamas like this!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s too transparent.\u201d\u2018Do you want to see me wearing this kind of thing? It seems like it will embarrass each other.\u201dMedea\u2019s maid-in-waiting clung to her, pleading, \u201cIt\u2019s my lifelong wish,\u201d persuading her to compromise. Well, this was her wish.\u201cFine, but instead of wearing it alone, I\u2019ll wear a gown over it. Tomorrow morning, I\u2019ll change my clothes right away, so I\u2019ll bring the right clothes.\u201d\u201cI hear and obey, your Majesty, Empress.\u201dThe maid\u2019s reply satisfied her even though Medea clicked her tongue against the back of her teeth and looked at the maids with a disapproving gaze for good measure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who would have known he would feel like this towards Medea?How could he have these feelings for Medea\u2026\u2026\u2018\u2026..Let\u2019s look for her. No, I will never go\u2014It\u2019s too late anyway. By now, Medea must be sleeping.\u2019\u201c..\u2026.\u201dShall we take a glimpse of her sleeping? That much could be kept away and unnoticed by Medea.Of course, the guards would know and the Empress\u2019 palace, but you just have to crack down and seal their lips by order of the Emperor.Lyle, who had been agonizing for a long time while sitting in bed, finally got up from his seat.***When instructed not to make a fuss, the guards quietly moved at the Emperor\u2019s command.Lyle passed them and went into the Empress\u2019 palace. He had broken his own pledge, so he expected to be heavy-hearted, but the steps he took were light and fast.\u2018I\u2019m not doing this because I miss Medea. I\u2019m just checking to see if she is okay after we did it in the library.\u2019While he knew he was making really ridiculous excuses, Lyle struggled to walk with a brazen face. The guards who stood at the Empress\u2019 Palace entrance were puzzled when they recognized the Emperor.Fortunately, Lyle\u2019s attendants noticed and ordered them to be quiet, so they nodded.Now there was a small distance to Medea\u2019s bed, and upon reaching the entrance of her bedroom, Lyle left his servants with the guards and went inside alone.He found his wife\u2019s bed in the middle of the night, so it was right. Lyle had no intention of spending the night here. Even though he gave such words to the attendants, the attendants did not believe it.They recalled last night, until morning, and then their master went to the library to show such mischief, so of course, they wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u2018I\u2019m really just going to come out after a glimpse.\u2019It was the bedroom he had always visited on their union nights, but his heart was thrilled today, pounding louder and louder with every step he took.It was late, but the bedroom was tranquil.Lyle went into the bedroom without making any noise. Very quietly, he shut the door, headed across the thick carpet on the floor to the bed where the Empress was lying; in the middle of a massive four-poster bed, Medea was sleeping; the bed had two layers of curtains that were stretched and translucent like a thin veil.Being a Sword Master, Lyle could see better than ordinary people in the dark without light.However, just because he could see better than ordinary people didn\u2019t mean he could see without light.So Lyle put the lamp he had received from the attendant on the table near the bed, and the dim light spread out.Because of this, he would be able to see Medea\u2019s face clearly.Lyle approached the bed with a heart thudding against his chest.His breathing was shaky, his anxious mind barely able to ask what this was all about.I am just looking at Medea!I shook my head and stood in front of the bed curtain. Through the hem of the thin curtain, the outline of Medea was faintly visible. Um?\u2018Something\u2019s weird?\u2019The outline was strange. Medea is\u2026\u2026 is she sleeping naked?Lyle\u2019s hand, about to pull back the curtain, hardened as soon as he noticed it.Eventually, after a pause\u2014I wanted to see it, so I gulped and flipped the curtain without a sound.As expected, Medea was sleeping, but she wasn\u2019t even sleeping naked; it was even worse.\u2026\u2018Uh\u2026 Why?\u2019Lyle\u2019s face, looking at the sleeping Medea, turned red. She was wearing a transparent negligee.It wasn\u2019t the first time he had seen such an outfit because Medea had used many tactics to seduce Lyle.\u2018It\u2019s not like I said I was coming. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m crazy.\u2019Or do you wear these kinds of clothes on a regular basis?The thought that she might have slept in clothes like this in anticipation of his visit suddenly occurred to Lyle.\u2018No. I don\u2019t think Medea would\u2026\u2026\u2019But Lyle was already coming up to bed.What he had promised himself at the main palace was long forgotten, and the only thing that captivated him was Medea\u2019s nakedness.It was late summer, almost autumn.It was hot in the middle of the day and cool at night.It was warm inside the imperial palace, but Lyle wondered if Medea was cold in such a skimpy outfit.\u2018Did you kick it in your sleep?\u2019Her blanket was pushed to one side of the bed and was only on one of her legs. Medea was sleeping on her side, holding a folded long pillow.\u201cIf you slept with me, would you have hugged me?\u201dSuddenly, Lyle, jealous of the pillow in Medea\u2019s arms, pitched his dyed cheek at his stupid emotion\u2014willing himself to snap out of it.I will cover her with the blanket and go.Lyle shook his head, pledged to himself again.

That bewitching naked figure! Of course, eyes were drawn to her bouncy butt but the gaze started to peep at the pussy peeking between her legs\u2026.\u2018No! I am only going to cover her with the blankets and go!\u2019Lyle decisively cleared out his thoughts, screaming out of the rising dark feelings and chopping off his swelling spirit.But I really couldn\u2019t take my eyes off Medea.He knows the sensation\u2014the angle\u2014 when he pushes his organ in it\u2019s peak through her legs.It is the soft skin that coaxed him, and just by inserting it threatened to bring him to his climax, and when her tightening texture came to mind, the lower half of the body became hard.Lyle tore his gaze from Medea\u2019s secret place with a blistering face.\u2018This is just trying to cover you with a blanket\u2026 \u2026\u2019If Medea woke up, Lyle would have no excuse. So Lyle, very slowly, pulled the blanket up on Medea\u2019s leg.\u201cUhnnn \u2026.\u201dMedea sighed as if she had felt something.Lyle flinched and looked down on Medea, who turned and rolled on her back. Her soft breasts moved with her breathing under the thin transparent fabric.Each time Medea exhaled, her breasts swayed and moved up and down.Glup\u2026.Lyle was watching it like he was possessed and swallowed dry saliva without knowing it.Oh, shit\u2026\u2026. Why are you lusting and swearing at Medea now?After getting married, Medea never had this effect on him before\u2026.But all of those thoughts were belated regrets.It was only after Lyle embraced her it was difficult to be with her during their honeymoon.\u2018But three times a day\u2026\u2026\u2019Before and after ascending to the throne, Lyle was wary of carnal desires; the former Emperor was a lascivious man.It was rumored that he was able to deal with eight women a night.People simply dismissed the rumors, but Lyle knew it wasn\u2019t idle gossip.He also knew that sixteen women could barely hold their own and that every time the Emperor went down to the summer palace to escape the heat, he had dragged the concubines to hold messy parties. Only the royal family and some high ministers knew of it.So Lyle never went down to the summer palace, not wanting to follow his father\u2019s, the former Emperor\u2019s, example.\u201cHmm.\u2026. unn\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle, who had been lost in thought, quickly regained his bearings.Lyle gave up on covering Medea and decided to get out of bed.Lyle took one last look at Medea as he moved to the edge of the mattress.Medea scratched her thigh over her negligee. Perhaps it was not easy to scratch through the soft cloth, so she had pulled the hem of her negligee quickly.\u201cHuuhmp.\u201dWhen her white thighs were exposed to the air, Lyle quickly inhaled; Medea scratched her thigh a couple of times and fell asleep without pulling down her translucent hem that was gathered around her waist.\u2018Damn it!\u2019Lyle, who couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, untied the strap of the gown. As if angry, he took off the gown, threw it out of the bed, and even took off the pajamas.\u201cUuh\u2026 ?\u201dEven though it was a high-end bed, there was hardly any shaking, but it was enough to stir her.Medea rubbed her eyes and looked at the other person as if she was drunk in a hazy sleep, and awakened to a man approaching her.Even in the dim light, her beauty couldn\u2019t be mistaken. The angry expression even made her look sexier.Medea stared at Lyle.\u201d Uh.\u2026 ? Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cI want you.\u201d\u201cYes? Umph!\u201dHer mouth was closed before she could even ask why he was here.Lyle\u2019s hot tongue pushed into a flustered Medea\u2019s mouth, winding and sucking her tongue. Lyle grabbed Medea\u2019s breasts, which he had desired to touch for so long.\u201cHaaa!\u201dThe soft texture of the cloth over her breasts made Lyle\u2019s blood boil. As soon as she spread her legs and he rubbed in between them, and Medea was frightened.\u201cUhh ahhhh! Y-Your Majesty! What is this all of a sudden!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been waiting for me in this outfit, and you\u2019re asking me?\u201dMedea\u2019s face turned red at Lyle, who laughed.At that point, Lyle was convinced that Medea had been waiting for him.Medea\u2019s waist danced as his fingers rubbed her rich flesh.\u201cHaaah\u2026 !\u201dA sound leaked out of her mouth that didn\u2019t fit the mood, but it didn\u2019t do anything to distract Lyle\u2019s excitement.\u201cHeekk! Ah, huh?\u201dLyle\u2019s fingers dig deeply, and a little hastily wandered through the inside of Medea.Fortunately, Medea had also thought of Lyle and their affair in the library before she fell asleep. She tossed and turned for a while, thinking about him, and was still wet inside.Soon honey flowed down to her entrance, and Lyle smiled happily at Medea.\u201cLook, you are already ready to accept me.\u201d\u201cOh, ah! No\u2026\u2026. that\u2019s\u2026\u2026.Argh!\u201dSeeing her denying it out of shame, Lyle pulled out his finger and grabbed Medea\u2019s thigh. He pushed Medea\u2019s legs so that her body would fold in half and lifted her waist up so that her pussy was facing up.\u201cHeek! What are you doing\u2026\u2026. Ahhh!\u201dThe curled up negligee flowed down over Medea\u2019s belly button, and her pussy gleamed in the dim light.Lyle, who was positioned just behind Medea\u2019s waist, took his penis to Medea\u2019s secret place while his knees dug into the bed.\u201cUnnghh\u2026.\u201dHis meat stick slowly swept up and down her drenched entrance. Medea trembled at a strange thrill as they both watched a splendid scene.Her pussy with the open mouth fluttered as if wanting to swallow Lyle\u2019s penis.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Medea looked at Lyle through her legs that had descended on both sides of her head, wondering what he meant.\u201cNo, what\u2026. Huh, oh\u2026\u2026\u201dAs she hesitated and tried to evade answering, Lyle obscenely rubbed the tip of his penis drenching it with the pungent flower wine that was dripping down.Medea groaned, tightening her wet, flinching opening.\u201cIf you don\u2019t answer correctly, I won\u2019t give you this.\u201d\u201cHyuk \u2026\u201dMedea looked at Lyle, aware of her face burning. Why would you approach a sleeping person in the middle of the night and poke her\u2014What\u2019s wrong with him\u2014? Haaa\u2026!\u201cHunngh, oh! Ahhh\u2026\u2026. Your Majesty\u2026 \u2026 !\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already flooding. Look at how lewd you are, oh, Mother of the Nation.\u201dLyle clicked his tongue as he stared at the sap that began to overflow with nasty eyes.The transparent liquid flowed and fell onto the holes between her hips. Medea twisted her back in shame, but she was held tightly by Lyle and couldn\u2019t lower her ass.\u201cAh\u2026 \u2026 . I hate this pose\u2026 \u2026 . L-let go\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you tell the truth, I\u2019ll let you go.\u201dLyle\u2019s penis was moving up and down through the crack.The hard hot touch made Medea at a loss as to what to do.Medea had already been embraced by Lyle several times and knew the joy he gave her.\u201cIt\u2026 It\u2019s correct that I waited a little\u2026\u2026\u201dStuttering Medea admitted with a glowing face\u2014unable to speak more. Lyle\u2019s eyes were filled with joy as he stared at her face.Although he pretended not to have a facial expression, he seemed to be walking on the clouds when Medea said she had been waiting for him\u201cN-now let me go.\u2026. Ahhhhhh!\u201dLyle penis dug in half way as soon as she shyly asked him to let her go.Shivering from the lewd shock, he held Medea\u2019s small orgasming thighs and grabbed her ass, and pushed into her to his roots.\u201cHeeeh, Ha! I\u2019ll let go alright\u2026\u2026. Hoo\u2026 \u2026\u201dsaid Lyle in a hoarse voice as he lifted up Medea\u2019s shaking ass and angled it properly.\u201cSo, didn\u2019t I let go of your thighs? I never said I would never put it in there,\u201d he puffed as he started to enter her with loud wet noises.Medea moaned and wailed, her mouth open in a lewd manner.\u201cDid you make up that law? Ahhh, oh! Bullshit\u2026 \u2026 . Scammer, ahaang!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t say against the Emperor. You should give him a hard time until he admits he is wrong.\u201d\u201cHhhhhnngh!\u201dLyle, with his back upright, started pistoning violently. Medea\u2019s body shook intensely with only her hips and ass in the air against his striking, smacking waist\u201cAahh! Ahh! I hate\u2026\u2026.this pose! Haeah, I\u2019m ashamed!\u201dThe insertion wasn\u2019t deep, but Medea felt like she was committing a visual crime. It seemed too blatant to see a big monster of a penis, getting stuck in her wet mouth.The scene of the deep pink flesh drooping and getting wet and greasy penis coming in and out was so lustful that it was so debauched.Out of shame, Medea hid her face with both hands. She couldn\u2019t bear to see it. Then Lyle grabbed Medea\u2019s thighs with a sore face and widened it from side to side.\u201cHeek!\u201dThe movement of the leg tightened the inside, and Lyle pushed in his pillar with terrifying momentum.The wet skin rubbed vigorously and the sound of water rubbing the thick liquid coats of soft flesh passionately resonated.\u201cHuh, ah! Ah! Ah! Oh, oh! Ah-ah-ang!\u201dMedea was frightened at the overwhelming passionate provocation, clutching whatever she had in her hand\u2014grasping the blanket and reciting mantras.Her head quickly turned white, and a strange sensation seemed to roam all over her body.\u201cOhhh! Ah! Ah! Too fast\u2026\u2026. Ugh! Ugh! Ahhhh! Aang, Lyle.. \u2026 !\u201dIf you do something with your waist, you\u2019ll be swayed by it. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! The doctrines of lust rang out against the ceiling.Her breasts, shaking, had escaped the trappings of the transparent cloth and bounced and jiggled as Lyle moved.\u201cHuh, ahh hu hu\u2026 \u2026\u201dFinally, at their climax, Medea breathed harshly, and Lyle, buried deep inside, ejaculated inside Medea.The semen that had been pushed out to the entrance flowed down her ass and belly, soaking her pussy.\u201cHaaa, haaaa\u2026\u2026.. \u201cMedea trembled and looked at Lyle with pleasure-soaked eyes. This was the fourth time they had mixed their bodies together.Of the three previous episodes, Lyle has never finished with a single orgasm\u2014\u00a0gulp, it\u2019s not over yet.Lyle was probably going to do it three or four more times after this.Looking at his red eyes burning with passion in the soft light, Medea swallowed her parched saliva.The night at the Empress\u2019s palace was about to begin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was scattered in pieces. Next to the bed were the robes and pajamas that Lyle had thrown off\u2026 \u2026 .Sperm and traces of love \u2026 .\u201cNo! You can\u2019t come in!

I won\u2019t go far, so if you need anything, please call me.\u201dAdrenaline had rushed through her body, waking her up completely. Medea, who sensed the maid leaving the door, released a breath in relief and wished readers would read this and comment on that one villainess. She didn\u2019t want anyone to see her in this shape\u2026\u2018What the\u2026\u2019Medea grinded her teeth and glared at the blissfully sleeping Lyle sleeping who was hugging her waist.Why is he so energetic! Besides, why is his technique so good? \u2014And I never refused! There\u2026 \u2026 Not four or five times, you did eight times. Is he human? Even though he did that, his body is amazing.Medea shuddered in shame and slapped Lyle in the arm.\u201cOye, you have a political meeting! Wake up!\u201d\u201cUmmm\u2026 \u2026\u201dEven his low moaning voice was so pleasant to hear, Medea got goosebumps. Medea attempted to wiggle out of Lyle\u2019s arms and away from his chest. The arm holding her waist wasn\u2019t released and instead he tightened his hold on her putting her right against his chest\u2026..\u2018Umm?

There was a little redness on his neat face.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m touching your chest?\u201dShe said it matter-of-factly as if it was natural without even an ounce of agitation.Lyle glared at Medea.\u201cDid I say it okay to grope the Emperor\u2019s chest like that without permission?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty has also touched my chest\u2014Oh!\u201dBoth wrists belonging to the hands touching Lyle\u2019s chest were held in one hand and pressed above her head.When Medea looked at Lyle, with a confused look about his intentions, Lyle smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s forbidden to touch me because it tickles.\u201d\u201cIs that a law?! Hahaha\u2026 \u2026 . No, I\u2019ll touch you too!\u2026 \u2026 . Oh! Your Majesty is touching me now\u2026 \u2026\u201dLyle rubbed Medea\u2019s breast with one hand, his other hand restricting her wrists.Lyle laughed meanly, teasing her tight nipples with his fingers.\u201cIf you think it\u2019s unfair, then try to escape on your own.\u201dWhat do you mean? You\u2019re too strong!Despite Medea\u2019s indignant expression, Lyle was buried his face in her breasts, fooling around. Although he felt good about biting and sucking up a standing nipple with his lips, Lyle\u2019s suspicious behavior seemed to be angry.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cMillie\u2026 \u2026 You want to try to escape on your own?\u201dWith an innocent face, Medea pressed Lyle\u2019s penis with her knees. If there was a little more distance between the two, she would have done it with her feet.\u201cImpertinent\u2026 .\u201dHe said that, but there was no anger or bite in his tone.Medea cleverly rubbed Lyle\u2019s penis with her legs. Embarrassed Lyle hurriedly released her waist and tried to create distance, but then she fondled him with her feet.\u201cReally\u2026 !\u201dIn a hurry, Lyle\u2019s eyes, who released Medea\u2019s wrists, grazed a sore expression. When Medea escaped him with delight, Lyle grabbed Medea\u2019s ankle.\u201cYou bastard! Eh, wait! Wha?\u201dLyle spread Medea\u2019s legs apart, pushed his fingers through her entrance. Since they had been active until dawn, there was still a lot of liquid and smoothly accepted two of Lyle\u2019s fingers.\u201cYou unruly tomboy!\u201d\u201cHah! Huh! Aang, ahhh! Lyle!\u201dRelentless fingers stabbed Medea\u2019s sensitive spots; she freaked out and tried to get out from under Lyle.\u201cAhhhh! Argh! Oh no!\u201dShe was barely able to turn and tried to crawl forward, but that was what Lyle intended. Quickly, Lyle, who put Medea\u2019s hips against his side, began to crave another area with his fingers.\u201cAh, ah, ah, ah! Ugh! Ahhhh! No!\u201dMedea, who was caught by her waist, struggling, slammed and jiggled her ass.As Medea looked back, Lyle\u2019s finger broke through the crack.\u201cHuh, ah!\u201dHe bent his finger like a hook and stirred it as if digging inside, and a spark broke out in front of her eyes.When Medea reached her wailing climax, Lyle touched her convulsing interior and continued to tease her wet flower.\u201cAh, ah\u2026\u2026. stop\u2026\u2026. There, Aang!\u201d\u201cWill you never put your foot on the Emperor\u2019s place again?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hhhh! Ah, no! Ah-ah-ang!\u201dHer lower flower lips fluttered around his thick fingers. Her waist shook as he rolled and teased her flower buds smoothly with his fingers soaked in love liquid. Medea struggled with fright at the pleasure pouring into her body\u2014overwhelmed with sensitivity, but Lyle never let go of her back or stopped harassing her.\u201cAh \u2026 . Ah, ah. Ahhh\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dEventually, Medea, who had orgasmed over and over again, was exhausted and drooping.Lyle put her down on the bed with a bloody grin.\u201cWhat a cutey.\u201dChuckling, he kissed Medea\u2019s sweaty and weary forehead. With pleasure-soaked eyes, Medea, watching Lyle, glanced at his lower body.Is it morning wood or Lyle\u2026 \u2026 . He had already been erect, and he looked lustful, but he seemed to have a conscience, and he had no intention of penetrating Medea.Lyle swept up Medea\u2019s hair and whispered, \u201cGet some rest.\u201dLyle got up and headed to the edge of the bed, but Medea\u2019s foot struck Lyle\u2019s leg.When Lyle turned around, Medea shook her hips and ass towards him.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dBoth Lyle\u2019s face and Medea\u2019s face became red. Medea glanced at Lyle and then turned to the other side. Her appearance lit a fire in Lyle\u2019s chest, who had intented to gently leave the bedroom.\u201cThis\u2026 \u2026 little tomboy!\u201d\u201cHa \u2013Ohhh!\u201dLyle, hugging Medea from behind, entered her with his penis without hesitation.A shameful smile spread on Medea\u2019s innocent face as he penetrated her and rode her from behind.***\u2018\u2026 \u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to do this but\u2014\u2019Again Lyle, who was late for the political meeting, was frustrated.This time, he was about four hours late. Better than his 5 hours from before, but tardiness still was tardiness.\u201cWould you like to postpone the meeting, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cIt will be too much of a bother.\u201dLyle responded in a sulky tone at Sid\u2019s suggestion, but unlike yesterday, he looked excited, and there was a skip to his step.There was a glow to Lyle\u2019s face. It was an eyesore for Sid, who was recently dumped by his lover.\u2018No, no. If the overtime work disappears with this\u2026 \u2026 I will no longer be dumped\u2014she will take me back!\u2019Sid had to be tied to the Emperor\u2019s office, while Lyle had an unwavering love for work.The Emperor was busy with work, called him, and left him at a moment\u2019s notice\u2014how unfair! Sid was misunderstood by his lover.Since the Emperor was courting the Empress, Sid hoped he could say goodbye to those days he was in a deeper relationship with his work desk than his lover.\u201cWill you go to the palace again today?\u201d Sid asked, sneaking a glance at Lyle.Then Lyle\u2019s thinly veiled happy expression became subdued.\u2018Oh, what\u2019s wrong with you again\u2026 why is your Majesty getting so serious for\u2026 \u2026 . Why is this man so complicated?\u2019\u201cWhy? Does the Empress not want you to come?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that\u2026.. but\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dHis enmity against Medea was not completely resolved. Of course, the time spent together this morning was sweet.Still\u2026 \u2026 I keep wondering if it\u2019s okay to forgive Medea like this.Was it even forgivable in the first place?When I recalled that, I still felt discomfort. Intertwined with the buried disgusting memories of sexual abuse in my childhood\u2026 \u2026 I felt like I was going to vomit, but Medea, precisely what she was now, today, was like a different person.Just as people have been divided and utterly different before and after losing their memories, each look, glance, and expression were utterly different.Now Medea laughed, and I laughed in return just by hearing her voice.No matter where I looked, I couldn\u2019t recall the former Medea. But the two are one, and at some point, there will come a time when they would overlap.And Lyle was afraid of it.\u2018At that moment, you\u2019ll lose your lovely Medea. You\u2019ll never see Medea in the same way\u2014like she is now.\u2019Until he completely resolved his trauma concerning Medea, but\u2026 \u2026 But forgiving it was not an easy matter.It also felt unfair that I had to forgive it in order to love Medea: why and why should I let go of my hatred?My anguish, hurt nor troubles had not yet been resolved.And when he attempted to speak with her about it she had not been willing to apologise or understand him. In fact, Medea said she exercised her rights as his wife.How could I forgive someone that never even apologized?Now Medea has forgotten that\u2026 \u2026 Maybe I would never ever be able to receive an apology.\u2018Sorry? Did I want to get an apology?\u2019He felt that the whole situation was unfair, unpleasant, and disgusting.Rather he hoped that the person who made him feel this way would also suffer such distress, and instead of receiving a \u2018sorry\u2019 Lyle just wanted to get away from all of it\u2026\u2026.Feeling a sense of extreme injustice and anger at having to be entangled and bear the brunt of all these emotions and hurt he didn\u2019t bargain for.It may be inevitable that humans will hurt each other, but there were still some things we shouldn\u2019t do.\u201c\u2026\u2026 no. I won\u2019t go today,\u201d said Lyle with a cold, subdued face.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her body was tired, but she was in a good mood, so Medea felt somewhat excited.She woke up late, ate lunch, and spent the whole day idling around in bed.As she prepared to go to bed after dinner, she felt something was wrong.Yesterday Lyle had visited her during the day.There was no law that should be the same today, but something felt strange.The maids were excited, grooming Medea\u2019s skin and putting on a new negligee, but Medea\u2019s mood was gradually sinking lower and lower.\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll come.\u2019He is human. Was he tired after all? Did you have pain in your back? But there is no law that if you come to my bed, you must do it.There were so many things we could talk about and do together.Waiting for Lyle, Medea stayed awake until late at night. I really wanted to wait, so I waited\u2014No. It was because I overslept during the day and took a nap so I can\u2019t sleep. Tsk\u2014You\u2019re like that, well\u2026Disappointed, by midnight, Medea put a blanket around her neck and went to sleep.I wasn\u2019t waiting for him. I took a lot of naps so I couldn\u2019t sleep!\u2014 so I was just awake.\u2018Humph!\u2019***Lyle couldn\u2019t sleep either.I hate Medea though\u2026 \u2026 I wasn\u2019t convinced I had to absolve her from her past actions because of my new-found feelings for her.It\u2019s so unfair! She did lose her memory\u2026\u2026.. \u2026 Should I pretend to forget all the things she did to me and accept her?But those awful recollections still remain in me.Even deep inside, Lyle knew Medea, herself, was not so terrible.What Lyle really hated was the ugly women that raped him during his childhood, and the moment he saw them in Medea\u2014, someplace deep within Lyle, Medea had become one of them.So he hated it, and it became unacceptable; if they had been alive, they would have been shredded apart and killed hundreds of times.The former Empress used poison, but Lyle, ever since he was a small boy, imagined how he would have killed them a thousand times in a thousand different ways.As an adult\u2014when he realized it wasn\u2019t normal\u2014 he couldn\u2019t get over the feeling that he shouldn\u2019t have experienced such a thing. He was apart of the imperial family; if someone shouldn\u2019t have been touched\u2014it should have been him. It was so unfair.Instead, his position, which should have protected him, isolated him, with no one to sympathize with him or confide in.Nevertheless, Lyle wanted to see Medea.\u2018I miss her\u2026 \u2026\u2019\u201cMillie\u2026 \u2026 . Medea\u2026 \u2026\u201dWith a bleak murmur of longing, Lyle looked down at his hands on his lap. They were empty like his hollow heart.***Miledia woke up late in the morning and yawned a long time.Yesterday she took naps and fell asleep late at night. Medea created a strange sleep cycle to try and compensate for her lack of slumber.\u201cNapping can\u2019t make up for good old sleep!\u201d cried Medea to herself.There was a knock.\u201cCome in.\u201dWith the her pjs only slightly ruffled and her being fully clothed the maid must have known all night that Lyle had not come to Medea\u2019s bedroom, but she looked quite happy.\u201cGood morning, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. Where are my clothes to change?\u201d\u201cHuh? You weren\u2019t going to wash up first?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dOf course I was going to wash up, but I didn\u2019t feel like walking around wearing only a transparent negligee.Medea stretched out her arm wrapped in a negligee out of the blanket.\u201cI told you I wouldn\u2019t go around like this.\u201d\u201cHis Majesty didn\u2019t tear it this time.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dMedea frowned at her lady-in-waiting\u2019s reply.\u201cHis Majesty didn\u2019t come yesterday?\u201d\u201cHe did. I saw with my own two eyes that he was secretly sneaking out at dawn.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIn the middle of the night when Medea was asleep, Lyle secretly entered the bedside of the Empress\u2019s Palace, where Medea was asleep without a servant.Then he looked up at Medea, who was asleep until dawn, and then quietly went out,\u2018He came, but just went?\u2019It was a weird change.\u201cHis Majesty didn\u2019t wake your Majesty, the Empress, up? Oh my!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty must really care about the Empress! He kept in mind your tiredness from yesterday.\u201d\u2018Looks like she\u2019s writing a novel too.\u2019Medea shook his head and instructed the maid to bring her a change of clothes.It\u2019s Lyle.

But Sid couldn\u2019t say anything because his opponent is the Emperor, so he had to just hold it in.\u2018Why, why\u2014did I become the emperor\u2019s assistant?\u2019It was a coveted position that every noble dreamed of, but Sid was at the point that he was willing to give it to any party that expressed interest in it first.\u201cYour Majesty, is there something bothering you?\u201dWhen Sid asked carefully, the finger hitting the desk stopped.Lyle turned his head with a gloomy face.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cProblems need to be communicated in order to solve them. Problems are meant to be resolved. Please tell me. I\u2019ll be your Majesty\u2019s strength.\u201dSid spoke elegantly with his eyes twinkling, but Lyle\u2019s face was cold.\u201cOkay, go home. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any more work to be done.\u201d\u201cHey, ho!\u201dSid, who inadvertently cried out, looked at Lyle with a look of impatience.Lyle looked at him with eyes that could kill.\u201cGo.\u201d\u201cOh, okay. Then see you tomorrow, Your Majesty!\u201dSid\u2019s vows of being Lyle\u2019s support vanished; he was anxious that he would be pulled back in the office if he dwindled too long and quickly left the Emperor\u2019s office with his coat.Lyle, who was left alone, leaned his upper body back against the back of his chair.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs the surroundings became quieter, he thought of Medea more.Lyle shed a bloody chuckle, recalling the image of Medea he had seen this morning.What dreams did you see?She was rolled up on a blanket, and grunted as if it was stuffy. It was fortunate that the blanket was not dumped like the last time \u2014but it was also regrettable.Lyle sighed and recalled Medea\u2019s other faces.After Medea lost her memory, face to face appearances showed him many different behaviors and visages.There were many embarrassing situations where just thinking about it made Lyle\u2019s face hot, but there were other things that made it impossible for him to regard her as the same Medea from before.Lyle was falling asleep on his desk thinking of Medea. He had not slept the night before because he was busy watching her sleep while guarding Medea\u2019s side.\u2018Why are you doing this\u2026 when you can see her in person?\u2019Even though he admitted that he thought he was being pathetic, he couldn\u2019t help it.Lyle fell asleep with half drowsiness and half thoughts about Medea and leaning his chin on his arm against his desk.After half an hour, he felt a presence approaching his office.Knock knock\u2026At the sound of knocking on the Emperor\u2019s office door, Lyle raised his head with a deep sigh. He hadn\u2019t been sleeping properly, so my whole body was sore.\u201c\u2026 What is it?\u201d\u201cSire, her Majesty, the Empress, is here.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dFor a moment, Lyle suspected his ears. Unwittingly he jumped up and paced the room without answering.The inside of his head seemed to be coming up blank.\u2018Why is the Empress here\u2026 \u2026\u2019Unable to settle his mind, Lyle urgently shouted at the attendant outside the door.\u201cMillie\u2026. Is the Empress outside the door?\u201d\u201cHer Majesty is waiting in the hallway now. Shall let her in?\u201dAll the court officials knew that the relationship between the Emperor and the Empress had improved a lot now, but Lyle was still greatly embarrassed.He didn\u2019t think he should keep Medea waiting, but he still needed to prepare his heart\u2026 \u2026 .Lyle, who was moving around the desk, looked at the door with a puzzled face.\u201cFirst\u2026 No, let her in!\u201dHe said that, but his mouth was dry when he thought of seeing her.\u201cYes, Sire.\u201dAs Medea entered the office, the attendant quietly shut the door. Lyle held back his inclination to shout not to close the door.\u201c\u2026 What\u2019s the Empress doing here?\u201dWhen Lyle asked, Medea looked at him puzzledly.\u201cDidn\u2019t you call me? Your Majesty\u2019s aide told me you wanted me to come to your office?\u201d\u2018Sid!\u2019Lyle, who knew who was responsible, clenched his fists.Noting Lyle\u2019s confused expression, Medea quickly realized that Lyle did not summon her.\u201cSo you didn\u2019t summon me?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026\u201dIf she was correct, Sid was in trouble. He dared to impersonate the Emperor and summoned the Empress so that alone he could be imprisoned for slandering the imperial family.A stupid and crazy guy\u2026\u2026It must have been done knowing that Lyle would cover for him, but he was troubled.\u201cI called. Sit there.\u201dWith Lyle\u2019s hand pointing to the other side of the room, Medea went to the sofa and sat down. It was just walking, but the difference from the previous Medea was clear and strange. \u2018This Medea\u2019 he wasn\u2019t angry with.His chest was pounding, and Lyle was frowning.\u201c\u2026 You must be tired,\u201d said Medea as she stood up.Lyle blinked, unable to respond to the nearing image of Medea \u2026 Lyle\u2019s face turned red when she wiped Lyle\u2019s mouth with the cuffs of her dress.He must have drooled while he slept on his desk.\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2014okay! I can clean it!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dMedea stepped back, but Lyle couldn\u2019t lift his head in embarrassment.\u2018You\u2019re showing this ugly in front of Medea\u2014How can you be such a jerk! You\u2019re a disgrace\u2014\u201cNo. What are you so shy about? Even if you have some saliva, I too\u2026\u2019In front of Lyle. Medea turned her red face as she remembered herself gasping in front of Lyle, not knowing that he was drooling in pleasure\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle rubbed his mouth again, turning to Medea, who had flushed cheeks, seducing him with her cuteness.Get a hold of yourself.Lyle shook his head as if he was under a mental attack. His mind was distracted because Medea was in front of him.\u201c\u2026 Is your body okay?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not asking about \u2026. because of being with me\u2026\u201d Lyle glanced at Medea as he slowly replied. \u201cI\u2019m asking about your head. Your memory\u2026\u2026 Do you think it will come back?\u201dThere is no way it will return.Medea shook her head and realized that she was not being polite in front of the Emperor, and opened her mouth to explain.\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think it will come back,\u201d said Medea calmly.Lyle looked at her puzzledly at her tranquil reply.He and the people around her would hope that her memories would not return, but wouldn\u2019t Medea\u2014she, herself, be different?\u201cDoesn\u2019t it matter to you if your memories don\u2019t come back?\u201dMedea raised her head and looked at Lyle.Why do you ask me that? Didn\u2019t the Emperor have a bad relationship with Medea anyway?It doesn\u2019t matter if the memories come back or not. No\u2026 \u2026 . I am not good at etiquette, so do you want my memories to come back?\u201cIt\u2019s been a little over ten days, but perhaps my memories won\u2019t come back\u2026 \u2026 Because no one is here.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dMedea wondered if this would sound like blaming him. In fact, it didn\u2019t matter what Lyle thought. Lyle wasn\u2019t very important to Medea yet, so \u2026\u201cNeither friends nor family. I was injured, and no one came to see me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Duke was unaware of Medea\u2019s injury, but Lyle was unable to tell Medea about it.

It is said that the last time I saw the Duke, my father, was several months ago. I didn\u2019t know, so I thought to ask what I cherished and loved\u2026 \u2026 There was no such thing.\u201dIn fact, I asked for it for the secret funeral of the former Medea I wanted to host, who had actually died. Because only I knew that the real Medea had died, I thought about having a quiet funeral by burning and burying even the things the previous soul really liked.However, the former Medea didn\u2019t even have anything to cherish. I thought there might be something to remember her nanny by that I could find, but there was really nothing\u2026\u2026 Previously, it was said when Medea was angry, she threw objects and smashed them so that maybe that was the reason nothing was left.\u201cI don\u2019t know what life is without family, friends, or things I care about\u2026 I don\u2019t think I have any good memories\u2026\u2026. I don\u2019t think it doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t remember it.\u201dMedea spoke words with an expressionless face that left Lyle stupefied.She may have done evil around her, but she was his only wife and Empress. The fact that there was no one in her life made Lyle\u2019s heart cold; he was her family and husband, but Lyle couldn\u2019t say that.Lyle himself treated Medea so coldly after their wedding, and in retrospect, it seemed that Medea was always desperate. That\u2026 \u2026 He faintly thought that it might have been because he was the only family left to Medea.The image of Medea, who had always screamed asking him to look at her\u2014Lyle recalled as he looked at the current Medea, who seemed like a completely different person.\u201c\u2026 Mill\u2013\u201d\u201cWould you like to sit down?\u201dMedea\u2019s words suddenly stopped Lyle from speechless.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThis dress is heavier than it looks. Although jewelry is pretty, a stone is a stone. There\u2019s a bunch of stone pieces hanging off on me right now, so it\u2019s heavy.\u201dMedea went back to the sofa. Then tapping the seat next to her, he beckoned Lyle to sit down.***Pour\u2026\u2026.Hot tea was put in a teacup. The attendant filled the Emperor\u2019s teacup first and then poured the same tea into the Empress\u2019s cup. Lyle glanced lightly at the appearance of the attendant quietly retreating.The attendant quickly gave a bow and exited the office.\u201cDig in,\u201d Lyle said, and Medea picked up a fork instead of a teacup.A colorfully decorated cake was laid out for Miledia, who had become fond of sweets after losing her memory.After noting the difference, Lyle soon decided to push the thought to the back of his mind and forget it.No matter what he did, Medea was Medea\u2014 not someone else, but just changed bit\u2026 \u2026Lyle decided to think that way. It was irresponsible and selfish to tell her not to change to herself from before and stay the same after her memory loss.\u201cDon\u2019t you resent and blame me?\u201d\u201cWhy do I have to, your Majesty?\u201d\u201cBecause you are the Empress. I\u2026 \u2026 I\u2019m your husband.\u201dI hated Medea, so I didn\u2019t look for her until union day. And after getting back together, I went back to her bedroom again and again because I wanted to.After reviewing his action, it was astonishing how it would have looked like in Medea\u2019s eyes.\u201cI just thought, \u2018Your Majesty had a bad relationship with me.'\u201dShe was frighteningly calm\u2026 Lyle\u2019s chest was tightening.Her unblaming attitude weighed on his heart, but an apology couldn\u2019t come to his mouth to the point of extreme frustration.\u201cIn the future, I\u2019ll go to the Empress more often. I promise.\u201dMedea suddenly lowered her fork and looked at Lyle.Her gaze was beautiful, but they were guarded, unlike when her emotions were clearly revealed, making Lyle anxious.\u201cDon\u2019t promise.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026 .\u201d\u201cMy memories may come back. My personality may go back to before\u2026 \u2026 It would be uncomfortable. I think it would be better not to make a promise.\u201dLyle realized that he couldn\u2019t refute her and lost his words.The wounds he suffered from Medea were too great to even accept this former Medea.It was a promise that should not be made as one could not promise eternity with true compassion.\u201c\u2026 Is there anything I can do for you?\u201dI want to help you.I wanted to help Medea in any way.Medea married the Emperor and was estranged from her family. She even ended up losing her husband.Medea\u2019s actions caused her to be utterly alone but \u2026 It was also true that he, the Emperor, had a profound influence.So Lyle wanted to be a source of power to Medea.Medea stopped and looked at Lyle.Now Lyle was here trying to be nice to Medea because he had pretty good feelings for her but\u2026 \u2026 If Medea invited Seira, she did not know how he would change again.Lyle\u2019s set morals would not allow him to abandon his wife, but it was unclear how far the original script\u2019s influence would extend.\u201cThen\u2026\u201dLyle\u2019s mind fluttered at the moment, hanging on to her words. However, the following utterances he couldn\u2019t have imagined in his wildest dreams.\u201cIf you have a woman you love\u2026 could you set me free?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThis is what it must feel like to have your insides burned to an ash patch.Are you trying to punish me for not being able to say that I love you?Lyle looked at Medea, hiding his disastrous distortion. Lyle\u2019s heart turned black, knowing that this anger and betrayal he felt was not justified.\u201cYou don\u2019t need me politically anymore. So your Majesty will now turn to another woman when you have a woman you love\u2026\u2026 The concubine will enter your harem. You may want to make her Empress. So when that time comes\u2026\u2026\u201dLike a girl sweetly dreaming, Medea smiled shyly.\u201cPlease divorce me. Please allow me to remarry.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThe words left his mouth before he could even think. Medea\u2019s eyes widened in astonishment.\u201cNo, there\u2019s no possibility of me liking a girl and having an affair!\u201dLyle looked furiously at Medea with cold eyes.\u2018Who are you going to go to\u2013who is not me?\u2019There was a wave of terrifying anger at someone who hadn\u2019t evem yet appeared.\u201cDid you forget the last two nights? You may be carrying my child. Do you think you\u2019ll let the Prince\u2019s mother marry again?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026. Oh, I may not have it!\u201dSince this body hasn\u2019t had any children yet, isn\u2019t there a greater chance of not having conceived a child?But Lyle was resolute.\u201cNever\u2014I\u2019ll make it happen. So stay by my side. Don\u2019t think about running away!\u201dMedea didn\u2019t know where this hellish wrath came from.Don\u2019t you hate me? Then why are you doing this? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201cNo, this arrangement is good for you too! When you have a girl you like, won\u2019t you think of me as a hindrance?\u201dYou\u2019re the girl I like\u2026 \u2026 !Lyle, who was about to burst out of anger for a moment, grinded his teeth together; knowing he was selfish, but he couldn\u2019t let Medea go. It was only a few days, but it seemed that he couldn\u2019t live without her anymore.\u201cTo me, you\u2019ll be the only woman in my life. So don\u2019t say that again.\u201dPretending to be unaware of Medea, staring at him with disapproval, Lyle added:\u201cI will be visiting your bed tonight. Get ready and wait.\u201dThen, as if there was nothing more to say, he got up first and left the office.Medea, who was left alone, was stunned:\u2018I\u2019m fed up! Do you think I\u2019ll just keep doing it with you if you say you want to do it?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just because I\u2019ve slept with you for a night or two doesn\u2019t mean I belong to you!She wondered about how to get revenge, but there was no way since Medea was not a powerful Empress.Additionally, Medea had other things to do:\u2018I also need to find a way to invest in the mines on Seira\u2019s estate.\u2019She asked her maids-in-waiting to find experts on the Silore region. So Medea still needed to wait a couple of more days:\u2018I still have time, but this concerns my life. I wish I could deal with it cleanly and clearly\u2026\u2026\u2019Medea needed help, and the only person who came to her mind right now was Luke. She had thought about asking Lyle for a while, but looking at his attitude today made her reconsider him as a choice.\u2018Can I trust Luke? Luke wouldn\u2019t be suspicious of me because he hasn\u2019t met Medea years before her death\u2026\u2026\u2019The Medea that Luke remembered was years ago when she took classes under their mother\u2019s command, the Duchess. He had only peeked at her a couple of times from afar. A dazzlingly beautiful sister that clearly remained in the memory of a four-year-old until he reached adulthood. He received a rigorous education under the orders of their father, Duke Ceiard, and wandered as a knight, so he didn\u2019t see Medea again.After receiving the knighthood and ascending to the position of a small duke, Luke tries to meet Medea but ends up meeting her coffin instead.Facing his sister\u2019s corpse, his vague disapproval for Lyle transforms into outright hatred.\u2018I guess Luke would be a good choice.\u2019Medea asked a maid to bring a letterhead and started to write a letter to Luke, stating that she would like to meet him soon.It was difficult for her to visit, so she wanted Luke to come to the Imperial Palace. Medea sealed the letter with beeswax and handed it to the maid.\u201cGive this to Luke, son of the Duke of Ceiard.\u201d\u201cYou mean the small duke?\u201dPerhaps because Medea hadn\u2019t even mentioned the duke until now, the maid asked Medea, a bit surprised.\u201cDid he become a duke?\u201dAt the time of the funeral in Medea, Luke was already a small duke, but the exact timing was not known because it was expressed in a few lines in the novel.\u201cYes, he became the small duke a while ago.\u201d\u201cI see, then give it to the small duke. Ask the messenger to wait and get a reply on the spot. I don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d\u201cOh, yes\u2026\u2026\u201dI added in case the letter might be intercepted.The maid left the room with a letter from Medea with a pale face.Why did she have that face? Does Lyle still hate Medea contacting the Duke?Medea considered the Duke the Duchess\u2019 accomplice and therefore scorned him. And she had no interest in her younger brother Luke.So she never contacted the Duke of Ceiard first, and although the Emperor hated Medea, he established her as the Empress. As such, a sufficient budget was allocated to her, so Medea never had to ask for help from the duke.The Duke of Ceiard said there was no reason to visit her unless she needed his charity to uphold the dignity of his house\u2019s name.Anyways Medea sent a letter to Luke, hoping for his assistance, and wondered how to avoid the Emperor at night.\u2018.\u2026Should I just run away?\u2019Last time I was caught because I was unlucky, but I wouldn\u2019t have encountered Lyle if I had been hiding in one of the many and many bedrooms of the Empress\u2019s Palace.\u2018Before night falls, let\u2019s find a suitable location and hiding place!\u2019Medea left the bedroom and began wandering around the palace, gleeful and jovial for coming up with such an amusing prank.***Lyle was impatiently waiting for the time to pass. Medea was in the Imperial Palace, so she could not go anywhere without his permission as the Emperor.And even though my mind knew it in concept, my heart was anxious just because I couldn\u2019t see her. I wanted to go to the Medea right now, but I wasn\u2019t so brazen with so many eyes around me, watching and whispering about my every move.\u2018Even I know I am overreacting.\u2019As Lyle watched the sunset, he wondered how he must look in Medea\u2019s point of view\u2026 probably arbitrary, dictatorial, difficult\u2026.He knew\u2013but he couldn\u2019t be sane when he heard Medea utter the words,\u2018Divorce\u2026 \u2026 .\u2019Medea had never even entertained the idea before; if it had been the former Medea, just saying the word divorce would have made her tremble with anger.But now Medea\u2026\u2026.\u2018If there is a woman your Majesty loves\u2026 \u2026 Then can you set me free?\u2019Free.Just the mere thought of the word coming out of her mouth chilled his blood.Before, he couldn\u2019t stand Medea\u2019s face, and now within the span of a few days, she became the opposite of the person he had loathed.And it was natural that Medea detested him. He hadn\u2019t even checked on her after her accident. Instead, he had been mainly concerned about whether or not the accident was adequate grounds to skip their union night.And now he realized the tables had turned; the current Medea had offhandedly called the Empress position a \u201cmannequin\u201d with stones [jewels] attached to her dress.Being Empress meant nothing to her. Lyle understood this but wasn\u2019t going to let go.We are already married, and you\u2019ve moved my heart. I won\u2019t\u2026\u2026\u201cI\u2019m not going to leave you alone anymore\u2026\u2026\u201dEven after such a vow, Lyle knew that his past sins of neglect would not be erased, but he could think of nothing else except to make it up to Medea through his actions.Why don\u2019t you ask me for something?Lyle\u2019s heart was full, he was sure he could listen and grant any request in the world as long as she asked it. [tn: err\u2026. didn\u2019t she ask for a divorce?]The sun completely tilted over the mountain, and the darkness began to fall.Right away, Lyle wanted to run to the palace where Milledia would be waiting, but Lyle decided to take more time.Even though I knew it was a useless play, I could only protect myself like this.Darkness spread slowly as my stomach burned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Empress\u2019s?\u201dAs he entered the ducal estate, Luke could not believe his ears.I can\u2019t believe my sister contacted me first! It\u2019s never happened before!\u2018Did something happen, Sister? Is something wrong?\u2019Luke knew that his father, the Duke of Ceiard, did not have a pleasant personality\u2014in fact, he had a rather harsh temper, and Medea adopted this trait because of the Emperor\u2019s treatment towards her.His letters requesting a meeting were unanswered and sent back, and when there was an answer, it was that she was too busy.Luke did not know precisely how the Duke and Duchess treated Medea because he left home for his intense education during his early childhood.He only knew to obey the Emperor\u2019s command and uphold the Empress\u2019 family\u2019s dignity with his father.Luke, who had developed a fantasy about the Duchess, who remained only as a portrait to him, longed for Medea, who was said to have resembled her.Luke was delighted that he finally had a chance to meet Medea and said,\u201cAny day will do because my sister asked for it first! No. Right Now\u2013!\u201d\u201cLord.\u201dThe butler held Luke back, who was readying to run to the Imperial Palace.Medea was the Empress of the Empire before she was a sister. Even if Luke was the dukedom\u2019s son and heir, the Imperial Palace wasn\u2019t a place where you couldn\u2019t go in and out at will unless you received an invitation and made an appointment in advance.\u201cI\u2019m sure the Empress has a schedule. I understand that you are happy, but a messenger is awaiting your response, so please write a reply and send it.\u201dAt the butler\u2019s words, Luke paused and blushed.\u201cYes, I suppose\u2026 . Well. Since you are the Empress, you must be busier than I am. Wait a minute.\u201dLuke strode to the nearest office.He picked up his sharpest quill, dipped it in ink, and smoothly wrote a reply in his finest handwriting. Luke, who had finished inscribing and sealed it well to prevent the ink from spreading and left the office shortly afterward. \u2026\u201cDeliver this promptly \u2026.We must not keep the Empress waiting.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201dThe courier took the letter from Luke. In the courtyard of the messenger immediately climbed onto his horse and exited the duke\u2019s residence.Luke\u2019s hopeful chest swelled with anticipation as he watched the carrier ride away.He didn\u2019t know how soon Medea would reply, but he was already brimming with anticipation and eagerness.***The day was completely dark, and his work became quiet.Lyle left his office and headed to the Empress\u2019s Palace, reasoning that there was no need to delay his arrival any longer.He assumed things would go smoothly and peacefully because he had promised to sleep in the palace in advance.However, when he arrived, the palace was noisier than ever.\u201cWhat\u2019s the fuss?\u201dAt Lyle\u2019s scheduled visit, the maids and servants fretted.It was not uncommon to see servants and maids scrambling and rushing about, but even the guards\u2019 complexion paled.\u201cI asked what\u2019s this fuss about.\u201dLyle frowned at them, annoyed that they did not speak up, and instead simply glanced at each other.A woman stepped forward, shaking. She was one of the maids attending Medea.\u201cHer Majesty, the Empress\u2026. is gone.\u201dShe explained that Medea, who hurriedly insisted on touring the Empress\u2019s Palace at one point, completely disappeared.She disappeared? Does that make sense?Medea was the Empress. Because of her affinity for accidents, more than ten maids attended her. The same was the case when she was in a room, and even more maids followed to attend to Medea when she left a room. In fact, Medea was only alone if she was in her own bedroom and specifically ordered her maids to leave and after much hassle.\u2018Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 she ran away again?\u2019As soon as I thought about it, my heart became cool.I promised to stop by at night, so you must be trying to avoid me. This is not the first time we have spent the night together after losing your memories\u2014Why?!It was like throwing oil on my burning heart that I had just managed to calm down.I can\u2019t believe she did this on the very same day she asked for a divorce and said that she wished she could remarry afterwards!Lyle was beyond furious. His confusion further amplified his wrath. He did not know why his heart was burning with fury.Lyle looked back at the frightened courtiers, who saw a bit of madness flash through his eyes.\u201cWhere was the Empress last seen?\u201d***You\u2019re not going to look here.Medea returned to her bedroom, with no one the wiser. She wasn\u2019t thinking of sleeping with Lyle, so she didn\u2019t go to her bed.Medea instead hid in the dressing room attached to her bedroom, inside the largest wardrobe in the room. No one would think to look here. They were searching for an adult, not a child.She figured if Lyle did come by at night and didn\u2019t find her and left, yes, he would get angry. But it was Lyle. The male protagonist. Lyle never pushed Medea into jail or did anything harsh. Because he was the male protagonist in this novel.\u2018By the way\u2026 \u2026 This is really an incredibly huge wardrobe cabinet.\u2019It was so massive that even when an adult like Medea could stretch out both feet and arms and it\u2019s walls barely touched her fingertips and toes.\u2018Well, it\u2019s because the dresses are big too. You need large furniture like this.\u2019Medea laid down on the floor of her wardrobe chest, looking up at the lace and ornaments on the dresses.In a typical home, this chest\u2019s bottom floor would be crowded with items, like shoes, bags\u2026Well, in a typical home, there was no such thing as such a large wardrobe.I was about to die from boredom playing and striking the lace hem of my dress with my fingertips when\u2026 \u2026 I heard a loud disturbance.\u2018Huh?\u2019The door of the dressing room opened, and the sound of heavy footsteps approached me.It stopped in front of the wardrobe where Medea was hiding.[t1v: OMOMOMOMOMOMOOOOOOO AHHHHH]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She held her breath and quietly squeezed herself to the corner.At that moment.Bang!The door opened, and the dresses hanging in the chest were pushed aside.\u201cMedea \u2026\u201dLyle growled. Medea looked up at Lyle with an awkward expression.She knew someone would be looking for her, but she didn\u2019t expect Lyle, the Emperor, would search and find her himself again.\u201cY-your M-majesty, how could you\u2014yourself\u2026. Ahh!\u201dLyle bent down into the chest, grabbed Medea\u2019s waist, and plucked her out as if lifting a child. Medea struggled in fright, and in response, Lyle slapped her ass.\u201cEk! What are you doing!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d like to ask.\u201dLyle, who held Medea, glared at her, suppressing his anger.\u201cWhy are you hiding in the closet when you should be waiting for me in the bedroom?\u201d\u201cH-hiding?\u201d\u201cOr were you trying to play hide-and-seek?\u201dasked Lyle with a frigid laugh.He looked furious, so Medea avoided his glare, glancing at the floor.\u201cI-I didn\u2019t like the clothes I was wearing\u2026 \u2026. While choosing clothes, I fell asleep.\u201d\u201cAfter closing the dresser door.\u201d\u201cIf the maids found me\u2026 \u2026 It would take three or four hours to try on this suit and that suit\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still trying to talk your way out of this.\u201dLyle snorted and laughed as he left the dressing room, hugging Medea.Behind Lyle, the handmaids and attendants watched with them with anxiety. When the Emperor came out of the dressing room and enter the bedroom, he did not head towards the bed but instead towards the door.\u2018Huh?\u2019He walked out of Medea\u2019s bedroom.\u201cUh\u2026 . Wh\u2026 \u2026 Uh, where are we going\u2026\u2026?\u201dYou\u2019re not gonna put me in jail, are you?For a moment, Medea panicked and nervously asked Lyle, but Lyle didn\u2019t even glance at Medea.\u201cThe Empress will be living with me at the main palace as of today.\u201d\u201cWe hear and obey your Maj\u2014\u201d\u201cAck\u2014 why?\u201dBefore the couriers could reply with their affirmation, Medea, who was still in Lyle\u2019s arms, shook, furious. Lyle looked at Medea with a fierce look.\u201cWhy?\u201dMedea felt his bloody gaze.\u201cIs that the voice of the Empress, who fled from sharing the Emperor\u2019s bed twice?\u201d\u201cI-I never ran away.\u201d\u201cHo\u2014Really?\u201dLyle hurriedly walked down the hallway that led to the main palace ignoring his train of escorts, guards, and attendants urgently following him.\u201cLet\u2019s see if that\u2019s true or not\u2014in my bed.\u201d***There was a considerable distance from the Empress\u2019s Palace to the Main Palace where the Emperor lived. In the meanwhile, Lyle never put Medea down.Rather than letting her down, the arms that held her were firm, not coloured by fatigue or tremors.The addition of the weight of her dress meant she should have exceeded the weight of an adult man. Medea was in awe of Lyle\u2019s strength.While the Empress\u2019s Palace focused on the splendor and elegance, the Main Palace seemed to focus on highlighting the Imperial family\u2019s dignity with grandeur and spirit.The high ceilings were filled with arts related to the empire\u2019s past emperors, with their statues and portraits all around.In the lavishly marbled hall, precious gems and gold were used to illustrate the wealth of the empire generously.Lyle stridingly walked past it all with indifference.The Emperor\u2019s residence was located at the Main Palace\u2019s innermost part and was the largest complex in the Main Palace.At every juncture, the guards, servants, and knights were surprised to see the Emperor carrying the Empress in his arms.Medea protested and pleaded her case, having to pull the hem of her clothes down each time, but Lyle didn\u2019t pay her any mind.At the eighth enormous, spacious corridor reminiscent of a hall, they finally reached the Emperor\u2019s quarter.The main palace was kept strictly.It was common for the Imperial family to return on a whim, so when the Emperor who was expected to spend the night at the Empress\u2019s Palace returned, the servants hid their surprise and showed professional courtesy to the Imperial couple.Lyle\u2019s bedroom had already been perfectly prepared.Boom!The door to the bedroom opened, and Lyle with Medea in one arm entered. As Lyle strode toward the bed, an attendant who followed them quietly shut the door without a sign.Medea stole a glance while being held to Lyle\u2019s chest.You\u2019re not going to throw me onto the bed like in the movies, are you? It\u2019s fun to watch it in movies or read about it in novels, but it actually hurts\u2026\u2026They arrive at the huge bed (which seemed to be bigger than the bed in Medea\u2019s bedroom); Lyle was also the novel\u2019s main character.Contrary to her stiff face, Medea inadvertently exhaled a sigh of relief when Lyle\u2019s hard arm lowered her on to the bed.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 It\u2019s too early to be relieved.\u201dsaid Lyle crookedly, looking into Medea\u2019s face with cold eyes.Medea glanced at Lyle, clasped his face, and kissed him.\u201c!\u201dInstantly, Lyle\u2019s face turned red.His anger didn\u2019t cool down with this, but the reason quickly crumbled on Medea\u2019s lips, which he had not touched in a long time.\u2018Damn!\u2019Medea\u2019s lips were so sweet and fragrant. Lyle indulged in Medea\u2019s lips in a frenzy, pushing her down on the bed.Why does it feel softer and sweeter than I remember? I felt like I was choking in dizziness.\u201cCheeky\u2026 \u2026 . With just one kiss\u2026 \u2026 . Um\u2026 \u2026 . Avoid punishment\u2026 \u2026 There will be, ha\u2026 \u2026 . Is that right?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t intimidating at all when he said this while kissing. Rather, Lyle only confirmed how weak he was to Medea\u2019s body.Lyle was embarrassed by himself.What\u2019s that kiss? His soaring outrage had reached the sky and in an instant was captured, and instead, the vacuum it left in its wake was filled with fervor for Medea.If this situation was repeated, it would be undeniable that he wrapped around her finger and skirt and would listen to whatever she wanted.\u201cHmmm\u2026\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m really possessed.\u201cAs punishment, I won\u2019t let you out of the bedroom\u2026\u2026. Stay here until you are forgiven\u2026\u2026 and serve me\u2026\u2026 !\u201ddeclared Lyle, raising his head and hurriedly took off her clothes.Whether or not Medea bothered listening to Lyle was a different matter. She was still breathing heavily from his deep kiss.Because Lyle had promised to visit the Empress\u2019s Palace that night, the garments Medea had on were simple.There was no corset, so as soon as he pulled down the dress, her breasts were exposed. Lyle grasped her fluttering, jiggling white breasts and rubbed her rose-colored bumps, and they quickly stood up.\u201cAhhh\u2026\u2026!\u201dI waited too long. I felt impatient since I had been waiting since day for the night to come.He roughly pulled off her petticoat and threw it out of the bed, and tore the small piece of cloth that covered Medea\u2019s pussy.Medea seemed embarrassed when Lyle reached between her legs and impatiently touched her lower lips.\u201cOpen your legs. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201dLyle opened her knees and buried his face into her core before Medea could spread her legs.\u201cAh!\u201dA shocked breath erupted from her mouth. She was surprised that the most powerful man, namely the Emperor, started to lick her underneath without hesitation. This isn\u2019t even the first time.Feeling the titillating thrill of doing something taboo, Lyle felt even lewder and spread Medea\u2019s legs wider.His fingers parted her soft, red, wet lower lips, completely exposing her entrance and her stiff aroused clit. When Lyle tasted it with his tongue, Medea\u2019s thighs trembled.She\u2019s so cute.With a hot inhale, Lyle breathed deeply into his rising excitement.I could tell that this passion wouldn\u2019t subside easily.To my annoyance.***Throughout penetration and pistoning her, Lyle repeatedly kissed Medea. The constant wet, lewd clapping and squeaking noises from going up and down her slit made Medea bashful.Lyle kissed, licked, and bit her soft lips for a long time as he twisted his member into her core. Medea twitched under Lyle, tasting peaks and climaxes again and again\u2026 and again. Four times, five times\u2026 \u2026 . As the eighth time passed, Medea started to think that counting was meaningless.\u201cOooh\u2026 ! Haaa, aaahhh\u2026\u2026. Ha\u2014Oooh\u2026\u2026. Ah\u2026\u2026.\u201dThere was no escape.She was crushed and trapped between the mattress and Lyle\u2019s hard body. Lifting her with ease, Lyle wrapped his sturdy arms around Medea\u2019s back and grabbed her ass with the other hand.\u201cHnnnngh, huu\u2026 \u2026 . Ahhh\u2026\u2026 ! Ah!\u201dI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re doing this, but I don\u2019t have any complaints because I have been tasting exquisite peaks several times. But I am starting to feel dizzy from feeling it too much. [t1v: Medea\u2019s thoughts]Saliva started to leak from Medea\u2019s mouth\u2014unable to close it, as she breathed hard and hot. As if he was happy to see it, Lyle kissed her opened mouth without taking his eyes off Medea.\u201cOooh uhnngh\u2026.\u201dTheir tongues tangled, and saliva mixed. A sticky sound rang around their ears.Medea twisted, feeling the tightness of his arms. Lyle\u2019s waist moved in deeply, as if afraid as if she would run away.\u201cHek! Ahhh! Oh, uh huh\u2026 \u2026 . Ahhh\u2026 \u2026 !\u201dHer vision flashed white with an intense orgasm because Lyle was able to stroke and rub precisely where she was sensitive. Medea looked blankly at Lyle, swayed by pleasure.Something about him looked wild and despairing at the same time, but she didn\u2019t know why. All she could register was that there was something painfully sad in his gaze.\u201cOhh, umm\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea sighed sweetly as he quickly kissed her trembling lips again.I thought it was going to be quite a long night tonight.***\u2026\u2026 Did I go too far?Lyle sighed as he watched Medea, who had fallen asleep as if she had lost her mind.He was self-conscious for pushing her too hard.Fortunately, Medea didn\u2019t seem to dislike it. She only looked at Lyle, a bit puzzled.Lyle was torn between feeling heartbroken and relieved that Medea couldn\u2019t notice his feelings at all. It was harsh but rather fortunate. If Medea saw his emotions, she would not be able to endure them.He didn\u2019t want to forgive her yet. Even Medea would hate her if she felt that he had to forgive her.\u201cMedea \u2026.. Millie\u2026\u2026. I love you.\u201dLyle had quietly whispered after confirming that she had fallen into a deep sleep. Smiling bitterly at his confession that would never reach her, Lyle held a sleeping Medea asleep in his arms.She was still in his arms. So she couldn\u2019t go anywhere. Lyle closed his eyes and went to sleep, thinking that would be enough for now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She couldn\u2019t find Lyle, who she had anticipated. Whenever he slept with her, he was late for political meetings\u2014but it seemed he was attending to his duties on time.\u201cI\u2019m hungry \u2026\u201dShe wasn\u2019t familiar with this room, so she couldn\u2019t guess how much time had passed.In her previous room, the light\u2019s brightness would have allowed her to guess whether it was morning or lunchtime.Medea looked around and found the rope to summon servants. The bed was so vast it was faster to roll a couple of times to get to it. As she pulled it, she heard a bell ringing somewhere.\u201cYour Majesty, you are up?\u201dA familiar voice came to the door of the bedroom. It was the main palace and Lyle\u2019s bedroom, so she expected a stranger, but it was her lady-in-waiting from the Empress\u2019s Palace.\u201cOye. Come in.\u201dMedea pulled up the blanket to cover her body, the door opened, and the maids came in.The maids quickly took in the sight of the room with such subtlety so Medea would barely notice.\u201cWould you like to take a bath first? Or a meal?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take a bath first.\u201dMedea came to the edge of the bed with a tired face. The maids dressed her in a gown. She yawned and was led by their hands to the bathroom.While bathing her and washing her hair, they told Medea that Lyle had gone to a political meeting but refused to eat a meal with nobility because he had \u2018an appointment.\u2019 The light in their upturned eyes inferred that the appointment was with Medea.Medea frowned at the thought,\u2018Now we\u2019re eating together.\u2019She had to admit it was fun to sleep with Lyle but eating\u2026 It seemed an uncomfortable prospect.How funny, she found it more uncomfortable to eat together then to share a bed with him.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Didn\u2019t the messenger come back yesterday? Why isn\u2019t there any news?\u201dRealizing that it was the messenger sent to the Dukedom of Ceiard, the maids quickly avoided her gaze.Hmm? What is it? Feeling a hint of disquiet, Medea gazed at the maids.\u201cWhat? Why are you avoiding my eyes?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty\u2026 \u2026 The Emperor ordered that correspondence is not allowed without His Majesty\u2019s permission\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dYesterday, when Medea was hiding, a reply arrived from Luke. But Lyle was already there, and when he heard the news while searching for Medea, he took Luke\u2019s letter away.\u201cNo! Why? Isn\u2019t it mine?\u201d\u201cW-well\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDid your Majesty not give it to you yesterday?\u201d [t1v: he gave it to her\u2014but not the letter ^_*]There was no mention of it! Medea hurried out of her bath, grumbling with an embarrassed and resentful heart. When Medea came out, the maids quickly approached her with a dress and underwear. Medea put on the clothes the maids gave her.\u201cWhere is his majesty?\u201d\u201cHe should be in the office right now.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dShe put on her clothes and even dressed up. Medea, who had finished, streaked out of the bedroom, and the maids panicked following the reckless Empress.\u201cEmpress, your majesty\u2026 .\u201d\u201c\u2014Empress, your majesty\u2026 .\u201d\u2018What\u2019s wrong with all of you?\u2019She couldn\u2019t understand, so she just glanced at them, left the bedroom, and crossed the living room. Just as Medea was about to leave through the Emperor\u2019s residence entrance, the knights blocked her path.What?For the first time since she possessed Medea, she felt her temper flare up, enraged.The knights expressed their politeness to Medea with embarrassed faces.\u201cGreetings, nice to meet you, Empress.\u201d\u201cOh \u2026. But you can\u2019t get out of my way?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s his majesty\u2019s command. Please forgive me,\u201d said two knights as they urgently knelt before her.Medea\u2019s mouth was left agape, stunned.You dare?!\u2014This cheap, stingy bastard emperor!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lyle entered the parlor where Medea was sitting. Medea, who was sitting in front of the tea table, turned his head and glared.His back began to sweat while, on the other hand, a treacherous whispered in the back of his mind: She\u2019s so cute\u2026\u2026\u2018Ugh, you\u2019re so crazy.\u2019\u201cMillie,\u201dLyle called Medea and glanced at the maid and attendants. They noticed and quickly left the drawing-room.\u201c\u2026 Give it to me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe letter from my brother.\u201dAs soon as he heard her request, Lyle turned to Medea who asked for her letter from Luke.Why did you write a letter to the Little Duke now? What are you asking the Little Duke for?Medea needed Luke\u2019s help to save Seira and her brothers, but Lyle, who didn\u2019t know this, suspected Medea was planning her divorce.\u201cDo you remember your brother?\u201d\u201cNo, but it might come back to me if we meet.\u201d\u201cYou weren\u2019t close to him. You were annoyed if he sent a letter and didn\u2019t bother to write back.\u201dLyle was indifferent to the past Medea but paid close attention to her relationship with the Duke\u2019s household.\u201cJust because I did something in the past doesn\u2019t mean I still have to do the same thing in the future. I am curious about my letter, so return it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhich option would make her less angry? Lyle took out the letter from his pocket. He tore the wax seal, opened the envelope in front of Medea, and read the contents before handing it to her.Medea looked at Lyle with a captious face.Inwardly, Lyle was ashamed but faced Medea with a brazen countenance.\u201cIt won\u2019t be useful to write back.\u201d\u201cWhy are you reading someone else\u2019s letter?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s not \u2018someone else\u2019s.'\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t even if it\u2019s not \u2018someone else\u2019s!'\u201dIt was Lyle\u2014not a stranger. The betrayal and anger Medea felt was great because she had never expected him to act like this.Of course, the betrayal was not because she trusted Lyle, but rather how disappointingly far his actions were from his label of \u2018hero.\u2019This isn\u2019t the action of the male lead of a novel. No, didn\u2019t this happen when the Emperor felt jealous of Luke for a while? But she was not Seira.Medea hurriedly opened the letter with many thoughts. The reply from Luke wasn\u2019t much.He was touched that his sister had contacted him first and asked to call him at any time when she was comfortable.\u201cWould you like to call on the small Duke Card?\u201d\u201cI will.\u201dMedea said coldly as she glared at Lyle.He said with a look that he wouldn\u2019t have a scratch on his face.\u201cYou can\u2019t meet him regardless.\u201dWhat?\u201cDid you forget you are on probation?\u201d Lyle stepped towards Medea. \u201cI forbid you from correspondence, escaping from my place, or meeting with others.\u201dMedea frowned at Lyle, not able to understand.He was much taller than her, with good posture and a superior build, so she had to look up.\u201cAnd your probation will continue until I forgive you.\u201d\u201cHow dare you! What did I do wrong!? Yesterday wasn\u2019t even a union day! Besides\u2026\u2026 we did, do it!\u201dShouldn\u2019t the Empress have some power? Why can you unilaterally lock me up and drag me around at will? Where is my power! I thought you said I was the Empress! Medea protested, but Lyle was unrelenting until the end.\u201cI made my decision, and that\u2019s final. Accept it already, Medea.\u201d***It was nice to be together, but I didn\u2019t know that Medea\u2019s screaming silence and fierce eyes would make me feel so distressed.Lyle glanced across the street and glanced at Medea reading a book. Lyle had ordered that book to be delivered to her and brought to his place, but because she was imprisoned here in the first place by him, she didn\u2019t seem to appreciate the gesture.\u201cMillie\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea, who was sitting on the sofa, turned away from him, showing her back as if she didn\u2019t want to hear it.Her eyes were glued to the book. Lyle couldn\u2019t tell whether Medea was actually reading the book or if she was pretending to read because she hated looking at him.\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep now. I\u2019m going to turn off the lights.\u201dBoth Lyle and Medea were already wearing pajamas. The maids couldn\u2019t even advise her to wear a negligee because of Medea\u2019s frosty face.Medea still had that same expression, but Lyle pretended not to know.\u201cTurn off the light,\u201d he said, and he turned off the lights even though Medea was still sitting on the couch.The darkness settled in the Emperor\u2019s spacious bedroom. Still, it wasn\u2019t completely dark because there was a magical flame in one side of the bedroom, spreading a dim light; Lyle glanced at Medea and went up to bed first.He wanted to go and embrace her right away but thought Medea would be angry.\u2018I\u2019m dying.\u2019I want to hug and soothe you no matter what you are upset about.He had an intuitive feeling that she was really furious.The livid glare of twin blue suns was something he hadn\u2019t witnessed before in Medea, even though the former Milledia had also glared at Lyle.But even though the same person was staring, the feeling and expression were utterly different.\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a heavy silence.Lyle, who had only thought of holding Medea in his arms all day, was nervous and despondent: I know you\u2019re angry, but\u2026\u2026 as expected, I want to sleep with Medea in my arms.He waited and wondered if she fell asleep as the sound of her breathing slowed and paced itself smoothly. Lyle crept next to Medea. Then he quietly held Medea in his arms.\u201cUgh!\u201dAt that moment, Medea opened her eyes and bit Lyle\u2019s arm.Lyle was surprised, pulled away, shocked.\u201cMedea! Did you just bite me?\u201d\u201cThen should I kick your majesty?\u201dEven in the blurry darkness, her glare was sharp and livid.Lyle was bewildered and faced Medea.\u201cAre you out of your mind? You bit the Emperor!\u201d\u201cSo how should I protect myself? Your Majesty is only concerned with your own wants, and completely ignores my will!\u201d\u201cMedea!\u201d\u201cWhat! It\u2019s my body! If I don\u2019t allow it, it\u2019s only right that no one can touch me! The reason you have held me is because I thought you were good enough\u2014 not because you are the Emperor! So now I don\u2019t want to\u2014so NO!\u201dMedea screamed, turning her body away and covered her whole body, including her head with the blanket.Lyle was completely taken aback and utterly shocked.\u201cWha- what?\u201dLyle was trying to wrap his mind around how absurd \u2018because I thought you were good enough\u2019 was\u2026. He should be furious but was strangely feeling better.\u2018Damn it, damn it!\u2019Lyle stared at Medea\u2019s back and couldn\u2019t even think about getting angry.When she sleeps\u2026\u2026However, Lyle was more persistent than Medea, who was filled with anger. After some time, Medea geniunely fell asleep, breathing steadily, murmuring some sleeping talking gibberish while the blanket fell off her a little.\u201cHaa\u2026[sigh sfx]\u201dLyle was going crazy. He couldn\u2019t touch her even if she was right next to him.When he couldn\u2019t see her, it felt so unfair, so he would sneak into Medea\u2019s bedroom to watch her sleep. But it didn\u2019t matter that she was in his room; he still couldn\u2019t touch her. His throat felt stuffed and burned to the brim.When they had gone to bed together, Medea would fall asleep in Lyle\u2019s arms as he hugged her tightly.Now when he slept alone, he hugged a blanket or pillow.\u2018I think I\u2019ve developed a sleeping habit now that I have to hug something.\u2019Now Lyle was attempting to sleep, holding a blanket tightly. It was awhile since the weather was hot, but it was getting chilly in the last few days\u2026\u2026After a long deliberation, Lyle gently pulled the blanket away that was in Medea\u2019s arms.Since she was sleeping, it slipped away easily.As if she was sleeping deeply, she couldn\u2019t detect any subtle movements and only inhaled and exhaled.\u2018A little more\u2026\u2026\u2019Lyle was worried about her waking up feeling cool but planned on covering her up again later. He finally gently pulled all of the blankets and pushed them aside.\u201cUhngh\u2026 .\u201dMaybe because it was cool, Medea shank and curled into herself. Lyle almost burst with laughter because of her cute expression, pressing his mouth together, holding back.Medea tossed and turned and then turned in the direction of Lyle\u2019s body. Even though she barely turned his body, the flesh touched through the hem. Medea, seeking his warmth, penetrated into Lyle\u2019s arms in her sleep.Lyle silently shouted joyfully, covering Medea and himself with a blanket. Then he hugged Medea tightly over the blanket.It was a satisfying night.***\u201cSlap!\u201dA hand attached to a shocked Medea hit Lyle\u2019s cheek. As if she had struck him on impulse, Medea\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, becoming huge.Lyle, who had woken up first and had been watching her sleep, was half resentful and half angry.\u201c\u2026 What are you doing, Empress?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to ask you.\u201dMedea stared at Lyle in astonishment as he held her wrist after she had struck him. He had been watching her sleep in his arms, which was why Lyle couldn\u2019t instantly defend himself from Medea\u2019s hand.\u201cYou dug into my arms while you were sleeping. I didn\u2019t embrace you first.\u201dMedea cried at Lyle\u2019s confident excuse:\u201cThen you can push me away! And what\u2019s with your hand on my waist!\u201d\u201cYou came first to my arms; why should I push you away?\u201d\u201cBecause I hate it!\u201d\u201cYou slept pretty well with your face stuck to my chest for a person who hates it.\u201dHe responded calmly, but Medea\u2019s words of dislike made Lyle\u2019s heart tingle. Medea glared at Lyle with a resentful face.\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again!\u201d\u201cNext time I\u2019ll take it as a sign of permission.\u201dLyle\u2019s blatant words of desire left Medea speechless.Lyle, feeling the urge to kiss her for a moment, glanced at her.Furious, Medea broke out from his grip and slapped away Lyle\u2019s hand and arm, hugging her waist.\u201cNow I woke up, so let me go!\u201dLyle was tempted not to let go until he kissed her but instead, he gently lifted the arm she hit.He couldn\u2019t even touch her. He just hugged her and slept.It was unfair.* * ****Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So many were relieved that it seemed better.\u201cOh, my\u2026 .\u201d\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d\u201cWhat is that mark on your face?\u201dLyle\u2019s expression crumpled as he walked into the meeting with a dignified step. Although this was the expected reaction, he was embarrassed, so the handprint looked redder.Lyle attended the political meeting, leaving it because it was impossible to cover it with makeup.\u201cI had to attend the meeting, but I couldn\u2019t get enough sleep\u2026.\u201dThere weren\u2019t many humans who could slap the Emperor\u2019s face. Actually, there was no one but Medea.The former Emperor and Empress had already died.An enemy of the Duke or Medea wouldn\u2019t be able to pull her from the Empress\u2019s seat, but it would be difficult if the fact that she slapped the Emperor was known.\u201cI asked the Empress to hit me.\u201d\u201cYes? b-but\u2026\u2026 .\u201d\u201cNo matter what, it\u2019s your Majesty\u2019s face\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle glared at the ministers with an irritated face.\u201cI!\u201dLyle growled with a furious face.\u201cI ordered the Empress to do it, I said.\u201dAt the Emperor\u2019s bluff, his servants shut their mouths at once.There were rumors that within a few days, the Emperor suddenly became deeply in love with the Empress. They didn\u2019t think it was true, but\u2026\u2026\u201cIt looks like her Majesty has fulfilled your orders very faithfully,\u201d said the Duke of Card.Lyle grinded his teeth.The ministers gulped and looked between the Emperor and the Duke.\u201cYes, the Empress is very healthy.\u201dThe Emperor instructed them to present the first item on the agenda in a blunt tone.***The strangely cheap reaction of the Emperor stimulated the curiosity of Duke Card.He knew the Emperor wasn\u2019t someone who would abandon Medea, but he was not also someone who would actively protect her.Come to think of it; the Duke had been informed that Medea\u2019s messenger had come by requesting to meet Luke. He had thought it might have been the beginning of a clumsy ploy to get the Emperor\u2019s attention. But it was strange that she hadn\u2019t contacted him even though he had replied.Duke Card asked for the Empress\u2019s presence while he was at the palace. Even Medea, who blatantly ignored Luke, couldn\u2019t completely ignore Duke Card.It was because of the power of her father, Duke Card, that Medea had been able to keep her position. If it wasn\u2019t for him, she could have been pushed out of the Empress\u2019s position for not giving birth to a Crown Prince. Due to political influence, the Duke of Card had no intention of pushing Medea out of the Empress seat, but Medea saw everyone as an enemy.So, while Duke Card hated it, he tried to pretend to listen to some of the requests she wanted\u2014testing him.\u2018Silly thing even though you have risen to the highest position possible to a woman, but all you want is for love.\u2019Lyle was a man who could become a generous and loving husband as long as Medea did not ask for love.Regardless, he was the Emperor. It was challenging to ask for love and a relationship as if he was an ordinary man.Duke Card felt irritated beyond contempt because of his immature and shortsighted daughter, who harassed the Emperor while asking for love.The only silver lining was that she was desperately trying to have Lyle\u2019s baby. At least that was the case. There was no news yet, so he needed to clarify.\u201cThe Empress, her Majesty is currently unable to accept anyone\u2019s requests for a meeting.\u201dAt the reply, Duke Card frowned.\u201cWhat does that mean? Is there anything wrong with her Majesty\u2019s body?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026\u2026 Her Majesty is now under probation according to his Majesty\u2019s orders.\u201d\u201cProbation?\u201d\u2018Is it because of this morning?\u2019Duke Card thought of the handprint on Lyle\u2019s face and clicked his tongue.He was foolish to wonder if the relationship had improved between themBut\u2026\u2026 Wasn\u2019t the Emperor\u2019s attitude strange? Being slapped by the Empress wasn\u2019t something to brag about, but there was no reason for him to shield the Empress with such a ridiculous lie.It was as if he held Medea in favor.\u2018Is the rumor true then?\u2019Based on the Emperor\u2019s demeanor, the wound on his face, and the Empress\u2019s probation made it seem like it was a lover\u2019s quarrel.However, the \u2018lovers\u2019 involved were the Emperor and Medea.It was difficult for the Duke of Card, who knew all about what Medea subjected Lyle to, to think that the Emperor favored her.\u2018Or does it mean that Medea now has a reason to be close with the Emperor?\u2019For example, if she with a child.But if it were that reason, there was no reason for the Emperor to keep the news secret. Having a successor was an excellent opportunity for the Emperor to secure his position. Of course\u2026\u2026 Lyle had consolidated enough power not to have to establish himself on such a base.\u2018I\u2019ll have Luke contact Medea again.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even when you\u2019re mad, you\u2019re charming. If I could just make you smile, I would feel like I can reach the moon.\u2019But since earlier, Medea refused to make eye contact with Lyle. Lyle felt desperate, and not being able to ignore his overwhelming feelings or hers was embarrassing.So he ordered the servants to bring all the things that Medea liked\u2026. romance novels and sweets, but Medea didn\u2019t even bother acknowledging them with any pleasure.\u2018Shall I bring you jewels?\u2019Or something like a dress or shoes? Do you like hats and other accessories? Those were things the previous Medea did like. Lyle, wondering what women may like, suddenly realized he didn\u2019t know what Medea liked.The maid had advised him that the current Medea had a completely different taste from the previous Medea.And it was not just one or two things, but everything changed completely.Maybe this is why he was captivated by her, but it also made everything even more difficult.Lyle, with a deep sigh, got up, went to a comfortable seat, opened a book, and glanced at it.Only then did Medea glance at Lyle and then got up and moved to another room.Lyle, who was peeping at her, was frustrated.Judging from the current situation, there would be no improvement in the next few days, and he would find no relief.Still, Lyle didn\u2019t want to let Luke and Medea make plans to run away.Lyle felt he couldn\u2019t do anything about the situation; Lyle shut the book he was looking at.He had come back early from work to be with her, but instead, he felt more frustrated.* * *\u201cYour Majesty, what are you going to do?\u201dThe maids who were watching with uneasy feelings came to talk. Medea looked at them with a sour expression.\u201cWhat am I?\u201d\u201cNo matter how upset you are, he is the Emperor. If you lose favor\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was unthinkable to say this to the former Medea, but now Medea was generous and lenient with her people.\u201cFavor? His Majesty hates me.\u201d\u201cNo, his Majesty put you on probation but kept you in his residence.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201dWhen she didn\u2019t understand and inquired, the maid looked frustrated.\u201cHis Majesty favors you and wants you nearby.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t he come to see the Empress\u2019s sleeping face in the middle of the night because he couldn\u2019t stand being away?\u201d\u201cYes, before, he came to see the Empress in the middle of the night.\u201dThe maids took turns saying a word. The first lady in waiting spoke again, trying to lay the final blow on an unconvinced Medea.\u201cHis Majesty is in love with her Majesty.\u201d\u2018What nonsense are you spewing. You think I\u2019m Seira?\u2019The maids seemed to think that Lyle\u2019s actions were explained by the fact he was so attached to her, but she kept running away.So it looked like he was desperately trying to hold on to her.\u2018I didn\u2019t seem like you hated me very much yesterday. Even this morning\u2026\u2026 when I accidentally slapped him, I thought it was a huge deal, and I would get in trouble, but he didn\u2019t get mad at all. Is Lyle interested in me?\u2019It would be a relief, but he would be wasting his feelings.\u2018Who was the male lead? Except for the heroine, the hero had an iron wall that no other person could penetrate. Such a man came over to me in just a few days?\u2018Such a thing is impossible,\u2019 Medea concluded. \u2018But maybe he favors my body.\u2019 When he seemed furious, she had kissed him, and she could tell his anger quickly disappeared.\u2018I have to meet Luke, but I have to think about how long it would take to get to Seira\u2019s estate\u2026.\u2019It could take a lot of time since there were no cars or subways.Medea felt a sense of urgency because she didn\u2019t know clearly when Seira\u2019s brother was murdered.\u201cWhat happened to finding an expert who knows the Solare region well? Are there any maids that work in the palace whose hometowns are in the region?\u201d\u201cWe found one. Shall I bring her in?\u201dIt was not allowed to bring in people from outside, but it seemed that it was allowed to meet those who worked in the Imperial Palace. Medea was pleased and told her to bring them to her.As Medea was waiting in the drawing-room, a maid with brown hair and freckles came in. Her name was Victoria, her nickname was \u2018Vicky,\u2019 and she came from a baron\u2019s family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

May I call you Vicky?\u201d\u201cO-of course! Your Majesty\u2014My Empress! It\u2019s an honor!\u201dSince she had a poor Baron family background, even as a maid of noble birth in the Imperial Palace would have hardly encountered royalty.While she was in service in the Imperial Palace, Vicky had heard her father passed away, and with him, the title disappeared; therefore, she lost any noble standing she had and could not be a lady-in-waiting.Vicky\u2019s fellow maids were openly dismissive and disrespectful towards her.\u201cI am curious about your hometown, the Solare region since there is plenty to learn outside of books. Do you know the nobility in the region and where the boundaries of their estates are?\u201dVicky\u2019s father was a knight who was bestowed a temporary non-hereditary title for his war-time contributions.Even if the title no longer existed, he and his family were nobility for a while so that they would have some information about the aristocrats in the vicinity.Sure enough, Vicky looked at Medea with a big smile.\u201cMy father\u2019s lord\u2019s estate was nearby, so I heard of many aristocrats!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMedea beckoned Vicky to approach the map of Solare that was laid out before her. The map was spread over a large table in the parlor as a tense-looking Vicky neared.Medea smiled at Vicky, who seemed a little frightened, and reassured her,\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. I\u2019m simply curious and wanted to hear some stories. You don\u2019t have to be nervous; I\u2019m not trying to quiz you,\u201dexplained Medea, recommending the seat opposite to hers.Vicky, who sat down with a stiff attitude, began to explain the region of Solare.***The main crops produced were potatoes and beans.Other than that, it was primarily a barren land with some rare herbs.The estates were also minimal because a vast mountain range encompassed the region of Solare, along with forests and swamps.Among them, the estate where Seira\u2019s brother was a lord was a corner close to the swamp.Since there is only a small amount of land available, it was land that collected the least taxes in the Empire.Instead, it was the place that ended up needing the most support of the Empire, especially when the demons came out.Vicky had no relationship with Seira\u2019s family but knew of them.Ian, the eldest son, had just come of age; his father passed away, leaving him to inherit the Baron\u2019s title and lordship of the estate.There was a lot of speculation around the Baron\u2019s* suspicious death. [*t1v: pretty sure Seira\u2019s father was a Count, but now the author writes that he was a Baron]There were rumors that the previous Baron\u2019s expelled brother deliberately caused a wagon accident and killed him. Seira\u2019s father died after suffering for eight months after the accident.It seemed that Ian\u2019s father had barely held on to life, holding out until Ian had reached the age of adulthood.Thanks to this, the title was handed over to Ian, and Ian\u2019s uncle said that he had no choice but to retire and resign.\u201cHowever, the previously young and healthy Baron\u2019s body is now frail, and whispers are circulating that the uncle is using poison this time. The family has another son, but I think it is five years before he reaches adulthood? I know there should be at least four more years because, between them, there\u2019s a middle child\u2026 a daughter.\u201dIt was Seira, the female protagonist of this novel.\u201cHow long will it take to travel from the Imperial Palace to that estate?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 \u2026 . Maybe 12 or 13 days?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 \u2026 ?\u201dWhat did she say-?* * *\u2018I overlooked the fact that this Empire was extensive and Seira was a noble on the periphery. Twelve days at the earliest\u2026 \u2026 . Even if the timeline is tight, it\u2019s too tight!\u2019I don\u2019t have time to scuffle with Lyle. If you don\u2019t meet Luke quickly and send him there, Ian will die!\u2018But, how are you going to persuade Lyle -!?\u2019Medea was utterly frustrated and troubled.What did Lyle say? Didn\u2019t he say that her probation would continue until he forgave her\u2014but when would he forgive? A week? A month? There was no set time\u2014only the vague \u2018until I forgive you.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m not a kid! But isn\u2019t he treating me like a kid? But he\u2019s the Emperor\u2026 \u2026\u2019Medea decided to brainstorm as to why Lyle might be upset.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We slept together! And it\u2019s not just that\u2014it was fun. We did it so much! Jerk!\u2019Lyle trapped her in his palace under this pretext, but Medea couldn\u2019t even dream that Lyle liked her and didn\u2019t want to lose her.\u2018What was the reason? [cue: cardi b] If I promise \u201cI won\u2019t create a commotion from now on,\u201d would you release me?\u2019He said that, but Medea had an inkling that Lyle wasn\u2019t transparent with his real purpose.If it\u2019s like that, why wasn\u2019t he forthcoming instead of locking her in his bedroom?\u201c\u2026..\u2026\u201dWas it about my body?She thought about it, and no other reason came up.He insisted on using the same bed, and when they did sleep together, he always tried to snuggle up\u2026\u2026.\u2018It\u2019s not bad sleeping with Lyle, but\u2026\u2026\u2019Medea was put in a bad mood, thinking she was being used for only her body.\u2018If I said that I\u2019d be obedient and sleep with you often, would you let me go?\u2019Ian\u2019s life was in danger right now, so Medea was desperate. Even if she met Luke, there is no guarantee that he would listen to her right away\u2026\u2026.To persuade or prepare? Time was running out.\u2018If you don\u2019t relieve Lyle\u2019s feelings\u2026\u2026\u2019In the morning, Medea had slapped Lyle and then proceeded to ignore him for hours afterward. Would Lyle be happy to see her sudden change in attitude now?\u2018Maybe he\u2019s still angry right now\u2026\u2019It had been a long while since she had dismissed Vicky. Medea, who had escaped from the parlor, beckoned her maids and sneaked up to the bedroom\u2014where she found the door was open.Lyle was sitting by the window alone.As he sensed a presence approaching the door, he blinked out of his reverie and looked around.\u201cMedea.\u201dSurprised, Medea sensed the strange mood.It was like\u2026\u2026 it looked like he was lonely and sweetly waiting for her.Medea meandered into the bedroom. She shut the door in case any embarrassing words would be exchanged. She didn\u2019t want to worry about eavesdropping servants.Medea wasn\u2019t sure if it was her wishful imagination, but Lyle seemed a little nervous when she closed the door.Medea peeked at Lyle\u2019s apprehensive glances.\u201cIn the morning\u2026\u2026 the slap in the morning was too much. I\u2019m sorry, Your Majesty,\u201dAs she spoke, Lyle\u2019s face relaxed.\u201cNo. It was a mistake, so it\u2019s okay. The handprint is almost gone\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Medea didn\u2019t continue, and they just stared at each other. Lyle eagerly approached her.He took her hand.And felt relieved to see Medea didn\u2019t shake him off.\u201cCome this way and sit down.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs they sat side by side on the long sofa and staring at each other, a laugh of joy was seized in Lyle\u2019s mouth.Just by looking at Medea\u2019s face, it seemed that his feelings would burst forward.\u201cShall I bring the tea out?\u201d\u201cNo. Everyone keeps only recommending snacks\u2026\u2026\u201dIt is the same with the maids who didn\u2019t know any other way to relieve Medea\u2019s stresses, so they often recommend tea and sweets.At first, Medea liked it, so she ate it, but after a while, she got sick and tired of it.After all, it would be best if you only ate something delicious sparingly.\u201cYour Majesty told me to keep my manners and act appropriately. Then you would release me\u2026\u2026. Just, what manners should I specifically keep?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLyle looked up at Medea in surprise at her inquiry.So you\u2019re trying to make me relax, unguarded so that you can look at my feelings?\u201cStay with me?\u201dWhen Lyle simply said the first thing that came to mind, it sounded like a confession.\u201c\u2013I mean \u2018behave\u2019 by my side.\u201d\u201cSo I just need to sit there and be by your side?\u201dHow boring.But it was possible if she had a romance novel in her hand.Medea nodded. That\u2019s about it!\u201cHow long?\u201d\u201cHow long\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle didn\u2019t think that Medea would be so calm. And he was thinking of keeping her by his side with an excuse. So he couldn\u2019t clearly state a time.\u201cUntil I feel better\u2026\u2026\u201dMedea started to get upset that there wasn\u2019t an exact duration.Lyle saw Medea frown as he spoke.\u201cHow long exactly is that? Last time, after you slept with me, you definitely felt better and told me to stay here! What should I do to make you feel better?\u201d\u201cIs the Main Palace uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind living in the Main Palace. I care about being restricted from going out and not being allowed to meet other people.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about wanting to meet with the Little Duke again? Why do you want to meet him when you don\u2019t remember anything?\u201dAs soon as she spoke about wanting to meet other people, Lyle\u2019s face reflected his displeasure.Medea couldn\u2019t understand Lyle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why don\u2019t you let me meet him?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t recovered from your memory loss yet because of your last injury. The Empress\u2019s memory loss shouldn\u2019t leak outside.\u201d\u2018I didn\u2019t think of that.\u2019If that was the reason, Lyle was likely to stop Medea from meeting anyone else for a while.\u2018I don\u2019t have the time\u2026\u2026.\u2019\u201cWhy do you want to meet the Little Duke? Is it because you\u2019re curious about your former self?\u201dasked Lyle, studying Medea\u2019s face in thought.Medea raised her head. She had to do something because she was running out of time.\u201cI wanted to try my hand at investing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLyle expected Medea to make excuses, but this was completely unexpected.Lyle looked at Medea in disbelief.\u201cInvesting? Are you saying you want to invest in the Little Duke?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it \u2026\u2026. I don\u2019t know much about that, so I thought I could invest through Luke\u2026\u2026. I wanted to have something like a mine, but I was looking for a place that hasn\u2019t been developed yet. I thought it would be appropriate if it was in the Solare region, so I inquired of the local maid from there\u2026\u2026. Upon hearing the story of a poor lord who is being persecuted by his uncle, I decided I wanted to invest there\u2026\u2026\u201dMedea wondered if Lyle would buy the strange story that would lead to the bizarre investment that would lead to strengthening the area.\u201cSo because you feel sorry for the lord of an estate, you are going to build a mine in his mountainous territory?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s clear that his father was murdered, but there is no evidence\u2026\u2026. They say the family is still under threat. The young lord was said to be previously healthy, now has a mysterious \u2018disease,\u2019 and he has a younger sister and a younger brother. I think I can invest and help in that way\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was a completely absurd explanation. It was true she wanted to make money in case of divorce, but the reason Medea wanted to invest was so embarrassing that she was speechless.\u201c\u2026 If you want a mine, I can buy one for you.\u201d\u201cI want to invest in that estate.\u201dShe might as well have said to Lyle that she wanted to burn the money.It was a more intriguing reason than Lyle could have imagined, but he couldn\u2019t have anticipated Medea sprouting such nonsense.\u201cAre you serious about this? You can\u2019t blindly drill a hole in any mountain and make a mine.\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll have to send someone to investigate the mountain. In the meantime, if I express interest in the estate, it will prevent the uncle from threatening the three siblings.\u201dThis means I couldn\u2019t fulfill my intention to invest quietly, but Ian\u2019s neck was more important now.Medea was on edge.Lyle grinned, seeing Medea\u2019s steadfast will.He wondered what he was worried about and chuckled.\u201cDo you really want to invest there?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLyle swallowed a laugh when he nodded and promised,\u201cIf that is the case\u2026 \u2026 I\u2019ll attach someone to you without having to bring in the Small Duke.\u201dEh.\u201cNo, how could I bother your Majesty? I can just ask Luke \u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cThe Small Duke would still have to send someone out anyway. There\u2019s no way someone who can be an heir of the Duchy would go down there directly.\u201d\u2018I-is that so?\u2019It made sense when she heard it. It was Medea\u2019s personal request, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it poorly, but it\u2019s a small work for a ducal family, and he wouldn\u2019t go to the place that takes 12 days to reach.\u2018Still, I thought Luke would definitely have a crush on Seira and protect her.\u2019It would have been good if they got close. Medea became anxious when he said he was sending someone other than Luke.\u201cWill you protect them?\u201d\u201cYou seem pretty confident that the lord there is in danger.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the situation. It\u2019s suspicious.\u201d\u201cYou can be suspicious in private, but you shouldn\u2019t say that in public. You are the Empress, so you must be wary of being swept away by stories and rumors. Because the words of the Imperial rulers must retain the public\u2019s confidence.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m trapped here anyway, so I can\u2019t meet anyone.\u201dMedea pouted, and Lyle reached out and touched her lips that made a cute expression.Medea was about to shake his hand off but held back.If he was offended, she would be in trouble if things went wrong. Ian\u2019s life depended on it.\u201cYes. I locked the Empress here. My canary\u2026\u2026\u201dSmiling, Lyle looked at Medea with a strange look.Medea looked at him as if she were asking him, \u2018Why are you doing that?\u2019 She stared at him, and as if remembering something, she suddenly blurted out,\u201cRight! Promise me\u2014even if it\u2019s just a vein, it\u2019s my investment.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t take back your promise later.\u201d\u201cYeah.

Today? Tomorrow?\u201d\u201cIs it that urgent?\u201dIt takes 12 days just to get there.When Lyle said he would send someone other than Luke, Medea couldn\u2019t help but fret. Would it be handled with care?Although an order from the Emperor was serious business, Medea doubted if it would matter. Hopefully, that person would be able to deal with the situation properly if and when something happened.\u201cYou never know with people. Please send the order quickly. Yes?\u201dMedea didn\u2019t know if it would work\u2014but encouraged by the reactions from Lyle so far, she decided she would try to act cute and coy.Inwardly, Medea recoiled to the point her hair stood upright, but Lyle\u2019s mouth was loosened into a grin.\u201cWhat should I do\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle\u2019s looked at Medea with a strange smile.The look of desire in his eyes were unabashedly clear, causing Medea\u2019s face to flush.No, why is this human in heat all the time? Is that the only thing you can think about when you see me?\u201cShall I see the Empress in bed tonight and decide?\u201dNo! No way! But if I put it off, isn\u2019t Ian going to die?Medea had a strained smile, holding back the desire to beat Lyle.\u201cYo-your Majesty, what you want to do \u2026 Well, I\u2019ll do anything, so can\u2019t you send it right away?\u201dLyle glanced at Medea to see if it was appealing.\u201cAnything?\u201dWhat are you trying to do?\u201cYes\u2026. Wha-whatever. As long as it doesn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t hurt you.\u201dLyle smirked and kissed Medea on the cheek as if to reassure her. Relieved by the sweet kiss, Medea glanced at Lyle and grabbed his sleeve.Just imagining it makes me cringe\u2026 \u2026 .\u201cYes\u2026\u2026. please. Please send it right now\u2026\u2026\u201dLyle gulped while Medea grabbed his sleeve and looked up at him, beseeching.He was having extraordinary fun teasing her, but if he dragged his feet and the local lord died for no reason, he would have to bear Medea\u2019s resentment. After that, he would be lucky if Medea let him touch her after a month, so Lyle decided to take what he wanted in moderation and win favor.Lyle assumed the local lord was suffering from an illness, not a conspiracy. But if the lord died before Lyle\u2019s people could arrive, then Medea would believe that there was a scheme afoot.In any case, it was the Emperor\u2019s job to take care of the people, and if the young lord died and only his younger siblings were left, it was natural for the Emperor to protect them.Medea was going above and beyond, but it wasn\u2019t bad that she cared about it.Why did he care about such a region? Because of Medea. Of course, while caring about the investment in mines, she wanted to patronize the manor and establish good faith in the land.\u201cOkay, I will send it today. Three or four knights will accompany a healer and a wizard to examine the land. Does this satisfy the Empress\u2019s heart?\u201dMedea\u2019s face widened with a huge smile at Lyle\u2019s words.\u201cYes! Thank you, Your Majesty!\u201d\u201cI hope you\u2019ll be thankful in bed,\u201dLyle whispered, raising the heat in Medea\u2019s face.She was determined to do anything but was nervous about what Lyle would ask of her.\u201cW-well, then let them go first.\u201d\u201cOkay. Instead, when I come back, be ready to be embraced by me.\u201dWasn\u2019t it broad daylight now?But instead, Medea attempted to smile because she didn\u2019t want to delay sending people off.\u201cS-sure.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201dLyle smiled, clasped Medea\u2019s cheek, and enveloped her lips. Medea\u2019s eyes widened with a long, lustful kiss that made her look forward to their approaching time together come.\u201cAhhh \u2026 . *Suck* umn\u2026 \u2026\u201dLyle tore off his lips with a throbbing sound and stared at Medea\u2019s lips with eyes that were still feverish.\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201dLyle strode out of the bedroom.* * *From the time he listened to Medea, Lyle knew right away who to send.Therefore, Lyle took less than 10 minutes to send four knights, one healer, and another wizard to Solare\u2019s estate.Lyle was worried and wetted his dry lips with his tongue and wondered,\u2018Is it okay to use this?\u2019Medea promised to do \u2018anything\u2019. But he could help but think that she would never imagine this.Lyle looked at the red liquid in a large bottle with a face full of troubles. It was an ornate glass bottle rimmed in gold and rubies.Gingerina, it was created and also part of a crappy tradition established by the former Emperor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, absurdly, the Imperial family also adopted the same rules as the Suin tribe.The woman who married the Emperor had to use this aphrodisiac. As if it were a secret tradition that came down from the imperial family, it was even written down on a monument and kept it.As an example, the Emperor used the aphrodisiac whenever he visited a new concubine. The aphrodisiac was also used on the Empresses and Queens as well as the concubines.Lyle despised the former Emperor, so of course, he did not want to use it. By the time she married Medea, he had avoided bedding her, and after he was forced to sleep with her, he was reluctant to use it, in case she would bother him further.I can\u2019t believe it came to mind now\u2026\u2026The aphrodisiac was a strange drug that reacted only to those involved immediately after use. After applying the aphrodisiac to the body and establishing a relationship, even if the drug was not applied afterwards, the same supreme pleasure was experienced even without it.It was difficult to cheat because you cannot taste the same pleasure with anyone other than the person who was imprinted on you with the aphrodisiac, and you would continue to want to sleep with that person.Of course, there was an antidote to this drug. However, it is known only to the Suin who created the aphrodisiac and had not been passed down to the imperial family.The Emperor saw the effect of this aphrodisiac. The Emperor\u2019s concubines never put a man into their bedroom except Lyle to get an heir.\u2018Can I use this?\u2019Medea would never think of divorcing Lyle.Lyle always made the first move; maybe with this, Medea would approach him first instead.Lyle blushed when he felt his lower body got hot and protested against the confines of his clothes just with his imagination.He had never imagined that he would use it and couldn\u2019t believe he wanted to. The reason he didn\u2019t get rid of it and the recipe was that he had completely forgotten about it.He had been in a hurry to seize power and thought to deal with it later. But\u2026\u2026.\u2018Because I only have Medea\u2026\u2026 It would be okay to use it.\u2019And since the two of them didn\u2019t have children yet, Lyle struggled with the excuse that it was good for the imperial family.* * *Lyle returned to his Palace with a bottle of aphrodisiac. He told the court officials that no one should come in, locked all the doors to his personal quarters, and entered the bedroom where Medea was waiting.Perhaps because she was told to wait in bed, all the curtains on the bed were undone. Seeing her do something so cute, Lyle approached the bed, his heart pounding.\u201cOh, Your Majesty\u2026\u2026.\u201dSitting in the middle of the bed, Medea\u2019s cheeks were hot as she looked embarrassedly at Lyle.Lyle couldn\u2019t breathe at that lewd appearance.When did you prepare such clothes\u2026\u2026A chain of gold passed over her chest and waist, and the white transparent cloth attached to the chain narrowly covered her breasts and lower folds.Gulp.Lyle swallowed his saliva and strode up to the bed. He put down the bottle of aphrodisiac on the side of the bed and quickly took off his clothes.\u2018What is that?\u2019Medea glanced at the bottle that Lyle had brought. Raspberry red liquid. What was that? It seems like there was such a thing in the novel\u2026\u2026Hiccup.Medea recalled Lyle\u2019s first night with Seira and the aphrodisiac that Lyle had used. Medea looked at Lyle with a perplexed look\u201cUh, I\u2026. Y-your Majesty\u2026 \u2026 . What is that?\u201dLyle blushed as Medea stuttered and pointed to the aphrodisiac at the corner of the bed. He brought it with the intention to use it on Medea but still felt ashamed.\u201cIt\u2026 An i-imperial tradition. I should have used it on your first night, but\u2026 \u2026 At the time, you were too young to use it.\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019d do anything if I sent trustworthy people to Solare right now? I want to use this to embrace you.\u201dHaving read the novel, Medea remembered the aphrodisiac. She thought it had a ridiculous effect\u2026\u2026.\u2018It was described as \u201csupreme pleasure.\u201d Would it really feel that good?\u2019It\u2019s always felt good to be held by Lyle, but it said it was more than pleasure\u2026\u2026. she was wondering what it would be like.\u2018No. The genre of this novel is changing. What I read was definitely romance, but it seems like it\u2019s becoming an R-rated romance for 18-year-olds and above\u2026\u2026. Wait, this isn\u2019t going to suddenly change the Emperor into a Yandere or led to confinement, is it?\u2019 [t1v: I swear\u2026. foreshadowing \u2014 or actually registering your current reality? like a mofo]Already she was imprisoned at the Emperor\u2019s residence.Medea looked at a Lyle, conflicted, who was waiting for an answer.Should I refuse? Could he take back the knights? There was a wizard in the group, so he could always give orders through the crystal ball.\u2018I-I\u2019m sure it will be okay\u2026 it\u2019s also used on Lyle so\u2026\u2026.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a drink but an aphrodisiac that was applied to the body. Inevitably, the medicinal effects would also rub into Lyle\u2019s body, and Lyle will not be able to taste the same pleasure with women other than Medea.\u201c\u2026 Should I use a little?\u201d\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201dMedea\u2019s permission struck Lyle\u2019s mouth with laughter.Medea glanced at Lyle with a red-tinted face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After using it, it allows only those involved to taste the ultimate pleasure repeatedly instead of it being only a rare occurrence.\u201dLyle opened the lid of the bottle. It looked like a fairly large bottle, roughly 500ml. A sweet and fragrant scent came out.\u201cCome here. Open your mouth first.\u201dWhen Medea came in front of Lyle and sat down, Lyle put his finger in the bottle.A honey-like viscous liquid flowed along Lyle\u2019s fingers.Lyle spread it over Medea\u2019s lips, put his finger into Medea\u2019s mouth, touching her tongue and the inside of her mouth.\u201cUnnh\u2026 . Oh\u2026 \u2026.\u201dA sigh flowed out of her tongue as if she was kissing. Lyle swallowed, his mouth dry, and laid Medea down on the bed.The thin pieces of transparent cloth hung from the left and right of Medea\u2019s chest, drawing rich folds that obscured the view of the peaks of her breasts. Lyle poured the aphrodisiac over it. A lukewarm, sticky liquid poured out.Lyle spread her legs wide, applying a generous amount of aphrodisiac to Medea\u2019s breasts. Stretching back and forth, the fabric titled side to side revealing Medea\u2019s secrets completely.\u201cOh!\u2026 my god.\u201dA finger drenched with aphrodisiac penetrated into her entrance, soaking the soft flesh inside. Lyle applied plenty of aphrodisiac to Medea petals and mixed them with her flower wine to ready her for his tower that would fill her up.\u201cAhhhhhh, Oh\u2026\u2026 Ahhh\u2026 \u2026\u201dHe could help but find it regrettable that his finger couldn\u2019t reach deeper. Lyle kept pushing in his wet finger, rubbing her insides and applying plenty of aphrodisiac, but it was a pity that he couldn\u2019t apply it to the deeper part of Medea.Fretting, Lyle finally poured the liquid on his penis. He took his penis dripping with a dripping red, raspberry-colored liquid to Medea\u2019s hold and pushed it all the way to his roots all at once.\u201cAAAHHHhhh!\u201dThere was a shock from spinning with pleasure. Lyle pulled out his penis as if that wasn\u2019t enough and then again applied a lot of aphrodisiac.\u201c*Gasp?* *Gasp!*\u201dLyle\u2019s penis struck deep into her core again. Lyle shook his member from side to side, regretting that he couldn\u2019t go deeper, and then turned Medea\u2019s body upside down.\u2018It goes deeper in this position.\u2019\u2018Ahhh\u2026 \u2026 . sire\u2026 \u2026 . Yes\u2026 Ohh\u2026\u201dLyle lifted up Medea\u2019s quaking waist, pushed his soaked fingers in, and again spilled all the remaining liquid on his erect organ. Then he took the tip of the red liquid dripping into the wet mouth and pistoned it to the deepest depths.\u201cHhhhaaaaa Ah, ah!\u201dShaking at the sweet stimulus, Medea bounced off a puddle. Lyle was gasping for breath with his member deeply inserted inside of Medea.The effect of which was not seen if the medicine was washed off before its color changed. If you neglect the color change and start to touch it, the person who applied the aphrodisiac would experience the same effect.The former emperor strictly adhered to this usage, but Lyle had no intention of doing so. In Lyle\u2019s life, one woman, Medea, was enough for him.\u201cHaa\u2026 . Ahhh, Ohh\u2026 \u2026 .\u201dMedea, lying on her bed, felt relieved when Lyle didn\u2019t move. She just lay down blankly, gasping for breath.\u2018Didn\u2019t it say that the color becomes transparent when the aphrodisiac is absorbed?\u2018Haaa oooh \u2026 . Ahhhhh\u2026 Ah\u2026 .\u201dThe red liquid soaking in Medea\u2019s secret slowly became transparent, and Lyle suddenly wanted to see what face Medea was making.But he hesitated for a moment because he didn\u2019t want to remove himself from inside her.\u201cHnghh! Ahhh Epp! huh aaaaah!\u201dHe laid her ass to the side, bent one of Medea\u2019s legs, and then turned her on her back while still inside of her.Flames flew into Medea\u2019s eyes as his penis rotated and pulsed against her inner wall. Liquid splattered. Medea, who had reached heights, twitched and kept trembling in a limp state.The stimulus felt by them was excessive\u2014 letting them taste the ultimate pleasure \u2013it was too high.Lyle felt similarly, and his face was burning red.\u201cMillie\u2026 Medea.\u201dHis voice mixed with a hot sigh was sent a chilling thrill down Medea\u2019s neck. Medea knew what that signaled when Lyle sang her name in that voice.\u201cNo, Your Majesty\u2026 \u2026 . N-not now. I felt it so\u2026 \u2026 . Wait! Ugnnnh, Sire\u2026 \u2026 !\u201dWhether the frightened Medea struggled or not, Lyle held her two legs on his shoulders and held the position about to insert his pillar.His lower body was melting in pleasure, so he couldn\u2019t hold it anymore.\u201cMedea\u2026. Millie. I\u2019m sorry I\u2026\u2026. I can\u2019t take it anymore\u2026\u2026. Kohh!\u201d\u201cUhhhh!\u201dHe started to stab her with his member as if Lyle was beaten with the fervor of belief.Flames sparkled in front of Medea\u2019s eyes when his already large penis raced towards climaxes without hesitation using the aphrodisiac as a lubricant.\u201cAgh! Uhangh\u2026 \u2026 . Ah, ah\u2026 \u2026!\u201dLyle didn\u2019t insert it more than a few times, but they seemed to be reaching their peak. He quickly noticed that their wet flesh was constricting and sending a signal.\u201cOhhh, yeah! Ahhh\u2026\u2026 !\u201dThe light constantly flickered in his eyes, and Lyle\u2019s whole body shuddered and kept quivering. Medea curled like a bow, unable to withstand a few minutes after their loins began mixing.\u201cHek! Ohhhh, ahhhh\u2026\u2026 !\u201dLyle ejaculated while Medea climaxed while screaming at her peak. Because they had peaked much earlier than usual, his size did not decrease at all.Instead, Lyle, who was drunk on pleasure, pushed into Medea\u2019s core even harder.\u201cHunnn Oh!\u2026 . Ahhak *gasp*\u2026 \u2026 .Ahhhhhhhhhh\u2026 \u2026 !\u201dSaliva flowed down my cheeks, and my body shook violently up and down, but I couldn\u2019t wake up.

If she continued to taste this pleasure, she would be a slave to lust and not wake up\u2013 falling into carnal desires.Rather than getting what she wants and using her body as bait like today, she will live a life struggling with pleasure while Lyle wielded her as he likes\u2026 \u2026 .\u2018Uh? I think that sounds good too\u2026 \u2026 . Oh, no! Wake up! Medea!\u2019Medea shook her head violently, trying to resume reason that would soon collapse in pleasure.Then she looked at Lyle, thumping into her ass.\u201cHick, ah, ah\u2026 \u2026 . Please, Your Majesty\u2026 \u2026 . Stop, ah, ah\u2026 \u2026 . Ah\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cStop, What? \u2026 \u2026 Why?\u201dMedea was distracted when Lyle, who had slowed his back for a moment, inquired.What am I saying? Stop because it feels so good for you to put it me?Medea appealed to Lyle, with her face dyed red.\u201cAhhh\u2026. Now, the stimulation is too big\u2026 \u2026 Sire, I think I will die. so\u2026 \u2026 Stop in this state\u2026 \u2026 . Later, after using the antidote\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cCute Millie\u2026 \u2026 . There is no such thing as an antidote.\u201dLyle said to Medea, with a beautiful face full of obscene laughter.The absence of an antidote was not shown in the novel, so Medea was puzzled.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThis medicine is made by the Suin tribe who live across the eastern continent. It was difficult just to get it, so I couldn\u2019t have found a way to make the antidote.\u201dMedea was lost in thought after Lyle\u2019s whispers.\u201cMy lovely Millie \u2026. Do you know how you look when you feel it?\u201dWhispering softly, Lyle grasped her breasts covered in aphrodisiac that had now become transparent.Medea was embarrassed because that touch alone twisted her whole body with desire.\u201cI know that you are feeling it, that you are holding on to me and enjoying it. I will never let go\u2026 \u2026\u201dWhispering, Lyle began to move his waist.Medea was dizzy with the torrent of pleasure that swarmed her.Oh, no\u2026\u2026 !* * *\u201cAhhhh, Ugnnhh!\u2026 \u2026 . Ahah\u2026 \u2026 . sire\u2026 \u2026\u201dThe woman, trapped between his strong arms, trembled. As if she couldn\u2019t stand it, Medea wiggled, bursting out with sweet sighs.\u201cPlease\u2026 \u2026 . stop\u2026 \u2026 . Stop, please\u2026 \u2026 . Yes, oh yes!\u2026 \u2026 . Oh I\u2019m going crazy\u2026 \u2026 . Ahhhh!\u201dLyle, who was massaging and licking Medea\u2019s breasts, moved his penis into her again and melted Medea\u2019s reason.Medea orgasmed over and over again, slumping in Lyle\u2019s arms.When the aphrodisiac effect was thoroughly exerted, the feeling of insertion alone was about to make her climax.In the meantime, Medea couldn\u2019t come to her senses as he filled her up and stimulated her.She cried and tasted the climax dozens of times, but Lyle did not let Medea go. It was also difficult to stay alert because the aphrodisiac was faithfully exerted.\u201cHaaa\u2026 . Millie\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026. Hugnhh\u2026 \u2026 . I don\u2019t want it anymore\u2026 \u2026. There, uh\u2026\u2026 melting, Ahhhh!\u201dMedea struggled, not knowing what she was saying.Lyle pulled the ankle of Medea, trying to run away, pistoning into her. He couldn\u2019t stand it; Medea was cute and intolerable, who whimpered every time he filled her up and moved his back.\u201cI would have punished you if you were whining\u2026 \u2026\u201dWhispering, Lyle grabbed Medea\u2019s wrist and pressed her onto the bed.As he pressed her gasping lips with his lips and sucked on her softly, Medea cooed with pleasure even in the middle of wailing.\u2018What a cutie.\u2019When Lyle moved his waist, she struggled again, but even that movement was becoming her pleasure.\u201cAh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Your Majesty, again\u2026 \u2026 . Ah\u2026 \u2026 . I can\u2019t stand it\u2026 \u2026 . Ugh, Your Majesty\u2026 \u2026 !\u201d\u201cNot yet, no. Ha\u2026 \u2026 .

All day long, I\u2019ll be putting it in\u2026 \u2026 \u201cLyle warned, pushing in his penis hard.Lyle continued to covet Medea with the excuse that he wouldn\u2019t do it all day if she didn\u2019t reach her limit before he allowed it.Medea cried and sobbed as she was immersed in pleasure and unable to think rationally.\u201cNo, no\u2026 \u2026 . Ahhh! Ohhhh! It feels so good\u2026 \u2026 . I feel so good! Aaahhhh\u2026 \u2026 . More\u2026 \u2026 !\u201dThe body, suffering from sweet pleasure, reached its climax shortly. Lyle ecstatic, thrilled by her shrinking wet flesh, and pushed Medea into greater ecstasy.\u201cAhhhh, Haaa, ah\u2026 \u2026 ! Sire\u2026 \u2026 .

With the maids-in-waiting help, she wore a conservative dress that tightly wrapped around her neck and even gestured as if to tell him to go away.For Lyle, who was already under the aphrodisiac effect, he was going crazy but did nothing.\u2018I\u2019m sure the medicine worked?\u2019Did I see wrong? Last night, under Lyle, Medea had been entirely excited and had at least four times lost her mind.How lovely it was to see her crying, drunk off sweet ecstasy, hanging from his neck. Lyle could get off for five hours just thinking of the scene.\u201cWhat nonsense! Millie, won\u2019t you come here right now?\u201dAs Lyle snarled, he strode toward Medea, who turned red. Medea shouted not to go when her maids quickly evacuated.\u201cNo! Everyone out! I must be alone with the Empress!\u201dIt was evident to whom the attendants gave priority when it came to the Emperor\u2019s command.Medea stamped her feet after her maids politely bowed their heads and rushed away. In the meantime, Lyle snatched Medea\u2019s waist as she was about to run out the door, trying to run away.\u201cEkkk!\u201d\u201cEkkk?\u201dPrayers were not answered.Lyle whispered sullenly, holding his lips to Medea\u2019s ear.\u201cDid you forget to thank me for making you feel good even amongst all your fussing last night?\u201d\u201cM-my memory\u2014well\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cHa-Oh\u2014\u201dLyle smirked as he looked at Medea, trembling like a rabbit caught by a lion.The last attendant was already pulling out and shutting the bedroom door quietly.\u201cIf not, I can recreate everything that happened between us\u2014step by step. So we can refresh our memory together.\u201d\u201cOh, Ahhhh! No! I-I remember!\u201dMedea shouted in fright at Lyle\u2019s immediate attempts to take her clothes off.The aphrodisiac effect is so substantial that his desire for Medea was more robust than before, and it was difficult to control it.\u201c\u2026 .\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Your Majesty?\u201dLyle was just staring at her with blazing eyes without answering.Unnerved, when Medea called Lyle carefully and Lyle let her go with a disgusted expression.\u201cWhy are you avoiding me?\u201d\u201cB\u2026 Because of that weakness, I\u2019ll feel weird just by your Majesty touching my cheek\u2026 \u2026 . I\u2019m afraid I will make a questionable sound.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLyle was aware that he used a large dose on her. Additionally, it was said that the aphrodisiac works stronger on women than on men, so the pleasure Medea feels would be at a level that is difficult to describe.\u201cOkay\u2026.. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if I could obstruct it appropriately?\u201d\u201cHow?\u201dWhen Medea asked, as if she really didn\u2019t know, Lyle shamelessly faced her.\u201cWith a kiss.\u201d\u201cUh? No, what will people say if you do that in public?\u201d\u201cThey would say that the Emperor favors my wife, the Empress?\u201dLyle bluntly said, as if he was cutting off her concerns. But Medea was adamant:\u201cI hate it because I\u2019m embarrassed! There is also a separate joining day, so why\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cYou only kiss me on union day?\u201dLyle questioned his ears. He used the aphrodisiac because he wanted to be closer to Medea, but it seemed that only the opposite effect occurred.\u201cIf you\u2019re confident, you can stop with a kiss\u2026.\u201dOf course, Lyle didn\u2019t have enough confidence to stop at just kissing.Lyle was speechless and stuttered for a moment.\u201cT-that\u2019s that\u2019s true, but\u2026 \u2026 . not necessarily a union day\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThey say that you can\u2019t conceive a child if you do it too much. So, from now on, let\u2019s only do it on union day.

Don\u2019t you think we should increase it?\u201dLyle pressed him with a lively look at the doctor. The doctor nodded, sweating profusely.\u201cWell, eh, I think so. You\u2019re right\u2026\u2026.\u201dIn fact, when the first date of union day was set, the doctor decided to do it three days in a row. According to Medea\u2019s menstruation cycle, they had been encouraged to have a relationship for three consecutive days in time for a possible pregnancy.In Medea\u2019s previous life, she had learned how to calculate ovulation in a sex education class.Usually, you need to be involved 3-4 days before and after ovulation; thus, it was more likely to get pregnant\u2026\u2026.\u2018If you tell that to Lyle now, I won\u2019t be out of the bedroom for eight days every month! You\u2019re going to die!There was a lot of lack of medicine in this world. It was because science and medicine were relatively less developed, and most depended on magic or healing.Medea didn\u2019t have accurate knowledge about ovulation. It was also ridiculous to mandate she had to have a relationship every two weeks.\u201cWell, then, as we decided for the first time, three days every 11 days\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dSimultaneously, similar oppositional words broke out from the mouths of Lyle and Medea for different reasons. Lyle felt it too little, and Medea thought it too much.The doctor caught in between gulped, his mouth dry, and pulled at the collar of his shirt as the Empire\u2019s two most powerful people glared at him as if to strangle him.\u201cShouldn\u2019t it happen at least one day, day after day?\u201dMedea shook her head firmly as Lyle took his chance.\u201cNo, Your Majesty! We don\u2019t know if I am pregnant or not since the last day of our merger, so I should be careful in advance. Doctor, how many weeks before we know if I\u2019m pregnant?\u201dSuddenly, the doctor, who was asked a question, hurriedly answered, pulling down a handkerchief that had been wiping cold sweat.\u201cIt depends on the body and constitution, but usually it is three weeks\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDid you hear, Your Majesty? So we can\u2019t do it for three weeks\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThree weeks? Is the Empress trying to hang me dry and kill me?\u201dsaid Lyle with a straight face; mentally, Medea clicked her tongue.She didn\u2019t think she could really postpone it for three weeks because she had a menstrual cycle. Since she hadn\u2019t had her period since coming to this world, she would be able to tell whether she is pregnant or not within a week or two.\u201cEmpress, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re being too arrogant with my favor?\u201dAs he gritted his teeth, Medea glanced at Lyle.Despite his threats, even when he hated touching Medea and he didn\u2019t harm her. She would never be afraid of such a bluff, but\u2026\u2026. I thought it would be a little disappointing to lose my favor [t1v: aka she like the D].\u201cY-Your Majesty, you first imprisoned me and then used a strange drug! Get me the antidote! Then I\u2019ll be in your arms every day!\u201dWhen Medea shouted with her cheeks dyed red, Lyle looked at her with an impatient face.\u201cI said there was no antidote! Besides, I punished the Empress for being rude to me first! What do you mean imprisonment!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t let me send letters or receive them, but try and drag me into bed every day! What is it, if it\u2019s not confinement?\u201d\u201cWho during probation ever receives letters? Aren\u2019t you too arrogant to be an Empress?\u201dAs the voice of the Emperor and Empress increased, the maid of honor and servant did not dare to intervene, only looking at the two masters.In addition, the crouching doctor opened his mouth with a look that he wanted to run out of the room right away.\u201cThe\u2026\u2026t-the two \u2014or two of you seem busy, so I\u2019ll leave you alone. His Majesty the Emperor and Her Majesty the Empress\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs the doctor spoke in a hoarse voice, Lyle\u2019s frosty eyes turned to him.\u201cSay here now, doctor. Is there a child in the Empress\u2019s womb?\u201d\u201cT-that\u2019s\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know at this moment\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs Lyle\u2019s body was fuming, the doctor hurriedly changed his words. If his tongue made the wrong move, his neck might have to pay for it.\u201cI don\u2019t see any energy at the moment.\u201d\u201cHow many days a month is it right to be involved?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty! Sire\u2014 You are cowardly! You\u2019re intimidating him right now!\u201dMedea protested, but Lyle pretended not to hear her and instead held the doctor\u2019s eyes with a frosty glare. The doctor, who was trembling with a blue face, said,\u201cIt\u2019s right to be as involved as possible! Your Majesty and Her Majesty are both in good health! You can do it everyday\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cEmpress, did you hear him?\u201dMedea jumped up and down.\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t say that when your Majesty is so frightening!\u201d\u201cDoctor.\u201dLyle\u2019s cool voice made his shoulders jump.\u201cYes, my Emperor.\u201dLyle, who had a soft smile and a fierce glare on his face, looked down at the doctor.\u201cDid I scare you?\u201d\u201cOh, ah\u2014 no, no! Scared? Me! The grandeur of the Emperor dazes my eyes! Your Majesty never threatened me! Yes, sire!\u201dAt the doctor\u2019s desperate cry, Lyle looked back at Medea with a triumphant look.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201cWhat do you mean \u201cyes\u201d? Your eyes were so scary. No matter how hard you try, there will be no union\u2014just so you know!\u201dLyle got up from his seat with a perplexed look on his face as Medea left the parlor in a fit of anger.\u201cEmpress!\u201dLyle chased Medea out of the drawing-room, and the room became quiet. The doctor slumped and sat on the floor without a pulse.\u201cCounselor, may I serve you a cup of tea?\u201dWhen the maid-in-waiting carefully asked, the doctor nodded.\u201cGive me cold water. His Majesty\u2026 I think it was just yesterday that he was yelling at me to cut back on the days of the merging.\u2026. How much things have changed\u2026.\u201dEveryone agreed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing Medea stamping her feet at the door of his residence, Lyle was so relieved that he had forgotten why he was upset.\u201cMillie.\u201dAs he approached, calling her name, Medea glanced at Lyle and turned around as if she didn\u2019t want to see him.\u201cMedea.\u201dSinging her name softly and soothingly, Lyle approached Medea.Even though the Emperor called her first, Medea had the gall to pretend not to hear him. But for Lyle, she just looked cute.\u201cI, the Emperor, am trying to favor you, the Empress. Is that too frustrating?\u201dAs he approached closely and whispered, Medea flinched back.\u201cGee, it\u2019s because you\u2019re going too far!\u201d\u201cToo far? What do you mean?\u201dWhen he asked with a smile, Medea realized that Lyle was trying to tease her again and glared at Lyle with a hot face.\u201cUh huh\u2014What\u2019s with that look? Do you dare glare at the Emperor?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty sometimes glares.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the Emperor. Do you dare tell the Emperor not to stare? \u201cAs Lyle approached, Medea took two steps back.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think so, but\u2026\u2026. Well, yeah! I was staring at you! So what are you going to do\u2026\u2026huuhhhh?\u201dLyle, who strode up to Medea, quickly stole a kiss from her lips. Her body trembled with an indescribable soft-touch heightened by the aphrodisiac in her system.\u201cWhoa, uh\u2026. Ahhhgnnhh\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI will punish you like this. Every time\u2026.\u201dWhispering, forehead to forehead, Lyle caressed Medea\u2019s face, cupping her cheeks in both of his hands. Her red face clouded with pleasure and a quickened, heavy breath leaked out to the tip of her nose.\u201cHuh, um\u2026. Ugh\u2026.\u201d\u201cHow dare you raise your voice to the Emperor?\u2026 if I don\u2019t punish these fine lips, well\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe maids and servants, who quietly followed the Emperor and Empress, quickly fled without making a sound. Of course, a member of the Imperial Palace\u2019s legislator also bowed on his way out.The guard, who was looking around, quietly closed the door at the Emperor\u2019s residence entrance. Lyle, who glanced at Medea\u2019s lips, deeply smiled internally.\u201cOh, no\u2026 There are people\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea looked around, embarrassed by Lyle\u2019s touching her breast over her dress. Before she knew it, I was surprised that the door of the residence was closed and absent of any maid or servant.\u201cAre you all so absorbed that you don\u2019t even know that they left? Did my kiss make you feel that good?\u201d\u201cOh, Your Majesty\u2026\u2026.\u201dHer body reacted steadily and passionately even though it was being touched over her clothes. Feeling her nipples harden to pronounced protrusions, Medea turned around, covered her chest with both arms.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026. Stop\u2026.\u201d\u2026. No.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dSmiling, Lyle approached Medea, who was stained red. Medea who hid her chest with both arms as if she were wary, slowly stepped back.\u201cI will not let you go if your cute place is wet.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t let me go?\u201dMedea, who knew that the place was already wet just by kissing, asked with a nervous face.Lyle looked at Medea suspiciously and said.\u201cWell\u2026\u2026 shall I punish you?\u201dMedea felt her mouth go dry at Lyle\u2019s smile. It was obvious without asking what the punishment would be.Medea pressed her skirt reflexively.\u201c\u2026\u2026so to check I\u2019d have lift your skirt to see the Empress\u2019s cute place.\u201dNow lewd words were coming very naturally to Lyle. Medea grabbed the hem of her skirt, nervous.\u201cMillie\u2026. If you try to run away again, do you really ride me and have your insides clasp my mine under you all day long?\u201dAt Lyle\u2019s words, Medea turned red even all the way to her ears. Even if no one is around, what are you talking about?!\u201cW-w-what was that?! What are you talking about?\u201dLyle burst into laughter at the hostile glare Medea shot him.As Medea turned around in surprise at Lyle\u2019s approaching figure, Lyle quickly snatched Miledia\u2019s waist.\u201cHiccup! Sire!\u201d\u201cYou think you can just run away? My cute Empress.\u201dLyle giggled, whispering dreamily into Medea\u2019s ears. Medea shook her head desperately. Lyle was an insane person to insert all day.\u201cOh, no! Never!\u201cHmmm, I think I just saw the Empress turn her back on me?\u201dSpeaking, Lyle swept his hands over Medea\u2019s dress and touched her ass lightly. Medea struggled, swallowing her panting breaths. If he saw her wet underwear, it would be over.\u201cW-well you know what?\u2026. Hiccup!\u201dSuddenly, Medea was surprised by Lyle grabbing her ass. Lyle spoke while squeezing and rubbing Medea\u2019s butt.\u201cI have to check your skirt, so stay quiet.\u201d\u201cWhat? Now, wait!\u201dMedea\u2019s urgent gaze was directed toward the window, which was still open. It was broad daylight, so the curtains were naturally pulled back in the window.\u201cCurt-curtains first!\u201d\u201cCurtain?\u201dLyle\u2019s eyes turned to the window with bright sunlight.\u2018Well, it wouldn\u2019t be good if anyone peeked.\u2019\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll listen.\u201dLyle kissed Medea on her forehead and released her waist. Then he went to the window himself and started to draw the curtains. It was the Emperor\u2019s residence, so it was a room with many windows, so it seemed that it would take a long time to close the curtains.\u2018Whew\u2026 I finally did it\u2026\u2026.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She could just barely maintain her reason by such a narrow margin, so she wanted to avoid having anything to do with Lyle as much as possible.\u2018No matter how great it is described in a novel, does it make sense for it to feel so good?\u201dShe didn\u2019t think Lyle would betray her, but it would be the smart thing to be on guard and keep an eye on him. Medea had no intention of falling in love with Lyle until she later called Seira to confront Lyle.\u2018Even if we do it right now, I think it\u2019s going to last all night\u2026\u2026. Wouldn\u2019t it be better for me to reduce the number of times?\u2019The only answer was to take refuge in a nearby room.Medea sneaked around Lyle as he pulled the curtains on other windows.\u201cMillie!\u201dShe could hear Lyle\u2019s angry voice, but she entered the room coldly and locked the door. Outside the door, Lyle knocked on the door.\u201cMedea! Aren\u2019t you going to open this?\u201d\u201cN-no! You\u2019re going to touch me as you want!\u201d\u201cYou can touch it, too! You like to touch my body!\u201dMedea was embarrassed and confused when something unexpected was pointed out.\u201cWh-when, do I!\u201d\u201cI realized you do when you stared at my naked body. Did you think I wouldn\u2019t know if you sneaked in a touch while I was sleeping?\u201dMomentarily sheepish, Medea turned red to the tip of her nose. And then turned furious and yelled at Lyle outside the door.\u201cYour Majesty\u2019s touch is not invited because he is not so delicate!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you run away because you are wet?\u201d\u201cN-no, it\u2019s not?\u201d\u201cNo? Wouldn\u2019t it be better not to tell a lie that I\u2019ll find out soon?\u201dHehe. The door is locked. How are you going to check it?\u201cIt\u2019s just your Majesty\u2019s delusion!\u201d\u201cHooo \u2013 I\u2019m delusional. Can you take responsibility for that?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dMedea looked triumphantly at the closed door. Lyle, standing outside the door, narrowed his eyes.\u201cAll right, Medea. Stay away from the door because you could get hurt.\u201d\u201cWhat? N-now, wait!\u201dMedea, who was about to approach the door to stop Lyle, on second thought withdrew, reckoning that she could not risk her life on such a thing.Outside the door, I could hear the sound of a sword being pulled out, and the door was neatly carved and fell to the floor.Ugh. Hugh!Lyle leisurely slipped his sword into its sheath, watching Medea staring at him with a blank face, utterly stupefied. Then he smiled wickedly handsome.\u201cAlright, my beloved Empress. How are you going to take responsibility now?\u201d\u201cUh- We-well, it\u2019s wet\u2014 but! I\u2019m embarrassed, so please don\u2019t roll up my skirt\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle, who was looking at Medea with a playful look, smiled as she confessed in a stammering voice.\u201cI see, but what wouldn\u2019t you say if I didn\u2019t check you at night?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe nodded his head as if he could not see Medea, who had hesitated with her ears dyed red.Actually, he wanted to embrace Medea and go straight to the bedroom but was holding back. She was the Empress, and the woman he loved, so he wanted to let her have her own way as much as he could.\u201cWell, I have a condition, too! You can do it, but you have to do it just once.\u201dLyle\u2019s smirk on his face as he looked at Medea hardened.\u201cUh\u2026\u2026. What?\u201d\u201cI feel it a lot, so I\u2019ll use your Majesty\u2019s standard instead. Let\u2019s do it once by ejaculation.\u201d\u201cCome on, wait, Millie! We can only do it once? Such a rule\u2026.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty may have good stamina because he is a warrior, but I am not. It\u2019s too much to accept you every day to your satisfaction. Please take care of my body\u2019s condition.\u201dLyle also had nothing to say when Medea openly apologized. Lyle also had an inkling that he was swept up in embracing Medea and pushed her beyond her physical strength whenever they slept together.\u201cWell, one time is too little. At least five or six times\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOne.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll compromise a lot\u2014how about four times\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThen 0.5 times.\u201d\u201cWhat? What\u2019s 0.5?\u201dWhen Lyle flusteredly implored, Medea confidently explained,\u201cIt\u2019s not when your Majesty reaches release, it\u2019s that you quit as soon as I\u2019m at the peak.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026do you know how many times you reach orgasm when you play with me?\u201d\u201cA lot?\u201d\u201cMillie, please.

Earlier in the day, he wished he had dragged her into the bedroom and had an early night. But he had to return to the Emperor\u2019s office without even raising his hand because he had promised to complete a couple of tasks.\u2018There was no helping it.\u2019Lyle stopped by another room to take a bath and groomed himself before going into the house with sneaky thoughts. As he entered the residence wearing a loose robe, Medea, who was sitting on the sofa, got up in a hurry. She was also dressed in a simple dress without a corset.She wanted Lyle to take her right away, so as soon as she met Lyle\u2019s eyes, Medea\u2019s face turned red.\u201c\u2026\u2026leave.\u201dWhen she spoke to the maids, they quietly left the Emperor\u2019s quarters.Click.The sound was clear even though the door was closing quietly because both of them were silent.Lyle drew the hem of his gown and approached Medea.\u201cMillie, come here.\u201dAs he spoke with his arms spread out, Medea\u2019s head was lowered down half-shamefully and took a step away.

Her reaction quickly came as he held her fragrant lips.\u201cHuhunn\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea knew the joy of hugging Lyle, so a shallow groan flowed out. Lyle was going to enjoy the foreplay for as long as possible because he knew he could only do it once in the worst-case scenario.\u201cHmm\u2026. Uh-huh\u2026.\u2026.\u201dHe sucked her soft lips and intertwined her sweet tongue with his. When he grabbed Medea\u2019s breasts over her dress, a gasp leaked out as her lips were soaked in spit.When Lyle grazed and pinched the area where her nipples would be over her clothes, Medea twisted her body away, overwhelmed. The thought of Medea being so sensitive only under his touch, no one else, made Lyle excited with a deep satisfaction.\u201cHaaa\u2026.\u201dMedea looked a little embarrassed when he pulled her dress down in a hurry. Since he could only do it once, she thought he would do it in the bedroom.\u201cOhh.\u201dHer breasts, not restricted by a corset, popped out the front of the hem as her dress was pulled down. Lyle couldn\u2019t control his fervor and buried his face between them. As he teased her erect nipples with his tongue while enjoying the soft skin, a sensitive sound leaked out of Medea\u2019s mouth.\u201cUgh\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle laughed as he remembered that he had put a lot of medicine on Medea\u2019s chest.He grasped her breasts, rubbing them, her nipples stiff and jiggling in both of his hands.\u201cHuuhh, aahhhhh\u2026.\u201dMedea looked at Lyle with an impatient face, already ready.You can\u2019t do that.Lyle smiled at her grumpy look and sucked her nipples.\u201cHAaa!

Lyle pretended not to know, preoccupied with clenching Medea\u2019s thin waist and coveting the softness of her breasts.Medea trembled when she felt the tip of his tongue soaked in saliva tickling her nipples.\u201cOooh, Ohh\u2026 Haaaa\u2026 Sire\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Millie?\u201dMedea was at a loss what to say with her neat face dyed red.

Lyle pulled down the hem of her dress further, curious how excited she was. The garment hanging around her chest came down to her waist and stopped, so he tore it apart.\u2018Ah.\u2019The torn dress fell to Medea\u2019s feet. At Lyle\u2019s attempt to pull down her petticoat, Medea backed away in fright.

Lyle\u2019s eyes had already seen her exposed to lewd wet panties.Lyle grinned and untied the thong\u2019s bows on Medea\u2019s thighs.\u201cThat\u2019s why you didn\u2019t want me to take it off. Oh, yeah, umm \u2013 Millie? Did you feel so good that I touched you? You\u2019re soaking wet.\u201dMedea shook her head, trembling like a rabbit in front of a lion.\u201cOh, no\u2026\u2026. Ohhh\u2026!\u201dA sweet shudder ran down her spine as he flicked her nipples soaked in saliva with his fingertips.Lyle clutched Medea\u2019s waist as she tried to escape from shame and untied the rest of the string. She tried to clasp her thighs together, but when Lyle untied her strap and pulled on her panties, the damp cloth easily escaped between her legs.\u201cWould you run away even with evidence like this? I didn\u2019t even touch you here\u2026I can\u2019t believe how wet you are.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s because your Majesty used a strange aphrodisiac \u2026\u2026that\u2014that\u2019s what it is!\u201d\u201cHuh? Even so\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle\u2019s hands entered between her clasped thighs. Medea was shy and gave strength to her thighs, but she couldn\u2019t beat Lyle\u2019s strength.\u201cIsn\u2019t it correct to assume the Empress enjoyed it?\u201d\u201cHiccup, ah \u2026Not there\u2026\u2026. Ahhgnnn!The tips of Lyle\u2019s fingers stroked her soft petals as a shivering joy bloomed. Medea shook her head in fright. If he touched her place like this\u2026.!\u201cHhnnggghhhhh.\u2026. Oohh, Your Majesty! Aang\u2026\u2026.\u201dOne of Lyle\u2019s arms held Medea\u2019s waist, and the other was curled in between her legs. He was delighted to feel that Medea was losing her strength little by little and not knowing what to do.\u201cCutie, spread your legs so I can make you happier. Hmm? My Medea\u2026\u2026.\u201dThrilled by his sexy whispering voice in her ear, trembling, Medea was in tears. In this condition, she would climax soon.\u201cOh, my lord\u2026\u2026. Sire th- that\u2019s enough\u2026\u2026put it in\u2026.\u201dHe could see her willingness to do it quickly and finish it, but Lyle only flashed a smile wickedly.\u201cYou must be wet enough so that you won\u2019t suffer. I can only insert and reach it once\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll give it to you when it\u2019s easier to enter.\u201d***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Your Majesty, Hhhuuh!\u201dLyle\u2019s fingers plunged into the place where him just brushing by it made her taste a pleasure that shook her whole body. When he caressed the place, Medea was seized with obscene pleasures as if she had been struck by lightning.\u201cAhhhhhhhhh\u2026!\u201dAs she tasted the peak, strength left her legs. Lyle, who didn\u2019t miss the opportunity, rubbed the soaked flower wine as if it were adorable.\u201cNo! Unnnnghhh, OH! ahhhh\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe was embarrassed and tried to close her legs again, but Lyle\u2019s fingertips touched the flower\u2019s head. Just one rub rained down sparks in her eyes as firecrackers exploded in her head.\u201cHA-Ahhh-oh-oh! Uh, unh, ahhh! Aangghhhhh! Haaa!Her body bent like a bow as her slippery flower bud was touched. Between her trembling legs, her clitoris was being intensively tormented.\u201cOooh! nnggh! Aaahh, unnng!\u201dHer body shuddered and tasted pinnacles again and again. Medea sobbed as she tasted a feast of climaxes, which was repeatedly reached as the momentum was stretched to greater heights.\u201cUhhhhh!! Wow\u2026stop\u2026. Aang\u2026!Lyle\u2019s groaned and growled as Medea\u2019s body pressed against him, struggling with pleasure. I wanted to put my desire inside Medea right away and covet her all night, but it was not yet possible.\u201cNot yet\u2026\u2026. Millie, spread your legs more.\u201dAt his whispering words, Medea shook her head with her cheeks reddened. Lyle smiled, anticipating her reaction, and gently rolled Medea\u2019s clit.\u201cOh, yes! Ah, ah, ah\u2026\u2026!\u201dWhen Medea alone reached an orgasm, Lyle continued to fondle her with a grimace, holding himself back. Medea sobbed and continued to reach her zenith twice\u2014 three times.\u201cHuh yes! Ah, Ah, ha\u2026\u2026. Please\u2026. Stop! More\u2026\u2026 Ahh\u2026.\u201dThe tips of her toes shivered with pleasure, and the liquid that oozed from inside of Medea flowed down her thighs to my ankles. Lyle drenched his fingers in the lewd liquid, happily tormenting Medea\u2019s sensitive spots.\u201cHow could you stop feeling this way\u2026\u2026. Millie\u2026.\u201d\u201cAhhhhh\u2026Please\u2026 Please, Your Majesty\u2026\u2026. I\u2019m going crazy\u2026\u2026.Oh. Yes\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle gave a deep kind look to Medea, who begged while drooping in his arms.Lyle\u2019s long, strong fingers relaxedly brushed around her vagina on his weak thighs, drawing a circle.\u201cThen\u2026\u2026 will you allow me to embrace you as much as I want?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026?\u201dIn her hazy head, she thought, \u201cThis was his purpose!\u201d but it was already too late. Her whole body trembled because he was firmly in Lyle\u2019s arms and tasted peaks dozens of times.\u201cHhaaa\u2026! No, that\u2019s not allowed\u2026.\u201dLyle kissed her on the cheek when Medea replied in tears.\u201cThen I will only make you feel more.\u201d\u201cHuhh ahh, ah, ahhh!***\u201cAh, ah, ah, ah, ahh\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea\u2019s whole body quivered with a pouring liquid. It was a circumstance she never experienced before. Lyle seemed to be happy when Medea squirted.\u201cMedea\u2026\u2026\u2026. This is the first time you\u2019ve ever ejaculated. Do you feel good?\u201d\u201cHuuhh\u2026I can\u2019t anymore.\u2026. Sire\u2026\u2026 Please\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe begged with tears, but only a soothing kiss answered. Even in the midst of this, Lyle\u2019s kiss felt so good that Medea\u2019s whole body was thrilled, captivated, and engrossed.\u201cYes, well\u2026.\u201dLooking at her bewildered half-closed eyes soaked in ecstasy, Lyle had a mischievous face as he gently caressed between Medea\u2019s thighs. She was frightened by the lewd tremor, but Lyle\u2019s fingers penetrated into Medea again.\u201cNo! Oh, no! Ah-Yes!\u201dShe must have orgasmed 30 times already. Medea floundered helplessly in Lyle\u2019s arms. White flashed in front of her eyes while Lyle\u2019s fingertips stroked her sensitive entrance back and forth as pleasure spread throughout her body.\u201cAha! Aha! Aha! Hiya! Yay! Yes\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs she reached a climax, love liquid reached her toes. She felt she would crazy if Lyle continued.\u201cAhhhhhh\u2026!

Medea trembled violently with pleasure and opened her lips.\u201cHaaa\u2026.haaa, whatever you want.

Yes\u2026.\u2026.\u201dAs they coveted each other\u2019s tongues with a rattling sound, their heads became blank. Lyle breathed heavily and laid down Medea\u2019s naked body on a nearby table. He couldn\u2019t hold back to get to the bedroom.\u201cAang, Your Majesty\u2026\u2026.\u201dLove liquid trickled through her legs at Lyle\u2019s touch. Lyle gritted his teeth and loosened his robe.

Lyle opened his eyes with satisfaction as he caressed Medea, who was in a deep sleep.\u2018Good morning.\u2019Smiling with delight, Lyle glanced at Medea in his arms. Perhaps because she suffered until dawn, her soft body was still colored like a peach. Even though she was asleep, she was still sensitive and even trembled at Lyle\u2019s casual touching.\u2018How adorable.\u2019He thought he could covet her all day. How lovely Medea looked accepting him and cried out underneath him\u2014 how lovely Medea was! Lyle looked at Medea with a satisfied smile.I\u2019ll have to go see to government affairs \u2026 but I want to do it.Swallowing his dry saliva, Lyle removed the blanket from Medea\u2019s body. He salivated as Medea\u2019s nude body was revealed under the sunlight that began to light up slowly.\u201cUm\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe had been desirous all night. On a new day, he was filled with passion as if he were full of new longings. Lyle drooled and glanced at Medea\u2019s nudity with a voracious gaze.The body that had been in my arms gently stretched out its defenseless, stretched its legs wide. Her navel was littered with traces of their affairs, intact, with semen poured out by Lyle.Nevertheless, the wet entrance swirled as if it were dreaming of something related to Lyle.\u2018Fuck\u2026.\u2019He couldn\u2019t forcefully wake up Medea.Lyle, who was apprehensive, slowly swept up Medea\u2019s thighs with the desire to touch only a little.\u201cYes\u2026\u2026.\u201dHis hand stopped when Medea tossed around, but he couldn\u2019t get his hands off her soft skin that seemed stuck.\u2018No, Medea hasn\u2019t been asleep for long. I can\u2019t hit it right now.\u2026.\u2019Since he embraced her until dawn, Medea only slept for a few hours now. Of course, she could sleep while Lyle attends a political conference and does his morning routine\u2026\u2026. To hit it right now.\u2026.While hesitating, his hand revealed her desire and touched Medea\u2019s petals.Medea\u2019s cheeks were colored, and her hips were lifted up, and her ass shivered.\u201cOh, yes\u2026 um\u2026\u2026.\u201dEven her tossing and turning was breathtakingly obscene. The thin waist shook, and the shapely breast fluttered. As she wiggled her toes as if she wanted to close her legs, Lyle gawked at Medea. He suspected she woke up from her sleep.\u201cMedea?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHer head turned to the side and glanced at him. Lyle, who was anxious, lowered himself a drowsy Medea.\u201cMedea\u2026. Can I put it in?\u201dHe whispered, rubbing his painfully hot and sore penis between his wide-open legs. Medea tried to pretend to be asleep, but her slick pussy was already soaking wet. She wanted to close her legs, but Lyle caught her.\u201cOh, no\u2026\u2026 from the morning\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cMedea\u2026. I\u2019m sorry. Please\u2026 I can\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201dHis hot penis was already spilling white ink. Medea was also already thrilled by Lyle\u2019s touch, so she stared at Lyle with wet eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026. It\u2019s your Majesty\u2019s fault, so take responsibility.\u201d\u201cGladly\u2026\u2026 My Millie\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle put her legs around his waist and pushed into her in a flash.\u201cAh\u2026? Haaa ha! Aang!\u201dMedea bounced on his organ and reached an orgasm. Lyle penetrated her with passion as she looked ecstatic. Medea who felt a climax just by his, was floundering and sobbing under Lyle.\u201cAH! Y- Your Majesty\u2026\u2026. Uh-huh! Yes! I\u2019m feeling it\u2019s\u2026\u2026!\u201dMedea struggled with fright at Lyle\u2019s fierce thrust. Lyle stuck Medea again, pressing against her.\u201cAh! Ah, ah! No\u2026 Coming again\u2026\u2026! Aang, Your Majesty\u2026\u2026! Uh-huh\u2026! Yes\u2026\u2026!She was already on the verge of a second climax. Holding Medea\u2019s wrists sobbing and struggling, he pressed her to the bed, and Lyle looked at Medea with dim, deep eyes that did not fit the situation.\u201cYou\u2019re to blame, Medea.\u2026. Now I can\u2019t stand it just by looking at you.\u201d\u201cL, lie! Ah ahhh! Hiccup, already\u2026.! Fuck!\u201dMedea\u2019s head quickly turned white with his fierce thrusting. Medea was agitated by the fullness of pleasure.\u201cYes! Yes, yes, annngghhhhhhh!\u2026. Good. Uh-huh.\u2026.Ah\u2026..\u201dWhat a lewd act first thing in the morning! Soon, her maids would come to the room to wake her up!Medea tried to escape from under Lyle, frightened by her reason falling apart.If you start the morning like this, you\u2019ll think of this all day!Lyle, however, seemed to have no intention of letting her go, poured out kisses that seemed to melt her resolve every time Medea said no. She didn\u2019t know anything else; she was distracted by Lyle\u2019s kiss and fell in lust.\u201cUnnnnn\u2026.\u2026. Oh! Unnn\u2026ahhhh!\u201dWith Lyle\u2019s kiss, Medea climaxed again. It was a naughty morning.***Officials all glanced at the Emperor\u2019s appearance, which seemed to be in a better mood than ever. All officials now knew that when he was in such a good mood, it was due to the Empress.Recently, the Emperor left work early to quickly return to his residence. His aide, Sid, smiled widely. If the Empress kept at it, it would not be painful to go to work every day.On the other hand, Medea, who was unable to walk properly, was being served by the maids-in-waiting while taking a bath and grinding her teeth.\u2018Tonight is never happening! Tsk! Look at this! I\u2019ve given you permission for one time. But you really played such a trick? I felt good, but\u2026Anyway! Not tonight for my waist!Medea\u2019s body was so promiscuous that the maids-in-waiting blushed while attending to her. As well as the plentiful kiss marks, there were remains of his strong grip on her ass cheeks, and waist was also marked.Medea, who was getting her nails with her body deep in the bathtub, sighed deeply.She needed to rein in her greed. She liked it too much. She was like a kid, too. She stuck in a place, and she couldn\u2019t even get out\u2026\u2026.My back was throbbing with pain, so I thought it was no good.\u2018But I\u2019m not seeing Lyle because he\u2019s too good at night!\u2019If I really couldn\u2019t do that, I would kick him out of bed!

Lyle called on officials to be quick and accurate, and competent as a matter of course to follow.However, if he deemed someone\u2019s work to be good one day, the next day it could be the worst, and the people around him were roasted.It seemed like he was ready to pounce on mistakes and grill them.So officials stayed on their toes and tried hard to make sure that there were no mistakes in the documents presented to the Emperor.When officials secretly asked the reason through the maids and attendants, they said that his mood depended on whether or not he had relations with the Empress.\u2018Oh, my Heavens.\u2019At least the courtiers were less bullied by the Emperor, the officials in the administrative palace were indiscriminately exposed to the Emperor\u2019s tyranny.\u201cIs it today, too?\u201d\u201cShe said that the Empress didn\u2019t let him embrace her last night. Now we\u2019re done\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs such, the officials of the administrative palace were paying keen attention to the situation of the Emperor and the Empress at night. Thus it was natural that the issue entered the ears of other high-ranking nobles.Everyone was shocked because he was previously an Emperor who ignored the Empress. The most surprising thing was the Duke of Card, who knew nothing.The Duke tried, again and again, to meet with the Empress to see if the rumors were true. However, he was still prohibited from meeting the Empress.It was not a day or two, but the servant who delivered the message was silent and very nervous when the Duke asked what the Empress\u2019s Her Majesty had done wrong to be on probation for so long.Feeling a strange foreboding, the Duke filed a petition with the Emperor. A day and a half after sending the petition, an answer came from the Imperial Palace. Since the Duke of Card was the Empress\u2019s father, he would grant special permission to meet the Empress.The Duke of Card smiled inwardly. It was apparent that the Emperor was reluctant.Why on earth did the Emperor do that \u2013because of the different relationship between the Emperor and Empress?Desiring to see and confirm the change with his own eyes, the Duke of Card hastened the carriage bound for the Imperial court.***Going to the receiving hall, the Duke of Card was calculating how he would deal with Medea.Previously, Medea had never given birth to the Emperor\u2019s child; he could threaten that she could be dethroned without Duke Card\u2019s power at any time. Although he knew Medea hated him, her father, the Duke, she was always forced to give in to Duke Card because she was an Empress who Lyle could not love.But since she was the Emperor\u2019s favorite now, dealing with Medea would be quite different. With this in mind, the Duke of Card thought he should gently appease Medea this time.While praising her for acquiring the Emperor\u2019s favor, he was going to gently scare her with her childlessness and remind her that she still needed the power of the Duke in loo of a prince who had not yet been born.Medea would never see this coming and would eventually succumb to him.\u201cHer Majesty, the. Empress is arriving.\u201dThe Duke of Card bowed politely and posed to the servant\u2019s announcement.The door to the back of the colorful jade opened, and Medea, dressed in a luxurious dress, entered the hall. The Duke of Card hurriedly raised his head and was surprised by the brightness of Medea.The lean body, which was always on a diet to the point of being excessive to catch Lyle\u2019s eyes, had gained weight and looked good. In addition, the Duke of Card was quite surprised at the strangely colorful appearance, perhaps because the Emperor favored her. Medea had always been beautiful, but she always seemed to be chased by someone and couldn\u2019t shake off the tense atmosphere that surrounded and coloured her.\u201c\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m glad you look good,\u201dthe Duke said, concealing his surprise.Sitting on the Empress\u2019s throne, Medea looked down on the Duke of Card with a slight frown.In the novel, the Duke of Card was a villain who interfered with Seira, the main character. He suspected Seira, a young knight who had been strangely favored by the Emperor since the death of his daughter, Medea, and eventually even tried to assassinate her when he found out she was a woman.He failed because Luke, the Duke\u2019s son and second male lead, thwarted his murderous goal.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Duke.\u201dMedea knew how the Duke had treated Medea through the maids.The Duke of Card smiled graciously at Medea, who was looking down at him.\u201cFinally, you\u2019ve captured his Majesty\u2019s heart\u2026\u2026congrats, Your Majesty.\u201d\u2018Are you being sarcastic?\u2019Knowing that Medea had been treated coldly by Lyle, Medea could not be simply pleased with the Duke\u2019s words.\u201cWhat is it, Duke? The Duke and I are not very close, are we?\u201d\u201cHow could you say such a tragic thing? I can\u2019t believe father and daughter are not close. The world will speak ill of me if I don\u2019t come and congratulate my Empress even though something so happy has happened.\u201d\u201cI know there is nothing to celebrate yet\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea said, not concealing a quiver. The Duke, who had expected Medea\u2019s excitement, looked at Medea with his sharp curious, and mysterious face hidden.Medea was a child with great emotional ups and downs and was very happy even if the Emperor paid her a little attention. It was strange that Lyle wasn\u2019t attentive even though he paid attention to everyone around him.\u201cYour Majesty loves the Empress so much\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sure something good will happen soon. Where would the son of the Emperor go as long as the Empress is careful?\u201dIn other words, \u201cIf you are not careful now, his love will soon disappear.\u201d\u2018Huh.\u2019She was annoyed, but Medea concealed her feelings.Medea intended to help Seira in many ways and did not know if she needed a Duke\u2019s help in the process. She planned to get Luke\u2019s assistance, not the Duke\u2019s, but she didn\u2019t know what would happen in the future and didn\u2019t have to hurt Duke\u2019s feelings for no reason.\u201cI understand, Duke. Is that all you have to say?\u201dThe Duke of Card looked at her, surrounded with an air of resplendence without any agitation.Medea who understood what he meant and usually looked pale or trembled with anger.Where did this confidence come from? Trust in the Emperor\u2019s heart?Or\u2026\u2026 are you sure you\u2019re pregnant and have nothing to be afraid of?If Medea really had Lyle\u2019s child, there would be no disadvantages for the Duke of Card. Even if he and Medea were on bad terms, the origin could not be denied.\u201cYour Majesty, His Majesty is looking for you,\u201dthe servant who entered the hall carefully conveyed.The Duke of Card looked at Medea and fixed his face when he saw her face slightly red and embarrassed and not brightening up.\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lyle, who pushed into their meeting, glanced over the Duke with a blank face and turned to Medea.Duke Card clearly saw Lyle\u2019s expression change at that moment. His stiff manner was released, and affection filled his red eyes, making him look young. It was an expression of the Emperor that had never been seen in the Duke\u2019s life.\u201cWhy did you come all the way here\u2026\u2026?\u201dMedea asked, clearly embarrassed.Lyle stood by Medea\u2019s side and studied the Duke. He was worried that Medea might have brought up divorce without his knowledge.Initially, he tried to refuse the Duke\u2019s appeal to meet with Medea by ignoring it, but he had no choice but to allow him to meet with her after he sent a petition to ask what Medea\u2019s fault was and why she received probation.Medea\u2019s probation was, in fact, only Lyle\u2019s reluctance and had no basis. As the Duke threatened to pry into it, he had no choice but to allow him an audience with Medea.\u201cDuke, I saw you in the morning\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m seeing you again.\u201d\u201cI was worried because I heard that the Empress was still on her probation, so I applied for an audience. I don\u2019t know what her Majesty has done wrong, but it\u2019s my fault as her father, so please be generous and forgive her.\u201dLyle\u2019s eyes narrowed as the Duke spoke, poking his nose in his estranged daughter\u2019s business as if he were a good father and he cared. Lyle knew that Medea and the Duke did not have a loving relationship even though they were on the same team.\u2018But now Medea has no memory. She\u2019ll end up relying on me.\u2019\u201c\u2026the Empress is already a part of the Imperial family, so I can\u2019t blame the Duke. I will take care of the Empress, and you don\u2019t have to beg for forgiveness on her behalf.\u201dWhile saying so, Lyle circled his arm around Medea\u2019s waist and embraced it.Medea glanced at the Duke in surprise. The Duke was stunned and froze in shock.\u201cI thought I asked you to finish your meeting before my work was finished.\u201d\u201cY-you set the time late.\u201dMedea grumbled, watching the Duke\u2019s eyes.Lyle pulled Medea into his arms, saying he would not listen to anything else.\u201cThe Duke, now that you have confirmed that the Empress is safe, can I take her?\u201d\u201cOf\u2026..Of course, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cOhh!\u201dMedea tried to get out of Lyle\u2019s arms, so he picked her up. The Duke\u2019s eyes grew bigger while watching the two, but not an eyebrow was lifted as if it was familiar decorum to the servants and knights.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cY-Your Majesty\u2026\u2026.Please put me down.\u2026.\u201dLyle took Medea without being able to say a proper goodbye to the Duke.The Duke felt as if a ghost must have possessed him.\u2018Did the Emperor really fall in love with Medea? Seriously?\u2019***\u201cYou\u2019re saying that the relationship between my sister and his Majesty has improved?\u201dLuke asked in disbelief at Duke Card\u2019s words.The Duke seemed delighted. It\u2019s sufficient enough to use Medea politically, but the best thing was to mix Card\u2019s blood with the imperial family.\u201cIndeed, I had resigned myself to thinking nothing would improve with Medea\u2019s temperament. But it seems like something happened to spur this sudden harmony. His Majesty\u2019s eyes when looking at Medea have changed. I don\u2019t think we have to worry anymore. There\u2019s no harm in strengthening the relationship between the imperial family and our Card family.\u201dSatisfied, the Duke of Card confessed that he thought he would reapproach Medea again.Luke was not convinced.\u201cThen why won\u2019t his Majesty let sister off probation? I heard he won\u2019t let her take a step outside his residence.\u201d\u201cThe insides of His Majesty are unknown. All that matters is that the Emperor has become fond of your sister.\u201dLuke pondered and agonized with a grimace.His older sister strived to be loved by the Emperor constantly. It was a pleasure to hear that the Emperor finally fell in love with his sister, but he was doubtful.What do they mean he \u201cfavored\u201d her but then \u201clocked her up\u201d? Is it true that his sister is really loved? Perhaps \u2026\u2026 his Majesty was abusing his sister?\u201cLuke, don\u2019t overthink. Medea is now the Emperor\u2019s woman. Regardless of what he does with her, it\u2019s his Majesty\u2019s business; it\u2019s not something we, as servants, can interfere with.\u201dDuke Card warned Luke sternly, seeing his troubled expression.While looking at the Duke with a nonchalant face, Luke\u2019s fist tightened out of his father\u2019s view.\u201cI know, Father\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut contrary to his words, Luke thought that if it was clear that Medea was being abused, he would save her by any means necessary.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She looked back, but it was too late. Lyle locked Medea between his arms and looked into her face. Her ripe red cheeks were lovely and looked appetizing.\u201cLook this way, Millie.\u201dMedea was cute, looking down as if she was shy of eye contact. Medea closed her eyes tightly as he kissed her cheek while holding her chin up.Well, you can\u2019t turn down an invitation like this.Lyle could feel Medea wriggling, trapped between the wall and his arms. Lyle bit Medea\u2019s thick lips.\u201cHmmm, hm huh\u2026.\u201dMedea gasped a little as he touched her body over her clothes and sucked in her sweet tongue. Lyle indulged deeper in her mouth, drinking in Medea\u2019s saliva in ecstasy. A soft voice leaked out every time he licked and tasted a weak spot that stimulated Lyle\u2019s nerves.\u201cMillie\u2026\u2026I won\u2019t let you go until you give me permission,\u201dhe whispered. Lyle grinned grumpily.These days, Lyle\u2019s afternoon routine was filled with returning to his place as soon as he finished his political duties and spending time with Medea.She hated when he tried to touch her and avoided him but never refused to kiss Lyle. Using her weakness, Lyle carried out his will every night for the past couple of days, using his kiss as a weapon and yoke.\u201cHuh\u2026 um\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was a game that wasn\u2019t a loss to either side because he enjoyed tasting her lips and stroking his passion. The foreplay was excellent, but it was also delightful to see Medea lose her mind and fall in lust with his kiss.As he heard, the medicine had a more substantial effect on women because even though it is just a kiss, moans flowed from Medea\u2019s mouth.\u201cAre you already wet, Millie?\u201dLyle\u2019s serious question made Medea\u2019s face burn. Medea tried to push her way out of his chest, but his hard chest wouldn\u2019t budge. Instead, Lyle hugged her and kissed her on the cheek.\u201cDon\u2019t be upset. I couldn\u2019t help but read your mind. Are you going to be cruel to me?\u201d\u201cWhen y-your Majesty? You\u2019re being so self-indulgent every day\u2026\u2026. Oh, don\u2019t lick me when I talk.\u201dThere was a strange feeling of a tongue licking her lower lip. Lyle chuckled and whispered to Medea,\u201cBecause your lips are sweet. Millie\u2026\u2026open your lips so I can lick more.\u201d\u201cN-no, I don\u2019t want to. Uh-huh, don\u2019t put your tongue in when I\u2019m talking\u2026\u2026.Ah\u2026.\u201dLyle\u2019s tongue dug in at the first chance and rolled up Medea\u2019s tongue. Medea pushed Lyle on the chest but did nothing to him.Sfx of kissing, slurp\u2026\u201cMillie\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHaaaa hhhhhhaaa\u2026\u2026. [sighing]\u201dLyle looked at Medea with kind eyes, her expression becoming hazy and dazed after prolonged kissing and the licking and caressing of her lips and tongue. Lyle spoke in a subdued voice, stroking his thumb over her brightly stained, flushed cheeks.\u201cWhat did you talk to the Duke about?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026? Oh, nothing. He congratulated me on winning your Majesty\u2019s favor.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dHe had been worried that Medea might have brought up divorce to the Duke, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case.Indeed Medea was unlikely to divorce with the help of the Duke. Of course, she would notify him afterward to see the Duke\u2019s face distorted.\u201c\u2026\u2026Shall we go to bed?\u201dWhen he took his lips to her ears and whispered, Medea shook him off and slapped Lyle\u2019s chest. He backed down, unlike when Lyle kissed her; he let Medea go.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that again! Even though you already bothered me this morning!\u201d\u201cHuh? Did I bother you? It seemed to me that the Empress was enjoying herself enough.\u201dLyle said his words with a mischievous smile as if reminiscing and Medea\u2019s face turned red. The cuteness of the figure made Lyle hug Medea and fiddle with her cheek. She looked and tasted so sweet.\u201cOh\u2014 don\u2019t lick me!\u201d\u201cCan I bite you?\u201d\u201cNo biting!\u201dStruggling to get out of Lyle\u2019s arm, he didn\u2019t let go of her this time. When Medea changed her tactics and went limp in Lyle\u2019s arms, Lyle smiled and held Medea in his arms.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cThe Empress looks tired, so I\u2019ll take her to her bedroom.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not tired! It\u2019s bright!\u201dAt her urgent cry, Lyle cracked up. Only then did Medea realize that Lyle had teased her, so she pinched Lyle\u2019s face.The servant and maid watching were astonished, but this was nothing to Lyle, who was already familiar with Medea. On the contrary, he took Medea\u2019s hand, which pinched his face, and even bit her fingertips lightly and joked.\u201cAren\u2019t you curious about Baron Hestia\u2019s safety?\u201dHestia? I\u2019ve heard that name before.\u2026.Medea\u2019s face lit up in realization.Seira Hestia! It was Seira\u2019s family name.Medea looked at Lyle, holding her in his arms, gloating.\u201cDid they arrive?\u201d\u201cYes, they arrived yesterday and reported that they had saved the baron and his sister from being attacked. I didn\u2019t tell you right away because I thought you might be worried, but they are safe now without a moment to spare.\u201dThey were saved just in the nick of time! If it took longer, I could have been in big trouble!Medea was greatly surprised that Ian\u2019s life had been saved on the brink. It gave her goosebumps to think that the rush saved someone\u2019s life.\u201cI heard that the baron is quite a capable swordsman, even though he was ill. The uncle hasn\u2019t been caught yet\u2026Sir Gerrard says we should bring him to the capital for protection. What do you think?\u201dIf his sword skills were quite good, it would be Seira, not Ian. Seira had already changed her clothes with Ian to protect her brother.And yet, perhaps for Ian\u2019s honour, she didn\u2019t tell the Imperial Knight the truth?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She also protected her younger brother Nicole and won the Emperor\u2019s love.\u2018Unlike me, who is easily complacent, she is a great person.\u2026.\u2019Medea felt envious but didn\u2019t want her life or want to imitate her. No matter how hard she pursues her dreams, Medea wasn\u2019t interested in swords.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ask them to bring them along. I want to see what they look like.\u201d\u201cAll right, make sure you don\u2019t fall for the baron instead. I think it\u2019s a good arrangement.\u201dLyle whispered as he kissed Medea on the cheek.***\u201cYou mean the Empress?\u201dSeira replied in disbelief, her voice trembling.Unable to say that she had swapped clothes with her brother to save his life, Seira was still pretending to be Ian.At Seira\u2019s persuading, Ian changed clothes with her, and she disguised herself as him, but if this was revealed, Ian would become a sordid coward who threw his sister\u2019s life to the dogs in order to survive.What was yet to be uncovered was the poison Ian had unknowingly become addicted to since his childhood, making him very thin and weak. Compared to Seira, who was strong and healthy and had been secretly learning the sword, it was better that others mistook her for her brother.The two looked very similar to their late mother, making it difficult to distinguish the two of them, even by those who attended to them very closely.\u201cYes, the Empress heard rumors of a dispute here on the estate and ordered us to watch over your siblings. It\u2019s a good thing that we could save your lives in the nick of time, if the Empress had heard your rumors a little later or delayed in deploying us, you wouldn\u2019t have been as lucky. Thank the Empress.\u201dRumors of a dangerous Empress were known far beyond the capital to the Silore region. Because of the strong impression of a wicked woman afflicting a capable Emperor, they were flabbergasted to hear that Medea was interested in their lands and affairs.Indeed, Baron Hestia\u2019s estate was all swamp and rough mountain ranges, so the Imperial family had nothing to gain.\u201cI am deeply indebted to Her Majesty, the Empress\u2019s grace.\u2026.\u201dIan, dressed in Seira, spoke with great admiration.Other neighboring aristocrats bordering their lands acted complicit and harboured intentions to steal pieces of their territory. They had not dared to expect such assistance. Ian had to ask the capital for aid every breeding season of beasts. He was deeply thankful for the Empress\u2019s interest.\u201cWell, speaking of which\u2026I recommended Sir Ian to the Emperor. I couldn\u2019t let such a talented swordsman rot in the countryside.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dNow Seira\u2019s eyes were huge with dreams of going to the capital, becoming a knight while switching identities with her brother.Gerrard grinned.\u201cIt just so happens that the Empress is interested in you\u2026\u2026. It\u2019s a great opportunity. Your Majesty has already asked me to bring you, so you shouldn\u2019t refuse. We will leave a good steward on the estate so that you can go up to the capital.\u201dThe good custodian referred to Ian disguised as Seira and supervising the estate.Seira turned to Ian in bewilderment. She had masqueraded as her brother to save Ian\u2019s life, but somehow the situation became huge. She was in disbelief that he talked to the Emperor about her. If something went wrong, her whole house would be humiliated.Seira about to quickly confess, but Ian grabbed Seira\u2019s arm.\u201cIt\u2019s a good\u2026\u2026 opportunity. Brother.\u201dFacing Ian\u2019s determined eyes made Seira speechless. Ian held Seira\u2019s gaze and shook his head almost imperceptibly.Even to Ian, Seira\u2019s skills were outstanding. It was completely unjust that she couldn\u2019t be a knight just because she was a woman.\u201cBut\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe Empress has shown interest in our humble estate.\u2026 and the gangs working with uncle would dare not pay attention to this place again. So go up to the capital with confidence and peace of mind.\u201dIan knew what Seira was worried about, but he wanted to open the way for her. Even if he was a helpless brother in many aspects, the least he could do for her was let her borrow his name.\u201cWhen will you be returning to the capital?\u201dIan asked on behalf of a hesitant Seira. Gerrard smiled cheerfully and replied,\u201cWe\u2019ll leave as soon as the wizard\u2019s study is complete. Do look forward to it! If there\u2019s something to be found in your mountain range, wouldn\u2019t it be fun to talk about? Ahahaha!\u201dGerrard laughed at the Empress\u2019s ridiculous imagination, utterly clueless. Who could have suspected a high-value mana stone mine would be under-earthed?***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She ended up sitting on Lyle\u2019s lap on the couch.\u201cWhat?\u201dMedea was a little irritated because Lyle wouldn\u2019t let her off his lap. Nevertheless, Lyle\u2019s face was so cute because he couldn\u2019t stop smiling.\u201cAs the Empress wished, Baron Hestia\u2019s life is saved\u2026\u2026. Is there any reward?\u201d\u201cYo-Your Majesty, it\u2019s the knights who saved him.\u201d\u201cWho sent those subjects?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea stayed silent. She looked up.\u201cWell, I let you do it!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t ask for much. Millie\u2026\u2026.let me lick your breast a little.\u201dMedea was stunned by the vulgar words that were murmured in her ear. When she looked at him, Lyle was grinning mischievously.\u201c\u2026\u2026 you\u2019re saying that again. Your Majesty, do you like my body that much?\u201d\u201cYes, I love it. If the Empress allowed me to, I would put it in all day long and not want to take it out.\u201dMedea was dumbfounded at his words.\u201cI\u2019m just going to taste a little. What? Medea\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhile he whispered scandalous things, Medea struggled to flee Lyle\u2019s lap, but her arms were tightly held.\u201cLet me lick your breasts.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too much! I\u2019m embarrassed!\u201d\u201cThis is a bedroom, and it\u2019s just the two of us. I\u2019m not going to tell anyone that the Empress made me suck her breasts.\u201dAt his teasing, Medea pinched Lyle\u2019s arm and face mercilessly, but Lyle only chuckled while saying, \u2018Ouch, Oww\u2019.\u201cHuh? You\u2019re not going to let me go until night?\u201dLyle said so, even though he didn\u2019t have the slightest intention of letting her go, even if she let him lick it.Medea blushed and looked conflicted.\u201c\u2026\u2026so, afterward, do you promise you\u2019ll let go?\u201dIt was already afternoon but before evening. She didn\u2019t want to be dragged into bed already because it was before she ate.Considering Lyle\u2019s tendency, it wasn\u2019t weird to do it on the sofa.\u201cOf course.\u201dHe was going to let her go and then catch her again.Grinning, Lyle spoke. Medea was apprehensive of Lyle\u2019s smile but was determined to do as he wished. It\u2019s better to have small odds because if she refused, she would be embraced, and even if Lyle was lying, she would still be embraced.\u201cWell, then\u2026 You can do that\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea shyly said, bowing her heated face. Lyle grinned and pressed his lips against Medea\u2019s cheek.\u201cGather them with both hands, so it\u2019s easy to lick, my Empress.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dBut Lyle was already undoing and pulling down the front of Medea\u2019s dress. He loosened the cord on her corset, and put his finger in to open it to pull out her breasts.\u201cUgnnh\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI want to focus entirely on licking the Empress\u2019s breasts. Hurry.\u201dMedea was speechless as Lyle made obscene demands with a nonchalant face.\u201cWell, I can\u2019t do that. Ah\u2026. Just do it.\u2026.\u201dEven though Lyle was just fiddling with soft flesh, she moaned. When he licked the nipples on her chest, they began to stand sharp. She felt her voice come out. Medea whimpered, turning away from her breasts being touched.Lyle grinned and grabbed Medea\u2019s chin, and kissed her.\u201cUm\u2026\u2026 huh\u2026\u2026.\u201dTheir tongues were entangled, their saliva mixed, and he delicately licked the weak spot in her mouth. As she gave her lips to Lyle, her whole body seemed to be filled with sweet heat.\u201cHuh? Millie\u2026\u2026You have to give me a prize. Your Emperor is begging like this.\u201dAt Lyle\u2019s repeated request, Medea reluctantly lifted her breasts with both hands. Lyle smiled and ordered again,\u201cPushed them together\u2026. in the middle\u2026\u2026. That\u2019s right.\u201dThe already excited nipples protruded further as the voluptuous breasts were squished together. After suffering day in and day out in the past few weeks, Medea\u2019s areola turned into a watery pinkish colour.Lyle took in the obscene sight with a lustful gaze and licked it.\u201cAhhuh\u2026\u2026.\u201dA moan naturally flowed out at the sweet stimulus that spread to the point where her whole body was numb. It\u2019s not comparable to when he was drinking in her lower flower, but it also felt very pleasurable.\u201cAre you feeling good, Empress?\u201dLyle inquired with a laugh.Medea felt like crying with chagrin. Here she was sticking out her breasts to Lyle as if she were asking him to lick her! There was no denying it with her face glowing red with pleasure.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026Hurry up\u2026.\u201dMedea meant for Lyle to lick it quickly and finish it, but it also could sound like a plea for him to lick it urgently in passion. Lyle grinned and buried his face amongst Medea\u2019s breasts. She looked even more appetizing when her small hands emphasized her rich breasts.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u2026Ah, uh\u2026. Oh\u2026\u2026 Ahhh, oh\u2026\u2026. Ooohhh!\u201dAll her attention was focused on Lyle\u2019s small movements. His breath hit the top of her wet breast, and her ass naturally shook, stirred up as his hot tongue circled and licked along the perimeter of her nipple.She felt amazing\u2026It was a massive dilemma because she felt so good with Lyle. What if Lyle wielded it against her sooner or later?Neat lips bit small bumps and sucked them in. Medea groaned with angst and pleasure and tried to endure.Her body\u2019s senses were gradually elevating, driving her to one place.Medea already tasted it dozens of times every night, so she knew what it was. Medea had never before climaxed to the sole caressing of her breasts.She was embarrassed just imagining it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lyle smacked his lips at Medea, his appetite stirred by her gasping with a red face.\u201cMillie\u2026\u2026 .you\u2019ve only washed a little. I want to suck them more.

No\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYour answer is late.\u201dLyle stopped smiling; the ribbon decorating Medea\u2019s dress came undone.

No\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle propped up Medea\u2019s breasts with both hands, biting and sucked them gently.

Medea sobbed, twisting her body at the deviant stimulus.\u201cIt looks completely drenched. What am I going to do with this lewd Empress?\u201dLyle smiled grumpily and touched the hem of Medea\u2019s dress.In a moment, the hem of the dress was torn, and a corset and petticoat was revealed. Lyle happily untied the cord of the corset that had already been loosened.\u201cCute Medea. Where do you want me to please you more?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t know.

Soon it fell to the floor with a slick sound.\u201cWhat will the maids think when they see that underwear? Huh? My Medea\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u2026. Please untie me. Mmhmm\u2026\u2026.\u201dGently kissing the struggling Medea, Lyle took the corset string he had placed on his shoulder. He fastened Medea\u2019s ankle with them and bound it to the bedpost.\u201cOh! What are you doing? Oh my god!Lyle, who untied the curtain from the bedpost, tied it to Medea\u2019s other ankle and connected it to another pillar. To her astonishment, Medea found her legs wide open and lifted.\u201cOh, Your Majesty\u2026\u2026. I\u2019m ashamed\u2026\u2026. Please stop\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNot yet. I\u2019m going to punish the obscene Empress who made my thighs wet and then release her.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle kissed Medea\u2019s cheek hot with shame and moved under her ass. Medea\u2019s pussy was already wet with love juices.\u201cOh, no, don\u2019t lick it!\u201dShe had already received Lyle\u2019s service several times but felt too self-conscious that she was so wet. She couldn\u2019t stand it because she was embarrassed.But Lyle gazed greedily at Medea\u2019s pussy, as if stopping was out of the question.\u201cBecause it\u2019s a punishment, you shouldn\u2019t feel just good. Don\u2019t you think so, Empress?\u201cHiccup!\u201dMedea\u2019s eyes opened wide as Lyle\u2019s tongue teased her from her asshole traveling up to her clit.\u201cAhhhhhhh\u2026\u201dLyle laughed deeply as she trembled at the stimulus that almost made her orgasm.\u201cYou\u2019re being punished. If you orgasm, you\u2019ll get punished even more.\u201d\u201cAh! Such a\u2026!\u201dIt was a completely unreasonable demand that she not peak when Lyle was servicing her. But Lyle buried his face in Medea\u2019s thigh as if he would not listen to her protests and excuses.Medea\u2019s face turned red with a premonition that her punishment would be a sweet fall\u2014like a bee drowning in nectar.***Every time a soaked finger with her love juice pushed in between her asscheeks, her body bounced. Medea struggled, unaware that she was tightening around his fingers inside her tunnels.\u201cYes, uh yes\u2026.Ugh yes\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhile his thick, long fingers worked her asshole, making her lustfully react and climax, Lyle\u2019s vulgar tongue came in and out her pussy, tasting her frantically.Medea blamed the aphrodisiac on her lewd ability to climax from her ass.\u201cOh, my God. ha-ha-uh-huh! Aaanghhhh!\u201dLyle\u2019s smile deepened when she bounced off, spraying a puddle and being able to taste her climax. Medea, who had already reached countless peaks, groaned in ecstasy and trembled.\u201cHaaa, hhhaaaaa\u2026.\u201dMedea couldn\u2019t afford to care about saliva flowing down her cheeks.She could barely protest Lyle licking her ass\u2014there was no way she could protest him licking her labia and drinking up her flower booze\u2026\u2026 she had already cum dozens of times.\u201cNo, no,.. Uh-huh\u2026\u2026.Ahh yes\u201dShe felt so good. Medea felt it every time Lyle embraced her, but now she really thought it was dangerous.\u2018I have to run away,\u2019***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lyle got up, licking the saliva off of Medea\u2019s face. Medea realized that it was her last chance to escape as the sight of the Emperor taking off his clothes entered her eyes. If she were to let herself be embraced like this, she would not be able to escape Lyle\u2019s arms until dawn the next day.Her wrists were still tied, but Medea rose to her shaky legs and tried to flee.\u201cOh, my Empress.\u201dMedea\u2019s appearance, her ass soaked in Lyle saliva, made Lyle\u2019s penis even harder, reaching his stomach. As white liquid precum began to flow from his tip, Lyle could not stand it anymore and approached Medea. Medea glanced back, trying to get out of bed.Oh!Medea was about to fall from the bed; Lyle quickly snatched her from the waist. Medea\u2019s face turned into a mess as she felt his hot mass heated her up and pressed directly against her ass.\u201cNo, Lyle\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dHis tip penetrated down between her ass cheeks and down near the core between her hips. Lyle\u2019s mouth was watering as it touched her soft, curling flesh as he would melting in her.\u201cI don\u2019t like it. Are you trying to run away? Huh, Medea?\u201cAh, ah, ah\u2026.\u201dMedea shook her head in anxiety as he barely inserted the tip and rubbed her sensitive entrance.\u201cN-no\u2026. un\u2026Put it in\u2026\u2026.\u201dOops.Lyle grinned as Medea turned red at the words she had inadvertently murmured.\u201cGladly.\u201d\u201cHah-!\u201dWords could not adequately express the deep-seated pleasure that oozed out. Lyle pushed himself all the way in, to his root at once as he grabbed Medea by the waist and began to thrust into her in a frenzy.Medea reached a zenith again, shuddered, and focused on pleasure. To her embarrassment, she felt so good.\u201cNo, no\u2026\u2026. Feeling so good.\u2026. Ah! Ahhhhhh\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle sank into bed, hugging her from behind, clasping the struggling Medea\u2019s breasts. He put her trembling legs over his knees and spread them wide to reveal her secrets.\u201cHuh! Uh oh, oh, yes! Ahhh\u2026\u2026no\u2026\u2026!\u201dHis fingers dug between her legs using the saliva-soaked flower liquor. Her body quickly reached its apex when he used body fluids to lubricate the place where she trembled if Lyle just brushed by it.\u201cAh! Ahhhhhh\u2026\u2026.Stop\u2026\u2026!\u201dIt was clear that he was to covet her until she lost her mind. Medea struggled and tried not to taste her climax as Lyle tightened his hold over her flower bud and her body quickly reached an orgasm.\u201cHuh huh! Oh! Ah-ha! Ah-ha\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle\u2019s penis that filled and stretched her to her stomach didn\u2019t leave Medea alone, even if she was exhausted and spent. While sobbing and bouncing up and down, Lyle rolled her flower bud again, and she continued to reach peaks.Suffering from the lewd punishment, Medea wept in Lyle\u2019s arms.It was a regular evening as usual.***Lyle pulled out his penis only after Medea fainted twice. The ribbon that had tied her wrists he had unfastened before, but Medea was sulking.On the other hand, Lyle stood by Medea, glowing with happiness as he served her.The Emperor was waiting on, delivering, and serving her by hand. If the nobles found out, it would be hot gossip for months, but Lyle didn\u2019t care. He thought there was nothing he couldn\u2019t do for Medea as long as he lived.\u201cEmpress, you need to eat more. Your body is going to get sick if you don\u2019t.\u201dWho the hell got her body to this point?At this age, Medea already had five full-time healers. They were all waist specialists! [t1v:OBGYN or massage therapists, I think]Fortunately, she hadn\u2019t lost weight yet, but it would be easy to lose 2 to 3 kilograms a week if she suffered like this every day!She glared at him, but Lyle just grinned, gazing cutely at Medea. Facing that smile, Medea felt ashamed to death for some reason.\u201cWhy\u2014 why are you laughing?\u201d\u201cBecause the Empress is cute?\u201dShe saw maids lined up on one side of the wall, exchanging glances. Medea pinched Lyle\u2019s thigh under the table with a burning face. However, his overly-solid thighs were not easily pinched, so only instead her fingers became tired.\u201cWhy are your thighs so strong!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think your thighs are strong enough.\u201dMedea was at a loss for words when Lyle naturally said a vulgar reply to her whisper.Holding the indignant Medea in his arms, Lyle said pleasantly,\u201cWhen we\u2019re done eating, let\u2019s go straight to bed. Are you done eating?\u201dWhoops.Startled, Medea shook her head vigorously. She couldn\u2019t go straight to the second round without giving her back more rest.\u201cMore, I\u2019ll eat more! Prepare dessert too!\u201dAt Medea\u2019s determined words, the maids said they would bring more food with friendly faces.Lyle looked pleased with Medea\u2019s actions.\u2018Ugh\u2026 you\u2019re so sneaky that it\u2019s hard to push you away\u2026\u2026.\u2019Shaking with shame, Medea glared at Lyle.Lyle kissed Medea on the cheek, innocently whispering, \u201cWhat?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Surprisingly, the news that there was a vein of manastones ore left Lyle speechless.\u2018There\u2019s really a result? On that humble estate?\u2019This revealed the reason why Ian\u2019s uncle tried to take away the land.Lyle again sent a research team to develop the mine. This would create the economic means for Baron Hestia to feed the miners, and that would slowly begin to flourish into a local mana-related industry.It was Seira and her brothers who were delighted more than anyone else at the news of the discovery of the ore on the estate. The Empress has happily stated that she will not take away their mines but invest, and the profit share was favorable to them.From his parents\u2019 carriage accident to Ian\u2019s disease, that turned out to be an addiction\u2026\u2026. It seemed that their string of bad luck had really turned around to good fortune.The three siblings were embarrassed by the favor the Empress showed them. Seira was the only one who came to the capital, so Ian asked her to thank the Empress properly.Even so, Seira was nervous. There were so many awful rumors about the Empress that even if she showed them favor for no reason, they could not help but be suspicious.Seira, who entered the audience room with the dispatched knights, was nervous, and her heart was pounding. She was daring to have an audience with the Emperor and the Empress under disguise\u2014she was pretending to be her brother. Later, if this were discovered, her whole family could have been imprisoned for insulting and lying to the imperial family.Am I behaving properly? Can I do this?\u201cHis Majesty and Her Majesty are coming in!\u201dAt the cry of the servant, the knights hurried to straighten their statures. Seira also stood alert and looked into the royal passageway.The Emperor and the Empress wearing colorful grand clothing entered. The Emperor\u2019s appearance was outstanding, but it was really the spirit and overwhelming charisma that gave Seira a cold sweat. The Emperor\u2019s handsome features came into sight afterwards.The Empress was coming in, holding the Emperor\u2019s hand. The following maids lifted her skirt slightly so that she wouldn\u2019t step on it.\u2018Beautiful\u2026\u2019She had never seen such a beautiful woman in her life. She seemed flawless, with blue-colored silver hair that seemed to be made by melting the moonlight, smooth and white skin, thick red lips, a slender waist, and thin arms.Seira looked at Medea in rapture and barely recovered her mind at the tap of Sir Gerrard next to her. Seira lowered her eyes.Her heart was pounding in her red ears even though she was also a woman.\u2018He\u2026.\u2019Lyle glanced at Seira, escorted Medea onto her throne, and then settled himself down on his throne.\u201cI\u2019ve heard the report. You found a mine?\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201dLord Gerrard\u2019s voice as he raised his head was full of strength.The Emperor mobilized the group to win the Empress\u2019s favor, but I was startled that such an unintentional contribution was made.It\u2019s like a lightning bolt accidentally fell and caught a mouse. Regardless, as the Baron\u2019s life was saved they also found a huge vein of mana stones.\u201cWell done, it must have been unexpected, but you responded competently in saving the Baron\u2019s life.\u201dLyle\u2019s gaze at Seira was somehow cold. Medea, who was sitting next to him and watching Lyle, wondered what was going on.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with him?\u2019In the novel, Lyle treated Seira well, with a good feeling from the beginning. She was a \u2018Baron\u2019 far from power and felt sorry to hear that \u2018he\u2019 had recently lost \u2018his sister\u2019 in an attack from his uncle.He had even taken care of Seira\u2019s lodgings, who had just come to the capital so that she could stay at the countess\u2019s house where his nanny was.\u2018Wait, wait, wait! So, where\u2019s Lyle\u2019s consideration for you?\u2019Medea turned her head and looked at Seira.She would be in danger if the fact that she was a woman was revealed here.\u201cI heard Baron Hestia had no ties with the nobleman of the capital\u2026\u2026. Where are you going to stay?\u201d\u2018I\u2019d rather you say an inn!\u2019However, the situation has fallen short of Medea\u2019s expectations. Sir Gerrard stepped forward with a grin.\u201cSince this is a talent I\u2019ve recommended, he will stay at my mansion with my knights.\u201d\u2018No!\u2019It would be only a matter of time before Seira\u2019s identity would be revealed if she had to share accommodation with knights. Seira\u2019s face turned white as soon as she heard this.\u201cWell, Baron Hestia has a bad complexion. Even a local aristocrat is a lord who thinks they are too good for a knight\u2019s barracks?\u201dTo Lyle\u2019s grumpy question and not reading this on the og translators site, Medea pinched Lyle\u2019s forearm hard, pretending to cross her arms. The pain was considerable because she chose the part without decoration and pitched with her nails. Lyle almost made a loud noise and looked at Medea.Medea spoke with a fake smile. Of course, the smile was pretty beautiful, too.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026..you speak of things that are, of course. Lord Hestia has mastered swordsmanship, but I heard he was weak. Lord Hestia also a business partner in the mines, so instead of Lord Garrard getting the honor, I\u2019d like him to be the guest of Duke Card.\u201dWill let me, Your Majesty?If you\u2019re not going to help Seira, I\u2019ll send her to Luke, you son of a bitch! What are you doing to the heroine?Lyle\u2019s face heated up when he saw Medea\u2019s aegyo [cuteness] even though she smiled with a commercial smile.\u201cWell\u2026\u2026 I guess so.\u201dWith the appearance of the Emperor reluctantly allowing it, Lord Gerrard saw that\u2019s how he was sent to Silore.His Majesty was wrapped very tightly around her finger.Seira didn\u2019t show it, but she was relieved inside. She was still nervous being the Duke\u2019s guest but at least she would have more privacy and better accommodations than at the knight\u2019s barracks.The Empress, who she had already thought of as a benefactor, was now on the level of a goddess. As Seira looked at Medea with a moved look and sparkling eyes, Medea smiled back at her as if she were looking at a kitten.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle, who was watching the scene from the side, somehow felt twisted.

I thought I told you to keep your eyes on me. \u2026\u2026you don\u2019t care about me?\u201dInstantly, Medea\u2019s face heated up. Shamefully, Lord Gerrard and the others quickly ducked their heads down\u2014pretending not to see.His actions determined Lyle\u2019s first impression to Seira.\u2018I can\u2019t believe it\u2026\u2019***\u2018I couldn\u2019t express my thanks.\u2019Seira left the audience room with a sullen face. Every time she tried to talk to the Empress, she couldn\u2019t say a word because the Emperor interrupted her.The Empress saved my brother\u2019s life, made them aware of the existence of the mine they didn\u2019t even know existed, and even invested in it. She even asked Seira, who doesn\u2019t have any blood ties in the capital, to stay at the Duke\u2019s residence.\u2018You must have thought me pathetic.\u2019\u201cWhat are you so depressed about?\u201dGerrard tapped Seira on the shoulder and asked. Seira looked at Gerrard as if she had come to her senses.\u201cSir Gerrard.\u201d\u201cWell, you are going to Duke\u2019s, so I won\u2019t see you for a while.\u2026 the Empress saw your impression well, so let\u2019s meet again.\u201d\u201cThank you for everything!\u201dSeira bowed down and said. Gerrard grinned and stirred Seira\u2019s hair.\u201cYes, go to the Duke\u2019s and work hard.\u201dIt was a rude act against a Baron, but Seira was not offended. Gerrard recommended her, so she was able to come this far, and he was the one who took responsibility for it. He was like a benefactor to Seira. He actually saved her life.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll make sure to\u2026\u2026 I will return your favor.\u201d\u201cWhat grace. See you later!\u201dGerrard grinned and left first.Seira agreed to stay at the palace for the time being, as she would have been sent to the Duke\u2019s residence later.Even though there was a title, it was a baron of a small local estate, so the room assigned to Seira was grand, but even this was more splendid than her room in Hestia\u2019s castle. Seira sat on her bed, relieved not to stay at the knight\u2019s barracks.She couldn\u2019t even imagine going to the Duke\u2019s residence.\u2018I owe you; I\u2019ll take care of the Empress\u2019s family\u2026\u2026. I have to work hard!\u2019Clenching her fists, Seira vowed.***After leaving the audience room, Lyle looked glum. There were some signs on the throne, but his face was transparent when he came out of the audience room.Lyle allowed Medea to send men to the Duke\u2019s residence, but he did not send her back to her room but made her come to his office. It was so she could stay with him while he was working. Medea was reading the love novel she told the maid to bring her.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSitting in front of the desk, Lyle gazed at Medea. She was concentrating on the novel without even knowing that Lyle was staring at her.At first, Sid and other officials came in and out, but they glanced at the Empress in the office, met Lyle\u2019s frightening gaze, and stopped entering.Now only Sid managed to show up and post the documents.Rattle!Medea raised her head because he intentionally pulled out the chair.Lyle, who stood up in front of the desk, walked in front of her, looking at Medea.Tapping\u2026 Tapping\u2026The gaze, as he approached, was sharp. Medea looked at Lyle, wondering what was wrong.\u201cIs it fun? The book\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201dStanding in front of Medea, Lyle looked down on her with a deep gaze, making her anxious.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been upset since a while ago.\u201d\u201cNot really\u2026\u2026.

He had never wondered before about what kind of person she liked.Lyle had heard women like such smooth, slick-looking types, and upon seeing Medea\u2019s interest, he became a little anxious and inquired.\u201cI like someone who listens to me well.\u201d [t1v: HA!]\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf I wanted a star in the sky, my ideal type would not only get all the stars in the sky for me but the moon too.

Your Majesty must be annoyed. Why do you insist on being and going out with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle\u2019s mouth tightly grimaced as he looked at Medea. He stared at her with a disgruntled countenance, then abruptly sprang up from his seat and sat next to Medea.Now he knew Medea didn\u2019t like him as much as he liked her. It was the opposite of the relationship\u2019s dynamic from before [t1v: as in Medea loved Lyle more before].Of course, it didn\u2019t mean that Lyle wanted to go back to that time, but he couldn\u2019t help but feel miserably dismal whenever he was confronted with the gap of her feelings compared to his.\u2018Is this karma?\u2019Karma for neglecting Medea since the beginning of their marriage.As Lyle calmed himself down, Medea was analyzing her words, wondering if she had said something wrong.\u2018I don\u2019t think I said anything incorrect or improper.\u2019Medea glanced at Lyle\u2019s handsome face, meeting his brooding eyes under dark eyebrows that were frowning.\u201cTell me, what kind of husband am I to the Empress?\u201d\u201cA sex-loving husband.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle was dumbfounded. But he had some self-awareness and realized he deserved her assessment of him considering how much he bothered her.\u201cHo-o-o-o.\u201dLyle\u2019s upper body, which turned to Medea completely, slowly approached. Medea leaned back reflexively.\u201cWhen I hear that\u2026\u2026 Should I live up to your expectations?\u201d\u201cOhh! Wait!\u201dMedea freaked out and slapped Lyle on the head as he tried to snatch her skirt.

Outside, Sid swallowed with a dry mouth.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026 this is Sid. May I come in?\u201dLyle looked around the door of his office with an irritated glare, then looked back at Medea. Medea was frantically arranging the hem of the dress that had been lifted.\u201cCome back in five minutes.\u201dThen, he pulled Medea into his arms and licked her lips. Her lips were crushed roughly but his and his tongue came in to taste her saliva.Medea panicked and shoved Lyle\u2019s chest in bewilderment but he didn\u2019t budge. Why was he so strong?\u201cOh, wait\u2026.\u201dHe hugged his waist and gasped, twisting his body under a hand fixing the back of his neck. Lyle growled, hugging Medea, half lying on the sofa.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m just want to kiss you, so stay still.\u201dYou\u2019re lying!A hand clasping her waist came down and started to fondle her ass over the dress. Because the dress was thick she wasn\u2019t provoked but she was worried about who may see this scene.\u201cHmnghh\u2026.uhnnn\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea gasped as Lyle encircled her tongue hastily as he groped her breasts over her dress. He didn\u2019t pull down the hem of the dress, but Medea\u2019s body trembled as he grazed and pinched her nipples over the cloth as if he wanted to put his hands inside.\u201cFuck\u2026\u2026\u201dMuttering a swear in a low growl, Lyle looked up into Medea\u2019s hazy eyes. She felt like dying.\u2018Should I just do it\u2026\u2026.\u2019The face of Medea turned red and white as if he quickly realized the meaning of his burning eyes. Her desperate eyes, shivering head with excitement were cute, but Lyle decided to endure it by kissing Medea\u2019s fingertips because he thought pushing any further would hurt Medea.\u2018Should we set up a separate room in the office or let them bring my work to the bedroom\u2026\u2026?\u2019He had no intention of following the previous emperor, who had neglected his affairs due to his affairs with women. The previous emperor was still firmly in control of the military, so he never was dethroned but in return, the country was devastated and corruption ran rampant.The bureaucrats could not complain to the emperor, but the common people\u2019s lives were difficult due to the widespread misconduct of officials.It hasn\u2019t even been 10 years since that status-quo was reversed. The amount of work that had piled up every day was now at a manageable level, and the state\u2019s affairs were stable. He could not neglect government affairs now. He certainly wanted to fulfill the duties of the Emperor.However, his stomach was burning every day because of Empress Medea, who he couldn\u2019t embrace enough to be assuaged.\u201cShall we do it in the bedroom? Should we do it here? If you want to do it in the bedroom\u2026\u2026 Can I embrace you after dinner?\u201dIt was cute to see the fever rising on her relieved face. Medea was sure she\u2019d get used to those words, but she was still so embarrassed he wanted to tease her more.\u201cUh\u2026\u2026 i-in the b-bedroom.\u201d\u201cYes, as soon as we finish dinner. Come in with me in the bath.\u201dHe had added another thing, Medea opened her mouth in disbelief and looked at Lyle like he was a swindler.Lyle grinned and kissed Medea\u2019s lips again. Why are you opening your mouth so wide? So that it\u2019s easy to put my tongue in?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead of sending someone else, Luke himself showed up with a carriage, forcing Lyle to send Medea to greet him.Lyle was preoccupied with his scheduled duties as Emperor and figured there is no reason to be wary since Luke arrived to pick up Seira (who was disguised as Ian).But Lyle was in an unpleasant mood.\u2018The Empress is meeting the young Baron and the Little Duke?\u2019She had already met the Duke, so meeting the Little Duke wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference. Medea was skilled at coping with her memory loss without being detected.Lyle attached an attendant to report what the three people were talking about, so his curiosity would be soon sated. But still\u2026\u2018I don\u2019t know why I have such a bad feeling.\u2019He knew it would be unsightly if he left the office now and interrupted their conversation. Lyle was sure Medea would take offense. It was obvious that Lyle would lose points and lose esteem in her eyes which weren\u2019t much, to begin with.\u2018I want to go.\u2019His task was completed much faster than anticipated, probably because he had to exert extreme concentration to keep Medea from his mind.Sid\u2019s rule in the office was that rushing for nothing would only increase mistakes. It tempered the other officials in the administration, so now Lyle\u2019s hands were currently empty.With no work to be done, his mind had already entirely turned to Medea.He wouldn\u2019t dare go and sit next to the Empress, would he? What is the Empress talking about? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re laughing and smiling at him.\u2026.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSid clicked his tongue when he saw Lyle, who was wringing his hands and agonizing. It was an act that he should not have dared to do in front of the emperor, but Lyle was so engrossed in thought that even he did not notice.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and see?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLyle replied bluntly, pretending not to know. Sid explained as he took the papers Lyle had processed.\u201cIsn\u2019t it because you are worried about the Empress meeting the Little Duke of Card? Tsk\u2026 What\u2019s the big deal about a spouse meeting his brother-in-law?\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat would the Empress think of me if I went there?\u201d\u201cYou would look like an idiot.\u201dAt Sid\u2019s prompt reply, Lyle was speechless.\u201c\u2026\u2026Do you want to die?\u201d\u201cI want to live. So don\u2019t get upset and go see.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s going to go when you said they will look like an idiot? Are you kidding me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a nuisance, aren\u2019t you? Even if Her Majesty thinks you are unbecoming, what does it matter if you don\u2019t want to divorce her or ignore her? You can do whatever you want.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if you are giving advice or insults.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve already locked her up. If you follow her to the meeting, will your Majesty\u2019s honour drop further in the Empress\u2019s eyes? I doubt you even have a score.\u201dCough.Lyle was silent, unsure what to say and then looked at Sid.Sid was a guy who constantly changed women. He is good at seducing, but he couldn\u2019t maintain relationships.\u201c\u2026\u2026it\u2019s no use asking you.\u201d\u201cMaybe I\u2019m the only one around your Majesty who\u2019s able to date women properly? Besides, I can\u2019t date a woman for a long time because of you. It has nothing to do with my abilities!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t trust you. Isn\u2019t it because of your light attitude that woman can\u2019t trust you?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s because of the great and wonderful Majesty who calls me and interrupts the date that I planned two weeks in advance!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dRecently, Lyle has fallen in love with Medea and Sid has been able to go on a date almost every day. In that sense, Sid had a vested interest to actively encourage Lyle and Medea\u2019s relationship.Lyle looked at Sid for a long time before he decided.\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get rid of her guard first\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s off the table.\u201dSid clicked his tongue at Lyle\u2019s temperamental and blunt reply.\u201cNo, after all, isn\u2019t the entire palace your Majesty\u2019s residence anyway? Even if the Empress lives in the Imperial Palace, it\u2019s enough for her Majesty to move freely there.\u201dHe didn\u2019t think of that.\u201cIf it bothers you that the Empress walks around without your Majesty\u2026\u2026 wouldn\u2019t it be better to relax and oversleep at night?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLyle looked at Sid in bewilderment. Sid replied very naturally,\u201cIf you finish work early and go back to her side and go on a date with her, she won\u2019t say much. It is not only possible to hold it in your hands with power you should read this on that1villainess. Your Majesty, err\u2026 It\u2019s not like you\u2019re already running out of stamina\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe fact that Sid left out was that he was killing two birds with one stone, so he too could get off work earlier.Lyle was seriously deliberating about whether Sid\u2019s suggestion had any downsides. Indeed, Medea was unhappy about being on \u2018probation\u2019 and not being able to return to the Empress\u2019s Palace.\u2018Relax at night\u2026\u2026?\u2019That was a welcome appeal. It wasn\u2019t impossible.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s do that.\u201d\u201cI wish you the best of luck, your Majesty.\u201dSid turned his head and smiled at the proposition of being able to leave work earlier.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To her right, Seira sat looking nervous and hesitated as her eyes were drawn to Medea.But they weren\u2019t the only two in the reception room. Servants stood at attention against the wall as maids served refreshments.\u201cYour majesty, the Little Duke of Card has arrived\u2014-\u201d\u201cEmpress!\u201dLuke appeared behind the attendant announcing his arrival. Luke had apparently ignored the servant who would have led him to a waiting room and came straight over. The attendant quickly stepped aside letting Luke pass him as he rushed by and approached Medea.\u201cYour Majesty the Empress\u2026It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve seen each other.\u201dLuke greeted Medea politely, kneeling on one knee beside her chair. Medea realized that she was in a situation where she had to offer her hand. Luke held Medea\u2019s hand, kissed the back of it, and rose up.\u201cSit down.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201dLuke sat to her left with a smile on his face.His eyes suddenly turned to Seira, who sat across from him at the table.\u201cThis is Baron Hestia. He\u2019s just arrived in the capital.\u201dIt was the first time Luke heard of the name plus the baron\u2019s poor appearance did not reflect on the trends of the nobility in the capital.Seira nervously glanced at Luke as he studied her.\u201cNice to meet you. My name is Ian Hestia.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I\u2019m Luke Card.\u201dLuke then turned his attention to Medea again.Medea smiled softly.\u201cI\u2019m investing in Baron Hestia\u2019s estate. I\u2019d like to attend to the Baron as my guest, but he\u2019s taking the knight\u2019s examinations soon.\u201dThe knight\u2019s tryouts were held annually every spring.In principle, a lord of each estate could appoint a knight, but the most qualified and honorable thing was to pass the difficult tests and receive a knighthood from the Emperor. Because the Emperor would appoint them after the tests prospective knights were not allowed to stay in the Imperial Palace for fairness.\u201cCould you take the Baron as a guest at the Dukedom and assist him with the exam?\u201dIt was late autumn now, so Seira would have to prepare for the test during winter. It was quite a lengthy duration until spring, but Medea figured the spacious Duke\u2019s mansion could afford a long-term guest.\u201cOf course, Your Majesty. Of course, I\u2019ll listen to your suggestion!\u201dLuke\u2019s response was better than Medea hoped to her request. He was passionately enthusiastic and Medea felt a tinged of guilt internally.Later, when he found Seira was a woman would he condemn her for deceiving him and say, \u2018How dare you fool your sibling!\u2019This was different from the original story; \u2018I think Luke knew Seira was a woman from the very beginning and helped her\u2026\u2026.\u2019Medea hesitated and beckoned Luke. Luke looked flustered for a moment and quickly got up from his seat and approached Medea.As he knelt down on one knee and looked up at Medea, Medea leaned her head towards him and whispered into Luke\u2019s ear,\u201cIf something surprises you later, don\u2019t blame the Baron. I knew it all along anyway. I want you to protect him as much as possible.\u201dLuke paused and searched Medea\u2019s face, but Medea looked up and took a sip of her tea with a nonchalant face as if she had never said something suspicious.Luke glanced at Seira. \u2018What if I\u2019m surprised later? Does that country aristocrat have any secrets\u2026\u2026.\u2019No matter what the reason, it was the first request that he had ever received from his sister. Luke was ready to listen to whatever it was.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will do whatever Her Majesty wishes.\u201dMedea nodded at Luke\u2019s reliable reply.***After sending Seira to Luke\u2019s side, Medea left the drawing-room. By now Seira had probably already left the palace with Luke or was just getting the carriage that Luke brought.\u201cYour Majesty, are you still at work?\u201dWhen Medea asked how Lyle was doing, as was her habit, the maid quickly came to her side.\u201cYes, but\u2026.\u201dMedea shot her a doubtful look as the maid was reluctant to speak. She presumed that since the maid looked uncomfortable that there was bad news.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty said he releases the Empress from probation. He said you could also go back to the Empress\u2019s Palace\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dBut why did her expression look like it was a bad thing?Medea instantly rejoiced and her eyes shone with delight.\u201cThen I can walk around?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty the Empress.\u201d\u201cGood! Let\u2019s go to the library!\u201dMedea had saved Seira and Seira\u2019s older brother\u2026\u2026 she wasn\u2019t sure if she was missing anything\u2026\u2026\u2026but she decided to leave it to Luke, and now she could celebrate and play to her heart\u2019s content.\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to visit his Majesty? Perhaps you could thank his Majesty.\u201dFrom her attitude, she seemed to think Lyle\u2019s releasing of her probation was a loss of favor. Or something about Lyle being sulky.\u2018Do I have to?\u2019These days Lyle had been acting like a vicious loan shark with Medea. He would demand as he groped her, to pay him back with her body\u2026\u2026.It wasn\u2019t that she couldn\u2019t, but she was embarrassed.\u201cIt\u2019s still daytime\u2026\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll do it later!\u201dMedea quickly turned around and headed in the direction of the library. Her maids pestered her with anxious faces, but Medea was inflexible.***She\u2019s not coming.\u2026.\u2019Lyle was waiting for Medea in his office, tapping his fingertips on the desk.Of course, it was her free will to do whatever she wanted, but he annulled her probation and allowed her to return to the Empress\u2019s Palace\u2014 but she didn\u2019t thank him!\u2018The guy who follows and chases too much is not cool. Hang in there, Your Majesty! You\u2019ll have to deal with discomfort but you\u2019ll make headway.\u2019\u2018Your Majesty won\u2019t last long anyway.\u2019Remembering Sid\u2019s smug attitude, Lyle wanted to hit him but thought he had a point.\u2018I\u2019ve only been pulling too much. Medea just runs away\u2026\u2019 To some extent, he felt she also needed to struggle too.But for how long?Sid said he should only find her when it was the time before they went to bed. So there was less than a half-day left.And yet Lyle felt impatient and the wait seemed unbearable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as she was told her probation had been lifted she headed to the library. And now she was reading a book there.What\u2019s so good about books?The best thing about the library was the memory of their affair. Medea couldn\u2019t have forgotten, it had been so memorable.Lyle got up from his seat, looked through the documents he had already reviewed, sat down again, approached the window, and looked again at the performance report and the record season he had previously checked.Time seemed to crawl at a snail\u2019s pace.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle found himself walking to the door determinedly and stopped.\u2018Your Majesty won\u2019t last long anyway.\u2019When he remembered Sid\u2019s smirk (he denied it, but it seemed to Lyle\u2019s eyes Sid had been laughing at him), he couldn\u2019t step out.\u2018Dinner\u2026\u2026 Let\u2019s hang in there until dinner.\u2019He was wondering what kind of torture this was.***\u201cI\u2019m alone? You mean his Majesty isn\u2019t coming?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty said he was busy with political affairs. He asks that you not to wait and eat first.\u201dAt the courteous words of the servant, Medea went to her seat and sat down.It wasn\u2019t that long ago, but she felt strange because they had eaten together every day for almost a month.\u2018Are you really mad? I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong\u2026\u2026.\u2019The only thing she could think of was sexually rejecting him.Perhaps she had made him feel but\u2026\u2026 didn\u2019t it work out the way Lyle wanted it to anyways? \u2018Besides, Lyle seemed to like my reactions and rejections.\u2019 [kink alert]\u2018Or did I make a mistake? Something that hurt Lyle\u2019s feelings.\u2019But nothing came to mind.As she sat down and started to eat, Medea deeply pondered whether she had upset Lyle. If it had been before, she wouldn\u2019t have worried this much, but since Seira\u2019s appearance she couldn\u2019t help but be worried if Lyle\u2019s heart had already moved towards Seira.\u2018No, it didn\u2019t really feel that way\u2026\u2026. Every time Seira entered his eyes he frowned and looked displeased\u2026\u2026.\u2019Maybe hatred grew so much that it turned into love! Arghhh!Medea, who was agonizing over the thought, wanted to tear her hair out.Maybe she should have pretended to accept Lyle\u2019s attentions. The thought that Lyle might have liked Seira made her incredibly nervous.But she had no choice but to bring Seira to the capital. \u2018Taking away Lyle, and then taking away even my dreams.\u2026. Of course, I saved Ian\u2019s life.\u2026.\u2019It wasn\u2019t as if Medea didn\u2019t like Lyle. But she also didn\u2019t love him passionately so she wasn\u2019t confident in expressing her affection actively.She knew she was being selfish by not liking him enough but also not wanting Lyle to care about women\u2014except for herself.\u2018I\u2019m being a chicken [t1v: she\u2019s calling herself a chicken rib bone \uacc4\ub975 or weak or a kind of weakness/selfishness where someone hesitates to give up even though it is of little interest to them]. No, it\u2019s a little too delicious to call it \uacc4\ub975.\u2019As her shoulder dropped and she played with the food on her plate, suddenly everything became tasteless. After eating her favorite dessert Medea got up from her seat.***\u201cYour Majesty, the Empress, is the temperature of the water correct?\u201dThe voice of the maid-in-waiting came from beyond the partition where only silhouettes could be seen. Medea nodded with a deep sigh and then turned her head because she thought they might have not seen her approval.\u2018Yes, I\u2019ll call you if I need you.\u2019\u201cYes, Empress.\u201dThe maidens quietly left the bathroom. Although the Imperial family and aristocrats seemed to be used to being served in the bath, Medea refused to be served except when she was very tired. It was uncomfortable to be seen naked. [t1v: girl how did you survive Korean bathhouses?]\u2018Because I\u2019m in the Empress\u2019s Palace. Will I only be able to see him on union night?\u2019She didn\u2019t know why, but it seemed that everything was returning to the way it was in the past. Medea didn\u2019t even know why Lyle suddenly showed affection for her in the first place.\u2018I don\u2019t know why it appeared, so I can\u2019t even think about what to do about it if Lyle\u2019s affections disappear?\u2019Immersed in water up to her neck, Medea sighed deeply.She had thought it wouldn\u2019t matter to her if Lyle\u2019s fondness came and left. But she couldn\u2019t help but feel miserable thinking that it had disappeared.\u2018No, I\u2019d rather be comfortable, right? I will be able to sleep fitfully.\u2026. You can read as much as you want now\u2026\u2026.\u2019In the first place, this was the life she had hoped for. Medea had been cherished tenderly by Lyle for almost a month, so it\u2019s highly likely that they had made a child \u2026Wasn\u2019t this the boring life of an Empress she had hoped for?Oh. Suddenly, I really miss Lyle. So much.Medea, who was squatting in the bathtub and sighing, suddenly rose from her seat.Then she noticed something in the bathroom she hadn\u2019t detected before.Originally, there were large mirrors on the left and right sides of the bathroom, attached to the wall. But now there was a strange massive mirror in front of the bathtub. Two large iron swans were seen supporting a giant round mirror with wings.\u201cWhy did you put this here in such an inconvenient location?\u201dShould she move it?No, it would be too difficult.It would be a huge undertaking to carry it because it was so big. On top of that, wouldn\u2019t the mirror break if she did something wrong?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is it a special bathroom mirror?\u2019Medea got out of the bathtub and stood in front of the mirror.It hadn\u2019t been long since Lyle embraced her, so her whole body was filled with traces of love bites, that resembled petals. Lyle left traces on the back of her neck, trailing down her breasts to her inner thighs, buttocks, her private parts, and her waist and back.\u2018Somehow, it\u2019s a little embarrassing.\u2019Medea turned away, blushing, so she didn\u2019t see someone coming out from behind the mirror and taking off their robe.\u201cMillie.\u201dHer heart sank at the familiar voice.\u201cWe\u2019re gonna wash up together, right?\u201dAs she turned around, Lyle, who had taken off his gown, greeted her with a grin.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle smiled at the happy expression on her face. He had doubted Sid\u2019s words, but it seemed to be very effective.\u201cCome here.\u201dWhen he opened his arms and spoke, Medea rushed into his arms and hugged him. The joy he felt at that moment was indescribable, so Lyle had to repeat to himself that this was no big deal. It was unusual.Her breasts rubbing against him were soft and tender while his lower organ, which was already excited by the sight of Medea\u2019s body, now became increasingly stiff.Lyle lowered his hand that had been encircling her waist and clenched Medea\u2019s asscheek with force.\u201cOuch.\u201dHis mouth was watering because of the soft texture in his hand.As she grabbed and hugged Lyle\u2019s neck, he grasped and massaged Medea\u2019s ass while lifting her since she was shorter than him. Medea wiggled. Now that Lyle\u2019s penis was stabbing her in the lower abdomen, it was bothering her.Like Medea, Lyle became aroused when they touched due to the effects of the aphrodisiac.Lyle gulped, as he was about to ejaculate just by pressing against her soft skin. Not yet. As Sid said, he was going to hug her and relax all night long.He would be in trouble if he didn\u2019t properly seduce her and melt down her resistance that way she wouldn\u2019t refuse before he embraced her. He didn\u2019t think she would reject him now based on her reactions but he didn\u2019t understand a woman\u2019s heart.\u201cWill you kiss me, Millie?\u201dLyle said, hoping his voice didn\u2019t sound impatient.As Medea pulled Lyle\u2019s neck down at his words, the emperor leaned towards her gently. When they kissed lightly and fell apart and looked into each other\u2019s eyes, their gazes intertwined.\u201cThat\u2019s not a kiss,\u201dwhispered Lyle as he tugged on Medea\u2019s waist. Medea\u2019s lips were half-open as if she wanted a kiss.Lyle ran his fingertips across her collarbone and he flicked her erect nipples. Medea moaned and looked at Lyle as if he was heartless.Who was really cold-hearted?\u201cAhh.\u201dHe picked on her pointed nipples and gently rubbed them. Medea\u2019s cheeks, while looking at Lyle, began to heat up lovingly.\u201cTell me what you want me to do,\u201dLyle commanded while suppressing his burning desire. At his growl, Medea shrank and took a step back.She was running away again.He felt like he was going to die from burning. Lyle swallowed his rough breath and touched Medea\u2019s breasts, then caressed her lower abdomen and then pushed his hand between her legs.\u201cAhh\u2026ughhh\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs if it were unbearable to withstand his touch Medea pushed her thighs together. However she was too late, Lyle was already tickling her wet lower lips.Medea took another step back as the lewd sensations grew stronger. Lyle took two steps towards her and grabbed Medea\u2019s waist.\u201cSpread your legs\u2026. Medea\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle rubbed her petals while groaning in a low voice. At the racy stimulus, Medea twisted her back and shivered.\u201cAh\u2026, Your Majesty\u2026\u201d\u2026.\u201d\u201cPlease, Millie\u2026Should I kneel and beg? Will you open your legs for me?\u201dThe hand that had been tormenting her between her legs slipped away. Lyle knelt at Medea\u2019s feet. Media\u2019s cheeks were flushed as she looked down on the feverish enemy who looked up at her from on her knees.\u201cMillie, come on\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026.\u201dHesitating, Medea spread her legs. Lyle gulped when her trembling knees opened and her wet, dripping privates were revealed to him.\u201cOh, wait! Ahh\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea hesitated and Lyle pulled her waist towards his face as he buried his face in her core. A strange pleasure filled him as he stuck out his tongue and swept through her folds, and licked up her erect clit and spread her flower liquor up and down.\u201cHuh! Oh! Ah! Oh, my! Oh, my God\u2014-Your Majesty!\u201dSparks flew in front of her eyes while the tip of his tongue only brushed her clit, almost making her cum.Lyle reflexively pulled on Medea\u2019s knee as she started to inch away. He lightly bit her clit.\u201cUgh, aha haaa! Aaaaah!Her body tasted her first climax as he sucked her clit with a splashing sound. Medea about to collapse, managed to hold Lyle\u2019s shoulder. But Lyle stuck out his tongue and started licking her flower bud up and down.\u201cOh! Ahhh! Stop\u2014oohh noo.\u2026.Lyle! Ah!\u201dFirecrackers seemed to go off in her head in succession from excessive stimulation. She tried to run away in fright but was caught by the ass as Lyle drank heavily in her flower liquor.\u201cHhhhhh ahhh, ahhh, ah!\u201dAt her second climax, Medea\u2019s head bent back. Lyle propped her up, as his tongue lashed out and licked her twitching entrance.\u201cUgh, uh\u2026\u2026.Ahhh\u2026\u2026.\u201dShivering from his extraordinary touch, Lyle rose from his seat, holding Medea. Still dazed by her climaxes, he hugged and kissed Medea in his arms.\u201cUmmm\u2026\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His fingers came between her lower lips he had licked earlier, rubbing through her convulsing flesh without relenting.\u201c*Gasp*!\u201dMedea twisted under the sensual stimulus. Her body was heated by his touch that had, at first, delicately stirred her and now was rough and feverish.\u201cYou\u2019re tight. I can see how much you want to taste me seeing how much you are twitching and convulsing on me.\u201dAs he licked his lips, Lyle pulled his fingers out of Medea.OhhMedea swallowed her breath as Lyle turned her around and took his penis in his hand.\u201cUgh\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe wait was too long. Lyle had been desperate to fuck Medea. He felt like he had been waiting all day.\u201cAh!\u201dShe felt her ass cheeks being spread apart and he inserted his tip. He pushed in without a surprise at the sight of himself in the mirror.\u201cGasp!\u201dHer deep pink entrance opened wide and the magnificent penis was swallowed down to his roots.Medea, who witnessed the grotesque scene through the mirror, was speechless by the debauchery. Her entrance, which has already swallowed Lyle\u2019s desire to the root, was twitching\u2026\u2026 as if she wanted more of him. Her face heated up.\u201cUh\u2026\u2026.\u201dEven though he had already pushed it deep, Lyle thrusted again as if to make sure there was no place to push in further. Medea\u2019s back flinched as his tip squished her inside.\u201cUgh! Unngh, ahh\u2026\u2026.\u201dWatching Medea moan in the mirror, Lyle smiled as if he was greatly satisfied. When he reached out and grabbed her trembling breasts, Medea lifted her head and took in the sight of them in the mirror.\u201cUmm\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea was embarrassed when she found a woman with a shyly sensual expression. She didn\u2019t know she had this look on her face. On top of that, her flinching pussy was constantly pouring clear liquid even though it was holding Lyle\u2019s enormous organ.\u201cHa\u2026 I can\u2019t stand it.\u201dAs he trembled at the whispered words, a large penis pulled out.\u201cGasp! Gasp!\u201dHer insides tugged at him due to the sense of loss. The whole stomach seemed to shrink due to the lustful stimulus spreading along her spine.Then at that moment, Lyle began to relentlessly thrust into her.\u201cAhhh! *Gasp*! Ahh! Whoa!\u201dHis hot and large pillar constantly dug into her with a lewd bulge on her lower stomach. With a constant sweet shudder, Medea struggled to escape from Lyle\u2019s arms, only to be deeply fucked.Her wet insides seemed to melt with pleasure, he widened her insides as Lyle buried himself to his roots and twirled in her insides.\u201cAh, ah, ah, ah! Yeah! Ahhh! Oh, my gosh!Her body, which had reached her zenith instantly, was held in Lyle\u2019s arms, as his waist shook violently up and down, thrusting into her. Medea shuddered and sobbed with lustful pleasure. The strange stimulation that filled her stomach sweetly tormented Medea without a break.\u201cHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Noo\u2026 Ah! It\u2019s melting me! Ahhh, ewwwow!\u201dWhile struggling, she felt the second and third peaks coming. Medea struggled in Lyle\u2019s arms, raising her sexy voice. Her convulsing flesh poured out of love juice, and a sticky sound resonated loudly into the bathroom.\u201cHa! Ah! Ah! Ahhhhhhhh\u2026\u2026.Ahh! Ahhhhhh!\u201dShe was so overwhelmed by the lustful sensations that she felt like she was going crazy. She couldn\u2019t think of anything but Lyle\u2019s penis, whose whole body trembled when she penetrated by the obscene feelings that spread to her toes.\u201cOh, oh, oh\u2026Aaaaaaah!As Lyle tasted his pinnacle, he ejaculated inside Medea. Medea also collapsed into Lyle\u2019s chest, tasting a huge apex again.\u201c*Sigh*, *sigh*hhhhaaa\u2026\u2026.Ummmm\u2026.\u201dListening to Lyle\u2019s harsh breathing, Medea felt a sweet sense of satisfaction.She glanced at the mirror at the feeling of semen leaking out of her entrance, and turned bright red. Lyle\u2019s penis was deeply inserted, and the sight of a hazy semen trickling down through it was truly suggestive.\u201c\u2026Shall we wash up now?\u201dLyle whispered in an passionate tone. Medea, who was enjoying herself the afterglow, mumbled, unable to look directly at herself in the mirror.\u201cWell, let\u2019s start with this.\u2026.\u201d\u201cTake it out,\u201d said Medea in a tiny slow voice. Lyle chuckled and lifted Medea\u2019s ass up with his waist.\u201cOh, uh huuhhh!\u201dLyle\u2019s penis was still frighteningly passionate, Medea shivered at the feeling of being lift up from inside. Lyle said, pleased with the strange response from Medea,\u201cI will do it this way. When I\u2019m excited while washing you, I can embrace you right away\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dMedea was astonished as if lightning had struck her on a clear day. Lyle grinned and nuzzled Medea\u2019s waist.\u201cHey, shall we go into the bathtub like this?\u201d\u201cYes? Oh, no! Your Majesty, if you move now\u2026\u2026.Whoa\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want to!\u201dLyle, who lifted Medea\u2019s waist with one arm, walked to the bathtub. Everytime Lyle took a step his cock which moved left and right up and down, driving Medea crazy.\u201cHuhh, huhh, yeah\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want to\u2026\u2026.Stop, ahhhhh.\u201dLyle laughed as if he was having fun, as Medea trembled on his cock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lyle\u2019s breath got rough as he felt Medea get stirred up between his legs as his lewd touches provoked her.\u201cHaaaaahhaaa\u2026. My Empress\u2026 Do you already want to do it again?\u201d\u201cOh, no\u2026No, it\u2019s not\u2026Oh, no, it\u2019s not like that.\u2026.

Don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll give the Empress an unbearable amount of affection\u2014so much you won\u2019t be able to stand it.\u201dRecalling Sid\u2019s words to relax, Lyle churned and flexed his penis while deep inside her abdomen. When it lustfully rubbed her insides, sparks flew in front of her eyes.\u201cOhhh! Ahh! Oh, my god!\u201dLyle lovingly hugged a sobbing and struggling Medea, as he began to covet her for a second time. It seemed like holding back was a powerful tactic.It seemed that the strange sensation threatened to overflow after filling her stomach. Medea sobbed helplessly, drinking saliva filling her mouth.Medea\u2019s legs were spread apart and lifted by Lyle\u2019s thighs at his will. Her slender ankles captured, Medea wept and lewdly moaned.It felt so good. She felt like she was going to lose her mind.About a third of the water in the bathtub had been spilled while she struggled with obscene impulses. As she tasted another climax [of which she couldn\u2019t keep track of], Medea looked at the tip of her toes curling in the air.Firecrackers exploded in his head, and a strange sensation hit his whole body as if her body were floating. There were no rollercoasters in this world, but it seemed as if she felt that weightless feeling while on the crest of a drop and a sense of dizziness washing over her.\u201cUHhhhh\u2026.aaaaahhhhhhh, ah, ah, ahh\u2026\u2026.\u201dAlthough he was usually great in bed, he was particularly persistent today as if he planned this before. Medea tried to run away twice due to excessive stimulation, but it was impossible. From her middle, her legs were completely weak and she could not get up with her own strength.\u201cHa\u2026\u2026. Haaa\u2026.\u2026 Ooohh, yes\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea slumped when his penis pulled out of her. She was surprised that she didn\u2019t lose her mind even though he had embraced her so much. Her body trembled with lingering feelings and the afterglow of her orgasms with her private parts still contracting.\u201cHaaa\u2026.\u2026.Medea\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dLyle turned Medea\u2019s body around with a satisfied face as if the affair in the bathtub had filled his heart. Before she had leaned her back against Lyle\u2019s chest and now they were facing each other. Medea held Lyle\u2019s neck reflexively.\u201cUh\u2026 Your Majesty, um\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs if it were natural, their lips overlapped with an intense kiss and saliva exchanging between them. He was so happy at this sweet moment when he was kissing and embracing her body closely.Medea curled her legs around Lyle\u2019s waist as if she were in a good mood, and Lyle smiled,\u201cDid you feel that good?\u201dMedea\u2019s face heated up at his whispered question.Lyle chuckled and began to fiddle with Medea\u2019s body leaning against his chest. Since she had a sensitive body that was still in the afterglow, Medea gasped,\u201cOh, Your Majesty\u2026\u2026. Ah, not yet\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo can do.\u201dWhen Medea twisted under Lyle\u2019s touch, rubbing herself against his chest. Excitedly, Lyle\u2019s eyes lit up, grabbed Medea\u2019s ass, and pushed her fingers between her legs.\u201cHa! Your Majesty\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cLook, it\u2019s still tight.\u2026.\u201dHe inserted fingers, stroking and caressing her lower lips wet with her honey, watching Medea\u2019s face as she panted and shook her head in embarrassment.\u201cNo, no, no, uh\u2026\u2026. Lyle don\u2019t bother\u2026\u2026.Aaah!\u201dWhen he bent his fingertips and thrusted in her inner tunnel, Medea bounced back and sobbed.Lyle, unable to bear it any longer, grabbed Medea\u2019s ass and thrusted his penis in.\u201cOh, yeah huuhh! Ah, Your Majesty\u2026\u2026.Ahh!\u201d\u201cThis time, you call my name every time you cum. If you call me Your Majesty, not Lyle, or forget to call out my name as you climax, you will be punished.\u201dMedea nodded reflexively at his fierce whispering words, as he stroked her back. Lyle laughed as if he was pleased and began to thrust into her in earnest.***Would this be enough?Lyle wondered as he stroked Medea\u2019s cheek as she slept.Even though she fell asleep deeply, she weakly groaned when Lyle stroked her.Lyle sighed deeply and glanced over Medea\u2019s naked body. The woman\u2019s body, which had a clear trace of the affair, was enchantingly beautiful. When he thought that all those traces were inscribed by himself, he even welled up pride.He was thinking about sleeping without taking his cock out of her. He thought it would be difficult to sleep with it inserted because both Medea and Lyle\u2019s bodies were sensitive.\u201cMillie\u2026\u2026.Medea\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhen he sang her name quietly, Medea in his arms tossed and turned. He kissed her on the cheek and pulled the blanket over them both.Lyle hugged Medea in a delighted mood and went to sleep. A happy smile graced his mouth as joy filled his heart.***Lying on the Duke\u2019s bed [t1v: pretty sure the author meant she\u2019s a guest bed in the Duke\u2019s palace], Seira stared up at the ceiling blankly.It was a high ceiling.

With her face dyed red, Medea carefully lifted Lyle\u2019s arms very slowly, which had been holding her waist.Last night seemed to have caused Lyle to feel tired in his own way. Medea deliberately raised Lyle\u2019s arm and slipped out of his arms.\u201cHuh?\u201dAs Medea tumbled her legs out of the bed, she felt a stabbing pain traveling from my toes to my head as if she had moved her body wrong.\u201cUh\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea glanced at Lyle, who was still sleeping, and sighed with relief. He didn\u2019t wake up from her movements or sounds.Medea gingerly tiptoed across the floor as her knees shook. As her hips moved, semen piled up inside flowed down her entrance.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEven though it was the end of autumn and cool inside the palace, her face was burning despite the weather.Medea tried to pull her eyes away from her thighs and hobbled into the bathroom. Without knowing that Lyle, who was pretending to be asleep, was secretly watching her from behind.When Medea\u2019s figure disappeared into the bathroom, Lyle quietly pulled the blanket off of himself. It was cute and sad to see Medea walking with her legs trembling.\u2018Should I go and hug her?\u2019But could he stop himself at just cuddling? Of course, he\u2019d want to touch her, and if he touched her, he\u2019d want to insert himself in her.Even if his desire was deep, it was too deep. Fortunately, his desire was confined to one person, Medea. If he had tried to embrace many women like the former emperor, he would have felt disgusted with himself.\u2018Can\u2019t we do it one more time?\u2019Lyle thought as he looked down on his lower body, which was erect and full of power, maybe because it was morning wood or a side effect of watching Medea in the nude. He thought he had more energy than was necessary.Since they had already started, he thought it would be fun to push Medea until she couldn\u2019t get out of bed, as Sid advised.***Fortunately, the bathroom was clean. Medea remembered that there was a door for the maids and locked it and then approached the bathtub.The water facilities in this world were pretty good, so there was also a faucet. Although the general populace didn\u2019t have access to plumbing, hot water was available all year round for the imperial palace, loyal readers of that1villainess and the houses of high-status aristocrats.She checked the water, scooped it up with a bucket, washed herself, and looked down between her thighs. The semen was still flowing out little by little.\u2018I have to wash up before the maids come.\u2026.\u2019Still, she got used to it, Medea could move even though she had suffered so much last night. Even though she was not the main character, he was quick to adapt to it because she was a character in a romance novel that was rated R-19.\u2018No, you\u2019re supposed to be already dead.\u2019She was also supposed to be a villain.Medea, who had sprayed water on her lower entrance, sighed. No matter how much she wiped it off, it seemed to keep flowing out.\u2018I don\u2019t want to put my finger in it and scoop it out.\u2026.\u2019The semen is also the remnant of Lyle, and inserting a finger while Lyle\u2019s semen lingered within her had the same effect as when Lyle touched her directly.\u2018Lyle\u2019s still in the room.\u2026. If your moan leaks out, you\u2019ll be attacked.\u2019Medea\u2019s cheeks grew red, recalling what she had been embracing Lyle since morning.Well, no, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too bad either\u2026\u2026.Just do it?She hesitated and carefully poured water between his legs, and a large palm circling from behind her ass stroked between Medea\u2019s legs.\u201c*Gasp*!\u201dSurprised, he hugged her bouncing body from behind. Lyle hugged Medea\u2019s naked body and fondled her wet body.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026. Aang\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe felt aroused even when he was lightly sweeping down her breast. As Medea\u2019s breath quivered, Lyle grabbed her breasts and squeezed them.\u201cI went into the bathroom and wondered what you were doing.\u2026. Was it not enough for me to do it?\u201d\u201cUh-huh, ah-huh.\u2026.No, it\u2019s not\u2026\u2026.sir, I\u2019m going to wash up.\u2026. Ugh\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe grabbed her breast with both hands and teased them with his growing desire.

As he said, his semen was still flowing out little by little.\u201cHmm. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just semen\u201d.\u201cOh!\u201dHe gently rubbed between her legs and penetrated her opening. Medea looked back at Lyle in tears.\u201cAh, y\u2014your Majesty\u2026\u2026. It\u2014 it\u2019s too much\u2026\u2026. ahh! Please\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to bathe the Empress\u2026What were you expecting?\u201dShe wasn\u2019t planning on getting out of bed all morning, so it was a good idea to do it now.Medea\u2019s body trembled as Lyle stirred her wet flesh with his inserted fingers.\u201cHaahh, ah\u2026 no\u2026 From the morning, ahhhh\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re soaked for something like that.\u201dWith a grin, he stroked her vaginal wall. Medea reached a loud orgasm.Lyle turned around and hugged a limp Medea who was panting and sweetly smiled.\u201cSpread your legs, Empress. I\u2019m dying to have you.\u201dMedea hesitated at the whispered words that felt like a soft kiss falling from his lips and intoxicating her. It was embarrassing to do such a thing in the morning, but Medea knew how good it felt to be embraced by Lyle.\u201cOh, then\u2026 Just a little bit\u2026.\u201d\u201cOkay, just a little bit.\u201dOf course, their standards for \u201ca little\u201d were very different between Lyle and Medea.When Medea wavered while spreading her legs, Lyle grabbed one of her legs and lifted her up. Her pubic hair was exposed and shiny as her entrance was twitching as if asking for something.\u201cHmm- Were you looking forward to it?\u201dHe teased her as he stared at her core with a fierce gaze. Medea didn\u2019t know how to respond.\u201cOh, no\u2026\u2026. Ohh, Anngh! Ahh!\u201dSuddenly, his penis stretched her wet lower mouth to its limit as Medea and Lyle gasped and grunted. Lyle whispered as he grabbed and squeezed Medea\u2019s ass as he held and lifted her up by her buttocks.\u201cWrap your legs around my waist.\u201d\u201cAhh, yeah\u2026Ummm\u2026\u201dHer whole body was trembling with the obscene heat filling her stomach. Medea hung off of Lyle\u2019s neck while trying to wrap her legs around Lyle\u2019s waist. Lyle fondled Medea\u2019s butt as he held up her and then began to thrust with rhythm.\u201cGasp! No! It\u2019s\u2026 Oh, my! Your majesty!\u201cHmm\u2026 Good, Millie\u2026\u2026. Just like that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ahhh, already\u2026\u2026. Lyle\u2026\u2026. Unngh!\u201dHis cock was swallowed to his roots by her own weight and made her wild. She was pierced by an obscene pleasure bouncing around her entire body, savoring those lewd stimuli.\u201cAhhh\u2026. Ah! Ah! Ah! Lyle\u2026.\u2026Ang! Ang! It feels so goo\u2014 good! Oh my god!Lyle gasped as he thrusted and fucked Medea, who was moaning and desperately hanging on to him. Her head was so deeply dyed in lust and elation that it made her dizzy.\u201cGreat\u2026 Millie\u2026\u2026. More\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh! Ah! Ah! Yes! Ohhh! Ohhh\u2026!\u201dLyle still had a long way to go, but Medea didn\u2019t last long and reached a zenith. Lyle shook his back with a frightening intensity. Medea, who became more sensitive after tasting her peak, cried, saying she was dying.\u201cHaaa! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u2026\u2026 No, now! Yes! Ang! Lyle\u2026\u2026!\u201dEven if she cried and begged, he couldn\u2019t hear her now. She had to feel more.***Medea\u2019s body trembled as she returned to the bedroom wrapped in a large towel.While the Emperor and the Empress spent time in the bathroom, the maids cleaned and organized the bed and the room. Lyle laid Medea in the middle of the large bed and took off the towel.\u201cHaaa\u2026\u201d [breath out sfx]Her shaking and feebly breathing appearance struck Lyle as both erotic and beautiful. He ecstatically looked over Medea\u2019s nudeness before gently caressing her cheek.\u201cRest while I\u2019m gone. When I come back\u2026 I\u2019ll cherish you again.\u201dMedea\u2019s face heated up at his whispering words. He wanted to do it again after they had already done it from last night to the morning?She thought perhaps he was just joking but when Medea saw Lyle\u2019s insatiable gaze on her unclad body, it didn\u2019t seem like empty words.Lyle laughed as a frightened Medea pulled up her blanket and covered her body. Lyle encircled Medea\u2019s cheeks with both hands and kissed her gently.\u201cI love you, Medea\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea\u2019s eyes widened at the unexpected confession of love. Lyle once said something similar in the midst of the lustful fervor during a passionate affair, but it was the first time he said it out loud with a sober mind.Lyle smiled at a startled Medea, kissing her cheeks and forehead, and left the bedroom.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhat? Are you serious?The moment she heard Lyle\u2019s words, her heart stopped beating and then began to loudly pound.Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!As her heart ran a mile a minute Medea hid her face under the blanket.What should I do? I think I\u2019m feverish.\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lyle hides his status as Emperor and suggests that Seira take the knight\u2019s examination.Seira comes up to the capital to take the knight\u2019s test to evade reiterated threats from her uncle. Seira, who passed the test with flying colors and the top score, becomes Lyle\u2019s escort knight. Around the same time, a princess from another country appears and stays at a separate palace and talks to Lyle directly.Lyle pretends to be looking for the next Empress to keep the nobility in check and suppress them. While he does this he finds out that Seira is a woman and falls in love.\u2018I\u2019m alive, so it\u2019s not going to happen?\u2019The plot of the novel is based on the premise of looking for the next Empress.But now the Empress was still alive, wanted to live quietly, and was even favored by the Emperor. The soul of the daughter of the Duke was no longer around, and the princess from another country who offered Lyle a political marriage while hiding a lover was not present.There was even a nobleman who raised a woman to Lyle\u2019s taste(?) to wrap Lyle around his finger, but instead, he was distant and repulsed.\u2018Since it\u2019s already changed so much\u2026 It\u2019ll be okay, right?\u2019From mid-spring to summer, when the novel begins ardently\u2026\u2026 Then in late autumn after the Emperor and Seira marry and go on honeymoon the novel ends with the announcement of the imperial pregnancy.\u2018If I have a son, I want to call him Ian.\u2019Those are Seira\u2019s words.\u201cYour majesty, may I serve dessert now?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Yeah.\u201dMedea, who had come to her senses, raised her head.With being embraced day and night, won\u2019t it be likely she was already pregnant? With that thought in mind, Medea figured she must already be with child.Medea looked at the maid.\u201cThere\u2019s a clinic in the Imperial palace, right? If there is a woman in the clinic, would you call her?\u201d***After asking for a woman, Medea found out there were no female doctors; the imperial clinic sent out a doctor with a soft and gentle face with a feminine spirit instead. The doctor approached Medea timidly.\u201cYour majesty, may this doctor examine you?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dUnlike his weak appearance, there was no problem with his skills. Upon examination, his face brightened.The maid\u2019s ears perked up when they noticed the doctor\u2019s serious eyes lit up and he smiled brightly.\u201cAs you may have already guessed, you are pregnant. Congratulations, Your majesty.\u201d\u201cYour majesty! Empress! Congratulations!\u201dThe maids were delighted and rushed to bless Medea.Medea was happy but her heart was also complicated. The child between Medea and Lyle was a child who did not exist in the novel. Would her child be born safely and grow up well? Worry overtook her.\u201cHurry, let\u2019s quickly send His majesty this news\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cYes, do it like that.\u201dMedea authorized it with a calm face.Lyle was currently in a political meeting right now, but it won\u2019t be a problem to interrupt the Empress\u2019s pregnancy. Rather, it would be better to let the servants know. He could solidify his power and position by establishing a successor.\u201cYour majesty, is there anything you want to eat?\u201d\u201cYour majesty, it\u2019s better if you warm up.\u201d\u201cYour majesty!\u201d\u201cEmpress!\u201dThe maids who originally fiercely served Medea, now stood by Medea with great enthusiasm. In the past, they fretted about Medea hitting her head again and going back to her original state, but now they were hopeful and confident about the future.\u201cMillie!\u201dThe door to the living room suddenly opened and Lyle rushed in. It was clear that he had come running as soon as he heard that Medea was pregnant.\u201cYour Majesty, I thought you were still in a political meeting\u2026\u201d\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe political meeting is not important. I heard that you are with child. Is that true?As Medea smiled and nodded, Lyle\u2019s face shone brightly. Lyle was about to squeeze Medea, but when he saw the maids freak out, she ended up hugging her.\u201cThank you, Medea. From now on\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll do a great job.\u201dMedea\u2019s mood improved as she saw Lyle\u2019s thrilled face.Lyle carefully placed Medea in a chair and asked how long she had a child.\u201cIt\u2019s been 3 weeks since the last period so the child was conceived in September.\u201dHe asserted that the child would be born near the end of summer. Lyle grinned as he realized the date of their affair that led to pregnancy.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI passionately coveted you that day because I felt you were exceptionally cute, and I thought you had a child.\u201dAt those words said in the presence of all the maids, Medea looked around in surprise. Medea\u2019s maids pretended not to hear it and quietly avoided her gaze and looked away.\u201cYou\u2019re lying! How can you remember what happened 3 weeks ago!\u201cWhy can\u2019t you remember? I even remember what you said shivering under me. \u2018Your Majesty, I feel like I\u2019m going to die.\u2026. I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u2019 You cried so adorably while I was doing it.\u201d [t1v: omg ded.]At Lyle\u2019s laughing words, Medea pinched Lyle\u2019s arm mercilessly. The maids quickly and quietly retreated from the bedroom.When all of them went out and only two of them were left, Medea hit Lyle\u2019s arm as if she were frustrated.\u201cMedea.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! How could you say something like that\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle sighed happily, as he embraced a whining Medea in his arms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lyle, who recalled all their mistakes and inflicted wounds, had made up his mind to stop thinking of Medea altogether.Medea was Medea.Even if she lost her memory and changed, her sins would not go anywhere. However, his heart had grown too big to deny his current love for Medea.Lyle loosened his arm and looked at Medea\u2019s face.\u201cMedea. Can you say sorry to me?\u201dAt that time, Medea blamed Lyle. It was Lyle\u2019s fault that they had used the aphrodisiac.Medea looked at Lyle puzzled. Lyle waited still for Medea to ask questions or apologize.\u201cHmm\u2026 I am\u2026 very sorry.\u201d\u201cOkay. That\u2019s enough,\u201dwhispering, Lyle embraced Medea back into his arms.In the past, he could have never forgiven her, but with the way Medea was now, he could fully accept his feelings.\u201cI love you, Medea. Now and forever\u2026\u2026 I will be with you.\u201dYou, me, and our child. Let\u2019s live happily like this.Lyle whispered affectionately. Feeling the happiness in her heart swell, Medea completely surrendered herself to Lyle.She thought she had done enough. She had saved Ian and opened a pathway for Seira to become a knight. There was still a long way to go but\u2026\u2026 Medea was relieved to see that Lyle, who had met Seira, was not interested in her.\u2018It\u2019s fine now\u2026I guess.\u2019***\u2018Why did you say that? What is the secret Sir Ian is hiding?\u2019No matter what secret Ian holds, never feel betrayed.Why did his sister say that, implying that if he finds out something he shouldn\u2019t be angry?Luke couldn\u2019t shake off the questions despite his busy schedule and pondered over them from time to time.Seira, who came to the duke\u2019s residence, was preparing for the Knight\u2019s exam with full support from Duke Card.To emphasize that she was an esteemed guest, Luke ordered Seira\u2019s room to be in the eastern tower of the mansion, next to his room. The eastern tower had a stable, gym, and a practice field that Luke used, so it was the best for training.Luke often used the grounds, but usually utilized it at dawn before everyone woke up, so he never encountered Seira.\u201cYou said he doesn\u2019t need a servant?\u201dLuke looked puzzled upon receiving the butler\u2019s report.He heard that the baron was in a poor situation. Even so, he was now in the capital\u2014regardless Luke was certain the baron must have been served by servants and there were attendants in his territory.\u2026. Perhaps he had been looked down upon?\u201cWere any of the servants rude or disrespectful to our guest?\u201d\u201cI tried investigating it, but it didn\u2019t seem so. I think the baron felt burdened because he has already received a lot of support from the Duke.\u2026.\u201dIt was a burden.Certainly, Duke Card gave Sir Ian [t1v: remember Luke thinks Seira is Ian] plenty of aid. However, it was not enough to feel troubled when Medea was investing in his territory and benefit greatly from it.Of course, perhaps he was a commoner, not a noble?\u2018Is he a commoner? Was a commoner sent to become a knight and not Baron Ian Hestia?\u2019Luke thought about it for a while but concluded there was no reason to participate in the knighthood examinations while committing the felony and serious crime of impersonating a noble.In the Empire, there was a separate examination for commoners aspiring to become knights. Also, even if this was not the case, it was not unusual for commoners to be recommended by the lords in each province.Instead of borrowing Baron Hestia\u2019s identity, he could have just received a recommendation.\u201cThis isn\u2019t this either\u2026\u2026 What the hell is Ian Hestia\u2019s secret?\u201dLuke\u2019s head tilted with curiosity.He told the butler,\u201cI\u2019ll visit you as soon as I have time and inquire further, so you may do as you see fit.\u201d\u201cI obey, Heir.\u201dLuke, who was looking at the documents again after the butler stepped down, soon took his eyes off the reports.If there was something secret, there should be a sensible reason.Luke told himself he shouldn\u2019t be curious, his nerves kept focusing on the baron.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt would be nice to take a casual look for a change. \u2018Since you\u2019re the one my sister entrusted to me.\u2019Thinking like this, Luke jumped from his seat and left the office.***Seira was immersed in training for a lengthy time. The Knight\u2019s test was next year, but she did not slow down the intensity of her practice.It was a knight\u2019s examination that gained the attention and expectations of the Empress. Also, she didn\u2019t want to cause further trouble to her older brother.Even if she passed the test, she would not be able to reveal her real name, but if she passed the test and received a knight\u2019s title from the emperor, there would be no greater honor than that.\u2018I just need to pass the exam. If I pass the test, I\u2019ll go back to the terrority\u2026\u2026 and go back to being Seira, the baron\u2019s sister.\u2019It was obvious to her that she couldn\u2019t stay long because she was pretending to be Ian, her older brother.Seira sighed. It was late autumn, so even though the air was quite chilly, she was drenched in sweat and felt like she was overheating.Her practice today was riding a horse in full armor, so her whole body was throbbing.\u2018I\u2019m fortunate that I am in the care of the Duke.\u2019It was a great blessing to be able to take a hot bath after practice. Even though she had thick leather under her armor, Seira became more desperate for a hot spring bath since her whole body was covered with bruises after wearing armor.There are no hot springs in her native Silore region but the Duke\u2019s residence had one used for hot baths.\u201cWhoo\u2014-\u201c.Seira handed over the horse to the stablemaster. She went up to her room, took off her armor, wiped her sword well, and put it away.It would be nice to have an assistant do this, but if Seira had an attendant, they would inevitably tend to her clothes. If she refused every time, they might have thought it was strange and try to get a glimpse of Seira changing.\u2018It\u2019s never going to happen.\u2019Seira checked again that the door was locked and closed the curtain. Then she went into the bathroom attached to her room.The good thing about the capital was that the water facilities were well established and they read this story from novel updates. Even if the only nobility could afford them, it was close to a new era now that a pipe was pouring hot water.\u2018I can\u2019t believe I can use a bath without calling a servant. It\u2019s amazing.\u2019Seira turned on the hot water in the bathtub and began to undress.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Luke himself went up without summoning Seira.Knock, knock\u201cBaron. Are you inside?\u201dSeira, who had been resting in the bathtub for a long time, was startled. Splashing and large ripples of water, Seira jumped up.\u201cYes, ah, I\u2019m inside! Small Duke! What brings you here?\u201dStanding in front of the guest room, Luke thought his voice was quite far away. Was he in the bathroom?\u201cYou must be busy. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll ask you later.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine! I\u2019ll get ready and go out soon!\u201dSeira played the role of Ian who held a title, while the other person was heir to a dukedom even if he currently held no title.However, when it comes to the ducal household, they were members of the imperial family and the family of the current Empress. No matter how ignorant Seira was, she had to be tactful.Besides Seira was now being tended to at the Duke\u2019s mansion. The territory had the Empress\u2019s investment.Seira moved quickly, thinking that she should not keep Card\u2019s small duke waiting or walk to her room in vain.She roughly dried her wet hair and body with a towel and quickly dressed. She couldn\u2019t tie her chest with bandages because she was in a hurry to dress up but supposed she wouldn\u2019t be caught. After all, her chest wasn\u2019t big anyway. Instead, she wore a loose, thick shirt.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for keeping you waiting!\u201dAnd Seira opened the door.Luke, who was waiting in front of the door with a bored expression, felt like he was hit in the head with a ton of bricks the moment he saw Seira.Why didn\u2019t he notice it before?All she had done was tie her hair back neatly and covered her body with several layers of clothes. How could he not notice with just that!As soon as Luke saw her wet hair hanging down, he realized:She was a woman.\u201cNo, wait\u2026\u2026. No way\u2026\u2026. You watched the Baron train. There\u2019s no way a woman can fight like that\u2026\u2026.\u2019Baron Hestia was also able to swing a heavy two-handed sword with one hand, which was a feat even for a man. He had been impressed.\u2026.\u2018No way.\u2019He must be a man with an overly beautiful appearance. Didn\u2019t he know men with beautiful appearances? Like Lyle or something.However, the impression itself was different from that of the Emperor. No matter where he looked Lyle\u2019s face could not be mistaken for a woman\u2019s.\u201cCome on in. Are you alright?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no different\u2026\u2026.\u201dLuke saw Seira\u2019s slender neckline and her freshly bathed skin glowing like roses.He had never been cognizant of it but he thought the lines of her face and neck were too thin for a man.For a man, he would be of medium height, but for a woman, she would be tall.Luke took a glance, their fingers were thin, too thin. Their hands were as big as a man\u2019s and their fingers were as long.\u2026 They were smooth and pretty hands without the thick bones of men. Despite having calluses from training.\u2018No, I don\u2019t think so. It can\u2019t be such a secret.\u2026.\u2019While asking Ian why he didn\u2019t want to keep a servant or if there was anything that made him uncomfortable in the duke\u2019s mansion, Luke was continuously peeking and studying at Seira\u2019s face and body.\u201cNo! I thought it wouldn\u2019t be good for training if I was too comfortable.\u2026 That\u2019s why. There\u2019s no other reason.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then, how can I leave you unattained?\u201d\u201cAlright. If you insist and assign a servant to me. It\u2019s fine.\u201dLuke looked at Seira, who spoke dauntlessly, with an uneasy gaze.If\u2014if really\u2014 if Ian was a woman\u2026\u2026.Wouldn\u2019t they be more anxious than this? Luke couldn\u2019t believe she came to the capital in disguise like that.\u2018What were you thinking? No way\u2026 Does her Majesty know about this?\u2019There was no such thing as a female knight in the empire yet. It was not that women wielding swords did not appear in history but he had never heard of a woman knight before.Therefore, it was also true that there was no provision prohibiting him, and that there was no condition that women could not take the Knight\u2019s test.However, the lack of regulations did not mean that there were no practical problems. When it comes to women, they wouldn\u2019t accept the application in the first place.So even if she borrowed the status of a baron, she would be knighted in front of the emperor. If she was found to have deceived the emperor, she could be sentenced to death for blaspheming the imperial family.\u2018In a worst-case scenario, I think my sister would cover for me, but\u2026\u2026.\u2019\u201cI see. I\u2019m sorry, you were taking a bath.\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201dLuke eventually turned around without asking or confirming. The days of full-fledged agony for the Small Duke began.

Now that he decided to love her freely without reservations, everything Medea did looked adorably lovely in his eyes.\u201cOf course I know.\u201d\u201cThen you know we can\u2019t have sexual intercourse in the early stages of pregnancy, right?\u201d\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLyle\u2019s face cracked at her words as if lightning struck through a clear blue sky. Medea grinned.\u201cIt\u2019s for our baby. Your Majesty, will you safeguard us?\u201dLyle looked like his world had collapsed as Medea spoke with a smile.\u201cOh\u2014uh, uh, of course. For how long? Don\u2019t tell me we can\u2019t do it for all 10 months?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it for 3 or 4 months?\u201d\u2018I don\u2019t know for sure,\u2019 thought Medea.Lyle deliberated.\u201c4 months? Since you said it\u2019s been 3 weeks\u2026\u2026.\u201dSome answered that they had to abstain for almost three months and a week. Lyle became dizzy for a long moment just imagining it.\u201cA year ago, we weren\u2019t as close as we were these days. We\u2019ve only been close for little over a month.\u2026.\u201d [Medea]She couldn\u2019t help but be sheepish seeing Lyle so explicitly disappointed. It had only been less than two months since Lyle and her started to frequently sleep with each other.But Lyle didn\u2019t even pretend to hear her words.\u201cI need to check with the doctor!\u201d\u201dHe jumped up from his seat and left the room. Medea was left alone, speechless.\u201cI think I should protect my child.\u201dShe shook my head in disbelief and ordered a maid to bring more apple juice.***\u2018What does it have to do with me whether or not the baron is a woman or not? Let\u2019s not worry about it. She\u2019s simply someone my sister entrusted to me\u2026\u2026 The person I need to worry about is..\u2026.\u2019Luke was deeply troubled by his heightened misgivings.Even if Medea entrusted her to him, the baron was only a lord in the countryside at the edge of the empire. The heir of the dukedom did not need to be so concerned over a mere baron.However, since he discovered Seira was a woman there were several problems that plagued him.Firstly, there was the servant problem; there was no one to attend to her.Although Seira refused personal servants to avoid being caught, housekeepers frequently came and went in the name of assisting her. No matter how well Seira is good at locking the door, there would be a day when she would make a mistake because she was a person. If a housekeeper caught her while she was changing clothes or bathing\u2026\u2026.Servants of the ducal estate knew how to keep a secret but human nature was to serve one\u2019s self interest.Ample rumors circulated about the Barony of Hestia acquiring a large investment sum from the Empress in the near future. If there was an attendant who was aiming for the money, they could easily blackmail Seira using her disguise as a weakness..\u2026.\u2018What are you so concerned about, Luke Francis Card! Clear your mind!\u2019Luke was tormenting himself by imagining the 50,000 ways things could go wrong and attempted to hide from his worries by reviewing documents he had already processed again. It was a measure he took just in case he missed something while being preoccupied about something else. Fortunately, no mistake was found.\u2026. he really needed to stop thinking about the Baron, and clear her out his mind.Outside the window of the office, knights of the dukedom were training. Luke was alarmed when he spotted Seira, amongst the knights, doing drills.What if someone is suspicious of the Baron and interrogates \u2018him\u2019 to take off his clothes?Even the Knight Commander praised Seira\u2019s sincerity and talent, but such acclaim disturbed Luke even more.The more he watched her, the more she looked like a woman, not a slender man. He didn\u2019t know if his eyes were flawed or if everyone else had holes for eyes\u2014 but in Luke\u2019s eyes, she was a beautiful woman.\u201cDamn it.\u201dRather, Luke started to desperately wish that the Baron was a man. If that had been the case, he wouldn\u2019t have worried like this.***\u201c9 weeks\u2026\u201dThe doctor\u2019s answer was better than four months, but he advised not to have sex for nine weeks. Medea was only three weeks along, so there were six weeks left.A month and a half.Now he had to be celibate for a month and a half.\u2018Me?\u2019Would that be possible?It had already been a long time since he felt the joy of embracing Medea. Medea pointed out that they had only spent a little over a month getting close, but Lyle had already fallen in love with her.A thought occurred to him that couldn\u2019t live without touching Medea.\u2018A kiss would be fine but\u2026\u2026.\u2019Right. Kissing is okay. Hugging. Touching\u2026\u2026.Lyle unconsciously smiled cheerfully as he recalled Medea struggling under his hands and climaxing several times. Then\u2026\u2018\u2026..Can\u2019t we just not put it in?\u2019He wondered.Even if he put it in there, he didn\u2019t need to put it all in. He would just put in half of it.\u201cHalf\u2026 Is that possible?\u201dHe could do it, but it would be quite painful. It would be torturous holding it in and being so patient.\u201cI can\u2019t believe the day has come when I\u2019m worried about my sexual desires\u2026.\u2019However, he had no intention of embracing a woman other than Medea. It was irritating just imagining it.What Lyle wanted to see, touch and feel was Medea. He still felt other women were disgusting.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle, who was speculating about how to have fun without penetration, suddenly thought of Medea\u2019s ass. He wondered if it mattered if she was pregnant if they played there.\u2018I think Medea will resist a lot.\u2019Medea was now sensitive to Lyle\u2019s touch, but considering her preliminary temperament, the backlash towards such an approach would probably be formidable.\u2018For now, I\u2019ll have to think of another way.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are there any inconveniences\u2026\u2026.\u201d [Luke]Somehow, Seira felt burdened by Luke who started to eat every meal with her.Indeed, there was nothing strange about having meals with Luke since she was a guest. However, she was a minor lord in an isolated, rural, corner territory of the Silore region and Luke was a ducal heir and technically a count until he inherited his title as Duke.In other words, she wasn\u2019t important enough to pay attention to.\u201cI\u2019m eating well. I\u2019ve encountered no inconveniences because everyone is so hospitable.\u201dAs Seira pondered why he was interested in her, she concluded it was because he resembled the kind Empress inside and out as she studied his face.Luke was a really handsome young man. Not only was his light silver hair eye-catching, but also his dark blue eyes were astonishing. When she first saw him, she almost forgot herself and her manners and stared blankly.\u2018I\u2019m a man now, so it won\u2019t be weird if I look at him\u2014at least I\u2019ll have that peace of mind.\u2019When Seira first met the Empress, she had to stop herself from staring because she was so pretty\u2014reminding herself she was disguised as a man. But now it would be acceptable to stare and make eye-contact with a fellow man in this role.Luke was flustered by Seira, who began to gaze at him with sparkling eyes.\u2018Why \u2026\u2026..are you looking at me like a puppy? Is there something you want?\u2019Since Luke suspected that the baron was a woman, everything they did seemed feminine. Smooth blonde hair, charming light green eyes, and lips that looked like they would taste sweet when bitten.\u2018What if all of this is a misunderstanding\u2026\u2026.\u2019As they stared at each other Luke felt strange and turned his head. The butler hurriedly approached Luke.\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dWhen Luke asked, the butler spoke with a soft smile:\u201cIt\u2019s a message from the Duke. It seems that the Empress is with child.\u201d\u201cSister?\u201dSurprised Luke jumped up from his seat.Seira, upon unintentionally overhearing the conversation between the two, was also delighted. Everyone knew that the Imperial couple had been childless for a long time.\u201cThis is not the time to be idle! We must send a congratulatory gift right away!\u201d\u201cThe Duke feels the same way.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dLuke frowned and looked at the butler.The Duke Card\u2019s thoughts were conspicuous. It is clear that Medea would not meet with him even if congratulations were the order of the day, so he intended to send Luke, who she had called to the Palace recently.\u201cWell, I guess\u2026\u2026 Baron, excuse me, but I have leave first. Don\u2019t mind me and eat slowly.\u201d\u201cYes. Congratulations, Little Duke.\u201dLuke paused for a moment at the sight of Seira\u2019s tender big smile. Luke could tell how much she liked Medea and that softened his heart more than the empty elaborate words of aristocrats.\u201cUh, yes\u2026.\u201d\u201cPlease convey my congratulations to the Empress.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dFeeling like his face was about to heat up, Luke rushed out of the dining hall.For some reason the image of the Baron\u2019s smiling face kept squeezing into his mind which was filled with the thought of congratulating his sister.How come?***It was weird for Medea to realize she was pregnant and it made her quite uneasy, but being in Lyle\u2019s arms put her at ease. As soon as Lyle returned, Medea seemed to be bewildered and happy when she was in his arms.\u201cMillie?\u201d\u201cWhat did the doctor say?\u201dWould Lyle lie for the moment to lay with Medea?\u2026. Frankly, she wanted to. But she also genuinely wanted to test the Emperor.\u201cThey told me to be careful until you are nine weeks pregnant.\u201d\u201c9 weeks\u2026\u201dSheesh. It\u2019s short. Medea frowned with the desire to click her tongue.Sex with Lyle felt good but she wondered if it would still feel good when she got pregnant. Honestly, she figured sex during pregnancy would probably be annoying.\u201cShould we just do it?\u201dasked Lyle as he looked down at Medea. Medea freaked out.\u201cWhat? No! Your Majesty is already so big! It would be really dangerous!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have to put all of it in. Plus there are also ways to enjoy it without putting it in.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026. Why do you want to do that? We\u2019ve been working all day.\u2026 Aren\u2019t you tired of it?\u201dAt that moment, Lyle choked up.Tired? Did I hear it right? Did you just say you\u2019re tired of doing it with me?\u201cAre you already bored with me?\u201dAt the calm sad voice, Medea flinched.\u201cOh, no! It\u2019s not like that\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s it like then?\u201dMedea gulped as she was encircled in his arms, she tried to step back, but Lyle\u2019s arm was already wrapped around her waist.\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I \u2026\u2026.Y-Your Majesty, I\u2019m happy to make you feel good\u2026\u2026 for me, it\u2019s the same\u2026\u201d [t1v: she\u2019s confessing in a roundabout way \u201cLyle, you make me feel good\u201d]\u201cHuh?\u201dMedea glanced at the Lyle, her cheeks coloring.\u201cAren\u2019t you tired of me? I meant it like that.\u201dMedea\u2019s eyes that peeked up at him were so cute, Lyle already felt his lower body standing at attention.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve always been lacking\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe also wanted to be reckless.Medea couldn\u2019t believe the timing of her pregnancy. She was happy to be pregnant, but she wished she could have been pregnant a little later.\u2026.With a deep sigh, Lyle buried his face on Medea\u2019s neck. She realized that she had overcome the previous crisis.But what was with that sigh?\u201cYour Majesty?\u201d\u201cHaaaaa\u2026 How can we endure 6 weeks?\u201d\u201cWell?\u201dWhen Medea spoke, Lyle raised his head and pouted, lightly pinching Medea\u2019s cheek.\u201cIf you think I\u2019ll leave the Empress alone just because we can\u2019t have penerative sex, you are mistaken. There are ways to enjoy it without insertion and putting it in.\u201dLyle warned, but Medea smirked.\u201cAs long as it\u2019s not too much for the child, please do it.\u201d\u201cHa. *snicker*\u201dIt was clear that Medea\u2019s laughter stimulated Lyle\u2019s pride. With a furious face, Lyle laughed arrogantly.\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll do my best for the Empress.\u201d***There were many attendants who were overwhelmed with curiosity as to the reason why the Emperor suddenly ran out of the political meeting. Although some already knew about the Empress\u2019s pregnancy through spies, like Duke Card.Medea wanted to hide it until her pregnancy had stabilized, but the news had already spread throughout the capital. It was the work of the Duke of Card. Medea\u2019s position was not jeopardized by it, but the Duke wanted more power.Already, there was a line of families trying to win the Duke\u2019s favor. Many nobles knew the Emperor tolerated and pretended to be on good terms with the Duke but now the Emperor had fallen in love with the Empress. What hit the nail in the coffin was the announcement that he was now having children with her. People decided they could longer hold the Duke of Card at a distance.\u201cAre those all the presents you need?\u201dThe gift of five carriages was reduced to three carriages. It was because Medea hated unnecessary gifts.Luke thought perhaps it was because Medea was wary of the Emperor. But shouldn\u2019t it be a little different now since their relationship had reportedly improved?\u201cYes.\u201d [Luke]\u201cThose with fast information networks already sent gifts. Idoits\u2026\u2026. We don\u2019t have to overshadow them, but it\u2019s their fault they sent inferior gifts.\u201d [Duke]Because the Duke had to save face.The show of gifts would also be a measure of how much the Duke cared for Medea and, conversely, how good his relationship was with his daughter, the Empress.\u201cI know.\u201d [Luke]Rare silk, oils, tea brought from the East, and other carriages contained various treasures from Card Duke. Since the Imperial household was already rich, it would not have been easy to prepare gifts worthy of the Empress\u2014that is, if it wasn\u2019t from the Duke of Card.The presents sent were also to show off that the Duke of Card was different from other nobles. It was to reveal that his power and wealth was only second to the imperial family.\u201cGo ahead, don\u2019t forget to say hello to your sister.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Alright.\u201dLuke nodded, recalling the ruby necklace he received directly from the Duke.When Luke got on the wagon, the three of carriages with an escort of knights set off. The Knights were personnel to accompany the goods in the wagon.\u2018I hope my sister is happy.\u2019***\u201cHa-eung\u2026 haaaaa (Sighs)\u2026. I\u2014Surrender\u2026.\u201dMedea begged, spilling saliva. Her whole body trembled with pleasure.It was still in the early stages of pregnancy, so she didn\u2019t have to get an oil massage, but her body was covered with balm.\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d\u201cWhoo! Uhhh!\u201dA relentless hand crept between Medea\u2019s legs. Medea struggled, twisting her whole body. Because her two legs were held apart by Lyle\u2019s thighs they couldn\u2019t be closed.\u201cAh! No more\u2026\u2026 Ohhhhh mmm!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve only orgasmed six times.\u201dLyle chuckled and toyed with Medea\u2019s wet entrance. Lyle\u2019s thick and long fingers teased her clit and her g-spot, making her back tremble.\u201cRelax. My fingers are much shorter than my cock. It won\u2019t touch you too deeply inside.\u201dShe was so cute like this. He kneaded her weak spot with his fingertips.\u201cAhhh!\u201dMedea trembled, tightening around Lyle\u2019s fingers. She struggled to close her legs, but as Lyle held her legs wide open exposing her body.\u201cHmm\u2026 hmm mmhhnn huh\u2026\u2026. Ahhhhhhh\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too bad I can\u2019t fuck you like I usually do\u2026\u2026 but it\u2019s pretty fun to play with the Empress like this too. I can relish the remaining six weeks.\u201dHer back shook up and down as he touched her secret parts and talked. Lyle licked Medea\u2019s cheek as she moaned.\u201cHave you ever fainted from touching this place? It might have been hard to in the past, but\u2026\u2026 It may be possible because your body has become more sensitive.\u201d [t1v: pregnancy can increase libdo, sexual sensitivity and orgasms\u2014natural births can also induce orgasms *~the more you know~*]No \u2026..\u201cHiccup!\u201dBefore she could shake her head weakly, Lyle\u2019s fingertips lightly twisted her labia and clit. Lyle behind her back laughed as she struggled with pleasure.\u201cIt\u2019s not bad to watch you struggle either.\u2026.\u201dLyle\u2019s enlarged penis, fully erect, was now lying between Medea\u2019s asscheeks. On top of that [no pun intended], Lyle seemed to be stimulated whenever Medea struggled.\u201cIt\u2019s not as good as inside of you but\u2026\u2026 now that we have a child, we can\u2019t help it.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s my fault because I embraced you so much.\u2019After Medea gave birth, Lyle planned to place a magic tool in the Emperor\u2019s and Empress\u2019s room that would act as a contraceptive. Although it was said that it is good for the Imperial family to be blessed with many children, Lyle wanted to be careful because it was said that it would be too much for a woman to become pregnant one after another.\u201cOh! There\u2026\u2026 No\u2026\u201dMedea was embarrassed by the joy she got from Lyle oiled up fingers playing with her asshole. While one hand played with her clitoris and teased her wet flesh, the other hand\u2019s fingers lightly penetrated between her cheeks\u2014everything felt more vivid.\u201cI just adore this side of you, too. What are you expecting?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ahh, oh!\u201dHer body trembled as Lyle\u2019s fingers dug in trying to find her g-spot in her ass. Medea shook her head when his fingers stroked exactly where Medea enjoyed.\u201cAhh! Mm.. Ang! Your Majesty\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cLyle.\u201dHer reaction was as explicit as if the aphrodisiac used a long time ago also worked on her asshole. Lyle grinned when he saw Medea\u2019s eyes grow bigger.\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d\u201cOh my god!\u201dHer body jumped up as if it had been electrocuted.Lyle smiled and gently tapped on Medea\u2019s erotic place with his fingertips. Her eyes turned white as his oiled up fingers pushed against her inner tunnels.\u201cGasp! Ugh! At the same time..\u2026Ahhh!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see how many times you can climax. After washing, I\u2019ll lick you up.\u2026 So that you can recall what you are experiencing now and I can ask you which one you like better.\u201d\u201cOh! Huh, no we can\u2019t.\u2026.\u201d\u2018You\u2019re going to lick me later after doing this?\u2019She shook her head with a bright red face of disbelief, but Lyle moved his fingers, enthralled by watching Medea as if she were adorable.\u201cAh! Oh! Umm\u2026unn\u2026.Ugh\u2026.Oh!\u201d***The bed sheets were wet. It might have been caused by lavender oil that Lyle used or liquid spilled from Medea.Lyle kissed Medea as he fondled her breast. She was half out of her mind. It was endearing to him that Medea trembled and twitched whenever his fingertips brushed her pointed nipples.\u201c\u2026 It wasn\u2019t bad. This kind of abstinence is good, too.\u201d [t1v: abstinence?!?!]While Medea climaxed 28 times, Lyle orgasmed six times. He climaxed from stroking it on Medea\u2019s ass, grinding against her pubic area without entering her or stroking his length between her closed thighs.\u201cHaaaa\u2026 ha\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle licked her trembling lips and put his tongue back into Medea\u2019s mouth, Medea intertwined her tongue with Lyle\u2019s tongue. The sound of the water heated up his body, so Lyle kissed Medea for a long time while hugging her for a while.\u201cHaaa *sigh*\u2026\u201dLyle, who raised her head, carefully hugged Medea. It was a lovely sight to see Medea looking up at him with dreamy eyes. Lyle, who kissed her cheek, embraced Medea, lifted her and entered the bathroom together.If it was for a short time, this wouldn\u2019t be too bad either.\u2026. In the meantime, Lyle intended to discover all of Medea\u2019s erogenous zones.***\u201cAre these all gifts for the Empress from your Highness?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, the ducal heir.\u201d [Luke is confirming his identity]Typically, there was a person in the imperial palace who managed gifts. It would be problematic for officials to accept bribes in private, but it did not matter if they were for the Imperial family, so the nobles explicitly used to bribe the Imperial family.However, in the case of the Imperial family, bribery did not necessarily mean a request would be granted. The imperial family often considered it their natural right to receive such gifts.Lyle also put gifts in the national treasury, and there was no case of changing the policy just because he received a gift.\u2018But you\u2026\u2026.\u2019Medea also received many gifts during the time she became Empress. However, when it was revealed that she was not favored by the Emperor, the gifts dropped sharply to less than half.Until recently, only enough items came in to save face. But mainly gifts sent in consideration of the prestige of the Duke of Card.\u2018Is it different now?\u2019Medea wasn\u2019t one to be discouraged by the lack of gifts, but it was not being favored by the Emperor that pained her greatly.It was something to rejoice that her pain and weakness had been erased, but Luke was anxious because he was not sure if Medea was happy now.Just because the Emperor suddenly changed his mind and immersed himself in Medea like a boy experiencing his first love.\u2026. something felt suspicious and out of place to Luke.Most of the gifts sent to the Empress were gathered together and examined by wizards. It was their job to magically check whether the gifts were poisoned or bad for the fetus.Among them, the gifts of high-ranking aristocrats were separated and dealt with first. The same was true of Luke\u2019s gift. He was the younger brother of the Empress, so as soon as he arrived, his gifts were examined by magicians.Three carriages of gifts were carried into the Rose Hall of the Imperial Palace by the duke\u2019s servants.Officials who were classifying gifts that arrived for the Empress also looked at the incoming gifts as if they were surprised. Even if they were still in boxes, the boxes themselves were gorgeous and impressive enough to\u00a0 be considered a treasure on it\u2019s own.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Upon entering the Empress\u2019 palace, Luke glanced at the previous maid.\u201cIs his Majesty by the Empress\u2019s side?\u201d\u201cYes. Ever since his Majesty left the political affairs meeting.\u201dThe maid answered politely. Luke was lost in thought for a moment.\u201cHow is his Majesty? Does his Majesty care about her Majesty like the rumors say?\u201d\u201cHe cherishes her a lot. His Majesty is always by her Empress\u2019s side, except for when he steps aside to manage political affairs.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dIt was true then. Lyle didn\u2019t have a disposition where he could stay with someone he didn\u2019t like for a long time.\u201cWhat happened all of a sudden?\u2019It was good news for his sister, but Luke couldn\u2019t help but become worried because he knew that the Emperor was not a person who changed his mind so easily.Medea had long been the object of the Emperor\u2019s scorn and indifference. He couldn\u2019t imagine how hurt she would be if the Emperor rescinded his affection after she had tasted it\u2019s sweetness.\u2018I hope the Emperor is sincere.\u2019***\u201cYour Majesty the Emperor, your Majesty the Empress, the heir to the Duke of Card has arrived,\u201dannounced a handmaiden in front of the reception room of the Empress\u2019 palace. There seemed to be a drowsy voice from the inside, so the maids opened the door and stepped aside.\u201cYour Majesty the Emperor. Your Majesty the Empress. I greet you after a long time.\u201dAs the maid had told Luke, Lyle was next to Medea. He sat side by side with Medea and hugged her waist and made her lean on her. Luke was internally quite surprised by the unimaginable sight before him, but he greeted them as if he saw nothing.\u201cThis is a gift from the Duke of Card.\u201dWhen Medea beckoned with curiosity, Luke made the Duke\u2019s servants bring things.A box made of gold was first brought into the inside, and then a box made of platinum took over the room one after another. When Luke winked, the servants opened the box one by one.\u2018Oh my god\u2026 What\u2019s all this?\u2019Since morning, Medea had received gifts from high-ranking aristocrats. But none of them compared to the gifts from the Duke of Card.Luke watched with joy as Medea, who woke up from her seat, looked at the golden box with curious eyes.Lyle seemed to be vigilant. He hadn\u2019t even announced the pregnancy yet, but already they had found two gifts with poison. The \u2018gifters\u2019 had been caught. But Lyle was wary, he\u2019d rather be safe than sorry.Why had that happened?Lyle had never even been threatened since he had become Emperor.Medea had also an unshakable position because the Duke of Card was behind her. Trying to poison Medea now seemed to be a belated and poor attempt.Rather, it would have made more sense if the Medea had an assassination attempt against her after giving birth to a son. The Duke of Card could have come out as the guardian of the Crown Prince and it would have been a masterful maneuver to hold the empire in his hands.But it didn\u2019t make sense to kill Medea now. Why would he want to kill Medea now?\u2018Is it because you are favored by me?\u2019Until now, Medea had been wielding power in Card Duke\u2019s name, but had not the confident standing as an Empress. Of course, Medea had attempted to remedy that.\u201cRight\u2026 There were Medea\u2019s suicide attempts.\u201dThe first few accidents had vaguely raised his suspicions that someone might have been after her, as Medea had claimed.However, after that, it was revealed that Medea herself had fabericated those assassidenation threats, then she herself tried to commit suicide and made a fuss, so he had ignored it. Like the story of the boy who cried wolf.Lyle frowned at the sudden thought. Coincidentally, it was a story that could not be confirmed because Medea had amnesia.\u201cThank you for coming, Luke.\u201dAt Medea\u2019s word\u2019s, Luke\u2019s face flushed with joy.\u201cNo, thank you\u2014I\u2026 I wanted to see you again.\u201dMedea was relieved by Luke\u2019s response. After their last meeting she had guessed it would be right to address each other without titles and be on a first name basis. At least in the absence of other nobles.\u201cI heard that you have good news,\u201d he said, \u201cso I had come to convey my congratulations.\u201cOh. It\u2019s embarrassing to hear that from Luke.\u201d\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still in the early stages, so I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s changed because I\u2019m slow.\u201dWhat was the only notable change was that she had not menstruated. It was the significant reason why she had called a doctor.\u201c\u2026 Are these the only gifts you have? I think the Duke sent something else,\u201dAfter Lyle\u2019s words, Luke winked at the servant with a nervous look. The servant returned with a box engraved with the Duke\u2019s coat of arms. When Luke opened the lid, a large necklace with quail-sized rubies appeared.\u201cIt\u2019s a congratulatory gift from my father to His Majesty.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026 It\u2019s big\u2026\u2026.\u201dIn fact, the Empress Palace had tons of jewelry received at the Imperial wedding or inherited from the predecessor Empresses, but the current Medea did not even know they existed. Medea\u2019s eyes widened when the large jewel-studded necklace that belonged in a movie suddenly appeared.\u2018It\u2019s pretty, but\u2026\u2026 Does this go around a person\u2019s neck? I think it\u2019s going to be heavy.\u2019\u201cWould you like to try it on?\u201dLuke asked Medea, who could not be touched easily. Medea hesitated for a moment and then reached out to the necklace.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The large egg and the golden frame surrounding it and the diamonds embedded therein seemed to be of a formidable weight.\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll wear this because it\u2019s too much.\u2019It was pretty because of the gems. Lyle moved toward Medea to put it around her neck thinking she should try walking with it in consideration of the sincerity of the gift.\u201cI\u2019ll lock it for you.\u201dIt was certainly cold and heavy on her neck.\u2018It\u2019s pretty, but\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s heavy. Wearing a stuffy dress with a lot of gems would be a fantastic torture set.\u2019Medea, who lightly glanced at herself in the mirror brought by the maid, turned her back to Lyle.\u201cPlease untie it.\u201dAt that natural remark, Luke looked at Lyle.In fact it would have been natural to ask the maid to do it, it was not something she could say to the Emperor.But, as if it was normal, the Emperor took off the necklace from the neck of Medea!\u2018Are you two really getting along well?\u201d\u2019When Medea put the necklace in the original box, a maid approached and collected the box.\u201cTell the Duke thank you.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2026\u201dLuke paused and took a box the size of a palm out of his arms. It was a silver box. Luke hesitated, bowed and explained to Medea:\u201cThis is something I personally prepared. Would you like it?\u2026.\u201dMedea happily accepted it.\u201cMay I open it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen she opened the lid, a brooch with a purple mana stone was revealed. Lyle recognized at once that it was a magic artifact with a fairly powerful spell.Medea smiled broadly at it in the shape of a violet.\u201cOh, it\u2019s so pretty. I am touched.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it. It contains a spell that will protect your body, so don\u2019t take it off your body and carry it around.\u201d\u201cHow does it work?\u201dAt Lyle\u2019s question, Luke turned to the Emperor.\u201cI understand that it responds by itself to the owner\u2019s anxiety.\u201d\u201cWow~\u201dMedea looked at the brooch curiously. She knew there was magic in this world, but this was the first time she had actually received an object containing magic.Seeing Medea happy, Lyle smiled.\u201cSince the Empress seems to be happy, I should prepare a congratulatory gift, too. Since the Duke gave you a necklace and the Little Duke gave you a brooch\u2026\u2026 Should I give you a ring?\u201dAt Lyle\u2019s words, Medea smiled and said,\u201cThen how about a bracelet?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s from your Majesty, it would be a ring with a huge jewel. I won\u2019t be able to touch your Majesty\u2019s face with that on. You would get scratched by the gem. However, I have to carry what my Majesty gave me. So please give me a bracelet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal to scratch my face.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like your handsome face getting scratched.\u201dWhen Medea spoke eloquently, Lyle barely pinched her cheek and then caressed it.\u201cNow you know how to flatter\u2026\u2026. Good. I\u2019ll give you both a ring and a bracelet. You don\u2019t have to wear the ring. I also like it when the Empress touches my face.\u201dWhen Medea turned her head she pretended to bite Lyle\u2019s finger on her face, Lyle chuckled and hugged Medea.Luke, who was watching, opened his mouth. It wasn\u2019t acting, they looked really close. Although they were a married couple they behaved like intimate lovers.\u201cYou two\u2026 I feel reassured since you seem to be on good terms.\u201dAlthough his resentment towards Lyle had not yet been resolved, Luke was deeply relieved since it had been so long that Medea had yearned for Lyle\u2019s love.Lyle coughed when he realized that his usual actions came out in front of the duke\u2019s heir without realizing it. However, he did not release his arm that had hugged Medea.\u201cAh, yes. I-indeed\u2026\u2026.\u201dDiscreetly, Medea tried to push away Lyle\u2019s arm around her waist, but instead she was pulled into Lyle\u2019s arms, who was disgruntled.Medea whispered, her face flushed,\u201cLuke is watching!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the younger brother of the Empress. Is this a big deal? I didn\u2019t even touch it.\u201d\u201cIf you touch me in front of people, I won\u2019t talk to you for a month!\u201dLyle smirked at her warning. Was that an actual threat? Of course, the threat was very\u2026\u2026 It wasn\u2019t inconceivable.\u201cI, I hugged you, I did not touch you.\u201dThen, he downcasted his eyes and kissed Medea on the cheek. Lyle smiled with a brazen face as Medea stared at him in surprise.\u201cIf you look at me like that, I want to kiss you\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea quickly covered Lyle\u2019s mouth with her hands. Lyle stared at Medea. As she was not going to put down her hand.\u201cAhem.\u201dLuke cleared his throat, amidst the embarrassing situation.Lyle still held her hand. When Medea slapped his arm wrapped around her waist, he belatedly released her arm with a displeased face.Medea looked at Luke as if nothing had happened, but she was also embarrassed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is he training hard?\u201dWhen Medea asked about Seira, Lyle\u2019s face turned pale and twisted. Luke glanced at Lyle and replied to Medea,\u201cHe is doing well and training well, too.\u201dWhile he was here, Luke had wanted to ask about the Baron\u2019s secret, but couldn\u2019t because Lyle was next to her.If the Baron was a woman and Lyle didn\u2019t know, she could have been severely punished for deceiving the Emperor, introductions had already been made.\u2018Will my stomach be big by the time she takes the knights exam\u2026.?\u2019Medea smiled at Lyle, not seemingly knowing his disgruntiness or taking note of his sullen expression. Lyle felt relief at her smile.\u2018Are you upset whenever I talk about Seira?\u2026. There\u2019s no way the two of them will have an affair.\u2019All that\u2019s left is Luke, the male sub character.Medea glanced at Luke\u2019s face. Luke was studying the Emperor and his wife, who looked a lot more fond of each other with a complicated yet happy expression.\u2018Will Seira and Luke get along? If it goes well, I think it would be good for Luke.\u2019Due to the production of manastones on her land, Seira quickly rose from a peasant to a wealthy young lady with a large dowry. Still, many people may say that she was not qualified to become a queen or a duchess.\u2026 At least she thought that being on the duke\u2019s side she would not be severely harassed.\u2018The original storyline has changed a lot, so I don\u2019t know if Luke knows Seira is a woman in disguise.\u2019In the novel, it was only Lyle who noticed that Seira was a woman at the beginning. Luke found out long after when Seira was injured and tried to treat her. She hadn\u2019t even taken the knight\u2019s test yet, so the event\u2026\u2026.\u2018Maybe it won\u2019t happen? That\u2019s what happens when a neighboring empress comes and makes a mess. Is the Luke route going to get lost because of me?\u2019Since Medea was alive, there will be no empress from a neighboring country who comes to propose to Lyle. Therefore, there will be no events where Seira is bullied by the empress. She would never get hurt trying to save the bitchy empress.At that moment, Medea felt guilty. She felt as if she not only took Lyle away from Seira but had also blocked off Luke\u2019s route.\u2018No. But I saved her brother\u2019s life! It\u2019s better that her brother is alive than love! You two were on good terms\u2026\u2026.\u2019Even if Medea had to apologize to Seira, she didn\u2019t want to give up Lyle anymore. Didn\u2019t Lyle belong to the Empress, Medea, anyway? Now that she was Empress, Lyle was hers.Medea gently clasped Lyle\u2019s hand and looked at Luke.\u201cBe nice to Baron Hestia. It\u2019s not easy to leave one\u2019s hometown and prepare for the exam.\u201d\u201cI understand, your Majesty.\u201dLuke nodded thoughtfully.Lyle showed a subtle complaint, but was relieved by hugging Medea. For some reason, she did not push Lyle away this time, so Lyle smiled satisfied.***In the end, he couldn\u2019t ask.On his way back, Luke\u2019s mind was full of thoughts concerning the Baron as he sat in the carriage.Seeing the way the Emperor had treated his sister, he didn\u2019t think he had to worry anymore. Perhaps that\u2019s why his thoughts kept tilting toward the Baron.\u2018I can\u2019t openly ask\u2026\u2026.\u2019He couldn\u2019t act rudely and check to confirm. It would be a big deal if she was really a woman. He thought about having a maid take a peek, but her secret would leak out.\u201cI\u2019m at a loss.\u201dWhy should he keep worrying about the Baron\u2019s secret?In other words, there was no reason for Luke to care so much even if she was really a woman. If her identity was discovered, she might be the cause of slight criticisms toward his sister who brought her to the capital, but she was currently pregnant, so it would have been easy to move on.Baron Hestia, who deceived the Emperor, could be taken to prison.\u2018Even if you pass the exam, it is unreasonable to live in a knight\u2019s residence. Are you pretending to be a man because you want to test and prove your abilities?\u2019Luke just guessed that much. It could mean a lot in the current situation where women could not be knights. Perhaps she had always heard that she was inferior to men, so she wanted to test her skills at least once.Revealing her identity would be a nuisance to the young lady\u2019s other family members.\u2026.\u2018She\u2019ll just pass the test and go home.\u2019And she would return to her life as a young noblewoman.Luke knew that Baron Hestia had a sister. He had heard that the two looked exactly alike, so he assumed that the two might have switched identities.\u2018This has not been proven either, so it\u2019s just my hypothesis.\u2019It was not appropriate to spend time on fantasies that had no practicalities behind them. Luke frowned with an annoyed expression and looked out the window.The carriage was approaching the duke\u2019s residence.\u201cDucal heir, you\u2019ve arrived?\u201dSeira, dressed lightly, greeted Luke as she came down the stairs. She was wearing a white shirt and pants with lace.\u2018She must have taken a bath after training\u2026\u2026.\u2019Gazing at her glowing and pinkish skin, his mouth went dry. Luke quickly turned his head to hide his burning cheeks.\u201cAre you done with your practice?\u201d\u201cYes, I was just resting. How was the Empress?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s happy. She didn\u2019t forget to ask after you. Please\u2026 Don\u2019t do anything that would disappoint the Empress.\u201d\u201cI will do my best.\u201dNoticing the Baron\u2019s sad expression, which seemed bleak and pained, Luke became embarrassed. His guess seemed to be true.\u2018If it\u2019s true, I\u2019m going to protect her from getting caught as my sister asked.\u2026 But what does this feeling mean?\u2019\u201c\u2026I\u2019m tired. You go up and rest as well.\u201d\u201cYes, Little Duke.\u201dAs she stepped aside, Luke inhaled as he passed by the Baron. The Baron, who had just finished bathing, smelled of fragrant flesh.Was she a man?Can a man smell like that?Feeling confused, Luke glanced at Baron. The white thin neck was dazzling.\u2018Fuck.\u2019Luke quickly turned his head, strode up to his room. No matter what he did, his shaking heart couldn\u2019t calm down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The size of the hallway and the air that touched his skin were different from usual. It felt a little twisted and muffled. As it usually was in dreams.\u2018Where am I going?\u2019The steps Luke was taking were getting faster and faster. The darkness came through the window, so it seemed to be night.All halls in the mansion were almost the same, but Luke recognized where he was at a glance.It was the guest room bestowed to the baron.\u2018Why am I here\u2026.\u2019The door was half open. He had intended to pass by, but his feet stopped in front of the guest room because it was a dream. The sound of water had leaked through the open door.\u2018This\u2026\u2019A soft song was coming from the bathroom. It was the voice of a woman. It was not the false deep voice of a man\u2019s, but a thin humming.As if he were memorized and led by the sound, Luke walked into the room. Curtains were drawn on all the windows, but the bathroom door was half open. Just as the bedroom door was.\u2018It\u2019s a dream\u2026 This isn\u2019t reality.\u2019Even though he told himself it wasn\u2019t real, Luke was overcome with curiosity. He wanted to see how beautiful Baron Hestia was in her woman form.After stepping on the thick carpeted floor, Luke crossed the bedroom. He couldn\u2019t even hear his footsteps because it was a dream.The soft humming melody had stopped and there was a sound of water. Seira Hestia had seemed to raise herself from the bathtub.There was also a tinted window in the bathroom of the guest room. However, it had been treated glass so that you could not look inside from the outside. Seira\u2019s naked body seemed to glow and shine in the sunlight coming through the window.\u2018Haa\u2026\u2019Luke sighed quietly as he stared at Seira\u2019s nude body. Looking at her smooth white skin, thin waist, and voluminous and well-shaped breasts, Luke reminded himself that this was a dream.\u2018This is not reality. So\u2026.\u2019He should not be confused by a fantasy when he wakes up. There was a difference between dreams and reality. This was just a dream that showed what Luke was suspicious of. It wasn\u2019t the truth.Seira from the bathtub took out a towel on the shelf and wrapped it around her body. The appearance of her wet hair sticking to her skin was alluring.Luke approached the bathroom door as if possessed. Luke, who was mesmerized and looking at it, suddenly realized Seira\u2019s eyes were meeting his own. Seira, surprised and eyes wide, clasped the towel that was hiding her body.\u201cH-heir?\u201dSeira, who was stepping back, dropped the towel.Even if it was a dream, Luke was not brazen enough to openly gawk at her like this. Luke, who turned his head and took his eyes off Seira\u2019s appearance, turned his back completely.\u201cHeir! Hey, please wait!\u201dHe had heard Seira\u2019s voice, but Luke didn\u2019t wait. After striding across the guest room and leaving the room, he shut the door. He felt dizzy.\u2018It\u2019s just a dream.\u2019Luke, who took his hand off the door handle, opened the door as soon as he tried to move. Looking back, the naked Seira reached out and grabbed his hem.\u201cHestia\u2019s young\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe looked around the hallway with a puzzled countenance. Fortunately, no one passed by.\u201cWhat are you doing\u2026! It\u2019s dangerous.\u201dBut Seira pulled Luke\u2019s arm.Luke entered her room, led by Seira\u2019s hand, fearing that someone would see her like this.Click.When the door was closed, Seira reached out and locked the door.\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201dEven before Luke finished speaking, her soft lips pressed down on Luke\u2019s lips. Seira spoke with a blush on her cheeks,\u201cHeir\u2026 I\u2019ve been wanting to do this for long time.\u201dWhat?\u201cLa\u2014lady\u2026.\u201dSeira\u2019s slender arms wrapped around Luke\u2019s neck as he was about to retreat. Embarrassed by her nude body pressing up against him tightly, Luke hesitated.\u201cYou like me, too.\u201dUnable to bring himself to reciprocant her embrace Luke could only blush in response. Even though I knew it was a dream, he was bashful and dazed.\u201cYoung lady\u2026 that\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou always look at me with those eyes\u2026\u2026 I know.\u201dSeira\u2019s hand slipped into Luke\u2019s shirt. Feeling dizzy, Luke couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Seira\u2019s face even though he thought he felt so overwhelmed he wanted to close his eyes tightly.\u201cWhat\u2026 oh\u2014t-there\u2019s a misunderstanding\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cLies.\u201dThe hand caressing Luke\u2019s hard chest traveled down and slid into his pants. Seira\u2019s hand clasped Luke\u2019s desire that was fiercely and frighteningly standing up.The woman\u2019s fingers wrapped around his penis were supple and soft.\u201cYou\u2019re already like this.\u201d[t1v: welp\u2014do you think it\u2019s a dream?]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if the baron wasn\u2019t the real baron, but the baron\u2019s sister and young lady of the house, Seira, she would never do that.\u00a0I don\u2019t have any intention to do \u2018it\u2019\u2026.\u00a0[t1v: surreeee]\u201cWhat if the Baron isn\u2019t a woman\u2026.?\u2019Seira\u2019s body, which he had held in his arms in his dream, was soft and lovely.

Why does that matter\u2026.?\u2019Whether they were the baron or the baron\u2019s sister, it was none of his business.\u00a0I can\u2019t believe I had such a dream.\u2026.\u2018Is it because of my surpressed libdo?\u2019Luke got up and went into the bathroom.Even while taking off his clothes and washing himself in cold water, he couldn\u2019t shake the image of Seira from his dream.\u2018\u201dYou always look at me with those eyes\u2026\u2026 I know.\u201d\u2019When he remembered how she had looked at him with those provocative eyes, his body became hard. Luke reached out to his desire as he recalled Seira\u2019s soft touch.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dFinally, he came, but his heart felt no relief. Luke sighed deeply, with a heated face.***Displeasure was written all over his face. Both maids and attendants bowed and unhurriedly disappeared when they saw Luke\u2019s expression. Not in the frame of mind or mood to face the Baron, Luke even ordered that his meal be brought to his room and ate it.There was something he had to check downstairs before he went to the office. As Luke made his way towards the stairs, he stopped when he spotted the baron also heading towards the stairs.The Baron, completely ignorant of Luke\u2019s feelings, noticed Luke and greeted him brightly:\u201cGood morning, Little Duke.\u201dIt was his usual greeting, Luke glanced at the Baron with an uncomfortable look. Even though it was just a greeting, his face was heating up.\u201cRight\u2026 Good morning. Baron.\u201dHis outfit reflected his intention of going straight to the training field. Luke looked at the geared out Baron and when an idea came to him.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult today. Aren\u2019t your muscles tense and sore?\u201cYes. That\u2019s true but\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s something I have to deal with.\u201dLuke stared intently at the baron, who looked neat and tidy as always. Their annoying beautiful appearance irritated him.\u201c\u2026\u2026come to my room as soon as you finish training.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dLuke glanced at the Baron\u2019s startled face, and said:\u201cI\u2019m saying this because I know how to loosen up tight muscles. [t1v: wink wink] If you had a servant, I would teach him, but you are reluctant of servants entering your room. So I\u2019ll teach you in person.\u201d\u201cAhhh\u2026.. I understand. Then\u2026\u201dWith her anxiety hidden, the Baron passed through the hall and left the mansion. Luke watched the Baron walk away with a troubled expression.***\u201cSigh, ha, ahh\u2026. Your Majesty\u2026 Please\u2026 Uh, oh my\u2026\u2026.\u201dHer blam-soaked breasts were squeezed in Lyle\u2019s hands. He licked her earlobe, kneading Medea\u2019s breasts like dough.\u201cI heard that having children impacts your sex life. It would be good to prevent it in advance.\u201d\u201cAngh, ngh\u2026\u2026 the due date is still, unn\u2026.. a long time\u2026 Ahh! Oh no\u2026\u2026. eugh\u2026.\u201dLyle put his tongue into Medea\u2019s ear and twisted her sensitive nipples. Medea twisted her body when his fingertips pinched and rolled up and down the protrusions with the slippery oil.\u201cNnagh\u2026unn\u2026. Your Majesty, stop\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cRight. It must feel empty here.\u201dHis fingers that skimmed down her belly, lovingly caressed the wide-open secret part of Medea. Her thighs which were held apart by Lyle\u2019s knees, trembled.\u201cI\u2019m dying to push myself inside too\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHuek, I\u2026\u2026 Something like that\u2014 No! Ah\u2026. Ahhhh\u2026\u2026!\u201dHis fingers, which had caressed her petals soaked in oil, penetrated deeply. Familiarly and skillfully, he thrusted Medea with her favorite teasing spot.\u201cHuh? What did you say?\u201d\u201cHhngh! Ah! Ahhh!\u2026. you can\u2019t\u2026. Ahh!

Today, he wanted to find out how far she could go.\u201cI\u2019ll make you sticky. By the time it\u2019s over, you might beg you to put it in.\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, no\u2026\u2026. Ah, not yet\u2026\u2026. Ahhuek!\u201dMedea trembled and shivered under the tips of his sweetly teasing hands. The two legs pressed under Lyle\u2019s knee twitched and her toes curled.\u201cSo cute, Milly\u2026\u2026. My lovely Empress\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAhhunn, AAhh\u2026.\u2026. Oh!

There was someone listening to erotic sounds that reached the ceiling with a door in between.Knowing the Emperor was a Sword Master, and that he sensed him. He acted like a servant pretending to notice the signs and quickly moved away from the door.I don\u2019t think I can do it today.Judging by the atmosphere, it looked like they would be together all day.He bit his lips in anxiety. He couldn\u2019t wait indefinitely. If he delayed to the next date, he might be misunderstood as being suspicious.He might already have been suspected since he had to change shifts with other courtiers.He was preoccupied with figuring out a way\u2014A time when the Empress was alone\u2026\u2026.The Emperor would be absent when he had to attend political affairs meetings.

Seira went up to her room with a deep sigh. How could the Duke\u2019s heir teach her how to relax her muscles? She wondered if there was any motive.Seira was pretending to be Ian, her older brother. It would be suspicious if she, known as a man, was reluctant to go to the Small Duke\u2019s room.\u2018You didn\u2019t notice something, did you? No way\u2026 I don\u2019t think so.\u2019Seira hurriedly took off her armor and left the room. She should have polished her armor instead of leaving it as it is, but she couldn\u2019t keep Luke waiting. Seira completed training at the same time every day, so Luke would be waiting for her.With the help of a servant, Seira arrived in front of Luke\u2019s room. She carefully knocked on the door.Knock knock\u2026\u201c\u2026come in.\u201dWhen Seira came in, Luke, who was sitting by the window, put down the book and came down from the window sill.\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cI came as soon as my training was over\u2026\u2026 My sweat smells terrible.\u2026. so, is it okay if I wash up?\u201dLuke looked at Seira without answering. The appearance of sweaty hair sticking to her skin strangely attracted his eye.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, it\u2019ll be over soon. Come here and sit.\u201dLuke pointed at the carpet on the floor. Seira was relieved he didn\u2019t order her to sit on a bed.As instructed, she walked to the middle of the room and sat down on the carpet. When Luke approached and sat next to Seira, she looked at him with wary eyes.\u201cYou\u2019ve been training in armor every day, so you must have bruised yourself, right?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 If I soak it in hot water, it\u2019ll heal quickly! There\u2019s nothing to worry about!\u201dSeira spoke hastily, afraid he would fetch her a healer. If the healer arrived and asked her to take off her clothes, her identity would be exposed.\u201cReally?\u201dLuke stretched Seira\u2019s arms and rubbed the area where muscles were likely to knot up. When Seira shrank in pain, Luke adjusted his strength.\u201cYou have a lot of knots and muscles clumping up.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not knots, it\u2019s muscle mass\u2014 arm strengthening\u2026\u2026. Argh!When he focused on massaging the lumped part, a scream erupted out of her mouth. Luke smiled and gently released Seira\u2019s arm, who had become teary due to pain.\u201cIsn\u2019t that too much pain for not-a-knot?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 I-I\u2019m just surprised\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s because I\u2019m aching\u2026\u2026. Huek!Seira\u2019s sound effects increased while accompanying his action of pressing down on her knots again. Luke chuckled, let go of her left arm, and went over to her right arm.Rather, the frequently used arms had less muscle clumps.\u201cUgnh\u2026 You don\u2019t have to\u2026\u2026 no\u2026 Hmm\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre you not able to maintain your body because you don\u2019t have an attendant? As a son of a nobleman, I would ask my servant to do this\u2026\u2026. Do you still have no thoughts of being served by a servant?\u201d\u201cYes, um\u2026 Argh! Cough Ha!\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeira\u2019s body was firm and resilient. It was a different feeling from the soft and supple bodies of ordinary girls. But as expected\u2026\u2026 Hers was unlike the firm body of the man, Luke became convinced.\u201cNow I\u2019ll do your legs.\u201d\u201cN-no! I don\u2019t need legs!\u201dLuke gently stepped down. He couldn\u2019t forcefully touch her legs when he was already convinced that the baron was a woman.\u201cThen now\u2026 Why don\u2019t you tell me why you came all the way to the capital and dressed up as a man? Lady Seira Hestia?\u201dAt Luke\u2019s words, Seira\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cW-What are you talking about\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf not, would you like to take off your top? I apologize if I made a mistake.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeira, turning white, lowered her gaze while grabbing the front of her shirt. The gesture itself seemed to be enough evidence.Luke sighed deeply. It was simple enough to figure this out but inside his stomach boiled and he felt pathetic.\u201cFortunately, it\u2019s only myself and the Empress who noticed. I don\u2019t know what made you do this, but\u2026\u2026 You dressed up as a man in front of his Majesty, so if your identity is discovered later, it will become a big deal.\u201d\u201cWas the Empress disappointed with me?\u201dIt was a woman\u2019s voice that asked, not Seira\u2019s artificially deeper voice. Feeling a shiver run through his nerves, Luke avoided her gaze.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t disappointed.\u201dRather, she seemed to be worried that Luke would be angry with Seira when she was caught.\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to cause trouble! It\u2019s just that the knights from the capital don\u2019t notice me at all.\u2026.\u201dSeira told the story of how she took off Ian\u2019s clothes and dressed her fainted brother in her own clothes in order to save him. She fought off the assassins sent by their uncle. Sir Gerrard and his party arrived and saved them just in time and did not recognize that Seira disguised as a man.\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was planning on going back to my territory as soon as I passed the test. I can\u2019t keep pretending to be my older brother.\u201dSeira only tried to achieve her dream for a few days. It would have been the shortest days of her life once she was a knight, but she thought it was an opportunity to achieve her dream that she had secretly held in her heart.\u00a0Even if it\u2019s just a few days\u2026\u2026.\u201cMy brother is innocent. It was me who insisted and came up to the capital. So please\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeira grabbed and held on to the edge of his clothes, so Luke swallowed his breath and turned his head.\u201cI-I\u2019ll keep your secret. The Empress also\u2026 From the beginning she didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of divulging the miss\u2019s secret of, so you can rest assured.\u201d\u201cTh\u2014then\u2026\u2026.\u201dLuke shook his head at the Emerald eyes filled with anticipation.\u201cIt\u2019s too risky to participate in the knight\u2019s examinations. Miss, perhaps like me\u2026\u2026 Some people will notice that you are a woman. If that happens not only will the lady be in trouble but also our dukedom and Empress could be in trouble.\u201dComing up to the capital dressed up as a man and participating in the Knight\u2019s exams were two different things. Attending the Knight\u2019s test and worse\u2014being knighted under a false identity\u2014would be seen as deceiving the Emperor and everyone else.\u201cUgh\u2026 How did the ducal heir find out? Sir Gerrard didn\u2019t even notice.\u201dIn fact, Luke wouldn\u2019t have guessed if Medea hadn\u2019t suggested it. However, Luke decided to be firm.\u201cAnyone could realize it. You\u2019re so beautiful, there was no way I couldn\u2019t know.\u2026.\u201dLuke realized what he was saying candidly\u2014 almost biting his unguarded tongue and shut his mouth abruptly.\u201cOh, anyway, send Baron Hestia a letter to send a carriage. You\u2019re going back as soon as the carriage arrives.\u201dLuke got up from his seat and offered his hand to Seira. She jumped up on her own without holding on to his hand.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to pretend you don\u2019t know anyways, please pretend you don\u2019t know for a few more days!\u201d\u201cLady!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only been a few months. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to stay in the capital as a knight.\u2026 It\u2019s only been a few days!Luke clicked his tongue in Seira\u2019s face, who seemed to heat up in\u00a0 anger. In the midst of this, he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her face\u2014he was sure he was going crazy.\u201c\u2026\u2026If the miss doesn\u2019t send a letter, I\u2019ll contact the Baron. Please leave now.\u201dLuke turned his back as if he didn\u2019t want to talk anymore and the topic was final.When Seira saw Luke\u2019s red-stained ears, she realized:\u00a0He has a crush on me.\u201cEven if a carriage arrives I won\u2019t go back. If you want to leave the Duke\u2019s mansion, I\u2019ll look for an inn!\u201d\u201cMiss, if you come out like that, I won\u2019t be able to hide the young lady\u2019s secret.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that if it\u2019s known that I dressed up as a man, the dukedom would also be in trouble?\u201d\u201cIf we denounce the miss first before you are caught, then we won\u2019t be blamed.Seira was taken aback by Luke\u2019s response. Since the Empress had agreed to hide it, she thought if she left he wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it if the lady doesn\u2019t go back calmly.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t do that. I can leave the Duke\u2019s estate! No one but the Small Duke noticed anyway.\u2026.\u201dLuke was annoyed by Seira\u2019s stubbornness.\u201cIt\u2019ll be too late when someone notices!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m confident that I won\u2019t get caught! They\u2019ll never find out!\u201dShe was a woman who had protected her sick brother alone against assassins. Luke didn\u2019t think the argument that the Knight\u2019s test was too difficult would work on her.Luke frowned and clenched his teeth.\u201cWhy should I grant the lady such a favor? Why are you being so difficult?\u201cCough\u2026.\u201dAlready the Empress and the Duke of Card were assisting the Hestia Barony. Even Seira knew that she was being shameless and rude to wish for more.But she simply didn\u2019t want to miss this opportunity.It would happen only once in a lifetime.\u201cI-I\u2019ll do anything! I\u2019ll repay you somehow!\u201dLuke\u2019s eyes were shaken by Seira\u2019s words.\u201cWhat kind of reward can the lady give to me?\u201dAs the heir to the Duke of Card, he was a man who had everything. Although he was only second to the Emperor, he had power, money, and status comparable to that of the Emperor.But he didn\u2019t laugh at her. Seira heistated at Luke\u2019s words as he looked at her with a frown.What\u2026Seira grabbed Luke\u2019s collar, pulled him close and covered his lips with hers.Unlike the fluffy lips in his dream, it felt a little dry, but it was hot and soft.Luke\u2019s startled face turned a bright red.T-this lady\u2026. I\u2019ve been holding it in so far!Luke\u2019s trembling eyes glared at Seira, alarmed by what she had done.\u201cUh, well\u2014\u201dSuddenly, Luke\u2019s lips rushed in and pressed down against Seira\u2019s lips and swallowed them.Luke\u2019s arm circled around her waist and while his other hand supported her head, making it impossible to even turn her head.\u201cHmm, oh\u2026\u2026hnnn\u2026..\u201dLuke\u2019s tongue came in every time she opened her lips, tenaciously coveting the insides of Seira\u2019s mouth.From the root of her tongue to the inside of her cheeks, to the gums and the ceiling of her mouth, the tip of Luke\u2019s tongue flirted in her mouth, causing Seira to leak spit.Luke thought even Seira\u2019s saliva tasted sweet as both of them became dizzy. His blood was boiling all over his body and he felt he was about to burn.As he gazed into Seira\u2019s fluttering eyes, their breathing was heated, panting, Seira blinked slowly.Luke slowly removed his lips with a rough breath.\u201cThis kind of thing\u2026 you want to do it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Luke was still embracing Seira\u2019s waist and supporting the back of her head.Tears sprouted in Seira\u2019s eyes as she shouted in indignation:\u201cI- I\u2026 I was talking about a date!\u201cOh.\u201dAs expected, she didn\u2019t mean to offer her body. He was expecting that.Luke said with a languid smile.\u201cBut you kissed me. Isn\u2019t this the lady\u2019s first kiss?\u201dA smile crept across Luke\u2019s face at her startled glance.Because of his teasing laughter, he saw a fire spark in Seira\u2019s eyes. This appearance of hers was also very striking.Ah\u2026 I\u2019ve failed. I can\u2019t escape it now.Luke resigned himself and pushed his lips back onto her lips. Surprised, Seira did not think twice about hitting his arm and kicking him in the leg. He should get bruised. He felt like he\u00a0 couldn\u2019t help it even if Seira broke his arms and legs.Luke coveted her softened wet lips, to his heart\u2019s content. Although his tongue came into her mouth and wrapped around her tongue, Seira hesitated to bite his tongue. It implied to him that she allowed him to some extent, arousing him.\u201cHaaa\u2026.. Ummm\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhen his lips finally fell off hers with a wet sound, Seira glared at Luke with tears in the corner of her eyes. Luke kissed her eyes, feeling like his heart was being squeezed.\u201cHaaa *Sigh*\u2026 Lady Hestia.\u201d\u201cW-why are you doing this?\u201d\u201cBecause the lady took my first.\u201dSeira recalled that she had first lightly kissed his mouth and lamented.\u201cThen, l-let\u2019s go on a date\u2026\u2026.\u201d [Seira]\u201cThis humble servant, what I mean to say\u2026.\u201d [t1v: although Seira addresses Luke respectfully\u2014Luke has always addressed her even\u00a0more\u00a0respectfully, even though he is higher in status, age and a man. It infers how much he cherishes her.]As Luke spoke, his timber sounded as if he was in pain. He smiled. Then, a feathery kiss fell on her forehead and hair.\u201cI am yours, Lady Hestia. Please marry me.\u201dAt that moment, her heart dropped. Seira blinked and blankly stared at Luke. Luke studied her expression with a gaze that would not miss a single thing.\u201cNo, don\u2019t make fun of me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen the lady returns, I\u2019ll go down with a marriage proposal.\u201dLuke released Seira\u2019s body, which he had been hugging, and knelt down in front of her. He held Seira\u2019s hands with both hands and kissed the back of her hand. She was stunned.\u201cLady Seira Hestia\u2026\u2026. My body and heart already belong to you. Please\u2026 \u2026. take pity on me\u2026\u2026 Please marry me.\u201dSeira was utterly speechless. Her identity had been discovered, they had been arguing over whether or not she needed to go back to the barony, and then this\u2014Out of nowhere!\u201cI-if you say this, so suddenly\u2026\u2026 I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u201cWhat can I do so you\u2019ll trust me?\u201dShe turned around and pressed against her beating heart. She was suddenly kissed, but she was just as surprised that she had done something first\u2014and even more so surprised that she wasn\u2019t offended.Earlier and currently\u2014 instead of being displeased, her heart was pounding, thrilled.\u201cPlease close your eyes to allowing me to participate in the Knight\u2019s test\u2026.\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not possible.\u201dWhen Luke answered immediately, she pouted. As he shyly glanced at her lips, Seira looked back at him suspiciously.\u201cIs it because you already kissed me to your heart\u2019s content?\u201d\u201cAs did the lady.\u201dAt Luke\u2019s smug words said with a smile, her face heated up to her earlobes.\u201cI- I didn\u2019t do that! There! Why did the ducal heir do it twice?\u201d\u201cI thought I was the lady\u2019s first kiss\u2026\u2026 I wanted to be your second kiss too. I apologize.\u201dLuke\u2019s shameless words made Seira speechless.He was still kneeling in front of her and kissing her fingertips, so Seira quickly pulled her hand away. Luke stood up with a disappointed expression.\u201c\u2026\u2026If the lady returns to her territory, I will advise His Majesty and the Empress to allow women to participate in the knight\u2019s examination.\u201dIf his sister knew her identity and had him sponsor her so she could take the Knights\u2019 test, it was clear that she was in favor of Seira\u2019s actions. If his sister persuaded the Emperor, wouldn\u2019t the Emperor would accept it?\u201cA-Are you serious?\u201d\u201cYes. However I\u2019m not promising it will change right away. There\u2019s no guarantee of success.\u2026. But.\u201dSeira avoided Luke\u2019s nearing gaze.She couldn\u2019t help but be shaken by his words that he would do that for her.\u201c\u2026\u2026If the lady becomes my wife and stands by me, my claim will be stronger when I argue for it.\u201dPlease, do you agree?Luke whispered sweetly in Seira\u2019s ear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Medea remembered it because it reminded her of a famous horror movie \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby.\u201d [t1v: lawl wat.]The Empress, Medea, is alive, so Emilia can\u2019t propose to Lyle, and Rosemary shouldn\u2019t appear either, but why\u2026\u2026.\u2018Will I be in danger instead of Emilia?\u2019Emilia was saved by the main character Seira, but now there was no Seira next to her. Because it\u2019s before the knight\u2019s test. Emilia originally appeared after the knight\u2019s examination.\u201cEmpress?\u201dThe handmaiden asked since Medea\u2019s reaction was strange. Medea came to her senses and looked at Rosemary. She quickly greeted her:\u201cMy name is Rosemary, Empress.\u201cYes. You are Count Laurent\u2019s daughter\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dIn the novel, Rosemary was not a very likable character. She was a character who flirted with the male protagonist, Lyle.\u201cHmm. I don\u2019t intend to place new faces next to me right now.\u201dAs Medea spoke, she became flustered. The maid quickly explained further:\u201cThis young lady was recommended by Marquess Bermon, your Majesty.\u201d\u2018Bermon?\u2019The attendant was clarifying that since Rosemary was recommended by Marquess Bermon, she would be reliable. Medea, who had no friends, seemed to need a trusted person.The problem was that I think I\u2019ve heard the name of Marquess Bermon.\u2018Bermon\u2026 Bermon\u2026\u2026. Who was it?\u2019Medea had thought there would be no conspiracy for the Empress\u2019 position since she was alive. So she hadn\u2019t even bothered to write down the plot of the original novel. Medea blamed her frivolity and tried to recall Marquess Bermon.The maid hinted that she might have mistaken Medea\u2019s expression for something else.\u201cDidn\u2019t the Marquess tell you something, young lady?\u201dRosemary, who was anxious and wary of her, smiled and handed out a letter. A skeptical Medea gave her a look as if she was asking what it was she was holding out to her. Rosemary lowered her head and explained:\u201cThis is a letter from Marquess Bermon.\u201d\u2018Bermon\u2026 I remember!\u2019After Emilia\u2019s attempted assassination, she was a noble woman who tried to attach a mistress to Lyle. She had also attempted to get Lyle addicted to drugs!\u2018Medea was close to a woman like that?\u2019It was clear that Bermon was not a good influence. Could it be due to the Marquess that Medea repeatedly attempted suicide attempts to the magnitude that she looked foolish?As there was a baby in her stomach, she became uncomfortable to receive a letter from Rosemary.\u201cI see.\u201dShe motioned to a maid to receive the letter on her behalf and the maid came forward and received the letter from her. Rosemary seemed surprised that Medea did not receive the letter in person.\u201cIf it\u2019s Marquess of Bermon\u2026\u2026 I thought she was more considerate, but I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThis fit Medea\u2019s character. There were rumors that with the Emperor\u2019s favor she had become gentle, but her rude reputation had proceeded her for a long time.\u201cI won\u2019t bother to read it, so burn it. Handmaid, escort that child out, too.\u201d\u201cWhat? Your Majesty, Emp\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt the maid\u2019s unfiltered astonishment, Medea delivered a cold glare.\u00a0Even if she lost her memory, her temper can\u2019t completely disappear, thought the maid.\u201cI hear and obey.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dHastily, Rosemary fell at Medea\u2019s feet. She beseeched her with her forehead on the floor.\u201cPlease tell me what I did wrong! What did I do wrong?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re cute and coy.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhen Medea answered in an icy tone, she looked up at her in bewilderment, flustered. She studied Rosemary with a frosty gaze.\u201cI\u2019m favored by his Majesty\u2026\u2026 I know there are rumors that things are different between us from before. I didn\u2019t expect Marquess Bermon would betray me now.\u201d [t1v: her name could also be translated to Vermon [\u3142 has a b/v sound] it looks so similar to Vermin]Rosemary would be killed if she stayed here anyway. She knew that she would flirt with Lyle, and she didn\u2019t want to pretend that she didn\u2019t know.\u201cTell the Marquis\u2019 wife: It seems our happy days are over now. In the future, there will be no need for her to visit the imperial palace.\u201dSu-yeon has never met a woman named Marquess Bermon since she had possessed Medea\u2019s body. This is because Lyle forbade her from meeting with other nobles so that Medea\u2019s amnesia would not leak out.Now, Lyle\u2019s and Medea\u2019s relationship has improved a lot, and they have a child in between them, so it didn\u2019t matter if her amnesia leaked out.There was no need to get close since she remembered Marquess Bermon was a villain. Now that she thought about it, Medea was sure that Marquess Bermon encouraged the orginial Medea to be absurd and attempt suicide.\u201cYour Majesty, please tell me if I did anything wrong!

She approached as if she was about to grab Medea\u2019s skirt, but the quick-witted maids quickly blocked her.Medea was now with the Emperor\u2019s child. If she was startled, Lyle would not hesitate to cut off the maids\u2019 head.\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. It is Marquess Bermon\u2019s fault. \u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want to see you any more.\u201dAs she continued to talk, the maid bowed deeply.\u201cI\u2019ll send her out right away, your Majesty.\u201dThe maids surrounded Rosemary, who was mortified. She wanted to plead to Medea again, but the maids\u2019 eyes were sharp. If she made any more of a fuss, the maids, not the Empress, were going to get angry.Medea turned around, not watching Rosemary follow the maid. She pretended to be calm, but she was in turmoil inside.\u2018Why? Why has Rosemary appeared? Didn\u2019t the conspiracy begin because Medea was dead?\u2019***Lyle was frowning, deeply irritated.He didn\u2019t want to admit it, but the previous Medea was a pretty good buffer for Lyle.That was the case, when people tried to stuff women next to him.If someone wanted to introduce a woman to him, the old Medea wouldn\u2019t stay still. Whether openly or secretly, she had always retaliated and harmed them.People gossiped about the Empress\u2019s surly fury so his Majesty couldn\u2019t even chase women. It was a welcome rumor for Lyle, who disliked women.He didn\u2019t want Medea to pester him, but she was good excuse to dodge women thrown at him.But\u2026.\u201cYour Majesty, how do you feel?\u201dLyle looked at Duke Lance, who poured alcohol and hinted at him, with a smooth face.He knew what the current rumors were about. The Emperor finally put a leash on the fierce Empress. It was rumored that the Emperor conquered the Empress in the bedroom so the now tamed gentle-as-a-lamb Empress followed the Emperor\u2019s words.Well, yes, it is true that I embrace Medea a little too much, but\u2026\u2026.\u2018Gentle lamb?\u2019Recently, the rumor caught on widely because Medea did not attend any ball for fear of revealing her memory loss. The number of balls hosted at the Imperial Palace was reduced to less than half, and Lyle only briefly made appearances.\u2018Even if that\u2019s the case, you dare to do this trick\u2026\u2026.\u2019Lyle clenched his teeth as he watched the dancer dancing gracefully in the middle of the banquet hall.Medea\u2019s vigilance had become lax, so this was a masterful attempt to try and capture his heart. Whether it\u2019s a concubine or a mistress, they wanted to win his favor.Their designs were obvious, but this time the strategy was too\u00a0outrageous.The dancer had an uncanny resemblance to the person Lyle misses most.She looked like Empress Grace, his mother. The unfortunate Empress who lost her life while being imprisoned in the tower.The dancer resembling Lyle\u2019s mother, raised the excitement and anticipation in the banquet hall.\u2018Did you think I wouldn\u2019t reject a woman that looked like my mother?\u2019It is true that he grieved and missed his mother his whole life. However, he didn\u2019t want her memory to be ridiculed in this way.He has a wife named Medea, and he also has a child with her.My mother suffered because of the plentiful woman in the former Emperor\u2019s harem all her life. Do you think I\u2019ll take that woman in and make Medea suffer just because her appearance resembles her? Why\u2014do you think it\u2019s hard to do it all the time because she\u2019s with child?\u201cAre you enjoying the dance?\u201dThe Duke asked with a subtle smile. He was so confident that Lyle had taken a liking to her and that she was to his taste. He was infuriated by that.Slam!When the glass of wine loudly banged against the table, the hall became silent. The musicians stopped playing and the dancer Camilla also ceased dancing and looked up at the Emperor and Duke Lance.\u201cVulgar.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow dare you use a woman who looks like my mother as a laughingstock for a drinking party\u2026. Are you trying to insult me?\u201dAt the Emperor\u2019s cold words, Duke Lance panicked. The Duke knew that Lyle hung a portrait of Empress Grace in the hallway leading to his bedroom and occasionally stared at it\u2014he didn\u2019t know his gesture would be interpreted like this.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not! That\u2019s\u2026 I just thought your Majesty would like Camilla\u2019s dance.\u2026.\u201dThe Duke of Lance\u2019s head remembered Marquess Bermon advice: His Majesty has a noble taste, so it would be better to introduce a woman as a supporter than to introduce him to a dancer at a banquet.However, Duke Lance, who knew that the nobles who were introduced as a supporter in similar ways were rejected one after another, and could not consider that tactic.Rumors were circulating that the ascetic Emperor had recently discovered the joy of a married couple with the Empress. The Empress\u2019s giggles and moans were so loud that it crossed and echoed in the hallways of the palace.That\u2019s why he had ignored Marquess Bermon\u2019s insistence and invited the Emperor to the banquet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The duke was blue in the face and knelt in front of Emperor on the spot. Slamming his head to the ground, he implored Lyle.\u201cI could never do that\u2026\u2026. How could I commit such a duplicity to your Majesty?\u201d\u201cEven if you claim you didn\u2019t do this, don\u2019t your actions say otherwise?\u201dDuke Lance trembled, dripping sweat. He thought he would fall in love with Camilla because he missed his mother, and didn\u2019t expect he would get so angry.Camilla was also tactful, so she was kneeling on the floor of the banquet hall quickly putting on her gown again according to the gestures of a servant, which she had taken off before.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Because that woman is only guilty of resembling my mother, so I can\u2019t punish her. But she won\u2019t be able to sell her smile in front of men again*.\u201d [t1v: *she can\u2019t do sex work]Camilla, who had studied Lyle\u2019s preferences and dislikes from both the Duke of Lance and the Marquis of Vermon, wondered what was going on.\u201cGive that woman an appropriate amount of money and send her out of the country. It will be at the Duke\u2019s own expense. In addition, the repair project of Graxon Castle, which you had mentioned before, will be funded entirely with the Duke\u2019s treasury.\u201dDuke Lance\u2019s eyes almost popped out when his brain calculated the amount but when his eyes met Lyle\u2019s gaze he put his head back down.\u201cIf I ever hear a report that she danced in front of the men again or that the repair job was done poorly\u2026\u2026.\u201dLyle smiled coldly and glared at the duke.\u201cYou should be prepared then. Do you understand me, Duke Lance?\u201d\u201cOf course, your Majesty.\u201dThe Duke of Lance, who barely raised his head, answered with a shiver. Lyle stared at him with a look that showed he was still dissatisfied and got up from his seat.\u201cI will be watching you.\u201dWhen he stepped up and left the banquet hall, his escort knights and attendants quietly followed him. Even after the Emperor left, Duke Lance couldn\u2019t readily raise his head and was still perspiring. He only raised his head when the door closed as the last servant exited.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dQuick-witted Camilla quickly left the banquet hall before the Duke\u2019s anger engulfed her.\u2018Did he even notice?\u2019The former emperor indulged in lust but Lyle, the current emperor, was too competent. He was about to put a woman who resembled his mother in his eye, getting him addicted to drugs, and stimulating him from behind\u2026\u2026.\u2018I haven\u2019t run out of luck yet\u2026\u2026.\u2019The Duke of Lance withered without being able to reveal his feelings because he was afraid of the eyes of other nobles gathered at the banquet hall. The servants approached and quickly raised him, but the dukeangrily shook off their hands and woke up on his own.\u2018I\u2026 Are you going to leave like this?\u2019He ordered Camilla to be sent out of the country, but he did not tell him to send her out immediately. So just because it was delayed for a few days, punishment wouldn\u2019t fall.\u2018I\u2019ve planned this for several years\u2026\u2026.\u2019Duke Lance forcibly smiled, while casting off the words of other high-ranking aristocrats who comforted him in one ear and out the other.***\u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019The incident was taking place as if the original novel had already begun. Although it has not yet revealed its specific form, Rosemary\u2019s appearance seemed to be one of the signs.\u2018Though Seira saves Princess Emilia\u2019s life\u2026\u2026 But there\u2019s no Seira next to me right now!\u2019The knight\u2019s examinations were held only in spring. At the moment, there is no justification to assign Seira to her side as a knighted guard. Even more so\u2026.\u2018Seira wasn\u2019t even Emilia\u2019s guard. She had accidentally heard a scream and saved Emilia.\u2019Whatever the reason, it was clear that Seira was key in blocking the incident, so Medea wanted her by her side. Her life was important, but she was also anxious about the life in her womb.\u2018I can\u2019t even discuss it with Lyle.\u2026.\u2019Until now, she had been ignorantly blissful like a child. She had been relieved that she had only a little morning sickness and her lower stomach didn\u2019t hurt at all as she had heard that it hurt a lot as the uterus stretches to make room for the baby.\u2018And to think I was rejoicing in the perks of being in a romance novel!\u2019Medea wanted to cry because she couldn\u2019t confide the truth and her worries to anyone. She was even more scared because she had a baby in her stomach.\u2018I don\u2019t know anything else, but I know my child has to be safe.\u2019Without knowing that she was feeling jittery* after being pregnant, [t1v: *Studies show pregnancy changes people\u2019s brains and makes them more paranoid and hypervigilant] Medea sat on the sofa in a depressed mood. The maids attempted to lighten the Empress\u2019 mood.\u201cHis Majesty is here, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dOften, Lyle would stop by as soon as he had time. After Medea became pregnant, he came by even more frequently.\u201cMillie.\u201dThe door opened and Lyle entered. She burst into tears. Feeling like his heart was collapsing, he rushed towards Medea.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dEmbracing Medea in his arms, Lyle\u2019s puzzled gaze was directed at the maids, asking what happened. Noticing his question, the maids explained:\u201cEarlier today\u2026 Lady Laurent came saying she was the new maid-in-waiting.\u201d\u201cHow dare that little girl disturb the Empress\u2019s mood?\u201dAt the voice of an angry Lyle, Medea raised her head and grabbed onto the hem of his clothes. Listening to his voice, he seemed ready to cut off Rosemary\u2019s head just because she made Medea cry.\u201cNo, just seeing your Majesty\u2026\u2026 makes me relieved. I feel safe now.\u201d\u201cMillie.\u201dLyle answered in a soft tone and gave the maids a hint. The maids bowed their heads silently and escaped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thinking about the baby in my belly has made me anxious.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dLyle looked down on the top of Medea\u2019s head, leaning against his chest.My person.It was a person who had his own child.\u201cMedea\u2026 You\u2019re not alone. I am beside you. There\u2019s nothing to fear.\u201dEven when he saw a beautiful woman named Camilla who resembled his mother, Lyle didn\u2019t feel anything. Far from arousing any desire as a man, he only felt unpleasant remembering the intention behind the beauty.Even while watching her dance, Lyle thought of Medea and felt sorry for her.He heard the early stages of pregnancy were the most important \u2026..\u2026. In this regard, he remembered that she was particularly sensitive.\u201cThen\u2026 Please increase the number of knights guarding me.\u201d\u201cGuards?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a bad idea especially since she was with child. Thinking of the curse or poison in the gifts arriving for the Empress, Lyle nodded.\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026 I want Baron Hestia to be my escort.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe word \u201cno\u201d was about to pop out of his throat, but hehesitated when he saw Medea\u2019s serious face.Don\u2019t tell me Medea is really interested in him.Lyle was wary of Baron Hestia\u2019s pretty face.\u201cWhy him?\u201d\u201cI heard that even though several assassins attacked, they protected their younger sister. He not a nobleman in the capital, so he is trustworthy.\u2026.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean that aristocrats in the capital cannot be trusted?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any memories, so honestly I don\u2019t know who to trust.\u201dGerrard praised him, so his skills wouldn\u2019t have been bad. In addition, as Medea said, he was a person who survived with the grace of the Empress. He thought it was not a bad choice to trust him.\u2018But\u2026\u2019That pretty boy? On top of that, Lyle spotted how he gazed at Medea. Lyle knew Medea didn\u2019t intend to do that, but\u2026\u2026.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty? You don\u2019t like it?\u201d\u201cWhat? Why do you think I won\u2019t like it?\u201d\u201dAt Lyle\u2019s words, Medea\u2019s head tilted.\u201cRight\u2026. you were wary of Baron Hestia from the first day you met him.\u201d\u201cWhy should I be wary of him? He\u2019s a mere baron. I\u2019m\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the emperor.\u201dSmiling as if she knew everything, Medea intercepted Lyle\u2019s words.Lyle looked at Medea with a disapproving gaze. It wasn\u2019t because he disliked her interruption but her smile seemed to say, \u201cI know why you hate Baron Hestia.\u201d\u2018That\u2019s funny. Do you want me to be jealous of a baron?\u2019\u201cAlright. If you like Baron Hestia, let\u2019s appoint him as your guard. It is another favor the Empress is giving to Hestia.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty is full of grace.\u201dMedea\u2019s big smile made him chuckle, even though he felt slightly anxious inside.\u201cIt\u2019s an appointment that the Empress begged the Emperor for, so the Empress should thank me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m always thankful for you.\u201d\u201cJust with words?\u201dasked Lyle playfully as he stroked her lips. Medea grinned and kissed him. With a light kiss, he smirked and countered,\u201cA little deeper. It doesn\u2019t count until I put my tongue in,\u201dhe whispered, pulling her waist so she sat on his lap. Medea laughed and happily reciprocated.***\u201cI am the Empress\u2019s escort knight\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeira blinked at the unbelievable content. The imperial family\u2019s messenger only did his job and remained silent despite her flustered and thrilled incredulity.She stood blankly for a while, receiving the letter of appointment from the imperial palace.She had been satisfied with just taking the Knight\u2019s examinations and leaving the capital\u2026 but now she couldn\u2019t believe that she was appointed as an escort, to guard Her Majesty the Empress\u2026\u2026. Furthermore, his Majesty even said that he would ordain her as a knight.\u2018I can\u2019t do this\u2026\u2026.\u2019Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euBut she also couldn\u2019t refuse.

Now that she was now with the Emperor\u2019s child, she was like a tiger with wings.\u2018I\u2019m pretty sure my sister knows Baron Hestia\u2019s true identity\u2026.. but I should still check.\u2019Even though an official letter came down from the imperial family, it was still before anything big had been committed. If Medea asked the Emperor without knowing anything, it could still be corrected.\u201cSir Hestia. I need to discuss something with you.\u201dAs if she could guess Luke\u2019s intentions, Seira\u2019s expression hardened. Inside, Luke was a little hurt but he knew it was inevitable. He seemed to like Lady Hestia more than he intially thought.\u201cIt\u2019s related to your assignment as an escort knight for her Majesty.\u201dBecause of the fact that he stayed at the Card Duke\u2019s mansion, Seira would have been considered an escort knight attached to the Duke. If Seira\u2019s identity was discovered after being appointed as the Empress\u2019s escort, the dukedom could also be held liable.Seira nodded slowly.\u201cCome up to my office.\u201d***\u2018I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been notified by now\u2026\u2026.\u2019Medea, lying in bed and under Lyle\u2019s caress, thought about how Seira would react. She wanted to be a knight, so she may be pleased to be recognized by the emperor as an knight and to become Medea\u2019s escort.\u201cAngh\u2026..ohh\u2026.\u201dQuickly rubbing her soft petals, Medea bent like a bow. Perhaps conscious of the fetus, it was not as intense as before, so it was just teasing fun.\u201cAh, ahh\u2026!\u201dLyle ecstatically took in the sight of Medea tasting her peak with a sweet sound. He deeply sucked on Medea\u2019s thigh that was draped over his shoulder and left a kiss mark before lightly biting her trembling ankle.\u201cUhhmm\u2026\u201dMedea moaned and held Lyle\u2019s gaze with pleasure-soaked eyes.The doctor said that sex should not be done for the first nine weeks, but only five weeks had passed. Lyle had been holding back pretty well.\u2018I want to do it,\u2019Medea thought as she watched Lyle lick his lips while neatly dressed.Although he didn\u2019t not insert his member, Lyle put his finger or tongue inside the Medea and made her cum several times. She felt good, but she also wanted to feel Lyle\u2019s.\u2018I must be crazy. Because Lyle touches and titillates me every day\u2026\u2026.\u2019\u201cAre you feeling good, Millie?\u201dLyle asked as he gazed into Medea\u2019s lustful eyes. Medea glanced at Lyle, the color in her cheeks growing more intense.\u201cGo-good. Your Majesty, are you okay? I\u2019m the only one\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun to watch the Empress cum\u2026\u2014Uhnn\u2014 Millie.\u201dThe prominent silhouette of Lyle\u2019s erection was in full view against his clothes as he leaned close over her and whispered. As Medea groped the bulge she felt it swell up in her hand, Lyle heated up and grabbed her wrist.\u201cDid they say we shouldn\u2019t do this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to put it in. But\u2026\u2026. I want to make you feel good too.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dShe had seen Lyle use her asscheeks and thighs to cum when he couldn\u2019t penitrate her. She intended to do something similar.\u201cFirst of all\u2026 Please take off your clothes and lie down.\u201dLyle smiled and happily took off his clothes. He disrobed his shirt, pulled down his pants, and lied down on the bed.Because of the anticipation of Medea touching his body, Lyle\u2019s penis became frighteningly hard. Medea\u2019s mouth became dry and she gulped, starstruck at the sight of the hideous form swelling up with bulging veins.\u2018It\u2019s too much to do with my mouth\u2026\u2026.\u2019Medea got up from her seat, sat down around Lyle\u2019s waist. Lyle\u2019s expression became blurry and darkened as she dared to lay the emperor\u2019s penis between her legs.\u201cHu\u2014 uh\u2026 Millie..\u2026.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m very wet\u2026\u2026 It\u2019ll be okay.\u201dFeeling a fever rising in her face from her brazen words, Medea began to shake her hips. Lyle\u2019s face heated up as she rubbed his large penis against her slit.\u201cNngh\u2026\u201dIt was difficult to suppress the pleasure of the soft and hot stimulation of her body against his cock.\u201cAh\u2026 it\u2019s hard\u2026\u2026. Umm\u2026\u201dWet petals and wet flesh are rubbed against Lyle\u2019s precum.

Ah\u2026 Lyle!\u201dAt the moment Medea orgasmed, Lyle also ejaculated and panted heavily. Medea fell over Lyle\u2019s chest and looked into Lyle\u2019s hazy eyes.They kissed and took in their lingering sounds when Lyle suddenly laid Medea\u2019s body on the bed.\u201cMillie\u2026\u201dLyle\u2019s eyes were dripping with passion.

Medea was astonished and looked at Lyle.\u201cT-that place! \u2014Hnngh!His penetrating finger skillfully and gently searched for a place that Medea liked.

Ahh!Medea shook her head left and right at Lyle\u2019s touch while he stimulated her clit with his thumb and teased the erogenous zone in her asshole at the same time.When Medea was excited during sex, she had often tasted Lyle\u2019s stimulating finger in there, but he had never inserted his member.\u201cOh\u2026 no! Oooh, your Majesty, there\u2026\u2026. Ahhhhhh!Could that place take a penis? It was true, Lyle, who has a strong sexual desire, would not be able to feel satisfied it until the ninth week. It was clear that once he was allowed there, he would covet everything and it would become a long day.\u201cI touched it every day, and it became very soft. Look\u2026 I\u2019m still inserting my third finger, but it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\u201cHmm, Lyle\u2026\u2026.

Millie\u2026.\u201d\u201cHaaa\u2026 haa\u2026\u2026.\u201dMedea inhaled heavily, and swallowed her saliva. It was obvious she would suffer for the remaining four weeks until she allowed it.Pulling a finger out of the vaginal opening, Lyle targeted her now ready ass, which was now completely soft.

I\u2019m nervous.\u2019Standing in front of Luke\u2019s office, Seira checked her outfit. It would be the first time she would be alone with Luke after receiving a kiss and proposal.\u2018Plus\u2026 it\u2019s not like we\u2019ll kiss, but I\u2019m still anxious.\u201dLuke even promised he would accompany her home and send her a proposal, acting as if nothing had happened\u2014she felt disappointed and embarrassed recalling it. Seira raised her hand to knock on the door with heavy, complicated feelings.Now was not the time to care about Luke\u2019s proposal. The only thing that mattered now was whether or not she would be the Empress\u2019s escort knight.Of course, as Seira she wanted to do it, but as Ian she could not be in the capital for a long time because she had Ian\u2019s position. This was much bigger than taking the knight\u2019s examination in the capital.\u2018As expected\u2026 I should reject it, right?\u2019Knock knock\u2026\u201cCome in.\u201dAfter hearing Luke\u2019s voice.

Feeling her heart pound, Seira closed the office door.\u201cLet\u2019s sit down\u2026 Shall we let them bring out the tea?\u201d\u201cN-no thank you.\u201dShe would be more on edge if there were going to be servants going back and forth. As Seira shook her head, Luke guided her to a sofa set on one side.The treatment was different from when she was a baron to when she was a lady. Of course, Luke treated Seira as a Baron when others were present but thoroughly treated her as Lady Hestia when it was only the two of them.When Seira sat on the sofa, Luke settled opposite of her. Seira looked at his serious face and thought he was handsome.If she were to accept the Empress\u2019s offer and position as an escort knight, she would be appointed as a knight by the emperor, but if she refused, there is a high possibility that she would not be able to take the knight\u2019s test.\u2018Maybe I\u2014I\u2019ll have to go down to my hometown like this.\u2019She went down to Silore like this, Luke would accompany her.The young ducal heir of the Dukedom of Card was too much for Seira, who was only a provincial aristocrat. Plus, it would be difficult to refuse his proposal because she had been caught deceiving the emperor by dressing up as a man.\u2018Of course\u2026 It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like this person. But\u2026.\u2019This opportunity was too good. Seira wanted to be a knight by taking the knight\u2019s test fairly, but she also wanted to have a chance to pay back even a little favor by serving the Empress who helped them.\u2018As expected, I can\u2019t, right?\u2019\u201cYour ladyship.\u201dAfter a long silence, Luke gazed at Seira with a serious countenance.\u201cAs far as I know, you haven\u2019t given a reply to the Imperial Palace yet. Could you please delay your response for a while?\u201dSeira was surprised, she had thought that Luke would immediately tell her she could not take the offer.\u201cYou want me to delay my answer?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
