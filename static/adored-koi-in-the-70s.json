The villagers nibbled on melon seeds as they stayed indoors, gossiping and smacking their mouths.Gou Dan's mother spat out melon seeds and said: \"That Fang Xiao Juan is cruel. Driving out a six-year-old child out of the house in this three-to-nine-degree bitter winter !\"The production team leader's wife, Liu Cui Hua sighed: \"It's not the first day you know that she is biased. A pair of twin daughters. One was starved until there is no meat on the face. The other is fair and delicate. Is there such a mother?\"Song Jin Lai's wife suddenly lowered her voice: \"Don't you guys feel that Da Qiao is cursed? The whole family has been ruined. A black cat isn't as cursed as her!\"Fang Xiao Juan was old Second Qiao a.k.a Qiao Zhen Jun's wife. Within half a year of their marriage, Fang Xiao Juan became pregnant with twins.It was just that this pregnancy wasn't easy. The delivery was even more difficult. When Da Qiao was born, her feet came out first. Xiao Qiao was held back inside until her face turned purple. Fang Xiao Juan had a severe bleeding. Three people and two almost died.Because of this, Fang Xiao Juan blamed Da Qiao.She gave Xiao Qiao good food and drink. Nourished like a delicate miss. However, she tried to torment Da Qiao at every corner. From the age of three, she made her do chores- sweeping the floor, feeding the chickens, and collecting firewood. All kinds of work!A few years later, Da Qiao had changed from a far and plump little dumpling to a yellowish-looking little stutter. She was six years old and wasn't as tall as four or five years old!If that was all, then it was fine. The problem was that Qiao Zhen Jun became paralyzed ten days ago and this matter was connected with Da Qiao!Half a month ago, Da Qiao suddenly ran to West Wood to dig out bird eggs. West Wood was so smoggy all year round that adults didn't dare to enter it easily. A little brat like her went in. Wasn't this seeking death?Sure enough, she fell into a pit trap shortly after entering. When everyone found her, she was frozen into a popsicle and was only left with half a breath. She stayed in the hospital for seven days before her life was saved!On the day of discharge from the hospital, Qiao Zhen Jun went to pick up his daughter by himself. Halfway back, a thunderstorm came down. Da Qiao missed a step and rolled towards a ditch. In order to save his daughter, Qiao Zhen Jun rolled down as well, His lower spine bumped against a large jutted-out rock. He fainted on the spot in pain.After he was sent to the hospital, the doctor said that his spinal nerve in the lumbar area was injured too severely and couldn't be cured with the current medical level.Like this, Qiao Zhen Jun became paralyzed.After old Second Qiao became paralyzed, Fang Xiao Juan cried all day long that she wanted to die and clamoring that she would drive out the star of calamity, Da Qiao.At this time, there was a howl suddenly sounded outside\u2014\"I don't want to live ah!\"Liu Cui Hua trio immediately ran out. When they arrived at Qiao Family's courtyard, many people were already surrounding the entrance.\"What kind of evil did I commit? I gave birth to a calamity. After bringing misfortune to her mom and sister, she now targets her dad. This is wanting to kill the whole family!\"Fang Xiao Juan was a well-known beauty in Dongfeng Community. But right now, she was sitting on the ground with disheveled hair and got mud and chicken poop stuck to her trousers. Which part of her looked like a beauty?\"What nonsense are you talking about, woman? What did this matter have to do with Da Qiao?\" Qiao Zhen Jun's voice sounded from within the house.Fang Xiao Juan jumped up from the ground like she received adrenaline: \"How am I talking nonsense?! I bleed heavily in the past, Xiao Qiao almost suffocated. Now you are paralyzed. Which has nothing to do with her? I will put it out here today. The calamity must be cast out! \"Qiao Zhen Jun gritted his teeth: \"No matter what you say, I won't agree to it anyway!\"While Fang Xiao Juan was acting up, a little dumpling was squatting in front of a small stove to decoct medicine in the kitchen room with two rows of tears trialing on her palm-sized cheeks. Looking very pitiful.Da Qiao held a cattail leaf fan and gently fanned the fire while sobbing quietly.After the medicine was decocted, she wiped her tears with her small hand, stood up, and poured the medicine into the old porcelain bowl neatly. Then she covered it with a rag and walked out carefully.Fang Xiao Juan turned her head and saw her coming out. At once, her anger exploded and ran over to throw out two slaps!The old porcelain bowl slammed to the ground with a \"clang\" sound. The Chinese medicine splashed on the tender and delicate ankles and a large area of redness instantly appeared.There were two red and swollen palm prints floating on her face. Tears hung on her long and curled eyelashes, which were too late to be wiped off. Her eyes were clean and bright as if one was looking in a magic mirror and could reveal the ugliest side of people.Fang Xiao Juan saw her hideous appearance in her eyes and was startled for a moment. She became more ashamed and angry: \"You are calamity to the whole family. Scram now!\"Da Qiao blinked her big deer-like eyes. The tears fell down. She softly pleading: \"I will, do, more work. I won't, eat. Mom, don't, drive me, out.\"Fang Xiao Juan wouldn't listen. She grabbed her hair and dragged her out.Da Qiao's scalp was almost torn off. Tears kept falling from the pain. Her body trembled constantly.Qiao Zhen Jun leaned on the window and his eyes were bloodshot: \"Fang Xiao Juan, stop!\"At this moment, a big hand stretched out, grabbed Fang Xiao Juan\u2019s hair without warning and pulled it back hard!Fang Xiao Juan's head tilted back. Feeling that her scalp was about to be torn off, she screamed in pain, \"Ahhhhh... let go! Let go!\"The person behind her coldly stated: \"You let go, then I will let go!\"This voice...Was the voice of her mother-in-law, Qiao Xiu Zhi!Fang Xiao Juan shuddered subconsciously and immediately let go of Da Qiao's hair.Only then, Qiao Xiu Zhi let go. She waved her fan-sized hand and a mass of black things floated down from her hand.Everyone took a closer look. My god, it was actually a big bunch of hair!Fang Xiao Juan touched her bald scalp. Her tears almost came down: \"Mom, what happened to you today? How can you help this money-wasting thing instead?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi sneered: \"If Da Qiao is a money-wasting thing, you are too. You are the most money-wasting thing!\"Laughter erupted all around. Fang Xiao Juan's face became hot.Qiao Xiu Zhi was born with godly strength. She held a unique position in the family. At the same time, she was a tyrant in the village. No one dared to climb on her head and run wild.It was just that she didn't like Fang Xiaojuan, this daughter-in-law very much. When Qiao Zhen Jun proposed to marry Fang Xiao Juan, she disapproved at once.Everyone from the top to the bottom of Fang Family was a lazy bum. They loved to make trouble everywhere. Whoever got such in-laws was unlucky.Fang Xiao Juan had a bad reputation. Before marrying Qiao Zhen Jun, she was in an unclear relationship with a male educated youth. Later, when the male educated youth returned to the city, there was no news. Only then, she rushed to find someone to marry. Qiao Zhen Jun was her chosen target.For such a woman, Fang Family actually had the face request a 150 yuan gift. One must know, one can marry three wives in the countryside for 150 yuan!Qiao Xiu Zhi was naturally unwilling to. However, Qiao Zhen Jun, who had always been honest and filial, unknowingly acted out of the norm. He persisted in marrying Fang Xiao Juan no matter what.Qiao Xiu Zhi was stubborn and told Qiao Zhen Jun to write down the IOU. The gift money was borrowed from the family and then the young couple was separated from the family on the third day of their marriage.Fang Xiao Juan was full of hate and frustration: \"Mom, this money... child is a calamity. If I don't drive her out, she will kill us all!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi sternly said: \"Seems like you had enough of living! Everywhere is desolate and you dare to promote feudal superstitions. Bad circle like you should be sent to the farm for reform and learn a new mindset and improve from there. Gain enlightenment!\"Fang Xiao Juan's face suddenly turned white.The farm wasn't a good place. The landlords and capitalists who had been sent over there work more and eat less. Within a few years, their body can't handle it. She didn't want to be sent to such a place.It was just that she still felt unwilling: \"My own child, why can\u2019t I hit her? I\u2019m her mom. What can others say if I beat her to death?\"\"Beat to death? You are so capable. Why don't you go to heaven!\" Qiao Xiu Zhi coldly snorted, \"You want to hit, right? Then hit now. Once you beat her to death, I will report you to the police station!\"What a merciless old lady!Someone watching the show didn\u2019t mind adding a knife to the drama: \"I say, Fang Xiao Juan, don\u2019t be impulsive. It is unlawful to kill. I heard that those caught will not only wear a high hat to parade around but will also be shot!\"Fang Xiao Juan let out a screech and then started crying again: \"Oh goddamn it. Why is my life so bitter? I can't scold and beat this family cursing thing and got to treat it as an ancestor. I can't live anymore... \u2026\"Qiao Xiu Zhi had a stern face on: \"If you don't want to live, then die! Die now, I will pay and buy a coffin board for you!\"Fang Xiao Juan: \"\u2026\u2026\"The onlooking villagers laughed again.Fang Xiao Juan's teeth ached with hate. Old witch, only ruin things for her!She gritted her teeth, rushed into the room, and said to Qiao Zhen Jun, \"What do you plan to do with that calamity, Da Qiao?\"Qiao Zhen Jun's eyes were sunken and his face was bristly unshaven.He showed an expression of pain: \"Da Qiao is also our child. Why can't you love her like Xiao Qiao?\"Fang Xiao Juan spat, \"She's a calamity. Is she worthy of being compared with Jiao Jiao'er? I will put it out here today. This family can only have her or me. Choose!Qiao Zhen Jun closed his eyes and clenched his hand under the quilt into a fist. He used silence as a protest.Fang Xiao Juan usually didn't like his character that won't give fart even when getting hit by a stick. She had already reached this point and unexpectedly he still protected this calamity!Fang Xiao Juan's face turned green.Fang Xiao Juan was shaking with anger.Fang Xiao Juan felt she lost face.\"Well, since you want to protect her, then you can live with the calamity!\"After finishing speaking, she turned around resentfully to pack her baggage. She deliberately threw things around and made loud noises.However, Qiao Zhen Jun didn't open his mouth even when she finished packing up and was about to walk out the door.Fang Xiao Juan was so angry that she ground her teeth!She ran to another room and grabbed Xiao Qiao and stated, \"Let's go. Come with mom to Grandma's house!\"When Fang Xiao Juan came in, Xiao Qiao was reading a book. When she heard what she said, she tilted her head and nodded: \"Okay then.\"Fang Xiao Juan felt much better when she heard that Xiao Qiao was willing to go back to her maternal home with her.Completely different from that calamity. Xiao Qiao was the greatest achievement in her life!Seeing her mom come out with the baggage, Da Qiao's face turned pale in fright. She blinked her big eyes and begged: \"Mom, don't, don't go.\"Her voice was soft and waxy, like a soft glutinous rice cake wrapped in sugar. At this moment, she was pulling her mom's sleeve. Timidly, like a frightened little animal.Fang Xiao Juan hated her to death and shook her off hard: \"Don't call me. I'm not your mom!\"Da Qiao fell to the ground and blood oozed out of her palm. But she didn't care at all. She got up and wanted to chase after.Qiao Xiu Zhi stepped forward and held her collar like holding a baby chicken: \"Don't beg her. Let her go!\"She wanted to see how much this woman act up!Fang Xiao Juan stood up like a proud peacock and walked away arrogantly.Unexpectedly, when she walked to the entrance of the small courtyard, her feet slipped. Her knees hit the ground first and then her whole body splat down on the ground.Xiao Qiao was pulled down together.\"BANG!\"The mother and daughter fell flat on their face together!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When the original owner was born, she remained in the stomach for too long and her brain was damaged from the suffocation.She thought that she would be able to change the fate of the original owner like all other heroines in the novels. Don't know why, she couldn't control the original owner's body.She can clearly hear what others were saying, but she can't react to the outside world. She seems to be separated from the outside world by a layer of glass. She can hear it, but can't touch it.She didn\u2019t know how to eat by herself. She didn\u2019t know how to dress herself. She had to rely on others to help her eat and drink. She can\u2019t even commit suicide!She was trapped inside the body of the fool. Every day, she watched herself being mocked and pranked by the crowd. She was angry and in despair but could do nothing.For her, the days in her previous life were like a long nightmare!She returned very early in this life. She became conscious when she was still in the stomach. On the day of her birth, she desperately squeezed Da Qiao and got out. So she didn't let herself become retarded again.Since her rebirth, everything had been going smoothly. She had always been that family's kid. This is the first time that she had been embarrassed in public like this!There was a burst of laughter around.Song Jin Lai's wife laughed the most wildly: \"Falling flat on their face, hahaha... I say, Fang Xiao Juan, it's too early for New Year. There's really no need to make such a large display of New Year greeting to everyone.\"Song Jin Lai\u2019s wife didn't have any grudges with Fang Xiao Juan. It was just a habit of being sharp-tongued. What's more, she had always been jealous of Fang Xiao Juan\u2019s good-looking appearance and found Qiao Zhen Jun spoiling her like a treasure displeasing. So now she saw her making a fool of herself, she gloated.Everyone couldn't resist laughing more when they heard Song Jin Lai's wife's words.Fang Xiao Juan's face alternated between green and white. She got up with her hands on her waist. She spatted toward Song Jin Lai's wife: \"You have the face to laugh at me. Don't you remember that you fell into a dung pit?\"Everyone laughed louder.A few days ago, Song Family got half a jin of pork. When Song Jin Lai's wife was cooking, she secretly hid two pieces of fatty pork. Once it was the middle of the night when everyone was asleep, she got up to eat pork. In this cold winter weather, the pork was frozen and became cold and greasy. Song Jin Lai's wife started to have a stomachache soon after eating.In the black night, she ran five or six times to the pit. The last time, she pooed until her legs weakened. She didn't even have the strength to stand. As soon as she stood up, her body tilted and she fell into the pit!At that time, Song Jin Lai\u2019s wife howled so screechingly. Many children were frightened into tears, while the watchdogs barked non-stop. When Song Jin Lai\u2019s wife was rescued, her head to toe was covered with poo. The old and young of Song Family vomited at the sight!Song Jin Lai's wife flushed with embarrassment. She pushed through the crowd and ran away with her face covered.Pah, what did she think she was? As if she got any face to gloat in front of her!Fang Xiao Juan's hands remained on her waist and looked triumphant.Turning her head around, she saw Xiao Qiao was still lying on the ground. Immediately, she stop flaunting her power and helped her up: \"My Jiao Jiao. Mommy's precious. Are you hurt from the fall? Let Mom see if you hurt anywhere?\"Seeing Xiao Qiao\u2019s forehead smashed, she felt distressed as if her heart had been dug out: \"Goddamn. why is the forehead damaged like this? What if it becomes disfigured? Don\u2019t be afraid, Jiao Jiao. Mom is taking you to the health clinic now. Mom will ask the doctor to prescribe the best medicine for you. It will definitely not leave any scars on you!\"Hearing that her forehead was damaged, Xiao Qiao suddenly became anxious: \"Let's go to the hospital now!\"She wanted to be fair and rich in her life. There was absolutely no room for blemishes on her face!Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at the fingernail-sized cut on Xiao Qiao's head and then glanced at the slap marks on Da Qiao's face. Her lips curled.They were both birthed by her. One was held in her hand for fear of falling off and stuck in her mouth for fear of disappearing but the other was like she was picked up. She had to do everything at home, from feeding chickens, cooking and cutting pigweed.This woman's heart was so biased all the way to the armpit!\"Okay, we'll go now.\"Fang Xiao Juan supported Xiao Qiao up to leave. She looked down and saw that there was a puddle of water where she fell. Her anger \"flared\" again: \"Why is there a puddle of water here? Was it you Da Qiao? You money-wasting thing, you poured water here on purpose, right?\"She glared at Da Qiao murderously, as if it wasn't her biological daughter who was standing in front of her but rather her enemy who killed her father.Da Qiao saw her mom and sister fall down at the same time and felt distressed. She never thought she'll be stabbed by her mom before she could speak.Her big apricot eyes became misty. She shook her two small hands: \"No, it's not, me, I haven't...\"Fang Xiao Juan interrupted her and said with an impatient look: \"It wasn't you, then it was you who brought the bad luck home. You black-hearted thing. I knew you would kill our whole family sooner or later!\"She fiercely shot daggered eyes at Da Qiao. If it weren't for her mother-in-law who stood there like an entrance god, she would have flown over and killed her!Da Qiao lowered her eyes. Her eyelashes trembled lightly like butterfly wings in the rain.She bit her pink lips. There was indescribable sadness in her heart.It wasn't her.She got up before dawn to clean the yard and cleaned every corner of the small yard. She didn't know where the water came from.Maybe her mom was right, she was a calamity. She brought bad luck home.Da Qiao\u2019s apricot eyes blinked. Two teardrops fell like pearls and hit the ground.That pitful appearance made everyone's heart feel soft.Someone persuaded, \"Isn't Da Qiao a good kid? Fang Xiao Juan, why do you always scold the kid?\"Fang Xiao Juan glared: \"You think she's good, then you take her back!\"That person immediately shut up.At this age, every household didn\u2019t have enough to eat. Who would be okay with raising another\u2019s children? Not to mention that Da Qiao was a bit cursed.Qiao Xiu Zhi narrowed her eyes and picked up the broom on the side and swung over: \"Scram! Aren't you going back to your maternal home? Get out of here now. It's better that you never come back for the rest of your life!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi can kill a wild boar with a single punch. If she gets hit, even if she doesn't die, she will lose half her life!Fang Xiao Juan was so frightened that she ran away while pulling Xiao Qiao with her. She didn't dare to return to pick up her shoe when it fell off.Everyone burst into laughter again when they saw the mother and daughter running away in a panic.After Fang Xiao Juan left, the villagers also dispersed.Liu Cui Hua was the last one to leave: \"Aunt Qiao, why don't you stop Fang Xiao Juan? The family got one young and one sick. How can it do to not have a woman?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi snorted: \"With so many people in our old Qiao Family, are we unable to live without her, Fang Xiao Juan?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi made up her mind to treat Fang Xiao Juan. Since she wanted to go, let her go. But if she wanted to come back, it won't be so easy!Liu Cui Hua was only blabbering a bit. Seeing that she had made up her mind, she stopped persuading and turned away.The courtyard became quiet.Qiao Xiu Zhi put the broom back, turned around, and saw Da Qiao standing there. She was staring straight at the door with big eyes. There was sadness on her small face that did not match her age.The cotton-padded clothes on her were old and oversized. Patches covered everywhere. The trousers were like eight-parts trousers. It revealed the thin ankles that were as thin as dry wood, as if they would break with a pinch. The shoes under her feet weren't decent. The two big toes were exposed.Let alone Qi Li Village, even in Dongfeng Community old Qiao Family's lifestyle was at the top. Although they can\u2019t freely eat fine white flour and rice every day, they had enough corn bread and coarse grains. Definitely won't leave their children hungry like refugees. Also, won't let the children be dressed in such a tattered fashion.Besides, even though the second branch was separated, Qiao Zhen Jun was a well-known diligent man in the production team before getting paralyzed. What's more, he had learned carpentry work from others before, so he could take on some furniture-making work and earn money. There weren't many, but it was absolutely no problem to feed a family.To make Da Qiao live like a beggar, it was Fang Xiao Juan's doing in the end!Qiao Xiu Zhi cursed Fang Xiao Juan again in her heart. Then she said with a grimace: \"On such a cold Tian, what are you doing here? Still not going in or do you rather turn into a frozen human popsicle?\"Da Qiao raised her head, looked straight at her grandmother with a pair of black crystal clear eyes, and whispered: \"Grandmother, am, I, a calamity?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi discovered for the first time that this child's eyes were very beautiful. Black and shiny like stars in the night sky. As if they could speak.She looked at herself cautiously. Her eyelashes trembling. So pitiful, like an abandoned kitten. No matter how hard-hearted people were, they couldn't help but soften their hearts at this sight.Qiao Xiu Zhi slapped her on the head: \"Not learning the got stuff and taking in all those nonsense! What calamity or money-wasting thing. Those all feudalism talk. Now it's a new society. Great leaders have said that women can support half the sky! Your mom's brain is broken by the door. Don't listen to her in the future, understand?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't use any force at all. However, she was born with great strength. Da Qiao's head shook from her tap.Despite hurting a bit, she was very happy.Because Grandmother said she wasn't a calamity!Da Qiao's eyebrows curved. Her mouth opened into a grin and revealed a mouthful of teeth: \"I, under, stand, Grandmother!\"As long as she wasn't a calamity and will not curse her parents and Xiao Qiao to death, she will not be kicked out of the house. It was great!She still wanted to ask when her mom would come back. But Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't give her this opportunity: \"Still not hurrying back and re-make the medicine? Don't you want your dad to be better?\"Da Qiao remembered that the medicine had been wasted. For now, she couldn't care about asking when her mom would be back. She turned and ran towards the stove.\u2014\u2014Fang Xiao Juan and Xiao Qiao waited until everyone left before they came back and put on their shoes. Then the mother and daughter pair went to the health clinic together.It was just Xiao Qiao's wound was so small. The nurse at the health clinic was didn't have the patience to bother with at all. She only cleaned up the wound and drove them away.After walking so far from the health clinic, Fang Xiao Juan was still scolding, \"What about serving the people? I'm going to report her. The dog-eyed thing looked down people!\"Xiao Qiao walked with her head down, ignoring her complaints.Her dad wasn't paralyzed in her last life. He had lived well. Although he hadn't become a rich guy, at least he hadn't dragged down the family.But he was now paralyzed. Qiao Family had no backbone. What should to do in the future?If Grandmother was willing to let them go back, then they can make do. But she hated her mom so much, she would definitely not want them to go back.Her dad can't work in the field. What's more, he still needed someone to take care of him in everything. If this goes on, it will definitely affect her quality of life!Really annoying!If she knew earlier that something like this would happen, she wouldn't lie to Da Qiao to go to West Wood that day!Damn, why wasn't the paralyzed person Da Qiao? Her luck was too good!Xiao Qiao frowned, feeling agitated.Fang Xiao Juan was dry from all the yelling. Only then she realized that Xiao Qiao hadn't responded to her at all.If the person in front of her was Da Qiao, she would have thrown out a slap. But it was Xiao Qiao, she immediately became nervous: \"Jiao Jiao'er, did you hit your head? Does your brain hurt? Mom will take you back to the health clinic for a check now. No, we won't go to the health clinic. We will ask Wang Shui Sheng for a letter of introduction and go to the town's hospital!\"As she spoke, she anxiously took Xiao Qiao to the production team leader, Wang Shui Sheng's house.Xiao Qiao pulled back her hand and said impatiently: \"Mom, I'm fine.\"Fang Xiao Juan saw that there was nothing wrong with her and became relieved: \u201cGreat. Jiao Jiao\u2019er is fine. Mom is relieved. Mom noticed that you haven\u2019t spoken for a long while and worried that you damage your brain.\u201dXiao Qiao was a famous child prodigy in Dongfeng Community. Even the secretary of the community praised her. No matter what she couldn't let her head be hurt. Otherwise, what would she have to show off to others in the future?Xiao Qiao said: \"I'm thinking about the future. My dad is paralyzed, what shall we do in the future?\"Fang Xiao Juan looked indifferent: \"What what to do? Live life as we should.\"Fang Xiao Juan wasn't worried. Qiao Family was well-known in Dongfeng Community. Although old Madam Qiao had a cold heart, she can't just watch her son and granddaughter starve to death, right?So she wasn't worried about the future at all. What she had to do now was to figure out a way to drive out the calamity, Da Qiao. As long as the calamity is gone, their family will definitely regain their luck!With her mother's brain cells, if she didn't break things down, the two of them will talk for a lifetime and not reach the same point.So Xiao Qiao went straight in: \"Mom, have you ever thought about divorcing my dad?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDivorce?Fang Xiao Juan had never thought about it.Although she didn't like Qiao Zhen Jun's silent character and hated that he always protects that calamity, Da Qiao, divorce was impossible. Not happening in this life.Now they were propagating that women can hold up half of the sky. Divorces were occurring in the city. But who within ten miles and eight villages would?If she dared to get a divorce, her old mother would dare to beat her with a rolling pin until she couldn't get out of bed for three days and three nights.Besides, where will she live after the divorce?A married-out daughter was thrown out water. Her maternal family will definitely not take her in. It can't be that she'll sleep on the street?So she was shocked for a long time before she looked at Xiao Qiao with weird eyes: \"Jiao Jiao'er, why would you ask such a question? It can't be that you want your mom to divorce your dad? How could you think this?!\"Seeing that her mom looked like she wanted to eat people, Xiao Qiao realized that she was too impatient.People in this era, no matter how hard and tired they were, they won't easily divorce. If she wanted her mom to get a divorce, she had to make a long-term plan. Moreover, she hadn't found a suitable next home, so let's talk about it later.Thinking of this, she lowered her head, circled her toes on the ground, and whispered in a soft voice: \"Elder Sister asked me this before. Elder Sister...she seems to want Mom to divorce Dad.\"Fang Xiao Juan immediately exploded like a poked balloon. She flushed with anger: \"That damn calamity, that cursed star, that money-wasting thing. I knew she was playing tricks!\"She was saying, why would her Jiao Jiao'er ask this kind of question. Black-hearted thing! A small thing with huge petty eyes. She induced Xiao Qiao to make her divorce Qiao Zhen Jun!Did she think that she wouldn't have to be kicked out of the house this way?Dream on!\"Jiao Jiao'er, remember to stay away from that calamity in the future. Don't let her bad luck ruin you!\" Fang Xiao Juan harrumphed angrily.\"Okay. I listen to Mom.\" Xiao Qiao tilted her head slightly. Looking so pure and innocent. as well as obedient and pretty.Fang Xiao Juan saw looking so cute and caring, the anger in her heart instantly disappeared. She hugged her precious and called my baby.\u2014\u2014The clouds were very low, making the sky was gray. The withered grass in the field was covered in frost. The cold made people's teeth tremble.Qiao Family\u2019s small courtyard squeaked. The door of the firewood room on the far right was opened. Da Qiao stretched out half of her head from within. The cold air in the morning rushed towards her face, making her shiver and sneeze.She let out a breath, rubbed her cold hands, and ran to the yard in one go. She picked up the broom and started to sweep seriously.Once the small courtyard was cleaned up, her little fleshy face, which has grown a little bit because of eating well and sleeping well these days, was flushed red. The morning light came out from the thick clouds and hit her face. Her fluffy hair seems to be coated with a layer of golden light.After cleaning the yard, she ran into the kitchen and took out a sweet potato from the rag bag on the ground. She washed it, peeled it, cut it into small pieces, grabbed two handfuls of coarse grains, and boiled them together. Then the sweet potato peels were chopped up and taken out to feed the chicken.The old hen hadn't laid eggs for five days.Since her dad was paralyzed, he often stared at the roof in a daze. He might not say a single word all day long. The past few days, he had become more silent and eaten less food.She wanted to make some delicious food for her dad so that her dad would get better soon. But GU Gu wouldn't lay eggs. She was getting anxious.She poured the chopped sweet potato peels into the chicken coop. Her voice was soft and waxy: \"Gu Gu, we, discuss. I, give, you, good, thing, to, eat, and, you, be good, and, lay eggs, OK?\"The old hen clucked and ate happily.Da Qiao's small mouth curled. Her eyebrows curved: \"Then I, take, it, you, promised,?\"\"Gu Gu.\"When she finished washing her clothes and drying them out, the sun had fully risen. She filled two bowls of porridge and brought them into her dad's room. The father and daughter ate it with pickled veg.Qiao Zhen Jun looked at Da Qiao. Several times, he wanted to open his mouth but stopped.Fang Xiao Juan had gone back to her maternal home for more than five days this time. In the past, she often threw a tantrum and he can still go to pick her up. But now...He knew that Fang Xiao Juan wanted to use this to force him to submit. But he really couldn't do it.Da Qiao was only six years old. If she was really kicked out, what was the difference between killing her directly?Da Qiao looked up and saw her dad staring at her blankly. There was more than half of the porridge in the bowl. She tilted her head and asked, \"Dad, not, eating?\"\"Dad is full. You eat more.\" Qiao Zhen Jun moved his hands to pour the porridge into her bowl.Da Qiao hurriedly clutched her bowl: \"Dad, eat. I, I'm full.\"Qiao Zhen Jun felt even more uncomfortable seeing the child being so caring and sensible.He was paralyzed now. Fang Xiao Juan disliked this child so much. And she stuttered too. What is this child to do in the future?Qiao Zhen Jun was so sad as if he was soaked in bitter water.Da Qiao didn\u2019t know what her dad was thinking. After breakfast, she was going to pick up some dead branches and rotten leaves in East Wood. The dry straw and wheat stalk at home was running out. It won\u2019t last a few days.She let her dad know and prepared to go out with the basket on her back.Qiao Zhenjun shouted from the room: \"Be careful, don't go too far.\"\"I, know!\"There wasn't much work in the winter. After doing housework in the morning, women liked to sit in the doorway as they basked in the sun and sew the soles of their shoes while they gossiped about other families.When Da Qiao passed by with a basket on her back, she was grabbed by Song Jin Li's wife: \"Oh, isn't this Da Qiao? Has your mom come back?\"Da Qiao's hand hurt from her grab. She wanted to pull her hand back, but Song Jin Lai's wife held it tightly: \"Ha, haven't, come back.\"\"My God, it's been almost six days. Why hasn't she come back? Isn't your mom trying to divorce your dad and won't come back?\" Song Jin Lai's wife exaggerated.Da Qiao's face turned white all at once.She knew what divorce meant. One time when her mom quarreled with her dad, she threatened to divorce.Gou Dan's mother joined in on scaring her: \"Let Auntie explain to you. If your mom really divorces your dad, she will definitely not want you. She will only take your sister Xiao Qiao away!\"Song Jin lai's wife became more energized: \"Poor thing. If they really divorce, what will happen to you and your dad? Your dad is paralyzed and you stutter. Who would dare to marry you in the future?\"Da Qiao tried hard to withdraw her hand. Her small face flushed red.Lin Hui returned from picking up the dead branches from East Wood and came across this scene. She sternly shouted: \"Enough you guys! Don't you feel guilt, saying this to a six-year-old child?\"Gou Dan's mother and Song Jin Lai's wife were startled. Da Qiao took the opportunity to break free and ran behind Lin Hui to hide.Song Jin Lai\u2019s wife saw clearly who the incoming person was and almost poked her face with her hand: \"As if you need to be nosy! If you have this time, why don't you find a father for your Dong Lin?\"Lin Hui was the youngest daughter of Lin Da Fa, the head of the village. A few years ago, she married an educated youth in the village. The two gave birth to a son. Two years ago, the male educated youth returned to the city and never came back.At first, they thought that the male educated youth must have abandoned his wife and son. But later they realized that he was gone. He fell into the river and drowned. Lin Hui suddenly became a widow.Song Jin Lai\u2019s wife\u2019s words were too piercing. Lin Hui\u2019s fingers trembled with anger: \"If you don\u2019t feel bad, let\u2019s go to Aunt Xiu Zhi now to see if she thinks I\u2019m nosy. Or would she slap you to death. !\"Qiao Xiu Zhi was an extremely protective person. Although she didn't care much about this granddaughter, Da Qiao, she would be dead set on slapping the outsider's teeth to the ground if they dare to bully Qiao Family.Song Jin Lai's wife's eyelids trembled: \"My chickens haven't been fed yet, so I don't have time to talk with you!\"After finishing talking, she turned around and ran away like a ghost was chasing her.Gou Dan's mother's feet felt slippery: \"I'm going to feed the chicken too.\"Lin Hui spat toward their backs. She turned around to see red marks on Da Qiao's hands and became furious. Why didn't God punish these jabbering women? They actually said that to a six-year-old child.For fear of frightening Da Qiao, she suppressed her anger and said softly: \"Does it hurt? Come to Aunt Hui's house now. Aunt Hui will give you the medicinal wine and rub it.Da Qiao waved her hand quickly: \"Thank, you, Aunt, Hui. It, doesn't, hurt.\"She liked Aunt Hui very much.Not only did Aunt Hui looked pretty, but she also treated her well. She often secretly stuff cornbread for her to eat. Aunt Hui\u2019s Family's Brother Dong Lin was also very cute. When he smiles, his toothy grin was revealed. He always followed her and called her Eldest Sister in his baby tone.Lin Hui noticed that her small face was more fleshy than before. Internally, she didn't know whether to be happy or sad for her: \"Why did you run out here alone?\"Da Qiao pointed to the forest in front, and said softly: \"Go, pick up, dead, branches.\"Lin Hui untied her basket and poured the dead branches into the basket behind Da Qiao without any hesitation.\"No, can't...do...\" Da Qiao was anxious. Her stammer became worst.\"Take it, Aunt Hui can just go in and pick more later. You should go back quickly. Don't make you...dad worry.\" Lin Hui didn't allow her to refuse. There was a slight pause when she spoke of her dad.Da Qiao didn't notice her abnormality. Her delicate brows were tightly frowned, like two little caterpillars.Lin Hui knew that she was afraid of causing trouble for her. Her heart softened.She stretched out her hand and rubbed her fluffy hair as she whispered softly: \"Be good. Obediently take it. Once you grow up, help Aunt Hui then, okay?\"Da Qiao tilted her head and thought for a while. She felt it wasn't a bad idea. So she smiled widely: \"Okay, in the, future, I help, Aunt Hui, do, housework.\"In fact, when she wasn't nervous or anxious, the stuttering situation will improve as long as she spoke slowly. But at home, her mother was too impatient to listen to her and always showed a look of disgust. How can she not be nervous?After seeing Da Qiao and Lin Hui left, Song Jin Lai's wife ran out of the house, and spat toward Lin Hui's back: \"Pah. What does she think she is? Climbing up this old lady's head!\"Gou Dan's mother heard the movement and came out as well. She stirred the chicken food in her hand: \"Be careful, she might turn around and run to Aunt Xiu Zhi to tell on you!\"Song Jinlai's wife's face became fierce: \"She dares! If she really dared to file a complaint, I will sing out that she likes old Second Qiao. Let's see who loses face more!\"\"Heaven, can't be true? You mean Lin Hui likes old Second Qiao?\" Goog Dan's mother appeared excited.Song Jin Lai's wife's chin pointed high. She was feeling extremely proud: \"Otherwise, why do you think she is so good to that calamity, Da Qiao? She still misses old Second Qiao. That woman was very flirty! Back then...\"Speaking of this kind of love gossip, Gou Dan's mother didn't bother to feed the chicken and listened to Song Jin Lai's wife shoot her mouth off.After separating from Aunt Hui, Da Qiao did not go home immediately. Instead, she walked towards Fang's house in the north of the village with a basket on her back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Which was opposite of Qiao's house, which was at the south. She had been there once in total because her mom didn't like to take her back.She encountered a lot of villagers along the way. She smiled sweetly at everyone. Everyone knew that she stuttered and didn't mind that she didn't greet them.Once she reached the north of the village, she saw Xiao Qiao surrounded by a group of children.Xiao Qiao was beautiful and a well-known child prodigy. The children in the village liked her very much.Da Qiao looked on enviously. She usually had to housework. On top of that, she stuttered. So she had never played with the fellow children.One child saw her. He immediately yelled: \"Look, everyone, Stutterer is here!\"A few children ran over, clapped their hands, and sang children's rhyme around her: \" Little Stutterer, plays with frogs. She picked up a melon, sold it for a dime. She ran home in a hurry and fell flat on her face! Fell flat on her face! Hahaha...\"There were no such children rhyme in the village before. It was only circulated in the past two years. Nobody knew where this rhyme came from.Da Qiao's small hands tightly tugged at the corners of her clothes. Her face flushed.Xiao Qiao tilted her head. A sweet smile hung on her mouth as she admired Da Qiao's embarrassment.The 'Little Stutterer' children's rhyme was adapted from a children's rhyme in her previous life. She also secretly got other to spread it.Da Qiao was born with the stutter. It was just her mom treated her like a treasure in her previous life. Whoever dared to laugh at her stuttering, she would fight them hard. Afterward, she went to the hospital to find a doctor to help her fix it. So Da Qiao's stutter was treated her before the age of six.In this life, she lost her mother's affection. Coupled with her constantly mocking around her which made her feel more inferior, her stuttering naturally became more and more worst.After appreciating enough, she walked over and said softly to everyone: \"My sister is born with the stutter. It can't be cured in this life, so don't laugh at her.\"\"If it can't be cured for a lifetime, wouldn't that mean you will be little stutterer for a lifetime?\"\"You were wrong. When young, it's little stutterer. When she grows up, it's big stutterer. When old, old stutterer, hahaha...\"Da Qiao blushed even more. She was so embarrassed that she didn't know where to put her hands and feet.\"You guys are too bad. I won't talk to you anymore!\" Xiao Qiao stamped her feet, turned her head, and smiled sweetly at Da Qiao: \"Elder Sister, why are you here?\"Seeing the sweet smile on Xiao Qiao\u2019s face, Da Qiao breathed a sigh of relief: \"Sister, when, will, you, you, and mom, go back, home?\"Xiao Qiao's pretty eyebrows frowned: \"Mom said you are a calamity and will kill us. If you don't leave the house, she will never go back.\"\"What do you mean by calamity?\" Some of the younger children asked ignorantly.\"I know, I know. My mom said Da Qiao is a plague god. Whoever approaches her is unlucky!\" Song Da Bao shouted loudly.Song Da Bao was Song Jin Lai\u2019s eldest son. He normally heard his mother muttered that Da Qiao was a calamity star at home. Naturally, he would remember.When the other children heard Song Da Bao's words, they immediately ran far far away, as if Da Qiao was a plague. They feared that they would be contaminated by her if they got close.Da Qiao's small hands tightly tugged at the corners of her clothes. Her eyes reddened.Seeing Da Qiao's uncomfortable appearance, Xiao Qiao felt even more refreshed than eating ice cream on the hottest summer days.If it weren't for Da Qiao in her previous life, she wouldn't have been a fool for more than a few decades. She made her so miserable. In this life, she will definitely repay all the pain she had experienced in this life!When she was just born in this life, her mother didn't really hate Da Qiao so much. It had to wait until she can move. She would often pinch Da Qiao into tears.Her mother had to take care of the two children alone as well as doing housework. She overloaded with work. Seeing that Da Qiao was so delicate, she was naturally very annoyed.But this was not enough. She often woke up in the middle of the night and secretly opened Da Qiao\u2019s quilt. This caused her to get cold. The family owed a lot of money for her to see a doctor. Gradually, her mother disliked her even more.Later, when she could speak, she secretly spread the fact that Da Qiao was a calamity star. This way, her mother was completely disgusted with Da Qiao.\"Elder Sister, go back first. Don't worry. I will persuade Mom to go home.\" Xiao Qiao tilted her head and smiled sweetly. Looking cute and sweet.Da Qiao was very grateful to her sister for helping her: \"Sister, sister, you're, really, good!\"Xiao Qiao smiled sweeter when she heard this.At this moment, one large and one small child ran over. They were holding a fish with red and white markings in their hands.The two children were called Fang You Liang and Fang You Rou. They were Da Qiao's maternal uncle, Fang Fu Gui's sons. One was eight years old and the other was four years old.Fang You Liang ran up to Xiao Qiao and panted. Before he could speak, he noticed Da Qiao. He immediately glared: \"Little Stutterer, why are you here? Did you come here to bully Sister Xiao Qiao?\"Fang You Rou childishly nodded his head in agreement: \"Did you?\"Da Qiao shook her head like a rattle: \"No, no, I, I have, haven't...\"\"I don't think you dare. If you dare to bully Sister Xiao Qiao, I will punch you!\" Fang You Liang showed her his fist.Fang You Rou parroted: \"Punch you!\"Only then, Xiao Qiao opened her mouth: \"Cousin, didn't you go catch fish? Why come back so soon?\"Fang You Liang immediately showed the fish in his hand like a treasure: \"Sister Xiao Qiao, look. Isn't this fish pretty?\"The fish in Fang You Liang's hand didn't reach half the size of his palm. The fish was different from the usual fish. Its scales seemed to glow. When the sun shines, it gave a gold shimmer. Extremely beautiful!The other children saw the fish in Fang You Liang's hand and gathered around again.\"So beautiful That fish shines!\"\"This is the first time I have seen a glowing fish!\"\"Me too. Me too.\"Even Da Qiao's eyes fixated on the fish. Her eyes filled with surprise.Xiao Qiao's interest was lacking.The fish was a gold and silver scale koi. Before she transmigrated into the book, not only did she often saw it on the Internet but also raised one herself. So it wasn't unusual for her at all.But she didn't show it. She tilted her head and exclaimed sweetly: \"What a beautiful fish! Where did Elder Cousin catch it?\"Fang You Liang saw everyone looking at him and puffed proudly: \"This was caught in the rear brook. Sister Xiao Qiao, do you like it? Elder brother will give it to you!\"He likes this cousin Xiao Qiao very much. She looked so fair and smiled so sweetly. Unlike other girls in the village.What's more, Cousin was very clever. She was a little prodigy. The school teacher often mentioned her. Because of this little prodigy cousin, he had face in front of his friends.\"Thank you, cousin, I like it very much.\" Xiao Qiao smiled sweetly and was about to pick up the fish, but she caught Da Qiao staring at the koi unblinkingly. She raised her eyebrows slightly, \"Elder Sister, you like this fish a lot?\"Da Qiao nodded.She had never seen such a beautiful fish before. She didn't know if it was her illusion. She kept having a feeling that the fish was looking at her.The fish was out of the water. Its mouth closed and opened. A lot of scales fell off its body. It looked like it was injured. She thought it was very pitiful.She blushed and pointed her finger together: \"Sister, can, you, give, this, fish, to, me?\"\"Why would I want to give it to you? Shameless, scram!\" Fang You Liang pushed Da Qiao.Da Qiao stumbled back a few steps and almost fell to the ground.Fang You Rou followed along and waved his small fist: \"Scram!\"This was the first time Xiao Qiao saw Da Qiao ask for something. At home, even when she was so hungry until her stomach protest, she wouldn't open her mouth to ask for something to eat.Unexpectedly, she opened her mouth for a fish today.Interesting.If it was someone else, she would give it to them. But this was Da Qiao. She won't let her get her wish!She frowned and acted like she was in a difficult spot: \"Sister, this fish belongs to Elder Cousin, I can't call the shots.\"Da Qiao pursed her small mouth sadly. She waved a small hand: \"No, it's, it's okay.\"Xiao Qiao stared at her face for a while before tilting her head: \"In fact, if your sister really likes it, you can exchange something with Elder Cousin.\"\"What, what, thing?\" Da Qiao looked puzzled.Xiao Qiao had yet to answer when Fang You Liang expressed his displeasure first: \"Why give to a little stutterer? Look how poor she is. What good things can she take out?\"Xiao Qiao's voice was soft: \"Elder Cousin, don't you really want to eat sweets? If Elder Sister can take out sweets or exchange money with you, give it to your sister, OK?\"In this era, everyone didn't have enough to fill their stomachs, let alone snacks. But as children, there were always times when they have cravings.Fang You Liang couldn\u2019t help but feel a little moved when he heard this: \"It depends on what she can bring out?\"Da Qiao felt embarrassed. She felt her pocket but could only take out a penny. This was given to her by Grandfather the day before yesterday.Fang You Liang snatched the money and muttered in dissatisfaction \"Want to change my fish for only a penny. Dream on!\" The money wasn't returned to Da Qiao.Fang You Rou: \"Dream on!\"Xiao Qiao saw that Da Qiao didn't take out anything of value and felt relieved in the end. She was afraid that their grandparents would treat her nicely when she was away.She pulled Da Qiao aside and whispered: \"Elder Sister, do you really want that fish?\"Da Qiao nodded her head heavily.\"Since Elder Sister wants it so much, then I will help Elder Sister this time. Later, I'll lie to Elder Cousin that the fish is poisonous and get him to throw it into the ditch. You can pick it up after everyone leaves.\"Sister...\" Sister was so kind to her. Da Qiao felt had the urge to sniff her nose.Turning her head, Xiao Qiao said, \"Elder Cousin, Elder Sister wants to make a bet with you. She said that as long as you dare to throw the fish into the dung pit, she dares to pick the fish out from the dung pit. Elder Cousin, do you dare?\"A man's respect can't allow provocation, even when he's a child.Fang You Liang glared at Da Qiao. his neck slanted: \"Fine, we'll go. What is there to be afraid of!\"Da Qiao:? ? ?\"Everyone, follow me!\" Fang You Liang waved his hand and wildly ran towards the east of the village.The call received a response. The children yelled and followed.Xiao Qiao blinked misty eyes: \"Elder Cousin said he'll throw the fish into the dung pit. I can't persuade him. Elder Sister, how about forgetting about the fish.\"Da Qiao blinked and shook her head: \"I, want, it!\"Looking at Da Qiao's running figure, Xiao Qiao chuckled softly.She knew that she would not give up easily. She was like this in her previous life.However, the pit-trap in West Wood failed to kill her last time. This time, let's see if she can continue to be so lucky!Withdrawing her smile, she moved her leg to follow.At this time, in the east of the village, Song Jin Lai's entrance door was tightly closed.Qiao Xiu Zhi slapped the door with her palm. The wooden door swayed: \"Song Jin Lai's wife, open the door! I know you are at home. If you don\u2019t open the door, then do you not want this door anymore?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her legs felt weak.She didn't expect that loose woman, Lin Hui would really file a complaint.She wanted to dig a pit and bury herself now!Old Madam Song heard the noise and rushed over from the next room with a rolling pin: \"You prodigal woman. Were you talking nonsense outside again?\"Her eldest daughter-in-law got a wicked. And it wasn't like old Madam Song never taught her a lesson about that. Because of her mouth, she didn't know how many good words she had to compensate.She had beaten and scolded her, but this prodigal woman only remembered the eat, not the beat. No matter how she promised at the time, she'll turn around and continue to talk nonsense!Song Jin Lai's wife received a whack on her calf. The pain caused her tears to come down: \"Mom, stop hit. I don't know why Aunt Xiu Zhi came to find me!\"\"You don't know? Then why didn't she find someone else, but you? It must be you who said something outside. You go out and apologize now!\"\"Don't, mom. It's better that you hit me. I won't go out!\" Song Jin Lai's wife became weak when she thought of how Aunt Xiu Zhi KOed a wild boar.She would rather be beaten by her mother-in-law than go out to face Aunt Xiu Zhi.Too frightening!\"Bang\"!The poor wooden door of Song Family finally couldn't hold it and fell down with a bang.The villagers didn\u2019t mind adding to the chaos. They roared: \"The door is down! the door is down!\"Seeing that her door was knocked down by Qiao Xiu Zhi, old Madam Song's face was as black as the bottom of the pot. The rolling pin in her hand struck without any more words.It was so painful, Song Jin Lai's wife howled and jumped into the yard to hide.Song Jin Lai's wife was plump. She belongs to the category that can get fat by drinking cold water. At this moment she wasn't as clumsy as a chubby person should have. She was jumping up and down like a flexible fatty.Everyone watched the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law chased after each other. Their stomachs hurt with laughter.In the end, old Madam Song was old. So after a while of chasing, she panted and huffed: \"You prodigal woman. I'll get Eldest take care of you tonight!\"Song Jin Lai's wife's flesh tightened again.After scolding her daughter-in-law, what should be solved still had to be solved. Wasn't Qiao Xiu Zhi blocking the door like a door god?If she doesn't send her away properly today, it won't be just the wooden door. It might be the entire Song family getting torn down by her!She walked to the door, said with a forced smile, \"Xiu Zhi, what brings you here?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi snorted: \"Your eldest daughter-in-law is going everywhere, saying that my second boy is going to get a divorce. So I just want to ask, why, I, his mother, didn't know that they are going to get a divorce. How did she know?\"Old Madam Song gritted her teeth fiercely from anger. She turned her head and pointed at her eldest daughter-in-law and cursed: \"Prodigal woman! Everything is said by you. You are so capable. Why don't you ascend to heaven!\"Turning back, she apologized to Qiao Xiu Zhi: \"Xiu Zhi, you also know how rubbish my eldest daughter-in-law's mouth is. Later, I must beat her until she got to find her teeth on the floor!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi said with a cold face: \"She also scared my eldest granddaughter, Da Qiao. Saying that my second son is paralyzed and that she got stutter No one will marry her when she grows up. She said this to a six-year-old child! Does she still have a conscience? I think her conscience was eaten by a do.g Simply worse than an animal!\"\"I say Song Jin Lai's wife, you are too much. How old is Da Qiao? And you say this to her. Aren't you afraid of retribution to your child in the future?\"\"That's right. If someone dares to say this to my child, I will use my old life to fight. I won't let the other person fare well!\"Everyone pointed at Song Jin Lai's wife, thinking that she was overboard this time. Even if she told the truth, she shouldn't say such things to a six-year-old child.Song Jin Lai's wife flushed from the crowd's comment. She had to bear the daggered gazes shot from her mother-in-law from time to time.Suddenly, her brain flashed, and she yelled: \"Gou Dan's mother also said that. Why are you only scolding me?\"Gou Dan's mother was lying at the window and eavesdropping. Out of nowhere, she was stabbed by Song Jin Lai's wife. She rushed out and yelled: \"You're talking nonsense! Talking nonsense! Heaven should come and strike you with lightning!\"Song Jin Lai's wife stepped forward with hands on her hip and glared, \"I'm talking nonsense? Do you think Lin Hui will forget about you when she complains? Dream on! If Heaven strikes, it will definitely hit you with me!\"Gou Dan's mother was so angry that her chest hurts: \"I just said one sentence! Unlike you. One second,\u00a0 you say Fang Xiao Juan is going to divorce old Second Qiao. Next second, saying Da Qiao can't get married. Then it's Lin Hui stealing. ...\"\"Both of you shut your mouth!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi grabbed the rolling pin from old Madam Song's hand and snapped it lightly.With a \"crack\", the rolling pin became two pieces.Everywhere became silent.Many people hadn't witness Qiao Xiu Zhi one-hit kill the wild boar with their own eyes. At this moment, seeing her breaking the rolling pin that was an arm thick, no one dare to exhale heavily.Qiao Xiu Zhi threw the rolling pin back to the old Madam Song: \"I don't care whether who say more or less. I'm asking you, how will this be settled?\"Old Madam Song looked at the rolling pin that had been broken in half. Her teeth ached.She glared fiercely at her eldest daughter-in-law. She went back to the house and took three eggs out and stuffed them into Qiao Xiu Zhi's hands: \"That prodigal woman had wrong your Qiao family in this matter. Look upon my face, spare her this time. .\"Qiao Xiu Zhi stuffed the egg into her pocket and raised her toward Gou Dan's mother.Gou Dan's mother's flesh ached for a while.However, no matter how much her flesh ached, what must be given got to be given. In the end, she went to her room and took two eggs out.As for why there were only two eggs, it was because she felt that she said less, so she had to take one less.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't mind and left with five eggs.Song family suffered heavy losses. As soon as Qiao Xiu Zhi left, chicken flew and dogs jumped in Song's house.When Qiao Xiu Zhi passed the public toilet with the five eggs, she noticed a group of children noisily rushing over. They were followed by her two granddaughters, Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao.When Fang You Liang darted to her front, she stretched out her hand, grabbed him by the collar, and lifted him up like a chicken.Fang You Liang felt that this gesture damaged his child king's respect and his face flushed: \"Let go of me. Let me go!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi said: \"Are you bullying my granddaughter?\"Seeing Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao chasing behind with red faces, Qiao Xiu Zhi subconsciously thought that Fang You Liang had bullied them.To be precise, bullied Da Qiao. After all, she had heard of how much Fang Family liked Xiao Qiao, the child prodigy.Fang Youliang struggled until his whole face and ear were red: \"I didn't! Da Qiao said she wanted to bet with me. She said that if I dared to throw this fish into the dung pit, she would dare to go down and pick it up!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi: \"...\"What a terrible thing!\"If you don't believe me, you can ask Da Qiao!\"\"Grandmother?\" Da Qiao was also surprised when she saw Qiao Xiu Zhi. Her little face was flushed from running. It looked much better than her previous sallow look.Before Qiao Xiu Zhi could speak, Fang You Liang yelled: \"Little Stutterer, tell your grandmother, you make a bet with me, right?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi flicked her finger on Fang You Liang's forehead: \"I hear you call Little Stutterer again, see how I'll sort you out!\"Fang You Liang cried out in pain. If it weren't for other children being present, he would definitely cry.Da Qiao's eyes shone. She looked at her grandmother with admiration.Since she understood things, she had been called Little Stutterer. Her mother called her this as well. Her dad is a solemn gourd and wouldn't quarrel with others at all. This was the first time someone had defended her like this!Xiao Qiao tilted her head and showed a sweet smile: \"Grandmother, Elder Cousin is joking with Elder Sister. Elder Sister has taken a fancy to the fish in his cousin's hands, so she bet with Elder Cousin.\"Da Qiao glanced at her sister in confusion. She didn't bet with Fang You Liang.Qiao Xiu Zhi took in Da Qiao's reaction. How could she not understand?She swept a glance at Xiao Qiao: \"You just helped outsiders to bully your sister like this?\"Xiao Qiao was stunned for a moment. Then she gritted her teeth with hatred.In this life, she had won at the starting line from the beginning. She can speak at seven months old, walk at one year old, write her name at two, and was already a well-known little prodigy at four.The villagers within the seven villages liked her very much, except for her grandmother.As the head of Qiao Family, her grandmother was someone she wanted to please. But the other party didn't buy it. Even when she became a child prodigy, she didn't give her any extra attention. This made her vexed!Of course, her grandmother didn't care about Da Qiao before, so she didn't care. Why did she just leave for five days and she protects Da Qiao that much?Did something she didn't know happen?When Da Qiao saw his sister being scolded by Qiao Xiu Zhi, he immediately explained: \"Grandmother, sister, didn't, bully, me. Sister, help, me.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi patted her on the head: \"With your foolish brain, you'll still count the money for the person who sold you! Say, what do you want the fish for?\"\"Look, pretty.\" Da Qiao's small hands grabbed the corner of her clothes and looked at her with a pair of black and bright eyes. Water glistened in her eyes.Looking from Qiao Xiu Zhi's angle, she could just see her slightly curled eyelashes trembling slightly.Who can stand up to such a pair of eyes?Qiao Xiu Zhi turned her head and said, \"I'll exchange an egg for this fish, how's that?\"What else can she do?Of course, he was willing!This fish was so small. There was no meat on it. Besides, this fish wasn't delicious. How can it be compared with an egg?As for throwing it into the shit pit, he was just stimulated at the time. Now there was an egg, everything can be discussed!Fang You Liang handed the fish over immediately.Qiao Xiu Zhi wasn't coaxing him either. She took out an egg from her pocket.Immediately, Fang You Liang overjoyed like it was the New Year. He bolted home with an egg without care.\"Brother, wait for me!\" Fang You Rou, the bro-con, walked with his short legs\u00a0to catch up.Qiao Xiu Zhi stuffed the half-dead fish to Da Qiao. Then she took out two more eggs and put them in her pocket.\"Tha, thanks, Grandmother!\" Da Qiao held the fish. Her face flushed with excitement.\"Hurry home with the things. If you break the egg, see how I'll beat you later!\"After Qiao Xiu Zhi finished speaking, she turned around and left without even looking at Xiao Qiao. She didn't plan to give her an egg,Xiao Qiao watched Qiao Xiu Zhi's back, feeling like a seasoning bottle had overturned in her heart. The favor was mixing.She didn't expect that stutterer Da Qiao would be able to enter her grandmother's eye!But soon, she smiled in relief again.What's the use of that? After two years, her grandmother will die with her grandfather, Xue Chuan.Speaking of this, this woman was weird. She didn't love her children or grandchildren. She only loved\u00a0her married-in-husband, Xue Chuan.In the last life, her grandfather suddenly fell deeply ill two years later. Although her grandmother took good care of him, he was still passed away. Less than half an hour after he was, her grandmother followed.Still, she was still curious. Why did her grandmother suddenly be so good to Da Qiao?She poked her fingers together and made an aggrieved expression: \"Elder Sister, does grandmother dislike me?\"Da Qiao had been watching the departing back of her grandmother When she heard Xiao Qiao's words, she came back to her senses: \"No, Grandmother, like, you.\"Xiao Qiao was beautiful and smart. She smiled sweetly. Everyone liked her.Xiao Qiao was very dissatisfied with her perfunctory response: \"But Grandmother didn't give me eggs!\"Da Qiao thought she was aggrieved due to not getting eggs. She immediately took out an egg from her pocket: \"Sister, here!\"Xiao Qiao accepted the egg without hesitation and asked, \"Elder Sister, why is Grandmother so nice to you all of a sudden?\"Da Qiao naively giggled, \"No, idea.\"Xiao Qiao felt that Da Qiao was deliberately concealing it. She was even more displeased.Her eyes spun and her gaze landed on her other pocket: \"Sister, Mom hasn't eaten eggs for a long time. I will help you send the egg back to Mom. Mom will definitely be happy to know that you miss her!\"Da Qiao's face showed that she was put on the spot.Xiao Qiao raised his eyebrows: \"Elder Sister, you don't\u00a0want to?\"Da Qiao touched the egg in her pocket and whispered: \"I want, to give, to dad, to eat,...\"If she had a lot of eggs, she was willing to give them to her mother. But now there was only one left. Gu Gu hadn't laid eggs for five days. She wanted to nourish her dad's body so that he can get better soon.At that time, Qiao Zhen Jun hit the rock to protect Da Qiao. But in order not to make the child sad and to prevent Fang Xiao Juan from blaming the child, he kept this secret in his heart and didn't tell anyone.After that, he didn't tell the child his condition, so Da Qiao always thought that her father would get better after a while.Xiao Qiao snorted: \"No wonder Mom doesn't like you. Elder Sister, you are a white-eyed wolf!\"Da Qiao dropped her head uncomfortably.Still, she didn't take out the egg.Unable to get the egg, Xiao Qiao turned away with a cold face.Unexpectedly, after she took two steps, one foot stepped on something soft.She looked down and her face was completely black.She stepped on poo!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xiao Qiao stepped on poo!\"Xiao Qiao's face was completely flushed. She was so furious!Da Qiao was startled when she heard her sister's cry: \"Sister, what, happen?\"She ran over to take a look. Her delicate little nose wrinkled.Aiya, half of her sister's shoes was dipped in the poo. It smelled so bad. No wonder her sister was so angry.Xiao Qiao's face was dark. She stretched her shoes toward Da Qiao and said it as if was natural: \" Elder Sister, help me clean the shoe!\"Da Qiao was taken aback for a moment.Xiao Qiao's face immediately sank when she saw that Da Qiao didn't agree.Just when she wanted to threaten Da Qiao, Qiao Xiu Zi, who had left, suddenly returned: \"Da Qiao, why have you not returned home? Your dad is home alone. Can't drink a glass of water, since no one is there to pour it for him. Don't you feel guilty? Not learning the good. Instead, learning from those white-eyed wolves! Still not hurrying along?\"Hearing Grandmother scold, Da Qiao didn't dare to delay any longer: \"Sister, you, wipe, it, yourself. I have, to go, home, now.\"After finishing speaking, she ran away with the basket on her back before Xiao Qiao could respond,.Xiao Qiao stared at the departing back of Da Qiao and puffed in angry like a pufferfish.Da Qiao ran to her grandmother, showed a shy smile to her, and let out a soft cry: \"Grandmother.\"Meeting her black eyes, Qiao Xiu Zhi's lecturing couldn't come out of her mouth, \"Didn't I tell you to go home earlier?\"\"Give, Sister, egg.\" Da Qiao did not dare to conceal the fact that she gave an egg to her sister.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't like Xiao Qiao, but she won't stop Da Qiao from giving her eggs.As for why she didn't like Xiao Qiao, the reason was simple...her eyes were too calculating.Everyone said Xiao Qiao was obedient and smart. She felt that kid was really smart, but she was more scheming than a white lotus!If she was really innocent and kind, she will not watch her own elder sister be hungry and become skinny, while she ate fine grains and eggs from time to time. She won't wear new clothes by herself and let her elder sister wear the old clothes she threw away a few years ago. When the shoe got several holes, she never lent a helping hand.Moreover, she had personally caught her smiling very sweetly one moment and the next, her face instantly turned into a look of contempt when others looked away. That behavior was completely unlike what a four-year-old child should do.It never came across Qiao Xiu Zhi that Xiao Qiao had been taken over by a ghost or the like. She only thought she gained early wisdom. Still, the child was too calculating, she can't make herself like her.Compared with her, Da Qiao was simply a silly fool. She would still help people count money after being sold!Just now, when she left, she suddenly felt a little uneasy halfway back. So she returned. That was when she heard Xiao Qiao asking Da Qiao to wipe off the poo.Sure enough, they were all troublemakers!One old and one small walked to the small courtyard of Qiao Family. Qiao Zhen Jun and his family had moved out and lived some distance from Qiao Family's old house. About ten minutes walk.Da Qiao arrived home first. She raised her face and looked at her grandmother. Her voice softly said: \"Grandmother, then, I, go in, now.\"The sun hit her face. Her complexion looked a little better than before. But compared to the other children in Qiao Family, she was still too thin. It made her eyes appeared surprisingly big.\"Wait a minute.\" Qiao Xiu Zhi stopped her. Then she took out an egg from her pocket and stuffed it with a fierce expression: \"Take it. If I find that you give the egg to someone else, see how I'll sort you out!\"Da Qiao was surprised by the doting. Still, she shook her head: \"Grandmother, eat. I, won't eat.\"\"I'm giving it to you, so take it. So noisy!\" Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't allow her to refuse. She placed the egg in her hand and turned to leave.She sassily walked away at a heroic pace.Grandmother is so nice!Da Qiao's bright eyes watched her grandmother gradually go away until her figure disappeared from sight and entered the small courtyard.She dug out a basin, filled it with water, and then carefully put the koi in it.The koi was dying. Even when it was put in the water, there was no sign of it reviving.Seeing that the fish wasn't moving, Da Qiao poked its head with tears in her big eyes: \"Little fish, don't, die.\"The tears fell into the water, making small ripples.A miracle happened at this time. The fish that had turned white belly up unexpectedly spat out a bubble!Da Qiao's face flushed red, and her eyes were bright: \"It's, alive!\"The fish spat out another bubble, turned its body over, and slowly started swimming in the water. Although it was very slow, it was alive.Da Qiao was very happy. She squatted in front of the wooden basin and watched for a while. Then she got up and went to the chicken coop to watch Gu Gu.She squatted down and touched Gu Gu's butt. She didn't find any eggs, nor did she feel any eggs in the hay. She pressed her mouth together and pointed at Gu Gu, \"Gu Gu, you, are, a bad, girl!\"\"Gu gu.\" The old hen didn't know what she was talking about, cooing joyfully.Da Qiao gave the old hen a round of lectures and then went to the kitchen to prepare lunch for her father.It wasn't the peak farming time. Most people ate two meals a day. Her dad must eat the Chinese medicine. Because he can\u2019t take medicine on an empty stomach, it became three meals a day. She also ate three meals a day these days. It resulted in her little face plumping up.At noon, it was still sweet potato porridge with pickle vegs. However, there was an addition of one egg. She only cooked one egg as she planned to cook the other egg tomorrow.Seeing the extra egg, Qiao Zhen Jun was surprised: \"Where did this egg come from? Did Gu Gu lay it?\"He knew that the old hen hadn't been laying eggs because Da Qiao would grumble about it to him every day.Da Qiao shook her head and said softly: \"Grandmother, gave, it.\"Qiao Zhen Jun pushed the egg over: \"You eat. Dad doesn't like eggs.\"Da Qiao shook her head again: \"Dad eat, it. Body, will, get better, faster.\"Qiao Zhen Jun felt sad when he heard the words.He was already paralyzed and will never get better in his life.Qiao Xiu Zhi returned to Qiao\u2019s old house. Qiao family's eldest daughter-in-law, Wan Chun Ju, rushed over: \"Mom, you are back! I'm going to cook lunch. Mom, give me the eggs.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi raised her brows impatiently: \"What egg? None!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi gave birth to three sons and two daughters in this life. Two daughters had married out and three sons at home had their own families.Eldest, Qiao Zhen Guo and his wife, Wan Chun Ju had one son and two daughters. Their son Qiao An Ping was the only male in the third generation of Qiao Family.Second was Qiao Zhen Jun. His wife was Fang Xiao Juan. The two couples gave birth to twin daughters, Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao.Qiao Zhen Min, the fifth child, was currently working as a temporary transporter in the town's supply and marketing cooperative. He was married to a town girl, Chen Qiao Qiao. They had been married for five years and have only one daughter.Wan Chun Ju instantly became anxious: \"Mom, didn't you just get five eggs from Song Family and Gou Dan's mother? How come there's none?\"Although Qiao Family's conditions were better than those of other families in the village, it wasn't farming peak time. The family can only drink porridge with pickles every day. It became so bland in her mouth, that birds can pop out.The old hen in the family was killing her. It hadn't laid an egg for half a month. According to her, a hen who can't lay eggs should be killed and eaten. But it wasn't the New Year yet, so this chicken can't be killed either.She heard her mother-in-law gotten five eggs from Song Family and Gou Dan's mother and had long made a plan.Of the five eggs, two were reserved for Father-in-law and one for An Ping. An Ping was the only grandson of Qiao Family. Of course, he can eat a whole one. The remaining two were to be used in scrambled eggs with tomatoes and scrambled eggs with chives. A hearty meal for everyone.Now that her mother-in-law says there are no eggs, how can she not worry?Qiao Xiu Zhi pushed her away: \"I gave Da Qiao and old Second four eggs. Don't think about the remaining one.\" Naturally, the remaining one was to nourish Xue Chuan's body.A bolt from the blue sky!It almost struck Wan Chun Ju into a faint: \"Mom, what did you say? You gave Da Qiao and old Second four eggs. Old Second's family had already separated off. Why did you give them so many eggs?\"Old Second had already moved out. What face did he have to take the eggs from the family?Also, as the only grandson of Qiao Family, An Ping couldn't eat an egg. Why could that calamity, Da Qiao eat an egg?Qiao Xiu Zhi's face suddenly became stern: \"The eggs belong to me. I can give them to whomever I want!\"\"That's not it, Mom. It's okay if us, adults don't eat, but An Ping is the only grandson of our Qiao family. How can you not leave him an egg?\"Wan Chun Ju felt aggrieved for her son. As the only grandson of Qiao Family, he should be spoiled no matter what. However, her mother-in-law only had Father-in-law in her eyes. Whatever delicious was given to Father-in-law first.In her opinion, they were already that old and were so affectionate all day. Have they no shame?She can forget it if was just giving it to Father-in-law as she, the daughter-in-law don't really have any say. But did it mean by giving it to old Second? They clearly already separated off. Why give them the eggs?Qiao Xiu Zhi was too lazy to deal with this idiot eldest daughter-in-law: \"Who told you that grandson will get preferential treatment? At Qiao's house, this old lady has the final say! Not satisfied? Endure it!Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi can be said to be the least biased toward son person in the entire Dong Feng Community. She was born with supernatural power and was the only one daughter in the family. She was raised as a boy since she was a child.After marrying Xue Chuan, she managed in and out of the house because of Xue Chuan's poor health. So she never felt that women were worse than men.Of the three sons, only Qiao Zhen Guo gave birth to a son. Old Second and old Fifth only had daughters. She wasn't anxious about it.No son?Just marry a son-in-law into the family. Just like her back then.Qiao Xiu Zhi wasn't patriarchal-minded. However, that wasn't what Wan Chun Ju thought.She felt that she gave birth to the only boy in Qiao Family. She was a great hero of Qiao Family. Her son was the golden block of Qiao Family. The whole family should hold them, mother and son high. But Mother-in-law didn't take it seriously. This poked Wan Chun Ju's heart.The more Wan Chun Ju thought about it, the more displeased she became. It was just that she didn't dare to stand up against her mother-in-law. Mother-in-law can kill a wild boar with a punch. If she stood up, wouldn't it be seeking death?Qiao Zhen Guo came back from the outside. His gaze swept across the pot-black face of Wan Chun Ju. He turned around and simply pretended that he hadn't seen it.Wan Chun Ju's face became darker: \"Did you not see I'm not happy?\"Qiao Zhen Guo froze for a moment, scratching his forehead, and responded, \"Which day have you been happy? Besides, your face is naturally as black as a black mountain pig. Who can tell if you are happy or unhappy?\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Wan Chun Ju almost vomited blood. What kind of man did she find? Only piss her off!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Old Second had separated off. Mom gave him the eggs. So what shall we eat?\"Qiao Zhen Guo glanced at her strangely: \"The eggs are Moms. Mom can give them to whomever she want. You have hands and feet and still want to take old peoples things. Is your heart blinded by lard?\"Wan Chun Ju gritted her teeth with anger: \"When did I say I want to take Mom's things? I'm just thinking how other people treat their grandsons as treasures. However, Mom doesn't treat An Ping well at all. As the only grandson of Qiao Family, An Ping doesn't even get a share of egg. Is this unreasonable?\"\"It's really unreasonable.\" Qiao Zhen Guo nodded in agreement.Wan Chun Ju became proud. But then she heard him continued: \"Come to think of it, you are to blame. Mom said the father is stupid, then one is stupid. The mother is stupid, the whole nest is stupid. You are stupid, so our son is also stupid. Mom dislikes stupid people the most. An Ping is as stupid as you. How could Mom like him?\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"She almost performed the act of dying on the spot!His mom's favoritism had nothing to do with her being stupid. Wait, who said she was stupid!Qiao Zhen Guo ignored his wife's black face and shook his head as he left.Wan Chun Ju was angry to death. She noisily and loudly worked away. Her mind kept thinking this can't continue on like this.Since Fang Xiao Juan returned to her maternal family, her man and her parent-in-laws took turns to take care of Qiao Zhen Jun. Money and effort was spent. Now even the food was taken away. What a big loss!Fang Xiao Juan was Qiao Zhen Jun's wife. Why did she get eat well and drink well at her maternal home, while they have to suffer and take care of Qiao Zhen Jun?This can't do. It can't go on like this. She had to think of a way to get Fang Xiao Juan come back!...Xiao Qiao stepped on poo. She wanted Da Qiao to clean it up for her, but unexpectedly Da Qiao was called away by her grandmother. She was so angry that she wanted to vomit blood!Her shoes were stained with poo. The smell was so disgusting that she wanted to throw them away!But the shoes were newly made. And she only took one pair of shoes to grandma's house. If the shoes were thrown away, she would have no shoes to wear.In the end, she used the egg given by Da Qiao to exchange for shoes with a little girl and told the other person to clean her shoes for her before bringing them back to her.Xiao Qiao walked towards Fang's house step by step, wearing shoes that had several holes and did not fit well. As she passed by production team leader, Wang Shui Sheng's house, she couldn't help but give it a few more glances.Speaking of this, there were only two families living in brick houses in the village. One was Qiao Family and the other was Wang Family.The five sons of Wang Family were tall. The eldest son, Wang Shui Sheng was the leader of the production team. Who in this village dare to disrespect Wang family?If anyone dared to oppose Wang Family, then the dirty and tiring work will belong to them when production team's work distributing time.Wang Family's old Third was even more remarkable. He joined the army early. It was heard that he was now a battalion commander in the army and was in charge of hundreds of people. The money he sent back every month was 40 yuan!Forty yuan! This was more than the county's workers' salary!However, workers have to eat and drink, and occasionally get sick. They would thank God if they can save ten yuan a month. Soldiers were raised by the state. Food and drink were managed by the state. Sickness was also treated by the state. That was to say, this whole forty yuan was completely saved!As for the other three sons of the Wang family. Old Second and old Fourth were both honest and friendly village people. They were strong and willing to work. Their wives were also good workers. Therefore, Wang Family was the first family in Qili Village to have a good life.And Wang Family's old Fifth?He wasn't a top diamond, but rather a carefree rat poo!Because he was the youngest, he was accustomed to being spoiled by Wang Family's old Madam since he was little. He became a lazy good-for-nothing who only knew to eat. In a year, he earned less than any woman.A few years ago, Wang Family's old Madam matched a high school student from the next village to be his wife. She thought it would make him settle down for a few years. Unexpectedly, that wife didn't have the blessing. She fell while washing clothes in the winter and died of heavy bleeding from labor. She left behind a baby boy waiting to be fed.Wang Family's old Madam wanted to find another wife for him. But which decent girl wants to be a stepmother?In addition, Wang Family's old Fifth's lazy temperament had been well-known to everyone in Dongfeng Community. One or two widows were willing to marry, but how can Wang Family's old Madam be willing!Therefore, Wang Family's old Wang remained a bachelor until now.As she was thinking about it, Wang's courtyard door was pushed open with a creak and a man walked out.The man with chicken coop hair that hadn't been washed for many days stretched out and yawned while digging earwax with his finger. His lips displayed a wicked smile.This man wasn't anyone else but Wang Xin Sheng, Wang Family's old Fifth.When Wang Xin Sheng saw Xiao Qiao, he grinned widely at her: \"Oh, isn't this our team's famous little prodigy? Little prodigy, recite two poems to listen to!\"Before Xiao Qiao could respond, he held his nose and cried out strangely: \"Why do you have a smell of sh*t on your body. It can't be that you sh*t on your pants?\"Xiao Qiao: \"...\"Faced with such a carefree person, Xiao Qiao just wanted to say that she didn't even want to talk him. Not even give him a full stop!She passed him with a cold face and walked two steps. Suddenly, her mind flashed and she remembered the book's storyline.The book said Wang Xin Sheng later married that widow, Lin Hui as his wife. Under Lin Hui's persuasion, Wang Xin Sheng changed himself and became a good husband and father. After the reforms, he became the first person to eat crabs in the village!Though Wang Xin Sheng looked like he was carefree, he was a master in communication and business. He later became the first ten-thousand-yuan-household in the village.Not only did Wang Xin Sheng become the first-ten-thousand-yuan household in the village, he was also the first person to move to the city. He bought several properties in the city and later caught up with the demolition. Instantly he became a major demolition household!If... If her mother were to divorce and marry Wang Xin Sheng, wouldn't she be a second generation rich? With her foresight of the future and Wang Xin Sheng's ability, she can make Wang Family richer!Xiao Qiao's eyes grew hotter the more she thought about it. As soon as this thought formed in her mind, she couldn't suppress it.She immediately turned around to greet Wang Xin Sheng. But when she looked back, where was he? Wang Xin Sheng ran away without a trace long ago!With a sigh, she continued to move forward.Once back at Fang's house, Fang Xiao Juan noticed that her shoes were different from the ones she went out with and hurriedly asked: \"Jiao Jiao'er, where are your shoes?\"Xiao Qiao blinked her plentiful eyelashes and said with red eyes: \"Elder Sister pushed me a bit. I couldn't stand still and stepped on poo. I had to change shoes with someone and wear theirs.\"Fang Xiao Juan directly broke out in scolding with her hands on her hips, \"Black-hearted thing. She wants to make you lose face! Do she think she can flip sky cause I'm not at home? I'll go back and whip her to death!\"Xiao Qiao hurriedly held her: \"Mom, forget it. Sister, she probably didn't mean it...\"She didn't dare to enlarge the matter. At that time, so many people saw her step on the feces. If it gets out, it would be difficult for her to fix it. More importantly, she was even more afraid of making her grandmother storm over.Fang Xiao Juan was angry and distressed: \"You are too kind. It's why that calamity ride on your head! Don't worry, Mom will find a way to drive her out of the house in these two days!\"If it had been before, Xiao Qiao would have been very happy to hear this. But after seeing Wang Xin Sheng, her mind changed.What she had to do now wasn't driving Da Qiao out of the house, but rather, find a way to persuade her mom to divorce and get her mom to hook up with Wang Xin Sheng. After the divorce, she will leave her dad to Da Qiao!A stutterer with a paralyzed father. She didn't believe that Da Qiao still has a chance to turn over in this life!Thinking of this, she raised her head and blinked misty eyes: \"Mom, if my sister is kicked out, who will do the housework? I could help, but my body is too bad. If not, I could do it. I can\u2019t let Mom to work in the field to the ground and do all the housework and take care of my dad. That way, Mom will be exhausted.\"She tilted her head slightly. Her fair appearance looked obedient and considerate.Fang Xiao Juan was stunned.She really didn't consider this issue seriously!Washing, cooking, cleaning the house, feeding chickens, picking wild vegetables and collecting firewood. Since Da Qiao was four years old, she had took on all these housework.On most days, she only needed to go to the field to do some light work and earn some work points. If she didn't want to go, she can ask for leave at any time. Anyway, Qiao Zhen Jun can earn work points to support the family.She had never thought that Qiao Zhen Jun would become paralyzed. Not only did she have to go to the field to earn whole-day work points, she also had to take care of Qiao Zhen Jun when she returned.If Da Qiao was driven out, no one will do the housework. Jiao Jiao's body was so poor. Naturally, she can't let her do the work. In the end, it will definitely have to fall on her shoulders.Only at this moment did Fang Xiao Juan realize how much effect Qiao Zhen Jun's paralysis would have on her life!She recalled the divorce Xiao Qiao mentioned before. If she gets a divorce, she won't just get rid of the calamity, Da Qiao, but also the burden Qiao Zhen Jun!But soon she shook her head again. Although Qiao Zhen Jun was paralyzed, Qiao Family was still there. If she gets a divorce, where can she find such a good family?Xiao Qiao saw her mom slightly moved. She tilted her head and said innocently: \"I just came back and passed the leader's home. I had specially counted it. There are a total of seven brick rooms. Three more than Grandmother's home!\"Fang Xiao Juan's eyes flashed.In this village, if anyone was more well off than Qiao Family, there was only Wang's family.Of the five sons, Wang Family had four good labor force. Old First and old Third were particularly promising.But they were all married and had a good few children. What was the point of being well off?Wait, one of them was currently a bachelor. Fang Xiao Juan thought of Wang Xin Sheng. But then she frowned again.Wang Family was very well off, but Wang Xin Sheng was too carefree!Tell him to work and he'll either pretend to be sick or ask for leave. From the start to end of the year, he earned less work points than her! What was there to look forward to when marrying such a man?Taking in her mum's reaction, Xiao Qiao naturally knew what she was thinking. She wasn't in a hurry though.One have to eat one bite at a time. This divorce had to be done step by step. She'll blows the wind in her mom's ear every day. She didn't believe that her mother can remain unmoved?Qiao's family members each had their own thoughts, while Song Family wasn't peaceful.Song Jin Lai's wife had received a round of beating from her mother-in-law. When her man came back, she was beaten again. She almost couldn't get out of bed!Looking at the bruises on her body, Song Jin Lai's wife sucked in pain and hated Lin Hui even more.Slut. She actually dared to report on her. If that's the case, don't blame her for being impolite!Song Jin Lai\u2019s wife watched her mother-in-law go out to work on her own. Her body stealthily moved and then slipped out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sky was completely dark before six o'clock. After dinner, the villagers closed their doors and went to bed early.After Qiao Zhen Jun was paralyzed, old Qiao Family took turns to send someone over to guard him during night. It was Qiao Zhen Guo who came over the past few days.With her uncle there, Da Qiao had nothing to worry about. She went to bed after wiping her body.At some unknown time during the night, a sudden crash sounded in the room...\"Boom! Boom! Boom!\"In such a quiet winter night, the sound was clear and abrupt.Da Qiao awoke.She sat up from the bed and rubbed her eyes with her hands. Her little face was flushed from sleep, like a little cat whose sleep was disturbed.\u00a0 Looking\u00a0 naive and cute.She listened carefully, but the sound had disappeared. After waiting for a while, the sound didn't pop up again. Just when she thought she had misheard, the crash sounded again.She heard it clearly this time.The sound came from a wooden basin in the corner. It contained a small koi which Grandmother had exchanged for with an egg.She climbed down from the bed and walked to the basin. Her voice softly said: \"Little fish, it's, this late, you, why, not going, to bed?\"Little Koi spit out a few bubbles and suddenly spoke, \"Da Qiao, thank you for saving me! But I can't stay here for a long time. Can you send me home?\"Its voice was babyish. It sounded like the voice of a five or six-year-old child, sweet and silky.Da Qiao was so surprised that her mouth opened into a circle. Big enough to stuff a bird's egg: \"You, you, you can talk?\"Little Koi spat out a few more bubbles: \"I am the eighteenth daughter of Dragon King. Naturally, I can speak naturally. My elder siblings can even transformed into a human form. But my age is too little and don't have enough strength. So I can't be transformed into a human form. You haven\u2019t answered me yet. Can you take me home? If I don\u2019t go back, I\u2019ll be dead, woooo...\"Da Qiao couldn't understand why a fish could talk, but she understood the latter half of what the little Koi said.Seeing Little Koi crying miserably, she quickly comforted it: \"Don't, don't cry. I will send, you\u00a0 home, but, where is your home? Where is it?\"Little Koi immediately stopped crying: \"There is a waterfall in West Wood. Take me to the waterfall.\"Da Qiao's small face suddenly pinched together.The last time she went to West Wood to collect bird eggs, she almost died. After that, her father was sent to the hospital, so she subconsciously didn't like the West Wood.Little Koi saw Da Qiao's refusal and burst into tears again as she miserably looked at her with big eyes, It made people's heart go soft.Da Qiao had always been soft-hearted. How could she stand such a look?So despite the internal conflict, she nodded and agreed: \"Don't cry. I, I promise you. Alright.\"\"Great! Thank you, Da Qiao. I will repay you!\" Little Koi happily blubbered out several bubbles as she swam happily in the basin.When she woke up early the next morning, Da Qiao remembered what happened in the middle of the night. She thought it was a dream. Unexpectedly, when she came back from breakfast, Little Koi spoke again.\"Da Qiao, are you free? When will you send me to the small waterfall in West Wood?\"Da Qiao was shocked again: \"So, I, wasn't, dreaming!\"Little Koi made an action similar to rolling-eyes: \"Of course it's not a dream. Take me over, please, my good Da Qiao!\"Da Qiao felt she was better than Xiao Qiao at acting cute. Her eyes mistily looked at people, which made people totally unable to refuse.She nodded her head: \"Okay, I, take you, over.\"The basin was too heavy. It was also easy to be noticeable when brought out. So she found a small basket: \"No, no water. Can you, hold on?\"Little Koi said crisply, \"En, I have no problem. As long as you reach the small waterfall within half an hour.\"Da Qiao didn't know how far the waterfall was. but in order not to let Little Koi die, she gave her da a heads-up and went out immediately.All the strong laborers in the village were sent to the farmland infrastructure development site. The children were kept at home because the weather was too cold. That's why Da Qiao didn't meet anyone on the way.She couldn't help but secretly be relieved. She was afraid that she would meet Song Jin Lai's wife again like the last time.West Wood was still foggy. She couldn't see her fingers. Da Qiao stood at the entrance of West Wood. Her heart was trembling.Little Koi comforted: \"Don't worry, I won't let you fall into the pit-trap.\"Da Qiao was easily persuaded by the full of promise appearance. It proved that Little Koi really didn't lie to her. The journey was unimpeded and no accident happened.Following the guidance of Little Koi, she came to the small waterfall smoothly.The small waterfall was about less than ten meters high. The water rushed down from above and hit the rocks below and splash everywhere. Da Qiao couldn't help but stare at it.West Wood was full of fog all year round and inside, traps were set. Villagers dared not enter recklessly, let alone go deep into the mountains. So no one knew that there was a waterfall inside.This was also Da Qiao's first time seeing a waterfall. However, right now, she was staring at the fishes in the water.Lots of fish!She couldn't help swallowing.The last time she ate fish was during the Chinese New Year. She still remembered that the fish was so tender that she almost gobbled her tongue. She only ate two pieces because her mother said she was too young to digest too much.Recalling of the fish's taste, her saliva flowed out.Little Koi giggled as she watched Da Qiao constantly swallowing saliva: \"Da Qiao, wipe your saliva. It's dripping on my body!\"Da Qiao subconsciously wiped the corners of her mouth, only to realize that she was being teased. Her face flushed red immediately: \"Bad, fish!\"Little Koi fluttered in her hand and said, \"Da Qiao, quickly put me in the water!\"Although their time together was only a few days, Da Qiao was full of reluctance. Still, she put Little Koi into the water according to her instruction.: \"Goodbye, little Fish.\"Little Koi swam freely in the cold stream, and then swam back to the edge: \"Give me your hand.\"Da Qiao obediently stretched out her little hand.Little Koi spit out a piece of jade pendant from her mouth. At first, the jade pendant was only the size of a fingernail, but it became bigger and bigger after it was spit out and covered Da Qiao's entire palm.The whole body of the jade pendant was snow-white and crystal clear. Its carvings were vivid. The scales on it can be clearly seen. More importantly, its shape was exactly the same as that of the little koi.\"So, pretty!\" Da Qiao stared at the jade. Her eyes sparkled.Little Koi said: \"For you. As a gift for saving me.\"Da Qiao felt it wasn't right to accept such a precious gift. But Little Koi had already turned around and swam away after speaking. She didn't give her a chance to refuse.She watched it go up against the falling water and swam speedily towards the top of the waterfall.It wasn't easy to swim against the water. What's more, she had to go upstream against gravity. Little Koi had failed time and time again. It fell from mid-air many times and hit the bottom of the water. The fish's body was full of visible wounds. .Still, Little Koi did not give up.Da Qiao was nervous as well. Her little hand clenched into a fist to cheer for her: \"Little fish, add, oil!\"After countless tries and countless failure, Little Koi succeeded in the end!A shining halo appeared at the top of the waterfall. Little Koi jumped in. Her whole body glowed with a colorful light. The wounds on her body disappeared immediately.Little Koi flicked her tail at dragon entrance toward Da Qiao and said happily, \"Goodbye, Da Qiao!\"Da Qiao vigorously waved hir tender little hand: \"Goodbye, little fish.\"The light flashed and Little Koi disappeared. Da Qiao was taken aback for a while before looking down at the jade pendant in her hand.This jade pendant was so pretty. Where should she hide it?If someone saw it, how would she explain it?At this moment, the jade suddenly entered her palm and disappeared!Da Qiao was so scared that her breath stopped.Where was the jade pendant?Why did it disappear from her palm?She turned her palm to look over and over. Then she crouched down on the ground to look for it, Her heart was yelling anxiously.\u00a0Jade come out quickly.\u00a0The next moment, the jade popped out of her palm.Da Qiao was so stunned that she couldn't close her mouth again.She didn't understand why the jade would hide in her palm. But after the jade's several \"disappearing act\", she faintly found the pattern and knew how to hide and reappear it.She put the jade pendant away. Suddenly, a continuous splashing sound came from the water edge. She looked back and just saw a dozen fish automatically jump onto the grass from the water!Fishes jumped onto the shore by themselves. This was unheard of. Unseen of!However, Da Qiao had witnessed too many weird things today. So she wasn't \"surprised\" at this moment.She walked over and counted them. There were fifteen in total. Each weighed four to five jins, They were very fat and tender!She didn't dare to stay alone in West Wood for too long and immediately proceeded to put the fishes into the small back basket.The small back basket was full. There were two more that couldn't fit. She looped two straw ropes through the gills of the fishes and carried them with her hands.It stood to reason, the average fish weight was only four jins. Fifteen fish added up to 60 jins. A six-year-old girl can't carry it on her back.However, Da Qiao was born with supernatural powers like her grandmother. Otherwise. she wouldn't have took on most of the family's housework since she was four years old.However, no matter how strong she was, she was still too young. Her shoulders felt hot and painful due to the 70 jins back basket. After resting several times in between, she barely walked out of West Wood.Although the pain in the shoulder made her breathless, she felt overjoyed in her heart.She had already planned what to do with the fifteen fish. Excluding the five for grandmother and grandfather, three were for Aunt Hui. The rest for her dad.Her dad had been lying in bed for a month. Not only did his condition not get better, it seemed to be more serious. She was very worried.As for her mother?Sorry,\u00a0 this person never came across her mind at this moment.She was also lucky. She still didn't run into anyone on the way back. Otherwise, it would be impossible to explain why there were so many fish.After returning home, she ran to her dad's room and put the precious small back basket on the ground. As she panted, she said, \"Dad, fish!\"Qiao Zhen Jun saw a basket full of fish and was shocked on the spot: \"Where did you get so many fish? Did your grandmother give it to you?\"Da Qiao shook her little head: \"It wasn't, grandmother...\"She wanted to tell her dad about Little Koi and how that these fishes all jumped out of the water by themselves. But for some unknown reason, every time she spoke, there was a force preventing her from telling the truth.She tried several times. Her face turned red and still couldn't let it out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, it was too dangerous for a child to go to the river alone to catch fish. But she looked at him with big deer-like eyes, misty and wet.His heart softened. His temper suddenly disappeared: \"Alright. Dad won't scold you this time. But you can't run to catch fish alone in the future, understand?\"Da Qiao felt wronged. She was a good girl. Nothing wrong done, but she couldn't explain.Finally, under her father's piercing eyes, she poked her little fingers together and nodded: \"I know.\"As for the jade pendant hidden in her palm, she selfishly didn't want to tell anyone.Since childhood, her clothes and shoes were Xiao Qiao's old ones. What's more, each were worn for a good few years. This was the first time she had such a beautiful thing. She didn't want to tell anyone as she was afraid of it getting snatched away.Qiao Zhen Jun glanced at the fishes in the back basket and said, \"We can't eat so many fish. You can bring some to your grandparents.\"Da Qiao broke off the finger connection and said softly, \"Give, grandmother and grandfather five days. Give Aunt Hui, three. The rest, for Dad to eat.\"Qiao Zhen Jun originally wanted her to send a few to her\u00a0grandmother's house. But seeing her obviously plumper face, his mouth opened several times. He still couldn't speak.Da Qiao didn't know of her father's entanglement. She didn't intentionally not give it to her mother. She really forgot about her existence.Back when her mother left, she was indeed worried. She was afraid that her mother would divorce her father, and even more afraid that she would be kicked out of the house. Gradually, she realized the benefits.These days, no one scolded her. No one disliked her. She can eat and sleep enough every day. Simple wonderful!Da Qiao didn't understand why her mother didn't care for her. Still, even weak and small animals knew how to seek advantages and avoid disadvantages. After experiencing the sweetness, she chose to forget her mother.She separated seven fishes and poured them into a wooden basin to raise them. Then she headed towards old Qiao's house with the basket on her back.When Da Qiao made way to old Qiao's house, another person was also heading to old Qiao's house.Qiao Hong Xia held a basket in one hand and a three or four-year-old boy with the other hand. Her feet were like wind.The little boy was thin and small. His skin was a bit strangely white. In order to keep up with his mother's pace, he desperately swung his short legs. So tired that he panted. No crying at all. So well-behaved that made people feel distressed.When they entered Qili Village, the villagers saw them and greeted them with a smile: \"Hong Xia, coming back to your maternal home again?\"Qiao Hong Xia smiled and nodded: \"Bring my child back to see my second brother.\"\"You siblings have a very good relationship. What did you bring back? Let me see!\" A woman gathered around and reached out and lifted the cloth covering the basket without consent.Qiao Hong Xia couldn't dodge. The cloth was lifted, revealing the eggs and a small packet of brown sugar inside.The woman's eyes flashed and she shouted: \"Oh, so many eggs. Your mother-in-law is willing to let you bring so many eggs back to your maternal home?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi had two daughters. Third oldest, Qiao Hong Xia and fourth oldest, Qiao Hong Mei. One of the sisters married to Zhao family from the neighboring production team. The other married into the town.Qiao Hong Xia's husband, Zhao Jie Fang was an honest and down-to-earth man. However his mother, Xiao Cui Hua was a well-known iron fighting cock. She was usually stingy and mean to her daughter-in-laws. If things enter the door of Zhao's house, don't even think about taking them out.Most importantly was that Xiao Cui Hua disliked this third daughter-in-law, Qiao Hong Xia. So when people saw her come back with so many eggs, their expressed intrigue.Qiao Hong Xia calmly put the cloth back in place: \"It's getting late. I have to go there quickly. I got housework at home to do later!\"After speaking, she pulled her child away.Everyone stared at her basket of eggs. Feeling envious.\"Hong Xia still has a conscience. After old Second Qiao become paralyzed for a month, she has come back a few times. Unlike Hong Mei, who never came back once!\"\"Hong Mei has no heart since she was a child. Inherent white-eyed wolf. Her man is a master chef of the town's state-run restaurant. She has such a good life. Did she help her maternal family?\"\"Come to think of it, it's strange. Everyone in Qiao Family is tall and slender, only Hong Mei is short. Not good-looking. Really don't know who she looks like?\"Qiao Hong Xia didn't know that her arrival aroused everyone's heated discussion and implicated Fourth Sister.She ran into Da Qiao was speed walking to old Qiao's house's entrance and curiously said: \"Da Qiao, why are you here?\"Da Qiao looked up and saw the incoming person. Her eyes were immediately curved into two small crescents: \"Third Aunt, Brother Yi Ming!\"Zhao Yi Ming's small eyes lit up. He let go of his mother's hand and ran to her with a 'dongdongdong': \"Elder Sister Nian Nian!\"Da Qiao\u2019s proper name was Qiao Nian Nian, but everyone in the family and the village called her Da Qiao. Only this little cousin, Zhao Yi Ming would call her Elder Sister Nian Nian.Zhao Yi Ming's small hand tightly grasped his young elder cousin's hand. The thin and short body was leaning against her. The look of dependence made people feel soft when they saw it.Da Qiao liked this little cousin very much. He was obedient and cute. He would do whatever he was told.Qiao Hong Xia looked at the two people holding hands like a close sibling, her eyes soured.Yi Ming was originally a healthy and smart child. A year ago, she went to the town to take care of her youngest sister-in-law during her post-natal confinement. Yi Ming stayed at home under her mother-in-law's care.Unexpectedly, less than two days after she left home, Yi Ming fell into the water and developed a high fever that night. Her mother-in-law didn't take the child to the doctor to save money. If she hadn't come home temporarily, the child would have died!She was trembling with anger and immediately sent her child to the town hospital. In the end, the child's life was saved, but his brain was burned silly.Yi Ming\u2019s reaction was slower than that of ordinary children. He can't remember things and people. No one in the family can be remembered except her. Even his dad was forgotten. Just a turn of a head, he forgot the other party. However, he happened to remember Da Qiao. He had only met his cousin a few times.Da Qiao really doted Yi Ming. She never disdained his slow response, nor did she dislike his timid character. Compared with the demon, monster and ghost at homey, this was true family!Qiao Hong Xia looked at Da Qiao and suddenly noticed that her face was much rosier compared to the last time she came here. Her little face had become fleshy. She couldn't help being curious.Just when she was about to ask, Qiao Xiu Zhi walked out: \"Why are you here together?\"Qiao Hong Xia greeted her mother: \"I came to see Second Brother.\"In her maternal family, she and her second brother had the best relationship. When she was a child, she was bullied outside. It was Second Brother who stood up for her. If there was anything delicious, Second Brother would hide it and give her a portion. Because of this, Fourth Sister was jealous of her.\"What about you, little one?\" Qiao Xiu Zhi's gaze fell on Da Qiao.Da Qiao revealed her teeth and smiled sweetly: \"Send the fishes.\"As she spoke, she put down the back basket and pushed aside the dead grass that was scattered on top. The plump fishes below were revealed. It successfully surprised both her grandmother and third aunt.\"Where did this many fishes come from?\" Qiao Xiu Zhi and Qiao Hong Xia said in unison.Da Qiao flushed like when her dad asked her. After being held back for a long time, only two words were uttered: \"Caught it.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi found it even more strange.There was a stream and a river in Qili Village, but they weren't very deep. Now in the cold winter, how can so many fishes be caught?She asked for a long time, but Da Qiao couldn't say anything. Her little face blushed so much like it was close to bleeding.Like Qiao Zhen Jun, she had the heart to lecture but she was defeated by her wet eyes in the end. Only reminded her to bot catch fish by herself in the future.Qiao Hong Xia was stunned from this scene. Except toward her dad, when did her mother speak in such a gentle like a drizzle manner?Da Qiao couldn't help but breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that her grandmother didn't scold her. She took the five fish out of the basket.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't act reserved and accepted the fish. She gave two of them to Qiao Hong Xia: \"Take it back later and give your child a good nourishing.\"This word happened to be heard by Wan Chun Ju, who had just walked out. It dug up her flesh. But in front of her mother-in-law, she didn't dare to say anything.Her eyes flashed, and she landed on the basket in Qiao Hong Xia's hands and said, \"Is the basket filled with eggs? Third Sister, give me the basket. I'll take it in.\"Qiao Hong Xia frowned: \"I'm going to bring the egg over to nourish my second brother.\"Wan Chun Ju cried like a hen: \"Give it all to old Second? How can he eat so many eggs alone? Third Sister, it's not Sister-in-law wanting to tell you off. You know that Dad isn't in good health and bringing so many eggs back, you're not leaving half of them to Dad. You are so unfilial!Qiao Hong Xia's face suddenly sank: \"I brought the eggs. I give it to whomever I want. Mom and Dad didn't say anything about me? Is there any need for you to be speak here?\"Qiao Hong Xia inherited her mother's temper. Blue from indigo plant was deeper than its origin. No matter who it is, as long as she is unhappy, she will make her unhappy!Wan Chun Ju was scolded until she lost face. Her face was flushed. She was not reluctant to part from so many eggs: \"It is really a dog biting Lu Dong Bin. Dont understand peoples goodness. I am doing it for your own good!\"Qiao Hong Xia didn't give any face: \"Thanks. Please don't do it for my own good, I don't need it.\"Wan Chun Ju gritted her teeth with anger. Her face turned red and white.Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at her eldest daughter-in-law. Her face full of disdain.For Hong Xia's own good? Did she think that everyone was as stupid as her?Da Qiao placed the withered grass back in place and put the back basket back on her back. She said softly: \"Grandmother, Third Aunt, I'm going, to send fish, to Aunt Hui.\"Wan Chun Ju's eyes popped out and she exploded like a cat with its tail stomped on: \"Da Qiao, give me the fish. Why you give such good fish to an outsider. This kind of thing can only be done by an idiot like you!\"Two fish were given away. Didn't get a single egg. Now she want to give the fishes to an outsider?No matter what was said, it was unreasonable!As she spoke, she took action and aimed to grab Da Qiao's back basket, but was slapped by Qiao Xiu Zhi.\"Bang\" crisply sounded!Qiao Xiu Zhi's slap didn't have much force. The back of Wan Chun Ju's hand instantly became red and swollen. It throbbed with pain. Her tears came down.\"Mom!\"The scream of Wan Chun Ju echoed over the yard. The old hen next to her flew away in fright.\"How can you treat me like this, Mom?\"She glanced at her mother-in-law with pitiful, helpless and weak eyes. Then she covered her face and ran back to the house with small steps.Qiao Xiu Zhi:...Qiao Hong Xia:?The mother and daughter were dumbfounded.The expressions were hard to describe.If Xiao Qiao was here, she would know what was wrong with Wan Chun Ju.Wan Chun Ju was diagnosed with split personality only more than ten years later. There were two kinds of personality hidden in her body; a small minded shrew and a bitter, crybaby little wife. That was why people often found her behavior perplexing.\"What mind-wrecking things?\"Three daughter-in-laws, none of them were normal!Qiao Xiu Zhi took the fish into the kitchen while complaining. Then she went to see Qiao Zhen Jun with her daughter.Wan Chun Ju sobbed her way back to her room. Internally, she hoped that someone would come to comfort her. After waiting for a long time, she didn't see a single figure. She immediately switched to the shrewd personality and went out to tell her grievances.In winter, few families cooked at noon. The women were so idle, they began to become moldy. They can't live, if their mouth doesn't gossip.Walking to the end of a wall, Wan Chun Ju heard several women talking in low voices.\"Have you heard about Lin Hui fancying old Second Qiao?\"\"I heard. I really couldn't tell that she is like that! She usually looks like a chaste woman, I didn't expect her to be flirty inside. Tsk, Tsk...\"Suddenly, Wan Chun Ju slapped her thigh. At once, she felt that she had discovered the truth.She was saying, why Da Qiao would give such a plump fish to Lin Hui. It turned out to be Qiao Zhen Jun's order!She immediately joined the gossip and told everyone that Qiao Zhen Jun got Da Qiao to give Lin Hui three fatty fish. Three!Originally, some people didn't believe the rumor very much. But now they heard Wan Chun Ju's well presented speech, they couldn't help but believe it. After returning home, they told other people the news.Soon, there were spring rumors about Lin Hui and old Second Qiao everywhere in the village. The news soon reached Fang Family.Fang Family was shocked!Fang Family was furious!Fang Family was going to make trouble!Their old Fang family was old Qiao Family's in-laws. They couldn't get a single fish. Instead, they gave all the fish to a vixen. It was totally unreasonable!There was also the guy, Qiao Zhen Jun, who usually act like a stump. Unexpectedly, he was sly baddie. He actually got together with the widow, Lin Hui!Fang Fu Gui slammed his hand on the table with a brusque expression: \"Little sister. Elder Brother will accompany you back to seek for justice. Bullying Fang Fu Gui's sister is looking down on me, Fang Fu Gui!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I'm not afraid!\" Fang Fu Gui slammed his hand on the table, \"Besides, it's old Second Qiao who wronged you. No one dare to say anything even if I kill him on the spot! \"Fang Fu Gui was a well-known loafer in this area. Most people didn't dare to provoke him easily.With her brother's support, Fang Xiao Juan immediately felt confident. The two siblings headed towards Qiao's house with determination.Qiao Xiu Zhi was about to leave after helping with the housework. But when she reached the courtyard's entrance, she saw Fang Xiao Juan siblings approaching aggressively. They looked like they wanted to kick up trouble.Her lips curled and looked at them coldly.Fang Xiao Juan met her mother-in-law's icy gaze and her high spirit couldn't help drop. She gulped a mouthful of saliva and said, \"Brother, I...why do I feel my legs gone a little soft?\"Fang Fu Gui also felt a little weak in his legs, but to save face, he held on: \"Younger Sister, don't waver. Just go up and do it!\"Fang Xiao Juan couldn't falter. She walked over with a forced smile: \"Mom, why are you here?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi snorted: \"This is my son's home, why can't I be here? Do you think everyone is just like you? Already married off and still keep living in maternal home?\"Fang Xiao Juan didn't expect to receive an earful as soon as she arrived. She was indeed in the wrong for living in her maternal home. In a moment of anger, she became a head shorter again.\"Mom, I heard people say that Zhen Jun got together with that loose Lin Hui. He is too much! I married him and ate so much hardship with him. He actually treated me like this. I can't live anymore... \"Fang Xiao Juan was also a drama queen. Tears appeared as soon as she spoke.In the first place, she was pretty. Her crying was like pear blossom bringing rain. Really, it was a pretty sight.It was a pity that the person in front of her wasn't a man who will pity and cherish jade but cold-hearted Qiao Xiu Zhi.\"Withdraw your cat pee. It's that sentence. Don't want to live, go die! Improper relationship? Tell me how a paralyzed person can mess around? If not, I will beat you until you are paralyze and let you show me how?\"\"I... I heard it from others.\" Fang Xiao Juan's imposing spirit reduced some more. She couldn't appear confident anymore: \"But if Zhen Jun and that loose Lin Hui didn't have anything, why should he send fish to Lin Hui? \"And gifted three in one go. Fang Family didn't even get half!Qiao Xiu Zhi laughed: \"Lin Hui did get fishes. What, not pleased?\"When she was needed to take care of someone, she ran back to her maternal home. Now there was benefit, she came running back?Can really dream!Mother-in-law didn't play the card according to common sense. It was obviously Qiao Family in fault. Why can she be so confident and arrogant?Of course, Fang Xiao Juan wasn't willing to submit but she didn't dare to say directly: \"Mom, why do you want to give extra fish to outsiders? Jiao Jiao's grandma's family didn't get half a fish. Isn't this letting people gossip?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi let out a mocking laugh: \"Why would we give your family fishes? Because your faces are big?\"\"...\"Fang Xiao Juan felt her mouth was blocked to death.She suddenly discovered that her brother, who had just patted his chest and said he was going to support her, didn't even let out a fart after he came!She turned her head and didn't see anyone. Her body turned around and saw that her brother had actually retreated to a place two meters away from her at some unknown time!What support?What beating Qiao Zhen Jun to death?She couldn't help but get angry: \"Eldest Brother, what are you doing so far?\"Fang Fu Gui blinked, squatted down and touched his shoe surface, \"My shoelaces are loose. I have to tie them up, or I will stumble when I walk.\"Fang Xiao Juan's eyes fell on his shoe. As if she'll believe him!His shoes didn't even have laces. What laces needed to be tied!Qiao Xiu Zhi was too lazy to waste time with a group of idiots and stated sternly: \"You better leave immediately, otherwise...\"She stretched out her fist and cracked her knuckles.Fang Xiao Juan's legs buckled and she almost fell to the ground in fright.As for the loafer, Fang Fu Gui?En, he had long left his sister behind and ran away when Qiao Xiu Zhi waved his fist. He ran like a ghost was chasing behind him.Fang Xiao Juan turned her head and watched her brother leaving her on her own. She became enraged again and quickly slipped away like her feet was fueled with oil.Da Qiao blinked big eyes inside the room. Her expression displayed 'I did something wrong': \"Dad, I'm not good. I didn't, give mom, fish.\"It wasn't until her mom's arrival did she realize that she had forgotten to send fish to her mom. She didn't mean it. She didn't know why she would forget.Before Qiao Zhen Jun could answer, he heard Qiao Xiu Zhi walk in with a cold snort: \"What not good? You did a good job! Otherwise she really thinks she can do as she likes in Qiao's home!\"Old Second was paralyzed. If Fang Xiao Juan wasn't put in her place in one go, there'll still be trouble in the future. So even when she had worked hard these days, she never went to Fang Family to get Fang Xiao Juan come back.She knew exactly what kind of people Fang Family were.Because Fang Xiao Juan brought money back, they were currently willing to let Fang Xiao Juan live at home. Once the money is spent, she'll wait and see how much their family loves each other!In the end, it was old Second's being a disappointment. At the beginning, he was bewitched by that woman, Fang Xiao Juan. After marriage, he didn't throw out the husband's weight. So Fang Xiao Juan got spoiled until she was lawless!Thinking of this, her gaze fell sharply on Qiao Zhen Jun: \"Old Second, once I leave, you can't let Da Qiao go to Fang's house to send fish. If I find out you did, see how I'll take care of you!\"Being lectured in front of his child, Qiao Zhen Jun's face flushed like a cooked shrimp: \"I... won't.\"In fact, he had already regretted this marriage.Everyone thought he was obsessed with Fang Xiao Juan and was determined to marry her. However, it wasn't like that.At that time, his dad had a serious illness. He was thinking about going into the mountains to find some wild goods to nourish his father. Who could have have known that instead of finding wild animals, he ran into Fang Xiao Juan who was bathing in the mountain stream.At that time, she was wearing nothing and was completely seen by him. She sobbed sought death. He had no choice but to promise that he would marry her as his wife.So no matter how his mother objected, he still insisted on marrying Fang Xiao Juan. Otherwise a life would be gone!Soon after marriage, Fang Xiao Juan showed her true colors. Lazy and acts up. Not to mention she moved all the good things back to Fang\u2019s house, she also didn\u2019t go to work or do housework. Every day, she would grumble about him being slow-witted, incapable, and can't please people. She must had used eight lifetimes of unluckiness to marry him!That was fine. What he can't bear was that the bleeding during childbirth was obviously an accident. She blamed Da Qiao, a child for all of that and tried her hardest to torment the child!This time he was paralyzed. During this circumstance, she ran home and pushed his burden to his parents. This made his heart completely chilled.Fang Xiao Juan ran home in frustration and saw her brother bathing in crossed-leg position in the sun. She couldn't help but feel infuriated: \"Eldest Brother, is this what you call supporting me?\"He didn't dare to let out a single fart!Fang Fu Gui didn't find it embarrassed at all. He dangled his legs with a grass in his mouth and said, \"Youngest Sister, it's not that Eldest Brother won't support you, but Brother suddenly realized that we were wrong from the beginning. We shouldn't go to Qiao's house to seek justice. Didn\u2019t it say in the plays to catch the bandits, first catch the ringleader. We should go to Widow Lin to beat the vixen!\"Was the phrase \"to catch the bandits, first catch the ringleader\" used like this?Fang Xiao Juan was full of doubts.But she understood what her brother said. After thinking about it, she suddenly felt that what her brother said was reasonable.Really. If it wasn't for that little hoof, Lin Hui who kept pining on another's man all day long, why would Qiao Zhen Jun give her fishes?So the two siblings marched out again.When they arrived at the place where Lin Hui lived, Fang Xiao Juan had her hands on her waist and shouted: \"Lin Hui, Lin Hui. Come out here!\"Lin Hui didn't move back to her maternal family after she became a widow. She still lived in the house where she was married. It was quite a distance from her maternal family and very close to the educated youth point in the village.Lin Hui had been ill for the past two days and hadn't gone out. In addition, because she was a widow, she always keeps her distance from the people in the village. So she still didn't know that the rumored scandal about her were flying around.Hearing someone calling her at this moment, she struggled to get up from the bed. Coughing, she walked out the door.Seeing Fang Xiao Juan's hip reaching her hips, she was taken aback for a moment: \"Xiao Juan, are you looking for me?\"Lin Hui and Fang Xiao Juan used to be a pair of besties. They both looked beautiful and were a beautiful sight in the village. It was only after some things happened that the relationship between the two fell apart.Fang Xiao Juan's eyes spat fire: \"Lin Hui, you a dead woman! A b*tch with sores on the soles of your feet! You can't live without a man to moisturize you, right? Dare to seduce my man, see if I won't kill you!\"Saying that she stepped forward to grab Lin Hui's hair.Lin Hui was taken by surprised, stepped back and avoided her hand. Her face was pale as paper: \"Xiao Juan, what are you talking about Did you misunderstand something?\"\"Peh, what misunderstanding?\" Fang Xiao Juan grasped her hair and pressed her forcefully to the ground. \"You little whore who sleeps with thousands of people, if you didn't seduce Zhen Jun, would he give you fish?\"Lin Hui was beaten up.After being ill for a few days, she didn't have any strength at all. Being pulled like this, she fell heavily to the ground with a \"bang\". She let out a gasp from the pain.Send fish?When did this happen? Why didn't she know?Actually, when Da Qiao sent the fish over, Lin Hui had taken the medicine and fell asleep. The fish was accepted by Lin Hui\u2019s second sister-in-law and taken home. What\u2019s more, she even advertised and showed it off everywhere. Like way, everyone became more convinced that Lin Hui and Qiao Zhen Jun got together.Fang Xiao Juan saw that Lin Hui didn't say anything and believed she was right. She became more infuriated. Raising her hand and \"Pa, Pa\" on the face!Lin Hui was lying on the ground with her head disheveled. Her face was red and swollen. She looked so pitiful.Fang Fu Gui leaned against the tree. His mouth hooked diagonally. He had no intention to step forward to stop her.Back then, he wanted to marry Lin Hui, but she didn't fancy on him. She chose a short-lived ghost. Ha, she deserved it!The educated youths, who lived not far away heard the ruckus, came running out and saw two women fighting. Especially the sight of two beautiful women fighting. They couldn't help but be stunned.Fang Xiao Juan became even more enthusiastic when she saw someone coming: \"Little whore, don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know your thoughts. You fancied Zhen Jun back then. But it\u2019s a pity that he didn\u2019t like you. Unexpectedly, you're so shameless. He's married and you still come clinging. Peh!\"The saliva fell on Lin Hui's face. She felt as though she was about to suffocate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Or that her mother had went marching over to the door.At this moment, she was looking at the jade pendant in her palm. Her heart was thumping.Just now, two small beads suddenly fell off from the eye of the koi jade pendant. The size of the beads was about the same as that of fish eyes.However, compared with fish eyes, this jade bead was white and flawless. Crystal clear and looked very beautiful.It so mysterious.Out of nowhere, eye beads fell off!After freezing a long time, Da Qiao gently picked up the jade beads and squeezed it.The jade beads were very soft. Felt like gummies. Very pleasing to the touch.Then she put it under her nose and smelled it.The scent wasn't very strong. Somewhat of a natural floral scent. Light and very good smell.Da Qiao moved her delicate nose like a small animal. She pursed her little mouth and gulped saliva.She ate two bowls of porridge and half a fish tonight. Why did she seem to be hungry now?She can really eat.Da Qiao's little face blushed. She was ashamed of her gluttony.After struggling for a while, she still didn't dare to eat the jade beads. Her father had told her not to eat things randomly.But what should she do with this jade bead?Such a beautiful bead. It would be a pity to throw it. But how should she explain if she don't throw it and it got seen?Da Qiao was in a dilemma.In the end, she hardened her heart and decided to get rid of the jade beads.She threw the jade beads into the wooden basin, which contained the water that she had soaked her little feet. As soon as the jade beads entered, they quickly melted away without a trace.Da Qiao's big deer-like eyes blinked a few times. Then she reached into the water and stirred it. Nothing was found.She sighed a little before taking the tub out and dumped the water in the corner of the yard.The old people in the village still had lingering fears of the past few famine years, so production team leader, Wang Shui Sheng had led men from the village to build a reservoir these days.When it snows later, the reservoir can store snow. When the snow melts in the spring next year, there will be no shortage of water.Qiao Zhen Quo had participated. When he came back, he was covered in a dust. In order to wait for him, old Qiao Family had dinner late tonight.Wan Chun Ju was so hungry that her stomach was growling. For the whole evening, she drooled at the plate of fish. After the meal finally began, she didn't care about anything. She picked up the chopsticks and started grabbing.\"It's delicious! This fish is so fat! Wonder where Da Qiao got it from?\"Da Qiao's child usually appeared solemn and well-behaved. Never thought her to be so sly. Even when mother-in-law asked her, she didn't want to tell where the fish came from!Really a small person with giant tricks!\"This fish soup is so delicious. My dear mother ah! I don't remember how long since I have eaten such delicious fish!\"\"It's so yummy. Extremely yummy! Mom, you shouldn't let Da Qiao give the fish to that loose Lin Hui!\"Seeing Wan Chun Ju make a clean sweep and spat saliva as she ate, Qiao Xiu Zhi pinched on her brows like she got a dead fly: \"None of your business! Da Qiao got the fish. She can give it to whomever she wants to. If you don't want to eat it, go back to your room!\"Qiao Zhen Guo glanced at his wife and agreed: \"You have something to eat and it still can't plug your mouth. Mom is right. If you don't want to eat it, just go back in. Look how you're spraying your saliva everywhere. Can others still eat it? \"A mouthful of old blood rushed up within Wan Chun Ju and she almost suffocated to death on the spot!What kind of man did she marry? It was enough that he didn't protect her. And he still tell her off in front of so many people. Her life was so bitter!It was still her mother-in-law who was fortunate. Although the mother-in-law was big and crude, father-in-law held her in his palm as he doted her.Look, even when eating a fish, Father-in-law would pick the bones out first and then put them in the Mother-in-law's bowl. Truly made one envious to death!Wan Chun Ju glanced at the man sitting next to her, who was noisily munching away. She coyly spoke: \"Zhen Guo, I want to eat fish.\"Qiao Zhen Guo's whole body shivered and looked at her like he saw a ghost: \"Straighten your tongue to speak. Really makes one shiver. Look, my goose bumps are all up!\"He rolled up his sleeves and really showed her his goose bumps.\"...\"Wan Chun Ju almost vomited some blood.At the beginning, she wasn't blind. So why did she fall in love with such a unromantic man like Qiao Zhen Guo?Qiao Xiu Zhi raised her eyes to glance at her eldest daughter-in-law. The corner of her mouth smiled lightly. She picked up some food for her husband, Xue Chuan and said: \"Don't focus on picking fish bones for me. Eat more.\"Xue Chuan was the kind of man who has been handsome for a lifetime. When he was young, he was handsome and had no rivals with in ten miles. Now that he was old, he was still a handsome old man. Those old men within the ten miles were simply an eye sore when standing in front of him.He looked at his wife and smiled gently: \"Don't you like fish very much? It's rare to come across such delicious fish. I must clear more for you.\"Under the orange candlelight's glow, he concentrated on picking up a fishbone for his wife.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't refuse this time. In fact, as long as Xue Chuan insisted on something, she would never stop him.Wan Chun Ju's eyes were red with envy.She gritted her teeth and said again: \"Zhen Guo, help me pick out the fishbone.\"This time she didn't speak in a coy tone. But it was a pity that the man in front of her was a steel straight man, who never understood what romance were.Qiao Zhen Guo casually gave her a stab again: \"Don't have any hands? You aren't a three-year-old kid, and need someone to help you pick fishbones. You are so funny!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Wan Chun Ju was already full from anger!She originally wanted to learn PDA from her in-laws. Unexpectedly, Qiao Zhen Guo that rotton man, couldn't understand romance at all. Simply infuriating!Wan Chun Ju turned her anger toward food and clipped most of the fish flesh into her bowl.Food was better. It will never let one down.Unexpectedly the next moment she cried out and her face scrunched up.Qiao Zheng Guo was very impatient: \"What's the matter with you?\" Why are you acting so much during one dinner?Wan Chun Ju touched her throat with her hand and swallowed saliva with much difficulty: \"Fishbone stuck!\"Then there was a flurry of turmoil. In order to swallow the fishbone, she drank half a jar of vinegar. She drank until her teeth almost fell from the sourness. But the fishbone still didn't go down.In the end, she swallowed two big mantou in a row. She almost choked herself to death before she was able to swallow the fishbone. Her throat hurt. She could only drink congee for a good few days.She also choked to death, but Qiao Zhen Guo didn't care about her at all. His chopsticks never left the table and ate more happily than anyone else!What kind of unlucky life was this? Wan Chun Ju felt that the whole world was against her.Today, the villagers in Qili Village watched a big show. The affairs between Lin Hui and Qiao Zhen Guo became the top gossip.\"Unexpectedly, it turns out that Lin Hui fancied old Second Qiao long ago.\"\"What unexpectedly? Qiao Family is stable. Old Second Qiao is honest, hardworking, and good-looking. When he wasn't married, which girl wasn't eyeing on him?\"\"It's a pity, old Second Qiao has chosen a woman like Fang Xiao Juan out of two thousand choice.\"Fang Xiao Juan was pretty, but her temperament... Fang Family's whole family made people retreat three feet away.At this moment, Lin Hui walked out of the house with a pale face and headed towards the well at the entrance of the village.When she walked to the ancient well, she didn't say anything and she jumped toward the mouth of the well.A splash erupted and the person was gone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The bucket fell to the ground with a \"bang\".Her throat opened up and yelled, \"Somebody come! Someone has jumped into the well! Quickly someone come!\"Although the people in the village liked to gossiping, they weren't bad people. Hearing someone jumped into the well, they ran out of the house to save people.Lin Hui was lucky. It hadn't rained for a long time recently, and the water in the ancient well wasn't too deep. As soon as everyone came over, they quickly fished her out of the well.Lin Hui was lying on the ground. Her face pale without a trace of blood, her hair clung to her face indiscriminately, and her eyes tightly closed. She looked like she was dead.The two lads who pulled her up were scared and fell to the ground.The barefoot doctor in the village arrived and check her pulse, \"Don't worry. She's still alive!\"Everyone immediately breathed a sigh of relief. It was good that she wasn't dead. It was good.Otherwise, those people who watched the play during the day will probably have nightmares tonight.\"All was fine, so why did she jump into the well?\" asked some people who were not in the village during the day.\"Oh, blame Fang Family's two siblings for this!\"\"Yes, those two brother and sister of Fang family are simply too arrogant. Let me tell you...\"So everyone rushed to tell the people who missed the interesting act during the day.After listening, some people didn't believe that Lin Hui was such a person. Some lamented that they were absent and missed a good show.At this moment, a howling voice approached from far away: \"Hui'er, my daughter...\"Everyone turned to look, and saw Lin Hui's mother, Wang Qiu Ying and her five towering son rushed over with a fierce expression on their face.Only then, everyone remembered that Lin Hui was the great treasure of old Lin Family!For three consecutive generations, old Lin Family only gave birth to male babies. Lin Hui had five elder brothers above her. After finally getting such a baby girl, old Lin family spoiled her to great extreme. No other girls in the village were as precious as her!When she was beaten today, none of old Lin Family came out because the men had all gone to build the pondage reservoir, while the women went to the town to have a wedding drink. Only Lin Hui's second sister-in-law stayed to take care of her.But Lin Hui\u2019s second sister-in-law was unreliable. After getting the fish sent by Da Qiao, she showed off one of the fish as she went to give it to her maternal home in the neighboring production team. Resulting, Lin Hui getting beaten for a long time and no one stepped out to help her.At this moment, old Lin Family heard that Lin Hui jumped into the well. How could they calm down?Although Wang Qiu Ying was almost 60 years old, when she ran, it can be called winged foot. Seeing\u00a0 her daughter lying motionless on the ground with her eyes closed, she cried out with a wail.\"My poor daughter, what happened to you? You suffered great grievances. You should have wait until Mom comes back. You have so many brothers here. How can we let you be wronged?\"Lin Hui's five eldest brothers all had distressed and angry expressions on their faces. They latched on people to ask what happened to Lin Hui.When they knew that their sister had been beaten by Fang family, the five men's eyes blazed up.If Fang Family's siblings were here at this time, they would definitely be beaten to death on the spot!Lin Feng clenched his fist until it squeaked: \"Damn, they dared to beat my sister. Simply tired of living!\"The few other brothers echoed: \"If we don't beat them all over the floor, they'll think our old Lin family has no one!\"So the five brothers decided to divide into two groups. Old Fifth carried their sixth sister and returned to their residence with their mother. The other four brothers went to Fang's house to settle the accounts!The villagers who regretted missing the good show before were immediately excited: \"Quickly, keep up! There is a good show to watch!\"Lin Family's four brothers stormed to Fang's house.At this time, Fang family was eating dinner. While eating, they complained that Da Qiao was a white-eyed wolf and would not take care of her grandma's family when she had good things.Fang Xiao Juan scolded the most vigorously: \"That child is a plague god. I didn't like her since she was born. Had I known earlier, I would have strangled her to death, so that she wouldn't be able to implicate me until I can't go back home!\"If Qiao Xiu Zhi heard this, she would burst into laughter.Clearly she was the one who wanted to go back to her maternal home. What did it had to do with Da Qiao? Even lazy person didn't have such lazy explanation!At this moment, the door of Fang's yard was kicked open with a bang!\"My god, who is making trouble here?\" Old woman Fang screamed in fright. While Fang You Rou in her arms was so frightened that he cried.Fang Fu Gui spat at the ground, stood up and said with a brutal expression: \"F- his mother. Who dares to run to our Fang's house to be wild?\"An ominous premonition surged in Fang Xiao Juan's heart. But her brother had already dashed out before she could speak.Fang Fu Gui rushed out. Before he could see the person clearly, a punching-bag-size fist greeted him on his face!\"Bang\"!Fang Fu Gui took a punch in his eyes. The pain caused him to take a sharp breath: \"I'm f-ing...\"\"Bang!\"Another punch!Hit the other eye this time!\"Stop...\"\"Bang!\"After the third punch, he felt that the bridge of his nose was about to collapse. His nose became cold and two lines of nosebleeds flowed down.When old woman Fang saw her son being beaten, she shrieked like a pig: \"How can you do this? Stop it! Stop it!\"Fang Xiao Juan came out last. Seeing this scene, she was so frightened that her legs weakened on the spot.She finally knew why she had an ominous premonition just now. She had forgotten that Lin Hui had five elder brothers!When the two of them were best friends in the past, she was very jealous that Lin Hui was spoiled at home.Unlike her. Not only did she had to do housework, but also all the delicious and useful things at home were given to her eldest brother first. When her turn arrived,\u00a0 she might even get a crumb!Old woman Fang gave birth to five children in this life. The first two were daughters. The third was a son. Later, she gave birth to two more children, but they were still daughters!Therefore, Fang Family's only male, Fang Fu Gui was naturally treated like a treasure. As the youngest daughter, Fang Xiao Juan hadn't received any special treatment.At that time, she felt satisfied when she gave the beating but forgot how Lin Hui's five brothers treasured Lin Hui.She took two steps back, trying to quietly retreat back to the room to hide.But she was a step late.Lin Hui's eldest sister-in-law, Yuan Su Hua rushed forward. She grabbed her by the hair and gave her with five or six slaps.Fang Xiao Juan's face instantly swelled!But this wasn't over yet.Yuan Su Hua dragged her to the ground and sat on her stomach with her huge body like the way Fang Xiao Juan did to Lin Hui before. Then another round of 'pa, pa, pa'!\"Stup...id...\"Fang Xiao Juan wanted to say \"Stop it\", but two of teeth had broken off. So her words were mispronounced. There was a coppery taste in her mouth.But this wasn't the end.It was unknown where Lin Hui's third sister-in-law got a big pot of chicken poo. She rushed over and smeared all the chicken poo on Fang Xiao Juan's face!\"B*tch, dare to beat my family's sixth sister! Do you think our Lin Family are dead? Go eat sh*t!\"\"Ahhhhhh...\" Fang Xiao Juan screamed like she was getting forcefully r*ped!She was really going to collapse!It was disgusting. These two b*tches actually stuffed chicken poo into her mouth!Fang Family and Lin Family's affair was so big that old Qiao Family knew about it even if they didn't want to.Old Qiao Family didn't know before, because Fang Fu Gui had threatened and told people that they weren't allowed to spread this matter to Qiao Family. If he found out who did, then they would have a grudge.Naturally, not everyone in the village was afraid of Fang Fu Gui. But when confronted with such a good-for-nothing, it went without saying they won't provoke him if they can.Now that Qiao Xiu Zhi knew that Fang Xiao Juan ran to beat Lin Hui because of the rumors outside and forced the other party to jump into the well to commit suicide, her face suddenly sank.Can't keep this daughter-in-law.She can tolerate her partiality. She can also tolerate her laziness. However, she can't stand her knowing that those rumors were nothing more than rumors and was eager to pour dirty water on her husband!Now that nothing happened, she still dared to do this. If something happened to Qiao Family one day, she might be the first to fall into trouble!For the future peace of Qiao Family, old Second must divorce her!Wan Chun Ju watched her mother-in-law's face sank further and further. Her legs trembled with fright. She shrunk her neck and sneaked out along the wall.My god. Mother-in-law's face was so ugly!If Mother-in-law finds out that she played a role of fueling the flames, would she punch her to death?Qiao Zhen Guo happened to come out to drink water and saw his wife's behavior. He couldn't help but curiously said: \"What are you doing? Acting so suspicious. It can't be you did something bad again?\"Wan Chun Ju's anger formed!What did he mean by she did something bad again? It sounded like she commit bad acts every day!She took a deep breath and said, \"Zhen Guo, if... I mean if I do something that makes Mom angry and if Mom wants to hit me, can you protect me?\"Qiao Zhen Guo laughed: \"Definitely impossible! In my opinion, you deserve to be beaten to death. Who told you to have itchy skin!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"She watched her husband who departed with roars of laughter and felt a mouthful of old blood stuck in her chest. It almost suffocated her to death!Qiao Xiu Zhi discussed with her husband, Xue Chuan.Naturally, Xue Chuan agreed with her, so the two of them headed to Qiao Family's small courtyard.Fang Xiao Juan, who was beaten until her nose was bruised and her face was swollen, didn't even know that she was going to be divorced soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Once it became dark, she soaked up her little feet and prepared to sleep as she waited for her elder uncle.Unexpectedly, her uncle's arrival didn't come. Instead, she waited for her grandmother and grandfather's arrival!\"Da Qiao, is your dad asleep?\" Xue Chuan looked at the little dumpling in front of him and said sweetly and lightly.Da Qiao blinked her big eyes, shook her head and softly replied, \"No, yet.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi patted her little head: \"We have something to discuss with your dad. Come in and listen.\"In Qiao Xiu Zhi's view, even children have the right to be not kept in the dark.Da Qiao took in her grandfather and grandmother 's serious faces. Her little heart pounded fast.Her instinct was telling her something had happened!Qiao Zhen Jun was surprise to see his parents coming over: \"Dad and Mom, why are you here? Is it inconvenient for Eldest Brother to come here? Actually, I can manage alone. You don't need to come and take care of me every night.\"His parents were already at this old age and still had to come to take care of him. Sometimes he felt that he was better off dead.Da Qiao trotted over with her short little legs and brought two stools for her grandparents, \"Grandfather, Grandmother, sit, down!\"Xue Chuan's heart melted at this sight and stretched out his hand to rub her little furry head: \"Grandfather came out in a hurry this time and didn't bring any candy. I will remember to next time.\"Da Qiao's eyes lit up. At the though of the sweetness of the candy, saliva gushed in her mouth.She smacked her small mouth and swallowed her saliva subconsciously. She looked like a greedy little squirrel with expectations in her eyes. Then she seemed to be embarrassed of her gluttony. Xue Chuan couldn't help but smile.Qiao Xiu Zhi had never been one to be vague. She directly told Qiao Zhen Jun about Fang Xiao Juan storming over to beat Lin Hui and Lin Hui couldn't think it through and jumped into the well.After hearing this, Qiao Zhen Jun's expression displayed incredulous. It took him a long time to find his voice: \"Xiao Juan... she really did that?\"He really didn't know why Fang Xiao Juan became like this. Not only was she bad to his daughter, she can't wait to pour dirty water on him now!She really looked at him highly. As a paralyzed man, he couldn't even stand up as a paralyzed man. So how could he get entangled with someone?He recalled Lin Hui. That girl with two big braids who was always the quietest in the crowd. He felt a slight stinging pain in his heart.If he ever took the initiative to marry a girl in the past, that person was Lin Hui. Every time she smiled at him, he blushed and his heart beat so hard that he didn't know where to put his hands and feet.Without waiting for him to bring it up to his parents, Fang Xiao Juan's matter happened.Qiao Xiu Zhi knew that her son was honest, but his personality wasn't as bold as old Third. If she didn't smoke him out, he would probably endure it like before.So she said straightforwardly: \"How are you going to solve this? Your dad and I want you to divorce Fang Xiao Juan.\"Qiao Zhen Jun was shocked again!Divorce?He had never consider this before!It wasn't that he loved Fang Xiao Juan deeply, but rather, that few people ever divorce in this age!Divorce ruined women too much. Although he hated some of Fang Xiao Juan's personality, he never thought of forcing her to die.What's more, he was paralyzed now. If Da Qiao had no mother, what will happen to her in the future?Qiao Xiu Zhi watched him set his gaze on Da Qiao and guessed what he was thinking with her toes: \"Don\u2019t use Da Qiao as an excuse. Without a mother like Fang Xiao Juan, Da Qiao can still live. !\"Fang Xiao Huan was selfish to the bones. Unless this kind of person was thrown back into the womb to reborn, don't think about her becoming better at once!At the side, Da Qiao had her mouth and mouth opened wide, like a surprised little animal.Did her mom beat Aunt Hui?Aunt Hui jumped into the well?Grandmother want her parents to divorce?Each and every questions were like lightning strikes. It stunned her into a daze.She was very worried about Aunt Hui. She was a good person. Why did her mom beat her?There was also little Brother Dong Lin. He must be very scared now. She really wanted to go over and hug him.Due to what his mom said, Qiao Zhen Jun's expression displayed embarrassment. But, he still couldn't make up his mind: \"Mom, must it reach this step?\"He didn't want to use his children as an excuse, but the world was like this. If he divorced Fang Xiao Juan, the man would definitely pick out the two children's shortcoming in this aspect in the future.Xiao Qiao was pretty, smart, sensible and knew how to be likable, so he wasn't too concerned.While Da Qiao was inconspicuous and stuttered. Now he was paralyzed. If he divorced Fang Xiao Juan, who would be willing to ask her hand in the future?Qiao Xiu Zhi said with a cold face: \"Selfish, bitter, mean, lazy, biased toward children, and disrespectful to husband. As a wife or a mother, she is not qualified! If you dont divorce such a person, do you want to keep her for the New Year?\"Qiao Zhen Jun's face turned even more red like he suffocated until he turned into a cooked shrimp.Qiao Xiu Zhi swept a glance over Da Qiao's body and continued: \"I know what you are worried about. Don't worry, your dad and I will look after her more in the future. We won't let her suffer!\"She knew how harsh this world was to women, so she wouldn't say that Qiao Zhen Jun's worries were groundless worries.But she didn't believe that remaining married will allow Da Qiao to have a good future in the future.On the contrary, if Da Qiao continues to live in this environment, she will grow into a timid and low self-esteem person. Even if she is allowed to marry a good family in the future, she will not be able to live well!Qiao Xiu Zhi was a person of great wisdom. She can't say phrase like \"Unfortunate childhood needs a lifetime to heal\", but she deeply understood this concept.Xue Chuan said warmly: \"There is no parent who wants to their children's family to disperse, but Fang Xiao Juan is overboard this time. If Lin Hui wasn't rescued in time, this life will be burden by our Qiao Family. When the time comes, how will you explain to Lin family?\"As if the last straw that crushed the camel, these words broke Qiao Zhen Jun's last persistence.His voice spoke like he had aged: \"Okay, I'll listen to my parents. But can't let Xiao Qiao stay in Fang's house.\"If Xiao Qiao stayed at Fang's house, he worried that one day Xiao Qiao would become the second Fang Xiao Juan.Qiao Xiu Zhi silently laughed.It seems like he will be disappointed. Xiao Qiao probably won't want to come back and follow her paralyzed father!She would just see through and not break through with her mouth. She made an arrangement to go to Fang's house tomorrow morning to discuss divorce.Just when she was about to turn around and leave, she saw the little dumpling in the corner. Standing there timidly and looking pitiful.She walked over, squatted down in front of her ,and asked, \"Do you understand what Grandmother said just now?\"Da Qiao's wet eyes glowed with water. She nodded her little head, and replied softly, \"I, understood.\"\"Then listen carefully. Grandmother wants your parents to divorce because your mom did something wrong. It has nothing to do with you. Later, if your mom scolds you for causing her to divorce and saying that you are a calamity, pay her no heed. Understand?\"Da Qiao nodded. Her eyelashes trembled: \"Grandmother, after the divorce, I, don't have, a mum, anymore?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi fixedly looked at her. At once, she wondered whether her decision was correct at this moment.No one can replace a child's sentimental attachment for their mother. Even when Fang Xiao Juan treated her badly, she still longed for maternal love.She hesitated for a while, stretched out her big palm, and rubbed her little head, \"I don't know what your mother will think. It's just that in the future there will be Grandmother and your grandfather as well as your dad, your eldest uncle and fifth uncle who will dote you. Is it not good?\"Da Qiao held her little fingers up for a long time and finally figured it out.Wow!A total of five people doting her. A lot!Her beautiful apricot eyes lit up again. So clear and translucent: \"Good!\"How could it not be good. She used to only have her dad and Aunt Hui loving her.Now there were four more people. Heaven, she was so blessed.Qiao Xiu Zhi's heart instantly softened. Her eyes fell on her clothes and decided to go back and make some new clothes for her.This evening, Qiao Family made a major decision. While the lights of Lin Family hadn't extinguish for a long time.Wang Qiu Ying beat her daughter with her fist and her old tears flowed: \"You heartless thing. You want your mom's life. If you something happened to you and dies, how am I to live?\"Lin Hui didn't dare to resist and quietly let her mom beat her.In fact, the moment she jumped down the well, she regretted it.Once she dies, Fang Xiao Juan would definitely not feel guilty for it. She would only be even more proud and declaring everywhere that she committed suicide because of a guilty conscience.At that time, not only her family will be implicated by her, but even that person will be subject to everyone's controversy.And little Dong Lin. Once she died, he would become an orphan without a father and no mother. Who will love him then?Seeing her daughter's face pale as paper, Wang Qiu Ying's heart couldn't bear it in the end: \"How many times have I told you, don't get too close to that kid? You never listen. Now you cause trouble for yourself?\"Lin Hui called out weakly, \"Mom, it's nothing to do with Da Qiao!\"Wang Qiu Ying curled her lips: \"What nothing to do with her... Alright, alright, I won't talk. It's nothing to do with her.\"As her mother, how could not tell her daughter liked Qiao Zhen Jun?Back then, she was interested in becoming in-laws with Qiao\u00a0 Family. But before she could speak, a stumbling block appeared halfway and her daughter's marriage thread was broken!On the day of old Second Qiao's wedding, her daughter hid in her room and cried for a long time. After that, she became seriously ill. Afterward, she hurriedly found a man for herself to marry.Unexpectedly, that man was a short-lived ghost and her daughter became a widow at a young age. It deeply cut her heart.Lin Hui held her mother's hand: \"Mom, I'm sorry. I made you worried. I won't do such stupid things again in the future.\"Wang Qiu Ying's eyes reddened at once: \"Okay, Mum believe you!\"If she can make her daughter happy for the rest of her life, she would be willing to shorten her life for 20 years!After turning off the lights, Qiao Xiu Zhi stared at the mosquito net and said, \"I want to leave most of the things to Da Qiao once we're gone. What do you think?\"She wanted to leave more things for the child and then teach her to be self-reliant. Even if no one married her in the future, she wouldn't be unable to live.Xue Chuan: \"Okay.\"She thought about it and continued, \"Tomorrow, remember to remind me to make some clothes for that child.\"Xue Chuan: \"Okay, I will help you remember and I will remind you tomorrow. Why are you suddenly so concerned about that child?\"\"I discovered that child's eyes look the most like yours.\" Qiao Xiu Zhi said it as if it was natural.Xue Chuan smiled, shook his wife's hand and said, \"Then we'll treat that child better.\"After few decades of marriage, the couple still retain the habit of holding hands to sleep. If this is known to Wan Chun Ju, her teeth might feel sour again.When Da Qiao got up the next day, she discovered the pear tree in the yard were actually blooming!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With a \"thump, thump, thump\", her little legs and ran towards the room: \"Dad! Dad!\"Seeing a small dumpling rushing in, Qiao Zhen Jun worried that she might fall, and quickly urged: \"Don't run so fast. Be careful of falling!\"Da Qiao breathlessly halted, patted her chest, and said with a small proud face: \"I can't, fall. I'm awesome.\"Qiao Zhen Jun couldn't help but laugh. He stretched out his hand to squeeze her already fleshy cheeks: \"You came in so excitedly. What do you want to say to Dad?\"Da Qiao put her little face in her dad's hands as her eyes sparkled: \"Dad, the, pear tree, blooming now!\"Qiao Zhen Jun was overcame by surprise: \"The pear tree is blooming? Impossible!\"He subconsciously denied this. Putting aside the fact that the tree had never bloomed before, even if it were to bloom, it wasn't the season to now.Pear trees generally bloom from March to May and bear fruit in September. It was currently December. How can it bloom at this time?But he didn't think that the child was lying. After all, Da Qiao was a well-behaved little dumpling. He only thought that she saw it wrong.Da Qiao saw that her dad didn't believe in her and became anxious. She stamped her little foot and said, \"Really! It's true! it's blooming!\"\"Alright, no need to get anxious. Dad believes you.\" Qiao Zhen Jun soothed, but his attitude was very perfunctory.Da Qiao bit her little lip. Her little, caterpillar-like eyebrows frowned. She looked distressed. Suddenly her eyes lit up and she ran out again.Da Qiao came back soon. Her little face flushed from the exercise, like two little apples. Extremely cute: \"Dad, look!\"She opened her palm to show the pear blossom to her dad. Qiao Zhen Jun leaned over to take a look. He was shocked!It was really a pear blossom!He picked up the small pear blossom and looked at it over and over again. It was indeed a pear blossom. How could this be possible?Da Qiao took in her dad's disbelief and smirked while covering her mouth.At this moment, a voice came from outside. It was someone from Qiao's old house coming over.Da Qiao ran out. At a glance, she saw her grandmother directing the crowd like an empress governing the country: \"Eldest, you move the strong starch powder to the kitchen. Eldest's wife, go and see what other work haven\u2019t been done yet and help out. .\"Turning around, she said in a soft voice to Xue Chuan: \"Just go and sit at the side. There is nothing you need to do here.\"Qiao Zhen Guo merrily followed the instructions.Wan Chun Ju followed in low spirit. She quietly muttered: Mother-in-law can kill wild boar. Mother-in-law can kill wild boar. Mother-in-law can kill me!Qiao Zhen Guo had sharp ears. He can't help but feel amused when he heard his wife's words: \"You are quite self-aware. Knowing that you look like a wild boar!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"\"However, I have thought about it again these days. I feel you are more black like donkey poo than a black mountain pig. Wife, I praise you for being fairer. Are you happy now?\"Qiao Zhen Guo felt women were troublesome. His wife was causing a ruckus with him these past two days, saying that he doesn't care about her like the way his dad cares about his mom. In order to stop his wife from troubling him, he deliberately found something to praise her now.A mouthful of blood stuck in Wan Chun Ju in her chest: \"...\"I thank you! I thank your whole family!Qiao Xiu Zhi heard the conversation between her son and her eldest daughter-in-law in the front and thought what kind of pot goes with what kind of lid. These two idiots matched together perfectly!Wan Chun Ju's heart was blazing. Seeing her mother-in-law went in, she cast her anger on Da Qiao: \"Say, you child, working so slowly. Did you deliberately want to leave the work to me?\"Da Qiao shook her little head: \"I, didn't...\"Wan Chun Ju interrupted her impatiently: \"Don't find excuses. From what I see, you did it on purpose! You kid, you are so bad at a young age... ah ah ah...\"She was lecturing Da Qiao when the old hen on the side acted like it got injected with something for no reason.. It suddenly spread its wings, threw itself to her, and pecked her on her leg's back!It was extremely painful!Damn. It was the first time she seen such a fierce hen in her life!Wan Chun Ju screamed. She wanted to chase the old hen away, but the old hen was in a fighting for her cub stance and kept chasing her.Qiao Zhen Guo came out of the kitchen and saw his wife being chased around the yard by the old hen. He held his belly and laughed like a dog: \"Mom said ugly people gets disdained by dogs. Wife, you must be too ugly. It's why this old hen pecked you !\"Wan Chun Ju whose heart was pricked until there were thousands of holes: \"...\"Heartbroken, old iron!Qiao Xiu Zhi came out from the inside and happened to hear this. She almost rolled her eyes to the sky!She had never said this before. What she said was hateful people gets disdained by dogs. Not ugly people gets disdained by dogs!Not wanting to waste her tongue with the two idiots, she carried her second onto a stretcher. Then she called her eldest son to come in and carry with her to Fang's house.When she walked out of the small courtyard, she saw that little dumpling Da Qiao blinkingly looked at her with big eyes. It made people's heart goes soft: \"If you want to go, follow us.\"Da Qiao's big eyes curved into crescents and happily followed.Wan Chun Ju stepped forward: \"Mom, I want to go too.\"She didn't want to stay with the old hen any longer!Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't even look at her and heartlessly refused: \"You stay and do housework. If I come back and find out that you were being lazy, you will sleep in the henhouse tonight!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Her husband pierced her heart. Her mother-in-law acted like the queen. This life is unbearable!There was a lot of stir along the way. The villagers quickly found out and came over to ask them what they were going to do.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't intend to hide it, \"Go to Fang's house and let Second divorce Fang Xiao juan!\"Divorce!My heaven. Although every mother-in-law had clamored about divorcing and sending her daughter-in-law back to her maternal home, but it was only all talk. There was no one who really implemented it!And now Qiao Xiu Zhi actually carried her son to divorce!What a display!This time there was another good show!No one wanted to miss such a good show. So they followed behind Qiao's family. After a while, many people gathered behind Qiao's family.Fang's family was beaten until plump last night. Their vitality was severely injured. Among them, Fang Fu Gui suffered the most serious injury. His nose and face were swollen. He couldn't get out of bed today.Fang Xiao Juan didn't fare any better. Her cheeks were swollen and two teeth were broken. The most wrecking matter was that she always felt the taste of chicken poo in her mouth!Old woman Fang punched the ground and cried like her son died: \"Injustice! Bullying us orphans and widow. Oh heaven, why don't you open your eyes and take a look!\"Fang Xiao Juan felt annoyed for a while: \"Mom, can you stop for a while!? You've been crying all night!\"Old woman Fang seemed to be pumped with adrenaline as she jumped up from the ground, rushed over, and slapped her twice: \"It's all you, a calamity star's fault. If you didn't come home, how could your eldest brother get beaten? Get out now!\"Fang Xiao Juan's face tingled with pain. What truly made her sad was her mother's words. Why didn't she say this when she took her money?At this moment, the wooden door of the Fang's house that had only been installed recently was knocked down again with a \"bang\".Fang mother and daughter shuddered together.It couldn't be Lin Family coming over again, right?Just when the two mother and daughter wanted to hide, Qiao Xiu Zhi's figure appeared.The two breathed a sigh of relief.Old woman Fang greeted her with tears in her eyes: \"My in-laws, you are finally here! You didn't know that we were bullied so badly. You have to vent our anger for us!\"Fang Xiao Juan also thought that her mother-in-law was here to support herself. After all, she was the daughter-in-law of Qiao Family. Hitting her was equivalent to hitting Qiao Family in the face.Only Xiao Qiao sitting in the corner didn't think so.Qiao Xiu Zhi shook off old woman Fang's hand: \"Your Fang family isn't doing well, but you can still dream so beautiful! However, we aren't here to vent your anger for your Fang Family!\"Old woman Fang was dumbfounded: \"Then why did In-law come?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi pointed to Fang Xiao Juan and said: \"Husband is paralyzed. She left her husband and went back to her maternal family. Rumors about her husband spread outside. She didn't help explain, but instead poured dirty water. Such a daughter-in-law, our Qiao Family can't afford to have, so ...\"Fang Xiao Juan's heart thumped. She had a very bad premonition. It couldn't be that her mother-in-law want to...The next moment, she heard her mother-in-law determinately said: \"I want my Second to divorce her!\"With a bang, a bolt from the blue struck!All the young and old of Fang Family were stunned!\"Mom, what are you talking about?\" Fang Xiao Juan heard her voice trembling.Wasn\u2019t it a little too late to be afraid now?Qiao Xiu Zhi chuckled: \"Getting you two divorced. You never liked Second anyway, right?\"Fang Xiao Juan's weakly defended: \"I don't...\"But before she finished speaking, her mom pushed aside: \"In-law, a married out daughter is thrown out water. Our family won't take this daughter back. If you don't want her, then let her die!\"After being stabbed by her mother-in-law, Fang Xiao Juan was stabbed again by her mom.Qiao Xiu Zhi sneered: \"Whether she die or not, they are divorced anyway. The two of them did not get a marriage certificate, so we came over to let you know. From now on, our Qiao Family and Fang Family are no longer relatives! \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Still not kneel down to your mother-in-law and ask her to forgive you!\"Fang Xiao Juan's head tilted from the hit. Her originally red and swollen face looked even more terrible.But old woman Fang didn't care about her daughter's life or death. She pulled her hair to make her kneel down toward Qiao Xiu Zhi.Fang Xiao Juan trembled with anger and screamed: \"Mom, let go. Are you trying to force me to death?\"\"You calamity star! If your mother-in-law refuses to forgive you, you can run toward the wall and kill yourself, so you won't ruin our Fang family's reputation!\"Seeing that her daughter was still \"unrepentant\" at this time, old woman Fang hated her so badly that she stretched out her hand and pinched her on the waist!\"Ah, let go... it hurts...\" Fang Xiao Juan screamed in pain. Her heart held hatred toward her mom too.Qiao Xiu Zhi had her arms crossed and coldly watched the mother and daughter cut at each other/. She had no intention of stepping forward to persuade them to not fight.The villagers outside looked on very anxious.These two idiots. What's the point of turning against each other? Go have a tear at Qiao Xiu Zhi!However, some people thought it through. Mother and daughter will at most get surface injuries from fighting themselves. If Qiao Xiu Zhi was provoked, it was estimated that one punch can send them to see their ancestors!Fang Xiao Juan's scalp was almost torn off. She couldn't bear it and pushed her mother away with force out of the blue.Mother Fang's back slammed against the corner of the table behind her. She started to cry: \"Goddamn, my life is so bitter. I have given birth to such a calamity star. I'm doing it for her own good and she don\u2019t appreciate it. Instead, she beat her mother. I can\u2019t live anymore...\"Everyone: \"...\"Still the familiar flavor, the familiar recipe.No wonder they were mother and daughter.Qiao Xiu Zhi had watched enough of this scene and didn't want to waste time on these idiots. She spoke coldly: \"Enough. Shut up!\"Old woman Fang looked like an old hen pinched around her neck. Her mouth was wide open, but she didn't dare to make a sound.Qiao Xiu Zhi: \"As we are all from Qili Village, you should have heard of my character even if you don\u2019t personally know me. What I said, I will stick to it. So even if your whole family die in front of me today, Fang Xiao Juan must divorce with Second!\"Old woman Fang: \"...\" It's your whole family who die!Fang Xiao Juan: \"...\" I really want to tear apart this old witch's face!Why did she have to divorce because she said so. Even if she wanted to divorce, it was her, Fang Xiao Juan, who didn't want paralyzed Qiao Zhen jun!In fact, Fang Xiao Juan had already thought of divorce after Xiao Qiao kept blowing the wind during this period. She had secretly met with Wang Xin Sheng few times in private.In order to win the beauty, Wang Xin Sheng had spent his money. Such as vanishing cream, malted milk extract, and arrowroot powder. Ordinary people can't get these even with money. He gifted them to Fang Family like it cost nothing.It was just that Fang Xiao Juan hadn't been able to make up her mind.First, she was worried that she would be criticized by others. Qiao Zhen Jun was only paralyzed for a month and she couldn't wait to divorce and remarry. Once this incident happens, she would definitely be drowned by everyone's saliva.Another reason was Wang Xin Sheng.Although Wang Xin Sheng wasn't ugly, his look couldn't match with Qiao Zhen Jun. The most unbearable thing was that he didn't like hygiene. Every time she saw him grinning at her with yellow teeth, she wanted to spit out her supper!Before, she always nitpicked at Qiao Zhen Jun. But now she had Wang Xin Sheng as comparison, she knew how likeable Qiao Zhen Jun was.No matter how wonderful, it was all in the past. Qiao Zhen Jun was now paralyzed. Not only can he not make money to support the family, but he also needed to be taken care of in all aspects of life. Also he can't satisfy in husband and wife's matter. It was why she didn't cruelly reject Wang Xin Sheng.She originally planned to drag it and bathe in both sides' advantage. Drag it until the day she can't. She never thought Qiao Zhen Jun would actually file for divorce before her!The more she thought about it, the more she hated it. With her chin held up, she spoke \"I don't want to divorce, so why should I divorce because you said so!\"\"Yes. We won't get a divorce!\" Fang Fu Gui was supported out by his wife. His face was blue and swollen. One couldn't bear to look at it directly.When Fang Xiao Juan saw her brother come out, she gained confidence in an instant. It was obvious that she had forgotten how her brother had been so scared the other day.Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at them and asked, \"Then what will it take for you to get a divorce?\"Fang Fu Gui and Fang Xiao Juan originally thought that they would face fierce resistance, but they didn't expect Qiao Xiu Zhi to speak so nicely today!Fang Fu Gui's eyes rolled around and said: \"Divorce is not impossible. Qiao Family has to pay my little sister a thousand yuan divorce fee!\"One thousand yuans!Although Qiao Family was wealthy, they can't come up with so much money. These two siblings open their mouth lion-wide!Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't agree or disagree.Fang Fu Gui swallowed, \"A thousand won't do, then 800.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi smiled: \"I don't have any money. Do you want a fist?\"The siblings shook their heads together.Don't want it. Dare not want it!Qiao Xiu Zhi snorted coldly: \"You have to figure out one thing. Our Qiao family came here today, not to discuss with you, but to inform you!\"Simply overbearing!The anger in Fang Xiao Juan's her heart birthed her courage: \"Is there a mother-in-law like you? Wishing for son and his wife to break apart and children to scatter. Makes me wonder if Qiao Zhen Jun is your biological son?\"Everyone was shocked again.She dared to sow discord in this way. Everyone respected her as a warrior.Some people were excited: Hit her. Auntie Qiao quickly beat her!Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't take any notice of the botched provocation. Anyone who wasn't blind can tell how much Qiao Zhen Jun and Xue Chuan looked alike.She gave Fang Xiao Juan a cold stare, then turned to Qiao Zhen Jun and stated: \"Second, you come and tell her personally. This way, she won't keep pestering.\"When Fang Xiao Juan heard this, she was so angry that she wanted to vomit blood!Would she pester Qiao Zhen Jun, a paralyzed man? Was she blind!?Qiao Zhen Jun didn't sleep all night last night. He didn't feel relaxed at all when he made such a decision. It was just that the words were out. He won't change his mind.He sighed and said: \"Xiao Juan, the divorce matter has nothing to do with my parents. It is my decision! From now on, we will walk our own path and not interfere with each other. As for the two children, they follow me.\"\"You're dreaming!\" Fang Xiao Juan almost poked his face with her finger, \"Da Qiao, that calamity, no one will snatch with you. But Xiao Qiao must follow me!\"Since they arrived, Da Qiao stood quietly and obediently in the corner.When she saw her mom fighting with her grandma, she was worried about her mother. Unexpectedly, she received another merciless stab from her.Her long and dense eyelashes were trembling and a layer of water quickly misted her eyes. Her small lips were tightly pressed. Her persistance on not crying appearance was pitiful and affection-garnering.Xue Chuan frowned. He stretched out his hand to hold the little dumpling's hand and said warmly: \"You aren't a calamity. You are Qiao Family's big precious and blessed star. With you present, I believe that Qiao family will get better and better.\"When dumpling Da Qiao heard what grandfather said, her heart seemed to be wrapped in something soft and warm.She held her grandfather's hand and snuggled up on grandfather's lap.Compared to Xue Chuan, Qiao Xiu Zhi was much simpler and crude!She stepped forward and lifted Fang Xiao Juan from the ground, and coldly uttered: \"If you let me hear you call the child a calamity again, then don't blame my fists for not having eyes!\"Although Fang Xiao Juan was very slender, she was tall and weighed over ninety jins. Still, Qiao Xiu Zhi can lift her as easily as a baby chicken. This strength was really scary!Fang Xiao Juan almost sobbed!She trembled uncontrollably and couldn't say a word!Simply an embarrassing sight!Qiao Xiu Zhi threw her away like trash and looked at Xiao Qiao: \"Everyone says you are smart. I believe you understand the conversation just now. What do you think? Do you want to go back to Qiao's house or stay at Fang's house? Make your own decision!\"Qiao Zhen Jun and the others were a little shocked. Never thought Qiao Xiu Zhi would hand over the decision on this matter to Xiao Qiao!Fang Xiao Juan dashed over to hug Xiao Qiao and said with a swollen face: \"Jiao Jiao'er, you must choose to be with Mom. Your dad is a paralyzed man. Following him, you will definitely suffer!\"Everyone looked at Qiao Zhen Jun with sympathetic eyes for marrying such a wife. It was really eight lifetimes of bad luck.Qiao Zhen Jun's face turned red and white. The vein on the back of his hand was exposed.Xiao Qiao acted like she was pondering. After a long time, she looked at her grandmother and answered, \"Grandmother, I want to stay at Fang's house.\"\"Hahaha...\" Fang Xiao Juan stepped up with hands on hip, raised her head and laughed, \"You heard it yourself. Xiao Qiao doesn't want to go back to Qiao's house with you at all!\"Xiao Qiao internally called her an 'idiot' and then walked to her dad: \"Jiao Jiao likes Dad very much. Sister has already followed Dad. Mom is so pitiful by herself, so...that's why Jiao Jiao wants to stay with her. Dad, don\u2019t blame Jiao Jiao, okay?\"Everyone suddenly realized that Xiao Qiao stayed in Fang's house because of this.What a well-behaved and caring child!Really don\u2019t know how a person like Fang Xiao Juan gave birth to such a well-behaved and smart child?Qiao Zhen Jun was embarrassed: \"Xiao Qiao, do you really not want to go back with Dad? Although Dad can't walk anymore, Dad will definitely not let you be wronged!\"Xiao Qiao's big eyes blinked and two lines of tears flowed down: \"Jiao Jiao doesn't want to leave Dad or Mom. Jiao Jiao doesn't know what to do?\"Qiao Zhen Jun felt that his heart would break from the child's cry.It was his fault. If he didn't divorce, the child will not have to face such a painful choice!Xiao Qiao looked at Da Qiao with tearful eyes: \"Sister, please try to persuade Dad with me and get Dad to not divorce Mom. I know you don't like Mom, but if Dad and Mom divorce, we won't have a family!\"When dumpling Da Qiao heard her little sister's words, she panicked: \"No, I don't dislike...\"Xiao Qiao interrupted her: \"Sister, I know all about it. But it's not the time to talk about this. Sister, please come over and persuade Dad!\"Everyone's gaze toward Da Qiao's eyes suddenly changed slightly.Compared with the sensible and well-behaved Xiao Qiao, Da Qiao was simply a white-eyed wolf!At a young age, she actually hoped that her parents divorce. When such a child grow up, she'll be a source of disaster!Although dumpling Da Qiao was young, she can still naively sense everyone's unkind gazes. Her face flushed with anxiousness.Watching Xiao Qiao say a few words and passed the black pot to Da Qiao's body, Qiao Xiu Zhi's face instantly sank: \"You want to stay, then stay. What do you do to use Da Qiao as a raft? At a young age, your mind is like a hornet's nest. A child like you, our Qiao Family doesn't want at all! Zhen Guo, let's go home!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And she wasn't?Biased old witch!When everyone heard Qiao Xiu Zhi's words, they were shocked.Some people caught on and felt that Xiao Qiao's attitude just now was indeed a bit weird. But majority of the people didn't believe it. After all, Xiao Qiao's image of being well-behaved and sensible was deeply embedded into their mind.More importantly, Xiao Qiao was only six years old!How can a six-year-old child have a scheming heart? Qiao Xiu Zhi must have over thoughtQiao Xiu Zhi didn't care what others thought at all. She lifted the stretcher and left.Once more, she walked out of sassy and heroicly.Qiao Zhen Jun didn't believe his mom's in his heart and was even worried that those words would hurt Xiao Qiao's young heart. However, he couldn't move by himself. So it was useless to worry.As soon as Qiao Xiu Zhi left, Xiao Qiao started her performance.They watched her grasping the corners of her clothes with her little hands and whispered: \"Uncles and aunts, did Jiao Jiao say something wrong? Why does Grandmother scold Jiao Jiao like this? Jiao Jiao is so sad...uuu...\"The little person reddened her eyes and her tears kept falling like golden beans. This kind of silent cry made one's heart ached the most.Everyone comforted her.Fang Xiao Juan broke into scolding and rolled her sleeves up with desire to head to Qiao's house to settle the account. But was stopped by Xiao Qiao.She told her mom in front of everyone that Qiao's and Fang's were her relatives. She didn't want to see them at odds.What a cute and well-behaved child? How can she be a scheming person?Everyone completely got rid of their doubts.After everyone left, Fang Family suddenly realized that Fang Xiao Juan was divorced. Their Fang Family didn't even get the slightest benefit!Suddenly they thumped their chest in anger and cursed Qiao Family for overbearingly bullying them!But no matter how they scolded, the whole family dare not go to Qiao's house to settle accounts.Back to Qiao's small courtyard.As soon as Qiao Xiu Zhi stepped in, she saw Wan Chun Ju rushing towards her with great excitement: \"Mom! Mom, you are finally back!\"If a clueless person saw this excitement, they would think they were mother and daughter who had been separated for many years.Qiao Xiu Zhi got a headache when she saw her eldest daughter-in-law's stupidity and disgruntledly said: \"What are you doing? Don't bump into here. Don't you see us carrying someone?\"If she had been scolded like this before, Wan Chun Ju would definitely pout so much that one an oil bottle could hang on. But at this moment, not the slightest unhappiness could be seen.She leaned hard on her mother-in-law: \"Mom, I have done all the housework? Can I leave now?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi was also very curious about her behavior. But before she could speak, she heard Qiao Zhen Guo say in a hoarse voice: \"Wife, we just come back and you're in a hurry to leave. It seems suspicious. Did you steal something from Second Brother's house?\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"What kind of man did she marry?One in disagreement, he will stick poo on her. Did she not want face?It was a pity that Qiao Zhen Guo couldn't read faces. He pointed to the old hen behind her and continued to babble: \"Wife, I haven't seen you in a while and you become buddy with this old hen? Must say, you two look alike!\"Wan Chun Ju reddened like was suffocating: \"...\"This silly goof don't know how to talk, then can't he close his mouth!Comparing her and the hen as sisters. Then what had he become. The old hen's brother-in-law?What goddamn sisters!When Qiao Xiu Zhi heard her son's astoundingly stupid words again, she rolled her eyes and told herself: This is her biological son. Biological son. Definitely biological!No matter how she disliked, she can only complyingly accept it. Otherwise, what else can she do!However, right now, she noticed the old hen had been following Wan Chun Ju's footsteps. Don't know if it was her imagination but she kept getting the feeling that the old hen's gaze toward Wan Chun Ju...was hostile?Wan Chun Ju felt like she was immersed in bitter water. She had it hard!She just lectured Da Qiao a few words and this old hen treated her like a cub-killing enemy. It was enough that she pecked her before. Now she followed her every step of the way!Whenever she wanted to be lazy or be a little heavy-handed, it will peck her!Like peck her really hard!Both of her feet must be bruised now!Da Qiao walked in with her grandfather last. The old hen saw her coming in and immediately flapped her wings to greet her. Her chest vibrated with cooing sound.Da Qiao was very happy to see Gu Gu. She had always took care of this old hen. The affection was cultivated.Wan Chun Ju breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that the old hen stopped staring at her.However her scar healed and she forgot the pain. She looked at the old hen as she spoke, \"Mom, I heard this old hen hadn't lay eggs for a long time. How about killing it during the New Year?\"As soon as her voice fell, the old hen turned her head and shot a death beam at her. Then she fluttered her wings again and leaped towards her.Start of! Death! Chase!\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh...Zhen Guo, save me. Quick, save me...\" Wan Chun Ju screamed out of fright.Why did the old hen understand her?Wasn\u2019t it said that animals cannot evolve after the founding of the country?Of course Qiao Zhen Guo didn't go up to help her. He laughed like a dog once again: \"Hahaha...Wife, your body is too bad. You run so slowly. The old hen is about to catch up with you!\"Wan Chun Ju was close to tears from anger!Chicken flew and dog jumped in Qiao's small courtyard. It was so lively that Qiao Zhen Jun's divorce depression dissipated a lot.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't think there was anything to be depressed about. On the contrary, she felt that without troublemaker Fang Xiao Juan, Qiao Family would definitely get better in the future.It would be better if old Second's legs could stand up again. Her eyes fell on his legs. In the end, she shook her head.What was she thinking? The doctor had said even the operation was useless. For the rest of his life, Second can only spend it in bed.In order to celebrate the divorce, Qiao Xiu Zhi deliberately slaughtered two fish to eat. One stewed in soup and the other steamed. The family merrily ate it. Even a smile returned to Wan Chun Ju's face.After lunch, the people of old Qiao's house went back.Dumpling Da Qiao went into her dad's room with her head hanging down and hands clutching on the corner of her clothes.Taking her in, Qiao Zhen Jun asked worriedly: \"Why are you slouching? Do you feel uncomfortable?\"Da Qiao drooped her little head, shook her head and said: \"I, don't, feel, uncomfortable.\"Qiao Zhen Jun was a little puzzled: \"Then do you have something to tell Dad?\"Da Qiao grabbed the corners of her clothes and kneaded them into a ball: \"Dad, you, divorced mom, because, of me, right?\"Grandmother had said that they divorced because her mom did something wrong. But the reason why her mom returned to her grandma's house was because of her. Her mom wanted to drive her away and her father refused. So they quarreled.She felt terrible.Was it like her mom said? Because she was a calamity, she will bring misfortune and disaster to her relatives?Thinking back, her dad fell into the ditch due to protecting her. And he still hadn't gotten better. The more Da Qiao pondered about it, the sadder she got. Tears fell like dropped pearls.The little dumpling stood there with golden beans falling. Her cheeks stained with tears. Her helpless and pitiful appearance made people feel heartbroken.Qiao Zhen Jun felt as if his heart had been severely pinched by something.He knew that Fang Xiao Juan wasn't good to this child. He had warned Fang Xiao Juan not to treat the child harshly.On the surface, Fang Xiao Juan agreed. With a turn of a head, she pretended to obey. He always get angered but never thought of divorcing her.It was because of his forbearance and concession that Fang Xiao Juan became worst. And let her grind the child into this current state!Seeing her short stature, he was full of self-blame.When the child was first born, the child was fair and plump. Very gratifying. While Xiao Qiao was as thin as a kitten. Now it was the other way round. When the two sisters stood together, she was half a head shorter than Xiao Qiao.Qiao Zhen Jun's eyes uncomfortably ached. He beckoned her over with his hand and said, \"Come. Come to Dad.\"Da Qiao walked over.Qiao Zhen Jun said softly: \"Your grandmother had told you before that your dad and mom divorced not because of you. But because your mom did something wrong. She almost caused your auntie Hui to die. So Dad decided to divorce with her. It\u2019s not your fault, understand?\"Da Qiao heard her dad repeatedly emphasize that this matter had nothing to do with her. It was not her fault. She finally felt better in her heart.But remembering Xiao Qiao, her brows frowned again: \"Then, sister? She, won't, come back?\"Thinking of Xiao Qiao, Qiao Zhen Jun's heart received another fierce jab.He was really a useless dad. It was enough that he couldn't protect one daughter. He let the other daughter live a good life. He deserved to die!But he didn't want to expose his emotion in front of his daughter. He reached out and rubbed her fluffy yellow hair and said, \"Sister is following your mom. Each person get one is fair, right?\"Da Qiao thought about it for a while and felt it was right. Her eyes curved into small crescents. The teardrops on her long and dense eyelashes trembled: \"Then I, follow, dad!\"Qiao Zhen Jun took in her cute appearance and his heart softened: \"Then do you like to follow Dad?\"Dumpling Da Qiao nodded her head: \"Like! Really like!\"She said like twice. As if this could express her feelings. Qiao Zhen Jun couldn't help but smile.The news of Fang Xiao Juan and Qiao Zhen Jun\u2019s divorce spread. Lin Hui knew it that night.She sat on the kang with a shocked look and did not speak for a long time.Wang Qiu Ying came in with a bowl of meat and saw her daughter's dumbfounded expression. She reached out and touched her forehead: \"No fever. What are you doing sitting like this?\"Lin Hui recovered and shook her head: \"It's nothing.\"Wang Qiu Ying put the meat on the kang table: \"If nothing, then come over and eat the meat. Mom specially saved it for you!\"Lin Hui saw a bowl full of meat and her heart was warm: \"Mom, eat with me. I can't eat so much by myself.\"Wang Qiu Ying waved her hand: \"Mom has eaten. You eat more. By the way, about your second sister-in-law's matter. Your second brother has already lectured her. Later, Mom will scold her a bit. So don't take it to heart. Understand?\"Because her daughter-in-law's unreliability led to her daughter being beaten. Wang Qiu Ying hated her, but she couldn't do anything. After she and old man leave in the future, her daughter would have to rely on her brothers and sisters-in-law.Lin Hui didn't blame her second sister-in-law in the first place: \"Don't worry, Mom. I won't blame Second Sister-in-law.\"Wang Qiu Ying was relieved to see that she was sensible and picked up the meat for her: \"Look, you are as thin as a bamboo pole. Eat more and regain the flesh back soon!\"Lin Hui pushed the meat around in the bowl and hesitated for a long time before uttering, \"Mom, I heard that Fang Xiao Juan couple have divorced. Is this... true?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What do you want to do?\"Lin Hui's face became hot. and she rebuked: \"Mom, what can I do? I'm just curious.\"Wang Qiu Ying examined her with piercing eyes: \"I don't care what you are thinking or what plans you have. Dispelled them all otherwise don't recognize me as your mom!\"As her mother, she knew her daughter. She knew what she was thinking better than anyone else!If it was before, she won't stop her. But now old Second Qiao was disabled and needed to be taken care of in every aspect. Marrying such a person would mean seeking one's own death?So no matter what, she can't let her daughter do stupid things!Lin Hui's face turned pale. She lowered her head and said, \"Mom! I really didn't think of doing anything!\"Even if she wanted to do something, will that person accept her?What will other people say about them?Wang Qiu Ying saw that she didn't seem to be lying and eased her expression: \"You ah. You have been stubborn since you were a child. Mom is afraid that you will think astray! You are still young. After waiting for a year or two, Mom will find a good man. Then you have another child and can keep living.\"Lin Hui's face turned paler: \"Mom, I never thought about remarrying!\"\"How can a woman not marry? Are you planning to live alone for the rest of your life?\"\"Mom!\"\"Alright, Mom won't talk anymore.\"Wang Qiu Ying saw her daughter's face getting more and more ugly, so she can only shut up.Anyway, Dong Lin was still young now. It wasn't too late to find one after one or two years.For the villagers of Qili Village this winter was one juicy scene after another.A few days after the divorce between Fang Xiao Juan and Qiao Zhen Jun, Song's house was splashed with dung on a dark and windy night!Song Family slept very soundly. Only when they woke up the next morning did they see the golden yellow poo in the courtyard. Each and every one of them almost vomited out their overnight meal!Old Madam Song was so infuriated that she almost passed away on the spot!Who was so wicked? Who can't had a grudge with Song Family?After some inquiry and investigation, the target was old Madam Song's eldest daughter-in-law... Song Jin Lai's wife.Before Song Jin Lai\u2019s wife blamed Lin Hui for tattling to Qiao Xiu Zhi and caused her to be beaten by her mother-in-law and husband. In anger, she ran back to her maternal family to spread Lin Hui and old Second Qiao's matter.She never thought things would get out of hand.In fact, the person who tattled to Qiao Xiu Zhi wasn't Lin Hui at all. But was Song Jin Lai's wife's second sister-in-law, Zhang Ru Lan.The two of them have never gotten along. They often fought at home. Zhang Ru Lan heard what she said to Da Qiao from her room that day and ran back to complain to Qiao Xiu Zhi.When old Madam Song knew the truth, her lips trembled with anger: \"You family-ruining woman! Eldest, send this woman back to her maternal home. Our Song Family can't afford such a daughter-in-law!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi's move of \"divorcing\" her daughter-in-law had opened a new door to these mother-in-laws in Qili Village. In recent days, several mother-in-laws have sent their daughter-in-law back to her maternal home.When Song Jin Lai's wife heard this, her whole body was trembling: \"Mom, you can beat me with a rolling pin. If one isn't enough, go for round two. You mustn't send me back to my maternal home!\"Old Madam Song coldly snorted: \"I think it takes too much effort to beat you! Eldest, what are you standing there for? Still not sending this family-ruining thing away now?\"Song Jin Lai didn't dare to defy his mom. He pulled his wife out of the door.So on this day, all the villagers in Qili Village saw Song Jin Lai\u2019s wife screaming like a pig as she got sent back to her maternal home.Wan Chun Ju, who witnessed this scene with her own eyes, had trouble sleeping and eating. She even ate one bowl of rice less than usual!Seeing her like this, Qiao Zhen Guo couldn't help but curiously say: \"Wife, you usually have a big appetite like a pig. You have to eat three bowls of rice each meal. Why do you eat so little these two days? In the past few years, you only ate so little when were pregnant with Third.\"\"...\"Can you speak nicely?A mouthful of old blood was stuck on Wan Chun Ju's chest and almost fainted from fury!But his words reminded her that she can pretend to be pregnant. As long as she was pregnant, she will not be beaten or get sent back to her maternal family!She was so smart!So Wan Chun Ju was \"pregnant\".When she was eating the next day, she dry-heaved. The sound was loud that everyone couldn't not notice it.Qiao Xiu Zhi asked her: \"Eldest's wife, are you feeling unwell?\"Wan Chun Ju put on a shy expression: \"Mom, I'm probably pregnant. I have a poor appetite in the past two days. All reactions are the same as when I was pregnant with An Ping.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't suspect that she was lying and said indifferently: \"Oh, then nurture it well.\"Wan Chun Ju was a little dissatisfied with her mother-in-law\u2019s reaction but she didn't dare to say it. She turned her head and saw her man immersed in gobbling. She became even more dissatisfied: \"Zhen Guo, I'm pregnant. Don't you have something to say?\"\"Say what?\" Qiao Zhen Guo looked up from the bowl with a dazed expression.After a pause, he suddenly remembered that his wife wanted him to care about her. He scratched his chin and said: \"At this age, you are considered an old clam birthing pearl. In the future, don't provoke the old hen of old Second's house. Be careful that the baby might leave due to your running!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Old clam birthing pearl, you pig head!She was only thirty years old!Also, did she provoke the old hen? It was obviously the old hen who had a grudge against her, okay?Wan Chun Ju was so angry that she had a stomachache. Originally, she was pretending to have a bad appetite. Now she didn't have to pretend it at all.Qiao Xiu Zhi was not surprised by her son's stupidity. She calmly picked some food for Xue Chuan: \"Eat more.\"Xue Chuan smiled and gave her some too: \"You eat more too.\"Qiao Zhen Guo picked up his wife's bowl and poured all the food into his bowl, \"Since you can't eat it, just give it to me.\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Without comparison, there was no harm!Can't live! These! Days!Fang Xiao Juan had been hiding and didn't dare to go out. Once the wound on her face healed, she went out and start to act up.Whenever she met people, she would spout how Da Qiao was a calamity: \"Look at this. This is bringing catastrophe to all relatives. Who gets involved, who gets unlucky! Just wait and watch how unlucky everyone in Qiao Family will be. See if Qiao Family can say that calamity is a blessing then!\"Some, who didn't mind adding to the fire and wanted to see drama, ran to tell Qiao Xiu Zhi.After hearing this, Qiao Xiu Zhi calmly pointed to the pear tree in the corner of the yard and stated: \"After that woman married in, the pear tree had never bloomed. The pear tree blossomed as soon as old Second divorced her. Who is the calamity? Heaven is the most clear on this!\"Everyone ran to the corner of the courtyard to take a look. Oh my god, the pear tree that had been dying for seven or eight years was blooming!What's more, it was currently December. It was actually blooming at this time!Was its fate really suppressed by Fang Xiao Juan before?Soon this matter spread. Many people came to Qiao's small yard to see the pear blossom every day.Everyone was discussing about this matter.With so many discussion, some people believed that Fang Xiao Juan was actually the calamity. Look, when she married into Qiao Family, Qiao Family was full of unrest. As soon as she returned to her maternal home, Fang Fu Gui was beaten!If this wasn't calamity, what was?Fang Xiao Juan almost broke her teeth from grinding after hearing these words!That old witch, Qiao Xiu Zhi. In order to wash away Da Qiao's calamity label, she unexpectedly poured dirty water on her!So sinister and vicious. She wasn't afraid of retribution!On this day, she deliberately woke up early and took two unwashed clothes over to the river.\"Don't say that I didn't warn you in advance. You'd better not go to the Qiao's small courtyard anymore. With that calamity present, you'll become unlucky!\"\"How else would I bleed and damage my body back then? Wasn't it because the calamity came out feet first! Which one of these ten miles and eight villages was like her? She almost killed two relatives when being born!\"\"This was fine since we are still alive with working hands and feet. While old Second Qiao had it worst. He can only lie in bed for the rest of his life. He's completely disabled! To put it in ugly words, if no one helps him, he can only sh*t on the bed when he need to go the sh*t. Hahaha...\"Everyone found her speech unpleasant, but it was difficult to refute.After all, all these things were connected with Da Qiao. Alright, they should tell the children at home to keep them away from Da Qiao. That way it'll prevent them from getting affected by her bad luck aura!Fang Xiao Juan saw that everyone believed her words and spoke more vigorously. When everyone had washed all the clothes, she hadn't taken hers out yet.However, she didn't plan to wash it anymore. She stood up and prepared to go back with everyone. The way back was so long. She can still sing another round.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh...\" She suddenly slipped and her whole flung forward.BANG!Her forehead was knocked heavily on the quartzite for washing clothes. The sound was so loud that everyone can feel her pain.Fang Xiao Juan felt a sharp pain in her forehead. She raised her head and can stars in front of her eyes. A warm liquid flowed down from her forehead.Someone yelled: \"Xiao Juan, you're bleeding!\"Fang Xiao Juan instantly became anxious. She had already lost two teeth. She mustn't get marred by scar. She had to go to the hospital immediately!She used the steps to support herself up. Suddenly her vision turned black and her body was weak. Following that, she fell backward.BANG!She fell heavily into the river and splashed water on everyone.Everyone: \"...\"What kind of show was this?The river was freezing to the bones. Fang Xiao Juan's teeth trembled from the cold.She panicked. Like a hen in water, she flopped desperately: \"Help...I can't...swim...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was parentless. Because he was poor and lazy, he was still a bachelor at the age of twenty-five.Gou Sheng always liked to go to places where women gathered. Even if he can't take advantage of them, he can have an eye-feast.When Fang Xiao Juan fell into the water, he was digging his nose as he strolled coming over to this place. Hearing the call for help, he immediately turned into a \"crazy\" man and rushed over. He jumped into the river with a \"splash\".Fang Xiao Juan felt someone was pulling herself and immediately used her all limbs to latch onto him tightly.\"Xiao Juan, don't hug so tight!\" Although the beauty in embrace was ecstasy,\u00a0both of them will die here\u00a0if this continued!How could Fang Xiao Juan possibly understand this. Instead she hugged him tighter.The women by the river looked at each other. They were all\u00a0 wiggling their eyebrows.In everyone's presence, she hugged a man! Afraid it wasn't possible for Fang Xiao Juan to not marry Gou Sheng!Gou Sheng was happy despite the pain. He finally dragged Fang Xiao Juan ashore after so much effort.Fang Xiao Juan's face was dark green and her head was dizzy. It wasn't until Gou Sheng hovering over with a yellow set of teeth did she found out who saved her.Her vision went dark. Before she could breather, she immediately fainted.Da Qiao didn't know about her mom falling into the water. At the moment, she was studying her short hand.She fiddled with her radish-like hands and looked at it over and over again. Then she pulled up her sleeves for comparison. Afterward, she was surprised to find that her hands were really fair! Not the left radish! The right one!</tbody></table>Not only had it become fairer, but it had also become so smooth!She dared to say that even her little sister's hands weren't as fair or smooth as hers!She started doing housework at the age of three. Sweeping the floor, cooking and washing clothes. The water was so cold especially in winter. Her hands had frostbite every time. So her hands were always rough and ugly.But in the past two days, her hands were getting fairer and smoother every day!What was going on here?She sat on the door mound. Her little hands supported her chin as she pondered for a while. Then she suddenly recalled the koi jade pendant the little fish gave her.Since that day, the koi jade pendant dropped two jade beads every day.Every time she threw the jade beads into the water and waited for them to melt before throwing them away.The pear tree was blooming and her hands became white and smooth. Could it be related to the jade beads?The more she thought about it, the more she felt it was possible. She immediately went back to her room and called for the koi jade pendant to come out of her palm.The koi jade pendant appeared in her palm. She touched the koi's eyes and whispered: \"I, want, jade beads.\"As soon as her voice fell, two jade beads fell out of the jade eyes.She fetched a basin of warm water, and then threw the jade beads in. After it melted, she washed her face with the water.After washing her face, she washed her hands. Finally, she took it outside and poured it out. But this time, she didn't water the pear tree\u00a0 but the withered rose bush on the opposite side.After she was done, she ran to get a small mirror and took a look under the sun. She felt she was a little fairer.Qiao Zhen Jun watched the little dumpling from the window as she looked left and right in the mirror. This vanity successfully made him laugh.Little dumpling Da Qiao heard her father's laughter. Her little cheek flushed. She shyly ran over, raised her head and asked in a babyish voice, \"Dad, do you think I became fairer?\"The mirth in Qiao Zhen Jun\u2019s mouth corner deepened. It was the first time he knew that his daughter was so vain. However, his daughter did seem to be fairer: \"Fairer. Da Qiao is now a fair lady!\"This was a peculiar way of complimenting people here in the countryside. Unmarried girls who were fair were called fair lady. Those who were tanned were called tanned girl.This was the first time for Da Qiao to called a fair lady. Her big eyes were bright like stars in the sky and her cheeks were flushed with joy. A very pretty sight!She decided to wash her face with that water every day starting from today.She will always be a fair lady!Qiao Zhen Jun looked at little dumpling smiling until her eyes curved in the sun and discovered for the first time that she wasn't worst than Xiao Qiao in terms of looks.Compared with Xiao Qiao, her facial features were more beautiful. It seems once she grows up in the future, she will surpass Xiao Qiao.After a few days of rain, the weather became colder and colder. Xue Chuan's body was originally not in good shape. He fell ill once the weather changed.Qiao Xiu Zhi had to take care of her son and her old spouse. She was moving non-stop. Initially, she had planned to make clothes for Da Qiao, but she hadn't had time to do it until now.Wan Chun Ju came out of the room yawning. She saw her mother-in-law sitting in the yard making clothes. Her eyes lit up. She walked over and said, \"Mom, are these clothes made for the child in my stomach?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't even look at her. She\u00a0straightforwardly shattered her dreams: \"No. It's for Da Qiao.\"Da Qiao! Why was Da Qiao again!Hearing that it was for Da Qiao, Wan Chun Ju felt immediately uncomfortable.She gave birth to three children for Qiao Family. What's more, one was a boy. But her mother-in-law had never made clothes for her children.It didn't matter if the girls don't have any. After all, girls were worthless. They were raised to be another family's.But An Ping was the only grandson of Qiao Family. Old Second Qiao was disabled and will definitely not have a son. Old Third Qiao was out driving all day. After five years of marriage, he only gave birth to a girl. One look and one can tell there won't be many children.In other words, An Ping was probably the only hope of Qiao Family. Why didn't he get new clothes to wear, but the calamity star, Da Qiao did?The more Wan Chun Ju thought about it, the more agitated she felt.Qiao Xiu Zhi had her head lowered to sew the clothes. So she didn't noticing her expression. Even if she knew it, she wouldn't care.The cloth was hers. She can make it for whomever she wants. No one can control this!Wan Chun Ju saw that her mother-in-law ignored her. She wanted to grumble but didn't dare to. While not complaining made her feel extremely stifled: \"Mom, with so much cloth, you can't use it all. How about making one for An Ping for the New Year. He got no new clothes to wear!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi finally raised her head and looked at her. Her gaze was cool: \"Didn't you get a piece of cloth during the Mid-Autumn Festival? If you really feel dote your son, why don't you take it out and make it? Don't eye on my things!\"Wan Chun Ju choked to half-death by this. A breath was stuck in her chest. It couldn't get up or down. Made her retched to death!Once Qiao Zhen Guo returned from work, she immediately filed a complaint: \"Why is Mom getting more and more bad at differentiating family connection? An Ping is her grandson. Da Qiao is just a girl. How can she make one for a granddaughter while her grandson not have new clothes to wear?\"Qiao Zhen Guo looked at her strangely: \"Look at what you are saying. An Ping is Mom's biological grandchild. And Da Qiao isn't?\"Wan Chun Ju felt her man's brain got a hole. Why can't he understand such a simple logic?\"But An Ping is our son. What's more, our only son. The only grandson of Qiao Family!\"She deliberately emphasized the word \"only\". She said it so clearly now, he should understand, right?Qiao Zhen Guo looked at her like she was mental retarded: \"You only gave birth to one son. Of course, he's the only one. Although you haven't gone to school, you are so stupid that you can't do such simple counting! Back then, I told you to attned literacy class and you don't want to. Now you know it's shameful?\"\"!\"Was she discussing counting problems?She was talking about the problem of Qiao Family treasuring granddaughter rather than grandson!Wan Chun Ju almost couldn't breath. She was being choked to death by her own anger!While Wan Chun Ju was half-dead from getting angered by her own man, Fang Xiao Juan was suffering.It was December. The river was icy and chilly to the bones. With such a fall, she started to burn up that night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She only asked a barefoot doctor to check her.Unexpectedly, Fang Xiao Juan's fever worsened in the middle of the night.Xiao Qiao felt that something wasn't right and immediately ran to find her maternal uncle: \"Maternal Uncle, my mother has a terrible fever. She is talking nonsense. Have to send her to the hospital quickly!\"Fang Fu Gui was extremely upset about being awakened in the middle of the night: \"You think you can go to the hospital because you want to? Are treating the hospital as your home?\"Going to the hospital needed money, right?Going to the hospital needed a letter of introduction, right?Also, it was the middle of the night. What to do if he become paralyzed like old Second Qiao?Xiao Qiao was full of hate on the inside. Still, she had to beg him in a nice tone: \"Maternal Uncle, can't go to the hospital, then go to the health clinic. I know that I shouldn't interrupt my uncle's rest in the middle of the night. But I'm worried that if my mom burns to stupidity. Won't it be more troublesome to Maternal Uncle then?\"Fang Fu Gui became anxious then.If Fang Xiao Juan become retarded, she will definitely not be able to remarry then. Wouldn't he have to support her for a lifetime?This was definitely not possible!He jumped up from the bed and hurried to the health clinic with Fang Xiao Juan on his back.Because she went in time, Fang Xiao Juan was saved.Because Wang Xin Sheng had nothing to do all day, he liked to hang out with loafers nearby. His family worried that he would be led on the wrong path, so they sent him to his uncle's house in the county city. They made him live in the county for half a month before returning.As soon as he came back yesterday, he wanted to find Fang Xiao Juan. He hadn't seen the beauty for more than half a month, so he was really anxious.But before he went to find Fang Xiao Juan, he heard about her divorce with old Second Qiao. He was so excited that he almost fly. The next moment was extreme sadness following the extreme joy.Fang Xiao Juan had fell into the water and was rescued favus-riddled Gou Sheng. The two cuddled in public. He heard that Gou Sheng was looking for a matchmaker to go to Fang's house to ask for marriage!Wang Xin Sheng was so angry that he smashed the door with a punch!He already regarded Fang Xiao Juan as his own woman. But now she was taken advantage of by another man. How could he swallow this breath down?That night, he found two good buddies, ran to favus-riddled Gou Sheng's house, and covered his head. Then they took action and beaten him up!Gou Sheng was in the middle of dreaming of marrying a beauty and embarking on the pinnacle of his life when his body was suddenly in pain. He woke up from his dream and found that he was getting beaten by someone!He struggled frantically. However, the other party suppressed his hands and feet. He couldn't resist at all!In the end, he was beaten until black and blue. Because the movements were too loud, it startled the neighboring old woman Wang. Wang Xin Sheng was afraid of being caught, so he hurriedly left.Due to this, Gou Sheng was able to retain his life.Liu Cui Hua woke up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet. As soon as she walked out of the toilet, she heard a \"boom\" and a figure jumped in from the wall.She was so scared that her legs became soft: \"Who? Who is there?\"Wang Xin Sheng patted the dust on his hands and said, \"Eldest Sister-in-law, don't shout. It's me.\"When Liu Cui Hua heard her youngest brother-in-law's voice, her adrenaline-filled heart settled down: \"Fifth Brother, why are you coming back from outside at midnight instead of sleeping in your room?\"Wang Xin Sheng walked toward his room while yawning: \"Don't worry about this, Eldest Sister-in-law. If someone asks, say that you hadn't seen me.\"When Liu Cui Hua heard these words, her heart shook. Her youngest brother-in-law must have caused trouble outside again!She was actually very satisfied with marrying into Wang Family.Wang Family was generous. The parents-in-law were considered fair. Her man Wang Shui Sheng was hard-working and capable. There were few in this village who were more satisfied than her.Of course, it would be more satisfying if there wasn't the rat poo youngest brother-in-lawIn fact, she wanted her family to split off from a very early time. Unfortunately, her parents-in-law treasured youngest brother-in-law. As long as the two of them were present, they would definitely not be able to split off!When the cold wind blew, she shivered. She hurriedly went back to the room as she tightly clutched the cotton-padded jacket.The next day, everyone in the production team knew that Gou Sheng was beaten last night. If it wasn\u2019t for old woman Wang's early discovery, his body would have been cold by now!With such a big event occurring, the production team leader Wang Shui Sheng immediately gathered men over to Gou Sheng's home and asked him what happened last night.However, Gou Sheng was completely clueless.In fact, this can't be blamed on Gou Sheng.At that time, he sleeping quite soundly in the middle of the night. How could he expect someone to hit him?When old woman Wang brought people over, those people had already ran away without a trace.After listening, everyone lamented that Gou Sheng was unlucky.Although Gou Sheng was poor, lazy, had a wicked mouth, and liked to stir trouble, he would never easily form grudges with others .So who had a feud with Gou Sheng?Wang Shui Sheng asked Gou Sheng if he wanted to go to the police station to report the case. Gou Sheng shook his head like a rattle. He said that his legs goes weak when hearing the words \"police station\", let alone going over.Wang Shui Sheng can't do anything. The security of the production team had always been very good. Matter like Gou Sheng's had never happened before.If this matter was to spread, the advancement production team will definitely not be reviewed this year. If this kind of thing happens again, it seems the production team leader will also be removed!So he decided to spontaneously organize patrols with the production team before the spring sowing. Each household would send one person out to patrol in turn to protect everyone's safety.It was about everyone's safety, so there was no objection.When Liu Cui Hua learned about Gou Sheng getting beaten, she was restless.The time when Gou Sheng gotten beaten was too close to the time when youngest brother-in-law came back last night. Youngest brother-in-law probably committed this!It was just that she can't guess why youngest brother-in-law beat Gou Sheng. It stood to reason that the two people should have no grievances.But soon she knew the answer.After several days of cramming, Qiao Xiu Zhi finally finished making the clothes.Da Qiao held the new red cotton-padded jacket and asked her grandmother repeatedly in disbelief: \"Grandmother, is this, really, for me?\"It was a beautiful padded jacket with several pear flowers embroidered on it. It looked just like the real one. It was so beautiful!She had never seen such a nice padded jacket, let alone owned it!She had always picked up the clothes that her younger sister didn't want to wear. So when her grandmother gave her the quilted jacket now, her heart was full of uncertainty.Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at the little dumpling and said softly: \"It's for you. You can try it on.\"Da Qiao shook her head: \"Wear on, New, Year. Don't, dirty.\"She was reluctant to wear such beautiful clothes now. She will keep it until the New Year so that it won't get dirty.Qiao Xiu Zhi grinned: \"Go and change into it. Grandmother will make another one for you in a few days. You don't have to worry about getting it dirty.\"Da Qiao stared at her grandmother in a daze. Her big eyes blinked and she suddenly rushed to hug her grandmother's thigh: \"Grandmother, you're really good!\"No one had ever treated her so nicely. This was the first time someone had made her a new clothe. What's more, it was two pieces in one go!She announced that from now on her grandmother was her favorite person!When she grows up, she will make a lot of money to give her grandmother!Qiao Xiu Zhi rubbed her little head: \"Alright, go and put on new clothes to show Grandmother.\"Da Qiao quickly put on her new clothes.The clothes were made in larger sizes, so they don\u2019t fit very well. Still, the red color highlighted the small dumpling's red lips and white teeth. She looked like a Chinese lucky doll. Very pretty!Da Qiao had been washing her face and bathing in melted jade beads water during this period. Her skin had become more and more fair and delicate. It was just everyone was used to seeing her, they didn't realize.Putting on the new clothes at this moment, she suddenly realized that this little dumpling had turned out to be so beautiful at an unknown time!Da Qiao was a little nervous and pulled the corners of her clothes. She tilted her head and asked her grandmother: \"Grandmother, do, I, look good?\"After speaking, she specially twirled around. The vain little figure successfully made her grandmother amused.Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded and affirmatively spoke: \"Looks good. Just like lucky dolls on the New Year's picture. Beautiful and blessed!\"Da Qiao's eyes shone brighter. Her cheeks flushed with shyness and joy, like red apples. Simply too cute.She twisted around and meekly whispered: \"Grandmother, I want to, go out, and stroll.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi almost laughed. She didn't expect such a small dumpling to have vanity!She held back her laughter and nodded: \"Go then. But don't go to Fang's side, understand?\"Da Qiao nodded: \"Under, stood!\"Da Qiao went out in her new cotton-padded jacket. People in the village couldn't help being surprised when they met her. When did the little stutter, Da Qiao become so pretty?In everyone's impression, Da Qiao had always got a dull appearance. She was short. Her skin was sallow. She was forever wearing old clothes that didn't fit. Very inconspicuous.But now she was wearing a new red padded jacket. Skin was fair and got swarthy eyes like two black grapes. Against the backdrop of the red padded jacket, her red lips and white teeth stood out. Quite a sight.Everyone couldn't help but ask her: \"Da Qiao, where did your new clothes come from?\"Da Qiao revealed her little shell teeth and smiled sweetly: \"Grandmother made, this for, me.\"When she said this, her small chest puffed out. She looked very proud.It seem to be telling everyone that she have new clothes to wear and that she was loved by someone too!Everyone couldn't help but laugh when they saw her reaction. They all remarked that Qiao Xiu Zhi was very caring toward this granddaughter. It was so troublesome to make new clothes and embroider them!After walking around the village for a while, Da Qiao's vanity was greatly satisfied. When she reached the bend to her home, she saw someone walking towards her.This person wasn't someone else. It was...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At first she didn't recognize that it was Da Qiao.But when she approached and saw Da Qiao's face, she was stunned.Not only because Da Qiao wore a new clothe, but also because she turned fairer!Da Qiao\u2019s skin had always been yellow due to malnutrition. In addition to that. she did housework. Her skin was rougher than ordinary children. And she had chickenpox when she was three years old, so her face was left with a lot of acne marks.But now it was all gone!Her face was bare like it was a peeled boiled egg. White and tender. There were no flaws on it. Although it wasn't to the point where it was full of water, this level was definitely not what she should have!What the hell was going on?She only haven't seen her for seven or eight days, how could such a big change happen to her?An inexplicable panic rose in Xiao Qiao's heart.She felt that something was gradually getting out of her control!Da Qiao looked at her dazed younger sister. It was a little scary, she tentatively said: \"Younger sister?\"Xiao Qiao recovered her wits and pretended not to care: \"Sister, your skin has become a lot fairer. Did you use something?\"Da Qiao pursed her lips and whispered in a low voice, \"I didn't, use anything, to become, fairer.\"She intuitively didn't want to tell her younger sister about the koi jade pendant. Not to mention that she couldn't say it even if she wanted to.However, because she didn't tell her sister the truth, a trace of guilt surged in her heart. If she had a chance, she would secretly let Younger Sister use jade beads water in the future.Naturally become fairer?Think she was a fool?Xiao Qiao snorted in her heart. Her eyes spun and landed on her clothes: \"Sister, your clothes are so beautiful. Did Grandmother make them for you?\"Da Qiao touched the clothes on her body and smiled sweetly: \"En. Grandmother, made, it, for me. Younger Sister, pretty, right?\"\"As expected, Grandmother doesn't like me. She has never made clothes for me...sniff...\"As Xiao Qiao spoke, she started to cover her face and sob. However, her heart was filled with hate.That Qiao Xiu Zhi old witch. Back then, she had butter up her so much but had never excessively looked at her. Now she blindly taken a liking to stutter Da Qiao!Da Qiao panicked. She took her sister's hand to comfort her: \"Younger Sister, don't cry. Grandmother is, very nice. She will, like, you!\"Xiao Qiao put down her hand and said softly with red eyes: \"Sister, I have never worn such beautiful clothes. Can you give me the clothes?\"When Da Qiao heard this, her small face immediately scrunched up.Xiao Qiao raised her eyebrows, tilted her head, and asked: \"Sister, you're not willing?\"Da Qiao blinked her big eyes, bit her little lip, and said: \"Younger Sister, I can't, give you, the clothes. Grandmother, gave it, to me. I, love it.\"This was the new clothes Grandmother had made for her, so she didn't want to give it to anyone, including her younger sister.Xiao Qiao's voice immediately became sharp: \"Sister, you liar! You said you will always love me. So why won't you even give me a piece of clothing now?\"Da Qiao was startled by her and took two steps back: \"Younger Sister, you, don't be angry...\"Xiao Qiao's eyes fixedly looked at her: \"Well, I'm not angry. As long as you give me the new clothes you're wearing to me, I won't be angry with you!\"Unexpectedly, Da Qiao persisted this time: \"No, can't, give you!\"Xiao Qiao was furious!The former Da Qiao was stupid and foolish. She would do whatever she said. Very easy to\u00a0 cheat!Unexpectedly, not long after they separated, she began to know how to resist!This can't do. She will never allow Da Qiao to dig out her Five Finger Mountain!Just at this time, the two brothers Fang You Liang and Fang You Rou came over. Xiao Qiao's big eyes blinked and two lines of tears flowed down from her eyes.When Fang You Liang saw cousin Xiao Qiao was crying, he rushed over and agitatedly asked, \"Younger Sister Xiao Qiao, who bullied you? Tell Brother. Brother will help you get revenge!\"Fang You Rou parroted after him: \"Help you get revenge!\"Xiao Qiao looked at Da Qiao with red eyes: \"Sister she... she... waa...\"Fang You Liang understood at once. He turned around and glared at Da Qiao: \"Little stutterer, you bullied Younger Sister Xiao Qiao, right?\"Fang You Rou waved his small fist: \"Right?\"Da Qiao hurried to explain: \"I, didn't...\"Fang You Liang didn't listen to the explanation at all and pulled Da Qiao's collar angrily: \"You don't need to explain. It must be you! You're an ugly, black hearted, calamity. And actually dare to bully my Fang You Liang's younger sister. See if I won't beat you to death!\"Fang You Rou came forward and kicked Da Qiao: \"won't beat you to death!\"Although Fang You Rou was young, he can grew quite well. His strength wasn't small.Da Qiao's eyes reddened from the pain.She turned to look at her younger sister, hoping that she could explain to him. But her sister didn't look at her from start to finish. She kept sobbing while covering her face.At this moment, there was an indescribable disappointment and sadness in her heart.She didn\u2019t think she had done anything wrong. When her younger sister had new clothes, she never received any new clothes. Now she finally got new clothes, her younger sister wants to snatch it from her. If she can\u2019t snatch it, she let Cousin Brother beat her.Why did she do this?\"Fang Family's brat, stop!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi was a little worried after seeing that Da Qiao hadn't come back for so long, so she came out to look for her. Unexpectedly, something really happened!Fang You Liang looked up and saw Qiao Xiu Zhi\u00a0fiercely\u00a0rushing toward him. His legs were suddenly weak in fright.He immediately let go of Da Qiao's collar and turned around to run away. However, it was too late.Qiao Xiu Zhi rushed up, grabbed his collar, and picked him up like a little chick. She coldly spoke: \"I had warned you last time. Told you not to bully my granddaughter. It seems that you didn't take me seriously!\"Fang You Liang's face reddened as he struggled desperately: \"She was the one who bullied Younger Sister Xiao Qiao first. So I beat her. And I haven't beaten her yet? Let me go!\"Instead of letting go, Qiao Xiu Zhi raised him even higher: \"Bully? Then you say how she bullied your younger sister Xiao Qiao?\"Fang You Liang became speechless.He really didn't know how Da Qiao bullied Xiao Qiao. He saw Xiao Qiao crying when he came over. Without a second thought, he assumed Da Qiao bullied her.He turned his head and asked Xiao Qiao for help: \"Younger Sister Xiao Qiao, tell you how your grandmother how your sister bullied you!\"Xiao Qiao blinked with big eyes and said innocently, \"Brother, I didn't say that my sister bullied me!\"Fang You Liang was taken by surprise: \"No, didn't you just say...\"Xiao Qiao continued to look innocent and spoke: \"Brother, think back. I didn't say anything just now. It's Brother misunderstanding by yourself.\"Fang You Liang thought about it for a while. It really seemed to be the case. Xiao Qiao just cried at the time and didn't say anything. He had misunderstood.However!\"Since Da Qiao didn't bully you, why are you crying!\"Even though Fang You Liang liked this cousin sister, he was infuriated now.Xiao Qiao burst into tears again: \"I'm sorry, Brother. It's all my fault. I shouldn't be sad because Sister didn't lend me the new clothes to wear. And also caused you to misunderstand me. Grandmother, you forgive Brother. Brother didn't do it on purpose. He didn't do anything to Sister!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi sneered: \"Didn't do anything? If it weren't for my arrival, Da Qiao would have been beaten by now!\"Some people around saw Xiao Qiao crying pitifully and condemned Da Qiao, \"What's with you, Da Qiao? You're the elder sister. What's wrong with lending your clothes to your younger sister? It won't break!\"\"Isn't that right? Which sister doesn't alternately wear the clothes? As elder sister, you shouldn't be so stingy!\"Da Qiao's face flushed red and tears fell.Xiao Qiao felt pleased to see everyone standing on her side.Qiao Xiu Zhi's face became stern. Her gaze swept across the crowd with cold eyes: \"Dog bites mice and act so nosy. If you're so caring, why aren't you put your new clothes on Xiao Qiao!\"Everyone choked as their faces turned red and white.Someone continued to argue: \"Xiao Qiao isn't our family's child, so why do we dress her? She is Da Qiao's biological sister. The two are twins. So stingy, won't she have a bad reputation?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi gave a cold snort again: \"I made it very clear that day. Since then, Qiao family has nothing to do with Fang Family. Xiao Qiao voluntarily stay with Fang Family, so naturally she has nothing to do with Qiao Family. What's more...\"Reaching here, she turned her gaze to Xiao Qiao: \"Fang Xiao Juan has made many new clothes for Xiao Qiao over the years. But I have never seen her let Da Qiao wear. Da Qiao always wears her\u00a0 old unwanted clothes. With this kind of sister, why should she let her wear her new clothes?\"Everyone recalled that Da Qiao used to pick up Xiao Qiao's leftover clothes to wear then The gaze toward Xiao Qiao instantly changed.\"Xiao Qiao, since you didn't let your sister wear the new clothes, you can't ask for your sister's new clothes now!\"\"That's right. Da Qiao has only obtained such a new clothes after so many years. Wanting to borrow it as soon as you come. Isn't this too greedy?\"\"Verbally, it's borrowed. Who knows if it will be returned after lending it. After all, Fang Family and Qiao Family are now two families!\"Xiao Qiao gritted her silver teeth with hatred!This old Qiao Xiu Zhi witch was really her natural nemesis. Every time she encountered her, nothing good happened!However, she reacted quickly and spoke with a guilty expression: \"I'm sorry, everyone. I'm sorry, Sister. I'm sorry, Grandmother. I was wrong. I find the embroidery on the padded jacket so beautiful and can't help but want to borrow it from Sister to wear for two days. I know I'm wrong. Sister, can you forgive me?\"Da Qiao's eyes widened. Looking straight at her younger sister, her eyes flashedwith anger.Younger Sister lied. What she said just now was give, not borrow!But before she could speak, old woman Fang rushed over.Although Mrs. Fang was provoked, what Qiao Xiu Zhi held in her hand was their Fang Family's golden egg: \"Qiao Xiu Zhi, let go of my grandson! Otherwise, I fight with you without end!\"Without end?She didn't intend to make the matter big. But now it seems that if they don't teach them a lesson today, they won't know how to be afraid.She turned to look at Eldest Daughter-in-law, who was watching the drama: \"Eldest's wife, go get some chicken poo!\"Wan Chun Ju paused a bit and soon recovered. Her expression displayed excitement. Her voice screamed to the sky: \"As you command! Mom, wait for me, I'll be back soon!\"Everyone: \"...\"Wan Chun Ju turned and flew like the wind and wild like a horse. Almost left behind afterimages.Everyone: \"...\"Wan Chun Ju was extremely excited!She felt this was the best time for her to show her loyalty to her mother-in-law. She must not let her mother-in-law down!Mom, wait for me. I will be back soon!Qiao Zhen Guo headed home from work. When he walked halfway, he suddenly saw a figure running past him like a wind. He didn't react until the other party ran far away. Just now, the person seemed a bit like his wife.But soon he shook his head again. It couldn't be his wife. His wife was pregnant. She would have a miscarriage if she ran like this!Wan Chun Ju didn't remember her \"pregnancy\" at all. She ran like the definition of speed and freedom. Like a \"crazy\" woman.She returned home to grabbed the chicken pot, then grabbed the chicken poop, and poured it into the pot. This amount of chicken poop was definitely not enough. So she speeded to the houses of her acquaintances to grab more. Defining the complete revolutionary spirit of not being afraid of being tired or dirty.When old woman Fang saw that Qiao Xiu Zhi really meant it, she immediately persuaded: \"Xiu Zhi, we used to be in-laws. It doesn't matter who is right or wrong in this matter today, just drop it, okay?\"\"No!\" Qiao Xiu Zhi refused, \"I must teach your Fang Family a lesson today!\"At this, old woman Fang immediately became infuriated.Qiao Family was simply an overbearing bully. They divorced her daughter without paying a penny. Now they want to beat her precious grandson. How can they swallow this!Old woman Fang spat on the ground before rushing up to grab Qiao Xiu Zhi's hair.Qiao Xiu Zhi's gaze was cold. She grabbed her hair, threw her to the ground with a backhand slap, and stepped on her face with one foot. Fiercely suppressed her!KO!This fight was over before it started!Old woman Fang's face turned red and white. Voice overfilled with hate: \"Qiao Xiu Zhi, you overbearing bully. When fighting, one don't hit face. Take your feet away, otherwise it'll be an unending fight!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi condescendingly responded: \"How will it unending?\"After speaking, she pressed her feet down with more strength. Old woman Fang instantly screamed like a pig.Some people watched Xiao Qiao standing by the side watching the drama like it had nothing to do with her. They couldn't stand it anymore: \"Xiao Qiao, this happened because of you. You just watched your cousin and grandma get beaten?\"Upon hearing this, Xiao Qiao cursed that person eighteenth generation of ancestor in her heart. She reluctantly stepped forward to help old woman Fang beg for mercy.Unexpectedly, old woman Fang went crazy. She kicked her legs and happened hit Xiao Qiao who stepped forwrd.Her step became unstable and she fell to the ground with a \"bang\". Her face hit the ground first!Xiao Qiao felt a fierce pain around her nose and mouth area. She raised her head. She had took a mouthful of mud and two lines of nosebleeds dripped under her nose.She spat out a bloody saliva with a \"pah\". Along with the saliva, there were two more teeth.Seeing the two bloody teeth, Xiao Qiao finally couldn't help but cried out with a \"WA\".F***, what bloody luck was this?She transmigrated into a novel and became a retard for more than ten years in her previous life. Now her transmigrated life restarted and still so unlucky?Shouldn't transmigration and rebirth the standard feature for female lead?Since she was the female lead, why did she have to go through these damn things?Xiao Qiao felt so wronged in her heart. She felt that she was the worst novel transmigrated female lead. No one else!Da Qiao has always loved this sister Xiao Qiao and couldn't bear to let her to get hurt.But this time, seeing her fall and end up bloody, she didn't go forward.Just stood aside and looked at her from a distance.At this moment, Wan Chun Ju's excited voice sounded from far away: \"Mom, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. The chicken poo is here!\"Everyone: \"...\"In the end, this fight ended with Qiao Xiu Zhi smearing chicken poo on Fang's family members' face. Old woman Fang was stuffed with chicken poo in her mouth.Because Qiao Xiu Zhi felt that the upper beam was crooked because the lower beam was crooked. Since each and every one of Fang Family can grew up like this, old woman Fang had a great responsibility. So old woman Fang must eat chicken poo once as a lesson!Qiao Family won the fight this time. On the way back, Wan Chun Ju was quite upbeat: \"Mom, did I perform well?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at her. She nodded: \"En, not bad.\"Wan Chun Ju immediately became overjoyed. She married into Qiao Family for more than ten years. This was the first time she had been praised by her mother-in-law. Next time, she must collect chicken poo faster!She made a fist!Unexpectedly, the next moment she heard her mother-in-law ask her: \"I saw you run so fast just now. Is your baby okay?\"At once, Wan Chun Ju was struck by lightning. Her whole person slowly cracked: \"...\"She forgot about \"pregnancy\"!She was so careless!She squeezed out a smile: \"Hehe, don't worry, Mom. The baby is very strong. There is nothing wrong at all!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi eyed at her stomach suspiciously. This stare made Wan Chun Ju's legs go soft. She almost fell to the ground.She suddenly felt that it was a terrible move to pretend to be pregnant. But now it seemed too late to regret it....Madam Fang felt that her old face was completely wiped gone!She kept spitting the whole way. However, the chicken poo taste still remained.Some mischievous children followed them all the way back to Fang's house. They laughed as they followed, \"Open your mouth when you eat poo. Squat your legs when you poo. When old woman Fang squats, she eats a mouthful of chicken poo!\"\"Scram off! See if I won't kill you little beasts if you don't scram!\" Old woman Fang was so furious that she almost fell down. She picked up the broom to drive away these little ghosts.The child laughed as they disappeared.The more she thought about it, the more angry she became. She rushed into Fang Xiao Juan's room and slapped her twice without notice!Fang Xiao Juan was dazed from the beating: \"Mom, what are you doing?\"\"You calamity star. Fang Family has been unlucky since you came home. Take your daughter and scram immediately!\"Fang Xiao Juan hadn't fully recovered from her cold yet. She didn\u2019t have much strength. She was dragged by her mom and rolled off the bed. \"You want me to leave immediately? Fine! Return the fifty yuan I gave you last time. Return it and I'll immediately leave.\"Old woman Fang immediately stopped talking. She dropped her hand and turned away with a cold snort.Xiao Qiao walked in from the outside with blood and chicken poo on her face.When Fang Xiao Juan saw her look like this, she paid no heed to the pain in her body. She agitatedly asked, \"Jiao Jiao'er, what's happened to you?\"Xiao Qiao cried as she recounted the event again. Of course, in her statement, Da Qiao became the unreasonable one.Afterward, Fang Xiao Juan let out a torrent of curses. She fetched water to wash Xiao Qiao's face as she cursed.\"Mom, when can we move out? I don't want to live in grandma's house anymore. Grandma scolds you every day. I feel distressed.\"Although Xiao Qiao had lost two teeth, it wasn't a big problem. She hadn't replaced her baby teeth yet.Still, she kept this hatred in mind.Fang Xiao Juan's eyes soured. She almost shed tears.After this time, she knew that Jiao Jiao'er was the only one in the family who cared about her life and death. As for her eldest brother and mom, they were all bastards who won't dispatch eagles unless they see a rabbit!She hugged her daughter in distressed and spoke, \"Don't worry. Mom will go to see your Uncle Wang tonight and let your Uncle Wang marry Mom as soon as possible. Then we won't have to stay here anymore!\"Xiao Qiao's frowned brows smoothed out a little when she heard this response.After being unlucky for so long, there was finally good news.That night, Fang Xiao Juan took advantage of the darkness to sneak out of Fang's house. She came to an unoccupied hut in the east of the village.As soon as she entered, she was hugged by Wang Xin Sheng: \"Oh, what are you doing? Let go of me. It won't be good if someone sees!\"Wang Xin Sheng laughed inwardly. He felt that this woman was such an actress. She ran over to have a private meeting with him in the middle of the night. Who was she putting this chaste woman fa\u00e7ade for?Seeing Fang Xiao Juan struggling hard, he suddenly became angry and pushed her away: \"Since you are afraid of being seen, what are you doing here?\"Fang Xiao Juan was caught off guard by his push and almost ran into the table behind her. Her face instantly became ugly: \"Are you trying to push me to death? Pah, there's no such good men!\"He had said say pleasing words before. In the end, it was just wanting to take advantage of her. Look, if she don\u2019t let him touch her, he immediately flip his face!Wang Xin Sheng looked at her with the help of the moonlight coming in through the window. The corners of his mouth slanted: \"I say, Fang Xiao Juan, do you know how good I am to you these days. But every time I touch you, you put on the face of a chaste woman. I thought you were more reserved before, but now I know that you are just a slut!\"These words were ugly.Fang Xiao Juan became angry at once. She pointed to his nose and cursed: \"Wang Xin Sheng, what are you talking about? How am I promiscuous? If you don't make it clear today, I won't be done with you!\"\"Favus-riddled Gou Sheng!\" Wang Xin Sheng's tone was sour and smelly, \"I heard that you fell into the river and he was the hero who came to save the beauty. You two cuddled together in public's eyes. You're already going to marry Gou Sheng and still secretly come to meet with me. Isn't this promiscuous?\"Fang Xiao Juan trembled with fury: \"What nonsense are you talking about? When am I going to marry a trash man like Gou Sheng?\"She won't marry a man like Gou Sheng even if she poked her own eyes!When Wang Xin Sheng heard her saying that Gou Sheng was trash, his expression improved. He walked over and pinched her chin: \"What about me? Do you want to marry me?\"Fang Xiao Juan pushed him a bit and said angrily: \"Don't you know in your heart if I want to marry you?\"Wang Xin Sheng grabbed her hand and put it to his mouth to nimble: \"Putting it this way, I really want to marry you back. But my parents will definitely not agree!\"When Fang Xiao Juan heard this, she suddenly became displeased: \"Is there any part of me, Fang Xiao Juan that can't be seen and make your parents dislike me?\"Wang Xin Sheng sneered: \"You are divorced. Just that only, my mom won't let you in! But if you are pregnant with our Wang Family's child, my mom may budge for the sake of the child.\"As he spoke, his hands went in under her clothes.Fang Xiao Juan originally didn't want to have any real relationship with Wang Xin Sheng before marriage. But at the thought of her mom's attitude these days, she really have no choice. She must marry into Wang Family as quickly as possible.Thinking of this, she half-pushed and half-consented and let Wang Xin Sheng \"mess around\"....After the fight, Da Qiao was still a little sad even though her grandmother and her dad didn't blame her.She was completely listless for a few days.But soon she had no time be entangled, because Gu Gu drank the melted jade beads water by mistake!Before, she poured water on the pear tree and the rose. The pear tree and the rose bloomed one after another, so she planned to sneakily pour the water to the vegetable garden to see if it worked.Just when she was about to go out, she heard her dad calling her. So she just put the tub on the ground.When she came out, she saw Gu Gu lying on the edge of the tub and drinking the water in the tub!She was scared silly on the spot and immediately ran over to take Gu Gu out: \"Gu Gu, you, are naughty. This water, can't, be drink!\"\"Gu Gu!\" The old hen responded to her.Da Qiao stared at Gu Gu blankly, worried that she might feel sick in the next moment.Wan Chun Ju walked in and encountered this scene. She couldn't help but curiously asked: \"Why are you holding the old hen?\"Da Qiao couldn't say anything. She couldn't explain what happened to the old hen.The old hen saw Wan Chun Ju. It seem that she recognized her as she immediately struggled to get out of Da Qiao's arms. This scared Wan Chun Ju back two steps.Unexpectedly, the old hen didn't chase her. Just stared at her and then trembled all over.Wan Chun Ju took in the old hen's behavior and screamed, \"What is wrong about it? Is it going to have chicken disease?\"Da Qiao thought it was linked to drinking water. She was consumed with sadness. Just when she was about to run over, she saw the old hen trembling all over. Then the chicken legs squatted and laid four eggs in a row with a \"dangdangdangdang\".Wan Chun Ju: \"!\"Da Qiao:\"!\"After being shocked, Da Qiao quickly recovered her senses. She ran over and happily cried, \"Gu Gu, you, laid eggs!\"The old hen held her head up, with a proud look: \"Gu Gu.\"Wan Chun Ju stared at the old hen in a daze. Her mind opened up.The old hen laid eggs after seeing her. What did this mean?That meant she was blessed!It showed that she was more useful than a rooster. The hen laid eggs as soon as she saw her!Oh, she, Wan Chun Ju, was going to get rich!If the hens of the entire production team lay eggs when they see her, she will have nothing to worry about for the rest of life just by relying on this skill alone!In order to verify her idea, she walked towards the old hen.At this moment, the old hen looked at her. It shook all over again before laying two eggs again!It was a success!She really was the mother of the hen!All the hens lay their eggs as soon as they see her. She was about to get rich!\"Zhen Guo, Zhen Guo! Our family is about to get rich!\" Wan Chun Ju ran out excitedly. Shouting as she ran.Da Qiao:?After a while, Wan Chun Ju came back. But this time Qiao Zhen Guo was with her.Wan Chun Ju looked excited: \"Zhen Guo, look. As soon as I stand in front of the hen, it will lay eggs immediately!\"Qiao Zhen Guo looked at her like she a retard: \"Wife, you are sick. I have to take you to the hospital for an examination when I am free!\"Wan Chun Ju was in a good mood now. She didn't bother to mind her man's words.She smiled triumphantly: \"You wait and see!\"She excitedly stood in front of the old hen and expectantly watched at the old hen.The old hen looked up at her. They stared at each other.One minute passed.Nothing happened.Two minutes passed.Still nothing happened.Wan Chun Ju couldn't help but become anxious: \"Sister, lay eggs!\"Da Qiao:\"\u2026\u2026\"Qiao Zhen Guo: \"...\"The old hen was as stable as Mount Tai. Expressing that she can't lay eggs when she can't.Wan Chun Ju was so anxious that she was about to sweat. She bent down and wanted to touch the old hen's butt.The old hen instantly felt insulted. It screeched twice, stirring her wings to soar into the sky, and pecked on Wan Chun Ju's mouth!\"Ouch...\" Wan Chun Ju cried out in pain.She licked her lips subconsciously. F***, It was bleeding!This damn old hen. A bit too fierce?But without waiting for her to complain, the old hen fluttered her wings and started a new round of RUN FOR YOUR LIFE CHASE!\"Ahhhhh... Zhen Guo, save me...\"Same old taste, same old formula.Qiao Zhen Guo laughed like a dog again: \"Wife, I won't participate you sisters' matter. Your relationship is so good. Just properly communicate with your sister on your own. I'm going to work.\"After that, he really left.Wan Chun Ju was so angry that she almost spewed a mouthful of old blood!On this day, Wan Chun Ju was chased by old hen for an entire hour. When she returned to Qiao's old house, her legs were trembling.Under normal circumstances, a hen normally lays one or two eggs a day. Mostly was one egg. However, the old hen laid six eggs in a day!This was something that had never happened before!Da Qiao guessed that it had something to do with Gu Gu drink the water with the jade beads. Gu Gu laid eggs after drinking that water. This show that it beneficial to the body.She wanted to try what effect this water can have on people's bodies.After Eldest Aunt left, Da Qiao drank the first cup of water with melted jade beads.Qili Village finally got its first snow this winter. The weather was getting colder and colder.With the approach of the new year, the villagers of Qili Village finally waited for the arrival of their most anticipated day of each year... Pork division.According to the custom of Qili Village, the pigs slaughter must be done before dawn, otherwise it wasn't auspicious.So on the day of pork division, the whole village got up before dawn. They put on cotton jackets and cotton caps, and jollily headed toward the threshing yard.Da Qiao went with her grandmother.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She also wore a red cotton cap. Her whole body was red and plump. From a distance, it looked like a little red meat ball. Quite a cute sight.She held her grandmother's hand and said in baby voice: \"Grandmother, after the pork, is divided, can we make, pork dumplings?\"She especially liked to eat dumplings. Pork dumplings in particular. She ate two of them during the New Year last year. The flavor was so fragrant that she almost swallowed her tongue.Just thinking about it now, she couldn't help but want to drool.Qiao Xiu Zhi suddenly looked down at her when she heard these words. A flash of surprise flicked in her eyes.Da Qiao thought that her request was too much. She pulled a corner of her clothes with a small hand and whispered nervously: \"It's alright if you don't do it. Actually, I don't really want to eat, Grandmother. Don't be, angry with me. \"Qiao Xiu Zhi wasn't angry at her at all. She was surprised that Da Qiao's stutter seemed to improve.Da Qiao's stuttering was natural and was a bit serious. She discussed with Xue Chuan and planned to take her to the hospital for an examination after the New Year. Unexpectedly. she showed signs of improvement!This was really unexpected!\"Grandmother isn't angry with you. Grandmother was thinking how many dumplings to make to feed your little belly just now.\"However, she didn't point it out. She was worried that once she mention it, the child would instantly become nervous.The child's mind was a little sensitive. It made people feel distressed when she speak so cautiously.Da Qiao heaved a sigh of relief when she heard this.There was indeed no sense of security in her heart. She was always worried that if she didn't do things well, her grandmother and grandfather will not care for her.She revealed her little shell teeth and smiled a little shyly: \"I only eat five. That's enough.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi raised her eyebrows: \"Five? Is it enough to pick your teeth?\"Dumpling Da Qiao pursed her lips and thought about it seriously. Then she stretched out two short fingers and declared: \"Then add two more.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi couldn't help but laugh: \"You can eat as much as you want!\"Da Qiao looked at her milk. Her eyes curved into crescents and smiled as if she had the most precious treasure in the world.The threshing yard wasn't far away. It took about ten minutes walk.When Da Qiao and her grandmother arrived, many people were already standing in the threshing yard.Everyone was shivering. Their faces flushed from the cold wind. Still, their faces was covered with joy. Their speeches were a little more gentle than usual.According to the tasks assigned by the community, each production team must raise at least two pigs. Qili Village had raised a total of six pigs this year.The point was that all six pigs nurtured alive!In addition to handing in three task pigs to the country, the remaining three pigs belong to the production team. Today, the three big fat pigs will be slaughtered and the pork will be distributed to the villagers according to headcount.At this time, the three big fat pigs had been killed and cleaned up. They were all placed on the stone slab.The villagers have been looking forward to this day for a year. All of them had their eyes on the pork on the stone slab. Their eyes shone green.The production team leader, Wang Shui Sheng stood on a big rock with the roster and shouted loudly: \"Don't rush. Don't grab. Everyone has a share! I know everyone has been waiting for this day for a long time, so I won't talk nonsense. The pork division begins!\"Everyone was very satisfied with the production team leader's \"awareness of current affairs\". Dividing the pork was dividing the pork. Don't pull in some nonsense.\"Old Fourth Cai, sixteen jins of pork!\"\"Received!\"\"Wang Lao Gen, twenty jins of pork!\"\"Okay!\"\"Lin You Shui, ...\"The roll call and pork collection were carried out in an orderly manner. No one quarreled.Although Wang Shui Sheng wasn't a charismatic leader, he had done a fair and just job of dividing the pork.All pork was fat and lean were paired up. No matter who, they can get fat. This way, no one would fight or snatch.When it was Fang Family's turn, old woman Fang was very proud. She held sixteen jins of pork with her head up and her chest puffed like a victorious rooster: \"Oh, so much pork. I'm really afraid that we won't be able to finish it!\"Some people can't help but curl their lips. What fart. It was just sixteen jins of pork. How can they not finish eating!This time there were three pigs in total. Each head was allocated two jins of pork. So each household received a lot of pork. Fang Family's sixteen jins of pork was neither too much or too little.She showed off because her family had two more people than the previous years. In other words, four jins extra of pork!Old woman Fang felt that her family had taken a big advantage. Her daughter and granddaughter had only returned home less than a month. They brought fifty yuan. Now there were four jins of pork. They had taken over Qiao Family's benefit!Mother Fang was fed a mouthful of chicken poo that day. She didn't dare to find Qiao Xiu Zhi and repay it back. But that didn't mean she didn't hold grudges. On the contrary, she remembered the grudges firmly.So even when it was little benefit now, she had to sing it out for everyone to hear. It was best that it could piss off that old witch, Qiao Xiu Zhi!Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't give old woman Fang a glance at all.There were ten people in the Qiao's old house. They got 20 jins of pork. With the addition of the Qiao's small house, Qiao Family got a total of 24 catties of pork. This number completely crushed Fang Family!Soon it will be Qiao's turn. She lowered her head and told Da Qiao: \"Grandmother is going over to get the pork. Wait here obediently. Don't run around, understand?\"Dumpling Da Qiao obediently nodded: \"I'm very good. Grandmother, don't need to worry.\"After Qiao Xiu Zhi left, Da Qiao stood obediently in the corner as she waited quietly for her grandmother to come back. Unbeknownst to her, someone had already been eyeing her.Fang Xiao Juan stared at Da Qiao viciously. She wished to step forward and slap the calamity to death!In less than a month, she and Xiao Qiao fell down one after another. Fell until their teeth flew off. All of this was due to that calamity Da Qiao. Their bad luck was related to this calamity!Her gaze fell on the red cotton-padded jacket on Da Qiao's body. Flames almost bursting out of her eyes!Jiao Jiao can't wear such good clothes. Why can this catastrophe wear such good clothes?Also, Jiao Jiao'er got smeared on the face with chicken poo by old witch Qiao Xiu Zhi. Wasn't it due to this calamity not willing to give her clothes to Jiao Jiao'er?Fang Xiao Juan looked up and noticed Qiao Xiu Zhi won't be back in a short while. She immediately rushed up, poked her finger on Da Qiao's face, and cursed: \"You black-hearted thing, take off your clothes and give it to me immediately!\"Da Qiao was startled by her mom. Her small body took two steps back before she could stabilize herself.She pinched her eyebrows and looked up at her mom. With a pursed small mouth, she gathered up the courage to refuse and uttered, \"No!\"Fang Xiao Juan was stunned.She didn't expect that this little stutter would actually rebel against her!After she recovered her senses, she instantly became furious from embarrassment: \"You are a white-eyed wolf. I gave birth to you and raise you for so many years. Back then, I bleed a lot to give birth to you. And this is how you repay me?\"\"I knew that day, I would have strangled you, so that you won't piss me off now! I order you to take off your clothes immediately and give it to me!\"In the past, no matter how bad Fang Xiao Juan treated her, Da Qiao had always maintained a sincere heart towards her mom. Hoping that one day her mom would like her and dote her like Xiao Qiao.But after drinking the melted jade bead water these days, her confused and ignorant mind seemed to pushed through the clouds and instantly became clear.Many things that she didn't understand before gradually made sense.If she had encountered this situation before, she would be sad and lost. But now, a new thought that she had never had before popped into her mind: she felt that her mom wasn't a good mom. A good mom would not treat her own child like this!So she didn't want to give her the clothes. She don't want to follow her instructions!Da Qiao's palm-sized face was flushed. She looked at her mom with clear eyes and firmly refused again: \"No! You are a bad mom! I don't want to, give you the clothes!\"Fang Xiao Juan was stunned again!Not only did the calamity know how to resist, but also because she spoke clearly and her stutter had improved!What was going on?When she was stunned, Da Qiao twisted her body and ran out from under her arm.Fang Xiao Juan recovered and jumped in anger: \"You white-eyed wolf. Stop. Curse to all relative, and see if I won't beat you to death!\"Someone couldn't stand Fang Xiao Juan bullying a child like this, so they persuaded: \"Xiao Juan, you're an adult. Why must you make it difficult for a child all day?\"Fang Xiao Juan spat toward the other party's face: \"Who needs you to be nosy! It's my own child. I can hit whatever I want!\"That person instantly became very angry: \"I, pah. When Auntie Qiao comes back, I want to see if you dare to be so arrogant!\"Fang Xiao Juan subconsciously shuddered when she heard the name of her former mother-in-law.But at this moment, she wasn't very afraid of Qiao Xiu Zhi. Since she slept with Wang Xin Sheng, she mentally rounded up and considered herself as a member of Wang Family.Wang Xin Sheng's eldest brother was the production team leader. After she marries into Wang Family, she will get Wang Shui Sheng to give all of the dirtiest, tiring and least profitable work to Qiao Family!She wanted Qiao Family's members to kneel in front of her and beg her. Then she would slam their faces under her feet!So she didn't stop chasing Da Qiao because of the other party's words. Instead she became more ferocious.When Da Qiao was about to be caught, a heart-piercing shrill came closer and closer at this moment: \"Help! A wild boar is chasing me! Help!\"Everyone was halted.Wild boar?Many older villagers in Qili Village had seen wild boars, but that happened many years ago.Because wild boars were extremely harmful to crops and ordinary people, troops were sent to the mountains to terminate wild boars a few years ago. Due to this, no one had seen wild boars in recent years.During the time everyone was frozen, Fang Fu Gui screamed and ran over to this side: \"HELP! HELP!\"Old woman Fang was feeling proud about gaining four jins of pork a moment ago. Now her face paled in fright when she saw her precious son being chased by the wild boar.Everyone saw the huge wild boar chasing Fang Fu Gui as they dashed over. At once, it became a mess. They scattered and fled.Seeing that everyone was running away, old woman Fang anxiously jumped, grabbed a man who ran past her, and pleaded, \"Young lad, pretty please. I beg you to save my family Fu Gui!\"Save?Got to be joking. That was a wild boar!Did she think he didn't want to live?The man looked at her like an idiot, pulled her hand away, and ran away.\"Aiya, Heaven didn't open their eyes. My son! Mom will come to save you!\"Old woman Fang wanted to save her son, but she was too helpless. As soon as she finished speaking, her legs softened and she fell on the ground. She couldn't get up!The power of maternal love failed.\"Ahh...\" Fang Fu Gui let out a tragic scream.When everyone looked over, they saw a wild boar arching its nose into Fang Fu Gui's butt. Fang Fu Gui screamed. Then he flipped over and fell to the ground.Fang Fu Gui's leg seemed to be broken. He couldn't get up despite his several attempts.Just when everyone thought he was dead, the wild boar suddenly stopped attacking him. It turned its head and rushed toward Fang Xiao Juan who was teaching Da Qiao a lesson.Fang Xiao Juan's eyes widened.Fang Xiao Juan trembled all over.Fang Xiao Juan pushed Da Qiao out without even thinking about it!Then she turned around and her hoof flew like a wild wind.Da Qiao was pushed to the ground.Everyone screamed!Someone anxiously yelled: \"Da Qiao, get up! Get up and run!\"\"Unlucky child, to encounter such a mother is really bad luck of eight lifetimes!\"\"Pitiful\u2026\u2026\"Da Qiao seemed to be frightened as she was sitting motionless on the ground.Just as the wild boar was about to reach Da Qiao, a strange matter happened again!They witnessed the wild boar run directly pass Da Qiao. Its target was locked on Fang Xiao Juan alone!\"Ahhhhh...\"Fang Xiao Juan was completely scared when she heard the hot pursuit behind her.Suddenly her leg stepped on a raised rock and she fell down with a \"bang\" like the way Xiao Qiao did before!An iron taste spread in her mouth. But she couldn't pay heed to the pain. She crawled up to continue running away.However, the wild boar caught up. It pushed down its front hooves and snarled at her.Fang Xiao Juan saw the wild boar approach closer. Her legs weakened as she sat on the ground. The wild boar roared again and she immediately laid flat on the ground.Dead! She was dead!Fang Xiao Juan's teeth clattered. Her trouser became hot and a puff of yellow urine came out.Just when everyone thought Fang Xiao Juan was dead. Another strange occurrence happened again!The wild boar went to Fang Xiao Juan's head and lifted a hind leg like a male dog peeing.Fang Xiao Juan's eyes widened. What did it want to do?It can't be that it want to stamp her to death with a hoof?\"Ahhhhh...\" Fang Xiao Juan screamed frantically!At this moment, a column of pale yellow liquid with a nasty smell was sprayed from the wild boar. It sprayed on Fang Xiao Juan's face and mouth!Everyone: \"...\"...Everyone's eyes dropped to the ground!They seemed to see a wild boar pee on Fang Xiao Juan's face just now. They weren't dreaming, right?Fang Xiao Juan was about to become crazy!No, she already went crazy!She wanted to scream, but as soon as she open her mouth, the urine wildly gushed into her throat!Ahhhh, embarrassing to death!It was better to have the wild boar nose-butt her to death!Wang Xin Sheng's arrival came late.When he arrived at the threshing yard, he happened to see the wild boar pee on Fang Xiao Juan's face. He cracked on the spot.He paused for a moment before he turned around and retched.After he slept with Fang Xiao Juan, he learned from others that Fang Xiao Juan was stuffed with chicken poo by Lin Family. At that time, he felt quite disgusted.However, he already slept with her. Fang Xiao Juan was a beauty after all. He didn't take this matter to heart after he minding for a moment.But now he personally saw the wild boar pee on her face, he couldn't endure it!At this moment, he dismissed the idea of marrying Fang Xiao Juan.Marry a woman who had been fed chicken poo and drunk pig urine? Do he still want face?Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't expect that so many things to happen during her short absence.She ran back against the traffic flow. When she saw the wild boar running towards Da Qiao, her heart stopped beating for an instant.If little dumpling was injured because of her negligence, she would never forgive herself in this life.Fortunately, the wild boar didn't attack her. Instead it bypassed her and chased Fang Xiao Juan.She breathed a sigh of relief. She had never been so scared like this moment in her life.She walked toward Da Qiao and held the scared little dumpling in her arms. She softly coaxed: \"Da Qiao, don't be afraid. Grandmother is back. Gradnmother won't let anyone hurt you.\"Da Qiao was truly terrified!When her mom pushed her towards the wild boar, she was so sad. And so frightened that her whole body trembled.She didn't understand why her mom hated her so much. Hated her so much that she want her to die!She had always been well-behaved. More obedient than Xiao Qiao. Why did she hate her so much?Qiao Xiu Zhi looked the trembling little dumpling in her arms and was filled with deep hatred. If Fang Xiao Juan was in front of her at this time, she would send her to death with one slap!She pinched Da Qiao's nose. Then her ears. She whispered: \"Come back soul. Da Qiao's soul, come back!\"Da Qiao slowly recovered her wits. She stared at her grandmother in a daze. Then cried out with a \"waaa\": \"Grandmother!\"\"Grandmother is here. Be good. Don't be afraid!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi soothed the little dumpling in her arms and waited for her to calm down before handing her over to her tardy eldest son.In order to earn a few more work points during this period, Qiao Zhen Guo went to build a reservoir every day. It was quite tiresome. So Qiao Xiu Zhi told him not to get up so early for pork division.Halfway on the road, Qiao Zhen Guo heard the news that a wild boar was chasing people. He filled with worry and almost rushed all the way: \"Mom, are you okay?\"\"I'm fine.\" Qiao Xiu Zhi stuffed Da Qiao into his arms and ordered: \"Hold her well. Don't drop the child!\"Qiao Zhen Guo firmly carried Da Qiao: \"Mom, don't worry. Even if I fall, I won't let my eldest niece fall!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi was satisfied. She turned and walked toward the wild boar.Seeing Qiao Xiu Zhi heading toward the wild boar, everyone began to talk.What was she trying to do?Someone remembered that Qiao Xiu Zhi once killed more than two hundred jins of wild boar with one punch. Could it be...Everyone held their breath and their eyes didn't blink.The wild boar watched Qiao Xiu Zhi running towards it and wildly roared.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't shrink from this. She ran up and slammed the wild boar's head with a fist.The wild boar let out a miserable squeal.The next moment there was only a \"bang\" sound. The wild boar crashed to the ground.Afterward, it had fainted to death!Everyone: \"!\"Simply frightening!Simply incredible!That wild boar weighed at least two to three hundred jins. Qiao Xiu Zhi had knocked it out with just one punch!If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they would definitely not believe such a thing!When the wild boar came, Wang Shui Sheng gathered some people to raid this guy. When he came with a group of young men, he happened to witness the scene of Qiao Xiu Zhi punching the wild boar to death. Immediately, he was stunned.Innate super strength. It turned out that it wasn't a joke!\"Blech!\"As soon as the wild boar crisis was resolved, Fang Xiao Juan immediately got up from the ground and vomited.\"Xiao Juan, what does the wild boar's urine taste like? Vile?\"\"Compared with chicken poo, which one is more fragrant?\"\"Xiao Juan, your mouth was so wide just now. Did you drink a lot of it?\"\"Ha...the number one beauty in Dongfeng Community! I wanna see which man will dare to kiss her mouth in the future, hahaha...\"Fang Xiao Juan bit her teeth with hatred when she heard these gossips!Some kind people reminded her: \"You should thank Xiu Zhi. If it wasn't for her, you would be still lying on the ground now!\"Fang Xiao Juan became more infuriated!Want her to thank Qiao Xiu Zhi?Not happening!Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't care whether Fang Xiao Juan thanked her at all. She took Da Qiao from Qiao Zhen Guo's hands. The little dumplings hugged her neck tightly. Looking very dependent.She gave Fang Xiao Juan a cold look and frigidly said: \"You treated this child like this and will regret it one day!\"After speaking, she turned around and walked away without a care.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She doesn't know how to write the word regret!If she did regret, then she regretted that she didn't choke that calamity to death when she was born!She glared at Da Qiao, who was lying on Qiao Xiu Zhi's shoulder, with a daggered gaze.As if sensing something, Da Qiao looked at her mom. Immediately, her body shook with fright. Her head was buried in her grandmother's neck. She didn't dare to lift her head up again.Qiao Xiu Zhi stretched out her hand and patted the little dumpling on the back. She didn't turn her head to pay attention to Fang Xiao Juan.Qiao Zhen Guo took in his mom's sassy and heroic steps. With a look of admiration, he thought: My mom is extremely awesome!Wan Chun Ju looked at her mother-in-law's tall back with a pale face: My mother-in-law is extremely scary!Qiao Zhen Guo turned around and saw that his wife's face was different. He couldn't help but curiously said: \"Wife, what are you doing? Could it be you were scared by Mom's heroic appearance?\"Wan Chun Ju's head when up and down liking a chopping knife: \"I was scared. I was scared!\"Qiao Zhen Guo burst into laughter and said, \"What are you afraid of? Mom won't beat people, especially her own people!\"Wan Chun Ju's eyes lit up when she heard these words.But before this joy reached the bottom of her eyes, she heard her man added: \"But if you do something wrong, Mom would still hit people. When Fifth was little, he lied. This resulting him getting his flesh stirred fried with bamboo vine by Mom. Tsk, tsk. Not a good piece of flesh left!\"Wan Chun Ju\u2019s legs became weak again. Not only did she spread rumors that caused Lin Hui to jump into the well, she also pretended to be pregnant. If these things were discovered, how many times would she have to be whipped?The next moment she heard her man continue: \"But if it's you married-in daughter-in-laws, Mom wouldn't be cruel.\"Wan Chun Ju's heart, which had jumped to her throat, settled back in place again. Fortunately, she was married-in daughter-in-law.At this moment, her man went at it again: \"Although she won't be cruel, she will send you packing to your maternal home. Just like Fang Xiao Juan. Hahaha...\"After Qiao Zhen Guo finished speaking, he went after his mom.\"...\"Can you not repeatedly pause when you speak!A mouthful of old blood was blocking her chest. It couldn't go up or down. She almost followed the wild boar!Those who don't take the benefit is a bastard. Wang Shui Sheng quickly organized people to kill this bonus wild boar.Wild boars can't be compared with domestic pigs. They had thick skin and thick flesh. It was very troublesome to handle. Still, everyone wanted to eat meat. No matter how troublesome it was, they were happy to.After working for hours on depilation, peeling, and deboning, everyone's favorite part finally arrived...distribute the meat!\"It's thanks to Qiao Xiu Zhi. If it weren't for her, how could everyone get extra share of meat?\"\"Ain't that right!? Say, how did Qiao Xiu Zhi get this strength? One punch beat a wild boar of more than two hundred jins to death. My god!\"\"That's nothing. The wild boar from back then was bigger than this one. Qiao Xiu Zhi one-punch-killed it! That why you should never mess with Qiao Family in the future. Otherwise, don't cry when you get beaten to death.!\"\"How could we be the kind of people without eyes? Do you think we are like Fang Family?\"At this time, the ridiculed Fang Family was experiencing a human tragedy.The barefoot doctor examined Fang Fu Gui. His leg was broken and had to lie in bed for at least three months.When old Madam Fang heard that her precious son's leg was fractured, she cried and howled, \"Oh Heaven, why are you don't you open your eye? My son is such a good person! Why did you let him suffer such a serious suffering? My poor son ah\u2026\u2026\"Everyone couldn't help but curl their lips.If Fang Fu Gui was a good person, then there would be no bad people in this world!Old Madam Fang was crying like it was a mourning. The cry went high and low. Very rhythmic. But unfortunately, no one came up to comfort her after crying for a long time.When she heard that the meat was about to be distributed, old Madam Fang's cries instantly dead down and jumped up from the ground. As if it wasn't her who cried like her son had died just now.Someone recalled that Fang Xiao Juan had pushed Da Qiao out and suggested to not distribute the wild boar to Fang Family. After all, this wild boar was killed by Qiao Xiu Zhi. Where did Fang Family have the face to get a share?Old Madam Fang went on a rampage. She patted her thigh and jumped three feet high: \"What are you talking about? What are you talking about? If this wild boar hadn't chase my family's Fu Gui, would you still be able to eat pork? Go eat sh*t!\"This immediately angered everyone: \"We have never eaten sh*t. But your family has. And pig urine too. In this way, your family has broad horizon!\"\"Hahaha. God has seen the world. What good is it for you to make me laugh to death?\"Old Madam Fang was so angry that her nose crooked!However, no matter how sharp her mouth was, she can hardly outmatch so many mouth. She was soon scolded into a drowning dog: \"I don't care. If you don't give me a share, I will report to the community and say you bully the poor peasants!\"They were three generations of poor peasants and was usually very proud this!Wang Shui Sheng was annoyed with Fang Family the most, and stated in a rough voice: \"Give. Whoever said won't give. Get in line!\"Not sharing definitely can't do. However the dirty work in the beginning of spring next year can be assigned to Fang Family!Because Qiao Xiu Zhi killed the wild boar alone, Wang Shui Sheng gave Qiao Family 30 jins of pork. Although everyone was very envious, they didn't say anything.Only old Madam Fang's eyes went red from jealousy....Qiao Xiu Zhi held Da Qiao in one hand and pork in the other. They went straight back to Qiao's old home.When the grandmother and granddaughter entered the yard, Xue Chuan was sweeping the snow with a broomstick. Seeing her expression was incorrect, he asked, \"What happened?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi curled her lips: \"It's that Fang Xiao Juan woman. Enough, let's not talk about her. Just talking about it makes one angry!\"Xue Chuan didn't ask any more. Seeing little dumpling's downcast appearance and none of her usual spirit, he couldn't help but feel a little distressed: \"Da Qiao, I just bake corn pancake. Do you want to eat it?\"Da Qiao lifted her head from her grandmother's neck. Her eyes were black and clear. She whispered: \"I haven't eaten it before. Is it delicious?\"Hearing that she hadn't eaten corn pancakes at this age, Xue Chuan's heart ached again. He took her from his wife's arms and said, \"I don't know if it tastes good or not. Would you like to try it for me?\"Dumpling Da Qiao pondered for a while before she nodded earnestly and answered: \"Okay, let me try the taste for Grandfather.\"After speaking, she smacked her small mouth and swallowed a mouthful of saliva. Xue Chuan couldn't help laughing because of her gluttonous appearance.He took the little dumpling's hand and led her to the stove. He took out a pancake from the iron pan: \"Come on. See if it's delicious.\"The freshly baked corn pancakes were golden yellow. Round like a moon and thin. Each bite was crispy. It filled the whole mouth with sweetness and crispiness. Incredibly tasty!Little dumpling Da Qiao consumed in small bites. Her eyes brightened with each bite: \"Grandfather, it's delicious!\"Xue Chuan grinned. He wanted to rub her hair but noticed his hands hadn't been washed. So she could only give up: \"Eat slowly. Don't choke.\"\"I won't choke. Grandfather, Grandmother, eat too.\" She broke the pancake into three portions and gave two of them to her grandparents.Xue Chuan's smile deepened at this sight.Although this child had suffered, her personality hadn't been distorted as a result. She was a kind-hearted child.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't take her pancake: \"Have it yourself. But don't eat too much at once. Be careful that you won't be able to fit the pork dumplings into your stomach!\"Hearing the pork dumplings, Da Qiao's eyes lit up completely.\"Don't worry. I have a big belly, so I can have a lot of things!\" She patted her belly with her little hand. Wanting to show that her belly was big.But she was a small dumpling. How much can her little belly possibly contain?Xue Chuan noticed that Da Qiao's stuttering condition had improved. He glanced at Qiao Xiu Zhi, who nodded at him. Then the two smiled at each other.After Qiao Zhen Jun was paralyzed, Qiao Zhen Min took his eldest brother's children to live in the town. First, he could reduce the burden on the family, and second, he could allow his parents have time to take care of his second brother.Now the supply and demand cooperative was on holiday, he asked someone to pass a message two days ago. Saying, he would be back today.So Qiao Xiu Zhi intended to wait for them to come back and make dumplings together. However, first make some crispy fried pork lard to give this little dumpling as a snack.What Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't lack was strength. She quickly diced the pork fat into cubes, heats the pan, and pour in the oil. Once the oil boils, the pork fat was put in. When the oil was extracted out, the crispy pork lard was done.The crispy pork lard was crispy and flavorful. When one take a bite, it made a crunch. It was interesting and delicious. There were no children in the village who dislike eating these crispy pork lard.This was the first time Da Qiao having crispy pork lard.She had saw Xiao Qiao eating it before. Every time that smell caused her to swallow her drooling saliva. Now it tasted as delicious as she imagined!Although the crispy pork lard was delicious, Xue Chuan was afraid that she would not be able to digest it. He only told her to eat a few pieces and took her out.Xue Chuan took her into the room and pulled out a small unfinished quilted jacket.When Dumpling Da Qiao saw the little cotton-padded jacket, her eyes were as bright as the stars in the sky.She hadn't forgotten that her grandmother said that she would make another quilted jacket for her. Seeing the size of the quilted jacket, it should be this one, right?This one was even more beautiful than the last one. The color was red. More importantly, there was a white rabbit embroidered on it. It was so vivid that it looked like a real one.She poked her little finger and asked shyly, \"Grandfather, this padded jacket...who is it for?\"Xue Chuan rubbed her little head and replied, \"I made it for you. Last time, the piece was made by your grandmother. This piece was made for you by Grandfather. Last time, Grandfather was in poor health, so I only embroidered you a few pear flowers. This time I plan to embroider a few small animals for you. Besides the little rabbit, what else do you want to have embroidered?\"Dumpling Da Qiao was surprised!Last time, the pear blossom was very beautiful. She thought it was her grandmother's handiwork. Unexpectedly, it was her grandfather!The work of sewing clothes in every household was done by women. Why did her grandfather know how to make clothes and embroider such beautiful flowers and small animals?It was amazing!Xue Chuan took in little dumpling's open wide mouth and smiled: \"Grandfather learnt this embroidery from your great grandmother.\"This great grandmother wasn't Qiao Xiu Zhi's mother, but his mother.From eight generations up, his family were all landlords. His mother was a major household's lady and was able to embroider well. Later the family had fallen and his mother relied on this hand embroidery to pay the family debt and support the mother and son.His mother had once wanted to pass this hand embroidery skill to her daughter, but unfortunately she only gave birth to this son. So this hand embroidery can only be passed on to him.It was bad idea to let it get out that men can embroider. So in this family, only Qiao Xiu Zhi knew that he can embroider.Da Qiao was lying on the kang table. Her eyes were black and shiny. Her small face was full of admiration: \"Then Great grandmother is really great?\"Xue Chuan nodded: \"She is. Does Da Qiao want to be as great as Great Grandmother?\"Dumpling Da Qiao fanned out her short hand and shyly uttered: \"Can I?\"Xue Chuan glanced at her little short hand and smiled: \"Of course you can. As long as you want to learn, Grandfather can teach you. So do you want to learn?\"Da Qiao was like a little chicken pecking rice, heavily nodding her small head: \"Yes! I want to learn!\"\"Okay, then I will teach you!\"\"Grandfather, I want, I want to embroider a Gu Gu here.\"Gu Gu was the old hen. This Xue Chuan knew.He merrily nodded: \"Okay, I'll embroider a Gu Gu for you.\"When Qiao Xiu Zhi came in, she saw this sight. One big and one small were discussing embroidering the old hen.The corners of her mouth slowly curved up.In the evening, old Fifth, Qiao Zhen Min finally returned with his family including Qiao Zhen Guo's three children.\"Dad, Mom, I'm back!\" Before Qiao Zhen Min arrived, his loud voice reached first.Wan Chun Ju jumped up from the stool: \"Oh, my precious son is finally back!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi was startled by her. What was Eldest's wife up to now?Wan Chun Ju had a reason to be so excited.In addition to missing her son, there was another very important reason. She realized that her son was her life-saving amulet.Ever since she saw her mother-in-law beat the wild boar with her own eyes that day, she had dreamed that she had become the wild boar in these two nights. And then taken blown to the head from her mother-in-law!She had it too hard!Therefore, in the past two days, she had been pining for the return of her precious son all the time. Once something happens, her son can still plead for her. As for her man, hehe, he was unreliable!Wan Chun Ju rushed out and wrapped An Ping in her embrace. With an agitated look, she spoke: \"Son, if you don't come back, Mom will go to town to pick you up!\"An Ping was eight years old this year. The age where boys doesn't like being close to his mom. When his mom hugged him so tightly, he yelled in disgust: \"Aiya, Mom, let go of me. Do you want to smother me?\"Wan Chun Ju let go of her son. She didn't give her two daughters, Qiao Dong He and Qiao Dong Ying, any glance since they walked in. They exchanged glances.Qiao Dong Ying winked at her elder sister, Qiao Dong He and leaned in as said in a low voice: \"Elder Sister, look. I said Mom won't notice that we are back!\"Even if she noticed, she wouldn't take it seriously.The two girls knew her mom's patriarchal character 800 years ago. Fortunately, their grandmother was the head of the family. Her grandmother was the least patriarchal person in the entire community.Over the years, what younger brother has, they also have. They can even go to school. So there was nothing to complain about.Qiao Dong He was relatively quiet. When she heard her younger sister's words, she pursed her lips and smiled.Qiao Zhen Min came back with two hens in his hands and various New Year goods in his other hand. This garnered a lot of envy along the way.Following him were his wife, Chen Qiao Qiao and his daughter, Qiao Dong Wan.Qiao Dong Wan was only three years old this year. She was being held in her mom's arms, sound asleep with flushed cheeks.The three Qiao brothers were all tall and magnificent. Among them, Qiao Zhen Guo had the simplest personality and most obedient to his mom. In modern terms, he was an extreme mommy boy.Qiao Zhen Jun was the most handsome of the three brothers and looked the most like Xue Chuan. But compared to his dad, he was slightly worse.At the same time, he was also the least talkative of the three brothers.Old fifth, Qiao Zhen Min, was the bold and had flexible brain. He was the smartest of the three brothers.He was currently working as a temporary driver for a supply and demand cooperative. This job was gained from his own connections.When Wan Chun Ju saw her youngest brother-in-law come back with big bag and small bag, she immediately smiled like a chrysanthemum: \"Fifth Brother, Fifth Sister-in-law, you are back? Come, come, give me things. I will take them in!\" Qiao Zhen Min knew exactly what kind of character his eldest sister-in-law was. But these were trivial things, so he didn't drop the other's face and generously handed things over.Wan Chun Ju's hands were full of stuff. She felt that her past few days of panicked heart had been soothed.Hearing that her youngest uncle and the few elder brother and sisters were back, Da Qiao hurriedly ran out of the room.The children came to a halt when they saw Da Qiao.An Ping was the most scatterbrain. At first glance, he thought Da Qiao was Xiao Qiao. He ran over and grinned: \"Sister Xiao Qiao, I haven't seen you for a month. Why have you become shorter rather than taller?\"Da Qiao's face went red from the pinching. She wasn't angry though. Instead, she softly responded: \"Cousin Brother, I am not Xiao Qiao. I am Da Qiao.\"An Ping's chin dropped to the ground.Soon he picked it up again and took a closer look. Well, what do you know. The person in front of him was indeed not Xiao Qiao. Still, this wasn't the Da Qiao he remembered!\"Younger Brother, you don't need your eyes. You can still recognize the wrong person!\" Qiao Dong Ying smacked her younger brother as usual.An Ping had a good attitude when admitting his mistakes. He rubbed his head and smiled: \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, I'm sorry. Brother made a mistake. However, how did you suddenly grow so much? And your face seems to have turned fairer too!\"Qiao Dong Ying agreed with what her younger brother said: \"That's right. Da Qiao, what did you put on. Why did your face become so fair?\"Qiao Dong Ying looked most like Qiao Xiu Zhi, got valiant features. But there was a problem. Her skin was like her mom. She was inherently tanned!So at this moment, seeing Da Qiao's skin pale and tender, she suddenly became envious.Da Qiao's face was flushed. There was no way to tell the koi jade pendant matter.Internally, she made a firm decision. She wanted to give everyone the water with melted jade beads!Since yesterday, she had stealthily put that water into the water her dad drinks. Hoping to help her dad's body.The few children chatted around Da Qiao. Qiao Dong Ying was very enthusiastic in telling her the scenery of the town. Da Qiao was stunned from what she heard.At this side, Qiao Zhen Guo had carried Qiao Zhen Jun over from Qiao's small courtyard.When everyone arrived, Qiao Xiu Zhi announced that the whole family to start making dumplings!When Wan Chun Ju went into the kitchen to carry flour, she saw Chen Qiao Qiao taking out the bowls and chopsticks from the closet. Moving very slowly. The sight made her have the urge to step forward to help her take it!Really, this fifth sister-in-law considered herself as a young miss. If she was made to work, it was estimated that she will not be able to eat even after dark!Wan Chun Ju internally murmured. Her eyes spun and landed on Chen Qiao Qiao's butt.Chen Qiao Qiao turned her head and met with Wan Chun Ju's scorching gaze. Suddenly, her chrysanthemum tightened: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, what are you looking at?\"Wan Chun Ju didn't feel embarrassed about being caught and said confidently: \"I'm looking your belly, Fifth Sister-in-law!\"Chen Qiao Qiao: \"...\"She just came back now and treated her as a fool!She had her back toward her just now. Wan Chun Ju couldn't see her belly at all. Besides, she wasn't blind. She was staring at her butt just now!After Wan Chun Jju told a lie with full of loopholes, she still didn't repent. Her eyes fell on Chen Qiao Qiao's butt from time to time.It made Chen Qiao Qiao have goosebumps. Unable to bear it anymore, she turned around and rushed out.Wan Chun Ju watched Chen Qiao Qiao\u2019s escaping butt and smiled with satisfaction: \"Then I can rest assured!\"From Wan Chun Ju's point of view, Chen Qiao Qiao's small butt would definitely not give birth to a son. In this way, An Ping's position would be preserved!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On top of that, Qiao Family had an addition of thirty jins of boar meat. So she decided on the spot to take out twenty jins of boar meat to eat.Twelve jins of boar meat was used to make dumplings. The remaining eight jins were used for spicy braised pork. A large pot of soy, radish and pork bone soup was made too!When these instructions were passed down, there was a burst of drooling in the hall.Although Qiao Family was better off than the average villager, it wasn't to the point of eating meat every day. Not to mention that\u00a0 twenty jins of pork!Even the few adults couldn't hold back the green light in their eyes. Especially Qiao Zhen Guo and Wan Chun Ju couple. They were both drooling.Qiao Xiu Ying rolled her eyes: \"Wipe your saliva. Look how unpromising you guys are!\"Qiao Zhen Guo foolishly laughed: \"Mom, why do we need to be promising in front of meat?\"Wan Chun Ju fiercely nodded in agreement: \"Aint't that right? Those who think they are promising, don't snatch with us later!\"When she said this, her gaze swept away toward Chen Qiao Qiao.Chen Qiao Qiao glanced at her with a wooden face. Like a proud peacock princess, with her chin held up at forty-five degrees.Seeing this, Wan Chun Ju almost rolled up her sleeves to fight with her. What's the point of being haughty. If you have the ability, don't eat meat later!Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't bother to pay attention to the eyebrow battle between the two daughters-in-law. Like a queen, she began to assign tasks one by one.In Qiao Family, men don\u2019t wait for food with their legs crossed. They all have to work. If they don\u2019t work, then don\u2019t eat meat!However, the brothers of Qiao Family was used to it since they were young. So there was no complaint. Even the paralyzed Qiao Zhen Jun forced himself up to help make dumplings.Qiao Xiu Zhi swept her gaze to him and said: \"Second, if your spine feel uncomfortable, you don't need to help. Mom will set the meat aside for you!\"Old Second Qiao raised his head and smiled at his mom: \"Don't worry, Mom. I know what I'm doing.\"Since the spinal injury, it had been painful every day for a long time. The pain was even more unbearable than the flesh getting cut. Sometimes, his whole body sweated all over from the pain and made him want to slam against the wall to death.Don't know if it was his illusion. He woke up this morning and suddenly felt his body was feeling a lot more comfortable. Now he didn't feel ache from his lumber spine when he sit up.However, he didn't tell anyone about this. For fear that this was just a temporary illusion and make everyone happy for nothing.Qiao Xiu Zhi specially got a small table for the children so that they could learn to make dumplings.Da Qiao's two short hands busied away with great pleasure.Her hands were very clever. Although it was the first time for her to wrap it, it looked decent. Even better than the one wrapped by Wan Chun Ju.An Ping turned his head and looked at the dumplings his younger sister had made. Then looked at what he had made. He immediately felt disdain: \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, we'll exchange what we eat later.\"Dumpling Da Qiao nodded in a good temper: \"Okay.\"Qiao Dong Ying couldn't stand it: \"Be a human, young lad. At such a young and already pinching and swindling. What will you be when you grow up?\"An Ping went red from what his elder sister said.But before he could refute, Wan Chun Ju could not sit still. She turned around and pointed at Qiao Dong Ying as she scolded: \"Yellow-haired girl who does not close the door!\u00a0 How can anyone say that to their younger brother? Talk nonsense again and see how I will sort you out!\"Qiao Dong Ying didn't want to retort her mom. Still, her eyes almost rolled to the sky!Qiao Xiu Zhi just happened to came in. She glared at Wan Chun Ju: \"Keep mucking around and see how I'll deal with you!\"Wan Chun Ju's imposing air completely reduced. She weakly and feebly argued: \"Mom, it's Dong Ying mucking around? I was lecturing her!\"Qiao Dong Ying secretly sneered her lips again.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't look at her anymore. She glanced to the few children: \"Eat the dumplings you make. No one is allowed to play tricks!\"An Ping immediately wailed repeatedly.His dumplings' \"guts\" were already \"spilling\" before they are steamed. Can they still be eaten once they are out the pot?Seeing her elder cousin brother's grief, Da Qiao's little head leaned forward and said: \"Elder Cousin Brother, don't cry. I will give you, mine later!\"A smile instantly reappeared on An Ping's face again. He hooked his arm on her shoulder and patted her: \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, you are loyal enough. If anyone dares to bully you in the future, just tell your elder cousin brother. I will help you beat him!\"An Ping's hands were covered with flour. So this pat stain Da Qiao's clothes with flour.Dumpling Da Qiao's little nose wrinkled until it look like an old man's.Seeing her like this, Qiao Dong He and Qiao Dong Ying couldn't help but chuckle.Qiao's house was rowdy and lively. While Fang's house was full of scolding and cursing.Although Fang Fu Gui's leg was put back into place by the barefoot doctor, the pain was still there. After he got home, he kept crying and howling like a baby. No matter who saw it, it was an sore sight to the eye.As old woman Fang felt distressed for her son's suffering, her heart ached for the 30 jins of wild boar meat that Qiao Xiu Zhi took away. As if the 30 kilograms of meat had been plucked from her. She gritted her teeth with hatred every time she thought of it.Qiao Family got the \"luxury\" take out twenty jins of meat to eat, but Fang Family can't do that. They don't even have twenty jins of meat in total.Originally, old woman Fang wanted to save all the 19 jins of meat for the New Year. Now her son was injured, she gritted her teeth and took out three jins of wild boar meat.There was too little meat. It can only be used for a stew. She threw all the cabbage and potatoes in and stirred them together to make a stew.The dishes produced in this way were difficult to describe in terms of taste and appearance. Still for Fang Family, it was a rare bite of meat. No one would complain at that moment.Fang Xiao Juan washed her whole body three times. She still felt there was a stench on her.As soon as she sat down at the table, old woman Fang cursed with a black face: \"You inherent calamity star. Since you came to Fang Family, our Fang Family hasn't had a good day. Where did you get the face to eat meat? Go over to wherever shady!\"A fire burned in Fang Xiao Juan's heart. This evil fire had nowhere to vent. Now her mom came popping out.She smacked the chopsticks on the table with a \"bang\": \"How am I an inherent calamity? Before I got married, I lived at home for so many years. Why didn't any in Fang Family lack a limb then?\"Many people were double-standard dogs. Fang Xiao Juan was one of them.She can call Da Qiao a calamity, but she didn't allow anyone to say a word about her.Old woman Fang pondered for a moment. It seem that this was indeed the case: \"Even if you aren't an inherent calamity, you are still contaminated by your eldest daughter. Get out of here now!\"Fang Xiao Juan instantly became furious. Not giving me meat, right? Then she must eat it!She picked up the chopsticks and picked up a piece of wild pork. But before the pork entered her mouth, she...threw up!The smell of wild meat was heavier than that of domestic pigs. On top of that, old woman Fang didn't add any deodorizing ingredients when cooking, so that the smell remained.The wild boar's scent burst to her nose. Fang Xiao Juan suddenly recalled the scene of the wild boar peeing on her. She turned her head and vomited out yellow bile.Old woman Fang immediately exploded: \"Damn hoof without lucky mouth! You still disdain when having meat. If you don't eat it, then scram off. Don't make others sick here!\"Fang Family were strong people. Fang Xiao Juan vomited in front of them and they didn't care. They continued to gorge themselves facing the pot.Sitting in the corner, Xiao Qiao frowned so much that she could almost pinched a fly.Things shouldn't be like this!She transmigrated into a book and reborn. She should have been the most lucky person in the world. But why was she so unlucky lately?Suddenly, her pupils shrank and she thought of a possibility.Before she transmigrated into the book in her last life, she had read some novels. In the world of novels, there was a system that can rob others of luck. She now suspected that Da Qiao had obtained such a system.If Da Qiao really got such a system, the first person to snatch luck from must be hers, the main female lead. This would explain why she was so unlucky recently.If this was the case, she must find a way to snatch the system!Qiao Family\u2019s food was finally ready. Five large plates of dumplings were placed on the table, plus a large pot of spicy braised wild pork. In front of everyone was a bowl of big bone soup.Everyone immersed themselves in their hard work and didn't even want to say anything. If have this time to talk, wouldn't it be better to taste an extra piece of meat?Wan Chun Ju munched with an oily mouth. One bite of dumpling. One bite of braised pork. Then a large gulp of big bone soup. It was truly living life with relish more than the gods!Today's spicy braised wild pork was cooked by Xue Chuan himself.His cooking skills were the best in Qiao Family, but he wasn't in good health. So Qiao Xiu Zhi don't let him cook that easily.Wild boar was gamy. One can't be stingy when cooking it. For this pot of braised pork, Xue Chuan added cinnamon, star anise, red pepper, ginger and garlic.Ordinary people weren't willing nor can they come up with so many condiments. Qiao Family have it because there was this driver, Qiao Zhen Min. He often bought something back whenever he travelled around.This recipe of braised pork was not only not gamy, but also spicy and refreshing. In addition, the meat of the wild boar was firm and very chewy. After eating, the mouth burned so much that one sweat. Though the tongue was numb from the hotness, one wasn't willing to put down the chopsticks. The more they eat, the more enjoyable it was.Wan Chun Ju stuffed her mouth full with meat. Before the meat was chewed, she reached out to grab another piece. But when she looked up, she saw her father-in-law giving meat to her mother-in-law with a gentle expression. At once, her teeth felt so sour that nearly fell out.Turning her head, she saw Chen Qiao Qiao giving old Fifth Qiao five dumplings. The couple smiled at each other. The atmosphere was warm and beautiful. Her teeth soured even more.She turned to look at her man, who was focused on gobbling. He never thought of giving her a piece of meat!Suddenly the meat in her mouth wasn't fragrant anymore.Her eyes spun and her gaze settled on Chen Qiao Qiao: \"Qiao Qiao, don't just look out for Fifth Younger Brother. You should eat more. Look how thin you are...Tsk tsk. Woman should have more meat on her body. It\u2019s not that Eldest Sister-in-law is boasting. No matter where I am, people say I\u2019m plump. Back then, at my village, I was a famous for husband-blessing feature. My family Zhen Guo set his eyes on this and married me!\"The implication was that Chen Qiao Qiao was thin. Not as plump as her. Not as husband-blessing as her. She was the winner!But before Chen Qiao Qiao could shoot back, Qiao Zhen Quo spoke \"Wife, you are mistaken. The reason I chose you at the beginning was because you only ate half a bowl of rice during our blind date. I thought women who only eat half a bowl of rice are very easy feed. Who could have known that after I married you in did\u00a0I know I was cheated by you! I've counted. You ate thirty dumplings tonight!\"\"...\"Wan Chun Ju's face went red and white. She was so angry that she almost vomited blood!Why can't that many dumplings and braised pork block his mouth!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why did you count how many dumplings Eldest Sister-in-law ate?\"Qiao Zhen Guo smiled sly and scratched his forehead, \"Isn't it because your eldest sister-in-law has eaten too much? A while ago, she said that she was pregnant and had a bad appetite. I didn't see that she had a bad appetite. I saw her swallowing three dumplings in one bite. Truly not afraid of choking to death!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Can you shut up? Can you shut up?How could he say her in front of so many people? Did she still not want face!?Speaking of it, why Qiao Zhen Guo chose Wan Chun Ju back then was a beautiful misunderstanding.Qiao Zhen Guo always felt that he didn't have much capability. So he thought that he could not generate income for the family. Still, he could reduce the burden on the family.Therefore, his only requirement when choosing a wife was to have a small appetite. As for what she looked like, it was fine as long as she wasn't so ugly that it was considered scary.Of course, he didn't dare to speak out this request publicly. Only observe in private.It happened that Wan Chun Ju failed a few blind dates because of her excessive appetite at home. In order to get married, her mom told her to not open up her appetite when she was on a blind date. Or else, she would beat her to death when she returned!Wan Chun Ju was also worried that she would not be able to marry, so when she saw Qiao Zhen Guo, she only ate a little before saying that she couldn't eat it anymore. Qiao Zhen Guo saw that she had the same appetite as a cat, he was very satisfied. So the two successfully matched.After marrying into the house, Wan Chun Ju had some control at the beginning. Then she became pregnant very quickly. With the excuse of pregnancy, her \"cat-like appetite\" was gone forever!Although Qiao Zhen Guo lamented about his bad eyesight, he had never thought about divorce or anything. Since she could eat, then eat. It wasn't like he could sew her mouth to prevent her from eating, right?Hearing the news that Wan Chun Ju was pregnant, both Qiao Zhen Min and Chen Qiao Qiao paused.A gloom flashed across Qiao Zhen Min's eyes. He squeezed a smile and said, \"Congratulations, Eldest Brother and Eldest Sister-in-law. The house will definitely be more lively when the time comes!\"He had only one daughter. Naturally, he wanted to have more children. But it was a pity that he...Two years ago, he ran into a robber halfway in the journey when he was out in a foreign province. He was injured by the robber. The place where he was injured happened to be that spot.Afterward, he went to the city hospital and was told that it would be difficult to have children in the future. He only told his wife Qiao Qiao about this matter. The family still didn't know about it.Chen Qiao Qiao's slender eyes fell on Wan Chun Ju. A suspicion flashed through her eyes: \"It turns out that Eldest Sister-in-law is pregnant. Why didn't you say that early? You just moved such a heavy object. Will it have a bad effect on you, Eldest Sister-in-law? \"Wan Chun Ju immediately turned into stone.She had completely forgotten about her \"pregnancy\" again!What was she thinking back then? Was her head under or got caught in the door? Why did she make up such a lie?Without waiting for her to answer, Qiao Zhen Guo interrupted again: \"You don't have to worry about her, Younger Sister. She is in good shape. Often accompany her good sister, Gu Gu on laps in old Second's courtyard!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Chen Qiao Qiao was stumped for a moment: \"Gu Gu? Which friend of Eldest Sister-in-law?\"Strange. Why Eldest Sister-in-law's friend show up in Second Brother's house?Could it be...she wanted to introduce her friend to Second Brother?Wasn't this too big of a pitfall?Although Second Brother was good, he was always paralyzed now. No matter how nice he was, it was no good!Da Qiao's baby voice cleared her Fifth Aunt's confusion: \"Gu Gu is the old hen raised by my family. Eldest Aunt likes to play with her. Every time she come over, she will accompany her in running a circle. Last time, she called her Sister. Gu Gu was so happy!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Every time the old hen saw her, she was in a fighting mode. Which eye saw that she happy to see her?Chen Qiao Qiao recovered from the shock and examined Wan Chun Ju with the proud expression of Peacock Princess.Her sixth sense told her that Wan Chun Ju was odd!Wan Chun Ju's hair stood up from her gaze. At the same time, the arrogant gaze ignited a fire inside her: \"Fifth Sister-in-law, why are you looking at me like this? It couldn't be that you are envious about me being pregnant? But this isn't something to be envious about. After all, my family got trait of big butt and easy pregnancy.\"Everyone: \"...\"Was she serious? Showing off her big butt in front of so many people?Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't want to look at these two stupid daughter-in-laws!Chen Qiao Qiao gritted her teeth internally. Suddenly her eyes flashed and smiled: \"Before returning to the village, I heard a very interesting thing.\"Wan Chun Ju shuddered. Her instincts was telling her that what Chen Qiao Qiao was about to say wasn't interesting at all!Chen Qiao Qiao told: \"The yard we live in got a family surnamed Wang. A while ago, that family's daughter-in-law suddenly became pregnant. The three generations of Wang Family only produced a seedling. They were so overjoyed about the news, they immediately spoiled that daughter-in-law. Unexpectedly, a few months passed and there was no reaction at all. Later, she was dragged to the hospital for an examination. It turned out that the daughter-in-law wasn't pregnant. She pretended to be pregnant to cheat for food and drinks. Aunt from Wang Family was so furious that used a rolling pin and gave daughter-in-law a round of beating. Don't you find it interesting?\"Wan Chun Ju was shivering all over.Wan Chun Ju wanted to say what funny!Wan Chun Ju wanted to use the dumplings on the table to plug her mouth!But she dared not!Lord, why did she tell such a lie in the first place!And why did small butt Chen Qiao Qiao looked at her with that kind of eyes?Did she discover something?Qiao Zhen Guo was sitting next to Wan Chun Ju. Once Wan Chun Ju trembled, he swiftly noticed.He lowered his head to look at his wife and found it weird: \"Are you cold, wife?\"Wan Chun Ju shook his head: \"It's not cold.\"\"Why are you shivering like this if it's not cold? I heard that once one is old, their hands and feet will shiver uncontrollably. The old man Xing in the west of the village is like this. Wife, are you declining before you are old?\"With that said, he deliberately imitated the trembling hands and feet of old man Xing as a demonstration for his wife.The movements were vivid, just like convulsions.Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"She can't live this life anymore!Why did she marry such a foolish guy!Qiao Zhen Min glanced at his eldest sister-in-law with a sympathetic look. Then he asked Chen Qiao Qiao in a low voice, \"Is there anyone surnamed Wang in our yard? Why don't I know.\"Chen Qiao Qiao smiled at him: \"There are so many things you don't know!\"If she was just skeptical, then she was 100% sure that Wan Chun Ju wasn't pregnant now!But she couldn't understand why Wan Chun Ju would lie. After all, there was no special treatment for being pregnant in Qiao Family.As the saying goes, the person that who knows you best is not your relative, not your lover, but your foe!Wan Chun Ju never expected that Chen Qiao Qiao saw through her fake pregnancy the first day she came back.Dumpling Da Qiao ate a total of eight dumplings, plus a small bowl of braised wild boar, and a bowl of pork bone soup. Her belly was bulging.\"Grandfather, my belly is so stuffed.\" She leaned in her grandfather's arms and acted cute.Xue Chuan rubbed her round belly and smilingly spoke: \"Wait for a while. Grandfather will take you out for a walk to digest everything.\"Dumpling Da Qiao nodded. Then she pursed her small mouth in shyness: \"When I come back after digestion, I think I can still eat five more dumplings.\"As she said, she displayed the number with her little hand. Looked so delicate and cute.Xue Chuan amusedly nodded: \"Okay, I will set it aside for you. Once your belly have room, I will give it to you.\"Da Qiao happily rubbed her grandfather's hand. Simply as adorable and lovely as a cute kitten.Qiao Zhen Jun watched his eldest daughter act cute with his dad. His heart felt a little sour and uncomfortable.Before at home, this child was had never been like this.He had always thought that her character was like himself. Through and through dull. Now it seem that he was completely wrong!In fact, it wasn't that she was simple and slow-witted. Nor that she didn't like to act cute. But that she knew no one in the family will dote her and let her act child-like. So when she was at home, she always acted sensible and considerate.Seeing that everyone was full, Qiao Zhen Min coughed and announced an important news: \"Dad and Mom, after the New Year, Qiao Qiao and Xiao Wan'er will not go back to the town with me.\"When everyone heard this, they couldn't help being stunned.Although Qiao Zhen Min was only a temporary transporter for the supply and demand cooperative, he knew how to interact and got good network. So he got a single dormitory for himself as soon as he went to the supply and demand cooperative.Qiao Xiu Zhi wasn't the kind of mother-in-law who wanted to bound her daughter-in-law by her side. In her opinion, parents can't accompany their children forever. Only their partners can accompany them until they grow old.Besides, she wasn't too old to move. She didn't need a daughter-in-law to serve her at all. So from the beginning she let Chen Qiao Qiao follow Qiao Zhen Min to the town and live there.Why did they suddenly stop living there?Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at him and asked, \"Did something happen?\"Qiao Zhen Min grinded his back molar and nodded: \"The supply and demand cooperative got a ne director. That dormitory must be let out for his nephew.\"One was the emperor, one was the courtier.The new director certainly didn't like the subordinates who have a good relationship with the previous director. So Qiao Zhen Min, the temporary transporter, was the first on the chopping board.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't feel that the sky had flipped and calmly nodded: \"If this is the case, then move back.\"Seeing his mom's calmness, Qiao Zhen Min's nervousness instantly settled down.In this family, his mom was like a pillar that support everyone. As long as she was there, it seem that there was nothing under the sky that can stump her....After the pork division, the New Year was getting closer.Although everyone lacked food and reduced their spending, big festivals like the New Year held a different meaning in everyone's hearts.The poor have the poor's celebration, the rich have their rich lifestyle. Anyway, regardless of the rich or the poor, they repaired and replenished for the new year. Everyone was very busy.On the second day after Qiao Zhen Min's family came back, Qiao Xiu Zhi led the whole family on a cleaning crusade except for Qiao Zhen Jun, who was immobile. Even Qiao Dong Wan, who was only three years old, received a task.Da Qiao and her two elder cousin sisters were responsible for cleaning the chicken coop together.Both cousins took good care of her. Basically didn't let her dirty her hands.Since Gu Gu drank the water with the koi jade, she can now lay at least two or three eggs every day. On good days, it can reach four or five eggs a day.The people in the Qiao Family were amazed when they saw it.Only Wan Chun Ju hid far away whenever she saw the old hen. Firstly, because she lost face. Secondly, she was afraid that the old hen will go crazy and chase her again.After careful consideration, Qiao Xiu Zhi ordered Qiao Family to not spread this matter.After all, this wasn't an ordinary matter. If it was publicized, not only will they be unable to keep the old hen, Da Qiao may get implicated.No one in Qiao Family was against it.Only laying low, they can make a fortune.Now they can eat eggs every day. How satisfying was that. If the old hen, Gu Gu got snatched, this benefit will definitely be gone.Da Qiao had observed Gu Gu's state. She noticed its vitality didn't change despite laying so many eggs every day. So she can safely give the koi jade water to Qiao's old house's hens to drink.Therefore, the old hens in Qiao's old house began to lay eggs every day after Gu Gu. Everyone in Qiao Family couldn't close their mouths in joy.In addition to feeding it to the old hens, Da Qiao also drank it herself. She secretly gave it to her dad and Qiao Family.Among them, her grandfather drank the most.Her grandfather's health was very bad. When the weather is cold, he has to lie in bed for many days. His face was as pale as paper. Her grandmother was so worried that she can't eat every time.She didn't like to see her grandfather and her grandmother unwell. So she secretly threw jade beads into the water her grandfather drinks every day now. Hoping that the jade water can make her grandfather get better.During this time, Da Qiao was very busy. On the contrary, Xiao Qiao had it rough.Fang Fu Gui suffered a fracture and couldn't work to the field. His leg was still throbbing, which made his temper reached its worst point. The whole Fang Family from old woman Fang to the youngest daughter who was just born less than half a year ago was scolded by him.In this atmosphere, old woman Fang's temper increased every day. Very explosives. Just a touch and it exploded. During this period, Fang Xiao Juan had been scolded into a dog every day. Her life was terrible.Looking upon the fact that Xiao Qiao was a child prodigy, old woman Fang hadn't scolded her for the time being. Still, she didn't gave her any good attitude. Pointing at the mulberry when scolding the locust tree was an common occurence.Xiao Qiao was also very irritable. She wished to move out of Fang's house immediately: \"Mom, didn't you see Uncle Wang last night?\"Fang Xiao Juan's face was as dark as the ditch: \"That damn man. He wants to flipped his face and refuse to recognize people after eating cleanly. As if I'll let him have his way!\"Since she was pissed on her face by the wild boar that day, she had never seen Wang Xin Sheng in person again.She used the previous contact method, tying a cloth strip to the tree. As long as he was in the village, he could see it. She waited in the thatched hut until dawn a few times and even almost froze herself, she did not see him!Dog man!Want to abandon her? Dream on!Xiao Qiao frowned: \"Mom, what can you do?\"She guessed that Wang Xin Sheng was disgusted by the fact that her mom was pissed on her face by a wild boar. She was also very speechless about this!How did her mom provoke that plague god, Da Qiao again?She had clearly warned her before and told her not to provoke her during this period of time. She readily promised. With a turn of a head, she sought death again!Fang Xiao Juan's lip corner curved into a smile. She lowered her head and touched her flat belly and said: \"With this, I'm not afraid of him denying it!\"Xiao Qiao's eyes widened: \"Mom, you mean... you are pregnant?\"Fang Xiao Juan nodded triumphantly: \"Exactly a month. Wait another half a month. If he doesn't contact me, I will go to their Wang's house to cry!\"If their Wang Family dared not recognize the child in her stomach, she would go to the police station to report Wang Xin Sheng for indecent behavior!At that time, not only will Wang Xin Sheng be arrested and shot, but also their entire Wang Family will become misfortunate!And Wang Shui Sheng. Don't even think about being the production team leader!Xiao Qiao finally stretched her frowning brows when she heard these words.Wonderful, this child came at the right time!As long as they had this child, she and her mom can enter Wang family smoothly and also gain a firm foothold in Wang Family!After solving her mom's affairs, she thought of Da Qiao's matter again.After much deliberation, she still couldn't determine whether Da Qiao got a system. So she went to the Qiao's small courtyard to find her. She wanted trick the truth out from her mouth. However, her few trips, she came up empty!She didn't dare to go to Qiao's old house to find her. Simply vexing to death!With the arrival of New Year's Eve, she soon had no time to seek to Da Qiao, because she was forced to stay at home by old woman Fang to take care of her little cousin sister Mao Ya Tou, who was still a baby.Before she transmigrated into a book, she hated children in the previous life. Bratty kids and the likes were the most disgusting!Before, when she was in Qiao's house and didn't have to do any work. It wasn't an exaggeration to say that her ten fingers would never get dirty due to chores. Unexpectedly, when she came to Fang's house, she got to wipe the baby's poo and pee. It was so disgusting that she couldn't eat!It happened that Mao Ya Tou was difficult to mind. She had diarrhea every so often. Whenever she did, she wailed loudly. She can't coax her to stop. Once she cries, Fang Fu Gui will curse at others. Following that, old woman will come in and yell at her.Her nose became crooked from anger!She really didn't want to stay at Fang's house anymore!...Under everyone's anticipation, the '73 Spring Festival had finally arrived.On New Year\u2019s Eve, Qiao Zhen Jun was once again carried by Qiao Zhen Guo to Qiao\u2019s old house.Qiao Xiu Zhi led her two daughter-in-laws into the kitchen room early in the morning, while Xue Chuan supervised their two sons on pasting the Spring Festival couplets. Everyone worked away.Da Qiao was so happy for the first time during the New Year. A grin pasted on her little face.There was no need to work. From time to time, she can follow Elder Cousin Brother and run over the stove to have a sneaky bite. Although she felt this was wrong, but it was really exciting!The most important thing was that she finally put on new clothes this New Year!When she woke up this morning, she deliberately put on the little padded jacket her grandfather made for her. Although she can't see herself without a mirror, she felt pretty!Qiao Dong Ying rubbed her padded jacket and said with envy: \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, your clothes are so beautiful! Grandmother is so nice to you!\"It was a lie to say she wasn't eating vinegar or feeling envious. After all, who didn't want to wear new clothes?But she didn't feel jealous or hated Younger Sister Da Qiao because of this. Younger Sister Da Qiao had a bad life in the past. Now it was rare chance to have new clothes. This was how it should be.Dumpling Da Qiao's small face flushed red. She twisted her body and responded, \"Grandfather made this for me. Elder Sister Dong Ying, am I beautiful today?\"Qiao Dong Ying threw back her head and laughed loudly: \"Look how vain you are! Right! You are the most beautiful!\"Qiao Dong He pursed her lips in mirth while working at the side.Only Wan Chun Ju felt uncomfortable at the sight of Da Qiao wearing something new. As if it was her flesh being cut.In her opinion, what point was there for a girl to wear new clothes? Especially for the likes of calamity Da Qiao. Let alone wearing new clothes, she should be driven to Fang's house when the divorce happened!Although Wan Chun Ju didn't like Xiao Qiao very much, she felt Xiao Qiao was better than Da Qiao.After all, Xiao Qiao was a well-known child prodigy in Dongfeng Community. With a child prodigy in the family, she feels a shine on her face when speaking about it.In addition to Wan Chun Ju, there was another person who thought of Xiao Qiao at this moment. This person was Chen Qiao Qiao.Chen Qiao Qiao liked niece Xiao Qiao very much since she married into Qiao Family.She felt Xiao Qiao was well-behaved and sensible. Beautiful and smart. Simply the daughter of her dreams!She wondered many times how someone like Fang Xiao Juan could give birth to such a good child as Xiao Qiao. Xiao Qiao should be her child!It was only on this trip back did she find out that Xiao Qiao had gone to Fang's house with Fang Xiao Juan. She was very disappointed.Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at her from time to time. She couldn't pretend that she didn't know even when she wanted to: \"If you got something to say, spit it out!\"Chen Qiao Qiao deliberated before replying, \"Mom, isn't it the New Year? Do you think we should bring Xiao Qiao over for the countdown?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi raised her eyes and gave her a cool gaze. She didn't answer her stupid question.When Chen Qiao Qiao received this gaze from her mother-in-law, she almost fell on the ground due to her legs softening.Wan Chun Ju sneered, \"I say, Fifth Sister-in-law, Xiao Qiao is no longer a child of our Qiao Family. Why are you still thinking about her? If you really can't bear her, you can go to Fang's house too!\"Chen Qiao Qiao switched to her Peacock Princess arrogant mode in a second and stated with a high chin, \"Eldest Sister-in-law, what are you talking about? Due to the child's small age, I feel distressed for her. Besides, even though she went to Fang's house, her blood still contained the blood of our Qiao Family!\"There was a reason why Wan Chun Ju always targeted Chen Qiao Qiao.Chen Qiao Qiao was a town girl. Plus she had gone to high school. The highest educated person in the entire Qiao Family. So she always had a sense of superiority.And this sense of superiority reached the highest value when facing the rural woman named Wan Chun Ju.Wan Chun Ju disliked her up high appearance. The two couldn't get along with each other since the beginning. The actual grudge started four years ago.That year, Chen Qiao Qiao followed Qiao Zhen Min back to the village for the New Year. Back then, the four year little An Ping was very curious about this youngest aunt who came from the town and wanted to climb onto her by himself.Chen Qiao Qiao saw his snot-filled face and dirty hands, she pushed him away subconsciously. Xiao An Ping couldn't stand stably and fell backward with his four limbs facing up. At once, a howl reached the sky.Wan Chun Ju rushed in when she heard her precious son crying. After learning about the situation, she raised her hand and gave Chen Qiao Qiao a slap in the face!Since young Chen Qiao Qiao, she had never suffered this kind of anger?Like this, the two's feud formed.Whenever Wan Chun Ju saw Chen Qiao Qiao, she couldn't help but poke her.It happened that her IQ and eloquence weren't Chen Qiao Qiao's match. Just one gaze from Chen Qiao Qiao was enough to make her mad.Qiao Xiu Zhi watched the two of you exchange verbal fight with each other and slammed the basin in her hand on the stove: \"All out. Once you quarrel enough, come back then!\"The two were silenced in a second. They glared at each other.Wan Chun Ju paused to ponder. She felt that she could save the situation a little bit: \"Mom, I'm not to blame for this. It's all because this woman. Mentioning Xiao Qiao out of nowhere...\"\"Both get out! Don't let me say the same thing a third time!\"Wan Chun Ju didn't dare to make a sound anymore. Like quails, they slipped out of the stove room.As soon as she walked out of the stove, Wan Chun Ju immediately cursed, \"You make Mom angry as soon as you come back. Fifth Sister-in-law, you are really a natural troublemaker!\"Chen Qiao Qiao raised her chin open. A weird smile appeared at the corner of her mouth: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, you're pretending to be pregnant, right?\"In an instant, Wan Chun Ju was petrified. It took a long time to squeeze out a dry answer: \"You, what nonsense are you talking about?\"\"Whether I am talking nonsense, you should know, Eldest Sister-in-law!? Eldest Sister-in-law, what do you think Mom would do when find out that you were pretending to be pregnant?\"Wan Chun Ju trembled: \"...\"Chen Qiao Qiao took in her guilty conscience and became certain that she faked the pregnancy.Qiao Zhen Guo and Qiao Zhen Min heard their mother's angered voice from outside just now, so they came to see what happened.Qiao Zhen Min spoke: \"What happened? Why did I seem to hear my mom yell?\"While Qiao Zhen Quo turned to wife and sighed: \"Wife, why did you make Mom angry again? Can't you behave during the new year?\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"He was also a husband. How come he assumed that she was the one who caused the trouble?Even if he can't defend her, don't drag her down and step on her face!However Qiao Zhen Guo couldn't understand her expression and continued to sigh: \"Shouldn't had married a wife at the beginning. If I didn't marry a wife, Mom won't be angered.\"Qiao Zhen Min: \"...\"Brother, doing this make it easier for you become a loner!Wan Chun Ju went red and white with anger: \"Qiao Zhen Guo, what do you mean by that? Do you want to divorce me?\"Qiao Zhen Guo looked dumbfounded: \"No. Why would you think of a divorce? You are so funny!\"Qiao Zhen Min: \"...\"Chen Qiao Qiao: \"...\"Wan Chun Ju felt that her face was lost in front of Chen Qiao Qiao: \"Qiao Zhen Guo, live by yourself. I will go back to my maternal home!\"Wan Chun Ju originally wanted to threaten her man by returning to her maternal home. It was a pity that Qiao Zhen Guo and her had never been on the same channel.Hearing this, Qiao Zhen Guo nodded and said, \"Sure. Your appetite is getting bigger and bigger now. It's fine for you to go back to your maternal home for a period of time. This way, you won't eat until your in-law's family into poverty.\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"This time, even Chen Qiao Qiao looked at Wan Chun Ju with sympathy.Da Qiao didn't know what happened in Qiao's old house. At this moment, she was sneaking to the East Forest.She hid her small body behind a big tree and made a 'gu gu' sound.Soon, a 'gu gu' sounded from behind the big tree a few meters away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His brows curved with joy.Both Lin Hui and educated youth Qin were good-looking. Little Dong Lin got his strengths; their handsome facial features, red lips, and white teeth. A very beautiful little dumpling.The two little dumplings ran toward each other and held each other's hands.Da Qiao took out two eggs from her pocket and handed them over: \"One for you, one for Auntie Hui!\"Ever since Auntie Hui was beaten, Da Qiao had always been worried about Auntie Hui. But she didn't dare to visit Aunt Hui like before. For fear that she would affect Auntie Hui again.So she and Younger Brother Dong Lin would come here from time to time to meet secretly.Little Dong Lin fished into his pocket and took out a small handful of white rabbit candy: \"For you, Elder Sister Qiao Qiao!\"It was white rabbit candy!Da Qiao's eyes lit up: \"Thank you, Younger Brother Dong Lin!\"She hadn't eaten white rabbit candy before. She had seen her younger sister having it. It smelled so good.She felt her saliva was about to drool out.Little Dong Lin smiled happily when Elder Sister Qiao Qiao didn't refuse his sweets. His eyes curved.He put the egg given by Elder Sister Qiao Qiao into his pocket. He pulled out his fingers and said in his babyish voice: \"Dong Lin hasn't seen Elder Sister Qiao Qiao one, two, three... for many, many days. Dong Lin misses Elder Sister Qiao Qiao very much!\"Younger Brother Dong Lin's face was fair and tender. Nice and chubby. Da Qiao couldn't help but pinch him when she saw him, \"Elder Sister Qiao Qiao, miss you too!\"Little Dong Lin didn't get angry even when his cheek was pinched. Instead, he obediently moved his little cheek to make it easier for Elder Sister Qiao Qiao to pinch.After a long conversation, the two little dumplings reluctantly separated and made an arrangement to meet here again in a few days.Once Little Dong Lin got home, Dong Lin sneaked into the kitchen. He wanted to secretly put the eggs given by Elder Sister Qiao Qiao into the egg basket. However, he didn't expect his mom to come in as soon as he opened the basket.In fact, Lin Hui had long discovered her son had secretly left the house early in the morning. This child had always been well-behaved and sensible, so she didn't restrain him too much.She never thought he would be gone for a long time and brought back two eggs. What's more, with a sneaky appearance. How could her thoughts become bad!Lin Hui said with a stern face: \"Where did your eggs come from?\"Little Dong Lin got startled. The egg in his hand almost fell to the ground. With a guilty conscience, he whispered \"...Grandma gave it.\"Lin Hui could tell that he was lying at a glance and couldn't help being even more furious: \"You dare to lie! Did you steal this egg?\"After being accused by his mom, Little Dong Lin felt aggrieved and angry in his heart. His face flushed red: \"No! I didn't steal it!\"Lin Hui said, \"Then tell me, where did this egg come from? If you dare to steal someone else's egg, I will break your leg!\"Since ancient times, widows attracted many trouble.Even when there were five elder brothers in the family, it still can't stop all kinds of gazes and rumors. The only thing she can do was to straighten her back and be a decent person.So she was very strict with Dong Lin since he was little. Her mom couldn't stand the sight many times.How could her ache no ache? But she had no choice!Without a father, Dong Lin already had it harder than others. If he wasn't careful with his words and conduct, the road in the future will be even more difficult!Xiao Dong Lin's lips were pressed tightly. His deep black eyes stubbornly looked at his mom: \"I didn't steal the egg!\"\"You bad boy! How did Mom teach you normally? Told you to not take other people's things. Disobedient. Now you have learned to lie. I must teach you today until you change it!\"Lin Hui saw that he was still unwilling to tell the truth even at this point, her internal anger burst out with a \"ripple\" and she immediately lost her mind.She picked up the feather duster on the case: \"Put out your hand!\"Although Little Dong Lin was young, he got a stubborn temper. He put the egg in his pocket and then held out his palm with his mouth pouted.Looking at his white and tender little hands, Lin Hui couldn't bear to on the inside. But at the thought that the child learned to be bad, she fiercely gritted her teeth and hit hard.Little Dong Lin gritted his teeth and tears gathered in his eyes. But he stubbornly didn't let the tears fall.\"Do you know your wrong?\" Lin Hui asked him.Xiao Dong Lin's eyes flushed red: \"I'm not wrong! I didn't steal eggs!\"Seeing him like this, Lin Hui became more and more mad. In one go, she hit three or four times.From the beginning, a child's hand was tender. After a few strokes, it soon became red and swollen.When Wang Qiu Ying entered the door and saw this scene, she instantly cried out as if she was the getting the hit: \"You dead child, what are you doing?\"All old people dote the one-generation-gap generation. Wang Qiu Ying was no exception.Although she doted her daughter, she loved this white, tender, and well-behaved little grandson even more.Lin Hui did feel heartaches but she didn't want to give in on principled matters: \"Mom, leave it alone! Don't know where this kid got the two eggs. I asked him, but he wouldn't say anything!\"Wang Qiu Ying patted her thigh and uttered, \"So you suspect Dong Lin stole someone else's eggs? Is there anyone who would suspect their own child like you? You...you anger me to death!\"\"He just lied. He said that you gave him these two eggs. Mom, tell me honestly, did you really give him these eggs?\"Lin Hui didn't want to accuse her child, but eggs were so precious these days. Who would give eggs to others for free?The two eggs were naturally not given by Wang Qiu Ying.She didn't expect that her well-behaved little grandson would actually lie: \"I gave it.\"\"Mom!\" Lin Hui was almost pissed off to death by her mom, \"You aren't loving him by doing this. You are harming him! As the old saying goes, when young, steal needle, when older, steal gold. If he isn't educated now, he can't be taught in the future!\"Little Dong Lin's face flushed red. Suddenly he pushed his grandma away and ran out crying: \"I didn't steal the eggs. You are bad Mom. Dong Lin won't like you anymore!\"Before he ran out, he tripped on the threshold and fell face flat with a \"bang\".The palm of his hand was scratched and the two eggs in his pocket were also broken.Seeing that the egg was broken, Xiao Dong Lin couldn't help sob: \"Waaa... the egg that Elder Sister Qiao Qiao gave is broken...Waaa...\"\"Oh, my dear little grandson.\" Wang Qiu Ying ran over in distress and hugged the little dumpling.Lin Hui came to a halt when she heard the child's words: \"Dong Lin, you said Da Qiao gave you this egg?\"Little dumplings also have a temper!Little Dong Lin was mad with his mom. He laid in his grandma's arms and didn't give his moa a glance.Wang Qiu Ying slashed her daughter with her gaze: \"I said that Dong Lin is sensible and obedient. How could he possibly do something like stealing. You can't assume that a child can be scold and hit at will. It will make the child's heart cold sooner or later. Fang Xiao Juan is a role model of that!\"After speaking, she carried her little grandson back to the old house.Lin Hui watched her son get taken away. There was guilty and discomfort in her heart.At Qiao Family's side, Wan Chun Ju and Chen Qiao Qiao stopped fighting and went back into the kitchen to help their mother-in-law prepare the New Year's Eve dinner.As for Wan Chun Ju's talk about going back to her maternal home, just listening was enough.Before five o'clock, the New Year's Eve dinner was ready.In order to take care of the paralyzed Qiao Zhen Jun, the food was placed on the kang table. The kang table was too small. It had to be divided between two tables. One table for adults and one table for children.There were a total of three meat dishes and three vegetarian dishes on each table. Because Xue Chuan had recovered in the past two days, he made the few meat dishes personally. They tasted so wonderful that everyone almost swallowed their tongues!Everyone once again kept the good habit of \"don't talk when eating\". The chopsticks that went out were quick and accurate. Each clip was a piece of meat. Everyone got an oil-covered mouth.Wan Chun Ju channeled her grief and anger into strength and filled her belly one clip of meat after another. After the belly was fed, her mood improved.After eating, Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan returned to the room and took out the New Year's Eve money.When the children saw the new year money, their eyes instantly brightened.An Ping was the fastest react. He knelt down to his grandparents with a 'putong': \"Grandfather, Grandmother, wish you a prosperous new year! Wish Grandmother to hit a few more wild boars next year, so that everyone can eat meat every day!\"Everyone was amused by An Ping's blessing.Wan Chun Ju looked at her precious son with pride.As expected of her son. He should act fast and accurate at this time!Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan each gave the children new year money. They both gave a penny.Da Qiao held the warm two penny in her hand. Her little face flushed with excitement.This wasn't the first time she received new year money, but this was the first time she had the right to use the new year money.In the past, her dad would give her new year money, but her mom would take the money away with a turn of a head. The reason wasn't the adult\u2019s usual \u201cI\u2019ll save it for you first\u201d, but rather outright that she was a calamity. Didn't qualified to use the new year money!An Ping received the new year money from his grandparents and immediately turned his attention to his two uncles.\"Second Uncle, wish you a prosperous new year and wish Second Uncle get better soon. Quickly take out the new year money!\"\"Third Uncle, you are the best. You look handsome and generous. Surely this new year's money is more than a penny, right?\"Hearing An Ping's words, everyone burst into laughter again.Da Qiao saw that her cousin had received a lot of new year money. So she copied her elder cousin brother and paid new year greetings to all the elders.In a short while, she had enough five penny in her hands. This made her extremely excited.Wan Chun Ju took in the good atmosphere and said a few nice words to please her parents-in-law: \"Dad, your cooking is so good. If you have time, do teach Dong He and Dong Ying. They both got shabby looks and un pleasing personality. I\u2019m afraid no one will want them in the future. If they learn how to cook, they will have a good point. It will be easier to find a husband in the future.\"Qiao Dong He and Qiao Dong Ying were happily discussing how to use the new year money when their mother gave them a jab out of nowhere!The two sisters were extremely depressed.But soon, their father avenged for them!They witnessed Qiao Zhen Guo sighed and spoke, \"About this, it's your fault. As the mother, you don't pretty. The children inherited it from you, so how can they be good-looking?\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Why did was she dragged in again?This dog man really wanted to anger her to death!An Ping bowed too violently. When he stood up, his vision became dark and he fell down with a \"bang\".Wan Chun Ju felt distressed for her son and couldn't worry about getting angry. She ran over immediately. Unexpectedly, her feet slipped and she fell flat on the ground.\"Oh... my belly...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Initially, she didn't take it seriously. However, her stomach suddenly ached.There was still a dampness under her butt. She reached out and touched: \"Blood! I'm bleeding! I'm going to die!\"Everyone was shocked.Just now when Wan Chun Ju was wailing, they thought she was pretending. But now they saw blood on her hand, they stood up one after another.Qiao Zhen Guo was also stunned. He ran to his wife with a blank face and squatted down: \"Wife, you have to hold on!\"Wan Chun Ju's expression displayed 'weakness': \"Zhen Guo, we have been a husband and wife for so many years. I haven't asked you anything...\"Before she could finish her words, Qiao Zhen Guo interrupted: \"Who said you haven't! Didn't you tell me to praise you a while ago? It's really difficult. Say, you don't have any good points. How am I supposed to praise you? Then again, why is your memory so poor, wife? It looks like you are declining before you get old!\"\"...\"Wan Chun Ju's breath didn't come out and almost died in front of her man!Everyone: \"...\"Chen Qiao Qiao knew that she shouldn't laugh at this time, but she really couldn't help it!Eldest Brother was really a mudslide among men!Wan Chun Ju took a deep breath: \"Don't talk. Let me finish speaking before you answer! As the saying goes, there is a stepmother, there is a stepfather. If I die, can you not marry again?\"When bringing up such a request, Wan Chun Ju was truly worried.After all, Qiao Zhen Guo was only thirty-two years old. At the prime of his life. She was really worried that he would marry a dominatrix who would abuse her precious son.Unexpectedly, Qiao Zhen Guo nodded and agreed: \"Don't worry about this. If you die, I will never marry again!\"Wan Chun Ju was moved!Although her man often angered her, he had her in his heart.Unexpectedly, the next moment she heard her man add: \"If you die, there will one less big stomach king in the family. I can't marry another one. If they can eat as much as you, then I might as well be a bachelor! \"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Sometimes this was how the sky chat into a dead end!F*** that moved feeling. F***that having her in his heart!With anger stifling in her chest, Wan Chun Ju felt the pain her stomach increased: \"Go away. I don't want to see you! Oh, my stomach...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't even want to look at these idiots!If it wasn't for eldest looking her and her husband, she really suspected that he wasn't her and Xue Chuan's child!She calmly commanded: \"Fifth, go to the production team leader for a letter of introduction and borrow the mule cart on the way! Eldest, don't make a noise from now on. When the mule cart comes, you will carry your wife onto it and follow to the hospital!\"Qiao Zhen Guo raised his head and looked at his mom with a dumbfounded expression on his face.Why not let him speak? What did he do wrong?Fortunately, he was the most obedient to his mom. Since his mom didn't want him make a sound, then he won't make any.Qiao Zhen Min soon borrowed the mule cart back. Qiao Zhen Guo picked up his wife and put her on the mule cart.Qiao Xiu Zhi turned to Xue Chuan: \"I will follow. At homey will be handed over to you.\"Xue Chuan gently grasped his wife's hand: \"Don't worry.\"On the way, Wan Chun Ju screamed like a pig. How could that not attract everyone\u2019s attention.Someone came over and asked, \"Zhen Guo's wife, what's wrong with you?\"Why do you yell like you're laboring?Wan Chun Ju kept on screaming: \"I'm going to die. My stomach hurts to death!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi was closed to rolling her eyes to the sky. Right there and then, she ordered her eldest daughter-in-law: \"Eldest's wife, shut up!\"Wan Chun Ju was covered with a thick quilt. No one saw her bleeding. Only her face was terrible. With the way she hollered, it didn't look like she was pretending.Everyone became more curious.As soon as Qiao Xiu Zhi and the group left, they immediately headed to Qiao's house to dig out the news.The children in Qiao Family were all reminded by Xue Chuan in advance. So no one could inquired out anything. Still, they got the whole story from Gu Family, who lived next door to Qiao Family.\"Zhen Guo's wife fell. It seems the fall wasn't light. She was bleeding. The child in her belly definitely can't survive!\" Old woman Gu sighed.\"What? Zhen Guo's wife is pregnant? Can't tell at all.\"After all, everyone still had the impression of her running with her legs kicking up winds.Old woman Gu was very proud about being well informed: \"We live next door to Qiao Family. How can we not know?\"Someone wondered: \"Why did she fall out of the blue? She ran so fast that day and didn't fall!\"Old woman Gu suddenly lowered her voice and said, \"According to me, it must be due to getting affected by Da Qiao's bad luck. Look, before that child come, everyone in Qiao Family was fine. She has been here a little bit more hardworking recently and things happened!\"As soon as this remark came out, it was immediately approved by everyone.Wasn't that right? That Da Qiao was too evil!She almost killed her mom and sister at birth. Paralyzed her father. Now it was Wan Chun Ju's turn!Tsk tsk. Got to stay away from that kid in the future!The fact that Wan Chun Ju fell and bleed quickly spread throughout Qili Village like a wind with wings.Fang Family soon knew about it.Fang Xiao Juan was overwhelmed with pride. During this period of time, Fang Family was so unlucky. Finally she heard a piece of good news!She went to the entrance, slapped her thighs and shouted loudly: \"I've said it a long time ago, that is an inherent ill-omen calamity. Whoever interact with her become unlucky!\"\"Xiao Qiao and I both left Qiao's house. But every time we met her, we either fall or get beaten. I advise you not to approach her in the future, otherwise you still don't know what ill omen will fall upon you! \"Even the people who were friends with Qiao Family didn't stand up to speak for Da Qiao this time.It was so unlucky to see blood during the New Year!The children in Qiao Family were frightened.Especially An Ping. His mom fell because she wanted to go over to help him. Though he was holding the warm new year money, there was no smile on his face.Da Qiao was very worried.Seeing that her cousins were unhappy, she immediately took out the white rabbit candy that Younger Brother Dong Lin had given and shared it with her them.Xue Chuan walked in and saw this scene. A smile was revealed on his face.In order to comfort the few children, he took out the New Year goods that he was going to give to the guests to eat. An Ping was simple-minded. Seeing so many food to eat, he became energetic again.Qiao Xiu Zhi commanded the two sons and hurried to the town hospital.This journey was really difficult.Not to mention the potholes and unevenness of the road, snow fell halfway. Wan Chun Ju's wailing sounded all the way. Qiao Xiu Zhi was close to making to her faint with a palm whack!The doctor on duty saw a big man coming in with a blood-covered woman. With a solemn face, he ushered: \"Hurry. Hurry, bring her to the emergency room!\"After asking about the situation, even the doctor thought Wan Chun Ju's baby couldn't be saved.Unexpectedly, after some inspection, the child didn't miscarry despite the large amount of bleeding!The two doctors on duty in the obstetrics and gynecology department were all stunned: this child was too tenacious, right?Everyone in Qiao Family breathed a sigh of relief when they heard that the child hadn't miscarried.Only Wan Chun Ju was frozen. After half a day, she pulled the doctor's sleeve and asked: \"Doctor, are you sure I have... a child in my stomach?\"Wan Chun Ju was really shocked!She pretended to be pregnant before. How did the act become real?When the doctor heard her question, he halted for a while. Quickly they understood it as she was worried about the child miscarrying. So they comforted her: \"Don't worry, Ma'am. Although you bleed a lot, your child is very strong. Still, you have to be careful later and don't fall anymore!\"Wan Chun Ju was stunned on the spot. Her eyebrows immediately displayed glee in the next moment.She was pregnant!In this way, she no longer had to worry about the lie being exposed!When Chen Qiao Qiao knows that she was pregnant, her nose will be crooked from anger!Although the child didn't drop, Wan Chun Ju had bleed a lot. So, to be on the safe side, the doctor got them to stay in the hospital for observation for one day. The discharge will be tomorrow if there was nothing wrong with her.Although Qiao Xiu Zhi often felt her eldest daughter-in-law was as stupid as a pig, she wasn't a harsh mother-in-law. Naturally, she will not make things difficult in situation like this.She told Qiao Zhen Guo to stay and take care of his wife. She and old Fifth went home and informed the rest of the family members. They will come back to pick them up tomorrow.Before leaving, Qiao Xiu Zhi gave Qiao Zhen Guo five yuan for him spend.Qiao Zhen Guo watched his mom and brother walked out the entrance. Once he couldn't see them anymore, he turned back to the ward.Wan Chun Ju was lying on the hospital bed. Her hand rubbing her belly with a proud look: \"Zhen Guo, I have a hunch. This one must be a son!\"Whether it was a son or daughter, it didn't matter to Qiao Zhen Guo. Once it was born, it needs to be raised.Wan Chun Ju was in a good mood right now. She didn't need her man to answer. She can keep talking: \"Zhen Guo, say if I increase the son in Qiao Family, will Mom reward me?\"Qiao Zhen Guo looked at her with a strange expression: \"You aren't giving birth for my mom. Why should she reward you?\"That kind of heart-suffocating feeling was happening again!Wan Chun Ju told herself that she must not be angry: \"The point I am talking about is son. A son! At present, only I have given birth to a son in your Qiao Family. Both Second Brother and Fifth Brother have only daughters. If I have another son, won\u2019t I become the great hero of Qiao Family?\"Qiao Zhen Guo smilingly looked at her: \"My mom gave birth to three sons. While you want a reward with one son. Although you don't look good, you can dream pretty!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Why did she never remember and want to talk to this silly guy!Wan Chun Ju was so angry that her chest heaved ups and downs violently. She flipped around angrily,. Not wanting to talk to her man again!It was already completely dark when they rushed to the town hospital, so Qiao Xiu Zhi and her son hurried back in the dark.In fact, from a safety point of view, it was best for them to stay in the town hospital for one night and come back with Zhen Guo and his wife tomorrow. But Qiao Xiu Zhi was worried about her family, so she decided to come back that night.When they returned to Qili Village, most of the villagers had already fallen asleep. Only Qiao's house was still lit.Xue Chuan heard the movement and ran out with a coat. While putting it on his wife, he asked, \"How is it? Eldest's wife is okay?\"\"Eldest's wife is okay. Haven't miscarried!\" Qiao Xiu Zhi grasped his hand and found that his hand was cold, \"Your body isn't good. You shouldn't come out!\"Saying that, the two couples huddled together and went in.Qiao Zhen Min: \"...\"Mom and Dad, have you forgotten that there is a son behind you?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, in these years, he had never seen a couple with a better relationship than his parents!He carried in cold air as he entered the room. Originally, he thought that he would be greeted by a cold room. Unexpectedly, the light in the room was still on.The corner of his mouth raised and he strode in in big step.On this day, Qiao Family had a turbulent New Year's Eve.The next day was the first day of the new year. People were coming and going outside. It was very lively.Some women who like to gossip use the opportunity of visiting to inquire about Wan Chun Ju.Qiao Xiu Zhi was annoyed their behavior. But if she doesn't say, the rumors will be even worse.So\u00a0she\u00a0straightforwardly\u00a0told them: \"Eldest's wife is fine. The baby is saved. They will be back today.\"When the villagers heard this, most of them didn't voice out the disbelief in their heart.After all, Wan Chun Ju screamed louder than a pig getting slaughtered yesterday afternoon. Her face was terrible. She already fell that hard. How could the baby be okay?Everyone looked at each other and winked around. They felt Qiao Xiu Zhi love face too much, so she lied to them.Seeing them like this, Qiao Xiu Zhi became more and more annoyed. She stood up and shooed them away: \"We are going to the hospital to collect them. We don't have time to entertain you anymore!\"Everyone: \"...\"Everyone felt that they had lost face and were a little unhappy. However, they dared not say anything when they faced Qiao Xiu Zhi, who could kill more than two hundred jins of wild boar with a single punch.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't bother to care to whether they were happy or not. She called old Fifth and headed out.When they arrived at the town hospital, Qiao Zhen Guo and Wan Chun Ju were eating breakfast.Wan Chun Ju was holding a bowl of wontons in one hand, and holding a white mantou in the other hand. She wolfed them down. She couldn't be any more delighted.Qiao Zhen Guo saw his mom coming and immediately stood up: \"Mom, you are here!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at her eldest daughter-in-law and asked, \"How is your wife? What did the doctor say?\"Before Qiao Zhen Guo could answer, Wan Chun Ju rushed to speak: \"Mom, I still feel my stomach is a bit uncomfortable. Do you think I should stay in the hospital for two more days?\"When Wan Chun Ju said this, her confidence was obviously lacking.It was so comfortable to stay in the hospital. She didn't need to do housework and could eat so many delicious foods. She wanted to stay here for two more days.But before her mother-in-law spoke, her man's head shook like a rattle: \"No. Can't do! It costs five dime a day for stay in hospital and two dimes for your meal. A yuan a day isn't even enough! If you keep staying, the family will be eaten into poverty by you! Wife, it's not like\u00a0 you don\u2019t know your appetite. It is better than the pigs raised by the production team!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"\"Pff......\"Qiao Zhen Min almost choked to death on his saliva when he heard this!His eldest brother was really fearless. He dared to say anything!Qiao Xiu Zhi wasn't a harsh mother-in-law, but neither was she a foolish mother-in-law.She gave her eldest daughter-in-law a chilly gaze and said: \"Since your stomach feel uncomfortable, let the doctor come and check it. Eldest, you go and call the doctor over now!\"Wan Chun Ju shivered from her mother-in-law's gaze. Hearing this, she jumped up from the hospital bed immediately: \"Mom, I don't have any pain anymore. I don't need to see a doctor. We will be discharged now! Zhen Guo, did you hear me? Zhen Guo? Don't look for the doctor! Come back here!\"However, Qiao Zhen Guo turned a deaf ear and continued to move forward.Wan Chun Ju was so angry that she could grind silver teeth into smithereens!Seeing Qiao Zhen Guo's figure was about to step out of the ward, Qiao Xiu Zhi spoke: \"Eldest, don't go then. Come back.\"As soon as her voice sounded, Qiao Zhen Guo stopped. He immediately turned and walked back.Wan Chun Ju was half dead from anger. This dog man!If she knew he was so obedient to his mom before she got married, she wouldn't marry him even if she can't get married for the rest of her life!She\u00a0fiercely gave her man a pointed gaze.It was a pity that Qiao Zhen Guo didn't sense her resentment at all. Instead, he sighed to his wife, \"Wife, what do you have so much fart matter? Mom said lazy people have a lot of poop and pee. Wife, you are too idle!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi rolled her eyes at the ceiling.She had said this, but she never taught him to use it to headbutt his wife!Qiao Zhen Min glanced at his eldest sister-in-law. His heart was filled with sympathy again.Although Eldest Sister-in-law was often raucous, his eldest brother wasn't much better. Was this... what Mom said about what pot match what lid?Wan Chun Ju, who was angered half to death by her own man, had a black face. Not a fart sounded from her on the road!Once back in Qili Village, a few talkative women noticed Qiao Family returning and immediately surrounded them.The few people saw how upset Wan Chun Ju was and thought that she had lost her baby. So they half-sincerely and half-faked the comfort: \"Zhen Guo's wife, it doesn't matter if the baby was dropped. But the body needs to be recuperated!\"\"That's right. You are still young. As long as your body is well-nurtured, you can still have children in the future!\"\"I think the most important thing is not recuperating the body, but to drive away some unlucky person. If not, who knows if you will remain unlucky in the future?\"As soon as these words were voiced out, Wan Chun Ju jumped out of the mule cart and spat in front of the three women: \"You blacked hearted things. It's your baby that was dropped. It's your whole family's baby that wasn't dropped!\"\"Also, old Third Cai's wife, if you dare to say I'm unlucky one more time, see if I won't smear your face with chicken poo!\"Wan Chun Ju's chest was stifled with angry due to her man. Now these women ran into her. How could she not chew them out?The three women's faces were slobbered with spit. Their faces turned red and white. Extremely exasperated!Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't want to let them go so easily: \"I don't care what you say behind our back, but it's best not to let me hear it, otherwise...\"Otherwise what, she didn't continue. Just made a fist at the three of them.The three women's faces turned white with a \"swish\". Their legs trembled as their voices trembled: \"I, I...I have something to do. I'll leave first!\"\"I... have something to do too. I have to go too!\"\"Wait for me!\"In less than half a minute, the three of them ran out of their sight. As if a ghost was chasing them from behind.Qiao Zhen Guo looked at his mom with admiration. He turned around and said to his wife: \"Wife, don't act up anymore when you go back, otherwise Mom's fist will fall on you!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Why did she get pulled in out of nowhere again?Back at Qiao's old house, An Ping was the first to rush out: \"Mom, you are finally back! How is the little sister in the belly?\"\"Son, it's a younger brother in my belly. Not a younger sister. Don't make this mistake in the future!\"After getting attacked by her man, Wan Chun Ju received another stab from by her son!If these words were said by Qiao Dong He and Qiao Dong Ying, she would definitely slap them. However, it was her precious golden egg who had said it. She could to let it go!An Ping couldn't understand his mom's eagerness to lay a golden egg and muttered: \"But I feel like it's a little sister in your belly.\"Without waiting for Wan Chun Ju to persuade her son, the mud covered Qiao Zhen Guo parked the mule cart and happened to walked in to hear this. So he spoke: \"Wife, I think An Ping may be right. Mother-in-law has given birth to five daughters. Your three sisters have given birth to four daughters. So your belly should also be a daughter.\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Qiao Zhen Guo continued: \"Wife, you said last time that your maternal family inherited big butt and good birthing capability from your ancestors. I think you're wrong. Your maternal family inherited daughter-birthing capability!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"If this was spread out, who would dare to marry Wan Family's daughter in the future?Wan Chun Ju didn't feel her belly hurts at first, but when she heard her man's words, she instantly felt her belly hurt again....The news that Wan Chun Ju hadn't miscarried soon spread throughout Qili Village. Everyone was shocked when they heard about it.But in this way, the rumors about Da Qiao's bad luck have been diluted a lot.Fang Xiao Juan felt dissatisfied when she found out: \"God is really blind. To actually not make Qiao Family completely misfortunate!\"Xiao Qiao sat at side. Her face solemn.Now, she became more and more sure that Da Qiao had a luck-snatching system. Why else would Wan Chun Ju be fine after such fall?She decided to find a time to meet Da Qiao again!That evening, Qiao Zhen Min came in from outside with a strange expression on his face: \"Do you know who I saw outside just now?\"Chen Qiao Qiao asked: \"Who did you see?\"\"I saw Fang Xiao Juan!\"Chen Qiao Qiao glanced at him: \"So what if you saw her. What's so strange about it?\"After all, they were in the same village. It wasn't surprising to run into her.Qiao Zhen Min said: \"It's naturally not surprising to see her. But what's surprising is that I saw her coming out of Wang's house with Xiao Qiao!\"What he didn't say was that Fang Xiao Juan had a proud face at the time, while Wang Family behind her looked like they lost their parent.Wang Xin Sheng was gnashing his teeth. If it weren't for being held back by his eldest brother, Wang Shui Sheng, he would go up and beat Fang Xiao Juan!He was very curious. What exactly did that woman do? She dared to provoke that miserly hooligan, Wang Xin Sheng! Also, why did Wang Family dare not say anything despite being furious?Chen Qiao Qiao didn't like Fang Xiao Juan. Nor was she interested in her. However, she was very concerned about Xiao Qiao: \"Say, Zhen Min, do you think Mom would really not let Xiao Qiao come back in the future?\"She liked that kid Xiao Qiao so much!When she came back this time, she had secretly brought her a gift. Unfortunately, she never had a chance to see her!Qiao Zhen Min stared up at his wife and said calmly: \"Since Mom has let out the words, it means that there is no room for turning around on this matter. You'd better leave this matter alone, understand?\"Although Chen Qiao Qiao was very proud, she listened to her man very much.So even though she held some regrets in her heart, she still agreed: \"Don't worry. I won't get involved.\"Compared with his eldest sister-in-law, Qiao Zhen Min felt his wife was more reliable. Since she had made a promise, she will not pretend to obey....At this moment, the door of Wang Family's Hall was closed tightly. The children were all driven out.The atmosphere in the room was very heavy.Old Mister Wang heavily knocked the dry tobacco rod in his hand on the wooden table and angrily boomed: \"You bastard, kneel down!\"Even old Madam Wang, who heavily doted him, dared not open her mouth to plead for him at this moment.Besides, youngest son had gone overboard on this matter. If it wasn't handled properly, the entire Wang Family will go down with him!Wang Xin Sheng knelt down with a straightened neck. He gritted his teeth and uttered, \"I will handle this by myself. You don't have to worry about it!\"Living to this age, it was the first time that Wang Xin Sheng had been threatened by a woman!He couldn't swallow it anyway!Today Fang Xiao Juan came knocking with Xiao Qiao in tow. Everyone in Wang Family was shocked.After all, Wang family didn't have much interaction with Fang family and didn't have much contact with Fang Xiao Juan.Unexpectedly, Fang Xiao Juan soon dropped a bomb, blasting the entire Wang Family into a daze!Fang Xiao Juan was pregnant!She was pregnant with Wang Xin Sheng's baby!She said that if Wang Xin Sheng refused to marry her, she would go to the police station to report him for taking liberties with woman. At that time, how Wang Family end up will have nothing to do with her!After the initial shock, Wang Family recovered and stared at Fang Xiao Juan with gritted teeth!No one liked to be threatened. Especially when the whole family's life was being gripped!However, they dare not to touch Fang Xiao Juan at this time. They didn't even dare to say harsh words!Old Mister Wang's lips trembled with anger: \"You handle it? How will you handle it? Kill that Fang Xiao Juan and get arrested and shot. Then let the entire Wang Family be unable to lift their heads from now on?\"Although Wang Xin Sheng was carefree, he wasn't completely heartless.He didn't have care about his own life and death, but he can't remain indifferent if his whole family had to accompany him in suffering!Still, he couldn't swallow this breath: \"If not? You can't possibly let me marry that woman, right?\"\"If you don't want to marry, why did you sleep with her back then? In the end, it was you who acted so contemptible!\"Normally, old Mister Wang doted his youngest son. But now this happened. Only now he realized that this youngest son was spoiled bad by them and he almost implicated the entire Wang Family!The more he thought about, the more furious he was. He stepped forward and kicked him hard.Old Madam Wang was so distressed that she ran over to hold her youngest son and scolded her old spouse: \"What are you doing? Just speak properly, Do you want to kick him to death?\"Old Mister Wang said with a sunken expression: \"At this time you are still protecting him. Have you ever thought that this child has spoiled bad by you!\"Sitting in the corner, Liu Cui Hua internally sneered.Her father-in-law's words was simply someone who laughed one hundred steps of the fifty steps!This youngest brother-in-law developed into such a lazy character was all thanks the two elders' doting, no?She had always wondered why youngest brother-in-law beat up favus-riddled Gou Sheng. Now everything was clear.It turned out that he got involved with Fang Xiao Juan long ago!But why was he so blind?There were so many women in the world and he happened to set his eyes on that woman!If that woman was allowed to marry in, it seems Wang Family will be in unrest from now on!Actually Wang Xin Sheng liked Fang Xiao Juan from a long time ago, but Fang Xiao Juan didn't fancy him. He had this block in his heart so long.So when Fang Xiao Juan suddenly threw an olive branch to him after the divorce, he caught it without a second thought.At first he was enthralled with Fang Xiao Juan. After all, she was the goddess he was infatuated with for so many years. But only after sleeping her, did he found out there was nothing special.Later, when she was fed chicken poop by Lin Family and then peed on her face by a wild boar, he completely lost interest in her!He didn't expect Fang Xiao Juan to get pregnant, let alone daring to run to his house to threaten him!The b*tch need a lesson!With old Madam Wang's protective, old Mister Wang couldn't beat him even if he wanted to. He took a few breaths and said, \"Eldest, what do you think we should do about this?\"Wang Shui Sheng's expression was sunken throughout it all. At this moment, he was called by his dad. Only then, he spoke, \"Before spring ploughing, get a matchmaker go to over to ask for marriage.\"What else can they do except marry in that woman?Can they sit and watch old Fifth getting gun execution?Besides, Wang Family hadn't split yet. Everyone was a grasshopper on the same line. If old Fifth gets shot for taking liberty with woman, can Wang Family still raise their heads in the future?\"I won't marry!\"Wang Xin Sheng still refused. If Fang Xiao Juan notified him in private, he might agree to marry her.But now, he was marrying with his head pressed. He couldn't swallow that breath!Wang Shui Sheng scolded in a heavy tone: \"Even if you don't want to marry, you have to marry. If not, ram your head against the wall now and here!\"This was the first time that Wang Shui Sheng had exploded like this.Although old Madam Wang was angry that he spoke so heavily to his younger brother, she did not dare to scold her eldest son.If Wang Xin Sheng had the courage to die, he wouldn't become the way he was now.So the matter was settled like this.When the Spring Festival was over, Wang Family got the matchmaker to go to Fang's house to ask for hand of marriage.On the way back, Xiao Qiao's brows was always frowning: \"Mom, you shouldn't have said those words to Wang Family just now!\"Recalling Wang Family gnashing their teeth and glaring at the mother and daughter, her heart was very upset.Before leaving, she told her mom to not act aloof. Despite agreeing, her mom treated her words as fart with a turn of a head!Fang Xiao Juan appeared carefree: \"Jiao Jiao'er, don't worry. Everyone in Wang family is greedy for life and fear of death. They dare not resist!\"This wasn't a question of resisting or not resisting at all!Xiao Qiao was so irritable that she wanted to scold her mom!She told her mom to marry Wang Xin Sheng with the thought of living life properly and join Wang Xin Sheng in eating well and drinking heartily in the future. Not turning it to this current situation!However, Fang Xiao Juan didn't listen to her daughter this time.Although she doted Xiao Qiao, Xiao Qiao was only a seven-year-old child in her mind despite her cleverness. What can she understand?The mother and daughter couldn't persuade each other and got into conflict for the first time....The next day was the second day of the New Year. It was the day to return to one's maternal family.At Qiao's house, today was the day to wait for the married out sisters to come back. Qiao Family's daughters-in-law will return to their maternal home on the third day of the New Year.Qiao Xiu Zhi got up early in the morning and waited for a long time. None of the two daughters came back.Wan Chun Jju spat out the pumpkin seeds and said: \"It's almost noon and still haven't even seen a shadow of the two sisters. It can't be that they won't come back?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced outside the door. A worried look flashed through her eyes.Xue Chuan comforted his wife and said: \"Nothing will happen. Maybe something delayed them.\"Xue Chuan's complexion was much better than before. Qiao Xiu Zhi's expression relaxed a bit when she saw him like this: \"Hong Xia come back very early in the previous years. I'm just worried about what something happening to her.\"Out of the two daughters, Hong Xia's temper was partly similar to hers. Once lit, it burn.But she didn't seem to inherit the essence. Such a hot-tempered girl often swallowed her anger at her husband's house and turned into a meat bun!Hong Mei was cold-hearted by nature. Despite having so many people in her family, she wasn't close to anyone. But the more selfish people were, the more they will plan for themselves. So she never worried about Hong Mei.Looking at her in-law's sticky and greasy display at an age, Wan Chun Ju felt that her teeth were going to be sour!Her eyes spun and land on the opposite side, Chen Qiao Qiao's little butt: \"Fifth Sister-in-law, can you help me pour a glass of water? Originally, I shouldn't trouble you over such little matter. You know that I\u2019m pregnant. I'm afraid that I would accidentally fall down again. So I have to trouble you.\"Though she she said trouble, she wasn't polite at all. She handed the old porcelain bowl directly to Chen Qiao Qiao and deliberately imitate her usual attitude. Looking at her with her chin held high.Chen Qiao Qiao gritted her teeth with anger!She really didn't expect big butt Wan Chun Ju to be so lucky. Pretending to be pregnant and the act became true!Suddenly, her eyes flashed. She stood up and took the old porcelain bowl in Wan Chun Ju's hand and smilingly said: \"Then wait a bit, Eldest Sister-in-law. I will pour a bowl of water for you!\"Wan Chun Ju was taken aback. Instinct told her that little butt Chen Qiao Qiao was planning something. But she couldn't guess what the other party wanted to do.Chen Qiao Qiao turned and went to the stove. After pouring the water, she spat out a mouthful of saliva into the bowl!Want to drink the water she poured?Then let her drink enough!When she returned with water, Chen Qiao Qiao still displayed a good temper. This made alarm bells ring in Wan Chun Ju's heart.Chen Qiao Qiao: \"Didn't Eldest Sister-in-law want to drink water? Why don't you drink it now?\"Wan Chun Ju looked at her suspiciously: \"Fifth Sister-in-law, it can't be that you spit into the water?\"Because she herself had done this to Chen Qiao Qiao, she suspected it was neighbor who stole the axe. Looking at the other party now, she had a feeling that the other party had did the same thing as herself.Chen Qiao Qiao paused. Her expression slightly stiffened and responded, \"Eldest Sister-in-law what nonsense are you saying! How could I do such a wicked thing!\"Wan Chun Ju didn't believe her and passed the old porcelain bowl over: \"Then take a sip and show me!\"Chen Qiao Qiao gritted his teeth again!Wasn\u2019t it say that once pregnant, become silly for three years?How come this big butt Wan Chun Ju became smarter after she became pregnant?Just when the two were deadlocked, there was a loud noise outside: \"Mom, Mom, I'm back!\"\"Grandma, here we are!\"With the arrival of the noise, Qiao Hong Mei's figure appeared at the gate of old Qiao's old courtyard.In this era, girl normally became a member of her in-laws' family after marrying and rarely returned to her maternal family when she had nothing to do. So on the second day of the new year, even the poorest people will return to their maternal family with big bags and small bags.Qiao Hong Mei came back with her four daughters. She only brought a pack of shriveled snacks. The snacks looked like they had been left out for a long time.Wan Chun Ju couldn't help but curl her lips when she saw what she was holding in her hand.Seeing this fourth sister, Qiao Hong Mei, Chen Qiao Qiao suddenly felt that Wan Chun Ju wasn't that annoying.Qiao Hong Mei had never been one to suffer a loss. When she saw the expressions on her sisters-in-law's face, she coldly snorted: \"What's wrong with Eldest Sister-in-law and Qiao Qiao? Looking at me with a black face. It can't be that you don't welcome me back?\"Being called in front of her mother-in-law, Wan Chun Ju and Chen Qiao Qiao's faces became even more ugly.Unexpectedly, before they even speak out, they heard their mother-in-law saying, \"Hong Mei, if you don't like coming back to your maternal house, then don't come back. If you want to come back, then give me peace of mind!\"Qiao Hong Mei's face flushed red: \"Mom, how can you say that to your daughter? Sometimes I really wonder if I am birthed by you and Father!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi sneered: \"What a coincidence. I'm quite skeptical too!\"Qiao Hong Mei: \"...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She felt angry and hatred: \"Mom!\"Chen Qiao Qiao suppressed a grin. Internally, she thought that it was useless to call Empress Dowager at this time!Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan have adopted a free range attitude towards the discipline of the children from childhood until adults.As long as they didn't commit crimes and lazy bum that drag others down, the husband and wife will basically not govern them.However, Qiao Hong Mei was an odd one.Since she was a petty child. The whole family was living their life, while she persisted on stirring up palace drama everywhere. Like she can only be happy when there was no peace at home!She and Xue Chuan found out and gave her a severe lesson. Only then, she constrained herself a lot. Still, Hong Mei was like a tree with a crooked neck. Crooked all the way through and couldn't be twisted straight.Take Second as an example.Before Qiao Zhen Jun was paralyzed, Qiao Hong Mei often got him to make furniture for her. Qiao Zhen Jun was embarrassed to ask his sister for money, so he had to pay for the cost by himself. For this, Fang Xiao Juan often argued with him.After she and Xue Chuan knew about it, they didn't say anything.But Qiao Zhen Jun had been paralyzed until now and Qiao Hong Mei had never came back to visit. Let alone get someone to send something back!One can't be too selfish. One can't be too Qiao Hong Mei!The atmosphere was awkward.At this moment, a babyish voice came from the door: \"Grandmother, Grandfather, your little cutie is here again!\"As soon as the voice fell, a red bundled, little dumpling Da Qiao swung her short legs and appeared at the door.There were two small buns tied on her head, which looked like two small balls hanging on her head from a distance. They trembled and shook as she walked. So cute.The straight-faced Qiao Xiu Zhi immediately blossomed as soon as she heard the little dumpling's baby voice. The corner of her mouth release a hint of happiness. This made Qiao Hong Mei dumbfounded from watching.She can't wait to turn around, wanting to see who was capable of this.But when she saw Da Qiao, she was stunned.The little girl walking towards them was wearing a little red cotton-padded jacket. Her small face was flushed, her lips were red, and her teeth were white. Her big black grape-like eyes were bright and energetic. Very beautiful.She felt that the little girl was familiar, but she couldn't remember where she had seen her for a while: \"Mom, whose child is this little girl? Why is she calling you and Dad that way?\"Wan Chun Ju glanced at her strangely: \"Hong Mei, your eyes okay? Don't you recognize Da Qiao?\"Qiao Hong Mei got choked to death: \"...\"She can be blamed for this?The little girl in front of her was fair and tender. Where was sallow faced, yellow haired stutterer?When Chen Qiao Qiao heard this, she couldn't help but glance at Wan Chun Ju.Can't blame Qiao Hong Mei for not recognizing Da Qiao. She hadn't been back to Qiao's house for more than half a year. Da Qiao's changes during this time were very huge.Even Qiao Family who saw her every day spent every day in amazement during this time.Although Da Qiao gave the jade bead water to Qiao Family to drink, there was limited quantity. The amount they consumed was far less than Da Qiao. On top of that, it was unknown if the jade beads can recognized Da Qiao as master, so the effect on her was much bigger than the others.So during this period of time, Qiao Family and villagers in Qili Village \"opened their eyes\" and watched Da Qiao transform from an inconspicuous little stutter into a powdered-jade little dumpling.What made everyone even more surprised was that Da Qiao's stuttering was completely cured!Many children stuttered when they were young, but gradually disappeared after they grew up. However, Da Qiao\u2019s condition was very serious. Everyone thought that she would be stuttering all her life, but suddenly it got be better!The villagers in Qili Village inquired with Qiao Family. But the problem was that Qiao Family didn't know why Da Qiao's stutter stopped all of a sudden. And became so pretty!Some people secretly said that Fang Xiao Juan was actually the person who was the calamity.Look. As soon as she left, the pear trees in Qiao's small yard bloomed. The old hen laid eggs. And Da Qiao stopped stuttering!On the other hand, during this period of time, the chicken flew and dog jumped at Fang's house.First, they was beaten by Lin Family. Then received by Qiao Xiu Zhi's. Finally, they got chased by a wild boar. Fang Fu Gui still can't get out of bed. All this started when Fang Xiao Juan returned to Fang's house!Fang Xiao Juan was so angry that she almost miscarried when she heard these rumors!When Da Qiao walked in, she saw Fourth Paternal Aunt and shrank her neck as she greeted, \"Fourth Paternal Aunt.\"She remembered that this paternal aunt didn't like her. She kept her face straight when she saw her.Qiao Hong Mei disliked Da Qiao. Partly because she was influenced by Fang Xiao Juan and felt that she was a natural born calamity to all her relatives. And also partly because she herself did not like girls!She gave birth to four daughters in a row. So she found girls an eyesore. She didn't like the smart Xiao Qiao too.Qiao Hong Mei stared at Da Qiao. Her eyes almost popped out of her sockets: \"Are you really Da Qiao? Why are you suddenly completely different? And you don't seem to stammer anymore? What is going on?\"She reached out and grabbed Da Qiao's hand. She was very heavy-handed as Da Qiao's hand immediately reddened.Da Qiao frowned in pain. She struggled hard but couldn't break free.A slap rang out!Qiao Xiu Zhi stepped forward and patted Qiao Hong Mei's hand: \"Let go! Such a grown adult and still can't control your strength. Didn't you see the child's hand was grabbed red by you?\"Qiao Hong Mei let go with an \"Ouch\".Seeing a big red mark on the back of her hand, she became more furious: \"Mom, just say it. Why hit me?\"From the time she walked in, her mom had been going against her. Was she treating her as her own daughter?Qiao Hong Mei felt hate and felt wronged in her heart!Da Qiao immediately ran over to hug her grandmother's thigh. She raised her head and said softly: \"Grandmother, I came over to give you and grandfather eggs. Gu Gu laid eggs again!\"A smile appeared on Qiao Xiu Zhi's face: \"You can eat it yourself. The old hen in the family lays eggs every day. You don't need to bring it here!\"Little dumpling, Da Qiao shook her head. The little buns on her head shook: \"I just want to give to Grandfather and Grandmother to eat. After eating, become healthy!\"Although the old hens in the Qiao's old house laid eggs, there ware too many people in Qiao's old house. The eggs weren't enough. On the contrary, the father and daughter in Qiao's small house often can't finish their eggs.Qiao Xiu Zhi took in the child's thoughtfulness and smiled deeper. She stretched out her hand to rub her little buns: \"Then take it in and give it to your grandfather to store it. Your grandfather saved a candy for you. Go in!\"Little dumpling Da Qiao\u2019s eyes brightened instantly. She swallowed the saliva in her small mouth and replied, \"Grandmother and Grandfather are wonderful. Da Qiao likes Grandfather and Grandmother the most!\"Flattery!Wan Chun Ju stood behind and rolled her eyes.During this time, Da Qiao had not only changed a lot in appearance, but also in her personality.That little mouth was like smeared with honey. Coaxing her parent-in-laws until they almost took out their hearts to give her!Chen Qiao Qiao didn't feel much about her parents-in-law doting Da Qiao. Although she liked Xiao Qiao, she did not hate Da Qiao because of it.In her eyes, Da Qiao was the same as the other family members.The same as in getting ignored.When Qiao Hong Mei saw that her mom ignored her existence, but was so kind to the unlucky ghost, Da Qiao, her eyes instantly hid daggers inside!Qiao Hong Mei had arrived for a while and Xue Chuan had never came out. Hearing Da Qiao's voice at this moment, he immediately appeared: \"Da Qiao, have you come to see Grandfather?\"Little dumpling Da Qiao swung her short legs and ran over: \"Grandfather, I haven't seen you and Grandmother for one night. I miss you so much!\"Xue Chuan laughed. The expression on his face softened: \"Grandfather and Grandmother miss you too. It's cold outside. Come in.\"Little dumpling Da Qiao touched the padded jacket on her body as her eyes became crescent from happiness: \"It's not cold. The clothes made by Grandfather are warm!\"Qiao Hong Mei felt even more uncomfortable when she heard that her dad made the clothes on her!\"At home, weren't you always missing your grandma and grandpa? Why do you all act like mute now that you see them? Well, hurry up. If you can make your grandma and grandpa happy, maybe you will also get a new clothes each!\"She took in how her four daughters stood at the side like quail. All dressed in gray. Completely incomparable to Da Qiao. It was enough that they can't compare in looks, even their mouths were incomparable. Her angered flared up even more!Wan Chun Ju snorted when she heard these words, \"Hong Mei, you don\u2019t look good, but you can think very prettily! Your daughter isn't part of Qiao Family. Even Dad and Mom are rich and got nowhere to spend it, they still won\u2019t make clothes for them!\"Dreaming too beautifully!Neither of her daughters wore new clothes. A married daughter still wanted new clothes?Not to mention her daughter, there was none for An Ping, the only grandson of Qiao Family!Chen Qiao Qiao couldn't help but glanced at Wan Chun Ju again.Don't know if it was her imagination, she kept getting the feeling that Wan Chun Ju's angering people to death skill seems to be more and more like Eldest Brother.Qiao Hong Mei was was close to exploding: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, do you have to begrudging with me at every turn like this?\"Wan Chun Ju curled her lips: \"I'm telling the truth.\"Speak such shameless words and not letting people talk about her?Why? Because of her big pie face?Qiao Xiu Zhi said indifferently: \"Everyone go in.\"Once again, Qiao Hong Mei was ignored by her own mom. She was so angry that she almost vomited blood on the spot!...At noon, Qiao Hong Xia was still nowhere to be seen.Qiao Hong Mei was the first to complain: \"What's with Third Sister? If she isn't coming back, don't she know to get someone to pass a word? Everyone is waiting for her!\"She said this, but no one agreed with her.Qiao Hong Mei gritted her teeth with anger, stretched out her hand, and secretly pinched her eldest daughter, Chen Zhao Di: \"Zhao Di, didn't you say you are hungry? Then quickly beg your grandma. Get your grandma to make a big pot of meat for you to eat!\"Qiao Hong Mei gave birth to four daughters in a row; named Chen Zhao Di, Chen Lai Di, Chen Qiu Di, and Chen Huan Di.Qiao Hong Mei gave birth to four daughters in a row; named Chen Zhao Di, Chen Lai Di, Chen Qiu Di, and Chen Huan Di. The girls were only one year apart. The eldest Chen Zhao Di was eight years old this year, one year older than Da Qiao.Chen Zhao Di wasn't good-looking. She had an honest personality that doesn't know to how to butter up people. She didn't receive Qiao Hong Mei's like. She and Da Qiao were in the same boat.Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan found this child pitiful and would look after her a little bit more than often when they came here. However, Qiao Hong Mei would take advantage of this. She used Chen Zhao Di every time to get benefits. This made Qiao Xiu Zhi dislike her even more.With unsettledness on her face, Chen Zhao Di whispered: \"Grandma, I...I want to eat meat.\"If she didn't do what her mom said, it would be a rolling pin waiting for her when they got back.Qiao Xiu Zhi stood up with a cold face: \"Old fifth's wife, you come and help me today.\"Qiao Hong Mei paid no heed to her mom's expression. As long as she achieved her goal, it was fine: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, as the eldest daughter-in-law, Mom didn't call you to do things, but Qiao Qiao instead. Did you offend Mom?\"Wan Chun Ju spat out the pumpkin shell with a \"pah\": \"What do you know! This is Mom doting me. Aren't I pregnant? Mom doesn't want me to work so hard, so she didn't let me do anything!\"Qiao Hong Mei was taken aback. Her eyes fell on her belly: \" Eldest Sister-in-law, are you pregnant again?\"She gave birth to four daughters in a row, so naturally she wanted to fight for a son. But since her fourth child, she had never been pregnant again.Wan Chun Ju rubbed her belly proudly: \"Of course. I'm pretty sure this child is a son again!\"Qiao Hong Mei's eyes went red with jealousy.Taking in her reaction, Wan Chun Ju became even more proud: \"Hong Mei, you have to hurry up. You are not young anymore. In a few years, you'll be an old yellow pearl. You will not be able to give birth even when you want to give!\"Qiao Hong Mei: \"...\"After the New Year, she was only twenty-six years old. In a few years, she still won't be at the stage of being an old yellow pearl!Although Wan Chun Ju was very annoying in the past, she had never targeted her at every corner like today!And what was going on with her stinky mouth? Why did it feel like she received a blessing and the words that came out almost choked people to death!...Da Qiao and the four Chen sisters were playing eagle catch chicks game outside.(Cute.\u00a0Last bit looks like how the game is played.)Da Qiao played the hen and Chen Zhao Di played the eagle. The few of them laughed and screamed. Having a great time.The second child, Chen Lai Di was the same age as Da Qiao. Since seeing Da Qiao wearing new clothes, her eyes had not left Da Qiao's body.At this moment, she played the role of a little chick hiding behind Da Qiao. While running, she spoke: \"Da Qiao, your new clothes are so beautiful!\"Da Qiao revealed a mouthful of small shell teeth and smiled until her eyes were crescent: \"Grandfather made it for me. It's embroidered with white rabbit and Gu Gu!\"Naturally Chen Lai Di noticed and was completely envious in her heart.As the second child in the family, her clothes were all old clothes from her elder sister. She had never worn such beautiful clothes: \"Da Qiao, can you lend me your clothes to wear?\"While avoiding Chen Zhao Di, Da Qiao refused and said, \"No. Grandfather made this for me. I can't lend it to you to wear!\"She couldn't even bear to let Xia Qiao wear it. What's to this cousin sister, whom she had no feelings for.Chen Lai Di gritted her teeth with fury and pulled her clothes hard while she verbally pleaded: \"Good Da Qiao, just for a bit. Lend it to me to wear!\"Da Qiao stopped abruptly due to worrying about her clothes getting torn by her.Chen Lai Di didn't expect that she would stop suddenly. The feet under her couldn't stand firmly and fell forward with inertia. Instantly she flat on the ground.Her chin had knocked against ground fiercely. Her lips and chin were all scratched. The skin of both palms were also bleeding. Immediately, she cried out with a \"WAA\".Qiao Hong Mei ran out when she heard the cry. She saw the blood on her second daughter's face and her face instantly became dark: \"Why do you fall so hard? What if you get scars? How can you marry in the future?\"While crying, Chen Lai Di's eyes spun around: \"Mom, it's Da Qiao. Da Qiao pushed me!\"Qiao Hong Mei didn't care about her second daughter. She turned around and targeted Da Qiao: \"You black-hearted thing, why are you so vicious in your young age?\"Da Qiao's face flushed red: \"You lied. I didn't push you!\"Chen Lai Di rolled on the ground: \"It's you! It's you who pushed me!\"Qiao Hong Mei had been repressing the fire within her ever since she arrived. She was already very uncomfortable when she saw Da Qiao wearing new clothes. At this moment, she heard what her second daughter said,\u00a0she made up her mind to teach Da Qiao a lesson no matter if it was true or false!She raised her hand to slap Da Qiao.At this moment, a piece of dry wood flew over behind her!With a \"bang\", the dry wood heavily hit her back!Qiao Hong Mei's back received this attack and she cried out with an \"Ouch\". The pain made her almost spit out a mouthful of blood!Before she could look back to see who hit her with a dry wood, she heard her mom's voice booming from behind: \"Qiao Hong Mei, take your daughters and scram out of Qiao's house now!\"Qiao Hong Mei's face went from red and white. She was closed to tears: \"Mom, Da Qiao is your granddaughter. Them I'm not your daughter? And Zhao Di sisters aren't your granddaughters? You can't be so biased!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi came over and pulled Da Qiao behind her. She coldly responded: \"Human hearts are always biased. If you think I am biased, then don't come back!\"Qiao Hong Mei was so mad that she grinded her teeth. She said bitterly: \"Alright! You said this yourself. Don't beg me to come back in the future!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi coldly watched her. No one else in Qiao Family said anything to keep her. Qiao Hong Mei almost vomited blood from anger.Turning to her eldest daughter, who had a scared expression, she swung her hand and slapped her: \"Useless thing. How do you act as the eldest sister? Didn't I tell you to take good care of your sisters before going out?\"A bright red palm print appeared on Chen Zhao Di's slightly dark face. The tears fell from her eyes but she did not dare to cry like Second Younger Sister. She only dared to cry silently.Qiao Hong Mei kicked her second daughter and shrieked: \"Still not getting up. People don't welcome us. Do you want to stay here to make people disdain us more?\"Chen Lai Di received a kick from her mom and cried louder.Chen Qiu Di and Chen Huan Di saw that their two elder sisters were crying. They were so scared that they started crying.So the group of five left Qiao's house with four crying. They immediately attracted the attention of others.Gossipers immediately surrounded them.\"Isn't this Hong Mei? Why are you leaving when just you came back?\"\"These are your daughters, right? Why are they all crying? What happened?\"Qiao Hong Mei put on an aggrieved expression: \"My second daughter was pushed down by Da Qiao. How can I feel distress as the mom? I just said a few words to her and my mom can't stand it. She kicked us mother and daughters out. My heart feel cold. It's completely broken!\"\"Why is it Da Qiao again? Every incident got to do with her!\"\"Isn't that right! That the kid is really spooky!\"All the way back,\u00a0Qiao Hong Mei sang about Da Qiao. When she walked out of Qili Village, the anger in her heart was mostly vented.After leaving Qili Village, there was a small forest. The entrance of the small forest was covered with half-person-high weeds and bushes. The branches were densely packed. Most people dared not freely enter it.When the mother and daughters passed the entrance, there was a sudden noise from the wild grass.With sharp eyes, Chen Lai Di caught sight of a gray rabbit running over: \"Mom, it's a rabbit. What a big rabbit!\"Qiao Hong Mei noticed it too. She was very excited!Without even thinking about it, she made a chase.Such a fat rabbit. If it can be caught, there will be no shortage of meat this new year!She followed and pushed aside the weeds. However, the rabbit was nowhere to be seen.The next moment, she heard a \"buzzing\" sound from far as well as near.When she looked up, the black and dense cluster looked very scary.What was it?Soon she knew.That was a group of Asian tiger mosquitoes!The scientific name of the mosquito was Aedes albopictus. It was a very aggressive mosquito and a media that spreads viruses.Qiao Hong Mei's face turned pale when she saw so many mosquitoes flying towards her!She turned around and wanted to run. How could she have time to escape?\"Ahhhhhh...Aiya...Aiya... Someone save me now...\"Chen Zhao Di sisters were scared silly!The four sisters opened their mouths wide as they dazedly watched their mom jump and scream. Screamed like a pig getting slaughtered.Chen Lai Di came back to her senses first and pushed her elder sister: \"Elder Sister, go and save Mom!\"Chen Zhao Di was very scared. But at the thought that if she go over to rescue her mom, her mom would definitely think she was the most filial later. Maybe she wouldn't scold her again in the future!Chen Zhao Di gritted her teeth and rushed in. Soon there was another scream in the grove.A few hours later, Chen Xing saw his wife and eldest daughter come back with their faces covered with buns. He couldn't help but be stunned: \"What happened to you?\"Qiao Hong Mei felt itchy and painful. She gritted her teeth and answered, \"We were bitten by mosquitoes.\"Chen Xing didn't take it seriously when he heard that they was bitten by mosquitoes: \"Did you borrow the money?\"The state-run restaurant wanted to raise funds to build properties. Chen Family wanted to get a hand on two-room house. Although the money in hand was enough, daily living will definitely be on a tightrope if all was taken out. So after they discussed it, they decided to get Qiao Hong Mei return to her maternal home to borrow money.Qiao Hong Mei's mind buzzed and then remembered her purpose of returning to her maternal home this time.She originally planned to go back and borrow a few hundred yuan from her mom. Unexpectedly, she was angered by Wan Chun Ju and Da Qiao. Afterward, she completely forgot about it.When Chen Xing saw this reaction of hers, his face was immediately pulled down: \"What? Didn't you get the money?\"Qiao Hong Mei shook her head.Chen Xing's voice suddenly raised: \"You didn't borrow a penny back? Didn't you say that your mom would definitely lend you money? Didn't you say that you are favored at home? Why can't you get back a penny now? \"Qiao Hong Mei didn't dare to let out half a fart.At the beginning, she insisted on getting two hundred yuan as a dowry from home in order to marry Chen Xing. She had also lied to Chen Xing, saying that she was the most favored daughter in the family. It was because of this, Chen Xing agreed to marry her.\"Useless rubbish!\"Chen Xing slammed the enamel jar to the ground. He flung his sleeves and departed.Qiao Hong Mei hurried to catch up, but Chen Xing was nowhere to be found when she chased out to the compound. Instead, everyone saw her swollen face. Her face was flushed with agitation.Qiao Family wasn't upset because of Qiao Hong Mei's departure. Instead, the atmosphere became more comfortable.Only Da Qiao was a little worried: \"Grandfather, Grandmother, did I mess things up again?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi asked her: \"Did you push Lai Di down?\"Da Qiao shook her head: \"No. She didn't stand firmly and fell down.\"\"Since you didn't push her, then this matter has nothing to do with you!\" Qiao Xiu Zhi stated, \"You must remember, there are many people in this world who do wrong but don't want to admit it. When you meet this kind of person, you have to stay away from them. If they push the matter to you, you don't have to be afraid. Go up and beat them until they are looking for their teeth all over the floor when necessary. That way, they won't dare to mess with you!\"Qiao Zhen Jun: \"...\"Was it really good for his mom to teach Da Qiao like that?Da Qiao tilted her little head and turned her head to look at her grandfather.Xue Chuan rubbed her little head and said, \"What your grandmother said is correct.\"Everyone: \"...\"Dog food really appeared all the time.Da Qiao\u2019s long eyelashes fluttered like two small fans: \"Just like how Grandmother used a dry wood to beat Fourth Aunt?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded: \"That's right. If anyone dares to bully you, beat them fiercely. Don't persuade with words. Just go up and do it!\"Little dumpling Da Qiao patted her chest and declared in her babyish voice, \"Okay. Whoever dares to bully me in the future, I will slap them fiercely!\"Qiao Zhen Jun: \"...\"He seemed to see his delicate and soft daughter was gone forever.Qiao Hong Xia didn't come to her maternal family even at sunset.Qiao Xiu Zhi was a little worried. So she got Qiao Zhen Guo and Qiao Zhen Min to go to the neighboring production team.The two brothers didn't rush back until dark. They brought back news: Zhao Yi Ming was hospitalized with a fever and Qiao Hong Xia had went to the town hospital to take care of her son. She hadn't been home for a few days.Qiao Xiu Zhi frowned: \"It's been a few days. Why didn't she let someone come home and say something?\"Qiao Zhen Min shook his head: \"I'm afraid it was Zhao Family who retrained her and prevent her from coming home to tell. Eldest Brother and I will go to town tomorrow.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi pondered for a while and said: \"Okay. You guys bring some eggs over tomorrow. If there's any matter,\u00a0immediately\u00a0come home and say something.\"The next day, the two Qiao brothers went to the production team leader's house to get a letter of introduction and hurried to the town hospital.They thought that their nephew was feverish at most. But when they entered the ward, they saw their nephew lying like dead on the bed and Qiao Hong Xia almost sobbing to death.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQiao Zhen Min's face immediately sank: \"Third Sister, what happened? How did my nephew end up like this?\"Originally, Qiao Hong Xia suppressed her sobs to quieter tone. But now that she saw her family coming over, she couldn't help cry even more loudly.Qiao Zhen Guo had always been stupid at talking. He didn't know how to comfort people. Seeing Third Younger Sister cry like this, he was as anxious as ants in heated pan: \"Third Younger Sister, don't cry. Just say what happened!\"As soon as the voice fell, the door of the ward was pushed open again. Old Second Zhao and his wife walked in. They were merrily talking away.Seeing the two Qiao brothers, the faces of the couple instantly changed.Damn, why did Qiao Family come here?Didn\u2019t they tell them yesterday that Zhao Yi Ming just had a normal fever? What did they specially came here for?Qiao Hong Xia's second sister-in-law forced a smile and said: \"Why did Qiao Family's two brothers come here? It's unlucky to come to the hospital during this New Year!\"Old Second Zhao immediately nodded and echoed his wife's words: \"Yes. That's right. Two in-laws should go home quickly. It's enough with us taking care of little Yi Ming!\"His got a look of guilty conscience!As soon as they came, they wanted to send the two brothers away.Qiao Zhen Min spoke with a sullen face: \"My nephew is about to die. If I, as his maternal uncle, only thinks about auspiciousness and bad luck, can I still be human?\"Qiao Hong Xia jumped up from the ground and pointed at old Second Zhao and yelled: \"They are beasts! If it weren't for them, how could Yi Ming end up in this current state?\"Old Second Zhao's expression changed. He stubbornly said, \"Third Younger Sister-in-law, don't talk nonsense! Little Yi Ming fell into the river by himself. What did it has to do with us?\"Second Sister-in-law Zhao patted her thigh: \"That's right! You can randomly eat stuff but you can't randomly talk things! With so many eyes at the time, who do you want to accuse?\"Qiao Hong Xia glared at them. Her gaze was burning: \"You're inferior to pigs and dogs. If there is evidence, I would have reported you to the police station and get the police to arrest all of you and shoot you all! Still, the Heaven are watching what people are doing. One day, you and your children will face retribution!\"What scene did she see when she ran over?It was her son flopping in a panic in the river, while his paternal cousins stood on the bank and happily clapped their hands one by one!At that time, she really wanted to kill them all!When Second Sister-in-law Zhao heard this, immediately she erupted and rushed to grab Qiao Hong Xia's hair: \"B*tch, cursing my children, eh? I will let you curse my children! See if I won't kill you!\"Qiao Hong Xia didn't expect her to suddenly attack. She got pulled down to the ground when her hair was grabbed!Although it was wrong to beat a woman, Qiao Zhen Min couldn't stand and watch Third Younger Sister getting beaten!With a cold face, he flew forward and kicked Second Sister-in-law's chest!Second Sister-in-law Zhao let out an \"ouch\" and was kicked to the ground: \"Very good! The whole family is bullying me. Old Second Zhao, are you dead? Are you going to watch your wife get beaten?\"Only then did old Second Zhao react. He swung his fist towards Qiao Zhen Min!\"BOOM!\"Before his fist touched Qiao Zhen min, he was punched in the face by Qiao Zhen Guo, who was standing beside him. The pain made him gasp!Oh sh*t!The dog that bites didn't bark wasn't wrong at all!Just now, he saw Qiao Zhen Guo foolishly standing there and thought that he wouldn't know to take action. Now he knew it was a big mistake!Qiao Zhen Min glanced at his eldest brother appreciatively: \"Well done, Eldest Brother!\"Qiao Zhen Guo smiled slyly: \"I'm still a little weak. If Mom did it, she will definitely be able to send him to see Zhao Family's ancestors on the spot!\"In an instant, old Second Zhao's face became whiter. As white as paper!A year ago, because of Zhao Yi Ming's fall into the river, Qiao Family came knocking on the door. At that time, Qiao Xiu Zhi, who was in her fifties, pressed them brothers to the ground and gave them a round of beating. He still remembered the taste!After Second Sister-in-law Zhao was kicked back, Qiao Hong Xia immediately rushed forward and slapped repeatedly: \"B*tch! B*tch! What did my child do wrong to yours for them to hurt him like this?\"A year ago, their children pushed Yi Ming into the river. It caused Yi Ming to have a high fever and burned his brain silly. The four-year-old child can't remember his name even until now!At that time, her mom and her brothers came knocking and gave Zhao Family a severe lesson. Her man, Zhao Jie Fang knelt on the ground and begged her to forgive him and begged her not to divorce. In addition, her mother-in-law agreed to let her family move out, so her softened.However, she never expect that it had only been a year and the same thing happened again!At that time, them daughters-in-law were slaved by their mother-in-law, Xiao Cui Hua to cook New Year's Eve dinner in the kitchen. She was too busy to take care of her child. Who knew in a blink, Yi Ming was pushed into the river again!Even now he was lying in coma in the hospital bed for a few days. The doctor had already issued a critical state notice and told her to prepare for the future!It was all her fault!She shouldn't be soft-hearted at the beginning. She shouldn't think that the devil can become good!She harmed her child!Since her child can't live, let's all die together!Qiao Hong Xia hit with red eyes. Although she had no inherent supernatural strength, one shouldn't underestimate the power of an angry mother!After a while, Second Sister-in-law Zhao was beaten until her face was bloody. A few teeth were knocked out: \"Help...Murder...Help...Aiya...\"The doctor on duty heard the ruckus and ran in to take a look. He sternly shouted, \"All of you stop it! If you don't stop it, I'll call the police!\"Old Second Zhao covered his face and said, \"Fellow nurse, don't call the police. Don't call the police. Our family is just playing around.\"Playing around?Are you sure?The doctor looked at his blue nose and swollen face and the woman lying on the ground whose was almost bald from the hair pulling. He was speechless: \"I don't care whether you are playing around or not. Your behavior has affected other patients. Either stop now or we will notify the police immediately!\"Only then, Qiao Zhen Min went over to hold back his third elder sister: \"Third Elder Sister, calm down. It's not worth killing this kind of person!\"It wasn't a pity for Zhao Family to die, but it would be a shame to be shot for this kind of people!Qiao Hong Xia slumped on the ground. Covering her face, she cried again!Seeing Third Elder Sister crying like this, Qiao Zhen Min felt very uncomfortable and asked the doctor about his nephew's condition.After hearing the answer, his face became even more ugly: \"Elder Brother, this matter can't end well. I'll stay here and guard Third Sister. You go back and notify Dad and Mom to come over!\"\"Okay. I'll go back now!\" Qiao Zhen Guo nodded. He immediately turned and left.When old Second Zhao heard this, his whole body shivered. Then he slipped out of the ward.Qiao Zhen Min didn't stop him.The monk can run, but the temple can't run. What's more, his wife was still here!...Qiao Zhen Guo hurried back to Qili Village and told his parents about Qiao Hong Xia.The atmosphere at home became heavy at once.Qiao Xiu Zhi stood up with a calm face: \"I'll go to the hospital with you.\"Xue Chuan also stood up: \"I'll go too.\"Her daughter and grandson were bullied into this state. How could he not go as a father?Qiao Xiu Zhi gave him a worried look.But before she spoke, she heard Xue Chuan assured: \"Don't worry, I'm fine.\"He knew his body the best. He clearly felt that his body was getting better little by little these days.He used to get up a few times a night. Now he can sleep until dawn. His symptoms of rheumatic pain in his legs had improved a lot.Although he did not know why this change occurred, he was very happy to see this change.He used to worry that he would leave before his wife. In this world, the person he was most worried about was her. Now his health was getting better, maybe he can stay with her for a few more years.Qiao Xiu Zhi thought for a while and agreed, \"Then you put on that army coat.\"Xue Chuan would have cold hands and feet every winter. He was particularly afraid of the cold. After Qiao Zhen Min knew about it, he got an army coat from a veteran.When everyone was about to go out, a little dumpling rushed up: \"Grandmother, take me. I'm going to see little brother Yi Ming!\"Before Qiao Xiu Zhi opened her mouth, Qiao Zhen Jun anxiously said: \"Da Qiao, come here to Dad. Your grandfather and grandmother are going out to handle important matters. They can't take you there!\"The little dumpling, who was always very obedient, was very firm this time.She shook her little head and said in her baby voice, \"No. I'm going to meet little Brother Yi Ming! Grandfather, Grandmother, can you take me there? I'm very good and obedient. I won't cause you trouble!\"She didn't know what \"death\" was, but when she heard that little Brother Yi Ming fell into the river and hadn't woken up for a few days, she was very worried.Little Brother Yi Ming was so cute. Every time he saw her, he would squint and softly call her \"Elder Sister Nian Nian\". She liked little Brother Yi Ming very much. So she didn\u2019t want something to happen to little Brother Yi Ming!That's why, she had to go to the hospital and feed jade bead water to little Brother Yi Ming!She wanted to save little Brother Yi Ming!Qiao Zhen Jun didn't understand what happened to this child today. He said with a stern look, \"Da Qiao, come here, or Dad will be angry!\"He had the best relationship with Third Younger Sister. Hearing that something like this happened to Third Young Sister, he really wished to fly over to back her up immediately.It was a pity that he can't move. He can't even stand up. All he can do was to not to cause trouble to his parents. That's why he had such a big reaction when he saw Da Qiao throwing a temper.Da Qiao pursed her lips and looked at her grandmother. Her big black eyes imploringly gleamed: \"Grandmother, can you take me there?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi's heart softened and subconsciously nodded: \"Then go. However, you can't make trouble later, understand?\"Little dumpling Da Qiao's eyes were as bright as the stars in the sky and nodded like a little pecking chick: \"I won't make trouble. I'm very obedient. I listen to what Grandmother and Grandfather say!\"\"Then why aren't you still putting on a cotton cap?\"Da Qiao immediately turned around. With a 'thump thump thump', she ran to the kang, put on the little red cap that her grandfather made for her on her head. Then she ran back with a 'thump thump thump': \"Grandmother, I can go out!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi picked her up and strode out of the house.Seeing her departing mother-in-law with Da Qiao in tow from her back, Wan Chun Ju internally felt uncomfortable again.Father-in-law and Mother-in-law really had a pit in their brains. They left the only grandson of Qiao Family aside. Instead ran to love that girl, Da Qiao!What was good about that Da Qiao girl? She was a natural-born evil. Everyone who had a relationship with her would be unlucky!Besides, girls will always marry out. No matter how good one was to them, it is for nothing!She curled her lips and turned her head to look at her two daughters sitting in the corner. Their heads huddled together and were whispering about something unknown.She stepped forward and slapped each on of them on the head: \"It's enough that you two don't look good. Why aren't your mouth pleasing! Look at Da Qiao. She how happy she coaxed your grandparents. Can\u2019t you learn?\"After receiving a jab from her mom, introverted Qiao Dong He would only pursed her mouth when she felt unhappy.While Qiao Dong Ying got a temper. She immediately raised her head to retort her mom: \"Mom, my dad said, we don't look good, because we look like you! Our unpleasing mouths must be like yours too!\"When Wan Chun J heard this, she almost exploded: \"You girl! Dare to talk about this old lady? See how this old lady sort you out today!\"Qiao Dong Ying wasn't scared at all: \"Mom, if you dare to touch a single hair of mine today, I will report you to Grandmother immediately when she come back!\"Report!These words made Wan Chun Ju tremble with anger: \"Roll off. Roll off. Every single one of you roll! Why did I give birth to you bunch of unscrupulous things!\"Qiao Dong Ying pulled her elder sister to stand up. Before leaving, she rolled her eyes towards her mom and spoke, \"Mom, my grandmother said rely on the mountain, the mountain crumble; rely on people, people run. Since you want to please Grandfather and Grandmother so much, why don't you please them yourself? ?\"After speaking, she pulled her sister away, leaving her mother alone in thought....After going back and forth, they arrived at the hospital again. It was past noon then.As soon as Qiao Xiu Zhi walked through the door of the ward with Da Qiao in her arms, she heard the voice of Qiao Hong Xia\u2019s mother-in-law from inside: \"Third's wife, do you understand what I just said? Later, tell in-laws when they come over that Yi Ming fell into the river by himself. It has nothing to do with our family members!\"\"As long as you listen to me, I promise I will never interfere with your little family matters in the future! Besides, Yi Ming is already a fool. Him living will only drag you down. You and old Third are still young. Later you can give birth as many as you want. If you can\u2019t give birth, you can still adopt a child from eldest branch and second branch! Old Third, go persuade to your wife!\"Zhao Jie Fang rubbed his dry hands, walked over and said with red eyes: \"Wife, I did you mother and son wrong in this matter. You can hit me!\"Since Zhao Jie Fang came, this was the first time Qiao Hong Xia looked at him: \"Zhao Jie Fang, open your dog's eyes to look clearly! The one lying in the hospital bed is your biological son, who was pushed into the river by your so-called family! \"When Xiao Cui Hua heard this, she jumped up like a cat whose tail had been stepped on. However, she was conscious about Qiao Zhen Min who was standing next to Qiao Hong Xia.She could only direct her anger on her son again: \"Old Third, are you going to let your wife talk nonsense?\"Zhao Jie Fang looked torn: \"Hong Xia, everyone is one family. Don\u2019t say that! Besides, I\u2019ve asked the few children about this. They all said that Yi Ming fell into the river by accident....\"\"SLAP!\"Before he finished speaking, Qiao Hong Xia fiercely slapped him on the face!Qiao Hongxia's eyes were red, and she gritted her teeth and stared at him: \"Zhao Jiefang, how blind I was to fancy a man like you! You can't protect your wife, let alone your child. Except for that part below you, which part of you on your body make you look like a man?\"Second Sister-in-law Zhao sneered: \"Third Brother, your wife really not saving you a bit of face. How can anyone talk about her husband like that?\"Zhao Jie Fang's face was flushed red. The veins on his forehead was exposed.\"BOOM!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi held Da Qiao and kicked the door of the ward!When Zhao Family witnessed this, their faces were all white.\"In...in-law, you came?\" Xiao Cui Hua's tone was obviously weakened a lot.Qiao Xiu Zhi gave them a cold look: \"Very well. While I am away, it turns out that you bullied my daughter like this!\"Xiao Cui Hua: \"In-law, you misunderstood. We didn't bully Hong Xia! We are just communicating with her!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi turned around and handed Da Qiao to Xue Chuan. When she turned around again, she fisted her hand and declared, \"Very well. Then let's properly communicate!\"When Zhao Family saw sandbag-sized fist, their legs went completely soft.\"In-law, calm down...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi expressed she couldn't calm down!She quickly walked up, grabbed a person with one hand, and raised her hand \"PAPAPAPA!\"The ward sounded face-slapping noises one after another!No more, no less. Everyone in Zhao family received seven or eight slaps on their faces. Their cheeks were uniformly red and swollen.Xiao Cui Hua gritted her teeth and hated her to death: \"Qiao Xiu Zhi, don't bully people too much! If you dare to move your hand again, I will...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi turned to look at her and asked coldly: \"What will you do?\"Xiao Cui Hua shivered all over.Xiao Cui Hua's legs trembled.Xiao Cui Hua didn't dare to let out half a fart!While Qiao Xiu Zhi taught Zhao Family a lesson, Da Qiao struggled to get out of her grandfather's arms and ran to little Brother Yi Ming, who was on the hospital bed.Little Yi Ming's small body was lying on the large hospital bed. His thinness was obvious.His face was whiter than the sheets on his body. His eyes were tightly closed, as if he would never open his eyes and call her \"Elder Sister Nian Nian\" again.When Da Qiao's eyes soured and two bean-sized tears fell.\"Little Brother Yi Ming, Elder Sister Nian Nian came to see you. Open your eyes?\"She reached out and poked little brother Yi Ming's sallow cheek. Her heart was gulfed with sadness.Yi Ming didn't answer her. Even his breathing was so weak.Da Qiao did not dare to delay. She turned around to find water.Qiao Zhen Min noticed and couldn't help but ask her curiously: \"Little one, what do you want to do?\"There were teardrops on Da Qiao\u2019s eyelashes that she hadn't had the chance to dry: \"Fifth Uncle, I want to feed little Brother Yi Ming with water. Can you help me pour a bowl of water?\"Qiao Zhen Min stretched out his hand and rubbed her head. His voice choked slightly: \"Your little Brother Yi Ming can't have water now. You can feed him when he wakes up.\"The fact was that Yi Ming can't even drink water. He had no chance to wake up again!Anxious, Da Qiao bit her lip: \"But, I want to feed little Brother Yi Ming some water now. Fifth Uncle, can you help me?\"The hot water bottle was placed on a table higher than her. She couldn't get it without an adult to help her.Qiao Zhen Min felt that his eldest niece was usually very well-behaved and sensible. He couldn't understand why she was so suddenly \"willful\" today. Still, he had always been a very principled person: \"Be good, Da Qiao. Don't make a ruckus!\"After speaking, he stood up and walked away.Da Qiao nearly bit her lips open in agitation. Tears were in her big eyes.Why didn't Fifth Uncle help her?She wanted to find Grandfather and Grandmother, but they were negotiating with Zhao Family at this moment. She bit her lip and pondered for a while. Then she ran towards little Brother Yi Ming again.Taking advantage of everyone being occupied, she took out two jade beads from her palm. Then she opened little Brother Yi Ming's mouth and stuffed the jade beads in.The jade beads can melt when it meets water. Little Brother Yi Ming had saliva in his mouth, so it should be able to melt as well.She leaned over and softly spoke: \"Little Brother Yi Ming. be obedient. Hurry up and swallow the jade beads. Then you will get better soon!\"Zhao Family's nose and face were swollen. Their vigor was suppressed by Qiao Xiu Zhi. They couldn't act arrogant anymore.Second Sister-in-law Zhao was beaten the worst. Hate and anxiousness brewed in her heart.Yi Ming was pushed down the river by her son. If Qiao Xiu Zhi continued to on like this, her mother-in-law might push her son out.No, she must not let her son met with mishap!Her eyes suddenly fell on Da Qiao and she frowned.Why did this child look so familiar?Second Sister-in-law Zhao's memory was good. Her ability to recognize people was also top-notch. She quickly recognized this person as the calamity of the Qiao family!Although she didn't know why she suddenly became so good-looking, it was fine as long as she was a calamity to all relatives!Her eyes shone. She pointed at Da Qiao and screamed: \"That kid, what are you doing? Don't poke with your hands! Such recklessness can poke a fine person to death by you!\"With her yell, everyone's eyes immediately focused on Da Qiao.Da Qiao was a little confused. Her little face flushed.She defended in a low voice: \"I didn't poke hard. Just lightly touched. I want to wake up little Brother Yi Ming.\"Zhao Er's wife was too proud: \"You all heard it? She herself admitted to poking. Don\u2019t know if Yi Ming was poked to death? Mom, we must call a doctor to come over at once and see. If Yi Ming does die, we can't carry this pot!\"Xiao Cui Hua took a second to understand what her second daughter-in-law meant. Immediately, she yelled: \"Doctor! Doctor, quickly come! The child in ward 215 is getting poked to death!\"Qiao Zhen Min saw that Zhao Family's eldest was going to call for a doctor and asked his mom: \"Mom, should we stop him?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi shook her head. Then she beckoned Da Qiao: \"Da Qiao, come here.\"Da Qiao ran to her grandmother. Her little hand gripped the corner of her clothes tightly as tears pooled in her big eyes: \"Grandmother, I didn't poke little Brother Yi Ming too hard.\"She really touched little Brother Yi Ming very lightly just now.Little Brother Yi Ming was so cute. Why would she poke him hard?\"Grandmother knows.\" Qiao Xiu Zhi comforted her.Qiao Hong Xia ran back to the bed and looked down. She came to a halt.Don't know if it was her illusion, she felt that Yi Ming's face seemed to be a lot more ruddy than before?Second Sister-in-law Zhao noticed Qiao Hong Zia being stunned. She thought Zhao Yi Ming became worst and shouted again: \"Third Sister-in-law, how is he? Did Yi Ming get poked to death? Oh, what's the matter with in-law? Bring kids here at this moment?\"\"This child...Oh, I remember! Isn't this child the famous calamity of Qiao Family? I heard that she almost killed her mom and sister when she was born. Not long ago, she paralyzed her father. This person was born as walking disaster. Why do you let her get close to Yi Ming. My poor nephew, as soon as she came, he immediately get killed!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi shouted: \"You shut up!\"Just when she wanted to stand up and slap her, the doctor came in.There was so much noise in this ward, so the doctor was paying attention. When Xiao Cui Hua yelled, the doctor came over immediately.The doctor walked to the bed, looked down, and showed the same reaction as Qiao Hong Xia.When Zhao Family saw the doctor's reaction, they all believed that Zhao Yi Ming was dead.It was the perfect time for Zhao Yi Ming to die!This way, they can throw the pot to the calamity!The doctor took in Zhao Yi Ming's ruddy face and steady breathing. It was completely different from the way he was dying before. He was quite surprised.The child had been hospitalized for a few days with a high fever that never went away. Since this morning, various vital signs had been rapidly declined. His breathing had been almost undetectable for several times.They have already issued a critical state notice and told the family to prepare for a funeral. But, what was going on now?He immediately examined the child. His expression became more confused after the examination!Not only did the child's breathe stabilize, even the high fever was gone!At this moment, little Yi Ming's eyelashes fluttered, opened his eyes slowly, and whispered: \"Elder Sister Nian Nian.\"He seemed to hear Elder Sister Nian Nian's voice just now.Everyone: \"!\"Second Sister-in-law Zhao's eyes widened: \"He...is this...is this coming back to life?\"Qiao Hong Xia's tears shed with a \"swish\": \"Yi Ming, you are awake! It's Mom. Do you recognize Mom?\"Little Yi Ming blinked and called in his baby voice, \"Mom.\"Qiao Hong Xia's tears flowed more fiercely. She grabbed the doctor's hand and said, \"Doctor, how is my child? He's awake now. Does it mean he can live?\"The doctor recovered his sense. Still, his heart was very shocked: \"The child's high fever has gone away and all the vital signs have stabilized. There should be no problem.\"Zhao Family:?What did the doctor mean?It can't be that Yi Ming didn't revive, but made it through?Qiao Hong Xia covered her face and couldn't help burst into a sob.Da Qiao broke away from her grandmother's embrace and ran towards little Brother Yi Ming: \"Little Brother Yi Ming!\"That's wonderful. Little Brother Yi Ming was getting better!Little Yi Ming turned his head and saw his elder sister Nian Nian. He slid off the bed and rushed over: \"Elder Sister Nian Nian!\"Zhao Family:!What happened to the critical state?What about preparing for the funeral?What was going on now?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn fact, the doctor was very confused.The person who was obviously standing on the door of hell with both feet, suddenly healed!If it spreads out, will the people think that their medical skills were too rookie?Although Xiao Yi Ming consumed the jade bead, he was seriously ill after all. On top of that, he laid down for a good few days. He really didn't have much strength in his body. He fell into a small squat after running a few steps.\"Little Brother Yi Ming!\" Da Qiao rushed towards him in distress and helped little Brother Yi Ming, \"Have you fallen?\"Little Yi Ming raised his head, blinked his small eyes, and said aggrievedly: \"Elder Sister Nian Nian, my butt hurts a bit!\"Butt hurt?\"Elder Sister Nian Nian rub it for you.\" Little dumpling Da Qiao's little hand was placed on little Brother Yi Ming's butt and she pressed it lightly.Little Yi Ming's thin face instantly became red. He wiggled his body and whispered: \"Little butt...can't be touched.\"Since little Yi Ming burned his brain, he couldn't remember things. Not even his own name.In order to teach him to protect herself, Qiao Hong Xia spent a huge amount of energy and time.One of them was to make him remember that he can't let others touch his small machine and little butt. Although little Yi Ming's brain wasn't good, he can still remember it vaguely if he repeated it enough time.So now that Elder Sister Nian Nian touched his little but, he felt a little bad. But he didn't know how to refuse.Dumpling Da Qiao didn't hear little Brother Yi Ming's whisper. After touching it, she commented in her babyish voice: \"Little Brother Yi Ming, your butt don't have flesh. It feel bony to touch.\"His butt was bony under Elder Sister Nian Nian's hand?This wasn't good!He immediately turned his head and declared loudly: \"Mom, little Yi Ming wants to eat meat. Little Yi Ming's butt has no flesh. Elder Sister Nian Nian's hand find it bony!\"Everyone: \"...\"Qiao Hong Xia's eyes reddened again. She choked and nodded her head wildly: \"Okay, okay. Mom will cook meat for you when we go back, so that your little butt will become fleshy!\"Her child laid there motionless not long ago. She thought she would lose him forever.Unexpectedly, he came back alive in the blink of an eye. And had vigorously got off the hospital bed and told her that he wanted to eat meat!Not to mention eating meat, she will get fairy meat for him if he wants to eat it!Also, Yi Ming got better after Da Qiao touched him. Whoever dares to say that she is a calamity in the future, she will spit at their face!Although Zhao Family were surprised that little Yi Ming \"resurrected from the dead,\" they couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief after the shock.Little Yi Ming wasn't dead. Qiao Family can't make trouble then!Xiao Cui Hua turned to Qiao Xiu Zhi and said, \"In-law, there is no problem with the child at all. Now you beat our family like this, how do you think this matter should be resolved?\"Got to pay fifty to one hundred yuan. If not, she won't let it drop!Qiao Xiu Zhi smiled coldly: \"The child is okay. Then you can deny the fact that you guys pushed the child into the water? And treat it as if everything has never happened? If you dare to answer one yes, I will immediately carry you to the riverside and dump you in the river!\"Xiao Cui Hua: \"...\"People can't be be so domineering!People can't be like Qiao Xiu Zhi!It just happened not one of the many Zhao Family members resist!Carry?This madam was too aggressive, no?The doctor looked at Qiao Xiu Zhi with shock.Seeing that no one in Zhao Family dared to say anything, Qiao Xiu Zhi turned back to Qiao Hong Xia and said, \"How do you going to solve this?\"Qiao Hong Xia's eyes burned with anger: \"Dad, Mom, I want to divorce. I don't want to live with these beasts anymore!\"There was no hesitation in Qiao Xiu Zhi's words. She nodded and stated: \"Then get a divorce!\"The doctor on the side was stunned again.As the saying goes, choose to demolish ten temples over destroying a marriage. Which couples didn't have conflicts in this day and age? Who wasn't persuading peace and not divorcing?And how shameful it was to divorce!If someone in someone's family gets divorced, they won't be able to lift their heads outside!This old lady agreed to her daughter's divorce without even thinking about it. Was this... really good?Zhao Family was also shocked.Although Xiao Cui Hua didn't like this daughter-in-law, Qiao Hong Xia, she never thought about her son divorcing her.One, as the doctor thought, divorce was too shameful. Second, it was too expensive to get married!If Zhao Jie Fang gets divorced, he will definitely marry again in the future. Won't the money for marrying a wife be paid by her?Zhao Jie Fang was even more anxious: \"Hong Xia, isn't the child all right? Why are you getting a divorce? Don't make a fuss. Let's pack up and go back to the production team.\"Qiao Hong Xia spat on his face with a \"pah\", \"Who's making a fuss with you? You are a rubbish! You can't even protect your wife and child. Go home by yourself!\"Zhao Jie Fang's face flushed red. He wiped the saliva on his face with his hand and continued to plead: \"Hong Xia, this is my fault. Whether you hit me or scold me, I won't divorce you!\"Zhao Jie Fang was honest and hardworking. He didn't have a male ego. From these aspects, he was a good man.But he had a fatal weakness. He listened to the his mom. His character was a complete rubbish!Qiao Zhen Guo also listened to to his mom's words, but Qiao Xiu Zhi never deliberately made things difficult for his wife. As long as their general viewpoint was correct, she would never interfere with the husband and wife's affairs.But Qiao Hong Xia wasn't so lucky.Her mother-in-law, Xiao Cui Hua, was a sh*t-stirring stick. She had a strong desire for control. Everything must go they way she wanted.Seeing third son obeyed his wife's advice, she felt uncomfortable and looked for Qiao Hong Xia's trouble at every corner.The real conflict was due to the birth of little Yi Ming.Little Yi Ming had small eyes. But both Qiao Family and Zhao Family had big eyes. Xiao Cui Hua suspected that Qiao Hong Xia had put a green hat on her son.For this matter, there had already been a disturbance. If Zhao Jie Fang hadn't insisted that the child was his own, then Qiao Hong Xia would want to divorce him.However, Qiao Hong Xia had steeled her heart: \"It's useless to say anything. Whether you agree or not, I'm divorcing!\"She had made the wrong decision twice. If she made the wrong decision again this time, God will definitely not give her a third chance and will definitely take little Yi Ming away from her at that time!Zhao Jie Fang saw her determination. The 1.78 meter man's eyes instantly reddened and squatted on the ground as he constantly beated his head: \"I won't divorce! I don't want a divorce!\"Second Sister-in-law Zhao's eyes spun round and round: \"As the saying goes, forcedly picked melons aren't sweet. Mom, from what I see Third Sister-in-law is set on divorcing. Let's not make it difficult for her. But Yi Ming is our Zhao Family. He should go back with us, right?\"When Da Qiao heard this, she immediately pulled little Brother Yi Ming to her side and hugged him tightly.Fear flashed through her eyes. Little Brother Yi Ming will be snatched away by Zhao Family!Little Yi Ming didn't understand the situation. He thought Elder Sister Nian Nian was playing with him and stood still obediently.He raised his little head. Showing a mouthful of pearly teeth, he begged for praises: \"Elder Sister Nian Nian, little Yi Ming didn't move.\"Da Qiao rubbed little Brother Yi Ming's big forehead and said softly, \"Little Brother Yi Ming is so good. When we go back, Elder Sister Nian Nian will give you sweets!\"Her dad gave her a wooden box and she packed all the candies she received in it. Now the box was half full of candies.Little Yi Ming smiled happily when he heard that there was candy to eat.With this smile, his eyes became smaller. Which formed a sharp contrast with Da Qiao's big apricot eyes.When Xiao Cui Hua heard what her second daughter-in-law said, she slapped her thighs and jumped up: \"Yes. Yi Ming is our Zhao Family's seed. He must stay!\"Qiao Hong Xia gritted her teeth with anger: \"Don't think about it!\"Even if she must give up her life, she will take Yi Ming away!Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't want to waste a single word with these idiots. She turned to look at the doctor and said, \"Fellow doctor, when the police arrive, I hope you can help me give a statement!\"The doctor didn't expect that he would be involved. Startled, he uttered, \"What statement?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi: \"You just need to tell the police truthfully about the child's illness. Leave the rest to the police to investigate.\"When the doctor heard this, he breathed a sigh of relief: \"That's no problem. We will definitely cooperate with the police in the investigation.\"When the child was admitted to the hospital, they asked family members what happened to the child. They said that the child accidentally fell into the river by himself and was only rescued after a long time in the river.Unexpectedly, there was still a hidden secret in this. He never thought the child was probably harmed by his relatives!When Zhao Family heard this, their faces became pale again.\"In-law, it's just a small matter. There is no need to call the police, right?\" Xiao Cui Hua tremblingly addressed her in-law again.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't even look at her. She instructed Qiao Zhen Min: \"Go to the police station to report the case. Say that someone deliberately pushed a child into the river. There are so many people in the production team. I don't believe no one saw it!\"\"Okay, Mom. I'm going now!\" Qiao Zhen Min straightforwardly responded and walked away with his legs.When Zhao Family saw that they were serious, they trembled more.Zhao Lao Er squeezed his neck and shouted: \"Mom, what's there to be reluctant about? Since she want to divorce, let her. Want to take away Yi Meng, let her. It's just a fool. Staying at home will only waste food. Isn't it good that someone is willing to raise him now?\"How could Xiao Cui Hua be reluctant to part with her daughter-in-law and grandson?She didn't want to spend money. Nor could she swallow this breath!But now it was like this, she had to swallow it even if she can't: \"In-law, what will it talk for you to not report to the police?\"Qiao Zhen Min stopped when he heard these words and looked back at his mom.Qiao Xiu Zhi stated: \"Three conditions.\"\"First, get Zhao Jie Fang divorce Hong Xia. From now on, your Zhao family is not allowed to harass Hong Xia for any reason. And don't let me hear anything bad about Hong Xia, otherwise I will only think that you have spread it!\"Zhao Family gritted their teeth with hatred: \"...\"\"Second, the child belongs to our Qiao Family. Starting now, Zhao Yi Ming will change his name to Qiao Yi Ming and will have nothing to do with your Zhao Family in the future!\"Zhao Jie Fang called out, \"No, that's my child. I don't agree!\"It was a pity that his objection was no use.Neither Zhao Family nor Qiao Family took his words seriously.\"This is the third one. You have to pay two hundred yuan as Yi Ming's expenses for nourishing his body!\"\"Two hundred yuan? Are you dreaming!\"The first two Zhao Family members gritted their teeth and endured it.But paying?That was absolutely impossible!Zhao Family hadn't separate yet. Every penny spent was everyone's. This money mustn't be paid out!\"No?\" Qiao Xiu Zhi sneered, \"Then give you another choice.\"Zhao Family intuitively felt that Qiao Xiu Zhi couldn't spit out anything decent, but they couldn't help asking, \"What choice?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi: \"I will throw each and every one of Zhao Family into the river. How long little Yi Ming stayed in the river is how long you will stay in the river. As long as you do it, we don't need this two hundred yuan!\"Zhao Family: \"...\"They knew nothing good will come out of her!It was December. The river was almost frozen to ice. Letting them soak in the river water for half an hour was killing them, no?Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at them: \"Have you decided? If you don't want to choose either, then call the police!\"When Qiao Zhen Min heard this, he moved his legs and headed to the exit again.What else can Zhao Family do?They can't win with fist.Argue? The other party couldn't bother with mouth when they can use fist.Facing the female overlord Qiao Xiu Zhi, what else can they do besides complying?In the end, Zhao Family gritted their teeth and signed the \"unequal treaty\". In their heart, they cursed the eighteenth generation of Qiao Family thousands of times!Zhao Family didn't bring that much money out with them. So Qiao Xiu Zhi asked Qiao Zhen Min and Xiao Cui Hua to return to the production team to get the money. Once they got the money, they'll let the rest of Zhao Family go.Two hundred yuan ah! This made Zhao Family more pained than digging their flesh!Zhao Family left grinding their teeth. Only Zhao Jie Fang wasn't willing to leave.He clenched his hands with his reddened eyes: \"Hong Xia, I really know that I'm wrong. Let's not divorce. You and child go back with me.\"Qiao Hong Xia turned her face away. Not willing to give him half of an glance.Seeing his wife ignored him, Zhao Jie Fang turned to the child again: \"Yi Ming, go back with Dad. on't you want to eat meat? Dad will buy it for you!\"Little Yi Ming obediently leaned in his elder sister Nian Nian's arms. He didn't raise his head even when he heard his dad's voice.Da Qiao poked his little butt with her small hand: \"Little Brother Yi Ming, when someone talks to you, you have to look into the other person's eyes. Only like this, you are a good boy.\"Only then did little Yi Ming turn around to look at Zhao Jie Fang. Soon he turned around and asked with a baby voice: \"Elder Sister Nian Nian, who is he? Little Yi Ming don't know him!\"\"...\"The child's words pierced into Zhao Jie Fang's heart like a sharp knife.He covered his face and wept bitterly....Country folks didn't get a marriage certificate when they got married. Naturally there wasn't any divorce certificate for divorce. The two family discussing it out was enough.Therefore, Qiao Hong Xia became a divorced person that day.Because little Yi Ming was better, she didn't want to stay in the hospital and waste money. So she packed up her things and went back to Qili Village with her mom.Back in Qili Village, it was inevitable to meet some people who love gossip.\"Hong Xia, this new year is almost over. Why are you only coming back to your maternal house now?\"\"Where is your man? Why didn't he come with you?\"\"You got so much luggage. It can't be that you quarreled with your man, right?\"Qiao Hong Xia's face flushed red. It was clear that she hadn't adjusted to everyone's gaze.\"Hong Xia is divorced. From now on, she and her child will live in Qiao's house.\"Like the last time when Qiao Zhen Jun divorced, Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't intend to hide it this time.Paper can't wrap the fire. They can hide it for a while but not forever. Since they'll find out sooner or later, it was better to be clear from the beginning.Everyone: \"!\"What?Qiao Hong Xia also got a divorce?Qiao Zhen Jun\u2019s divorce had shocked everyone back then. How long had passed since then? Now Qiao Hong Xia also divorced!What exactly did this Qiao Family want to do?It was embarrassing enough to have a divorcee in the family. One wasn't enough for Qiao Family, so they want two?This Qiao Xiu ZhiAs parents, don't they hope for their children to be well. Instead of persuade them, she carried her child over to divorce. Now Hong Xia was divorced. It was mostly also Qiao Xiu Zhi's handiwork, no?Some people's eyes fell on Da Qiao, thinking that this child was indeed ominous.Qiao Zhen Jun was paralyzed. The two siblings got divorced. Wan Chun Ju saw blood and went to the hospital during the New Year. Come on. Better stay away from this child in the future!Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't bother to pay attention to what these idiots thought and took Qiao Family back to Qiao's old home with her head upright.Hearing the movement, Wan Chun Ju rushed out first. She shouted excitedly as she ran: \"Dad and Mom, you are finally back!\"Seeing her like this, Qiao Xiu Zhi frowned: \"Why are you running out so fast? Did something happen?\"Wan Chun Ju shook her head. Her bloated figure twisted and her tanned face displayed shyness. She whispered: \"Nothing happened. It's just that I haven't seen Dad and Mom for a half a day. I miss you so much!\"Everyone: \"...\"Wan Chun Ju's tone and appearance were obviously imitating Da Qiao.It was just Da Qiao was a fluffy and tender dumpling. And her voice was cute and baby-like. If she said this, everyone will only think she was cute.But with Wan Chun Ju, it was as if seeing a black mountain pig acting cute at you. The feeling... it was too terrible to describe!Qiao Zhen Guo looked at his wife like a ghost: \"Wife, I told you before. Don't talk like this. It's simply scary! Look at my goose bumps appeared again!\"As he spoke, he pulled up his clothes again. He was covered with goose bumps.Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"This man simply want to infuriate her to death!She just wanted to say something nice to please her in-laws. It was enough that he didn't support her. Now he even held her back!Qiao Dong Ying hid in the corner. She was laughing so hard that she couldn't straighten her waist.Qiao Dong He saw her younger sister like this and pinched her. She whispered: \"If your mom knows that you are messing with her, she will definitely not let you off!\"Qiao Dong Ying wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes and responded, \"When did I mess with her? I just told her to go and please Grandfather and Grandmother by herself. Out of everybody, why did she choose to learn from Younger Sister Da Qiao. I'm gonna dead from laughing!\"Qiao Dong He recalled her mom's behavior just now and couldn't help covering her mouth and laugh.Qiao Xiu Zhi had been tired after a long day. She didn't want to look at her eldest daughter-in-law's stupid face and walked passed her into the room.They haven't drank a sip of water or eaten a bite of food since they went out. So they were extremely drained at the moment.Qiao Xiu Zhi was really thirsty. When she picked up the water on the table and was about to drink it, Xue Chuan stopped her.\"This water is too cold. I will pour you a bowl of warm water.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi handed him the bowl.The action between the two naturally concealed indescribable warmth.Qiao Hong Xia watched. Her heart felt envy and sadness.When she married Zhao Jie Fang, didn't she have the idea of wanting to grow old with him?She can be said to be growing on dog food. Under the influence of her parents, she had wanted to find a good man like her dad once she grew up. She had a lot of choices. Even until she was nineteen years old, she hadn't selected the right person.People in the village said that her heart was higher than her destiny and thought she wanted to marry a rich man in the town. Fortunately, her parents did not force her to marry.Just when she was about to compromise, Zhao Jie Fang appeared.That summer, she was bitten by a poisonous snake on her foot. Zhao Jie Fang, who came to visit relatives in Qili Village, happened to pass by and rescued her.At that time, he was holding her with his tanned face flushed. He had kept saying that he would take responsibility.At that time she felt that this man was really honest and that it wouldn't be too bad to marry him. So later when he called a matchmaker to come over to ask for marriage, she quickly agreed.The result\u2026\u2026He was indeed very honest. Honest to the point where he can't protect his wife and child. What use was such a man no matter how honest he was?Wan Chun Ju walked in with red face. Her eyes fell on Qiao Hong Xia and flashed: \"Wasn't it said that Nephew Yi Ming is sick and hospitalized? He looked pretty energetic just now. Is he all better?\"Qiao Hong Xia came back to her senses. When she heard her talk about her child, a smile appeared on her face: \"Yes. He's completely better. But his body is still a little weak. Will have to nourish him in the future.\"Wan Chun Ju's heart \"thump\". Her instinct was saying something wasn't right!The child was all better. And instead of going back to Zhao's house, she came to Qiao's house with a baggage. What was she doing?Could it be that the two couples had a quarrel and she wanted to stay at her maternal home for a period of time?Qiao Xiu Zhi drank the water that Xue Chuan poured her. She looked at the two daughters-in-laws and declared, \"Hong Xia got a divorce. She will live at home in the future.\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Chen Qiao Qiao: \"...\"Divorce?Why was there another divorce?The expressions of the two sisters-in-law were exactly the same as those of the villagers. Shocked and speechless.Qiao Zhen Jun, who was leaning on the kang, was also shocked: \"Third Younger Sister, you divorced?\"Seeing her second brother, the aggrievances erupted within Qiao Hong Xia. She spoke with red eyes: \"Yes, I am divorced just like Second Elder Brother. In the future, us two brother and sister can be company for each other.\"Qiao Zhen Jun couldn't express his sadness when seeing Third Younger Sister looking like this.He was a man. What's more, a paralyzed one. Whether other divorce him or not, it was more tolerable.However, Third Younger Sister was a woman. When outside knows, who knows what they will say!Third Younger Sister was a divorcee and got a child in tow. If she wanted to remarry in the future, she might not be able to find any good people.If he wasn't paralyzed, he would be willing to support his third younger sister and nephew for the rest of his life. But now he...Qiao Hong Xia looked at her second brother's self-blaming expression and comforted him: \"Second Elder Brother, don't worry. I'll be fine! Mom said that as long as a person lives, there will be no obstacles that can't be overcome!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded: \"It's right for you to think like this! It's just a divorce. It's not the sky falling down. As long as you properly live your life, the days will always pass the better!\"Qiao Zhen Guo foolishly smiled, \"Third Younger Sister, don't worry. You have Eldest Brother. You won't go hungry!\"Qiao Zhen Jun pondered for a while and said, \"Third Younger Sister, there are more empty rooms in my place. Would you like to move to my place? Nephew can have Da Qiao as playmate.\"Qiao Zhen Min said straightforwardly: \"Third Elder Sister, I won't say too much about the affectionate things. As long as I can be of use, Third Elder Sister just speak!\"Qiao Hong Xia teared up again. Her nose was sour until the point of discomfort.But this time she wasn't sad. She was moved.This was her family!When she needed them most, they stood behind her unconditionally to support her.In the end, Qiao Hong Xia decided to live with her second elder brother.First, to avoid getting into conflict with her sisters-in-law. Second, to help take care of her second elder brother.Da Qiao and little Yi Ming were extremely happy when they knew that they could live together.Dumpling Da Qiao took little Brother Yi Ming's hand and said like a little grown up, \"Little Brother Yi Ming, half of Elder Sister Nian Nian's food will be shared with you from now on. This way you will soon have more meaty!\"Little Yi Ming tilted his head. His eyes smilingly narrowed into a crescent: \"En, en. After eating meaty, little Yi Ming's butt will soon be meaty!\"From now on, it won\u2019t be bony to Elder Sister Nian Nian\u2019s hand!The interaction of the two small dumplings was so funny and cute. Everyone couldn't help but laugh.After Qiao Hong Xia left, Wan Chun Ju latched on Qiao Zhen Jun and said in a low voice: \"Zhen Jun, Hong Xia really got a divorce?\"Qiao Zhen Guo sighed: \"Wife, why is your mind getting worse and worse? After a while, will you forget all of us like Nephew Yi Ming?\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Her brain wasn't stupid. How could she have forgotten!Wan Chun Ju took a deep breath and said, \"I haven't forgotten! I just wanted to say, why don't you persuade her. There is already a divorcee in this family. What will people think of us now that we got a second?\"Qiao Zhen Guo looked at her strangely: \"How would I know what people think of us?\"Wan Chun Ju half choked to death: \"Why don't you understand? Two people in the family have divorced. Wouldn't you feel ashamed when going out?\"Qiao Zhen Guo finally understood what his wife meant: \"Wife, do you think Second Younger Brother and Third Younger Sister being divorced making you lose face?\"Wan Chun Ju looked at her man's face and had a slightly feeling that she shouldn't nod her head: \"...I don't feel ashamed. But think about these ten miles and eight villages. Except for Qiao Family, who else would divorce?\"What's more, two in one go!Qiao Zhen Guo said with a proud look: \"That's right. In these ten miles and eight villages, only our Qiao Family dare to divorce!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"What was there to be proud of?Wan Chun Ju felt that there was simply a huge hole in her man's brain!Qiao Hong Xia was divorced!This news soon spread throughout Qili Village.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They deserve it!\"After Fang Xiao Juan knew about it, she almost miscarried from laughing!Old woman Fang also gloated in their misfortune: \"Wait and see. This will definitely not be the last one. Maybe someone from that family will get divorced soon!\"Although old woman Fang's words were ugly, no one refuted it.From everyone's point of view, Qiao Xiu Zhi was a weird mom!How can parents not hope their children to stay together for a hundred years? Instead, she insisted on divorce?It just happened that she disintegrated old Second Qiao and Fang Xiao Juan by herself. It was said that Qiao Hong Xia would divorce because Qiao Xiu Zhi supported her!Tsk tsk tsk. Fortunately, they didn\u2019t become in-laws with Qiao Family back then. Otherwise they might get divorced at any time!In an instant, Qiao Family became a target of public criticism.Especially Qiao Xiu Zhi. She had become synonymous with 'evil mother-in-law'.When everyone left, old woman Fang lowered her voice and asked, \"Xiao Juan, are you sure there is no problem with Wang Family?\"Fang Xiao Juan raised her eyes slightly and lazily responded: \"Is there a need to ask? Wang Family has already told me that they will get the matchmaker come here before the spring ploughing!\"Old woman Fang\u2019s face suddenly bloomed like a chrysanthemum flower: \"Oh, I\u2019m relieved! When you were just born, the village's blind fortune-teller told me that you are the most blessed girl in our Fang Family. You will definitely live in wealthy and prosperity in the future. This old lady is going to enjoy the blessing with you!\"This was pure dog fart!Before Fang Xiao Juan told her that Wang Family was going to marry her, old woman Fang scorned her as hoodoo every day. On New Year, she even wanted to drive her out of the house!Now that she had climbed to Wang Family's high branch, her words were laced with currying. What a might!Still, Fang Xiao Juan enjoyed the days of being held up high.Xiao Qiao sat in the corner. Her brows frowned slightly.During this period of time, she couldn't get close to Da Qiao. Only encountered her once from a distance.Just that once, it shocked her to the point that her whole person freeze!It had only been half a month and Da Qiao looked like she completely reborn!It was like she was completely powdered with jade. Her skin was so fair that she can almost glow. Just a look and one can't take her eyes away from her!More importantly, her stuttering was gone!In the last life, her stuttering wasn't as severe as this life. Still, it had took her more than a year to correct it and get better.Now it was only half a month and her stuttering was completely gone!How could she not be shocked?No. She can't wait any longer. She must find a chance to meet Da Qiao!It went without saying Qiao Family knew and heard the rumors outside. They just pretended like they didn't.Because of Qiao Hong Xia's arrival, the task of caring for Qiao Zhen Jun had become much easier. The people in Qiao's old house don't have to go to keep watch every night.It was just that the four people in Qiao's small house, there were paralyzed and children. What remained was Qiao Hong Xia, a woman. Qiao Xiu Zhi felt it wasn't safe. So she planned to get two dogs back home to raise.After knowing this, Qiao Zhen Jun and Qiao Hong Xia agreed to the idea. With a dog in the courtyard, the dog will definitely bark if some person with bad intention enter in the middle of the night.At this day and age, everyone can\u2019t get enough food. Very few owned dog. Qiao Xiu Zhi asked people to inquire around. Only then did she find out that there was a family in the neighboring production team who had a dog and happened to give birth recently.After Da Qiao and little Yi Ming knew that their family would have dogs, the two little dumplings were very excited.The two got together every day, discussing what to name the little doggies.Two days later, Qiao Zhen Guo brought back two small pups from the neighboring production team.One was black and white and the other was light yellow.Dumpling Da Qiao looked at the two cute little pups. Her big eyes were so bright that it seem to be glowing: \"Grandmother, can we raise the two little cubbies?\"An Ping butt in: \"Can only give you one. One is for us to raise!\"How could both of them be placed in Qiao's small house?The sisters, Qiao Dong He and Qiao Dong Ying nodded like knife chopping onion: \"Yes, that's right. Can only give one for you to raise. However, since you and Younger Brother Yi Ming are younger, you can choose first.\"The two little puppies were just one month old. They were chubby. Their limbs were not strong enough as they climbed up softly and occasionally collapse down. Their soft barks were nonstop.Dumpling Da Qiao eyed the lovely and innocent pups. For the first time in her life, she suffered the problem of having a choice: \"Little Brother Yi Ming, both little doggies are so cute. Which one do you we should choose?\"Little Yi Ming stared at his elder sister Nian Nian with small eyes, and grinningly answered: \"Choose Elder Sister Nian Nian!\"Da Qiao patted her younger brother's head and sighed in her babyish voice: \"Little Brother Yi Ming, you got it wrong. We're not choosing me. We're choosing a little doggy.\"\"No. Just choose Elder Sister Nian Nian!\"Little Yi Ming loudly yelled. When he finished speaking, he threw himself into Elder Sister Nian Nian's embrace. Nearly pushed Da Qiao down.While Da Qiao siblings clumped together, An Ping had already taken a fancy on the black and white little pup.The little pup looked very special. The left eye circle was black, while the right eye circle was white. It seem like it was wearing a pair of black and white glasses. A very particular feature.An Ping greeted the pup,, but the pup seemed to dislike him as it baby-fiercely barked at him twice: \"Woofwoof...\"An Ping thought that it liked him, so he reached out and poked its little head. The pup couldn't stand firmly, so it fell on all fours in an instant. Immediately it became even more angry.\"Woofwoof...\"It got up, sniffed at An Ping's feet with its small nose, and suddenly shook its body. It gave An Ping a special gift... a baby dog's urine.\"You little rotten egg. You actually pee on the back of my foot!\" An Ping blushed. He was furious.Qiao Dong Ying pointed to her younger brother and laughed like hyena: \"Younger Brother, you already reached that age!\"An Ping was huffing in anger: \"Second Elder Sister, what are you talking about? What age?\"Qiao Dong Ying grinned: \"At the age where people and dogs disdain, hahaha...\"Qiao Dong He covered her mirth. She was afraid that her younger brother would become angry from embarrassment and secretly pulled her younger sister once.An Ping wasn't angry though. Instead, he sighed: \"I'm quite surprised. The age when people and dogs disdain arrived too suddenly.\"The adults couldn't help laughing when they heard the children's conversation.The little pup didn't feel like it did anything bad. It swayed its ass and crawled towards Da Qiao.When it came to Da Qiao's feet, it intentionally fell over. It revealed its fleshy belly and yelled twice with its baby voice: \"Woofwoof...\"Da Qiao's heart instantly softened. She reached out and touched its belly. The little pup wasn't angry. It looked like it was enjoying it.\"Elder Cousin Brother, Elder Cousin Sisters, I have decided. I want this little doggy.\" Da Qiao pointed to the black and white pup.The pup seemed to understand what she said and stretched out its little tongue and licked her fingers. The appearance was so clever that it An Ping's heart itching.Being licked by it, Da Qiao giggled. She hugged the pup and asked little Brother Yi Ming, \"Little Brother Yi Ming, what name do you want to give to the little doggy?\"Little Yi Ming tilted his little head for a moment before pointing at the pup and shouted, \"Pi Pi! Pi Pi!\"Everyone: \"...\"An Ping immediately laughed like a hyena: \"Hahaha, Younger Brother Yi Ming, you are amazing! You gave the little dog a butt name!\"Little Yi Ming didn't understand. He treated it as his elder maternal cousin brother complimenting him. His small eyes merrily curved into crescent.Little Brother Yi Ming had a serious illness before and had lost a lot of weight. Da Qiao felt very distressed about it. Seeing that little Brother Yi Ming was so happy at the moment, she nodded and agreed.Pi Pi it was then. As long as little Brother Yi Ming was happy.Like this, the black and white little pup was named Pi Pi and stayed in the Qiao's small house.The little yellow dog went to Qiao's old home. An Ping gave it a very proper name, called Qiao You Rou.This name collided with Fang Family's younger grandson, Fang You Rou. After the Fang Family knew about it, old woman Fang pointed at the sky in the yard and cursed for an hour....Winter passed and spring arrived. The branches quietly bloomed out fresh green. Spring was getting closer and closer.Before the spring ploughing, another shocking gossip broke out in Qili Village... Wang Family got the matchmaker to go to Fang Family to ask for marriage!\"This news is fake, right? How could Wang Family taken a liking to that broken shoe Xiao Juan?\"\"I don't believe it either. Although Fang Xiao Juan got some look, she had been married and had two children. Although Wang Xin Sheng is lazy bum, there is no need to choose a second-hand good like Fang Xiao Juan!\"\"Ain't that right! Wang Family is more well-off than Qiao Family. I heard that Wang Family's old Third had bagged another meritorious service in the army. Maybe he will soon be promoted to regiment commander. The money sent back will definitely be more than fifty yuan! \"Hearing fifty yuan, everyone's eyes became different!Fifty yuan a month. Even if they had meat every day, they won't finish it!Although Wang Xin Sheng was lazy bum, he wasn't bad to his bones.He had never committed crimes or molested women. He was just lazy. It wasn't a big problem!In fact, there had always been people of average family background who want to marry their girls to Wang Family. It was just those girls weren't very good-looking and Wang Xin Sheng hadn't taken a fancy to any of them.Wang Xin Sheng's requirements for women were to be pretty- have to have a good-looking face and a good figure. Ideally, someone feminine with curvy front and back.Such requirements weren't low. Even when there was such a girl, they won't fancy him, a second-hand man!Not to mention that he was a loafer!Still, everyone never expected that Wang Xin Sheng would end up picking the broken shoe, Fang Xiao Juan!Some people who were eyeing on Wang Family instantly became dissatisfied and went to Wang Family to badmouth Fang Xiao Juan.\"Cui Hua, you better persuade your mother-in-law. That woman, Fang Xiao Juan is a sh*t-stirrer. Think about the years she was married to Qiao Family. Qiao Family was chicken flying and dog jumping every day. If your Wang Family really let her in the door, there will definitely be no peace in the future!\"\"Yes! And that woman hasn't been pregnant for five or six years. Who knows if she can still have a baby? I heard that she had bleed and damaged her body back then. The purpose of marrying a wife is to have children. If a hen that can't lay is married in, then it will be a big loss!\"\"Also, Fang Family isn't a stressful bunch. There will definitely be countless troubles when this kind of in-laws stick on. So, Cui Hua, you should let your in-laws reconsider!\"Liu Cui Hua felt bitter in her mouth when she heard these words.None of Wang Family, including Wang Xin Sheng himself, hoped for Fang Xiao Juan to enter in the door!But can they refuse?They dare not!If they didn't let Fang Xiao Juan enter the door, she would go to the police station to report Wang Xin Sheng later. Then their Wang Family would be finished!Therefore, she squeezed out a smile and responded: \"How can I, a daughter-in-law, intervene in this matter? Besides, Xiao Juan isn't as bad as you said. She is beautiful and has a straightforward temper. Although this temperament is easy to offend people, it at least shows that she doesn't much petty mind. So I think this marriage is very good.\"Everyone: \"...\"Fang Xiao Juan don't have petty mind?Haha!Wang Family was either blind or got their brains flooded!Enough. Since the other party had said that, what more fart should they persuade?So in the midst of the discussions and the indignation of some people, the marriage between Wang Family and Fang Family was settled.Because it was both's second marriage and the baby in Xiao Juan's belly couldn't wait, the two families decided not to do the wedding big after discussing it.They choose a date and the two families will have a meal together Like this, the wedding was considered done.Actually, Fang Family was very dissatisfied with the result of this discussion.Since the engagement with the Wang Family, Fang Family walked with a spring. The young and old were always looking at people with their chins high.They naturally wanted to hold a banquet. The bigger the better!But Wang Family disagreed!Wang Family originally didn't want Fang Xiao Juan to enter the door, so how could they be willing to hold a banquet for her?Fang Xiao Juan was very dissatisfied and pulled a long face on the spot. However, Wang Xin Sheng left no room for compromise this time.What's more, he left an ultimatum. If she wanted to marry, then marry. If not, off with you. If she dared to report, he will kill everyone in Fang Family!He thought it was a good deal to exchange his life for the Fang Family's eight lives!Fang Xiao Juan took in his fierce expression and didn't dare to go head-on with him. So she gritted her teeth and agreed.Fang Family felt that Wang Family was overbearing and looked down upon them. They were so stingy even though they were rich. Can't expect them to take care of Fang family in the future!Wang Family was forced to marry this hoodoo, Fang Xiao Juan. When thinking of Fang Xiao Juan's threats against Wang Family, Wang Family felt something lodged in their throat.Like way, the grudge and dissatisfaction were planted before the marriage began....The news of Fang Xiao Juan marrying spread like wildfire. Qiao Family, who lived in the same village, knew even if they didn't want to.Wan Chun Ju was half sour and half envious: \"I didn't expect that Fang Xiao Juan woman to be quite capable. She can actually marry Wang Family!\"Qiao Zhen Guo sent his wife a strange look and said, \"Being able to marry into Wang Family is called capable?\"Wan Chun Ju nodded: \"Wang Family has seven brick rooms in a row. There is that old Third, an officer in the army. Eldest is the leader of the production team. When Fang Xiao Juan marries in, wouldn't it mean that she has married into the blessed nest?\"Qiao Zhen Guo thought for a while and shook his head: \"I still think you are more capable, Wife.\"Wan Chun Ju never expected her man to praise her in front of everyone!Feeling happy, she purposely glanced at Chen Qiao Qiao, who was opposite her.Then she heard her man continue to say: \"You obviously eat more more than the pigs in the production team. But in order to marry me, you actually endured for more than a month and ate only one bowl of rice per meal. So I think you are more capable than Fang Xiao Juan!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Chen Qiao Qiao burst into a chuckle with a 'puchi'.This eldest brother was simply a heart-jabbing madman. If he didn't give his wife a jab every day it seem that he can't sleep!When Wan Chun Ju heard Chen Qiao Qiao's laughter, her face turned red and white. She almost vomited a mouthful of old blood!Qiao Zhen Min glanced at his eldest brother in speechlessness. Then he turned to ask his mom: \"Mom, do you want Second Brother to know about this?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi pondered for a while and answered, \"You don't need to purposely tell him or keep it secret. He will eventually know when he needs to know.\"Even if their Qiao Family deliberately kept it from him, they couldn't hide it for a lifetime.Besides, the two had divorced. Fang Xiao Juan was still young. Sooner or later she will marry.\"Then do you want Younger Sister Da Qiao to know? Will she be sad when she knows?\" Qiao Dong Ying couldn't help but interject.She put herself in the position and thought for a moment. If her parents divorced and her mother wants to remarry, she will definitely be sad.Even though her mother was patriarchal-minded and didn't care about her very much, she would still be sad.Qiao Xiu Zhi frowned: \"Who has seen Da Qiao today?\"Everyone froze. Then they shook their heads.Everyone realized that Da Qiao didn't come to Qiao's old house today!Qiao Xiu Zhi stood up and declared, \"I'll go over there and take a look.\"Xue Chuan also stood up: \"I will go with you.\"The few kids also stood up: \"We'll go too!\"At this time, Da Qiao wasn't in Qiao's small house. She hide behind a big tree not far from Fang's house. Her big eyes were staring in the direction of Fang's house with her small mouth tightly pressed together.Yesterday, she was caught by some auntie when she came out of Qiao's old house.They told her that her mom was going to marry and take Younger Sister Xiao Qiao into Wang Family. From then on, she had nothing to do with Qiao Family!They had said that in the future, her mom would have a new baby and would completely forget her, this daughter.They had said that Younger Sister Xiao Qiao would change her surname and call another Dad. In the future, she won't be part of Qiao Family, but Wang Family instead!After she listened, she felt uncomfortable.She knew that her mom didn't like her as she disdained her for being a calamity and called her inherent hoodoo. Still, she couldn't hate her mom.She even hoped that one day her mom would like her the way she likes Younger Sister Xiao Qiao.But now she was going to get married. She will no longer be her mom. The more she thought about it, the more sad she became. She couldn't help come to Fang's house today.She didn't know what she wanted to do when she came over. Just wanted to come over and take a look. Just one glance was enough.\"Little Stutterer, what are you doing here?\" Suddenly, an unceremonious voice sounded behind him.Da Qiao was startled. She hastily turned around and saw Fang You Liang and Fang You Rou brothers staring at her.After Fang You Liang yelled out the words \"little stutterer,\" he regretted it. He hadn't forgotten the last time Da Qiao's grandmother put chicken poo on his face.But asking him to apologize for this was absolutely impossible!Fang You Rou remembered to eat but not the hits. He had already forgotten about being smeared with chicken poo. He glared at Da Qiao and declared, \"What are you doing?\"Da Qiao was a little worried that he would beat her and stepped back two steps: \"I came over to see Younger Sister.\"Fang You Liang's eyes suddenly widened. He stared at her as if he saw a ghost: \"You, why aren't you stuttering?\"Da Qiao nodded: \"En, my stuttering is gone. You can no longer call me little stutterer or my grandmother will beat you!\"Fang You Liang snorted coldly. He will absolutely not admit that he was afraid. Then he pointed to her face and asked: \"Why does your face seem to be whiter. Even whiter than Younger Sister Xiao Qiao! Did you steal the vanishing cream from home and smeared it on yourself? Shameless!\"Fang You Rou scratched his cheek with his little finger: \"Shameless!\"Da Qiao's face turned red. She defended herself: \"I didn't use vanishing cream on my face. I became white by myself!\"Fang You Liang made a cheeky face at her. He turned around and ran while yelling: \"Big fat liar!\u00a0 You used vanishing cream on your face!\"\"Big fat liar! Big fat liar!\" Fang You Rou kicked his short legs and ran after his elder brother.Xiao Qiao was in a daze in the yard. When her elder maternal cousin brother came in, she asked: \"Elder Maternal Cousin Brother, who were you talking to just now?\"Fang You Liang replied: \"Your elder sister, Da Qiao! I'm telling you, your elder sister doesn't stutter anymore! And her face became whiter. I suspect that she stole the adult's vanishing cream!\"Xiao Qiao became excited: \"Elder Maternal Cousin Brother, you mean my elder sister is outside now?\"Fang You Liang nodded. Before he could speak, Xiao Qiao turned into a gust of wind, rushed past him, and disappeared.He scratched his head and puzzledly muttered: \"When did those two sisters become so close?\"Xiao Qiao rushed out and saw Da Qiao's back gradually disappear. She shouted: \"Elder Sister, wait for me!\"Since consuming the jade bead water, Da Qiao's ears had become very sharp. Even though she was a little far away, she can still hear Younger Sister's voice.She stopped and turned around. As expected, she saw Younger Sister was rushing toward her.Xiao Qiao panted as she ran \"Elder Sister, why did you go so far so soon?\"How did Da Qiao go that far from the time her cousin came in to when she went out?Da Qiao can go that far was all thanks to the jade beads.Her calf was very strong now. She can walk fast and steadily. Even if she went to town by herself, it was no problem.However, she didn't plan to tell Younger Sister: \"Younger Sister, I just came to see you and Mom. Now I did, I'm going back.\"How could Xiao Qiao let her go so easily?She tilted her head, blinked her big eyes, and said with a sad look: \"Elder Sister, are you still angry with me?\"Da Qiao shook her head: \"I'm not angry.\"Grandmother said one should waste time on meaningless things like anger. Although she didn\u2019t understand her grandmother's words, she was a very obedient little cutie. So she won\u2019t be angry with her younger sister.Xiao Qiao frowned. She didn't know if it was her illusion. She had a feeling that Elder Sister had become smarter.She recalled her speculation of luck-snatching system and her eyes flashed: \"I have always wanted to find a chance to apologize to Elder Sister. Now that I know that Elder Sister isn't angry with me, I'm relieved.\"Da Qiao stared at her with big eyes: \"Younger Sister, have you finished talking? If you are finished, then I will go.\"After saying that, she turned around and left before Xiao Qiao could answer.Xiao Qiao: \"...\"Xiao Qiao grabbed her sleeve: \"Elder Sister, don't go. I still have something to ask you!\"Da Qiao stopped again: \"Younger Sister, what do you want to ask?\"Xiao Qiao cut right down to the topic: \"Elder Sister, are you bound to a system?\"Da Qiao looked confused: \" Younger Sister, I don't understand what you are saying?\"Xiao Qiao believed that she was pretending: \"Elder Sister, don't pretend. We're both thousand years fox demons. What is there to pretend?\"Da Qiao:?Da Qiao felt Younger Sister speaking strange words. She couldn't understand a word of what she said.\"Younger Sister, I really got to leave. Grandmother and Grandfather will be anxious.\" After that, she turned to depart again.Angered to death, Xiao Qiao stretched out her hand to grab Da Qiao's hand. Unexpectedly, she caught thin air!\"BOOM!\"She hadn't stood firmly. Her face welcomed to the ground first!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She fell down again!In two months, she fell three times. What's more, this time was more severe than the previous two!Not only did she ate a mouthful of mud, her lips and nose were scraped and three teeth fell off. This time it was all front teeth!Without the front teeth, everyone would definitely make fun of her. Truly exasperating to death!What was even more maddening was that she looked up and saw that Da Qiao didn't come to help her. Instead, she took two steps back!Her heart instantly became irritable: \"Elder Sister, aren't you going to help me up?\"Da Qiao blinked her big eyes and said softly: \"Younger Sister, you should stand up by yourself. I'm afraid that if someone sees, they will think it was me who pushed you!\"Xiao Qiao became angry that she turned into a puffer fish: \"...\"If it was the old Da Qiao, how could she be so cunning?She really got a cheat!At this moment, Qiao Family's members came over.When Qiao Xiu Zhi saw Xiao Qiao, she subconsciously thought she was bullying Da Qiao again: \"Xiao Qiao, didn't I warn you to bully your elder sister? It seems that you didn't take my words to heart!\"Xiao Qiao who was lying on the ground with a bloody face: \"...\"She almost exploded!For people who weren't favored, even breathing was wrong!Xiao Qiao didn't expect that one day she would taste this kind of experience!When Da Qiao saw her grandfather and her grandmother, her smile appeared at once, \"Grandfather, Grandmother, I was about to go back to see you! Grandmother, Younger Sister didn't bully me. She fell by herself. I told her stand up by herself!\"During this time, she and Elder Sister Dong He learned embroidery from her grandfather in the morning. In noon, it was cooking lesson with her grandfather. In the afternoon, she learnt five-animal exercises with her grandmother. She was extremely busy.Originally, Xue Chuan only planned to teach Da Qiao alone. But after thinking about it, he it was unfair. So he asked the other two granddaughters.Herding one sheep was herding, herding a group of sheep was also herding. They were all his granddaughters, so he can't be too biased.Qiao Dong He had a quiet and introverted temperament. She liked embroidery and cooking, while Qiao Dong Ying was a tomboy. Making her learn these two things was almost like killing her.So in the end only Da Qiao and Qiao Dong He studied.In order to prevent others from talking too much, Qiao Xiu Zhi told them not to talk about the embroidery matter. Even Wan Chun Ju didn't know that her daughter was learning embroidery.Qiao Xiu Zhi came over, picked Da Qiao up and spun her around to see if she was injured or not. Then she asked with eased: \"Why did you run to here alone?\"Da Qiao smiled sweetly at her grandmother: \"I'm in a bad mood. So I just come out to relax.\"\"Puchi......\" Qiao Dong Ying couldn't help laughing out, \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, how old are you? You're already saying you're in a bad mood. You are simply too cute!\"Mainly because she was a seven-year-old little pudding. It was amusing when she spoke like an adult.Da Qiao revealed her a small set of shell tooth: \"I also think I am cute, I'm Grandfather and Grandmother's little cutie!\"Qiao Dong Ying couldn't resist rolling her eyes: \"I know, I know. You are the cutest in the world, right?\"Younger Sister Da Qiao was very cute, but she was also vain!How can anyone say that they are cute?While Qiao Dong He's face became rosy from her little cousin sister's adorableness.Although she had a younger sister, Qiao Dong Ying had a boyish personality and always protect/eds her like a big brother. Making her lose her big sister feel.Seeing that no one came to help her for a long time, Xiao Qiao had to get up from the ground by herself.She almost vomit blood with hatred!She guessed right. Da Qiao must have gotten a system to snatch luck!Otherwise, how could a stutterer be cured all of a sudden and at the same time get so many people like her?That's right. All sorts of unlucky things have happened to Qiao Family during this period of time.Xiao Qiao wanted to remind Qiao Family. But when she saw her grandmother's face, she swallowed it back down.This old witch disliked her so much. Then let Da Qiao \"suck up\" their luck!Once Qiao Family met with great misfortune, they will regret it!As for her and her mom, they could only avoid Da Qiao before they found a better solution. This way, she shouldn't be able to rob their luck!\"Since you are injured, go back quickly. However...\" Qiao Xiu Zhi's pinned Xiao Qiao with a sudden fierce expression, \"I don't want to hear someone reversing attack, saying Da Qiao pushed you down or is a inherent curse. Since you are so smart, I believe you can understand me!\"After speaking, she took Da Qiao's hand and walked away with Qiao Family.Xiao Qiao: \"...\"So vexing!...Before spring ploughing, Fang Xiao Juan finally married into Wang Family.Fang Family's tails almost flew up to the sky!Especially old woman Fang. She must mention \"my in-laws\" whenever she talked. As if she was afraid that others won't know that they were in-laws with Wang Family.Someone who couldn't stand her, commented, \"Look at that old woman Fang. If old Madam Wang isn't still alive, she might think of marrying into Wang Family too!\"These words were a bit wicked.But the more wicked topic was, the more people liked to wag their tongue.Soon Wang Family heard this too. Old Madam Wang turned black with anger.Shameless! Already at this age and she still wanted to attract people!Old Madam Wang became angrier the more she thought about it. She lashed at old Mister Wang who was smoking a tobacco: \"I telling you, if you dare to get involved with that shameless old woman Fang, see if I won't scratch you to death!\"Old Madam Wang who squatted in the corner as he smoked his tobacco: \"...\"He was hiding in the corner. How could this pot hit him firmly on his head?Besides, he only had poor eyesight from old age. His mind wasn't flooded!Even if he had wandering thoughts, he won't look at that old woman, right?<Thinking of the wrinkled face of old woman Fang when she smiled, old Mister Wang suddenly felt that he wasn't well!Less than two days after Fang Xiao Juan married into Wang Family, Wang Shui Sheng received a letter from the army from the postman.In addition to some coupons and fifty yuan, there was also a thick letter.After reading the letter, Wang Shui Sheng walked into his parents' room with a serious face and stayed there for more than an hour before coming out.The next day, after everyone had breakfast, Wang Family announced a major news on the spot... Wang Family was going to split!Split the family?She only got married for three days and then the family separated. Wang Family did this on purpose?On the third day when she married into Qiao Family, that old witch Qiao Xiu Zhi had separated her and Qiao Zhen Jun from the family. Everyone in the village laughed at her and said Qiao Xiu Zhi would rather not have a son than accept her as a daughter-in-law!To strangers, they would assume that she, the daughter-in-law was terrible. She was separated out after three days of marriage. She was so furious at that time.Unexpectedly, the second marriage just started, and the same thing happened again!She would never allow such a thing to happen. Otherwise where would her, Fang Xiao Juan's face go in the future?She threw the mantou in her hand toward the old porcelain bowl and uttered with a cold expression: \"Dad, why do you want to split the family out of nowhere? Why didn't you talk about this before I marry in?\"Wang Xin Sheng, who sat on the side, gave her a push: \"What's with your attitude? Besides, even we didn't even know. Why should he tell you?\"Fang Xiao Juan was steaming mad but didn't dare to fight Wang Xin Sheng directly.In addition to Wang Shui Sheng, Wang Family's two sons were also dumbfounded: \"Dad, did we do something wrong?\"Except for Wang Xin Sheng and old Third Wang in the army, the other three sons were honest and down-to-earth people. In their opinion, the family don't separate when their parents are alive.But now that old Mister Wang declared the family separation, they subconsciously felt whether they had done something wrong.The few daughter-in-laws look at each other. They all had their own little thoughts in their hearts.Especially Liu Cui Hua. She almost screamed when old Mister Wang uttered the words, 'split the family'.She wanted to split a long time ago!Although the whole family was living in harmony, but when the teeth and tongue were fighting, it evitable for clash to occur within the big family.Especially there was a loafer younger brother at home. He was idle all day long and hers parent-in-laws pampered him. The best things were left to him. Even her son, the eldest grandson, had to stand back. After a long time, who wouldn't have any complaints in their heart?She glanced at her man and mentally grumbled that he didn't give her a head up beforehand!Old Mister Wang smoked his tobacco and stated, \"The tree is big, time to separate the branch. The adults are grown, it's time to split the family. The reason why we didn't mention it before was because the fifth one hadn't settle down. Since he is now also married, then you should separate out.\"Old Third and old Fourth were still unwilling: \"Dad, Mom, everyone is living well together. Why do you want to separate?\"Fang Xiao Juan was even more agitated: \"That's right. Dad, you can't separate!\"How was this splitting the family? More like splitting her face!Wang Xin Sheng glared at her again: \"You shut up! How can you speak here!\"Fang Xiao Juan was so angry that her chest hurts.Back then in Qiao Family, she had been separated out. Still, it was because of this, she was in charge of Qiao's small house. Qiao Zhen Jun never dared to say anything!However, now at Wang's house, she can't even say a word. This made her steaming mad!Fang Xiao Juan wanted to lose her temper, but Xiao Qiao pulled her sleeves.She turned her head and saw Xiao Qiao shaking her head at her.Xiao Qiao was surprised that old Mister Wang proposed the splitting the family. After all, Wang Family didn't separate until the death of the two elders in the previous life. Still, this matter wasn't a big deal.In the entire Wang Family, Wang Xin Sheng was the who was truly promising. Also, old Third Wang in the army. The other three were unpromising farmers till their deaths.After the separation, they only need to have a good relationship with old Third Wang.Although the family separation will wipe her mom's face on the floor, but in the long run, it was all benefit, no harm.Wang Shui Sheng noticed the movements between the mother and daughter and frowned slightly.Although old Second Wang, old Fourth Wang, Fang Xiao Juan, and others protested, old Mister Wang was the head of the family. No one could object to his decision. Therefore, Wang Family eventually separated.As soon as the news of Wang Family's separation spread out, it was like water entering a pan of hot oil. The whole Qili Village suddenly exploded!\"My god, this is the second time, right? The last time Fang Xiao Juan entered the door, she was separated out on the third day. This time, it's the third day too!\"\"This is cracking me up. I wonder if Fang Family's tail can still point up in the future when they find out!\"\"Tsk tsk tsk. If I was Fang Xiao Juan, I would definitely have no face to go out. Simply embarrassing to death!\"\"Tsk, you underestimate Fang Xiao Juan's face too much. If she knew what is embarrassment, she won't do anything like that!\"Someone smelled the gossip and rushed to ask: \"What did she do? Tell me!\"\"Not saying, not saying. Don't ask me about this. You will know soon!\"Fang Xiao Juan and Wang Xin Sheng got together before they got married. Although they did it very secretly, they couldn't hid it from people who specially paid attention.Due to the status of Wang Family, the person who discovered it was afraid to speak out. Though it couldn't be said clearly, it was fine to mention the shadow's tail.When Fang Xiao Juan heard the rumors outside, she almost miscarried from anger!She directed the fire at Xiao Qiao: \"Why did you stop me in the morning?\"\"Mom, calmly think about it. The separation of family is actually the most beneficial to us!\"Xiao Qiao rolled her eyes in her heart. Even if she didn't stop her, could she prevent Wang Family from separating?Simply dreaming during the day!Fang Xiao Juan was still puffing smoke: \"What advantage? Don't you know how lazy your Uncle Wang is? Even when the soy sauce bottle falls in front of him, he won't reach out and fix it. When we separate off, we'll be drinking northwest wind ah?\"Xiao Qiao wasn't worried at all: \"Mom, you think too much! Old Madam Wang dotes Uncle Wang so much, how could she just watch him drink northwest wind?\"Besides, Wang Xin Sheng will be the first person to be 10,000 yuan household in the village in the future. Even though it was a bit difficult now, what did it amount to?According to her, her mom should take the opportunity to 'share the joys and sorrows' with Wang Xin Sheng and win over his heart. In the future, won't she have the final say in this house?Xiao Qiao analyzed these words carefully to her mom.After Fang Xiao Juan listened to it, she mulled over it with her bird-size brain. Suddenly, she patted her thigh: \"Oh, my precious Jiao Jiao, why are you so smart! Mom will listen to you in the future!\"After figuring it out, Fang Xiao Juan stopped throwing a tantrum.Wang Family was very surprised that she thought it through so quickly....As the saying goes, the year's plan lied in spring. Spring ploughing was a major event for farmers. It was connected to whether the entire production team can get enough food for next year.Therefore, the production team leader, Wang Shui Sheng held a mobilization meeting\u00a0two days before spring ploughing.\"Spring ploughing is coming soon. In order to live up to the expectations of the party and the people, we must continue to display the spirit of not being afraid of hardship and tiredness. We must mobilize the everyone. I don't care how lazy you are normally, but during spring ploughing, no one is allowed to ask for leave!\"\"Fellow community members, whether you can have enough food next year depends on your following efforts! Diligence is the right hand of happiness, thrift is the left hand of happiness. Extend your right hand and let us start this spring ploughing battle with one heart!\"Standing on the stage, Wang Shui Sheng roared until the vein in his neck bulged and his saliva flew.Most of the members below were high-spirited and full of energy. As if they were filled to the brim with strength and can't wait to immediately participate the spring ploughing battle!The above applied to the vast majority of people. It still meant that some people sneakily absent-minded.One of them was Lin Hui.Lin Hui was standing in the corner. Behind her right hand stood Qiao Family. Da Qiao had also came over.She wore a small red cotton jacket. On her head was two small buns. Her face was like powdered with jade. Her whole appearance completely changed. So fair and tender that people could hardly recognize her.When she walked over hand in hand of her grandmother, it caused quite a stir.Everyone surrounded her in amazement and asked Qiao Xiu Zhi why Da Qiao became so beautiful in a blink of an eye. What was even bizarre was that her stuttering had completely gone!Qiao Xiu Zhi only calmy explained that the children had one look each day. As for the rest, she didn't say much.After the mobilization meeting began, everyone's attention was distracted.However, Lin Hui's gaze couldn't be removed from Da Qiao.She really liked Da Qiao, who was well-behaved and sensible.She had thought countless times that if this child was hers, she would definitely pamper her until she was padded by her heart.This liking had nothing to do with Qiao Zhen Jun. But because of the rumors between her and Qiao Zhen Jun, she dared not approach her as much as before for a long time.Now she saw her living so well and become so beautiful and lovely, she was happy for her from the bottom of her heart.At the same time, her heart was itching. She wanted to know how that person was now.She had been persuading herself to forget Qiao Zhen Jun before. However, the news of Fang Xiao Juan's remarriage spread. As if a stone was thrown, her heart rippled again.Little Dong Lin, whose hand was by Lin Hui, kept sneakily glance at his Elder Sister Qiao Qiao. He saw Elder Sister Qiao Qiao was holding hand with a little boy similar age to him. His lips pouted and felt aggrieved within.Elder Sister Qiao Qiao had another boy. Did she not like him anymore?Da Qiao didn't notice her ocean king behavior had accidentally hurt a little boy's heart.After the mobilization meeting, Qiao Xiu Zhi went to Wang Shui Sheng to discuss something.This year, Qiao Family had an addition of two adults, Chen Qiao Qiao and Qiao Hong Xia. If they want to work, she must notify to Wang Shui Sheng in advance.Wang Shui Sheng had known about Qiao Hong Xia\u2019s divorce: \u201cIf Hong Xia wants to be allocated food from our production team and earn work points, she must first move her household registration back to our production team.\u201dQiao Xiu Zhi knew about this: \"This is no problem. I will let her do it in these two days. It will be done before the spring ploughing.\"Although Qiao Hong Xia hadn't inherited her supernatural strength, her strength wasn't small. She could do ordinary tasks. So Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't plan to walk her through the back door and do some easy work.Besides, as a divorced woman, she shouldn't go through the back door at this time. Otherwise the saliva of the villagers could drown her.She came to see Wang Shui Sheng this time mainly for the two daughter-in-laws.Most of rural women were in good health. Even when they were pregnant, they have to work in the field. However, Wan Chun Ju had severe morning sickness recently. Almost to the point where she vomited what she ate. This time, she can only take a leave during this spring ploughing.Wang Shui Sheng had just said no one was allowed to ask for leave, but now Wan Chun Ju vomited to this degree. He had no reason to make her go to the field. He nodded and said: \"Alright then. If she get better later, I will arrange something light for her to do then.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi was a little surprised that Wang Shui Sheng was so easy-going. Still, her face remained calm: \"Then I will trouble you. Lastly, my youngest daughter-in-law.\"Although Chen Qiao Qiao wasn't pregnant, she was so thin that a gust of wind could blow her down. Before Old Fifth returned to the town, he asked her to request a light job from Wang Shui Sheng.Wang Shui Sheng rubbed his chin as he thought for a while, \"Auntie Xiu Zhi, you came a bit late. Many types of work have been arranged. However, there is a shortage of people on the pig farm. The work isn't tiring, but it is a little dirty. I don\u2019t know if your youngest daughter-in-law can accept it?\"He noticed that Qiao Family's youngest daughter-in-law was a town girl. Not to mention raising pigs, she probably hadn't even touched a hoe before. This was why he phrased it like that.Qiao Xiu Zhi finalized the decision: \"Then let her take on the pig farm work!\"Marry a chicken, follow a chicken; marry a dog, follow a dog. Since she had already married to a farmer family, why be afraid of getting dirty?After Qiao Xiu Zhi left, Liu Cui Hua came over. She used\u00a0her elbow\u00a0to touch her man and spoke, \"Why are you so easy-going today?\"The power of the production team leader was still quite large. He can directly assign all the work. No one in the village dared to offend Wang Family for fear of being assigned to dirty and tiring work.Those in the village who want light jobs must say it many days in advance and bring something. Qiao Xiu Zhi was the first to walk through the back door empty-handed.She wasn't thinking too much and assumed that her man liked someone from Qiao Family. Wang Family didn't have much friendship with Qiao Family, so she was so curious now.While do the log, Wang Shui Sheng answered, \"In the future, avoid interacting with Song Jin Lai's wife. Don't associate too much with old Fifth's wife. While, you can get along with Qiao Family more.\"The person with the best brain in Wang Family was old Third Wang, who was in the army. Wang Shui Sheng knew that his brain wasn't as good as his younger brother. So after Fang Xiao Juan\u2019s incident happened, he immediately wrote a letter to the army and told his younger brother the situation in great detail.The last letter from old Third Wang mentioned two important things. One was to split Wang Family and the other was to advise his elder brother to have more contact with Qiao Family.In old Third Wang's opinion, Qiao Family, especially Qiao Xiu Zhi, got the drive. They can decisively get their son to divorce Fang Xiao Juan. That's why, the children brought up by this kind of parents will definitely do well.Wang Shui Sheng's IQ wasn't high, but he was willing to listen to his younger brother. This was the reason why he made it convenient for Qiao Family just now.However, he didn't tell his wife the reason.Liu Cui Hua saw that her man didn't want to say, so she didn't continue to ask. In the days to follow, she complied to what her man said....Qiao Hong Xia took the two children back to Qiao Family's small house. At the entrance, they encountered Zhao Jie Fang again.There was a reason for the 'again'. Since the day of the divorce, Zhao Jie Fang came to Qiao Family's small house every day.People in the village saw this. All kind of words were said. Majority was that she was cruel.Zhao Jie Fang's eyes were crimson. Like he went through thick and thin. When he saw her, his eyes instantly brightened: \"Hong Xia, can you speak to me? Not seeing you mother and son these days, my heart feel... unbearable.\"The house was empty. He can no longer hear the cheers and laughter of the child. No one will wash and cook for him. He felt too heartbroken to eat and sleep these days. So he wanted to quickly bring his wife and son back home.Qiao Hong Xia didn't even look at him. She walked directly past him and then closed the door directly in front of him with a \"bang\".Zhao Jie Fang cradled his head and squatted at the door. His voice choked: \"Hong Xia, come back with me! I really know that I was wrong! I really know that I was wrong!\"People passing by were discussing about it in a flurry.Wan Chun Ju commented: \"I really didn't expect that old Third Zhao to be so attached. It has been seven-eight days. He came here every day. I say, Hong Xia's heart is too cruel...\"Before he finished speaking, Qiao Xiu Zhi's gaze shot over. Wan Chun Ju looked like an old hen pinched by her neck and couldn't say a word.Qiao Zhen Guo sighed, \"Wife, why do you like be nosy like a dog biting mice. If you are really bored, how about follow us to the field and work?Wan Chun Ju's face went beetroot red: \"... Zhen Guo, have you forgotten my morning sickness?\"In a woman's whole life, the only time she can be lazy was during the period of pregnancy. She didn't want to work in the field!Qiao Zhen Guo sighed again when he heard these words: \"I knew earlier, I shouldn't have married you. You eat so much and you can't go to the field to earn work points when pregnant. It's really a loss!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...Qiao Zhen Guo, what do you mean? I am pregnant for your Qiao Family. It's enough that you don't care about us, mother and son. Now you disdain me for eating too much! If I knew earlier, I shouldn't have this baby! \"Qiao Zhen Guo nodded: \"Come to think of it, this is also your fault. We already have three children. Why are you pregnant with one more?\"Wan Chun Ju's breath was stuck and nearly miscarried from anger!What did he mean by 'also her fault'? Can she decide whether to be pregnant or not?If he had the ability, he shouldn't get on her bed!Qiao Xiu Zhi listened to the conversation between the husband and wife and wished she could plug her ears with two pieces of cotton!After returning to Qiao Family's old house, Chen Qiao Qao knew that she was going to raise pigs. Immediately, she was like struck by lightning: \"Mom, you... want me to raise pigs?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi raised her eyebrows: \"Why? You aren't happy? If you aren't happy, then go to work with us in the field. Think about it by yourself.\"After that, she didn't bother to pay attention to her daughter-in-law's brows that was so pinched that it could trap flies. She turned around and went to her own garden.Since Chen Qiao Qiao wasn't pleased, Wan Chun Ju was happy.She flamboyantly looked at the other party and said: \"Qiao Qiao ah, raising pigs is wonderful. It's not tiring at all. You just shovel pig poo every day. I really envy you.\"Chen Qiao Qiao bit her lip: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, if you are envious, you can go with me!\"Wan Chun Ju became even more proud. She rubbed her belly and uttered: \"Oh, I also want to. But who told me to be pregnant with Qiao Family's golden grandson!\"Chen Qiao Qiao gnashed her teeth with fury!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was time to meet little Brother Dong Lin again.Da Qiao had six candies and two eggs in her pocket and was about to go out.But as soon as she walked out of the room, she ran into two obstacles.\"Gugu!\"\"Woof woof!\"A chicken and a dog guarded the door of her room. Their expressions were baby fierce.Da Qiao softly urged: \"I'm not going to my grandparent's. So I can't take you there, understand?\"\"Gugu!\"\"Woof woof!\"Da Qiao thought they understood and walked past them.Unexpectedly, a chicken and a dog followed behind her like a flower-protector and wouldn't go back no matter what. Da Qiao had no choice but to let them follow.Everyone couldn't help laughing when they saw this scene.Some women, who had no daughters, took in how fair and tender Da Qiao grew and their hearts felt itchy.\"Da Qiao is become more and more better-looking. I will be satisfied if my daughter is half as good-looking as her in the future!\"\"Oh, don't you think Da Qiao look like the prosperous baby in the New Year picture?\"At this age, one or two New Year paintings were present in someone's house. Even if they didn't own one, they had at least seen it in another's home.At this moment, they Da Qiao wearing a red cotton-padded jacket. On her head was two small buns. And those big eyes and small red lips! Her skin was fair and tender as if one could pinch water out.It was fine, if they didn't mention it. But now, they brought it up, the more she looked like one. Everyone started revolved around the topic 'prosperous baby'.Liu Cui Hua jollily remarked, \"A child who looks like a prosperous baby must also be a blessed child. Look, didn't her stutter get cured?\"Everyone nodded and felt that the child wasn't as unbearable as Fang Xiao Juan said.Fang Xiao Juan returned from picking vegetables from her own garden. She happened to hear this and immediately mocked: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, don't talk nonsense if you don't have knowledge. What prosperous baby? Have you ever seen a prosperous baby who almost killed her mom and sister when she was born? \"Liu Cui Hua was furious: \"The mouth is grown on me. I can say what I want. You can't control it!\"Fang Xiao Juan instantly ignited: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, we are one family. Instead of helping me to speak, you are helping that calamity. What is your intention?\"Liu Cui Hua did have \"intentions\".Since her man said those words last time, she had intentionally or unintentionally getting along with Qiao Family. She had the intention of getting on Qiao Family's good side when she spoke of Da Qiao being blessed just now.Seeing her reaction, Fang Xiao Juan became more and more convinced that she was guilty: \"I heard that Eldest Sister-in-law often went to Qiao's small house these two days. Could it be that Eldest Sister-in-law... have thoughts toward Qiao Family's paralyzed man?\"These words were overboard!Rural women were always talkative. If these word spreads out, it will be like one have fallen into the yellow mud, but other will insist it was poo when it isn't!\"Talk nonsense! Then go talk nonsense! You don't respect yourself and also think everyone is as cheap as you?\"Liu Cui Hua was completely infuriated. She jumped up with a \"whoosh\", grabbed Fang Xiao Juan's hair, raised her big hand and swung out two slaps.Fang Xiao Juan was caught off guard. Her face distorted from the slap and her cheeks quickly turned red and swollen: \"Liu Cui Hua, you dare to hit me? That's it!\"She reached out and grabbed Liu Cui Hua's hair. The two quickly scuffled into a ball.Liu Cui Hua was a good hand at farm work, so how Fang Xiao Juan be her opponent. She was quickly suppressed under Liu Cui Hua's body.On the side, Xiao Qiao anxiously jumped: \"Mom, Eldest Aunt, don't fight! Everyone is one family. You guys being like this is letting people watch a joke?\"During this time, she felt more and more that her mom was like a pig teammate!A good card was smashed rotten by her!Simply pissing her off to death!Some people went up to pull them away. While some people gloatingly watched the play: \"Xiao Qiao, you open mouth and say one family. Then what does Qiao Family count as? Qiao Family did raise you for so many years. Now you change the way of addressing just like this? Isn't it a bit too white-eyed wolf?\"\"Ain't that right? Previously, Fang Family said Da Qiao is a white-eyed wolf before. I feel Xiao Qiao is the real heartless child. Qiao Family didn't wronged her. But as soon as old Second Qiao is paralyzed, she immediately followed her mom away!\"Xiao Qiao was so mad that her nose was crooked!A group of village women with broken mouths. Whether she have any conscience or not was no concern of theirs!After Liu Cui Hua was pulled away, she glared at Fang Xiao Juan and spat on the ground, \"Let me hear your nonsense next time and I'll beat you!\"Fang Xiao Juan was lying on the ground. Her hair was messy like a chicken coop, her cheeks were red and swollen. There were several nail marks on her face.She was trembling with anger and was about to scold her when she suddenly felt a pain in her stomach.She screamed \"Ouch\" as she clutched her stomach.At first everyone thought that Fang Xiao Juan was acting until a woman with sharp eyes saw the blood on her trousers and yelled: \"You are bleeding! Fang Xiao Juan, your trousers are bloody!\"Bleeding?Liu Cui Hua's heart dropped and then she remembered Fang Xiao Juan's pregnancy. Her face was as white as paper....Da Qiao didn't know that after she left, her mom fought someone because of her.At this moment, she came to the East Forest with Gu Gu and Pi Pi. Like last time, she made a cuckoo sound toward the tree.But after calling several times, there was no response.She frowned. Did little Brother Dong Lin not come over?Her gaze swept around and saw that there was no one. So she walked towards the other end with her short legs.She thought that little Brother Dong Lin hadn't come, but when she walked over, she unexpectedly saw a little one sitting under the big tree. His red eyes was in midst of spilling golden drops.Da Qiao was startled and asked anxiously, \"Little Brother Dong Lin, what's wrong with you? Did someone bully you?\"Xiao Dong Lin swept her a grieved glance and turned around with a harrumph. Leaving a little butt facing her.Da Qiao:\"\u2026\u2026\"What happened to little Brother Dong Lin?Why did it seem like he was mad at her?\"Little Brother Dong Lin, what's wrong? Are you angry with Elder Sister Qiao Qiao?\"Da Qiao coaxed for a while, but little Dong Lin remained silent.She could only stand up and pretend to walk away: \"Little Brother Dong Lin, since you don't want to talk to me, then I can only leave.\"Hearing that she was leaving, little Dong Lin immediately became anxious. He turned around and grabbed her sleeve and accusingly asked, \"Elder Sister Qiao Qiao, do you not like little Dong Lin anymore?\"Da Qiao hurriedly shook her head: \"No. Little Brother Dong Lin is so cute, how could I not like you?\"Little Dong Lin finally revealed a smile on his face when he heard this.But thinking of how Elder Sister Qiao Qiao held hands with the little boy that day, he still felt very aggrieved: \"But you have other cuties, so you don't like this cutie!\"It dawned on Da Qiao. So little Brother Dong Lin was jealous.She quickly took out milk candy and eggs from her pocket: \"Look, these are all for you. If Elder Sister Qiao Qiao doesn't like you, why would I save them for you?\"Little Dong Lin's black eyes instantly lit up. His brows and eyes curled along with his smile: \"Little Dong Lin likes Elder Sister Qiao Qiao the most. Elder Sister Qiao Qiao, you are so nice!\"Da Qiao saw that little Brother Dong Lin became happy, she merrily responded: \"I also like little Brother Dong Lin.\"It didn't contain the word \"most\". Little Dong Lin was a little dissatisfied and pouted his small mouth, \"Then compared with small eyes?\"Small Eyes?Little Brother Dong Lin should be talking about little Brother Yi Ming right?She reached out and poked his little face with a smile: \"You are all cute. Elder Sister Qiao Qiao like you all!\"Little Dong Lin was still dissatisfied with this answer, but dropped it. As long as Elder Sister Qiao Qiao still liked him, it was fine: \"Then Elder Sister Qiao Qiao can't like him more than little Dong Lin. Otherwise... little Dong Lin will cry!\"Da Qiao felt that little Brother Dong Lin's threat was so cute. So cute that her heart melted.Little Dong Lin came home happily with the candy and eggs. This happened to be seen by his mom again.But after the last incident, Lin Hui no longer dared to carelessly accuse him: \"Did you go to meet your elder sister Qiao Qiao again?\"Little Dong Lin nodded. His eyebrows curved: \"Elder Sister Qiao Qiao is the best. Look, this is the candy and eggs that Elder Sister Qiao Qiao gave me!\"Lin Hui looked at the candy and eggs in his hand and solemnly asked, \"Dong Lin, do you want Elder Sister Qiao Qiao to become your real elder sister?\"Little Dong Lin tilted his head. His delicate brows knitted together: \"What does it mean to become a real elder sister?\"Lin Hui suddenly felt her mouth was a little dry.She licked her lips and replied, \"That... Do you want to live with your elder sister Qiao Qiao in the future? Play together and go to school together.\" Be a family for a lifetime.Little Dong Lin's eyes became as bright as the stars in the sky and he nodded wildly: \"Yes, yes! Little Dong Lin wants to live with Elder Sister Qiao Qiao! Play together and go to school together!\"He liked Elder Sister Qiao Qiao the most. But his mom and grandma told him not to casually go to play with Elder Sister Qiao Qiao, otherwise others will speak ill of Elder Sister Qiao Qiao.He didn't like others speaking ill of Elder Sister Qiao Qiao. So they can only meet secretly in the woods. He didn't like this though.Lin Hui patted his head, as if she had made up her mind: \"Mom knows. I will definitely find a way to let you live with Elder Sister Qiao Qiao.\"...After Fang Xiao Juan bleed, Liu Cui Hua didn't dare to delay no matter how much she hated her. She immediately sent her to the health center.After examination, the doctor at the health center said that Fang Xiao Juan had signs of miscarriage. So she should properly nurture it in the following days. If not, the baby can't be preserved.These words made the villagers, who came with them and heard it clearly, wiggled brows at each other and ate another mouthful of melon.After returning, they immediately sang about it to the public.The villagers of Qili Village said that they had eaten melons twice in the past three days. It was stuffing them to death!Some people recalled that someone said about Fang Xiao Juan being shameless before and immediately realized that Fang Xiao Juan had gotten together with Wang Xin Sheng long ago!It was unknown whether the two got together before Fang Xiao Juan's divorce, or after the divorce. If before the divorce, tsk tsk tsk. A big problem!But whether before or after the divorce, the fact that Fang Xiao Juan was a slut cannot be changed.Hearing the rumors outside, Fang Xiao Juan was so angry that she almost vomited blood.What made her vomit blood even more was that none of Wang Family blamed Liu Cui Hua. Instead, they blamed her for having a broken mouth.She thought that her man, Wang Xin Sheng would stand by her side. Unexpectedly, he put down fierce words. Told her not to cause trouble again in the future, otherwise she would be divorced and returned to her maternal home!Her chest ached from fury.It was driving her mad. What kind of broken life was this!Qiao Family had heard about Fang Xiao Juan's pregnancy and became even more disgusted with her.Only Qiao Zhen Jun was solemn for a day.It was unknown whether he was sad because of Fang Xiao Juan, or because his man's self-esteem getting hurt.Qiao Family had no time to study his mood, because the spring ploughing finally arrived.The villagers gave up their gossip and threw themselves into farm work.One get what they sow.If one didn't want to be hungry next year, this spring ploughing was very important. So no matter how lazy one was, they became serious these days.The Qili villagers were very busy.Compared with the autumn harvest, spring ploughing was easier. Still, it was also very tiring.The temperature in spring was still very cool. However, they can't wear too much clothes when they work in the field, otherwise they. After taking off their clothes, one by one, they trembled as they entered the field. Soon they were scorched by the sun until it almost peeled off a layer of skin.And the land. After a whole winter of wind and frost, the land had become dry and hard. It was very difficult to plough. If one was as powerless as a chicken, they can't do this work!At this time, everyone especially liked to work with Qiao Xiu Zhi.Inherent supernatural strength wasn't a random talk. To a person with a punch that can kill more than 200 jin wild boar, loosening the soil was nothing in her eyes.Qiao Xiu Zhi was in good health and she was hardworking and diligent. With a hoe, she swung a few times and the soil was soon loosened.Although spring ploughing was very tiring, everyone was very focused. No one complained, except for Fang Family.Fang Family thought that after they became in-laws with Wang Family, they could do whatever type of work they wanted. They get to choose the work in the entire production team.They even told some people that if they wanted something easy, they could help them get the job.Some people, who didn't have much connection with Wang Family, went to Fang Family with gifts and asked them to help after hearing this. Fang Family patted their chest and assured that there would be no problem.The results?Forget about other people. Even Fang Family was arranged to do the most tiring work!Fang Family was so angry that their noses were crooked. They ran to Wang's home to demand an explanation. However, Wang Family couldn't be bothered with them.Old woman Fang patted her thigh and threatened Wang Family, saying that if they didn't do what she said, she would get her daughter divorce Wang Xin Sheng!Not only was Wang Family not afraid, they were smiling in delight. They urged her to quickly take Fang Xiao Juan back!Old woman Fang was stunned.This was completely different from the expected chicken and dog ascending to heaven!Those who wanted to go through the back door saw that Wang Family did not buy it and all demanded Fang Family to spit out the things they gifted.Spitting out the things they have pocketed was simply cutting old woman Fang's flesh!Old woman Fang was so infuriated that her chest hurt.She laid on bed for two days. She didn't get out of bed until the spring ploughing began.After all morning's work, old woman Fang's back hurt as if it was about to break. She couldn't stand up straight.As soon as the production supervisor walked away, she hurriedly sat at the side to laze around. She glared at Qiao Xiu Zhi as she hammered her waist, \"I don't know what that woman grew up on. How is she so strong?\"The two were about the same age. She was exhausted to death, while Qiao Xiu Zhi seemed to be fine. More vitality than a young man's body!It was really enviable!At this moment, Da Qiao came over with a kettle in hand.What is this bun called?She was skipping as go. The two little buns on her head shook with her skipping. It was simply adorable to look at.All the way, everyone, who saw her cute appearance, couldn't help but feel their heart soften.Someone took the initiative to greet her: \"Da Qiao, what are you doing here? Everyone is working. This is not a place to play.\"Da Qiao raised the kettle in her hand and smiled sweetly: \"Auntie, I'm not here to play. I'm here to bring water to Grandfather, Grandmother, Eldest Uncle, and Fourth Aunt. They have worked hard.\"When everyone heard her words, they praised her for her filial piety.When Da Qiao heard the compliments, she smiled even more happily. Her eyebrows curved and eyes became crescent.When passing the area where old woman Fang worked, old woman Fang stopped her in her coarse voice: \"Da Qiao, give me the kettle in your hand!\"Da Qiao ran away into the distance with a 'thump thump thump' before turning back and replied, \"This is for my grandfather and grandmother. Not for you!\"Old woman Fang was steaming mad!She jumped up and slapped her thighs as she scolded: \"You little bastard! A white-eyed wolf with no conscience! I am your biological grandma! What's wrong with letting me drink water? You are so unconscionable. Be careful of getting struck by lightning!\"Some people couldn't stand it and stepped in, \"Da Qiao already said it's for her grandfather and grandmother. If you wanted to drink it, shouldn't you ask your grandson to send it over?\"Old woman Fang firmed her neck and tuck, \"My precious grandson is born to enjoy happiness. The work like delivering water can only done by worthless girls!\"Hearing old woman Fang's words, everyone sneered in their hearts.The whole Fang Family was spoiled by old woman Fang.Fang Fu Gui was a couch potato. In previous years, he had no broken leg and wouldn't work in the fields. He asked for a leave every few days.Fang Fu Gui didn't have to work anymore. There was no need to mention the grandsons, Fang You Liang and Fang You Rou. Usually at home, even the meals were prepared and placed in front of them by old woman Fang.This Fang Family was supported by old Fang and Fang Fu Gui's wife.Of course, old woman Fang had raised a few good daughters. After they got married, they would sneakily bring back things to their maternal home from time to time. Otherwise, Fang Family would have starved to death!Tsk tsk tsk. It was said that Fang Fu Gui's wife had suffered from eight lifetimes of bad luck. When she married, she was a fresh youthful girl. Now she was only 30 years old. However, she looked like a forty-year-old person.Old woman Fang was mad that Da Qiao wouldn't listen to her. But she was afraid that Qiao Xiu Zhi would hear her. So she only dared to curse in a low voice.The production supervisor came over. Old woman Fang quickly stood up.Probably due to getting up in a hurry, she tripped over something under her feet, staggered, and fell down on the ridge.'BANG!'Everyone looked up and saw that old woman Fang had her face plunged into the mud mound and her butt raised high. She was lying on the ground in a funny and weird posture.Someone couldn't help burst into laughter with 'puchi': \"I say, old woman Fang, what are you doing with your ass so high?\"Old woman Fang was so angry that she almost vomited blood.Fang Fu Gui's wife froze for a moment before she hurried over to help her mother-in-law up.Old woman Fang grabbed her hand and stood up. Suddenly a 'crack' was heard...The next moment, she screamed like a slaughtered pig: \"Ouch, my old waist!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sound of slaughtered pigs kept sounding all the way.Some people felt that old woman Fang deserved it!That mouth was so stinky. Da Qiao didn't give her water, so she cursed her to get struck by lightning. Look, the Heaven can't stand it anymore!A married woman named Xing Hua spun her pair of upturned eyes and made a snide remark: \"Don't you think it's strange. Both Fang Xiao Juan and old woman Fang's mishap only happened after they encountered Da Qiao. Tsk tsk tsk. That Da Qiao is really evil. Whoever gets close to her gets unlucky!\"Liu Cui Hua spat: \"It was me who beat Fang Xiao Juan. I was present when old woman Fang had an accident. You might as well say I was the who brought them misfortune!\"A few women nodded one after another: \"We were all there at the time. Nothing happened to us.\"Xing Hua gritted her teeth angrily.She didn't really want to target Da Qiao.Back then, she was interested in Qiao Zhen Min. While Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't like her. Later, when Qiao Zhen Min married that ugly woman, Chen Qiao Qiao, her dissatisfaction grew in her heart.It was just that she didn't dare to go head on against Liu Cui Hua.If she offended Wang Family, her mother-in-law would beat her with a rolling pin until she couldn't get out of bed for three days and three nights!She turned around with a harrumph. She raised her hoe and smashed it down against a piece of soil. The soil was smashed open. But the hoe's force didn't stop there and smashed its head on her foot.\"Ouch!\" She screamed in pain and looked down. Immediately, she yelled out like the way old woman Fang did, \"Blood! My foot is bleeding!\"Everyone looked over.Aiya, this is shocking. The blood dyed the cloth shoes red in just a moment.Still, it serve her right. Just loosen the soil! Why did she use that much force?One just got hurt and left. Now another!After Wang Shui Sheng found out, his face stunk like a stinky ditch.Da Qiao saw that her grandma got injured, but she wasn't worried about her. To her, old woman Fang was no different from a stranger.Qiao Xiu Zhi heard that something had happened at this from a distance. When she saw Da Qiao coming over, she scanned her and spoke, \"Why are you delivering the water? Where is your cousins?\"Da Qiao handed over the kettle and said softly, \"I want to come here myself. I haven't seen Grandfather and Grandmother for a long time. I miss you.\"Spring ploughing was too laborious. She was afraid that her grandfather and grandmother would not be able to bear it. So she threw jade beads into the water they were drinking these days.The fair and tender little dumpling stared at you like a pair of doe like eyes as she said sweetly that she missed you. Who can stand it?Qiao Xiu Zhi's heart softened. She took off the straw hat on her head and used it as a fan on her while saying, \"The water has been brought here. You can go back quickly. Don't come out at noon in the future. Let your elder cousin brother deliver the water. \"When the people around heard this, they all felt that Qiao Xiu Zhi was really a weird person.An Ping was the only grandson in Qiao Family. Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't dote her grandson, but instead, she doted her granddaughter. No wonder Zhen Guo's wife was full of grievances.Da Qiao softly agreed. After thinking about it, she tilted her head and said, \"Grandfather, Grandmother, I'll go back and cook green mung bean soup for you. Drink it after you get off work!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi frowned: \"You are still young, don't go to the kitchen alone. Go back and let your eldest aunt cook.\"In Qiao Xiu Zhi's view it was natural to let Wan Chun Ju do some housework as she didn't go to work in the fields because of morning sickness and stayed at home every day.But when Wan Chun Ju found out, she was extremely upset.Wan Chun Ju felt that Da Qiao was too chicken sly. Da Qiao pleased her in-laws, while it was her who do the job!That kid was so cunning at a young age. What will she be like once she grow up?Thinking how her in-laws pampered treated that kid like a precious during this time, she felt as uncomfortable like her flesh had been cut.The more she looked at Da Qiao, the more she became unpleasant to the eye: \"Eat, eat, eat! Only know to eat! You come to our house all day to eat and drink for free. Don't you know what's the situation is like at home?\"Da Qiao was stunned about getting scolded and felt a little aggrieved in her heart: \"I didn't eat for free. I helped my grandfather and grandmother do chores!\"In addition to coming over to learning things from her grandparents, she also helped with some housework. Such as sweeping the floor, cleaning the chicken coop, and going to the private garden to help catch insects.Wan Chun Ju sneered: \"Just that little work. Do you think we can't do it without you?\"She had two daughters. And Chen Qiao Qiao was at home. Who can't do it?On the contrary, Qiao Zhen Jun and Da Qiao came here from time to time to cheat food and drink, Shameless!She had lived for 30 years and had only heard about family separation. Not about family reuniting. Although her mother-in-law never mentioned bringing Qiao Zhen Jun back to the family, what was the difference between this situation and family reuniting?In addition to Qiao Zhen Jun, there was also Qiao Hong Xia. What kind of Qiao!Who didn't have any conflict with each other in their marriage? The anger will pass after a while. Her man came every day, but Qiao Hong Xia remained cold-hearted and refused to go back.Don't Qiao Hong Xia need to eat or drink when she came back?And her stupid son ran after Da Qiao every day. It was really annoying!A swarm of giant locusts!The more she thought about it in the kitchen alone, the more angrier she became. She was banging and slamming as did her work. It sounded like a ping-pong match.When Qiao Dong Ying heard it, she couldn't help but curled her lips, \"What's up with Mom again?\"Everyone was living a good life, while she was grumbling every day. If it was up to her, her grandmother should teach her a good lesson!Qiao Dong He saw her commenting her mom like this and felt it wasn't good if someone else heard her. So she hit her once and lectured, \"Don't talk nonsense!\"Although Qiao Dong Ying was not afraid of what others said, she still listened to her elder sister's words. She greeted Da Qiao: \"That little cutie over there, do you want to go pick wild vegetables with us?\"Da Qiao was gloomy after being scolded. Hearing what her elder cousin sister's words, she quickly nodded her head like a pecking chick, \"Little Cutie want to go!\"On the side, Little Yi Ming heard this. He raised his paws and declared in his baby voice, \"Little cutie's little brother, Little Little Cutie also want to go!\"Qiao Dong Ying: \"...\"Why are her younger siblings so thick cheek?Qiao Dong He took in how her younger sister was choked into speechlessness and burst into laughter.So each person went out with a basket.Before going out, Qiao Dong He had specially asked their youngest cousin sister, Qiao Dong Wan, if she wanted to go with everyone.Qiao Dong Wan squatted under an old tree. With a big head and a small body, her eyes fixed on the ants on the ground. Motionless.Qiao Dong He asked a few times. Still, Qiao Dong Wan never looked up at her. Nor did she look at anyone else.A long time after walking out of Qiao's old house, Qiao Dong Ying rubbed her nose and spoke, \"Elder Sister, do you think little Wan'er is a little odd?\"Qiao Dong He naturally had the same feel.Youngest Cousin Sister was four years old. Generally, children at this age loved to cry and laugh. Quite lively. But little Wan'er was different from all children.Since coming back, little Wan'er had never played with anyone. And they rarely heard her speak. If they hadn't heard her cry before, they would have thought she was a mute!She often squatted under the tree alone and watched the ants move home. If someone hadn't called her, she could stay still all day.They had seen quiet children, but they always felt that little Wan'er was a little different.Take little Yi Ming as an example. Although his brain was burned silly and can't remember things, his personality had no problem. Especially when he liked to follow his elder sister Nian Nian like a little tail.Unable to think of a reason, the two sisters had no choice but to not ponder about it.Wan Chun Ju was fuming for half a day and noticed that no one came over to help her out. They had all ran away. This made her anger burn more.She dumped the firewood into the earthen stove with strength. Unexpectedly, her aim was terrible. The firewood bounced back on the stove and hit her forehead.\"Ouch!\" Wan Chun Ju gasped in pain. Her forehead throbbed.She ran back to the room and looked in the mirror. F***, there was a big swollen lump!So infuriating!Day by day, nothing was going smoothly!...Spring flowers will bloom.The weather was getting warmer day by day. Wild vegetables and flowers were growing in the forest. There were many children picking wild vegetables like them.When others saw Qiao Family's children, they couldn't help but stare at Da Qiao.Children in the countryside ran around all over the mountains and fields. Their skin was usually not very fair. However, Da Qiao seem to be so fair that she can shine. Standing between her two elder cousin sisters and a younger cousin brother, she was so white that she stood out!It was as if a white steamed bun was suddenly placed in a pile of black wheat buns. People can notice even when they didn't want to.When Da Qiao saw that everyone was looking at her, she was not angry. She revealed a sweet smile to others.Everyone saw how cute and pretty she was smiling, they couldn't help but return a smile at her.Of course, some children remembered their family's orders and stayed away from Da Qiao in fear of being contaminated by her bad luck.After walking for a while, a lot of wild vegetables and mushrooms have been collected in the basket.Suddenly Qiao Dong Ying nudged Da Qiao's hand and said, \"Little Cutie, look. Not Cute also came to pick wild vegetables!\"Not Cute?Hearing this name, Da Qiao was paused for a moment. When she looked up, she realized that her elder cousin sister was talking about her younger sister, Xiao Qiao.Like her grandmother, Qiao Dong Ying disliked this cousin, Xiao Qiao very much.Xiao Qiao's sly minds was like a hornet's nest. Wasn't she afraid of thinking too much and not be able to grow taller in the future?As soon as Second Uncle was paralyzed, Xiao Qiao immediately followed Fang Xiao Juan back to Fang's house and later remarried with Fang Xiao Juan. It was heard that she had already called Wang Xin Sheng 'Dad'!But now, it seem that going to Wang's house wasn't as good as she imagined. Xiao Qiao didn't have to do any work back at Qiao's house. But now she had to pick wild vegetables with everyone.Tsk tsk!Xiao Qiao also noticed Qiao Family group. Her face inflamed and her heart became irritable again.As Qiao Dong Ying guessed, her life in Wang Family wasn't easy.If Wang Family hadn't split, her mom and her can slack off. But now that the family had split, they had to do their own housework by themselves.At this time, her mom half-miscarried due to Liu Cui Hua. After returning from the clinic, she had been lying on the bed and never got off. The chores at home automatically fell on her shoulder!Laundry, cooking, sweeping the floor, feeding the chickens, washing dishes and pots, and serving her mom. She did everything!In just a few days, her hands became a lot coarser!She didn't want to do these things either. But if she didn't, she and her mom can only drink the northwest wind!Old Madam Wang doted for Wang Xin Sheng and told him to go to her side every day to eat. As for the daughter-in-law, Fang Xiao Juan and the baggage, Xiao Qiao, she didn't even give them a glance.Fang Xiao Juan and Xiao Qiao were so angry that there was nearly double blood vomit!Life now was completely different from what she imagined before!Originally, she wanted her mom to marry into Wang Family to eat and drink heartily. Unexpectedly, her mom offended all Wang Family before entering the door!Now Wang Family unanimously ignored them mother and daughter. Although Wang Xin Sheng will become the first ten thousand household in the future, she still found it too difficult!It was all Da Qiao's fault. If she hadn't stole their luck, how would they have ended up like this?Thinking of this, she hurriedly turned and left.Although she was the heroine of great luck, she was still too little. So she should stay away from the calamity, Da Qiao!Da Qiao was about to open her mouth to greet her younger sister when her younger sister gave a glance before turning away.Wait, she wasn't giving her a glance. She was glaring at her.Da Qiao found it a little perplexing.Qiao Dong Ying noticed that she was in a daze and thought she was sad because of Xiao Qiao. Qiao Dong Ying put a hand on her shoulder and urged, \"Enough, don't frown. If you continue on, I'll call you Old Cutie!\"Old Cutie?That can't do!Dumpling Da Qiao turned pale with fright and quickly said in a baby-ish voice, \"Second Elder Cousin Sister, don't call me Old Cutie. I'm Little Cutie. I won't frown anymore.\"Qiao Dong Ying gritted her teeth: \"Come on. I wont call you Old Cutie. Dont always call me Second Elder Cousin Sister! It makes always feel like Im very two.\"Da Qiao tilted her head and said softly, \"Then what do I call you, Second Elder Cousin Sister?\"Qiao Dong Ying: \"...\"\"Pfft...\"Qiao Dong He couldn't help but chuckle again.She felt that Younger Sister Da Qiao was simply adorable.Qiao Dong Ying reached out and pinched Da Qiao's face. Gritting her teeth, she pushed out, \"Call me Elder Sister Ying from now on!\"This Sister Ying addressment was leaking with domineering attitude. As if one could see a future badass sister was slowly forming.Alright then. Elder Sister Ying it was then. It didn't matter to Da Qiao how she should address her.On the side, little Yi Ming frowned. He immersed himself in a very serious question.If Nian Nian's sister becomes Old Cutie, wouldn't he become Old Old Cutie?Grandma Cutie?It... sounded a little weird?After picking two baskets of wild vegetables, everyone was ready to go back. However, at this moment, little Yi Ming was suddenly attracted by a butterfly and ran after the butterfly.\"Butterfly, don't run!\" Little Yi Ming found the butterfly very pretty. He wanted to grab it and give it to Elder Sister Nian Nian.It gave Qiao Dong He a scare. She hurriedly shouted: \"Little Yi Ming, don't chase. Be careful of falling!\"The few shouted and chased after him.Once they breathlessly caught up with little Yi Ming, they looked up and found that they didn't recognize the surrounding scenery.\"Dong Ying, we seem to be lost.\" Qiao Dong He frowned.Qiao Dong Ying glanced around and replied, \"Let's go in one direction first. If that doesn't work, we will go back the same way we came from. There's only four directions, north, west, south, and east. One of those direction will take us out.\"Da Qiao looked at her with admiration: \"Elder Sister Ying, you are amazing!\"Little Yi Ming clapped his little paws: \"Elder Sister Ying is amazing! Elder Sister Ying is amazing!\"Qiao Dong Ying pinched his face and grudgingly remarked: \"You little tail, how dare you laugh? If it wasn't for you, how could everyone get lost?\"Little Yi Ming wasn't angry when he was pinched. Instead, he brought the captured butterfly to his elder sister Nian Nian and said, \"Elder Sister Nian Nian, little Yi Ming give you this.\"The butterfly had brilliant blue wings. It was really beautiful. But it was a pity that little Yi Ming killed it.Qiao Dong Ying was slightly jealous: \"Really a heartless thing. Only have your elder sister Nian Nian in your eyes!\"Surprisingly, little Yi Ming heard her words and thought about it for a while. He heavily nodded his little head: \"En, little Yi Ming only has Elder Sister Nian Nian in my eyes. Heartless.\"\"Pfft...\"This time even Qiao Dong Ying couldn't help but burst into laughter.Da Qiao suddenly pointed to their right and called out, \"Elder Cousin Sister, look. That flower looks so strange. It's like a fan?\"Qiao Dong He and Qiao Dong Ying looked over and found a brown plant growing between the two stones.The plant was half of Da Qiao's height. The top stretched out like an open fan. On the surface, was a cloud-like appearance. It looked very strange.Qiao Dong He blinked her long eyelashes and said, \"What kind of plant is this? I've never seen it before.\"Qiao Dong Ying frowned. After a moment of silence, she spoke, \"This looks a bit like Ganoderma lucidum. But the Ganoderma lucidum I've seen before is very small. Only the size of a palm. This one is too big.\"Da Qiao said softly, \"Elder Sister Ying, could this be Ganoderma lucidum, but it has grown up.\"Qiao Dong Ying's eyes lit up: \"Yes. A grown up Ganoderma lucidum! Little Cutie, you are so smart!\"Da Qiao's face flushed, and her eyes shone bright. Hearing her elder cousin sister's praise, her little chest deliberately puffed out.Little Yi Ming followed suit and straightened up his chest. Seeing this, Qiao Dong He was sucker-punched by cuteness until her face was completely bloody.Younger brother and sister were too cute. What to do?Qiao Dong Ying saw her elder sister's gawking face and bumped her with her elbow: \"Elder Sister, shall we bring that thing back?\"Qiao Dong He came back to her senses and wondered, \"It's not easy to do that, right?\"They can't dig without tools.Qiao Dong Ying pondered about it and finally insisted on bringing it back: \"Give it a go. Maybe it'll sell.\"At this, Qiao Dong He's eyes flashed a gleam of light and excitedly said: \"Why didn't you tell me earlier that it can sell money? Hurry, let's get moving!\"No conditions to, then have to create the conditions!Qiao Dong Ying: \"...\"Why didn't she notice that her sister was a money grubber before?The two sisters took action just like that.Qiao Dong Ying deliberately found two relatively thick wooden sticks and the two worked together to excavate the soil next to the stone.Ganoderma lucidum was easy to pick, but the Ganoderma lucidum happened to be stuck between two stones. If the stones weren't removed, it was difficult to completely pick the Ganoderma lucidum.Don't know how long they dug, but the two's hands were tired from digging. Still, they couldn't budge the stone.Seeing how tired her cousin sisters were, Da Qiao suggested in her soft voice, \"Elder Cousin Sister, let me dig.\"Qiao Dong He waved her hand: \"No, you are still young. Just watch little Yi Ming by the side.\"Da Qiao whispered: \"I am very small, but I am very strong!\"Qiao Dong He didn't take her words to heart. Simply treating it as saying childish words.While Qiao Dong Ying considered it and told her elder sister, \"Elder Sister, let her try.\"She remembered that her little cousin sister had been doing housework since she was three years old. Once, she saw her holding a pot of clothes without flushing face nor panting. She wasn't very big at that time, so she didn't think much about it.Now that she thought about it, little cousin sister might have supernatural strength like her grandmother!Although Qiao Dong He was the older sister, she was more like a younger sister when she was with Qiao Dong Ying.So when she heard her younger sister's words, she hesitated for a moment before handing the stick over, \"Then be careful. Don't hurt yourself, understand?\"\"Understood.\" Da Qiao\u00a0softly\u00a0replied. She accepted the wooden stick and digging loudly.Qiao Dong He's eyes fell to the ground.Did this little cousin sister eating a strength elixir?How can a small dumpling be so powerful?A short while later, Da Qiao dug out the two stones. Qiao Dong Ying carefully picked the Ganoderma lucidum.Qiao Dong He had already poured out the wild vegetable in the basket and wanted her younger sister to put the plant in.It was a pity that the plant was too big to fit in the basket!\"What now?\" Qiao Dong He asked with a frown.Qiao Dong Ying made a decisive decision, took off the padded jacket on her body, and wrapped the jacket around the plant: \"Let's go. Let's go back.\"Don't know if they were lucky or if Qiao Dong Ying had a good sense of direction, they didn't walk in the woods for too long before they walked out.However, it was already midnoon when they got out. The other children had already gone home for a meal.It was spring ploughing now. The villagers will get food at noon. Which was convenient for Da Qiao and the others. They didn't encounter many people along the way.Occasionally, a few people looked over. The two sisters, Qiao Dong He and Qiao Dong Ying immediately blocked Da Qiao, who was holding the plant, with their height.The adults saw that the two sisters were carrying baskets each and guessed that they had went to pick wild vegetables. They didn't ask any questions, but only reminded: \"Your grandmother was looking for you just now. Hurry back now!\"Qiao Dong He replied, \"I know Auntie. We'll go back now.\"Back to Qiao's old house.When Wan Chun Ju saw them, she rushed up with a dark face and scolded: \"You girls. It's enough that you lazy around and don't help me with the work. You still run out for so long. Don't you know that the family is waiting for you to eat?\"Qiao Dong Ying raised her head and thought of rebuking back. But when she saw the bulging bump on her mother's head, she couldn't help but laugh.Wan Chun Ju was steaming from embarrassment: \"You damn brat, what are you laughing at?\"Behind her, Qiao Zhen Guo merrily jabbed, \"Wife, your head is swollen like an old birthday star. Everyone wants to laugh when they see it.\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Simply pissing her off!She was hit on the head by a firewood stick. In order to reduce the swelling, she immediately rubbed the swollen area with lard and had rubbed it hard for a long time.For some unknown reason, the more she rubbed, the bigger it got!At first it looked like a small egg, but now it was completely swollen into a small steamed bun!What was even more infuriating was that when her man came back,\u00a0he laughed like a hyena in her face, instead of feeling bad for her!Chen Qiao Qiao, who had been black-faced for a few days because of being assigned to raise pigs, felt a lot better when she saw Wan Chun Ju being scolded by her man again.Qiao Xiu Zhi came over and asked, \"Why have you been gone for so long? Have you encountered something?\"\"Grandmother, we found something good in the woods!\"Qiao Dong Ying looked at her grandmother with admiration on her face. Thinking that her grandmother was insightful. Unlike her mom, who scolded people indiscriminately upon return!Wan Chun Ju pouted: \"What good things can be found in the woods!\"Even if there were good things, they would have been dug up long ago. How can it wait for a few of kids?Qiao Xiu Zhi ignored the idiotic eldest daughter-in-law: \"What have you dug up? Show it to everyone.\"Da Qiao emerged from behind the two cousin sisters and put the clothe-wrapped plant she was holding on the ground: \"Grandmother, it's something like a fan!\"Wan Chun Ju recognized at a glance that it was Qiao Dong Ying's clothes and immediately became exploded: \"You wasteful brat! You use good clothes to wrap things. What capability!\"As she said that, she moved to pull Qiao Dong Ying's ears. However, was stopped by Qiao Xiu Zhi's gaze: \"Shut up!\"Wan Chun Ju: \u2026Why scold her alone?Qiao Xiu Zhi squatted down and opened her clothes carefully.The others looked over and revealed a perplex expression.Wan Chun Ju pouted and muttered, \"What kind of broken thing did you pick up!\"Xue Chuan leaned over to take a look. Immediately, he became a little excited: \"This is Mount Tai Ganoderma lucidum! A hundred years old Mount Tai Ganoderma lucidum!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only Mount Tai Ganoderma lucidum can grow to such a size.When he was a child, he heard from his grandfather about Mount Tai Ganoderma lucidum being called the legendary \"godly medicine\" when\u00a0godly farmer tasted one hundred medicine. This medicine was priceless before the founding of the country.His grandfather had also said he had seen a half-meter tall Mount Tai Ganoderma lucidum and that Ganoderma lucidum sold for few thousand silver liang in the end.The Ganoderma lucidum in front of them was about 60 to 70 centimeters tall. Bigger than what his grandfather had seen before. It was very valuable!It was just that he was curious. How could this Ganoderma lucidum appear here?He didn't mean that this specie, Mount Tai Ganoderma lucidum can't appear in other places. The mountains here were low and the climate wasn't cold enough. And there were often people coming and going in the forest. Even if there were Ganoderma lucidum, it can't grow to such a big size!This Ganoderma lucidum should be more than 150 years old. After all these years, had no one discovered it?Wan Chun Ju's face flushed red and she excitedly cried, \"Dad, this is Ganoderma lucidum? So...isn't it very valuable?\"On the side, Chen Qiao Qiao's eyes also shone.Qiao Xiu Zhi was so calm that she put the clothes back on. She raised her head and warned everyone, \"None of you are allowed to say anything about picking up Ganoderma lucidum! Not even to your maternal parents. Otherwise don't blame me for not giving you face!\"An innocent man gets into trouble because of his wealthIf such a large Ganoderma lucidum was known to the people in the village, who knows what kind of disturbance they will cause.When Wan Chun Ju and Chen Qiao Qiao heard this, they immediately understood that their mother-in-law was warning them.If it was normal matters, they would definitely feel uncomfortable in their hearts. But at this moment, looking at the more than half a meter tall Ganoderma lucidum, they have no opinion at all.Others also declared that they wouldn't speak of it outside.Seeing that everyone understands the meaning of \"making a fortune in silence\", Qiao Xiu Zhi expressed her satisfaction.After discussion, they decided to keep a small part of the Ganoderma lucidum for their own use and let Qiao Zhen Min take out the rest to sell.However, it was currently the spring ploughing period. No leave was allowed unless there were special cases. So if they want someone to pass a message to Qiao Zhen Min, it wasn't possible. They can only leave it to after the spring ploughing.Because of this Ganoderma lucidum, the entire Qiao Family was very excited. However, they couldn't speak a word of it. It was a sweet burden.Back in the room, Xue Chuan urged Qiao Xiu Zhi to lie down. He rubbed her waist and said, \"Why haven't I hear about you complaining about your waist pain this year?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi was lying on the bed with a expression of enjoyment: \"Now that you mention it, it's strange. This year your joints are no longer sore and my waist is no longer ache. Why do I feel like we are getting younger and younger?\"Her body had always been better than the average person. But when she was young, her waist was injured. So whenever the farming peak happened, her waist would be so sore that she couldn't sleep all night.Over the years, Xue Chuan had been practicing a good massage technique in order to give her a massage.While rubbing her waist, Xue Chuan jollily remarked, \"I don't know if it's a coincidence. Our bodies gradually improved after Da Qiao came over. Before, old Second's wife kept saying the child was a calamity. I think that child is a lucky doll and can bring us good luck!\"Human's hearts were biased. Ever since she found out that Da Qiao's eyes looked like Xue Chuan, Qiao Xiu Zhi had been a little more tolerance and concern for that child.Every time that child looked at her with those deer-like eyes, she always thought of Xue Chuan when he was young. She couldn't refuse her at all.After that, the child came here often. Her personality was a soft and kind. She was also smart and cute. After getting along with her day by day, she slowly put the child in her heart.When she heard her husband say this, she naturally wouldn't refute: \"You're right. If she isn't lucky, how could such a big Ganoderma lucidum be found today?\"Xue Chuan's smile became more gentle: \"By the way, that child is seven years old after the new year. She can go to school.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi happened to be on the wavelength with her husband: \"I'll take her to town to buy some books and pencils for school when the spring ploughing is over. If you make her a schoolbag, the child will definitely be very happy when she finds out!\"Xue Chuan nodded: \"I have already thought about the style of the schoolbag. At that time, I'll embroider a few animals and flowers on it. That child likes pretty things.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi thought of Da Qiao's vanity and the mirth in her eyes deepened: \"We'll go with what you said. Your hands should go up a little more. Right, right there... Your massage technique is really getting better and better.\"Xue Chuan grinned: \"I have to thank you for giving me the opportunity to practice.\"This side was incomparably warm. While Qiao Zhen Guo's side was filled with hollering.An Ping beat his chest and stomped his feet: \"Elder Sister, why didn't you call me when you went to pick wild vegetables?\"Centennial Ganoderma lucidum! He actually missed such a crucial moment!Qiao Dong Ying poked his head: \"I call for you to go but you give all kind of excuses. Now you have the face to blame us? Your face is getting thicker and thicker!\"Though An Ping was poked a step back by his elder sister, he was not angry. Instead, he had a goofy smile: \"How I am making excuses? I thought it was boring to play with you girls. Who would have thought that your luck would be so good!\"An Ping wasn't mad, but Wan Chun Ju felt distressed from watching: \"Just speak! Why poke your younger brother?\"Qiao Dong Ying rolled her eyes: \"I like to poke. Since you don't want me to poke, then I must to poke for you to see!\"As she said that, she deliberately went against her mom. She reached out and poked An Ping's forehead a few times.Wan Chun Ju was furious with rage: \"Why did I give birth to a debt collector ghost like you? Come here and see if I won't kill you!\"Qiao Dong Ying stuck her hands on hip: \"Come here and see if I won't report to my grandmother!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Simply pissing her off!Qiao Dong He was afraid that her younger sister would go too far and make her mother anxious. So he used her gaze to signal her younger sister.Qiao Dong Ying gave her elder sister face. She made a cheeky face to her mother before heading out.Wan Chun Ju clutched her chest as she gritted her teeth from anger. Turning her head back at her eldest daughter's well-behaved appearance, she felt a little better: \"Oh right, was that Ganoderma lucidum really discovered by Da Qiao?\"Qiao Dong He nodded: \"It was discovered by Younger Sister Da Qiao.\"Wan Chun Ju still couldn't quite believe it and pouted, \"How could it be that calamity who found it? Did you deliberately say that she found it to put gold on her face?\"Although Qiao Dong He is very introverted and quiet, she was a very principled child.She didn't like her mom remarking Da Qiao like this: \"Mom, if you keep at this again, I'll go tell my grandmother. Yoou know how much my grandmother love Younger Sister Da Qiao. Don't blame me for placing righteousness above family loyalty!\"After she finished speaking, she turned around and walked out of the room. Only after waking a good distance away, she grasped her chest.Oh my god, she actually retorted!However, it felt pretty refreshing to retort.Wan Chun Ju repeatedly received her two daughters' talk back one after another. Her face turned black with fury: \"Zhen Guo, look at your two daughters!\"Qiao Zhen Guo looked at her strangely: \"What wrong with my two daughters? Isn't this good?\"\"What fart good!\" Wan Chun Ju exploded, \"Every one of them has sharp teeth and sharp mouths and makes their mom\u00a0jump up and down\u00a0with anger! Which part is good!\"Qiao Zhen Guo: \"Wife, you just said an idiom;\u00a0jump up and down.\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Infuriating to death. Simply pissing her off!Was this the time to pay attention to idiom? Focus on the key points!She took a deep breath and emphasized, \"I'm talking about the two daughters' problem. Don't interrupt!\"Qiao Zhen Guo uttered an \"oh\" and responded: \"This matter is also your fault. You know that your daughters has sharp teeth, so don't provoke them. Look, they never talk back to me, their dad.\"Finished this, he had a proud face.Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"How could it was her fault again!The daughters were disobedient and the husband jabbed the heart. Her life was so bitter!Wan Chun Ju was so mad that she ate one less bowl during dinner. She originally wanted to take the opportunity to \"threatened\" everyone, but no one noticed.Wait, there was one person who noticed. Her man!At that time, he said this: \"Wife, you ate one less bowl tonight. If only you could eat this little in the future.\"Listen to this. Was this what a husband should say?What's more, she was still pregnant with their Qiao Family's golden grandson!Wan Chun Ju's anger hadn't subsided even when she went to bed. Seeing her man, her fire flared again: \"You go to sleep with your son tonight. Just the sight of you makes me annoyed!\"Qiao Zhen Guo was perplexed. Then he nodded: \"Alright. Looking at the bump on your forehead, I'm afraid I won't be able to sleep due to laughing.\"Wan Chun Ju's heart had been poked into a honeycomb. She gritted her teeth, \"Come back here. You will sleep here tonight. Not allowed to go anywhere!\"Afraid of not being able to fall asleep due laughing, right? I'll let you laugh enough!Qiao Zhen Guo sighed: \"Wife, why are you stirring so much sh*t? One moment, it' this, next moment, it's that. It's easier to raise pigs than to raise you!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"My chest hurts!She was really going to vomit blood!Although Qiao Zhen Guo said that he was afraid that he wouldn't be able to sleep, in fact, such a thing would never happen. He went to see\u00a0Duke Zhou\u00a0as soon as he got on the bed.Seeing her man fell asleep in a second, Wan Chun Ju was so mad that she vomited blood. She purposely turned over and flip back. Unfortunately, she failed to wake the other party up despite doing this for a while.So vexing!After much difficulty, she fell asleep in the middle of the night. However, something happened!It might be because Qiao Zhen Guo staring at the bump on his wife's forehead for too long during the day, when he went to bed at night, he actually dreamed of old immortal Longevity.Old immortal Longevity asked him what he wished. Qiao Zhen Guo pondered about it and answered that he hoped his parents would live to a hundred years.In his opinion, a home was a home only when his parents were alive. If his parents were gone, this home was gone.Old immortal Longevity pointed to the big bump on his forehead and stated, \"If you want your parents to live to a hundred years, then you can poke my bump hard. The harder you poke, the longer your parents will live!\"Qiao Zhen Guo stared at his bump and asked, \"Then won't you feel pain?\"Old immortal Longevity shook his head: \"No, this bump is for being poked.\"Hearing this, Qiao Zhen Guo was relieved and stretched out his hand to poke with his might!That night, a pig's cry broke out in Qiao's old house. The cry was so terrifying that many children were scared into tears!The next day, someone came to Qiao's house early in the morning to ask: \"What's with the pig slaughtering sound last night? Your Qiao Family doesn't raise pigs?\"When Chen Qiao Qiao, who just came out of the inside, heard this. She almost laughed out a pig snort.Wan Chun Ju saw Chen Qiao Qiao's gloating face from inside. She clutched the bump on her head that had doubled in size and almost clenched her teeth until it break in hatred!...Spring ploughing went on for half a month before it ended.After the spring ploughing, Wang Shui Sheng approved a batch of leave request. Qiao Family asked for a leave for three people.Qiao Hong Xia originally wanted to fix the household registration before the spring ploughing, but Zhao Family deliberately dragged it. So the household registration hadn't been transferred yet.Fortunately, Wang Shui Sheng intended to befriend Qiao Family and agreed to let her work first and record work points. Later, she can move her household registration over here.Zhao Family was litter of beasts. They thought that dragging on purpose would make her change her mind. They can go to have their Spring and Autumn Dream!This time, she must get the household registration matter settled.Qiao Xiu Zhi was afraid that her daughter would be bullied, so she asked Qiao Zhen Guo to go with her.The other leave was for Qiao Xiu Zhi herself.If a large Ganoderma lucidum was placed at home, anyone would be worried. So it was better to sell it quickly.Originally, she wanted to notify Qiao Zhen Min to come back to get it. But it took a lot of time to go back and forth. Besides, she was going to take Da Qiao to the town to buy stationery. So after thinking about it, it would be better for her to go there in person.Xue Chuan originally wanted to go with her, but there were only two unreliable daughters-in-law left at home. And Qiao Zhen Jun was paralyzed. He could only stay behind.Knowing that her grandmother was going to take her to town to buy stationery, Da Qiao jumped up on the spot with joy.Qiao Dong He and her siblings were very envious, but not jealous.After all, them siblings had been to the town. Only Younger Sister Da Qiao hadn't been there. What's more, her grandmother had promised them that she will buy them stationery later.The day to go to town arrived.Qiao Xiu Zhi grabbed a sack and put the Ganoderma lucidum in it first. Then she filled it with rice.Like this way, others can't see anything from the outside. Even if there was a militia inspection on the road, there was nothing to worry about.Da Qiao deliberately changed into her newest clothes. Under little Yi Ming's tearful eyes, she held her grandmother's hand and headed to town.All the way out, everyone saw Qiao Xiu Zhi carrying a sack of something. They all inquired about what was inside. Qiao Xiu Zhi uniformly replied that she wanted to send some food to her son.When everyone heard this, they were no longer curious.Less than half an hour after Qiao Xiu Zhi and Qiao Hong Xia departed, a slim figure appeared in Qiao's small house.The wooden door of the small courtyard was pushed open. Qiao Zhen Jun heard the movement and called out, \"Dad, is that you?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQiao Zhen Jun called out twice, but no one answered.It was a little strange. If his dad came, he would definitely respond.However, he did not suspect that it was a thief or something. After all, it was daytime. No one would be so unbridled.Besides, the pup, Pi Pi didn't bark. So the person who came over might be one of his eldest brother's kids.Thinking of this, he relaxed his heart and continued with what he was just doing now.During this time, the pain in his lumbar spine had completely disappeared. He can get up and sit for a long time every day.He didn't mentioned this to his family yet because a lot of things happened at home during this time. And it was the New Year.But in the past two days, he found that he can feel his legs!When he woke up this morning, even that man part had feeling!Though this topic was difficult to dwell on, there was no man who didn't care about this. He was living like an useless person. That feeling was really painful!Since he was paralyzed, he faced his family with a smile every day. Only in the dead of night did he dare to let the pain show.But now, he have the sense of touch!Maybe his legs will be able to stand up one day. So he was leaning on the table next to the bed now, preparing to give it a go.He moved towards the edge of the bed as he held on to the edge of the table with both hands. Slowly, he supported his body to stand up.If it was before, he couldn't complete this action independently. But now he had!Both of his feet were on the ground. And he hadn't collapse to the ground.He stood up! He actually got back on his feet!Qiao Zhen Jun's eyes revealed ecstasy. His eyes were wet!At this moment, a delicate and gentle voice sounded from outside the house: \"Zhen, Zhen Jun, I'm... Lin Hui. Is it convenient for you now? I want to go in and...with you...\"Qiao Zhen Jun didn't hear the rest of the words, because Lin Hui's voice became smaller and smaller and finally turned into the sound of mosquitoes.At this moment, Lin Hui was standing outside the door. Blushing like a boiled shrimp, she grabbed the corner of her clothes with both hands. Almost rubbing the corners of her clothes to shreds. Her lips turned white from her bite.Hearing Lin Hui's voice, Qiao Zhen Jun was stunned.Although the two were from the same village, they had never spoken privately since they got married. The last time he saw her was half a year ago.He still remembered that she was wearing a gray shirt with an ashen face. The bleak color couldn't hide the demure and gentleness on her face.He turned around and left after just one glance. It wasn't until Fang Xiao Juan beat her up because of rumors last time did he remembered this person.What was she doing here now?Did she come here to find Da Qiao?Lin Hui was so nervous that she was about to explode. The blood from her body rushed to her face. Every second she waited was a torment. And there was no reply from the inside.Just when her courage was about to disappear, there was finally a movement inside: \"cough...You're here to find Da Qiao? She went to town with her grandmother. You can...\"\"No, I'm not here to find Da Qiao.\" Lin Hui interrupted him before he finished speaking, \"I'm here to find you!\"Find him?Qiao Zhen Jun's heart rippled like a stone thrown into the water.\u00a0Thump thump thump, his heart rapidly started beating. The hand gripped the edge of the table so hard that the blue veins on the back of his hand were exposed: \"Then...you, come in.\"\"Okay.\" Lin Hui subconsciously glanced outside the yard.Seeing no one, she quickly entered.When the wooden door was closed again, Xiao Qiao came out from behind the wall.Her brows furrowed tightly.Ever since she realized Da Qiao got a system to steal people's luck, she took a detour when she saw Da Qiao. She only chose to come here today since she knew that she was going to town with her grandmother.Life at Wang's house was too hard. She felt like she couldn't persist it any longer!Now, she regretted that she had acted too decisively. She should have kept a good relationship with Qiao Family. At least before Wang Xin Sheng became a ten-thousand-yuan household, she had to maintain a superficial relationship with Qiao Family.This way, she can leave a way out for herself.So she took advantage of the fact that when Da Qiao and her grandmother went to town. She wanted to come over to get in contact with her dad. Unexpectedly, she encountered Lin Hui seeking her dad.It was just, why did Lin Hui come to find her dad?And it happened to be when everyone wasn't present. There was something fishy at first sight!She tiptoed over to prepare to go in and hide under the window sill to eavesdrop. But just at this moment, a sharp voice came from behind...\"Jiao Jiao'er, what are you doing there? The other party don't want you anymore, so why are you sticking to their cold bum?\"Xiao Qiao's foot halted in mid-air. A flash of irritability flashed passed her eyes.With one hand supporting her back, Fang Xiao Juan's face displayed anger: \"Still, not coming over!? Or do you want to go back to Qiao's house?\"After the divorce, Fang Family and Qiao Family became two families were sworn enemies.Especially after Fang Family met with misfortune, Fang Xiao Juan felt oppressed and wanted to live better than Qiao Family.Therefore, she felt betrayed to see Xiao Qiao running to Qiao's house at this moment.Xiao Qiao gritted her teeth, turned around and walked over: \"Mom,\u00a0ei rang ti um an tea ma ad.\"She wanted to say that she wanted to come and see her dad. But due to losing her three front teeth, her speech was very seriously. It sounded even more funny than Da Qiao's stuttering.Xiao Qiao's face flushed red. There was another burst of resentment brewing in her heart.Fang Xiao Juan felt irritated when she heard her effected speech: \"I don't know what you are talking about! Anyway, I warn you, if you still want to recognize me as your mom, go back with me. Also, don't let me see you come here again in the future!\"Xiao Qiao glared at her mom's back. Her gaze was sinister and ruthlessness.Fang Xiao Juan walked for a while and didn't hear any footsteps behind her. She couldn't help but get even more furious.She turned back to scold her again. However, she meet with Xiao Qiao's eyes and her whole body shivered.When she took a closer look, Xiao Qiao had returned to her usual cute and sweet appearance. As if it was just her illusion.Xiao Qiao originally wanted to tell her mom that Lin Hui came to find her dad.But her mom was the perfect incarnation of a pig teammate. If she told her about it, who knows what trouble will stir out.Qiao Family would definitely hate her more. So she changed her mind....Qiao Xiu Zhi was carrying 70 to 80 jins in one hand and Da Qiao's hand in the other. Her feets were like the wind.Da Qiao tried her best to keep up with her grandmother's footsteps with her short legs. Fortunately, she had been practicing five-animal-exercise with her grandmother all this time. In addition to drinking jade bead water, she didn't have such a hard time.But seeing her grandmother carrying such a heavy sack, she felt a little distressed: \"Grandmother, are you tired, do you want to sit down and rest for a while?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi looked down at her: \"Are you tired?\"Da Qiao shook her head and said softly: \"I'm not tired. I'm worried that Grandmother is tired. How about I help Grandmother?\"Her strength was also very large. Even Elder Sister Dong He can't compare to her.Qiao Xiu Zhi's heart melted. She rubbed her little bun with a smile, \"Grandmother isn't tired. It's not a problem to carry you as well.\"Ganoderma lucidum weighed 20 jins. Rice was 60 jins. The total of the sack was 80 jins. If someone else carries such a heavy thing for such a long journey, they will definitely be exhausted.But to her, it was no different from carrying a seven or eight jins item.Everyone said that she was born with supernatural strength. But actually, she wasn't. When she was first born, she was no different from ordinary people.When she was four years old, she went to the forest to pick wild vegetables. Then she saw a colorful mushroom and thought it was very pretty. So she didn't even think and eat it.Now that she recalled it, she was close to faint from hunger. She dared to put anything in her mouth. Soon she met with mishap.She was in a coma for three whole days. Her family had already prepared for the worst. At that time, her parents almost fainted from crying.Her dad used to be a hunter. However, he stopped hunting and became a farmer. Before her, her parents gave birth to five children, but none of them lived to five years old.There were all kinds of rumors in the village. Many people say that their Qiao Family's feng shui wasn't good. Some people say that her dad killed too many lives, so the retribution was on the children.Just when everyone thought she was going to die, she came back to life with an inexhaustible amount of energy.Since then, she had chopped bricks with her bare hands, smashed boulders to her chest, and killed a wild boar weighing more than 200 pounds with one punch. None of them was an issue.After walking for more than an hour, even if Da Qiao's physical fitness improved, he was still a little tired.Qiao Xiu Zhi squatted down and put her on her shoulders and stated, \"Hold on well. Don't fall!\"Da Qiao hugged her grandmother's neck tightly. Her eyes shone with twinkle.Ride high!Awesome! It was her first time riding high!Pedestrians on the road saw this scene. Their eyes fell to the ground in shock.This, this... woman's strength was simply too much, right?Whether rushing or not, they finally arrived at the town.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't delay and marched directly to the supply and demand cooperative.The uncle, who guarded the door, heard that Qiao Xiu Zhi was here to find her son and told them to wait at the door. He went in to fetch him.Qiao Zhen Min didn't believe it when he heard that his mom had come. He didn't believe it until he saw the person at the door: \"Mom, why did you come here? Why didn't you tell me in advance?\"He often had to travel out and sometimes would be gone for a week or two. His mom didn't let him know in advance and missed him, wouldn't it be a waste of time?Da Qiao raised her head and called sweetly: \"Fifth Uncle, Grandmother brought me out to buy stationery. While we are at it, we deliver you some food.\"While we are at it...Qiao Zhen Min suddenly had a buy-one-get-one-free feeling.Qiao Xiu Zhi pulled him to the corner and asked in a hushed voice, \"Is there anyone else in your dormitory now?\"Qiao Zhen Min shook his head: \"No. The others are either at work or out delivering goods. Mom, why are you asking this?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't answer his question and simply ordered: \"Lead the way!\"Qiao Zhen Min: \"...\"If someone else dared to talk to him like this, he would definitely punch him in the face. But this person in front of him was his mom. What else can he do?Before, he lived in a single-room dormitory. Although it was only about ten square meters, he didn't need to share a room with others.Since the arrival of the new leader, the single-person dormitory had been taken back. Now he can only squeeze in a room of twenty square meter with five people.The feeling of shame couldn't get any better!Entering the dormitory, Qiao Xiu Zhi took a look and saw that there were two beds in the room, one on each side. The six people slept on a wide bed.She didn't say much and put down the sack on her shoulder. Then she instructed Qiao Zhen Min to close the door and window before slowly taking out the Ganoderma lucidum.Qiao Zhen Min couldn't figure out what\u00a0medicine was brewing in his mom's gourd. When he saw the ganoderma lucidum that was more than half a meter high, his mouth was so stunned that he couldn't close his mouth for a long time.Seeing her fifth uncle's stupid appearance, Da Qiao couldn't help covering her mouth and laugh secretly.\"Mom, mom, mom...\" Qiao Zhen Min was so shocked that he couldn't speak properly.Qiao Xiu Zhi said with a solemn face, \"What are you calling for? This is a hundred-year-old Mount Tai Ganoderma lucidum. Da Qiao and the kids dug it up on the mountain. Is there any way you can sell it?\"Qiao Zhen Min gulped, took a deep breath, and spoke, \"Mom, don't tell me that this century-old Ganoderma lucidum was dug on that East Wood hill?\"Da Qiao raised her small paws and interjected softly: \"I dug it in East Wood.\"Qiao Zhen Min: \"!\"How can this be possible?East Wood wasn't big. What's more, there were so many people going in to dig wild vegetables and pick mushrooms every day. If there was such a big Ganoderma lucidum, it would have been discovered long ago. How can it wait for a few children?However, his mom didn't seem like she was lying. What's more, there was no need to lie. He had to believe this fact.\"You can continue to be stunned after we leave. Tell me now, is there any way you can sell the thing?\" Qiao Xiu Zhi urged.Qiao Zhen Min took a deep breath again. He nodded and responded, \"Can. No matter how much money one have, they can't get such a thing. As long as the news is spread, a lot of people will be fighting for it!\"He often travelled around, so he met a lot of people.These people may not have much position, but they have a lot of connections and networks. There was absolutely no problem in selling the thing. Just give them some benefits when the time comes.Qiao Xiu Zhi re-wrapped the Ganoderma lucidum with cloth and put it in the sack: \"That's fine. I'll leave this to you and you can handle it yourself! There is one thing, I'd rather not sell it than be caught. Do you understand?\"In Qiao Xiu Zhi's view, money wasn't as important as life.Hearing his mom's words, Qiao Zhen Min's heart warmed: \"Mom, don't worry. I will be careful.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi passed the Ganoderma lucidum to her youngest son and then took Da Qiao away.Qiao Zhen Min watched the carefree departing back of his mom. The feeling of buying one, getting one free came up again.Qiao Xiu Zhi felt the supply and demand cooperative didn't have enough things. She took Da Qiao directly to the department store.At home, Wan Chun Ju made a sound of a slaughtered pigs while eating: \"Ouch...it hurts to death!\"Qiao Zhen Guo said, \"Wife, what's up with you now? Why do you like to learn scream like pigs so much recently?\"\"Pfft...\"A laughter escaped out of Chen Qiao Qiao.Wan Chun Ju almost vomited blood!What liking to learn how to scream like pigs?If he hadn't poked the bump on her forehead for no reason that night, what would she have groaned like that?\"I have a lot of core sore in my mouth. Look!\" She opened her mouth to show her man.She had counted it in the morning. There were seven or eight in toral.Qiao Zhen Guo glanced at it before laughing like hyenas: \"Long-tongued woman gets sores on her mouth. Wife, you have so many sores. So you have become the king of the long-tongued woman?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37\"Pfft...\"When Chen Qiao Qiao heard her eldest brother-in-law's words, she couldn't help snort out a laughter.She was laughing her ass off!Can she say her eldest brother-in-law was a god?Every day he can come up with new ways to attack his wife. At first, she was a little sympathetic to Wan Chun Ju, but now she just wanted to say, well done!Wan Chun Ju's face went red and white: \"Qiao Zhen Guo, you can't live if you don't refute me for a day, right? I'm your wife, why are you doing this to me?\"Simply pissed her off!It was enough that he usually speak to her like that. However, letting little bum Chen Qiao Qiao watch a joke was a no-go!Qiao Zhen Guo showed a befuddled face: \"Wife, I'm telling the truth. You don't see me talking nonsense everywhere and didn't grow any sores. Neither did the children. Fifth Sister-in-law, do you have any?\"Chen Qiao Qiao cooperatively shook her head: \"I don't have it either!\"Qiao Zhen Guo's expression said 'see': \"Wife, you heard it. We don't have any. Only you! Isn't it because you like to talk too much nonsense about other? Wife, it's not that I want to scare you. I heard that the long-tongued women died with their tongue pulled out later!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"This wasn't scaring, what was?Did she kill too many people in her last life? So she married such a fool in this life?Chen Qiao Qiao expressed that she can't handle it. Her stomach hurt from laughing!Wan Chun Ju was so mad that she almost vomited blood. She pushed her rice bowl out, stood up and stated, \"Not eating anymore. I'm full of anger!\"After speaking, she left angrily.It was just that she didn't walk fast. After walking out of the main room, she deliberately stopped and waited for a while.Goddamn it. No one in this family uttered a sound to keep her from leaving!Her chest ache!Qiao Zhen Guo sighed at the children and said, \"Your temper is getting more and more strange. Getting more and more like old woman Yao at the end of the village.\"Old woman Yao, also known as old witch. She got the personality that nag the sky and ground. From her spouse to her son to her daughter-in-law to her grandchildren, there was no one who hadn't been scolded by her. Her family was annoyed her.She caused so much disturbance at home that the few children were forced to express that they didn't want to live with her. So they separated off from her and their father to live alone.Who knew that old woman Yao's spouse had enough of her and would rather live alone than live in the same room with her!Therefore, Yao Family's two elderly lived separately. The sons also lived separately. It had become a scene in the village.The few children pondered about it and nodded. Saying that they were quite similar.Qiao Zhen Guo directed at An Ping, \"Don't worry. Once you get married, we will learn from old Yao Family and live separately.\"An Ping was clipping the leftover pork balls from the New Year, when he heard his father's words. He considered it for a while before nodding, \"Alright.\"Anyway, no matter whether they live together or not, he would still care about his parents.So he straightforwardly decided!Qiao Zhen Guo felt that a major matter had been solved. So he poured the rice from his wife's bowl into his own bowl and ate it in big gulps.Qiao Dong He was the most considerate. She looked toward the door with some worry and asked her younger sister, \"Should we go over and see Mom?\"Qiao Dong Ying, a bachelor like her dad, waved her hand and said, \"No need. It's been so many years, Mom should be used to it!\"Wan Chun Ju, whose was the cat eavesdropping under the window: \"...\"These days really really really can't go on!What sin did she commit!Wan Chun Ju returned to the room in a rage and laid on the bed for a long time. Her chest still heaving violently.In fact, there was a reason why her mouth had so many sores this time.Wan Chun Ju's biggest hobby in her life was gossip. Then followed by showing off everywhere.This time, Qiao Family dug up a 100-year-old Ganoderma lucidum. If such a big thing was said, let alone the whole village, even the whole community will envy her!But such a thing can't be said at all. Otherwise, she will be sent back to her parents' home.It really suffocated her!If people hold it in too much, they will get heated. That was why Wan Chun Ju have a mouthful of sores....Qiao Xiu Zhi led Da Qiao to the department store.Da Qiao looked up at the plaque over her head. Her mouth was opened into a circle.The town was so big!There were so many people and so many things. It was like what Elder Cousins said. Her eyes can't even take in everything!Walking all the way, she looked around. Just like Grandma Liu entering the Da Guan Garden.Fortunately, she was small and looked pretty and fluffy. The passers-by didn't laugh at her when they saw her. Instead, they thought she was cute.Seeing her surprised appearance, Qiao Xiu Zhi rubbed her head and said, \"This is nothing. When I have a chance, I will take you to the department store in the county.\"Although the department store in the town was also called a department store, its scale wasn't comparable to that in the county. However, it was understandable. The consumption level in the town and surrounding villages was very limited. There was no way for the scale to be expanded.Da Qiao smiled until her eyes curved into crescents and sweetly replied, \"Grandmother is the best! When I grow up and make money, I'll buy a big house for Grandmother and Grandfather in the town!\"When Qiao Xiu Zhi heard this, her eyes flashed.The child reminded her that if the price of Ganoderma lucidum was decent, she could come to town to buy two houses.Qiao Zhen Min had worked as a transporter in the supply and demand cooperative for several years. But he had always been a temporary worker. If he had a house in the town, he can transfer his household registration. There will be a way to change his career to permanent then.Second, she wants to buy a house for Da Qiao.She found the 100-year-old Ganoderma lucidum. No matter how much money is spent on her, it was right.More importantly, old Second was paralyzed. This child's future marriage will definitely be more difficult than other sisters.If she has a town household registration and a house, she will have more choices in the future.Qiao Xiu Zhi planned it all out in her heart. Still, she had to go back and discuss it with everyone.Since ancient times, money and silk have moved people's hearts. Even among brothers, there were many people who had fought for money.So this kind of thing had to be discussed.Although the department store wasn't big, there were still a lot of people. Qiao Xiu Zhi first took her to the counter that sold stationery.The salesperson at the counter saw that they were dressed in gray and put up an indifferent attitude. Qiao Xiu Zhi wasn't angry though. She picked two notebooks and two pen for each person. After paying the coupon and the money, they left.Da Qiao held the notebook and pencil in her arms. Her face flushed with excitement: \"Grandmother, I will study hard. I will bring back 100% in the test!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi smiled and said, \"Okay. Then Grandmother will wait for you to bring home an 100% test.\"Da Qiao nodded vigorously. Her expression was serious. So cute that passersby that their face got sucker-punched by adorableness.After buying stationery, Qiao Xiu Zhi took her to the counter that sold fabrics.Da Qiao had grown a lot taller recently. Even if she hadn't hadn't grown taller, she can't wear her old clothes anymore. So during this trip, she planned to get some fabric for her schoolbag as well as making some spring clothes for her.Da Qiao knew that her Grandmother was going to make new clothes for her again. Her long eyelashes blinked and her eyes instantly turned red. She hugged her grandmother's thigh and spoke, \"Grandmother, I'm so blessed to be your granddaughter. I want to be your granddaughter in the future!\"Everyone could not help but smile kindly when they saw a fair and tender little girl suddenly pounced on her grandmother's thigh and said such childishly grown-up words.Some elderly people who didn't have granddaughters were craving for one after seeing this. They really want to have a sweet, soft and beautiful granddaughter.Qiao Xiu Zhi's heart softened again and smiled: \"Silly child, no matter how blessed or not, you are Grandmother's granddaughter in this life. This will not change.\"Da Qiao didn't understand that about this life and the next. She only knew that she would always be with her grandmother and grandfather.There were significantly more people buying fabrics than stationery. There was a queue.In front of Da Qiao and her grandmother was an auntie in her 40 to 50s. The auntie was quite tall and big. In this age when everyone can't eat enough, she was actually full of flesh.Especially that bum was as big as a basket. It was very fleshy. Even if big bum Wan Chun Ju stand next to her, she would willingly bow down. As for small bum Chen Qiao Qiao, there was no need to compare.When Da Qiao stood over, she was pushed by the person behind and bumped into the fat auntie's bum.The fat auntie shrieked and turned around. She raised her hand to grab Da Qiao's collar: \"You dead child! what are you pushing for? Rushing to reincarnate!?\"But before her hand touched Da Qiao, she was grabbed by Qiao Xiu Zhi. Suddenly a pig-slaughtering sound erupted: \"Oh, my hand... let go! Do you know who my son is? If you hurt me, my son will make your whole family look good!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi pushed her pig's paw away and snorted coldly, \"Then do you know who I am?\"The fat auntie was pushed back and staggered. If it weren't for having someone behind her, she would definitely fall to the ground!\"My son is from the police station. You better have some background, or I will let my son capture you all back!\"She was trembling with anger. But when she heard the other party's words, she hesitated.Was this person some important?But she quickly rejected the idea. What kind of important person dress in rags like a beggar?When everyone heard that her son was from the police station, those who had the heart to dissuade the fight, closed their mouths at this moment.Qiao Xiu Zhi smiled coldly: \"Since you don't even know who I am, how dare you say that your son is from the police station?\"The fat auntie was stunned: \"...\"Was she really someone important?Or were there relatives in the family who were bigwigs?The fat auntie's heart was filled with hate!Firstly, she was afraid of offending the other party. Secondly, she remembered the strength of the woman's grip on her wrist just now. She knew in her heart that she couldn't beat her, so she glared at her angrily before turning back and stopped talking.Qiao Xiu Zhi picked up Da Qiao and checked her out. She asked her, \"Did it hurt?\"Da Qiao shook her head and whispered in a baby voice, \"It didn't hurt. It just stinks!\"\"Pfft...\"When the people standing behind them heard Da Qiao's words, they burst out into chuckles.Just now, Da Qiao bumped into the fat auntie's bum. Now she was talking about smelly, didn't that mean...When the fat auntie heard Da Qiao's words and the laughter behind her, her face was flushed with fury. She left without buying anything.Before she walked out of the gate, a child ran in and accidentally bumped into her.She jumped up in explosive rage and threw the child who was on her lap away with force: \"Go to hell. Get out of the way!\"The child was pushed out and crashed into the man behind him who came in carrying a wooden cabinet.The man's stability was knocked off kilter and the wooden cabinet he was carrying in his hand tilted down. It was about to land on the child.The crowd screamed!The child's relatives caught up and saw this picture. Their legs went soft.Just when the cabinet was about to smash on the child's head, a figure dashed over quickly and single-handedly grasped the wooden cabinet that needed three men to lift.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The distance between the wooden cabinet and the child was only half a fist.Extremely startling!The little boy opened his eyes wide and suddenly cried out with a \"WAA\".When Da Qiao saw the little boy crying, she hurriedly moved her short legs and ran over. She softly comforted, \"There there, don't cry.\"The little boy cried until the tears glazed in his eyes. Then out of nowhere, he saw a little sister who looked like a little fairy appeared in front of him. She spoke softly and sweetly, as if he had eaten sweet cakes.Instantly, he was afraid and with a pressed lips, he responded: \"Little sister, I'm afraid.\"Before Da Qiao could answer, she heard her grandmother speak: \"Da Qiao, carry this child out.\"\"Okay, Grandmother!\" Da Qiao sweetly replied.Shen Tian You was a year younger than Da Qiao. However, he was well nourished. Not to mention, he was more than half a head taller than Da Qiao, he was fair and chubby. At least ten to twenty jins heavier than Da Qiao.When everyone heard the strong woman in front say \"carry out\", they thought she meant drag him out. Unexpectedly, the thin little girl squatted down and stretched out her hand to hold the little boy.That's right, it was a princess carry.The eyes that everyone just picked up fell to the ground again.This... What did this grandmother-granddaughter grow up on? This strength was simply scary?Years later, Shen Tian You, who had grown to a height of 1.8 meters, remembered this scene and mentally collapsed.Seeing that Da Qiao carried the kid out, Qiao Xiu Zhi put the wooden cabinet on the ground and turned to the three men with the same expression in shock. She uttered, \"Be careful in the future.\"The three nodded in unison: \"Thank you! Thank you, Eldest Sister!\"Why call Eldest Sister? Should be Dad!The three men were truly grateful to Qiao Xiu Zhi. If it wasn't for her today, the wooden cabinet would definitely have smashed on the boy's head. If he didn't die then, he would probably be smashed into a fool!They were all born into poor families. If they really smashed the kid to death, it won't be their own life ruined. Their families would suffer too!So at this moment, Qiao Xiu Zhi was like their reborn parent in their eyes. Their great benefactor!Everyone came back to their senses. Some applauded, while some condemned the fat auntie.\"What kind of person is this? Such a vicious heart! What's so great about having a son working in the police station?\"\"That's right. It was just accidentally bumping into her and she wants his life. If it's up to me, this kind of person should be arrested, get paraded on the street, and get shot!\"\"Look at that little boy's clothes are well-dressed, maybe he is a child of a good family, if something really happens, I want to see if her son at the police station can handle it!\"The fat auntie was frightened silly.At the time, she was completely irritated and in rage. And the child happened to bump over. She pushed him away without even thinking. She never thought of killing him though!Shen Tian You's family also came to their senses. A young woman stumbled in with an old lady in her fifties or sixties.The old lady hugged the little boy tightly and cried, \"My You You, you really scared grandmother to death!\"The young woman walked up to Qiao Xiu Zhi, bowed deeply to her, and expressed, \"Thank you so much, Auntie. If it weren't for you, my nephew would have...\"Her eyes turned red as she spoke.She caught up just now and witnessed the wooden cabinet heading toward Tian You's head. Her legs went soft on the spot.In the third generation of their Shen family, Tian You was the only child. If something happened to Tian You, her parents and her elder sister-in-law will definitely not be able to bear it. She can't even think about the consequences!So let alone bowing to the other party at this moment, she was willing to kneel if told to!Qiao Xiu Zhi waved her hand and responded, \"There's nothing to thank. However, you still need to pay attention in the future. Might not be this lucky next time!\"It was boasting. If they didn't encounter her today, this child would definitely suffer.The young woman didn't find her words unpleasant to hear at all. She nodded sharply with the same feeling: \"Auntie, don't leave yet. Our whole family must thank you in a while. I'll deal with the garbage first!\"After speaking, she turned around and walked to the fat auntie. She raised her hand and slapped her: \"Fortunately, my nephew is fine. Otherwise this matter can't be solved with a slap!\"The fat auntie had fair skin and a lot of flesh on her face. With this slap, a dazzling handprint immediately appeared on her face.The fat auntie screamed like a pig getting slaughtered. She reached out to pull the young woman's hair: \"B*tch, you dare hit me!? You dare hit me!?\"But before her hand touched the young woman, it was caught by Qiao Xiu Zhi again.The fat auntie flushed with anger. Her cheeks were trembling: \"You chin man\u00a0, let me go. If not, wait for my son to come over. I'll let you all look good!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't want to talk nonsense with her. She twisted the fat auntie's hand into a weird angle.The fat auntie made a slaughtered pig sound again: \"Ahhhh...let go! It hurts to death!\"When everyone saw this scene, they recalled the scene of the strong woman holding the wooden cabinet with one hand just now and silently lit a candle for the fat auntie in their hearts.The young woman thanked Qiao Xiu Zhi once again: \"Auntie, thanks a million! I plan to send her to the police station. I'll have to trouble you to give a statement for us!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi shook off the fat auntie's hand and nodded to indicate that there was no problem.At this moment, a tall man walked in and looked around.When the fat auntie saw the man, she became excited at once: \"Cheng Chang ah, Mom is here. Come and save Mom. Mom is getting bullied. You must arrest all these lowly mud leg and put them into jail today!\"The fat auntie's son, Liao Cheng Chang, had always been a filial son. Hearing his mom's beckon, he rushed in immediately.When he saw the handprint on his mom's face, he said angrily and anxiously: \"Mom, who bullied you?\"The fat auntie pointed at Qiao Xiu Zhi: \"This mud leg. Just now she said that she is a bigwig. Pah, she dresses like a beggar and wants to come out to cheat! Also this b*tch, she made this handprint on Mom's face. Quickly catch them all!\"No matter who, it was unbearable to see one's mother to be beaten like this!\"Mom, don't worry. I'll take this bunch in and teach them a lesson!\" Liao Cheng Chang responded in fury.When everyone saw Liao Cheng Chang's furious King Kong expression, they couldn't help but sweat for the strong woman and the young woman.Liao Cheng Chang turned around and was about to grab the two who beat his mom. But once he turned around and saw the young woman, a startled expression appeared on his face: \"Miss...Miss Shen...\"Seeing that her son hadn't made an arrest and looked like he knew her, the fat auntie looked at the young woman up and down with contempt: \"Cheng Chang, do you know her?\"The cold sweat on Liao Cheng Chang's forehead was close to falling.The fat auntie didn't receive any answer from her son and instantly had a guess in her heart.Her son was that excellent. There were usually many butterflies trying to seduce her son. This young woman should be one of them!Thinking of this, she became more and more proud: \"Cheng Chang, Mom tells you, such a woman can't be a good wife and mother. You mustn't chose her!\"Awkwardness deepened on Liao Cheng Chang's face: \"Mom, it's not what you think!\"\"What not what I thought? She must have been shamelessly pestering you, right? You are kind and don't know how to reject these shameless women. Mom will help you!\"The fat auntie raised her chin. Like an aloof queen, she looked down at the young woman: \"Let me tell you, with your character and appearance, you will never enter our Liao Family's door and be our Liao Family's daughter-in-law for the rest of your life!\"The young woman sneered: \"Do you think everyone is attracted to your son?\"The fat auntie exploded: \"You b*tch...\"Liao Cheng Chang's face flushed red and hollered, \"Mom, don't speak!\"The fat auntie completely freeze.Her son had grown up so big and had never said a single harsh word to her. Now, he actually did this for the sake of a b*tch!And she hadn't entered the door yet. If she was allowed to enter the door, how will she be in the future?\"B*tch, dare to seduce my son? I'll beat you to death!\" She was about to grab the young woman, but she was forcefully pulled back before she touched the young woman.She stumbled, took two steps back, and almost fell to the ground.However, the person who pulled her this time wasn't Qiao Xiu Zhi, but her precious son.She looked at her son in disbelief.\"Mom!\" Liao Cheng Chang's scalp was numb from his mom's gaze. But he was afraid that his mom would continue to talk nonsense, so he could only grit his teeth: \"This Miss Shen is the younger sister of our deputy chief. Don't talk nonsense any more!\"The younger sister of the deputy chief...?That means... the little boy she just pushed was the only child of her son's superior?The fat auntie's vision turned black.The young woman sneered: \"A clerk who has just entered the police station dares to be so arrogant? I have to ask my elder brother how he disciplines his subordinates!\"Everyone was overjoyed to eat melons here.The fat auntie acted so arrogant just now. Everyone thought her son was someone with high position, but it turned out to be just a little clerk?Really make people laugh off their big teeth!That's why don't pretend for no reason. Pretending can get one struck by lightning!Liao Cheng Chang kept apologizing: \"Miss Shen, I'm sorry. My mom is mentally sick. She usually does things that she doesn't even know about. Please forgive her this time!\"The young woman smiled coldly: \"Forgive? If it wasn't for this auntie today, my nephew would have died by now!\"Liao Cheng Chang was drenched in cold sweats.He was just a powerless clerk. In order to enter the police station, his family spent a lot of money to find connections.He hadn't gained a firm foothold in the police station yet and his mom almost killed the deputy chief's son. He was finished!Soon, the young woman's elder brother, Shen Shi Kai brought the police officers from the police station over. He first got people to bring Liao Cheng Chang and his mom to the police. The rest can be left to when he go back.After this was settled, he came to thank Qiao Xiu Zhi: \"This Auntie, many thanks. You didn't save a child, you saved our family!\"His wife's body got damaged when she gave birth to Tian You. It was estimated that she will not be able to give birth again in this life. He had a strong relationship with his wife and never thought of getting divorced and remarried. In other words, Tian You will be their only child.If she hadn't rescued Tian You today, Shen Family would have broke apart!Once again, Qiao Xiu Zhi expressed that it was nothing and refused the other's invitation to their home for entertainment.It was getting late. If they don't go back now, they'll be travelling at night.Seeing that she was so determined, Shen Family didn't force it. Still, they insisted on asking for her address and stated that they would come to thank her in person in a few days.Old Madam Shen even asked her daughter Shen Lin Lin to buy a lot of biscuits, candies, and canned oranges for them to take back.This time, Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't refuse.She never liked to push things around like other people as she thought it was a waste of time.The person who was most reluctant about Da Qiao and her grandmother's departure was Shen Tian You.His fleshy fat paws grabbed Da Qiao's little hand and spoke, \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, I will go over to find you to play in a few days!\"Shen Lin Lin chuckled with a \"puchi\". She rubbed her nephew's hair and said, \"You are one year younger than Da Qiao. You should call her Elder Sister Da Qiao, not Younger Sister!\"Shen Tian You raised his paws and compared himself with Da Qiao: \"But she is so much shorter than me. How could she be Elder Sister?\"When hitting people, you don't go for their faces. Nor do you expose shortcomings when exposing them.Height had always been a mental illness for Da Qiao. Now hearing his words, she instantly became a puffer fish.She threw off the other's hoof angrily and retorted in her milky voice, \"I will grow taller. I will grow taller than you in the future!\"Shen Tian You chased after her and tried to butter her: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, don't be angry. How about we grow the same height. What do you think?\"Da Qiao pondered about it for a while and felt that it could work: \"Alright then. However, you aren't allowed to call me short in the future.\"Shen Tian You nodded like a pecking chick: \"Okay. I won't say. Then you can't say I'm fat.\"Da Qiao frowned: \"But you are indeed a little fat.\"Shen Tian You: \"...\"Can't we play on friendly-terms?Shen Ffamily couldn't help be amused when they saw Shen Tian You's deflated appearance.After making an appointment with Shen Tian You to meet again in a few days, Da Qiao went back with her grandmother.As soon as they walked out of the department store, a man rushed over and threw the thing in his hand at Qiao Xiu Zhi. After throwing it, he turned around and ran as if a ghost was chasing behind him.Qiao Xiu Zhi opened the bag and saw that there were several packets of snacks and ten jins of pork inside. Thinking about it, the three men must had pooled the money together to buy it.Maybe they were afraid of rejection, so they threw it to her in this way.Qiao Xiu Zhi was a little speechless. Still, she accpeted the things.Back at Qili Village, everyone saw Qiao Xiu Zhi returning with a large bag and a small bag. They were very curious: \"Xiu Zhi, why did you buy so many things? Show me.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi stated, \"If you can take things away from me, take them and see.\"Everyone: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi saw that no one dared to come forward to do it, so she took Da Qiao back to the Qiao's old house.As soon as they entered the door, they heard Qiao Zhen Guo's voice coming from the house: \"Wife, you scared me to death. Why did you become a roast pig?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don't say roasting pigs and the likes. Tell me what's going on with her!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi rolled her eyes and mentally reminded herself: This was her own son. Biological son! Can't be beaten to death like a wild boar!Qiao Zhen Guo frowned and replied, \"Mom, my wife's face is as red as a roasted pig. Such a big person lying there. When I entered, I thought I saw a roasted pig.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi: \"...Is she having a fever?\"Qiao Zhen Guo scratched his head: \"Shouldn't be. She is so sturdy. She has never been sick.\"Can't blame Qiao Zhen Guo for not think about getting sick. The main reason was that the two have been married for more than ten years and Wan Chun Ju had never been sick. Not even a cold.Qiao Xiu Zhi: \"Stop yelling about. I'll go in and have a look.\"Qiao Zhen Guo didn't dare to delay after hearing what his mom said and hurried in with his mom.Qiao Xiu Zhi went in and saw that Wan Chun Ju was lying on the bed. Her face was flushed red. At first glance, she did look like a roast pig.She coughed and spoke, \"Your daughter-in-law has a fever. You're are such a grown man and don't even have the slightest sense. Why don't you hurry up and carry your wife to the clinic?\"Qiao Zhen Guo didn't get angry when his mom scolded him. He put his wife on his back and rushed out the door.On the way, he ignored the people in the village who greeted him, and dashed all the way.The people in the village immediately got into an discussion again. All kinds of speculation were made.\"Did you see it just now? Old Eldest Qiao ran to the clinic with his wife on his back.\"\"I saw. I saw. His wife's face is as red as a monkey's butt. Could something have happened?\"\"Eight out of ten, something happened. Say, what's up with Qiao Family and Fang Family. It's like a competition. One misfortune after another.\"Fang Family had been unlucky recently. Fang Fu Gui's legs hadn't healed yet and old woman Fang twisted her waist. Both mother and son were lying on the bed and couldn't move.There was also a seven-eight-month-old baby girl at home, who was waiting to be fed. This time, it was hard on Fang Fu Gui's wife.One person had to take care of the five members in Fang Family. All of them were like Master.Although Fang You Liang wasn't little anymore, it was a pity that he is spoiled. Don't even think about having him help his mom to reduce the burden. It was good enough that he didn't cause trouble.Fang Fu Gui's wife was as busy as a spinning top these days. Within a few days, she was so thin that she lost her shape. And there were heavy eye circles under her eyes.Everyone thought that Fang Fu Gui's wife was unlucky. Some people said that Fang Xiao Juan had no conscience. Her maternal family was like this and she never thought about going back to help.The female doctor at the health clinic checked Wan Chun Ju's temperature. When she saw it, it was thirty-nine and a half degrees!If it was a few minutes later, she will really become a roast pig!She swept a glance at Qiao Zhen Guo and said with a cold expression, \"Sir, do you have any grudge with your wife? To actually send her over so late!?\"As expected, men weren't a good bunch!If his wife burned her brain silly or simply dies of illness, then he can marry another young and beautiful wife!Qiao Zhen Guo didn't hear the other party's cynicism, and shook his head with a foolish smile: \"No grudge.\"The female doctor didn't believe him at all: \"Why didn't you send her here earlier? Since the patient has a fever like this, she must have symptoms early in the morning. Such as being unable to eat...\"Before she could finish, she was interrupted by Qiao Zhen Guo: \"My wife ate three bowls of rice at noon today. Although she ate one bowl less than usual, she can still eat!\"The female doctor: \"...\"Qiao Zhen Guo sighed and added: \"Oh, if I knew eating one less bowl would make her have a fever like this, I would get her to continue to eat no matter what. Don't worry, doctor, I will make her eat four bowls of rice every time in the future!\"The female doctor: \"...\"The female doctor never expected this to be the case. Her little eyes and Qiao Zhen Guo's big eyes stared at each other and didn't say a word for a long time.Because Wan Chun Ju was pregnant, many medicines can't be used. The female doctor first gave her physical cooling.Wan Chun Ju's temperature was too high. And there were no ice cubes in the clinic. So the temperature won't drop for a while.The female doctor frowned: \"Your wife's situation is a little troublesome. Either I give her an injection, or you send her to the town hospital now. Even if your wife is sent to the hospital, they would probably give her an injection.\"Qiao Zhen Guo panicked: \"Is the injection bad for the baby?\"The female doctor assumed that he was the kind of man who only cared about the baby and not the life and death of the woman. Her face became frosty again: \"Injection may cause fetal malformation, but without the injection, your wife may burn her brain silly or even lose her life!\"Qiao Zhen Guo was not angry about getting retorted: \"Then you can give her. If the child is deformed, we will still give birth to it and raise it.\"Although Qiao Zhen Guo often refute his wife, he never thought about getting a divorce, let alone wanting his wife to die. As for the child, if it's born deformed, he would still raise it.The word family was more important than anything else in Qiao Zhen Guo's heart.The female doctor was stunned for a moment, not believing what he said.This female doctor was the first batch of educated youth sent to the countryside to support establishment. She wasn't young, but she was still single.It wasn't that she didn't want to get married. Her fianc\u00e9 got together with her best friend and cheated all of her money. From then on, she felt all guys were scumbags.At this moment, the door of the clinic was pushed open with a squeak. A little dumpling walked in.The female doctor came back to her senses and frowned, \"Child, why did you come here alone? This is the clinic. The place where patients see a doctor. Go outside to play.\"Da Qiao opened her big dark eyes and softly replied, \"Auntie Doctor, I'm not here to play. I'm here to see my eldest aunt.\"Just now at home, she heard her grandmother and her grandfather muttering. Expressing her worry that Eldest Aunt's fever was too severe and would have to take medicine in order to cool down. This would definitely hurt the baby in her belly.But without the medicine, Eldest Auntie would be in danger. After thinking about it, she chased over.Although Eldest Aunt often scold her secretly, she was her cousins' mom. What's more, there was a baby in her belly. She liked her cousins, so she didn't want Eldest Aunt and the baby to have any mishap.Seeing that Da Qiao was so thoughtful, Qiao Zhen Guo reached out and rubbed her head, \"Your eldest aunt hasn't woken up yet. Go back and tell your grandmother that we can't go back until later.\"Da Qiao softly answered: \"I know. But Eldest Uncle, I still want to go over and take a look. Eldest Uncle, can I?\"Naturally, Qiao Zhen Guo didn't object.Da Qiao walked over, took out a milk candy from her pocket, opened the candy wrapper and put the milk candy to Eldest Aunt's mouth, and softly urged, \"Eldest Aunt, wake up and eat a milk candy.\"Using this action, she stuffed the jade beads that had been prepared long ago into Eldest Aunt's mouth.The female doctor spoke up: \"The patient hasn't woken up yet. How can she eat candy? You'll choke her like this. So hurry up...\"Before she could finish speaking, Wan Chun Ju moved her nose and said, \"I seem to smell white rabbit candy...\"After saying that, she instantly opened her eyes and sat up.The female doctor: \"...\"Qiao Zhen Guo looked surprised: \"Wife, you're awake?\"Wan Chun Ju looked around. Completely confused: \"What's wrong with me? Where am I?\"Qiao Zhen Guo sighed and told, \"Wife, you almost turned into a roast pig just now!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"The female doctor saw that Wan Chun Ju was no longer talking nonsense and her mental state was also very good. Reaching out, she checked her forehead. The fever actually subsided!What... was going on?It was so hot just now. How could it be all right in an instant?She turned her head sharply to look at Da Qiao.The female patient recovered after the little girl came. To be precise, the little girl wanted to give her candy just now and then the female patient woke up.Da Qiao blinked at her with a pair of big black grape-like eyes. A look full of ignorance and innocence.The female doctor immediately shook her head. Feeling that she was thinking too much.Qiao Zhen Guo spoke, \"Doctor, didn't you just say you want to give my wife an injection? Why haven't you give it?\"Before the female doctor could speak, Wan Chun Ju called out, \"Why give me an injection? I'm not sick!\"Qiao Zhen Guo told, \"The doctor said that you ate a bowl less of rice. So you got a high fever and she need to give you an injection.\"The female doctor: \"...\"I didn't, don't talk nonsense. Not me!Wan Chun Ju eyed at the female doctor suspiciously: \"Zhen Guo, don't listen to what others say and believe it. I'm in good health. See, my mouth doesn't hurt anymore!\"Saying that, she opened her mouth to show her man.Qiao Zhen Guo leaned over to take a look and uttered in surprise, \"Wife, your long-tongue woman's sores are gone!\"The female doctor: \"...\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"In fact, there was no need to emphasize the word \"long-tongue woman\"!Wan Chun Ju jumped off the hospital bed and stated, \"Zhen Guo, let's go home!\"Seeing that his wife was really fine, Qiao Zhen Quo naturally wouldn't insist on giving her an injection. He called Da Qiao to follow him.When she walked out of health clinic's door, Wan Chun Ju lowered her voice and complained: \"The doctors nowadays are becoming more and more unreliable. In order to make more money, you are deemed sick even when you aren't. When I go back, I must tell the people in the village and prevent them from getting deceived!\"Although she deliberately lowered her voice, she was born with loud voice. Every word she said clearly floated into the female doctor's ears.The female doctor: \"...\"The female doctor suddenly felt that she was a fool for berating her husband just now to protect her.Everyone thought that Wan Chun Ju was seriously ill. To their surprise, they saw her coming back in less than half an hour. So they went up to ask in curiosity.Wan Chun Ju didn't hide it at all. She told everyone that the female doctor wanted to cheat money and deliberately said that she was ill and needed an injection.After hearing this, everyone sighed and expressed that they wouldn't go to the health clinic to see a doctor in the future.This wasn't enough. Wan Chun Ju went to complain to the production team leader. Soon after, the female doctor was transferred and a young male doctor came.At Lin Hui's home.Wang Qiu Ying slapped her daughter's back: \"You damn child. How did you promise me before? You said you wouldn't do stupid things. Then what happened to you today? You went to find old Second Qiao! If you were seen, your reputation will be ruined!\"Lin Hui didn't resist. When her mom was tired, she stated, \"Mom, I want to marry Qiao Zhen Jun.\"As soon as the words dropped, a scream came from outside: \"Someone died!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was frantically hollering around: \"Someone died! Someone died!\"When everyone ran to the ancient well to take a look, they couldn't help but take a deep breath!They saw a woman lying down on the ground. Blood stained all around her. Seeing that she was motionless, she should have died long ago.\"Who is this person? Why does she look so familiar?\"\"Why do I feel that she looks like Fang Fu Gui's wife? She has been wearing this dress for the past few days and has never changed it.\"\"Oh, now that you said that, I remembered! This back does look a lot like her. It can't be her, right? So miserable!\"\"Why are you standing still? Hurry up and help her up. Maybe she's not dead yet?\"\"You do it then. If you can't don't force other!\"\"That's right. If you have the ability, you go up. Just talking nonsense with your mouth. Roll to the side!\"Although the people in the village were enthusiastic, it depended on the situation. Like the last time Lin Hui jumping into the well. Someone saw it and naturally wanted to save her.But now, this person was obviously dead. Taking the step up and turn the person over was bad luck. Secondly, they were afraid of getting caught up in unnecessary trouble.\"Stop arguing. Someone already went to notify the production team leader!\"It seem like the production team leader, Wang Shui Sheng had rushed all the way over.A death in the team was a big deal. It might even affect his position as the production leader.When he saw the woman lying on the ground, his face sank deeper and deeper.When he came over, he still held a glimmer of hope. Hoping that the people in the village had exaggerated, but now...No hope at all.He went up and turned the person over. Everyone gathered over to look and were all so scared that their faces turned white.She was indeed Fang Fu Gui's wife!A big hole smashed on her forehead caught their eyes. Her face was as white as paper and her eyes were tightly closed. There was no breath at all.Wang\u00a0Fu Gui\u00a0Shui Sheng trembled and put his hand under her hose. His face became even paler.No breath!The crowd was suddenly pushed aside. The female doctor, who had been complained by Qiao Zhen Guo and his wife half an hour ago, squeezed in.Wang Shui Sheng saw the doctor arrived and quickly urged her to confirm it again.After the female doctor checked, she confirmed Wang Shui Sheng's guess: \"No pulse. She had been dead for at least half an hour.\"The crowd was sighing again.Although Fang Family was lazy, nobody hate Fang Fu Gui's wife. They felt that she was very pitiful.Some people had discussed her not long ago. They never thought that she would be gone in the blink of an eye.Human life was too fragile. It made people lament.Wang Shui Sheng asked Song Chun Hua, the head of the production's women association to inform Fang Family.When Song Chun Hua came to the door of Fang's house, she heard old woman Fang's scolding: \"Lazy woman seeking death. Went to fetch some water for half a day. Fu Gui, you got to teach your wife a good lesson!\"Then she heard Fang Fu Gui's \"pah\": \"Mom, don't worry. Later, watch how I beat her!\"Song Chun Hua's face turned black with fury!Fang Fu Gui's wife, a sole woman serving such a large family and go to the fields to do farm work. It was enough that they didn't empathize. They also scolded and beat her at will. This family was simply beasts!She suddenly felt that Fang Fu Gui's wife passing away like this might be a relief.She walked in with a cold face and stated, \"Your wife is dead. If you want to beat her, you can only chase her to hell and beat her!\"Old woman Fang and Fang Fu Gui were stunned.What?Dead?How was this possible?She was fine just now!Could this stinky woman come to seek bad luck?Fang Fu Gui put on a harsh expression: \"Don't think I would be afraid of you because you are the head of the women association. If you dare to talk nonsense again, I will report you to the community!\"Song Chun Hua was trembling with anger: \"Go then! If you have the ability, you can limp your way there now! However, you reminded me, I'll go and report how your family abused your wife. Just wait! Also, your wife's is currently beside the ancient well. You decide whether to collect the body or not!\"After finishing, she didn't want to bother with this family anymore and turned around angrily and left.What's more, she made up her mind to report this matter to the community's women association.Although the slogan 'women can hold up half the sky' was now chanted every day, the status of women hadn't changed at all. Many women were still not respected at home. Domestic violence and the likes happened from time to time.She must take the opportunity to rectify it!Seeing Song Chun Hua rushing away, old woman Fang and Fang Fu Gui looked at each other and saw panic in each other's eyes.Could it be... that the slut was really dead?The two finally decided to go over and have a look. If they found out that Song Chun Hua was lying, they wouldn't let it drop!So the mother and son each leaned on a cane and limped toward the ancient well.Although Fang Fu Gui had a broken bone, he had nurtured it for more than a month. If he wanted to, he didn't need to be served by anyone at all.The same was true for old woman Fang. Although she can't go to the field after twisting her waist, she had no problem taking care of herself. She can even help with some light work.But they didn't want to. They want to be landlord master and old madame. They kept squeezing the poor woman!Because of exhaustion, Fang Fu Gui's wife suddenly blacked out when she went to fetch water. So she fell and hit a stone.But at that time, no one went to the ancient well to fetch water. If not, she probably won't have died.Old woman Fang and Fang Fu Gui were hoping for luck. Hoping that Song Chun Hua was talking nonsense. But when they saw the cold, blood-covered corpse beside the ancient well, the mother and son's legs rustled and fell softly to the ground in a sitting position.After being dazed for a while, old woman Fang regained her senses first. She patted her thigh and cried, \"Oh, my poor daughter-in-law, why are you so miserable?\"\"At this moment, she's showing cat's tears for mice. Why didn't she know to treat her better when she was alive?\"\"Ain't that right. The whole family rest and let a single woman taken care of them. I feel tired just watching her. Look at her. She's skinny to the bones!\"\"I say, old woman Fang, put away your cat pee and quickly move your daughter-in-law home. Can't leave her lying there!\" Wang Shui Sheng frowned. Looking completely annoyed.No wonder Qiao Family would rather be criticized and get pointed by someone at the back and break the in-law relationship with Fang Family. Every day, there were so many sh*t matter!Wang Shui Sheng currently felt extremely fortunate that he listened Third Younger Brother's words and divided the family on the third day after Fang Xiao Juan entered the door. If not, there will be more things in the future!Old woman Fang spoke, \"Nephew Wang, I am in-law with your Wang Family. Shouldn't you step out to help at this time?\"Wang Shui Sheng responded with a cold face: \"I have to report the matter to the community. How can I have the time to help you!\"After he finished speaking, he ignored old woman Fang and departed.Old woman Fang was furious!...The whole village was talking about the death of Fang Fu Gui's wife. Qiao Family was no exception.Wan Chun Ju sighed: \"That's why, people should eat and drink when they should. Maybe they will be gone in the next moment!\"Qiao Zhen Guo said, \"Wife, don't worry. You will definitely live to a hundred years.\"Wan Chun Ju thought that her man was reluctant to part with her. Her face was sweetened. She sent a proud glance at little bum Chen Qiao Qiao.Chen Qiao Qiao looked calm. Because she knew that things wouldn't be so simple.Sure enough, the next moment, she heard Qiao Zhen Guo add: \"Mom said that a calamity last a thousand years. Wife, you may live longer than me with your level of troublemaking!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zzhi rolled her eyes: \"I never said that.\"Qiao Zhen Guo looked at his mom in confusion: \"Isn't that what you said, Mom?\"He remembered that ninety percent of these words were from his mom. He remembered it clearly.Qiao Xiu Zhi expressed that she didn't want to speak.Wan Chun Ju was boiling with anger. Once again, she pushed the bowl away: \"I'm so full of anger today. I won't eat it!\"\"That can't do, wife!\" Unexpectedly, Qiao Zhen Guo changed from before. Instead of happily pouring his wife's rice into his own bowl, he was the first to stand and reject it.Wan Chun Ju felt that she had saved a little face and looked at her man with her chin raised.If he said a few more good words to coax her, she could consider continuing this meal.Qiao Zhen Guo sighed and said, \"The female doctor said before that you will have a fever only if you eat less one less bowl of rice. So you should continue eating. Oh, the pigs won't get sick after eating two less bites. Wife, say, why do you burn like that after eating less?\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"She knew that she shouldn't expect anything!Simply pissing her off!Chen Qiao Qiao held the laughter in until her stomach hurt.Well done, Eldest Brother!Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at Wan Chun Ju and spoke, \"You guys haven't explained what happened earlier?\"Before going to the clinic, her fever was clearly that high. Why did it suddenly heal in less than half an hour?Even after taking an elixir, it couldn't be so fast!Qiao Zhen Guo scratched his head and replied, \"I don't know either. The female doctor took her temperature and said it was 39.5 degrees. If the temperature couldn't be lowered, she would have to give her an injection. Then Da Qiao came over and my wife suddenly woke up. Everything was fine. Mom, don't you find this a little strange?\"Da Qiao, who was sitting by the side eating, felt her heart pounding. As if a bunny had been put in it.She focused on the rice in the bowl and didn't dare to raise her head. For fear that everyone would see her guilty conscience.Qiao Zhen Jun remarked: \"This strange? Is there a mistake? If she have a thirty-nine and a half degrees fever, it won't get better soon.\"His eldest sister-in-law currently looked better than before!Wan Chun Ju sat down and harrumphed, \"There was a mistake! The female doctor deliberately said that I had a fever in order to cheat money. Do I look like I have a fever?\"Qiao Zhen Guo examined his wife, nodded and said, \"Certainly, don't look like it. Have you ever seen a person with a high fever who ate three bowls of rice and a big bowl of meat in one meal?\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi meaningfully eyed at Da Qiao. Then she raised her head to exchange glances with Xue Chuan.She coughed and spoke, \"This should be the female doctor's mistake. However, it's better to leave lifeline as a person. Don't randomly talk about it when you go out in the future, understand?\"Wan Chun Ju let out a \"squeak\" in her heart and looked at her mother-in-law with a guilty conscience, \"Mom, I already spread it everywhere. I even went to the production team leader to complain about the female doctor.\"Everyone: \"...\"Qiao Zhen Guo: \"Wife, I told you last time that you gossip and you didn't believe it. Look, your long-tongue woman's sores only got better. If you continue again, maybe tomorrow the long-tongue woman's sore will come back!\"Wan Chun Ju flushed with irk: \"...Qiao Zhen Guo, can you stop farting!\"Qiao Zhen Guo was stunned: \"Wife, I didn't fart!\"Everyone: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi couldn't bear to watch this pair of idiots anymore. She took out the things from Shen Family and the three men.When everyone saw the table full of milk candies, fruit candies, and various snack biscuits, they couldn't help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.\"Mom, did Ganoderma lucidum sell for a lot of money?\" Wan Chun Ju was no longer angry. Her eyes brightened like a thief.If it hadn't been sold for a lot of money, how could her mother-in-law be so extravagant all of a sudden?Others' eyes were also glowing. Almost blinding Qiao Xiu Zhi.Qiao Xiu Zhi briefly explained what happened today. However, she didn't tell everyone the true identity of Shen Family.She didn't take it to heart when Shen Family said they would come to visit in person in a few days.Qiao Zhen Jun beckoned Da Qiao to come over and he looked up and down to see that she was injured or not. Only then he was relieved: \"Be careful when you go out in the future. If you encounter such fierce people, try not to provoke them, understand?\"Da Qiao nodded obediently: \"I know, I'm very good.\"Qiao Zhen Jun was sucker-punched by his daughter's adorableness. Hed felt more and more guilty for not taking good care of her before.When Wan Chun Ju knew that Ganoderma lucidum hadn't been sold, she was slightly disappointed. But her attention was soon attracted by the food on the table.She glanced around, touched her slightly bulging belly, and commented, \"Oh, say Zhen Guo, isn't our youngest son blessed? He just came and his grandmother brought him so much delicious food. What a lucky child!\"Qiao Zhen Guo: \"Wife, you think too much. These things are others' gratitude. Not bought by Mom.\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Her mind was simply f*cked up!Could this man learn how to cooperate with her for once?Of course she knew those things were gifts for her mother-in-law. She said that because she wanted to take advantage of her pregnancy. How could he be so stupid?Little bum Chen Qiao Qiao smilingly pointed out, \"Eldest Sister-in-law, don't always use your pregnancy as an excuse. If you want to eat, just tell Mom directly. Our mom is never a stingy person.\"Wan Chun Ju immediately became upset: \"What do you mean? When did I say Mom is stingy? You...\"\"BOOM!\"Qiao Xiuzhi slapped her palm on the table: \"Shut up!\"The house was silent.Everyone's eyes fell on the table. A little worried that the table would suddenly burst apart.Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at the two daughters-in-law and stated, \"Everything is divided into five shares. One share is for me and your dad. The rest is between you four branch. No one has more or less. Does anyone have any opinion?\"Qiao Zhen Guo: \"Mom, Dad, give it all for you to eat. We don't have any opinion.\"Qiao Zhen Min and Qiao Hong Xia nodded in suit.Chen Qiao Qiao did not speak.Only Wan Chun Ju felt displeased inside.Even though it seem fair, it wasn't fair at all for their first branch.There was only one child each in the other branch. Qiao Zhen Jun and Qiao Hong Xia were divorced. There were only two people in their branch. While there were five people in their first branch, which included three children.Secondly, she gave birth to the only golden grandson of Qiao Family and she was pregnant with another. No matter what, she should get special treatment. But with her mother-in-law, there was nothing!Really pissed her off!But at this moment, she didn't dare to get on her mother-in-law's bad side. She could only swallow her anger back into her stomach.It went without saying Qiao Xiu Zhi noticed Wan Chun Ju's displeasure. So what?The things were hers. She can divide them how she wants. If they find it too little, then earn it by themselves!The two daughters-in-law cleaned up the dishes and went to wash the dishes together.Qiao Xiu Zhi asked her daughter about today's household registration matter: \"Did Zhao Family make it difficult for you today?\"Qiao Hong Xia shook her head. Question marks flashed in her eyes: \"They didn't. Zhao Family was very straightforwardly complying today.\"So complying that it wasn't like their family's character at all.\"What happened?\" Qiao Xiu Zhi asked again.Qiao Hong Xia shook her head: \"Nothing happened.\"Seeing that Qiao Hong Xia didn't want to say anything, Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't ask any further.Qiao Zhen Jun raised his head to look at his parents a few. He wanted to tell them that Lin Hui came to find him, but he couldn't open the mouth.In the end, he still didn't mention it even until his eldest brother carried him back to Qiao's old house.One child hesitated and the other was the same.Qiao Xiu Zhi watched the few people disappear into the night until she couldn't see them at all. Only then she regained her senses. Turning back, she collided with her husband's gaze.Xue Chuan came over, grabbed her hand, and comforted, \"As the saying goes, children and grandchildren have their own blessing. They have grown up. They should learn to handle many things by themselves.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded: \"You're right. However, as the saying goes, raising a child one hundred years, ninety-nine years of them are worrying. How can a parent really not care?\"The two walked into the room hands in hands. Xue Chuan pressed her onto the kang and personally massaged her shoulders, \"Enough. Don't think about it anymore. While Da Qiao. She seems to be a little different.\"Today, Wan Chun Ju's thirty-nine and a half degree was sudden better. Although the process was broke up and glossed over, this matter couldn't withstand any scrutiny.Once someone pay attention to it, they will find the weirdness in it.Qiao Xiu Zhi had experienced miraculous things herself, so she wasn't afraid of these things: \"I had some suspicion before. That child's stuttering was so serious and suddenly it got better. Also her body and skin. Our body illness too.\"Xue Chuan nodded. He continued her words: \"There is still the matter of Yi Ming and the century-old Ganoderma lucidum. This adventure to the department store too.\"Saving people was an ordinary thing. But casually saving a bigwig wasn't a casual thing.A slight seriousness appeared on Qiao Xiu Zhi's face: \"I'm afraid that child will experience some adventures. Since she didn't want to talk about it, let's cover it up for her.\"Right now that\u00a0the old four were getting destroyed,\u00a0everywhere. If it's rumored that this child is a lucky star, it will not be a good thing for her.Xue Chuan: \"I'll listen to you.\"Qiao Family was calm for two days. But this calm was broken by Qiao Zhen Min's return three days later.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if there is a flower thief, he will not set his eyes on you.\"His mom said that when a woman is pregnant, her temper will become very strange. He deeply understood it now.For the past two days, his wife had been complaining that he didn't know how to speak. Saying that when he opened his mouth, he will make people mad. He felt very aggrieved. He had always been an honest person and always spoke the truth.He was so harassed that he had to secretly observe the idler in the village to see how they coaxed people for the sake of the child in the belly.He felt that he had mastered part of the essence now. First, he should speak with a slanted mouth. Secondly, he should be humorous. He felt that what he said just now was very good.Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"F*ck off!How could this man do this? Every time he opened his mouth, it pierced her heart like a hornet's nest!Simply driving her mad!Chen Qiao Qiao tightly grasped the edge of the kang table. Her mouth kept twitching.Damn, what should she do? She desperately wanted to laugh?Eldest Brother looked like he had epilepsy just now. However, he seemed to think he was so cool!\"WOOF WOOF...\"Outside, Qiao You Rou growled louder and louder. Although it was a puppy less than three months old, he was still very fierce in the face of strangers.\"Be good You Rou. Stop barking and I'll come back and give you meat!\"Qiao Zhen Min had stayed at home for a short time. It seem the yellow puppy had already forgotten him.Seeing the nonstop barking now, he was as anxious as the ants on a hot pan as he feared attracting neighbors' notice.When Qiao Xiu Zhi came out, she saw her youngest son coaxing the puppy anxiously: \"Zhen Min, is that you?\"When Qiao Zhen Min saw his mom coming, he breathed a sigh of relief and responded in a hushed voice, \"Mom, it's me. Hurry up and stop the barking. This stupid dog have forgotten me so soon!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi lectured Qiao You Rou a few sentences.Qiao You Rou aggrievedly let out an \"ah woo\". He laid on the ground and looked at the female owner with big wet eyes.It seem to be saying: I work so hard to watch the house and you still lecture me. This baby feel aggrieved.Qiao Zhen Guo looked at his younger brother's thief-like appearance and said in a low voice, \"Fifth Younger Brother, why don't you use the door? No need to climb over the wall?\"Qiao Zhen Min pushed his eldest brother and said, \"Go in. Let's go in and talk about it.\"When everyone saw him like this, they felt a little drum beat in their hearts.Especially Wan Chun Ju. A big drama had already formed in her mind.The more she looked at Youngest Brother, the more he looked like a criminal absconding.Did Youngest Brother kill someone?Or did he steal something from the supply and demand cooperative?The more she thought about it, the more frightened she became. She regretted not getting her man and her mother-in-law propose separating the family earlier!After everyone came in, Qiao Zhen Min closed the doors and windows tightly. Then he took out something wrapped in black cloth from his embrace.After the black cloth was opened, there was actually a layer of oil paper inside. Everyone's heart was lifted high.When the oiled paper was lifted, the contents were finally revealed... The two big bundles of tenner notes!Everyone's eyes almost fell to the ground. Their mouths were so wide that one could stuff eggs in.Even though Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan guessed that the Ganoderma lucidum could be sold for high price, they were still very shocked to see so much money.Wan Chun Ju swallowed a mouthful of saliva and felt short of breath: \"Mom, a lot of money!\"After she said that, she rolled her eyes and passed out!Wan Chun Ju fainted for two reasons.First, she had never seen so much money in her life, so she was so excited. And secondly, she scared herself. She thought she had guessed right- Youngest Brother had really committed a crime!If he stole so much money, he would definitely be shot if he was caught. Instead of running far, he brought the money back. This was burying the whole family with him!Qiao Zhen Guo was so excited that he was in a daze. But seeing his wife faint, he immediately recovered and carried her to the kang to lie down.Qiao Xiu Zhi asked, \"Old Fifth, how much money is there in total?\"Qiao Zhen Min's eyes swept over everyone before lowering his voice, \"A total of two... thousand yuan!\"Two thousand yuan!When Wan Chun Ju, who had just woken up, heard this, she rolled her eyes again and fainted for the second time!\"Wife, when did you become so weak?\"Qiao Zhen Guo had finally pinched his wife awake. Who knew she would faint again just after opening her eyes.Oh, what was this considered?It was a big loss to raise this kind of physical quality with four bowls of rice every meal!Chen Qiao Qiao, who had been silent for a while, had trembled when she heard two thousand yuan.Fortunately, she was much stronger than Wan Chun Ju. She didn't faint.Qiao Xiu Zhi said, \"How did you sell it for so much?\"Before, she thought that it was pretty good to sell it for about 800 yuan.Eight hundred yuan wasn't enough to buy two houses in the town. But there was some savings at home and it will be enough using it to supplement.She really didn't expect for it to sell for so much money!\"They found someone to inspect it. The total height of Mount Tai Ganoderma lucidum was 68cm and the width was 60cm. The age should be more than 180 years. Such a Ganoderma lucidum is hard to come by. There are a lot of people vying for it at 2,000 yuan!\"It had been half a day since Qiao Zhen Min got the money. He was still very high.If this Ganoderma lucidum can be auctioned publicly, it will definitely be more than this price!But the current market didn't allow it. He can only find the most secure buyer.Xue Chuan was the most calm among all the people. When he was a child, he had seen all kinds of treasure in his family before his family completely fallen.Later that he became very poor. Over the years, he was incompetent. Not only did he failed to let his wife and children live a good life, but in turn he needed his wife to take care of him everywhere.Many people ridiculed him that he lost the dignity of a man when he married into the female's family. But they didn't know, what did dignity count as when he could marry Qiao Xiu Zhi as his wife?If there is a next life, he will also marry into her family as her little husband!Qiao Xiu Zhi rewrapped the money, looked at the crowd and declared, \"I have already made arrangements for this money with your dad. We will talk about the specifics when everyone gather around tomorrow. Now all of you go back to rest.\"Everyone watched helplessly as the money was packed away and then disappeared from sight. They sighed silently in their hearts.Tonight, forget about sleeping.Anyone who suddenly saw so much money and knew that this money belongs to their family won't be able to sleep!Of course, the first branch was an exception.Wan Chun Ju fainted and fell asleep. After Qiao Zhen Guo carried his wife back to the room, he laid down on the bed and didn't fall asleep in a second like usual.After all, he was stirred up. So this time he spent a total of one minute to slumber.In fifth branch's room.Like the other children, Qiao Dong Wan went to bed early. She was currently sleeping on the kang with her cheeks flushed.Qiao Zhen Min walked in, bowed his head, and kissed his daughter's face.Maybe because the movement was too big, Qiao Dong Wan was woken up.Qiao Dong Wan opened her eyes with a worried expression. She glanced at her dad and soon fell asleep again.\"How's little Wan'er doing recently? Have she played with her cousins?\"Qiao Zhen Min was fluffed by his daughter's sleepy appearance. He wished he could to hold her in his arms and kiss her a few times.Chen Qiao Qiao shook her head: \"Still the same. Always squatting under the tree and watching the ants. What do you think is going on with this child?\"They had took the child to the city hospital for examination. The doctor said that the child's vocal cords and ears were fine. Her brain was fine. It was just she didn't like talking.Many times when you speak to her, she obviously heard it. But she pretended not to hear anything. Completely pretending that you didn't exist!Every time it was like this, Chen Qiao Qiao felt pissed off!Qiao Zhen Min sighed. There was some unspeakable sadness in his heart.He had injury at that place. He may never have a second child in his life. And this child was like this.Chen Qiao Qiao fetched water to wash her man's face and feet: \"Why didn't you come back tomorrow?\"Qiao Zhen Min glanced at her: \"Look at what you're saying. With so much money on me, how can I dare to stay in the dormitory?\"Chen Qiao Qiao pondered and agreed.Qiao Zhen Min glanced at his daughter again and stated, \"I want to borrow money from our mom and then take little Wan'er to the provincial hospital to have a look. Maybe a doctor can find out what's wrong with her.\"Chen Qiao Qiao's eyes flashed. Her mouth twitched twice and finally noddingly responded an 'okay'.Actually, if it was up to her, it was better to save the money and check him.Their daughter can eat and drink. She was a little withdrawn. Not a big problem at all.It was just that her man had always regarded his daughter as a treasure. He would definitely be displeased to hear her say that. So she swallowed the words in the end.Qiao Xiu Zhi put the money in the closet box and locked it. Then she blew out the candle and laid down on the bed.Xue Chuan stretched out his hand, grasped his wife's hand, and whispered, \"Do you really want to do that tomorrow?\"He had no problem with giving a quarter of the money to buy a house in town for Da Qiao.He was certain that Hong Xia and their two sons would have no objection. However, the two daughters-in-law.Qiao Xiu Zhi responded: \"Don't worry. I can still call the shots in this family!\"She wasn't afraid of the daughter-in-laws acting up. Nor was she afraid that they won't support her in the future. She was very confident in the children she raised.After working until noon the next day, all the children were kicked out. Only the adults of Qiao Family gathered in the main room.Qiao Xiu Zhi took out two thousand yuan.When seeing the money, Qiao Zhen Jun and Qiao Hong Xia had the same reaction as the others last night. Uniformly popped eyes and opened mouth.Wan Chun Ju was sitting next to her now. She didn't faint for the third time, but her cheeks were flushed. She was obviously very eager.Qiao Zhen Guo glanced at his wife and said, \"Wife, you can't faint anymore. If you faint again, your philtrum will be broken!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Everyone turned their head to Wan Chun Ju and saw that there were obvious nail prints on her philtrum. Red and swollen marks. They didn't know whether to laugh or sympathize with her.Qiao Xiu Zhi scanned everyone's faces and stated, \"I have already had plans for this money with your dad. You guys listen. If you have any opinions, you can mention it after I finish speaking. Don't interrupt me in the middle, otherwise don't blame me for not giving you face!\"Everyone gulped a mouthful of saliva and nodded quickly.Qiao Xiu Zhi said: \"A hundred years Ganoderma lucidum sold for a total of 2,000 yuan. This Ganoderma lucidum was discovered by Da Qiao. If it weren't for her, let alone 2,000 yuan, there wouldn't even be 20 yuan. So I plan to take out 500 yuan and buy a house in town for her.\"As soon as her voice fell, there was a gasp in the room.Qiao Zhen Jun was a little anxious.He felt that his daughter shouldn't take so much money. But thinking of what his mom said just now, he didn't dare to speak rashly.Wan Chun Ju and Chen Qiao Qiao both clenched their fists together. The word written on their faces at the same time: Why?However, they didn't dare to speak up.Qiao Zhen Guo was a mommy boy. He had no objection to whatever his mom said.As for Qiao Zhen Min, he did feel a little uncomfortable in his heart. He soon digested this discomfort.Just like what his mom said, Da Qiao found this century-old Ganoderma lucidum. If it wasn't for her, everyone wouldn't get a penny.Now, they receive such a huge benefit as well. What else was there to complain about?Qiao Xiu Zhi took in everyone's faces and continued: \"In addition, I want to take out five hundred yuan to buy another house in the town. The name written on this house is old Fifth.\"Before it was for Da Qiao, Wan Chun Ju could hold back. But when she heard this, she couldn't hold back: \"Mom, doing this is so unfair!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi gave her a cold look: \"Shut up or go out by yourself?\"Wan Chun Ju was furious!Qiao Zhen Guo spoke, \"Mom said ugly people are more likely to act up. Wife, don't be like this all the time.\"Wan Chun Ju was so angry that she almost vomited blood: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi continued: \"Although the name written is old Fifth, it's not old Fifth's. This is so that he can become a permanent worker. After the become a permanent employee, the salary will increase. At that time, old Fifth will bring 60% of the salary home. Old Fifth, think about it yourself. Give me an exact answer later.\"\"For the remaining 1,000 yuan, I'm going to spend 300 yuan to repair the house. The other 700 yuan will not be used for the time being. In the future, I will use it as the children's education fund. Whether it's a grandson or a granddaughter, as long as they can study, I will provide for their study.\"After she finished speaking, she looked at everyone and declared, \"You can speak now. One by one. Who wants to speak first?\"Wan Chun Ju wanted to protest, but she was scolded just now. She was still a little scared. After thinking about it, she won't be this early bird.Qiao Zhen Jun wanted to speak, but unfortunately his mom didn't even give him a glance.Qiao Zhen Jun: ...Qiao Zhen Guo had no objection and so it was negligible.In the end, it was only Qiao Zhen Min: \"Mom, I don't want the house.\"Hearing her man's words, Chen Qiao Qiao's face changed.But she was used to letting her husband call the shots outside, so she forcefully swallowed it down.Qiao Zhen Min continued: \"I'm not going to work for the supply and demand cooperative. So don't need to buy this house. However, I plan to borrow money from Mom and Dad. I want to take little Wan'er to the province to have a look. Little Wan'er always ignores people like this. I'm afraid there is something wrong with her.\"The work at supply and demand cooperative was pretty good before. But since the new director came, he had been suppressed at every corner.He had recently met a group of new friends and gained new ideas. The specifics hadn't been determined yet. If her mother hadn't suddenly started talking about this matter, he wouldn't have planned to say it.Qiao Xiu Zhi has never showed preference for sons over daughters. Naturally she won't refuse: \"Little Wan'er indeed have a problem. You can take her to the provincial hospital for a check-up. If the provincial hospital doesn't work, then go to the capital.\"\"Mom, thank you!\" Qiao Zhen Min couldn't help but reddened his eyes.But what he didn't expect was that this trip had become the most regretful decision he had ever made in his life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You want to say that Da Qiao is still young and don't need to buy her a house, right?\"Under his mom's pressuring gaze, Qiao Zhen Jun suddenly felt that his head was thousand gold heavy. He couldn't continue for a long time.When his mom announced this decision just now, he saw everyone's expressions.He was very happy that his parents love Da Qiao, but if this matter wasn't handled properly, it will inevitably lead to family conflicts. Da Qiao may get rejected by his family!He really didn't want to see this happen.Qiao Xiu Zhi stated: \"I said it just now. The century old Ganoderma lucidum was found by Da Qiao. You guys coincidentally rubbed in some benefits. She deserves this house. Even when you are her dad, you have no right to refuse for her. Also, you don't have the ability to buy it for her. You got the shame to push out the benefits that you have obtained. You are really her dad!\"Qiao Zhen Jun: ...You are also a mom!Qiao Zhen Jun blushed like a cooked shrimp. At the same time, he felt very guilty.That's right. He had no ability to give his daughter a good life. Now he want to refuse her chance of living a good life. Was he really her dad?Qiao Zhen Jun fell into a deep doubt about himself.\"Next!\" Qiao Xiu Zhi domineeringly called as she scanned the crowd.The flesh on Wan Chun Ju's face trembled.If she hadn't been sitting on a chair, she would have fallen to the ground with her weak legs.She was scared to death. She frantically winked at her man, but her man couldn't understand it!Simply driving her mad!The only thing left to do now was to brave it!Otherwise, if she pass this village, she would miss the store. If she don't speak out now, she will never have the opportunity to talk about it in the future!\"Mom...\" This 'Mom' trembled so much that everyone could hear it.\"Mom, I don't want to oppose you buying a house for Da Qiao. However, it wasn't just Da Qiao who went. Dong He and Dong Ying were there too.\"Her eyes suddenly fell on Qiao Hong Xia: \"That's right. Hong Xia's Little Yi Ming also went. I heard that he entered that forest in order to chase a butterfly. Everyone benefited due to him, no?\"Wan Chun Ju knew that it was impossible to stop her mother-in-law from buying a house for Da Qiao, so she wanted to muddy the water now.If she was to be rewarded, then everyone should be rewarded together. Can\u2019t favor one over the other!Qiao Hong Xia glanced at her and chilly spoke: \"Mom, Little Yi Ming doesn't understand anything. Don't need to give him anything! Besides, he was chasing the butterfly to give his Elder Sister Nian Nian. So I agree with Mom's words. Everyone benefited due to Da Qiao!\"Anyone who wasn't stupid can see Wan Chun Ju's little thoughts.She won't \"team up\" with her!She still remembered the despair when the doctor deemed Little Yi Ming unsavable. It wasn't an exaggeration to say that the sky was torn apart. But after Da Qiao arrived, the child miraculously recovered.She didn't know if Da Qiao played any role in it. In short, she believed that Da Qiao brought good luck to Little Yi Ming!If she had the ability, she would be happy to let buy a house for Da Qiao herself!Hearing Qiao Hong Xxia's words, Wan Chun Ju almost vomited blood!What the hell was going on with Qiao Family. Each and every one acted like money was dung. Making her look so vulgar!So vexing!After some struggle, she finally turned to little bum Chen Qiao Qiao: \"Fifth Sister-in-law, don't you want to say a few words?\"\"Eldest Sister-in-law, I don't have any objection. I will listen to Mom.\"Chen Qiao Qiao felt uncomfortable when she heard that her mother-in-law say she was going to buy a house for Da Qiao.But then Mother-in-law was willing to buy a house in the town in order to let her man become a permanent employee. What else could she complain about?She was more anxious about asking her man why he doesn't want to work in the supply and demand cooperative. Why didn't he tell her about it last night?Wan Chun Ju was so angry that a mouthful of blood was stuck in her chest: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at Wan Chun Ju: \"You said that Dong He and Dong Ying also went to the forest that day. I asked them both, and they said that they had looked around. They didn't find notice any century-old Ganoderma lucidum. If it wasn't for Da Qiao, this Ganoderma lucidum will never reach our Qiao Family's. So what are you dissatisfied with now?\"Wan Chun Ju: \u2026She had a lot of dissatisfaction, but was what she say effective?\"Since everyone has no objection, then this matter is decided.\" Qiao Xiu Zhi slammed the hammer, \"People's hearts are originally biased. I dare not say that I'm absolutely fair. But as long as you don't do Qiao Family wrong, I will absolutely not treat anyone badly!\"Was there absolute fair in this world?No!So Qiao Xiu Zhi never said that she was a fair person. She would never be as biased as Fang Xiao Juan and let herself be fooled.Qiao Zhen Guo smiled naively: \"Mom, whatever you say is whatever goes. We'll all listen to you.\"The rest also expressed they had no objection.Neither daughter-in-law uttered a sound. Still, everyone could tell that Wan Chun Ju was very displeased.Of course, this didn't include Qiao Zhen Guo.Qiao Zhen Guo went out humming a tune: \"Bright sky above the liberated zone, the people there love it...\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"They were already at a disadvantage and he had the mood to sing. Sing what bloody songs!Once back in the room, Wan Chun Ju exploded: \"Zhen Guo, I know you listen to your mom. But can't you think about your wife and children for once?\"Qiao Zhen Guo was befuddled again: \"Wife, what's wrong with you?\"\"What's wrong with me!\" Wan Chun Ju picked up the pillow and slammed it on the bed, \"Mom wants to buy a house for Da Qiao in the town. While An Ping, Qiao Family's only grandson doesn't even get a fart? This is fair?\"Qiao Zhen Guo nodded: \"It's fair. Ganoderma lucidum wasn't dug by An Ping!\"Wan Chun Ju almost didn't couldn't catch her breath. She was pissed off to death: \"Okay. An Ping didn't go. What about Dong Ying and Dong He? Even if the two sisters didn't find Ganoderma lucidum, they had dug it out. There's still effort, even if there's no credit. Now they got nothing. Mom said that she isn't biased. Her heart is obviously leaned all the way to the armpit!\"Qiao Zhen Guo: \"Wife, Mom said just now that she is an biased person.\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Infuriating!She doubted whether she would be able to live until her grandson was born if she kept getting angered!Taking a deep breath, she said what she wanted to say the most in her heart: \"Zhen Guo, Wang Family is so wealthy and had already split up. Wouldn't it be better if we split up as well?\"Qiao Zhen Guo finally properly looked at his wife: \"Wife, you want to split off?\"Wan Chun Ju felt guilty under his stare. Still, she bravely nodded: \"I want! Currently, the family living together like this is too noisy. Besides, the trees split off branches when big. Wouldn't it be better for everyone to live apart earlier?\"Currently Qiao Family was simply messed up!Old Second Qiao had obviously separated out, but now he ate three meals a day at Qiao's old house. This was no different from not being separated out!The key point was that he was paralyzed. Most likely this burden will fall on their first branch in the future!Qiao Hong Xia, a divorced daughter, was also at home every day. So annoying!It was humiliating enough to have one divorced person in the family. Now there were two in Qiao family!Every time she went out, she had to be asked about the siblings' divorce. Simply embarrassing to death!Also, if there was no separation, the things in in-law's hands will be poached by Da Qiao sooner or later!She was so cunning at a young age. Why didn't she see it before?Qiao Zhen Guo sighed and said, \"Alright. Since you want to go out, I'll go tell Mom.\"The surprise came too quickly like a tornado.Wan Chun Ju couldn't believe her ears!Her man was finally enlightened!Aiya, she finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel.Wan Chun Ju suddenly felt her nose sour a little.Qiao Zhen Guo walked out while muttering: \"I originally wanted to wait for An Ping to marry his wife, and then separate you out alone. I didn't expect you to have awareness. Now you want to separate out alone.\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"It can't be that she said so much in vain?No, it wasn't in vain. It gave her a man an excuse to separate her out like old woman Yao!Pissing her off!\"Qiao Zhen Guo, come back here. If you dare to tell your mother today, I... I will die for you to see!\"Wan Chun Ju couldn't take it anymore. She laid down on the bed and started sobbing.Qiao Zhen Guo obediently came back: \"Wife, I lied to you just now. I won't tell my mother.\"Wan Chun Ju stopped crying, sat up and looked at him with red eyes: \"You...you really don't plan to go?\"Why was this person so unfamiliar?He knew to use a devious and cunning way to make her afraid first. This was not like her man!Qiao Zhen Guo smiled and responded: \"That's right. If I want to bring it up, have to wait until you given birth to the baby first. If you want to separate out alone, you can't take the child away.\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Familiar taste, familiar recipe.He's still the man who was infuriating as hell!\"Qiao Zhen Guo, I don't want to talk to you. Get out now!\"...Trouble was also brewing in Fang's house at the moment.\"Ouch, my poor daughter, why did you die? Why are you so cruel? To let me, a white-haired mother, send a black-haired person!\"\"My God, my daughter was a flower when she married into Fang's house. Now she was destroyed to such a degree. Now she's not even 30 years old and she's dead. My daughter, you died so wrongly! \"Old Madam Cai was sitting at the door of Fang's courtyard, clapping her thighs as she wailed. Her voice was so loud that she could flip off the ceiling!\"Who are these people? Are they Fan Fu Gui's wife's maternal family?\"\"It is her maternal family. Their daughter was tortured to death. What would it look like if they didn't come? The one sitting on the ground crying is Fang Fu Gui's mother-in-law!\"\"That's right! If my daughter is abused like this, I'll kill their whole family! If it's up to me, don't waste words if you can fight. Hurry up and fight!\"\"Che, do you really think Cai Family is here to fight justice for their daughter? So naive! They just want to take the opportunity to make a fortune from Fang Family!\"If someone really cared about their daughter, would they marry their daughter to Fang Family?It was heard that Fang Fu Gui's wife sobbingly refused to marry. However, Fang Family gave a high wedding gift and her family forced her to marry.Later, she experienced domestic violence a few times and ran back to her maternal home. Her maternal family never supported her. Instead, they told her to bear with it. Didn't all women live like this?So what maternal family? Just a bunch of beasts!When everyone heard this, they didn't have any good attitude toward Cai Family.Cai Family didn't care. They made up their minds today that Fang Family must compensate money, otherwise they won't leave!Old woman Fang leaned on crutches and walked in front of old Madam Cai. She spat in her face with a 'pah': \"Married a short-lived ghost with a two-hundred-yuan wedding gift. You still have the face to come? You should smirk that we didn't ask you for the wedding gift back!\"Old Madam Cai wiped her face with her hands, jumped up, and spat out a mouthful of saliva on old woman Fang's face, \"Old witch, no one was willing to marry your son within a radius of ten miles. My daughter's bum is excellent. What's wrong with asking for two hundred? If we knew earlier that you treat her like this, we shouldn't have asked for so little in the first place!\"Old woman Fang spat back: \"I tell you, our in-law family is the production leader. Wang Family's old Third is a high-ranking official in the army. You'd better scram now, or I'll let you look good!\"Old Madam Cai spat back and uttered, \"Who are you scaring? As if Wang Family would like your broken shoe daughter?\"When the two argued, they spat at each other's face. At first, the two of them would wipe it with their hands. Later, they didn't bother to wipe it at all.Everyone: \"...\"Everyone was so disgusted that they wanted to vomit out the lunch they ate!Someone went to fetch the production team leader, but the production team leader said that this was Fang Family's family matter.Everyone knew that Wang Shui Sheng didn't want to be involved with Fang Family.Old woman Fang had kept taking Wang Family out to threaten Cai Family, but now her face was slapped swollen!\"Hahaha, you keep talking about your in-laws. Why won't your in-laws come to help you?\" Old Madam Cai vividly interpreted the words 'smug villain'.Think they got no brain? They had already figured out the situation before they came!Surprisingly at the end of the fight, it was Xiao Qiao who suffered!Cai Family asked for money, but Fang Family refused to give it. Cai Family\u2019s sons sent all their four family's elderly to live in Fang Family.Each day Fang Family doesn't give money, the four elderly won't leave for a day!No matter how arrogant Fang Fu Gui was, he didn't dare to kill someone. Otherwise he will be shot.Old woman Fang was so angry that her chest hurt. But she didn't want to bow her head, so she sent her two precious grandson to Fang Xiao Juan and asked her to take care of them.Fang Xiao Juan wanted to nurture her pregnancy. It was Xiao Qiao who did the work at home. Now there were two more people.Xiao Qiao exploded on the spot!...Xiao Qiao was so mad that she vomited blood. However, Da Qiao was extremely delighted. Because she found out that she GREW TALLER!The weather was getting warmer day by day. The new clothes her grandmother wanted to make for her hadn't been finished yet. So she can only pull out last year's clothes.When she changed into last year's clothes, she realized that it was so much shorter!She was madly overjoyed.She had always been half a head shorter than her peers. Every New Year, everyone will laugh at her. Saying that she can wear one piece of clothes for several years without having to make new ones.There were also some very naughty children. When they see her, they either name-call her little stutterer or dwarf melon. She felt down every time.Now she didn't stutter. What's more, she had grown taller!After wearing her clothes, she headed to Qiao's old house with a \"thump thump thump\".Qiao Dong Ying saw her coming in wearing old clothes and exaggerated: \"Qiao Family's little Cutie, why are you wear your baby clothes?\"Da Qiao raised her head, showing a sweet smile and softly replied: \"Elder Sister Ying, look. The sleeves are too short!\"Qiao Dong Ying's mind turned fast and immediately understood what she wanted to say. She responded in cooperation, \"Oh, that's amazing. The sleeves became so short. Little Cutie has grown taller?\"Da Qiao's face was flushed and her eyes were black and bright. She nodded with puffed out chest, \"En, little Cutie has grown taller!\"Qiao Dong Ying teased: \"Since you've grown up, you can't be called little Cutie.\"Da Qiao thought about it for a while, pursed her red mouth, and said in a glutinous voice, \"En, then I will be Big Cuite in the future!\"Qiao Dong Ying: \"...\"She seem...to underestimate the thickness of this little younger cousin sister's skin.\"Pfft...\"Qiao Dong He was amused by the conversation between the two. Younger Sister Da Qiao was so adorable and cute!She stepped forward and took Da Qiao's hand, \"The new clothes aren't ready so soon. You can't wear these clothes. Come in with me. I'll find some clothes for you to wear.\"\"Thank you, Elder Sister Dong He. You are the best and most beautiful elder cousin sister in the world!\" Da Qiao's rainbow-licking was thrown out like it was free.Behind, Qiao Dong Ying's teeth felt sour when she heard it: \"Your Elder Sister Dong He is the best and most beautiful. What about me?\"Da Qiao's eyes spun and she sweetly answered, \"Elder Sister Ying is the most awesome!\"Qiao Dong Ying snorted twice. Obviously felt her rainbow-licking wasn't sincere enough.Qiao Dong He picked out the clothes that both her and her younger sister couldn't wear and weren't too shabby. Da Qiao didn't dislike it. But rather, she was extremely happy.She couldn't wear so many clothes. It was a sweet worry.After playing in her Elder Cousin Sister's room for a long time, the few came out of the room. They happened to bump into her fifth uncle's family.She saw that her Fifth Uncle was carrying a few bags and bundles, while her Fifth Aunt was standing behind him holding little Wan'er. It seem like they were going on a trip.The few girls greeted them.Qiao Dong Ying asked, \"Fifth Uncle, are you taking little Wan'er to the provincial hospital?\"Qiao Zhen Min nodded: \"We're going to the town today to stay for one night. Then we'll catch a ride to the provincial capital tomorrow. All of you listen to your grandmother at home. Don't be naughty, understand?\"\"Understand.\" Qiao Dong Ying and Qiao Dong He replied in unison.Qiao Dong He went up to greet little Wan'er, but the other party was the same as before. She didn't give her any response at all.Only Da Qiao frowned tightly.Seeing her like this, Qiao Zhen Min specially asked, \"What's wrong, Da Qiao? You frown like you're an old lady.\"Da Qiao pursed her lips and said, \"Fifth Uncle, are you going on a trip? Can you not go?\"Qiao Zhen Min was stunned for a moment. Thinking that she was a child who was reluctant to part with her family. So he smilingly coaxed, \"Fifth Uncle is taking your younger sister to see the doctor. If it goes well, we'll be back soon.\"Da Qiao persisted on the same thing again: \"Fifth Uncle, can you not go, okay?\"Qiao Zhen Min frowned, wondering why this child was suddenly so insensible?At this moment, his mom came over: \"Da Qiao, why did you tell your fifth uncle not to go?\"Da Qiao shook her head. Her little face flushed red.She couldn't explain it clearly. She just didn't want Fifth Uncle and the others to leave.Qiao Xiu Zhi looked up at her youngest son and spoke, \"Old Fifth, how about going on another day.\"\"Mom! Little Wan'er can't be delayed. Besides, I still have things to do later and won't have time at all!\"Qiao Zhen Min knew that Da Qiao was his mom's favorite. But he never expected his mom to become so unprincipled!Qiao Xiu Zhi remembered the weird things that happened to Da Qiao and stated with a solemn face: \"Old Fifth, Mom knows that you have always been very independent. But this time, listen to Mom and go at another time!\"It wasn't that Qiao Zhen Min didn't want to listen to his mom. Just because a child's reluctance, he must disrupt his plans. He really can't understand!Qiao Zhen Min left in the end.Da Qiao watched her fifth uncle's family's departing back and her eyes suddenly sour. Two lines of tears fell.Two days after Qiao Zhen Min departure, the school finally opened.At the same time, the production team also welcomed a new batch of educated youth.In order to befriend Qiao Family, Wang Shui Sheng asked Qiao Zhen Guo to join him to pick up the educated youth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQili Village didn't have its own school. Children in the village can only go to the community primary school if they want to study.According to the regulations, Da Qiao was originally going to register as a new student in September. But when Xue Chuan was teaching Da Qiao to read, he discovered that she was very smart. Whether it was Chinese or Math, she caught on in one go.The couple discussed it and felt that they couldn't delay any longer. So a few days before the school started, they brought two packs of snacks to the community primary school's principal's house.Principal Li was originally reluctant and stated that they would follow the rules. However, the principal's wife couldn't take her eyes off the two packets of snacks and she took the initiative to accept the snacks.Principal Li was henpecked. He watched his wife take away the snacks without even daring to let out half a fart. He had no choice but to change his mind. He said that he had to test Da Qiao's level before making the decision.He took Qiao Family to the office and took two sets of first-grade exam papers for Da Qiao to do.Da Qiao had already completed the first grade textbooks and half of the second grade textbooks. So after getting the test paper, she took out a pencil from her pocket and started to do it without hesitation.The two sets of papers took a total of one and a half hours.After all, it was a first-grade test paper. Principal Li had no problem marking it on his own. He didn't call any teacher over to mark it. He personally checked it.He picked up the test paper and examined it. His eyes lit up at the sight of the neat handwriting.Principal Li had two grandsons who happen to be in the first grade. The words written by the two children were like chicken feet being stamped through. They were completely incomprehensible.Not bad. It was rare to be able to write so neatly at a young age!And he had heard from her grandparents that she only studied for more than a month in total. If she was as smart as her grandmother said, he can consider accepting her and properly educate her at that time.Thinking of this, the nervousness in Principal Li's heart dissipated a lot.Soon the two sets of test papers were marked. When looking at the two neat one hundred percent, Principal Li's remaining little bit of discomfort completely disappeared without a trace.Principal Li touched his slightly bald head and smiled: \"This child isn't bad. A good child. Let her come to the school to report in two days. Since first grade had been completed, let her transfer to the second grade. If she can't keep up then, she can repeat first grade later.\"With this, it was settled.Day of enrollment arrived.Da Qiao carried the green schoolbag her grandfather made for her. It was embroidered with three little people on it. Her, Grandfather, and Grandmother. After her dad saw it, he felt sad for a long time.Inside the bag were two pencils, an eraser, and a workbook.Oh right! Today was the first day of school. She must put on the most beautiful new clothes. Her hair was brushed smooth and slick and put into two small braids. She stood in front of the mirror. A cute little girl instantly appeared in it.Da Qiao was very satisfied with her dress up. She kept dangling the braids on her head. Her proud and cute appearance fluffed everyone's face red.However, Wan Chun Ju felt extremely uncomfortable when seeing Da Qiao completely dressed in new stuff from head to toe: \"Oh, some people's lives are good. New clothes, new shoes, and new schoolbags. Our pityful An Ping's schoolbag is still the one from three years ago!\"Wan Chun Ju couldn't wrap her head around!An Ping was obviously the only male grandson of Qiao Family. Her parents-in-law should treat him as their favorite. But instead of pampering An Ping, they go to favor that calamity Da Qiao. This made her worked up!Before there was the matter of taking out 500 yuan to buy a house in the town. She still hadn't grasp her mind on that until now. Now seeing her in new clothes was stabbing her eyes.Da Qiao knew Eldest Aunt was talking about her. So she walked over and said softly: \"Eldest Aunt, Grandmother and Grandfather had said that my schoolbag will be used for a good few years. It will not be a new schoolbag next year.\"What she meant was that her elder cousin brother's schoolbag was also a new schoolbag three years ago and her schoolbag will be used for at least three years. It will not be a new schoolbag by then.Wan Chun Ju glared at her: \"You talk too much. I wasn't talking to you. Get out of the way. Don't block me from doing housework!\"Chen Qiao Qiao went to the provincial city with her man. Most of the housework fell on her shoulder. The more she thought about it, the more angry she became.When she came to the stove, she threw the large spoon into the pot with force. The hot water in the pot splashed out and fell on her face. It caused her to jump and scream in pain, \"Ouch...\"The few children who just walked out of Qiao's old house heard it and didn't take it seriously.An Ping even laughed and said, \"Mom is performing the slaughtering pig act again!\"Qiao Dong Ying shrugged: \"Just don't know what the reason for this this time?\"Of the children, only Qiao Dong He showed a hint of worry in her eyes.At this moment, the family had either went to school or went to the field. Wan Chun Ju cried for a while, but no one came to ask her what was wrong.Infuriating!Qiao Xiu Zhi walked with the children for an hour to the community primary school.There weren't any primary school in the many nearby production teams. So there were still many people who came to register today.When everyone saw Da Qiao, they couldn't help but look at her. Mainly because she was so fair that she seemed to glow.During this period, most people were dressed in gray. Some people's clothes were even patched. Only she had new clothes, shoes, and schoolbags. It was really eye-catching!Simply enviable. They also want new clothes, new shoes and new schoolbags...After registration, the children went to their own classes.Qiao Dong He took Da Qiao's hand and spoke, \"I'm in the fifth grade, class four. If you have any problem, you can go there to find me. Don't casually walk around after school. Wait for us at the entrance and we'll go back together, understand?\"Da Qiao nodded obediently: \"I know, I won't wander around.\"Qiao Dong Ying acted like a cool elder sister. She put her hand on Da Qiao's shoulder and stated: \"If someone dares to bully you, you should report my name, Elder Sister Ying. It'll ensure that no one dares to do anything to you. Got it?\"Da Qiao nodded again, \"Got it, Elder Sister Ying!\"An Ping saw that both elder sisters had spoken and felt not speaking won't do. He rubbed his head and uttered, \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, if someone asks you if you are my younger cousin sister, you must say no!\"Da Qiao was stunned: \"Why say no?\"\"Because if you said yes, everyone will think you are part of the\u00a0egg-egg\u00a0clan like me! Hahaha...\"Eight of the ten times, An Ping's exams were double-zero. He were called\u00a0egg-egg\u00a0clan along with several other slackers.Qiao Dong Ying swiped him with her paw: \"Instead of feeling ashamed, you're actually proud, right? Younger Sister Da Qiao, don't imitate him!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi took in the children's unity and friendliness. So she left with confidence.When she walked to the school gate, she happened to bump into Fang Family who also came to register. Behind them, was Xiao Qiao with a haggard face.When enemies meet, their eyes particularly red!When Fang Family saw Qiao Xiu Zhi, they all remembered the matter of being smeared with chicken poo. They gritted their teeth with hatred. However, they didn't dare to go up.Not only did they not dare to fight, they were also afraid that Qiao Xiu Zhi would suddenly beat them up. Instantly, they slipped away as if a ghost was chasing them!When Xiao Qiao saw her grandmother, surprise flashed in her eyes.In the past, when the school started, Qiao's children came to register by themselves. Her grandmother never accompanied them here. Why did she come this time?She frowned and suddenly had a bad feeling in her heart.It couldn't be that...Soon, her hunch was confirmed.During recess, she a group of children surrounding a little girl on her way back from going to the toilet. As if the stars clustering around the moon.She didn't pay heed until she heard someone say, \"Da Qiao, your schoolbag is so beautiful. Where did you buy it?\"Da Qiao?Xiao Qiao's heart dropped and she turned her head to look...She saw Da Qiao was wearing new clothes, with two braids on her head, and a small pear-shaped velvet flower on each tail of the braids. Her face was fair and rosy. When she talked to everyone, the corners of her mouth carried a sweet smile.In the midst of a group of swarthy and sallow children, she was like a little princess. So blinding that it hurt the eyes.Xiao Qiao subconsciously looked down at her clothes.The clothes on her body were made last year. Counting the time, it wasn't so long ago. Before, Da Qiao picked up the clothes she didn't want to wear. While she got new clothes and shoes made every year before school started.But since leaving Qiao's house, she had never worn new clothes or shoes!To make matters worse, her grandma sent Fang You Liang and Fang You Rou to Wang Family. All the chores at home fell on her shoulders. She had been working every day from the moment she opened her eyes. Even until it was dark at night, it was never-ending!Her hands were originally fair, tender and smooth. But now, calluses can be seen.The more she thought about it, the more her heart pained and the more unwilling to admit defeat she became!She had transmigrated into a novel and reborn. She was clearly the heroine of luck!The person who enjoy the happiness should be her. Now the moon who was surrounded by the stars should also be her. Not Da Qiao!She clenched her fists and glared at Da Qiao fiercely. An evil thought welled up in her heart.If only one heroine can survive in the book, that person can only be her.It had to be her!...Qiao Zhen Min took his wife and daughter to the town for one night. The next day, they took a bus from the town to the county. Then they prepared to take a train from the county to the provincial capital.It was too inconvenient to travel during this age. In just two days, Chen Qiao Qiao and little Wan'er already had tiredness on their faces.Especially Chen Qiao Qiao. She was originally slender. After running around for two days in a row, she felt that she might collapse at any moment.The train was late. They had been waiting at the train station for more than half an hour. They didn't know when the train would come. The people waiting for the train were complaining.\"Tired? Do you want to find a place to sit for a while?\" Qiao Zhen Min looked back at his pale-faced wife and asked with a slight pained heart.Chen Qiao Qiao shook her head and replied, \"No need. Maybe the train will arrive soon.\"There were too many people in the station. If they go too far, it was very likely that they won't be able to get on the train. So no one dared to go far.Suddenly, little Wan'er, who was in Qiao Zhen Min's arms, burst into tears.\"Little Wan'er, what's the matter? Are you hungry?\" Qiao Zhen Min lowered his head and coaxed.Little Wan'er stared at the man who was eating wontons across from them. Her eyes were red from crying, but she didn't speak.Qiao Zhen Min followed her gaze and understood in his heart.He glanced in the direction where the train should be coming from. There was still no sign of the train's arrival. So he instructed Chen Qiao Qiao: \"Watch at the child and things. I'll go buy two bowls of wontons and come back soon.\"Chen Qiao Qiao took the child from him and said nervously, \"Then hurry up.\"Qiao Zhen Min nodded: \"Don't worry. I'll be back soon!\"After he finished speaking, he turned and bolted away. After running several meters away, he could still hear his daughter's cry.At that moment, he didn't know if it was parent-child connection or what, he suddenly stopped and turned to look at his daughter.His daughter's palm-sized face was filled with tears, crying pitifully in her mom's arms. His heart softened and the wind sprung under his feet.After Qiao Zhen Min left, Chen Qiao Qiao's heart kept beating like drums.She had one hundred and fifty yuan on her. So much money. Her man would need save for a year without eating or drinking to reach this sum!And now that so much money was on her, she felt everyone was a thief. She feared that someone will come and steal her money!When they went out this time, Qiao Xiu Zhi gave them 500 yuan. It shouldn't cost that much to see a doctor. Well, it was always better for a poor family to strap up with money on the road.Because Qiao Zhen Min was afraid of mishaps, he divided the money into two parts. The majority was on his own body. The lesser with his wife. This way, if something happened to one of them, the whole army won't be wiped out.Chen Qiao Qiao placed 150 yuan in two places. 100 yuan was sewn into the clothes and 50 yuan was put in the bag. This way, it was more convenient to use.She was currently holding her daughter in one hand and holding the bag tightly in the other as she stared vigilantly at every passerby passing by her.When one looked at everyone like a thief, they will also look like a thief in others' eyes. Chen Qiao Qiao's behavior soon caught the eyes of people with bad thoughts.Soon, a person rushed over and bumped into her.Chen Qiao Qiao lost stability and fell to the ground. Little Wan'er was dropped to the ground. She burst into thunderous tears. Chen Qiao Qiao's bag also fell to the ground and was kicked far away by some unknown person.\"My bag!\" Chen Qiao Qiao became anxious. When she stood up, she wanted to grab the bag. However, before she could stand up, the bag was snatched away by a young man!She was stunned for a moment before screaming: \"Thief! Robbery! Everyone, stop him!\"Chen Qiao Qiao got up and chased after him. Completely forgetting her daughter who was crying loudly behind her.Some people noticed that a little girl was crying so badly. They went over to pick her up and help her clean the dust off her body.Just then, there was the roar of a train from a short distance away.Everyone's eyes lit up. The train finally came!The people waiting for the train immediately carried their baggage and rushed up. Little Wan'er was caught in the crowd. Like a pinball, she was bumped around by people. In the end, she pushed into the train.Once Chen Qiao Qiao got back her bag with the help of passers-by and handed the thief to the staff, she remembered that her daughter was alone at the platform. Immediately, she ran back.However, when she got back, almost all the people on the platform were gone. And her daughter was gone!Her legs went weak and she fell to the ground!Qiao Zhen Min was halfway back from buying wontons when he heard the roar of the train in the distance. Internally, he lamented. They missed this ride. Who knows how long the next one will be.But thinking that his daughter would soon be able to eat her desired wontons, the corners of his mouth raised again.Before reaching the platform, he heard a woman's heart-wrenching cry.It was his wife's voice!His heart trembled. He threw the wonton in his hand and ran over. The scene of his wife sitting on the ground entered his eyes. She was crying so hard that she almost fainted. However, there was no trace of their daughter by her side!His face turned pale. He walked over and grabbed Chen Qiao Qiao's shoulder, and sharply questioned, \"Where's little Wan'er? Where is little Wan'er?\"When Chen Qiao Qiao saw her man come back, she immediately found her backbone. At the same time, her heart trembled even more: \"I don't know, my bag was... robbed. I chased after him. Once I got back... Little Wan'er, little Wan'er, she's gone!\"Gone!Hearing this word, Qiao Zhen Min clenched his hands tightly. So hard that he almost crushed Chen Qiao Qiao's shoulders!\"Is the bag more important, or is little Wan'er more important? How can you feel assured leaving her there alone?\"Qiao Zhen Min was so angry that the veins on his neck and forehead were bulging. His gaze was daggered.He stood up, saw how many people were looking at them, and immediately ran over to ask them, \"Hello, my daughter has been lost. Did you see a four-year-old girl just now? About this tall?\"Those few people shook their heads: \"Didn't see her. We just got here.\"Someone spoke: \"Could it be that someone carried her away?\"Some people added: \"Maybe someone took her onto the train? Oh, you better tell your wife to stop crying and quickly go to the station staff for help. If they can't do anything, hurry up and call the police!\"\"That's right. Stop crying. Hurry up and call the police!\"Qiao Zhen Min regretted it to death!He shouldn't leave. Even if he wants to leave, he should hold little Wan'er!It was useless to say anything now. Better quickly call the police!Qiao Zhen Min was impatient and ran towards the waiting room. The staff heard that a child was missing. They eagerly helped them by asking the passers-by. But no one saw her.The train had already gone far away. It was impossible to stop the train and they weren't necessarily sure that the child was in the train.Staff advised them to go to the police immediately.Qiao Zhenmin's heart sank deeper and deeper. It endlessly sank down.Inside the train compartment, little Wan'er was pulled in by the crowd. She looked up at the people around her. She knew none of them.Her mouth was tightened into a line before she cried again with a \"WAA\".Just now, everyone was looking for a seat. It was only now did they notice a child standing in the middle of the corridor. Someone spoke out, \"Whose child is this?\"\"Whose child has been lost? Come out and take the child back!\"\"What kind parents are her parents? Don't even know that the child is gone. Oh, my heart hurts to see the little face crying pitifully.\"After shouting for a long time, no one came out to claim her. Just when everyone was about to call the train attendants over, a woman in floral clothes rushed over.She seem to be in her forties. She carried little Wan'er and said anxiously, \"Ah, Niu Niu, why did you come here? You really scared grandma to death!\"After speaking, she smilingly apologized to everyone in an unpretentious manner: \"I'm really sorry for everyone. I was in a hurry to find a seat just now. I didn't watch this child and she ran here in a blink of an eye. I disturbed everyone. I'm really sorry!\"Seeing that the little girl did not resist, everyone thought that this woman was really her grandma.So everyone responded, \"It's okay. It's okay. Hurry up and take her back. Look how terrified the child is.\"\"Okay, I'll take her back now.\" The woman turned around with little Wan'er in her arms and quickly walked to the carriage at the other end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWang Shui Sheng drove the village's old horse carriage with Qiao Zhen Guo and the female doctor on to the town.He spoke to Qiao Zhen Guo, \"There are so many educated youths coming over every year. The production team nearly can't fit them all in.\"Qiao Zhen Guo was befuddled: \"If you can't fit them in, then send them back. What's so difficult about this?\"Wang Shui Sheng: \"...\"It seem that the atmosphere was a bit more awkward to not speak.Wang Shui Sheng persisted: \"Oh, Fang Family is constantly making trouble every day. If every household is like them, who would dare to be the production leader?\"Qiao Zhen Guo emotionally nodded: \"Fortunately, our Qiao Family has nothing to do with them. Oh, I almost forgot that they are connected to your Wang Family now. Why can't your Wang Family think it through?\"Wang Shui Sheng: \"...\"Sometimes, the sky was chatted to death like this!Wang Shui Sheng closed his mouth, expressing that he didn't want to speak any more.The female doctor who came with them heard this. Her lips slanted. She was very glad that she didn't speak.Wang Shui Sheng was really worried in his heart. So many educated youths come down every year, and only a handful of them go back!Some of these educated youths are slow-witted, while some were sick children. They ask for leave every three days. Few were really able to do farm work!Reject having them can't do. This was above's assigned target. Really head-wrecking!After more than an hour of bumpy ride, the carriage finally came to the gate of the town's station.Because the educated youths were all arranged to arrive at the same time, it wasn't just their production team. Other production teams and communities had already arrived one after another.This face-to-face confrontation immediately distinguishes the rich and the poor.Some production teams drove tractors to pick up people, which was convenient and cool. It also garnish face.Some use horse-drawn carriages to pick up people like Qili Village. Although the tools were a bit retro, they can still travel fast.The poorer production teams can only use ox carts or mule carts. The poorest production team can't even get a mule cart. So they picked up the educated youth empty-handed!The educated youths hoped that they could be assigned to production teams with tractors.The better the production equipment, the richer it was. No one wanted to go to the production team that can only walk on two legs!But there were\u00a0more monks and less gruel\u00a0. How can they all be assigned to the production team with tractors.Soon a person-in-charge came over and began to allocate educated youth:\"Su Xing Sheng, Li Meng Meng... Cui Xiang. The seven of you follow the Hongtaiyang production team's leader.\"\"Ye Sheng...\"After reading for a long time, it was finally Qili Village's turn.\"Li Cai Liang, Wang Qing Shan, Cai Wei Guo... Ye Zhen Zhen, Da Zhi, the eight of you go to Qili production team's side!\"This time, Qili Village was assigned a total of eight educated youths. Four male and four female.Wang Shui Sheng frowned even more when he saw that half of them were female.It wasn't that he looked down on feamle. It was that farm work required strength. These kids from the city wouldn't be able to do farm work in the first place. Let alone the girls, who are arrogant and squeamish!Wang Shui Sheng handed the list to Qiao Zhen Guo, who was on the side, and walked over to lead the educated youth over.Qiao Zhen Guo took a look at the list and muttered, \"There are still people called\u00a0Blacksmith\u00a0. Such a strange name, hahaha...\"Hearing the laughter, the female doctor turned her head and glanced at it. She only saw the word \"Da Zhi\u00a0\" written on it. The corner of her mouth twitched. She silently lit a candle for the girl in her heart.Ye Zhen Zhen and Da Zhi were two female educated youths from the same place. They were classmates, so they did everything together.At this moment, the two of them were walking at the back. Their mouths droop and their faces expressed unhappiness.Ye Zhen Zhen eyed at the tractor over at that side and spoke with slanted lips, \"Why do you think we are so unlucky? It would be great if we could be assigned to that production team?\"Before she went to the countryside, she inquired around. Although they were all rural areas, the difference between rural areas and rural areas was also very big.Some villages were richer than some counties and towns because of their good geographical location. Some villages were located in the mountains and corners. Not only were they very poor, but also very difficult to travel to a market.When she came here, she was particularly afraid of being assigned to those poor production teams.But her family was an ordinary family. On top of that she was a girl. Her family wasn't willing to find connections for her. Everything can only be left to fate.Da Zhi's family was similar to Ye Zhen Zhen's. Both family didn't put in effort and they can only resign themselves to fate.She glanced to both sides, and suddenly lowered her voice: \"I wonder know when we can go back to the city. Have you ever thought about finding one in the countryside?\"Ye Zhen Zhen's expression said 'you're crazy': \"Why do you have such a thought? Country people are old-fashioned and stupid. It can't be that you're thinking of marrying a country man?\"The corner of Da Zhi's mouth twitched. She stretched out her hand to tuck the hair on her temples behind her ears and replied, \"Of course not. How could I be so dumb! However, you don't want your watery hands to become rough, right?\"Ye Zhen Zhen knew that Da Zhi had always had many tricks. So she leaned over to hold her hand and asked, \"Do you have any plan? We are good friends. You must not hide it from me!\"Da Zhi leaned over and whispered in her ear.Ye Zhen Zhen frowned from time to time. Her eyes also brightened from time to time. Finally she spoke, \"This... I'm afraid it's not easy to handle, right?\"With a confident look on her face, Da Zhi curved her lips and merrily declared, \"Then just wait and see. I'll show you how!\"Ye Zhen Zhen was surprised. Her eyes widened and exclaimed, \"No way. You found your target so quickly? Could it be the production leader?\"Da Zhi hit her: \"Damnit, be quiet! Do you want everyone to hear?\"Ye Zhen Zhen lowered her voice again: \"Then tell me quickly. Which person did you chose?\"Da Zhi's eyes fell on the tall man with a simple and honest smile next to the carriage. Her lips pouted: \"There. That one!\"The production leader had a high status. In principle, he was definitely better. But as soon as the production leader opened his mouth, she vetoed him.Stubbornly strict, uncompromising and straightlaced. This kind of man was the most unlikely to mess around. It was too difficult to win this kind of man.But the man next to the carriage was different. From the simple and honest smile on his face, she knew that this kind of person had little knowledge and a good temper. Seeing that he was tall and big, she was sure that he won't find excuse when she get him to help her in the future.Ye Zhen Zhen followed her gaze and felt that Da Zhi was still the same as before. She liked good-looking men.Although the man beside the carriage was a little older, got slightly darker skin, and have an old-fashioned air, his facial features were still pretty good.At least he looked so many times better than the production leader who wore a straw hat and a frosty expression!When they came to the carriage, Wang Shui Sheng announced in a rough voice, \"Everyone get on the carriage. Men and women sit separately. Four on each side. Hurry up. It will take more than an hour to get back!\"In order to pick up these educated youth, who knows how much farm work was delayed!When everyone saw the simple carriage, their hearts got a little colder again. Now it was like this, so what if they were dissatisfied?Da Zhi was the fastest. She grabbed the seat next to Qiao Zhen Guo and sat down.Da Zhi turned her face slightly and smiled, \"This Elder Brother, can I sit here?\"Qiao Zhen Guo didn't answer.Thinking he didn't hear it, Da Zhi asked again and gently pulled his sleeve.This time, Qiao Zhen Guo heard it. He gave her a weird a look and responded, \"You've already sat down and you're asking me if you can sit? What's the difference between doing that and taking off your pants to fart?\"Da Zhi: \"...\"The female doctor sitting opposite almost couldn't hold back the laughter!She turned her face to the side and shook violently.Da Zhi lost face. She bit her lip lightly and resented that this country bumpkin was too ignorant!However, Ye Zhen Zhen's two eyes were fixed on her. Thinking of her ocean wide boast she had just spouted, she didn't want to admit defeat.Wang Shui Sheng saw that everyone had got onto the carriage, he also got on. With a holler, he drove the carriage back to the village.Although they were dissatisfied with the broken carriage and that it wasn't a tractor, they were young people after all. They quickly introduced themselves to each other.Da Zhi was the most beautiful among the four female educated youths. She spoke softly. The eyes of the four male educated youths fell on her at once.It was a pity that Da Zhi didn't give them a gaze.Of course, it didn't mean that she fell in love with Qiao Zhen Guo.She just wanted to find a strong man in the production team and coax him to work for her.At most, she will let the other party #receive some benefit. As long as she remained a virgin, it will not be difficult for her to return to the city and remarry in the future.She had met an elder sister in the same yard as her family. After two years of going to the countryside, she had completely changed. She was dark and old-fashioned. Her skin was too rough. She had heard that it was because of too much farm work.So she pondered about it before she went to the countryside this time. The tall man beside her was the first target she chose.Halfway through the carriage-ride, a wild dog suddenly jumped out from the grass. It startled the horse and the carriage swayed.Here was her chance!God was helping her!Da Zhi slanted her body. And as she screamed, she fall toward Qiao Zhen Guo.Qiao Zhen Guo was caught off guard. There was a woman in his arms. Big eyes looked at small eyes.Of course, Da Zhi didn't keep leaning on him. She sat upright soon and showed him a sweet and shy smile: \"Elder Brother Qiao, thank you so much. If it weren't for you, I would definitely fall!\"From the conversation between him and the production leader just now, she already knew that his surname was Qiao and first name was Zhen Guo.Qiao Zhen Guo turned back around with an \"oh\" and said to Wang Shui Sheng, \"It turns out that pretty girls have boogers too. She fell down just now and I saw her boogers at a glance. There are quite a few!\"Everyone: \"...\"Da Zhi: \"...\"Just now, the educated youth had some favorable impressions of Da Zhi just because of her appearance. Now, that impression instantly collapsed in their heart.Da Zhi's face went red and white. She almost broke her teeth from clenching in hatred!...In the provincial railway station.A couple walked out of a green leather train. The woman was dressed in floral clothes, while the man was dressed in gray clothes. Their face was quite weathered.After leaving the train station, the old man Hua complained: \"The family is already too poor to open the stove. Why did you pick up a lass?\"Old woman Hua had a 'you're stupid' expression on her face: \"Who do you think I'm doing this for? Isn't it for our son? Our family is so poor. And our son is an idiot. Which family do you think would be willing to give up their daughter and marry into our family?\"Realization dawned on old man Hua: \"So... you want to raise this girly as a child bride?\"Old woman Hua nodded: \"Of course, how much can a girl eat? It just happened that we are busy. She can help with the housework. Once she is old enough, she will directly be our son's wife, and give birth to a few grandchildren in the future. Our Hua Family will have a future!\"Old man Hua thought this idea was a good idea and looked at his wife with admiration, \"You thought it through. Then we can go back after we buy something. Son must be waiting for us!\"The two of them walked towards the supply and demand cooperative. One was holding the child and the other was carrying the sack.Not long after they left, a man and a woman came out from the alley.The two looked at each other. The man followed, while the woman ran towards the police station.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unexpectedly, he was discovered!Old woman Hua looked back and said to Old Man Hua, \"That person has been following us. It is very likely that he heard what we said just now!\"The old man also secretly glanced back. His face turned pale with fright: \"Then will he go to the police?\"A tinge of fierce appeared in old woman Hua's triangle eyes, \"I'm afraid he has already got someone to call the police. If we are caught, our son will definitely starve to death! Now that it's up to you. You have to go out and block him, while I go first. Can you handle it?\"Source:https://twitter.com/zeldacw/status/1367636105189715968?s=20Old man Hua felt that he couldn't.But he listened to his wife's words all his life. What's more, he didn't want Hua Family to come to an end. So he decisively said: \"Okay, I'll block him!\"Old man Hua turned around and rushed toward Huang Xue Wen. Old woman Hua accelerated and ran.Huang Xue Wen never thought that the other party would dare to run back. Unprepared, his waist was grasped.When he saw the figure of the woman running away, he secretly thought 'oh no!'He struggled hard, but the other party used dead stubbornness. Like a bull, he hugged him tight!Seeing that the woman was about to disappear from sight soon, Huang Xue Wen burst into sweat. He latched on the old man's shoulder and shook it hard...The old man was thrown out and rolled on the ground. He howled out in pain.Huang Xue Wen saw at a glance that he was pretending. He didn't think much and swung his leg with all his might to run after the woman.Who would have thought that halfway through the run, he suddenly heard the screams of passers-by behind him: \"Ahhh...Someone died! Someone died\"\"It's the man in front. The one in black. Grab him quickly, don't let him run away!\"When Huang Xue Wen heard someone died, he immediately stopped and turned around. Then passers-by looking at him with fearful eyes entered his sight.Soon, a few grown men rushed up to locked his hands: \"Quick! Catch and bring him to the police station!\"When Dong Jing brought the police over, she saw this scene. Her husband was pinned to the ground by a few men with his arms twisted. Not far from him, laid a man with foam at the mouth and incontinent urinating. The old man was no longer breathing.Her heart thumped. She felt the world spinning for a while.Afterwards, the two of them were taken back to the police station together. Several passersby testified that the old man died after being thrown to the ground by Huang Xue Wen.Huang Xue Wen: \"He was fine when I left. Not to mention that this person is a trafficker. My wife can testify!\"A policeman said: \"You say he is a trafficker, so he is a trafficker? Where is the evidence? Where is the kidnapped child?\"\"The child was taken away by his wife!\"The policeman chuckled: \"In other words, you have no evidence at all! If I beat you to death now and say that you are a culprit, are you a culprit?\"Huang Xue Wen was speechless and gritted his teeth in anger!Finally, the forensic doctor came. After the examination, it was confirmed that the old man died of epilepsy. However, in forensic science, emotional agitation was one of the causes of epilepsy.In other words, this old man's death was connected with Huang Xue Wen.The police station issued an order to temporarily detain Huang Xue Wen and wait for the next review.Huang Xue Wen and Dong Jing suddenly felt that the sky was falling apart!They just wanted to do a good deed and save people. They never expect saving to result themselves in prison!If a good person wasn't rewarded, no matter who, they will feel comfortable!Dong Jing grasped her husband's hand and sobbed: \"Wait. I'll find someone to save you!\"...Old woman Hua rampantly ran on the road with little Wan'er in her arms. She especially entered the alleys and ran to the bottom of a bridge. She bent down and hid in it.Little Wan'er stared out with her eyes in her arms. Her face was pale. Her lips were flat with the desire to cry.Old woman Hua glared at her. She pinched her face hard and declared: \"Don't cry, or I'll kill you!\"Little Wan'er trembled. Tears fell. It was a silent cry.She wanted to go home. She wanted her dad.Old woman Hua saw that she was only tearing up, so she ignored her. She hugged her and hid under the bridge until it was dark. Only then, she slowly crawled out from under the bridge.She carried little Wan'er and walked to Shannan Village step by step.Shannan Village was the kind of village that Ye Zhen Zhen described as a village located in a mountain valley. The land was barren and the population was sparse. And it was far away from the town. Very inconvenient as it took half a day travel.By the time old woman Hua walked back to Shannan Village, the sky was already getting brighter.She pushed open the courtyard door and walked in. Her silly son was sleeping on the kang with a pool of saliva drooling from the corner of his mouth. The house was messy and smelly. She was used to it though.She threw little Wan'er beside her son and went back to sleep by herself.She slept until noon and was woken up by little Wan'er's cry.\"Hehe, Younger Sister, Younger Sister! Younger Sister, eat. Eat!\" Silly Geng clapped his hands happily, while stuffing a blackened pancake into little Wan'er's mouth.The pancake was cold and hard. It was unknow how many days it had been left out. Silly Geng didn't know how to control his strength. He shoved the pancake into little Wan'er's mouth so hard that her lips bleed.Little Wan'er screamed and refused. However, she was so small. How could she dodge?Old woman Hua scratched her hair and walked in with a scold, \"You damn bastard. You cry when you have something to eat! What is there to cry? Mourning? Silly Geng, don't worry about her. Just eat it yourself!\"No matter how weak an animal was, they got an instinctive fear of danger.Seeing old woman Hua, little Wan'er's crying abruptly stopped. Her little body shrank in the corner and trembled.Someone heard the movement and came over and asked old woman Hua, \"Why did I hear the cry of a little girl just now?\"Old woman Hua smiled proudly: \"There was a relative who gave birth to too many girls and couldn't afford to raise. So they gave her to us. When she grow up, it just happened that she can be our Silly Geng's wife!\"This kind of thing was normal, so everyone didn't find it strange when they heard it. Still, some people asked why old man Hua didn't come back.Old woman Hua panicked and said that he would come back later. However, her heart kept beating like drums.Two or three days passed like this and old man Hua still didn't come back. Old woman panicked.She baked a few pancake for herself and her son. Then she carried two biscuits to the provincial capital to inquire. The result of the inquiries was... old man Hua was dead!Old woman Hua was filled with hatred and sorrow. She hid under the bridge and cried for a long time before she wiped her snot and tears. Then she walked back to the village.By the time she got home, it was already midnight.She kicked open her son's door, picked up little Wan'er who was covered by a quilt on the side and slammed her violently!Little Wan'er was dozing off when her body exploded with an sudden pain. She cried and struggled. However, she couldn't move at all.Her voice was buried in the quilt. And the nearest home to Hua's house was more than 20 meters away. So no one knew that a little girl was beaten to half death that night....Qiao's old house.Qiao Xiu Zhi tossed and turned on the bed.Xue Chuan said, \"What happened to you today? Is there something on your mind?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi sighed and replied, \"Old Fifth has been gone for a month, but he hasn't called back. I feel very uneasy. I kept feeling that something is going to happen.\"Xue Chuan comforted: \"It won't. Heaven naturally helps a good man. They will come back safely.\"However, Qiao Xiu Zhi frowned deeper: \"I didn't tell you before that on the day old Fifth went out, Da Qiao pulled her Fifth Uncle's hand and urged them not to leave. I thought about Da Qiao's strangeness then and persuaded old Fifth to change the time. But\u2026\u201d\"But old Fifth didn't listen to persuasion, right?\" Xue Chuan helped her finish.Of their five children, Eldest was the most naive and listens to them parents the most. Second was indecisive, but still could be persuaded.It just happened, the three children below were more stubborn than the other.When little Yi Ming was pushed into the river for the first time, as parents, they suggested to her to divorce. However, her heart softened and forgave Zhao Jie Fang.Not to mention Qiao Hong Mei. She decided on her own marriage. Currently, her mindset treated Qiao Family as an enemy.As for Qiao Zhen Min, he was the smartest and most capable of his siblings since he was a child. But often capable people were also the most arrogant and complacent.Qiao Xiu Zhi sighed and said, \"The phrase 'raise a child for a hundred years, ninety-nine of them are worry' is true. If there is a next life, let's only have one child. If there are too many children, we can't worry enough!\"Xue Chuan laughed: \"Okay, if there is a next life, we will only have one. Whether it is a girl or a boy, one is enough.\"However, Qiao Xiu Zhi said, \"It's better to have a girl. As delicate and soft as Da Qiao.\"Xue Chuan's smile became more gentle. There was doting in his eyes: \"Da Qiao's child is indeed very likable.\"The first time Da Qiao went to school, she skipped a grade and became a transfer student. She was worried that she would not be able to keep up with everyone, or that she would not be used to it.Unexpectedly, within two days, she became blended with everyone. Now she had become a favorite of teachers and classmates.Every time she came back from school, she would chat to them about school. Her little face was flushed and filled of joy.After talking with her husband, Qiao Xiu Zhi felt a little better. After tossing and turning a few times, she finally fell asleep.The next day was Sunday. No need to go to class. Da Qiao came to Qiao's old house bright and early.As soon as Wan Chun Ju saw Da Qiao, she felt uncomfortable and pouted, \"Why are you here again?\"Da Qiao spoke in a soft voice: \"Eldest Aunt, I came to see my grandfather and grandmother. This is my grandfather and grandma's house. I have the right to come here. If you are like this again, I will tell my grandfather and grandmother!\"Wan Chun Ju was so angry that she stomped: \"You bratty child. You dare to threaten me, see how I'll...\"She spewed out until her mother-in-law's figure walked over from the room. She immediately swallowed the latter words: \"Oh, Da Qiao, why are you so cute? Eldest Aunt will give you candy later. Right now, Eldest Aunt is going to do housework. Go there and play.\"After saying that, she turned around and ran away.However, when she ran halfway, one of her foot stepped on a piece of chicken poo and she slipped. She almost fell on her butt!Why was it almost? That was because in a desperate situation, she hugged the pillar next to her with one hand, so she didn't fall.Soon the sound of her pig slaughter cry rang out from Qiao's old house: \"Ouch...Ouch, Zhen Guo, come and help me. My hand got a splinter. It hurts me to death!\"It was unknown when a splinter appeared on the pillar. When she hugged the pillar, the splinter directly plunged into her palm. The pain made her cry!Qiao Zhen Guo came out and saw his wife's face. He burst into laughter, \"Wife, the three blister marks on your face are so funny. I want to laugh every time I see it!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Before, she was splashed with hot water on her face and three burn mark appeared on her face. It hurt like hell!What was even more irritating was that after the three blisters were healed, three very obvious blisters were left behind.The positions of the three were very symmetrical. They all appear on the face, as if...\"It's like the Three Kingdoms are at odds.\" Qiao Zhen Guo added.Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"She was so furious that she almost vomited blood: \"You can't get over this hurdle, right? How long will you laugh before you drop it?\"Qiao Zhen Guo: \"When the blister mark is gone, I won't laugh anymore.\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"According to what he said, it seem this hurdle will not be over in this life!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The needles in her hands were too disobedient. She can't always embroider the way she desire.She really envied her grandfather!Her grandfather's hands were slender and good-looking. Unlike other old people's hands. They all have age spots. And the dark skin was wrinkled. Not good-looking at all!More importantly, her grandfather's hands were very dexterous!After getting his hand on the needle and threading it, he would embroidered a flower in an instant. Then an old hen. They looked remarkably true to life and pretty!Elder Cousin Sister Dong He was also good at it. While herself, her grandfather said that her bum have long needles. Before reaching an hour, she was already twisting around. Not as patient as Elder Cousin Sister Dong He.Oh, what an annoyance!However, her grandmother said that everyone had their own shining points. Her shining point was being cute. What's more, her color matching was very good!Her grandfather said that she was naturally sensitive to colors. If there was a chance in the future, she will be taught on drawing.She thought it was a great idea. She can draw the things she liked!\"Younger Sister Da Qiao, you came? Quickly come in.\" Qiao Dong He happily responded when she heard Da Qiao's voice.\"Coming! Coming! Big Cutie will come in right away!\"\"Pfft...\"Qiao Dong He covered her mouth and chuckled. She felt Younger Sister Da Qiao was too cute!Qiao Dong He wonder if she will feel embarrassed when she grows up and recall how thick skinned she was?After learning embroidery in the morning, Da Qiao stayed at the old house for lunch at noon. Then she joined her two elder cousin sisters on a nap after eating.Half an hour later, Da Qiao suddenly burst into tears while dreaming. This startled Qiao Dong He and Qiao Dong Ying, who was beside her.\"Younger Sister Da Qiao. Younger Sister Da Qiao, what's wrong?\" Qiao Dong He was a little overwhelmed.Qiao Dong Ying stopped her sister and said, \"Elder Sister, don't push her around. I'll call Grandfather and Grandmother over.\"After she finished speaking, she quickly got out of bed and ran towards her grandparent's room.Soon, Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan ran over.Da Qiao was still crying. Her little face was flushed red, while her eyes were tightly closed. Her long and dense eyelashes were wet. Pea-sized tears kept flowing out of her eyes.When Qiao Xiu Zhi saw this, she gotten a scare.She walked over, carried Da Qiao in her arms, and patted her face lightly as she spoke, \"Da Qiao, it's Grandmother. Quickly wake up...\"After calling a few times, Da Qiao woke up from the nightmare. She opened her eyes and saw her grandmother. She cried out with a \"waa\": \"Grandmother, I dreamed that little Sister Wan'er was taken away... Waa waa... I kept chasing and chasing, but I can't catch up with them...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi's heart thumped and kept sinking.The thing she had been most worried about had finally happened.After comforting Da Qiao, Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan returned to their room. Qiao Xiu Zhi stated, \"I want to go to the provincial capital to find old Fifth and his wife. I always feel that something has happened to them!\"Xue Chuan disagreed: \"There are so many people. Where are you going to find them? Besides, if you go and they just come back, wouldn't you miss each other?\"Qiao Xiuzhi thought for a while and spoke, \"What you said makes sense. I'll wait another half a month. If there is still no news from old Fifth, don't stop me then.\"Xue Chuan held her hand and said, \"Okay, I won't stop you. I will accompany you when the time comes!\"...Dong Jing had never suffered so much!Since her husband was locked up, she had been running around every day to find connections for her husband.She was really about to collapse. A few times she couldn't help crying while covering her face on the road.She regretted that she didn't stop her husband that day,. She even resented the fact that good people weren't rewarded for their good deed!It just happened her elder sister and elder brother-in-law both went on a business trip and couldn't be contacted for a while!She has thought of everything and found everyone she can find. She was really at a dead-end!She can't take it anymore!Just as Dong Jing burst into tears and became dizzy, there was an urgent knock on the door...\"Jing'er, Jing'er, open the door. It's Elder Sister!\"Elder Sister!Dong Jing's eyes went sour and tears flowed out again. She got up and stumbled to open the door. Seeing her elder sister standing outside the door, she threw herself at her and burst into tears again.Dong Xue hugged her sister and kept comforting her.It wasn't until half an hour later that Dong Jing calmed down. Only then did she realize that there was a little girl in her elder brother-in-law, Chu Tian Bai's arms.\"Whose child is this? Why is she with you and Elder Brother-in-law?\"Her elder sister and elder brother-in-law had a daughter before. Little niece died when she was three years old. Her elder sister and elder brother-in-law were so sad that they fainted a few times.Because her elder sister's health wasn't good, she hadn't gotten pregnant in the past few years. That was why Dong Jing was very curious when she saw her brother-in-law holding a little girl in his arms.Chu Tian Bai rubbed the little girl's fluffy hair lightly. His eyes full of doting: \"This is our daughter. Her name is Chu Wan. You can call her Wan Wan. Wan Wan, this is your maternal aunt. Say hello to Maternal Aunt, okay?\"The little girl leaned on his shoulder and hugged his neck tightly. She had heard it, but she didn't respond at all.Instead of blaming her, Chu Tian Bai smiled dotingly and caringly: \"This child had a bad life in the past. We rescued her from the traffickers.\"Although Dong Jing was very curious, she was currently concerned about her husband. So she quickly turned the topic to rescuing her husband.Chu Tian Bai was the deputy magistrate of Nan Ping County. He just got promoted last year. Although he was the deputy magistrate, this was the provincial city, so his words may not have much effect.Since this matter was related to the life and future of his younger brother-in-law, he will definitely not refuse: \"Don't worry. I'll go out and find a few people to see if someone can help.\"Dong Jing's eyes turned red again: \"Elder Brother-in-law, you must rescue Xue Wen. Otherwise I... I can't live anymore!\"Dong Xue hugged her younger sister again: \"Don't worry, your elder brother-in-law will definitely save Xue Wen. He didn't kill people. At most we will spend more money!\"Chu Tian Bai wanted to go out to find someone. So he had to pass the little girl in his arms to his wife.The little girl hugged his neck tightly and didn't let go. Her little body trembled uncontrollably.Seeing this, Dong Jing frowned and looked at her elder sister with growing curiousity.This little girl appeared a little abnormal. Even if my sister wants to adopt, she should adopt a lively and lovely child!Dong Xue walked over and teased the little girl tenderly: \"Wan Wan, it's Mom. Dad is going to do some work. Mom will carry you, alright?\"Anyway, after saying it seven or eight times, Dong Xue got her wish and hugged the little girl.Chu Tian Bai hurried out to find someone to mediate.After her elder brother-in-law left, Dong Jing brewed a cup of her favorite jasmine tea for her elder sister and a cup of malted milk for the little girl.Dong Xue hugged the little girl and used in a childish tone: \"Wan Wan, look at how much Maternal Aunt loves you. She poured you malted milk. Quickly thank Maternal Aunt.\"The little girl still didn't move. Her little face was blank.If someone from the Qiao family was here, they will discover that this little girl was none other than little Wan'er a.k.a Qiao Dong Wan.Dong Jing felt it was getting stranger: \"Elder Sister, how did you adopt this child?\"Dong Xue rubbed the child's hair and explained to her younger sister.It turned out that after old woman Hua knew that her husband died, she hated little Wan'er for causing her husband's death. At the same time, she was afraid that the police would investigate to her side.So after thinking about it again and again, she decided to sell little Wan'er!Old woman Hua's elder cousin sister was a human trafficker. So she quickly sold little Wan'er.Originally, when Cousin Sister Hua saw little Wan'er's fair skin and delicate features, she saw a big earning opportunity. However, she discovered that there was something wrong with this little girl after the transaction!She can cry, but not speak. No matter what one say, she ignore people. She suspects that there was something wrong with the little girl's brain. How can such a little girl sell for a high price?So she wanted to return the little girl. She wouldn't do a loss-making business. How could old woman Hua be willing?The two sisters got into a fight. In the end, old woman Hua returned half of the money and told her elder cousin sister to take the person away. The farther she sold, the better!Cousin Sister Hua felt she was unlucky. It just happened that another trafficker told her that there was a remote mountain village who wanted a little girl as a child bride. The other party\u2019s son wasn't a fool thought. Instead, a paralyzed one. In addition, the family was poor. They were afraid that he wouldn't be able to marry a wife in the future, so they thought of buying a little girl to be a child bride.Cousin Sister Hua immediately handed little Wan'er to the other party. However, little Wan'er, who had always been silent and well-behaved, struggled at this moment. She escaped from her hand and ran away.Cousin Sister Hua and that trafficker were both startled and immediately chased after her.Little Wan'er ran and bumped around. As soon as she ran out of the alley, she ran into Chu Tian Bai who was passing by.Chu Tian Bai was walking when a small object collided into him.He lowered his head and saw a messy little girl hugging his thigh tightly with a panicked look on her face.He was about to ask her in a quiet voice what happened, when he saw a man and a woman chasing her in the alley. He immediately realized something was wrong and subconsciously protected the little girl.Cousin Sister Hua didn't want the meat that was about to enter her mouth to fly. She explained that the little girl was her granddaughter and asked Chu Tian Bai to return her to her!Chu Tian Bai noted that her appearance didn't resemble the little girl at all. And the little girl was very afraid of the two of them. No matter what, he won't hand the little girl over.He immediately called passers-by to help call the police. Then he joined hands with passers-by to take down the two and send them to the police station together.At the police station, Cousin Sister Hua explained that this little girl was her nephew's daughter. Her nephew and nephew's wife died of illness a month ago. The little girl was temporarily put in her care. Since she couldn't raise her, she wanted to sell the little girl.After the police went to investigate, they found out that Cousin Sister Hua didn't lie. Her nephew and nephew's wife had indeed died a month ago. Their only daughter was indeed given to her to raise.What the police didn't know was that her nephew's daughter was sold by her half a month ago!Cousin Sister Hua lived in a house alone and had little contact with the neighbors. So no one seen what her nephew's daughter look like.When the police went over to investigate, they all said that it was a little girl around four or five years old. They only saw from afar, so they didn't know any other detail.The reason why Cousin Sister Hua didn't pull old woman Hua in was because she wanted old woman Hua to take care of her grandson for her when she went to prison. Her son and daughter-in-law died a few years ago. Leaving only a seven-year-old grandson in the family.The case was solved quickly .Cousin Sister Hua was sentenced to 20 years in prison, while the trafficker was sentenced to be shot.Little Wan'er became an orphan because of \"the premature death of her parents\" and was sent to the orphanage. At this time, Chu Tian Bai stepped forward to request to adopt little Wan'er.The orphanage had a heavy burden. If possible, the fewer people the better. Besides, this little girl had been reluctant to speak and she was afraid of seeing anyone except Chu Tian Bai. Now that someone adopt her, the police station and the welfare were naturally delighted.After listening, Dong Jing sighed: \"It is this child's blessing that she encounter you.\"Although Chu Tian Bai was only the deputy county magistrate of a small place, he got his own connections.With him taking action, Huang Xue Wen was released in less than three days.Dong Jing saw how much weight her husband had lost and hugged him with another round of sobbing!After settling her younger sister's affairs, Dong Xue and Chu Tian Bai returned to Nantian County with their daughter Chu Wan....This month was a torture for Qiao Zhen Min.Every day he opened his eyes, he wished he had never been to the county city!He called the police on the same day. But there was an ocean of people. How could it be easy to find someone?In addition, his wife had fallen ill again. He had to take care of his wife alone as well as cooperating with the police on the search. Within a few days, he was so thin that he lost his shape.Seeing that he was so anxious, the police at the police station helped him contact the police station in the provincial city, but there was no news.Later, his wife got a little better. He went to the provincial city to search in person.He had asked someone to paint a picture of little Wan'er. Every day he took the picture of little Wan'er and asked people at the train station. The result was that he ended being driven away by the train station's management as soon as they saw him. Saying that he disturbed the law and order.The money was spent like water. And there was still no news about little Wan'er.\"Zhen Min, speak to me. Even just half a sentence.\" Chen Qiao Qiao pulled her man's sleeve. Her sunken cheeks were covered with tears, \"I know I was wrong. I really do. That day I shouldn't chase after the bag. I...\"At the end, she choked and trembled. Unable to utter a single word.Qiao Zhen Min's eyes were completely bloodshot. He pulled his wife's hand away and said, \"No. It's not your fault. It's my fault! I know you don't like little Wan'er and left her for you to look after. It's my, the dad's fault!\"After he finished speaking, he slapped himself hard twice!Chen Qiao Qiao swayed for a while. Her face was as white as a piece of paper. Her dry lips closed together: \"I don't, I don't dislike little Wan'er. I... just felt that she's not smart enough. But I don't dislike her. I didn't even think about losing her!\"She had liked smart people since she was a child. She first fell in love with Qiao Zhen Min, a country boy, because she liked his cleverness.That was why she liked Xiao Qiao very much and had mentioned to her man several times that it would be nice if little Wan'er could be as smart as Xiao Qiao.However, not was little Wan'er not smart, it was also a difficulty for her to even be a normal ordinary person.Even so, she had never abused little Wan'er like Fang Xiao Juan!Qiao Zhen Min gave her a sorrowful look: \"You didn't abuse her, but you never liked her. I often go out to drive. You spend the longest time with the child, but she never gets close to you, the mom. Have you thought why?\"Chen Qiao Qiao swayed again. Her lips were trembling. She couldn't refute a word.Qiao Zhen Min didn't say anything. He laid down on the bed and stated, \"Go to sleep. We'll go back to the village tomorrow.\"Another half month had passed, there was still no news from old Fifth.Qiao Xiu Zhi was going to ask for a letter of introduction from the production leader and then go to the provincial city with Xue Chuan to find them.At this moment, Qiao Zhen Min came back.Three people went out. Now, one person was missing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You don't need to work at the supply and demand cooperative today? Oh, what about your daughter? Why didn't you bring her back?\"\"Yeah, where's your little Wan'er? It can't be that you left her in the town?\"\"Nowadays, young people are unreliable, aren't they? Since the couple are back, why didn't they bring their daughter back together?\"No matter what the villagers said, neither Qiao Zhen Min nor Chen Qiao Qiao answered.The former had a dark face, while the latter had a pale face. Trembling as if she would fall down at any moment.Seeing the two of them like this, the villagers immediately felt like they were placing a warm face on a cold butt.Someone said, \"Isn't that just being a temporary transporter in a supply and demand cooperative? What's so great about being a temporary transporter? To look down on people like this. If he become a permanent staff, wouldn't he ascend to heaven?\"Someone else spoke: \"You probably think too much. Old Fifth isn't like that. From their bad expression, I think something may have happened!\"\"Aiya, now you said, it seem like it! Tsk tsk tsk. Sure enough, some people are born with bad luck. As long as they get involved with her, not one can escape from misfortune!\"Everyone knew who this person was talking about.Thinking about it, it seem to be the case. During this period of time, both Qiao Family and Fang Family had been unlucky!Fang Family had it worse. A daughter-in-law died. Now the daughter-in-law's maternal family's four elderly were still at the Fang's house with no intention to leave!Fang Family's mother and son suffered a broken leg and a twisted waist. So they could not work in the field. If this goes on, the family can only\u00a0drink the northwest wind\u00a0!Some people were curious about what happened to Qiao Zhen Min and his wife. So they followed them to Qiao's house.Qiao Zhen Guo was about to carry his Second Younger Brother over for lunch. When he pushed open the courtyard door and saw Qiao Zhen Min, he was surprised: \"Fifth Younger Brother, Fifth Younger Sister-in-law, you're back? Oh, where is little Wan'er? Why isn't she with you? \"Qiao Zhen Min put one hand on his eldest brother's shoulder and uttered in a hoarse voice, \"Eldest Brother, let's go in and talk about it.\"Although Qiao Zhen Guo was a little naive, it wasn't like he completely couldn't read face. So he nodded and said, \"Then you and Fifth Younger Sister-in-law go in first. I'll pick up Second Younger Brother.\"Qiao Zhen Min nodded. He didn't look at Chen Qiao Qiao, who was behind him, and walked straight in.\"Fifth Uncle, you're back! Did you bring back anything for us?\" An Ping rushed out first.In the past, when Qiao Zhen Min came home, he would always bring back some candy and biscuits for his nephews and nieces. This was why An Ping asked this question.Before Qiao Zhen Min could speak, Qiao Dong Ying rushed up and gave her younger brother a chestnut: \"Fifth Uncle just came back and you pestered him with this. Come over and do the homework. If not, don't think about eating tonight!\"This idiot. Can't he see that Fifth Uncle's face was very ugly?Qiao Zhen Min squeezed out a not so pretty smile and said, \"Fifth Uncle forgot to buy it this time. I'll remember to bring it to you next time.\"Qiao Dong Ying waved her hand: \"Fifth Uncle, it's okay. Don't worry about An Ping. He is just like a pig. Only remember to eat!\"As she said that, she pinched his ears and walked into the room. An Ping howled in pain.Wan Chun Ju walked out of the room with her arms on her back. She exploded on the spot when she saw this scene: \"Dong Ying, you damn child. Can a man's ear be casually twisted? Still, not letting go?\"Qiao Dong Ying grimaced at her mom: \"An Ping is only nine years old. His hair hasn't grown yet. What kind of man is he?\"This couldn't be endured!\"Elder Sister, don't underestimate people, okay? I'll grow some hair for you to see this year!\" An Ping patted his chest and anxiously declared.Wan Chun Ju was so angry that she jumped: \"...You two, shut up! Don't speak of any hair or not!\"That damn girl, Dong Ying. As a girl, she got a big mouth. She was misleading her younger brother to the bad path. Should really be beaten up!It was noisy outside. Qiao Xiu Zhi heard it even when she didn't want to.She walked out and swept her eyes everywhere. Little Wan'er was nowhere in sight. She solemnly spoke, \"Where's little Wan'er?\"She remembered what Da Qiao said and dreamed. She had a bad premonition in her heart.Qiao Zhen Min endured it for a month, and endured it during the journey. Finally, when he saw his mom, he couldn't bear it any longer: \"Mom, little Wan'er... she's lost!\"Da Qiao came out from behind her grandmother when she heard this. Thinking of the dream she had, tears fell down with a swish.Although little Sister Wan'er ignored people and never play or talk with anyone, she was very obedient and rarely cried. But now she had been taken away by the bad guys!Little Wan'er must be very scared and missed her parents very much. She was still so young. What if they can't find her in the future?The more she thought about it, the more sad she became. She wept quietly.This sound caught Qiao Zhen Min's attention.On the way back, he kept thinking, why did Da Qiao tell him not to leave that day. Why did his mom asked him to reschedule? Did they know something?He wildly bolted over, grabbed Da Qiao's two arms, and stated, \"Da Qiao, tell Fifth Uncle, why did you tell Fifth Uncle not to leave that day? Did you know something?\"Da Qiao was taken aback and replied with a pale face, \"Fifth Uncle, I don't know. I just don't want you to leave...\"That day, her fifth uncle's family was going to leave. She suddenly felt uncomfortable inside and subconsciously didn't want them to leave.But she couldn't say for sure why.\"No. Think about it again. You must know, otherwise why would you say that kind of...\" words for no reason.Before the word \"word\" could be said, he was picked up by his mom from behind.Qiao Zhen Min: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi carried him like a chicken and put him one meter away from Da Qiao: \"Old Fifth, what are you doing?\"\"Mom, you were there that day. The day I depart, Da Qiao suddenly told us not to leave and then you asked me to reschedule. It's all my fault. If only I had listened to you!\"As Qiao Zhen Min said that, he slapped himself again. Da Qiao, who was watching, was shocked and frightened.Afraid of scaring Da Qiao, Qiao Xiu Zhi beckoned Qiao Dong He to come and take her away.To everyone's surprise, halfway gone, Da Qiao ran back with a 'thump thump thump\". She patted Fifth Uncle's shoulder with her small hand: \"Fifth Uncle, don't be sad. It will get better!\"Qiao Zhen Min raised his head abruptly. He stared at Da Qiao with bloodshot eyes: \"Da Qiao, what you say is true? It... will get better?\"Da Qiao looked at her fifth uncle with big dark eyes. Fifth Uncle's face was full of anticipation, as if the dying person saw a glimmer of light. So she couldn't help but nod her head.She nodded under Fifth Uncle's hopeful gaze: \"It will get better!\"Actually, Da Qiao didn't have any weird feeling this time. The reason why she ran back was because she didn't want to see her fifth uncle so sad.She just comforted Fifth Uncle the way Auntie Hui comforted her before. Hoping that he would feel better.But obviously Qiao Zhen Min misunderstood. At the side, Qiao Xiu Zhi also misunderstood.After Da Qiao went out, Qiao Zhen Min hagardly looked at his mom and spoke, \"Mom, tell me honestly. Does Da Qiao have... something different?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't want to tell other people about it. Not even to Da Qiao's dad.But now, if she doesn't say it, old Fifth's spirit will definitely collapse!So she briefly told him what happened before: \"I didn't want to talk about this. After all, if it were to spread out, it would be bad for Da Qiao.\"\"Mom!\" Qiao Zhen Min cried out in despair, \"Why didn't you tell me that day. If you told me, I...\"\"You'll what?\" Qiao Xiu Zhi coldly stated, \"Can you swear that if I told you that day, you would change the time and not go?\"He wouldn't!Qiao Zhen Min subconsciously responded in his mind. Even if his mom told him the strange things that happened with Da Qiao that day, he wouldn't take it seriously.He won't change his decision because of this. What's more, he didn't believe in these gods and ghosts since he was a child.He grabbed his hair and showed a painful expression again: \"It's my fault. I should have listened to you!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi slapped the table. The table split in half with a bang: \"Qiao Zhen Min, listen to me!\"Qiao Zhen Min was so frightened that he almost fell to the ground: \"...\"\"This incident is an accident. Not your fault. Nor your wife's fault. If you want to blame someone, blame the trafficker!\" Qiao Xiu Zhi declared, \"I noticed that you didn't even give your wife half a glance since you entered the door. What's the matter? It can't be that you want to follow your Second Brother and Third Sister's footsteps and get divorced?\"Qiao Zhen Min: \"...\"Divorce had never crossed his mind. But at present he really can't face Chen Qiao Qiao!\"You and your wife are negligent in this matter. You know that there are many people in the train station and you still hand over so much money and your child to your wife. She is a woman who has never seen the world. How can she not be afraid or panic?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi wasn't satisfied with this daughter-in-law, Chen Qiao Qiao.But again, as long as she doesn't cross the principle and bottom line, she will never interfere with their marriage.\"I know you have a knot in your heart. How do you want to deal with it? Your dad and I will not interfere. But I have to tell you that people's life is very long. Everyone makes mistakes. Some mistakes can't be forgiven at all, while some mistakes, we must learn to forgive and learn to turn a blind eye. If not, you will not be able to walk with anyone for a lifetime!\"Qiao Zhen Min clenched his hands into fists. The blue veins on the back of his hands were exposed: \"Mom, if... Dad made such a mistake, would you forgive him?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi shook her head: \"Impossible!\"Qiao Zhen Min's expression said 'Mom, you're playing with me': \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi rolled her eyes at him: \"What are you thinking? I mean that your dad can't make such a mistake. You don't need to compare a perfect person like your dad with you. Can't be compared. The more you compare, the more inferior you will be. The more painful it is!\"Qiao Zhen Min was caught off guard by mouthful of dog food: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi said sternly: \"I will give you two days. You got to raise your spirit. Since the child is lost, then we will find her back. If she can't be found in a month, we will find her for a year. If she can't be found in a year, we will spend ten years of searching. As long as there is someone in our Qiao Family, we will find get to the bottom of it!\"\"Mom...\" Qiao Zhen Min's eyes were red like rabbits. He couldn't hold back his tears.Male didn't cry easily. It was just the hurt didn't reach the heart.During this period of time, his whole heart seemed to be hanging on the edge of a cliff. And there was never a moment of peace. At this moment, he calmed down after hearing his mom's words.If he can't find her in one day, he'll search for a year. He can't find her in a year, he'll search for her for ten years. As long as she is still alive, he will not give up!Qiao Xiu Zhi turned around and walked out. Leaving the space to him.After she came out, Chen Qiao Qiao was still standing in the yard. She didn't even change her standing posture. Her eyes were fixed on the door. In her eyes were anticipation, despair, and fear.Seeing her mother-in-law, Chen Qiao Qiao trembled and spoke, \"Mom, Zhen Min...\"\"Let him stay in there for a while. You go back and take a good shower. The rest will be discussed later!\"After Qiao Xiu Zhi finished speaking, she went to find Da Qiao.She wondered if the kid was frightened just now.Old woman Gu was lying flat on the side of the wall. Her expression showed she had her fill of melon seed.She climbed down the ladder quickly and then ran out without pausing to put away the ladder.Old Fifth Qiao's daughter was lost!She had to hurry up and tell everyone about such a big thing!\"Hey, do you know why old Fifth Qiao looked like his dad died? I know! It turns out that his daughter was lost!\"\"Do you know? Old Fifth Qiao's daughter is lost. It seems that his wife lost her!\"\"Old Fifth Qiao's wife lost her daughter. Old Fifth Qiao came back this time to divorce his wife. Tsk tsk tsk, how long has it been since Qiao Family's last divorce!\"\"What do you think Qiao Family is trying to do? One divorce is enough. Now two and three. It can't be that they all have to get divorced? Who else would dare to marry Qiao Family in the future?\"Old woman Fang was leaning on her crutches after going to her daughter's house to see her precious grandsons. Hearing this, she almost jumped up with joy.\"Oh, back then, they ran to my house and said that my daughter is not good here and there and forced the young couple to divorce. Now everyone sees who is the weirdo? Who is sick? My daughter is now married to Wang Family and living in bliss. Now look at this family. One, two, three. Three are divorced!\"Putting up three of her fingers, she dangled them in front of everyone.\"Our Fang Family was unlucky back then. Why did we end up with such an in-law? That calamity, Da Qiao is even worse. She has affected our Fang Family until now. Oh, yes. My daughter-in-law must have been killed by that calamity. I'm going to go back...\"Before she could finish speaking, she heard a woman rushing over from the river, shouting and screaming, \"Oh, it's not good. Someone come! The children has fallen into the water!\"Children had fallen into the water?There was not a single child in this village who didn't like to go to the river!Fishing in the spring and swimming in the summer. The ice in the river had already melted. Recently children were often seen going to the river.\"Oh, I don't know if my Gou Wa went to the river?\"\"My Gou Dan may also have gone over. I have to hurry and check!\"People with children rushed to the river.Old woman Fang pouted when she saw everyone running away in a hurry.Why did they all run away? She could talk about it for a long time!Leaning on her crutches, she prepared to go home. It was then, she heard the woman, who came to report, grabbed her hand and spoke, \"Old woman Fang, why are you still standing here? Your family's You Rou fell into the river. He hadn't been rescued when I came over to call people. Hurry up and go!\"Old woman Fang was stunned.The next moment, she became angry and raised the crutches in her hand to beat the other party: \"You broken-mouth woman, cursing my family's You Rou!? I will let you curse my family's You Rou! See if I don't kill you!\"She just came out of her daughter's house a moment ago. How could her two precious grandsons run to the river so quickly?So this wicked woman must be cursing her precious grandson!The woman grabbed the crutches that she had whacked over and pushed it back hard: \"My good intention came to no good. If you don't believe me, then don't! Pah, if anything happen in the future, don't expect me to inform you Fang Family!\"After she finished speaking, she turned and left to inform the children's families.Old woman Fang thought about it for a while, but still didn't believe it. She used her crutches and headed home step by step.Qiao Zhen Guo uttered with excitement: \"Second Younger Brother, I didn't expect you to be so sneaky. You've been hiding it from everyone for so long!\"Qiao Zhen Jun had an impressed expression. \"I don't mean to hide it from everyone. I just want to practice and give everyone a surprise!\"Qiao Zhen Guo didn't keep going on about this. He laughed and said, \"Dad and Mom will be very happy to see that you can walk!\"He went to Qiao's small house to carry his second younger brother to the old house for dinner. When he entered, he saw Second Younger Brother practicing walking while leaning against the wall of the room. At that time, his eyes fell to the ground.When everyone heard that a child had fallen into the water, they rushed to the river. As they passed by these two brothers. they suddenly stopped.They seemed to see Qiao Zhen Jun walking just now?No. It should an illusion, right?Qiao Zhen Jun was paralyzed to that degree. Let alone walking, even standing up was a problem. So they must be seeing things!Everyone turned their heads back, took a closer look, and rubbed their eyes to look again.F*ck, that person was really Qiao Zhen Jun!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But now they decided not to go!The gossip here was fresher and more popular!They completely surrounded Qiao Zhen Jun: \"Old Second Qiao, why are you suddenly alright?\"\"Yes! Yes ah! Didn't the doctor say that even if the operation is performed, it will not be cured?\"\"That's right, that's what I heard from the doctor back then. The doctor also said that you can only lie in bed for the rest of your life!\"At the beginning, many villagers and the production leader sent Qiao Zhen Jun to the town hospital. They had heard what the doctor said. This was why they were so shocked now.Qiao Zhen Jun scratched his head and said bluntly, \"I don't know either. I started to feel pain in my lumbar spine a period ago. Then my legs gradually got feeling. I've been practicing walking for the past month, but I still can't walk too long.\"\"Started feeling a period ago. When is that?\" A Sherlock Holmes-like villager asked with determination to break the case to the end.Qiao Zhen Jun halted a moment before vaguely uttered: \"I don't remember this clearly. It's nearly lunch time. We have to go first.\"After he finished speaking, he walked away with his elder brother's arm support.The few villagers didn't get their fill of satisfaction.The Sherlock Holmes-like villager spoke: \"I bet a cucumber, old Second Qiao started to get better after he divorced Fang Xiao Juan!\"\"How do you know?\"The Sherlock Holmes-like villager explained: \"Have you forgotten? When old Second Qiao and Fang Xiao Juan divorced, the pear tree in Qiao's courtyard that hadn't bloomed for seven or eight years bloomed. The pear trees bloomed in winter. What an abnormal event!\"\"I remember this. I even went to Qiao's small house to see it. The pear blossoms were blooming so wonderfully!\"\"I also went to see it. I heard that it recently went into fruition. I guess the fruit can be eaten soon!\"\"I don't know if Qiao Family would agree when I ask for some from them then?\"\"What are you dreaming about!\" the Sherlock Holmes-like villager coughed, \"After Fang Xiao Juan left, Qiao Family's hen that hadn't been laying eggs for few months is laying eggs again. Then Da Qiao's stuttering was cured. Also on that meat distribution day, Qiao Family was allocated an extra 30 jins of pork!\"Thinking of thirty jins of pork, everyone's saliva was about to come down again.\"But a lot of bad things happened in Qiao Family. Take the five children. Two of them are divorced. I heard that Qiao's old Fifth is going to get divorced now. What's so good?\"The Sherlock Holmes-like villager sneered: \"Which family doesn't have their own mess? According to me, Qiao Family is the smartest for breaking the in-law relationship with Fang Family. You seen that broken matters cropping up one after another for Fang Family. Since Wang Family picked up such a broken shoe, they will have trouble in the future!\"Qiao Zhen Jun came to Qiao's old house with his elder brother's helping hand.When everyone saw him like this, they all stood up in shock.Qiao Xiu Zhi was the first to come back to his senses and exclaimed with a look of surprise: \"Old Second, your legs...\"Qiao Zhen Jun happily told: \"Mom, I can walk with my legs. I regained feeling in it before. I wanted to surprise everyone, so I haven't told anyone!\"Even though Qiao Zhen Min was full of melancholy, he was really happy for his Second Brother when he saw that he could stand up!Da Qiao flew over, hugged her dad's leg, and delightfully said with a raised head: \"Dad, you can walk now!\"This was wonderful!When she gave her dad jade bead water, she just wanted to give it a try. She didn't expect it to be so effective!She was really grateful to the little fish. If only she could see little fish again in this life!Qiao Zhen Jun rubbed the child's head and grinned, \"Yes, Dad can walk.\"In the future, this child will not have to work so hard. He will not be her burden!Qiao Xiu Zhi was completely overjoyed in her heart. She ordered Wan Chun Ju: \"Eldest's wife, go and fry another plate of bacon and mushrooms!\"Being called, Wan Chun Ju was so happy that the crow's feet at the corners of her eyes almost flew: \"Okay, Mom. I'll go right now!\"Excellent. She can steal a few bites of bacon while cooking!Chen Qiao Qiao took the initiative to stand up and spoke, \"Eldest Sister-in-law, you are pregnant. Let me go!\"If it were before, Chen Qiao Qiao would definitely not take the initiative to do the work. But now that she lost little Wan'er and her man ignored her, she felt like a sinner of thousand years.She didn't want to divorce Qiao Zhen Min, so she urgently wanted to do something to get on Qiao Family's good side.Wan Chun Ju pointed her eyes and responded, \"No need, Qiao Qiao. You just came back. Just sit down. It's just one dish, I'll be done soon!\"This damn little bum Chen Qiao Qiao! Usually one don't see her so active. She must be trying to steal bacon!Of course Chen Qiao Qiao could guess the big bum Wan Chun Ju's thoughts. Still, she had to fight for it: \"I wasn't home for a month and Eldest Sister-in-law did all the work. I'm back now. Eldest Sister-in-law can take a rest. I'll go do it!\"\"No, Mom let me go!\"\"Then I'll go with Eldest Sister-in-law!\"\"No need. How could frying a dish take two people?\"The two of them fought. To the unknown, they would think that Qiao Family's two daughters-in-law were hardworking and simple!Qiao Xiu Zhi couldn't stand it any more and shouted, \"Neither of you need to go, Hong Xia, go fry it!\"Wan Chun Ju: The meat in the mouth flew. Damn that little bum!Chen Qiao Qiao didn't notice that Wan Chun Ju was glaring at her. She turned her head to look at her man.The two's gaze collided in the air. Soon Qiao Zhen Jun turned his head away.Chen Qiao Qiao lowered her head in frustration.When it was time to eat, everyone discovered that the main room's dining table had actually split in half.Except for Qiao Zhen Min, the jaws of everyone else almost fell to the ground.Qiao Xiu Zhi calmly spoke: \"Let's eat on the stone table outside today. Later, we'll get someone to make another one.\"This broken table was built by Qiao Zhen Jun. His legs just recovered and definitely can't do wood work.Because Qiao Zhen Min's family came over today, one more meat dish was added to the already made three meat dishes. The family had their lips covered with oil.Even Qiao Zhen Min, who was in a bad mood, couldn't help but clip two more chopsticks full of food.After eating, Qiao Xiu Zhi told everyone about little Wan'er's disappearance. Everyone fell silent after hearing it.Thoughtful Qiao Dong He's eyes reddened. Covering her face, she started crying.When Da Qiao saw her elder cousin sister crying, she hurried to her side and softly coaxed, \"Elder Cousin Sister don't cry. Little Wan'er will definitely come back!\"Although Da Qiao was a year older now, her voice was still soft and waxy. Delicate as cotton candy.When Qiao Dong He heard Younger Sister comforting her, she was too embarrassed to cry. She raised her head and pinched Younger Sister's face and responded, \"Okay. Elder Cousin Sister, won't cry. Let's find little Wan'er together!\"When Qiao Zhen Min heard Da Qiao's words, his gloomy eyes lit up. His gaze fixed on Da Qiao. However, receiving a pointed gaze from his mom, he restrained himself.To be honest, even now, he still didn't believe in things like luck and ghosts.However, he was at the end of his rope. In the past month, he had tried everything and still had no news of little Wan'er.Therefore, he was willing to believe in the existence of these things if little Wan'er can be brought back.If little Wan'er can come back, he was willing to glorify Da Qiao in the future. He will have resistance, as long as little Wan'er can come back...Wan Chun Ju didn't know about little Wan'er's disappearance earlier. Now she glanced at Chen Qiao Qiao with some guilt.She was wondering why little butt Chen Qiao Qiao looked as thin as a paper man after not seeing for a month. It turned out that this happened!She was so unlucky!Forget it. If there is a next time, she'll let her fry the meat.Qiao Zhen Guo said: \"Fifth Younger Brother, Eldest Brother isn't very capable. But Eldest Brother got a whole body of strength. After you rest for a while, Eldest Brother will ask for leave to go with you to find little Wan'er!\"Qiao Zhen Jjun spoke: \"Fifth Younger Brother, I can't search with you for the time being due to my legs. But I still have some money left. If you need it, just use it!\"Qiao Hong Xia followed up: \"Youngest Brother, let me know when you are going on the search. I will go with you!\"Qiao Zhen Min's eyes were wet again. It felt sour and uncomfortable: \"Eldest Brother, Second Elder Brother, Third Elder Sister, thank you! Also, Dad and Mom, thank you!\"Qiao Zhen Guo waved his hand: \"We're family, no need to say thank you!\"Xue Chuan quietly grasped his wife's hand and whispered, \"You can rest assured now?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at him and smiled.If the few children can help each other like this in the future, there was nothing to worry even if she and Xue Chuan pass away in the future....The children who fell into the river were rescued. Fortunately no one drowned.Although the weather was getting warmer each day, it was still spring. The water in the river was still very cold. After the children who fell into the water were rescued, they constantly trembled and sneezed.One child had been in the water for a long time. Because of his young age, he developed a high fever soon after he was rescued.This child was none other than Fang Family's Fang You Rou.When the rescuer saw that there was no one from Fang Family present, he was furious. He carried Fang You Rou to Fang's house and put him down. He didn't need their thanks and turned around and left.When old woman Fang saw her wet youngest grandson, her face turned pale and she wailed: \"My precious little grandson, what happened to you? Who pushed you into the water? Quickly get up and tell Grandmother. Grandmother will go to settle the account with them!\"Fang You Rou closed his eyes as he shivered all over. He kept screaming cold. How could he possibly say anything else?Fang You Liang, who had always been inseparable with Fang You Liang, disappeared at this time.Fang Fu Gui came out. When he saw his youngest son like this, he impatiently uttered, \"Enough. Why are you crying at this time? Why don't you hurry up and send him to the health clinic?\"Only then did old woman Fang remember to send him to the clinic. However, she had sprained her waist and couldn't hold the child at all. While Fang Fu Gui couldn't carry the child due to his legs.Old woman Fang had to go to Wang's house on crutches to ask them for help.Although Wang Family felt that Fang Family was troublesome, they didn't refuse this kind of life-death matter.In the end, Fang You Rou's life was saved. It cost Fang Family a total of five yuan!Old woman Fang felt her flesh ached.As for Qiao Family's side, the news that Qiao Zhen Jun was able to stand up and walk again soon spread throughout the entire Qili Village.Fang Xiao Juan was stunned when she heard the news.Old Second Qiao stood up?Impossible!Must be a scam!At the side, Xiao Qiao was also extremely shocked.Her dad stood up? So what was the point of her getting her mom divorced in the first place?At the beginning, she thought her dad would be paralyzed for the rest of his life, so she urged her mom to change her spouse to Wang Xin Sheng.Who knew that things weren't as good as she imagined. Wang Family didn't treat them, mother and daughter as anything!She was like a cow and a horse in Wang's house. She had to do everything. If she had known that her dad would be better, why would she have picked up sesame seeds and lost the watermelon?She got up with the desire to run out, but was stopped by her mom.\"Xiao Qiao, come back here. If you dare to look for old Second Qiao, don't come back in the future!\"When Fang Xiao Juan said this, she wasn't afraid that Xiao Qiao wouldn't come back. Because she had already seen the big picture. That old witch, Qiao Xiu Zhi wouldn't let Xiao Qiao go back!Xiao Qiao almost clenched her teeth to pieces with hatred!Soon, a new news bombed the entire Qili Village again. Qiao Family asked a matchmaker to go to Lin Family to propose marriage!After inquiring, everyone knew that it was Qiao Zhen Jun who wanted to marry the widow, Lin Hui!This time, even Fang Xiao Juan couldn't stay calm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if she didn't want him, other women weren't allowed to contaminate him!It was best that Qiao Zhen Jun live alone and never marry another wife!If he must marry, that woman can be anyone except Lin Hui!She and Lin Hui grew up together. Everyone thought they had a good relationship. But only she knew how jealous she was of Lin Hui!They were both girls. One was pampered at home and didn't have to do any work, while the other was hard-working at home and got scolded as a hoodoo every day.How can this make her heart feel balanced?She knew from the beginning that Lin Hui liked Qiao Zhen Jun. It just at that time, she and male educated youth were an item, so she was happy to see Lin Hui like Qiao Zhenjun.She marry a male educated youth and will be a city person in the future. While Lin Hui marry Qiao Zhen Jun and be a muddy leg all her life!Who knows that people's plan can't beat heaven's plan. Once the male educated youth returned to the city, there was no news. She had came to age and her reputation wasn't good. So she had to take the initiative to attack.After flicking through, she set her eyes on Qiao Zhen Jun.Although Qiao Zhen Jun was a little dull-witted, being like this meant he was perfect to control. What's more, he was good-looking and Qiao Family was well-off.More importantly, she couldn't marry into the city. So such a good match can't fall into Lin Hui's hand!So she and her elder brother made a plan together. She got her elder brother keep guard outside the forest, while she waited for Qiao Zhen Jun by the stream that he would pass by every day. Once she saw him come from a distance, she immediately took off her clothes...Later, when she got her wish and married Qiao Zhen Jun, Lin Hui was so infuriated that she ran to ask her why she did this when knowing that the person she liked was Qiao Zhen Jun. Why did she snatch him from her.She forgot how she answered her at the time. Anyway, the two cut ties since then. In order to get revenge on her, Lin Hui chose to marry an educated youth.At first, she was a little jealous. Unfortunately some people just didn't have that fate. The educated youth drowned shortly after returning to the city and Lin Hui became a widow.Now this widow actually wanted to pick up the man she didn't want. Keep dreaming!The more Fang Xiao Juan thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt. She put on her clothes and prepared to go out.t Wang Xin Sheng came in at this time.Wang Xin Sheng looked at her and said, \"Where do you want to go when you dress like this?\"Fang Xiao Juan's heart trembled and she replied, \"Nowhere in particular. I was just a little bored in the house, so I wanted to go out for a walk.\"Wang Xin Sheng raised his lips to a strange smile: \"Today your ex-husband sent a matchmaker to Lin's house to ask for marriage. How do you feel when you know?\"Fang Xiao Juan felt so guilty that she dared not look at him in the eye: \"What can I possibly think? It's just trash I don't want. A pair of trash makes a perfect match!\"Wang Xin Sheng watched her and stated, \"It's best that you think like this. If I find out that you dare to do something wrong to me, don't blame me for turning face and not recognizing you!\"After he finished speaking, he turned around and left again. He hummed a little song on his way to Wang's old house for a meal.Fang Xiao Juan stared at his back and almost vomited blood!...When everyone knew that Qiao Zhen Jun wanted to marry Lin Hui, there were mixed reviews.\"One is divorced and the other is a widow. Isn't it good for the two to live together?\"\"What so good? Didn't Lin Hui jump into the well for this matter? I thought she was innocent. It turned out to be just a show. Tsk tsk tsk!\"\"I say, Xing Hua, it's best to not let Auntie Xiu Zhi hear what you said. Be careful that she will punch you like a wild boar!\"Xing Hua's face went red and white. She spat to the ground with a 'pah': \"I'm not talking nonsense!\"Whether it was nonsense or not, everyone will naturally not argue with her. But some people knew that Xing Hua had been very close to Fang Xiao Juan during this time.She was targeting Qiao Family and the Lin family with words now. Just didn't know if these were her own opinion or said on behalf of Fang Xiao Juan.Some people had criticized Qiao Zhen Jun fro being conscienceless: \"Old Fifth Qiao's daughter is gone. Is it appropriate for old Second Qiao to marry a wife at this time? He doesn't have a sense of brotherhood!\"Qiao Zhen Jun originally didn't want to get married at this time. After all, old Fifth's daughter had just gone missing. It was inappropriate for him to have a wedding at this time.But his mom said, Lin Hui had been coming to Qiao's house a lot these days. Maybe she had been seen by someone. If he was a man, he should give her an explanation.His mom had also said, \"Little Wan'er is gone. So Qiao Family won't hold happy events from now on? And everyone live unhappily ever since?\"After Fifth Younger Brother found out, he took the initiative to run over to persuade him. Told him to not worry about him.He pretended to be relaxed and spoke, \"In ancient times, there was a saying of \"Chongxi\u00a0.\". Currently, the atmosphere at home is low. If you bring it some joy, maybe little Wan'er will be found soon. Second Elder Brother, you should quickly marry in Second Sister-in-law back!\"Since the involved party didn't mind, he naturally had nothing to be concerned about.Just like what his mom said, if he doesn't act again, it will be even worse when there are all kinds of rumors.At Lin Hui's home.Wang Qiu Ying hugged her fair and tender little grandson. Smiling from ear to ear, she spoke: \"Hui'er, don't blame Mom for stopping you before. If old Second Qiao's legs aren't better, Mom will never agree to this marriage. Mom did this because I don't want you to suffer too much bitterness in the future!\"It was really hard to take care of a paralyzed man for the rest of one's life.If there he accidentally got paralysis after marriage, it can't be helped. Knowing that the other party was paralyzed and still marrying over was called self-inflicted burden!If old Second Qiao was still paralyzed, she can't sit and watch her daughter jump into the fire pit!Two spot of pinkness appeared on Lin Hui's face. She softly said, \"Mom, I know. I didn't blame you and Dad.\"What she didn't say was that even if Qiao Zhen Jun's legs didn't get better and her parents persisted on objecting, she would still insist on marrying him!It was just that the current situation was better now. Everyone was happy.Little Dong Lin was sitting in his grandma's arms. His big black eyes wandered around and he spoke in his baby voice, \"Auntie next door said little Dong Lin will call Uncle Qiao Dad in the future. Mom, it is like this?\"Being looked at by the child like this, Lin Hui felt that her cheeks were hot enough to fry an egg. She bit her lips and acknowledged with an \"en\".Seeing her youngest daughter's shyness, Wang Qiu Ying laughed even more heartily. She hugged her little grandson and spoke, \"Yes, little Dong Lin. You have to remember when you see your Elder Sister Qiao Qiao's dad in the future, you should call him Dad. Do you understand?\"Xiao Dong Lin loudly responded, \"I understand. That's great. Little Dong Lin also has a dad!\"Hearing this, Lin Hui's eyes became hot and tears almost fell.In Qiao's small house, the same conversation was also taking place.Qiao Zhen Jun looked at the little dumpling in front of him. He licked his lips nervously and stated, \"Da Qiao, Dad has something to tell you.\"Da Qiao said softly, \"Dad, you're going to marry Auntie Hui?\"Qiao Zhen Jun was stunned for a moment. But he soon understood that the women in the village were nosy. They must have told Da Qiao.He nodded: \"Dad and Auntie Hui are together. Don't be sad. Even if there are other younger brothers and sisters in the future, you will always be the most important in Dad's heart!\"It was already hard for simple Qiao Zhen Jun to say such remark of 'affection'.He had to say these words though. He didn't want his daughter to be worried or unhappy because of his remarriage.The phrase 'adversity reveal the true feeling' wasn't false at all.Since he was paralyzed, his family had worked tirelessly to take care of him.Especially his daughter, Da Qiao. She often massaged his legs and talked with him for fear that he will be bored. It's really hard for such little one to be so caring.On the other hand, Xiao Qiao made his heart chilled.Since she left with her mom, she had never come to see him, her dad again. Unfortunately not even once.Da Qiao blinked her big eyes and softly replied, \"Dad, don't worry. I won't be sad. I like Auntie Hui and little Brother Dong Lin very much. I want to become a family with them!\"She knew that everything the aunties in the village told her were malicious. They hoped that she would make trouble with her dad. Why would she make trouble?Was it because Auntie Hui was bad, or was little Brother Dong Lin not cute enough?So she won't do what they want! Hmph!When Qiao Zhen Jun heard this, he breathed a sigh of relief: \"Dad is very happy to hear you say that!\"He suddenly looked forward to the days after the wedding....Because both parties intended to make this marriage happen, the process went smoothly. In addition, both of them were married for the second time. So many procedures were omitted.Half a month later, it will be farming slack period. Many people will take advantage of that time to quickly have a wedding. Qiao Zhen Jun and Lin Hui's happy event will also be set at that time.In a blink of an eye, half a month passed.In rural areas, the day before the wedding, they will \"pull out the dowry\". In other words, people who marry their daughters out will send the dowry to the male's house. Which is similar to the ancient time's showing off dowry.It was just that the economy of every household wasn't good now. Many people can't get enough to eat, let alone dowry for their daughters. So Qili Village hadn't seen anyone \"pulling out the dowry\" for many years.On this day, Lin Family was lively.Lin Hui's five elder brothers got up early in the morning, dressed in new clothes, and took all the dowry for their younger sister to Qiao's house.The people in the village quickly came out to watch the fun.\"Oh, Lin Family really loved their youngest girl, Lin Hui. This is a second marriage and they still pays so much dowry. Really, as a human it is better to pick a good birth!\"\"You're wrong. Back then, when Lin Hui married that educated youth, the dowry wasn't as good as it is now. Look at those large cabinets and tables. All made of good wood. I'm envious to death!\"\"If I knew earlier that Lin Family would give out so much dowry, so I would ask the matchmaker to request for marriage. Oh, it's too late to say anything now!\"\"Come on. Gou Sheng. You are poor and empty-pocketed. Even a female dog won't set their eyes on you!\"Wang Xin Sheng, Fang Xiao Juan, and Xiao Qiao came out of Wang's old house,. They happened to encountered this scene.Wang Xin Sheng poked his ears as he said with a crooked mouth, \"Tsk tsk tsk. if I knew earlier, I should have married that widow Lin Hui. With so much dowry, whoever married her wouldn't be at a loss!\"Besides, Lin Hui was pretty good-looking.Xiao Qiao's heart dropped. She remembered that Wang Xin Sheng married Lin Hui in his previous life.Fang Xiao Juan's face went red from anger: \"Wang Xin Sheng, what do you mean? Do you regret marrying me now?\"Wang Xin Sheng glanced at her and responded, \"Fang Xiao Juan, I advise you to stop making trouble. For the sake of the child in your belly, I won't divorce you. But if you dare to make trouble again, go back to Fang's house now!\"F*ck. Lust had fogged up his mind and caused him to set his eyes on this woman, Fang Xiao Juan!At the beginning, he really didn't expect that Fang Xiaojuan would dare to use this matter to threaten their Wang Family. It was the first time he was threatened by a woman. He would never be able to jump over this hurdle in his life!And the group of moths, Fang Family. They have more sh*t matter every day than him. Now everyone in the family was full of grudging feeling toward him. Wasn't it because of her maternal family?So he had already lost patience with Fang Xiao Juan. It would be better if she dared to make trouble. Everyone can part ways!Fang Xiao Juan was so angry that her chest hurt. Her chest rose and fell violently. She almost smashed her teeth together into pieces!This damn man actually dared to threaten her like this. He really pissed her off!Xiao Qiao frowned.She suddenly couldn't understand how a despicable person like Wang Xin Sheng became a good husband and father in his last life?In fact, Xiao Qiao only saw that Wang Xin Sheng had become a good father and a good husband in his previous life and became the first ten thousand yuan household in the village. What she didn't see was how many tears and energy Lin Hui had shed in order to train him before he became a good husband and a good father.Behind the prodigal son, there was a woman who was riddled with wounds by him.So she was thinking too beautifully when she wanted to sit back and enjoy it!Wang Xin Sheng saw that Fang Xiao Juan didn't dare to make trouble and walked away with a proud look on his shoulders.Fang Xiao Juan watched his back. Her facial features were distorted with hatred.Since marrying into Wang family, nothing went well!Completely drowned in bad luck!...The next day was Qiao Family's wedding day.The gate of Qiao's old house was wide open. Qiao Family ahd dressed up and put on their best clothes.Da Qiao had even put on the floral dress that Auntie Hui made for her. Her hair was tied into two small buns and decorated with two small red flowers. The little face is fair and tender. Also so rosy and puffy. With a pouty small lips. Oh, as beautiful as a little fairy.When everyone saw Da Qiao dressed up so cutely and beautifully, they couldn't help teasing her: \"Da Qiao, where did your new clothes come from?\"Da Qiao smiled until her eyes curved into crescent and sweetly said, \"Auntie Hui made it for me.\"Someone teased her: \"Why are you still calling Auntie Hui. It should be Mom instead!\"Da Qiao pursed her lips and smiled. She didn't answer everyone's words.She liked Aunt Hui, but couldn't call Auntie Hui Mom when told to. She was too shy.Xing Hua mingled in the crowd and pouted: \"No wonder Xiao Juan said she is a white-eyed wolf. She called others Mom so quickly. So many years of raising was in vain!\"When everyone heard what she said, they immediately distanced themselves from her.Where did this fool come from?Today was Qiao Family's happy event and she rushed to say sour words. Wasn't this a slap in the face?Xing Hua saw that no one agreed with her. Instead, they isolated her out of the circle. Her face flushed with anger.Seeing that no one was talking to her, she didn't want to watch the fun anymore. She turned and walked away muttering.Unexpectedly, before taking two steps, one of her foot suddenly stepped on a lump of chicken poo and her foot slipped...\"BOOM!\"She fell on all fours. The pain caused her tears to spill out all at once.\"Hahaha, she deserves it. Who told her talk nonsense!\" Everyone couldn't help laughing.Xing Hua almost vomited blood!When it comes to weddings in the countryside, familiar neighbors were invited to help. Qiao Family was no exception. Qiao Xiu Zhi invited a few kind women to help.Old woman Gu heard the laughter coming from the next door and spat fiercely on the ground: \"Halfway formed couple keep a backup trick each. I want to see how long old Second Qiao and Lin Family's widow can be together!\"Because Qiao Family didn't ask old woman Gu to help out, old woman Gu held a grudge.At this moment, a group of uninvited guests came to Qiao Family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Was this falling out?When Qiao Xiu Zhi saw that it was the uninvited Qiao Hong Mei family, she blandly spoke, \"Since you're here, go in and sit.\"Qiao Hong Mei was pissed!The last time she departed Qiao's house with ruthless words left behind and saw a gray rabbit halfway back. Who knew that the rabbit hadn't been caught. She and her eldest daughter were bitten by mosquitoes in the face instead. They had a high fever that night and were sent to the hospital!Because of this sickness, the family spent dozens of yuan altogether. Her husband and mother-in-law chewed her out and told her that she must get the money back from her maternal home this time!She originally wanted to find an excuse to come back. Then she heard that her Second Elder Brother was going to remarry and thought to herself- she'll wait for them to invite her and borrow this to forgive her mom.Well, what do you know!She waited and waited all the way until her Second Elder Brother's wedding day and no one came to inform her!Really pissed her off!She felt that her face was being stomped on the ground!So when she saw her mom trying to get the topic out of the way, she sneered in her heart: \"Mom, you haven't told me why Second Elder Brother got married and notified everyone except me alone? Mom, do you not like me, your duaghter so much?\"\"Didn't you tell us not to beg you when you left last time? Didn't you say you would never step into Qiao's house? Then why should I invite you? While you, don't you feel ashamed if coming uninvited?\"At the beginning, Qiao Xiu Zhi wanted to save some face for each other. However, some people were shameless!Qiao Hong Mei's face turned red and black: \"...\"Her mom hates her so much!In front of so many people, she didn't even give her any face!If it was her usual temper, she would definitely turn around and leave. But thinking of her man and her mother-in-law's words, she gritted her teeth and stayed there. She refused to submit.If it was up to Qiao Xiu Zhi to criticize, she would say this daughter was mentally ill!Every time she stabbed others with words first. And when others did the same to her, she immediately showed an expression that people all over the world had wronged her!Truly treating herself as a princess and the whole world must go her way?It was a disgusting sight to see!Some people considered how today was a joyous day and came over to persuaded: \"Oh, how could mother and daughter have an overnight feud? Alright, alright, let's all take one step back. Hong Mei should be tired after coming so far, go in and have a rest.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi did not speak.There was only one person in this world who can make her bow her head. That was her husband, Xue Chuan.Other? Haha!Seeing that her mom didn't speak, Qiao Hong Mei was so angry that her chest hurt again. Still, she followed other people's words and walked into Qiao's old house.After entering the yard, Qiao Hong Mei felt more and more uncomfortable when she saw Qiao Hong Xia's feeling-at-home appearance.\"Third Elder Sister, why are you here? Oh, I forgot. I heard that you got divorced and went home? It couldn't be true, right?\" Qiao Hong Mei exclaimed as if she was \"surprised\".Qiao Hong Xia's face sank and responded: \"Hong Mei, if you want to have a wedding wine today, I advise you not to make trouble. Otherwise I don't mind making your face swollen. Even when today is a joyous day for Second Elder Brother, I will not be polite with you!\"Qiao Hong Xia and this fourth younger sister never gotten along with each other since they were young.This person had a petty hearts since she was a child. Qiao Hong Xia suffered a lot due to her when she was a child!Today, she clearly knew that it was her Second Elder Brother's joyous day and still made trouble as soon as she came. If she really dared to stirred something up, she wouldn't be polite to her!Qiao Hong Mei's face flushed: \"Third Elder Sister, did I say something wrong? Did you not get divorced? Or did you not go home?\"Qiao Zhen Min came over and stated coldly, \"Fourth Elder Sister, are you sure you want to persist on making trouble?\"Qiao Hong Mei was trembling with anger!In this family, she was always like an outsider. No one will stand by her!It was because of them that she felt unjust in her heart!But after changing the angle, and her heart suddenly became proud.The wicked will get their punishment. In this family, the divorced got divorced or lose their daughter. Truly deserved it!At this moment, Qiao Zhen Jun came out holding Qiao Zhen Guo's arm.During happy events, people were full of spirit.Today's Qiao Zhen Jun is wearing a green military uniform and a bridegroom flower on his chest. It made him look taller and handsome.\"Oh, the groom is here!\"\"Hahaha, congratulations! congratulations!\"Seeing Qiao Zhen Jun, everyone smiled and congratulated him.As long as one's brain wasn't in water, one won't speak rude words at this time to save others' face on a day like today. Otherwise, don't blame others for making troubles on their family's happy event!Qiao Zhen Jun was full of energy. His rosy face smiled and thanked everyone.Before Qiao Hong Mei came, she heard that her Second Elder Brother was no longer paralyzed. She didn't see it with her own eyes, so she didn't believe it. Now she did, she was completely shocked.It was wonderful like this. Her Second Elder Brother had healed. She can get him to make furniture for her like before.That's right. She can get him to make some furniture. Then she'll take it out and sell it to others. Of course, the money for transfer belonged to her alone!Her eyes spun around. The corner of her mouth twitched up: \"Second Elder Brother, congratulations! I didn't expect you to stand up. I thought you could only be a paralyzed person for your whole life!\"Qiao Zhen Jun: \"...\"Everyone: \"...\"It was better to not speak!Qiao Zhen Guo had a stupid mouth and often made Wan Chun Ju vomit blood. Still, he never spoke out in malice. So everyone can't get angry if they were angry with him.But what Qiao Hong Mei said was just like the breath of someone who didn't brush their teeth. The stench was unpleasant!Qiao Hong Xia came over, pulled her, and said, \"If you can't speak, don't speak. No one will think you are mute!\"Qiao Hong Mei flushed with anger: \"You...!\"Qiao Zhen Jun's face was also a little ugly. With his gentle personality, he couldn't say harsh words.He turned around and pushed the bicycle. With his Eldest Brother and Fifth Younger brother, he went out to pick up the bride from Lin's house.Seeing that Qiao Zhen Jun had pushed the bicycle, everyone started making noise again.\"Qiao Family really values Lin Family very much. At such a close distance, they still use a bicycle!\"\"Ain't that right! When Fang Xiao Juan married into Wang Family, and she didn't even have a banquet!\"\"Then why didn't you mention the fact that Fang Xiao Juan didn't bring any dowry. Oh, that's not right. She brought\u00a0an oil bottle\u00a0!\"\"Enough you guys. Why mention that woman on such a day? It would be bad if Qiao Family heard it!\"The crowd didn't say anything then.Having a bicycle these days was something to be quite proud of. Even when one have money, they may not be able to buy it.When most people get married, they use up all kinds of contacts to borrow a bicycle from others. Still, most people can't borrow it.Qiao Family and Lin Family lived so close together. Everyone thought they would definitely not borrow a bicycle.Fang Xiao Juan hid behind a big tree and watched a rosy-faced Qiao Zhen Jun pushing a bicycle. She almost clenched her teeth to shatters in hatred!Infuriating to death!When Qiao Zhen Jun married her, there was no bicycle!The wedding banquet wasn't so big!Fang Xiao Juan held her stomach. She felt her stomach throbbing with anger.Along the way, children followed behind him with merry and laughter as he headed to Lin's house.When Qiao Zhen Jun reached Lin's house, he saw one, two, three, four, five figure as soon as he entered the courtyard. Lin Hui's five brothers were standing in a row at the door of the courtyard.His heart trembled and instantly felt his legs went a little weak: \"Eldest Brother, Second Elder Brother, Third Elder Brother, Fourth Elder Brother, Fifth Elder Brother.\"When everyone heard him call out this row of brothers, they couldn't help laughing.\"I said Zhen Jun, Lin Hui has five older brothers. If you dare to bully Lin Hui in the future, you have to consider it carefully!\"Qiao Zhen Jun's cold sweat was about to break down: \"Don't dare. How could I possibly bully Lin Hui!\"\"Oh, putting down the husband's steel down so soon. That can't do old Second Qiao. You have lost all of our men's faces!\"\"Hahaha... Go away, Gou Sheng. You're a stinky man who doesn't have a woman, what face can you have?\"Hearing this, everyone burst into laughter.Seeing that Qiao Zhen Jun was so tactful, Lin Hui's five elder brothers didn't make it difficult for him. Just 'warned' a few words and quickly let him in....At Qiao's old house.Da Qiao was like a little princess, surrounded by many children. Her face was flushed red and her eyebrows were curved as she smiled very happily.One little girl spoke, \"Da Qiao, I heard that all stepmoms in the world are vicious. Aren't you afraid?\"Da Qiao shook her head and softly replied, \"Auntie Hui is very nice. She's not vicious. Look at the clothes I'm wearing. Auntie Hui made it for me!\"Everyone looked at the floral dress on Da Qiao's body. The red color were bright. While the style was never seen before. They were very envious.That little girl continued: \"Isn't it just a floral dress. She buy you out like this? Da Qiao, she is trying to buy you, don't be deceived!\"Da Qiao wasn't angry: \"No. Auntie Hui has always doted me very much. She said she will make many beautiful dresses for me in the future!\"The little girl rolled her eyes, not knowing what to do next.She turned her head to look at the big tree.Fang Xiao Juan, who was behind the big tree, saw her action and mentally scolded her idiocy!Da Qiao noticed the little girl's movements and asked curiously, \"Why do you always look over there? Is there anything over there?\"The little girl scratched her head and answered, \"I'll tell you. Your previous mom gave me a few fruit candies and asked me to tell you what I said before. I've finished speaking now. I'm leaving.\"After she finished speaking, she skipped away.Fang Xiao Juan, who was behind the big tree, was so angry that her mouth was crooked!Accepted her candy and it end up like this!? Don't let her see her next time!Now that she was discovered, Fang Xiao Juan didn't plan to hide. She glanced around and found that there was no one from Qiao Family around. So she showed her head from behind the tree.\"Da Qiao, come here!\"When Da Qiao saw her mom, she froze for a moment. Then she uncomfortably called out, \"Mom.\"She hadn't seen her mom for a long time. She was a little sad when she heard that she had remarried. Afterward, she was too occupied.She had to learn embroidery and cooking with her grandfather. She had to learn five-animal exercise with her grandmother too. There was school. So she had no time to think of her mom.Fang Xiao Juan watched her greet her and snorted coldly: \"So you still remember that I'm your mom? Still not coming over? You want me to go over and invite you over?\"Da Qiao walked over slowly, but stopped one meter away from her: \"What do you want with me?\"Seeing her defensive behavior, Fang Xiao Juan gritted her teeth angrily: \"I told you to come here. Didn't you hear?\"Her voice was sharp and high-pitched. Along with this harsh voice, her expression also became hideous.When Da Qiao saw her like this, she retreated a few steps back instead of going over: \"If there's nothing else, I will go back. If I don't, my grandmother will be looking for me in a while.\"Unexpectedly, she knew how to use Qiao Xiu Zhi to threaten her after not seeing each other for a long time!Fang Xiao Juan gritted her teeth angrily: \"I'm telling you, you can't call that woman Lin Hui 'Mom'. Do you hear me?\"Da Qiao didn't answer.She was too shy to call Auntie Hui 'Mom'. But that didn't mean she didn't want to. So she wouldn't promise her mom.Seeing that she didn't answer her, Fang Xiao Juan was furious: \"What? Do you still want to call someone else Mom? You white-eyed wolf! I have raised you for so many years and this is how you repay me?\"Da Qiao bit her lip and replied, \"But Younger Sister calls Uncle Wang Dad. Why didn't you say she is a white-eyed wolf?\"Fang Xiao Juan choked to death: \"...\"It sounded so reasonable that it was impossible to refute.\"Can you compare with your younger sister? Forget it, let's drop this matter. Let me tell you, all stepmoms in this world are black-hearted. When that Lin Hui enters the door, she will beat you and swear at you. Once they have other children, they will kick you out of the house. So...\"Da Qiao interrupted her loudly: \"No! You are talking nonsense! Auntie Hui won't beat me or scold me. Only you beat me and scold me. I won't talk to you!\"Fang Xiao Juan was so mad that she jumped up and wanted to catch Da Qiao.At this moment, Qiao Xiu Zhi's voice sounded from Qiao's old house: \"Da Qiao, who are you talking to?\"Fang Xiao Juan's heart trembled. She turned around and hurried dashed away.Qiao Xiu Zhi came out and found Da Qiao standing there alone. She called her again.Da Qiao hurriedly turned around and ran over: \"Grandmother, my mom just came over. She said that Auntie Hui is a stepmother and would beat me and scold me in the future.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi inwardly cursed. She lowered her head and responded, \"Don't listen to her nonsense. Your Auntie Hui is a gentle person. She will not beat you. If she dares to treat you badly, come and look for Grandmother, understand? \"\"Okay, Grandmother is the best!\" Da Qiao raised her little face. Her clear black eyes gleaming with joy again....Fang Xiao Juan ran as if a ghost was chasing her.She returned to Wang's house out of breath. Just as she was about to sit down, Wang Xin Sheng came in with a dark face.\"Where did you go just now?\" Wang Xin Sheng stared at her with a pair of sharp eyes.Fang Xiao Juan's heart trembled as her voice trembled, \"I... I didn't go anywhere in particular. Just casually walking around.\"\"Casually walking around? Casually end up at Qiao's house?\" Wang Xin Sheng's face was even more terrible. It was gloomy and scary. \"What? Today is the day of your ex-husband's remarriage. Are you reluctant?\"Fang Xiao Juan shook her head as if it was chopping onion: \"No...no, why would I be reluctant?\"She knew she shouldn't have gone. But she just couldn't help it.She kept hearing people talk about how much\u00a0importance\u00a0Qiao Zhen Jun attached to Lin Hui. She felt very uncomfortable. She had to see it with her own eyes.But after seeing it, she was even more uncomfortable!\"SLAP!\"Wang Xin Sheng slapped her face and viciously declared: \"Fang Xiao Juan, I'm telling you this now. If you dare to put a green hat on me, see how I'll kill you!\"\"You dare... hit me?\"Fang Xiao Juan never thought that Wang Xin Sheng would hit her. This slap almost slapped her face crooked!Wang Xin Sheng smirkingly looked: \"Why won't I dare to hit you?\"Wang Xin Sheng was a scumbag through and through!Why did his previous wife die? It was because she had to go to the river to wash clothes with a big belly in winter. Then she slipped and died of dystocia and hemorrhage.The previous wife had received domestic violence. In the countryside, it was quite normal for a man to beat a woman though. As long as no one was killed, no one would take it seriously.The woman, who was beaten, also didn't take it seriously. After the ruckus, they made up again a few days later.But Fang Xiao Juan had been married to Qiao Zhen Jun for so many years and no matter how overboard she was, Qiao Zhen Jun had never touched her. She almost forgot that other men can beat women!\"I can't live anymore. I have children for you and you still beat me... God, I can't live anymore...\"After being stunned, Fang Xiao Juan laid on the ground and sprawled.Wang Xin Sheng glanced at her and turned away.If it weren't for the fact that she had his baby in her belly, today wouldn't be a slap in the face!Fang Xiao Juan cried for a long time and no one came to comfort her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So the dishes prepared this time were top-notch. There were two meat dishes in each table. This hadn't been seen in anywhere in ten miles for a long time!The villagers didn't have time to praise them. They buried themselves in eating. They couldn't talk too much at the moment. If they said one word, they would eat less meat. They have nowhere to cry then.The villagers ate until their mouths were covered with oil. The smell of meat wafted outside Qiao's old house. Those who weren't invited to the banquet passed by and all gulped hard.It was so fragrant. It had been more than a month since they entered the countryside. Let alone eating meat, they haven't even seen meat residue!\"Da Zhi, didn't you say that you set Qiao Family's eldest as your target? Why is there no news at all recently?\"Ye Zhen Zhen swallowed her saliva as she stretched her neck to look inside Qiao's old house.Da Zhi was also swallowing. Her face instantly sank when she heard this.Can she be blamed for this?Qiao Zhen Guo looked simple and honest on the outside. Who knew he got a poisonous tongue once he opened his mouth!On the way to the production team on the first day, she lost all face. After that, she felt that the male educated youths looked at her strangely. It was only recently that the situation improved a bit.She originally wanted to change target, but the villagers in the production team didn't like to have much contact the educated youth. Those who were willing to interact with them were all idler or poor people who wanted to take advantage!For example, there was one called Gou Sheng in the village. He would pick some wild flowers and put them at their educated youth center every day. He was using this method to try and impress one of the female educated youths and finally marry a wife back!Truly daydreaming? Dreaming too beautifully!As for the other men in the village, they were either too ugly, too old, too poor, or have little power in their hands. It seem that they were all inferior to Qiao Zhen Guo!Qiao Zhen Guo was the first\u00a0Waterloo\u00a0in her life. She had always been brooding about it. So after pondering again and again, she decided to attack the other party.But!Don't know what was up with this person. He ran faster than a rabbit every day after work. She didn't have a chance to talk to him if she wanted to grasp the opportunity!Really pissed her off!Ye Zhen Zhen saw that she didn't speak and didn't continue to ask.She looked at her rough hands and sighed, \"Say, in this production team, which family has a lot of sons and well-off excluding Qiao Family?\"Da Zhi answered: \"Wang Family. The production leader's family.\"Ye Zhen Zhen's eyes lit up: \"That's right. How could I forget this!\"Da Zhi spoke: \"If you want to choose a target, I suggest you choose Wang Family's old Fifth. Apart from him, the other three men in Wang Family are all blockheads!\"Don't ask her why she knew. If asked, then answer was that she had tried. They all avoided her like she was a snake or a scorpion!Ye Zhen Zhen's eyes flashed. It was unknown what she was thinking....The children went to one side to play after eating.Da Qiao's mind was simple. Although she still remembered the last time Chen Lai Di accused her, she didn't take the opportunity to exclude her. She let her play with everyone.Before she came to Qiao's house, Chen Lai Di was warned by her mom. So even when she saw Da Qiao wearing a new dress and her eyes were red from jealousy, she didn't dare to find fault with Da Qiao.She rolled her eyes and set her target on little Yi Ming, who was on the side: \"Hey, little one over there, come here!\"Little Yi Ming glanced at her and made a face at her: \"Ugly, I don't want to play with you... la la la...\"Little Yi Ming still remembered that this person wrongly accused Elder Sister Nian Nian last time and her mom wanted to beat his Elder Sister Nian Nian. Hmph!Chen Lai Di was infuriated!Just as Qiao Hong Xia came over, she immediately complained.After hearing this, Qiao Hong Xia said while helping her son pull his clothes into place: \"Little Yi Ming, you can't name-call people, understand?\"Little Yi Ming's small eyes glared as he harrumphed: \"But she wrongly accused Sister Nian Nian last time!\"\"That's not a reason for you to name-call people. Your Elder Sister Nian Nian doesn't like children who name-call people!\"Qiao Hong Xia didn't like Chen Lai Di either. She was as petty-minded as like her mom, Qiao Hong Mei. Still, she didn't want her child to develop the habit of calling people names so casually.Hearing that Elder Sister Nian Nian didn't like it, Little Yi Ming finally compromised: \"I understand.\"Chen Lai Di appeared proud when little Yi Ming was told off by his mom.Who knew that as soon as Qiao Hong Xia walked away, little Yi Ming turned around and made a face at her again: \"Ugly, la la la...\"After little Yi Ming finished, he swung his short legs and ran away.Dare to wrongly accuse Elder Sister Nian Nian? Then he will still call her names next time!Chen Lai Di jumped in anger: \"Don't run away, little fool! See how I'll deal with you when I catch you!\"Da Qiao was pulled to the corner by Chen Zhao Di.Chen Zhao Di glanced around, found that there was no around, and whispered: \"Da Qiao, you are so blessed now. You get to eat meat every day and wear new clothes. Unlike me...\"As she spoke, she burst into tears.Last time, in order to save her mom, she rushed into the mosquito fog without hesitation. However, her mom didn't think she was filial. Instead, she called her stupid and made the family waste so much medical expenses.Da Qiao didn't know how to comfort her elder cousin sister.In the past, her mom didn't like her. Elder Cousin Sister Zhao Di wasn't loved by her mom either.When she came to Qiao's house before, Elder Cousin Sister Zhao Di would secretly help her with some housework. So she sympathized with Elder Cousin Sister Zhao Di.She was about to say that she would go back and get the candy she had saved, when she heard the other person speak, \"Da Qiao, you are doing so well now. Please help me on the sake that we were both pitiful people before!\"Da Qiao's hand was red from her grasp. \"Elder Cousin Sister Zhao Di, how do you want me to help you? I saved some candy. I'll give you all of it. Is that enough?\"\"Not enough.\" Chen Zhao Di shook her head with red eyes, \"Da Qiao, you have so many new clothes. Give me some. Before we came over, my mom ordered me to get new clothes from you. Otherwise, once we go back, she won't give me food...I really have no choice...\"\"Elder Cousin Sister, I'm sorry. I can't give you clothes.\" Da Qiao frowned.She can give her candy, or give her the one dime she had saved. However, her clothes were made by her family. She didn't want to give it to anyone!\"Da Qiao, how can you be like this? You were so pitiful before, and I help do chores for you! Now you've gotten better and don't want to help me. You... woo... want to watch me starve to death? Have pity on me!\"Chen Zhao Di was crying pitifully.If she had a little fairer skin and was prettier, she would have give a 'I'm pitiful'. Unfortunately, she wasn't pretty and her skin was a little tanned.Da Qiao had an unspeakable discomfort in her heart.She wanted to pull her hand back, but Chen Zhao Di held it tightly.\"What are you doing? Still, not letting go? Can't you see that Younger Sister Da Qiao's hands are grasped red by you?\"Qiao Dong Ying chewed pork balls in her mouth as she walked over with her pointed gaze.As soon as Chen Zhao Di saw Qiao Dong Ying, she trembled and let go of Da Qiao's hand subconsciously.Still, she sobbed: \"Elder Cousin Sister Dong Ying, I'm not bullying Da Qiao, I was forced by my mom. If I don't get new clothes from Da Qiao, she will really not give me food. Have pity on me!\"Qiao Dong Ying sneered: \"Just because you are pitiful, Da Qiao have to give you new clothes? Next time, if you say you are pitiful, do you want Qiao Family to give you everything? If not, we are bad guys, right?\"Chen Zhao Di shook her head with tears in her eyes: \"I didn't say it like that.\"\"But you think so!\" Qiao Dong Ying hit the nail on the head.Chen Zhao Di was indeed very pitiful, but pitiful people must have some dislikeable parts!She knew that her mom's request was wrong, but she never resisted. She used her pitiful aspect to force others!Everyone didn't see this side of her before and still sympathetically helped her a few times.But this person was heartless. She felt that she was pitiful, so everyone else should help her. She never knew how to be grateful.In the past, Grandmother felt she was pitifully. She helped speak for her a few times and bought her food and clothes. However, this person! With a turn of a head, she joined force with her mom and used this trick to deceive Grandmother!Therefore, no matter how pitiful such a person was, she wasn't worthy of sympathy!Qiao Dong Ying beckoned to Da Qiao: \"Da Qiao, come here. Ignore her. If she dare to pester you again, we'll tell Grandmother!\"Da Qiao glanced at Elder Cousin Sister Zhao Di. She took out two milk candies from her pocket and said, \"These candies are for you. I'm leaving.\"Chen Zhao Di looked at the milk candies in her hand. Thinking how she will be beaten by her mom when she went back, tears flowed again.She was so pitiful. Why can't they help her once?...After the banquet was over, the villagers gradually dispersed. Some women stayed behind to help clean up the dishes.After cleaning up, Qiao Xiu Zhi wasn't stingy and distributed the meal leftover to everyone and told them to take them back.Everyone grinned until one can only see their teeth and not their eyes. They all praised Qiao Xiu Zhi for knowing how to socialise.Qiao's old house had been noisy for a day. Now it was finally quiet.Qiao Hong Mei sat in the main room with her legs crossed. After eating, she had always been in this position. Treating herself as an honored guest and never thought of reaching out to help.Qiao Xiu Zhi walked in and stated with a cold face, \"The banquet is over, you can go!\"Qiao Hong Mei's face pulled down at once. She jumped up and said, \"Is there a mother like you?\"\"I, Qiao Xiu Zhi, have always been worthy of the word 'conscience'. I treat others how others treat me!\" Qiao Xiu Zhi indifferently responded.A family of five people came over to eat and take. And she didn't even bring back a fart!This can be dropped. On such day, everyone in the family was so busy. While she didn't want to help at all. Did she really think she was an emperor?Qiao Hong Mei was so angry that her whole face turned red!She took a deep breath and spoke, \"Mom, I'm not here to quarrel with you this time. I want to borrow some money from you. The state-run hotel is going to raise funds to build a housing. We are short some money.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi asked, \"Then how much do you want to borrow?\"Qiao Hong Mei thought that her mom agreed and her face instantly became better: \"Not much, just... three hundred yuan. We will definitely pay this money back!\"Her man only asked her to come back with 200 yuan. However, her mom's attitude was so abhorrent. So when the words came out of her lips, she changed it to 300 yuan.As for repaying the money, that was impossible. It will be impossible in this life.Qiao Xiu Zhi laughed: \"You don't look very pretty, but you think too prettily! Don't say three hundred yuan, there's not even three yuan. Take your children and leave now!\"\"Mom!\" Qiao Hong Mei was so furious that her face turned red and white. Her chest heaved heavily.Qiao Xiu Zhi said: \"You have known my character very well since you were a child. If I say no, it means no. You'd better leave now, or else you'll be driven out later. Then it will be ugly!\"After speaking, she turned around and walked out of the main room.If other people saw the mother and daughter made such a fuss, their eyes and jaws would fall to the ground.In the past, Qiao Xiu Zhi wanted to correct this daughter. But at the beginning, in order to get married, Qiao Hong Mei mentioned everywhere about her parent's biased. Later, for the dowry of 200 yuan, she would put up an act of committing suicide at home every day.At that time, Xue Chuan happened to be in poor health. For this daughter, he was so infuriated that he couldn't get out of bed.For the peace of the family, Qiao Xiu Zhi gritted her teeth and gave her a dowry of 200 yuan and sent her out of the house.Less than three months later, Xue Chuan was suddenly seriously ill and went to the hospital. The family had little savings. She asked old Fifth to borrow money from Qiao Hong Mei. At that time, Qiao Hong Mei said that she had no money and in the end she didn't give a penny!From that time on, she gave up on this daughter!Watching the decisive, departing back of her mom, Qiao Hong Mei was so mad that she wanted to kill!B*tch! B*tch! B*tch!Dare to treat her like this? It's best for them to not to let her catch weakness, otherwise don't blame her for killing her relatives for righteous!Once again, Qiao Hong Mei jumped up and left Qiao's old house with a dark face.Halfway on the road, she saw a little sedan car approaching as it head for Qili Village.She was very curious. Someone who can afford to drive such a car must have a not-so-simple identity.Just who in Qili Village have such relatives?She thought about it for a long time, but couldn't think of a reason.The car drove away into the distance. She was looking back while walking, when Chen Zhao Di's voice suddenly reached her ear: \"Mom, watch your feet!\"Sadly, it was too late!She stepped on the air with one foot and her whole body was flew toward the ground: \"Aiya, f*ck!\"\"BOOM!\"Her face hit the ground heavily. The bridge of her nose was almost broken. The pain made her cry on the spot.She propped up and sat up. Chen Zhao Di and the others called out: \"Mom, you're bleeding!\"She reached out and touched it. Suddenly a sound of pig slaughter rang out!The car drove into Qili Village .The villagers' eyes widened.The window of the car rolled down and someone asked the passerby, \"Excuse me, how do you get to Qiao's house?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After gawking for a long time, he pointed in the direction of Qiao's house and answered, \"Over, over there.\"Can't blame him for being excited!For the first time in his life, he saw a car. And it was the first time he talked to a person driving in a car!He can boast about it for a lifetime!The driver saw that what he said was unclear and was about to ask another person when he saw the villager being pushed away by his wife!The tanned face woman smiled like a chrysanthemum flower and spoke, \"I know where Qiao's house is. I'll take you there!\"After the car left, the villagers got into a round of discussion.\"Those who can drive a car aren't ordinary people at first glance!\"\"That's right. What do you think they went to Qiao's house for? Could it be that Qiao Family is in trouble again?\"\"It's hard to say. Wasn't old Fifth Qiao's daughter lost some time ago? They haven't found her yet. Maybe it has something to do with that!\"\"Hey, if one get lost these days, they'll are basically gone. Can't be found back! Old Fifth Qiao and his wife are pitiful. After so many years of marriage, they only have such a daughter, and she's lost. Oh, so pitiful!\"Pitiful my ass!Xing Hua hid behind a big tree and spat on the ground when she heard everyone's discussion!If Qiao Zhen Min had married her back then, she would have given birth to a lot of sons. How could he have only one daughter like now?And if he marry her, the child will never be lost!So if Qiao Zhen Min got to blame someone, he should blame his mom. If it weren't for his mom, he would be surrounded by children by now!Xing Hua glanced in the direction of the car. She turned and ran towards Wang's house.She had to tell Xiao Juan. Qiao Family will soon be in bad luck again!The car stopped when it reached Qiao's old house.The woman pointed at Qiao's old house and smiled: \"This is Qiao's house! By the way, did you come to Qiao's house...?\"\"We came to Qiao's house as a guest.\" The driver politely replied and said nothing else.The woman's eyes spun. She cleared her throat and shouted inside: \"Auntie Xiu Zhi, your family has relatives visiting! Big officials relatives!\"Wan Chun Ju was nibbling on melon seeds as she lounged around with crossed legs in the yard. Hearing this, she almost choked to death by the melon seeds!Big official relatives?When did Qiao Family have big official relatives?Still, she stood up immediately and ran towards the door quickly. Not at all like someone who was three or four months pregnant!When she came to the door, she saw a car parked in front of the door. She was so excited that her breath almost didn't come up: \"This... this sir, I am part of Qiao Family. Are you looking for me?\"The driver smiled at her, turned around, and opened the back door of the car. A little boy jumped out of it.Then two young women and a tall and heroic man appeared.Although the man was good-looking and respectful, he was upright and serious. It made people afraid to casually approach him.When Wan Chun Ju saw the driver, she was still able to gather around. But when she saw the man, her neck shrank. She didn't dare to let out a fart.At this moment, Da Qiao hummed a little song and skipped over.The little boy saw Da Qiao. His eyes lit up and he ran towards her: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, I'm here to play with you!\"Da Qiao took a closer look and quickly recognized that the other party as Younger Brother Tian You who was rescued by her grandmother in town last time.She ran over quickly, raised her head and sweetly greeted, \"Uncle Shen, Auntie Shen, Younger Brother Tian You, how are you!\"\"Da Qiao, I haven't seen you for a long time. I didn't expect you to remember me. I'm so happy!\"The last time Shen Lin Lin met Da Qiao, she really liked this little girl who was fair and tender and soft-spoken. Now, seeing her smiling sweetly with two small dimple, she was instantly punched by adorableness.Da Qiao's long eyelashes fanned like two small fans. She sweetly replied, \"Auntie Shen is so beautiful, how could I forget?\"Aiya, this little mouth was sweet!Shen Lin Lin wished to take this little girl home!On the side, Qin Xiao Mei watched with heated eyes.She used to desire having a little girl very much, but unfortunately her body wasn't up for it. After giving birth to Tian You, she spent half of the year lying on the bed.The doctor had clearly told them husband and wife that her body wasn't suitable for pregnancy and once she become pregnant, it will very likely one body, two death!Therefore, she would never have a caring\u00a0little padded jacket\u00a0in her life. Now, seeing the little girl in front of her with fair skin, a blushing red mouth, and a soft and sweet voice, her heart was overfilled with love.She walked over, squatted down and said softly, \"Are you Da Qiao? Hello, I'm Tian You's Mom. You can call me Auntie Qin.\"\"Hello, Auntie Qin, my name is Qiao Nian Nian. Everyone in my family calls me Da Qiao. You can also call me that.\" Da Qiao wasn't afraid of stranger at all. She introduced herself politely.Wan Chun Ju beckoned to Da Qiao in a hushed voice, but unfortunately Da Qiao didn't see her action. It made her pissed off.Qiao Xiu Zhi heard the movement and came out. She saw that it was Shen Family and was slightly stunned: \"It's you. Come in quickly.\"Before when Shen Family said they wanted to come, she didn't take it seriously. Later, when Shen family didn't come, she didn't take it to heart.On that day, when Shen Shi Kai returned home, he listened to his younger sister Lin Lin's description of what happened at that time. He was full of curiosity about this powerful madam.Seeing her unflappable attitude at this moment, he have a little more admiration in his heart.Qiao Xiu Zhi welcomed the group into the main room and called Xue Chuan to receive the guests together.Shen Shi Kai came to a halt when he saw Xue Chuan.Although the man in front of him reached old age and dressed as a peasant, his temperament was completely different from that of ordinary peasants.Qiao Family was really hiding dragons and crouching tigers. He became even more curious about Qiao Family.After the greeting, Shen Shi Kai explained: \"I'm thankful for Auntie for what happened with my son last time! We should have come over earlier to thank in person. My dad was sick and hospitalized as well as new tasks in the station. That's why it was delayed until today. Forgive me!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi told the other party not to mind. Then little Wan'er's matter suddenly cross her mind and her eyes flashed.She really wanted to ask the other party for help, but they weren't familiar with each other. The other party had just come to the door. It seem a little too rude to ask the other party to do things.Shen Shi Kai noticed she was hesitating to speak and opened her mouth, \"Auntie Qiao, do you have some difficulty? If I can help, please feel free to speak!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi pondered about it and finally decided to say, \"There is a problem! I have a little granddaughter who was lost at the county railway station more than a month ago. Her whereabouts are still unknown. I wonder if you can help me inquire around?\"Qin Xiao Mei frowned when she heard that a child was lost: \"Shi Kai, you should agree to it.\"As a mother, the thing she can't stand to see the most was the separation of flesh and blood. If her Tian You was lost, she will cry to death!Shen Shi Kai thought for a while and spoke, \"Auntie Qiao, let me be honest with you about this. There are so many people out there and it's been so long. I can't guarantee that I'll be able to find her, but I'll take on this matter!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi gratefully said: \"With your words, it's enough! The rest is up to destiny. Whether she can be found depends on the child's fate!\"Shen Shi Kai was the deputy chief of the police station. With his connections, he must have more ways and channels to find someone than ordinary people like them!After Qiao Zhen Min knew Shen Shi Kai's identity and heard that the other party was willing to lend a helping hand, his eyes were red with agitation: \"Thank you! Thank you very much!\"Shen Shi Kai waved his hands and merrily replied, \"This is also the fate of our two families. If Auntie Qiao hadn't rescued our child, we wouldn't have a chance to stand here now!\"He knew more than anyone how important a child was to a family. That's why he knew very well how heartbroken the dad in front of him was.So he will do his best to help!In the yard.Da Qiao and Shen Tian You sat in a row on the stone bench.Shen Tian You spoke: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, I wanted to come and play with you before, but my grandfather was sick and I can't come alone!\"Da Qiao said softly: \"It's okay. I don't blame you. Is your grandfather feeling better now?\"Shen Tian You frowned and answered, \"He have been discharged from the hospital, but my grandfather's health is still not very good!\"Wan Chun Ju came over. Her face was like a blooming chrysanthemum flower: \"Little Young Master, I am the daughter-in-law of the Granny Qiao who saved you. I have candied fruit in my room. Come with me. Do you want me to eat candy?\"She hid under the window just now. She already knew the identity of the family.Unexpectedly, the man just now was the deputy chief of the town police station. The little boy in front of her was the only son of the deputy chief!Da Qiao was a sly child. She didn't tell her such important information!She can't let this young master only play with Da Qiao. That's why, she must lead the child away and get him play with An Ping and be friends together!Shen Tian You looked at the big pancake face that pushed into sight and said with some disgust: \"I don't want to eat candy. I have a lot of candy at home. By the way, Elder Sister Da Qiao, what candy do you like to eat. My mom brought a lot of candy. It's all for you to eat!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"How vexing!Everything was for Da Qiao! Better to give to Qiao Family, no?\"Little Younger Master, do you want to look at the hen? My family hen can lay three or four eggs a day. You must have never seen this. Can I take you there?\"Wan Chun Ju still didn't want to give up.Shen Tian You's brows frowned into two caterpillars: \"No! What's so good about a hen? If a hen poops, it stinks as hell!\"Wan Chun Ju called him a brat in her heart!Just when she was still trying to make persistent efforts, Qiao Dong Ying came over: \"Mom, can you not let the word Little Young Master run off your mouth? Qing Dynasty had been extinct for a long time. Now it is new China. There is no young master!\"Wan Chun Ju gritted her teeth in fury when her daughter had demolished her platform as soon as she appeared: \"Damn girl, there is no place for you to talk here. Hurry up and find your younger brother back!\"Qiao Dong Ying lazily glanced at her mom and replied, \"Mom, if you don't leave, I'll tell my dad that you hid private fund!\"Wan Chun Ju widened her eyes: \"...How, how did you know?\"Qiao Dong Ying crossed her arms: \"You don't need to worry about how I know. Why don't you hurry up and hide your private fund to somewhere else?\"When Wan Chun Ju heard this, she turned around and ran frantically towards the kitchen as if her butt was on fire!Shen Tian You looked at her with admiration: \"Little Elder Sister, you are amazing!\"Qiao Dong Ying: \"Don't call me little Elder Sister, call me Elder Sister Ying!\"\"Elder Sister Ying!\" Shen Tian You obediently greeted and ran up to say, \"Elder Sister Ying, can I be your little follower?\"Qiao Dong Ying glanced at him and said with some disdain: \"Although you are a little younger and fatter, you can barely pass the test. Alright then, from today, you are I, Elder Sister Ying's little follower!\"\"Great. From today onwards, I will be Elder Sister Ying's little follower!\" Shen Tian You exclaimed wildly with joy.Da Qiao was stunned: \"...\"When Shen Shi Kai left, he took little Wan'er's portrait and said that he would contact them as soon as there was news.Qiao Family watched Shen Family leave and didn't go back until the car was nowhere to be seen. There was a little more hope in their hearts. Hope that there would be news of little Wan'er soon.When the villagers saw that the car was gone, they immediately came to inquire for info.Qiao Xiu Zhi was reluctant to say more. While Wan Chun Ju couldn't hold back. She immediately turned the whole gossip gathering into her main event. Almost\u00a0blowing the cows\u00a0to the sky!\"Oh, you don't know, the deputy chief's little young master is very polite. He kept calling Auntie Chun Ju. This call make my heart soften!\"\"Deputy chief is very courteous. He bought a lot of candied fruit, biscuits, malted milk powder, and canned fruits. There's also lot of pork. How can you finish eating so many things?\"\"Deputy chief's wife was very chat with. She had been holding my hand and saying that she's very grateful to our Qiao family for saving her son. If there is anything in the future, feel free to ask them for help!\"After listening to Wan Chun Ju's words, everyone was extremely envious!What kind of luck was this? To actually save Deputy Chief's son! Won't they be\u00a0the chicken and dog who become immortal\u00a0in the future?It seems that they can't offend Qiao Family in the future. Not only can they not offend, but they have to become good friends with them!Fang Xiao Juan was in a merry mood since Xing Hua told her that Qiao Family was going to suffer bad luck.After a good night's sleep, she decided to go out and find out what happened to Qiao family.Unexpectedly, after inquiring, she almost vomited blood!Not only did Qiao Family not suffer from bad luck, but instead, they got connection with high officials!Qiao Xiu Zhi actually saved the deputy chief's son. Why was she so lucky?So infuriating!Xiao Qiao frowned when she found out that Qiao Family had a relationship with the deputy director.This was not right!Wasn't Da Qiao's system supposed to snatch luck?Why wasn't Qiao Xiu Zhi's luck stolen? She could actually save the deputy chief's son?Xiao Qiao was puzzled!Back at Shen's house, Qin Xiao Mei spoke to her husband, \"I like Da Qiao so much. I want to recognize her as my goddaughter. What do you think?\"Shen Shi Kai was stunned for a moment. Then nodded and said, \"As long as you like it.\"He knew that his wife had always wanted a little daughter, but her body didn't allow it.It was rare that she liked a child so much now. Why would he stop her?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This made him admire Qiao Family even more.And it can be seen that Da Qiao was very favored by her grandparents. The other party may not be willing to let her be their goddaughter!Qin Xiao Mei rolled her eyes at her husband and said, \"I'll naturally know this. Do you think I'm the kind of person who bullies others with power?\"This gaze was so charming, Shen Shi Kai's heart moved, hugged his wife, lowered his head, and kissed her neck.Qin Xiao Mei pushed him and angrily puffed, \"What are you doing? The child is still outside!\"Tian You had the habit of rampaging around. It would be bad if he crashed in and saw them like this!Shen Shi Kai laughed in a low voice: \"Then tonight is alright?\"Qin Xiao Mei rolled her eyes at him again, bit her lip, and said nothing.At this time, Shen Tian You was writing his diary in the living room.On March 28, 1973, the weather was fine and windy.Today I went to Qiao's house with my parents and Aunt. Elder Sister Da Qiao still remember me. I am so happy! Today, I became...\"Grandmother, how do you write the word eagle in old eagle?\" Shen Tian You scratched his head and shouted loudly.Old Madam Shen came out from the kitchen with a bowl of egg stewed in black sesame sugar soup: \"Old eagle. Grandmother will write it for you.\"Old Madam Shen put the sugar soup in front of her precious grandson and then wrote eagle character on the book.Shen Tian You frowned when he saw that there were so many strokes in this word. After thinking about it, he still traced it.\"I became Elder Sister\u00a0Eagle\u00a0's follower today. Elder Sister\u00a0Eagle\u00a0is worthy of being the elder sister of old eagle. Simply too awesome. She scared her mom away in one move. I like Elder Sister\u00a0Eagle\u00a0so much. I want to be Elder Sister\u00a0Eagle's follower for a\u00a0quilt\u00a0!\"Years later, when Da Qiao saw this diary, she couldn't straighten her waist from the laughter....Qiao's small house.Little Dong Lin looked at little Yi Ming. His little face was full of pride: \"Elder Sister Nian Nian promised to sleep with me tonight!\"Little Yi Ming immediately stretched out his paws: \"No. Elder Sister Qiao Qiao can't sleep with you. She can only sleep with little Yi Ming!\"Little Dong Lin instantly became unhappy: \"Why not? Elder Sister Qiao Qiao is little Dong Lin's elder sister. We can sleep together!\"As soon as little Dong Lin became anxious, even his way of addressing had be lead astray.Little Yi Ming's small eyes glared as he put his hands on his hips: \"It just won't do! Elder Sister Qiao Qiao belongs to me alone!\"Little Dong Lin's face flushed red: \"You are talking nonsense. Elder Sister Qiao Qiao belongs to little Dong Lin. Not yours alone!\"\"I'm not talking nonsense. She's mine!\"\"Mine!\"\"Mine! Mine!\"The two little dumplings quarreled until their faces flushed. They were glaring at each other. War was on the verge of breaking out.Just then, Da Qiao came in.She was holding a plate in her hand. On it, was three bowls of egg drop water on it. She said softly, \"You guys are misbehaving. Why are you arguing again?\"Little Dong Lin and little Yi Ming changed their faces in a second. They ran over with a thump thump thump and surrounded her like two small tails.\"Elder Sister Qiao Qiao, I'm behaving. I didn't quarrel.\" Little Yi Ming's little spirited eyes popped out.Little Dong Lin also quickly defended himself: \"Elder Sister Nian Nian, little Dong Lin wants to sleep with you. He said that Elder Sister Nian Nian belongs to him alone. Little Dong Lin can't accept this!\"The two younger brothers were very cute. She liked them very much. But as soon as the two meet, they were\u00a0like a pin against an awl\u00a0. Always fighting for favor in front of her.Da Qiao sighed. Remarking that being too popular was also a burden.Qiao Hong Xia walked in, pinched her son's little nose and spoke, \"You are younger than Elder Brother Dong Lin. You can't be rude, understand?\"Little Yi Ming nodded obediently: \"I understand, Mom.\"Later, what should be fought was still needed to be fought!Qiao Hong Xia looked at the three little dumplings and jollily pointed out: \"You two. One calls Elder Sister Nian Nian and the other call Elder Sister Qiao Qiao. You are making a mess of the addressing. How about we all call Elder Sister Da Qiao?\"Da Qiao tilted her head and pondered for a while. Then she smilingly replied, \"I think this can work.\"The two younger brothers each have their own way of addressing. She was also a little confused.Both little Dong Lin and little Yi Ming pouted. They were very reluctant.But Elder Sister Nian Nian/ Qiao Qiao spoke up. They could only agree.Qiao Hong Xia couldn't help laughing when she saw that the two of them pouting so much that one could hang oil bottles with their mouths: \"Also, you are boys. You can't sleep with your Elder Sister Da Qiao. However, the two of you can sleep together.\"\"Don't want!\"Two baby voices sounded at the same time.After they finished speaking, they glared at each other again.Qiao Hong Xia ignored the two little things' objections. In the end, they didn't get to sleep with Da Qiao.Da Qiao was already seven years old. It would be fine if the two of them were her own younger brothers, but one was just a cousin and the other was a younger brother brought over by her stepmom. They had no blood relationship. So it would be better to be cautious.It would be bad if some rotten mouth people use this to attack Da Qiao.In the end, little Dong Lin slept with little Yi Ming.In order to show their dislike of each other, the two little guys insisted on sleeping on separate end.After arranging the few children, Qiao Hong Xia went to sleep at ease.Before returning to her room, she glanced at her second elder brother's bridal room. When bitterness finished, sweetness begins. She was happy for her second elder brother!In the room, Lin Hui had already changed and washed up.She was sitting in front of the dresser, combing her hair with a wooden comb in her hand. She kept glancing at the door as she combed.A squeak rang out.The door was opened and Qiao Zhen Jun walked in slowly.Lin Hui's cheeks inflamed and she lowered her eyes. She pretended to concentrate on combing her hair while her heart felt like it contained a little rabbit.\u00a0Thump thump thump,\u00a0it quickly jumped.Qiao Zhen Jun was also nervous. His fists clenched and loosened.He looked at Lin Hui's slender back. His heart was on fire.This feeling was completely different from when she married Fang Xiao Juan.He agreed to marry Fang Xiao Juan for the sake of his responsibility and a human life. He didn't have any feelings for Fang Xiao Juan. Instead, at that time, he was very depressed because he couldn't marry the girl he liked.The bridal night between him and Fang Xiao Juan wasn't really that wonderful.He had something on his mind, while Fang Xiao Juan had been complaining that the banquet wasn't well organized and that his mom was targeting her. All night, it was just her non-stop chatter.He didn't answer, so she called him dull. She scolded until he became angry in the end. He slammed the door, headed out of the bridal room, and went to the firewood room to spend the night.Now that he think about it, he and Fang Xiao Juan should never have been married.\"What are you thinking?\" Lin Hui noticed that there was no movement behind her. She couldn't help but turn around to take a peek and discovered that he was in a daze.Qiao Zhen Jun came back to his senses. Slightly guilty, he didn't dare to look into her eyes: \"No, I didn't think anything. It's getting late. We...\"Reaching to this part, his face turned red in a swoop. Even the tips of his ears were glowing pig blood red under the candlelight.Lin Hui was nervous at the beginning. But now she saw him like this, she couldn't help chuckling: \"Why is your face so red?\"Just like monkey butt!Qiao Zhen Jun scratched his forehead and embarrassedly responded, \"I, aren't I feeling shy?\"Saying that, he walked over. He summoned up the courage to grasped her hand and spoke, \"I know I'm not a capable man, but I will definitely work hard so that you and the children can have a good life!\"Lin Hui felt her eyes heat up and her nose was a little sour like she was close to tears: \"Okay. I remember what you said. If you can't fulfill it, I won't forgive you!\"She had waited too long for this day!Originally, when she was eighteen years old, she should have married him as his wife. Out of mishap, he married Fang Xiao Juan and she married Educated Youth Qin.She thought that they would never interact again in this life, but fate always have unexpected turns and give people the biggest surprise!She was overjoyed to marry him!\"I will be a good wife and treat Da Qiao as my own daughter.\"He made a promise. Lin Hui felt that she should also say something.Qiao Zhen Jun didn't doubt her words at all.At this moment, there was a \"puff\" sound outside the window, followed by some noise.Qiao Zhen Jun's expression changed and he uttered loudly, \"Who is outside?\"\"Damn it, favus-riddled Gou Sheng! Why did you fart at this time!\"\"That's right. It's f*cking stinks. Do you want to stink everyone to death?\"\"You guys are so funny. What is it called a stinky fart if it doesn't stink?\" Favus-riddled Gou Sheng retorted.Qiao Zhen Jun's face flushed again. He told Lin Hui, \"I'll drive them away!\"Truly careless. He didn't expect that today when he got married for the second time, this group of people still came to eavesdrop!As soon as he went out, the people outside dispersed in a rush.\"Old Second Qiao, what's the matter with you? Back then, you went to sleep in the woodshed on your wedding night. Now you remarry and not getting to it. It can't be can do it, right?\"No matter how good-tempered Qiao Zhen Jun was, he was immediately angry when this aspect was questioned: \"Get out of here!\"A group of young people laughed as they noisily walked away.Qiao Zhen Jun then went back to his room and saw Lin Hui staring at him blankly.He said with a hot face: \"I, I have no problem in that area.\"With a \"boom\", Lin Hui's cheeks were hot enough to fry an egg. She gave him a pointed look and said, \"Who asked you this?\"The more he looked at the beauty under the lamp, the more beautiful she was.Lin Hui Yuan was a beauty. Right now, her cheeks were blushing with shy beauty. It made Qiao Zhen Jun's heart burn.He walked over, held her hand again and said, \"Let's rest.\"Lin Hui bit her lower lip and whispered \"en\".The oil lamp was blown out and the big bed noisily rang in the room.The moon outside hid shyly behind the clouds....Although Shen Family promised to help find little Wan'er's whereabouts, Qiao family couldn't pin all their hopes on the other party.After Qiao Zhen Jun's wedding, Qiao Zhen Min was ready to set off again to find his daughter's whereabouts.This time, Qiao Zhen Guo went out with him.After work that day, Qiao Zhen Guo went to ask the production team leader for leave. He asked him to write two letters of introduction. Afterward, he went home for dinner with the letters of introduction.Who knew, halfway through, he encountered a strange person.He went to the left, the other party also went to the left. He went to the right, and the other party went to the right. After a few times, he still couldn't leave!He looked at the woman in front of him and spoke, \"This miss, which way are you going? I'll stand still and you go first!\"This person! He had to rush home for dinner!Da Zhi bit her lower lip lightly, raised her head slightly, and gave him a pointed gaze: \"Elder Brother Qiao, don't you remember me?\"This \"Elder Brother Qiao\" was said so coquettishly and charmingly that it made people's bones almost melt.It was a pity that the person standing in front of her was Qiao Zhen Guo, a hard-core steel straight man. No matter how charming she was, she wasn't as attractive as a piece of mantou!Qiao Zhen Guo eyed at her and pondered for a moment before answering, \"I don't remember!\"Da Zhi sighed in her heart: \"Elder Brother Qiao is really a noble person who forgets things. More than a month ago, you and the production team leader went to pick up the educated youth. I was sitting next to you at that time. Think again, do you have any impression?\"Qiao Zhen Guo looked at the sky as thought. Suddenly he slapped his forehead and replied, \"I remember!\"Da Zhi looked at him expectantly.She knew that she was so pretty that as long as men saw her once, they wouldn't easily forget her!Qiao Zhen Guo laughed: \"I remembered, you are Miss Blacksmith. I even saw your booger!\"Da Zhi: \"...\"Can you stop talking about booger!Da Zhi was close to pulling her hair out!She managed to hypnotize herself to forget about this matter. Why did this person mention it again when they met?Also, what the hell with the 'Miss Blacksmith'?As she spoke, she asked her own doubts: \"Elder Brother Qiao, why did you call me Miss Blacksmith?\"No one in her family's eighteen generation of ancestors could strike iron. So why did he give her such a strange name?Qiao Zhen Guo paused for a moment and answered, \"Aren't your surname Da? And your name Tie? Together, it's Blacksmith! Hahaha, your parents are really strange. How could they give you such a funny name. Hahaha...\"Da Zhi: \"...\"Why did she feel like a dog in her heart?She took a deep breath and said, \"Elder Brother Qiao, you probably misread the character. My name is Da Zhi. Zhi from the word order. Not Tie.\"Qiao Zhen Guo was stunned for a second. Then he jollily continued: \"It turns out to be Zhi from order. I was saying, why would there be a girl called Blacksmith? Alright, I'm leaving.\"After he finished speaking, he passed her and left.Da Zhi: \"...\"What kind of man was this...?Da Zhi had some doubts in her heart whether it was wrong to look for him!But with so many men in the village, she had no other choice.Da Zhi firmed up her heart, and trotted after him: \"Elder Brother Qiao, wait for me. I have something to tell you!\"However, Qiao Zhen Guo walked very fast, as if a ghost was chasing behind him.Da Zhi had no choice but to tilt her body and trying to pretend to fall to attract his attention. However, the tilting force was too strong and her foothold was unstable. Her whole body instantly lost her balance.A loud \"bang\" rang out!She fell\u00a0like a dog eating poo\u00a0!Not only did she eat a mouthful of soil, there was also pain in her palms and knees. The pain made her cry!When Qiao Zhen Guo heard the movement, he turned around in time to see how she fell. He laughed like a dog at once: \"Hahaha, you fell flat on your face. My stomach hurts from laughing!\"Da Zhi: \"...\"She got up from the ground with red eyes, turned around and walked away.Sorry for the disturbance!See you later!No, never see you again!When Qiao Zhen Guo saw that the other party was gone, he quickly dashed.If he didn't hurry back, the meat will definitely be eaten up by his wife!When chatting after dinner, Qiao Zhen Guo told everyone about Da Zhi's fall: \"You didn't see it. She fell flat on her face. It was so funny! Also, I thought she was called Blacksmith, but her name is Da Zhi. Hahaha, I felt the name Blacksmith is easier to remember?\"Everyone: \"...\"Wan Chun Ju smelled something out: \"Zhen Guo, what did you just say? She called you Elder Brother Qiao?\"Qiao Zhen Guo nodded: \"Yes. Is there any problem?\"He wasn't old. If not Elder Brother Qiao, should she call him Uncle Qiao?Wan Chun Ju gritted her teeth, and uttered 'vixen' in her heart: \"Zhen Guo, that's an indecent woman. If you see her in the future, stay away from her!\"Vixen, dare to seduce her man. See how she'll clean her up!Qiao Xiu Zhi raised her eyes and looked at her: \"The other party didn't do anything. Think about your husband's reputation. You'd better not do anything. Otherwise, if something happens later, don't come to me when you can't solve it yourself!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi saw through what Wan Chun Ju wanted to do at a glance.That female educated youth named Da Zhi certainly had improper thoughts. If it were a different man, he might already be hooked in by her.It was a pity that she met a fool like Qiao Zhen Guo, so nothing happened. Instead, she embarrassed herself.If there was no more follow-up, it'll end like that. Qiao Xiu Zhi thought this was the best thing to do.Otherwise, if the rumor goes out, Qiao Zhen Guo's reputation will turn bad.Wan Chun Ju gritted her teeth in anger.She had to admit that what her mother-in-law said made sense.But letting that female educated youth go like this?That was impossible. Not happening in this life!A few days later, Wan Chun Ju headed out when she was idle. From time to time she loitered around the educated youth center.After wandering around for a few days, she finally caught Da Zhi alone one day.She immediately rushed over like a wild boar, raised her foot, and kicked Da Zhi down. Then she covered the opponent's eyes with the black cloth, which was prepared in advance, and arched her left and right with strength.Slap Slap Slap!\"Ahhhh...\"Da Zhi screamed like a madman!\"Who are you? Let me go... Ahh... I'm going to report you to the production leader!\"Report her?Slap slap slap!Then a few more slaps!Vixen!B*tch!Dare to seduce a married person! This is the result!Da Zhi was so angry that her blood was surging. Her breath also didn't come out. She fainted out of anger!Wan Chun Ju saw that the other party was not moving and reached out to probe the other party's nose...No, no breath!The other party was dead, dead!Wan Chun Ju's face turned pale with fright.She killed someone!She stood up, turned and ran frantically towards the house.After returning home, she locked herself in the room, shrank in the quilt, and shivered.The sky was getting dark. Ye Zhen Zhen was a little worried when she noticed that Da Zhi had gone out for a long time and hadn't come back.She called another female educated youth named Chang Xiao Ru to accompany her to go out to find her.The two searched almost the entire village before they found Da Zhi in the grass halfway up the mountain.The two of them saw that Da Zhi fainted in the grass. The sight of her red and swollen face made their face turned pale with fright.The two of them thought of one thing at the same time: Looking like this, could it be that Da Zhi was raped by someone?The damage on her face were probably beaten by the other party due to resisting!Don't know if the other party succeeded or not. But looking at Da Zhi's messy clothes, the two guessed that this matter doesn't seem so good.If Da Zhi got raped, then this matter wasn't a trivial matter. It should be reported to the production team leader immediately.However, the two girls hesitated.Once the production leader know, won't this matter spread out?At that time, the entire production team will know what happened to Da Zhi. How can she survive in the future?Ye Zhen Zhen spoke: \"How about not reporting it to the production leader?\"Chang Xiao Ru shook her head with a serious face: \"No, if you don't report it to the production leader, you'll be condoning rape and more girls will suffer misfortune in the future. You and I may meet that person. It'll be too late to regret it later!\"\"Besides, if you don't report to the production leader and something happens to Da Zhi, can you afford the responsibility? If you're willing to take the responsibility, then I can pretend that I don't know anything!\"How could Ye Zhen Zhen be willing to take on such a responsibility!So the two hurried to report to the production leader.When Wang Shui Sheng heard that a female educated youth had been raped, his face was as black as a ditch!When the educated youth first went to the countryside, people in some places forced the female educated youth to get married. While some were unruly toward the female educated youth. One female educated youth couldn't bear it and committed suicide.Later, a document was issued, emphasizing the need to protect female educated youth.He was afraid of mishaps. Before the female educated youth came, he focused on warning the idlers and the male bachelors in the village not to do anything or they would be kicked out of the production team!For future prevention, he had built the educated youth center not far from the villagers. Unlike some production teams, where it was built in remote corners.Unexpectedly, it still happened!Why was he so unlucky?Because when Ye Zhen Zhen and Chang Xiao Ru came over, there were still other people present in the production office. After hearing their words, they immediately boiled over!The newest and the most beautiful female educated youth got raped?Who did this?Gosh, what a pity!Ah. Ruined! No matter how pretty she was, she was ruined!Wang Shui Sheng told them not to go out and talk nonsense. Then he followed the girls to go halfway up the mountain to find Da Zhi.Who would have thought that when he came to the middle of the mountain, Da Zhi was nowhere to be seen.Everyone's faces became ugly at once!Wang Shui Sheng imagined that the man came back and dragged Da Zhi away: \"Why didn't you leave someone to keep watch back then?\"Ye Zhen Zhen and Chang Xiao Ru looked at each other and lowered their heads.Under the circumstances at that time, they really should have left someone to stay back to take care of Da Zhi. However, they were afraid!If that man came back to look for Da Zhi, they would suffer as well. So the two pushed around and finally decided to leave Da Zhi alone, while the two of them went to the production team office together.Wang Shui Sheng could guessed their thoughts with his toes and uttered in exasperation, \"Why are you still standing there? Hurry up and find someone!\"Everyone hurriedly search everywhere. They searched the entire mountainside, but still no one was found!Seeing that it was completely dark, everyone had to stop the search.Ye Zhen Zhen and Chang Xiao Ru were exhausted and returned to the educated youth center. Only then, they saw Da Zhi sitting by the bed eating.Both of them were startled: \"Da Zhi, why are you here?\"Da Zzhi was taken aback by the two's reaction: \"Why can't I be here? By the way, I must tell, I was so unlucky. I was beaten by someone on the back mountainside just now. Although I didn't see anyone, but I can tell that the other party is a woman!\"It turned out that shortly after Ye Zhen Zhen and Chang Xiao Ru left, Da Zhi woke up and then returned to the educated youth center alone.After Ye Zhen Zhen and Chang Xiao Ru listened, they eyed at her suspiciously and said, \"Da Zhi, are you sure that person is a woman? Also, you weren't that by the other party?\"Seeing that the expressions on the two of them weren't quite right, Da Zhi immediately asked them what happened.When she learned that the two of them had misunderstood and reported it to the production leader, she was like struck by lightning.Without taking a breath, she fainted again.The next day, Da Zhi went over early in the morning to explain to the production team leader that she didn't get raped, but was assaulted!Wang Shui Sheng breathed a sigh of relief after knowing that she hadn't been that and stated that the person who attacked her would definitely be found.Still the others looked at her face and winked around. Not believing that she hadn't been that.In less than half a day, the entire production team knew that a female educated youth named Da Zhi had been raped.Da Zhi kept explaining to people, but no one believed it. She was so furious that she almost vomited blood!Wan Chun Ju was worried and frightened for two days. When she realized that no one was looking for her, her tail sprung up again.At home, Xiao Qiao had to feed chickens, collect firewood, do laundry, and cook as well as enduring her mom's temper from time to time. She expressed she couldn't take it anymore!After school that day, she saw Da Qiao standing alone at the school gate.Spinning her eyes, she strode over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She softly replied, \"I'm waiting for my elder cousins to go home together.\"She eyed Younger Sister as she spoke.In the past, she thought that Younger Sister was very pretty. Fair skin and big round eyes. When she wasn't smiling, she appeared well-behaved. When she smiled, it made people feel that she was very sweet.But now, that feeling seem to be gone.Younger Sister was wearing old clothes from last year. The clothes weren't clean. It can even considered to be dirty. Especially the cuffs, which were dark and hadn't been washed for a long time.Her face was no longer as rosy and tender as before. Instead, it was a little sallow. And there were actually dark circles under her eyes!What happened to Younger Sister?Xiao Qiao was certainly not living well!Not only did she have to attend school now, but every morning before dawn, she had to get up to make breakfast, sweep the floor, and feed the chickens. If she didn't do this, she can only go to school hungry.After returning from school, she still had no time off. She must continue to do housework. If she didn't do it, she could only wait to be scolded!Her mom said, if she didn't do housework, then don't go to school. Anyway, girls didn't need to read so many books. Sooner or later they will get married!She almost exploded when she heard it!She couldn't understand. Her mom used to treasure her, 'the child prodigy'. But now, even if she took the initiative to bring it up, her mom wouldn't take it seriously!Xiao Qiao didn't understand that child prodigy was just the icing on the cake. In the age when one can't get enough to eat, a child prodigy was just like a fart and can't play any role especially when it came to self interest!Unfortunately she didn't understand this.In her last life, when Xiao Qiao transmigrated over, she was only a fifteen or sixteen-year-old junior high school student. Although she lived to be in her thirties, she had been 'confined' in that fool's body for more than ten years. So whether it was her IQ or emotional intelligence, she didn't make any progress at all.On the contrary, because she couldn't communicate with anyone for more than ten years and she often had to face the fact that she was getting ridiculed by others. Her personality and psychology had already been distorted.\"Elder Sister, we haven't been together for a long time. Will you go back with me today?\"At this moment, Xiao Qiao looked at Da Qiao, who had red lips and white teeth and was dressed in new clothes. Her eyes were red with envy. Still, she had to try her best to pretend to be a close sister.Da Qiao glanced at her and shook her head without hesitation: \"No, I made arrangement with my cousins. If they don't see me, they will definitely be anxious!\"Though Xiao Qiao gritted her teeth in anger, she spoke with a smile on her face: \"There are a lot of wild fruits growing on the back mountain. While elder cousins haven't come back, why don't you go pick some with me, Elder Sister?\"There were indeed some wild fruits growing on the back mountain. However, the mountain road was rough and steep. Adults generally don't let children go there.She wanted to lead Da Qiao over and then take the opportunity to push her off the cliff. If there was no way, then she will use a stone to smash her to death!Every man for himself, and the devil takes the hindmost!Don't blame her for being cruel. There can only be one heroine in a book and that was her, Xiao Qiao!Da Qiao eyed her vigilantly and shook her head again: \"I'm not going!\"Xiao Qiao secretly gnashed her teeth as hate brewed in her heart: \"Elder Sister, you weren't like this before. I just want to stay with you for a while and you don't want to. Do you despise me, your younger sister so much?\"Da Qiao looked at her and replied, \"Younger Sister, I got a question to ask. When you told me to go to the West Wood with you to dig out the eggs, why did you disappear shortly after entering? Also, why didn't you tell everyone, I entered the West Wood?\"Back then, she fell into West Wood's trap because Younger Sister told her that her mom felt her mouth was bland and wanted to eat some bird eggs. If she could find some bird eggs and bring them back, her mom would definitely change her view of her.At that time, she didn't understand anything. She just wanted to please her mom. So when Xiao Qiao said that West Wood had bird eggs, she followed without thinking.Not long after she entered, she fell into the trap, while Xiao Qiao disappeared. By the time everyone found her, it was already half a day later.If Xiao Qiao went to the adults immediately, she wouldn't have been frozen to the point of breathlessness. Nor would she needed to be hospitalized. In this way, her dad wouldn't become paralyzed from saving her.Although her dad was now able to walk, the pain and despair he suffered during the process can't be written off in a stroke!She had never doubted Younger Sister before. After that incident, she still liked Younger Sister.But since she drank the melted jade bead water, her mind became more and more clear. She suddenly understood many things that she couldn't grasp before.Xiao Qiao's face instantly changed. Her palms were sweaty: \"Elder Sister, didn't I explain this to you at the time? I notice that you were gone, I thought you ran out. I was sad for a long time. Never thought that you fell into a trap. If I knew, I would have gone back and told Dad and Mom earlier!\"Da Qiao stared at her with a pair of dark eyes. The bottom of her eyes was clear and bright, as if she could see the bottom of people's hearts.Xiao Qiao got goosebump from her gaze. Her voice became sharp at once: \"Elder Sister, what are you doing? Are you doubting me? But why would I do that? What's good would it do for me if you have an accident?\"This was what Da Qiao couldn't understand.She and Xiao Qiao were twin sisters. She had doted Xiao Qiao a lot since young. They should have been the closest sisters. But now she thought about it, whenever she was with Younger Sister, she was always the one who gets scolded.This point was worrisome to her.And her grandmother had warned her before to stay away from Younger Sister. So even if Younger Sister's words reached wild exaggeration, she wouldn't go with her.Seeing that Da Qiao didn't speak, Xiao Qiao's hatred expanded within her!She was worried that Qiao Dong He and others were coming and she hadn't taken Da Qiao away. With a vicious gleam in her eyes, she reached out and grabbed Da Qiao's hand. She tried to pull her to the back mountain.However...Before her hand could touch Da Qiao, she was grasped by Da Qiao.Da Qiao pulled with force and twisted Xiao Qiao's arm behind her!Xiao Qiao screamed: \"Ah...it hurts so much. Elder Sister, it hurts so much. Can you let go...\u00a0sniff sniff...\"The passers-by didn't understand the situation. They only saw Da Qiao twisting Xiao Qiao's arm and assumed she was hitting and criticzed her.\"This classmate, let go! If you don't let go, I will report to it to the teacher!\"\"Isn't this the new transfer student? I thought she was cute. Didn't expect her to be so rude!\"\"I heard that girl call her Elder Sister just now. How she be like this? Bullying her own younger sister!\"\"Hey, isn't that the school's little prodigy Qiao Jiao Jiao?\"\"It's really her! This classmate, let go of Classmate Qiao or you see what'll happen!\"Facing everyone's accusations, Da Qiao felt aggrieved and let go of Younger Sister's hand.In fact, when she realized that Younger Sister was reaching to grabbing her, she subconsciously counter-react.She had pay attention though. That little strength wouldn't hurt anyone at all. She didn't understand why Younger Sister would scream like that.\"Elder Sister, I never thought of dirtying your new clothes. I really just wanted to stay with you for a while. I didn't expect you to hate me so much, sniff sniff...\"Xiao Qiao was internally smug to see everyone criticizing Da Qiao. While on the surface, she pretended to be a white lotus.After listening to Xiao Qiao's words, everyone noticed the two sisters' clothes.Da Qiao was wearing new clothes, which were clean and beautiful with flowers and small animals embroidered on them. Although Xiao Qiao had no patches, it was definitely not new. And it was a little dirty.At one glance, Xiao Qiao was the least favored of the two sisters at home.No one knew about their parents' divorce. Now that the little prodigy they admired was living so miserably at home, they felt even more injustice.\"How can an elder sister be like this? What's wrong with touching? Will you die?\"\"That's right. Nothing will happen just by touching! As elder sister, you dresses so beautifully. Wouldn't your conscience hurt when younger sister wears the old clothes you don't want?\"Da Qiao frowned as she looked at crying Younger Sister.She suddenly understood why her grandmother told her to stay away from Younger Sister!\"Don't scold my elder sister. I'm sure she didn't mean it.\" Xiao Qiao admired enough and pretended to generously help Da Qiao.Seeing her like this, everyone felt that she was beautiful and kind-hearted.\"Little prodigy, go back with us.\"\"Yeah. Don't be with your elder sister, lest she beat you again later!\"Xiao Qiao looked at these classmates and observed how decently dressed they were. So she nodded and said, \"Okay. But you don't call me little prodigy. Just call me Xiao Qiao or Jiao Jiao!\"\"Then let's call you Xiao Qiao.\"\"Okay!\"Xiao Qiao passed by Da Qiao proudly and pretended to bump into her unintentionally.Da Qiao didn't stand firmly and stumbled two steps back. Qiao Dong Ying, who was approaching, supported her.Qiao Dong Ying stared at Xiao Qiao's back. She rolled up her sleeves: \"Did that Xiao Qiao bully you again?\"Da Qiao didn't want to cause trouble. She shook her head and softly replied: \"No, she didn't bully me. She wanted to go back with me, but I didn't promise her.\"Anyway, she had clearly seen what kind of person Younger Sister was. She will stay away from her in the future.She didn't want to make things worse, because she didn't want her dad to be sad.The hand's palm and back were full of flesh. If she had a big conflict with Younger Sister, her dad will definitely be on the spot.Qiao Dong Ying pinched her fair and tender face and said, \"If she bullies you, you can't hold back. Understand?\"\"Understood, Elder Sister Ying.\" Da Qiao replied softly....On the way back, Xiao Qiao chatted happily with the few new classmates.She especially get along with a female classmate named Lin Bao Zhu.Lin Bao Zhu was the daughter of neighboring Hongtaiyang production leader. She was the only girl in the family, so she was very favored.More importantly, her mom was the deputy head of the community's women association and her third uncle was the mayor's secretary. She was a veritable official's second-generation!Xiao Qiao intended to curry favor with her and maintain a good relationship with her.Suddenly, a mad cow rushed out of nowhere and was charging toward the few children.The children were stunned. The few stood dumbfounded, while some cried.Xiao Qiao also turned pale with fright. However, she was very rational and quickly reacted. She pulled Lin Bao Zhu away and ran.Lin Bao Zhu was so frightened that her legs went weak. But when Xiao Qiao pulled her to run, she was very moved.But soon she couldn't be moved!Because something was up with that mad cow. It surpassed the dazed children and furiously chased them instead!Lin Bao Zhu was about to cry to death!She had never encountered such unfortunate things since she was young!Xiao Qiao was also frightened out of her wits. If she was hit by the mad cow, she would lose half of her life: \"Let's... let's run separately!\"By running separately, she had at least 50% chance of escaping. But for some reason, she had a bad premonition in her heart.Lin Bao Zhu nodded. The two let go of their hands and ran away in different directions.Then Lin Bao Zhu saw that the mad cow showed no hesitation at all and ran after Xiao Qiao, as if Xiao Qiao had killed its entire family!Xiao Qiao heard the sound of running behind her. Finally knew why she had an ominous premonition!She shouldn't have gone to Da Qiao. How did she forget that that person had a system to steal luck!In front, there was no road ahead. Only a stinky ditch. Between being charged at to death and jumping into the stinky ditch, Xiao Qiao heroically chose the latter.As soon as she jumped in, a foul stench hit her nostrils. She vomited on the spot!What made her even more devastated was that there were actually a lot of white maggots in the stinky ditch!\"Ugh\u2026\u2026\"The mad cow saw her jumping into the stinky ditch, but it didn't leave. Just wandered on the edge.Because there was a mad cow present, Xiao Qiao had to stay in the stinky ditch no matter how disgusting and intolerable it was!After half an hour, the mad cow finally left.Lin Bao Zhu and the others ran over. When they saw Xiao Qiao's appearance, they couldn't help but vomit.Da Qiao didn't know that Xiao Qiao's misfortune. Halfway home, she suddenly heard the sound of chickens calling.Immediately, she ran over, pushed aside the weeds, and saw two wild chickens squatting in the weeds!\"Elder Cousin Sisters, Elder Cousin Brother, there are chickens here!\"The three siblings ran over to take a look. Their eyes lit up at once!My, what plump chickens!An Ping moved quickly. He immediately took off his clothes, tied the mouth of the chicken with weeds, and then wrapped them with clothes: \"Go. Let's go home and eat chicken!\"They got back to Qiao's old house.Wan Chun Ju saw her son with his clothes off and immediately scolded: \"Dong He, Dong Ying, are you two dead? When you saw your younger brother take off his clothes, why didn't you tell him off? What if he freezes?\"Qiao Dong Ying rolled her eyes: \"A child got three fires their body, how can he freeze so easily? If you feel distressed, stay with An Ping in the future!\"Wan Chun Ju scolded: \"How dare you talk back!\"Qiao Dong Ying avoided her mom's hand: \"Mom, if you really hit me, don't think about eating the wild chicken tonight!\"Wan Chun Ju was stunned: \"What wild chicken?\"At this time, Qiao Xiu Zhi and the others came back from work.Da Qiao flew over. She raised her fair and tender face and softly spoke, \"Grandmother, Grandfather, we caught two wild chickens!\"An Ping quickly released the wild chickens from his clothes. The two wild chickens were suffocated all the way. Now their eyes rolled back.Wan Chun Ju saw the two fat wild chickens and her face instantly bloomed into a chrysanthemum flower: \"Oh my son is so lucky. He can casually catch wild chickens!\"Qiao Dong Ying corrected her: \"Da Qiao caught the wild chicken. If you have the guts, Mom, don't touch any of the chickens tonight!\"Wan Chun Ju was so steaming mad that she cursed and complained to Qiao Zhen Guo: \"Zhen Guo, look at your daughter. She is getting more and more lawless!\"Qiao Zhen Guo looked at his daughter proudly and said, \"Dong Ying, your temper is more and more like your grandmother. However, about the guts you said just now, your mom doesn't have any.\"Wan Chun Ju was so infuriated that she almost vomited blood: \"...\"That night, Qiao's old house quietly killed both wild chickens.One was used in a soup, the other turned braised chicken with fried mushrooms. It was so fragrant that Qiao Family almost swallow their tongues!Except for one person.That person was a big butt\u00a0chrysanthemum\u00a0.Of course, it wasn't the matter of guts.Her morning sickness had been cured for half a month. However, tonight for some unknown reasons, she started to feel sick as soon as she smelled the chicken.When she got to the dinner table, she still didn't believe in heresy. She endured nausea and forced herself to eat two pieces of chicken. Still, she vomited. At the end, she vomited out the yellow bile water!In the end, she hadn't eaten half of the chicken on the table!What's even more irritating was that the whole family was happily eating away, while she can only hide in the room and drink plain congee alone!Simply vexing!On Xiao Qiao's side, she was even worse off than Wan Chun Ju!After she came up from the stinky ditch, all the children made excuses and ran away without a trace. Even Lin Bao Zhu couldn't stand the smell of her and ran away.She limped towards the village. When she reached the village, she happened to encountered the villagers getting off work.Seeing Xiao Qiao like this, everyone gathered around curiously: \"Xiao Qiao, how did you become like this?\"The people who had just surrounded her quickly retreated due to the stench.\"Wow, what's this smell? Why is it so smelly?\"\"Xiao Qiao, didn't you fall into the feces hole?\"\"My god, it looks like it. Stinks to death. I have to leave quickly!\"The crowd dispersed as like alarmed birds and beasts, leaving Xiao Qiao with internal injuries!When she got home, Fang Xiao Juan saw her like this and scolded her fiercely. Fang Xiao Juan didn't stop even she went to sleep!Xiao Qiao gritted her teeth in anger!She felt that the whole world was against her!...The day after eating the wild chicken, Qiao Zhen Guo and his fifth younger brother, Qiao Zhen Min set out on the search.When everyone saw the two brothers, there were sympathy, empathy, and even more gloating at misfortune.\"So what if they know a high official? They still have to search in person?\"\"What nonsense are you talking about? It's better than you, who don't even know an high official!\"\"That's right. It's already sad enough for them to lose their child. If you continue to say something like this, be careful when Auntie Xiu Zhi punches you all over the place later!\"The person who spoke sarcastically was none other than Xing Hua, whose love turned into hate.Like Fang Xiao Juan, she was looking forward to Qiao Family's misfortune.Last time, they thought that Qiao Family had offended some high-ranking official. Unexpectedly, Qiao Family was so lucky. They actually saved the son of the deputy chief!How vexing!But thinking how Qiao Zhen Min lost his daughter, she felt happy again.It was best not to find her in this life. Then the couple can become enemies and ended up divorcing!Of course, she didn't want to get divorced like Fang Xiao Juan and then marry Qiao Zhen Min. She just couldn't let it go. So she hoped that the other party would be miserable than her!In short, there was a character problem!At Fang Family's side. They couldn't stand the Cai Family's undying four. Finally, they cut their flesh and compensated Cai Family 50 yuan before sending the four gods of plague out of the house.As soon as the four elderly left, Fang You Liang and Fang You Rou were also sent back.But soon, Fang Family met with mishap again!Fang Fu Gui received criticism!Last time, the production team's head of the women association, Song Chun Hua reported to the community's women association about Fang Fu Gui's wife being abused, suffering domestic violence, and finally died of exhaustion.The community women association attached great importance to this matter.The slogan that women can hold up half the sky had been chanted for so many years, but it was still just a slogan. There had been no progress!Therefore, after holding a meeting, the community's women association decided to hold a major event and take the opportunity to educate the men who commit domestic violence and the mother-in-laws who act up at home!When Song Chun Hua took the militia to Fang's house to arrest people, Fang Fu Gui and old woman Fang resisted.Old woman Fang jumped her feet and spat, \"My daughter-in-law married into our Fang Family, so she is our Fang's family member. Whatever we do to her, she must take it! She didn't say anything when she was alive. Now she's dead, who needs you people to nosily meddle in our business!\"Song Chun Hua looked at her with a sneer: \"So you are admitting that you and your son beat your daughter-in-law?\"Only then did old woman Fang realize that she had slipped her tongue and immediately shook her head in denial: \"I didn't say anything! I didn't say anything! Don't wrongly accuse the poor peasants!\"Their Fang Family was eighteenth generation of poor peasants. Who would dare to touch her?Song Chun Hua asked everyone, \"Did you all hear it just now? Let me tell you, you'd better tell the truth. See these militia? If any of you dare to cover up, they'll arrest you immediately!\"Everyone didn't have a good impression of Fang Family. What's more, they also sympathized with Fang Fu Gui's wife who died pitifully. How could they risk being arrested to speak for them now?\"I heard that old woman Fang confessed to beating her daughter-in-law!\"\"I heard that too!\"\"Yes, we can all testify!\"Old woman Fang was so infuriated that she almost vomited blood: \"Pah! You dogs can't spit out any decent tooth. Are you not afraid of lightning striking when you talk nonsense like this?\"A woman immediately retorted back: \"If Heaven have eyes, you mother and son would have been struck to death long ago!\"\"That's right. So vicious. No wonder Fang Family's misfortune happened one after another during this period. I think this is retribution!\"No matter how much old woman Fang exploded it, she was no match for everyone.Song Chun Hua had no intention of wasting time. She raised her hand and stated, \"Hurry up, take the person away!\"Those who could enter the militia were all young and tall men. The few surrounded them and soon pressed the mother and son to the ground.Old woman Fang made a sound of slaughtered pig's screech: \"Aiya! Injustice. Murder!\"Song Chun Hua took the opportunity to educate the members of the production team: \"You have all seen it. Whoever dares to beat their wife in the future will end up like this!\"Someone shouted weakly in the crowd: \"Why can't one beat their their wife when they aren't obedient?\"Song Chun Hua said loudly: \"Before she became your wife, she was first the country's citizen and receive protection by our country. If you hurt her, then that is hurting our country's labor and asset! To put it in the simplest way, Fang Fu Gui's death cause our production team to have one less labor force. This resulting in directly affecting the production team's harvest! If there are more of such things, can our country develop? So do you think is it illegal to beat wives? \"When everyone heard it, it really makes sense.Whether it was Qili Village or other production teams, there were a lot of people who beat their wives. Neither the men or women took it to heart.But now that they heard this, they realized that beating wives had such a big impact!Moreover, it was illegal and will get criticized. Some people's heart immediately cowardly and planned to stop beating their wife in the future.In the end, after Song Chun Hua denounced the mother and son in Qili Village, she only took Fang Fu Gui to go to other production teams for a denounce parade.It wasn't that she intended to let old woman Fang go. Old woman Fang fainted before the first criticism parade was over.She was also afraid of causing death. So she only took Fang Fu Gui away.While rejoicing that she didn't have to be criticized, old woman Fang felt sorry for her son: \"Song Chun Hua, when will you let my son come back?\"Song Chun Hua: \"Our community has a total of 18 production teams. Each production team needed to be visited. Of course, with so many production teams, it cannot be completed in one day. Whenever the trip is over, your son will come back. !\"Old woman Fang felt so distressed that her heart twitched: \"My poor son...\"Fang Fu Gui was taken to the next production team with his hands tied and a cloth stuffed in his mouth.Eighteen production teams! It'll take ten days in total.When Fang Fu Gui returned ten days later, he was so thin that he was completely out of shape!After such a round of propaganda, the number of people who beat their wives in the community had dropped significantly.Although it was impossible to put an end to it, at least it had a certain curb effect.Because of her contribution, Song Chun Hua happened to gain a position in the community's women association. The head of the community's women association proposed to Song Chun Hua to work in the community's women association.Song Chun Hua was naturally delighted. She was so overjoyed that she wept.But as soon as Song Chun Hua left, the position of the production team's women association head was vacate.After some consideration, Song Chun Hua recommended a person's name. That person was... Qiao Xiu Zhi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was unwilling to do bad things with good intentions and offended Qiao Family in the end.\"Xiu Zhi, have a good think about this matter. I considered everyone in our production team and feel that no one is more suitable than you!\"After coming to Qiao's old house, Song Chun Hua didn't drag around and directly told Qiao Xiu Zhi about the matter.What she said just now was really not flattering to Qiao Xiu Zhi. Although she worked in the women association, she secretly favored her son and grandson.Qiao Xiu Zhi was different. She can be said to be the least boy-biased person in the entire production team!Now there was only one male grandson in the entire Qiao Family. If it was other people, they would have panicked and definitely force their daughter-in-law to give birth to a son every day. If the daughter-in-law couldn't birth, then they were doomed. They will definitely be scolded as a hen that lays no eggs.Qiao Xiu Zhi had never forced her daughters-in-law. In this way, Qiao Family's daughters-in-law got fortunate life!In addition, An Ping did not receive any special treatment as the only male grandson of Qiao Family. Instead, Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan doted Da Qiao even more.This matter was often taken out by the long-tongued women in the village, saying that there was something wrong with their minds.In fact, Song Chun Hua somewhat couldn't understand them either. But this was someone else's family matter. She didn't plan to get to the bottom of it.Wan Chun Ju heard that her mother-in-law could become an official and was so excited that her large pancake face became like pig blood: \"Mom, you are so amazing! If you become the women association's head, our Qiao Family will be... what was that phrase... I remember, chicken and dog become immortals!\"Song Chun Hua: \"...\"When did being the production team's women association become chicken and dog turning into immortal?If it was like that, their Song Family would have ascended to heaven long ago. How could they be like now. Can't even enter the top three wealthy people ranking in the village?Chen Qiao Qiao, who was on the side, thought big butt Ju said something crude. Still, when she heard that her mother-in-law could be the head of women association, she was also very shocked.Mother-in-law becoming an official!? This was good and bad.The benefit was that with someone in the family being an official, Qiao Family will have weight in the production team in the future. And those who sneer at her because of the loss of the child will have to consider carefully from now on.The bad thing was that her mother-in-law was already so strong now. If she becomes an official, how will life be in the future?But whether she liked it or not, it was not up to her to decide.Qiao Xiu Zhi contemplated for a while and answered, \"I want to discuss this matter with Xue Chuan. Later, I will give you a reply.\"Song Chun Hua, who was caught off guard by a sudden mouthful of dog food: \"...Oh, alright. There's no hurry with this matter. You can discuss it slowly.\"She heard before that Qiao Xiu Zhi and her little husband, Xue Chuan had a very good relationship. But she hadn't taken it seriously.After all, the older a person was, the more indifferent the relationship between husband and wife will be. Many elderly couples in the production team have slept in separate rooms long ago. Usually they will not do any intimate behavior in front of their children and grandchildren.There was also those like old woman Yao. The most awesome of them all. After being husband and wife for a lifetime, they can't wait to never interact until they die of old age!Walking out of the Qiao's old house, she felt a little sour in her heart. She couldn't say she was jealous, Just like envy instead.After all, no matter how strong a woman was, she looked forward to a man who can take care of her for a lifetime.Qiao Xiu Zhi was one lucky woman!After Xue Chuan came back, Qiao Xiu Zhi told him about it.After listening, Xue Chuan stretched out his hand to hold his wife's hand and stated, \"I don't have any objection. It's mainly depend on you. If you like to, then go for it. If you don't like it, then push it.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi grasped her husband's hand back. The two's intertwined their fingers together: \"Then I'll try.\"She had the strength that no one else had. When she was young, she once thought of using this advantage to start a career. However, the situation was turbulent and it wasn't allowed. Later, she got married and had children. With Xue Chuan by her side, her heart gradually calmed down.It was settled for decades. She didn't want to look back on her life when she is old and see her life was only raising children. She also wanted to live a different life. Working in the women association may be a good start.Xue Chuan nodded with a smile: \"Then I'm supporting you behind your back.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at him and merrily pointed out, \"Aren't you afraid of being told that your husband collar is in bad shape again?\"Xue Chuan smiled more gently: \"It won't get back into shape for a lifetime. I'm already getting old, what do I need that thing for?\"His family was a landlord. Even if he was handsome and had no rivals in the surrounding area, he still couldn't marry a wife. Everyone regarded his family as a wild beast.Only she never disliked him from beginning to end.In the most vicious years, he would have died long ago if she hadn't protected him.So it was good to be alive. What need was there for a husband collar!...After dinner that night, Qiao Xiu Zhi announced to everyone that she was going to work in the women association.Wan Chun Ju was even happier than becoming an official herself: \"Mom, you finally figured it out. It's wonderful! In the future, our family will have an official!\"In the future, when she goes out to\u00a0blow water\u00a0, mother-in-law's title of women association was enough for her to\u00a0blow a pot\u00a0!Qiao Zhen Guo laughed and said, \"Mom, I also think it's pretty good. If my wife becomes a demon again in the future, Mom, you can use your official prestige to educate her!\"Qiao Zhen Guo and Qiao Zhen Min had went out for more than half a month and returned without success.Outside, they were burning money every day. What's more, they were running around every day. No matter how good their bodies were, they couldn't hold it up. The two had to come back and prepare to recover before continuing to search.Wan Chun Ju suddenly had a bed feeling: \"...\"Why didn't she think of this? Wouldn't her mother-in-law be even more powerful when she becomes an official?Da Qiao gazed at her grandmother with bright eyes. She said softly with a look of admiration: \"Grandmother, you are amazing! I will be as amazing as you when I grow up!\"To be looked at by a small dumpling with deer-like eyes and received sweet sounding words of admiration, anyone's heart would swell!Qiao Xiu Zhi's heart softened. She reached out and rubbed her fluffy hair, \"Okay, then you have to eat well. Once you grow up, you can be as powerful as Grandmother.\"Da Qiao replied, \"Okay, I will definitely eat well. When I grow up, I will be as powerful as Grandmother!\"Qiao Zhen Jun: \"...\"He can picture his delicate and soft daughter punching a man to tears. Instantly, he felt a little panicked.The others didn't have any objection. They thought it was wonderful that Mom can become the head of women association. But it won't go down so well for the men in the village who liked domestic violence.Sure enough, when the production team announced that Qiao Xiu Zhi was going to be the head of the women association, the short-tempered men who liked to use women as sandbags had the biggest opinions.\"What the hell? As long as they are a woman, they can be the head of the women association these days? Why don't you let my mom be it?\"\"That's right! If that big strength Qiao becomes women association's head, can we still have a good life in the future?\"\"I feel that\u00a0a black case work happened here\u00a0! Why do they get to choose whoever does it? Without our consent, I won't accept it!\"\"I can't accept it either!\"So the group went to the production team office to protest and demand a re-election!Song Chun Hua blushed with anger when she saw this group of good-for-nothing men: \"What black case work? Isn't it just you\u00a0having a ghost in your heart\u00a0? Afraid that a powerful woman will come and one-punch you to death like she did with the wild boar!\"Protesting men: \"...\"Song Chun Hua's words can be said to hit the nail on the head. Pointing out what these men were most afraid of.They were used to beating their wife. It was impossible for them to not beat. It was impossible in this life.In the past, after those women were beaten, they would come to the women association to complain and Song Chun Hua would persuade them with all her might.After persuasion?It went how it should. Later, they'll still continue to beat when they want to!But if Song Chun Hua was replaced by Qiao Xiu Zhi, they felt slightly cowardly in their hearts.Qiao Xiu Zhi was the woman who killed a wild boar with one punch. If the fist fell on them, would they still be alive?The more these men thought, the more afraid they became. They persisted on demanding for a public re-election!Wang Shui Sheng was exasperated. He felt that these people just wanted to make trouble. Still, he didn't dare to let these people stir the trouble to the community.So many things have happened in the production team this year. His position as leader will really be replaced if something goes wrong!He had no choice but to organize an election meeting and get the entire production team vote together.Wan Chun Ju didn't expect things to have so many twists and turns.She stealthily touched her man's arm and whispered, \"Zhen Guo, what are your thoughts of me running for that position?\"Qiao Zhen Guo laughed and replied, \"What's thoughts? Wife, you think too much. If you participate, you will definitely not get any vote!\"Wan Chun Ju almost died from anger: \"...It's fine that others won't vote for me if I participate. What about you? Aren't you going to vote for me?\"Qiao Zhen Guo said as a matter of course: \"Of course not. I will definitely vote for my mom!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"How vexing!Did this man have any heart? She birthed children for him and in the end, the most important person in his heart was his mom!Chen Qiao Qiao, who was on the side, was in a daze.There had been no news about little Wan'er. The relationship between her and Qiao Zhen Min had been in a deadlock.She was very anxious as she didn't know what to do to break this deadlock!Wang Shui Sheng announced that the position of women association's head will be publicly elected. Anyone who wants to run for the election can come up and register.Qiao Xiuz Zi didn't go to register her name because Song Chun Hua took the initiative to recommend her.Then several women came forward and said they wanted to run.The most bizarre thing was old woman Fang's participation. She was booed down before she registered on stage!Old woman Fang was so angry that she broke into scolding and spat on everyone's face!Just when Wang Shui Sheng was about to announce the result, a woman walked out with her hands supporting her waist.This person was none other than Da Qiao's mom... Fang Xiao Juan.\"Shh! Can Fang Family have some face? One is like this! Now two are like this? Simply shameless!\"\"Ain't that right! If old woman Fang can be the head of the women association, I can be the head of the community!\"\"And what's up with Fang Xiao Juan? She abused her daughter so much back then. Such a person has the face to run for the women association's head? Pah!\"Fang Xiao Juan trembled with fury when she heard everyone's contempt for her!But the more everyone didn't want her to run, the more she wanted to. Since Qiao Xiu Zhi can do it, why can't she?Wang Shui Sheng saw Fang Xiao Juan come up. His face darkened. Still, he didn't say anything in the end.When someone saw Da Qiao coming over, they teased her, \"Da Qiao, both your grandmother and your mom are running for election. Who do you want to be the head of the women association?\"When Fang Xiao Juan heard this, she turned her head and intensely watched Da Qiao.Da Qiao felt that her mom's appearance was scary. Her gaze was like she wanted to eat her. Her body shook and she quickly shrank her little body behind her grandmother.Just when everyone thought she wouldn't answer, she showed a little fluffy head like a squirrel and spoke softly: \"I choose my grandmother. My grandmother is the most powerful and best person in the world!\"The little girl's small head peeked from behind Qiao Xiu Zhi. It was unknown when. Her sallow stuttering appearance from before had completely faded. She had grown into a fair and tender little fairy.That fair and well-behaved appearance... That soft and sweet voice... They were like a feather scratching one's heart and made people instantly softened.Everyone suddenly understood why Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan loved this granddaughter, Da Qiao so much.Such a cute little dumpling. Just seeing, they already like her too...When Fang Xiao Juan heard Da Qiao's words, she was so steaming mad that she wanted to give her a harsh lesson. However, her ex-mother-in-law was standing there like a guarding god. How could she possibly dare to speak up!So vexing!After some ruckus, the voting finally began.There wasn't that much paper to waste these days. So voting was simple and crude...raise one's hand!If they supported that person, raise their hand. If they don't support, don't raise their hand. Everyone had only one chance to raise their hand.Song Chun Hua stood out to canvass vote for Qiao Xiu Zhi: \"Qiao Xiu Zhi is strong and high moral quality. If she is to serve as the head of the women association of our production team, I believe that there will be fewer cases of domestic violence. Then our team will be expected to be selected as advanced production team this year. So please vote for Qiao Xiu Zhi!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi was a bit of a weirdo in the eyes of everyone. For example, she doted her granddaughter instead of her grandson. At an old age, the couple had a good relationship. And she supported her children's divorce and so on.But apart from these, her character was unquestionable. Her strength also gave people a great sense of security.Those women who were often beaten can't wait for her to take office immediately and uphold justice for them!Qili Village had a total of 450 adults. Qiao Xiu Zhi got 365 votes.The other women got seven or eight votes. Only Fang Xiao Juan got one vote.\"Hahaha... only one vote. How embarrassing.\"\"I laughed so hard. If I were her, I wouldn't dare to go out!\"\"I say, Xing Hua's mother-in-law. Your Xing Hua hang out with Fang Xiao Juan every day. It must be her who voted for Fang Xiao Juan just now. Are you not afraid that there will be trouble in your family in the future?\"Xing Hua's mother-in-law turned her head and glared at her daughter-in-law: \"I'll sort you out once we're back!\"Xing Hua's face turned white at once and her body trembled all over.The results was clear.Qiao Xiu Zhi overwhelmed the other candidates with an absolute advantage of 365 votes.Song Chun Hua declared with a rosy face: \"I announce that starting today, Qiao Xiu Zhi will be the our Qili Production Team's women association's head. Qiao Xiu Zhi, please come up to the stage to say a few words!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi stepped onto the stage. Her pace carried mighty and heroic bearing.She was tall from the beginning. Once she stood on the stage, she would definitely be a female general who fought all directions if it were ancient times.She swept her glance at everyone and stated: \"Women can hold up half the sky. This is not a joke. Not just the entire Qili production team. I guarantee you even in the entire community, no man is stronger than me. If there is any objection, stand up now!\"Everyone: \"...\"None! None at all. Whatever you is whatever goes.\"From the looks of this, no one has objection. Very good. If any woman in the production team is bullied in the future, come to me. I will definitely fight for justice for you!\"Saying that, she walked to a stone, raised her hand, and smashed it down!A 'bang' loudly rang out!The stone cracked into several pieces!Everyone: \"...\"The men who protested before turned pale and shivered.\"Thank you everyone!\" After saying that, she walked off the stage.Still as mighty and heroic as when she went up!Qiao Family applauded.Da Qiao's eyes lit up like stars in the sky: \"Grandmother is amazing!\"Qiao Dong Ying nodded: \"Yes, Grandmother is the most powerful!\"The villagers came to their senses and applauded.Only Fang Family were so angry that they became puffer fish.Xiao Qiao watched the back of cheering Qiao Family. For the first time, she began to regret.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qiao Family celebrated with extra dishes that night.In order to give his wife a celebration, Xue Chuan personally cooked. He took on making all the dishes by himself.Qiao Family ate until their mouth was covered with oil. Even the pot full of soup was used to accompany the rice.It was so delicious!After Qiao Zhen Guo was full, he burped and remarked, \"It's the same ingredients. Why does Dad's food taste so good and my wife's food tastes like pig food? It's hard to understand!\"Wan Chun Ju blushed with anger: \"...Qiao Zhen Guo, don't eat the food I cook if you have the ability!\"Simply pissing her off!Badmouthing her in front of so many people! Does she not need face?Qiao Zhen Guo's expression of 'I'm doing it for your good' was asking for a beating: \"Wife, you have to actively accept criticism and strive for progress. Our mom is now the head of women association. You can't drag down and embarrass her!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"She really wanted to gag his mouth with rice!What did her cooking have to do with her mother-in-law being head of women association?What goddamn logic!Everyone had become accustomed to this couple having such a stupid talk from time to time. Nobody wasn't surprised.Everyone thought that Qiao Xiu Zhi would be very busy in the future and seek justice for those women who were harmed by domestic violence everywhere.Actually, it was the opposite.Qiao Xiu Zhi had been in office for more than ten days. Not to mention that there were no women coming, not even the female mosquito had flown into the office!Reason?Simple.The women who were harmed and domestically abused were very excited at first. They wanted to seek justice for themselves from Qiao Xiu Zhi. But before they went out, their men and their in-laws let out harsh declaration. Saying that if they dared to go, they would divorce her off later!Although these women were beaten and scolded, they never thought of getting divorced. If they were divorced because they went to the women association, it would definitely not be worth it!There were also some who saw Qiao Xiu Zhi smashed the stone with one punch. If the fist fell on their husbands, what would they do if their husband got internal injuries? Their heart ached!So under various reasons, no one came.When Fang Xiao Juan found out, she laughed like a hyena on the spot: \"My god! She was full of words that day. And what happened? Not a single person in sight. It's better for me to be women association's head!\"This situation was indeed somewhat awkward.Song Chun Hua came back from the community's women association and went to comfort Qiao Xiu Zhi: \"Xiu Zhi, don't be discouraged. This matter is not your problem. It's those women who are... hateful!\"Many people complained that their women association was useless and could not protect those abused women.But the problem was that many times it was them dragged their leg were none other than the women who were beaten!After they came to complain, they may regret it immediately with a turn of a head. Or when their men got lectured, they felt heart ache.If the militia were used to take their men away, they would cry and beg them not to take their men away. Some would go too far and turn and bite back. Saying that they were dog-biting mice and meddling with their business!So was this infuriating?Song Chun Hua talked about women association's bizarre incidents. Her face flushed with excitement and her chest heaved violently.Unexpectedly, Qiao Xiu Zhi was very calm from beginning to end: \"In the past, the ancestors have a saying, God help those who help themselves. If a person doesn't even want to save themselves, why should outsiders save them? So you don't have to worry. I didn't take it to heart.\"No one came to women association to ask for help. Everyone thought she would be embarrassed, but she wasn't at all.Why should she punish herself with other people's stupidity and worry about those stupid people?There was no such reasoning!Therefore, if they need her help, she will try her best to help them. If they would rather be beaten to death than ask for help, then they will carry the blame on their own!Song Chun Hua looked at her with admiration: \"Xiu Zhi, I think choosing you to be women association is the best decision I have ever made in my life!\"Compared with the other party, she wasn't calm.When no one came to ask for help, she felt ashamed. When someone came for help, she felt annoyed. When she encountered a nutcase, she was always so angry that her stomach hurt!Her spouse often told her that being women association's head for a few years, her life will be shortened by a few years!It seems that she will have to learn from Qiao Xiu Zhi in the future.Calm down. Must keep calm!...The second time Qiao Zhen Min went out on the search, he went with his third elder sister, Qiao Hong Xia.This time, the two were still unsuccessful.Every time the villagers saw them come back with a dejected face and a dusty atmosphere, there were all kinds of words.One said: \"Old Fifth Qiao's reaction made my heart twist. If my child disappear, I will definitely not fair as well as him!\"\"Yeah. Old Fifth Qiao is a good father. It's really hard for him to go out and search for his child so often!\"\"What hard!\" One sarcastically uttered, \"It's just a lass. Since she's gone, then she's gone. Just birth another one! He's still so young. If you have the energy to do that, might as well hurry up and give birth to a few. I say, Qiao Family has too much money and no where to spend!\"\"Speaking of this, you reminded me! Where did Qiao Family get so much money to go on searches. Going to the provincial city, food, drink, lodging, and travel all cost money. It cost twenty yuan for a trip, right? Say you guys, did Qiao Family hide Xue Family's treasures from back then?\"Speaking of it now, there were still some old people who still remember how Xue Family was rich back in those days. Many people couldn't eat enough in those days. But Xue Family wore silk and satin as they ate eat bird's nest. So rich that people's teeth itched!Later, Xue Family encounter a downfall. All the family wealth was lost by Xue Chuan's father. Who knew if they hid a gold bar or two or something.The more everyone talked, the more red-eyed they came. Still, no one dared to go to Qiao's house to ask clearly.After everyone left, Wan Chun Ju came out from behind the wall with cobwebs on her head. Her eyes spun.When she went to bed at night, she pushed her man's back and spoke, \"Zhen Guo, do you think Dad and Mom are hiding gold bars?\"The two in-laws love the hat calamity, Da Qiao so much now. They gave her five hundred yuan last time they sold 100-year-old Ganoderma lucidum. Who knows if they will give her the gold bars!Qiao Zhen Guo was the kind of person who sleep as soon as he touch the bed. At this moment, he was pushed awake by his wife and said confusedly, \"There are. Of course there are. There are many!\"There are many?Wan Chun Ju's eyes instantly widened. Her heart pounded: \"Then do you know where it is put?\"Qiao Zhen Guo didn't respond. There was a sound of snoring from his nose.Wan Chun Ju was angry and anxious. How could he still fall asleep at this time?She pushed the other party to wake up again: \"Zhen Guo, tell me quickly. Where are those gold bars?\"Qiao Zhen Guo flipped his body around and muttered, \"In the pigsty.\"Pigsty?Wan Chun Ju's eyes suddenly lit up. She felt that she had realized the truth!Speaking of which, the pigsty was also one of Xue Family's properties back then. But after the founding of the state, her father-in-law took the initiative to hand over the properties to the state.As the saying goes, the dirtiest place was the safest place. So her father-in-law could definitely hide the gold bars in the pigsty!Wan Chun Ju was so excited that she couldn't sleep all night, tossing and turning. She kept having the feeling like she was going to get rich!The next day, when Qiao Zhen Guo saw the dark circles under his wife's eyes, he was startled and said, \"Wife, did you become a thief last night?\"Wan Chun Ju was in a good mood and didn't care what he said at all.When it was time to eat breakfast, she announced an important message: \"Mom, I have no morning sickness now. I can't sit still all day.\"Everyone looked at her like she was a ghost.Qiao Zhen Guo was surprised: \"Wife, are you still my wife? When did your consciousness become so high?\"Wan Chun Ju almost fainted from anger: \"...You shut up! Mom, I thought about it and felt that the pigsty job is quite suitable for me.\"Chen Qiao Qiao looked up at her.Big bum's mouth was a ghost tricking human!Before when she, Chen Qiao Qiao was arranged to work in the pigsty, Wan Chun Ju extremely proud. Every day she came back, her body full of pig poo scent was disdained by her!At this moment, she suddenly wanted to work in the pigsty. There was definitely a catch!Qiao Xiu Zhi also felt that eldest daughter-in-law had a problem. Still, she was confident that the other party could not escape her grasp. So she nodded: \"I will ask the production leader later if there is still a vacancy. If there is, you can go. If not, then you can do other work.\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Damn, why didn't she think of this point?She spun her eyes and landed on little bum Chen Qiao Qiao: \"Qiao Qiao, didn't you say you hated the smell of pig poo before? Why don't I go instead of you and you do another job?\"Chen Qiao Qiao calmly clipped some food for herself and replied, \"It used to be the past. I'm used to the smell of pig poo. It smells alright.\"Everyone: \"...\"Wan Chun Ju knew that she was deliberately going against her.So infuriating!...The pears on Qiao's small house's pear tree were finally ripe and ready to be picked!After everyone found out, they all made way to Qiao's small house to check it. After seeing the treeful of fruit, waves of gulping sound rang out.\"I've never seen such a big pear. It looks delicious!\"\"Hahaha, you're a gluttonous dog. Just admit you're craving for it!\"\"I am. It can't be that you don't want to eat it?\"Want! Who didn't want to eat?There ware very few things these days. Even when one have a some money in their hand, they may not be able to buy anything. Let alone fruit. They can only go to the mountains to pick some wild fruits to eat in autumn.No one had eaten such a large pear for many years. What's the children had never eaten it since birth.The adults can endure. However, the children can't. They immediately started crying.\"I want to eat pears! I want to eat pears! Won't go home without pears!\"\"Mom, I want to eat pears too!\"\"Grandmother, didn't you say that you love me, your precious grandson the most? Then buy me pears to eat!\"Buying was impossible. No one was allowed to trade these days. But the villagers can barter.In order to relieve their children's hunger, many people ran home to bring vegetables, cornmeal, or other food. Then they came to Qiao's house to exchange.Some families were richer and exchanged for three or four. Some have tight wallet, only change for one. After changing, they went home to cut the pear to eat!My god, once cut open with a knife, there's so much water!Take a bite. My god, that's fresh!It was the first time they've eaten such sweet and tender pears. It was worth it!Some people were still not satisfied after eating and even took more things to exchange for a few more.The two brothers Fang You Liang and Fang You Rou saw that everyone eating it. Their mouths craved so much that their saliva was dripping to the ground.\"Hey, Da Qiao! Come out!\" Fang You Liang called to Da Qiao, who was eating a pear in the yard.Seeing that it was them, Da Qiao walked over slowly with the pear in her hands. In front of them, she took a bite and asked, \"You guys are looking for me? What's the matter?\"The two brothers stared at the pear in her hand, swallowed a few mouthfuls and said, \"Do you still have any pears at home?\"Da Qiao took another bite and responded, \"Yes. Do you want to eat it?\"The two brothers nodded like a woodpecker as gulped: \"Yes! Yes!\"Fang You Rou raised his two dirty little paws: \"I want to eat three!\"In front of them, Da Qiao crunched on the pear and said, \"If you want to eat, then exchange it with something.\"Fang You Liang blushed with anger: \"I'm your cousin. You dare to ask for something to eat a pear!? You white-eyed wolf!\"Da Qiao took two bites and looked at them through the door of the yard: \"If you don't eat it, then go away! Pi Pi come here!\"\"Woof woof woof...\"Pi Pi, who already had a vigorous figure, ran over quickly. Lying at the door of the yard, he barked at the two brothers.Fang You Liang and Fang You Rou were so frightened that their faces turned pale. They turned around and ran away as if they didn't their butts.When the two brothers returned to Fang's house, old woman Fang knew that they didn't get any pears to eat, so she jumped in anger and cursed Da Qiao loudly.There was a sudden \"kacha\" sound.Then a sound of slaughtering pig rang in the yard: \"Ouch, my old waist...\"Although old woman Fang's waist was healed, she was old and didn't use any medication. So if she didn't pay attention to the sprained area, it was easy to get sprained again.She was so agitated just now and jumped around like a grasshopper. Wasn't this asking a problem to jump out?Da Qiao didn't know that Fang Family met with misfortune again. Her heart was currently soak in happiness.Because tomorrow was her birthday. Her grandmother said they'll celebrate her birthday!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57When thinking about it, Da Qiao hadn't celebrated her birthday before.On previous years' birthday, her dad would cook her a red egg. However, the red egg often didn't end up in her stomach. As soon as her dad went to work, the egg would be taken away by her mom immediately.While Younger Sister was different. Not only did she get egg, she also had brown sugar cakes to eat and beautiful new clothes to wear!Every time she saw her mom hugging Younger Sister in her arms and calling her sweetheart, she was envious.But now, she finally didn't have to envy Younger Sister, because she can celebrate her birthday too!On her birthday, Da Qiao woke up early.After freshening up, she tied up two small buns by herself. It was just her arms were too short and the small buns were tied one up and one down.\"Dong, dong, dong...\"There was a knock at the door, followed by Auntie Hui's gentle voice: \"Da Qiao, are you up? Can I come in?\"\"Auntie Hui, come in. I'm already up.\" Da Qiao softly answered.Lin Hui pushed open the door and came in. What entered her sight, was little dumpling vainly playing with her hair in front of the mirror. Her little face displayed annoyance.She curled her lips and amusedly spoke, \"Auntie Hui will do it for you.\"Da Qiao stared at the clothes in Auntie Hui's hands. Her long eyelashes blinked: \"Auntie Hui, who are the clothes in your hands for?\"Lin Hui tapped on her nose and teased her: \"It's for our family's big cutie!\"Da Qiao's eyes brightened. Her brows and eyes curved with delight: \"I'm our family's big cutie!\"Lin Hui couldn't help laughing: \"Yes. I'm giving it to you, big Cutie!\"She still remembered seeing Da Qiao more than three years ago. She was still a short glutinous rice dumpling. Carrying a small back basket, she picked up firewood in East Wood by herself. She was crying while picking it up. There was a red slap print on her face.When she saw it, she couldn't help but feel distressed.Such a petite and cute child! How could Fang Xiao Juan be so ruthless?If Fang Xiao Juan was a stepmother, she could understand. But this was a child born by her after ten months of pregnancy. She couldn't understand how she thought.That time, she poured the firewood she had picked up to little dumpling's basket and heard her stammer out a thank you her in a soft, sweet voice. Afterward, when she saw that Da Qiao was so hungry, she insisted on taking her home.That was how they met.It was just that she never thought that one day, she would become her mom. Even though she hadn't called her Mom until now.She will wait for it. She believed that one day, she can hear her sincerely call her Mom.The clothes that Auntie Hui made for her this time were really beautiful. A light blue dress. It was a complete set with a large hem and beautiful floral embroidery.Blue was a very attractive color. People with fair skin will appear fairer when they wear it. Those with dark skin will appear darker. Da Qiao's skin was as white as milk now. Wearing this light blue dress, her whole person was so fair that she seemed to glow.What a pretty sight!\"Auntie Hui, do I look pretty?\" Da Qiao turned around. Her big eyes turned into crescents and smiled sweetly.\"Pretty. Our family's big Cutie is the prettiest!\"Lin Hui's heart softened. Looking at such a delicate little dumpling, she really wanted to give her everything.Da Qiao shyly rushed over, hugged Auntie Hui's body and stated, \"Auntie Hui, thank you. I like it very much.\"It was still Auntie Hui.Lin Hui was slightly disappointed. Soon she became happy: \"Come, Auntie Hui will do up two braids for you.\"After dressing up, Da Qiao still hadn't come out. Little Yi Ming and little Dong Lin rushed in: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, we have a present for you!\"After mutual disdaining, these two little dumplings finally \"slept\" out some affection. Now they were brothers.Little Dong Lin displayed a toothy smile and declared in a baby voice, \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, close your eyes.\"Little Yi Ming nodded his head: \"Yes, close your eyes.\"Da Qiao gave face to her younger brothers. She closed her eyes obediently and said softly, \"What do you want to give me. I got warn you, you can't use caterpillars to scare Elder Sister. If you do that, Elder Sister will be angry! \"\"We won't!\" Little Yi Ming shook his head like a rattle.Little Dong Lin followed suit and stated he wouldn't. Then he took out a drawing from behind him: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, you can open your eyes now!\"When Da Qiao opened her eyes, she almost burst out into laughter.There were three little people on the painting. The little people have a big head and a small body, while the hands and feet were like their hen, Gu Gu. They were all claws.If it weren't for the little person who represented her having two pigtails, she wouldn't have recognized it as herself!Little Dong Lin and little Yi Ming stared straight at her with their eyes open. Their amount of nervousness was the same on their expressions.Seeing that Da Qiao didn't speak, little Dong Lin turned around and blamed little Yi Ming: \"Look, it's because you didn't draw well enough, Elder Sister Da Qiao won't smile anymore! It's better to take my gift out!\"The gift Xiao Donglin prepared was relatively straightforward. It was seven white rabbit candy. Each represented one year old. He had saved for a long time.Just before he came, little Yi Ming commented that his gift was meaningless. Elder Sister Da Qiao often ate white rabbit candies recently.After listening to this, he also felt that his gift was too ordinary. So he agreed to share a gift with little Yi Ming.Who knew it wasn't as good as his!Da Qiao held back her laughter. She put away the drawing and the seven white rabbit candies, \"Thank you, younger brothers! I like it!\"Little Yi Ming's self-confidence was knocked down. His little eyes stared with confusion said, \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, do you like both gifts?\"Da Qiao seriously nodded: \"Yes, I like both of them!\"The two younger brothers liked her so much and the family treated her well. She really experienced happiness and joy.Hearing Elder Sister Da Qiao's words, little Yi Ming finally became cheerful again: \"Hurry, let's go out. My mom made you longevity noodles. You can live to be a hundred years old once you eat it!\"Lin Hui listened to the children's childish words. The mirth at the corner of her mouth couldn't disappear.Qiao Hong Xia gave Da Qiao a longevity noodle.Qiao Zhen Jun gave his daughter a very delicate handmade wooden box. He made it himself. It came with a lock.Da Qiao loved it.She felt as if she was surrounded by bubbles of joy. So happy that she wanted to cry....After breakfast, those who got work, went to work and those who didn't need to go to work, did housework.Recently, it peak time for farming. Many women went to answer the roll call before returning home to do chores.Lin Hui did the same. After working in the field for a while, she returned and carried a wooden tub to the river to wash the clothes.There were already many women washing clothes by the river.Seeing Lin Hui coming over, someone took the initiative to make room for her: \"Old Second Qiao's wife, come here to wash. There is a spot here.\"Hearing everyone call her 'old Second Qiao's wife', Lin Hui bit her lip. Her cheeks were as red as rouge. At the same time, she felt a little sweetness in her heart.Fang Xiao Juan, who was washing clothes at the other end, heard this addressment, and her breath choked. The laundry stick in her hand smashed down.\"Ahhh...\"Xing Hua let out a miserable shriek: \"Fang Xiao Juan, what are you doing! You hit my hand!\"The clothes Xing Hua was washing floated out along the water at once. She hurriedly rushed to fish it. After grabbing it, she just stood firm and Fang Xiao Juan's stick smashed down on her.F*ck. In a blink of an eye, her hands were swollen into pig hooves!Fang Xiao Juan came back to her senses and apologetically spoke when she saw her hand: \"I didn't do it on purpose. I was just disgusted by that woman. I'll give two eggs to make up for you.\"\"You're talking about that slut Lin Hui, right?\"For the sake of the two eggs, Xing Hua decided not to hold grudge with Fang Xiao Juan.After Xing Hua was lectured by her mother-in-law last time, she restrained herself for a while. But she couldn't help but get together with Fang Xiao Juan after a while.She always felt that she couldn't get along with other people. It was only Fang Xiao Juan who could understand her no matter what she said.Xing Hua had never studied a book, so she didn't know there was a phrase,\u00a0stinky smells are compatible.She and Fang Xiao Juan can be said to stink together.Fang Xiao Juan gritted her teeth. Her tone was sour: \"It's that slut! What's there to be proud of for picking up second-hand goods that I don't want!\"When in fact, she was going crazy with jealousy!Anyone with eyes can see that after Lin Hui got married, her whole person was like a dead tree reviving into its spring form and it regained its radiance.In the past, Lin Hui always wore gray clothes. Her whole aura was gray. A smile was seldom seen on her face throughout the year. Although she was young, she seemed like a dead person.But now she was alive. Her eyes are bright, her face was rosy, and it looked like she was living a good life!Lin Hui's rosy face was like a thorn to the eyes. It made Fang Xiao Juan feel very uncomfortable.She thought that after she divorced Qiao Zhen Jun, she would get better and better. Qiao Zhen Jun could only lie in bed for the rest of his life and be a paralyzed rubbish who needs to be served by people when he poops and urinates!Who knew that Qiao Zhen Jun stood up and was able to walk again. What's more, he married her most hated person, Lin Hui!On the other hand, she herself hadn't had a good day since she remarried!Wang Xin Sheng was lazy to death. Since he got married, he had never brought a penny home. They relied on parent-in-laws' help for food and drink!Not only did Wang Xin Sheng not help her with the housework, he demand for her to serve him like a master at home. If he didn't like it, the best case was scolding. The worst was beating. She had been slapped several times by him!During this period, she recalled Qiao Zhen Jun's 'fight or scold, no retaliation'. The more she thought about it, the more she regretted it. If she knew that Qiao Zhen Jun would get healed, she wouldn't rush to go back to her maternal home!In the end, it was Da Qiao's fault. If it wasn't for the purpose of driving her out of the house, how could she leave in a fit of rage?Xing Hua wiggled her brows and said, \"Will you just swallow this breath? It can't be that you are afraid of her?\"Fang Xiao Juan was originally upset. Now being provoked by Xing Hua, a fierce glint instantly appeared in her eyes, \"I'm afraid of her? Why should I be afraid of that slut?\"Xing Hua continued to instigate: \"If you aren't afraid of her, then go up and slap her now!\"Fang Xiao Juan wanted to do this in her heart. And being instigated like this, her jealousy gave her courage. She stood up and walked towards Lin Hui: \"Lin Hui, did you do it on purpose?\"Lin Hui raised her head to see Fang Xiao Juan, frowned slightly and responded, \"What are you saying? I don't understand!\"\"Don't understand? Are you an dimwit? Your clothes are so dirty! Don't you know to wash them at the lower side? You wash these dirty clothes in the upper side and the dirty water flow to our side. This isn't on purpose?\"Lin Hui's face became cold: \"Fang Xiao Juan, if you want to find fault, just say it directly. You don't need to make such disgusting excuses!\"Who didn't do laundry like this?Who washes clothes deliberately distinguishes whether it was dirty or not? It's not washing vegetables!Fang Xiao Juan's face flushed red: \"You're motherf*cking disgusting! You little bitch, you dare to call me disgusting! If I don't smack you today, I'll take your surname!\"Today, she made up her mind to teach Lin Hui a lesson.This anger had been suppressed since she knew that Lin Hui was going to marry Qiao Zhen Jun.If she didn't vent out, she will definitely suffocate herself to death!Lin Hui avoided her hand, stood up and ran towards the shore.This woman was a lunatic. She can't go head on with her.What's more, the other party was still pregnant. If there was any mishap, then she will still be the one in trouble.Fang Xiao Juan couldn't get a single hit and almost fell. Affter she stood firm, she immediately chased after.Someone persuaded: \"Oh, Xiao Juan, stop chasing. You are still pregnant. If you fall, it will be too late to regret it!\"Some people watched the play: \"Could it be Fang Xiao Juan regret her divorce with old Second Qiao? Back at Qiao's house, she never have to wash clothes by the river!\"\"Lin Hui, don't run if you have the guts!\"At this moment, Da Qiao came over.Seeing that her mom was chasing her stepmom, she immediately ran over and protected Auntie Hui by keeping her behind her: \"You are not allowed to bully my mom!\"This 'mom' not only stunned Lin Hui, but also stunned Fang Xiao Juan.Lin Hui's eyes gradually turned red: \"Da Qiao, what did you call me just now?\"The surprise came so quickly that she couldn't believe her ears.Da Qiao pursed her lips and shyly smiled at her. She shouted it out in a hurry just now. But now, getting her to seriously call again, she can't.Fang Xiao Juan exploded like a cat whose tail had been stepped on: \"You white-eyed wolf, I have worked so hard to conceive you and have raised you for so many years. You repay me like this?\"She didn't care about this child, Da Qiao. The more she didn't care, the less she will allow the other party to escape her control and the less she will allow the other party to betray her!Fang Xiao Juan was so infuriated that she wanted to tear up Da Qiao!She thought like this and actually implemented it!She pounced with ferocious facial features. Her foot raised and kicked Da Qiao's face!\"Don't!\"Lin Hui saw her intention and turned to protect Da Qiao in her arms. Her back was exposed to Fang Xiao Juan.Strangely, the imagined pain didn't appear.Lin Hui was a little stunned. Just as she was about to turn her head, she heard Fang Xiao Juan screamed as she was getting forced on: \"Snake! There's a snake!\"Da Qiao and Lin Hui looked down and saw a little black snake popped at Fang Xiao Juan's ankle at some unknown point.The little black snake bit Fang Xiao Juan's ankle out two bloody holes. Then it twisted around and dived into the grass. Soon, it disappeared.Fang Xiao Juan's face turned pale: \"I'm dying...\"Then she rolled her eyes and fainted.Lin Hui secretly commented how bad luck it was. She hurriedly sent her to the health clinic with the others.Everyone thought that Fang Xiao Juan was going to be poisoned to death. But the doctor said that she wasn't poisoned. She fainted because she was too agitated.Seeing that Fang Xiao Juan was fine, Lin Hui didn't bother to care about her. She took Da Qiao back to continue the laundry.On the way back, Lin Hui held her hand and said, \"Da Qiao, you called me Mom just now. I didn't misheard it, right?\"Da Qiao pursed her lips, nodded as she said softly, \"Mom, you heard right.\"Auntie Hui was so kind to her. In fact, she should have changed her addressing to 'Mom' long ago.It was just that she wasn't used to it. As well as that she felt too shy to call her 'Mom'. So it was delayed until now.Lin Hui's eyes were red. She squatted down and hugged the child. Her voice choked: \"Oh, Mom's good child. Mom is really happy!\"Da Qiao hugged Auntie Hui back and responded, \"I'm so happy that you are my mom!\"Compared to her own mom, she felt that Auntie Hui was more like her mom.\"By the way, you went to find me by the river just now. Is there something the matter?\" Lin Hui asked.Da Qiao spoke obediently and sensibly: \"It's nothing. I want to go over and help Mom do the laundry together.\"When Lin Hui heard this, she felt extremely relieved.She reached out and rubbed her head. She softly spoke, \"I don't need your help. Mom can wash the clothes alone. Can you help mom take care of two younger brothers?\"\"Okay, I'll go back and watch my younger brothers!\" Da Qiao sweetly replied.At this moment, An Ping ran over panting: \"Da Qiao, Shen Family's little fatty is here again. Grandmother wants you to go back!\"Younger Brother Tian You is here?Da Qiao's eyes lit up: \"Mom, then I'll go back first. I'll wait for your return at home.\"Lin Hui nodded with a smile: \"Go. Mom will go back after washing the clothes.\"Then Da Qiao turned around and ran towards her cousin.Looking at her daughter's back, Lin Hui felt as if her mouth was stuffed with sweet dates. The sweetness in her mouth reached her heart....The town's deputy chief had come to Qiao's house again!The news quickly spread throughout Qili Village. Many villagers who had nothing to do came to Qiao's house to watch.Seeing Shen Family's large and small bags taken out of the car, they all voiced their envy.\"Oh my God, so many things. Qiao Family made a profit!\"\"What's the profit or not! They saved deputy chief's son. If you have the ability to save a deputy chief's son, they will give you so many things!\"\"I'm just wondering, didn't they come to give thanks last time? It's only been a while. Why are you here again?\"The doubts of the villagers were also the doubts of Qiao Xiu Zhi and Qiao Family.The last time Shen Family came over, they said they were here to give thanks. What about this time?Looking at the things the large and small bags they carried, it seems that there were more things than what was brought last time!Seeing so many things, Wan Chun Ju immediately became elated: \"Oh, there are so many things. How can I let the guests carry them like this. Let me!\"Eldest Daughter-in-law was too unreliable!Qiao Xiu Zhi gave her a cool gaze and said in a cold voice, \"Eldest's wife, come over and make a pot of tea. Then stay in the room and don't come out!\"Wan Chun Ju was struck by lightning: \u2026But Mother-in-law had already spoken. She didn't dare to resist at all and walked back to the kitchen in head turned back every three steps.After coming to the main room to be seated.Shen Shi Kai saw Qiao Family's doubts. Without dragging around, he went straight to the point and stated, \"I came here today because there is actually a very important thing I want to ask for your consent.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi said, \"Please speak.\"\"My wife likes Da Qiao very much. After seeing her, she can't forget her. Because of her health, my wife can only have You Tian in this life.\"\u00a0Speaking of this, he turned hid head to look at his wife, \"So we want to recognize Da Qiao as our goddaughter. I wonder if your Qiao Family is willing?\"At the same time, at Shen's house in the town.Shen Lin Lin was going to go to Qiao's house with her elder brother and elder sister-in-law today. But it just happened that her classmate Chu Sheng Mei came over to run errands in the town.They hadn't seen each other for more than a year. The opportunity was rare. So she had to stay at home to entertain her classmate.After chatting for a while, Shen Lin Lin took Chu Sheng Mei's hand and led her into the living room of the house: \"You can sit down. I'll make you a cup of tea. Do you still like to drink jasmine tea?\"Chu Sheng Mei merrily replied: \"Yes, I still got the same old taste. You remember it so clearly.\"She responded and sat down on the sofa.On the table in front of her, there was a sketch photo.She didn't want to touch other people's things, but when she glanced over, she found that the little girl in the sketch was very similar to her elder brother's newly adopted daughter!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58In the end, curiosity wins. Chu Sheng Mei took the sketches into hand on the table and examined it.Alike!Exactly alike!Especially that pair of eyes. They were almost identical to her little niece. And her demeanor was also very similar.Why did Shen Family have a sketch of her little niece? Or did someone look similar?Just at this time, Shen Lin Lin came out with two cups of tea.Only then did Chu Sheng Mei realize that her behavior was rude. Immediately, she stood up and apologized, \"I'm sorry. I touched something on the table without your consent!\"Shen Lin Lin didn't mind: \"It's fine. Just take it if you want to look. The little girl in the sketch is an unfortunate child who was kidnapped by traffickers. If you see someone who looks like her someday, remember to tell me!\"Chu Sheng Mei's heart thumped. Her face was a little weird: \"You mean the little girl in the sketch was kidnapped?\"Shen Lin Lin came over, put two cups of tea on the table, and sighed: \"Yes, this little girl's name is little Wan'er...\"She briefly told her friend about how little Wan'er got lost.After listening, the expression on Chu Sheng Mei's face became even more strange.The two little girls looked so similar, were about the same age, and had similar personalities. Except for the fact that her brother's little niece's parents died, the rest match.It was so similar that she can't pretend she didn't know anything.Shen Lin Lin noticed the strangeness of her friend and asked, \"What's wrong? Where do you feel unwell?\"Chu Sheng Mei bit her lip and shook her head.After a while, she seemed to make up her mind: \"I have something to tell you.\"Then she told her friend about her eldest brother and eldest sister's adopting Chu Wan.Shen Lin Lin's eyes widened when she heard the end. She grabbed her friend's hand excitedly and said, \"You said that the little niece your elder brother adopted looks a lot like the person in this sketch? And she was rescued from the traffickers?\"Chu Sheng Mei nodded: \"Very similar. The personality is very similar to your description. I have been with my little niece for half a month. She hasn't said a word to me even until now. However, my little niece has parents. What's more, the police confirmed that her biological parents had passed away. So I'm not sure.\"Shen Lin Lin bit her lower lip and thought for a while: \"Sheng Mei, I think it's better to tell Qiao Family about this matter. If it's just a misunderstanding, your family can adopt the child with more confidence in the future. If there was a mistake, I think... the child should be returned to the parents. What do you think?\"Chu Sheng Mei didn't answer immediately.She selfishly hoped that it was just a coincidence. After all, she took in how much her elder brother and elder sister-in-law loved that child.A few years ago, when her own niece died, both her elder brother and elder sister-in-law were very sad, Especially her elder sister-in-law, who almost followed the child.Now that they have finally transferred their feelings to this child. It would be cruel to take the child away from them!Seeing that her friend didn't say anything, Shen Lin Lin was a little anxious: \"Sheng Mei, I understand that you are reluctant to separate from that child, but you don't know how pitiful little Wan'er's father is. That day when he heard that my elder brother was willing to help, the grown man was crying. I heard that he had gone to the county and provincial city several times to find her. You...\"Seeing that her friend was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot, Chu Sheng Mei suddenly couldn't help laughing: \"Look at you being anxious, I didn't say I didn't want to!\"When Shen Lin Lin heard these words, she breathed a sigh of relief: \"That's great! I was so afraid of your rejection!\"This matter must be approved by her friend. She didn't want to affect the relationship between the two because of this matter!Chu Sheng Mei said: \"For a moment, I wanted to refuse. But thinking about the pain of family losing a child, I think even if my elder brother and elder sister-in-law will agree with me if they know about it!\"Shen Lin Lin was an impatient personality. She stood up and stated, \"Then let's go to Qiao's house now!\"There was only one car at home, which was driven away by her elder brother. Fortunately, there was a bicycle at home.Shen Lin Lin pushed out the bicycle, turned her head and raised her chin towards Chu Sheng Mei, \"Come on up, I'll take you!\"...Qiao's old house.After Shen Shi Kai stated his purpose of coming this time, he shut up and watched Qiao Family.Everyone in Qiao Family was very surprised when they heard that they wanted to recognize Da Qiao as their goddaughter.Wan Chun Ju was crouching under the window. When she heard this, she was very anxious.Aiya, what was with Shen Family?How much wonderful was her family An Ping? Smart and good-looking. Why didn't they want to accept An Ping as their godson?At worst, she still had two daughters. Why did they take a fancy of the calamity, Da Qiao?Just as Qiao Zhen Guo came in from outside, Wan Chun Ju hurried over and told her man about this.After listening, Qiao Zhen Guo, he sighed, \"Wife, you have to admit that our children are indeed not as good-looking as Da Qiao. It's all your fault...\"\"Stop, stop, stop! Don't talk!\" Wan Chun Ju wanted to curse when she heard the words 'it's all your fault'. \"Just tell me what to do now? How about you go in and get Mom to tell them to recognize our children as godson and goddaughters?\"Qiao Zhen Guo looked at her with the gaze of looking at a mentally retarded: \"Wife, how can you only grow flesh but not brains? Our children are neither smart nor good-looking, just like you. Why do people want them as godson and goddaughters? Wife, we must have self-awareness as a human being!\u201dAs he said that, he had a sincere expression. He raised his hand and solemnly patted her shoulder.Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Simply infuriating her to death!She had stopped him from saying \"it's all your fault\". How could he still be able to turn around and say she's stupid and ugly?The two sisters Qiao Dong Ying and Qiao Dong He who came out of the room were speechless when they heard their parents' conversation.Qiao Xiu Zhi contemplated for a while and spoke, \"You have to ask Da Qiao's parents about this.\"Shen Shi Kai and Qin Xiao Mei naturally had no objection.Just as Qiao Zhen Guo came in, Qiao Xiu Zhi immediately told him to notify old Second and Lin Hui to come.After Qiao Zhen Jun arrived, he found out that Shen Family wanted to recognize his daughter as goddaughter and was stunned for a long time: \"You aren't joking?\"Shen Shi Kai couldn't help laughing: \"If we want to make a joke, we won't use this kind of matter to. Not to mention bringing so many things over a thousand miles for a joke. We would be overboard, no?\"That was right.Qiao Zhen Jun nodded: \"Why Da Qiao?\"Shen Shi Kai raised his eyebrows: \"Why can't it be Da Qiao? Do you think the child is not good enough? Or do you think she is not cute enough?\"Qiao Zhen Jun was at a loss for words: \"As long as you really love the child, I, as a dad, will naturally not object. But the child is already sensible, so we should ask her personally about it.\"As soon as Da Qiao entered, everyone's eyes focused on her.Da Qiao greeted everyone politely.Seeing her soft and cute appearance, Qin Xiao Mei's heart instantly melted. She went up to grasped her hand and said, \"Da Qiao, do you like me and Uncle Shen?\"Shen Tian You ran over and dissatisfiedly complained, \"Mom, why did you forget me?\"Qin Xiao Mei amusedly added, \"Yes, yes! And you. Ask if Da Qiao likes you?\"Shen Tian You already knew that his parents wanted to recognize Da Qiao as his elder sister., and he was very satisfied with this arrangement: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, my parents want to recognize you as their god daughter. That is, letting you be my god-sister. Would you like to?\"Da Qiao's big eyes blinked, showing a trace of confusion. She turned to her grandmother.Qiao Xiu Zhi came over and rubbed her hair, \"Your grandfather and I don't have any objections. Your dad too. Your Uncle Shen and Auntie Qin are both good people.\"At first, when she heard that Shen Family wanted to recognize Da Qiao as their goddaughter, she was a little shocked. Soon, she was relieved after the shock.After all, their Qiao family was just commoners. There was nothing for Shen Family to conspire. On the contrary, in the eyes of the world, their Qiao Family had risen in position.They like Da Qiao so much. This was the fate of Da Qiao and Shen Family. It was Da Qiao's own opportunity. She had no reason to stop her.Da Qiao looked at the woman in front of her who was looking at her tenderly and expectant Younger Brother Tian You. She lightly replied, \"If I am to be your goddaughter, would I still be my parents' daughter?\"She liked her current family very much. She didn't want to leave them at all.Qin Xiao Mei grinned and answered: \"Of course. After becoming our goddaughter, you are still your parents' daughter. You'll still live in Qiao's house. Nothing has changed from before!\"Since it was still the same as before, there was nothing to worry about.Da Qiao blinked her beautiful misty apricot eyes and said softly, \"Then I'm willing.\"Qin Xiao Mei was instantly elated. Even happier than when Shen Shi Kai went home to ask for marriage.From today onwards, she also had a daughter!After Lin Hui came back, she felt a little sour when she saw Qin Xiao Mei hugging Da Qiao intimately and not letting go.Daughter just called her Mom. Why did a godmother arrive with a turn of a head?But soon her perspective turn.Da Qiao lived so bitterly in the past. Now the bitterness end and sweetness was here. So many people like her. It was her blessing. She should be happy for her!Qin Xiao Mei and Lin Hui were both very gentle women. After the two chatted, they quickly became bosom friends.After Qin Xiao Mei knew that the clothes that Da Qiao was wearing were made by Lin Hui, she was even more envious: \"To be honest, my hands are jinxed. Let alone making clothes, I can't do anything related to handcraft as they end up horrific!\"It was the first time that Lin Hui heard people humiliate themselves like this. So she couldn't help laughing: \"Actually, these things are very easy to do. I casually made these. It just happened that the child's birthday was today, so I rushed making it.\"Qin Xiao Mei's eyes widened: \"What? Today is my precious goddaughter's birthday? Why didn't you tell us earlier?\"It was definitely too late to go back to prepare gifts. Qin Xiao Mei touched her whole body and found nothing suitable. Then she called her son over.Shen Tian You didn't know what his mom wanted to do. To his surprise, the gold pendant on his neck would taken off by his mom as soon as he stood still.\"Son, this is a birthday present for your elder sister. Mom supplement something for you later.\" Qin Xiao Mei said as a matter of course.Shen Tian You: Are you still my mom?Because of the arrival of Shen Family, lunch was prepared even more abundantly.Xue Chuan had made red jujube cake for Da Qiao. The sweet red jujube cake was made with brown sugar and red dates. It was fragrant and soft with the fragrance of red dates.The few kids liked it very much.This meal can also be regarded as Da Qiao's godparent recognition meal. At the dinner table, she sweetly changed her addressment to godfather and godmother.Qin Xiao Mei was so delighted that her smile grinned from ear to ear. She put the gold pendant taken from her own son on Da Qiao herself.Qiao Zhen Jun felt it was inappropriate: \"This gift is too precious. You should take it back.\"Shen Shi Kai responded, \"It's just a gold pendant. Da Qiao is willing to be our goddaughter. How can we be stingy as godparents?\"Da Qiao grabbed shiny golden pendant, blinked her big eyes and said, \"Godmother, this gift is too precious. You should take it back.\"Qin Xiao Mei encountered her deer-like eyes and her heart softened: \"It's not precious. How is it precious? As long as you like it, godmother will buy you everything!\"Da Qiao saw that Godmother really didn't want to take it back, she tilted her head and thought about it. Then she leaned in and kissed her face: \"Thank you Godmother, I like it very much.\"Qin Xiao Mei's heart suddenly seemed to be thrown into the honey water. Every cell was soaked in sweetness and joy.Shen Tian You was beside his 'Sister Eagle'. Completely unaware that his mom was stolen by someone.At the opposite side, Wan Chun Ju stared at the golden pendant. Her whole person was about to turn into a sour radish.How come all the good things were taken up by the bootlicker Da Qiao?So vexing!Qiao Zhen Min sat in the corner, watching everyone's joy and laughter. His heart burst with bitterness.Don't know where his daughter will be at this time?Was she full? Dressed warmly? Would the person who kidnapped her treat her well?If it was a boy who was kidnapped, he could lie to himself and say that the child might go to a family had no son. However, little Wan'er was a girl and didn't like to talk. He really didn't dare to think deeply about what would happen to her.When he was transporting, he often heard that someone had given birth to too many daughters and sold their daughter to be a child bride. None of the children who were child brides lived well.What would he do if his little Wan'er was also sold as a child bride?Just the thought made his heart hurt so much that he couldn't breathe!He lowered his head to hide his sadness, not wanting to affect everyone's mood because of his own affairs....At Fang's house.When Fang Xiao Juan woke up, she found that she wasn't poisoned. Gratefulness and hatred brewed in her heart. She cursed Lin Hui and Da Qiao hundreds of times before walking back slowly.When she got home, Wang Xin Sheng stormed in before she could sit down and slapped her without a word!Fang Xiao Juan was stunned. The next moment her fire flared up: \"Wang Xin Sheng, you f*cking beat me again? If you don't make it clear today, I will fight with you!\"These days can't can't go on!She was bullied outside. As her man, it was enough that he didn't support her. Instead, he was rough on her!Wang Xin Sheng uttered with a livid face: \"How many times have I warned you not to go out and cause trouble again? Have you listened to my words? If you don't want to, then get out of here!\"Fang Xiao Juan was trembling with anger: \"You surnamed Wang bastard. If you hadn't kept saying that you would treat me well, how could I have been with you? Now that you have me, you don't cherish me, right?\"Wang Xin Sheng pouted and mocked: \"Fang Xiao Juan, don't say how wronged and innocent you were. If you were really a good woman, you wouldn't have slept with me before you got married! If I were a bastard, you would be a slut. Which one of us can disdain the other? But let me tell you, I'm not afraid of you going to the community to report me. So if you still want to stay in Wang's house, be obedient. If not, get out of here as soon as possible!\"After he finished speaking, he didn't give Fang Xiao Juan any chance to refute. He took the remaining cash at home, turned around and left again.\"Wang Xin Sheng, come back here!\"Fang Xiao Juan screamed at Wang Xin Sheng's back. So exasperated that she was about to explode!Pissing her off!What the hell did she married to?Fang Xiao Juan became angrier the more she thought about it. Finally, she couldn't help crying loudly with a 'WAA'.Xiao Qiao, who was cooking in the kitchen, sat in front of the stove with a look of indifference.Today was her birthday. But she had been doing housework since she woke up in the morning.No red eggs. No longevity noodles. No brown sugar cakes. Not to mention new clothes!Nothing at all!Her mom's wailing kept sounding in her ears. She didn't want to go over to comfort her at all.In the past at Qiao's house, her mom also scolded people every day. At that time she didn't feel annoyed at all because it was none of her business.At that time, the person who was scolded was Da Qiao. While she ate well and dressed well. No chores were needed to be done. So she never felt that there was any problem with her mom's character.But now, she had enough of her mom!With such a good life, she had to tossed around every day. To the point that no one could have a happy birthday!And to be able to play a good deck of cards into this messy situation, her mom was quite capable!\"Xiao Qiao, Xiao Qiao! Come here!\" Fang Xiao Juan's sharp voice came from the main room.Xiao Qiao turned a deaf ear. She stood up suddenly, turned around, and ran out.She ran to Qiao's small house in a fit of anger.But Qiao's small hosue was quiet .There was no one there.She approached and wanted to see what was going on, when a dog suddenly jumped up from the side and rushed towards her.\"Woof woof woof!\"Xiao Qiao's face turned pale with fright. If there were no courtyard doors blocking her, she would have been knocked down by this damn dog at this moment!Pi Pi continued to eye at Xiao Qiao: \"Woof woof woof...\"Since the pears in Qiao's small house matured, many people wanted to secretly pick pears. Unfortunately, they were unsuccessful.Pi Pi grew up drinking water with jade beads. Not only was it bigger than a normal dog, its hearing was also very sharp. Once the wind blow over any movement, it will immediately fly over!Now Pi Pi had become a tyrant in the village. The adults and children in the village were very afraid of it.Xiao Qiao secretly muttered some curse. She guessed that the people in Qiao's small house went to the old house.She pondered for a while before walking towards the old house.When she came to the old house, she saw that the door of the old house was opened and a group of people came out.Xiao Qiao subconsciously hid behind a big tree.Qin Xiao Mei held Da Qiao's hand and said with a look of reluctance: \"Next week on your break, godmother will get the driver to come and pick you up to stay at home in the town. Then Godmother will take you to buy a nice dress.\"Da Qiao snuggled up in the arms of her godmother. She raised her head with a sweet smile, and said softly, \"Thank you Godmother, but I have enough clothes to wear. So you don't need to buy them for me.\"Qin Xiao Mei took in Da Qiao's happily curved brows and eyes and how pure and fair her face was. Such a beautiful girl. On top of that, she said such thoughtful words. It really melt her heart.She reached out and touched the child's fair and tender face, \"You don't have to save money for Godmother. Godmother just likes to see you dressed up prettily.\"The little girl looked so good-looking. Just looking at her, her mood was good.What's more, now that Da Qiao had become her goddaughter, she will definitely dress her up so that her best friends will envy her!The onlookers were shocked when they heard the conversation between Qin Xiao Mei and Da Qiao!What?Godmother?Could it be that the deputy chief's wife recognized Da Qiao as their goddaughter?Someone secretly went to black-faced Wan Chun Ju to inquire.Although Wan Chun Ju felt sour in her heart, she couldn't help showing off in front of outsiders: \"Yes, Shen Family is very grateful to our Qiao Family for saving their son and really want to interact with our Qiao Family as relative for long term. So they recognized Da Qiao as a goddaughter.\"\"Oh, originally they took a fancy to my An Ping first. But I wasn't willing to. My An Ping is the only male grandson of Qiao Family. How can he call others Dad and Mom? It just so happens that Da Qiao knew how to bootlick and coax the whole family happy. So they recognized her!\"Some people believed Wan Chun Ju's words, while others couldn't help but pouted.Saying such big lie without writing a draft. Her tone was as sour as the old jar of vinegar. She can't bear it!But no matter why Shen Family took a fancy with Da Qiao, the result was enough to make everyone envious.\"Oh, Da Qiao is really lucky. To actually become the daughter of deputy chief!\"\"Ain't that right. I really envy to death! In the future, she will be the daughter of the deputy chief's family. She will be different from us mud-leg!\"\"Who said that Da Qiao is a calamity star? I think she is very lucky! I wonder if Fang Xiao Juan will regret it when she finds out?\"\"I think the person born with bad luck is actually Fang Xiao Juan! When she was at Qiao's house, Qiao Family met with misfortune one after another. As soon as she left, Qiao Family immediately became prosperous!\"The more one think about it, the more reasonable it seem.As soon as Fang Xiao Juan left, Qiao Family's pear tree bloomed and old Second Qiao's legs were healed. Now Da Qiao had become the deputy chief's goddaughter. While Fang Family had been unlucky again and again.Xiao Qiao, who was hiding behind the big tree, was also shocked and resentful. Her eyes were so jealous that it was similar to rabbit's red eye.It must be Da Qiao who stole her luck!Otherwise, she should be the one who became the deputy chief's daughter!After Shen Family's reluctant to part, they were about to get into the car when they saw a bicycle riding over here: \"Elder Brother, don't go in yet. I have something to tell you!\"Seeing his younger sister, Shen Shi Kai turned to his wife and said, \"Why did Lin Lin come here at this time?\"Qin Xiao Mei shook her head. Replying, that she had no clue.Once Shen Lin Lin entered the main room of Qiao's house, she breathlessly told everyone the matter. Everyone was shocked.Especially Qiao Zhen Min. His hands trembled with excitement. He approached Chu Sheng Mei with red eyes and spoke, \"This miss, did you say your elder brother's adopted daughter is very similar to this sketch?\"Chu Sheng Mei was startled by his appearance, but soon calmed down. She nodded and responded, \"Yes, there are eighty to ninety similarities. The personality matched to what you described. But you heard it just now, my elder brother's adopted child's parents have passed away. So... don't hold out too much hope.\"Qiao Zhen Min took a deep breath and stated, \"I know, I know. But I still want to confirm it myself.\"With so many coincidences, he couldn't convince the other party that it wasn't little Wan'er. So he had to see it with his own eyes before giving up!Chu Sheng Mei nodded to indicate her understanding: \"This is no problem. My elder brother and elder sister-in-law took Wan Wan back to my elder sister-in-law's maternal home. There is no way to call them and tell them about it. They will not be back until two days later. However, you can follow me back to the provincial city now. When we get to the provincial city, they will come back just in time.\"Qiao Zhen Min nodded like a woodpecker: \"Okay, okay. I'll pack up and go with you!\"Because Chu Sheng Mei was an unmarried miss, it was inconvenient for Qiao Zhen Min to go alone with her. So Qiao Xiu Zhi decided to go together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59Qiao Zhen Min sought the production team leader, Wang Shui Sheng to ask for two letters of introduction that day. Then he went to town with his mom.Chen Qiao Qiao originally wanted to join them. One, her health didn't allow her to. Second, too much money were spent recently on these trips. One more person going meant more money spent. Third, little Wan'er wasn't close to her. So it didn't matter if she went or not.Chen Qiao Qiao watched her husband's departing back. Her anxiety and panic didn't diminish at all.There had been no news about little Wan'er before. She was worried and feared that Qiao Zhen Min would divorce her.But now that there was news, she was still afraid.She always felt that they as husband and wife seemed to have embarked on a fork in the road. The further they went, the wider the distance was between them.Wan Chun Ju quietly came over and whispered in her ear, \"Qiao Qiao, I don't think you look so well. Why don't you give me the pigsty work. You can rest at home for a few days?\"Chen Qiao Qiao was startled and inwardly called her sick. She turned around and looked at her, \"Eldest Sister-in-law, why do you want to work in the pigsty so much?\"Wan Chun Ju was afraid of her catch on on something. She pretended not to care and replied, \"What why? I'm just being good intentioned. Why are you looking at me like this?\"Good intention?Can't believe she can actually uttered this!The more she was like this, the more Chen Qiao Qiao felt something was up: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, is there something in the pigsty that you really want?\"Immediately, Wan Chun Ju was nervous. Her voice suddenly became louder: \"What nonsense are you talking about? What can a pigsty have? You think too much. I'm too lazy to talk nonsense with you!\"After speaking, she quickly turned around and ran as if a ghost was chasing behind her.Chen Qiao Qiao suspiciously eyed the fleeing big butt.Xiao Qiao originally wanted to sneak out from behind the big tree after the people left, but she was discovered!\"Oh, isn't this Xiao Qiao? Why are you hiding here?\"\"It turned out to be Xiao Qiao. That's right, why are you sneaking like a thief? Qiao Family is also your home, why don't you go in?\"\"In the past, when old Second Qiao and Fang Xiao Juan weren't divorced, Xiao Qiao was a well-known child prodigy. At that time, Da Qiao was still a little stutterer. Now the two sisters have switched around. Xiao Qiao is becoming less and less pretty. While, Da Qiao became the goddaughter of the deputy chief. Tsk tsk tsk, if it's not the end, no one knows what will happen!\"\"I used to think that Xiao Qiao was smart and well-behaved. It would be nice if I could have a daughter like her. But now it seems that no matter how smart she is, she can't compare to someone else's luck!\"\"Yes, yes. That's what I think too. Don't say I'm slow to react. In fact, I used to think that Da Qiao looked more blessed. Xiao Qiao's chin is too pointed. If it's back then, those major household won't choose this kind as daughter-in-law!\"Xiao Qiao's face turned black: \"...\"Bunch of idiots!Can't they wait until she is gone?Qiao Zhen Jun was going to go back to Qiao's small house. When he heard someone mention Xiao Qiao's name, he looked back and saw his youngest daughter standing under the big tree.She was wearing old clothes and had sallow face.He instantly felt uncomfortable.Although this child was a bit ruthless and indifferent, she was still his own child. How can he as a dad be happy when he see her living so badly?He turned around and walked back. He asked her, \"Why did you come here?\"Xiao Qiao looked up at her dad. Tilting her head, she said softly, \"Today is Elder Sister and my birthday. I wanted to come over and give her my best wishes. But when I came over, I saw so many people surrounding Elder Sister. I... I didn't go then...\"Her thin and small appearance coupled with her unsightly face made her look even more pitiful. People couldn't help but feel distressed.\"Although you followed your mom, Qiao's house is still your home. Next time you come over, you can just go in directly.\"Although Qiao Zhen Jun was angry before, he as parents was unable to resist their children. When he saw her like this, his heart softened.Xiao Qiao lowered her head and twiddle her toes on the ground. Her voice became more and more quiet: \"But Grandmother... she doesn't like me coming here.\"She now realized that her mom was unreliable and intended to repair the relationship with Qiao Family. Her grandmother played an important factor. If she didn't agree with her return, others will definitely not accept her!Qiao Zhen Jun frowned and said, \"No. Your grandmother is the most fair. As long as you don't make trouble like your mom, your grandmother will welcome you here.\"\"...\"Xiao Qiao felt very uncomfortable when she heard this. Her father was being sarcastic with her?In fact, Qiao Zhen Jun didn't have that intention at all.It was just that some people have a guilty conscience. So when they hear what other say, it seem to be mocking them.Xiao Qiao's face instantly pulled down. She stated coldly, \"Let's not talk about it. I'm going back to do housework.\"She said this intentionally to make her dad feel guilty.It was a pity that Qiao Zhen Jun didn't feel anything wrong when he heard this. After all, children in rural areas usually have to help with housework.Besides, when Da Qiao started doing housework when she was three years old. Now Xiao Qiao also helped with housework, he felt very relieved.He reached out his hand to pat Xiao Qiao's head: \"Very good. You are now more sensible than before. Know how to help adults with household chores.\"Xiao Qiao: \"...\"This pissed her off!She didn't want to talk to her dad anymore. She turned around and left.After waiting for her to leave, Qiao Zhen Jun abruptly slapped his forehead. He turned and ran toward the old house.He found Da Qiao and said, \"Da Qiao, your younger sister came to wish you a happy birthday just now. But she is gone now. Dad was thinking, can you share some of these snacks with your younger sister?\"Da Qiao was stunned when she heard Younger Sister came to give her birthday wishes. Still, she had always been a generous child.So when she heard her dad ask her this, she nodded and sweetly said, \"Dad, take it. Anyway, there is so much that our our family can't.\"Qiao Zhen Jun was very relieved that the child didn't hog it alone and have sisterly love: \"Good girl. Dad will take it over.\"Qiao Zhen Jun chose some candies and biscuits. As for the valuables such as malted milk, he didn't touch.Taking these candies and biscuits, he ran after Xiao Qiao and pushed the things to her sight, \"Take it. This is what Shen Family bought for your elder sister. I asked your elder sister. Your elder sister is willing to share them with you.\"Xiao Qiao stared at the things in front of her. A feeling of being humiliated brewed in her heart!Since when was she so pitiful that she needed Da Qiao to help her?She used to eat, drink and dress well while Da Qiao looked at her enviously. Sometimes when she was in a good mood, she would give something to her. At that time, Da Qiao would always be grateful to her.So Da Qiao was now trying to humiliate her with these things?Seeing that she wasn't moving, Qiao Zhen Jun urged, \"Hurry up, what's up with you, child? Did you go silly from joy?\"The last sentence completely tore apart Xiao Qiao's forced calmness. Her face flushed red. She reached out and waved her hand...\"SLAP!\"The candies and biscuits in Qiao Zhen Jun's hands flew to the ground.Xiao Qiao stated with a cold face: \"I don't want your stuff!\"After she finished speaking, she turned and ran.Qiao Zhen Jun watched his younger daughter's departing back. His face became a little unsightly....Qiao Xiu Zhi and Qiao Zhen Min reached the town with Shen family.Because Chu Sheng Mei still had things to do, they couldn't go to the county city right away. So they had to stay in the town for one night before catching a ride to the county city tomorrow.Qiao Xiu Zhi originally wanted to go to a hotel, but Shen Family was unwilling no matter what. In the end, the kindness couldn't be refused and the mother and son stayed at Shen's house.Shen Family was really wealthy. Their place had four bedrooms, one living room, and a large yard. Quite spacious.Although Qiao Xiu Zhi and Qiao Zhen Min guessed that Shen Family was rich, they never thought that they would be this rich.Qiao Zhen Min whispered to his mom: \"Mom, you said before that Da Qiao child is blessed. I didn't quite believe it, but I believe it now!\"If she wasn't blessed, how could a rural child be recognized as a goddaughter by a family like Shen Family?But he wouldn't be jealous of his niece's luck in the slightest. On the contrary, he hoped that she was really a lucky star, so there are hope that Xiao Wan'er would be found!Qiao Xiu Zhi acknowledged with an \"en\" and said nothing else.In her heart, she felt that Shen Family was the blessed one out of the the god-relationship. As long as they were sincere and good to Da Qiao, there would always be a time to surprise them in the future!Shen Family was very hospitable and warm. They made a very sumptuous dinner to entertain Qiao Xiu Zhi and her son.Qiao Xiu Zhi and Qiao Zhen Min stayed at Shen's house for one night. The next day they joined Chu Sheng Mei and took a ride to the county city.On the third day, they arrived at the provincial city by bus. At the provincial city, they stayed for a night. It was not until the fourth day that did they catch a ride to Nanshan County.Chu Tian Bai was a little surprised to see his younger sister bringing back two strangers: \"Sheng Mei, are they your friends?\"Chu Tian Bai had never met these two before. When he saw Qiao Zhen Min, he felt a sense of familiarity. But he couldn't remember where they met.Chu Sheng Mei's head felt a little big now. She grasped her elder brother's hand and said, \"Elder Brother, I have something to tell you!\"Seeing his younger sister's expression, Chu Tian Bai wondered if she had done something to offend the two people in front of him.But before he could speak, Dong Xue walked out with daughter Chu Wan in her arms: \"Why do I seem to hear Sheng Mei's voice?\"Qiao Zhen Min saw a young and slender woman walking out of the room with a little girl in her arms. His eyes' focus fell on the little girl. His whole body trembled with excitement.The little girl was lying on the shoulders of the woman. Still, how could Qiao Zhen Min not recognize this back. It was his little Wan'er!\"Little Wan'er! Little Wan'er! It's Dad...\" His voice trembled as badly as his body.Chu Tian Bai frowned when he heard Qiao Zhen Min's words. He turned to look at his younger sister and said, \"What's going on? Who are they?\"Dong Xue became vigilant and held her daughter tightly as she stared at them, \"Who are you?\"Her daughter, who had been quiet in her arms, struggled at this moment.Chu Wan turned her head and looked at the person behind her.She didn't move at first. Her expression was blank. Nor did she make a sound. However, her eyes were fixed on Qiao Zhen Min.Qiao Zhen Min's eyes were red. He stretched out his hand to her: \"Little Wan'er, it's Dad. Do you still remember Dad? That day Dad went to buy you wontons at the station and you disappeared when I came back. Dad has been looking for you all this time. \u2026\u201dChu Wan still did not speak.Dong Xue became extremely uneasy.She didn't know who the man in front of her was. But after being with daughter for so long, she could sense her daughter's changes.Daughter knew the man in front of her!Why did this man claim to be Wan Wan's dad. Weren't Wan Wan's parents already dead?She subconsciously wanted to hide her daughter. She had already lost a daughter and couldn't bear to lose one again!She hugged Chu Wan and turned around to run in.Qiao Zhen Min stretched out his hand to stop her, but was halted by Chu Tian Bai: \"I don't care who you are, but I advise you not to move!\"Qiao Zhen Min watched his daughter disappear from his eyes again. His vision went red and the blue veins on his forehead were bulged.At this moment, Chu Wan, who was carried away, cried out with out with a 'WAA': \"Dad! I want Dad...\"Hearing their daughter suddenly speak, Chu Tian Bai and Dong Xue were both delighted. After that delight, there was a thump.This \"Dad\" didn't seem to refer to Chu Tian Bai. Instead, it was this stranger in front of them!The couple looked at each other. Both saw the heaviness in each other's eyes.Chu Wan cried so hard that Dong Xue couldn't carry her away. She could only carry her back.Qiao Zhen Min stated to Chu Tian Bai with bloodshot eyes: \"That's my daughter. My little Wan'er. Let me hug her!\"After he finished speaking, he stretched out his hands towards little Wan'er. Little Wan'er naturally leaned towards him.She leaned out of Dong Xue's arms and almost falling to the ground. Dong Xue had no choice but hand her to the man in front of her.Qiao Zhen Min hugged little Wan'er carefully, as if hugging a fragile glass bottle.Then he firmly held his daughter in his arms with all his strength like he was afraid that if he let go, his daughter would disappear from his eyes again.Chu Tian Bai sighed. He turned around and asked his younger sister, \"Tell me what happened.\"When Chu Sheng Mei told the story, the group had already entered the living room of Chu's house.Chu Tian Bai wanted to say that Qiao Family must have made a mistake. But seeing his daughter quietly staying in the man's arms, he couldn't say those words.Qiao Xiu Zhi hadn't spoken since she came and finally opened her mouth: \"Mr. Chu, you have seen it. This child is indeed our Qiao Family's lost child, Qiao Dong Wan. As for why she placed under the name of a couple who died of illness, I think there's something not right in this matter!\"Most likely the trafficker was lying!Chu Tian Bai also thought of this: \"I will get someone investigate this matter. But before the investigation is done, you must stay in Chu's house.\"Although he already knew in his heart that Wan Wan was most likely the other party's daughter, he still didn't want to give up until it was a concrete fact!After Dong Xue knew the truth of the matter, she covered her face and sobbed outright.Although they have only been together for more than two months, she really liked Wan Wan. She really thought of her as her daughter.Wan Wan didn't like to talk. She and her husband have discussed taking her to the capital to find a doctor later. Unexpectedly,...Seeing his wife crying like this, Chu Tian Bai felt pained and walked over and put his arms around his wife's shoulders.Dong Xue cried and threw herself into her husband's arms despite many watching eyes.Seeing how sad her elder brother and elder sister-in-law were, Chu Sheng Mei lowered her head. Her heart immersed in guilt and remorse....Little Wan'er was abducted to Nanshan County to sell. It was the Nanshan County's police station who handled the matter.With his identity as deputy county magistrate, Chu Tian Bai can get the police station to re-investigate the case as long as he open his mouth.In prison. After being beaten a few times, Cousin Hua couldn't stand it anymore and spit out the truth.After listening to this, everyone was so angry that their teeth itch. They were tricked by a trafficker!Old woman Hua sold little Wan'er and got a sum of money. After that, her elder cousin sister was arrested and put in jail. She was scared to death and worried that her elder cousin sister would rat her out.But in order to get old woman Hua to take care of her grandson, Cousin Hua didn't rat her out. On top of that, she also told her where she hid her savings. The only requirement was to take good care of her grandson.It went without saying old woman agreed. After that, she immediately rushed to her cousin's house and took out the money.Oh my god. She didn't expect her cousin to hide so much money. A total of one thousand yuan!She had never seen so much money in her life!When she got hold of the money, her hands were shaking.Having her cousin's house, she didn't want to go back to Shannan Village. She brought her son over to live in her cousin's house at once.Living in her cousin's house and spending her cousin's money! How awesome life was!As for cousin's grandson, he was just a child. Give him whatever to eat and it was enough. Of course, he can only eat the mother and son's leftover.Craving meat? Don't even think about it!That day, old woman Hua was scolding little Gou Dan, her cousin sister's grandson: \"You idiot who only know how to eat every day. Just told you do something and you almost set the kitchen on fire. Don't think about eating tonight!\"Little Gou Dan twisted his neck up and glaringly retorted, \"You used my grandmother's money and won't let me eat. I'll tell my grandmother next time!\"Old woman Hua jumped up, raised her hand and slapped him in the face: \"Little brat. Let me tell you, your grandmother can forget about coming out in her life! If you are obedient, I can give you a bite to eat. If you aren't, I'll sell you later!\"Her cousin was in her fifties. Who knows if she can live to be released from prison in twenty years.In other words, all the money for this house belonged to her and her son. As for this Gou Dan, she'll sell him to the traffickers when she find him an eyesore some day!There was a slap print on Gou Dan's egg face. He glared at old woman Hua viciously and spat at her: \"Old witch, go die!\"Old woman Hua became enraged that her face turned red. She picked up the wooden stick on the ground and was about to hit him. At this moment, there was a knock on the door.Old woman Hua shot daggered gaze at Gou Dan: \"Little bastard, wait for me. See how I'll deal with you!\"After she finished speaking, she went to open the door.She was about to ask who it. Once the door opened, two men broke in and grabbed her arm.Old woman Hua let out a shriek: \"Who are you? Someone come! Robbery happening!\"A policeman kicked old woman Hua: \"I advise you to save it. You can shout all you like when you're at the police station!\"Police station...Hearing these two words, old woman Hua's body went softened and a stream of yellow urine flowed out of her pants. Her face was as white as paper.When the two policemen saw that she was actually scared to the point of peeing, they were all disgusted.The case soon came to light.Cousin Hua's identity as a human trafficker was discovered. She had sold hundreds of children. No wonder she was able to save more than 1,000 yuan!With this many sin, she was getting executed instead of being imprisoned for 20 years.Although old woman Hua sold little Wan'er, she only did it once. The circumstances were relatively light. So she was only sentenced to ten years.Old woman Hua felt she was very fortunate. She was only fifty years old now. She will be sixty in ten years. She will definitely live until getting released from prison!But before she could feel smug, she was backstabbed to death by her elder cousin sister!Cousin Hua learned from the police that old woman Hua lived in her house and spent her money, but hadn't treat her grandson well. She couldn't help but become infuriated!She couldn't live anymore, while old woman Hua was only sentenced to ten years. Once old woman Hua get released, maybe she would continue to bully her grandson. So she decided to take old woman Hua to hell with her!Old woman Hua's eyes widened. She stared at her elder cousin sister in disbelief: \"You...\"Cousin Hua took out a small knife and stabbed it hard: \"You dare to abuse my grandson? See how I'll kill you for abusing my grandson!\"After stabbing old woman Hua, she committed suicide without waiting for the police to come.Old woman Hua didn't close her eyes upon her death. Obviously she couldn't rest in peace....The case was solved. Little Wan'er was proved to be Qiao Family's child. Chu Family no longer had any reason to keep her.The day had finally come to part ways.Dong Xue had been crying for a good few days. Now seeing Qiao Family carrying little Wan'er away, she burst into tears again.Chu Tian Bai wrapped his arm around his wife's shoulders and comforted her in a low voice, \"It's okay. Don't cry. You know that it is best for Wan Wan to return to her family.\"Dong Xue threw herself into her husband's arms and responded, \"I know. I'm just... reluctant to...\"Qiao Zhen Min saw how sad Chu Family was and knew that they really liked little Wan'er.What's more, he have to thank them for this matter. If it wasn't for them, little Wan'er would have been sold to deep mountain as a child bride. If that really happened, he would never find her in this life.He remembered that Shen Family recognized Da Qiao as their goddaughter. After a moment of solemnness, he spoke, \"If you want, you can recognize little Wan'er as your goddaughter and we interact as relatives in the future.\"Dong Xue raised her head from her husband's arms. Her eyes were red: \"Can we? Are you really willing to let little Wan'er be our goddaughter?\"Qiao Zhen Min seriously nodded: \"Little Wan'er was rescued by you. This kindness will have to be repaid by her when she grows up. This child's situation is special. If more people like her, I couldn't be any more happier as a dad. How could I be unwilling?\"Dong Xue cried with joy.Chu Tian Bai glanced at him gratefully: \"Thank you. we are very willing to continue to recognize little Wan'er as our daughter!\"Even if it was just a goddaughter.Because they wanted to establish this god-relationship, Qiao Family stayed in Nanshan County for two more days.Dong Xue bought a lot of clothes and food for little Wan'er. Resulting Qiao Family's one baggage upon arrival turning big and small baggage upon return.Back in Qili Village, the villagers were shocked when they saw Qiao Zhen Min bringing back his daughter!She had been lost for more than two months and still can be found!Qiao Family was too lucky, right?\"Old Fifth Qiao, how did you find your daughter?\"\"That's right. Tell everyone. Did the deputy chief help you?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi and Qiao Zhen Min didn't say anything. They went straight back to Qiao's house with little Wan'er in their arms.As soon as they walked into the yard, Da Qiao rushed up and cried, \"Grandmother, I miss you so much. You're finally back!\"Having a delicate and soft dumpling jumping into her arms, Qiao Xiu Zhi's heart softened at once. She reached out and rubbed her head, \"Have you been good when grandmother isn't home?\"Da Qiao nodded. Her voice sweetly uttered, \"Yes. I've always been good.\"When Wan Chun Ju heard this, she secretly muttered 'bootlicker'.Beside her, Chen Qiao Qiao looked at her dusty husband and daughter. Her whole body seemed to be frozen and motionless.On the day little Wan'er returned to Qiao's house, three more people came to Qili Village.But this time, it wasn't the educated youth. Instead, they were transferred from reform farm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was used to accommodate wicked ones.On the farm, people work more and eat less. Generally, people who entered there will burn out within a few years.Like these wicked people, it was generally difficult for them to come out of the reform farm after entering. However, the reform farms had recently received a lot of wicked ones. The farms were small and cannot accommodate so many people.So after the community leader held a meeting to discuss. The decision was to select some of the more obedient people from the wicked ones and put them in the production team.Qili Village was allocated three.The three were a family. An old man who looked to be in his fifties or sixties, a woman in her thirties, and a single digit old boy.Their clothes were covered with patches, while their faces were sallow and haggard. Completely skinny like a stick. No flesh can be seen on their faces and bodies.Especially the old man. His brows were tightly pinched. The wrinkles on his face were like marks carved by a knife. It was all over his face. His tall frame was hunched. Seem like he had experienced a grave illness.When the few people arrived, Wang Shui Sheng, the production leader, sounded the gong and called everyone from the village to gather at the threshing yard.Qiao Xiu Zhi and Qiao Zhen Min who had just returned home also went over with others.Standing on the high platform, Wang Shui Sheng pointed at the family and stated, \"These three people are wicked ones from the reform farm. They will live in our production team in the future!\"When the villagers below heard this, they immediately erupted.\"Leader, what's going on? Why are there so many wicked people sent here? What if the children get corrupted by them?\"\"Yes, yes. If the children are corrupted by them, will it affect us in the future?\"\"That's right. Why let the wicked people come to our production team? Shouldn't they go to the farm and get reformed?\"Wang Shui Sheng stretched out his hand to take control. His voice boomed, \"Be quiet. All of you be quiet! What's there to be noisy about? I haven't finished speaking yet!\"\"There isn't enough space on the farm. These people are wicked ones with education and have improved their ideological awareness. So they are allowed to leave the farm. You only need to tell the children in your family to not get into contact with wicked ones. Naturally they will not get influenced by them then! Put those words back in your stomach. Don't treat this matter lightly. If you get reported later, it's useless to come to me!\"Though everyone was still muttering when they heard this, they still remembered to instruct their family's children when they got back. Said they must not come into contact with wicked ones, otherwise it will be troublesome if they get corrupted!Wicked ones were different from educated youths. It went without saying that they cannot live in places as good as educated youths.Wang Shui Sheng contemplated about it and finally decided to arrange them to stay in the pigsty.There were a few empty houses next to the pigsty. Because the smell of being next to the pigsty was too strong, no one wanted to live there. It was perfect to arrange these wicked ones there.Moreover, no one in the production team liked to do the dung picking work. Every year, they have to draw lots to arrange this work. Now it was fine. Let this family do the dung picking work!Before taking the bad guys to the pigsty, there was a round of criticism parade according to the procedure.It was a good time to urge them to remember their identity and always remember to make progress!Although most of the villagers were simple, they immediately changed when faced with wicked people.Everyone gathered around the family of three and pointed at their noses. If it weren't for them being old, young, or a female, everyone would definitely go up and beat them.Still, this family of three had suffered a lot!After one round, the hair of the old man and the woman was all messed up. The old man had been spat on his face a few times.The woman bent over and hugged the boy tightly in her arms. Her eyes red.It was the first time that Da Qiao saw such a scene. She was so frightened that she tightly held her grandmother's hand.Qiao Xiu Zhi rubbed her hair and said, \"If you are afraid, close your eyes and don't look at it.\"Da Qiao looked at the people on the stage and asked in a low voice, \"Grandmother, are they really bad people?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi frowned, looked up and looked around. Seeing that no one was paying attention to them, she lowered her head and firmly whispered, \"No, they are not bad people!\"Da Qiao's clear and beautiful apricot eyes showed a confused look: \"Then why are they getting scolded?\"She also saw someone throwing stones at those people. The old man's forehead was hit. Although there was no blood, it was red and swollen. It looked painful.Qiao Xiu Zhi replied: \"This problem is very complicated. You just need to remember that they are not bad people. You can't bully them like other people, remember?\"This wasn't the place to discuss this. And Da Qiao was too young. So she didn't explain it to her.She had never approved of this simple and crude way of division.If Xue Chuan hadn't handed over the house to the state early or if she hadn't tried her best to protect him, he would have been classified as a wicked people and pushed to the farm for reform!Da Qiao's long and dense eyelashes blinked like a fan. She seriously nodded her head and said, \"Grandmother, I remember. I will definitely not bully them!\"After speaking, she turned her gaze back to the stage. Suddenly she encountered a pair of dark slender eyes.The boy was protected in his mom's arms. His eyes were looking at her through the crowd.His gaze was silent and cold. It seemed a little curious and surprised.Da Qiao's beautiful apricot eyes flashed. She was surprised for a moment. Then she curved the corner of her mouth and showed a comforting smile to the boy.The boy didn't seem to expect that she would suddenly smile at him. Startled, he shyly turned his head away. But soon he turned back to peek at her.Da Qiao thought he was very interesting as well as pitiful. She didn't dare to go up to stop everyone though. So she kept showing him a sweet smile, hoping that he would feel better when he saw this smile.Qiao Xiu Zhi saw how the villagers went on endlessly. She stepped forward and spoke: \"Enough. About it is enough. If you continue to beat, there will be a mishap!\"Old woman Fang and her son had been criticized last time. This time, even when her waist hadn't healed, she still rushed to the front. It was her who stoned the old man just now!Hearing Qiao Xiu Zhi's words now, she raised her almost invisible eyebrows, \"Oh, women association's head, what are you talking about? These people are wicked people. Are you defending them now?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at her coldly and retorted, \"Although they are wicked people, compared to Fang Family who forced their daughter-in-law to death, I don't think they have done anything wicked!\"After she finished speaking, she turned to Wang Shui Sheng: \"Leader Wang, I don't want to protect these people. But look at them, old and sick. If get injured due to the beating, wouldn't it be our production team who pay for them to see a doctor and provide food to feed them?\"Wang Shui Sheng nodded: \"You are right. Since they have been arranged to our production team, we will have to provide money and food if something happen!\"When everyone heard that they have to pay money and food once these people get badly damaged, they immediately stopped.They can't get enough to eat themselves. So no one was willing if they were asked to pay money and food for wicked ones!Seeing that Qiao Xiu Zhi had convinced everyone in just a few words, old woman Fang was so angry that she wanted to break out into scolding again. However, she was afraid of causing public anger. She could only quietly cursed and walked away.Unexpectedly, in less than two steps, she stepped on a piece of chicken poo and almost fell.Although she didn't fall, her waist seemed to be twisted again. For the rest of the path, screamed all the way.The old man and the woman on the stage glanced gratefully at Qiao Xiu Zhi, but did not speak.People like them, even if they were grateful, can only keep it in their hearts. If not, they will only bring trouble to the other party.The boy's eyes kept staring at Da Qiao. All he saw was Da Qiao keeping smiling at him. HThis smile made him shyly turn away his head. Still, he quickly turned back.His actions quickly caught the woman's attention.Once the three came to the pigsty, Dai Shu Fang rubbed the child's head and said, \"Why did you stare at the little girl just now?\"Huo Chi pouted and said, \"I've seen her before!\"Dai Shu Fang couldn't help laughing when she heard this. She didn't take it to heart though.This was the first time they have come to Qili production team. How could he possibly seen that little girl?She remembered the appearance of the little girl. Fair and rosy with a sweet smile. Most importantly, her eyes were clean and clear. At first glance, she was a very bright and kind child.It was a pity that their identities were wicked people. Huo Chi can't be friends with the other and play together even if he wanted to.Huo Chi ignored his mum's amused smile.He wasn't lying. He had actually seen the girl!...Qiao Family returned to the old house.Da Qiao dashed into the kitchen and quickly made three bowls of steamed eggs: \"Grandmother, Fifth Uncle, Younger Sister Wan'er, I made these steamed eggs for you. You can try them and see if they are delicious.\"She had been learning cooking with her grandfather for a few months. But since her Third Aunt came over, she had no chance to cook in the kitchen. Later, after Auntie Hui married her dad, she didn't have to do any chores.Now that her grandmother had returned from afar and there was still some time before dinner, she steamed three bowls of steamed eggs to cushion their stomachs.The golden-yellow steamed eggs were covered with soy sauce and sesame oil. They were bright in color and fragrant. Before a bite was taken, they were already hooked.Qiao Xiu Zhi had always favored Da Qiao in her heart. Now seeing her so sensible and caring, her heart became even softer: \"Grandmother is trying now. It smells delicious. Must be delicious!\"Da Qiao smiled with crescent eyes and softly spoke, \"I put a few drops of sesame oil in it. The smell of sesame oil is extremely fragrant!\"The sesame oil was brought to them by Shen Family. There were only two small bottles in total.Therefore, when Wan Chun Ju heard her words, she immediately cried like a hen: \"Da Qiao, you prodigal girl! Just having a steamed egg and you drip sesame oil. Landlord of past can't enjoy it like you!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi said with a cold face: \"According to you, I can't have these drops of sesame oil?\"Wan Chun Ju's body shook, shrank her neck, and responded, \"Mom, I didn't talking about you. I mean Da Qiao, this kid doesn't know how expensive firewood and rice is since she's not a family head!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi snorted coldly: \"You have been married to Qiao family for so many years. This is the first time I know that you are so considerate of Qiao Family. Then when everyone eat meat later, you don't eat it!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Being choked to half-death, Wan Chun Ju was furious and scared.When she went out, she saw her man chopping firewood, and immediately ran over to complain, \"Really, what's with Mom. Her heart is biased toward that girl, Da Qiao!\"That bootlicker, Da Qiao was also very cunning. At a young age, her flattery skills were top-notch!She made steamed eggs for Mother-in-law with eggs, firewood, and sesame oil from Qiao's old house. She didn't have to pay a penny when she made Mother-in-law smile!Really sneaky smart!If she knew earlier, she would do it first!Qiao Zhen Guo replied: \"Niece Da Qiao is pretty and has a sweet mouth. Isn't it normal for Mom to like her? If she doesn't like her, then she must like you?\"Wan Chun Ju was so exasperated that she almost vomited blood: \"What's wrong with liking me? Which part of me is unlikable?\"Qiao Stabbing Zhen Guo stated: \"Mom said that one must be self-awareness. Wife, you look like a black mountain pig. Black and fat. And your mouth likes to gossip people. Say, which part of you is likeable?\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"A mouthful of old blood was stuck in her chest. She almost acted out a scene of dying on the spot!She took a deep breath and said: \"Okay, I won't compare me, an adult with a child. Then our An Ping? No matter how pretty Da Qiao is, she's just a girl. How can one dote a girl more than one's grandson?\"There was no such logic in the world!Qiao Zhen Guo sighed, \"Oh, it's all your fault...\"\"Shut up!\"Wan Chun Ju's face flushed with anger. She stood up with her already pregnant belly, turned around and left.Every time her man started with the words \"it's all your fault\" and \"must blame you\", she can guess with her toes what he was going to say next!Qiao Zhen Guo watched his wife rushing away in a rage. Not affected at all, he continued to chop wood as he hummed a little tune.In the evening. In order to celebrate his wife's return and to celebrate finding little Wan'er, Xue Chuan personally cooked.Everyone was looking forward to it. When they smelled the fragrance from the kitchen, their saliva was about to flow out.Da Qiao and her elder cousin sister Qiao Dong He were helpers in the kitchen.Qiao Dong He sighed while burning wood: \"Younger Sister Qiao, we both learned together at the same time. Why do the things you make always taste better than mine?\"Da Qiao tilted her head and blinked: \"I don't know. However what Elder Cousin Sister makes is delicious. Don't be sad, Elder Cousin Sister.\"\"Don't worry. Elder Cousin Sister isn't one to stay depressed. I don't need your comfort.\"Qiao Dong He glanced at her fair and tender little face. She couldn't help but stretch out her hand and squeeze her.Da Qiao didn't get angry when she got pinched. Instead, she smiled so sweety that her brows and eyes were curved into crescents, melting people's whole heart.From old to young, there were a total of sixteen people in Qiao Family. One table will definitely not be able to fit them all. So like before, they were divided between two tables. One for adults and one for children.There were five dishes on both tables at this time. In the center was a large plate of pork with preserved vegetables. Followed by braised pork with potatoes, stir-fried mushrooms, fried tomatoes with eggs, and a large pot of Chinese cabbage soup.There was meat, vegetables and soup. New Year couldn't compare to this!Especially since the smell was so fragrant. Whether it was the children or the adult, they all almost drooled!\"Thank you for your hard work.\" Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at her husband. Her eyes full of longing and warmth.Xue Chuan gazed at his wife with a twinkle in eye: \"What does this hard work count as when compared to you?\"The two had been separated for almost ten days. This was the first time they have been separated for such a long time in decades of marriage. Both of them missed each other very much.Qiao Family who were fed a mouthful of dog food before eating: \"...\"Don't feed. If they keep feeding, they won't be able to eat any more!Qiao Xiu Zhi felt everyone's eyes and coughed: \"What are you looking at? Let's start?\"With this order, everyone's chopsticks immediately flew towards the meat on the plate.Wan Chun Ju clipped up a piece of meat and put it in her mouth. But before swallowing it, the chopsticks in her hand had already reached out to the plate again.However, in the next moment, nausea filled her throat. She couldn't help turning around and retched.Seeing his wife, Qiao Zhen Guo continued to eat the meat quickly and accurately. He commented while eating, \"Wife, it can't be that you are like the last time. You want to vomit at the smell of meat?\"Wan Chun Ju was like struck by lightning: \"...\"Qiao Zhen Guo's heart didn't ached for his wife. He continued to add another stab: \"Oh, why are you so unblessed? Then I have to eat more in your place!\"Wan Chun Ju was so vexed that she almost spurted blood: \"...\"Simply pissing her off!What kind of man did she marry?Wan Chun Ju didn't believe it and ate another piece. But before the meat was secured in her mouth, she retched again.Unexpectedly, just after she finished retching, Lin Hui, who was across the table, suddenly vomited too.Qiao Zhen Jun immediately put down his chopsticks and asked, \"What's wrong? Are you unwell?\"Lin Hui patted her chest and whispered, \"I don't know. But I feel a little stuffy in my chest. At the smell of meat, I immediately feel nauseous.\"Qiao Zhen Jun uttered, \"Why don't I accompany you to the clinic now.\"On the opposite side, Wan Chun Ju bit on her chopsticks. Her teeth almost fell from sourness!Qiao Xiu Zhi raised her head and said, \"Old Second's wife, it can't be that you are pregnant?\"Lin Hui and Qiao Zhen Jun were both stunned.The two's marriage hadn't reached two months yet, so they didn't consider this. But now his mom brought it up, it was really possible!Lin Hui's cheeks went pink, as if she had smeared rouge. She leaned over and whispered in Qiao Zhen Jun's ear, \"My that haven't come for more than a month.\"Her menstrual period had always been unstable before. So she didn't take it to heart when her period didn't come last month.After marrying into Qiao Family, she felt that her body was much better. Maybe it was due to her good mood.Even in summer, she often felt her hands and feet were cold. There was no trace of temperature in her whole body. Currently, her body can feel its warm. Her appetite and her sleep had also improved.Qiao Zhen Jun froze. Then his whole body glowed: \"Then let's go to the clinic now and let the doctor check!\"Da Qiao saw Auntie Hui vomiting and became worried: \"Mom, what's wrong? Shall I accompany you to the clinic with Dad?\"Lin Hui comforted her, \"Don't worry, Mom is fine.\"Wan Chun Ju's eyes were red with jealousy. She spoke in a sour tone: \"Da Qiao, your stepmom is most likely pregnant. You will soon have a younger brother or sister. At that time, they will not dote you any more!\"Lin Hui flushed even more. With anger this time: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, don't say such things to a child. If the child takes it seriously, it will be bad!\"Wan Chun Ju snorted: \"Stepmothers in the world are generally black. Where am I wrong? You dare to say that in the future, you will still treat Da Qiao well when you have your own child? Don't speak. Those words of yours can trick children. Save it, if you want to lie to me!\"Lin Hui was so angry that she trembled. She nervously looked at Da Qiao and spoke, \"Da Qiao, no matter if Dad and Mom have other children in the future, Mom likes you the most. Don't listen to your eldest aunt!\"Da Qiao blinked her bright eyes and said softly, \"Mom, don't worry. I won't listen to Eldest Aunt's words. I like younger siblings. Would you give me a younger brother and younger sister?\"Xiao Qiao was also her younger sister. She used to like her very much. But after she knew that she held bad intentions toward herself, she gradually withdrew her feelings.Lin Hui saw how delicate, sweet, and sensible the child was, her heart completely melted.When Wan Chun Ju heard Da Qiao's words, she gritted her teeth angrily: \"You stupid child, Eldest Aunt is sincerely thinking on your...\"BAM!Qiao Xiu Zhi placed the chopsticks heavily on the table. Her gaze coolly pinned Eldest Daughter-in-law: \"Go! You aren't allowed to come to the table to eat until you know where you are wrong!\"Wan Chun Ju had lightning-strike feeling again. Her face pale: \"...Mom, I know now that I was wrong!\"\"Leave!\" Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't give her another glance, \"Don't let me say the same thing a third time!\"Wan Chun Ju's face turned red and white.She nudged her man beside her, hoping that he could plead on her behalf.Qiao\u00a0'meal more important than wife'\u00a0Zhen Guo: \"Wife, hurry up. You must listen to what Mom says. Or else, you will die even worse!\"He was clipping meat while talking. Never glancing at his wife from beginning to end.A breath Wan Chun Ju was suffocated in her chest. She almost collapsed from fury!Qiao Zhen Jun was so excited that he couldn't eat. He supported Lin Hui to the clinic.After more than half an hour, the two returned to Qiao's old house. Their expression was covered with excitement and uplifting mood.When everyone saw their faces, they guessed the truth.Qiao Zhen Guo said: \"Second Younger Brother, a child can eat a lot. You have to be mentally prepared!\"Qiao Zhen Jun blushed with agitation: \"Eldest Brother, don't worry. My legs can now enter the fields. So I will definitely be able to support my wife and children!\"Qiao Zhen Min jollily exclaimed: \"Second Elder Brother, congratulations. You are really amazing. How long have you been married and you have a child so soon?\"Qiao Zhen Jun scratched his head: \"I didn't expect your second sister-in-law to be pregnant so soon! Fifth Younger Brother, it's not that Second Elder Brother want to talk about you. Now that the child has been found, the two of you should reconcile. Between husband and wife, there is no overnight feud. You should give birth to a younger sibling for little Wan'er earlier. After all, Xiao Wan'er is an only child. That's too lonely!\"Qiao Zhen Min smiled and did not respond.There was a bitter taste in his heart.After his mom's persuasion, he no longer blamed Qiao Qiao. But Qiao Qiao's actions during these days had really chilled his heart!Little Wan'er had been missing for more than two months and she had never said a word about missing the child!She was worried and afraid, not because the child was gone, but rather that he would divorce her!Therefore, he really didn't know how to continue this marriage.Da Qiao was overjoyed when she found out that Auntie Hui was pregnant with a baby!With a\u00a0thump thump thump, she rushed over and touched Auntie Hui's belly, \"Mom, is there really a younger brother here?\"Lin Hui smiled softly: \"It could also be a younger sister. Do you like a brother or a sister?\"\"Sister!\" Little Dong Lin also clustered over and stretched out his little paw to touch his mom's belly.There was already a little Yi Ming at home competing with him. So, definitely can't have anymore brothers!Little Yi Ming had the same thought. He came over and touched the belly together and spoke, \"I want sister!\"When everyone saw the appearance of the two little dumplings, they couldn't help but laugh.Especially due to little Yi Ming. It wasn't his mom who was pregnant. Why was he joining in the fun?Da Qiao tilted her head. Blinking her eyes, she stated, \"Mom, it seems that there is younger brother in belly.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61Lin Hui's eyes flickered and said, \"Okay, then Mom will give you a younger brother.\"Although she didn't say anything, she was still full of expectations when she heard Da Qiao's words.It wasn't that she preferred sons over daughters. But rather that she brought little Dong Lin along with her in this marriage and Qiao Zhen Jun had no son under his name. If it goes on for a long time, everyone will definitely have a comment or two.Some people with crooked minds might think that she wanted her son to occupy Qiao Family's assets. As an adult, she can ignore these rumors. But Dong Lin was still young. She didn't want to let him encounter this bad experience when he grow up.When Wan Chun Ju walked out of the main room, she heard Lin Hui's words. She couldn't help but curled her lips and muttered, \"Do you think a son can be born just because you want? Do you really think that you are goddess of fertility?\"After she finished speaking, she rubbed her almost six-month-old belly. The corners of her drooping mouth raised. Inside must be a son!Like this way, she has two sons. Even if Lin Hui has a son, it cannot shake her status as a greatest contributor of Qiao Family!While Chen Qiao Qiao was staring at Lin Hui's stomach with a heart full of sourness and envy.If she could have a son, maybe her relationship with Qiao Zhen Min wouldn't be so rigid!Thinking of this, her eyes flashed.Qiao Xiu Zhi took in the few daughter-in-laws' reactions, but did not speak.She didn't care whether it's a boy or a girl. As long as the child is healthy, it is enough.She and Xue Chuan looked at each other and stood up one after another. They left the room to the younger generations and entered their room.As for Qiao Family who were fed dog food from time to time, they didn't find it strange.Once they entered their room, Xue Chuan led his wife to sit down, personally went to get a pot of hot water, and then personally helped his wife take off her shoes and socks: \"After walking so far, soak in the water to relax. Later I'll give you a massage. You won't have foot pain tomorrow.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi pulled him down beside her and spoke, \"I haven't told you one more thing. Little Wan'er got recognized as a goddaughter by Chu Family.\"On the way back, she reminded her youngest son to mention this when they went back.It can't be helped that the fact Da Qiao got recognized by a deputy chief as his goddaughter couldn't be hidden. If another became goddaughter of deputy county magistrate, Qiao Family's front would be too flying too high.The gun hit the forefront bird.Too much limelight was never a good thing. So after she came back, she didn't tell Qiao Family about it.The main reason was because Eldest Daughter-in-law's mouth was too loose. Anything that reached her ears will be yelled to the whole village within a half a day!Also, the two other branches got high-ranking officials as relatives. Now only first branch didn't have any. Eldest Daughter-in-law will definitely be unable to accept it when she finds out. Maybe there will be some trouble. Not telling her was the best idea.Xue Chuan nodded to show his understanding: \"Your arrangement is good. It's a great blessing among misfortunes for little Wan'er to have such an encounter. Fortunately, she met Chu Family. If not, I wouldn't dare to think about the consequences!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded: \"It is indeed thanks to Chu Family this time. However, let her play with Da Qiao more in the future.\"She didn't know what unique adventure Da Qiao had experienced. But as long as people who were truly kind to her, they will slowly develop in a good direction.For example, old Second's legs. This matter had created a stir among the people in the village.Someone who was originally going to be paralyzed for the rest of his life suddenly stood up. If feudal superstitions weren't disintegrated now, people might say all kind of things.Another was little Yi Ming. Little Yi Ming burned his brain when he was three years old. He couldn't remember things at all. Nor could he recognize people. Now he recognized everyone in the family!From what Hong Xia said, little Yi Ming can now count numbers from one to ten. This was a great improvement!...The night was getting darker.Da Qiao followed her parents back to Qiao's small house. After washing up, the people in the old house gradually fell asleep.Qiao Zhen Min was tired for many days.Before returning to home, he had never slept peacefully. He feared that his daughter would disappear from sight once he closed his eyes.Now that he was home and looking at his daughter who was rosy in her sleep, his on-edge heart settled back into place.Suddenly, a hand stretched out from behind and hugged his waist: \"Zhen Min, I know I'm wrong. So please forgive me this time.\"Chen Qiao Qiao's voice had an obvious tremble.Qiao Zhen Min sighed in his heart, pulled her hand away and turned to look at her: \"Mom is right. You and I are responsible for this matter. I don't want to pursue the past, but in the future... I hope you put more heart into minding the child.\"Chen Qiao Qiao repeatedly nodded and quickly replied: \"I will. I will be very good to the child in the future.\"Qiao Zhen Min said: \"Okay, I believe you this time.\"He did feel a little offput by the fact that she lost the child. Still, life must go on. Unless he wanted to get a divorce, he would have to overcome this hurdle himself.So he was willing to give each other another chance. Besides, with the way little Wan'er was, it was not good for little Wan'er whether he get divorced or remarry after divorce.After blowing the oil lamp, the two went to bed.Qiao Zhen Min yawned. Drowsiness soon came.Just as he was about to fall asleep, a hand reached out from behind again.He instantly woke up from drowsiness, reached out and took her hand away and stated, \"I'm very tired today.\"He couldn't understand what was going on in her mind more and more!He had been toiling around for so many days and she didn't express a word of concern. Why did she want to do that as soon as they laid down?However, Chen Qiao Qiao felt like a basin of cold water was poured over her head in winter. Her whole heart was cold.Her eyes felt sour and uncomfortable. She wanted to ask him, was he still blaming her for losing the child, right?But she dared not ask.The atmosphere suddenly became awkward.Qiao Zhen Min moved his body and whispered, \"Go to sleep.\"\"En.\" Chen Qiao Qiao responded with choked sobs as she held back her tears.She looked at her man's icy back. Finally tears flowed silently.Chen Qiao Qiao wasn't the only awake in the middle of the night. There was also her sister-in-law.Being kicked off the table by her mother-in-law today, Wan Chun Ju lost all face. Although she was often embarrassed, she was still very mad!And what's even more infuriating was that she was somehow jinxed recently. Why can't she eat meat?With so much meat at home, she couldn't eat a piece of it. What a shame!She tossed and turned. Just couldn't fall asleep. In addition, the pregnant woman's belly was getting bigger. She also would have frequent toilet urge. Not long after she lay down, she suddenly wanted to pee again.She had to get up. After using the toilet, she lay down on the bed again. Seeing that her man was sleeping soundly, she was envious and itched with hate. She couldn't resist pushing him awake.Drowsily, Qiao Zhen Guo glanced at her and uttered, \"Wife, what are you doing when you should be sleeping in the middle of the night?\"Wan Chun Ju grudgingly said, \"Why didn't you plead for me at the dinner table today?\"Qiao Zhen Guo murmured, \"Wife, with your long-tongued nature, it's useless to plead. You will still talk nonsense later.\"Wan Chun Ju was so angry that she almost spurted blood: \"...\"Qiao\u00a0wild stabbing demon\u00a0Zheng Guo flipped over as he added, \"Wife, you should go to bed earlier. If not you will have mouth sore again the next day!\"Wan Chun Ju was so vexed that her face turned red: \"...You really can't spit out anything decent. What does not sleeping have to do with mouth sore?\"Unfortunately, no one answered her. Qiao Zhen Guo, who was sleeping next to her, snored again.The loud snoring made her even more upset. She didn't sleep well all night!The next day, a shriek broke out from first branch's room: \"Qiao Zhen Guo, you crow's mouth! I really have mouth sores!\"And it was eight of them!It hurt like hell!After Qiao Zhen Guo heard his wife's words, he rubbed his forehead and smiled proudly: \"I didn't expect my mouth to be so accurate. If it were before, I could be a fortune teller!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"What kind of person did she married to?How infuriating!...Da Qiao was carrying her schoolbag and followed her cousins to school. When she passed the pigsty, she saw the boy staring at her again.The boy was picking dung with his mom and grandfather. When he saw her coming, his gaze fell on her again. He didn't seem to feel embarrassed because he was picking dung.Qiao Dong Ying noticed. She nudged her hand and joked: \"Da Qiao, look. That boy over there has been watching you!\"An Ping followed his sister's gaze. As expected, he saw a boy staring at his family's younger sister. Immediately, he rolled up his sleeves angrily: \"Stinky boy! Watch where you are looking at. Try looking around again and see how I'll sort you out!\"Huo Chi didn't flinch. His pair of slender dark eyes kept staring at Da Qiao.An Ping felt that he was being ignored and stomped with anger: \"Stinky boy, didn't you hear what I said? Randomly look around again and I'll beat you up!\"Huo Chi finally spoke, \"I didn't randomly look around.\"He only looked at that one girl. Didn't look at any one else.An Ping felt that this person was either stupid or deliberately trying to find fault. He rolled up his sleeves and was really going to beat him up. However, Da Qiao stopped him.\"Elder Cousin Brother, let's go quickly. We'll be late in a while!\"Da Qiao also felt it was strange that the boy kept staring at her.She didn't feel any malice in the other party's eyes though. So the other party could look at it if he wanted to. She wouldn't lose a piece of meat.Younger Cousin Sister's voice was soft and sweet. No matter how big the fire was, An Ping couldn't flare up. Besides, he couldn't be late again this month, or the teacher would come over for a home visit!He glared at the boy and declared, \"Hmph, I'll spare you this time. Next time, watch out for my fist!\"After saying that, he ran.Da Qiao turned back her head and smiled embarrassedly at the boy.She always remembered what her grandmother said; wicked ones aren't bad. Seeing the family of three picking dung, she felt they were quite pitiful.Especially the old man. He was working while coughing. He seemed to be sick.Huo Chi watched Da Qiao's back and thought to himself; so her voice was like this. Like glutinous rice cakes. Soft and smooth.He had really seen this girl. However, it was only in a dream.Ever since he could remember, he dreamed of a little girl every year. At first he didn't care, but after increased occurrences, he gradually became interested.At the beginning, the little girl was thin. Her face was very sallow. At that time, he thought she was a wicked one like himself, living in a labor reform farm.No matter how he asked the little girl, the little girl remained silent.It wasn't until half a year ago, when the little girl reappeared in his dream, she was completely different. She grew taller and looked better!She smiled sweetly at him in his dream. Still, she didn't speak.He thought she was just someone he had dreamed up. Surprisingly, she appeared in front of him in person one day!On that day, he was so surprised that he thought he was dreaming a few times. But the cursing voices in his ears told him that all this was not a dream!He couldn't figure it out even until now. How did he dream about a girl who he hadn't seen for a good few years?The sound of grandfather's coughing came from behind him. He immediately recovered his senses and ran over, \"Grandfather, go and rest for a while. I'll help you pick!\"Huo Hua Qing coughed so much that his lungs almost came out. But when he heard his grandson's words, his heart felt soothed.He reached out to rub his grandson's hair, but noticed his hands were dirty. So he had to give up: \"No need. Grandfather is fine. You are still young. You can't do this kind of manual work or you won't grow taller in the future!\"Huo Chi responded: \"I'm not afraid. Grandfather, go and rest. Your cough is getting worse and worse!\"Dai Shu Fang came back with two big baskets. She panted with a pale face: \"Dad, just listen to Chi'er and go to rest for a while. Leave here to me! Chi'er, take your grandfather to the side and rest.\"Huo Hua Qing looked at his skinny daughter-in-law and his heart was full of guilt.Daughter-in-law used to be a delicate and weak young lady. What need was there to do such rough work?It would be great if Son was still alive. He, an old bone, can't protect the mother and son. Instead, he dragged them down!Huo Chi helped his grandfather over to take a sneaky rest. But he didn't rest himself. He went back to help his mom shovel pig dung.Dai Shu Fang had persuaded a few times, but the child was very stubborn. She could only sigh and drop the persuasion: \"Your grandfather has been sick for a long time this time. If this continues, I'm afraid it will be bad!\"If he keep coughing like this, his lungs will definitely not be able to take it.But they were wicked ones. Unless they were really sick, the production team would definitely not call a doctor for them!Huo Chi gritted his teeth tightly. He thought about finding time to go to the mountains to see if he could find herbs.But they had just arrived here. Everyone was watching their every move. He didn't dare to run around. If caught, they may be sent back to the farm!He didn't want to go back to that damn place in his life!...Although Qiao Family only raised two old hens, the two old hens were like shot with adrenaline and laid five or six eggs every day since they drank the jade bead water.Now that the weather was getting warmer, the eggs can't be stored for too long. Nor can they be sold. Her grandmother made the decision and declared that the children each gets a boiled egg.She now had a boiled egg in her schoolbag. Usually, she ate it at noon. But she remembering the boy's family, and put back the egg she took out.After school.She went back to Qiao's small house. From the kitchen, she secretly took a few coarse meal mantou and stuffed them into her schoolbag. Then, she slipped out of the door while the two younger brothers weren't at home and headed towards the pigsty.She remembered what her grandmother said; this family wasn't bad people. But because of the special circumstances, others cannot see her getting in contact with them as it will cause trouble.Therefore, all the way, she was like a thief. Her eyes kept paying attention to the movements around her.Fortunately, the pigsty side was relatively out of the way. And the smell was terrible. Even children didn't like to play in this area.There was no one outside the pigsty, so Da Qiao tiptoed over. She took out the egg and the mantou from the schoolbag and secretly put them at the door before turning around.But after walking two steps, she felt that the place was unsafe. She turned around and picked up the things and put them on the grass on the side.But the grass was covered by grass. She was worried that the other party wouldn't notice it. She took the egg and mantou into hand and turned around in circles.Huo Chi heard the movement from inside. He assumed a child came to abuse them again. When he came out, he saw such a scene.The little girl in the dream was holding eggs and a few coarse meal mantou. Like a lost animal, she circled in circles. Appearing a bit silly, and a bit... cute.\"What are you doing there?\"Hearing the sound, Da Qiao was startled. She turned around with her eyes widened: \"When did you come out?\"Huo Chi answered: \"When you are going around in circles.\"There were two red clouds on Da Qiao's face. She whispered a little embarrassedly: \"I... I'm looking for a place to hide egg and mantou.\"Hearing the word \"egg\" and \"mantou\", Huo Chi subconsciously swallowed: \"Why hide it?\"Da Qiao blinked her big dark eyes and softly replied, \"I want to give you egg and mantou to eat. So I want to find a place to hide where you can see but others can't.\"Obviously such a place was hard to find.Huo Chi looked at her with slender eyes: \"Why are you giving us things?\"They were not related.What's more, eggs were such a precious food. He had never eaten a egg since he was born. He had only seen others eat them.Da Qiao's thick eyelashes fluttered. Staring at him, she softly spoke: \"I noticed your grandfather seems to be ill. He needs to eat something good.\"If Da Qiao's actions were seen by the people in the village, some people would definitely say that she was wasteful. Maybe some people would say that she had an overly nice heart. They would even report her to the community, saying that she helped the wicked ones.However, Da Qiao didn't think there was anything wrong with her action. When she couldn't get enough to eat, it was Auntie Hui who helped her and gave her delicious food.Now that she was capable, she also wanted to help other people like Auntie Hui.Huo Chi's eyes remained on her: \"We are wicked ones. Aren't you afraid?\"Da Qiao shook her head: \"My grandmother said wicked ones aren't necessarily bad people. I don't think you are like bad people.\"The afterglow of the early summer sunset shone on Huo Chi's body and face. It smeared a bit of color on his handsome facial features, making him look a lot more gentle.No one had ever said such a thing to him since he was understood things.They were labeled as wicked ones. Others despise them, hate them, and fear them at the same time. Except for those who were also wicked ones, other people never want to say a word to them.As if they were a plague. Once they got close to them, it was they could instantly turn them into wicked ones!She was the first to tell him that he wasn't a bad person.Huo Chi was nine years old this year. He was considered nearly a teen. But because the nourishment not keeping up, he looked like seven or eight years old.At this moment, he stood facing the glow. His back was straight as his eyes looked at the little girl in front of him. His voice was a little hoarse: \"Consider it as me borrowing egg and mantou from you. I will definitely pay you back!\"Da Qiao shook her head. The two small tails on her head swayed with her movements: \"No need to pay it back. I still have it at home!\"She ran over as she spoke and put the small bundle of egg and mantou into the boy's hands: \"I must hurry back. Bye.\"After she finished speaking, she turned and ran.Huo Chi clenched the small bundle in his hand, looked up at the gradually receding back, and suddenly remembered something very important: \"My name is Huo Chi, what's your name?\"When Da Qiao heard the voice behind her, she stopped and turned to show him a bright smile: \"My name is Qiao Nian Nian. You can call me Da Qiao.\"After speaking, this time she really left and soon disappeared without a trace.Huo Chi stood at the door until he couldn't see the other person's figure at all. Only then he turned around. To his surprise, he meet with his mom's eyes.Dai Shu Fang spoke, \"I seemed to hear you talking to someone just now. Who was here?\"They had already hid in places like the pigsty, but there were some malicious people in the village who would come and scold them or throw stones at them from time to time. She was worried that her son would get into conflict with the people in the village.Huo Chi opened the concealing cloth and revealed the egg and coarse meal mantou inside, \"This is given to us by the granddaughter of the granny who spoke for us last time.\"Dai Shu Fang's eyes widened: \"So many... We have encountered a good person! Have you thanked her?\"Huo Chi's eyes froze for a moment. Then he shook his head and replied, \"I forgot.\"Dai Shu Fang reprimanded her son: \"You can forget such an important thing. Really!\"When there was a chance in the future, she must thank the other party in person. Of course, in the absence of other people, otherwise she will harm the benefactor.Dai Shu Fang looked at the food, swallowed, and urged her son, \"Hurry up and give it to your grandfather!\"In their current situation, she didn't say anything hypocritical about not taking other people's things. They really need these foods now.They can't get enough to eat every day. And her father-in-law was still sick. If they don't eat something nourishing, they might not be able to survive!Huo Chi nodded: \"Mom, you come in and eat too!\"That night, Huo Family finally had a full meal.With the insistence of his grandson and daughter-in-law, Huo Hua Qing finally ate the only egg. After eating, he suddenly felt sleepy and fell asleep quickly.Since he fell ill, he hadn't been able to sleep well and woke up several times at night from coughing. but that night, he only woke up once.He don't know if it was his delusion or not, but he felt that his body wasn't as weak and uncomfortable as before. His cough was much more relieved.In fact, this wasn't his illusion.Those steamed buns were all made with jade bead water and flour. The eggs were laid by an old hen who drank jade bead water. So they had a healing effect.It was because the jade beads weren't directly consumed, the effect was greatly reduced.Da Qiao was very happy all night because she helped others.Remembering that her godmother would pick her up to play in town this week, she was full of expectations.Who knew that when she woke up the next day, she heard a news... Her biological mom had a miscarriage!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The baby is gone. Tsk tsk tsk, so pitiful!\"Da Qiao's face instantly turned pale. She circled around the other party and wildly ran towards the house!\"Elder Sister, when did Younger Sister Da Qiao become a fast runner?\"An Ping only felt a gust of wind whizzing past him. When he looked up, his younger cousin sister had turned into a small black spot.Qiao Dong Ying was also shocked. She didn't expect Da Qiao, such a cute little dumpling, to run so fast. She might not even run as fast as her!The villager who told Da Qiao the news was also stunned. Once her mind wrapped around, she noted that Da Qiao was sprinting in the direction of Qiao's small house. She slapped her thigh and yelled, \"Oh, it's wrong. Not your stepmom. It's the mother who gave birth to you who miscarried!\"But Da Qiao was so far away and couldn't hear her.Da Qiao ran towards the house. When passing by the pigsty, Huo Chi happened to come out with a large rattan basket of pig manure as she flew directly past him.Huo Chi: \"...\"He dropped the big rattan basket and hurried to catch up. But against the speed-runner little girl, he almost ran out of breath to catch up with her: \"You... why you are running, in such a hurry? What, happened? \"Da Qiao dashed all the way and his face wasn't red or panting. She still felt that his stuttering speech was very similar to her previous self: \"My mom fell and bled. I'm in a hurry to go back to see her!\"When Huo Chi heard that something big happened at her family, he was worried for her. He couldn't help anything though. Not even accompanying her all the way!Damn it!Seeing a villager walking toward them in front, he had to stop and watch her get further and further away from him!Dai Shu Fang saw her son run out suddenly. Before she have the time to ask him, he had already run away without a trace. Now that he came back with his head down, she hurriedly asked, \"Where did you go just now? Why are you like this?\"Huo Chi raised his head and looked at his mom with his slender eyes, \"Mom, can we only be wicked ones for the rest of our lives?\"When Dai Shu Fang heard this, her throat choked. She felt so depressed that she almost shed tears.Their Huo Family had never done anything wrong to the country or the common people. Still, they ended up like this!The two words \"wicked ones\" were like two mountains pressing on their family of three. If this identity wasn't removed, they will never be able to succeed in their entire lives!She and her father-in-law were getting older. It didn't matter much in this life if they kept living like this. But Huo Chi was still young. If one day she and her father-in-law both pass, what will happen to this child?Can't let him stay in the pigsty and pick pig dung all his life, right?But if not like this, what can she do?Huo Chi took in his mom's sad expression, picked up the shovel and the big rattan basket on the side and walked back to the pigsty. He vented his anger and helplessness through work.Da Qiao rushed back to Qiao's small house. After searching around, she couldn't find anyone and became even more anxious.She hurriedly rushed out again and bolted to Qiao's old house. She almost bumped into Wan Chun Ju who came out with her arms on her waist.Wan Chun Ju's face turned pale with fright. After seeing clearly that it was Da Qiao, she immediately scolded: \"You dead girl, you're rushing to get reborn? If you bump into my stomach, can you compensate for it?\"Da Qiao quickly apologized: \"I'm sorry, Eldest Aunt. I didn't mean it! I'm in a hurry to find my mom. Do you know how she is now?\"Wan Chun Ju persisted: \"How am I to know how your mom is? I'm not her servant and serve her 24 hours a day! Also, don't change the subject. Just now, you bump into me on purpose, right?\"Maybe Lin Hui deliberately taught her to bump her belly. Once her baby is knocked off and if Lin Hui gave birth to a son, she would be able to share the weight with her equally!The more Wan Chun Ju thought about it, the more likely it felt it was. At once she flared up: \"You black-hearted thing! Actually wanting to knock off the baby in my belly. So vicious at a young age. See how I'll sort you out!\"As she said that, she glanced around quickly, saw the broom beside the courtyard gate, picked it up, and swung it at Da Qiao!Da Qiao didn't expect that her eldest aunt would put her word into action just like that. Scared, she turned around and ran away.Wan Chun Ju chased after her as she supported her belly: \"You damn girl, don't run!\"If she don't run at this time, wasn't that looking to get beaten?Da Qiao wasn't that stupid!But she didn't run very far when she bumped into her grandmother.Qiao Xiu Zhi shielded her. She looked up at Eldest Daughter-in-law who was chasing after with a broom and spoke with a heavy expression, \"What's going on?\"Wan Chun Ju shivered all over. Gulping, she replied, \"Mom! It's not my fault this time. Da Qiao, this child is too black-hearted. She actually bump into my stomach on purpose, trying to kill the baby in my belly. So vicious!\"Da Qiao frowned and retorted: \"I didn't! Grandmother, I didn't bump into Eldest Aunt's belly on purpose!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi noted her rosy face from running. She reached out to wipe her sweat and said, \"What's going on? Tell your grandmother.\"Wan Chun Ju saw that her mother-in-law was obviously leaning toward Da Qiao's side. Angered, her face was as black as the bottom of a pot!Da Qiao clearly explained: \"When I came back from school, I heard that my mom fell and bled and the younger brother in her belly is gone. I was very worried. I ran back to the small house and couldn't find anyone. So I came to the old house and ask. Unexpectedly, Eldest Aunt and I bumped into each other, I really didn't mean it. I apologized to Eldest Aunt. But Eldest Aunt didn't believe it!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi raised her head and glanced at her eldest daughter-in-law: \"How are you from the bump? Was it serious? Do you need me to take you to the hospital for a few days?\"Wan Chun Ju's face went red and white: \"...\"Actually, she had quickly dodged at that time. So Da Qiao didn't touch he belly. If not, she wouldn't be able to run so fast to chase people later.She couldn't hold back her irk. It was obviously black-hearted Da Qiao who bumped into her on purpose. Mother-in-law still protected her like this!So vexing!She was just kicked off the table by Mother-in-law the day before yesterday. Since then, she hadn't been able to go back to the table to eat. That's why, she really didn't have the courage to continue fighting.You can only swallow this breath into her stomach!Stinky girl, she'll sort her out later!After Wan Chun Ju left, Qiao Xiu Zhi explained to Da Qiao, \"Your mom is fine. It was Fang Xiao Juan who met with mishap. You don't need to go to Wang's house to see her now. She had already been sent to the town hospital.\"To be precise, Fang Xiao Juan didn't have a miscarriage. Just bleed a lot and gave birth to a dead baby on the spot!Fang Xiao Juan had been pregnant for more than seven months. At this stage, the baby had already taken shape. However, she fell too hard. That baby only cried weakly when it came out and soon died.Some said she got into a scuffle with a female educated youth named Ye Zhen Zhen. No one knew the specifics yet, but there were a lot of rumors.Some people said Fang Xiao Juan and Ye Zhen Zhen had an argument and Ye Zhen Zhen accidentally pushed Fang Xiao Juan. Which caused Fang Xiao Juan to bleed heavily on the spot.Some people also said Ye Zhen Zhen accidentally bumped into Fang Xiao Juan. It was an complete accident.The most popular version was: Ye Zhen Zhen went to seduce Wang Xin Sheng, and was caught by Fang Xiao Juan on the spot. Fang Xiao Juan and Ye Zhen Zhen fought. Ye Zhen Zhen accidentally pushed Fang Xiao Juan down and the tragedy happened.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't tell Da Qiao the information and guesses. Just told her: \"If you are really worried, wait for Fang Xiao Juan to come back to the village. Then you can go to Wang's house to see her.\"Fang Xiao Juan's actions weren't right. Not even worthy of the word \"mother\". Still, she didn't want Da Qiao to live in resentment.More importantly, people in the world always felt that \"the world was full of parents\". No matter how bad the parents were to their children, everyone felt it was normal. In the past, there were some people who even killed their children. People made some comment at most.But once the child did something wrong, the mountain of \"unfilial piety\" will come down.It was unfair. Absurd. But nothing can be done.So if Da Qiao wanted to visit Fang Xiao Juan during the time, she would not stop her. She would even prepare something for her to bring over.When Da Qiao heard that it wasn't Auntie Hui who met with mishap, she was greatly relieved.Then it came to her it was her biological mom who had an accident. She was a little stunned.She hadn't seen her mom since the her dad's wedding day.In the past, she hoped for her mom to love her as much as Xiao Qiao. But after she left, there was no more scolding or getting starved. Gradually, she dropped her expectation of her mom's love.Later, she got love from Grandfather, Grandmother, and Auntie Hui. She felt that she was so blissed and happy every day. Her mom's influence was even weaker.Only then did she realize that she hadn't thought of her mom for a long time.When the old auntie said Mom just now, she subconsciously thought of Auntie Hui. Not her biological mom.Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at her dumbfounded state and said softly: \"Don't be afraid. Fang Xiao Juan will be fine! It's getting dark, go back quickly. Don't let your parents worry.\"She lied.When Fang Xiao Juan was carried away, she was covered in blood and her face was as white as paper. It seem the situation was very bad.Ye Zhen Zhen and Wang Xin Sheng, who were in the same room together, were so scared that their legs were soft. Currently, they were both detained by the production team and weren't allowed to go out!Da Qiao came back to her senses. She raised her head and gave her grandmother a sweet smile, \"I understand. I'll go back now. Grandmother, you should go back soon.\"...After Huo Chi finished picking the pig dung, he washed his hands and took a mantou left over from yesterday. He made way to the small road where Da Qiao would pass by and waited.The sun was about to set. The red clouds covered the entire Qili Village. And Da Qiao was yet to be seen.Huo Chi swallowed the last small piece of mantou. He clapped his hands clean and prepared to secretly go to Qiao's house to check the situation.At this moment, Da Qiao came over. Still, carrying the schoolbag from before.Seeing how pondering appearance and didn't notice him at all, Huo Chi had to call, \"Qiao Nian Nian!\"When Da Qiao heard someone calling her, she looked up to find Huo Chi. Immediately, she revealed a small smile: \"Younger Brother Huo Chi, it's you!\"Huo Chi: \"...\"His face turned black at once: \"I'm not a younger brother. I'm older than you!\"Da Qiao looked at him and said softly, \"I'm seven years old this year. How about you?\"Since Da Qiao grew taller, she always felt that she was tall and big. Every child she saw, she felt they were all her younger brother.Therefore, even when Huo Chi was half a head taller than her at this time, she still feel that the other party was younger than her and was a younger brother.Huo Chi's face was very ugly: \"I'm nine years old!\"There was not enough food every day on the farm. So forget about any nutrition. The children born on the farm were generally shorter than the average child.This was Huo Chi's sore spot. He never thought he would get stabbed by Da Qiao on their third meeting!Da Qiao was a good child who knows her mistakes and can correct them. She tilted her head and said softly, \"You are two years older than me. Then I'll call you Elder Brother Huo Chi.\"The little girl in front of him was fair and clean with two small tails tied on her head. As she tilted her head, the two small tails swung a bit.She looked at him like a deer with dark and clear eyes as she called him \"Elder Brother Huo Chi\" in a sweet voice. Who can stand this?There were two suspicious blushes on Huo Chi's face. He turned his head to look at the grass, and said in a muffled voice, \"Up to you.\"Da Qiao smiled softly: \"Then it's settled. It's getting late, I'm going back.\"As soon as she said that, she was going to leave without any attachment at all.Huo Chi hurriedly halted her: \"Hey, Qiao Nian Nian, how is your mom?\"Only then, Da Qiao remembered that she told him about her mom earlier. So she stopped, turned around and replied, \"I made a mistake just now. I thought it was my stepmom who gotten into an accident. She is fine. It's my biological mom who had the accident.\"Huo Chi: \"...\"Weren't stepmothers usually very dark-hearted?How come she seem to be closer to her stepmom?Huo Chi's mind turned very fast.Combining the scenes in the dream and some rumors he heard recently, he immediately pieced together the truth.He nodded and said, \"It's good that she's fine. By the way, thank you for your egg and mantou last time.\"\"You're welcome.\" Da Qiao smiled. Then she lowered her head and took out another egg from her schoolbag. She handed it over, \"For you.\"Huo Chi looked at her outstretched little hand. A tender small, fleshy hand like a peeled egg. There were meat on the back of the hand. Compared with his dry hand full of calluses, it was a world of difference!He suddenly had the urge to hide his hand. Instead of doing so, he stretched it out, grasped the egg she handed over, \"Write down the number. I will definitely return it to you in double the amount in the future!\"Da Qiao didn't refuse. Like a picking chick, she nodded, \"Okay. Then I'll go back and write down the number and use it to settle the account in the future!\"She never actually thought about asking the other party to return it. But she could understand what he was thinking.When Auntie Hui helped her, she had felt very uneasy and always wanted to do something to repay the other party. She thought Huo Chi had the same thought as her.Sure enough, when he heard Da Qiao's words, Huo Chi's expression relaxed. He solemnly nodded: \"I will definitely pay you back. I'll keep my word!\"\"I know. I believe in you! I'm going back. Goodbye.\" Da Qiao waved at him and turned away.Huo Chi watched her back like he did the previous time. He didn't turn around until he couldn't see her anymore.Wan Chun Ju had a stomach full of steam and didn't want to go back. So she wandered around the village and encountered people who were as gossipy as her. She stopped to speak ill of Lin Hui and Da Qiao.After she said a lot of bad things, she felt much more comfortable.Holding her waist, she slowly walked towards the Qiao's old house. When she passed a big tree, a strong wind suddenly blew.Fortunately, her weight wasn't small. If not, she would have been blown away by the strong wind. If it was small butt Chen Qiao Qiao, she would have been blown to the horizon.Just when she was proud, a pile of yellow-green things blew toward her face along with the wind.What it was?She widened her eyes. The next moment, she knew!She made a sound of pigs getting slaughtered. Screaming, she jumped to her feet: \"Go away, go away... ah ah ah... Why are there monema flavescens at this time?\"These monema flavescens were at larva stage of the moth.It was brightly colored, shaped like a slug, and covered in stingers. Once disturbed, it will immediately sting people with its stingers!Being stung by monema flavescens can be said to be very burning. So itchy and painful. It will also cause rashes or blisters. Before a child in the village was stung and his face was swollen into blister-covered pig state in less than half a day. !But monema flavescens usually only appear in late May. Now it was only the end of April. Why did it appear at this time?As soon as the monema flavescens touched her face, Wan Chun Ju felt a tingling pain. She reached out to touch and felt a moving monema flavescens. She screamed in horror.Some villagers witnessed Wan Chun Ju yelling and jumping under the big tree and immediately laughed: \"When did old Eldest Qiao's wife learn to sing big plays?\"Once Wan Chun Ju wailingly ran home, her entire face was swollen into a blistered pig's head!When Qiao Zhen Guo came back from work, he happened to come face-to-face with her as soon as he entered the door. He was startled: \"Where did this pig's head come from?\"Seeing her man, Wan Chun Ju couldn't help bursting into tears. As she sobbed, she scratched: \"Zhen Guo, I was stung by monema flavescens, it's so itchy. It hurts like hell... waa waa...\"Only then did Qiao Zhen Guo realize that the person with the pig's head in front of him was his wife. He was shocked: \"Wife, you can really toss around! One moment, you turned into a roast pig. The next moment, you're swollen into a longevity god state. Now a blister pig head!\"Wan Chun Ju almost burst into tears: \"...You think I want to?\"She didn't know why she was so unlucky?The eight mouth sores on her mouth hadn't healed yet. Now she had been stung by monema flavescens. Her life was miserable!When Qiao Xiu Zhi heard the crying, she ran out. At once, she was speechless: \"Eldest, why aren't you taking your wife to the clinic to get some medicine back?\"Qiao Zhen Guo nodded and took his wife out.When someone asked him, he pointed to at his wife's pig-headed face, \"My wife is so troublesome. She got stung into this blister-like state by monema flavescens!\"On the whole way, almost half of the villagers in Qili Village heard his speech!Wan Chun Jui almost spat out a mouthful of old blood!When they got to the clinic, the new male doctor saw Wan Chun Ju. He was gobsmacked: \"It turns out that someone can really swell into a pig's head!\"Wan Chun Ju pig's head blushed painfully red: \"...\"In the end, the male doctor prescribed a bottle of solution. But the blisters on Wan Chun Ju's face still got the monema flavescens's poisonous stinger. It got to to be taken out. Otherwise, there will be inflammation and pus.After returning, Qiao Zhen Guo mixed raw flour into gluten according to the doctor's instructions. Then he rubbed the gluten on Wan Chun Ju's face back and forth.\"Ah ah ah...\"That night, Qiao's old house rang out a chorus of slaughtered pig's sounds.The children who lived nearby were frightened into tears again!...The night was getting darker and the stars were shining.Wang Family's hall was tightly closed. Even the windows too.Mr. Wang sat on the top chair. His face was as black as the bottom of a pot.Wang Xin Sheng's hands and feet were bound by ropes.After the person was brought over, Wang Shui Sheng kicked him with a black face.\"BOOM!\"He knelt heavily on both knees. His chin hit the floor. Immediately, iron taste emerged in his mouth.Old Madam Wang felt distressed at once: \"Eldest, what are you doing? You want to kill your younger brother?\"Wang Shui Sheng said with a dark face: \"If it's not illegal to kill, I would have kill him now!\"Old Madam Wang was so furious that her chest hurt. She pointed at him with the intention to scold.However, old Mister Wang slammed the dry tobacco stick on the table and berated: \"Shut up! Look at the situation! You still want to protect him? Do you want the whole family to be buried with him? Only like this, you will be happy?\"Although old Madam Wang was usually strong, she did not dare to speak up when the old man was truly infuriated.Old Mister Wang sternly stared at the youngest on the ground: \"Wang Xin Sheng, ah, Wang Xin Sheng. This time, you really want entire Wang family to be buried with you before you're satisfied?\"The most severe rumors circulating outside were close to the truth.Fang Xiao Juan wasn't just pushed down by Ye Zhen Zhen though. But by her and Wang Xin Sheng!At that time, Fang Xiao Juan saw Wang Xin Sheng and Ye Zhen Zhen hugging each other. She was so mad that she immediately rushed forward to grab Ye Zhen Zhen's hair for a violent beating.Ye Zhen Zhen received a few fist. Soon, she recovered and fought back. Fang Xiao Juan was pushed hard by her and caused her to crashed into Wang Xin Sheng who was behind her.Wang Xin Sheng grabbed her hand and told her to stop making trouble., Fang Xiao Juan's anger exponentially burned and scratched his face with a stretch of her hand.Wang Xin Sheng's temper also flared up. He slapped her twice and kicked her stomach.Fang Xiao Juan screamed in pain. Her whole body went backwards and bumped into Ye Zhen Zhen. Ye Zhen Zhen subconsciously pushed her with force. Fang Xiao Juan flew and her stomach hit the ground hard. Afterward, that tragedy happened.Fang Xiao Juan wasn't a good person. But in this matter, Ye Zhen Zhen and Wang Xin Sheng were even more scumbags!If Fang Xiao Juan was dead, they would be murderers!Now Fang Xiao Juan had been sent to the town hospital and still hadn't woken up.Wang Xin Sheng laid on the ground. His eyes fixed on the ground without moving.When he saw Fang Xiao Juan bleeding, he regretted it at the time!But there was no regret medicine in the world. No matter how much he regretted, it was useless.Seeing him like this, Old Mister Wang suddenly felt oppressed in his chest: \"Eldest, hit. Hit hard. Hit him until he begs for mercy!\"\"Yes, Dad!\" Wang Shui Sheng took out the belt he had prepared early in the morning, raised it, and whipped Wang Xinsheng hard.He was really pissed off!Why was this person so daring? It was okay to be lazy at normal times. But now he was getting together with a female educated youth. And even caused trouble!It seem he didn't learn a lesson the last time he provoked Fang Xiao Juan into home!What only remember to eat but not the beat. That's because the beating wasn't harsh enough, so he can't remember it!This time, he was going to beat him to death. Let him know what was fear. To the point, he dare to do stupid things next time!Wang Shui Sheng had reached his erupting point this time. He didn't hold back any strength. Wang Xin Sheng was only wearing a single shirt. Blood was soon spilled out.Old Madam Wang's heart twitched. More distressed than if were on her: \"Eldest, stop it! Stop it!\"Old Mister Wang furiously hollered: \"Don't listen to your mom. Just keep hitting!\"Old Madam Wang's chest hurt from the anger. Her breath couldn't come out. She clutched her chest and cried out, \"Okay, you want to kill Youngest, right? You can kill me too!\"As she said that, she rolled her eyes and fell from the stool to the ground.\"MOM!\"The two daughters-in-law rushed over. One of them pinched her mother-in-law's philtrum hard. The other went to bring water to wake her mother-in-law.Wang Shui Sheng saw that his mom used the ultimate trick in order to stop them from hitting Wang Shui Sheng. A feeling of powerlessness surged in his heart.At this moment, he made a decision: \"Dad, if Fifth Sister-in-law can wake up this time, I will send Fifth Brother to the army!\"As the eldest brother, he was useless and he couldn't control this hooligan Wang Xin Sheng. So he can only be handed over to Third Younger brother!Old Man Wang sighed and nodded, \"We'll do what you said.\"Fang Xiao Juan woke up after being in a coma for three days.On this day, Da Qiao received the first gift from Huo Chi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her small palm-sized face was excited to the point her cheeks were flushing like two small apples.While An Ping, who was walking behind her, had a big head drooping. He was like an eggplant that had been beaten by frost. He couldn't be more wilted.After walking a few steps, An Ping jogged and directed her a flattering smile, \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, can I discuss something with you?\"Before Da Qiao could speak, Qiao Dong Ying slapped him on the head: \"Shoo, shoo. Stop having ideas on Da Qiao. If you really want face, you should study hard. Time and time again, you get\u00a0a duck egg\u00a0test. You don't feel ashamed, but I do for you!\"An Ping wasn't angry when he was beaten by his elder sister. He reached out and touched his red forehead, \"Second Elder Sister, how do you know what I'm going to say?\"Qiao Dong Ying rolled her eyes at him and replied, \"As soon as you poke your bum out, I know what you want to fart!\"Da Qiao covered her mouth and couldn't help laugh.The school held the mid-term exam the day before yesterday. The results were announced today. She got a double 100 percent test paper in both Chinese and Math.Not only was she first place in the class, but also first place in the whole year. The teacher had praised her in front of everyone!So happy!She really wanted to go home and tell her grandparents immediately. They would be delighted when they find out!Contrary to her, her elder cousin brother, who was one grade above her, brought back double duck egg test paper. It was said that he handed in a blank paper. The teacher saw the test paper and scolded on the spot!Eldest Cousin Brother spoke out just now was definitely wanting to tell her to go back and not tell the adults about the midterm exam. That way he won't get scolded.Sure enough, the next moment, An Ping continue stick his face out and said to Da Qiao: \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, after you go back, don't tell Grandmother and Grandfather whether the mid-term exam was good or not. As long as you promise to Elder Cousin Brother, I will give you five candies!\"Da Qiao shook her head. The little tail on her head swayed: \"No way.\"An Ping gritted his teeth and displayed a painful look on his face: \"Ten candies, no more. I only have so many!\"Da Qiao still shook her head and softly spoke, \"Elder Cousin Brother, I promised Grandmother I'll bring back 100% in the test. So I can't promise you.\"An Ping: Then what should he do?When Qiao Dong Ying heard this response, she laughed happily.Although her score wasn't good, she passed!Huo Chi stood outside the pigsty with a shovel. He eyed the path on the right from time to time.Dai Shu Fang noticed her son's abnormality early in the morning, and couldn't help but ask, \"Chi'er, why do you keep looking over there. Are you waiting for someone?\"Huo Chi's face was slightly hot. He shook his head and replied, \"No. I'm not waiting for anyone.\"A guilty person gives himself away by conspicuously protesting his innocence.Dai Shu Fang couldn't help be amused when she saw her son like this.She had guessed who her son was waiting for, but she didn't say it.Sure enough, after a while, Qiao Family's children walked over in chatter and laughter. She noticed that her son's eyes lighting up at once. That pair of eyes fell on the little girl in the middle.She pursed her lips and smiled. Pretending she didn't know anything, she picked up the big rattan basket and headed toward the pigsty.Neither of the two children were over ten years old. Of course, she never considered anything happening between them. Not to mention that their identities were so disparate.She had thought about letting Chi'er not have too much contact with the little girl to avoid harming the other party.But when the words came to her mouth, she swallowed it back down.Over the years, Chi'er had been with them on the farm and had been helping with farm work since he was a few years old. He had never had any friends of the same age. Now it was rare for him to take the initiative to make friends with people. She really didn't want to say anything to spoil it.Although Chi'er was young, he had a cautious personality. She believed that he will not let his actions cause harm to the little girl!Huo Chi was relieved to see his mom go in. A pair of slender eyes fell on Da Qiao.Of course, An Ping noticed again and rushed up in a fit of anger: \"You stinky boy, have you forgotten what I warned you about last time?\"Both of them are nine years old. However, An Ping was well-fed. And Qiao Family's genes destined them to be all tall. So when he stood in front of Huo Chi, he was obviously half a head taller than him!Huo Chi slapped his hand away and stated coldly: \"If you dare to do it again, don't blame the shovel in my hand for not having eyes!\"An Ping looked at the shovel in his hand, which was still stained with smelly pig manure. Immediately, there was disdain: \"You're cruel!\"He didn't have any weapons in his hand. If the other party really hit him with a shovel, it wouldn't be the normal terrible!Da Qiao was worried that the two of them would fight. So she hurried over: \"Elder Cousin Brother, Elder Brother Huo Chi, don't fight!\"An Ping's eyes were as big as lychee: \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, what did you call him? You can't call him that. He's a wicked one!\"Huo Chi's face fell at once.Da Qiao said softly, \"Elder Cousin Brother, Grandmother had already said that wicked ones aren't all bad people. Elder Brother Huo Chi isn't a bad person. Don't say that.\"When An Ping heard it was what his grandmother said, he scratched his head, \"Then you can't play with him either. If you are seen, maybe you will be reported!\"Da Qiao knew that her elder cousin brother said this because he cared about her. So she pursed her lips and responded softly: \"I know. I won't let anyone see it. Elder Cousin Brother, don't worry.\"An Ping was a big-hearted person. Seeing that Da Qiao said so herself, he shut up.Like An Ping, Qiao Dong He was a little worried that Da Qiao would be seen with wicked ones. But before she could speak, she was pulled away by her younger sister, Qiao Dong Ying.\"Why did you pull me away just now?\" Qiao Dong He asked with a puzzled face.Qiao Dong Ying spoke: \"Elder Sister, since Grandmother said that they aren't bad people, then you don't have to worry too much. Younger Sister Da Qiao is already seven years old. You have to let her learn to get along with people by herself, even if the other party is a bad person, Have to let her learn how to tell the difference, right?\"Her sister had a gentle and delicate temperament. Good at everything, but she liked to excessively worry.Sometimes she felt her elder sister was like an old hen who protects her chicks. She had endless worries all day long!Qiao Dong He considered this for a moment before nodding, \"You're right. But we still have to observe that kid later. Lest Younger Sister Da Qiao suffer and we don't even know!\"So what she said before was all in vain?Qiao Dong Ying rolled her eyes, licked her teeth and said, \"Elder Sister, if you really can't stay idle, why don't you worry about our stupid younger brother!\"Sure enough, Qiao Dong He's attention was immediately diverted.Da Qiao saw that her cousins had walked away and apologized softly: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, my elder cousin brother has no malicious intentions. Don't take it to heart!\"Huo Chi pursed his lips and said nothing.Seeing him like this, Da Qiao thought he was angry. She lowered her head and took out an egg from her schoolbag, \"This is today's egg. For you!\"Huo Chi's gaze fell on the books in her schoolbag. A flash of longing appeared in his eyes.Those books were things that wicked ones like him can't touch. Forget about even going to school!Da Qiao noticed his keen gaze. She tilted her head and thought for a moment: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, do you want to study?\"Huo Chi pursed his lips and was silent for a while. In the end, he still nodded: \"Want!\"Although his grandfather and mother secretly taught him a lot of words and all kinds of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division in mathematics in private, it was still completely different from studying in the school system. Plus they didn't have textbooks. So the study was very scattered .Da Qiao contemplated a bit. She blinked her long eyelashes and said, \"Then I'll go back and copy the textbook for you.\"If she directly buy the textbook for Elder Brother Huo Chi, it may cause a lot of trouble if they get caught. However, copying by hand will be less eye-catching.Huo Chi didn't want to trouble her again and again, but he really wanted to have a book of his own: \"Thank you!\"When Da Qiao saw that he was finally no longer angry, she curled her lips and smiled: \"You're welcome. Take the egg. By the way, is your grandfather in good health?\"Huo Chi nodded: \"He's much better. Grandfather asked me to thank you!\"His grandfather had a bad cough before. After eating the food she gave, the cough actually got better day by day. His complexion looked much better than before.\"That's great!\" Da Qiao said with a sigh of relief.Originally, she considered thinking of a way to smuggle the jade bead for the other party to use if his grandfather wasn't in good health.But this method was a bit risky. She was worried that the existence of jade beads getting discovered.In addition, they were wicked ones. If their health was too good, it might not be a good thing.Because everyone might think that they were just eating and drinking and not working. This can harm them instead!Huo Chi saw her pursed lips and smiled. Two small dimples appeared by the corners of his mouth. It tempt people to reach out and poke it: \"Wait a minute, I'll give you something.\"As he said that, he put down the shovel and ran back to the house. After a while, he ran out again. This time, his hands were washed and had two straw grasshoppers in the palm of his hand.Da Qiao's beautiful apricot eyes lit up. She looked at him, \"Is this for me?\"Seeing that she didn't dislike it, a flash of joy flashed in his eyes. Huo Chi pretended to be calm and stated, \"En, for you. Randomly made.\"\"Thank you!\" Da Qiao passed him the eggs and took the two grasshoppers into her hand, \"Did you make this up by yourself?\"The two straw grasshoppers were very delicate, cute and lifelike. It was the first time she had seen such a straw creation.Huo Chi's lip corner twitched slightly. He nodded and answered, \"En, what other animals do you like? If I have time, I can make it for you.\"After thinking about it, he added another sentence: \"Just as a thank you gift for copying the book for me.\"Da Qiao tilted her head and thought for a moment. Then she asked in a quiet voice, \"Can you weave hens?\"Huo Chi: \"...\"Shouldn't a normal little girl like rabbits or butterflies?Why did she specially want a hen?Seeing that he didn't answer, Da Qiao thought it wasn't easy to make: \"If you can't make it, then make whatever you can.\"Huo Chi spoke: \"I haven't made a hen before. I'll give it a try.\"\"Okay, then I'll wait.\"...When Fang Xiao Juan got sent to the town hospital, she was completely covered in bloody.All her clothes and the quilt covering her were stained red with blood.At that time, Wang Shui Sheng, who was driving a carriage, couldn't help trembling from top to bottom from this sight.Everyone thought she wouldn't survive. Even the doctor said the chances were small.In the end, she survived. The patients in the hospital said she her life was strong.Wang Family thought that Fang Xiao Juan would stir trouble once she woke up. But strangely, she had been quiet for a few days since she woke up.Unnervingly quiet.\"Eldest Brother, she hasn't spoken or made trouble for a few days. Is she holding back for some big moves?\"Old Second Wang spoke to Wang Shui Sheng with a sincere worry on his face.Wang Shui Sheng glanced inside the ward. Fang Xiao Juan was drinking porridge under the service of her second sister-in-law. She didn't find fault or break out into a scolding. It was indeed very calm. Unlike Fang Xiao Juan from before.Though Wang Shui Sheng felt unsettled in his heart, he said on the surface, \"Don't scare yourself. It can't be that you want her to make a scene?\"Old Second Wang scratched his ears and responded, \"I definitely don't want her to. But it's not like you haven't seen Fifth Younger Sister-in-law's character. I'm afraid that she's not making trouble now and will go for the kill with a big move later!\"For example, running to the community or the town government to report Fifth Younger Brother.Ever since the document on severe crack down on the persecution of educated youth was issued last year, educated youth have received alternative protection and become an untouchable landmine.Wang Xin Sheng, a man with a family, got involved with a female educated youth and almost caused a death. Once this incident was exposed, not only would he be shot dead, Wang family would also suffer!The first to bear the brunt was him, Wang Shui Sheng, the production team leader. Then followed by old Third Wang in the army.Both of them may be sacked. Wang Shui Sheng may be imprisoned for the crime of covering up.Wang Shui Sheng and old Third Wang were the two most promising members of Wang family. If they fall, Wang Family will be finished!This was something that no one in Wang Family wants to see. So the most important thing at the moment was to stabilize Fang Xiao Juan and get her give up the idea of reporting.Wang Shui Sheng was silent for a while. Frowning, he spoke, \"I'll go in and talk to her later.\"An hour later, Wang Shui Sheng walked in with a frown while another patient in the ward was pushed out to bask in the sun.Fang Xiao Juan saw Wang Shui Sheng come in. Only a glance was given. Not a word spoken.Was an unscolding Fang Xiao Juan still Fang Xiao Juan?Wang Shui Sheng's heart pounded again: \"Fifth Younger Sister-in-law, Fifth Younger Brother had wronged you in this matter. I have already harshly beaten him!\"Fang Xiao Juan gazed at him with black pupils. Still silent.Wang Shui Sheng felt cold sweat on his forehead: \"Fifth Younger Sister-in-law, I won't go in to deep. Since you married into our Wang Family, then we are a family. Like grasshoppers on same line. If something happens to Fifth Younger Brother, you won't benefit. What do you think?\"Fang Xiao Juan's lip corner stretched and revealed a sarcastic smile: \"Eldest Brother, as a victim, why can't I benefit? At most, I'm get lectured a few words. It doesn't hurt. But if I go to the community to report Wang Xin Sheng hooking up with a female educated youth, abused his wife, and caused my baby to die on the spot, what do you think will happen to him?\"Wang Shui Sheng's forehead was now in a knot: \"Then what does it take for Fifth Younger Sister-in-law to give up reporting?\"He felt that Fang Xiao Juan had become a different person since she woke up. Which was indescribably strange.Fang Xiao Juan didn't directly say her request. Instead, she threw the ball back to his court, \"Then it depends on what your Wang Family can give me.\"This was definitely not Fang Xiao Juan of the past!Fang Xiao Juan should be bluffing. She should be impulsive and stupid. Not calmly negotiating terms with him like she was now!Wang Shui Sheng looked at her like she was a ghost.If the person in front of him didn't look like Fang Xiao Juan and if the feudal superstition had been disintegrated now, he really suspected she was taken over by something!Fang Xiao Juan watched him stare her. A trace of nervousness flashed in her eyes: \"Why is Eldest Brother looking at me like this?\"Wang Shui Sheng tentatively responded, \"Fifth Younger Sister-in-law seem to be a little different from before.\"Fang Xiao Juan pulled her lips: \"If you went to hell and, you will be different too!\"Truthfully, the person who was talking to Wang Shui Sheng right now was indeed not the former Fang Xiao Juan.She didn't have someone transmigrated into her body. The person in this body was still Fang Xiao Juan. However, it was the fifty-year-old Fang Xiao Juan who had rebirth from a previous life.In her previous life, Fang Xiao Juan lived to the age of fifty. Then she died in a car accident. When she woke up again, she was lying in the hospital.The appearance of Wang Family and the memory in her brain surprised her. It took almost three days for her to digest her resurrection.It was just that this life was very different from the previous life.In her last life, she never divorced. She lived with Qiao Zhen Jun all her life.Qiao Zhen Jun was a trash!The reform and opening up was such a good opportunity. Everyone around him was rich. While he was timid. All his life, he lived in the countryside as a hopeless farmer!Implicating her to also live in the countryside all her life. In her last life, she regretted not divorcing him earlier. Otherwise, with her beauty, she would definitely be able to re-marry a capable man!So when she knew that she had divorced Qiao Zhen Jun in this life, the rebirthed Fang Xiao Juan wasn't too surprised. But rather, she was glad that she had taken the most correct step!What made her very dissatisfied was that this life's Fang Xiao Juan kept acting up when there was such a good man like Wang Xin Sheng and turned a good hand of cards into bad ones!That was right. Even when she knew that she had been miscarried due to Wang Xin Sheng in this life, Wang Xin Sheng was still a very good candidate in her opinion.After all, Wang Xin Sheng in her previous life dearly doted Lin Hui. Most importantly, he became the first ten-thousand-yuan household in the village!She still remembered the scene when Wang Xin Sheng drove back to the village in a car. Lin Hui got out of the car wearing a red coat.Lin Hui had permed her hair and was wearing clothes she had never seen before. She was very modern.While she was wearing gray clothes. Although there was no patch, but she couldn't wait to dig a hole and bury herself on the spot when compared with the other party!At that time, Lin Hui walked in front of her in high heels, looking at her as if she was looking at a pile of garbage. Her eyes were full of sympathy and provocation. It had made her so angry that she grounded her teeth and wished she could rush to tear her face on the spot!So in this life, how can she not cherish a good hand of cards when she clearly had it?After all, she has lived a whole life. Her experience and mind were above Fang Xiao Juan's in this life. So even if she wanted to live a good life with Wang Xin Sheng, she still wanted to strive for the most favorable situation for herself.When Wang Shui Sheng heard her words, a flash of awkwardness flashed on his face: \"Fifth Younger Sister-in-law, Fifth Younger Brother was indeed wrong in this matter. If you want to divorce, we will not stop you. What's more, we'll compensate you!\"Let alone not stopping her, Wang Family can't wait to set off firecrackers to celebrate if Fang Xiao Juan agrees to the divorce!Unexpectedly, Fang Xiao Juan answered without a second thought: \"I'm not divorcing. I still have feelings for Xin Sheng.\"Wang Shui Sheng: \"...\"Forgive him for being blind, But he can't see Fang Xiao Juan having the slightest affection for his fifth younger brother!As long as anyone who wasn't blind, they can see that the reason why Fang Xiao Juan married into the Wang Family was because of Wang Family's background.If not, with Wang Xin Sheng's couch potato temperament, which woman would be willing to marry him?Wang Shui Sheng rendered speechless for a long time before he recovered his voice: \"Since Fifth Younger Sister-in-law have feelings for Fifth Younger Brother, you wouldn't report him?\"Fang Xiao Juan replied: \"Having feelings for him and him doing me wrong is two different things. I have suffered such a big hardship and forgive him easily, maybe he will beat me like this next time!\"Wang Shui Sheng shook his head: \"He won't. I promise you!\"He didn't plan to tell Fang Xiao Juan about sending Wang Xin Sheng to the army for the time being. for fear of what would happen after he said it.Although Fang Xiao Juan had lived two lifetimes, she was still an impatient person. She went straight to the point, \"Let me say it directly. To get me to not report, then your Wang Family must compensate me with one thousand yuan!\"Nothing was more realistic than money!She planned to go back and live a good life with Wang Xin Sheng and win his heart.But if that didn't work, she will use the money to do business after the reform!Since she lived an extra lifetime, she believed that she can make money!When Wang Shui Sheng heard her words, he almost jumped up and uttered, \"One thousand yuan! You might as well go rob! Go f*cking report then!\"But he quickly calmed himself down: \"Fifth Younger Sister-in-law, you open a lion mouth. Our Wang family can't take out a thousand yuan!\"Fang Xiao Juan didn't believe it: \"Eldest Brother, don't lie to me. Third Younger Brother has been an officer in the army for so many years. The money sent back every year is three or four hundred yuan. After so many years, how could there be not thousand yuan?\"Wang Shui Sheng's face became even more ugly: \"There are so many people in Wang Family. Got to build a house, get married and have children. Which didn't need money? So this thousand yuan really can't be gathered up!\"Of course Fang Xiao Juan wouldn't believe his nonsense. She didn't want to make things too stiff. After some pondering, she spoke: \"For Xin Sheng's sake, I'll take a step back. Eight hundred yuan. It can't be any less. Take eight hundred yuan as buying my baby's life. Rest assured, once I get the money, I will properly live life with Xin Sheng. And that female educated youth, I won't make things difficult for her!\"Off with your rest assured!Such a good-natured Wang Shui Sheng couldn't help but want to swear when he heard her words!The first time she threatened Wang Family with a pregnant belly. Now she was threatening Wang Family with the death of the baby!It would be better if she divorced and asked for money. But she happened to persist on wanting to properly live with Wang Xin Sheng!Vomit!Wasn't this a whore putting up a chastity sign?Wang Shui Sheng felt extremely disgusted. He stated with a dark face, \"I can't give you an answer on this matter. I have to go home and discuss it with my parents.\"Fang Xiao Juan nodded: \"No problem.\"...\"An Ping, take out your test paper for Mom to see. Did the teacher make a mistake with yours and Da Qiao's test paper?\"Wan Chun Ju knew Da Qiao had passed with double 100 test paper. While her son passed with double duck egg test. She couldn't believe this fact.Everyone was speechless: \"...\"Qiao Dong Ying rolled her eyes and said, \"Mom, An Ping is in the third grade and Da Qiao is in the second grade. No matter how blind the teacher is, they will never make such a mistake with their test papers!\"Wan Chun Ju was choked by her daughter. Her face turned red and then white: \"You damn girl, only know to talk back! I used so much money to let you study. And you get such scores back. Aren't you letting me, your mom down?\"Qiao Dong Ying rolled her eyes again: \"Mom, I have to remind you that the money for studying is from my grandparents!\"Wan Chun Ju was so angry that wanted stomped her feet: \"Da Qiao can get 100% in the test, why can't you two?\"Although she was mad when her son got double duck egg, she was reluctant to scold him. So she scolded the two girls instead!Before Qiao Dong Ying could respond, An Ping came over and sighed like his dad: \"It's all your fault, Mom. We're not smart because we are like Mom, no?\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"This pissed her off!Qiao Zhen Guo laughed: \"Son, you're right. You didn't get 100% in the test because, like you guys are like your mom. Let me tell you, your mom didn't want to go to the literacy class because she didn't understand!\"Wan Chu Ju: \"...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The dishes were very tempting. There were steamed river fish, braised eggs with braised trotter, stir-fried three shreds, and a large pot of dried shrimp and Chinese cabbage soup.Qiao Family's index fingers became bustling at the sight. The sound of drooling came one after another.An Ping wiped the corners of his mouth and declared, \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, I was wrong. I shouldn't have stopped you!\"Fortunately, Younger Sister Da Qiao didn't listen to him. If she hid the test score, he won't have this current blessing!Qiao Dong Ying gave him a rap of knuckle on the spot: \"You have the guts to say it! If you get duck egg score next time, you will be punished with eating congee and vegetarian dishes like Mom!\"An Ping wailed: \"Second Elder Sister, spare my life! I will definitely properly do the test next time!\"For the sake of meat, he will try to come back with two ten percent next time!Wan Chun Ju, who was in midst of stirring the white congee with chopsticks, was stabbed by her daughter. She almost vomited blood: \"Damn lass, why did you hit your brother again? Don't you know that it's not okay to hit men on the head?\"The swelling on Wan Chun Ju's face hadn't subsided yet. The doctor told her to eat less fish and shrimp. And the remaining saucy trotter, she couldn't smell the taste.In other words, she can only have the plate of vegetarian fried three shred out of the large table of food!Wan Chun Ju felt that she was so miserable. Miserable enough to make those who heard it sad and those who saw it weep!Qiao Xiu Zhi raised her eyes and gave her eldest daughter-in-law a cool gaze: \"Dong Ying is right. If An Ping continues to score zero in the test, not only will he not get to eat meat, but he will also not have to go to school!\"One stone creates a thousand waves!These words were like water dripping into a frying pan. Everyone stopped their chopsticks.Wan Chun Ju's face turned pale: \"Mom, why can't An Ping go to school?\"If An Ping can't go to school, he can only come back to work in the field. She can't bear her only son to do the dirty and tiring work!An Ping was also a little flustered. Suddenly that the meat in his mouth was no longer fragrant.Qiao Xiu Zhi stared at him and stated, \"No one's money comes from the wind. If you don't want to go to school, then don't waste the money. Go to the field to earn work points!\"An Ping thought of Huo Chi, who was shoveling pig dung and hesitantly responded, \"Grandmother, I want to go to school.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't give him a chance to be vague: \"Then what score do you think you will be able to get next time?\"An Ping remembered the ten percent he considered just now and felt a little unable to utter it: \"Thir...forty points.\"\"Pfft...\"Qiao Zhen Min almost choked to death by his own saliva: \"I say, An Ping, can't you be more promising. Pass the test with 60 percent!\"Wan Chun Ju's eyes shot daggers: \"Fifth Younger Brother, do you think passing the test is so easy?\"Qiao Zhen Min raised the corner of his mouth and stopped talking.Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded: \"Okay, then set a small goal first. The next test get 40 percent. If you can't do it, you don't have to go to school!\"An Ping: \"...Okay.\"Since there's punishment, there's also reward.After Qiao Xiu Zhi finished speaking, she took out one yuan from her pocket and handed it to Da Qiao, \"This is your 100 percent reward!\"Da Qiao accepted large sum of one yuan. Her small face flushed with excitement: \"Thank you, Grandmother, I will continue to work hard to get 100 percent in the test!\"Qiao Zhen Jun and Lin Hui looked at the child with pride and satisfaction.Little Dong Lin showed two small toothy teeth to little Yi Ming and exclaimed, \"My elder sister is amazing!\"Little Yi Ming glared at him as he corrected: \"It's our elder sister! Our!\"Little Dong Lin sighed like a little adult, \"Okay, it's yours and mine's.\"Only then, little Yi Ming was satisfied. He tilted his head and said with a goofy smile: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, you are so awesome. Little Yi Ming will be as good as you in the future and get a 100 percent!\"Little Dong Lin did want to get outdone: \"I'll also bring back a 100 percent!\"Everyone couldn't help laughing at the two little ones' interaction.Qiao Xiu Zhi declared in mirth: \"Okay, no matter who it is, as long as you can get 100 percent in the test, you will be rewarded!\"Qiao Dong He secretly made up her mind; hoping to get a 100 percent in the test. Unexpectedly, she was called the next moment.\"Dong He, you are in the fifth grade now. You will graduate from primary school in two months. Do you have the confidence to be admitted to junior high school?\" Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at her and asked.It was now 1973. The \"five-four\" school system was implemented; meaning five years for primary school, two years of junior high school, and two years of senior high school.Qiao Dong He sensed everyone's eyes were on her. Her face quickly turned red. Still, she mustered the courage and nodded: \"There should be no problem.\"Qiao Dong He belonged to the category of those who was very serious and hard-working in their studies, but their IQ wasn't too high. Her academic performance had been wandering between seven and eighty.Qiao Dong Ying, on the other hand, was similar to An Ping, both dislike studying.It was just that Qiao Dong Ying was better than An Ping. She can maintain 60 percent every time.That was right. Not one point over and not one point under. Qiao Dong Ying had been 60 percent since she started studying. It made people suspect that she did it on purpose!Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded: \"That's good. Do your best. If you pass the exam, Grandmother will find a way to get someone to buy a bicycle. Then your dad can go to town to pick you up during the weekend!\"As soon as these words came out, Qiao Family erupted again!Qiao Zhen Guo scratched his ears and grinned: \"Dong He, you have to study hard. It's up to you whether Dad can ride a bicycle!\"One must know, owning a bicycle these days was like owning a supercar in the 21st century.Besides, no one in the village had bought a bicycle. Wang Family can afford it, but they were afraid of being in the limelight So they never bought it.If Qiao Family bought it, they would be the first one in the village!Qiao Dong He immediately felt huge pressure.After eating, Qiao Zhen Min had something to tell his parents. So he followed the two elderly into their room.\"Dad, Mom, I have already quit my job in the supply and demand cooperative. I have a buddy who can arrange me into a transportation company in the county. Still, as a driver. I can go to work in two days.\"He was still a temporary worker at to the transportation company in the county. This time was different from the supply and demand cooperative.In the supply and demand cooperative, they were really just transporters. While at the transport company, they will sell things in private. The money made was a lot. At the same time, the risks weren't small.But he couldn't not do it. It was obvious that he couldn't keep the job in the supply and demand cooperative. He didn't want to come back to the village to do farm work.In addition, he needed money to find a doctor for little Wan'er. After a combination of few factors, he nodded and agreed.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't know that he was still hiding some information: \"What about your wife and child? Will they go with you?\"Qiao Zhen Min shook his head: \"No. Back then, the town isn't too far from our village. Her parents' family is also in the town. So I'm somewhat relieved to let her stay there. However, there are no relatives in the county. I can't be at ease about letting the mother and daughter there by themselves.\"The main reason was that he was worried about leaving little Wan'er to Chen Qiao Qiao alone. If he lose her again, he will definitely go crazy!Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan exchanged glance.Xue Chuan nodded and said, \"Since you've already thought it through, then do it. Your mom and I will keep an eye on your wife and child!\"Qiao Zhen Min looked at his parents gratefully.It was the greatest blessing for them brothers and sisters to have such profound and righteous parents!...At this time, the atmosphere of Wang Family wasn't harmonious. A solemn pressure brew.Old Madam Wang was so infuriated that her face flushed red to the neck: \"That broken shoe Fang Xiao Juan wants 800 yuan as soon as she opens her mouth! Why doesn't she go rob?\"If Fang Xiao Juan hadn't threatened to report Wang Xin Sheng for being a hooligan, old Madam Wang Family would never have let a woman like her enter Wang Family's door!Not only was Fang Xiao Juan married and had children, but more importantly, this person was a natural troublemaker. Once she was allowed in, there will be no peace at home!Facts had proved that she was indeed a troublemaker. Her ability to cause stir things was completely beyond her imagination!Wang Xin Sheng was still bound. When he heard this, the blue veins on his neck were bulging: \"B*tch, I'll kill her now and die with her!\"\"BOOM!\"Wang Shui Sheng kicked him on the chest: \"You have died and be done with it. But we who are alive have to suffer for you! Why should we?\"So what if Wang Family had split up ?Even if they cut off their relationship, in the eyes of outsiders, they and Wang Xin Sheng were still one family!Once there is a murderer in the family, their entire Wang Family will not be able to lift their heads.He, the production leader, will definitely be sacked. The villagers will definitely not want a person with a murderer in the family to be the leader. Maybe he will go to jail because the protecting Wang Xin Sheng before!As for old Third. Even if he finds a way to stay in the army, his career path will definitely reach a dead-end.So the best situation now was to get Fang Xiao Juan give up on reporting.But to get her to give up, they must give 800 yuan according to her request!Wang Xin Sheng got kicked and fell backwards. His head hit the ground heavily. A grunt sounded.Seeing this, old Madam Wang was so distressed that she went up to beat Eldest Son: \"Eldest, your heart is blinded by fat. This is your own brother! How can you do this?\"Wang Shui Sheng said with a livid face: \"If he isn't my brother, do you think I will get involved in his matter?\"He had always been overly cautious. Never dared to take a step forward.When someone else is the production team leader, they dared to accept anything, from tobacco to alcohol. While he only dared to accept a little food, such as corn, cabbage, etc. The best he had ever received was dim sum.He didn't do bad things. But because of Wang Xin Sheng's mess, he had to wipe his ass from time to time. He had really had enough!Old Madam Wang's heart sank at the sight of Eldest Son's cold and angry eyes. She couldn't continue scolding.Old Man Wang's blue veins was bulged. He knocked the dry tobacco stick: \"You are still protecting him at this time. So the youngest is your son. You don't want the other sons?\"He used to love his youngest son the most. However he let himself down again and again. Now he really wished he had never given birth to such a vile spawn!Old Madam Wang's dry mouth murmured for a long time, but not a word came out.She wasn't really old and confused. In the future, she and old man will have to rely on Eldest Son for old age care. So if she really make Eldest Son's heart cold, she will be the one who will suffer in the future when she grows old.So she was silent for a while. She didn't dare to help her youngest son up. She walked back to the stool and sat down.Old Mister Wang looked at the other people and said, \"What do you think about this?\"The other two sons as well as the few daughters-in-law didn't say anything.Eight hundred yuan!Not eighty yuan. Or eight yuan!Eight hundred yuan can buy a house with two bedrooms and one living room in the town. If it is a bit shabby, maybe it can buy a house with three bedrooms and one living room!No one was willing to give so much money to that woman!When the family split last time, the family had already distributed some of the savings to each branch. There was still 300 yuan left in the hands of old Madam Wang.The feeling of spitting out the meat in the mouth didn't feel good to anyone!Wang Shui Sheng saw that his two usually honest younger brother did not speak this time and knew in his heart that they felt aggrieved.He sighed and said: \"Second Younger Brother, Fourth Younger Brother, I know that it doesn't sit well with you. I understand your grievances, but this is the difficulty that our Wang Family has to face together. If we are not united, Wang Family will really end !\"Old Second Wang rubbed his dry and cracked hands and said, \"Eldest Brother, don't say that. I'll listen to you!\"Old Fourth Wang paid no heed to his wife's face, and quickly stated: \"That's right, Eldest Brother. We will do what you say!\"When their wives heard this, their faces were as black as a stinky ditch.Wang Shui Sheng felt a little comfort in his heart: \"A total of 800 yuan is needed. As the Eldest, I will pay 250 yuan. Third Younger Brother will pay 200 yuan. Our parents will pay 50 yuan. The two of you will each pay 150 yuan. What do you think?\"When Liu Cui Hua heard that her family was paying 100 yuan more than other families, it was like cutting her flesh. Her hands were clenched so tight that her nails were pinched into her palms.Old Second's wife and old Fourth's wife finally felt a little better when they heard this.Old Second Wang and old Fourth Wang wanted to equally share the burden with their eldest brother. In the end they could only nod their heads under the eyes of their respective wives.Although Wang Shui Sheng felt distressed about the money, he just wanted to send this plague away.He turned to look at Wang Xin Sheng and stated, \"You stay at home. I'll have someone send you to the army in two days!\"Seeing how he was gnashing his teeth, it was best not to let him meet Fang Xiao Juan.He was afraid that he would really kill Fang Xiao Juan on one impulse!...Fang Xiao Juan was too weak to be discharged from the hospital any time soon.Qiao Xiu Zhi was unwilling to go to the hospital to see Fang Xiao Juan. So Da Qiao couldn't go alone. She could only wait for her to come back. and then visit Wang's house.According to the plan, Shen Family sent a driver to pick her up to play in the town on weekends.When the villagers saw the car entering the village, they immediately surrounded it.\"Da Qiao, are they going to pick you up to live in the town? So you won't come back in the future?\"Da Qiao shook her head and softly replied, \"No. I'm just going to the town to play for a day or two. I'll be back!\"When someone heard this, they teased her: \"Why are you coming back? It's great to live in the town. If I were you, I would definitely not come back!\"\"That's right. The deputy chief had recognized you as his goddaughter. Why are you coming back?\"Someone else asked Da Qiao to help her go to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy things: \"Da Qiao, since you have a car to pick you up, why don't you help Auntie go to the supply and demand cooperative to buy some fabrics on the way back later.\"\"Me too. Later buy me two jins of White Rabbit candy!\"\"I want\u2026\u2026\"One or two stuck to Da Qiao as they desired to take advantage of her. They kept asking Da Qiao to help buy things, but they didn't take the coupon and money out!Qiao Xiu Zhi came out, glanced at everyone, and coldly spoke: \"You can ask Da Qiao to help you buy things. The coupons and money can't be shorted either. Also, there must charge of five dimes as travel fee!\"Five dimes for travel fees!Why don't you go rob!But no one dared to argue with Qiao Xiu Zhi.The woman in front of them killed wild boar weighing more than 200 jins with one punch.What's more, they didn't really want to buy things. They just want to see if they can take advantage.Qiao Xiu Zhi rubbed Da Qiao's fluffy head and told, \"Go in. Be polite in other people's homes, understood?\"Da Qiao hugged her grandmother's arm. The little chick nodded like pecking rice: \"I understand. Grandmother, are you really not going with me?\"She was a little scared to leave her family and face Shen Family alone.The driver quickly helped to persuade, \"Auntie Qiao, Old Madam Shen and Shen Family have asked you to come along. If you don't go, how can I explain to them later?\"Taking in how Da Qiao's face leaning on her body, Qiao Xiu Zhi did feel a little worried about her going alone. What's more, she thought of buying a house for Da Qiao in the town. She might as well take this opportunity to check around.Before they said would buy a house for Da Qiao. Then little Wan'er got lost and this matter was delayed.\"Okay, then I'll go too. I'll go in and talk to them.\"After she finished speaking, she turned and walked into the house.The two little dumpling Dong Lin and Yi Ming each held one of Da Qiao's arm. Both were covered with tears in their eyes.Little Dong Lin said in his baby voice: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, you have to come back early. Little Dong Lin will obediently wait for you at home.\"Little Yi Ming followed suit: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, little Yi Ming will also obediently wait for you at home.\"This was said even more obedient than little Dong Lin.Little Dong Lin glared at him: groupie!Da Qiao grasped the two younger brothers' hand instead, \"Elder Sister will be back the day after tomorrow. As long as you are good, I will bring you candy to eat later!\"Little Dong Lin showed his little toothy teeth: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, I'm the most good!\"Little Yi Ming narrowed his eyes: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, I'm the most most good!\"Hearing that little Yi Ming had one more \"most\" than himself, little Dong Lin's cheeks were puffed. He was angry like a puffer fish.Qiao Hong Xia and Lin Hui couldn't help laughing when they saw their son fighting for favor.Da Qiao comforted the two younger brothers before running to Auntie Hui's side and touched her belly., Though she couldn't feel any movement, she still spoke, \"Little Brother, Elder Sister is going to town. Be good, don't make trouble for Mom, understand?\"Lin Hui smiled more tenderly, rubbed her hair and said, \"Little Brother is still young and can't understand you.\"The villagers on the side heard their conversation. Only then did they know that Lin Hui was pregnant.\"Old Second Qiao's wife, are you pregnant? When did it happen?\"Lin Hui smiled, \"It's only been over a month. Haven't stabilized yet, so I didn't tell everyone.\"There was a custom of announcing pregnancy after 100 days in the village. So when they heard Lin Hui's words, no one blame her for hiding it.Everyone said that she was lucky. How long had it been since she was married and she became pregnant so quickly!Speaking of which, Qiao Zhen Jun and Fang Xiao Juan were also really interesting. They have been married for more than six years and have no news after giving birth to a pair of twins.But as soon as they got divorced, they became pregnant very quickly!\"Lin Hui, you are still lucky. Unlike Fang Xiao Juan, who had been pregnant for more than seven months and gave birth to a stillbirth. Tsk tsk tsk!\"\"Yeah, I saw her being transported that day. Her whole body was covered in bloody. It scared me to death!\"\"Her life is strong. She can still survive this. I heard that she woke up a few days ago! By the way, Da Qiao, why didn't you see your mom?\"Xing Hua spat from within the crowd: \"Biological mother is in the hospital, she still has the mind to go to the town to play. She is really a white-eyed wolf!\"Da Qiao blushed. She bowed her head and said nothing.When everyone heard Xing Hua's words, they immediately felt that Da Qiao was too consciousless.Lin Hui held the child in her arms. Staring at Xing Hua, she retorted, \"When Fang Xiao Juan is discharged from the hospital, Da Qiao will visit her at Wang's house! While you, aren't you Fang Xiao Juan's best friend? Why didn't you visit her in the hospital?\"Pah!Got the mouth to talk about others, but not herself!Xing Hua's face turned red and white: \"I... aren't I not free?\"After saying this, everyone despised her.How can someone who isn't free have time to gossip here?To put it bluntly, it was a fake sisterhood!Xing Hua went red and white from the disdain. She squeezed out of the crowd and walked away swearing.Halfway on the road, she passed a lotus pond. Two big white geese saw her coming and suddenly dashed up from the lotus pond with quacking cries.The goose didn't appear much of a danger, but it was actually more vicious than a dog!If Qiao Xiu Zhi was the number one village tyrant in the village, these two big white geese were the number two in the village!When Xing Hua saw them coming up, she had a bad feeling in her heart.She had to go through this road to get home though. She crept away from them as much as possible.But for some reason, the two big white geese found her displeasing. They lowered their long necks and flew towards her with their wings flapping.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"Xing Hua was so frightened that her face turned pale. She reached out to hit them.The big white geese was like honey badger. No matter how big the enemy was, they had a two words motto: no fear!The big white geese was arrogant and pecked again with its mouth open.\"Aiya, you beasts! Scram!\"Xing Hua couldn't defend herself and got pecked on her butt. The pain made her cry.How can the big white geese be dismissed so easily?They continued flapping and chasing after Xing Hua and pecked as soon as they caught up.Xing Hua was mad and afraid. Panicked, she avoided the two big white geese's attack. Accidentally, she ran to the lotus pond. Her feet took one wrong step and her whole person rolled down toward the lotus pond.\"Help... I can't swim...\"Xing Hua splashed into the water. She drank in a lot of water from the lotus pond while struggling.The water in this lotus pond was mucky and smelled like a stinky ditch. The two big white geese often excreted in it, so the smell can be imagined.Xing Hua was so disgusted that she wanted to vomit. But currently the most important thing was saving her life.Favus-riddled Gou Sheng passed by. When he heard a woman calling for help, his eyes lit up, and he hurried over.But as soon as he came over and saw Xing Hua, he turned around and left: \"I'll go back and get your man to come and save you!\"\"Don't go. Come back... If you're willing to rescue me, I'll give you a yuan later!\" By the time her man came over, she would have drowned!Gou Sheng curled his lips and remarked, \"Is your life that worthless?\"Xing Hua trembled with anger: \"Three yuans. Quickly help me up!\"For the money's sake, Gou Sheng found a long pole, extended it over, and pulled her up.Even like this, Xing Hua had suffered a lot.As soon as she got back, she had skin allergies. Red rashes appeared all over her body. Vomiting and diarrhea occurred too. She lost ten pounds!At Wang Family's side. Because Wang Shui Sheng was the production leader, he could not leave the village easily. He asked his second younger brother to send Wang Xin Sheng to the army.Unexpectedly, old Second Wang came back in less than three days. And he brought back a piece of news... Wang Xin Sheng was dead!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65In midst of two younger brothers' reluctance, Da Qiao got into the car and left.This was her first time in a car. She was extremely curious.She leaned against her grandmother and touched the leather pad under her butt with her little hand. Then she touched the glass window again. Everything was so novel.The car was fast. Usually it took about two hours to walk. Now it took half an hour.Shen Family got up early in the morning and waited. Shen Tian You purposely put on new clothes and combed his hair back. He looked in the mirror, thinking he was very handsome!Once the the car arrived, Shen Tian You immediately ran up: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, you're finally here. I almost fell asleep from waiting!\"Da Qiao got off the car, saw his big push back hair and commented, \"Younger Brother Tian You, you don't seem to be the same as before?\"Shen Tian You raised his chin and asked confidently, \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, don't you think I look good today?\"He deliberately stole his dad's hair oil and combed this hairstyle. He felt that he was the most beautiful boy in the whole street now!Da Qiao pursed her lips and vaguely answered, \"You do.\"Truthfully, she felt that Younger Brother Tian You looked like he was a few years older. But under Younger Brother Tian You's expectant gaze, she couldn't really make herself hurt his self-confidence.Hearing this, Shen Tian You immediately became even happier: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, you really have the same taste as me! Come in, I'll show you my room!\"There were a lot of toys and snacks in his room. He can't wait to show it to Elder Sister Da Qiao. Unfortunately \"Elder Sister Eagle\" can't come. Otherwise it will be more fun.Qin Xiao Mei hit her child and lectured, \"You child. Your Elder Sister Da Qiao just came over. Can't you let her catch a breath before deciding anything!\"After she finished speaking, she immediately revealed a smile that couldn't be any more gentler: \"Da Qiao, you guys are here! Godmother misses you dearly!\"\"I misses Godmother too.\" Da Qiao raised her head and softly responded. Then she politely greeted everyone in Shen Family.\"Grandpa Shen, Granny Shen, Godfather, Auntie Shen, how are you? I'm Da Qiao. My grandmother and I have come to visit Shen's house for two days. We troubled you!\"Hearing the small dumpling saying such adult words, everyone was startled for a while. Then they couldn't help grinning.Seeing everyone smiling, Da Qiao curled her lips into a shy expression.Old Madam Shen looked at the little girl in front of her. Rosy and tender face, big eyes and red mouth. So delicate and beautiful as the people in the painting.She finally understood why her daughter-in-law insisted on recognizing this little girl as her goddaughter. She looked good, was well-behaved and had a sweet mouth. Who wouldn't like her when they saw her?In fact, Da Qiao didn't understand why the jade bead water's effect was more obvious on her than on her family when they drank it together.Qiao Xiu Zhi also got out of the car. When she heard Da Qiao's words, the corners of her mouth curved up.This child always surprised her.She handed over the dry goods and fresh vegetables that she brought. There was also a double-sided embroidery of flowers and rich peony embroidered by Xue Chuan. Since the family conditions were limited, there was no frame.\"Auntie Qiao, why are you so polite! Just coming in person is enough!\" Qin Xiao Mei really didn't expect the other party to be so polite. When she saw the double-sided embroidery inside, she couldn't help but exclaimed.Old Madam Shen changed her usual slow steady attitude, took the double-sided embroidery from her daughter-in-law's hand, and exclaimed with admiration, \"I haven't seen such exquisite double-sided embroidery for decades!\"Shen Family gathered around to look at the double-sided embroidery. The stitches on it were meticulous and neat and the patterns were exquisite and lifelike. It was indeed a fine work.After old Madam Shen finished admiring it, she pushed it back and said, \"This gift is too precious. Younger Sister Xiu Zhi, you should take it back. We can't accept it!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi replied, \"Last time, you guys gave Da Qiao a gold pendant. It's a courtesy. Please accept it.\"The gold pendant Qin Xiao Mei took off her son's neck last time was worth a lot of money. But with so many people present at that time, it was difficult for her to give the double-sided embroidery to Shen Family as a gift. The other two daughters-in-law would definitely have opinions.When it came to human interaction, there must be give and take. One can't blindly let the other party to only give. Such a relationship will not last long.Before Da Qiao came, she didn't know that her grandmother had brought such a double-sided embroidery over. At this time, she knew how precious the double-sided embroidery was by everyone's expression.She knew that her grandmother was doing all this for her. Her heart instantly warmed.She walked over and grasped her grandmother's hand, \"Grandmother, I truly truly love you!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi reached out and rubbed her head: \"Silly child.\"Although Shen Family had only been in contact with Qiao Xiu Zhi two or three times, they knew that she was a one-of-a-kind character. Never liked pretentious act. So after a moment of hesitation, they accepted the double-sided embroidery.They have jotted down this affection. They will be more good to Da Qiao in the future!Shen Tian You didn't know what double-sided embroidery is. He was in a hurry to pull Da Qiao in: \" Elder Sister Da Qiao, come in with me. I'll show you my family's yard!\"Da Qiao was pulled into running.Shen Family had four bedrooms and one living room with a yard. Although the yard wasn't very big, it was in a town. Many families of seven or eight were crowded into a room of about twenty square meters. This shows how rich Shen Family was.There wasn't anything like a rockery in the yard. It was a capitalist style. Even Shen Family didn't dare to have any rebellious style.There were a lot of flowers planted in the yard. It was currently the end of spring and early summer, which was the season of blooming flowers.As soon as one enter, one can see the colorful flowers laying in front of them. The fragrance of flowers gushed out.\"It's so beautiful!\" Da Qiao exclaimed when she saw the flowers in the yard.Shen Tian You said very proudly: \"My grandfather planted them. Which pot do you fancy? When you go back, take it back!\"There were several pots of very precious orchids. When old Mister Shen, who came in behind, heard his grandson's words, he was so angry that his beard twitched.Fortunately, Da Qiao wasn't a shallow-eyed person. She waved her hands repeatedly: \"No, no. I'm just going to look around.\"Seeing that Da Qiao wasn't a bear child, old Mister Shen breathed a sigh of relief and came over, \"Little girl, if you like it, I'll get you some seeds when you go home. You can grow them yourself.\"From the start, he casually remarked this. After all, such a small child was impatient to grow flowers and plants.Who knew that Da Qiao considered this seriously: \"Grandpa Shen, what kind of flowers easy to care for?\"There was only one pear tree planted in the yard at home. A bit monotonous. If they can plant some flowers and the like, it will definitely look good!Old Mister Shen stroked his beard and thought for a while, \"Jasmine is good. Bittersweet rose can work. If these two kinds of flowers are planted, the buds can be dried to make scented tea.\"Da Qiao's eyes lit up: \"Grandpa Shen, then I will plant these two kinds of flowers. Thank you!\"\"Treat here as your home in the future. You don't have to be so polite all the time.\"There had always been only one grandson in the family. Now there was a sweet, soft, very well-behaved, and sensible little girl, old Mister Shen's indestructible heart instantly softened.Although old Mister Shen wasn't in good health, he could speak loudly. Since Shen Tian You was born, he was used to his grandfather talking to him in a loud voice.At this moment, he suddenly heard his grandfather speak in a low and harmonious voice. It made his feet stagger under him and almost fall to the ground!So scary. After his mom and aunt's abnormal behavior, now it was his grandfather's turn!Fortunately, his mind was simple. He won't be jealous of Da Qiao because of this. Since his family liked Da Qiao, he was delighted.Shen Tian You took Da Qiao to look around. He introduced her to Shen Family's yard and rooms before taking her to his room. He took out all the candy and snacks prepared in the morning to share with her.At the end, he held a small eagle toy and spoke, \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, don't you think this is very similar to 'Elder Sister Eagle'?\"Da Qiao had never seen an eagle. So she asked honestly, \"What animal is this?\"\"This is an eagle. That's why I asked you if it is very similar to Elder Sister Ying, right?\" Shen Tian You flew the eagle around the air.Da Qiao was stunned: \"...\"She really couldn't see any similarity between Second Elder Cousin Sister and this eagle.Shen Tian You didn't need her to answer either. After playing enough, he shoved the eagle into her hand and stated, \"Take the eagle back to my Elder Sister Ying. Say that her younger brother is paying filial piety to her!\"Da Qiao almost burst out laughing.Even filial piety had came out. He was so immersed in the play!Qiao Xiu Zhi had seen the wealth of Shen family last time. Especially after comparing with Chu Family, she was more aware of this.Chu Tian Bai was the deputy county magistrate of Nanshan County. He surpassed Shen Shi Kai, the deputy director of the police station. However, Chu Tian Bai only lived in the government agency's family housing. Which contained two bedroom and a living room. It couldn't compare with Shen Family's.After the greeting, Qiao Xiu Zhi asked them about the house prices in the town.Hearing this, Qin Xiao Mei asked, \"Auntie Qiao, do you want to buy a house in the town? How big do you want to buy?\"If Qiao Family wanted to move to the town, it would be a good thing. She would be able to see Da Qiao often in the future.It was just that Qiao Family had a large population. If they want to buy it, they must buy at least five rooms, right?In fact, five rooms can't accommodate them. It was one branch one room. Adults and children all crowded together. It will definitely be very inconvenient. The most important factor, if all Qiao Family moved to the town, how would they make a living?As far as she knew, only Qiao Zhen Min in Qiao Family was working as a temporary worker in the town's supply and demand cooperative.Although she had a lot of questions in her heart, she didn't voice them out. After all, the two families weren't very familiar with each other.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't plan to hide it: \"We plan to buy a single room. If it is cheap, we can also buy a small two-bedroom. After the house is bought, it will be put in Da Qiao's name.\"Shen Family was shocked when they heard this.They knew Shen Family wasn't a patriarchal-minded family. Still, a son was raised guard against old age. No matter which family, it will be sons who provided old age care in the future, unless there were no sons.So if Qiao Xiu Zhi bought a house and wrote down a son's name, or the only grandson's name, they didn't find it strange. It was too weird to write it in the granddaughter's name, right?And the rest of Qiao Family. Wouldn't they have any opinions in their minds?Qiao Xiu Zhi wouldn't tell them about the century old Ganoderma lucidum. She just indifferently stated: \"I have already told my family about this matter. I should have come to buy it some time ago. But little Wan'er was missing at that time and got delayed until now.\"Shen Family listened to her intention and were very understanding and didn't get to the bottom of it.Qin Xiao Mei pondered for a while and responded, \"I have a younger cousin brother who happens to be working in the house management. I'll call him later to see if there is a suitable house.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi expressed her gratitude: \"I've troubled you. It's no hurry. Da Qiao is still small.\"Chatters and laughter passed and it was soon time for lunch.Shen Family was still very enthusiastic and prepared a large table of good dishes to greet them.There were Kung Pao Chicken, Braised Duck with Potatoes, Saucy Pork knuckle, Shrimp Fried Chinese Cabbage, Vegetarian Fried Shreds, and a large pot of old hen ginseng soup.Shen Tian You jumped back and forth with excitement: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, if you come here every day, I can eat so much delicious food every day!\"Hearing his childish words, everyone couldn't help laughing.Qin Xiao Mei liked Da Qiao very much. She knew it was impossible, but she still couldn't help but ask her, \"Da Qiao, do you like it here?\"Da Qiao blinked her long eyelashes and softly replied, \"I like it. The house here is very beautiful. There is running water and electric lights. The flowers in the yard are also very beautiful!\"Tap water and electricity had been popularized in towns, but not in rural areas. So this was Da Qiao's first time seeing tap water and electricity. It had greatly opened her country bumpkin's eyes!Qin Xiao Mei struck while the iron was hot, \"Then do you want to move to town and live with Godmother?\"Da Qiao shook her head. The two small tails on her head swayed with her movements: \"I like everyone very much. But I want to live with my parents and my grandparents. I will be sad if I can't see them.\"Qin Xiao Mei had always liked a little girl. Seeing that pretty and sensible Da Qiao, she had the urge to hide her and never let her leave.It would be great if Da Qiao was her daughter....After eating, Qin Xiao Mei and Shen Lin Lin took Da Qiao and Shen Tian You to the department store to buy things.Qiao Xiu Zhi joined them.Summer was coming. She wanted to buy some fabrics back to make some clothes for Xue Chuan. As for the others, they had already given 20 yuan to each branch for them to buy themselves. She didn't need to be concerned!They arrived at the department store. With the company of Shen Family, the attitude of the salesperson was completely different from last time. Warm smiles were on their face.Several salespeople recognized Qiao Xiu Zhi. Mainly because the last time was too memorable.With one hand, she raised a cabinet that can only be moved by three men. If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn't have believed it even if they got beaten to death!It was fortunate that she took action. Otherwise lives would be in danger. Three men who moved the good would be finished!Qin Xiao Mei sincerely treated Da Qiao as her daughter. First, she took her to the stationery store and bought her a set of books. Such as the series of \"One Hundred Thousand Whys\".Then she led her to the counter that sells ready-to-wear.There were ready-to-wear in department stores, but the styles weren't good-looking. There were even fewer clothes for children. Only one or two style.Qin Xiao Mei was very dissatisfied. Still, she bought two pieces: \"You can casually wear these two sets for now. I'll get my cousin in the capital to send a few sets over.\"Da Qiao saw Godmother had already bought a lot of things for her. So she quickly waved her little hand and spoke, \"No need, Godmother. I already have enough clothes to wear. Don't buy me any more, I will be feel embarrassed.\"Qin Xiao Mei loved her little adult behavior. She reached out and squeezed her little face, \"Godmother likes to buy it for you!\"Inadvertently, Qin Xiao Mei said something later generation's overbearing presidents would say.When the salespeople around heard this, they all looked at Da Qiao with envious eyes.They thought she was her biological daughter at the beginning. Surprisingly, she was just a goddaughter. This little girl's luck must too good, right?Shen Tian You watched his mom buy for Elder Sister Qiao. He wasn't jealous though. Instead, he gave pointers from time to time.More importantly, he always remembered to \"honor\" his Elder Sister Ying. He took a look that the colorful dresses his mom bought for Elder Sister Da Qiao and felt it looked pretty good. He planned to used his pocket money and one for his boss, Elder Sister Eagle.Qin Xiao Mei thought of the few girls in Qiao Family. Her son didn't need to pay. She bought a large, a medium and a small size in one go.When they came out of the department store and got into the car, Da Qiao noticed a person in front of her looked like her fourth aunt. However, two people just happened walked by and blocked her vision.Qiao Xiu Zhi pushed her slightly and urged, \"Why don't you go in quickly. Don't stand there.\"Then she hurried in. Once in the car, she checked again. There was already no trace of her fourth aunt.After waiting for the car to drive away, on the street opposite the department store, Qiao Hong Mei was wearing a dark blue clothes with lipstick on her lips.It was just that her skin was very dark. Not suitable for dark blue color as the color doesn't make her look young, but instead highlighted all her shortcomings.She didn't know though. She thought that the pedestrians on the road were looking at her because she was dressed beautifully. So she raised her chin even higher.Chen Lai Di eyed the department store on the opposite side, \"Mom, I think I saw Da Qiao and Grandma just now.\"Qiao Hong Mei was startled: \"Where did you see them?\"Chen Lai Di answered, \"They left in a car.\"Qiao Hong Mei's face darkened. She stretched out her hand and poked her second daughter's forehead, \"What nonsense are you talking about in the daytime? How can mud-legged family Qiao Family have the life to ride in a car?\"Being jabbed by her mom, Chen Lai Di's head went askew to the side. She wanted to say that she didn't see it wrongly, but the more she thought about it, the more she felt unsure.Just now she saw that little girl's skin was as fair as the white clouds in the sky. She was wearing a light blue dress. So beautiful that she felt deeply inferior.Although Da Qiao's skin was very fair, it didn't seem to be to that degree. As her mom said, Da Qiao lives in a rural place of chicken poo in the countryside. How can she get to know such a wealthy family?So, she must have mis-saw.Qiao Hong Mei's good mood was ruined because of her second daughter mentioning Qiao Family.She went home twice to borrow money and was kicked out by her mom twice. She couldn't swallow this breath no matter what!Every time she returned from Qiao's house, she encountered mishaps.The first time she was besieged by Asian tiger mosquitoes and her face was covered with swellings. She had to be admitted to the hospital. The second time she fell and had a wound on her forehead. She went to the hospital for a few stitches. Now there was still a scar on her forehead.Her mother-in-law and husband were very dissatisfied with the fact that she couldn't get the money back twice and had spent a lot of the family's money instead. Her man hadn't touched her for more than two months.She deeply hated her mom!That old wanted to see her divorce before she's satisfied?After shopping, Qin Xiao Mei was afraid that Da Qiao was hungry. She took her to a state-run restaurant to eat.It wasn't meal time. There was only a chef and a waitress in the state-run restaurant.Both of them looked bored. and the chef inside looked like he was about to fall asleep.When the waitress Wang Ni'er saw someone coming in, she pulled her face and pouted, \"Some people are blind. It's not even meal time and they came?\"When she took in Qin Xiao Mei's outfit and glanced at the car outside, the expression on her face changed immediately.These days, she can't offend anyone who can afford a car!Since it wasn't meal time, many things couldn't be ordered. What's more, everyone wanted to leave room in their stomach and go back to Shen's house to for a full meal. So they only ordered two bowls of noodles and two bowls of sweet potato sweet soup. These were shared among everyone.Da Qiao enjoyed the sweet potato sweet soup. She planned to go back and make some purses for Godmother and the others. Shen Family was really kind to her.After coming out of the state-run restaurant, Qiao Xiu Zhi got in the car. The car drove away immediately, so they didn't see a man staring at the car in front of the state-run restaurant with a shocked expression.It took Chen Xing a long time to recover from the shock. Immediately, he rushed into the state-run restaurant and latched on Wang Ni'er to ask, \"Who is that person who just left?\"Wang Ni'er glanced at him angrily and replied, \"How am I supposed to know who they are. Since they came in a car, they are definitely not ordinary people!\"Chen Xing anxiously uttered: \"Among the few people who came in, is there a tall woman in her forties or fifties? She dressed like a rural person?\"Wang Ni'er curled her lips: \"Yes, that woman looks like a rural person. She is definitely not from the same family as that young woman. Don't know what their relationship is. Elder Brother Xing, have you seen them?\"If they were poor relatives, it didn't seem like the case. After all, the woman was very polite and respectful to the rural woman.Chen Xing didn't answer. Just narrowed his eyes in contemplation.He wasn't sure just now. But now he was pretty certain that he didn't see it wrong. It was his mother-in-law, Qiao Xiu Zhi who got in the car!Shouldn't his mother-in-law be farming in the countryside?How could she came to town and get involved with someone like that?It seemed that he had to find a time for his wife to go back to the village to inquire.Seeing that Chen Xing didn't answer her, Wang Ni'er immediately pouted, \"Elder Brother Xing, I'm talking to you. Why are you ignoring me?\"Chen Xing came back to his senses and checked that no one around was paying attention to them. He reached out and touched her little hand, \"My darling, how could I bear to ignore you?\"Wang Ni'er swayed her body and coquettishly said, \"Elder Brother Xing, you said you wanted to marry me. So when will you divorce that ugly woman?\"Chen Xing laughed it off, \"Wait a while. Don't worry, I will definitely give you an explanation.\"Wang Ni'er was very dissatisfied with this answer. But this wasn't the place to talk. So she could only utter: \"Then you can't touch that woman, understand? You can only belong to me alone!\"Chen Xing smiled wryly: \"Don't worry, my darling, my whole body belongs to you alone!\"Wang Ni'er gave him a pointed gaze. Her face was completely coquettish....On the day that Da Qiao went to town, old Second Wang returned to the village with an unsettled face: \"Eldest Brother, Fifth Younger Brother is gone!\"When Wang Shui Sheng saw his Second Younger Brother come back alone, he knew in his heart that it was a bad omen.Hearing his words, his face sank: \"Speak clearly. What do you mean Fifth Younger Brother is gone? Did he escape?\"If that was the case, he'd better run away and never come back. Otherwise, he'll break his legs!Old Second Wang shook his head: \"It's not that he ran away. That day we...\"Three days ago, he left the village with his younger fifth brother, Wang Xin Sheng in tow to go to the army under his eldest brother's instruction.They rode a bus to the county city and were going to take the train. However, the train was late. The attendant said that the train take an hour or two to arrive. So Wang Xin Sheng suggested to go out for a walk.Because it was still daytime, old Second Wang felt that going out for a walk wasn't a big deal. He felt uncomfortable at the thought of staying at the train station for an hour or two.Wang Xin Sheng walked to the river near the train station.That river was known as Little Yellow River. The water in it was deep and turbid. the river was turbulent. It was said that many people who stumbled and fell didn't survive.He had sensed Fifth Younger Brother was standing too close to the river and was about to ask him to come over. At that time, he suddenly turned around.\"Second Brother, I know I'm an asshole. Not only am I a lazy bum, I had also caused such a calamity to my family. I really want to kill that woman Fang Xiao Juan! But Eldest Brother is right, if I really kill her, my family will suffer because of me in the future!\"When Wang Xin Sheng said this, his expression was remorse one moment and gritting his teeth the next.He had no doubt that if Fang Xiao Juan was in front of him, she would definitely be stabbed to death by him!Old Second Wang was also dissatisfied with what Fifth Younger Brother did in his heart. But he always had a clumsy mouth: All he said was: \"Leave it since, it already happened. Come over quickly. Let's go back to the station.\"Wang Xin Sheng didn't move and continued: \"Fang Xiao Juan, that woman is a cancer. As long as she have a hold on our Wang Family, our Wang Family will be threatened and ordered around by her. I don't want to live like this for the rest of my life! Second Elder Brother, after I'm gone, I'll leave Dad and Mom to you and the other elder brothers' care...\"When old Second Wang heard this, he felt something was up. His face became a little flustered: \"Old Fifth, what are you talking about? Second Elder Brother doesn't blame you anymore. Come here!\"\"I'm very happy to hear Second Elder Brother say that before I die!\"After speaking, he turned around and plunged into the river before old Second Wang could rush over.The river was deep and rushed. A few wave, his figure soon drowned and disappeared!Old Second Wang's legs became weak. He fell to the ground on the spot.He wanted to jump down to find him, but was stopped by a passerby.When the other party heard that his younger brother jumped into the river, he shook his head and said that he couldn't be rescued. He advised him to go to the police station immediately.Old Second Wang went to call the police with a pale face. The police at the police station were very responsible. On the spot, two small police officers were sent to the river to search.But after searching all day, nothing was found!The police told him that nine out of ten his younger brother was gone and the body may not be found. They will let the lower side to keep an eye out to see if there is a body floating there recently.The police had told him not to wait in the county. Instead, hurry back to inform his family.Old Second Wang returned to Qili Village with a pale face and soft legs.When Wang Shui Sheng heard the words, he fell off the chair. Unable to utter a word for a long time.He hated Wang Xin Sheng for bringing so much trouble to the family and he had resented his parents for spoiling him to this point. But no matter how bad he was, he was still his own brother. He never wanted him to die!Old Second Wang spoke with trembling lips: \"Eldest Brother, what should... we do?\"After a long time, Wang Shui Sheng uttered with a choked voice, \"The body haven't been found yet, so he might not be gone. Don't say anything yet. I'll make some arrangements before going to the county town with you tomorrow to search for him!\"When old Second Wang came back, many villagers saw it. It was impossible to hide it from Wang Family.So Wang Shui Sheng told his family that old Second Wang lost the letter of introduction and rushed back to ask him to write another one. As for Wang Xin Sheng, he stayed at a friend's house in Lao San County.When Wang Family heard that the letter of introduction was lost, they didn't ask any further questions. However, old Second Wang's expression was a little strange. His wife pulled it out of him that night.Old Second Wang's wife found out that Wang Xin Sheng had jumped into the river and didn't speak for a long time. What's more, she kept having a bad premonition in her heart. She felt that the sky was about to fall.It would be great if Wang Xin Sheng could be found. If not, could her mother-in-law bear this news?Wang Shui Sheng handed over the matters to the deputy leader, accountant, and point tracker. Then he hurriedly went to the county with his second younger brother.After searching in the county for a day, the police station sent someone to inform them that Wang Xin Sheng's body was found!When Wang Shui Sheng heard the policeman's words, his vision darkened and his body swayed: \"Sir Policeman, are you sure that the body is my brother?\"The little policeman responded: \"I'm not sure. So we need you family members to confirm it! But the clothes and characteristics of the corpse are very consistent with the information you left when you called the police. So it's very likely that it's your family member. Hurry up and follow me!\"Two brothers, one with a white face and the other with their wobbly legs, came to the station's morgue.As soon as old Second Wang saw the corpse, he rolled his eyes and fainted on the spot.The corpse was wearing the same clothes that Wang Xin Sheng wore the day he jumped into the river!Wang Shui Sheng's heart sank again and again. It sank down to a never-appearing bottom. He walked over to identify the body with trembling hands.After a few days of soaking and the warming weather, the corpse had already became swollen. The facial features were completely deformed.Wang Shui Sheng endured his disgust and leaned towards the left eyebrow of the corpse. Unexpectedly, he discover a large piece of flesh missing there.He raised his head and asked the policeman standing at the door, \"Sir Policeman, what's the matter with the wound on this corpse?\"There was a large scar on Wang Xin Sheng's left eyebrow. Even if it was swollen, it should still leave traces.The policeman answered: \"The body has been floating in the river for a few days. It may hit a stone by the river. Or maybe it was eaten by a fish. Quickly confirm, is this person your brother?\"Wang Shui Sheng frowned. He wanted to exclaim, why did it have to be the left eyebrow that got damaged?But with the right clothes, height, and shape, he really couldn't deceive himself that the corpse wasn't Wang Xin Sheng!Under the piercing gaze of the little policeman, he nodded with difficulty: \"It should be my brother.\"The little policeman said: \"Don't be should or shouldn't. It's a yes or no. Answer it again, is it him?\"Wang Shui Sheng nodded with a pale face: \"Yes!\"\"That's it then. Come out and sign your name. Quickly bring the body back!\" The little policeman turned around and walked out.As soon as Wang Shui Sheng saw the little policeman leave, he raised his hand and slapped himself twice!If he hadn't forced Fifth Younger Brother to go, he wouldn't have done such a stupid thing.He woke Second Younger Brother with a white face and then the two went to go through the formalities.After searching in the county for a long time, there was no carriage willing to carry the corpse. Finally, with the help of the police, a tractor was found and the corpse was carried back to the village at a high price.The two brothers were sitting on the tractor with the same sadness and confusion on their faces. How should they tell their parents about this when they went back?...The second day after going to town, Qiao Xiu Zhi followed Qin Xiao Mei to the housing management office to check the properties.There were a few, but none of them fit.It was either too expensive or too shabby or the location was too remote.Qiao Xiu Zhi wasn't in a hurry. She won't buy it since there was no suitable one. Anyway, Da Qiao was only seven years old now. She will definitely find a suitable house before the child grows up.Seeing that she hadn't found a suitable house, Qin Xiao Mei said she would help her keep an eye out.Not all houses in the town were sold through the housing management office. Some were sold privately. This way, the house was sold through acquaintance's word of mouth.Qiao Xiu Zhi thanked her. In the afternoon of the next day, she took Da Qiao back to Qili Village in the car.The villagers were very envious when they saw Da Qiao wearing new clothes and carrying large bags and small bags!\"Oh, the deputy chief's goddaughter is different. She looked completely like the city people!\"\"Truly. Da Qiao looks more and more blessed! She used to stutter and old Second Qiao was paralyzed. Everyone thought that she will have a hard time for her to find a husband family once she grows up. But now, her stutter is gone. Old Second Qiao's leg healed. More importantly, she has become the deputy chief's goddaughter. Tsk tsk tsk, this luck is really enviable. I can't envy enough!\"\"Da Qiao, my Da Ya is the same age as you. I will get her come to play with you in the future?\"\"My Er Ni is about the same age. You guys can go to school together in the future. If you guys get familiar, take my Er Ni to your godfather's house to play!\"These people who let their daughters play with Da Qiao were the same people who thought Da Qiao was a calamity and told their children not to play with her.Da Qiao pursed her lips and said nothing.Her temperament was like her grandfather; didn't like to be rude. But that didn't mean she was a fool.She knew that these people didn't really want to be friends with her. They only saw her deputy chief's goddaughter position.Qiao Xiu Zhi gave these people a chilly gaze and said coldly, \"If I remember correctly, didn't you say that Da Qiao was a calamity and was born with bad luck. Your children shouldn't play with Da Qiao, no? Why did you change your mind so quickly?\"Those few people didn't expect Qiao Xiu Zhi to pull off their face in front of so many people. Their faces turned red and white with anger.Someone apologetically smiled, \"Aunt Xiu Zhi, those words are nonsense. Don't take it to heart!\"\"Yeah, yeah. We had no eyes at the time. We listened to what Da Qiao's mom said. Now we know that we were wrong!\"Someone bitterly remarked: \"Bah! Isn't it just becoming a deputy chief's goddaughter? What's so great? If you have the ability, make them pamper you for a lifetime!\"\"Ain't that right. Maybe after a while, they will forget that there is such a goddaughter!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi felt that it was a waste of words to explain to these idiots: \"Go in. If you see these idiots in the future, try to stay away from them. If not, they will reduce your intelligence!\"Qiao Dong Ying felt that her grandmother was quite sassy and responded loudly: \"I understand, Grandmother. We will cherish life and stay away from idiots!\"An Ping felt his elder sister's words were interesting and yelled: \"Cherish life and stay away from idiots!\"Da Qiao and Qiao Dong He looked at each other and repeated.Those women were trembling with fury!If it wasn't for Qiao Xiu Zhi's fists being too hard, they would definitely rush to tear their mouths apart!After Qiao Family went inside, the onlookers gradually dispersed.Xiao Qiao walked out from behind a big tree. Her eyes were red with jealousy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66Shen Family was very wealthy. Not only had they bought a lot of things for Da Qiao, but also for her siblings.Qiao Dong He and Qiao Dong Ying got a set of dress. An Ping had a pair of Warrior sneaker. Little Wan'er and other two little dumpling each received half a jin of white rabbit candies each. Lin Hui got two cans of malted milk extract.Malted milk was very precious. Even the department store in town was often out of stock.These two jars were sent from the capital by Qin Xiao Mei's elder cousin sister. It was said to be very nutritious to the fetus.Wan Chun Ju was satisfied that her three children had received good gifts. Still, she was jealous that Da Qiao had received more than her own children.This bootlicker Da Qiao must have been flattering a lot during this trip!While thinking about it, she picked up the water on the table to drink. The next moment she screamed: \"Ouch... it's bloody hot!\"She was so jealous of Da Qiao's gift just now that she forgot that the water in the old porcelain bowl had just been boiled. So drinking it like this made her tongue numb all at once!Her mouth sore hadn't yet healed. Now it got burned, it was\u00a0adding frost on top of the snow!\"It hurts! It hurts!\"Wan Chun Ju croaked with her mouth open. Unfortunately, no one came to care for her despite calling for a long time!So infuriating!Chen Qiao Qiao sat in the corner with her head bowed. She seem to be absent-minded.Qiao Zhen Min set off for work in the county this morning. She didn't know the news that he was leaving until yesterday. This goes to show that he never planned to take her with him from beginning to end!He hadn't touched her since little Wan'er was lost!Now that they were separated from each other, what feelings were there between husband and wife?Was it really because of little Wan'er that he despised her like this?Or was he seeing other women outside?Chen Qiao Qiao's fingernails were deeply pinched into the palm of her hand. But she felt no pain at all.Qiao Xiu Zhi put the fabric for Xue Chuan's clothes into the room. When she came out, she heard Liu Cui Hua calling her at the door.\"Auntie Xiu Zhi, you're back?\" Liu Cui Hua merrily spoke.\"Yes. I just came back. You're looking for me for something?\"Although Liu Cui Hua used to spend time with Song Jin Lai's wife and the other gossipy women, she knew when to stop. So Qiao Xiu Zhi had a good impression of her.Liu Cui Hua nodded: \"Didn't you say last time that you wanted to arrange for your eldest daughter-in-law to go to the pigsty to work? Yesterday, before my spouse went to the county, he told me that there was only one doctor in the health center and it's too busy. Sometimes, the doctor have to ask for leave or get sick or something. Then there is no one in the health center.\"\"Let me ask Chen Qiao Qiao if she is willing to go to the health center to help and learn simple medical care. If she is willing to go, her work in the pigsty will be freed up for Eldest Qiao's wife. \"Although the production team's health center wasn't big, people from several nearby production teams went there to see a doctor. So there were quite a few people.In addition, the villagers didn't like to go to the hospital to see a doctor. When they have a headache, they go directly to the health center to see a doctor. Therefore, every time the season changes, there were so many people with the flu. One doctor can\u2019t handle it all.The female doctor who was transferred had complained before and even submitted an application to the community to ask for more staff. Identifying an illness and prescribing medicine wasn't a joke. If one didn\u2019t have knowledge in this aspect, how can anyone dare to send someone over?But it couldn't go on like this. So after thinking about it, they came up with a compromise solution. Get a highly educated person to go to the health center to help and study at the same time.After one or two years of study, there will be another assessment. If one pass the exam, it will be considered as having cultivated a useful talent for the production team!In the entire production team, old Fifth Qiao's wife, Chen Qiao Qiao had the highest education.Chen Qiao Qiao graduated from high school. If were for being unable to take college entrance exam, she might be a college student now!When Qiao Xiu Zhi heard these words, she nodded, \"It is much better to study in the health center than working in the pigsty. Still, I have to ask her for her opinion on this matter.\"An envious expression appeared on Liu Cui Hua's face: \"Auntie Xiu Zhi is really a good mother-in-law. If other people hear that going to the health center, they will definitely agree to it. How can they possibly ask their daughter-in-law's opinion!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi smiled: \"Wait a minute, I'll go in and ask her. Why don't you come in and sit down?\"Liu Cui Hua waved: \"No need, I'll just wait here. It's getting late, I need to go back to make dinner in a bit!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't force her. She turned around, walked back to the main room, and told Chen Qiao Qiao about the matter. Let her decide for herself.When Chen Qiao Qiao heard it, she was stunned before replying, \"Alright.\"The road of following along to the county was blocked by her man himself. She could only stay in this place full of chicken poo and pig dung.In this case, she must choose a job that makes her feel better.Wan Chun Ju gritted her teeth with envy when she heard that Chen Qiao Qiao could go to work in the health center.But she can't even write her own name, so it was never her turn.On second thought, as soon as Chen Qiao Qiao leaves, she will soon be able to work in the pigsty!Very good!Gold Bullion, here she comes!...With the help of her two elder cousin sisters, Da Qiao moved things back to Qiao's small house.When passing the pigsty, she noticed Huo Chi looking towards her. She was about to say hello to him, but he turned and walked into the pigsty as if he didn't see her.She was stunned for a moment, wondering if she heard it wrong. She seemed to hear him snort.She should have heard it wrong. At such a long distance, even if he harrumphed, she should not be able to hear it.Back in Qiao's small house, Pi Pi seemed to hear her footsteps from afar. He ran to the courtyard gate to wait for her with a wildly wagging tail.\"Pi Pi, I'm back. Have you been obediently guarding home?\"\"Woof woof woof...\"Pi Pi surrounded her. His paws kept pawing her. The movements were very light and wouldn't hurt her in the slightest.Every time Qiao Dong Ying heard the name \"Pi Pi\", she found it extremely funny. You Rou in the old house didn't seem to be any better.You Rou from the old house's name clashed with Fang Family's youngest grandson. Every time someone mentioned this, old woman Fang immediately scolded the heaven and the earth.Qiao Dong He likes small animals very much. She was very familiar with the two dogs at home.As soon as Da Qiao walked into the yard, she suddenly heard the sound of vomiting coming from the house.She was startled and hurried in with the things in her arms.As soon as she entered the door, she saw Auntie Hui leaning on the kang. Her face turning pale from vomiting: \"Mom, what's wrong?\"When Lin Hui saw her coming back, she managed to squeeze out a smile despite her discomfort, \"Da Qiao, you're back? Mom has morning sickness. Pregnant women experience this. You don't have to worry.\"Da Qiao then remembered Eldest Aunt seemed to have morning sickness before. But Eldest Aunt didn't like her. She won't put a hot face on a cold butt, so she didn't care much about her wellbeing.At this moment, seeing Auntie Hui vomiting and her pale face, she was distressed. In less than two days, she seemed to have lost weight. \"Mom, can you eat even during your morning sickness?\"Lin Hui nodded: \"Mom's appetite have been a bit poor for a while. But it will be fine once it pass. Don't worry about Mom.\"Seeing her like this, little Dong Lin had been tearful with worry. So she asked Hong Xia to take him out to play.Although Auntie Hui kept telling her not to worry, Da Qiao couldn't let it go.She tilted her head and pondered: \"Mom, are you hungry? I'll cook some egg and millet congee for you, okay?\"No one in the village grew millet. This millet was bought from a supply and demand cooperative. Godmother said that millet was very nourishing, especially for pregnant women.Lin Hui just finished vomiting and didn't want to eat anything.But seeing the child's wet eyes looking at her like a fawn, her heart softened and nodded, \"Okay, then Mom will wait for your millet congee.\"Da Qiao's eyes lit up. Pursing her lips, she stated, \"Mom, wait a moment, I'll be quick.\"After speaking, she turned around and dashed towards the kitchen.Qiao Dong He put down her things and ran to the kitchen to help.When Cousin Sister wasn't paying attention, Da Qiao stealthily threw a jade bead into the millet congee and let it boil together with the millet congee.Before the millet congee was ready, the family came back.\"Elder Sister Da Qiao, you're finally back. Little Yi Ming kept missing you!\"As soon as little Yi Ming heard that his elder sister Da Qiao come back, he hurriedly swung his short legs and ran over.Little Dong Lin was a step slower. He chased after him like a gust of wind: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, little Dong Lin kept kept missing you!\"Last time, little Yi Ming said one more \"most\". This time he had to say one more \"kept\". He can't lose to him every time!When everyone heard the two's childish voice, they couldn't help laughing.Da Qiao hugged the two little dumplings and squeezed their faces, \"Have you been good these two days?\"Little Yi Ming responded loudly: \"Yes. Little Yi Ming is most most most most good!\"Little Dong Lin took in how sneaky Little Yi Ming was. He actually said a lot of 'most' in one breath. To be not outdone, he immediately spoke: \"Little Dong Lin is the most, most, most, most, most, most, most, most, most...good!\"Saying so many \"most\" in one breath made him really exhausted!\"Hahaha...\" Qiao Dong Ying, who was standing at the door of the kitchen, laughed loudly, \"Why are you two little guys so cute?\"Little Dong Lin responded first this time, \"Yes, we are so cute!\"Little Yi Ming spun his small eyes and said, \"We are just as cute as Elder Sister Da Qiao!\"Although little Yi Ming was young, his little mouth was like smeared with honey. What will he be like once he grow up?Little Dong Lin saw that everyone's attention was taken away by little Yi Ming again. His cheeks were puffed and he became a puffer fish again.Da Qiao took out the hawthorn rolls, sour plum powder, haw flakes and other snacks that was bought in the town for the two younger brothers to eat.The two little dumplings instantly grinned and their eyebrows curved. Like two little pups, they stuck Da Qiao.After cooking the millet congee, Da Qiao added two pieces of brown sugar in it. After the brown sugar melted, the millet porridge wasn't so hot.She immediately brought it to Auntie Hui.Lin Hui had no appetite at first. Nor could she stand the smell of eggs before. But now she was holding the egg and millet congee cooked by Da Qiao, she suddenly felt hungry!She scooped up a spoonful of millet congee and drank it. After vomiting for a long time, her stomach was finally warmed. Her whole body feel comfortable.\"Mom, how is it? Can you eat it?\" Da Qiao asked nervously with blinking long eyelashes.Lin Hui took a few sips before stopping to respond: \"It's delicious, thank you, Da Qiao. Mom likes it very much!\"Da Qiao's brows and eyes curved into a crescent with a smile. Then she pursed her red lips and declared, \"Then I will cook for Mom in the future. Just tell me what you want to eat, Mom!\"Qiao Zhen Jun came in sweating profusely from the outside with a few blue-colored fruits. When he saw Lin Hui eating, he was pleasantly surprised: \"You're not vomit anymore?\"In the past two days, Lin Hui ate and vomited. Almost consuming nothing. Just now, she suddenly wanted to eat sour fruit, so he immediately went to the forest to find it.However, many wild fruits have not grown yet in this season. He searched the whole mountain and forest, only to find two or three. And they looked ugly.Lin Hui smiled softly and answered, \"Yes, when Da Qiao came back to see that I hadn't eaten, she personally cooked me an egg and millet congee. I got hungry from the smell.\"More importantly, she didn't feel nausea after eating and her stomach feels very comfortable!Hearing this, Qiao Zhen Jun breathed a sigh of relief: \"That's great! Da Qiao is really a little lucky star in our family. As soon as she comes back, you are able to eat immediately!\"Lin Hui rubbed the child's hair and smiled, \"Yes, Da Qiao is my precious little lucky star!\"When Da Qiao heard her parents' words, she delighted. Her little lips burst into a bright smile.It was great that she wasn't a calamity after all!...The day was peaceful for two days. Upon Wang Family's two brothers' return, this peace shatter on the third day!When the tractor entered the village, the villagers were doing farm work in the fields. As soon as the tractor came in, it immediately attracted everyone's attention.\"Oh, isn't that the leader? The leader actually came back in a tractor!\"\"That's a tractor. I've never seen a tractor before. This time, it's an eye-opener!\"\"Is this tractor approved by the community for our production team?\"Tractors were rare machines. Only the two or three most productive production teams in the entire community were eligible to own them.The productivity of Qili production team was neither high or low. They had submitted an application to the community before, but the community had no money. So it had never been approved.Now everyone saw the tractor, they can't help but get excited.If they have a tractor, they will in limelight when going out. Also, it will also be much more convenient to do things in the future!With a weed in his mouth, favus-riddled Gou Sheng's gaze landed on the cart behind the tractor: \"Didn't you see what's behind the tractor? Aren't you curious about what it is?\"A cart was tied to the back of the tractor with a rope. On the cart was an elongated object, which was covered with a cloth. It was difficult to see what was inside.Naturally, everyone had noticed it. But compared with the tractor, everyone's interest in it was naturally not so strong.Now that favus-riddled Gou Sheng pointed it out, many people started making guesses.\"Do you think there will be a wild boar on it? I think it looks quite similar!\"\"Keep dreaming. Wild boars! If there is a wild boar, do you think everyone is Auntie Xiu Zhi. Wild boars can be killed with one punch?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi killed a wild boar during the New Year. Everyone got a share of pork. Although the meat of the wild boar was tough and gamey, it was still meat. No one would dislike it.Many people were now recollecting that day's scene. They kept hoping for another wild boar to come down the mountain. That way, everyone can eat pork again.Gou Sheng discarded the tools in his hand, ran towards the road, and jumped on the back of the tractor.A rancid smell rushed towards him. He almost vomited: \"I say, leader, what is on this cart? Why does it smell so strong?\"Saying that, he reached out his hand to lift the cloth.At this moment, Wang Shui Sheng jumped off the tractor with a livid face. He rushed over, dragged Gou Sheng down, and pressed him on the ground to wildly beat.Gou Sheng was stunned from the beating: \"Ouch... Leader, spare my life! Are you trying to kill me?\"Old Second Wang was startled by his eldest brother's action. He quickly jumped down, grabbed his eldest brother, and urged, \"Eldest Brother, don't be impulsive!\"Everyone was stunned by this scene!Although Wang Shui Sheng's ability as a leader was average, he had a very good temper. He was recognized as a good man. Since he became the team leader, they had never seen him angry with anyone like this.Although favus-riddled Gou Sheng was a little bit impish, there was nothing wrong with having a glance. Was it necessary to make a scene and beat people?Everyone became more and more curious about what was on the cart.When old Second Wang's wife saw the object on the scooter, her whole body couldn't help trembling.Her face was even paler now, as if she was about to collapse at any moment.Liu Cui Hua supported her and asked, \"What's the matter with you? Where do you feel unwell?\"Old Second Wang's lips trembled and she lowered her voice: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, something happened! Something happened!\"The blue veins on Wang Shui Sheng's forehead were bulging. After taking a long time, he pulled himself together and loosened favus-riddled Gou Sheng's collar. He returned to the tractor and let the driver pull the cart back to Wang's house.Everyone's curiosity had been hoisted to the highest point. If they didn't need to continue to work now, everyone would follow!The tractor stopped at the end of the road, because the road inside wasn't easy to drive on.Wang Shui Sheng untied the rope to the cart with a sullen face. Then he paid the rest of the money to the driver.The driver counted the money and saw that there was nothing wrong. He reached out and patted his shoulder, \"My condolences. I'm leaving!\"At the beginning, he didn't want to take this job. Not only was the journey long, it was sending a corpse. Which was very unlucky!But the two brothers begged him bitterly. Seeing that they were so pitiful, his heart softened and accepted. Don't know why his brother can't think it through at such a young age.Old Second Wang drooped his head: \"Eldest Brother, my heart feel a little flustered, I don't dare to go home!\"His parents loved Fifth Younger Brother the most. When they see the fifth brother's body, don't know what will happen!Wang Shui Sheng gritted his teeth and stated, \"Let's go.\"No matter how afraid they were, they have to go back and face it. Can't leave Wang Xin Sheng's body hanging around here!The two brothers pushed the cart together and headed home.Arriving at the gate of the yard, old Madam Wang happened to come out to feed the chickens. When she saw the two brothers coming back, she was stunned and said, \"Old Second, why are you back again?\"Old Second just came back a few days ago to ask for a letter of introduction. Eldest followed him. Did he lose the letter of introduction again this time?Old Second Wang's lips trembled so much that he couldn't utter a word.Wang Family's children gathered around and wanted to lift the cloth. Wang Shui Sheng shouted: \"Get out of here!\"Old Madam Wang felt sorry for her grandson and reprimanded: \"The children are ignorant. Just tell them nicely. Why do you need to yell at the children like this?\"Wang Shui Sheng didn't speak. He pushed the cart into the yard and knelt down toward his mom with a \"bang\".Old Madam Wang was taken aback. She took two steps back, and said with a confused expression: \"Eldest, what are you doing?\"When old Mister Wang heard the movement, he came out and saw this scene. His eyes suddenly fell on the cart. His eyes widened at once: \"Eldest...what is on the cart?\"Wang Shui Sheng started sobbing: \"Dad, Mom, Son has done you wrong. Fifth Younger Brother...he committed suicide by jumping into the river!\"A bolt from the blue sky!It exploded on the heads of the two elderly!Old Madam Wang stared at Eldest Son. The blood on her body continued to flow up: \"Eldest, you, you...what did you say?\"She understood every word Eldest Son said, but suddenly she couldn't understand it when pieced together.When old Mister Wang saw his eldest son kneeling on the ground just now, he had a bad guess in his heart. Now that the hunch was confirmed, his body swayed a bit. If he wasn't supported by the pillar beside him, he would have fallen down!Wang Shui Sheng stood up and tried to help his dad, but was pushed away.Old Mister Wang staggered to the cart and lifted the cloth on it with trembling hands. Next moment, he stepped back a good few steps in fright.The corpse that had been swollen from the soaking and created this eye-opening phenomenon. Quite a scary sight!Wang Shui Sheng hurriedly went up to support his dad. However, it slipped his mind that old Madam Wang behind him could see the corpse on the cart. Her fixated eyes were almost protruding.She suddenly felt that it was difficult to breathe and a stream of heat rushed to her forehead. She fell down with a shake of her body.\"Mom!\" Wang Shui Sheng and old Second Wan both shouted at the same time.\"Old woman!\" Old Mister Wang couldn't pay heed of himself anymore and turned around to see his wife.Old Madam Wang fell to the ground. Her mouth slanted, while her body twitching uncontrollably. She couldn't speak at all!It was stroke!Wang Shui Sheng had seen an old man having a stroke in the village before. Exactly what his mom was like now!He was shocked and uttered, \"Mom may have suffered a stroke. Got to hurry to the town hospital!\"After he finished speaking, he rushed out and went to the production team office to get a horse carriage.Not long after the villagers suppressed their curiosity and started working, they suddenly saw their leader rushing towards the town with a black face in a carriage.What was going on?\"Why do I feel that something has happened to Wang Family? Look at leader's face. It's darker than the bottom of the pot!\"\"I think so too! But what do you think happened?\"Liu Cui Hua had already gotten the information from her sister-in-law just now. But when she saw her man exiting the village in a carriage, her heart jumped wildly.She hurriedly asked for leave with the deputy leader and then ran towards the house.Old Second Wang's wife saw that her eldest sister-in-law had asked for leave and was startled for a while. Then she ran off with the leave too.When everyone saw that Wang Family left one after another, they couldn't help but guess.By the end of the evening, everyone found out.Wang Xin Sheng was dead!The news exploded in the village in an instant!Why did someone who was perfectly fine seven or eight days ago die so suddenly?At that time, many people knew that Wang Xin Sheng was going to the army and said a lot of bitter words.Wanting to join the army these days was not something one can do just cause they want to. Many people wanted to join the army, but there was no way to get in.Idler Wang Xin Sheng could join the army because there was connection in the army, no?Who could have thought that after going for a few days, he came back as a corpse!Everyone ran to Wang's house and surrounded Wang's house.Liu Cui Hua gritted her teeth and didn't say anything. She drove out all the people who came to inquire about the news....When Fang Xiao Juan first arrived here through rebirth, she had settled down for a few days.One, her body was too weak. Second, she still hadn't figure out the situation. And third, she didn't act up due to wanting to negotiate conditions with Wang Family.But as her health got better and better and Wang Family treated her like a master, her heart gradually swelled up.She must eat fine flour every day. The stuff made of coarse flour choked her throat and she couldn't eat it.Every day, she demanded that old Fourth Wang\u2019s wife to push her out to bask in the sun for an hour. Even though she can walk by herself, she just wanted others to push her!Before going to sleep every day, old Fourth Wang's must kill mosquitoes for her. If a mosquito bites her while sleeping, she will definitely scold her.In order to take care of her these few days, old Fourth Wang's wife was so angry that her mouth grew mouth sore!When Wang Shui Sheng came into the hospital with old Madam Wang, Fang Xiao Juan was losing her temper at the entrance of the hospital because she wanted to eat wontons. However, old Fourth Wang's wife didn't want to buy them for her.So she pointed at old Fourth Wang's wife's nose outside and cursed.Old Fourth Wang's wife was gnashing her teeth and glaring at her. Just as she was about to go all out with her, she saw Wang Shui Sheng carrying her mother-in-law and rushing towards them. Following them was her panting father-in-law.She had no heart to argue with Fang Xiao Juan. She ran over and asked, \"Eldest Brother, what's wrong with Mom?\"Wang Shui Sheng gasped for air and replied, \"Mom may have had a stroke. Hurry ... hurry in and inform the doctor!\"Old Fourth Wang's wife's heart thumped. She turned around to run, but her clothes was unexpectedly caught by Fang Xiao Juan.Fang Xiao Juan raised her chin and declared, \"Go buy me a bowl of wontons first. The wontons from the supply and demand cooperative will be sold out once the time has passed!\"Old Fourth Wang's wife was exasperated that her face turned black: \"Fang Xiao Juan, you're sick! Mom met with mishap and you want me to buy you wontons at this time. Do you still have a conscience?\"Fang Xiao Juan indifferently responded, \"Don't worry, Mom will be fine!\"In her last life, old Madam Wang lived to be ninety years old. She was one of the few long-lived elderly in the village!When she was eighty-eight years old, Wang Xin Sheng went back to the village to set up an open banquet.The open banquet was set up for three days and three nights. She had joined at that time.Since old Madam Wang won't die, what was there to be anxious about? Better to buy her a bowl of wontons and come back!Old Fourth Wang's wife's face was steaming red. Old Fourth Wang happened to arrive now. Wang Shui Sheng shoved his mom into the arms of old Fourth Wang: \"Mom has a stroke. You take Mom in to find a doctor now!\"Old Fourth Wang was stunned for a moment. Once he reacted, he immediately ran towards the hospital.With a dark face, Wang Shui Sheng walked toward Fang Xiao Juan. Then his foot was raised and kicked at her fiercely!Fang Xiao Juan was kicked over. Her whole body fell backward. Her head hit the ground. The pain made her cry.Wang Shui Sheng had always despised men who beat women, but today he couldn't help it!If it weren't for this woman, his fifth younger brother wouldn't have committed suicide!If his fifth younger brother wasn't dead, his mom won't be like this!At this point, this woman was still making trouble!He chased after her again and kicked Fang Xiao Juan's stomach: \"Bitch, if you dare to stir trouble again, I'll kill you now!\"Fang Xiao Juan stared at the furious Wang Shui Sheng. Her heart shrunk violently.But seeing passers-by noticing them, she immediately wailed: \"Ouch, my goddess! Murder! Help, I'm going to be beaten to death!\"\"If you don't want your life, then keep making trouble!\" Wang Shui Sheng dropped these words and ran towards the hospital.Old Fourth Wang's wife saw Fang Xiao Juan being beaten and her heart burst with joy!She had endured this woman for too long. If it wasn't for family, she would have to beat her up long ago!She spat at Fang Xiao Juan before running in.Fang Xiao Juan was lying on the ground. Her body was sore all over. She gasped in pain and cursed: \"Alright, Wang Family, you turtle bastards. Dare to beat this old lady? I'll go to the police station and report you! \"But when the gatekeeper of the hospital came to ask her if she wanted to call the police, she hesitated.Wang Shui Sheng's appearance just now was too cruel and scary. She still felt a little cowardly when she recall it.What's more, before she grasp Wang Xin Sheng's heart, she can't fall out with Wang Family for the time being. Stepping back 10,000 steps, she still hadn't got the 800 yuan!So she gritted her teeth again and finally gave up calling the police.Everyone saw her shouting so miserably just now. Never thought she wouldn't call the police now. They all felt that she had some sickness in her brain!...Wang Shui Sheng and old Mister Wang didn't return that night. The entire Wang Family spent it in anxiety and fear.Qiao Family knew what happened to Wang Family.During this time, Wang Family had the intention to make friends with Qiao Family. They had given them a lot of convenience. Qiao Xiu Zhi naturally noticed.After night fell, she went to Wang's house with a few eggs and a snack bought in the town.All evening, Liu Cui Hua was annoyed by the villagers. Only now, it was quiet for a while. There was a knock on the door. Her brows were furrowed!She opened the door with a dark face and was about to break into scolding. But seeing Qiao Xiu Zhi standing at the door, she spoke, \"Auntie Xiu Zhi, why are you here at this time?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't even plan to go in. She handed the things over and said, \"I've had heard about your family situation. If you need any help, feel free to speak up.\"Liu Cui Hua looked at the things in her hands. A warm feeling surged in her heart: \"Thank you Auntie Xiu Zhi. I will not be polite with you. If there is any need, I will definitely speak to Auntie. But Auntie, you can take these things back.\"She now finally understood why her man asked her to be amicable to Qiao Family.After what happened to Wang Family today, many people came here under the banner of concern, They weren't really worried though. Just curious!There were very few people who really want to help like Auntie Xiu Zhi!Qiao Xiu Zhi never liked the politeness of pushing around. So she shoved the things into her hands and stated, \"Take it. I'm going back.\"After she finished speaking, she turned around and blended into the night. She left so carefree.Liu Cui Hua was holding the bamboo basket in her hand. Her eyes were a little hot....Da Qiao came back from school that day. She took the textbook she had copied for two days, a few raw sweet potatoes, and eggs to the pigsty.Halfway there, she saw Huo Chi walking ahead with pig dung. She immediately shouted, \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, wait for me!\"It was fine that she didn't shout. Now that she shouted, she noticed Huo Chi in front of him paused slightly before slightly accelerated his pace and walked forward.Da Qiao thought he didn't hear her and ran after him: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, don't walk so fast. Wait for me!\"If it was another person, they might not be able to keep up with Huo Chi's footsteps. But Da Qiao was different. She was like the wind!Within a few minutes, she caught up with Huo Chi.Huo Chi frowned and didn't look at her.Da Qiao saw that he was ignoring her. A little confused, she asked softly, \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, why won't you talk to me?\"Huo Chi's ears moved slightly, but he still didn't speak.Da Qiao pouted and was a little sad: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, you don't want to play with me anymore?\"Huo Chi kept telling himself in his heart: Ignore her! Don't talk to her!When Shen Family came to pick her up that day, he could see it from a distance outside the crowd.She was surrounded by everyone like a heiress. Everyone looked at her with admiration. It was heard that she was recognized as a goddaughter by the deputy chief of the town police station.At that moment, he looked down at the pig dung shovel in his hand. He realized that there was a world of difference between them.What qualifications did a wicked one like him have to be her friend?He couldn't give her any benefit at all. He would only implicate her. So after that day, he unilaterally decided not to contact her.After she came back, he also avoided her.But now, when she asked him in such a soft and aggrieved voice, he found that he couldn't harden his heart at all!\"Brother Huo Chi, did I do something wrong to make you ignore me?\"Da Qiao became more and more aggrieved. She lowered her head and poked her little fingers together.Huo Chi finally stopped and turned around, \"You didn't do anything wrong. It was me who did wrong, Sorry!\"Da Qiao tilted her head and looked at him with perplex with her big clear eyes: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, what did you do wrong?\"Huo Chi felt guilty for a while. He turned his head and coughed, \"It's nothing. By the way, I have already folded the hen you want. I will give it to you later!\"Da Qiao wasn't a person who get to the bottom for the truth. Seeing that he didn't say anything, she didn't ask. Just nodded with a smile: \"Thank you Elder Brother Huo Chi. These are the sweet potatoes and eggs I brought from home. Take them back and cook them secretly.\"After finishing speaking, she glanced around and whispered: \"I have copied the book too. Remember to hide it. Don't let others find it!\"Huo Chi stared at the pile of things she handed over and didn't say anything for a long time.\"Take it.\" Seeing that he didn't move, Da Qiao hurriedly urged.It would be bad if she was seen by others. She was especially worried that she would be seen by Eldest Aunt.Eldest Aunt's mouth was too powerful. If she knew that she was using the family's food to help wicked ones, she would definitely holler so loud that everyone knew!Huo Chi stuffed the book into his clothes. Then he looked at her and spoke, \"You keep the other things. I'll take you somewhere in a while!\"\"Where?\"\"You'll know in a while.\"Huo Chi said that as he put the big rattan basket of pig dung to the grass on the side. Then he grasped Da Qiao's hand and turned into a path.Huo Chi led her through twist and turns. Specifically drilled into the bushes.When the two stopped, Da Qiao found them standing in front of a small waterfall.She blinked and exclaimed in shock, \"Isn't this...\"Wasn't this the place where she released the little fish?Huo Chi looked at her in surprise and said proudly: \"En, this is West Wood. Only I have discovered this path so far!\"Da Qiao looked at him with admiration: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, you are amazing!\"Huo Chi turned to look at the waterfall and said, \"This isn't much?\"But the curve of the corners of his mouth betrayed him long ago.Da Qiao had turned to look at the waterfall too. She wondered how the little fish was now. If there will be a chance to see it again in the future?Huo Chi spoke: \"Let's bake sweet potatoes and eggs and eat them. I'm going to pick up some dead branches now. Would you like to go with me?\"Da Qiao nodded like a little chick pecking rice: \"Okay, I'll go with you.\"The two went to West Wood to pick up some dead branches together. Then a fire was made. They threw the sweet potatoes and eggs into the fire. Soon the fragrance wafted out.\"It's so fragrant!\" Da Qiao smacked her small mouth and swallowed her saliva.Huo Chi took in her gluttonous cat appearance and couldn't help laughing: \"Why are you gluttonous? Shouldn't you be full at home?\"Da Qiao blushed when he laughed at her. Still, she argued softly for herself: \"I'm not gluttonous. It's because they smell too good!\"\"Hahaha...\" Huo Chi couldn't help laughing more and more when he heard her explanation.\"If you keep laughing at me, I will ignore you!\"Da Qiao snorted twice and turned around with a ruffled appearance.\"Okay, okay, I was wrong. I shouldn't be laughing at you. You're not gluttonous. It's all the food's fault!\"Seeing her like this, Huo Chi felt itchy in his heart. He wanted to reach out and tug at her hair. But he held back after some consideration.Da Qiao wasn't really angry either. Seeing him coax her, she went went along with down slope.The roasted sweet potatoes were so fragrant!The charred fragrance was completely different from the steamed one. It had a different flavor.When Da Qiao came over, she didn't feel hungry. Once she finished eating, she realized that she had eaten two whole sweet potatoes!Looking at the sweet potato skins on the ground, she blushed embarrassedly: \"I'm sorry, Elder Brother Huo Chi. These sweet potatoes were originally given to you to eat, but now I eat them!\"Huo Chi didn't mind at all: \"Food is for eating. Let's go back. It's getting late, your family will be looking for you later.\"Da Qiao nodded.When they got out of the wood, they suddenly saw a lot of people heading toward Wang's house.Someone sighed while running: \"Oh, old Madam Wang normally looked healthy. So how can she pass just like that?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Old Madam Wang was gone?What did this mean?Da Qiao frowned. She rushed into the crowd and headed to Wang's house with everyone.Wang Family's old grandma was a small old lady who liked to scold children. But she never scold her. One time, she shoved her a coarse meal mantou to her with a fierce face.Huo Chi, who was left behind: \"...\"He looked down at the two sweet potatoes and eggs in his hand. In the end, he didn't follow.Before arriving at Wang's house, a loud cry could be heard from a distance. It made people feel oppressed inside.\"Mom ah! Why did you leave like this... you didn't leave a word...WAAAA...\"\"Grandmother... Grandmother, wake up. I will obediently listen to you and eat obediently from now on. Quickly wake up...\"\"Mom, is Grandmother asleep? But it's not dark yet. Why did she go to bed so early?\"When Wang Family's daughter-in-laws heard the child's innocent question, they cried even more sorrowfully.When the villagers heard Wang Family cry so miserably, they couldn't help but sigh.\"Old Madam Wang isn't sixty years old yet. With how strong her body is, why did she suddenly...\"\"Ain't that right? Old Madam Wang walks like she's flying. I said before, looking at her like that, it is no problem for her to live to ninety-nine!\"\"What a pity!\"Although the villagers often argued red over a chicken and an onion, no one would speak sarcastically at such times.When Da Qiao heard this, she already understood that old Madam Wang was dead.Although she didn't quite understand what death really was, she felt uncomfortable when she heard the constant cries ringing in her ears.Taking advantage of the small crowd, she squeezed into the crowd and saw Wang Family's large and small kneeling at the door.In front of them, old Madam Wang was lying on a straw mat with her eyes closed.Large funerals weren't allowed in this era. Still, the villagers retain some old customs.Here, if an elder in the family dies outside, the person will be transported back and then the family will kneel at the door and cry in mourning. It was said that if the person who died in this way hears the cry and can return home safely without getting lost.Da Qiao had never seen such a battle formation before. Her eyes widened.Fang Xiao Juan knelt behind Wang Family. Her expression blank.Wang Xin Sheng dead?What was going on?In the previous life, he lived well and became the first ten-thousand-yuan household in the village. The first person in the village to buy a car!Why was he dead now?And old Madam Wang too. She was also dead!Two people died in a row. It strongly impacted Fang Xiao Juan's self-confidence.She was originally very confident. With her foresight of the future, she would definitely be able to make herself live a life of a superior person!When the time come, she will make all those who look down on her regret it and come over and beg her!She had everything planned out. If she can capture Wang Xin Sheng's heart, it would be the best. After all, Wang Xin Sheng was top-notch in business.Even if she knew what the future will hold, she had never dipped into business. Like completely clueless about business.If Wang Xin Sheng couldn't treat her wholeheartedly, it wouldn't be a big problem.She had money, beauty, and foreknowledge of the future. She can find a capable man any time.But fate hit her hard at this time!Wang Xin Sheng was dead. Old Madam Wang was also dead. Wang Family must regard her as a mortal enemy!There were still five years until 1978. How will she spend these five years?More importantly, she felt that the 800 yuan that Wang Xin Sheng had promised her would most likely go down the drain!Thinking of this, Fang Xiao Juan felt pained and anxious in her heart.Due to kneeling in one position for too long and because she was beaten yesterday, she felt a pain in her neck.She twisted her neck around. This was when she saw someone in the crowd and suddenly freeze!Standing in the crowd, the little girl was as white as tofu. Her big eyes were clear and bright. Her red mouth was tightly pursed. She was wearing a clean and beautiful dress. She was beautiful among a group of gray, thin, and dark villagers. Like an outlier!It was impossible to not notice her!For a moment, Fang Xiao Juan didn't recognize that she was Da Qiao!Although Da Qiao in the previous life was better-looking than the average person, she was just a slightly good-looking rural girl.Especially since she was fifty years old when she died. She had already forgotten what Da Qiao looked like when she was a child.When her mind wrapped around, a deep shock flashed in her eyes.Although she didn't quite remember what Da Qiao looked like when she was a child in her last life, she can say with certainty that Da Qiao was definitely not like this in her previous life!Her skin wasn't this fair. Nor was her facial features were this delicate. In short, not this pretty!What was exactly going on?In the last life, because Xiao Qiao was a fool and she and Qiao Zhen Jun couldn't have other children, so she could only love Da Qiao.But now, when she looked at Da Qiao in front of her, instead of feeling closeness, she felt extremely strange!Da Qiao was looking at old Madam Wang when she suddenly felt that someone was gazing at her. She looked away and then met her mom's eye.She was startled.Her mom's eyes were round, as if she didn't know her.But why did her mom look at her with such strange eyes?Although they hadn't seen each other for more than two months and she had grown a lot taller, she was still the same. So she can't fail to recognize her.And usually when her mom saw her, she will immediately show a look of disgust and hatred. As if she was a piece of trash.Da Qiao didn't see these things in her face and eyes at this time.She was inexplicably scared. When her mom waved at her, she suddenly turned around and ran out of the crowd!Fang Xiao Juan gritted her teeth with hatred!Waste!So what if she became beautiful, she was still as timid and fearful as she was in her previous life!Da Qiao ran for a long distance in one breath before stopping.\"Da Qiao, why are you running so fast? Did someone bully you?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi came back from picking vegetables at their private plot and saw Da Qiao running as if being chased by a ghost. She thought someone was bullying her and rushed over here.When Da Qiao looked back and saw that it was her grandmother, the corner of her mouth hooked up and replied with a sweet smile: \"Grandmother, no one is bullying me!\"\"No one is chasing you, so why are you running so fast? Did you just come back from Wang's house?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi came over and wiped the sweat from her forehead with her sleeve.Although she didn't exert much force, Da Qiao's skin was so tender that after rubbing it a few times, her skin instantly turned red.Da Qiao felt that her grandmother have an incredible foresight. Her head pecked like little chicks: \"En, I saw a lot of people go to the Wang's house just now, so I follow over there. Grandmother, will Wang Family's grandma wake up?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi felt that it was cruel to tell a child about death. Still, she shook her head truthfully: \"When a person dies, they will never wake up!\"Da Qiao looked at her grandmother. Her eyes suddenly turned red. She rushed over and hugged her grandmother's thighs and said, \"Grandmother, you must remember to wake up after you go to sleep in the future. If I don't see you, I will be very sad!\"In the past six months, she had gotten along with her grandmother and her grandfather the most. In her heart, their status had already surpassed her dad!So she couldn't imagine that if one day her grandmother fell asleep and never wake up again. She would definitely cry until her eyes were swollen!Qiao Xiu Zhi rubbed her hair with her free hand, \"Silly child.\"No matter how hard she tried, she would definitely walk ahead of her.However, she can live a little longer. Once she gets married and has a child, she will leave after other ties are formed. This way, the child will not be so sad.\"Grandmother, I saw my mom just now. She's so strange.\" Da Qiao buried herself in her grandmother's embrace and mumbled.\"Did she say anything to you?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi paused for a moment. Only then, she realize that 'mom' didn't refer to the stepmother, Lin Hui, but the biological mom, Fang Xiao Juan.Da Qiao shook her head. The small bun on her head shook with her movements: \"She didn't say anything. She just looked at me with that strange gaze and then she waved at me. I felt scared and ran away!\"In fact, she couldn't explain why she was suddenly afraid of her mom.Even when she scolded and beat her before, she still wanted to get close to her mom when she saw her.Even if she realized later that she wasn't good to her and no longer expected her love, she was never afraid of her.But this time, she subconsciously didn't want to get close to her!Qiao Xiu Zhi frowned and said solemnly, \"Since you're afraid of her, walk around when you see her in the future!\"Before, she had planned to take Da Qiao to visit Fang Xiao Juan after she was discharged from the hospital. But now it seems that it was unnecessary.Two people in Wang Family died in a row. Although she didn't know the specific reason, it should be connected to Fang Xiao Juan.If that was the case, Wang Family would definitely not tolerate Fang Xiao Juan and Xiao Qiao.Although Fang Xiao Juan was Da Qiao's mom, she was divorced with old Second. So there was nothing to be afraid of.What she cared more about was Xiao Qiao.Xiao Qiao was old Second's biological daughter. If she insisted on going back to Qiao's house, she can't stop her.At that time, Qiao Family won't be in peace again!Those two mothers and daughters were really a calamity. Wherever they go, there will be trouble!When Da Qiao heard her grandmother's words, she processed it and nodded, \"Okay, I'll walk around her in the future!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi came back to her senses and spoke, \"Let's go. Didn't you say you want to learn how to make purses with your grandfather? Why don't you stay at the old house for dinner in the evening?\"\"Okay. I'll help Grandmother later!\"When Da Qiao heard food-related, she immediately forgot her fear. Her eyes curve with a smile....Wan Chun Ju came back from work and knew that Da Qiao was going to stay at the old house again. She sent daggered gaze at her a few times while everyone wasn't paying attention!Qiao Bootlicker!Every day, she came to the old house to freeload. Old Second and Lin Hui must have been taught to her!Qiao Dong Ying noticed her mom's small movements. She rolled her eyes and commented, \"Mom, your whole body smells like pig dung. Still not go wash up now. It stinks to death!\"Qiao Zhen Guo came in. When he heard this, he seemed to have found a bosom friend: \"You hear that, wife. I said last night that you smelled like a pig and you don't believe it. Now you should believe it?\"Wan Chun Ju was so angry that her face turned red and white: \"...Qiao Zhen Guo, shut up!\"Qiao Zhen Guo didn't stop there. He continued to babble: \"Wife, why do you like to work in the pigsty? You look like a fat pig. Now you're smelling like a pig. I'm really worried that you might really turn into a pig!\"Wan Chun Ju almost spat out a mouthful of old blood: \"...\"This damn man, since you can't talk, shut up, alright?Every day, he talked nonsense. If he didn't ruffle her feather, he won't take a break, right?Qiao Dong Ying saw her mom's facial features became hideous. She grinned and ran away quietly.An Ping scratched his head first, then his face. Staring at the workbook on the table, his face almost wrinkled into a little old man.Seeing Da Qiao coming over, his eyes lit up. He immediately beckoned her, \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, come here!\"Da Qiao was about to go into the kitchen to help her grandmother. Hearing her elder cousin brother's call, she trotted over and said, \"Elder Cousin Brother, did you call me?\"An Ping pushed the homework in front of her and replied, \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, do you think you can do this homework?\"Although Da Qiao was only started the second grade, she had already completed the self-study textbooks for the second grade. Recently, she started to study the textbooks for the third grade. So it wasn't too out of line for An Ping to ask her.She leaned over to take a look. Nodding her head, she responded, \"I know how to do it. This homework isn't difficult at all.\"An Ping's mouth twitched: \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, since you don't think it's difficult, why don't you help me do it?\"Da Qiao's face became serious. She solemnly stated, \"Elder Cousin Brother, how can you have such an idea? This is cheating. I'm going to tell Grandmother!\"An Ping was so frightened that his calves trembled. He quickly grabbed her and said, \"Don't go, Elder Cousin Brother is joking with you!\"Da Qiao turned her head and looked at him with her dark apricot eyes. She asked with suspicion, \"Really?\"An Ping nodded his head, \"Really. I've already promised that I will get forty points in the next exam. So how can I cheat! But I know these questions, but they don't know me. It really makes people distress!\"Looking at her elder cousin brother's sighing and lamenting appearance, she covered her mouth and laughed.An Ping had a good temperament. He wasn't mad that he was laughed at. Looking at Da Qiao, his eyes suddenly lit up and suggested, \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, why don't you be my little teacher and give me supplementary lessons?\"He didn't study seriously before, so he didn't know a lot of basic knowledge. Now it took a lot of effort to study seriously.Although his eldest sister's grades were good, she was about to take the primary school graduation exam soon. He didn't dare to disturb her.As for his second elder sister, he thought their own weight. What's more, his second elder sister was too violent. If he couldn't understand it once, her fist might appear.So after much deliberation, only Younger Sister Da Qiao was the most suitable!Not only did Younger Sister Da Qiao have good grades, but also has a soft and sweet personality. Even if he didn't understand, she will not reprimand him with force!Da Qiao had been teaching her two younger brothers at home recently. She was very experienced as well as addicted to being a teacher.She thought about it for a moment before nodding quickly: \"Alright then. I must warn you in advance, Elder Cousin Brother. You can't be lazy, otherwise I won't be polite to you!\"Due to her soft voice, An Ping didn't take her so-called \"won't be polite\" to heart at all.Still, he replied: \"Don't worry, I will definitely listen to the lesson carefully!\"So Da Qiao ran to let her grandmother know. After that, she came back to teach her elder cousin brother.An Ping had heard from his second elder sister before that Younger Sister Da Qiao was very strong, but he didn't believe it at all at the time.How could delicate and soft Younger Sister Da Qiao be strong?But now he believed it!He really didn't expect Younger Sister Da Qiao to be so powerful. He never thought Younger Sister Da Qiao really meant it when she said she won't be polite!The reason for this was when his mind began to wander while listening to the lecture. Da Qiao reminded him twice and on the third time, she directly took action!Da Qiao patted the back of his hand. The back of An Ping's hand instantly turned red.An Ping: Young Sister Da Qiao is so scary!Da Qiao had a fair and tender face, while her voice was soft and smooth: \"Elder Cousin Brother, you have to pay attention. If you do this again, I will really not hold back!\"An Ping: \"...\"Just now was holding back?What was not holding back like?He suddenly regretted it a little. If he had known that Younger Sister Da Qiao was so strict and strong, he might as well have asked his second elder sister to be his teacher!\"Da Qiao, you damn girl. How can you beat your elder cousin brother?\"Wan Chun Ju came out of the bath room and saw the scene of Da Qiao hitting An Ping. She instantly screamed like a squawking chicken!An Ping saw his mom rushing over. His head became big: \"Mom, don't scold Da Qiao. She is giving me a supplementary lesson. I didn't pay attention to the lecture, so she hit me!\"Wan Chun Ju was stunned when she heard these words: \"What did you say? You said that Da Qiao giving you supplementary lesson? You are in the third grade and she is only in the second grade. And she has only gone to school for less than three months. What kind of supplementary classes can she give you?\"An Ping scratched his ears and said, \"Why can't Younger Sister Da Qiao give me supplementary lesson? She can get double 100 points in the exam by self-study. Now, she has started self-study for the third-grade course. While I bring back to duck egg every time. She's more than enough to teach me!\"Da Qiao was younger than An Ping, but she was An Ping's little teacher. In Wan Chun Ju's eyes, this was very unbelievable and very humiliating.But she was reluctant to scold An Ping. With no choice, she spoke: \"Then Da Qiao shouldn't take action against you...\"Before she could finish speaking, she heard her mother-in-law's voice coming from the kitchen: \"Eldest's wife, since you are so idle, come in and make a fire!\"Ever since Wan Chun Ju's belly got bigger, Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't let her work in the kitchen, for fear that she might bump into something.When Wan Chun Ju heard her mother-in-law's voice, she shivered. She was angry and scared.She glared at Da Qiao before turning and slowly heading toward the kitchen.Seeing his mom leave, An Ping breathed a sigh of relief: \"Every time my mom speaks, I feel a lot of flies flying in my ears. Buzz buzz... It's so noisy!\"After he finished speaking, he stuck his tongue out, rolled his eyes, and collapse on the table. Appearing as if he was really disturbed to death.Da Qiao found her elder cousin brother so comical that she couldn't help laughing. She turned her head and suddenly noticed little Wan'er under the big tree with her head tilted as she looked at them.Seeing her glance over, she immediately lowered her head and continued to stare at the ants on the ground.Da Qiao's eyes spun. She walked over and said, \"Little Wan'er, would you like to come over and learn from Elder Sister? How about Elder Sister teach you how to count?\"Actually, she still didn't know what's wrong with little Wan'er.She was just quieter than the average child and didn't like to talk. This didn't seem to be a problem.However, everyone said she was strange. So she had to give her some jade bead water to drink every second day, but it didn't seem to work.Little Wan'er stared at the ground and didn't move.Da Qiao sighed in her heart. She was about to stand up and turn around to leave when she saw little Wan'er stand up and reach out and grab her sleeve.Da Qiao was stunned for a moment. Looking down at her caught sleeve, her heart moved, \"Little Wan'er, you want to learn from Elder Sister, right?\"Little Wan'er's expression was wooden. Still, no response from her. She just stared back at her with a pair of dark eyes.Da Qiao grasped her little hand. Seeing that she didn't resist, she led her to the stone table.Then she spoke softly to her: \"Little Wan'er, sit here for a while. Elder Sister will finish explaining these questions to Elder Cousin Brother. Then I will teach you how to count, okay?\"Little Wan'er still didn't speak. Just sat down on the stone bench.An Ping was amazed when he witnessed this: \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, you are so amazing. It's the first time I've seen little Wan'er pay attention to others!\"Da Qiao straighten her small face: \"Elder Cousin Brother, sit down quickly and do this problem!\"An Ping: Why did Younger Sister Da Qiao have two faces?Although Wan Chun Ju moved forward at a turtle speed, it was only a short distance to the kitchen. It was useless for her to dawdle.As soon as she walked in, Qiao Xiu Zhi stated in a cold voice, \"Old Fifth's wife, go to clean the chicken coop. Let your eldest sister-in-law handle the fire!\"Chen Qiao Qiao glanced at Wan Chun Ju. She stood up, turned around and walked out.Wan Chun Ju rolled her eyes at her back.Since Qiao Zhen Min went to the county, she had always looked lifeless.Really. With out her man, she can't live?Wan Chun Ju felt that the reason why Chen Qiao Qiao was like this was because she didn't have a son.If she had a son, there was no need to worry about other women shaking her position.So in conclusion, Chen Qiao Qiao wasn't as lucky as her!As she thought this, she kept throwing the firewood in. Too much dry firewood was thrown in. The fire was too strong. The water in the pot was quickly evaporated.Qiao Xiu Zhi scolded: \"Eldest's wife, is this the first time you've burn fire? How am I to cook with so much wood thrown in?\"Wan Chun Ju came back to her senses. She shrank her neck. Seeing the fire in the stove was about to spill out, she subconsciously reached out to take out the thickest piece of dry wood.Although the dry wood didn't burn red, the temperature wasn't low.When she grabbed it with her bare hands, she was immediately scalded to the point of screaming, \"Ouch! Oh, bloody hot! My hand hurts!\"She turned her hand over to examine. My god, blister appeared at once!Qiao Xiu Zhi was stunned by her daring action: \"How can it not hurt? The dry wood is burning in the stove and you grab it with your bare hands? Do you think you're a copper wall or an iron wall?\"It was so painful that tears spilled from Wan Chun Ju's eyes: \"Mom, I think my life is so miserable... it hurts to death!\"The blisters on her face from Asian tiger mosquitoes hadn't completely disappeared. Nor had the mouth sores on her mouth healed. Now her hands were scalded with burn blisters.Was there anyone in the world who suffer more than her?Stupid people blame life is miserable and blame the society!Qiao Xiu Zhi rolled her eyes and said, \"I don't need you here. Hurry up and get some paste medicine to smear it!\"Wan Chun Ju came out of the kitchen with tears in her eyes. After thinking about it, she felt that she was harmed by Da Qiao!Every time she met Da Qiao, she would encounter bad luck soon!Qiao Dong Ying heard the movement and ran out. Seeing her mom's scalded wound and remarked, \"Mom, when my dad come back and sees your wound, he will definitely laugh at you being scalded into a roast pig. Do you believe it?\"Wan Chun Ju was pissed off, \"Scrammm...!\"Qiao Dong Ying made a face and went to help her grandmother with the fire.Da Qiao learned to embroider purses with her grandfather all evening.Because she didn't have to go to class the next day, she stayed in the old home and slept with her two cousin sisters....Funerals were all done in a simple way.Two people in Wang Family died in a row. And the two funerals were settled within three days.After the funeral was settled, they decided to deal with the woman, Fang Xiao Juan!In Wang Family's hall, the door was closed.On the right side of the room sat Wang Family's member. All were wearing white clothes and white trousers. Their faces were gloomy. At first glance, they were very scary!Fang Xiao Juan sat opposite them alone Her heart was beating a drum.When people were young, they were more likely to be arrogant. Not afraid of the heaven and the earth. If it was the Fang Xiao Juan in her twenties, she may not be afraid.But inside this body was fifty-year-old Fang Xiao Juan. She was beaten by Wang Shui Sheng in the hospital that day. Just thinking about it made her shiver.Wang Family's expressions were the same. They all fixate their red eyes at Fang Xiao Juan, wishing they could tear her to pieces!But they knew very well in their hearts that if Fang Xiao Juan was really killed, Fang Family would definitely not let them go.Once they get found out at that time, they will be shot. It wasn't worth sacrificing one more life for such a garbage!The vein on Wang Shui Sheng's forehead was bulging. He held back his anger and stated, \"Fang Xiao Juan, you should be lucky that you are still sitting here alive!\"Honest person was more terrifying than the wicked person when they became fierce. Fang Xiao Juan shivered.Still, she firmed her neck and responded, \"Eldest Brother, it's too unfair to say that? It's not like I want something to happen to my man. If you hadn't forced him to join the army, he wouldn't commit suicide by throwing himself into the river. If he didn't die, would Mom have a stroke?\"So in the end, this matter had nothing to do with her!What's more, she was a victim!They made her a widow. They ruined her plans!SLAPLiu Cui Hua rushed over and swung a slap on her face: \"B*tch, I've never seen a contemptible woman!\"Fang Xiao Juan screamed: \"Liu Cui Hua, you dare to hit me!? Take this... Ahh...\"\"Take this, eh? You take this!\"Liu Cui Hua exploded. She grabbed Fang Xiao Juan's hair and dragged her to the ground!The other two daughters-in-law took this in. They looked at each other and rushed up immediately.The three sister-in-laws worked together to beat Fang Xiao Juan!\"Ahhh, my goddess! Murder... ouch... woo woo...\"Fang Xiao Juan wanted to scream, but her mouth was soon blocked by old Fourth Wang's wife's shoes!Old Fourth Wang's wife had sweaty feet. Even when she washed her feet every day, her shoes were still full of salted fish smell.Fang Xiao Juan's eyes turned white from the smell. Her whole stomach was rolling with disgust!Wang Family's men sat and watched. No one went up to dissuade them.Half a day later, a portion of Fang Xiao Juan's hair was ripped off. Except for a slap print on her face, there were no other wounds visible. However, the places on her body covered by clothes were wounds!These b*tches!So vicious!They purposely hit her on the body!These places were injured, but she can't show it to others!\"Alright, if you have the ability, kill me now. Or I will report you to the community tomorrow!\"Fang Xiao Juan glared at them with hatred.Wang Shui Sheng snorted: \"Go. You can go now. I wonder what you want to report us for? I've been the team leader for so long and didn't know that a conflict between sister-in-laws can be reported!\"Fang Xiao Juan froze.As long as no life was endangered, the community won't get involved in fights between sisters-in-law, even if it reach the point of head spilling blood.If Wang Shui Sheng beat her, she could say she's been domestically abused. But when a few women fought, who would care?What's more, Wang Xin Sheng had domestically abused her, cheated on her with a female educated youth, and killed her child. Originally, these were good reasons. But now Wang Xin Sheng was dead!With his death, there was no proof!Except for Ye Zhen Zhen, no one knew what happened that day!Even if she really went to report it, Ye Zhen Zhen will definitely not tell the truth. At that time, Ye Zhen Zhen could straightened the story with Wang Family and agreed on making her, Fang Xiao Juan to take the fall. What could she do with them?Even if the community believed her words, they would at most direct the attack on Ye Zhen Zhen. Wang Family wouldn't be affected much.Because Wang Xin Sheng was dead!When a person dies, it was like a lamp going out. Once he's dead, the evidence was gone and the public opinion in the village favored Wang Family.Seeing her like this, Wang Shui Sheng felt a burst of joy in his heart: \"Fang Xiao Juan, you killed two of our Wang Family's lives. The previous matter is written off! Also, from today onwards, you are no longer a member of our Wang Family!\"Fang Xiao Juan came back to her senses: \"You want to drive me away? I won't leave! My household registration is under your Wang Family's. As long as I don't want to move out, you have no right to drive me away!\"Wang Shui Sheng wished he could kill this woman with one punch: \"I'll give you one hundred yuan to move the household registration out. From now on, you will have nothing to do with our Wang Family. If you don't want to, fine then. Don't think about taking any of Wang Family's items!\"Fang Xiao Juan grounded her teeth with hatred!She could oppose them and not budge on the household registration. However, she couldn't do anything if Wang Family didn't give her anything.Besides, only Wang Xin Sheng and old Third Wang were promising out of the entire clan.Wang Xin Sheng was already dead. As for Old Third Wang, forget about having the opportunity to get in contact with each other. Even if there is, she doesn't dare to approach him half a step!She had seen old Third Wang a few times in her last life. When he looked over at her, she was so frightened that her legs went weak!How can she possibly dare to provoke a man who had seen blood on the battlefield!So if she continue to fight against Wang Family, old Third Wang will definitely not let her go once he come back!Thinking of this, Fang Xiao Juan trembled: \"I can move out. But the house I live in must be given to me. On top of that, you must give me five hundred yuan!\"Wang Shui Sheng laughed!The rest of Wang Family laughed too!\"You want to move, then move. If you don't move, then off to one side!\" Wang Shui Sheng stood up and was ready to leave.They were so disgusted of Fang Xiao Juan. They couldn't even tolerate her name appearing on their Wang Family's household registration.They want to get rid of her. But that didn't mean Fang Xiao Juan can use this to threaten them!Their Wang Family had already been threatened twice. If they were threatened a third time, then their Wang family can die!Fang Xiao Juan was even more flustered when she saw that they were leaving one by two: \"Two hundred. Give me two hundred and I will change my household registration tomorrow!\"Wang Shui Sheng stopped, turned around and looked down at her, \"Two hundred can be given to you, but you have to free up the house!\"Fang Xiao Juan gritted her teeth: \"That can't do. If I free up the house, where will I live?\"She didn't want to go back to her maternal home at all.Fang Family was full of blood-sucking bugs. Once she go back, she will be leeched by them all!Wang Shui Sheng pondered and stated, \"Our Wang Family has an old house at the end of the village. You can use that house.\"Because his parents love Fifth Younger Brother the most, they gave fifth branch the best during the family separation.Now that Wang Xin Sheng was dead, it can't be given to Fang Xiao Juan.Fang Xiao Juan was so mad that she wanted to snapped something: \"Two hundred and fifty. Give me two hundred and five, and I'll move out!\"She really didn't want to move. But she was afraid that old Third Wang would kill her when he come back.She was besieged on all sides now!Wang Shui Sheng glanced at the others. Everyone nodded with gritted teeth.Although they didn't want to give this poisonous woman a penny, they didn't want to be a family with her more!This woman tossed around too much!If she didn't leave, maybe their Wang Family will be implicated later when something happen!Wang Shui Sheng spoke: \"Two hundred and fifty? Okay, I'll give it to you tomorrow. After taking the money, you get out of our Wang Family immediately!\"After Wang Family left, Fang Xiao Juan was sitting on the ground alone. Suddenly, she felt that she was\u00a0two hundred and fifty....The next day, Fang Xiao Juan was pressured to move her household registration early in the morning.As soon as the household registration was sorted, Wang family forced her to move. Simply pissing her off!There was someone even more infuriated than her. Xiao Qiao!Xiao Qiao didn't know why her mom agreed to such a stupid condition!It was enough that she swapped such a good house for a shabby thatched hut at the end of the village. Also, demanding two hundred and fifty. She was really 250!Originally, she wanted to get her mom divorced to marry Wang Xin Sheng. They were heading for a wide road. But it turned out to be a dead end!They didn't get the benefits and even offended Wang Family. Now they have to be kicked out!Xiao Qiao regretted it even more!If she had known her dad would be fine, she wouldn't have left Qiao's house with her mom!Fang Xiao Juan was moving. No one from her neighbors came to help.Xing Hua wanted to help her. But as she was about to open her mouth to say it, she was chased and beaten by her mother-in-law with a rolling pin!Fang Xiao Juan had to ask Xiao Qiao to go to Fang's house and ask her mom to come and help.When Xiao Qiao walked halfway with a dark face, she saw Da Qiao walking toward her.Da Qiao was wearing the dress her godmother bought her last time. On her head was two braids. Two flowers with bows were tied under the braids.The key point was that she became prettier!Her little face was fair and flawless. Her eyelashes were enviable. Her lips red and her teeth white. Prettier than any child actress she had ever seen in her previous life!Xiao Qiao was burning with jealous.But she didn't dare to trouble Da Qiao now. One, she was afraid of the luck system. Second, she had new ideas.The moment she saw Da Qiao, she suddenly decided that she was going back to Qiao's house!What if her grandmother doesn't welcome her?She was Qiao Zhenjun's biological daughter. He was obliged to support her!It was just that she didn't want to go back with such forceful way. So the first step she considered was to please Da Qiao.Thinking of this, she squeezed out a smile that she thought to be sweet and greeted: \"Elder Sister...\"Da Qiao was thinking about something just now, so she didn't noticed Xiao Qiao.At this moment, when she heard Xiao Qiao's call, she raised her head, \"It's you, Younger Sister. Aiya, I remembered that I still have something to do. Goodbye Younger Sister!\"After she finished speaking, she didn't give Xiao Qiao any chance to react. She turned around and ran away!Xiao Qiao took a mouthful of dust: \"...\"Ahhh. How vexing!Da Qiao must have done it on purpose!...As soon as Wang Xin Sheng died, Wang Family forced their daughter-in-law to move out of Wang Family. No one in the village felt that Wang Family was doing something wrong.\"Wang Family is so unlucky. Two people died in one go!\"\"That's right. You didn't see how listless and dispirited old Mister Wang since the death of his wife. He seems to be ten years older. It's really uncomfortable to watch!\"\"Of course, people say young couple are old companions. After so many years of up and down, one is suddenly gone. If it was me, I can't stand it either!\"\"Don't you find Fang Xiao Juan cursed? During the time in Qiao Family, old Second Qiao became was paralyzed and Da Qiao was a stutterer. Qiao Family's pear tree hadn't bloomed for seven or eight years! After she left, Qiao Family immediately prospered! Then she went to Wang Family. Wang Family lost two people!\"\"I didn't notice it before. Now that you said it, it seems like that! In the past, she kept saying Da Qiao is a calamity. Isn't Qiao Family doing well now? She had become the deputy chief's goddaughter. If she is a calamity, how can she have the luck to save the deputy chief's son?\"\"Ain't that right? From what I see, Fang Xiao Juan is the one born with curse!\"\"Tsk tsk tsk. People say tigers don't eat their own cub. Fang Xiao Juan is a vicious woman. She is the star of calamity, but she pushed it on her own daughter. To have such a mother, Da Qiao suffered eight lifetimes of bad luck!\"Soon, rumors had it that Fang Xiao Juan was the disaster star.When Fang Xiao Juan heard these rumors, she almost vomited blood in the thatched hut!This life simply can't pass!If she knew this earlier, she wouldn't have divorced Qiao Zhen Jun in the first place!If Qiao Xiu Zhi could hear her thoughts, she would definitely laugh out loud.She and Xiao Qiao were worthy of being mother and daughter. Their mind were on the same wave!...Night fell. The sky was dotted with stars.There was a knock on the door of a bungalow in the county town. Three light and one heavy.After a while, a man's muffled voice came out: \"Elder Brother Ping, is that you?\"\"It's me. Open the door. I brought you food!\"Hearing this voice, the man inside opened the door and let the person in.When closing the door, he deliberately glanced outside cautiously.Cai Zheng Ping handed over the meal box. The man with the beard accepted it, opened the lid, and immediately devoured it.Cai Zheng Ping lit a cigarette for himself. Looking at him, he spoke, \"Your family has taken your corpse back. The time to go to Xiangjiang has been finalized. You will set off in the early morning of the day after tomorrow. Go get ready!\"The man was stunned. Part of the meal in his mouth fell back into the meal box.

The weather was getting hotter day by day.On this day, Da Qiao led her two younger brothers to the yard with the seeds that Grandpa Shen gave her.\"Elder Sister Da Qiao, little Yi Ming will help you dig soil soil!\" Little Yi Ming squinted his eyes and smiled cutely.The neighboring Gu Family's grandson was learning to speak recently. Every time Da Qiao see him babbling in his baby voice and repeating words, her face was punched red by the cuteness.Little Yi Ming happened to bump into her praising that toddler once. Since then he has repeated words in his speech.Little Dong Lin showed his two toothy front teeth and smiled with curved eyebrows: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, little Dong Lin will also help you dig soil soil soil!\"Little Dong Lin felt little Yi Ming way of speaking a bit cute. But unfortunately he was a step ahead of him. In order to grab Elder Sister Da Qiao's attention, he decided to speak repeat the word three times!Hmph, there was one more word than little Yi Ming. He should be more cute, right?Da Qiao was startled and uttered, \"Younger Brother Dong Lin, why are you stuttering?\"Little Dong Lin: \"...\"Little Yi Ming, who was beside him, covered his small mouth and laughed secretly. With this smile, his small eyes were almost invisible.Da Qiao was afraid of hurting younger brother, so her voice became softer: \"Elder Sister used to stutter when speaking. In the future, you should slow down your speech so that you won't repeat the same word many times.\"Little Dong Lin poked his little finger and responded, \"Little Yi Ming talks like that. Elder Sister Da Qiao...why don't you say he is stuttering?\"Da Qiao was stunned for a moment. Then it came to her. It turned out that his speech was another performance of competing for favor!She almost burst out laughing. Still, she explained it clearly to her two younger brothers: \"You two have grown up. You're already big boys. You can no longer talk like little Gou'er from next door.\"Just as she was explaining, Pi Pi started barking and rushed towards the door.Song Jin Lai's wife was probing her head at the gate of the courtyard. Frightened by Pi Pi, she took two steps back.Her foot stumbled on the big rocks behind her and she lost her balance. Her butt ended up sitting on the pile of poo behind her!She was instantly vexed: \"Oh, my clothes are new. I haven't worn them a few times yet!\"Da Qiao was indeed a calamity. She had only arrived here and was already unlucky!Pah!Recently, everyone said that she is a lucky star. What lucky star!Da Qiao heard the movement and ran out. Seeing the auntie from Song Family frightened by Pi Pi, she pursed her lips. She didn't apologize though.Pi Pi was getting bigger and bigger. Almost catching up with a newborn calf!Everyone in the production team knew Pi Pi was fierce, so they didn't dare to come close. Song Jin Lai's wife must have done something sneaky just now. That's why, Pi Pi would bark at her.Song Jin Lai's wife glared at Da Qiao and reprimanded, \"Da Qiao, you lazy girl. If you had clean up the chicken poo, how can I fall? I don't care, you have to compensate me with a new clothes!\"Da Qiao blinked her watery apricot eyes and replied, \"Auntie Song, my grandmother said when I meet someone like you, I must gift three words.\"When Song Jin Lai's wife heard her mention Qiao Xiu Zhi, her aura instantly weakened by half: \"Which three words?\"Da Qiao's voice was crisp: \"Dream too beautifully!\"Song Jin Lai's wife: \"...\"\"Pfft...\"Qiao Hong Xia ran out when she heard the scolding. Hearing Da Qiao's words, she couldn't help laughing.Da Qiao was a gentle and soft-natured child. Even if she was treated harshly by her mom in the past, she never told anyone. She was once worried that she would become a steamed bun once she grew up.Now it seems that her worries were unnecessary. With her mom present, she will never be turned into a meat bun!She walked out and looked at Song Jin Lai's wife with a sullen face, \"The chicken poo is in front of our Qiao's house. We can sweep it up if we want. What's it got to do with you?\"Song Jin Lai's wife was pissed!Suddenly, her eyes spun. She amusedly spoke, \"Hong Xia, why do you still have the heart to stay at home? Your man is going to marry a wife tomorrow! Don't you know that?\"Zhao Jie Fang was going to remarry?Qiao Hong Xia was stunned. Her face paled instantly.The last time she and Eldest Brother went to Zhao Family to change their household registration, Zhao Family didn't stop her. It was more like they were afraid of her not divorcing. She found it strange at the time.It was just that things happened one after another in Qiao Family. Then her second brother got married again. So she didn't have the heart to guess why Zhao Family were like that.Now she finally knew. It turned out that she wasn't the only one eager to get a divorce. The entire Zhao Family were too!Zhao Jie Fang's hands and feet were really fast. They had separated for less than a month at that time and he found a new spouse!Then why did he come to Qiao's house every day to guard her and acted like he reflected before? It was really disgusting!Song Jin Lai's wife took in her face's change. She became more and more proud: \"It can't be that you don't know? I heard that your man, oh, look at my mouth. He's not your man now. I should say your ex-husband!\"\"The woman your ex-husband is marrying is a widow. Although she is a little older, she is rich! I heard that Zhao Family welcomes her very much! I say, Hong Xia, don't be too sad...\"\"Go away!\" Qiao Hong Xia came back to her senses and angrily yelled.Song Jin Lai's wife immediately flushed with anger: \"Oh, it's really a dog who bites Lu Dong Bin and doesn't know a good person! I kindly came to tell you and this is your attitude?\"Without saying a word, Qiao Hong Xia picked up the broom beside her and swung at her hard!Song Jin Lai's wife was so scared that her face turned pale. She turned her butt and ran as if a wolf was chasing her.Once she ran a good distance away and saw that Qiao Hong Xia hadn't caught up, she stopped to pant.Pah!A broken shoe! What was there to be proud of!Don't want her to speak of it? Well, she'll sing it to the point that everyone in the production team know!Qiao Hong Xia walked back with the broom. Her expression was very ugly.When little Yi Ming met with mishap, she was filled with hatred. But as little Yi Ming got better, her anger toward Zhao Jie Fang subsided a lot.She and her son lived at Second Brother's side. Although her second brother wouldn't despise her, she had no sense of belonging in her heart.In addition, little Yi Ming's brain was gradually getting better. He asked her a few times why he didn't have a dad. She didn't know how to answer him every time.Therefore, a thought gradually came to her mind. Thinking that if Zhao Jie Fang could fight against his family for her and pulled himself out of his family completely, she could consider giving him another chance.Who would have thought, after all thar wait, the news that he was going to remarry arrived!She felt her former thought of getting back together with him was laughable!So ridiculous. Her nose had the urge to sniff, while the throat felt choked and uncomfortable.\"Third Aunt, are you okay?\" Da Qiao came over and held her hand tenderly.Qiao Hong Xia's voice was slightly choked: \"Don't worry, Da Qiao, Third Aunt is fine.\"Da Qiao tilted her head and pondered. She took out a candy from her pocket and handed it over, \"Third Aunt eat candy. Once you eat candy when you're not happy, your mood will get better soon!\"She felt candy was the most wonderful thing in the world. So sweet. No matter how bad the mood was, eating one can make one happy all day!Qiao Hong Xia looked at white rabbit candy in her hand. Her heart melted. She reached out and rubbed her hair: \"Thank you. Third Aunt instantly feel better!\"Just a dog man. What was there to be sad about?With Zhao Jie Fang's character, forget about fight against his family. Even if he did fight, Zhao Family will still disgust people like cockroaches as long as they exist!Seeing that she had comforted Third Aunt, Da Qiao felt that she was great!...After Song Jin Lai's wife's publicity, many people in the production team knew that Qiao Hong Xia's man was going to remarry.Some nosy women even came to Qiao's house to \"comfort\" her. But they were all driven away by Qiao Hong Xia's broom!Qiao Xiu Zhi also caught a wind of it. After dinner, she came to Qiao's small house. She checked on Qiao Hong Xia, \"Are you all right?\"\"Mom, don't worry, I'm fine! Zhao Jie Fang and I have already divorced. Whoever he want to marry is his freedom!\"After handling the nosy women, Qiao Hong Xia couldn't feel depressed even if she wanted to.Seeing that her face didn't look like she was lying, Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded, \"It's good that you can think that. Zhao Family is a dung pit. Since you have already jumped out of it, there is no need to jump back!\"Qiao Hong Xia: \"...\"It can't be that in her mom's eyes, she was a person soaked in dung pit?Qiao Xiu Zhi said: \"Properly live here. You don't need to have any psychological burden. After a year or two, Da Qiao and the others have grown up. Mom and your dad will pay for you to buy a living land in the production team to build your own house.\"\"Mom!\"Hearing her mom's words, Qiao Hong Xia's eyes became hot. She almost burst into tears.Not to mention the entire production team, even in the entire community, who would be willing to pay to build a house for their divorced daughter?Many women endure humiliation. No matter how severe the domestic violence was, they dared not divorce because they were afraid of losing face. More importantly because there was no one behind them to support them!How fortunate she was to be born as their daughter!Fourth Younger Sister always complained that her parents treated her badly. In fact, she was seeking trouble to no end. As long as she had a little conscience, Mom wouldn't be so disappointed in her.Speak of the devil.The next day, Qiao Hong Mei brought her eldest daughter and second daughter out of the blue. sHE appeared at Qiao's old home like a door god.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't have any good attitude at the sight of her: \"Why are you here again?\"Qiao Hong Mei was so angry that she almost vomited blood. But the strange thing was that this time she managed to hold back her temper.She took a deep breath and said, \"Mom, I know that I didn't do well before. I made you and Dad angry. I'm here to apologize to you this time, so please forgive me this once!\"Her mom kicked her out of Qiao's house twice. If she could, she would rather never step in this door for the rest of her life!But her man forced her to come over. Saying, if she didn't repair her relationship with Qiao family, he would divorce her!Qiao Xiu Zhi eyed at her suspiciously: \"Your dad and I have nothing to be angry about. Don't come back to make trouble and it'll be consider as you being filial to us!\"Furious, Qiao Hong Mei's entire face turned black: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at her and said, \"Come in.\"Since the family of three arrived at the door, she couldn't drive them back.When Qiao Hong Mei heard this, she breathed a sigh of relief.She send her two daughters a glance and whispered, \"Sweetened up your lips, understand?\"Chen Lai Di showed her that mouth that was missing her front teeth and ingratiatingly smiled : \"Mom, don't worry, I will definitely make Grandma happy!\"She used to looked down on her maternal grandma's family who lived in the countryside. But the last two times she saw Da Qiao dressed so beautifully and Grandma treated her so well, she couldn't help but feel a little envious.If she could make Grandma like her, wouldn't she also be able to wear new clothes?Chen Zhao Di had always had a clumsy mouth. Seeing her mom staring at her, she became even more nervous: \"Mom, I, I understand.\"Qiao Hong Mei scolded her an idiot in a hush voice before turning away.Chen Zhao Di had a sad expression on her face. If only she could please her mom like the second sister.Qiao Xiu Zhi poured a bowl of water for each of them: \"All sit down.\"Then she took out a handful of candy from the room for the two children.Seeing the candy, the eyes of the mother and daughters lit up.At the beginning, when her man said her mom know a noble person, she didn't believe it. Now she believed it!If she didn't get to know a noble person, how could she possibly take out white rabbit candies to entertain the guests?When Chen Lai Di saw the candy, she became more determined to please Grandma.She imitated Da Qiao. Swinging her short legs, she ran up, hugged her grandma's thigh, and spoke, \"Grandma, little Cutie likes to eat milk candy!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi: \"...\"Qiao Hong Mei: \"...\"Chen Zhao Di looked at her with admiration: Second Younger Sister is so amazing. To be able to smoothly bootlick. She can't do it.Qiao Xiu Zhi only felt uncomfortable. She opened the child's hand and stated, \"Take the candy over there and eat it.\"Chen Lai Ddi thought she had succeeded in imitating. So she continued, \"Grandma is so nice. Little Cutie super like Grandma!\"\"Pfft...\"There was a laugh from outside the door. Wan Chun Ju walked in hands supporting her big belly and said, \"Little Cutie? Out of everyone, you choose to copy Da Qiao!\"No matter how thick-skinned Chen Lai Di was, she was nothing but a seven-year-old girl. When she was laughed at like this, her face instantly turned red: \"I didn't copy Da Qiao!\"Wan Chun Ju sat down on the kang and curled her lips, \"In this Qiao Family, only Da Qiao would call herself little Cutie. If you didn't copy her, who are you copying? Eldest Maternal Aunt kindly advises you. You don't look as pretty as Da Qiao. Nor is your skin as fair as her. Your voice is not as good as her. So don't learn from her!\"Although Wan Chun Ju didn't like Da Qiao and thought she was a flatterer, she had to admit that Da Qiao was good-looking. She wasn't as good-looking as her son though. But compared to Qiao Hong Mei's children, she was like a fairy!Chen Lai Di became angry from embarrassment. Flatting her mouth, she complained: \"Grandma, look at Eldest Maternal Aunt!\"Wan Chun Ju knew that her mother-in-law didn't like Qiao Hong Mei's family, so she wasn't afraid of them complaining: \"I'm saying this for your own good. There is a phrase for it. That is, an ugly person, who wants to imitate a big beauty, gets laughed at. You're like that ugly person now. Hearing what you just said now made goosebumps appear all over my body!\"Chen Lai Di couldn't hold it any longer and cried out with a \"WAA\".Qiao Dong Ying walked in and directed at her mom: \"Mom, that idiom is called '\u00a0Dong Shi imitating frowns', Dong Shi is the ugly one!\"Qiao Dong Ying didn't like that her mom always wanting to bully Da Qiao. However, if her mom want to bully Chen Family, she was very happy to assist!Wan Chun Ju uttered an 'Oh' and said to Qiao Hong Mei, \"Hong Mei, why don't you change your second daughter's name to Dong Shi?\"Qiao Hong Mei went red and white in fury: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, don't you ashamed from bullying children like this?\"Wan Chun Ju took a sip of water and replied, \"How am I bullying her? I'm really kind. How about you wait for Da Qiao to come over in a while and let your daughter stand next to Da Qiao to compare? See if\u00a0Dong Shi laughs at the poor!\"Qiao Hong Mei almost exploded: \"Mom, are you just going to watch Eldest Sister-in-law bully us mother and daughter like this?\"Only then did Qiao Xiu Zhi open the mouth, \"Eldest's wife, gone check if the old hen has laid eggs? If it did, all the eggs are for you today.\"Wan Chun Ju immediately had a wide-eyed smile: \"Oh, thank you Mom. I'll go take a look!\"Her mom really didn't like Qiao Hong Mei's family!She deliberately laughed at them mother and daughters just now to please her mother-in-law. It seem that she made the right move!She will do this in the future. Each time Qiao Hong Mei come, she will target her every time!Wan Chun Ju gave Qiao Hong Mei a proud look and walked out with her big belly.Qiao Hong Mei was so pissed that she almost vomited blood. She didn't dare to offend her mom now. So she scolded her daughter, \"Don't you feel ashamed enough? Still not shutting up!\"Chen Lai Di shivered. The loud sob turned into a soft cry.She hated Da Qiao in her heart!If it wasn't for her, how could she be laughed at by Eldest Maternal Aunt. Nor would her mom scold her!Da Qiao, who was at Qiao's small house, sneezed out of the blue. She rubbed her nose and remarked, \"It must be Grandfather and Grandmother missing me. Mom, I will go to old house and take a look!\"Lin Hui responded in the room: \"Okay, walk carefully. Don't fall!\"\"Got it!\"She arrived at Qiao's old house.As soon as Da Qiao went in, she saw Chen Lai Di, whose eyes and nose were red from crying. She halted for a moment: \"Why are you here?\"It was enemies on narrow road!Seeing Da Qiao, Chen Lai Di glared at her fiercely and stated, \"This is my grandma's house, why can't I come?\"Da Qiao was startled by her reaction: \"I didn't say you couldn't come?\"She just asked why they came.Chen Lai Di continued to fire: \"You clearly said that! Liar!\"Da Qiao felt that there was something wrong with her. She went pass her as she didn't want to entangle with her.Chen Lai Di stared at Da Qiao's back. Her eyes were red from jealousy.Why did Da Qiao's skin turn fairer again? She seemed to be getting taller!She used to be short and skinny. Half a head shorter than her. Now she was half a head taller!So infuriating!Before Da Qiao could walk into the main room, Chen Zhao Di pulled her into the corner.\"Da Qiao, are you still blaming me for asking you for clothes last time?\" Chen Zhao Di asked nervously as she gripped the corner of her clothes.Da Qiao froze for a moment. Then she shook her head and replied, \"Elder Cousin Sister, I didn't blame you.\"The tone of Elder Cousin Sister's speech was really weird last time. However, she still remembered how the other party had helped her before. So she wouldn't hate Elder Cousin Sister because of it.Chen Zhao Di breathed a sigh of relief: \"That's good. you know that I was also forced without a choice. Last time I was beaten by my mom because you didn't want to give me clothes. On top of that, I was also punished to not eat for a day!\"As she spoke, her eyes turned red immediately. Tears fell like it didn't need money.Da Qiao felt that her words made her feel uncomfortable. But seeing her crying so pitifully, it wasn't easy to tell her off.She took out two white rabbit candies from her pocket and handed them over, \"Elder Cousin Sister, don't cry, I'll give you candies!\"While crying, Chen Zhao Di accepted the candies and choked out: \"Only two? Don't you have any more?\"Da Qiao shook her head: \"No more!\"Chen Zhao Di sighed and responded, \"Forget it then. Oh right, didn't you say you wanted to give me a dime last time? Give it to me now!\"Da Qiao:\"\u2026\u2026\"Seeing that she didn't move, Chen Zhao Di urged, \"You didn't bring it? Then I'll go home with you and get it. If you have more, give it all to me. You know I'm very pitiful. If only I could bring some money back, my mom will definitely treat me better!\"Da Qiao felt that her cousin's attitude really made her very uncomfortable!She pulled back her little hand and said, \"Elder Cousin Sister, my pocket money has other uses. I can't give it to you!\"She didn't lie either. Her grandmother's birthday was in a month. She wanted to save more pocket money and go to town to buy a gift for her grandmother.Chen Zhao Di's eyes turned red again: \"Da Qiao, I beg you! Please help me! My mom doesn't like me more and more these days. I really have no other way!\"Da Qiao shook her head firmly: \"Elder Cousin Sister, I can't give it to you. If your mom treats you badly, you can tell your dad!\"Before her dad was paralyzed, her mom didn't dare to scold her in front of her dad even when she didn't like her. That's because her dad would protect her and even quarrel with her mom for her.It was only later that her dad became paralyzed and couldn't stand up, her mom went over the line. So in her opinion, Chen Zhao Di should ask her dad for help.Chen Zhao Di sobbed: \"But my dad doesn't like me either. Neither does my grandmother. They don't like me at all. I'm really pitiful. Da Qiao, please help me!\"Da Qiao:\"\u2026\u2026\"She felt that her elder cousin sister was pitiful, but there was nothing she could do.Chen Zhao Di watched Da Qiao's departing back and cried like her dad died.Chen Lai Di came over and mocked, \"Elder Sister, didn't you say you have a good relationship with Da Qiao? Didn't you say she would help you? Well? Embarrassing, no?\"Chen Zhao Di's tears trialed down as she sobbed out: \"I, I'm that pitiful. Now even Da Qiao doesn't like me!\"In the main room.Qiao Hong Mei finally spoke of her purpose of coming to Qiao's old house this time: \"Mom, I heard that you know the police station's deputy chief. Is this really the case?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at her and sneered in her heart: \"That's right.\"Like she said, what was her motive for suddenly coming to Qiao's house. It turned out that she smelled the honey and sticked to it!Qiao Hong Mei's heart was pounding. Despite her disbelief, she spoke with jealousy: \"Mom, how did you get to know them? I had heard that the deputy chief accepted Da Qiao as his goddaughter. This isn't true, right?\"There was no expression on Qiao Xiu Zhi's face: \"Since you have already inquired clearly, why do you still ask?\"Qiao Hong Mei hated her to death. But this time, she really didn't dare to mess up the relationship with her mom.She took another deep breath and continued, \"Mom, you misunderstood. I didn't inquire around. Just ten days ago, Lai Di said in town that she saw you and Da Qiao get into a car. I thought she saw it wrong. However, her dad said he saw you. Just now someone from our production team entered the town, so I raise it up. However, Mom, why didn't you say something about such wonderful matter?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at her as if she was mentally retarded: \"Why should I let someone tell you what our Qiao Family does? Do we have to report to you?\"Qiao Hong Mei took another deep breath: \"Mom, don't always distort my thoughts. I just feel overjoyed that family can meet such a powerful person. If I had known, I would have come back sooner!\"Come back sooner to bask in the light.Qiao Xiu Zhi finished it for her in her heart. Her eyes coldly gaze at her.Qiao Hong Mei was a little guilty under her mom's gaze. Thinning her face, she persisted: \"My spouse and I also want to meet powerful people. Mom, next time you go to the deputy chief's house in the town, can you bring us?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi stood up with a swoosh and stated, \"Leave. You're not welcome here!\"\"Mom! I'm your biological daughter. You guys are flying high now. What's wrong with flying with our family? I already know that I was wrong. I had apologize. What else do you want from me?\"Qiao Hong Mei couldn't bear it any longer and jumped up like a cat with its fur stood up.Qiao Xiu Zhi coldly responded: \"Deputy Chief is Deputy Chief. Our Qiao Family is Qiao Family. If you want to achieve something through me, I advise you to kill that thought early. Leave. I don't want to say the same thing a third time!\"Qiao Hong Mei's face turned red and white with anger: \"...\"If it was before, she would definitely yell and berate her mom.But now, when she thought of the deputy chief, she thought of her husband and her mother-in-law. She took the Nth breath as she suppressed her anger.\"Mom, you really misunderstood me. I don't have any purpose. I just... Forget it. Since you don't want to see me today, then I'll leave. I'll come again next time!\"After she finished speaking, she put the white rabbit candies on the table in her pocket and turned away.Qiao Xiuzhi: \"...\"...Qiao Hong Mei's family came and went in a hurry. They left without eating.Just before she left the production team, she saw Fang Xiao Juan walking toward her.Fang Xiao Juan was stunned when she saw Qiao Hong Mei, \"Hong Mei... is that you?\"Can't blame her for not recognizing the other party right away. Qiao Hong Mei had fell into the river and drowned in the second half of her previous life. They hadn't seen each other for more than 20 years.Speaking of which, Qiao Hong Mei was also an unlucky woman. Although she tried her best to marry a man in the town, it was a pity that she died at a young age.Less than half a year after her death, her man married a young girl in the town. The woman later gave birth to two sons for Chen Family. The four daughters she left behind weren't doing well.However, Qiao Xiu Zhi was nosy. In her last life, she brought all four of her daughters home to raise them. And those four daughters were just like their mom, Qiao Hong Mei. They were all white-eyed wolves with no conscience!\"It's you, Fang Xiao Juan! I heard that your man had passed recently? You don't seem very sad?\"Qiao Hong Mei didn't have a good relationship with Qiao family. And her relationship with Qiao Family's daughter-in-law was even worse. She didn't expect Fang Xiao Juan to take the initiative to greet her.But she was in a bad mood now. Her speech was thorny. Who told her to bump into her?Fang Xiao Juan was extremely irked. But at the thought of the other party having less than half a year left, she instantly felt relieved: \"Whether I'm sad or not, what's it got to do with you? While you! From what I see, the point between the eyebrows looked gloomy. You're about to encounter big misfortune!\"Qiao Hong Mei had a stomach stuffed with anger at Qiao's house. Now she heard Fang Xiao Juan cursed herself, how could she hold back?She jumped up and berated: \"Bitch, cursing me? I let you curse me! See how I'll tear your mouth!\"Fang Xiao Juan didn't expect that she would suddenly take action. Her face was scratched. Unbearably painful.She immediately flared up: \"You three-inch ugly woman! I'll show you!\"In her previous life, Fang Xiao Juan had fought thought-out the entire Qili production team. Two days before her death, she had gotten into a tussle with her neighbors.So when it came to fighting, she was a fighter!She jumped up, grabbed Qiao Hong Mei's hair, and dragged her to the ground. The last time she got beaten by Wang Family because it was one against three. No matter how powerful she was, she can't win.And now? Haha, a weak chicken dare to strutt in front of her!Qiao Hong Mei was quickly beaten until screaming!Her two daughters cried out in fright.Especially Chen Zhao Di. She was crying and pleading: \"Second Maternal Aunt, don't hit my mom, please!\"Chen Lai Di was more daring. She picked up the small stone on the side and swung it at Fang Xiao Juan: \"B*tch, let go of my mom. Quickly let go of my mom!\"Fang Xiao Juan flew over and kicked the two children each!Chen Zhao Di was kicked to the point of rolling around on the ground. Her head hit a stone and golden stars flashed before her eyes.Before she fell unconscious, she thought again, how pitiful she was! She clearly didn't scold Second Maternal Aunt. Why did she beat her?After Chen Lai Di was kicked down, she dared not move again.Fang Xiao Juan turned around and scuffled with Qiao Hong Mei who bolted over: \"Ugly woman! You're so ugly, no wonder your man look down on you! Don't you know, your man has another woman outside!\"As for whether Chen Xing cheat or not in his last life, Fang Xiao Juan had no evidence.She felt that there was no man in the world who didn't steal bites. Not to mention that every time Chen Xing saw her in her previous life, he looked at her with lustful eyes.If it was before, Qiao Hong Mei wouldn't believe this. But right now, her man hadn't touched her for three months. Her heart couldn't help but drop.Despite her suspicion, she could never show clues of it in front of outsiders: \"Fang Xiao Juan, you broken shoe, if you dare to talk nonsense again, I will tear your mouth apart!\"\"Whether I'm talking nonsense, you'll find out when you go back and investigate. I can promise you that you'll come back to me!\"Fang Xiao Juan had had enough. She left with a cocky expression on her face.Qiao Hong Mei laid on the ground with a messy chicken coop hair and uncertain face....Da Qiao had been learning how to make purses from her grandfather recently.Purse wasn't hard. The embroidery was though. What was even more difficult was that she had to make many of them!Her grandfather, her grandmother, her dad, her mom, Godmother's family, and her cousins as well as her two younger brothers. Each have to get one!She had it hard.When she came back from school that day, she went to the pigsty to deliver two copies of the test papers to Elder Brother Huo Chi.Since Huo Chi's grandfather was in good health, they told her not to send things over to avoid being seen. So she only sent food occasionally.Huo Chi accepted the test paper she sent over and was very moved.He had benefited too much. A 'thank you' obviously seem insufficient. The family will keep this gratitude in their hearts. If there is a chance in the future, they will definitely return it twice!He hid the test paper on his body. As he lowered his head, a straw-woven hen hanging on her schoolbag caught his eyes. The corner of his mouth curved upwards and said, \"Why did you hang that up?\"Da Qiao followed his gaze and softly replied, \"I really like the straw hen Elder Brother Huo Chi gave me. It look like my family's Gu Gu!\"The corners of Huo Chi's mouth curved upwards a little higher. However, with a didn't-care expression, he spoke, \"That one isn't very good. If you really like it, I'll make up a nice one for you next time.\"Da Qiao smiled with crescent eyes: \"Then I'll thank Elder Brother Huo Chi first!\"Summer was here. The leaves were flourishing green. The bright sunlight cast through the dense foliage. The ground was mottled.Huo Chi eyed at the leaves on the branches and pretended not to care: \"You're welcome. It's just a small thing.\"As soon as his voice fell, the sound of pig screaming came from the pigsty. It sounded panic.Da Qiao said curiously: \"Why is the pig screaming so loudly? Who is inside?\"Huo Chi turned around and glanced in that direction, \"Your eldest aunt alone is there?\"Da Qiao found it even more strange: \"Alone? Did she drive you out again?\"Huo Chi nodded helplessly. With some disdain, he remarked, \"Your eldest aunt is really a troublemaker!\"Since Da Qiao's eldest aunt came, the peaceful days of the pigsty have been disrupted.It was enough that she often bossed them around. Recently, she kicked them out. Don't know what she was doing in there alone!Every time she made a fuss, the fat pigs would be frightened and have a bad appetite. One or two were tormented to the point of diarrhea!If it weren't for Da Qiao's face, they would have gone to the production leader to report her!When Da Qiao heard his comment, she nodded like a pecking chick: \"You're right. My eldest aunt is really capable of causing trouble!\"Before Huo Chi could respond, he heard Wan Chun Ju's voice inside: \"Wicked ones! You three wicked ones, hurry up and come in for me!\"Huo Chi's face immediately sank and he told Da Qiao: \"I have to go in and have a look. Quickly go. Don't let your eldest aunt see you!\"Da Qiao looked at him with sympathy: \"Then I'm leaving. I'll bring you something delicious next time!\"Since Huo Family was being tossed around by Eldest Aunt every day, she wanted to bring some food to make up for them.Huo Chi smiled at her, turned and ran in.As soon as he entered, he saw Wan Chun Ju sitting on a pile of pig dung and was covered in pig dung.Huo Hua Qing and Dai Shu Fang also arrived one after another. Seeing the appearance of Wan Chun Ju, the family of three couldn't help being stunned.What the hell was this woman doing?Was she rolling in circles in a pig dung pit?Otherwise, they really can't figure out how she made herself look like this!Wan Chun Ju was furious!She came to work in the pig ty to find gold bars. But after so many days of searching, there was no clue at all!She had searched almost every corner of the pigsty, except for the pit where pig dung was piled up!After thinking about it for a long time, she decided to search in it. That's why, she drove out the three wicked ones and used a shovel to shovel the pig dung to find gold bars.Unexpected, she slipped and fell directly into the pit. She was almost suffocated by pig dung!\"Why are you still in a daze? Still not coming over and help me up?\" Wan Chun Ju broke out into scolding.Dai Shu Fang was about to go over, but was stopped by Huo Chi: \"Mom, you don't need to help her!\"The pit of pig dung was not deep. If it was, she would have been suffocated to death long ago if she fell in like this. In other words, she could stand up by herself.She instructed her mom like this cause she treated their family of three as servants!Wan Chun Ju gritted her teeth angrily: \"You brat, what are you thinking. Still not coming? I will report you to the production leader and say you're not properly working!\"Huo Chi responded with a dark face: \"If you have the ability, you can go! If you don't go, we will go. I will go to the production leader to report you and tell the leader about your recent strange behavior. I want to see if leader will still stand on your side!\"Wan Chun Ju's eyes widened with anger: \"You brat, if you dare to go, I will beat you to death\"Dai Shu Fang patted Huo Chi's head and said to Wan Chun Ju, \"Chi'er said it in moment of anger. You should get up by yourself. As for reporting us, you'd better not go there, otherwise it will cause trouble. If it stir up, it may not be us who suffer.\u201dShe was very grateful to Qiao Family for helping them, otherwise she wouldn't have endured Wan Chun Ju's fire during this time.She also figured out Wan Chun Ju's character.This was a person who bully the soft and fear the hard. If one act like they were afraid of her, she will only gain an inch and push for a foot.For people like this, you have to make her afraid of you. Of course, because their status wasn't great, so she had to pay heed to the degree of this.Wan Chun Ju was pissed. But she was also afraid that this wicked family would really report her.At that time, everyone might guess the purpose of her coming to the pigsty. This absolutely can't do. Gold bars can only belong to their first branch!Wan Chun Ju gritted her teeth and crawled out of the pig dung pit. Her whole body, including her hair and face, was covered in pig dung. The appearance and smell really made people shy away three times.When Huo Family saw her coming out, they immediately retreated far away.Seeing this, Wan Chun Ju became even more pissed!Like this, she walked out of the pigsty in dung-covered state and slowly headed toward Qiao's house.Da Qiao was afraid that her aunt would be a demon and bully Huo Family. So she didn't go far. Just hid by the road back to Qiao's house.When she saw Eldest Aunt walking over in dung-covered state. She was stunned on the spot!Eldest Aunt really can toss around!However, she went ahead out of respect!Wan Chun Ju looked up and saw Da Qiao. Immediately, she shouted loudly: \"Da Qiao, Da Qiao, come here!\"Instead of coming over, she ran faster and faster and soon disappeared!She wasn't stupid!Eldest Aunt was covered in pig dung. Would there be anything good if she went over?Damn girl! So sly!Wan Chun Ju's face turned black with anger!When Qiao Xiu Zhi saw her returning in dung-covered state, she immediately berated: \"You rolled in pig dung, right? Old Fifth's wife had been in the pigsty for so long, why didn't she come back with any pig dung? How did you toss around to this state?\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi said with a dark face: \"This is the last time. If you dare to come back in this state next time, you don't have to come back!\"Wan Chun Ju looked like a quail and tremblingly nodded: \"Mom, I don't dare.\"On this day, it took her two full hours to somewhat clean herself.But when she went to bed at night, her mind was still on the gold bars.She nudged her man and said, \"Zhen Guo, didn't you say the gold bar was hidden in the pigsty last time? I've been looking for it for so long, why didn't I find it?\"Qiao Zhen Guo yawned, \"It's outside the pigsty!\"Wan Chun Ju was shocked: \"How can such an valuable thing be placed outside the pigsty?\"Qiao Zhen Guo looked at her like she was mentally retarded: \"Any production team could have\u00a0chaste tree, how is it valuable?\"Wan Chun Ju was stunned: \"Which production team has it?\"How can that be?Qiao Zhen Guo responded: \"I will go to the pigsty tomorrow to get some chaste tree back and get old Second help us weave a basket.\"Gold bars?Chaste tree?Wan Chun Ju was struck by lightning!She tossed around for so long because she was tricked by her man?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now he didn't need to sleep beside her. Just what he wanted.Seeing the way her man merrily humming a tune, Wan Chun Ju instantly burn in fury again!Since there were no gold bars in the pigsty, she didn't want to go to work there.The pigsty smelled so bad. And she had to face three wicked ones every day. No a inkling of desire to go!But she asked Mother-in-law for this job again and again. It wasn't even one month and she didn't want to do it. Mother-in-law will definitely drive her out!She had no choice but to bite the bullet and continue to do it. Fortunately, her belly reached seven months old. After a month or so, she can stop going!After the spring ploughing, there was slack period. After the slack period, summer arrived and the weather got hotter.The villagers of the production team were busy again. They can't slack off on weeding, fertilizing the fields, and watering the fields.At this time, there was no electricity in the countryside. Production teams like Qili Village didn't even have tractors, not to mention diesel pumps. All watering was done manually.Carrying water under the big sun every day made everyone exhausted. After a period of working, those who can't stand against the sun were directly tanned to black charcoal.Although the children didn't need to go to the fields to work, they would instantly turned black. They ran all over the mountains and fields as well as walked a long way to the community to attend to school. In winter, their skin was a little fair.Only Da Qiao's skin remained fair, tender and clean. Just like milk, so white that it seemed to glow.Someone couldn't help but sigh: \"Don't know how Da Qiao child grow. Her skin is as white and tender as a peeled egg. Not like a child from our countryside at all!\"\"It's said that the girls changed eighteen times. Da Qiao has become so good-looking at the age of seven. Once she grows up, how will it be?\"\"I think that child has always been good-looking. It just that she used to have a sallow complexion and wasn't well-dressed. When she was compared with her younger sister, Xiao Qiao, she didn't look good.\"\"Now you said it, it seem like this. After Lin Hui entered the door, the child's clothes were different every day. Tsk tsk, not everyone is like Lin Hui!\"Now almost the entire production team knew that Lin Hui loved Da Qiao, her stepdaughter, more than her own son. When it came to food and clothing, she always prioritize Da Qiao first.Whether she was sincere or not, at least her intentions had won the approval of all Qiao Family.Fang Xiao Juan passed by as she carried some vegetables. She happened to hear everyone praising Lin Hui. She gnashed her teeth in hatred!The thatched hut she lived in was dilapidated. It was fine when it didn't rain. But once it rain, don't even think about living in it!Later, she forced Wang Shui Sheng to get someone to repair it for her. Still, she was used to living in a good house. She couldn't stand a hard life anymore!A few days ago, she saw Lin Hui from a distance. Compared with her own sallow skin, Lin Hui's ruddy complexion made people jealous.Back then, she was full of spring breeze. Mirth appeared on her brows and eyes. At first glance, she lived a very comfortable life.Lin Hui's appearance deeply stabbed her in the eye!Why was she living so badly, while she can live so happily?It was like this in the previous life. This life, it was like this again. God was so biased to her!No. She must find a way to get what belongs to her back!...Da Qiao watered the jasmine flowers and bittersweet roses with jade bead water every day. In just one month, the jasmine flowers actually bloom!This speed simply stunned everyone in Qiao Family!From seed to germination and flowering took two or three months. But now it was completed in one month. How could this not be amazing?However, after witnessing the hen laying four or five eggs every day and the pear blossoms blooming in winter, Qiao Family quickly accepted this matter after being surprised. They tacitly did not spread it out.In a blink of an eye, it was Qiao Xiu Zhi's birthday.Da Qiao took out the handkerchief she had embroidered and frowned tightly: \"Elder Sister Dong He, do you think Grandmother will not like this gift?\"In order to prepare the gift of Grandmother, she had been busy for more than a month.Although she had a huge saving of one yuan and three dimes, Grandmother lacked nothing. Last time she followed her godmother to the department store and found nothing meet the eyes.In the end, she decided to embroider a handkerchief for Grandmother. But because the thread that can be bought these days wasn't complete, the effect of embroidery was far from satisfying her.Qiao Dong He was a kind-hearted young lady. Seeing her like this, she immediately comforted her: \"You embroider very well. Grandmother will definitely like it. So don't worry!\"In fact, judging by Grandmother's doting for her, Grandmother won't mind no matter how ugly her embroidery looked.When Da Qiao heard what her elder cousin sister said, she pursed her lips and smiled. Finally, her worries disappeared.In the evening, Qiao Family gathered at Qiao's old house. It was extremely lively.Wan Chun Ju's belly was more than eight months along. No one dared to let her work. So Lin Hui and Chen Qiao Qiao were the only daughters-in-law working in the kitchen.Although Lin Hui was the only daughter in her family, she had been helping at home since she was a child. And after getting married, she had to rely on herself for everything. So her actions weren't clumsy at all. She was quite nimble.Chen Qiao Qiao looked up and glanced at her already pregnant belly. Envy flashed in her eyes.It had been almost three months since her man went to work in the county. He never came back once. Her heart became more and more uneasy each day!She was thinking about it while cutting vegetables. While she was in a trance, the knife in her hand cut her index finger. A piercing pain instantly erupted on her index finger!\"Your fingers are bleeding! Why are you so careless?\"When Lin Hui heard Chen Qiao Qiao's cry, she turned her head to look over and saw that Chen Qiao Qiao had cut her finger!Qiao Zhen Jun, who was walking over with a bundle of dry wood, heard the cry and thought Lin Hui met with mishap. He threw the dry wood in his hand and rushed in: \"Hui Hui, what happend?\"He rushed in and saw Lin Hui standing there in perfectly fine condition, while Fifth Younger Sister-in-law's fingers were bleeding. Only then did he realize that he had misunderstood.Lin Hui saw that he called her nickname in front of other people, her cheeks were flushed. She gave him an reprimanded glaze and uttered, \"You're a grown adult, how can you act rashly?\"Qiao Zhen Jun scratched his ears and embarrassedly replied, \"I thought it was you who had an accident. I was just worried about you.\"\"...\"Chen Qiao Qiao, who had her fingers sliced open, was fed a mouthful of dog food. Her heart felt chilled.She turned around and walked out: \"I'll bandage the wound and come back later.\"Lin Hui took in her dazed state and shouted at her back, \"Since your finger is injured, don't come here. Just leave here to me.\"Chen Qiao Qiao turned around and looked at her: \"Can you handle it alone?\"Qiao Zhen Jun immediately interjected: \"It's alright. I can help with cutting the vegetables and with the fire.\"Because Xue Chuan can cook and Qiao Family didn't have the custom of kitchen being no-go-zone for men, the men in Qiao Family can cook a few dishes. Their cooking skills were very average.Chen Qiao Qiao saw how harmonious and loving this husband and wife looked and her heart became even more chilled: \"Just do whatever you want.\"With that said, she turned and walked away.Qiao Zhen Jun and Lin Hui looked at each other with a helpless expression.It had been more than half a year since Chen Qiao Qiao came back to the old house. She was still distant with Qiao Family's adults. This distant attitude included her own daughter, little Wan'er.In fact, Lin Hui understood that she was unhappy that Qiao Zhen Min went to work in the county. But Qiao Zhen Min had an unruly temper since he was a child. He would definitely not want to stay in the production team and work in the field like his two elder brothers.Now that Qiao Zhen Min had just gone to work there, it wasn't realistic to take Chen Qiao Qiao and the child with him. Still, Qiao Zhen Min wasn't a chaotic person. Once he has the conditions, he will definitely find a way to bring the mother and daughter to his side.So Chen Qiao Qiao should have more confidence in her man.If it was up to her, Chen Qiao Qiao should focus more on little Wan'er. When Qiao Zhen Min come back and see that she took good care of her daughter, he would definitely be grateful to her. Then the two could also take the opportunity to reconcile.Speaking of little Wan'er, Lin Hui sighed in her heart.When little Wan'er just returned, Chen Qiao Qiao had paid attention to her. But as soon as Qiao Zhen Min left, she quickly returned the state of throwing little Wan'er aside. No wonder little Wan'er wasn't close to her, the mom at all!Da Qiao was afraid that her mom would be tired. So soon after Chen Qiao Qiao left, she immediately ran in to help.The laughter of this family can be heard from time to time from the kitchen. The atmosphere was very warm....After the meal was done, it was still very bright outside. Xue Chuan sent his two sons to carry the dining table to the yard.The dishes were put on the table one after another. This included braised pork elbows, spicy tofu, kung pao chicken, steamed sea bass, stir-fried Chinese cabbage, and a pot of tomato and egg soup.The fragrance spread and attracted the worms in everyone's stomach to the point they can't stand it.An Ping sucked his saliva and said, \"Second Aunt, your cooking skills are delicious at first glance. Don't worry, I'll definitely eat a few more mouthfuls later!\"Everyone couldn't help laughing when they heard his ridiculous words.Lin Hui smiled and modestly responded: \"My cooking skills are average. Can't compare to Dad's!\"An Ping scratched his freshly shaved head and spoke, \"My grandfather's cooking skills are divine. No one can match it! But Second Aunt isn't bad. If my grandfather ranks first, Second Aunt will definitely be ranked second!\"No one disliked being praised. Lin Hui smiled brightly: \"Thank you for your praise. I'm embarrassed from the praise!\"\"An Ping, what you said is wrong. Have you forgotten me, your mom?\"Seeing that everyone only praised Lin Hui, Wan Chun Ju was already jealous. Now that she saw that her precious son was praising her, she felt even more uncomfortable!As soon as she voiced these words, both her precious son and her man laughed in unison.An Ping: \"Mom, don't be too confident! Your cooking skills aren't as good as mine!\"Qiao Zhen Guo nodded and said in agreement, \"Wife, with your pig food cooking level, you have the nerve to say it? I feel ashamed for you!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Big butt Wan Chun Ju almost vomited blood!In the past, it was enough for that her man retort her. Now An Ping joined in. This life was unlivable!Qiao Family couldn't help laughing even more when they look at the first branch's retorting father and son!At this moment, Qiao You Rou barked. The next moment, a knock sounded on the door.Wan Chun Ju murmured, \"Who would come at this time?\"\"Mom, Dad, it's me, old Fifth!\" Qiao Zhen Min's voice uttered from outside the door.Everyone was stunned for a moment. Then all became excited.Especially Chen Qiao Qiao. Her eyes lit up as her face glowed with brilliance. As if she came alive in an instant.She rushed past the crowd toward the door. Not caring what others thought of her.Small separation made husband and wife closer than newlyweds. They had been separated for almost three months. Everyone can understand why she was so excited.It was just that she rushed out so recklessly just now. She completely forgot her daughter was standing beside her and bumped hard into little Wan'er. With a wobble, little Wan'er fell to the ground!If it wasn't for Da Qiao's quick hands reaching out to support her, little Wan'er would probably bleed by now!Little Wan'er hugged Da Qiao. Her eyes went red and she wept quietly. She was clearly frightened.Da Qiao hurriedly hugged younger sister and comforted her softly: \"Little Wan'er, don't cry. Elder Sister is here. Don't be afraid!\"Seeing this, Qiao Xiu Zhi's face immediately sank.It was said that experiencing one cut makes one wiser. Obviously Chen Qiao Qiao didn't learn a lesson from the last incident!Chen Qiao Qiao happily opened the door. When she saw her man standing at the door, tears almost fell: \"Zhen Min, you are back!\"Her gaze burned into her man.In her imagination, Qiao Zhen Min should be just like her at this time; looking at her with burning longing eyes and then saying to her 'Thank you for your hard work!'But before Qiao Zhen Min could speak, a voice came from behind him: \"This should be Fifth Younger Sister, right?\"Hearing the unfamiliar man's voice, Chen Qiao Qiao came back to her senses. Only then, she realized that there were three people standing behind her man... Chen Xing, Qiao Hong Mei, and their second daughter, Chen Lai Di.The people in the yard also noticed Qiao Hong Mei's family at this moment. Their faces weren't a pretty sight.The original warm and happy atmosphere disappeared without a trace.\"It turned out that Fourth Elder Sister came back.\" Chen Qiao Qiao spoke stiffly with an awkward expression on her face.Qiao Hong Mei stared at her. The corner of her mouth curled and responded, \"It's not like Fifth Younger Brother is only coming back for one night, Qiao Qiao. Why are you so anxious?\"Chen Qiao Qiao's face turned even redder, like boiled pig blood.Qiao Zhen Min coldly looked back at his fourth elder sister coldly and stated, \"Shut up if you don't know how to speak. Or go back. Our Qiao Family doesn't welcome people like you!\"\"You\u2026\u2026!\"Qiao Hong Mei's face turned red and white with fury.Chen Xing turned his head and glared at her.Qiao Hong Mei gritted her teeth and said unwillingly, \"It's me who don't know how to speak. Fifth Younger Brother and Fifth Younger Sister, don't mind me. You know, I am a direct person. I have no bad intentions!\"Qiao Family: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi coldly stated, \"Why are you still standing at the door? Come in?\"Qiao Hong Mei was like a slug sticking to one's feet. It can't hurt people, but it can make people disgusted!Qiao Xiu Zhi was deeply disappointed with this daughter. In the end, the other party was already married. She won't see her more than a few times a year. As long as she didn't act up, she didn't plan to do anything to her.It was just that she had come back a little too often recently. Especially after knowing that they knew Shen Family. Mostly likely they will come back from time to time in the future. Which was a bit nauseating to think!Chen Xing noticed the atmosphere was very awkward. He walked in with a smile on his face: \"Today is Mother's 50th birthday. I specially requested the half-day leave and came over with Hong Mei, Fortunately, I wasn't late!\"Da Qiao said crisply: \"My grandmother is fifty-three years old this year. Not fifty years old!\"The smile on Chen Xing's face froze. The creases on his face seemed to be solidified.Qiao Hong Mei was very jealous about Da Qiao being accepted as a goddaughter by the deputy chief. Now she lost her man's face in front of everyone, she immediately scolded: \"When the adults speak, is there any room for you children to speak? Motherless child is really uneducated!\"Da Qiao flushed with anger: \"I have a Mom!\"Lin Hui was also furious. She walked over and hugged the child to silently comfort her.Qiao Zhen Jun's expression was very ugly: \"Fourth Younger Sister, putting aside the fact that Da Qiao's biological mother is still alive, I am now married to Lin Hui. She is Da Qiao's mom. What you just said was too much!\"Just as Qiao Xiu Zhi was about to ask Qiao Hong Mei to get out, Chen Xing turned around and slapped Qiao Hong Mei hard!A crisp 'slap' sound rang!Just listening to this sound, one can guess how much strength Chen Xing used just now!Chen Xing glared at her with a stern face: \"You wicked woman, you return a few times in the past and said Qiao Family treated you badly. I don't believe you. How could a good family reject you? Now I understand. It's not that everyone rejects you, but that your mouth is too stupid. You offend people as soon as you speak! You apologize to your second elder brother and second elder sister-in-law now!\"When Qiao Zhen Min heard these words, he raised his head and glanced at Chen Xing.These words were obviously scolding Qiao Hong Mei, but they were actually implying Qiao Family wasn't good to Qiao Hong Mei. The family only rejects her!Moreover, he slapped Qiao Hong Mei first and asked her to apologize to immediately blocked the mouth of Qiao Family.Even his mom couldn't really drive Qiao Hong Mei away at this time.Chen Xing was too slick and sly. Back then, he didn't like him at first sight.It was just that his fourth younger sister insisted on marrying despite the opposition of her family.If she wasn't allowed to marry, she would throw a tantrum. Say everywhere that Qiao Family can't stand see her live well!So right now when she was slapped by Chen Xing, none of Qiao Family came forward to stand up for her.\"Second Elder Brother, Second Elder Sister-in-law, I was wrong. I got a stupid mouth and can't speak. Please forgive me this time. I promise that I will never talk nonsense again!\"Qiao Hong Mei felt angry and aggrieved. But under the vicious gaze of her man, she had to apologize with red eyes.Qiao Zhen Jun had a mild temperament. Though he steeled up just now to protect his wife and daughter, he didn't intend to pursue it further now Qiao Hong Mei apologized.Qiao Xiu Zhi's face was even more ugly. She remained silent with a stern face.Xue Chuan sighed in his heart and uttered, \"Let's all sit down and eat.\"He couldn't figure it out either. With his and his wife's blood, no matter how bad the genes were, they shouldn't have a daughter like Qiao Hong Mei.Since Chen Xing phrased it like this, he can't drive him out at this time. Otherwise it will become them being in the wrong!Wan Chun Ju glared at Qiao Hong Mei's family and muttered, \"Didn't come here earlier or later. Deliberately came at this time to eat and drink for free?\"If their family came here earlier, it would not only show that they were attentive, but they would also be able to help with the chores and cooking.But they happened to be in time for the meal. It was impossible to make people not think astray. It was not the first time that Qiao Hong Mei had done this!Wan Chun Ju thought she was speaking very quiet, but she was born with a loud voice. Even if she was whispering, she was louder than the average person. So the whole yard could hear her words clearly.Chen Xing and Qiao Hong Mei's faces flashed red and white and the steam in their hearts were about to explode!In the end, Chen Xing was thick-skinned enough. He handed over the snacks and a piece of fabric he brought over, \"Mom, Hong Mei and I bought these things to honor you!\"A reach out hand don't hit a smiling man.Qiao Xiu Zhi could only put the things away and spoke, \"Sit down.\"When Chen Xing heard this, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.Everyone found a place to sit down.Qiao Zhen Min looked for his daughter's whereabouts and frowned when he saw her shrinking behind Da Qiao with red eyes.Chen Qiao Qiao also noticed this at this moment. Her heart thumped.Qiao Zhen Min walked over to pick up his daughter.But he hadn't come back for more than two months. Little Wan'er was a little unfamiliar with him, so she didn't want to be picked up by him. She just shrank into Da Qiao's arms.Qiao Zhen Min felt a little sad when he saw that his daughter was unwilling to be close to him: \"Little Wan'er, it's Dad. Don't you remember Dad?\"Little Wan'er stared at him with black eyes, but did not speak.Qiao Zhen Min took out some candy, biscuits, and two sets of small dress from the bag he brought. He urged in a low voice, \"Look, Dad bought you a lot of food. Do you want to eat it?\"Still, little Wan'er didn't move.Qiao Zhen Min sighed in his heart. However, seeing his daughter was at least willing to get close to Da Qiao, he felt a little comfort.Speaking of which, it was thanks to Da Qiao's blessing that little Wan'er could be found. So one of the two dresses he bought was for Da Qiao.He turned his head to look at Da Qiao and said, \"Da Qiao, Fifth Uncle bought you a dress. Thank you for helping Fifth Uncle take care of your sister.\"Seeing that his daughter was so close to Da Qiao, he could guess that his wife didn't take good care of her without asking anyone else.When Chen Qiao Qiao heard her husband's words, she panicked even more.If she knew that her man was coming back today, she would have got along with her daughter more!She couldn't help but regret it.Da Qiao revealed two small dimples and softly replied, \"Fifth Uncle, no need to be polite. Little Wan'er is my younger sister. I should take care of her!\"Seeing how well-behaved and sensible she was, Qiao Zhen Min couldn't help reaching out and rubbing her head: \"Good child!\"If her daughter could be like her, he would have no regret if he closed his eyes at this moment.The dress that Qiao Zhen Min bought was a one-piece dress. The pink skirt had a big hem. On the bottom were pink flowers, while a big bow on the top. It was very beautiful.Da Qiao liked it very much at first glance and thanked him with crescent eyes.Seeing her smiling so happily, little Wan'er blinked. Suddenly she reached out and grabbed the other dress from her dad's hand. Then she stuffed it to Da Qiao.Da Qiao lowered her head and asked her softly, \"Little Wan'er, you want to give the dress to Elder Sister?\"Little Wan'er remained unresponsive. Still, her hand wasn't taken back either.Da Qiao had an big sister aura. She reached out and rubbed her hair, \"Elder Sister already has it. This one is for you. You see it's the same. How about we wear it together tomorrow?\"Shen Family bought the same dresses for her and her two cousin sisters last time. They didn't buy it for little Wan'er because they didn't have her size.Every time she and her two cousin sisters wore the same dress, her eyes would fixated on them.Qiao Zhen Min's eyes were fixed on his daughter. He was so nervous that hands were sweating.Just when everyone thought that little Wan'er would no longer respond, she retracted her outstretched arm and hugged the dress tightly in her arms. The corners of her lips inaudibly moved.Because the action was so inconspicuous, no one noticed except Qiao Zhen Min.Qiao Zhen Min's eyes became hot. A grown man almost shed tears in front of everyone.He went to work in a transportation company this time and had met a lot of people when he as reselling things around. He heard a man from the capital say that one of his relatives had a child who was in the same situation as little Wan'er.It seems that this was called autism. It was very difficult to cure. Like almost no hope. The child may only live in their own world for the rest of their life. They will never be able to live like an ordinary person.After he found out about this, he tossed and turned for days and lost five or six pounds in half a month.For more than two months, he hadn't been home. He just wanted to make more money as he planned to take his daughter to the capital to see a doctor when he had collected enough money.He never imagined that little Wan'er could actually respond to others!His eyes fell on Da Qiao. He finally completely believed what his mom said- this child was a lucky star.As long as one was sincerely kind to her, she can bring blessings to those around her!Chen Lai Di stood beside her mom. Her eyes stared at the dress in Da Qiao's hands. Her eyes burned red with jealousy.It was just that she didn't dare to speak out.Her mom had gotten beaten. If she dared to ruin her dad's affairs, he could kill her once they got back home!...Although the atmosphere was no longer as warm as before, there were no more contradictions and nauseating things.After eating, Qiao Hong Mei took the initiative to help wash the dishes. Qiao Hong Xia wasn't polite and let her do all the dishes.Qiao Hong Mei was furious!She was cursing Qiao Family in her heart while fiercely washing the bowls and basins. Suddenly she let out an \"ouch\".Looking down, she saw that her index finger was cut by a notch on the plate. The blood was flowing non-stop!\"Oh, my god. You can get a cut by washing dish. Hong Mei, you must normally do very little chores, right?\"Wan Chun Ju was sitting not far away eating melons. When she saw her scream, she immediately walked over with her big belly.When Qiao Hong Mei heard her snarky remark, she was so angry that she almost vomited blood: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, don't talk nonsense, okay! Don't you see that a wound was cut open on my finger?\"Wan Chun Ju pouted: \"There has always been a notch there. When others wash dishes, they're fine. While just you get a cut? If you want to be lazy, just say it directly. What's with all these excuses!\"Fury made Qiao Hong Mei's face liked a cooked shrimp: \"...\"Lin Hui didn't come over.At the sight of Qiao Hong Mei being angered to the point of nearly vomiting blood by Wan Chun Ju, Lin Hui suddenly thought of the phrase \"a wicked person will be harassed by another of like ilk\". The corner of her mouth pursed slightly.Chen Xing came out when he heard movement. Seeing Qiao Hong Mei quarreling with her eldest sister-in-law again, he couldn't wait to kick her to the horizon!Qiao Xiu Zhi also came out. She glanced at Qiao Hong Mei's bleeding fingers and stated, \"You don't need to wash the dishes. Go and bandage it. Then all of you go back early. It's getting late.\"Chen Xing gritted his teeth. Anger burned in his heart.For a while, he felt that Qiao Family was like the stones in the dung pit. They don't accept soft and hard method. He smilingly accompanied for a whole night and their attitudes were still neutral.For a while, he felt that all this was Qiao Hong Mei's fault. If she hadn't offended people as soon as she came, Qiao Family would have kept them here for one night out of courtesy.Damn, what a pig teammate!Compared with Qiao Hong Mei, Chen Xing was a man who can bend and stretch.After helping Qiao Hong Mei bandage the wound, he didn't dawdled., After saying goodbye, he left with his wife and daughter.After walking out of Qiao's house, Qiao Hong Mei commented with a dissatisfied face: \"It's getting dark. You shouldn't have followed my mom's words just now!\"Chen Xing turned his head and gave her a cold look: \"Next time you dare to be stupid again, see how I'll sort you out when you come back!\"His eyes were too fierce. It made Qiao Hong Mei think of the black cat's eyes at night.She shivered all over. Her throat felt like a fish bone was stuck. She couldn't utter a word.What Fang Xiao Juan said to her last time suddenly popped up in her mind. Her eyes couldn't help landing on Chen Xing, as if she wanted to wanted to make a hole in him with her gaze.Chen Xing had never been a dutiful man. She knew this better than anyone.Why did she pester to marry Chen Xing back then? It wasn't because she loved him, but because she had already given him her body.If she didn't marry him, who else can she marry?In addition, Chen Xing was the man with the best conditions she had seen. So at that time, she would marry into Chen Family even if she risked her life!It was just that in the past few months, Chen Xing never took the initiative to touch her. Only when she took the initiative to tease him, he would reluctantly do it.She considered all the women around him that he could come into contact with. Finally she thought of someone. She felt that the most likely and most suspicious one was Wang Ni'er, who was also working in a state-run restaurant.She decided to find a chance to test the other party!Chen Xing was thinking about how to get in touch with the deputy chief through Qiao Family. So he didn't notice her gaze for a while....\"Mom, I just saw it clearly now. Hong Mei deliberately cut her finger with the notch. She just wanted to be lazy!\"Seeing that Qiao Hong Mei pissed away by her, Wan Chun Ju was proud.Everyone was speechless when they heard her words.At that time, she was more than two meters away from Qiao Hong Mei. How sharp were her eyes to see it clearly?Wan Chun Ju didn't care what other people think of her. As long as she can please her mother-in-law, she can overcome all obstacles. Whether it was going up the mountain of knives and go down the frying pan...Which were impossible.But she can retort Qiao Hong Mei and make her pissed off. This was her unique skill!Qiao Dong Ying took in her mom's pleased with herself expression. For the first time, she felt that her mom was actually quite \"cute\" sometimes.Qiao Xiu Zhi saw that her eldest daughter-in-law had been staring at herself with bright eyes and an expression saying 'Mom, please praise me quickly'. It seemed that it wasn't good for her not to say anything.She coughed and uttered, \"Hong Mei likes to be lazy and play tricks since she was a child. Next time she comes over, you can keep an eye on her.\"Like a getting a shot of adrenaline, Wan Chun Ju gave her mother-in-law a military salute and loudly declared, \"Yes, Mom! I will follow your instructions and keep an eye on Qiao Hong Mei!\"Everyone: \"...\"Speechless, Qiao Dong Ying turned her head away. She simply can't watch her mom's stupidity.Da Qiao leaned beside her grandfather, covered her mouth and laughed secretly.When everyone was about to take out the prepared gifts, they heard Wan Chun Ju's cry.Qiao Zhen Guo said, \"Wife, what's wrong with you?\"Wan Chun Ju covered her belly. Her face turned pale and replied: \"Zhen Guo, my belly hurts so much... I may be going into labor!\"Going into labor?Everyone was taken aback by her words!Because technology wasn't developed enough these days, everyone can only estimate the time of pregnancy according to a woman's menstrual time.Before Wan Chun Ju was confirmed to be pregnant, she said that she had had a period last month. But the amount was much smaller than usual. So the doctor guessed that she was just became pregnant back then.According to the doctor's guess, she was only eight and a half months pregnant now. However, she was giving birth so soon. It seems that the time was wrong. She should be nine and a half months pregnant now!Qiao Zhen Guo's brain was stunned silly. Still, when he heard what his wife said, he immediately went up to support her.Qiao Xiu Zhi quickly recovered and said calmly, \"Eldest, can you hold your wife?\"Qiao Zhen Guo tried it and found that he couldn't hold her up. His wife's belly was too big and it was dark outside. It won't be easy.He scratched his head and suggested, \"Mom, why don't you hold instead?\"Everyone: \"...\"Wan Chun Ju shivered. At the thought of being held in princess carry by her mother-in-law, her belly hurt even more: \"Zhen Guo, you hold me!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi saw the water was running down her feet and didn't dare to delay. She walked over and picked up Wan Chun Ju: \"Eldest, take the money. Let's go to the clinic!\"Being held by her mother-in-law, Wan Chun Ju was as quiet as a quail. She didn't daring to move at all.Looking at this scene, everyone felt that it wasn't the normal level of eye-stabbing.Soon everyone had no time to think about it, because Wan Chun Ju screamed like a pig getting slaughtered.\"Ouch...it hurts to death! F*ck...it hurts...\"Neighboring Gu Family heard the ruckus here and immediately ran over in curiosity.\"What's going on here? Why is Eldest Qiao's wife screaming like a pig getting killed again? It can't be that she fell down like last time?\"Old woman Gu stared at Qiao Xiu Zhi and her daughter-in-law as she smirked.Wan Chun Ju felt that old woman Gu was cursing her. She immediately yelled: \"You are killing pigs. Your whole family kills pigs! Be careful that you'll fall and drop on your big butt!\"\"You\u2026\u2026!\"When old woman Gu heard this, she was so pissed that her breath almost didn't come up and pass on the spot!Qiao Xiu Zhi couldn't be bothered to pay attention to old woman Gu. She was about to take her eldest daughter-in-law to the clinic when she saw Qiao Zhen Min come over with a flashlight.Gu Family stared at the flashlight in Qiao Zhen Min's hand. Their eyes turned red with envy.Qiao Family was really different. They can have something like a flashlight. The deputy chief must have bought it for them!Wan Chun Ju kept screaming all the way: \"Ouch, why is my belly hurting so much. Mom, I think I'm about to give birth!\"She had given birth to three children. She was very clear about the procedure of giving birth.Although there will be labor pains at the beginning, it was never this painful. In other words, the frequency wasn't that high.But now she was throbbing. She felt like something was about to come out.Qiao Xiu Zhi rolled her eyes and said, \"Of course you are going to give birth. Save your energy and wait until the baby come out!\"Qiao Zhen Guo chased after them and called out, \"Wife, listen to Mom's words. I only brought you two mantou. If you keep calling like that, I guess it won't be enough for you later!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Damn man. Her belly seem to be hurting even more!When they arrived at the clinic, there was only one male doctor.Wan Chun Ju insisted that he can't deliver her baby: \"I, Wan Chun Ju, is innocent. Don't come here to defile me!\"\"...\"The male doctor scanned her swarthy face and huge body and felt offended!He coughed and responded, \"Judging from your state, either you get sent to the town hospital immediately or hire someone who had experience as a midwife before...\"It was just that before he could finish speaking, he was interrupted by Wan Chun Ju's screams.\"Ahhh... I'm about to give birth. The baby is coming out! Zhen Guo, take off my pants!\"Male doctor: \"...\"He walked out of the door and directed to Chen Qiao Qiao, who was standing at the door: \"Go in, I will guide you from outside.\"Chen Qiao Qiao said nervously, \"But I don't know how!\"The male doctor reached out and patted her shoulder and assured, \"Just follow what I taught you last time. You'll be fine. Come on, take a deep breath with me first...\"Chen Qiao Qiao noticed his hand. Her face blushed slightly and turned her body: \"Your hand...\"The male doctor seemed to realize his inappropriate behavior just now and smiled apologetically: \"I'm sorry. I didn't notice it. Don't worry about it!\"Chen Qiao Qiao replied, \"It's okay.\"As soon as she finished speaking, the door creaked and Qiao Zhen Min walked over.Chen Qiao Qiao panicked for no reason.Qiao Zhen Min didn't pay attention to her face: \"Didn't you study nursing for the last three months? Go in quickly. I think Eldest Sister-in-law is about to give birth!\"Chen Qiao Qiao nodded quickly, turned around and ran in as if a ghost was chasing her.Wan Chun Ju said many times that she was going to give birth, but no one believed her at first.After all, giving birth to a child wasn't a hen laying an egg. Iit will come out after a few calls.Half an hour later, when the child was cleaned and held in Qiao Zhen Guo's hands, everyone believed it!\"Zhen Guo, show me our youngest son!\"After giving birth to the baby, Wan Chun Ju's face displayed some exhaustion. Still, she was in high spirits.Qiao Zhen Guo carefully walked over with the baby in his arms and spoke, \"Wife, not the youngest son. It's youngest daughter.\"Wan Chun Ju's face turned pale as she uttered in disbelief, \"Zhen Guo, stop joking with me. It's obviously a son, how could it be a daughter?\"She always felt that she had a son in her belly.She was going to give birth to two golden bumps. In the future, all Qiao Family's assets will be left to her two sons!No one can shake her status in the future!But now her man said she gave birth to a daughter. She absolutely didn't believe it!Qiao Zhen Guo saw she didn't believe him. So he handed his daughter to her and said, \"Then see for yourself!\"Wan Chun Ju opened her daughter's clothes and find there was no little chick. She was struck by lightning!Her youngest son... was gone!Qiao Zhen Gguo ignored his wife's expression and laughed: \"Wife, people say that a woman gives birth to a baby like a hen laying eggs. I didn't believe it before, but I believe it now. You gave birth to a baby faster than a hen laying an egg!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Wan Chun Ju's heart had already suffered a heavy blow. Now she was irked by her man. She felt aggrieved in her heart and cried out with a 'waa'!On Qiao Xiu Zhi's birthday, Qiao Family got a new addition... Qiao Dong Yun.Also that night, a man carrying a suitcase knocked on the door of the Wang's house.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70Wang Shui Sheng and his wife were stunned when they heard the knock on the door.It was so late. Who would knocking at this time?Two people in Wang Family died in a row. Wang Xin sheng didn't die of natural causes. The production team found it unlucky. If they can, they won't come to Wang Family. So for this person to come this late, something must have happened!Wang Shui Sheng got up from the bed and spoke, \"I'll go out and have a look.\"Liu Cui Hua remembered Wang Xin Sheng's death and trembled for no reason. Then she got up and said, \"I'll go with you.\"It was pitch black outside. Unknown night bugs chirped in the cracks of the stones.A gust of night wind blew. A cat meow sounded from out of nowhere and caused Liu Cui Hua's legs to soften on the spot.Could it be Mother-in-law coming back?Or was it the younger brother who committed suicide and can't be reincarnated?The more Liu Cui Hua thought about it, the more frightened she became. She hugged her man's hand tightly with both hands, almost as if she could be dragged away.Wang Shui Sheng felt speechless for a while. He opened the door and looked. His eyes widened. He couldn't utter a word for a long time!The man in the night looked tired. After seeing Wang Shui Sheng, the corner of his mouth twitched: \"Eldest Brother, Eldest Sister-in-law, I hope I didn't disturb your rest?\"Liu Cui Hua took a look through the hazy night and shrieked the next moment: \"Old Third? Why is it you?\"Wang Shui Sheng also came back to his senses. With an excited look on his face: \"Third Younger Brother, why didn't you tell Eldest Brother that you are coming back? I can go pick you up!\"Old Third Wang, that was, Wang Yan Sheng, smiled and answered, \"I'm in my twenties. Why would I need Eldest Brother pick me up?\"Wang Yan Sheng was very busy in the army and hadn't returned home for more than two years.This time, when he came back from the mission, he realized that something big happened at home. He immediately asked his teacher for leave and hurried back in a rush!Seeing that everyone was standing outside, Liu Cui Hua pushed her man and urged, \"What's the point of standing at the door? Still, not letting Third Younger Brother in?\"Wang Shui Sheng repeatedly nodded: \"Third Younger Brother, quickly come in. Child's mom, old Third must be hungry from coming back so late. Go make a bowl of noodles!\"Wang Yan Sheng was in a hurry to go home and didn't even eat dinner. He was starving at the moment: \"Then I'll trouble Eldest Sister-in-law. Since it's so late that you don't have to make noodles. Anything will do!\"Liu Cui Hua smiled and said, \"It's alright. No trouble at all!\"If she was asked to make noodles for the dead Wang Xin Sheng, she would definitely not be unwilling. Old Third was different!Why did Wang Family become the richest family in the entire production team? Why were they able to build seven large tile-roofed houses in one go? It was all thanks to old Third!If he hadn't gone to the army to work hard by himself long ago and sent so much money back every month, Wang Family wouldn't be rich. Her man wouldn't be able to be the production team leader!So she more than willing to make this bowl of noodles!\"Drink some water first. I'll get you some hot water for you to wash your face.\"After entering the main room, Wang Shui Sheng took out a new enamel tank. After cleaning up, he poured a glass of warm water for Wang Yan Sheng.Wang Yan Sheng quickly stood up: \"Eldest Brother, no need. I'll do it myself!\"Wang Shui Sheng waved his hand and went out.Before when Fifth Younger Brother and his mom met with mishap one after another, he called the army but couldn't get in touch with Third Younger Brother. His heart kept feeling unsettled.Now that Third Younger Brother was back, it was like he found the magic cudgel and his heart settled down!After busying away for a moment, the two brothers sat down to talk.Wang Yan Sheng took a sip of water and asked, \"Is everything fine at home?\"Wang Shui Sheng sighed. His dark face looked like he gone through a lot under the candlelight.How can it be fine?Two people died in a row in the family. His dad's health suddenly took a spiral. All day long, he sighed. These days, he was lying in bed and couldn't get out of bed. It seem like he can't get better.Wang Yan Sheng still didn't know the whole story, so he said, \"Eldest Brother, tell me everything.\"Wang Shui Sheng recounted the whole matter.After listening, Wang Yan Sheng raised his eyebrows and said, \"So you kicked out Fang Xiao Juan mother and daughter after the funeral?\"Wang Shui Sheng's heart jumped at Third Younger Brother's uncertain reaction: \"This... I know that we are doing something wrong, but she caused Third Younger Brother and Mom's death. Now even Dad isn't faring well either!\"When it came to treating Fang Xiao Juan, they were indeed bullying the other party.But did they want to do this? They didn't want it at all!When Fang Xiao Juan entered the door in that way, everyone was mad. Still they let her in and never treated her harshly in anything.Later, Fifth Younger Brother committed a crime. He had hooked up with a female educated youth and almost caused a fatal accident. He did want to kill him at that time. At that time, Wang Family had wanted to compensate Fang Xiao Juan. Of course, it was due to not wanting her to report.But everything changed after Fifth Younger Brother committed suicide. Their mom had a stroke on the spot when she saw Fifth Younger Brother's corpse and passed away in less than 12 hours without leaving a word!In that case, how could they let Fang Xiao Juan stay in Wang Family?Moreover, his dad couldn't stand the sight Fang Xiao Juan at all. If Fang Xiao Juan was allowed to stay, maybe Wang Family would have another funeral soon!Wang Yan Sheng heard his eldest brother's defense and laughed mockingly: \"So now, you don't think it's Fifth Younger Brother's fault?\"Under his third younger brother's gaze, Wang Shui Sheng inexplicably felt guilty: \"Fifth Younger Brother was wrong, but he had paid the price for his mistake. He didn't want to drag down our entire Wang Family. He committed suicide so we won't be continued to be threatened by Fang Xiao Juan!\"Wang Yan Sheng couldn't help but laugh.There was a saying in ancient times that people die like a lamp goes out. It seem that once a person dies, the sins they have done in the past are cancelled out. The people around them will suddenly have amnesia and forget all the bad things they did during their lifetime.It seemed ridiculous to him!Was Fang Xiao Juan in the wrong?Of course was!Even before she divorced Qiao Zhen Jun, she hooked up with his fifth younger brother and conceived a baby. From this aspect, the two of them were jackals from the same lair!Still, Fang Xiao Juan can't be blamed for the death of his mom and fifth younger brother. The root cause was his fifth brother's own sin!Besides, him committing suicide for the sake of the family? He didn't believe a word of it!Wang Shui Sheng was even more flustered by his third younger brother's laugh. But before he could speak, Liu Cui Hua walked in with a bowl of noodles.The noodles were made of high gluten flour. An egg laid on top with a sprinkle of green onions. It looked very appetizing.Liu Cui Hua put the old porcelain bowl on the table and merrily spoke: \"Third Younger Brother, come over and eat. Eldest Sister-in-law remember that you like to eat green onions. I sprinkled a lot on. Unfortunately there is no coriander at home, otherwise it will be more fragrant!\"Wang Yan Sheng took in his eldest sister-in-law's sincere smile. Also, when he came back, Eldest Brother busied away for him. He couldn't say anything harsh to him: \"Thank you, Eldest Sister-in-law.\"\"No need to thank. Everyone is one family. Quickly eat!\" Liu Cui Hua ushered. After she finished speaking, she turned around and went out.Wang Yan Sheng was really hungry. He slurped in big mouthfuls.The noodles were firm and elastic. The egg yolk was perfectly orange and fragrant. There was a piece of pork belly hidden underneath. It made him feel the warmth of home even more.In less than ten minutes, a large bowl of noodles was finished by him.He casually wiped his mouth and said, \"Eldest Brother, since Fang Xiao Juan's matter has already been done, so be it. But you must restrain the family so that they can no longer fight against her and Fang Family.\"He didn't understand why Fang Xiao Juan chose to swallow her anger. Still, the dog jumped over the wall, when anxious. Nor were Fang Family easy to handle. If they were forced to the corner, it's unknown which side actually suffer at that time!Wang Shui Sheng was relieved when he saw Third Younger Brother's expression suddenly softened. He nodded again and again: \"I know this. Everyone in the family can't wait to stay away from Fang Family. We will definitely not provoke them!\"In fact, apart from driving Fang Xiao Juan out of Wang Family, Wang Family didn't do anything overboard to her after that.Fang Xiao Juan said that the thatched hut was unlivable. So he led Second Younger Brother and Fourth Younger Brother over to repair it. She said her health was bad due to bad post-natal confinement. So he arranged a very light job for her.It was just that a person like Fang Xiao Juan really can't make people treat her well!Seeing how he was easy to talk the past few times, she immediately demanded him cheat and give her a few more work points!Why did Fifth Younger Brother get entangled with this kind of woman out of everyone in the first place!Although Eldest Brother was a little filial, his heart wasn't bad. So Wang Yan Sheng wasn't worried about Eldest Brother going along with everythingHe stood up with the bowl and said, \"It's getting late. Eldest Brother rest early. We'll talk tomorrow if there's anything to discuss!\"Wang Shui Sheng stood up as well: \"Alright. By the way, how many days is Third Younger Brother going to stay this time?\"Wang Yan Sheng answered, \"I have fifteen days of vacation. I can stay at home for ten days, after excluding the time for the journey.\"A smile appeared on Wang Shui Sheng's face: \"Great. You haven't come back for a few years, so you should stay at home for a few more days. Dad will be delighted to see you tomorrow!\"Since Fang Xiao Juan moved out, the room where Wang Xin Sheng lived before was still empty. No one in Wang Family dared to live there.As for the room assigned to Wang Yan Sheng. Due to not being home all the year round, it was now inhabited by the few nephews. Wang Yan Sheng wasn't afraid of ghosts and spirits. He planned to go to his fifth younger brother's room to sleep.Walking out of the threshold, he suddenly stopped and spoke, \"Eldest Brother, are you sure that the corpse is Fifth Younger Brother?\"Wang Shui Sheng was stunned for a moment before nodded: \"I have identified it. Although the corpse was soaked until swollen, his facial features are a bit like Fifth Younger Brother. The height and the clothes can match. It should be him.\"Mainly, if it wasn't him, whose corpse was it?How could there be someone wearing Fifth Younger Brother's clothes and look exactly like him?He recalled about the fact about the scar on the corpse and added: \"But there is a very long scar on the Fifth Younger Brother's left eyebrow. I don't know why that spot on the corpse happened to be missing a piece of meat.\"Wang Yan Sheng's eyes narrowed: \"You mean that Fifth Younger Brother's body was destroyed and the most obvious feature cannot be use as identification?\"Seeing his third younger brother suddenly being so serious, Wang Shui Sheng couldn't help but get nervous: \"I asked the police. He said that it might have hit a rock by the river, or it might have been bitten by a fish...Is there any problem?\"Wang Yan Sheng's facial features were pencil straight. At this time, he pursed his lips and did not speak.In front of him, Wang Shui Sheng couldn't uphold big brother stance at all.Wang Yan Sheng continued to questioned, \"When was Fifth Younger Brother buried?\"When Wang Shui Sheng heard him ask this, he could sense something wrong no matter how stupid he could be: \"Third Younger Brother, what are you trying to do? You... you couldn't possibly suspect that the corpse isn't Fifth Younger Brother, right?\"Wang Yan Sheng didn't nod. Nor did he deny it either.He did suspect the corpse wasn't Fifth Younger Brother.Not to mention the fact that the corpse happened to be destroyed on the left eyebrow, he didn't believe Fifth Younger Brother would commit suicide for the sake of his family according to his personality!As long as he had a conscience, he won't get his parents and elder brothers to support him at this age. Nor would he do a series of things that can get him executed!So he didn't believe the talk about doing it for family from the beginning!When Wang Shui Sheng saw his third younger brother like this, his heart became more and more uncertain.After a long time, he sighed and uttered, \"I think you think too much. Your second elder brother personally witnessed him jump into the river. Beside, the corpse's facial features are very similar. Even without the scar, you can't say it isn't Fifth Younger Brother. If he isn't Fifth Younger Brother, whose body is it? Where did Fifth Younger Brother go? Why did he pretend to be dead?\"Wang Yan Sheng couldn't answer his eldest brother's words.If he knew, he wouldn't be standing here now!Wang Shui Sheng was afraid that he would do something \"rebellious\" and hurriedly warned: \"Third Younger Brother, Dad's health is very bad. You mustn't come up with any strange ideas.\"For example, digging a grave for an autopsy or something. Don't even think about it!Although the old man was very disappointed with Fifth Younger Brother, that was still his youngest son who he had been doting for so many years. The white-haired man sent the black-haired man. On top of that, his wife also left. He suffered a heavy blow all of a sudden. Now the smoke-addict don't smoke anymore.So if Third Younger Brother really did that, it would take the old man's life!Wang Yan Sheng thought of his dad. He patted his eldest brother on the shoulder and said, \"It's late. Eldest Brother, go to bed.\"After speaking, he strode away.Wang Shui Sheng watched Third Younger Brother's back with unease....Da Qiao woke up early the next morning. After dressing up neatly, she prepared to head to the old house and go with Grandmother to the health clinic to visit her eldest aunt and the newborn baby.After the aunt went to the health clinic last night, their family soon returned to Qiao's small house. So she still didn't know whether Eldest Aunt gave birth to a little sister or a little brother.But as soon as she walked to the door, two sticky buns glued on her.\"Elder Sister Da Qiao, we're going too!\" The two little dumplings said in unison in their baby voice.Da Qiao pondered for a while and responded, \"Okay. You all come with me. But I have to say this beforehand, you have to be good!\"The two little dumplings immediately nodded like pecking chicks: \"We are always good!\"So, Da Qiao went to Qiao's old house with two 'always well behaved' small dumplings.Along the way, everyone saw the three little dumplings holding hands in hands. The three's faces were fair and tender. The clothes on their bodies were clean. So much better than other children in the village. They couldn't help give a few more glances.Others couldn't help but sigh: \"I really don't know how Qiao Family raises children. Each child is more beautiful than the other. I really want to ask them for guidance on raising children!\"Everyone nodded when they heard this.Da Qiao and her two younger brothers arrived at Qiao's old house and saw two elder cousin sisters doing laundry.\"Younger Sister Qiao, why are you here so early?\"When Qiao Dong He saw the three little dumplings holding hands, the adorableness hit her face pink.\"Elder Sister Dong He, we came to see the baby with Grandmother!\" Da Qiao walked over and found her elder cousin sister washing baby clothes.The baby clothes looked so tiny. She found it very novel.Qiao Dong He replied: \"Grandmother is still making the ginger vinegar egg soup. Sit at one side and wait for a while.\"The custom here was to eat ginger vinegar egg soup for a month during post-natal confinement. If the family didn't have this condition, they would drink brown sugar water for two or three days. If their condition was even worse, they didn\u2019t even get to drink brown sugar water!Da Qiao didn't go to sit. Instead, she ran over to help the two elder cousin sisters wash: \"Elder Sister Dong He, have you seen the baby? Is it a younger brother or a younger sister?\"\"It's younger sister.\" This time it was Qiao Dong Ying who spoke. She winked, \"When you go over later, remember to stay away from my mom!\"Since her mom gave birth to her little sister, the expression on her face had been very stinky. The two sisters delivered meal in the morning and got shouted at for no reason.After thinking about it for a while, Da Qiao understood in her heart. Quickly, she softly spoke: \"Elder Sister Ying, don't worry. I will stay away from Eldest Aunt in a while! But these clothes don't look dirty. Why do they need to be washed?\"Qiao Dong He replied: \"The babies' skin are very tender when they are just born. These clothes have been sitting around for a long time. Grandmother told us to rinse it with warm water so that the baby will not be hurt.\"Da Qiao nodded and quickly kept this little knowledge in mind.Her mom's belly reached over four months now. In five months, she will be an elder sister. She must remember these things!Qiao Dong He took in her younger sister's serious expression and she fell in deeper love again.Half an hour later, Da Qiao and her two younger brothers went with Grandmother to the clinic.Sure enough, as soon as they entered the door, they saw Eldest Aunt with a dark face. As if she was owed two hundred and fifty yuan!She whispered to her two younger brothers, \"You guys have to stick to Elder Sister in a bit. Don't get close to Eldest Aunt, understand?\"\"Understood, Elder Sister Da Qiao!\"The two little dumplings copied her and lowered their voices. The three of them gathered together like little mice.Wan Chun Ju saw this. Her expression became even worse: \"You three. Don't you see your younger sister is sleeping? Did you come here on purpose to disturb her?\"These words made people speechless.The voices of the three of them combined weren't as loud as hers alone!Sure enough, little Dong Yun frowned and cried with a \"WAA\"!Wan Chun Ju was even more annoyed: \"Cry, cry, cry. All day long, only know to cry. So annoy...\"But before the words were finished, she swallowed it back when she caught sight of the figure at the door.Qiao Xiu Zhi went out to rinse the dishes and cutlery just now. When she walked to the door, she heard her eldest daughter-in-law scolding.She walked in and warned with a sullen face: \"Eldest's wife, if you don't want to raise, don't get pregnant in the first place. Since she's already born, you got to raise her!\"Wan Chun Ju shivered all over and repeatedly nodded: \"I didn't say I wouldn't raise her... I just feel a little depressed.\"It was more than a little. It was completely depressing!After longing for her son for more than eight months, it suddenly became a daughter. How could she bear this?What was even worse was that when she was pregnant, she boasted her son in her belly everywhere. If the production team knew that she had given birth to a daughter, who knew how they would laugh at her!And Lin Hui, she will give birth in five months. What if she has a son?With so many reasons above, how could she not feel depressed?But the more she looked at the little daughter, the less pleasing she was to her eye!Qiao Xiu Zhi gave her a cool gaze, but did not continue to scold her.She knew that Eldest Daughter-in-law preferred sons over daughters. When she gave birth to the first two daughters, her dark face displayed disdain.Still, Wan Chun Ju knew proportions. She would breastfeed when it was time to breastfeed. She paid attention the baby. She would guard the baby all night when the baby get sick. Much better than Fang Xiao Juan.Thinking of Fang Xiao Juan, Qiao Xiu Zhi couldn't help but look at Da Qiao beside her.Now this child was fair and tender. Her small face got flesh and was rosy. Completely different from half a year ago.At the beginning, she separated Fang Xiao Juan out because she hated Fang Xiao Juan. So she basically didn't interfere in the affairs of the small house.She and Xue Chuan knew that Fang Xiao Juan didn't like Da Qiao. But Fang Xiao Juan never beat or scolded the children in front of them or old Second.Later, seeing the child getting thinner and thinner. When asked, Fang Xiao Juan said Da Qiao had a bad stomach and couldn't eat too much. Once consume too much, she would vomit. Qiao Xiu Zhi had asked Da Qiao herself and the child confirmed her mom's words, saying she can't eat it.Xue Chuan's health wasn't very good during those years. She had to take care of her husband and work in the field, so she couldn't pay heed so much. Since Fang Xiao Juan didn't commit anything overboard. she didn't intervene.Now that she thought about it, she suddenly felt she wronged this child.In the past, she didn't have the child in her heart. So she didn't feel distressed. But now she can't see her being aggrieved at all.Da Qiao sensed her grandmother's gaze. She turned back and showed her small teeth as she smiled sweetly: \"Grandmother, why are you looking at me?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi reached out and rubbed her hair, \"Grandmother thinks you look good in this dress. I will ask your grandfather to make it for you again.\"Da Qiao smiled even more happily. Her eyebrows were curved: \"Thank you, Grandmother, but I have enough clothes. Don't need to make any more!\"Seeing that the child was so considerate and sensible, Qiao Xiu Zhi's heart went soft: \"Then I will make some garlic-flavored green beans for you as snacks.\"\"Grandmother, you are so nice!\" Da Qiao hugged her grandmother's thigh and rubbed it like a little puppy.Seeing that her mother-in-law doted on Da Qiao so much, vinegar brew in Wa Chun Ju's heart.Mother-in-law got bad habits!With so many grandchildren, she didn't fancy any of them. Just only favored Da Qiao!It was fine in the past. But recently, parent-in-laws had doted on Da Qiao without limit. Whatever good things always went to Da Qiao first. Every time she was jealous, but can only hold it back!Suddenly, she turned her head and her eyes fell on the little daughter who had stopped crying. A light flashed in her eyes.Everyone used to say that Mother-in-law was the least patriarchal person in the production team, but she didn't believe it at all.How could someone in this world not prefer son over daughter?It was just Lin Family, who seems to love their only daughter Lin Hui. But wasn't Lin Family's things still left to five sons in the end?But now seeing her mother-in-law smiling lovingly at Da Qiao, she suddenly believed it.Since Mother-in-law can dote on Da Qiao, she can dote on the other granddaughters too!Her two daughters were stupid. They won't be able to flatter Mother-in-law like Da Qiao. So the two of them definitely can't do it. But the youngest daughter was still young. If she taught her to flatter Mother-in-law since she is a babe, she could out compete Da Qiao, no?Besides, youngest daughter share the same birthday as Mother-in-law. For this, Mother-in-law will pay more attention to her!The more Wan Chun Ju thought about it, the brighter her eyes became. Little Dong Lin happened turned around to catch this scene. So frightened, he quickly covered his eyes with his small hands.\"Aiya, my precious little Yun Yun. Mom is here. Mom loves you!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi: \"...\"Da Qiao:\"\u2026\u2026\"Wan Chun Ju picked up her sleeping little daughter and rubbed her little face with her big pancake face.Her skin was very coarse and her movements were rough. It immediately hurt little Dong Yun.Little Dong Yun wailed again. Her face flushed from crying.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't know what Eldest Daughter-in-law was up to now. She scolded, \"Why aren't you letting go of the child? Can't you see the child's face turning red?\"Wan Chun Ju wasn't angry about getting told off. Instead, she was extremely happy: \"Mom, I understand. I just love this child too much. Little Yun Yun, look how much your grandmother loves you. Mommy just touched you and your grandmother can't bare it. Once you grow up, you have to be filial to your grandmother!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi: \"...\"When Qiao Zhen Guo came in, he heard his wife's words and nodded in agreement, \"Wife, after all these years, you have finally spoken human words!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"What did he mean by she finally spoken human words? It can't be that all she said before were nonsense?Qiao Xiu Zhi can't stand the sight of this pair of idiots. She turned to ask the doctor.These days, most people gave birth at home. Wan Chun Ju was sent to the health clinic because the labor came too sudden and Granny Wen was in the neighboring production team.The male doctor said Wan Chun Ju was in top-notch condition and can be moved back. No need to stay at the clinic.When Qiao Xiu Zhi heard this, she turned around and went out. She got Eldest to quickly pack up and carry his wife back.Shortly after Qiao Xiu Zhi left, Chen Qiao Qiao ran in and said with a sweaty face, \"Doctor Tian, I'm so sorry, I'm late!\"Tian Jian Ming took out a handkerchief from his pocket and handed it over, \"It's fine. It's just you and me here. I won't say.\"As he spoke, he mischievously winked at her.Chen Qiao Qiao didn't know whether it was because of the exercise or because of his actions, her cheeks turned red.Tian Jian Ming put the handkerchief in her hand and urged, \"Wipe the sweat. This handkerchief has just been washed. You don't have to worry about any smell.\"Doctor Tian put the handkerchief to her. Don't know if it was due to carelessness, his fingers hooked over her palm.Chen Qiao Qiao's body trembled for a while. Her face turned even redder: \"No. I'm not worried about the smell. Doctor Tian should take this handkerchief back!\"Saying that, she put the handkerchief on the table.Tian Jian Ming wasn't angry: \"Aren't you usually very punctual? Why are you suddenly late today? Did something happen at home?\"Chen Qiao Qiao's eyes flashed: \"My man came back from the county. I wanted to make him braised pork. I went to the supply and demand cooperative to line up before dawn, so I came back late.\"Tian Jian Ming looked at her closely with his pair of peach blossom eyes.Chen Qiao Qiao felt completely at lost: \"Why is Doctor Tian looking at me like this? Is my face dirty?\"Tian Jian Ming shook his head slowly and replied: \"I think you are too good. Knowledgeable and reasonable. Virtuous and capable too. It is a blessing of three lifetimes for your man to marry a wife like you! If I can marry a woman like you, I will definitely cherish her in my hands for the rest of my life and take good care of her!\"Chen Qiao Qiao met his eyes. Her heart jumped quickly as her ears also became hot.Tian Jian Ming noticed her pink ears and the corners of her mouth became more curved.Chen Qiao Qiao was inexplicably flustered and stammered: \"I, I saw Mother-in-law packing things just now. I'll go take a look.\"After she finished speaking, she turned and ran.Tian Jian Ming watched her fleeing back. Picking up the handkerchief on the table, he put it under his nose and smelled it. He smiled with a spring breeze on his face....Due to Wan Chun Ju's sudden birth, many things weren't ready.The most important brown sugar for confinement wasn't enough. So Qiao Hong Xia volunteered to go to the supply and demand cooperative to buy it.For a divorced woman with a child like her, she would have a very hard life if home hadn't taken her in.Now that everyone in the family was very busy, she was more than willing to do this errand.When she came to the supply and demand cooperative, there weren't many people because it wasn't a market day. So buying it was quick.Just as she was about to leave, a man and a woman walked in.When the man saw her, his eyes lit up and he shouted excitedly, \"Hong Xia!\"Qiao Hong Xia took a closer look and suddenly wondered why she didn't check today's luck when she went out. She actually encountered Zhao Jie Fang!She didn't give him a glance. She grasped the item and directly departed. However, she was stopped by the woman beside Zhao Jie Fang.\"Oh, so you are Hong Xia?\"Xu Gui Ying looked at Qiao Hong xia with daggered gaze as jealous boiled in her heart.Before, she had clearly heard about Zhao Jie Fang's ex-wife being dark and old-fashioned. How could the woman in front of her have such a good skin? Even standing so close, she couldn't see any major flaws!While she, herself, had powder on her face. And compared to her, she was still a lot darker!Simply infuriating!\"Step aside!\"Qiao Hong Xia hadn't noticed this woman at first. But hearing her sour tone, she guessed her identity at once.She gave Zhao Jie Fang a sneering expression.This man was really not picky. He can actually take a bite of this old bacon! Wasn't he afraid of getting it stuck in his teeth?When Zhao Jie Fang saw her like this, his face immediately flushed red. But he couldn't bear to turn his eyes away either. His eyes were glued to her face.After a few months of not seeing her, she had gotten even prettier!The way she looked now reminded him of what she looked like when he first saw her.Seeing her man's eyes glued to Qiao Hong Xia, Xu Gui Ying gritted her teeth in anger.Her eyes narrowed and she smirked, \"Hong Xia, why are you in such a hurry to leave? Although you did Jie Fang wrong back then, you guys are divorced for so long. Zhao Family doesn't blame you anymore. Why should you be cold?\"Seeing everyone looking over, Xu Gui Ying spoke with more vigor and deliberately raised her voice.Qiao Hong Xia was trembling with anger!This woman started talking nonsense as soon as she opened her mouth. Look at what she said. If someone didn't know it, they would think she did something bad and got divorced!Sure enough, she saw that several salesmen heard that she was divorced and their eyes suddenly became a little strange.Zhao Jie Fang saw her flushing with anger and immediately turned his head to Xu Gui Ying, \"Don't talk nonsense. I was the one who did Hong Xia wrong!\"Seeing him speak for Qiao Hong Xia, Xu Gui Ying's jealousy flared even higher: \"Zhao Jie Fang, why are you still protecting her at this time? Have you forgotten what she said to you?\"Zhao Jie Fang's face turned even redder.Seeing Zhao Jie Fang's cowardly appearance, Qiao Hong Xia looked down on him more and more. She was glad that she didn't get back with him out of impulse back then.She suddenly rolled her eyes and asked Zhao Jie Fang, \"After talking for so long, I still don't know who she is to you?\"Xu Gui Ying raised her chin like a proud old peacock: \"You should have heard that Jie Fang remarried? I am his wife!\"Qiao Hong Xia took a step back deliberately and exaggeratedly examined her: \"My God, I'm really blind. If you didn't tell me, I would have thought you were Zhao Jie Fang's godmother! After all, you look older than Zhao Jie Fang by dozens of years. Who could have thought...\"It wasn't that she didn't know how to say heart-jabbing words, but she didn't want to say it. Since she wanted to be scolded so much, she could only fulfill her wish!\"You\u2026\u2026!\"Xu Gui Ying was so furious that her face flashed red and white. Tremblingly, she pointed at Qiao Hong Xia. The powder on her face was shaken and flew straight.Qiao Hong Xia covered her mouth and coughed twice: \"Why do you put so much powder on your face. It's choking to death!\"After speaking, she directly passed the two of them and walked out of the supply and demand cooperative without looking back.\"B*tch, don't go...\"From inside, Xu Gui Ying's hissing voice sounded.Then it was Zhao Jie Fang's voice dissuading her: \"Gui Ying, don't be like this...\"\"Zhao Jie Fang, let me go! Do you still have that woman in your mind!? Take this... waa waa...\"Xu Gui Ying rushed up and scratched Zhao Jie Fang's face.Qiao Hong Xia was very happy when she heard the sound of a dog biting a dog inside!Halfway back, a bicycle passed her and turned into the entrance of the Qili production team.She eyed the cyclist's back and guessed who he was. He didn't look like a postman.Unexpectedly, the bicycle suddenly stopped the next moment. The burly man on the bike turned to look at her.The man had a very firm expression and a wheatish complexion. His physique was burly and taller than her eldest brother. From the look of it, he was about twenty-six to twenty-seven years old.She felt that this man was a little familiar, as if she had seen him somewhere. But she couldn't remember at the moment.The man stared at her. Then he pushed his foot and turned around to ride over. He stopped again in front of her and spoke, \"Are you going back to your maternal home?\"Qiao Hong Xia was stunned: \"You know me?\"The man nodded: \"I'm Wang Family's old Third, Wang Yan Sheng. I got home last night!\"Qiao Hong Xia recalled after hearing his self-introduction.Of course, she knew Wang Yan Sheng. But the last time she saw this man was seven or eight years ago. At that time, he had just left for the army. Later, she married Zhao Jie Fang and never saw him again.She felt his return should be related to Wang Family's matter. She couldn't help but sigh for him: \"I'm not going back to my maternal home. I'm going back to my home.\"Wang Yan Sheng was stunned when he heard her response. His dark brows furrowed together with a puzzled look on his face.Qiao Hong Xia explained: \"I got divorced half a year ago. Now I live with my second elder brother. So I'm going home, not my maternal home!\"A flash of surprise passed in Wang Yan Sheng's eyes. He had only returned for less than half a day That's why, he didn't hear about her divorce.He said apologetically, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know you had...\"Qiao Hong Xia dismissed without a care: \"It's nothing. I'm very happy to leave such garbage!\"Wang Yan Sheng looked at her with unfathomable eyes.Qiao Hong Xia was a little out of depth under his gaze and coughed: \"It's getting late. I want to send the brown sugar to my eldest sister-in-law.\"Wang Yan Sheng nodded. He turned the front of the bike and made way for her.Qiao Hong Xia passed him and left.Wang Yan Sheng watched her slender back. He opened his mouth but didn't ask her if she wanted to catch a ride on his bicycle in the end.He had learned how powerful were the women's mouth many years ago. If he really gave her a ride and they got seen, she would be criticized!Qiao Hong Xia could feel two hot eyes remaining on her back. It made her very nervous as she walked away.Fortunately, Wang Yan Sheng soon passed her on the bicycle.She looked at the other party's tall figure and breathed a sigh of relief....After the production team knew Wan Chun Ju gave birth to a daughter, all kind of words were said.\"Oh, I laughed so hard! When she was pregnant, she was so proud. She held her big belly every day and bragged that she must have a gold bump in her belly. Who knew that she actually gave birth to a daughter in the end!\"\"I heard that she cried at the health clinic last night! Who told her her to make such great fanfare everywhere. Now it's shameful!\"\"If Lin Hui had a son, then her son An Ping wouldn't be the only male grandson in Qiao Family. She would be even more mad at that time!\"\"Her maternal family has given birth to four or five daughters in a row. While she gave birth to a son with on her third pregnancy. She should thank her good fate. Can't believe she she wants to have another son. It's a daydream!\"\"Do you think she will become the second Fang Xiao Juan?\"\"Probably not. After all, she still lives with her mother-in-law!\"Not only people outside thought that Wan Chun Ju would dislike her youngest daughter, Qiao Dong Yun, but even Qiao Family thought the same.Surprisingly...\"My precious darling. Mommy loves you!\"\"Mom's little sweetie, you are the most beautiful! Look at your nose and eyes. You look exactly like your grandmother!\"Everyone: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi was even more speechless. She felt offended.Qiao Zhen Guo spoke: \"Wife, you have a problem with your eyes. Our daughter's mouth is obviously like yours. It's as big as yours. It is estimated that when she grows up, she will be able to eat a big mantou in one bite!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...Qiao Zhen Guo, just shut up!\"Hearing her man's words, she almost spat out a mouthful of blood!This damn man. Don't speak if he don't know how to. He will always drive her mad as soon as he open his mouth!However, Qiao Zhen Guo didn't shut up. Instead, he continued to add a jab: \"Also, her nose is like yours. Look how flat it is. As if her face was smashed beforehand! Hey, what should this child do when she grows up so ugly? \"Wan Chun Ju almost spurted blood: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi rolled her eyes. She felt if she stayed any longer, she probably wanted to beat her son!Da Qiao and other Qiao children surrounded little Dong Yun. They silently lit a candle for her.Little Dong Yun's current appearance was indeed not good-looking.Her skin was very dark. What's more, she got a big pancake face. At first glance, it was a miniature version of Wan Chun Ju.Wan Chun Ju was pissed: \"Qiao Zhen Guo, if you dare to talk nonsense again, don't come into the room in the future!\"Qiao Zhen Guo nodded and replied, \"Alright. After you gave birth, your snoring got worse. I'm afraid that if this continues, the roof will be overturned by you!\"Wan Chun Ju was so angry that her face turned red and white: \"Qiao Zhen Guo, go scram...\"Qiao Zhen Guo hummed a little song as he scrammed away.Da Qiao ran out. She touched her mom's belly and asked, \"Mom, is Younger Brother obedient today?\"Lin Hui smiled softly: \"Younger Brother is very obedient. As well-behaved as you.\"Da Qiao smiled with crescent eyes: \"Mom, why do I feel that your belly is much bigger than when Eldest Aunt was four months old?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71Lin Hui came to a halt.In fact, she had realized this before. But she thought it was because she ate well and caused her stomach to be a little bigger. Now she wasn't sure.Qiao Xiu Zhi came out of the kitchen just when she heard this. She walked over and said, \"Your belly is indeed a bit big. You look like someone at six months. Maybe it's a double egg yolk. Go back and get old Second to take you to the town to check.\"Double yolk?Lin Hui was stunned again. Could it be that she was pregnant with twins?Little Dong Lin ran over and asked in his baby voice, \"Grandmother, what is a double egg yolk?\"Little Yi Ming, who was inseparable with him, rushed to the scene in a second. His small eyes sent him a contemptuous gaze and said, \"Don't even understand this? It's just that your mom has two egg yolks in her belly!\"\"Pfft...\"What a fairy interpretation!When everyone heard this, they couldn't help but laugh.Da Qiao didn't quite understand it at first, but after a while it dawned on her: \"Mom, do you have two younger brothers in your belly?\"Lin Hui rubbed her hair with a smile and replied, \"It's possible to be a younger brother and younger sisters. We'll know in five months.\"Learning from Wan Chun Ju's lesson, she couldn't firmly believe that she had a son in her belly.When Wan Chun Ju heard everyone's words at the window, her facial features were twisted with jealousy.Pah!Want to have twins? Simply daydreaming!At that time, when a pair of twin daughters come out, the small house will be lively. With Xiao Qiao, there are four daughters in total!As she soak in her proud mood, she suddenly let out an \"ouch\". There was a pain in her chest. She looked down and saw little Dong Yun biting her hard. She wanted to curse but thinking how her mother-in-law was outside, she held it back in the end.Qiao Zhen Guo came in with a bowl of brown sugar egg water, \"Wife, why are screaming again? You've been screaming every day. Do you know what the production team calls you now?\"Wan Chun Ju pried away little Dong Yun's mouth and responded, \"What do they call me?\"Qiao Zhen Guo placed the brown sugar egg water on the table: \"They say you shriek every day like a slaughtered pig, so they nicknamed you\u00a0ten thousand pig slaughterer! Hahaha...\"Wan Chin Ju: \"...\"Which wicked person said that about her. Once she find out who, see if won't slap them to death!\"You think I want to scream. It's all because of your youngest daughter. Just days after being born, she already know how to bite someone!\"An average baby won't bite while breastfeeding until the start to teeth in four-five months. However little Dong Yun was born less than two days ago!Qiao Zhen Guo came over, looked at his youngest daughter proudly, and stated, \"As expected of Qiao Family's child. She is born with great strength!\"Hearing this, Wan Chun Ju's eyes instantly lit up: \"Oh, you're right. No wonder my precious little Yun Yun is born on the same day as her grandmother. Even her strength is similar!\"After two days, Qiao Zhen Jun asked the production team leader for leave. He took his wife to the town for a check up.Traditional Chinese medicine sector had took a very hard hit these days. None of the doctors in the town hospital can take the pulse. The hospital wasn't fully equipped. They can only do general examinations and make judgments based on experience.Doctor Hao from the Department of Gynecology said: \"Eight-nine out of ten, it's twins. Your current physical condition is very good. Just keep going.\"Qiao Zhen Jun and Lin Hui looked at each other. They were delighted. It didn't matter to them whether it was a son or a daughter. As long as the child was healthy, it was enough.Qiao Zhen Jun recalled Fang Xiao Juan's bleeding during labor and expressed his worries: \"Doctor, the risk of having twins seems to be relatively high. What should I pay attention to?\"\"All births have risk. Usually try to eat less food that is too cold. At the later stage, don't go to work in the fields. Pregnant women still need to pay attention to exercise so that they will have strength when they give birth.\"Although the man in front of him was a country man, Doctor Hao can tell he cared about his wife very much.Qiao Zhen Jun nodded again and again. Taking in everything that needed to be noted in his mind.His nervous state would stranger assume it was his first time as a father.In fact, when Fang Xiao Juan was pregnant, he was overjoyed. But Fang Xiao Juan was too difficult to serve. She called him useless every day. No matter how good-tempered he was, his heart gradually became cold.After coming out of the doctor's office, Qiao Zhen Jun told her to sit in the chair while he went to the dining hall to buy some food.Lin Hui watched his running away back. Her heart seemed to be soaked in honey water. So sweet.In the past, she had married Dong Lin's dad. Putting aside the fact that their personality weren't compatible, she had regretted it soon after she married.It was estimated that the other party also regretted it. He married because he had no hope of returning to the city and he was getting older. He wanted to find someone in the production team who could help him.Although Lin Family wasn't well-off, the family had sufficient labor force. She was the only daughter in the family. So it was a very good choice. Who could known at little Dong Lin's eighth month, he suddenly received news that city return was possible. No matter how much she begged, he didn't want to stay. He packed up his baggage and left without hesitation.What was even more unexpected was that less than half a year after he left, the news of his drowning death came. She became a widow before she was twenty-one years old.After the people in the production team found out, all kind of things were said. Many people said that she cursed her husband. When hearing those gossips, she pretended that nothing happened on the surface. When in truth, she was very depressed...\"Lin Hui?\" Just as Lin Hui was stuck in her memories, a female voice sounded from beside her.She looked over and saw Qin Xiao Mei holding her son Shen Tian You less than two meters away from her. With a smile on her face, she spoke: \"Elder Sister Xiao Mei, why are you here?\"Qin Xiao Mei pointed at Shen Tian You, who was a little sullen, and replied, \"This kid caught a cold from kicking the quilt off at night. I was taking him for a check up with the doctor. How about you? Why are you here alone?\"Saying that, she beckoned Shen Tian You to greet people.Shen Tian You seemed to be thinner than before and looked listless: \"Auntie Hui, did Elder Sister Da Qiao not come with you?\"Lin Hui shook her head: \"Your elder sister Qiao is going to school. So she didn't come.\"Shen Tian You pouted, \"Once I recover, I'll go to see and play with Elder Sister Da Qiao.\"Lin Hui readily agreed. She turned to Qin Xiao Mei and said, \"I came with Da Qiao's dad. My belly is a little too big, so we came here to have a look.\"Only then did Qin Xiao Mei notice Lin Hui's belly: \"Oh, if you didn't mention, I wouldn't notice. Your belly looks bigger than when I was pregnant with Tian You at six months. Could it be twins?\"Lin Hui pursed her lips and nodded: \"En, the doctor said it should be twins.\"Qin Xiao Mei looked envious: \"I really envy you. You already have two lovely children. Now you're pregnant with twins. I don't want twins, I just want a daughter who is as delicate and sweet as Da Qiao!\"Shen Tian You said: \"Mom, isn't Elder Sister Da Qiao already your daughter?\"Qin Xiao Mei's eyes lit up and suggested, \"Lin Hui, you have so many children in your family. Why don't you leave Da Qiao in my home to raise in the future?\"At once, Lin Hui didn't know whether to laugh or cry: \"This can't do. No matter how many children there are, they can't compare to Da Qiao!\"Putting aside her, her parents-in-law will definitely not let Da Qiao go to Shen's house with their love for her.Qin Xiao Mei immediately wilted: \"I know it's impossible. By the way, does your man want to come to work in the town?\"Lin Hui was stunned.Qin Xiao Mei continued: \"I have a relative who is the director of a food factory. Recently, a gatekeeper is leaving. If you want, I can help you with it.\"\"I'll thank Elder Sister Xiao Mei now. But I have to go back and discuss it with my mother-in-law and my man.\"Lin Hui was excited for a while. Who didn't want to be an employee these days?As an employee, the wages were high and it was respectful. What's more, it wasn't tiring. Everyone wanted to be an employee. But how was it so easy to be employed?Since Qin Xiao Mei was able to say this to them, she sincerely treated them as relatives!Qin Xiao Mei nodded: \"Okay. Once you thought it through, come back and tell me. This matter has to settled quick, or it will be taken away by others!\"Lin Hui naturally agreed.Qin Xiao Mei was in a hurry to go back. So she left without waiting for Qiao Zhen Jun to come back.When Qiao Zhen Jun came back, Lin Hui told him about it. Qiao Zhen Jun was also thrilled.Back at Qiao's house, Qiao Zhen Jun immediately told his parents about this.Qiao Xiu Zhi asked him after listening, \"Do you want to go?\"Qiao Zhen Jun nodded: \"I want to!\"At the production team, they worked hard every day and the money earned throughout the year wasn't as much as the employee's earning in two or three months. He wanted his family to live a better life. That's why, he wanted to go!Qiao Xiu Zhi stated: \"Since you want to go, then go to Shen's house tomorrow with gifts and tell them. But before the matter is settled, don't say it.\"Qiao Zhen Jun nodded again. He took another leave the next day to go to town....On this day, when Da Qiao passed by the pigsty after school, she received a signal from Elder Brother Huo Chi.She turned around and spoke to her cousins, \"Elder Cousin Brother, Elder Cousin Sister, I have something to do, so I won't go with you.\"\"Pfft...\"Before going to school, Da Qiao always liked to called herself little Cutie. But since she attended school, she stopped. Qiao Dong Ying suddenly felt a lost of amusement.Seeing her acting as a little adult now, she suddenly found the amusement again. She couldn't help reaching out and pinch her little face.Qiao Dong He slapped her younger sister's paw away. Glancing at Huo Chi, she spoke, \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, although that family aren't bad people, you have to be careful. Don't let anyone bump into you guys, understand? \"When Qiao Dong Ying heard this, she agreed: \"Especially Xiao Qiao. Protect yourself from that not-so- cutie!\"Since the death of old Fifth Wang, Xiao Qiao had appeared in front of Da Qiao from time to time to show sisterly affection. Simply made people lose their appetite!The seven-year-old child had so many scheme. Don't know what she wanted to do this time!Da Qiao nodded like a chick pecking rice: \"I understand. Elder Cousin Sisters , you don't have to worry about me. I'm already a big girl!\"\"Pfft... Hahaha... little Cutie Da Qiao. You are so funny!\" Qiao Dong Ying shook from laughing.Qiao Dong He couldn't help but pursed her lips in amusement.Seven-year-old little dumpling said that she was a big girl, so she and Dong Ying were old girls then?An Ping imitated his dad and sighed, \"Once a daughter grow up, you can't keep her home. If you do keep her, it will cause anxiousn... Ouch, Second Elder Sister, what did you beat me?\"Qiao Dong Ying rolled hers eyes at him and responded, \"Don't talk nonsense. Always told you to study more and you don't! Also, why have you been imitating Dad recently?\"An Ping scratched his head and showed a goofy grin, \"Second Elder Sister, don't you find the way Dad talk to Mom every time funny? Especially every time Mom is so angry that she jumps up and down like a monkey!\"When Da Qiao heard her elder cousin brother's words, she silently lit a candle for Eldest Aunt.Once her cousins were far away, she walked toward Elder Brother Huo Chi: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, what did you look for me for?\"Huo Chi glanced at her flushed face. He felt that her face seemed to be rounder: \"Let's go to West Wood!\"Since the last time they roasted sweet potatoes in West Wood, they had been there a few times. Every time they went, they can find something delicious inside.Thinking of this, Da Qiao couldn't help swallowing. She smacked his lips and asked, \"Are we going to find bird eggs this time?\"Huo Chi gave mysterious vibe: \"You will know when you go!\"His family had received so many favors from Qiao Family, especially from Da Qiao. He always wanted to do something to repay her.It was a pity that they were wicked people. Not only did they have no money, but they also can't leave the production team. He can only go to West Wood to find some delicious food for her.Da Qiao admired and trusted Elder Brother Huo Chi's ability to find food. Seeing him say this, she didn't ask any more questions and went into the woods with him.After they left, Xiao Qiao came out from behind the bushes. She frowned before immediately followed.In order not to be discovered by them, she didn't dare to get too close. She trialed from a distance.Unexpectedly, as soon as the two of them entered the forest, it was like a mouse entering a cave. They dug further and further and soon she lost them.Damn it!Xiao Qiao gritted her teeth and stomped her feet angrily!But soon she didn't have time to be angry, because... she was lost!Da Qiao didn't know that her younger sister followed her into the woods. She quick followed her elder brother Huo Chi into the depths of the woods. Then they stopped in front of a few mulberry trees.Mulberries ripen from April to June every year. There were also mulberry trees in East Wood. Not only was the quantity little, they were also very sour. Even so, the mulberries would be picked by the villagers as soon as they mature.The mulberry fruit in front of them was big. The flesh looked very plentiful. The color was purple-red. Appeared very sweet at first glance.Looking at the mulberries in front of him, Da Qiao couldn't help drooling: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, you are so amazing. You can find delicious food every time. I adore you so much!\"Hearing her words, Huo Chi's mouth corner raised, but said, \"This isn't anything. Since I can find it, others can also find it.\"Da Qiao fluffily shook her head and replied, \"No. They aren't as awesome as you. Up to this age, I haven't seen anyone else find these things!\"Huo Chi listened to her rainbow-licking and the curvature of the corners of mouth became more obvious: \"Let's start picking!\"Da Qiao nodded quickly. Finally, she understood why Elder Brother Huo Chi came with two empty back-basket. It turned out to be used to hold mulberries!These mulberries tree were all over two meters high. Huo Chi let Da Qiao to pick them at the bottom, while he rolled up his trousers and climbed up the tree to pick them.Da Qiao watched Elder Brother Huo Chi climb higher and said softly, \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, be careful. Don't fall!\"\"Don't worry!\" Huo Chi responded with a smile, \"If you are thirsty, you can eat while picking!\"Da Qiao saw that Elder Brother Huo Chi's nimble movement. Obviously, this was not his first time climbing a tree. So she felt a little relieved.She picked up the picked mulberries and put them in her mouth.Sweet and tart. The sweet juice was a lot. So delicious!She had to pick more of such delicious food. Once she got back, she will share it with everyone.Huo Chi saw that her mouth was dyed purple after eating. He couldn't help but raise the corner of his mouth again.The two filled the two small back baskets before returning. There were still some unripe mulberries on the tree. In a few days, they'll come back to pick them again.Once they got out of the wood, Huo Chi let Da Qiao carry majority of the mulberries back. They couldn't eat so many mulberries at once. And it would be bad if they were discovered.Da Qiao tilted her head and pondered for a while: \"I heard from my grandfather that mulberries can be soaked in wine and it is very good for the body. I will go back and ask my grandfather. After the production is successful, I will give it to you!\"Huo Chi groundlessly nodded. These things were originally for her and Qiao Family. It didn't matter whether they were given to him or not.It was getting late. The two parted ways after saying a few words....Da Qiao carried one on her back and had another in her hand as she returned to Qiao's small house first.Lin Hui was surprised when she saw that she had brought so many mulberries: \"Why are there so many mulberries? Where did you find them?\"Da Qiao didn't dare to tell the truth. She could only vaguely explained: \"I found it in the East Wood.\"Qiao Zhen Jun came over and said, \"Why didn't I see it?\"Lin Hui had been craving sweet and tart things since she was pregnant. After he got off work, he often went to East Wood to look for fruits. East Wood wasn't owned by Qiao Family. Since he can go, others can too. Due to this, he often couldn't find anything.Now that Da Qiao, a child could find so many mulberries, he suddenly felt that he was useless.Lin Hui pursed her lips and smiled, \"Do you think anyone can be as lucky as Da Qiao?\"She was lucky, no?There were so many people in the entire production team looking for fruits. No one found it. While Da Qiao happened to find it!She heard that Da Qiao had picked up two wild chickens and a hundred-year-old Ganoderma lucidum before. With such luck, Fang Xiao Juan actually called her a calamity. Simply blind!Just as her mother-in-law said, Fang Xiao Juan will regret it one day.In fact, what she didn't know was that Fang Xiao Juan had long regretted it and planned to return to Qiao Family.Da Qiao divided a third of the mulberries. Then she took the rest to the Qiao's old house.Family members in Qiao's old house were equally stunned when they saw so many mulberries.An Ping grinned until his teeth was seen and his eyes weren't: \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, Elder Cousin Brother will never stop you from playing with that kid from Huo Family!\"When there was food, everything was negotiable!Da Qiao pursed her lips and smiled. She asked her grandfather about mulberry wine.Xue Chuan nodded: \"Mulberry can be made into wine. I will go to town to buy some wine in two days.\"Qiao Zhen Min said, \"Dad, you don't need to go. I'll bring back two bottles later.\"Xue Chuan directed to Da Qiao, \"When your fifth uncle brings the wine back, Grandfather will help you!\"Da Qiao smiled sweetly: \"Grandfather is the best!\"Qiao Zhen Min teased her, \"Your grandfather is the best, while Fifth Uncle isn't?\"Da Qiao merrily responded, \"Fifth Uncle is good, but not as good as Grandfather and Grandmother!\"Qiao Zhen Min: \"...\"It was all joy and fun here. However, Xiao Qiao, who was in the woods, was steaming mad to the point her facial features were twisted!She had been wandering in the woods for more than an hour. Her feet were sore. She had been circling around in circles!If it goes on like this, she will definitely not be able to get out before it gets dark!The thought of spending the night in the woods made her panic.To make matters worse, her mom may not notice her absence!Come to think of it, her mom seem to have changed since she came back from the hospital. She looked at her with strange eyes from time to time!Suddenly, a thought flashed in her mind. It couldn't be that... someone transmigrated into her mom?But thinking of the stupid things her mom did, she immediately shook her head again. Forget it, now was not the time to think about these things. She had to find a way out!Sadly, she still couldn't find her way out even when it got completely dark.During the day, the forest was quiet and serene. That was already scary. Now the surroundings were completely dark. The branches of the trees were like monsters with their teeth and claws bared in the night. As if they we're opening their mouths at her!Xiao Qiao shrank under a big tree. Her eyes widened as she looked around vigilantly. She was frightened to death.Suddenly, a \"hissing\" sound came from above her head. An ominous premonition surged in her heart. She turned her head with a stiff neck...A small arm-thick green snake coiled on a branch entered her sight. It spat out its red snake tongue at her!\"Ahhhhh...\"Xiao Qiao was so scared that her heart stopped!She was afraid of snakes the most!Without any thinking, she turned and ran!There was no moon tonight. Within the woods, one could barely see one's fingers. She didn't know that there was a slope in front of her. She rushed over and fell down. Then she rolled down like a ball.\"BANG!\"Her head slammed against a large rock. Her vision turned black as her eyes rolled. She had fainted!...Fang Xiao Juan wasn't feeling well today. Her stomach was aching all the time. She laid on the bed for a day, but the pain still didn't go away.She originally wanted to wait for Xiao Qiao to come back to cook for her. But once it got dark and she was still nowhere in sight!\"Damn girl. Don't come back if you can!\" Pale face, she berated as she stood up by supporting herself with the head of the bed.She thought Xiao Qiao went to Qiao's house to find Qiao Zhen Jun.In the previous life, Xiao Qiao was a fool who couldn't take care of herself. She kept drooling every day. Nor could she speak clearly. What was even more disgusting was that she still pooed on herself from time to time!The person she hated most in her last life was this daughter, Xiao Qiao. She wanted to dump her many times, but Qiao Zhen Jun refused. Qiao Xiu Zhi also warned her many times. So, she gave up.That fool, Xiao Qiao lived to drag the whole family down in the last life. In the last life, Da Qiao insisted on taking Xiao Qiao with her when she marry. This caused Da Qiao to not marry until the age of twenty-five or six!After being reborn, she found that not only Da Qiao had become beautiful, but Xiao Qiao was no longer retarded. Not only was she not a fool, she actually became a well-known little prodigy!This didn't make her happy. Instead, it made her vigilant. She suspected that this person, was like herself: encountered some strange event.So these days she didn't dare to let Xiao Qiao see that she was different as she quietly observed her.Although Xiao Qiao hadn't shown much traces for the time being, she can be sure that there was definitely not a seven-year-old child in that body!It was just that she wasn't in good shape now. She didn't plan to reveal her now. Not to mention that she was also finding ways to go back to Qiao's house like her. So she allowed her to run to Qiao Zhen Jun from time to time.So when Xiao Qiao didn't come back at this time, she automatically assumed that she was staying at Qiao's house.She made a quick meal and went to bed again.The next day, Xiao Qiao still hadn't come back.Fang Xiao Juan wasn't anxious at all. Instead, she felt that Xiao Qiao was still somewhat useful. She was able to insert her into Qiao Family so quickly.Originally, she wanted to take a leave of absence. On second thought, this was a good time to brush up good impression. So she got up, ate something and went to work.When she came to the field, Wang Shui Sheng frowned as soon as he saw her: \"Fang Xiao Juan, why are you late again today? I'll deduct your work points!\"Fang Xiao Juan searched for Qiao Zhen Jun's whereabouts in the crowd and said indifferently, \"Up to you. Deduct as many as you want!\"Once she return to Qiao's house, what need did she have for these work points?From a distance, she saw Qiao Zhen Jun standing on the other side of the farmland, holding a hoe in his hand as he smiled gently at Lin Hui.Her eyes pinned on Lin Hui like a poisonous snake. Her heart was sour.In the last life, this woman stomped herself under her feet. In this life, it was the same. She can't accept this!She strode towards them.Seeing Fang Xiao Juan like this, Wang Shui Sheng's brows frowned so much that it could pinch a fly.What did this woman want to do?Judging by how she stared at old Second Qiao and his wife without blinking just now, she should be thinking of returning to Qiao Family?The more Wang Shui Sheng thought about it, the more plausible it was. He felt that he should get his wife to inform Qiao Family.Fang Xiao Juan walked over and showed a sweet smile to Qiao Zhen Jun: \"Child's dad, I want to say a few words to you.\"When Fang Xiao Juan walked towards this side, everyone had noticed it. Hearing this, they quickly perked up their ears while working.Lin Hui felt uncomfortable when she saw Fang Xiao Juan calling out Qiao Zhen Jun in front of everyone.Qiao Zhen Jun didn't want to have anything to do with her at all. With a straight face, he stated, \"I have nothing to say to you!\"Fang Xiao Juan didn't expect Qiao Zhen Jun to be rude. Furious, she gritted her teeth!Lin Hui felt relieved when she saw her man didn't give her any good attitude. She handed over the kettle: \"Drink some water. In a bit, you'll start fetching water.\"Qiao Zhen Jun smiled happily: \"The sun is getting bigger and bigger. Go back early. You don't have to bring water later. If I want to drink, I will go back and drink it myself.\"Lin Hui sent him a pointed gaze, \"I'm not just delivering water to you alone. I need to deliver water to Dad, Mom, and Elder Brother!\"The villagers and Fang Xiao Juan were both caught off guard and got fed a mouthful of dog food: \"...\"Male villagers, especially single dogs like Gou Sheng, were envious.Not only did Lin Hui bring in a lot of dowry, but she also became more and more beautiful after marriage. Fang Xiao Juan, who used to be the flower of Dongfeng Community, was simply unsightly when standing in front of her!If they knew this earlier, they would have gone to Lin Family earlier to ask for marriage. Old Second Qia was so lucky. The two wives before and after were so pretty. Extremely envious!Fang Xiao Juan was so irked that she almost exploded!Though she didn't love Qiao Zhen Jun, she had lived with Qiao Zhen Jun all her life in her last life. In her eyes, Qiao Zhen Jun was her property. Other women weren't allowed to stain him!But in order to gain a good impression, she took a deep breath and forced a smile, \"Child's dad, I came to you not for anything else, but for Xiao Qiao.\"\"What happened to Xiao Qiao?\" Qiao Zhen Jun asked.Although his heart was a little chilled by Xiao Qiao's indifference, she was his own daughter. So he couldn't ignore it.Seeing that he was talking to her, Fang Xiao Juan glanced at Lin Hui proudly. Her voice became even more arrogant: \"Although we said that we should have one child each during the divorce, but the blood relationship can't be cut. Xiao Qiao has always loved you, the dad very much.\u2026\"Impatient, Qiao Zhen Jun interrupted her, \"What on earth are you trying to say?\"She thought she was giving a speech? And a long speech one. He didn't want to listen even if she wanted to!Fang Xiao Juan's facial features were twisted. She took another deep breath again: \"I want to say that Xiao Qiao stayed at Qiao's house last night. Really troubled you...\"But before she could finish speaking, she was interrupted again by Qiao Zhen Jun: \"What did you say? Xiao Qiao wasn't at Qiao's house last night!\"Fang Xiao Juan was stunned: \"Didn't stay at Qiao's house? How is that possible? Where can she go if she wasn't at Qiao's house? She didn't go home last night!\"Qiao Zhen Jun's face turned cold: \"She didn't come back for the whole night and as her biological mother, you're not worried at all?\"Fang Xiao Juan spoke: \"I thought she was with you! Child's dad, what should we do now? I'm so worried about Xiao Qiao. Could something happen to her?\"As she said that, her eyes were red. She leaned toward Qiao Zhen Jun with a teary expression.Qiao Zhen Jun sidestepped. She fell to the ground with a 'bang'. Her elbow hit the stone in the field. The pain caused her tears to spill!\"Hahaha... fell flat on your face!\" On the side, Qiao Zhen Guo laughed out loud when he saw this scene.The female educated youth, Da Zhi, who was working not far from him heard this. Suddenly, she recalled the embarrassing things she had done last time and her face flushed red.Last time, she was beaten up halfway up the mountain for no reason. Everyone in the production team thought she was got forced upon. No matter how she explained it, no one believed her!No matter where she went in this production team, someone looked at her with sympathy as well as feeling she was dirty at the same time. Every time she encountered this, she was steaming!She didn't hadn't got forced upon!She was assaulted by a woman!The production team leader said that he would give her an explanation. But after so long, there was no news at all. She had to find the answer by herself.After thinking about it, she observed the body shapes of all the women in the production team. She felt that the person most likely to hit her was Qiao Zhen Guo's wife, Wan Chun Ju!She looked at Qiao Zhen Guo who was smiling stupidly. She decided not to swallow her voice anymore as she wanted to teach the couple a lesson!Head first, Fang Xiao Juan hit to the ground. Hurt, angry and humiliated brew in her!To go back to Qiao's house, she used what little endurance she had: \"Child's dad, why didn't you support me just now? It caused me to fall. It hurts me to death!\"Qiao Zhen Jun didn't bother to pay attention to whether she was injured or not. He continued to ask: \"Did Xiao Qiao really not go home last night? You'd better not use this kind of thing as a joke!\"Fang Xiao Juan gritted her teeth: \"How could I joke about this kind of thing. What kind of person do you think I am?\"Qiao Zhen Jun wasn't sure if the woman was lying, but he didn't dare to gamble. He raised his head and asked everyone, \"Is there anyone who saw Xiao Qiao yesterday? I must trouble everyone to help and recall!\"Although the villagers were eager to watch gossip, they couldn't help but start talking when they heard Xiao Qiao was missing.\"I haven't seen her!\"\"Me neither!\"\"I've seen her, but it was in the morning. Did she not come back from school yesterday?\"If the child disappear at school, then they have to go to the community to find to them!\"No, she came back yesterday. She came back from school with my daughter. I don't know if she went home after that!\" Xing Hua interjected.After that, no one said that they had seen Xiao Qiao again. Qiao Zhen Jun was afraid that something would happen, so he turned around and said to Lin Hui: \"You go back first. I'll go search around!\"Although Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't like this granddaughter, Xiao Qiao, she didn't want her to die. When she heard that old Second was going to find her alone, she directed at Eldest Son, \"Eldest, you take time off to help search too!\"Qiao Zhen Guo agreed. Together with his second younger brother, he asked Wang Shui Sheng to ask for leave. Then they searched around in the village....They went on from the morning to noon, and then from noon to the evening. Everyone got off work, but Xiao Qiao's whereabout wasn't found.They had searched every corner of the village. Even East Wood had been searched three or four times!Qiao Zhen Jun's face displayed exhaustion: \"Where can the child go?\"A whole living person disappeared in the village. This was a major matter. Wang Shui Sheng didn't dare to delay and immediately organized the villagers to help search.But still no trace!Wang Shui Sheng asked Xing Hua repeatedly: \"Are you sure your daughter came back from school with Xiao Qiao yesterday?\"Xing Hua impatiently responded: \"How many times have you asked, leader? If you don't believe me, go and ask my daughter in person!\"It was time for getting of school now. The children of the production team who went to school in the community came back one after another.When Xing Hua's daughter came back, everyone stopped her to ask. It was exactly what Xing Hua said.When Da Qiao heard that Younger Sister was gone, a thought flashed in her mind. Did Younger Sister follow her and Elder Brother Huo Chi into West Wood yesterday?The reason why she thought this was because Younger Sister had been following her frequently and flattering her from time to time. But she didn't want to talk to her and always tried to avoid her.If she secretly followed her yesterday, she might have followed her into West Wood.Thinking of this, she reached out and pulled her grandmother's hand secretly: \"Grandmother, I might know the whereabouts of Younger Sister.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi wanted to cover her mouth. How could she say such words in front of everyone?But it was still a step too late.Fang Xiao Juan rushed over and agitatedly spoke: \"Da Qiao, what did you just say? You said you know where your younger sister is? Where is she? Tell Mom. Mom is really worried to death!\"She grasped Da Qiao's arm hard. Her expression full of sadness and agitation, vividly expressing the image of a helpless mother with a dead daughter.Seeing her like this, the people around her couldn't help but feel sympathy.\"Although Fang Xiao Juan has a bad temper, she is really good to Xiao Qiao!\"\"Ain't that right. When she was at Qiao's house, she held Xiao Qiao like a pearl in her hand. Later, she got divorced, she insisted on taking her away. Now that the child is lost, she must be very anxious!\"\"Oh, looking at her makes one feel sad. If my child is lost, I might be even crazier than her!\"When Fang Xiao Juan heard everyone's words, she was very proud. She felt that using mother's love to whitewash herself was the right path.Just as she was thinking about this, she took a kick in the chest!She fell back to the ground with a shriek. Looking up, she saw Qiao Xiu Zhi looking at her coldly: \"Stay away from Da Qiao. If you dare to hurt her again, don't blame me for being impolite to you!\"She shivered and tried to explain to herself, but Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't give her a glance.\"Is your hand hurt?\" Qiao Xiu Zhi crouched down and asked.Da Qiao shook her head: \"Don't worry, Grandmother, it doesn't hurt.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't believe her words. She rolled up her sleeves and found two deep red grasp mark on her two fair and tender arms. It was glaring to the eyes.Everyone gasped when they saw Da Qiao's arm. The sympathy that Xiao Juan created just now disappeared.\"Tsk tsk tsk, look at this mom! No matter how worried you are, you shouldn't use such strength. Both arms are bruised. The poor child still says it doesn't hurt!\"\"Come to think of it, she's biased. Have you forgotten how she badly treated Da Qiao in the first place?\"Naturally, everyone hadn't forgotten. A pair of twins, the elder sister was short and sallow, while the younger sister had been raised fair and tender. I seen favoritism, but never seen this degree of favoritism!A breath was stuck in Fang Xiao Juan's chest, almost suffocating herself to death!Qiao Xiu Zhi stared at Da Qiao and said, \"Don't bear it when it hurts in the future, got it?\"\"Got it, Grandmother.\" Da Qiao softly replied.Everyone took in misty eyes and her pale with pain face. Still, she didn't cry. She sensibly stated that it didn't hurt. Everyone's gaze toward Fang Xiao Juan was immediately became unfriendly.\"You just said you knew about Xiao Qiao's whereabouts?\" Qiao Xiu Zhi asked.Now that this matter had been known to everyone, she can only ask her in front of everyone. If not, if something happens to Xiao Qiao, it might be blamed on her.Like Da Qiao, Huo Chi, who was hiding behind the crowd, also guessed that Xiao Qiao probably followed them into West Wood.He was afraid that everyone would blame Da Qiao. As he was about to squeeze into the crowd to tell everyone and take the responsibility upon himself, he heard Da Qiao's crisp voice coming from inside...\"I haven't seen Younger Sister.\"\"You haven't seen your younger sister, so how do you know? Is it fun to play tricks on adults?\" Xing Hua stood up, \"Is this the time to make trouble? Really unsensible!\"\"I didn't make trouble!\" Da Qiao replied, \"I saw everyone had searched everywhere but not the west wood. I wonder if Younger Sister went to West Wood. After all, I only went in the West Wood in winter because Younger Sister told me there were bird eggs in it!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi frowned at once: \"You mean that when you went to West Wood, Xiao Qiao told you to go?\"Da Qiao nodded: \"Younger Sister said Mom wanted to eat meat and if I could find a bird's egg in West Wood back, Mom would definitely like me. So I went with Younger Sister. Soon after entering, Younger Sister disappeared. Then I fell into a trap and was frozen into a popsicle.\"Once these words were voiced out, the crowd instantly burst into an uproar.They were saying, why would Da Qiao go to the West Wood out of the blue. It turned out to be listening to Xiao Qiao!But in the winter, all the birds have gone to the south to spend the winter. How could there be any eggs?Two sisters went in. Why did Xiao Qiao suddenly disappear? After she came out, she didn't tell anyone that Da Qiao had entered West Wood. If she had told the adults earlier, Da Qiao wouldn't have been frozen until only one breath was left. Nor would old Second Qiao become paralyzed!Some people marveled at Xiao Qiao's bad intentions, while others thought it was impossible. No matter how smart Xiao Qiao was at the time, she was only six years old. How could she have such scheming mind?Qiao Family and Fang Xiao Juan knew very well that Xiao Qiao had such scheming heart!Originally, Qiao Zhen Jun was anxious. But now he heard this, his heart filled with disappointment for Xiao Qiao again.\"Let's put this matter aside for the time being. Find her first!\" Wang Shui Sheng coughed, \"I think what Da Qiao said makes sense. In the entire production team, only West Wood hasn't been searched. Let's go inside and look for her.\"If they can't find her, they can only go to the police station and get the police.When everyone heard that they were going to West Wood, they couldn't help but hesitate.West Wood was filled with fog. On top of that, it was filled with traps. Now it was getting late, they will definitely not be able to find their way. If one accidentally fall into the trap, it will be a big loss.At this moment, Huo Chi squeezed in from behind the crowd and spoke to Wang Shui Sheng, \"Leader, when I went to gather pigweed, I found a path to enter West Wood. There are no traps at that entry way. I can show you the way! \"Hearing Huo Chi's words, everyone was shocked.It was just that this wasn't the time to worry about this matter. Wang Shui Sheng came back to his senses and immediately asked him to lead the way.When Dai Shu Fang saw her son rushing out to the front, she was extremely worried. Afraid that everyone would settle accounts later after the event!Fortunately, Huo Chi was smart, he pretended to be unfamiliar. He led everyone around. After a large detour, they entered inside.At first, everyone thought he was very familiar and felt a little uncomfortable. But now seeing him like this, they thought he was a child talking big.He may have come in by accident before. But he didn't tell the production team because he was afraid of being scolded.Entering the forest, everyone discovered that there was a cave in the West Wood. Not only waterfalls, but also many fruit trees!Wang Shui Sheng noticed that everyone's mind was on the fruit tree. He quickly reminded them to search. These things were all here, they can't escape.When everyone heard this, they continued to search.An hour later, everyone found Xiao Qiao under the slope. A bloody wound was smashed open at the back of her head. It was unknown for how long she was unconscious.Qiao Zhen Jun hurriedly sent her to the hospital.Xiao Qiao woke up the next day, but couldn't remember anything.At the same time, Shen Family came to Qiao Family in person and brought good news...Qiao Zhen Jun's decision to go to work in the food factory was set. He'll start to work three days later.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72In the ward of the town hospital.Xiao Qiao blinked her big eyes and uttered with a bewildered look, \"You... who are you? Where is this place?\"For a moment, Fang Xiao Juan was stunned. Soon, she screamed: \"My precious Jiao Jiao, what are you talking about? Don't you recognize Mom?\"Xiao Qiao's arm was in pain from her grasp. There was a look of fear on her face: \"I, I don't know you, who are you? And... Can you let go? You're hurting me!\"Qiao Zhen Jun frowned and asked the doctor, \"Doctor, what's the situation with the child? Why doesn't she recognize anyone?\"The male doctor examined Xiao Qiao and told, \"She hit the back of her head. Maybe there is blood congestion in her brain, which could lead to fragmented memory.\"In these days, when the head was injured and there was no scan or CT scans. The medical equipment was very rudimentary. And the level of medical staff was very limited.\"Then when will she remember?\" Qiao Zhen Jun's frown deepened.The male doctor shook his head: \"It's hard to say. But your family should pay more attention to her. She may be able to remember it slowly.\"After the doctor left, Fang Xiao Juan hugged Xiao Qiao and cried. She thought she was beautiful when she cried.When in reality, her complexion was sallow and haggard. Her two teeth were broken by Lin Family before, so she was no longer as beautiful as she used to be. She had no self-knowledge and thought she was still a flower of Dongfeng Community.Qiao Zhen Jun didn't look at her. He asked Xiao Qiao softly, \"Xiao Qiao, I'm Dad. Do you remember?\"Xiao Qiao tilted her head and blinked her big and confused eyes. It took a long time before she shook her head and answered, \"I don't remember...but I think I...seem to have seen you somewhere!\"Qiao Zhen Jun said excitedly: \"Good child, think about it again!\"Xiao Qiao stared at him for a long time. Then she suddenly covered her head and murmured: \"I can't remember. My head hurts so much...\"\"Okay, okay, don't think about it if you can't remember.\" Fang Xiao Juan hugged Xiao Qiao worriedly and turned to Qiao Zhen Jun, \"Child's dad, you heard what the doctor said just now. Xiao Qiao's situation requires us, parents' attention. Since the child has an impression of you, it is better to let her go back to live with you for a while.\"Qiao Zhen Jun frowned again.Fang Xiao Juan was angry when she saw his hesitant reaction. Still, she had to hold back her anger: \"I don't want Xiao Qiao to live with you forever. Isn't this a special situation? Once she is a little better, I will immediately bring her back.\"Qiao Zhen Jun still didn't give the go ahead.If he didn't know that Xiao Qiao lied and tricked Da Qiao into West Wood before, he would definitely agree. But now... he really didn't know whether he should nod his head.Fang Xiao Juan was so furious that she gritted her teeth. Suddenly, she hugged Xiao Qiao and cried: \"My poor child, you are like this and your dad doesn't care about you. Jiao Jiao, don't worry, no matter what you become, your mom doesn't mind. I won't leave you behind!\"When the people around heard Fang Xiao Juan's words, their gaze toward Qiao Zhen Jun immediately carried a blade.\"Only birth and not raise. Worst than a dog! Pah!\" The old lady on the next bed spat at him.\"That's right. Judging by how decent he look, how can he be so irresponsible? Even if he dislike daughters, he can't be like this!\"\"If this kind of man is my son-in-law, I have to beat him to death with a broom!\"Qiao Zhen Jun became the target of public criticism. His face instantly flushed: \"I'm not...\"\"Don't scold Child's Dad. There is a reason for him being on the spot. I and Child's Dad got divorced. He has a newly married-in wife. He must have asked his wife about this matter.\"Fang Xiao Juan's eyes showed a glimmer of pride. She really wanted to please Qiao Zhen Jun this time. So this wasn't the opportunity to stir trouble. She spoke for him instead.When everyone heard this, they immediately sympathized with her even more.Under everyone's knife-like eyes, Qiao Zhen Jun didn't agree to let Xiao Qiao go back. Just changed his speech and said that he would go back and discuss it with Lin Hui.Fang Xiao Juan cursed in her heart. Still, on the surface, she appeared virtuous.Because Xiao Qiao's wound wasn't serious, the doctor said that there was no need to stay in hospital. He paid the fee and she was discharged immediately.Back at the production team, the villagers saw the family of three coming back and immediately surrounded them.\"Hey, why did Xiao Qiao get out of the hospital so quickly?\"\"Yes, the blood looked so terrifying at the time. I thought it was going to be bad!\"At that time, when Xiao Qiao was found in the West Wood, there was a lot of blood on her body and her clothes were dyed red. At that time, everyone thought she was dead.Seeing so many people, Xiao Qiao hid behind her dad with a white face. As if she was terrified.Usually, when Xiao Qiao saw people in the village, she would take the initiative to greet them. She was very well-behaved and sweet. Everyone can't help but be even more curious when they saw her coward away now.Qiao Zhen Jun had no choice but to explain: \"The doctor said that Xiao Qiao's brain was congested. She can't remember anyone.\"When everyone heard that Xiao Qiao lost her memory, some were sympathetic, some were curious, and some were watching the drama.\"To hurt her brain at a young age! What if she can't remember anything in the future?\"\"Can't remember? Doesn't that mean she become a fool? Like the fool from the next village?\"\"Tsk tsk tsk, what a pity that such a good child prodigy has become like this!\"Qiao Zhen Jun didn't want Xiao Qiao to hear these nonsense. So he turned to her and said, \"You follow your mom back. I'll see you when I'm free.\"Xiao Qiao was even more afraid and held his hand tightly: \"Dad, are you really going to see me? I'm so scared...\"Her little face was pale. Her big eyes were full of fear and anxiety. Like a lost animal, weak and helpless.Qiao Zhen Jun felt a pain in his heart. He rubbed her head and assured, \"Yes, Dad will see you when I'm free.\"Xiao Qiao reluctantly let go of his hand then.Qiao Zhen Jun took a few steps and saw Lin Hui standing under the tree in front of him with red eyes. His pupils shrank and he guiltily called, \"Hui Hui!\"Lin Hui was able to hold back just now. Now she hear him call her nickname, her nose soured and tears almost spilled down.When she saw them family of three standing together, the scene deeply stabbed her in the eyes.Seeing Lin Hui turn around and leave, Qiao Zhen Jun quickly chased after her: \"Hui Hui, don't run so fast. Be careful of the baby in your belly!\"Seeing that he only cared about baby, Lin Hui felt even more aggrieved. She ran as she supported her belly.Qiao Zhen Jun was so frightened that his heart almost jumped out!Seeing the two of them like this, everyone started to talk more and more.\"Old Second Qiao's wife must be upset to see her man standing with Fang Xiao Juan!\"\"If it were me, I wouldn't be happy either!\"Fang Xiao Juan was old Second Qiao's ex-wife. The two have lived together for so many years. Now Fang Xiao Juan was a widow again. Who knows if they will rekindle something?Seeing Lin Hui crying and running away, Fang Xiao Juan felt better than drinking a bowl of mung bean soup on blazing hot days!Look, this was the beginning!She will definitely take Qiao Zhen Jun back!...Lin Hui couldn't run fast with her big belly. Soon, Qiao Zhen Jun caught up: \"Let me go! Why don't you go to your ex-wife and daughter. Why are you chasing me?\"Qiao Zhen Jun grabbed her hand and explained, \"Hui Hui, I... I have nothing to do with Fang Xiao Juan!\"Lin Hui pursed her lips and didn't speak. Nor did she look at him.Qiao Zhen Jun's face flushed with anxiety: \"Hui Hui, what I said is true! How could I possibly be with her!\"Qiao Zhen Jun had always clumsy with his speech. His explanation were only those two sentences.Lin Hui saw that he was sweating profusely, she couldn't bear it any longer. She bit her lip and asked him, \"What's the matter with Xiao Qiao?\"She stood far away just now and didn't hear what they said. Just by Xiao Qiao's timid expression, it was completely different from before.Qiao Zhen Jun repeated the doctor's words again.After Lin Hui heard this, she snorted coldly from her nose: \"Need family's care? So, are you going to bring her home?\"Under her watery gaze, how could Qiao Zhen Jun possibly dare to nod his head. But thinking of Xiao Qiao's situation, he felt that it would be irresponsible to do nothing. He couldn't help but be in a dilemma.Lin Hui understood his character. She turned around and said, \"I won't tell you off either. You'd better tell Dad and Mom about this!\"After she finished speaking, she turned away without looking at him.Qiao Zhen Jun could only follow after her again.In the evening, Qiao Xiu Zhi called them all to the old house for dinner.After eating, Qiao Xiu Zhi went straight in, \"Your second branch had already separated out. Your dad and I can't intervene in your affairs. So you decide whether you want to bring Xiao Qiao back! To not hurt Da Qiao again, your dad and I decided to bring Da Qiao back to the old house!\"After she finished speaking, she turned around and asked Da Qiao, who was sitting beside her, \"Would you like to come back and live with your grandfather and grandmother?\"Da Qiao glanced at her mom with some reluctance, and finally nodded: \"I would.\"The cold sweat on Qiao Zhen Jun's forehead instantly flowed down: \"Mom, I didn't promise to take Xiao Qiao back!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi raised her eyebrows: \"You didn't now. What about in the future? If Xiao Qiao is crying and begging you, can you guarantee that you won't agree?\"Qiao Zhen Jun: \"...I...\"It was just that before he finished speaking, he heard Lin Hui speak, \"Dad, Mom, if I can, I also want to move back to the old house.\"Qiao Zhen Jun's eyes widened. He looked back at her nervously and said, \"Hui Hui, don't say it out of anger. We are husband and wife. How can I let you go back to the old house alone?\"But Lin Hui didn't even look at him. Treated him like a fart with an expression of disgust.Qiao Zhen Jun took a critical hit: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded: \"Yes, then you can move in with little Dong Lin. If the old house can't accommodated you, we will buy a homestead from the production team and build one.\"When Qiao Zhen Jun heard his mom's words, he became even more anxious. But before he could respond, he heard Qiao Hong Xia say...\"Mom, I also want to bring little Yi Ming back to live. Let Second Elder Brother and his family live in the small house!\"Qiao Zhen Jun almost knelt down. With a flush face, he directed to Qiao Hong Xia: \"Third Younger Sister, don't make trouble for me at this time!\"Qiao Hong Xia uttered: \"Second Elder Brother, I'm not making trouble! Your ears are too soft. Once Xiao Qiao and her mom beg you, you can't promise to not let Xiao Qiao come back. Once Xiao Qiao comes back, would Fang Xiao Juan's return be far? Since it's like this, we might as well make room for them earlier. So that you family of three can have a good reunion!\"Qiao Zhen Jun: \"...\"Da Qiao stretched out her paws and said softly, \"Grandmother, I want to take Gu Gu along with me.\"Since they were all leaving, Gu Gu definitely couldn't stay there and be bullied.Qiao Xiu Zhi rubbed her head, \"Okay, take them all away. This matter is settled. You go back first. Tomorrow I will get Eldest to carry things for you!\"If Qiao Zhen Jun doesn't speak out now, his wife, children, and even the old hen at home will be lost!He hurriedly shouted: \"Mom! I really didn't want to bring Xiao Qiao back. But I think that as the child's dad, I have to do something. Such as giving the child more money to nourish her body. .\"Qiao Xiu Zhi raised her eyebrows and stared at him: \"If Fang Xiao Juan used this as an excuse to get you visit Xiao Qiao often, would you go or not?\"Qiao Zhen Jun shook his head like a rattle and said with a strong desire to survive: \"Won't go! I won't go even if I have to break my leg! If I have to go, I'll get Eldest Brother or Third Younger Sister to go with me. I'll definitely not go alone!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi said: \"This is what you said. If you can't do it, you can't blame anyone for separating you from your wife and children in the future! Old Second's wife, give him a chance for the time being. If he can't do it, you can always move back!\"Qiao Zhen Jun eyed Lin Hui nervously, fearing that she would say \"no\".Lin Hui lowered her head and pretended to consider for a while. Only then, she reluctantly nodded and said, \"Okay, since Mom said so, I'll give him a chance. But there's only one chance. If you can't do it, I'll divorce you!\"She didn't really want to move to the old house.Not to mention that there weren't enough rooms in the old courtyard, the two sister-in-laws weren't easy to get along with. Definitely not as comfortable as living in a small courtyard.When Qiao Zhen Jun heard her mention the divorce at will, he frowned and stated, \"Hui Hui, don't say that. It makes me sad!\"Lin Hui coldly snorted.Feeling hurt is right!She purposely wanted to make him feel bad!Da Qiao looked at her dad, and then at her mom. She took out a white rabbit toffee from her pocket, peeled off the paper and handed it over: \"Mom, eat candy. You'll be happy when you eat candy!\"Lin Hui rubbed her hair and gently spoke, \"Mom won't eat it. You can eat it.\"Da Qiao insisted on stuffing the milk candy into her mom's mouth and softly stated, \"Mom, don't worry. If you divorce Dad, I'll go with you.\"Qiao Zhen Jun grimaced: \"...\"At this moment, he felt as if he had become a piece of poo. Receiving neglect and disgust from the whole family!Qiao Hong Xia looked at her second elder brother's bitter face and almost couldn't hold back her laughter.In order to restore his status, Qiao Zhen Jun couldn't wait to tell Fang Xiao Juan the result of the discussion the next day.Fang Xiao Juan couldn't bear it any longer. She exploded on the spot: \"Qiao Zhen Jun, you rubbish! I used to think you were useless, but didn't expect that you're not just useless now, but also have no sense of responsibility!\"Qiao Zhen Jun's face flushed red.Qiao Hong Xia gave her a \"pah\": \"If you think my second elder brother is useless, why do you want to go back to our Qiao Family?\"Fang Xiao Juan's face flashed red and white with anger: \"When did I want to go back to Qiao Family? You broken shoe, if you talk nonsense again, see if I won't tear your mouth!\"Qiao Hong Xia sneered: \"I'm a broken shoe, so what are you then? A broken shoe that stinks? My second elder brother said that he would buy Xiao Qiao meat three times and ten eggs every time. If this many things are called irresponsible, then we won't give it. Anyway, we can't bear this false name in vain!\"After their discussion last night, they decided to buy Xiao Qiao some food to send over every month.Moreover, sending so many things every month can also stop the mouths of those gossipers in the production team!This was also the reason why Fang Xiao Juan was furious!Not only did Qiao Zhen Jun not accept Xiao Qiao back, but also didn't give her the slightest benefit. How can she not be angry?Fang Xiao Juan glared at Qiao Hong Xia. Her eyes were red with anger. She couldn't wait to pounce on her and tear her apart!Qiao Zhen Jun and Qiao Hong Xia didn't want to talk to her, so they left.Fang Xiao Juan was so vexed that when she returned home, she slapped Xiao Qiao in the face: \"You useless trash! Didn't you say that Qiao Zhen Jun would definitely take you back this time?\"Xiao Qiao was almost flew from her slap. A slap print appeared on her face. Glaring at her, Xiao Qiao said, \"Mom, don't go too far!\"On the day she came back from the hospital, her mom had a card revealing session with her.Both of them knew the other was reborn. They agreed on the aim of going back to Qiao's house. So they soon reached a cooperative relationship.It was something that was supposed to be guaranteed. But for some reason, something cropped up with her dad!It must be that old witch, Qiao Xiu Zhi's doing!Fang Xiao Juan also thought of Qiao Xiu Zhi and hated her to death.After the two discussed it, they decided to take action with Lin Hui. Since they can't get what they want, then\u00a0kill the fish and break the net!But before they could figure out a way to do it, the town's postman rode a bicycle to the production team and brought a letter to Fang Xiao Juan.After reading the letter, Fang Xiao Juan immediately came to life.She can be seen with her cheeks flushed with rosiness and affection at the corners of her eyes. She held the letter to her chest and happily twirled in circle.Seeing her mom like this, Xiao Qiao leaned over curiously and asked, \"Mom, who sent you the letter?\"Fang Xiao Juan handed the letter over and answered, \"It's...\"As night fell, the night bug was playing a nocturnal song. Wang Yan Sheng glanced around before jumping into the pigpen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73The pigsty was dark. The fat pigs hummed from time to time. There was a little candlelight in the room next to the pigsty.Wang Yan Sheng strode towards the room.Huo Hua Qing was sitting in the main room. From time to time, he looked outside. His wrinkled face was full of strain and exhaustion under the weak candlelight.Suddenly, there was a slight sound of footsteps outside. He clenched his fists and stood up at the sight of a tall man appearing at the door.He looked at the other party and uttered, \"The country is broken, mountains and rivers still exist.\"Wang Yan Sheng replied, \"The river flows into the ocean.\"Huo Hua Qing was relieved when he heard him match his code. He turned around and blew out the oil lamp: \"Come in and sit.\"Wang Yan Sheng walked in, bowed deeply to him, and said, \"Hello, Mr. Huo. My name is Wang Yan Sheng. I am a subordinate of Commander Jiang. Now I am the regiment leader!\"When Huo Hua Qing heard the name Commander Jiang, a concerned look appeared on his face: \"Is Guo Hai okay?\"Wang Yan Sheng walked to the opposite seat and sat down. He nodded: \"Commander Jiang is doing fine. He just misses you very much. This time he asked me to come and visit you!\"Huo Hua Qing sighed in his heart: \"It's good that he's doing well. Tell him don't miss me. Now that with my status, it will only drag him down if he contacts me again!\"Wang Yan Sheng said, \"Don't talk like that. Commander Jiang hasn't given up fighting for you all these years, but the current situation is still unstable. Although he is a commander, there are still many things that he cannot do.\"Huo Hua Qing repeatedly nodded: \"I understand. Don't worry. Tell him never expose his traces!\"Huo Family had been wealthy for generations. In the Republic of China, he was even more prosperous because of the establishment of factories. He was a well-known big capitalist at that time.It was just that Huo Family had never done anything sorry to the country or its people. They had even spent their money to support the army during the war.His only son was also killed while transporting military supplies. Even his corpse couldn't be found!Even so, their Huo Family was accused and got labelled as wicked people. They were sent to the farm to reform through labor!It was enough for him to suffer. But his family was also incriminated to suffer with him. How can he not be resentful?Of course, compared with other capitalists who have lost their lives, it was already a great fortune for them three to be still alive!The people he sponsored back then had been secretly helping them over the years.The fact that they were able to come to the Qili production team from the farm wasn't due to their luck. In fact, most of the wicked people on the farm weren't bad people. If it wasn\u2019t for someone operating in the dark, it would definitely not be their family\u2019s turn to come out that time.They had been in the Qili production team for a few months. Although they lived next to the pigsty, have to raise pigs, and clean up dung every day, but these were really nothing compared to the farm!In addition, most of the people in the Qili production team were relatively kind, especially Qiao Family, who often help them. This life was completely unimaginable for them before!Wang Yan Sheng spoke: \"Don't worry, Mr. Huo. I will definitely bring the message back to Commander Jiang! By the way, Mr. Huo is an expert in planting Chinese herbal medicines. I wonder if letting you plant would be a problem with you now?\"Huo Hua Qing was stunned for a moment. Then he nodded and answered, \"Although so many years have passed, I have never forgotten the knowledge of planting. But why are you asking this?\"If it weren't for the conditions, he would like to record all the knowledge about planting for future generations.Wang Yan Sheng explained, \"During this return, I plan to ask my eldest brother, the production leader of this village, to persuade the villagers to change their private plots to growing Chinese herbal medicine. Then I will recommend your family and get you to give guidance to the villagers.\"Although there was no way to get rid of their wicked people identity for a while, their status in the production team will be greatly improved this way. Once the planting is successful, they will be more respected by the villagers.Huo Hua Qing's turbulent eyes lit up. He excitedly reacted: \"Is this possible? Will your eldest brother agree? Will the villagers be willing?\"Wang Yan Sheng frowned, \"I'm certain I can convince my eldest brother. But the villagers, it can only rely on fate. Everything is difficult at the beginning. Even it's it justy one or two families are willing to plant Chinese herbal medicine at the beginning. But once they smell the advantage, they won't need us to persuade them next year. They will sign up voluntarily!\"Of course, changing all the private plots to planting Chinese herbal medicines wasn't his real purpose. After all, each family had only 50 square meters of private plots. Even if the entire production team's private plots were planted, it won't have much effect.What he wanted was to change more than half of the land of the entire production team to grow Chinese herbal medicine. As long as growing Chinese herbal medicine is more profitable than growing food, he wasn't afraid that the community won't agree.Huo Hua Qing was a big capitalist back then. Of course he understood the value of Chinese herbal medicine. If they can be successfully planted, their family will be able to make it through!In the future, even if he and his daughter-in-law pass away, Chi'er will still be able to survive in the production team!He grabbed the edge of the table with a pair of rough and cracked hands. His eyes were red with anticipation.When Wang Yan Sheng came out of the pigsty and passed by Qiao's small house, he couldn't help but glanced inside.Who knew Pi Pi sniffed the smell of strangers and immediately barked vigilantly. In such a night, Pi Pi's voice was so loud and imposing. It suddenly woke up Qiao Family.Candles were lit in Qiao's house. There was the sound of door opening.Wang Yan Sheng was about to slip away, but after seeing the slender figure walking out from inside, he put back his raised foot.Qiao Hong Xia came out with a flashlight and asked, \"Who is outside?\"Wang Yan Sheng answered, \"It's me, Wang Yan Sheng.\"His voice was deep and mellow. It was hard to forget after hearing it once.When Qiao Hong Xia heard that it was him, she couldn't help but be stunned for a moment. She walked to the door and said, \"Third Elder Brother Wang, it's so late. Why are you here?\"Using the light, Wang Yan Sheng's eyes scanned her face and replied, \"I just came back from town and was barked at by your dog when I passed by. This should be the legendary phrase, detestable people get hated by dogs, right?\"He wanted to say something witty to stimulate the atmosphere. Since he was serious and dignified, it wasn't funny at all. Instead, Qiao Hong Xia didn't know how to respond.The atmosphere seemed more awkward.Wang Yan Sheng pressed his tongue against his back molars as he scolded himself inwardly. He coughed, \"It's getting late, so I won't disturb your, rest.\"Qiao Hong Xia hurriedly nodded: \"Okay, you go.\"After she finished speaking, she felt she gave the vibe of couldn't wait to drive the other person away. After thinking about it, she added: \"I'll show you a section of the road with the flashlight.\"Wang Yan Sheng originally wanted to refuse. He was used to walking at night, but when the words came to his mouth, he swallowed it back: \"Okay, then I will trouble you.\"\"No trouble.\"Wang Yan Sheng glanced at her again before turning and strode away.When he reached the end of the light from the flashlight, he suddenly turned around and waved at her with a smile: \"Go in. I'll watch you go in before leaving.\"Qiao Hong Xia looked at the smile on the corner of his mouth. Her heartbeat suddenly lost its rhythm for a moment. It wildly beated.Her face became hot. She turned and ran away without saying a word.Wang Yan Sheng watched her \"depart without a word of farewell\". Deep doubts flashed in his eyes. After thinking about it, he couldn't understand what he said just now that she didn't like.After standing for a long time, he shivered a bit when the night wind blew over. Only then, he turned around and walked towards Wang's house....The next day, Da Qiao stared at her third aunt and asked curiously, \"Third Aunt, why do you have dark circles under your eyes too?\"Eldest Aunt got dark circles because she had to get up in the middle of the night to breastfeed. Fifth Aunt had dark circles because she had to study nursing. So what was the reason for Third Aunt?Qiao Hong Xia's face went hot. She responded with a guilty conscience, \"Third Aunt didn't rest well last night. Did you have breakfast?\"Da Qiao nodded obediently: \"I have eaten. I heard from Mom that Pi Pi woke everyone up last night., I will go and reason with him in a while!\"Seeing how cute she was, Qiao Hong Xia couldn't help reaching out and rub her hair. Then she took out two big white rabbit toffees from her pocket and said, \"Take it.\"Da Qiao smiled with curved eyes: \"Thank you Third Aunt. Then I won't be polite.\"When Qiao Hong Xia heard her little adult's tone, she couldn't help laughing.Da Qiao didn't eat the white rabbit candy. Instead, she turned around and gave it to her mom.She heard from Godmother that seven white rabbit candies were equal to a cup of milk. It was good for the body. So she always stuffed her mom with candies during this period.When Qiao Hong Xia saw that Da Qiao was finally sent away, she sighed in relief while covering her chest with her hands.After she went back to the room last night, for some unknown reason, she always recalled Wang Yan Sheng smiling at her.The more she forced herself not to think about it, the clearer the picture in her mind became. She tossed and turned on the bed for a long time without falling asleep. That's why she have dark circles when she woke up the next day.In the room, Lin Hui was helping Qiao Zhen Jun tidy up his clothes. She spoke in a gentle voice, \"Shen Family had made great efforts to help us with this job. Mom took out two pieces of century-old ganoderma lucidum. Take them to Shen Family when you have time.\"Some people's body will become swollen and their skin will become ugly after pregnancy. However, Lin Hui looked even better after pregnancy. Her face was ruddy, while her complexion was fair and smooth. Except for her belly, her limbs were still slender. Not the slightest sign of bloatness.\"Okay, I'll bring it over when I'm free.\"Qiao Zhen Jun stared at his wife's stunning face. His heart itched. He couldn't help but leaned in and kissed her face: \"Hui Hui, you are so beautiful.\"Lin Hui's face flushed red. She reached out and swatted his chest, \"What are you doing! It would be embarrassing to be seen by the children in broad daylight!\"Qiao Zhen Jun grabbed her hand and kissed again: \"The children are still sleeping...\"Before he could finish speaking, Da Qiao rushed in. Seeing this scene, she hurriedly covered her face with her paws and turned around, \"Mom, Dad, I didn't see anything!\"Qiao Zhen Jun and Lin Hui's faces were as red as boiled shrimp.Little Dong Lin swung his short legs and ran over: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, what did you not see?\"Da Qiao whispered: \"Dad was kissing Mom's hand, but I didn't see anything. You can't say that you saw it, understand?\"Doubt was in Dong Lin's small eyes. Still, he obediently nodded and replied in his baby voice, \"I see. I didn't see Dad kissing Mom's hand!\"Qiao Zhen Jun and Lin Hui: \"...\"Lin Hui's face was so hot that she could fry an egg. She secretly pinched Qiao Zhenjun.Qiao Zhen Jun gasped in pain. His heart felt sweet though. He would still kiss her next time!Today was the day when Qiao Zhen Jun went to the food factory to report for duty. At the same time, Qiao Zhen Min was also leaving to go back to the county city to work.Qiao Zhen Jun went to work in the town, but he was only a temporary worker. So his household registration was still at the production team. He didn't go to work in the field, so he naturally had to ask the production team leader for leave.With this leave, the news news couldn't be concealed. Everyone was envious!\"Oh, Qiao Family is really prospering. The family has two employees. I really envy!\"\"Oh, at this rate, Wang Family will definitely be overtaken!\"\"Old Second Qiao, was your job introduced to you by the deputy chief? Is there any way to introduce me?\"\"Yes, yes. We are from the same production team, you can't hide it!\"\"Old Second Qiao, my eldest son is very strong. He can do anything, even if it's tiring and dirty. Could you recommend him a job?\"The villagers surrounded Qiao Zhen Jun, latched onto him, and asked him to introduce their family to employment.Qiao Zhen Jun's face flushed. He explained, \"I'm just a farmer. How can I introduce you to work?\"The villagers were displeased with this response. He couldn't do anything, but the deputy chief could!Seeing his second elder brother like this, Qiao Zhen Min had no choice but to help: \"You can go if you want. A temporary worker employment is 800 yuan. As long as you give the money, I will introduce you to one!\"Eight hundred yuan!My goodness!Not to mention that the fact that many people in the production team can't come up with this much money, even if they can, who would want to!Temporary workers were generally paid between 15 yuan and 20 yuan. It takes at least three years to repay the principal cost. The problem was that most people have more than one son in the family. After the money is given, who should the job be given to?No matter which son it is given, the other sons will definitely not be happy. There will inevitably be family conflicts at that time!So when this came out, everyone rest their thoughts.Of course, some people felt even more uncomfortable. Such as Xing Hua, who once wanted to marry Qiao Zhen Min.Xing Hua eyed Qiao Zhen Min from a distance in the crowd. Felt that he stood out more and more. People couldn't take their eyes off him.She squeezed the tool in her hand tightly as hated boiled within. If Qiao Xiu Zhi hadn't stopped her, she would have been Qiao Zhen Min's wife!After Qiao Zhen Min left, Xing Hua was in a bad mood all morning. So she went to Fang Xiao Juan's thatched hut after work.\"Xiao Juan, old Second Qiao is going to be a worker in the town. Do you know this?\"She was in a bad mood and wanted someone to accompany her. That's why she told Fang Xiao Juan the news.Xing Hua thought that Fang Xiao Juan would definitely grit her teeth in anger and vent out when she heard this.Unexpectedly, Fang Xiao Juan was only slightly startled. She shrugged and said indifferently, \"What does it got to do with me whether he's a worker or not. I have nothing to do with him 800 years ago!\"Xing Hua froze on the spot!This light-hearted Fang Xiao Juan wasn't like Fang Xiao Juan at all!\"Xiao Juan, are you really not angry?\" She eyed her suspiciously. Desperately trying to see something from her face.Fang Xiao Juan smiled, \"Why should I be angry? Do you think that I can't live a good life now I left Qiao Zhen Jun,?\"Xing Hua was dead curious. So she leaned over and asked, \"Xiao Juan, tell me honestly, did something good happen to you?\"Fang Xiao Juan smiled like she was flying on spring breeze. Stretching out her hand and brush the hair that fell from her forehead behind her ear, she responded, \"I can't tell you right now. You'll know soon!\"Yesterday, she received a letter from Meng Hong Guang, saying that he never forgot her for a moment after he went back. He also said that he would come to the town to do business in ten days. She should go to town to meet him!Meng Hong Guang was the first man she fell in love with.He was taller than the average educated youth. Had a handsome face with a heroic aura. Among so many educated youths back then, she took a fancy to him at fist sight.After that, she tried her best to get close to him and tried her best to gain his favor. The two were on fire a while. He had promised that once he had a way to go back to the city, he would definitely take her away!Who knew that after he left, there was no news at all. At that time, she became the joke of the production team. In order to get herself married, she schemed on Qiao Zhen Jun.The person who she originally thought she would never meet again in her life suddenly sent her a letter seven years later. What's more, it was during her most embarrassing and miserable state. She vowed to grasped this person and get him take her back to the city !As long as she becomes a city dweller, what did Qiao Zhen Jun, a town worker count as?Xing Hua was itching with curiosity at the sight of Fang Xiao Juan's peach blossom expression. But no matter how she asked, Fang Xiao Juan didn't give it away. So she rolled her eyes and walked away.In addition to Xing Hua, another person was Chen Qiao Qiao.This time Qiao Zhen Min came back for a total of ten days. The couple only shared the bed once!It wasn't that Qiao Zhen Min didn't want to fulfill the job, but because that aspect was really not good. That one time ended hastily. It made her very dissatisfied.Originally, it was more together and less apart. When will she be able to conceive a child if this goes on?But she couldn't tell other people about her troubles. Nor could she let others see a hint of it!Tian Jian Ming took out a packet of cloud cake from the drawer and handed it over, \"Come, eat a cloud cake.\"Chen Qiao Qiao shook her head: \"Thank you, Doctor Tian, but I have no appetite.\"Tian Jian Ming took out a slice of cloud cake and hooked his lips: \"You eat it yourself, or do you want me to feed you?\"Chen Qiao Qiao's face turned red with a 'swoosh'. She stammered, \"Doctor Tian, you, don't say such things. It would be bad if others heard!\"They were lone male and lone female in the health center, so they had to have some distance from the beginning. Fortunately, there were always people coming to the health center and everyone didn\u2019t dare to offend the doctor. That's why no one dared to say any nonsense.But what if his words were accidentally overheard? They wouldn't be able to wash it out even if they jumped into the Yellow River!Tian Jian Ming curled his lips at her and said, \"You are so timid to the point of being cute! I'm joking with you! I noticed you look gloomy all day, so I want to tease you!\"When Chen Qiao Qiao heard what his explanation, she breathed a sigh of relief. At the same time, there was warmth pulsing in her heart.Tian Jian Ming handed over the cloud cake again: \"Eat a slice. Don't frown all the time. When a beauty frowns, it's easy to make people feel distressed!\"Chen Qiao Qiao met his gaze. Her heart skipped a beat like the last time. Afterward, it started beating wildly.Tian Jian Ming saw her staring straight at him. His mirth became even deeper: \"Please hold it. My hands are getting sore!\"Chen Qiao Qiao came back to her senses and blushed even more. She reached out to take the cloud cake in his hand.The two's fingertips accidentally touched. Her heart instantly beat faster. Her hand trembled and she almost dropped the cloud cake to the ground!Tian Jian Ming pretended not to see her panic. He spoke in a relaxed but caring tone: \"Did you encounter any difficulties? We are comrades who work and study together. If there are any difficulties, you must tell me!\"Chen Qiao Qiao saw how he cared so much about herself, her mood became very complicated. There were joys, fears, unspeakable grievances, and a hint of sweetness.She lowered her head. With a purse of her lips, she answered, \"Thank you, Doctor Tian, but I'm fine.\"Tian Jian Ming's forehead frowned. Soon, it quickly relaxed again: \"It's fine. But if something happens, you must tell me. I will always stand by your side to support you!\"The cloud cake in Chen Qiao Qiao's hand was almost crushed. She bit her lip and uttered, \"Okay.\"...Ever since the production team discovered the hole in West Wood, the villagers had been thinking about going in to pick fruits and catch fish every day.It was just that Wang Shui Sheng was afraid that everyone would snatch and fight. He got someone to blocked the entrance early in the morning. After that, he stated he'll organized everyone to go in after the farming rush. The things that are picked will be divided equally according to work points.Everyone also felt that the division was fair. So they all raised their hands and agreed.Today was the day to go to West Wood to pick fruits and catch fish. The entire production team was excited. Smiles were on everyone's faces.Wang Shui Sheng selected ten young men to go fishing at the waterfall. While ten men and twenty women to pick fruit. The children were assigned to picking wild vegetables.The wild vegetables didn't need to be handed over to the public. So every household sent someone over.Except for little Dong Yun, who only knew to eat and sleep, everyone including little Wan'er was dispatched. Xiao Qiao was forced to go by Fang Xiao Juan.It was unknown whether\u00a0the ape dung was too thick. Soon after entering, Qiao Family bumped into lonely Xiao Qiao who was carrying a basket.Qiao Dong He looked at Xiao Qiao and asked her younger sister in a hushed voice, \"Dong Ying, do you really think she doesn't remember anything?\"Qiao Dong Ying laughed: \"I don't know if she really doesn't remember. Anyway, I don't believe it!\"She had never seen a child with more scheming heart than Xiao Qiao. Even many adults can't match her!Xiao Qiao hesitantly walked over. She bit her lip and looked at Da Qiao: \"I heard that you and I are twin sisters. Is this true? Why do I feel that I don't look like you?\"When they were first born, the two sisters, Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao, looked quite similar. But the older they grew, the less they looked alike. Especially after Da Qiao consumed the jade beads. The difference became even greater.Da Qiao nodded and replied, \"It's true. Grandmother said that many twins don't look alike. It's nothing surprising.\"\"It turned out to be like this.\" Xiao Qiao instantly looked enlightened. Then she feebly said, \"Elder Sister, can I pick wild vegetables with you?\"This time Da Qiao didn't answer.She knew Younger Sister from the past had bad intentions towards her. Now that the other party didn't remember anything, she suddenly didn't know how to interact with her.At this moment, Huo Chi ran over and called, \"Qiao Nian Nian, your grandmother told you to come over!\"Since Huo Chi brought everyone into West Wood, the people in the production team have treated him much better. Although they still didn't let their children play with him, they no longer restrict him from walking around the village.When Da Qiao heard his words, her eyes lit up at once. She replied softly: \"I know, I'll go right now!\"After speaking, she left the crowd and ran off.After Da Qiao left, Qiao Dong Ying didn't want to pay attention to Xiao Qiao at all. She led her elder sister and little Wan'er away without saying a word to her from beginning to end.Soon, there was no one around Xiao Qiao.She stood alone clutching the basket. Looking pitiful.When the other children saw it, they came over and asked her to pick wild vegetables with them. Later, when they got back, they told the adults about it.Everyone remarked how Qiao siblings were too indifferent and cruel. Especially Da Qiao, the biological sister. Simply no sisterly feeling at all!Of course this was another story.Da Qiao ran out not far before she was pulled by Huo Chi: \"Come here.\"Da Qiao walked over and looked up, \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, actually my grandmother didn't call for me to go over, right?\"Huo Chi looked at her fair and tender face. Unable to resist the urge, he pinched her, \"You're smart! I called you here because I wanted to tell you that I suspect your younger sister is pretending to have amnesia!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDa Qiao's deep black eyes widened: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, why do you say that? Did you discover something?\"Seeing that she didn't get angry when her face being pinched by him, Huo Chi was helpless at her good temper.He let go her face and answered, \"En, I found a pile of chicken feathers and chicken bones on the slope where your sister fainted. Those things are still fresh. It should have been buried in the past few days!\"Da Qiao's eyes widened: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, can you show me it now?\"Huo Chi nodded and glanced around. Seeing that no one around, he took her into the thickets.The place where the chicken bones and feathers were buried was in the bushes less than two meters away from Xiao Qiao's fainting spot.\"Elder Brother Huo Chi, how do you know there are chicken bones and feathers buried here?\"Da Qiao squatted down and carefully identified the chicken feathers. It was really fresh. Not like it had been buried for a long time. No one had come in this part of West Wood before. So there was no third party except Xiao Qiao.Huo Chi shook his head: \"I didn't know something was buried here. But your younger sister had bleed a lot that day. At the time, my mom said that she probably couldn't survive. Unexpectedly, after one night, she came back with nothing. It's weird!\"At that time, Xiao Qiao was covered in blood when she was found. The ground was also stained red with blood. If she really had shed so much blood, she would have died of blood loss long ago. Even if she survived by luck, she should be discharged from the hospital so fast. Or appeared to be full of vitality.There must be something up here!So he sneaked into West Wood to find evidence while the villagers went to work. And he found it!Da Qiao tilted her head and pondered for a moment. Then she softly spoke, \"You mean the blood on Young Sister's body...is chicken blood?\"Huo Chi nodded: \"There is no other way to explain her situation!\"At that time, Xiao Qiao must have rolled down the slope and hit her brain. Only a bit of blood spilled out. The situation shouldn't be serious. In order to pretend to lose her memory, she caught a wild chicken, killed it, and got its blood on herself. Like this, it seem serious and can deceive everyone.That day, everyone was frightened when they saw how much blood she bleed. They didn't know whether the blood on her body was human blood or chicken blood. Later, everyone's attention was on her memory loss. Like this, the matter was muddled through.Da Qiao thought for a while. Her deep black eyes looked at him admiringly, \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, you are so amazing! I couldn't consider this!\"Huo Chi turned his face to the side and responded, \"I'm so-so.\"Da Qiao blinked her long eyelashes and curiously eyed at him, \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, why is your face red?\"Huo Chi's face became hot: \"... I've walked so far just now. I'm a little hot. By the way, what are you going to do next?\"Da Qiao witnessed his ears quickly turning red under the sun. She found it amusing: \"I want to tell my grandmother!\"Huo Chi approved of her approach. Da Qiao's grandmother was reasonable and domineering. She won't let Xiao Qiao's tricks succeed.The two buried the soil back before quietly running back to continue picking wild vegetables.The villagers were overjoyed at this side. So many fruits and fishes. Even the new year wasn't as bountiful!In addition to being happy, everyone sighed with regret. Why didn't they find out there was such an entrance earlier?The trap at the other entrance of West Wood was set up many years ago. At that time, there weren't so many mists in the mountains. Later, when there were more and more mists, no one dared to casually enter.This time it was really a bumper harvest. Every household was given at least two fish and ten jins of fruit. Everyone couldn't help swallowing when they looked at the plump grass carp.Huo Chi's family also got a share of one fish and two jins of fruit because of their merit in leading the way.Wang Shui Sheng specially instructed everyone not to spread it everywhere. If people from other production teams knew about it, maybe the things in this forest would be confiscated by the community in the future!Since it concerned their own interests, naturally no one would object. They all patted their chests and promised that they would never say it.It was getting late. Wang Shui Sheng ordered the meeting to end and everyone hurriedly brought things home to cook!...Qiao Family got three fish. Two were used that night to make braised tofu fish.First, clean up the grass carps. Then, it was smashed into pieces. Once the oil was in the pan and was hot enough, the minced garlic and ginger go in. A scent came out. The diced fish got poured in and fried until it was slightly golden. Adjust the seasoning and add some rural pickled peppers and brined veg to stew together. Once it was almost stew enough, the rural old tofu were cut into it. Simmer for ten minutes and it was done.The grass carps raised under the waterfall was very tender. Without a hint of earthy taste. The tofu, which was embedded with flavor, was also very tasty. That night, Qiao Family almost swallowed their tongues.Wan Chun Ju downed four bowls of dry rice by herself. The fish was so tender that she almost shed tears. After she became pregnant, she couldn't eat meat. Now this strange problem was finally cured!Because she was still in confinement, she pushed the bowl to her daughters to wash after eating.She picked up little Dong Yun, who was beside her, to feed her: \"Mom's precious darling. Oh, how can you eat so much? Really Mom's precious!\"She looked at the daughter in her arms. Her face shone with the brilliance of motherly love. Qiao Zhen Guo, who walked in, trembled.His wife had been very abnormal recently!Wan Chun Ju was born in a family that favored sons over daughters. She herself was the same. When Qiao Dong He and Qiao Dong Ying were born, she had a dark face every day. She was worried that she wouldn't be able to give birth to a son in the future.This fourth child was another daughter. Everyone thought she would be displeased. Who knew that she was like a different person.She hugged her daughter every day and called her little precious darling. She sang how good-looking and smart she was. Or how she was the most beautiful child in the whole community. No matter whether little Dong Yun cried and pooped, she was patient. Simply almost catching up to the An Ping favoritism back then!Wasn't her current state abnormal?Qiao Zhen Guo asked, \"Wife, why have you been talking with your voice pinched recently? Do you feel any irritation?\"Wan Chun Ju blushed with anger: \"Qiao Zhen Guo, why can't you\u00a0spit out ivory from your dog's mouth\u00a0every day?\"Qiao Zhen Guo said: \"I don't have a dog's mouth. So of course I can't spit out ivory! And there is no ivory in the dog's mouth. Wife, don't talk nonsense in the future. It will make you look uneducated!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"From the start, she was uneducated!Wan Chun Ju took a deep breath and changed the subject: \"Zhen Guo, I gave little Dong Yun a nice name.\"She felt that the name Dong Yun wasn't good. She should use two words name like Da Qiao, so that she would look cute and be liked by Father-in-law and Mother-in-law!Qiao Zhen Guo laughed: \"Wife, you can't even recognize your own name. What good name can you come up with?\"Wanchun Ju thumped him hard: \"...Who said that one can't choose a good name when one is illiterate? I want to change our daughter's name to\u00a0Tian Tian. What do you think of this name? Isn't it nice?\"\"Hahaha...\" When Qiao Zhen Guo heard the name, he immediately laughed like a dog, \"Wife, you might as well call her\u00a0Da Niu!\"Although he didn't dislike that his little daughter' not-so-pretty look, it was a fact that she wasn't good-looking.The average baby was only ugly when it was first born. Wrinkled skin like an old man. But it grow and will become more beautiful in a few days. However, little Dong Yun was even more ugly after she grows.The more she grew, the more she looked like Wan Chun Ju. Her skin was naturally tanned. She got a flat nose and a big mouth. The name of such a little girl was Tian Tian? Simply have the same effect as naming a beauty\u00a0Da Zhuang or Gou Dan. Very discordant.Wan Chun Ju was so angry that her face turned red and white: \"Qiao Zhen Guo, this is your biological daughter. Does you conscience not hurt to talk about her like this as her dad?\"Qiao Zhen Guo reached out and\u00a0touched his chest. He confirmed, \"Yes, it doesn't hurt at all.\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...If you think Tian Tian doesn't sound good, call her Yun Yun, Qiao Yun Yun.\"Qiao Zhen Guo scratched his head and pointed out, \"Won't it be different from her two elder sisters?\"Wan Chun Ju said as a matter of course: \"Then Dong He and Dong Ying also change along. Change to Qiao He He and Qiao Ying Ying!\"The sisters, Qiao Dong He and Qiao Dong Ying walked in and happened to hear this. They immediately uttered in unison, \"I don't want!\"What bloody name was that!Qiao Ying Ying wasn't bad. But what the hell was Qiao He He?At the thought of her name changing to this, Qiao Dong He openly confronted her mom for the second time.Wan Chun Ju gritted her teeth angrily: \"Even if you don't want, you still have to! As a child, whatever name your parents give you, you have to use it. What place do you have to decide?\"Qiao Dong Ying rolled her eyes and retorted, \"Mom, if you are willing to change my name to\u00a0Wan Sha Zhu, I will allow you to change my name!\"Wan Chun Ju was so furious that her whole face turned red: \"You damn girl. You really infuriate me! Zhen Guo, you handle your two daughters!\"However, Qiao Zhen Guo laughed like a dog again: \"Hahaha, why don't you mother and daughters change names together?\"Wan Chun Ju exploded into puffer fish!While at the main room. Da Qiao told the adults about today's findings. Everyone was shocked when they heard it.They knew that Xiao Qiao had a scheming heart, but they didn't expect her it too be this deep!With a cold face, Qiao Xiu Zhi stated: \"We were also careless. To ignore such an important matter!\"Qiao Hong Xia was amazed: \"Say, how did that child grow? At this age, she knows how to use this kind of trick to scheme against everyone. If she grows up more, what will she be like?\"Lin Hui rubbed her belly and didn't speak. She was very glad that she hardened her heart to let her come back to Qiao's house before. Otherwise, with such a calamity living at home, how could she sleep peacefully?Seeing her mom's actions, Da Qiao clustered over. She lightly leaned on her belly and said softly, \"Younger brothers, I'm Elder Sister. Are you guys good today?\"Lin Hui's gazes went soft: \"They are very good. It must be because they have a good elder sister like you to set an example for them!\"When Da Qiao heard the words, her eyes brighten while her heart was full of pride.Qiao Hong Xia paused before speaking out, \"Dad, Mom, do you want to expose her in front of everyone?\"Xue Chuan pondered a moment. Then he shook his head, \"I don't think this is appropriate.\"Once it's explained like this, everyone may not believe it. After all, Xiao Qiao was only a seven-year-old child. Everyone will only think that they didn't want to raise Xiao Qiao and want to \"quickly take the killer move\".Second, he didn't want to force the dog into the poor alley. That child had so many scheme as well as having such distorted mentality. If she is forced to a desperate situation, it will be hard to guard against if she does something more extreme.Thirdly, no matter how bad she was, she still got the blood of Qiao Family. If something happen, it wasn't like they can kill her, right?Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded: \"Your dad is right. It's better to resolve this matter privately.\"The next day, Xiao Qiao was called to Qiao's old house....This was the first time Xiao Qiao stepped into Qiao's house since she and her mom left Qiao's house.Her heart trembled with anticipation.She thought her acting skills deceived everyone and made them finally accept her!Unexpectedly, as soon as she took a step into Qiao's old house, Qiao Xiu Zhi cut straight into her fake amnesia and the matter of using chicken blood as blood on herself. Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't allow her room to refute and announced Qiao Family's decision.\"Go back and tell your mom monthly meat and eggs is abolished. You will no longer be a child of our Qiao Family. You're not allowed to step into Qiao's house. Nor are you allowed to approach anyone in Qiao Family. Once you grow up, your dad will give you a dowry. Other than that, don't think about anything else!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi stared at her as she coldly uttered.The production team distributed grain every year based on the population-labor ratio 6:4. Xiao Qiao now had to study and can\u2019t work in the fields. So she can\u2019t earn food from the labor part.As for tuition fees, if Fang Xiao Juan really can't afford it, Qiao Family can help out until she graduate from elementary school. There will be no more after that.With so such sly mind, it was better to not let her read too many books!Xiao Qiao was trembling with anger!She thought that Qiao Family wanted her to come over to accept her in. Unexpectedly, it was to cut off relations with her!She squeezed her fingers hard to calm herself down. Her eyes reddened. Tears fell as she spoke, \"Grandmother, I don't know what you're talking about... I don't understand. My head hurts...\"\"Stop pretending!\" Qiao Hong Xia said with a look of contempt, \"We have found the chicken feathers and chicken bones you buried in West Wood. If you don't admit it, we can call everyone in the production team to examine it together. You lost so much blood that day and the doctor didn't say anything. I want to see what's going on!\"In fact, they were too hasty that day to the hospital. Qiao Zhen Jun didn't dare to check Xiao Qiao's wound at will. While the doctor didn't ask too much. He just assumed that the child fell on chicken blood and hit her head.Xiao Qiao was so vex that she was about to explode!Her fingers dug to the point her palm bleed. She bit her lip and didn't speak.The day she rolled down the slope and hit the back of her head, she did bleed. But not much. She woke up after an hour or two of unconsciousness.After that, she didn't dare to move around casually. She hid behind the rocks on the slope and waited for the dawn. What made her feel chilled was that no one came to look for her after she disappeared for a whole night!Later, she came up with an idea and felt that this was a good opportunity to survive. She could pretend to lose her memory and return to Qiao's house!A wild chicken happened to run by nearby. She caught the wild chicken, killed it and got the chicken blood spilled on her body and the ground. After lighting a fire, the chicken was grilled and eaten. Then all the chicken feathers and chicken bones were buried in the bushes.She thought she implemented it flawlessly. Unexpectedly, she was discovered so quickly!Seeing her biting her lip and not speaking, Qiao Xiu Zhi became more and more wary of her: \"Go back. Remember what I said and don't make trouble again!\"A seven-year-old child actually didn't panic after her lies being exposed by an adult! If her character was on the right path, why couldn't she succeed in?However, she was bent on taking the wrong path. With her personality, she mustn't be allowed to come back to Qiao's house!Xiao Qiao raised her head. Her eyes glared at Qiao Xiu Zhi and said word by word, \"One day, you will regret what you said today!\"After speaking, she turned and left.Qiao Hong Xia widened her eyes in fright. A shiver run through her body.If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, she couldn't believe such vicious gazes and words came from a seven-year-old child!Lin Hui walked out of the next room. Frowning, she spoke, \"In the future, let Da Qiao stay away from her. Da Qiao is so innocent.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at her belly, which had grown another notch, and said, \"You have to be careful about that pair of mother and daughter. Once old Second settle down in that side, your family will move to the town to live. The farther away from them two, the better!\"Lin Hui nodded: \"Don't worry, Mom. I will stay away from them.\"Xiao Qiao returned to the thatched hut with a flushing face.As soon as Fang Xiao Juan saw her, she immediately latched onto her and asked, \"Why did Qiao Family call you over? Did they change their minds and let you go back to Qiao's house?\"Xiao Qiao gritted her teeth and replied, \"What go back to Qiao's house! They cut ties with me!\"Fang Xiao Juan was stunned for a moment, \"What? Cut off ties! What about the pork and eggs that were agreed before? Are they not going to give it?\"There were still seven or eight days before Meng Hong Guang's arrival. Even if they meet, she will definitely not be able to go back to the city with him immediately. So she had to rely on Qiao Family to nourish herself.Now that the meat in her mouth was gone, how can she be calm?Xiao Qiao's hand was hurt from her pinching. She tried hard to get out of her grasp, but it was useless: \"Yes, it's gone, it's gone! Let go, you're hurting me!\"The humiliation at Qiao's house today made Xiao Qiao explode. She could no longer be as calm as before.Fang Xiao Juan swung a slap over: \"Dead girl, so what if you are reborn? I've been your mother for two lifetimes. If you dare to speak to me in such a tone, see if I won't kill you!\"Xiao Qiao's face tilted from the slap. Her cheeks were aching.Fire raged within her as she vowed that one day, she would kill everyone in Qiao Family, including Fang Xiao Juan!...At Qiao Zhen Jun's side, he went to the food factory to report for duty.Although his position was only a gatekeeper and a temporary worker, he could not take his post immediately.First, he must be familiar with all the locations and layouts of the factory, as well as the main directors in the factory. He must be able to recite the rules and regulations of the factory. After he was familiar with these, he can start working.Of course, these weren't difficult. Just need to put in some mental effort.Qiao Zhen Jun cherished this job very much. So his attitude was very sincere. Whatever, his mentor told him to do, he did.Everyone thought that he came through the backdoor and his attitude would definitely be very arrogant. Like he would look down on them, doorkeeper. Surprisingly, he seem to be humble. He brought a lot of food for everyone upon his arrival.As the saying goes, it was hard to bite the hands that feed you. Everyone ate his food and the sense of rejection and unfamiliarity toward him melt away a lot. Plus everyone had a carefree temperament and will not engage in mind fight. So they quickly accepted him.Although Qiao Zhen Jun's mouth wasn't sweet and his brain wasn't as flexible as his fifth younger brother, he was willing to work. Everyone dislike night-shift, so he took the initiative to change shifts with everyone. Seeing him so easy-to-get-along, their attitude toward him was nicer and nicer.In this way, Qiao Zhen Jun quickly stabilized in the factory.There was was some people talking about his backdoor and background. Some people even asked him in his face. He didn't say anything about the relationship between Shen Family and the factory manager. Only answered that he bought this position with money.Nowadays, using money to exchange for a employment was an often occurrence. No one was surprised.At this response, everyone were very curious, how a young man from the countryside could spend so much money to buy a job.On the day off, Qiao Zhen Jun went to Shen's house with the hundred-year-old Ganoderma lucidum.Shen Family were shocked when they found out that he brought a hundred-year-old Ganoderma lucidum.This kind of thing can't be bought with money. They didn't expect that Qiao Family would be able to take out two big pieces in one go!Shen Family felt that this gift was very valuable. Because old Mister Shen wasn't in good health, they accepted this gift after deliberation.In their heart, they plan to use other things to return Qiao Family's thoughtfulness in the future.Toward this relative, Shen Family was now more and more satisfied from top to bottom. When they heard that they had accepted a little country girl as their goddaughter, many people had said sour words.The most talked about was that these country people were the most greedy. They will definitely stick to Shen Family like leech in the future and they will regret it later!Shen Family didn't take this to heart at the time. At this moment, they were even more grateful for their decision. Although they gave Qiao Family a lot of things, Qiao Family never took advantage of them.Just for this point, this relative was worth staying interacting with....On this day, Qiao Hong Xia was returned from picking vegetables in her private plot. She was halfway there, when she was stopped by Wang Yan Sheng.Wang Yan Sheng looked at her with self-conscious expression: \"Hong Xia, can you come with me for a moment? I have something to tell you.\"Qiao Hong Xia halted for a moment. A strange feeling surged in her heart. After thinking about it, she followed: \"Okay.\"For fear of being seen by the people in the village, Wang Yan Sheng walked in front, while Qiao Hong Xia followed behind not far or near.Wang Yan Sheng stopped when he reached halfway up the mountain.There were very few people here. The terrain was relatively high. Once someone comes over, they can immediately notice.When Qiao Hong Xia saw him bring herself to this place, the strange feeling in her heart became stronger and stronger. Recalling the way he smiled at her that night, her heartbeat couldn't help speeding up again.\"What do you want to say to me?\" She stopped an arm length away from him and tensely spoke.Wang Yan Sheng's face also displayed a little nervousness. He coughed: \"I am twenty-six years old this year. Just promoted to the position of head of the regiment at the end of last year. A month's salary is sixty-five yuan and seven dimes in total. On holiday season, there are other subsidy. Over the years, I have given the majority of my salary to my family. So I only saved 400 yuan. I told my family two days ago that I will only give Dad 100 yuan as living expenses every year. Any other other times, I won't send the money back.\"Qiao Hong Xia's heart beat faster and stammered, \"Why, why are you telling me this?\"Wang Yan Sheng stared at her with sharp eyes and solemnly stated, \"Hong Xia, I want to match you.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHearing Wang Yan Sheng's words, Qiao Hong Xia felt that something exploded in her mind!Her whole body was like a shrimp thrown into boiling water, turning red at a speed visible to the naked eye.Her grasp on the corners of the clothes repeatedly tighten and loosen. The corners of the clothes were creased so badly by her. It took a long time before she found her voice and responded, \"Why me?\"Not only was she one year older than him, but she was also divorced and had a child. With his status and achievements, he can absolutely marry a better girl!It wasn't impossible for him to marry a city girl. If she hadn't known that he wasn't the type to make fun of others, she would have thought he was making fun of her!Qiao Hong Xia was nervous. While Wang Yan Sheng was more nervous than her.It was just that he was dark-skinned and serious. If one wasn't particularly familiar with him, they couldn't notice.Unblinkingly, he stared at her face. Seeing her cheeks were flushed with pink, he thought it was beautiful.After staring at her for a while, he forced himself to look away from her face due to being afraid that she would think he was a hooligan. Then he heard her question.He breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, she didn't reject him: \"I-I've noticed you for a long time.\"As soon as he said this, he wanted to slap himself.Pah, this sounds more like a hooligan!Sure enough, when Qiao Hong Xia heard what he said, she looked up at him.Wang Yan Sheng was so nervous that his heart jumped out of his throat: \"I-I didn't mean that. I mean do you remember the year 1960?\"Qiao Hong Xia was stunned for a moment. Then she nodded, \"Of course I remember. The three years of famine. Can't forget it in this life!\"Wang Yan Sheng nodded his head. From 1959 to 1961, there was a famine across the country. Many people didn't survive those years.In the past, Wang Family wasn't wealthy. It could even be said that they were very poor. When the great famine came, people with a large family and a large population like them were the first to take the hit.His grandfather, grandmother, and a youngest aunt died from eating\u00a0white clay. He originally had a little sister. She also starved to death that year.In those three years, people in the production team starved to death almost every day!Although the family warned them not to eat white clay every day, but on that day, he was so hungry that he couldn't bear it. When his trembling hands were about to stuff the white clay into his mouth, she appeared in front of him with half a coarse mantou.He still remembers what she said to him. She uttered, \"If you eat this soil, you will die. Don't eat it. Eat my piece of mantou!\"He raised his head and looked at her blankly. He thought that she was really stupid. How important food was in those days. She actually gave him mantou to eat!Seeing that he hadn't moved, she shoved the mantou into his hands. Before leaving, she warned him again to not eat white clay in the future.At that time, he stared blankly at her departing back while gobbling his food. He felt that she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen in his life. Even when she was thin and pale at that time.She was thirteen years old that year, while he was twelve years old. After that day, he found out her name and knew that she was the third child in the family like himself.Later, they all survived the most difficult three years. After that, Qiao Family's life became more and more prosperous, while Wang Family was still very poor. His eldest brother and second brother got married one after another.A girl in the village can seek an in-law family at the age of sixteen or seventeen. When she was sixteen, the matchmaker frequently went to Qiao's house to talk about match. The young men in the production team near and far all wanted to marry her as a wife. He did to.But he didn't want to marry her back to make her live in a thatched hut or eat pickled veg and gruel with him every meal. So when the troops went to the production team to select people to serve as soldiers, he seized the opportunity.Before going to the army, he really wanted to ask her to wait for him. He couldn't open his mouth though. He had nothing. If he didn't get any results, why should he let her waste time for him?In the end, he didn't say anything and went to the army alone with a suitcase on his back.He went all out with his life. When others put in 100% of sweat, he paid 200%. When others practiced for ten hours, he gave himself two additional hours of practice.His hard work paid off with a hefty result. He was promoted from soldier to squad leader to platoon leader. When he thought he had finally made some achievements and could come back to propose marriage to her, she got married.After knowing that she was married, he regretted and blamed himself very much in his heart. He should have come back earlier. He should have the cheek to express his heart to her. Maybe she will be willing to wait for him.But it's useless to regret. Before returning to the army, he made an excuse to go to the production team where her husband's house was located. Just so that he could take a look at her from a distance.After returning to the army, he worked even harder. Although he didn't know who he was fighting for, he didn't want to miss the next person he liked because of his incompetence.It took him three years to be promoted to the platoon leader and eight years to be promoted to the head of the regiment. During this period, countless people wanted to match with him. Some of whom he directly refused, while some couldn't be refused and he went on a blind date. None made his heart move.When he came back this time because of family matters, he had never thought that he would meet her. Let alone that she would go home after a divorce!The moment he heard her divorce, he felt his heart beating fast. His blood was pumping. This sounded a bit of despicable gloating, but he was really glad that the man had no eyes!In the past few days since he came back, he was busy with Huo Family's matter and going to the county city to inquire about his fifth younger brother. He thought that he wouldn't be able to think of other things when he was busy. But her appearance seemed to be engraved in his heart. The busier he was, the more he wanted to see her.A few days of brewing, it made him understand that he wanted to marry her!He didn't want to miss this opportunity again. If he missed this opportunity again, he will regret it for the rest of his life!Qiao Hong Xia heard him mention that she gave him half a mantou back then and that he wanted to marry her eleven years ago. Her heart seemed to contain many jumping rabbits. They were all jumping wildly.Thump thump thump...It was the sound of her heartbeat.The two stood so close. She wondered if he would hear her heartbeat.She tried to calm herself down, but it didn't work at all!She blushed. She bit her lower lip and said, \"So... are you trying to repay your gratitude?\"Wang Yan Sheng nodded his head like a fool: \"Didn't the ancients say that life-saving grace should be repaid with body? I want to promise myself to you...\"After that, he wanted to kick himself again!What the hell was going on with him today?Why was he saying such a hooligan words?Qiao Hong Xia's neck turned red: \"Do you usually talk to women like this?\"Wang Yan Sheng shook his head like a rattle: \"No, I don't talk to other women like that. No, no. I don't have any other women!\"\"Pfft...\"Qiao Hong Xia finally couldn't help laughing when she saw how he was nervous to the point of talking nonsense.Wang Yan Sheng took in her pink cheeks and the corners of her lips curled up. An impulse surged in his heart; he wanted to hug her in his arms!He took a deep breath and stated, \"Hong Xia, I got a clumsy mouth and can't speak. But I really want to get along with you. If you want, we can get engaged immediately. It's just marriage is a year later.\"According to the custom of the village, after the death of an elder in the family, one year must pass before getting married and having a wedding.Qiao Hong Xia felt like her mouth was stuffed with sweet dates. The sweetness seeped from her mouth to her heart: \"I-I'll talk to you after I think about it!\"After speaking, she turned and ran down the mountain as if a wolf was chasing behind her.Wang Yan Sheng watch her fleeing back. The corners of his mouth couldn't help but lift....Qiao Hong Xia ran home in one swoop.Lin Hui walked out of the kitchen holding her belly. Just in time to see her panting. She couldn't help but ask, \"Why did you run to this state? Did something happen?\"Qiao Hong Xia had a guilty conscience of a thief. Her eyes were erratic and dared not look at her: \"Nothing happened.\"Her temperament had always been open. And at this moment, she was fidgety. Lin Hui can't even notice if she doesn't want to. It was just she was gentle. She would never be nosy about things the other party didn't want to say.She reached out and grasped her basket, \"Give me the vegetables. I'll wash them.\"Qiao Hong Xia shook her head: \"No, I'll do it. You have such a big belly. Don't do the usual housework. Let me come back and do it!\"Lin Hui curled the corners of her lips: \"It's only been five months. It's still a few months before the actual delivery. How can I do nothing?\"Out of the entire production, one won't be able to find a second pair of sister-in-laws who gets along so well like them.In the end, Qiao Hong Xia took on the job of washing vegetables.But after washing half a day, she didn't finish. She had ruined all the cabbage!When Lin Hui came out again, she found her like this. She couldn't help but be a little worried: \"Hong Xia, do you have something on your mind? The women in the village always speaks badly, so don't take their words to heart!\"Some time ago, Zhao Jie Fang remarried. It was publicized by Song Jin Lai's wife. The whole production team knew about it.She was worried that Qiao Hong Xia had heard something unpleasant when she went out just now and kept her grievance in her heart.Qiao Hong Xia looked up and saw Second Elder Sister-in-law looking at her with worried eyes. Her heart warmed: \"Second Elder Sister-in-law, I'm really fine. But I have something...I want to ask for your opinion.\"Lin Hui saw her cheeks suddenly turned red. A strange feeling surged in her heart: \"What's the matter?\"Qiao Hong Xia hesitated: \"Second Elder Sister-in-law, how did you make up your mind to be with my second elder brother?\"Speaking of which, Second Elder Sister-in-law was really infatuated with Second Elder Brother!Back then, when her second elder brother's legs weren't healed, she had no hesitation to marry her second elder brother!This time, it was Lin Hui's turn to blush: \"How did I get pulled in? Actually, there's nothing to say. I just don't want to miss it again.\"Qiao Hong Xia looked at her with bright eyes: \"Then were you worried that you will not unsuitable for each other after remarriage?\"Speaking of which, them sister-in-laws have a very rough marriage. One was a widow and the other was divorced. In the eyes of others, they were all \"broken shoes\"!People like them who had been married once needed more courage to remarry. That was because they were afraid of making a wrong decision. If she made another wrong decision, can she still get divorced again?If she really get divorced again, her reputation will stink all over the world!Lin Hui smiled and nodded: \"Of course I'm worried. But compared to worrying about inappropriateness, I'm more afraid of regrets.\"She had regretted it once. A rare chance to try again appeared to her. If she missed it again this time, she will definitely regret it for the rest of her life!Qiao Hong Xia was holding a vegetable leaf in her hand as looked on in contemplation.Lin Hui looked at the vegetable leaves that were kneaded out of shape in her hands. She tentatively asked, \"Hong Xia, do you... have any thoughts in your mind?\"Qiao Hong Xia came back to her senses and her face burst into flames.She stood up in a panic. Holding the pot of broken vegetable leaves, she spoke, \"Second Elder Sister-in-law, I'm going to cook. You go to the room to rest for a while. I'll call you later when dinner is ready!\"After speaking, she ran away again.When it was time to eat, the table was full of \"sorrows and complaints\".\"Third Aunt, this dish is so salty!\" Da Qiao almost cried when she took a bite of the dish.When Qiao Hong Xia heard this, she quickly took a sample with her chopsticks and almost spit it out. It was too salty. How many times did she put the salt in?Little Yi Ming crossed his little arms and said with a sullen face: \"Mom, waste is shameful. You can't spit it out!\"Qiao Hong Xia: \"...\"Seeing the slumped appearance of Third Aunt, Da Qiao covered her mouth and giggled.Qiao Hong Xia stood up and declared, \"Don't eat these. I'll make you some noodles.\"Lin Hui followed and stood up: \"Forget it. Let me. With the way you are, I worry about handing over the kitchen to you again!\"She was now quite sure that Qiao Hong Xia had something on her mind. And it should be a good thing.Qiao Hong Xia felt guilty again.That night, the dinner at Qiao's small house was a little late. That same night, Qiao Hong Xia had insomia again....\"Clang clang clang...\"The next day, Wang Shui Sheng got off work half an hour earlier. Then he sounded the gong and asked everyone to gather at the threshing yard. He had something to announce.\"What do you think the leader wants to say? Could it be that West Wood matter has been spread out?\"\"No way? Didn't the captain tell everyone not to speak out?\"\"It's hard to say. You also know that there are a lot of loose mouths in this production team!\"\"Damn, if this is the case, I would definitely let that person go when I find out who said it!\"This spread in an instant. The more it spread, the worse it became. Everyone suspected each other. A few people almost fought.Wang Shui Sheng came over, knocked on the gong, and bellowed, \"Just be quiet. No fights allowed, or I'll deduct work points!\"When everyone heard that work points would be deducted, they quieted down.Wang Shui Sheng coughed and stated, \"Our production team has so-so harvests. We don't have any specialties, nor do we have a geographical advantage. As a result, our production team has been unable to go up and down over the years. We won't starve to death, but we can't be rich!\"\"Since I have become the production leader, I naturally want to help everyone and the entire production team to become rich. But I am slow brain that's inflexible. Nor do I have connections. So I'm really sorry for everyone over the years!\"When everyone heard the beginning, they couldn't help but be a little stunned.What did Leader mean?Did he not want to do it?Most of the people looked worried. Though Wang Shui Sheng was not very skilled as a production team leader, he was fair and not greedy. Everyone was quite satisfied with him as the production leader.There were also a small number of people who were delighted. Some people have long wanted to remove Wang Shui Sheng from the position of production leader and replace him. But because Wang Family had old Third Wang, who was an official in the army. No one dared to go against him outright.Wang Shui Sheng ignored everyone's discussion and continued to shout with his deep voice: \"My third younger brother came back this time and showed me a way. He said that the country needs a lot of Chinese herbal medicine now. There are almost no production teams that can grow Chinese herbal medicine. So he suggested that our production team can develop in this direction!\u201dSomeone shouted: \"Leader, how can we develop? It can't be that everyone plant Chinese herbal medicine instead of food? Then what will we eat at the end of the year?\"\"Eat the northwest wind!\" Someone contradicted. \"The community stipulates that the production team can only grow commercial crops. If the leader privately change to Chinese herbal medicine and we can't pay the grain, each and every one of us will have to go to jail!\"When everyone heard this, they panicked.\"Leader, you can't do this!\"\"Yeah yeah. we don't want to go to jail. What's wrong with growing food?\"\"That's right, although we can't be rich, we still have food to eat. If we plant some Chinese herbal medicine, can those thing survive? Even if we grew it, it can't fill our stomach!\"Wang Shui Sheng saw that everyone was very spirited. So he banged on the gong quickly. Even when his voice was hoarse, there was still no way to calm everyone down.At this moment, Wang Yan Sheng walked out of the crowd with his long legs and came to the stage.He glanced coldly at everyone. His strong and powerful voice boomed, \"Everyone quiet!\"As soon as this sounded, the whole threshing floor seemed to be like a duck strangled by the neck. There was no sound.Very few people in the production team didn't know Wang Yan Sheng's identity in the army. This time, when he came back, many people wanted to have a relationship with him. Unfortunately, after he came back for so many days, he was almost out every day. It was difficult for everyone to see him!At this moment, he was standing tall and straight on the top. His aura carried unspoken power. With this holler, everyone naturally became fearful.Wang Yan Sheng explained with a solemn face: \"When my eldest brother said planting Chinese herbal medicines, he doesn't mean that we do not grow food. The land of the production team belongs to the state. Only after confirming with the government can the plant be changed, otherwise it is illegal!\"\"Then what did Leader mean just now?\" Someone asked boldly.Wang Yan Sheng responded: \"Every family has a private plot. Though the area isn't large, you can use this private plot to try to grow Chinese herbal medicine if you want.\"It turned out he meant the private plot. When everyone heard this, their hearts finally settle back down.Private plots weren't allowed to grow commercial crops. So ordinary households use them to grow vegetables, such as cucumbers, pumpkins, radishes, and cabbage. Though it wasn't much, it was enough for the family's daily needs.If this private land was changed to Chinese herbal medicine, what will they eat after that? Eat plain congee with boiled water every day?So some people weren't willing!\"Old Third, the Chinese herbal medicine you mentioned, is there any benefit after planting it?\"For example, can it be sold to a supply and demand cooperative for a good price. Or the state might send someone to buy it? If the price is good, they will be happy. But if it's not good, why would they plant it?Wang Yan Sheng answered: \"If you can plant a large area, it will naturally be beneficial. But at the beginning, the amount isn't large. On top of that, everyone hasn't plant it before. It needs a process of exploration and adaptation. In other words, in the short term, it may be possible that there's no benefit.\"If one can't get any benefits, would any one want to plant it?Were they retarded?The crowd boiled again and all kind of complaints erupted.Qiao Hong Xia looked at the man on the stage with a complicated mood.Before yesterday, he was another villager to her. Other than that, there was no relationship between them.But after yesterday, they got a tie that no one else knew about. At this time, seeing everyone disobeyed him, she felt nervous for some reason.\"Mom, I don't think Wang... old Third Wang isn't someone who mess around. Since he dares to say such a thing. He must have a plan later, but it's hard to tell everyone now.\"She considered it for a while. Then she turned her head and said to her mom in a hushed voice.Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at her and said, \"You... seem to know him well?\"\"Boom!\"It seemed that a thunder had struck in Qiao Hong Xia's heart. Her face instantly turned red.She wanted to say that she didn't know him. But when she met her mom's penetrating eyes, she couldn't say a word. She could only bow her head with a blushing face.In Qiao Xiu Zhi's eyes, it appeared more and more guilty.At this time, there was another woman's eyes fixated on Wang Yan Sheng in the crowd.That person wasn't Fang Xiao Juan, but a female educated youth, Da Zhi.Da Zhi's eyes were bright and her cheeks were pink. She stared at the tall and straight man on the stage without blinking and asked the female educated youth beside her, \"Who is that man on the stage? Why haven't I seen him before?\"The man on stage was amazing!Those pair of straight and slender long legs. That tall and straight figure. Those handsome and resolute facial features. No matter which, they were all in line with her interpretation of the perfect man!\"Him? He's the production team leader's third younger brother. I heard that he is a very capable person. He was just promoted to the regiment leader in the army last year. He hasn't been home for a few years. It is normal for you not to know him.\"The female educated youth beside her was from the first batch of educated youth entering the countryside. Because she was old and married someone from the production team a few years ago and had children, she knew Wang Yan Sheng's background very well.Regiment leader!Da Zhi's face turned even redder. Her body trembled with excitement.This man was simply a dream lover tailored for her!This man was hers!Wang Yan Sheng spoke up again to silence everyone: \"My eldest brother and I are just telling everyone about this. As for whether you want to change to Chinese herbal medicine, you can decide for yourself. If you don't want to, the production team will never force you! Give you one day to think about it. If you want to change to Chinese herbal medicine, go to the production team office tomorrow to sign up!\"\"None of us have ever grown Chinese herbal medicine, what if it die?\"Some people know that Wang Yan Sheng was a capable person. Like Qiao Hong Xia thought, he did nothing aimlessly. So they were a little moved when they saw him on stage just now.When Wang Yan Sheng heard this question, the corner of his mouth twitched slightly: \"Our production team has three people from the farm before. They happened to have experience planting Chinese herbal medicine. At that time, they can ask them to guide everyone in planting!\"Some people who want to grow plants were relieved when they hear this.\"Do you have any questions? If not, then...\"Just when Wang Shui Sheng was about to dismiss everyone, a delicate voice suddenly rang out: \"Leader, I have something to say!\"Da Zhi squeezed out of the crowd and walked toward the stage with her hip swaying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWang Shui Sheng couldn't help frowning when he heard her pitch her voice.This year's educated youth was really not easy to mind, especially the female educated youth!Before, Ye Zhen Zhen hooked up with his fifth younger brother and the two teamed up to hurt Fang Xiao Juan. His fifth younger brother committed suicide by jumping into the river. Fang Xiao Juan lost her child. As the involved party, Ye Zhen Zhen must pay the price.Under his witness, Ye Zhen Zhen paid Fang Xiao Juan two hundred yuan. Then he used his connections to transfer her to a remote production team. Ye Zhen Zhen felt ashamed, so she didn't dare to resist.After Ye Zhen Zhen left, Da Zhi, who was her good friend, laid low for a while. Unexpectedly, she started to act up again at this moment.Seeing that her eyes glued to his third younger brother, he couldn't help but want to shake his head.Da Zhi walked up. She deliberately walked to Wang Yan Sheng's side and showed him a smile that she thought was sweet and innocent.Wang Yan Sheng directly walked passed her without even giving half a glance.From his point of view, this leering female educated youth was nothing more than an irrelevant person. Since she was irrelevant, why waste his expression with her?\"...\"Da Zhi's face was red and white. Her head was about to fall out of embarrassment.Wang Yan Sheng walked off the stage and walked in the direction of Qiao Family with his long legs.Qiao Hong Xia's heart beat wildly again. Thump thump thump!What was he trying to do? There was so many people watching. It can't be that he want to come and talk to her?Qiao Hong Xia bit her lower lip. So nervous that her heart almost jumped out.Da Qiao uttered: \"Third Aunt, your face is so red. Are you feeling unwell?\"Qiao Hong Xia didn't expect to be caught by a child: \"Third Aunt is fine, but the weather is a little hot.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi calmly glanced over at her. Nothing was said.Wang Yan Sheng came over. His eyes swept across her blushing face before standing beside Qiao Zhen Guo.Qiao Zhen Guo thought that old Third Wang was strange. Out of all the places, he choose to squeeze in beside him.Wang Yan Sheng smiled at him, \"About the matter of replanting Chinese herbal medicine I mentioned just now, what do Eldest Brother Qiao think?\"Qiao Zhen Guo scratched his head and answered, \"I don't understand. Anyway, I'll just listen to my mom.\"Wang Yan Sheng paused a bit, \"Eldest Brother Qiao is really a filial person. Auntie Xiu Zhi must be very comforted to have a son like you!\"\"My biggest strength is listening to my mom. I didn't expect you to see it so quickly!\"Qiao Zhen Guo patted his shoulder proudly. This was the first time someone had praised him like that!Qiao Hong Xia stood behind them. She worried for a while that her eldest brother would make outrageous remark. Then she was anxious about Wang Yan Sheng saying something that shouldn't be said. She didn't hear a word of what was being said on stage.At this moment, Da Zhi was standing on the stage. When he saw Wang Yan Sheng walking toward that simpleton, Qiao Zhen Guo, she broke out in a cold sweat.Wang Shui Sheng impatiently spoke: \"This female comrade, just say what you have to say. Everyone has been working all morning. They are still waiting to go back to eat!\"Ain't that right! The people below had long been impatient. If they weren't afraid of being work point deduction, everyone would have ran off long ago.Da Zhi bit her lip and stated, \"I'm standing here to clarify one thing with everyone. There have been a lot of rumors about me in the production team these days. It's all nonsense. I'm innocent. I was just beaten. The person who assaulted me was a woman. Not a man!\"After these words, the audience was quiet for a while. Then there was a chuckle of laughter.\"The way she looked that day! Can't believe she said she's innocent. Treating us blind?\"\"Ain't that right! She walked around loosely dressed and still say she's innocent. Truly speaking blind words with eyes wide open!\"\"Okay. This female educated youth, you are so innocent! Can we go now? I'm starving to death!\"Hearing the audience's unpleasant responses, she was about to cry: \"Leader, you said last time you would help me investigate. It's been so long, why is there no news at all?\"When Wang Shui Sheng heard this, he immediately became unhappy: \"The next day after your incident, I gathered people to search the production team. We searched everywhere, but couldn't find any clues. I had asked you if you had any feud with anyone. And if you saw who the person who beat you. You said no. Then how do you want me to investigate?\"She had no answer to any questions. He wasn't an immortal. How can figure out who hit her with just a few guesses!Da Zhi's eyes fell in the direction of Qiao Family again. She fiercely gritted her teeth: \"When that woman hit me that day, she sat on top of me, she was very heavy. I have observed the women in the production team. Only two meet these two criteria. One is Song Jin Lai's wife and the other is Qiao Family's eldest daughter-in-law, Wan Chun Ju.\"Song Jin Lai's wife didn't expect the gossip to turn to her. She jumped three feet high: \"You stinky bitch, if you talk nonsense again, be careful of me tearing your rotten mouth!\"Da Zhi calmly replied: \"Don't worry, Sister-in-law Song. I have already inquired about it later. On the day of my accident, Sister-in-law Song returned to your parents' house and wasn't in the production team at all. So...\"So the person who beat her wasn't Song Jin Lai's wife, but Eldest Qiao's wife, Wan Chun Ju?Everyone turned their heads and looked at Qiao Family in unison.Someone spoke: \"Eldest Qiao, that female educated youth said your wife beat her. Is this true?\"Qiao Zhen Guo was in a heated conversation with Wang Yan Sheng. Hearing his name called, he was stunned and responded, \"My wife has no grudge against her, why would she beat her?\"When everyone heard this, they found it reasonable.Although Wan Chun Ju loves to gossip, she seldom fought with women in the village. Mainly because if she dare to fight, she may not be able to go home.Besides, they never heard of Wan Chun Ju having contacts or feud with female educated youths.So everyone turned to ask Da Zhi: \"You said Eldest Qiao's wife beat you. So what did you do to offend her? Otherwise, why would she beat you for no reason?\"\"Yeah. I don't see her coming to beat me!\"Da Zhi's face flushed: \"I didn't offend her. I don't know why she beat me. But the person who beat me that day was very similar to her physique. I want to ask where she was at that evening?\"Qiao Zhen Guo scratched his head and replied, \"It's been so long. Who would still remember?\"Da Zhi displayed a cold face: \"Then you ask your wife to come over. I will confront her face to face!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi smiled: \"My eldest daughter-in-law is confinement, so she can't come out and have a confrontation with you! I will ask you one question. Are you sure that it's my eldest daughter-in-law who beat you?\"Da Zhi met Qiao Xiu Zhi's eyes. Her heart trembled. Still, she nodded, \"Sure. Only her figure match with the person who hit me that day!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi declared: \"Okay, since you are so sure. Let's go to the police station and report the case now!\"Report the case!When everyone heard this, there was an uproar.Some people think that Qiao Xiu Zhi was crazy. If it is discovered that Wan Chun Ju did it, Qiao Family will have a prisoner!Some people felt that Qiao Xiu Zhi was confident. She wasn't afraid of the police investigating.Hearing these words, Da Zhi's face turned white.If she had dared to call the police, she wouldn't have delayed it until today!Once she calls the police, she will not be able to hide the fact that she seduced Qiao Zhen Guo. Her reputation will be completely ruined by then!Wang Shui Sheng asked: \"This female comrade, what do you think? If you are sure, then we will go to the police station to report the case in the afternoon. The police station will definitely send someone down to investigate and give you justice!\"\"No, no! Don't report the case!\" Da Zhi panicked. \"I thought about it just now. Maybe I made a mistake. After all, it's been so long. I may have made a mistake!\"When everyone heard this, they couldn't help booing her.\"What are you doing? You said so much just and now you say you made a mistake. Are you playing with us?\"\"That's right! You've wasted so much time. Are you mentally ill?\"\"Look at her guilty conscience, I don't think she was beaten or forced. But rather, she messed around with people and someone encountered it. So she made an excuse to say she was beaten and want to put this crime on Qiao Family!\"\"It's really like what you said! Otherwise, why wouldn't she dare to go to the police station?\"Da Zhi's face turned pale at everyone's words.How did it end up like this?Originally, her plan was to confront Wan Chun Ju in person. If the other party didn't want to admit it, she would scare her by going to the police.Most of the women in the countryside were very stupid. If one frighten them, they will definitely confess.She never expected Qiao Xiu Zhi to demand to call the police first and she got counterattacked. She fell into a disadvantaged position all of a sudden!Qiao Xiu Zhi took in the sight of pale Da Zhi. She didn't sympathize with her at all.The person who hit her was indeed Wan Chun Ju. She had guessed it long ago.It was just that this incident was ultimately the fault of the female educated youth. She knew that Qiao Zhen Guo was a married man and she took the initiative to seduce him. If this kind of thing happened a few years earlier, she would have been arrested and paraded in the streets!Now Wan Chun Ju just beat her up. The beating wasn't serious. The other party didn't even need to go to the hospital. Like this, the matter was settled on both side. Unexpectedly, she still wanted to pull Wan Chun Ju out. How could she let her get her wish?The people below the stage became more and more overboard. Some people were even guessing who Da Zhi's lover was.As they were talking, someone guessed favus-riddled Gou Sheng. After all, Gou Sheng often sent wildflowers to the educated youth. Maybe they were doing shameful things together that day.Da Zhi couldn't take it anymore. She covered her mouth and sobbingly rushed off the stage.Since the involved party had ran away, Wang Shui Sheng could only announce the meeting was over.Qiao Zhen Guo had such a wonderful conversation with Wang Yan Sheng, he had already consider the other party his best bud. He had even opened his mouth to invite the other party over to the house for dinner.When Qiao Hong Xia heard this, her heart accelerated again.She hadn't figured out how to face Wang Yan Sheng!Fortunately, Wang Yan Sheng wasn't an untactful. He glanced at her face and responded, \"The meal is ready at home. Next time, I'll go look for Eldest Brother Qiao!\"A look of regret appeared on Qiao Zhen Guo's face: \"Okay, then you must find me next time!\"Qiao Hong Xia: \"...\"In all her life, this was the first time she had seen her eldest brother invite others over for dinner. One must know that her eldest brother prioritize food over his wife!Wang Yan Sheng greeted Qiao Family and left with his eldest brother.This scene enter the eyes of others. Some people guessed that Wang Yan Sheng was interested Qiao Family's connection with the deputy chief. That was why he became friends with Qiao Family.No one thought that he was doing it for Qiao Hong Xia. After all, Qiao Hong Xia was older than Wang Yan Sheng as well as being divorced. The two could not get together in eight lifetimes....On the way back, Da Qiao took her Grandmother's hand and whispered, \"Grandmother, Third Aunt kept secretly glancing at that Uncle Wang in front just now.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi reached out and rubbed her hair, \"I know. You can't tell others about this, understand?\"Da Qiao nodded her head and responded, \"I understand. I only tell Grandmother!\"After eating, Qiao Xiu Zhi went to Qiao's small house to find Qiao Hong Xia and asked her what was going on.Qiao Hong Xia didn't expect her mom to be so direct. After a moment of hesitation, she explained Wang Yan Sheng wanted to be with her.Qiao Xiu Zhi asked, \"What do you think?\"Qiao Hong Xia shook her head: \"Mom, I don't know. My heart is in a mess. Say, he is so good, why would he like me?\"Qiao Hong Xia felt inferior in her heart.She was divorced and had a son. Her conditions were far worst from Wang Yan Sheng's. Even if she was still unmarried, she felt that she wasn't worthy of him!Qiao Xiu Zhi said: \"Similar family status is necessary, but what is more important than that is whether the two people's personality is suitable for each other and whether they can tolerate each other. When I married your dad, some people said that I was interested in your dad's beauty. Some people say that your dad wanted to use me to get through the difficulties. In short, no one thinks that we can be husband and wife for a long time. And the result?\"Qiao Hong Xia appeared envious: \"As a result, you and Dad are more loving than an other couples!\"In her memory, her parents had never gotten into conflict. Her mom was strong-minded, while her dad was forever gentle. Her dad supported her mom without principle. No matter what her mom wanted to do, he would support her.It was because she was too envious of her parents' feelings that she would be so picky at the beginning. And she end up picking that useless Zhao Jie Fang!Qiao Xiu Zhi said: \"If the two want to come together, in addition to fate, they must also tolerate each other. But the most important thing is that you have to let this fate begin. If you dare not accept it because you are worried about other people's comments, then no matter how good the fate is, then it's useless no matter how good a match appear. I think old Third Wang is a good candidate. You should think carefully about it by yourself!\"After she finished speaking, she turned and left. Walking to the door, she saw Xue Chuan coming to Qiao's small house to pick her up.Qiao Hong Xia watched the back of her parents walking away together. Suddenly, she had the courage in her heart.The next day, she and Wang Yan Sheng came to the middle of the mountain one after the other.Qiao Hong Xia peeked at him and said, \"Before I give you an answer, I will ask you a few questions.\"Wang Yan Sheng was so nervous that his heart almost jumped out. He quickly bobbed his head and responded, \"You can ask as many questions as you want!\"Qiao Hong Xia pursed her lips and smiled: \"You know I'm divorced. Does your family know you want to be with me?\"Old Madam Wang was gone, but there was still old Mister Wang. Would he approve?Qiao Hong Xia didn't have high hope.Wang Yan Sheng honestly shook his head: \"I haven't told my family about this. I can't talk to my family without your consent.\"After all, this matter involved her reputation. Whether she agree or not to match him, he didn't want her to be criticized by others.Qiao Hong Xia was surprised at his thoughtfulness and carefulness. At the same time, her heart was warmed: \"What if your dad doesn't agree?\"Wang Yan Sheng spoke: \"I've been away from home for eleven years. My family has long been unable to make decisions about my affairs. I have the confidence to convince my dad if he doesn't agree. I will marry you. After we get married, I will apply for you to accompany to the army with me. Whether they oppose or not, it doesn't have much impact.\"Qiao Hong Xia's face turned red with a swoosh. She gave him a pointed stare and said, \"I... When did I say I was going to marry you?\"Receiving this gaze, Wang Yan Sheng felt his bones. He blushed: \"I'm sorry, I-I don't want to be a hooligan. I really want to marry you!\"Qiao Hong Xia: \"...\"The air seeped in lovey-dovey feel.The two stood facing each other an arm's length apart. Their faces was as red as monkey butts.After a moment of silence, Qiao Hong Xia opened her mouth again, \"You should know about my son following me back to Qiao's house, right?\"Wang Yan Sheng rapidly nodded again: \"I know! After we get married, I will treat little Yi Ming as my own son. If you don't want to have any one children, we won't have any. One child is enough!\"Hearing his words, Qiao Hong Xia's nose became sour. Her tears almost fell.Why didn't she meet him earlier?Seeing her reddening eyes, he immediately panicked: \"What's wrong? Did I say something wrong that made you unhappy? It's my fault. How about you hit me?\"Qiao Hong Xia saw how the big man sweat from angst, she felt sweet in her heart and wanted to laugh. She raised her hand and rubbed her eyes: \"Fool. I agree to match with you!\"Wang Yan Sheng froze. His eyes fixated on her. His stunned expression made he appear even more foolish.Qiao Hong Xia finally couldn't resist giggling.Wang Yan Sheng looked at her blooming like flower face. His chest vibrated for a while. It took him a long time to come back to his senses: \"Hong Xia, you really agree to match with me? I'm not dreaming, right?\"Qiao Hong Xia raised his gaze toward him: \"How about I pinch you? See if it hurt?\"Wang Yan Sheng was more than delighted to. So he quickly put his face close.He was 1.8 meters tall, while Qiao Hong Xia was only 1.65 meters tall. When he leaned over, he deliberately bent over to make it easier for her to pinch him.Qiao Hong Xia took in his attention to detail and her heart became more and more sweet.Maybe this time, she can have a relationship that lasts forever!She reached out and pinched his face hard.Wang Yan Sheng gasped in pain, but he was over the moon!Not a dream!Delight burst out and he picked up Qiao Hong Xia and twirled her around twice.Qiao Hong Xia was startled. She beat him hard: \"What are you doing? Still not letting me down!\"Only then, did Wang Yan Sheng realize his rashness. He quickly put her down and said, \"Hong Xia, I'm sorry. I too happy just now!\"He wanted to marry her as his wife since he was fifteen years old. When he knew she was married to someone else, he secretly cried once!He thought it was impossible to have her in this life. Unexpectedly, after so many years, his dream would come true!Qiao Hong Xia blushed like a ripe red apple in autumn. She sent him a pointed gaze: \"I'm going back.\"Wang Yan Sheng hurriedly stopped her: \"Hong Xia, I only have ten days of vacation. I will be returning to the army in two days. I want to settle our affairs before going back. What do you think?\"Long night means more dream/long delays cause complications!Back then, he moved too slow and let others take her away. This time, he can't miss the opportunity no matter what!He was about to go back to the army. Since they'll be apart such long distance, he must have a title. If not, he will not be able to leave with peace of mind!In this era, the so-called matching was blind date. Once they met each other eyes, they will soon get engaged or get married immediately.So when Qiao Hong Xia heard his words, she didn't find it anything wrong. She nodded with a blushing face, \"Then you send someone to my house.\"Wang Yan Sheng nodded his head was chopping onion: \"Okay, I'll go home and tell my family. Tomorrow I'll get a matchmaker to go ask for betrothal!\"His eyes were blazing so much that Qiao Hong Xia felt self-conscious with him. She nodded before turning around and ran away.When she ran to the bottom of the mountainside, she heard a shout from above: \"I have a wife! She's finally promised to me!\"Qiao Hong Xia laughed. Her heart felt even sweeter than drinking honey water!Back at Qiao's small house, Lin Hui saw Qiao Hong Xia running back with a blushing face like last time. She couldn't help ask her.This time Qiao Hong Xia didn't hide it and told her the matter.Lin Hui froze on the spot. After the shock wear off, she teased her: \"Alright, you said I'm your best second elder sister-in-law. Why are you are only telling me such an important thing now!\"Qiao Hong Xia blushed: \"It's not that I don't want to tell Second Elder Sister-in-law. I'm afraid that this matter will be flase hope, and then...\"Lin Hui nodded: \"I understand. I understand, Hong Xia, this is wonderful! Although I don't know old Third Wang very well, but since he is willing to do so many things for you, I believe you will be very blissed in the future!\"It was quite hard to come by for a man with Wang Yan Sheng's condition to say he doesn't want children!Qiao Hong Xia nodded: \"He's wonderful. I'm a little worried about little Yi Ming. I don't know if he can accept him?\"Lin Hui wasn't worried at all. Instead, she grinningly said, \"I think you should be worried about little Yi Ming unwilling to leave his Elder Sister Da Qiao in the future. And unwilling to go to the army with you!\"Hearing this, Qiao Hong Xia couldn't help but laugh.Little Yi Ming and little Dong Lin were like two little tails. Day in, day out, it was Elder Sister Da Qiao. If they were to be separate in the future, it would be really difficult!...When Wang Yan Sheng went back that day, he told his family about his engagement to Qiao Hong Xia.This was like putting a drop of water in a heated oil pan. The whole pan immediately explode!What?Old Third want to marry Qiao Hong Xia?How can that be?Did they hear it wrong?Wang Family's daughter-in-laws were even more shocked!Old Third Wang had excellent condition. He became a colonel in the army at a young age. His future was boundless. The few sister-in-laws had long wanted to introduce their cousin sisters to him.First, their mother-in-law had recently passed away. So it was hard to bring it up at this time.Second, after old Third Wang came back, he rarely stayed at home. They can't really come over to guard him every day.Third, old Third Wang had his own ideas. Though his aura wasn't angry and arrogant, they were still afraid of him when they saw him. So they haven't spoken.Unexpectedly, their plans were cut off!Old Mister Wang was stunned for a moment. Slowly, he opened his mouth and said: \"Qiao Hong Xia? The divorced woman from Qiao Family who has a child?\"When Wang Yan Sheng heard his dad's words, he felt a little uncomfortable: \" It's her. I know what you think. I don't care that she's divorced. Nor do I care that she has children. I want to marry her. Whether you agree to it or not, I must marry her no matter what!\"Wang Family fell into silence for a while when they heard this.When did these two get together?Why didn't they notice at all?Old Mister Wang took a puff of tobacco and replied, \"I can not object, but you have to promise me one thing.\"Wang Yan Sheng raised his eyebrows: \"What?\"Old Mister Wang: \"You bring your fifth younger brother's son Cong'er home and register him under your name. Then I will approve.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen the rest of Wang Family heard this, they couldn't help but gasp.Wang Xin Sheng and his ex-wife gave birth to a son five years ago. The ex-wife died of bleeding. The son was brought back to be raised by the ex-wife's maternal family. They said that the daughter died within a year after marriage. If they weren't allowed to carry their grandson back, they would go to the community to report Wang Xin Sheng.The ex-wife's maternal family had a son before. Unfortunately he died of illness seven or eight years ago. After Liu Family suddenly came to the end of the line, they took the child back . They had changed the child's surname and raised as their direct grandson. Now they had raised him for five years. If they snatch the child back later, the other party will definitely fight with Wang Family!Besides, it wasn't that Wang Yan Sheng can't give birth himself. It was a bit too much to make him to support his fifth younger brother's son.Everyone thought that Wang Yan Sheng would definitely refuse. However, they heard him calmly stated, \"Okay, no problem!\"Hearing this, everyone was stunned again.Was old Third Wang alright?To actually agree so easily. This was completely out of character for old Third!Old Mister Wang was also stunned. He forgot to smoke his pipe. He stared at his third son and said, \"You, you really agree?\"Wang Yan Sheng's calmness made everyone ill at ease: \"Didn't you want me to agree? Dad, if I refuse, you probably going to the army and report me for being unfilial, right?\"Old Mister Wang's face flashed a hint of guilt and self-consciousness: \"Old Third, Dad knows that you don't like it, but your fifth brother only have this bloodline left. I can't just watch him stray outside!\"Although Yao-er didn't live up to his expectations, he had doted him for decades. Now the white-haired sent off black-haired. During this period, he had dreams of Yao'er corpse every day. Yao'er told him that he was very worried about his son and his only long-cherished wish is to get his son recognize his ancestors and return to the clan.In the past few years, he and his wife had been thinking about Cong'er. Since his wife and his youngest left, he felt that his time was running out. So he wanted to get the child back before he died and register under old Third's name.Old Third had the ability. If he is put under his name, Cong'er will not be bullied by others. He will not be afraid of him being unpromising in the future.He also knew that this was unfair to old Third. But he no choice, no? Besides, since old Third child was willing to raise other people's sons, then wasn't it more appropriate to raise his own nephew?He thought that old Third would definitely be unwilling. If he did then he would threaten him with a hunger strike.It didn't occur to him that he agreed without even refusing. This made him feel a little uneasy.The corners of Wan Yan Sheng's mouth twitched: \"Dad, don't worry. I will take care of Cong'er. I will pave the way for him in the future to make him stand out.\"Hearing this, the eyes of old Second Wang's wife and old Fourth Wang lit up. Since old Third was so easy to talk to, it shouldn't be a problem for him to help other nephews in the future, right?While old Mister Wang heard this, he felt even more uneasy. Soon he knew why he was uneasy.He listened to Wang Yan Sheng continue: \"After he become promising, I will be able to retire and enjoy comfortable life. I will make him hand over his monthly salary to me. Get him buy a house and a car for my son. Earn money for my son to marry a wife. When I am old and can't move, he has to serve me on eating, drinking, and urinating. If he doesn't want to, I'll go to his workplace to report him for being unfilial. Saying he's a rotton jerk!\"Reaching here, Wang Yan Sheng paused and looked at his dad with sharp eyes: \"So Dad, don't worry. For my good future, I will take good care of Fifth Younger Brother's son!\"Old Mister Wang: \"...\"The rest of Wang Family: \"...\"This move was so cruel!Sure enough, old Third was still old Third. And they were wondering why he was so easy to talk to just now. It turned out that there was this move waiting here!Old Mister Wang trembled with anger: \"You...you unfilial son!\"Wang Yan Sheng raised his eyebrows: \"I did everything according to Dad's words. How am I unfilial? There's no better day than today. Let's go to Liu's house today to get Cong'er back. I'll be returning to the army in two days. Once the household registration is transferred over and I will take him to the army together. This way he can train his body since young!\"Taking a five-year-old child to the army drill?It would be better to directly kill him!Old Mister Wang was so furious that his chest heaved violently. Breath in but not out. A very frightening sight.Wang Shui Sheng hurried over to steady his breathing: \"Third Younger Brother, say less.\"Old Man Wang grasped his eldest son's hand, \"Eldest, give your third younger brother a good talk. Your fifth younger brother died so tragically. As as an elder brother with the ability to help, why isn't he willing? You can't be so selfish as a person! \"Wang Shui Sheng didn't persuade him. Instead, he sighed: \"Dad, if you are really think the best for Cong-er, let him stay in Liu's house. If he encounter something in the future, we as relatives will definitely not ignore him. You're not helping him, you're harming him!\"Cong'er was doing fine in Liu Family. Liu Family's elderly treated him as their grandson. So there was no need to bring him back!His third younger brother wasn't a ruthless person. He will help if he can help. But his dad forcing him like this was burning up what little affection left. He can control old Third now, but can he still control him for the rest of his life?Old Mister Wang looked at his eldest son before turning to look at his third son. In the end, he lowered his hand and sighed: \"I'm old and useless. You can do whatever you want.\"Mr. Wang wasn't completely muddle-headed. He knew that there weren't many days left. If old Third hold resentment, who knows how he'll treat the child after he passed.Forget it. Let him stay at Liu's house.It was just that when he thinks of Yao'er who committed suicide at a young age, he was immersed in self-blame and guilt.Of course, this was another story.The few branches dispersed. Wang Shui Sheng spoke, \"Third Younger Brother, I'll get your eldest sister-in-law help you with the preparations for the engagement?\"This time, Wang Yan Sheng didn't refuse: \"Then I will trouble Eldest Sister-in-law.\"Liu Cui Hua smilingly waved her hands: \"We're all one family, no need to say trouble. There are a lot of things to prepare for this engagement. Since you have to leave in two days, the preparation need to done quickly. I'll contact the matchmaker right now!\"After saying that, she hurried out the door.Liu Cui Hua was indeed shocked and regretful that old Third Wang wanted to marry Qiao Hong Xia. She understood that old Third Wang wasn't an ordinary person. No one could force him unless he wanted to.Although her maternal younger cousin sister looked pretty, her personality and knowledge weren't up to scratch. Even if she succeeded in marrying old Third child, they might not live in harmony in the future.So why should she get dragged in this muddy water. It was better to whole-heartedly help old Third and he can still remember her good point in the future!After sighing, the other two branches' sister-in-laws threw this to the back of their mind.Soon, Liu Cui Hua and Matchmaker Huang went to Qiao's house to seek the hand of marriage from the female party.Qiao Hong Xia told her parents about the situation as soon as she got back earlier. The others were very shocked after hearing it. After the shock, they were all happy for her.The two were in love with each other. On top of that, they knew each other's family well. Without any discussion, Qiao Family approved, mainly because Wang Yan Sheng will return to the army in two days.Liu Cui Hua led Matchmaker Huang through Qiao's house door. This scene had fallen in the eyes of people who were interested. Everyone was very curious.Seeing her merrily come out, they hurriedly surrounded her like flies smelling meat.\"Cui Hua, why did you and Matchmaker Huang go to Qiao's house? Do your maternal family want to be relatives with Qiao Family?\"There was only Qiao Hong Xia left in Qiao Family who can married. Although they have been divorced, a man with poor conditions or a widower wouldn't mind too much.Speaking of which, Liu Cui Hua was swift. Seeing Qiao Family gained the deputy chief's family as relatives, they immediately set their eyes on Qiao Hong Xia. Tsk tsk tsk. Why didn't they think of this?Liu Cui Hua grinned: \"It's not that my maternal family wants to be relatives with Qiao Family. It's our Wang Family!\"Wang Family?Everyone was shocked and puzzled when they heard this.Wang Yan Sheng was the only one left in Wang Family who had not married a wife yet. But how could he set his eyes on the divorced woman Qiao Hong Xia?One must know that Wang Yan Sheng was a colonel in the army. The twenty-six-year-old colonel was a capable person. In a few years, maybe he will be able to rise further!In fact, as soon as Wang Yan Sheng came back, everyone's eyes were fixed on him. It was just that Wang Family had two funerals. They weren't allowed to get married within a year. So everyone didn't dare to go up to inquire.Now Wang Family was going to be in-law with Qiao Family. Apart from Wang Yan Sheng, they can't think of any one else in Wang Family.Someone asked the question: \"Who in your Wang Family wants to be in-law with Qiao Family?\"Liu Cui Hua didn't plan to hide it: \"Who else could it be? Except for old Third in our Wang Family, all of them have married wives. My son is only ten years old. It's too early to marry a wife!\"One stone created a thousand ripples!As soon as these words came out, everyone's mind exploded!\"You mean old Third Wang wants to marry Qiao Hong Xia as his wife?\"\"No way? How is that possible?\"Old Third Wang wasn't blind. Nor was his brain flooded. How could he like Qiao Hong Xia, a broken shoe?Liu Cui Hua took in everyone's reaction and smiled: \"Why is it impossible? Hong Xia is beautiful, hard-working, and capable. She's a good hand in and out of the house. Whoever marries her will be truly blessed!\"\"But isn't she divorced? What's more, she has a son. With his good conditions, who can't he marry? Why did he set his eye on such a broken shoe?\"There was a displeased woman who had long been interested in old Third Wang as her son-in-law.Liu Cui Hua glanced at her. She lowered her face and replied, \"What's wrong with divorcee? Can't they get married again after getting divorced? Open mouth and close mouth, you uttered broken shoes. If you have the ability, go to Auntie Xiu Zhi and say this!\"The woman's face went red and white.Liu Cui Hua didn't talk nonsense with these nosy women and squeezed out of the crowd.The engagement was too urgent and there were so many things to prepare. How could she have time to talk nonsense with them!Soon, the news that Wang Yan Sheng was going to marry Qiao Hong Xia as his wife spread throughout the production team. It became the production team's hottest topic for a while.Some people thought Wang Yan Sheng was blind. He chose a broken shoe after thousand of choices.Some people felt that Wang Yan Sheng wasn't interested in Qiao Hong Xia at all. But rather, Qiao Family's connections.Anyway, no one believed that Wang Yan Sheng had a crush on Qiao Hong Xia.Fang Xiao Juan was stunned for a while after knowing this. This was because Wang Yan Sheng never married Qiao Hong Xia in her previous life.Qiao Hong Xia never got divorced in her last life. After her stupid son died, she stabbed few of Zhao Family to death before committing suicide. At that time, this incident caused a sensation in the entire county. Qiao Family couldn't raise their heads because of this incident for many years.In her previous life, because of this incident, her ex-father-in-law, Xue Chuan, was even more ill because of it. He passed away in less than a year. Then Qiao Xiu Zhi followed him.As for Wang Yan Sheng, it was heard that he got married in the army when he was in his thirties. Later, he got divorced. After the divorce, he lived alone with a daughter. Never remarried in his life.A lot of changes had taken place in this life. Qiao Hong Xia's son didn't die. She didn't stab anyone in Zhao Family. Instead, she was divorced. Now she hooked up with Wang Yan Sheng.About Qiao Hong Xia marrying Wang Yan Sheng, Fang Xiao Juan wasn't envious at all.She was very afraid of Wang Yan Sheng. Besides, her Meng Hong Guang wasn't any worse than Wang Yan Sheng!In a few days, when everyone knows that she is going to marry into the city, everyone will envy her even more!As for Xiao Qiao. Seeing Qiao Family's days were getting better and better, her eyes were red with anger!...That night, Qiao's small house's Pi Pi barked again.Qiao Hong Xia thought of what happened to Wang Yan Sheng last time. She quickly got up and went out with a flashlight.Walking into the yard, she heard Wang Yan Sheng whispering. However, Pi Pi wasn't familiar with him. Instead, he growled louder and louder. He revealed his sharp tooth, looking very fierce!Qiao Hong Xia was afraid of waking up other people, so she hurriedly halted Pi Pi. Then, she walked to the gate of the courtyard and said with a blushing face, \"Why are you here so late?\"Wang Yan Sheng's eyes landed on her face. His gaze was burning hot: \"I'm here to explain something to you. I'm afraid you will misunderstand!\"The matter of him marrying her had immediately spread and the production had a lot of rumors. He was worried about her hearing those rumors and misunderstood him. Which then result in her not being his wife!He tossed and turned on the bed. The more he thought about it, the more worried he became. So he came over before dawn.Qiao Hong Xia had heard those rumors: \"Then what do you think?\"Wang Yan Sheng solemnly stated: \"The person I want to marry is you. It has nothing to do with who your family are related to!\"Qiao Hong Xia's face turned red with a swoosh. She lowered her head and dared not look into his eyes: \"Since you have a clear conscience, then don't mind what others say!\"When she first heard those rumors, she did have some doubts in her heart. But soon it subsided.Qiao Family and Shen Family were just god-relatives. Qiao Family won't ask Shen Family for help. Even if Shen Family is willing to, they may not be able to intervene in the army affairs.That's why people in the production team were just jealous that she, a 'broken shoe' could marry such a good man and uttered sour words that disgust people everywhere!When Wang Yan Sheng heard her response, he breathed a sigh of relief: \"It's good that you didn't misunderstand! I'm afraid that you will misunderstand and then you won't marry me!\"Seeing how nervous he was, Qiao Hong Xia couldn't help burst into laughter: \"Why are you nervous? Even if I don't marry you, what girl aren't you able to marry with your condition? Did you not hear the villager say you are blind?\"Wang Yan Sheng: \"I just want to marry you as my wife. No matter how wonderful other is, I don't want them!\"After saying this, his face turned red.Qiao Hong Xia's face was so hot that she could fry an egg. The two looked at each other. The lovey-dovey feel between them heated up.Pi Pi opened his big watery eyes. He looked at the faces of the two with confusion and curiosity.Lin Hui had woken up long ago .She deliberately didn't come out to let the two of them talk. After waiting for a long time and Qiao Hong Xia still hadn't come in, she had to remind her, \"Hong Xia, who is outside?\"Only then did Qiao Hong Xia come back to her sense. She replied with a guilty conscience, \"No one. Just Pi Pi randomly barking.\"The accused Pi Pi let out two aggrieved 'woo'.Qiao Hong Xia turned back and urged him: \"Quickly go back.\"Wang Yan Sheng was still looking at her: \"You rest early. I'll come back tomorrow!\"\"Okay.\"...The next day was the day that Wang Yan Sheng came to Qiao's house for engagement. It happened to be the Dragon Boat Festival too.Wang Yan Sheng was indeed very capable. With such a short time, he can still come up with so many things.There were tobacco, alcohol, two cans of malted milk extract, canned oranges that children like to eat, and dozens of jins of pork. This engagement was very appealing!People in the village noticed Wang Yan Sheng carrying large bag and small bag into the door of Qiao's old house early in the morning. Their heart were bubbling with sourness. Some girls' vision went red from jealousy.Qiao Hong Xia specially wore a new dress today. When she saw Wang Yan Sheng coming, she peeked at him from a distance before turning around and went into the kitchen to do her work.Wang Yan Sheng watched her slender back. His heart burned. He could not wait to marry her home immediately!Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan didn't care about the large and small bags of gift on the table. Wang Yan Sheng's ability to prepare so many things in such a short period of time not only proved his ability, but also showed that he valued Hong Xia.So both of them were very satisfied.Facing his future father-in-law and mother-in-law, Wang Yan Sheng was so nervous that his palms were sweating: \"Dad, Mom, I will treat Hong Xia well in the future. I'll do my best to make them mother and son have a good life!\"Qiao Zhen Guo, who was on the side, amusedly spoke, \"Old Third Wang, you already changed the addressing before marrying. You must be hen-picked in the future!\"Wang Yan Sheng's wheat-colored face flushed red: \"It's not a bad thing to be hen-pecked.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi said, \"I hope you can remember what you said and treat the mother and son well. If you dare to treat them badly, my fist will never be polite to you!\"Wang Yan Sheng saw his future mother-in-law's fist and thought of the wild boar that was rumored to be beaten to death by one punch. His whole body tensed up and rapidly nodded his head. \"Mom, don't worry. I will definitely keep my words.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi was satisfied: \"Stay for lunch later.\"Wang Yan Sheng was greatly relieved when he heard this. He passed!After he came out, he went to find Qiao Hong Xia. Qiao Hong Xia was too shy to talk to him in front of her family and drove him out. He could only go please his future son.Little Yi Ming was following behind Da Qiao at the moment. The group was going to catch crayfish by the stream.Wang Yan Sheng came over and spoke, \"Are you guys trying to catch crayfish? Do you want me to help you?\"Da Qiao raised her head and said softly, \"Are you great at it?\"Wang Yan Sheng saw the little girl in front of him had fair skin and big eyes like black grapes. He wondered how the countryside have such good-looking children.He modestly responded, \"I'm alright.\"Little Yi Ming remarked: \"Alright basically means no good. As expected, you're as great as Elder Sister Da Qiao!\"In little Yi Ming's eyes, there was nothing his elder sister Da Qiao couldn't do. She was the best at anything!Wang Yan Sheng squatted down and said very patiently: \"I may not be as good as your elder sister, but I want to go with you. Is that alright?\"Little Yi Ming blinked his small eyes and answered in his baby voice, \"Okay, but you have to be obedient Don't run around. Got to listen Elder Sister Da Qiao, understand?\"Wang Yan Sheng, who was lectured to be obedient, sweated. In the end he 'obediently' nodded: \"Okay.\"Little Yi Ming patted him on the shoulder, \"Good boy. Later, I'll give you some candy!\"Wang Yan Sheng: \"...\"On this day, many people in the production team witnessed Wang Yan Sheng following a group of Qiao Family's children to catch crayfish by the stream. There was no sight of impatience on his face. Instead, he got along very well with Qiao Family.Wang Yan Sheng was really good at catching crayfish. Unfortunately, Da Qiao got better luck. As long as she stood there, the crayfishes would crawl toward her and get into the bamboo basket she threw in.\"Younger Sister Da Qiao, you really are loved by everything. Even the crayfishes will run over automatically when they see you!\"An Ping was envious. How come he didn't have such a skill?Da Qiao didn't understand why. But when she saw these small crayfishes, her mind was on how she would be able to eat meat in a while Her eyes merrily curved into crescent.Children from other families in the production team also came to catch crayfish. However, their luck was really bad compared to Qiao Family. Most of them only caught a few. They were very envious of Qiao Family.After catching two full crates of crayfish, Qiao Family's children were satisfied and ran home with a smile.Da Qiao volunteered to go into the kitchen and made a pot of spicy crayfish for everyone to eat. The flavor was so fragrant that everyone almost swallowed their tongues.After lunch, Da Qiao secretly went to the pigsty with three sticky rice dumplings and a small pot of crayfish.Seeing so much food, Huo Chi couldn't help swallowing: \"You made this crayfish?\"Da Qiao puffed out her small chest and proudly pointed at the small baby bag: \"My cooking skills were learned from my grandfather. It's amazing!\"Huo Chi wanted to laugh every time he saw her compliment herself: \"You are so immodest. Didn't your teacher teach you not to be complacent?\"Da Qiao blinked her long and dense eyelashes, \"But my grandmother said that I am confident. Not complacent. What's more, I am amazing. Why can't I praise myself?\"This sounded quite reasonable. Huo Chi was immediately rendered speechless by the question.On her return from the pigsty, Da Qiao saw Fifth Aunt walking towards the clinic with two glutinous rice dumpling in her hands.She called her, but unfortunately the other party didn't hear it. So she could only give up.As soon as Chen Qiao Qiao opened the door of the clinic, she was pulled in by the person inside.She screamed in fright: \"What are you doing? It would be bad if people seen!\"Tian Jian Ming lowered his head and took a bite on her lips. He lowly chuckled, \"What are you afraid of? Who will come to the clinic at this time?\"Chen Qiao Qiao was scared, while her heart felt sweeten: \"Lock the door first. If not, don't touch me!\"\"Okay, my little ancestor. I'll lock it now, alright?\" Tian Jian Ming kissed her again before letting go. He turned around and locked the door.After locking the door, he turned to pick up Chen Qiao Qiao and walked to the inside ward.Soon there was a red-faced gasping sound in the ward.Da Qiao returned to Qiao's old house and heard an important news. Future Third Uncle was going to take them to the town to take pictures!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Confusion spun around in their small eyes.Seeing them like this, everyone couldn't help but laugh.Lin Hui came over and explained, \"Taking pictures is like drawing your face with a camera, but it's not the same as painting. The pictures taken by the camera are exactly the real people.\"\"Wow, it sounds amazing!\" Da Qiao expressed her shock. There was such a magical thing in this world!\"Amazing! Sounds amazing!\" The two followers, Little Yi Ming and little Dong Lin quickly echoed.In fact, they didn't understand at all how awesome it was. Anyway, since Elder Sister Da Qiao said it was amazing, it must be amazing.Wang Yan Sheng came over and asked the children, \"Then do you want to go?\"\"Want!\"\"I want to going!\"\"I'm also going!\"With so many children talking over each other, the roof was about to be overturned.Seeing that little Wan'er didn't answer, Lin Hui teased her: \"Little Wan'er, what about you? Do you want to go?\"Little Wan'er pursed her lips and hid behind Da Qiao like a shy little animal.During this time, little Wan'er's temperament had changed a lot. Although she won't interact with people like a normal child, she can at least react to other people's words. On top of that, she liked sticking to Da Qiao.That was to say, Da Qiao had three tails now. Her team was obviously still growing.Da Qiao held her younger sister's hand and softly asked her, \"Little Wan'er, do you want to go with Elder Sister?\"Little Wan'er didn't know where she was going or what she was going to do. She would be very happy as long as she could be with her elder sister. So she nodded lightly and whispered, \"Want.\"If Qiao Zhen Min saw little Wan'er like this, he would be so happy that he would cry.Because there were too many children going, Qiao Xiu Zhi had to follow. If not the two adults, Qiao Hong Xia and Wang Yan Sheng, wasn't enough to take care of them.Xue Chuan came over to his wife and said, \"We have never taken photos together. Later, let's make up for our wedding photo.\"At the beginning, Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't plan to take pictures. But now after hearing her husband's suggestion, she immediately agreed: \"Okay, I'll go in and wash up. Can't be covered in dust all over.\"Qiao Zhen Guo saw that his parents were going and wanted to join in too. Unfortunately there would be no one left at home then. So he was forced to stay.Seeing that everyone went to take pictures, Wan Chun Ju felt very uncomfortable on the inside: \"Does their conscience not hurt leaving me at home alone?\"Qiao Zhen Guo sighed, \"Come to think of this of it, it's all your fault. You had to have your confinement now out of all time when everyone is going to take pictures. I don't even get to go!\"Was it her decision when to have a baby?Wan Chun Ju was almost pissed off to death by her man's words. She took a deep breath and said, \"Zhen Guo, we haven't taken a wedding photo before. Why don't we take one when I'm done with my confinement?\"Qiao Zhen Guo glanced at her figure. She had gained weight again. He shook his head: \"Forget it.\"What did this mean? Was he disdaining her bad look?Wan Chun Ju almost vomited blood!The group set off. When they passed the health center, Qiao Hong Xia spoke, \"I don't know if Qiao Qiao is still in there. Why don't we go in and let her know?\"Although Chen Qiao Qiao didn't care about her daughter, little Wan'er, it was better to tell her since they were taking little Wan'er away. Least to avoid conflict later.Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded: \"Then you go over. We'll wait for you here.\"Qiao Hong Xia acknowledged, took two steps, and found Wang Yan Sheng following her.\"I'll accompany you there.\" Wang Yan Sheng looked at her and told.Qiao Hong Xia's eyes drooped. She looked at the ground and said, \"It's only two steps away. What need is there for accompaniment?\"Wang Yan Sheng's ears warmed: \"Actually, I want to say a few more words to you.\"He will return to the army tomorrow. The separation may last until their marriage. So he had to seize every opportunity to interact with her.When Qiao Hong Xia heard his words, the corner of her mouth raised slightly. Her heart felt as sweetened as eating honey.When they reached the clinic, they surprisingly found the door was closed. One must know that the door of this clinic was rarely closed.Qiao Hong Xia went up and knocked twice. She shouted, \"Is anyone inside?\"The two people inside who were deep in their fight, heard the shouts and almost rolled off the bed in fright.Chen Qiao Qiao grabbed the sheet. She was so nervous that she almost cried: \"That's my third sister's voice! What should I do? Did she find something?\"Tian Jian Ming got off the bed and comforted her while putting on clothes: \"Don't scare yourself. Put on your clothes first. Don't come out yet. I'll go out and see what's going on?\"Chen Qiao Qiao nodded with a pale face. Tremblingly, she got up from the bed and put on clothes. Her body was covered with hickeys.Tian Jian Ming went out, pretending to have just been woken up, and opened the door: \"Where are you unwell?\"Qiao Hong Xia answered, \"We aren't here to see the doctor. We are Chen Qiao Qiao's family. Is she inside?\"Tian Jian Ming yawned again, shook his head and said, \"Today is the Dragon Boat Festival. The clinic got half day off. She didn't come.\"As soon as these words fell, he noticed that next to Qiao Hong Xia was a man whose gaze stared passed him and landed on the table inside. He turned around and followed his line of sight. Two glutinous rice dumplings stood out on the table. These were brought over by Chen Qiao Qiao just now.Though he groaned in his heart, he quickly calmed down: \"Oh, that's weird. Where did these rice glutinous dumplings come from?\"Qiao Hong Xia spoke: \"My fifth sister-in-law said that you weren't going back to celebrate the festival with your family today. So she brought two glutinous rice dumplings from home for you. She never returned. I thought she was in the health center.\"Tian Jian Ming showed a grateful expression: \"That explains it. Thank you so much! No one came to see the doctor today, so I went to take a nap after lunch. Maybe she came in, saw me resting, put the things down, and went back. Maybe she stumbled somewhere.\"Qiao Hong Xia nodded: \"Since she's not here, then forget it.\"After speaking, she raised her head and glanced at Wang Yan Sheng. The two turned to leave.Just as they turned around, there was a \"bang\" coming from inside. As if something had been knocked to the ground.The two subconsciously turned to look back.A flash of panic flashed on Tian Jian Ming's face. He said with an embarrassed smile: \"The mice in this clinic are really getting more and more rampant. Later, I will tell Leader and ask him to bring a cat over here to raise.\"Qiao Hong Xia glanced at him before leaving with Wang Yan Sheng.Tian Jian Ming was greatly relieved when he saw them leave. He closed the door and walked back: \"What happened to you just now? They almost discovered!\"Chen Qiao Qiao replied with red eyes: \"I accidentally bumped into the table. Is my third sister gone?\"Tian Jian Ming nodded as recalled Qiao Hong Xia's bright facial features. His heart was a little turbulent: \"Your third sister-in-law has been living in her parents' home since the divorce. Doesn't she plan to marry?\"Chen Qiao Qiao had a slender figure and dull facial features. If he hadn't found a good target, he would definitely not take a fancy to such tasteless woman like her.Compared with that woman just now, that woman had a good-looking face as well as a very hot body. Especially those bulging peaches. If he can kiss them, he must be in ecstasy!Chen Qiao Qiao didn't know what he was thinking and indifferently said: \"She is engaged to the production leader's younger brother. Just today.\"Tian Jian Ming paused for a moment. He remembered the man standing behind her just now and immediately dismissed the idea of targeting Qiao Hong Xia.The man just now had such an imposing air. At one glance, one can tell he wasn't easy to provoke. He liked to provoke women everywhere, but he cared about his life more. So forget it.Chen Qiao Qiao tightly grabbed the corner of her clothes. There was struggle on her face: \"We... let's not do any more in the future. I can't wrong my husband any more!\"Tian Jian Ming grabbed her hands and kissed them: \"I understand your difficulties. I can only grumble that I didn't get to know you earlier. I respect your choice. We will only be comrades in the future!\"Chen Qiao Qiao bit her lips and looked at him with tears in her eyes. It felt like her heart was torn in half.On the one hand, she didn't want to divorce. She still had feelings for Qiao Zhen Min. On the other hand, she was trapped in Tian Jian Ming's gentleness and wished to be with him day and night!In the end, she ran away with red eyes. Qiao Hong Xia dared to divorce because she had a pair of parents who supported her. If she dared to divorce, her parents would definitely cut ties with her!Wang Yan Sheng and Qiao Hong Xia walked back.Wang Yan Sheng stated with a serious expression, \"That man was lying just now!\"Qiao Hong Xia froze for a moment: \"Lie? What lie did he say?\"Wang Yan Sheng said: \"When he spoke, his eyes were dodging around and his expression was flustered. It's obvious that he was lying. There should be someone hiding in the room. Not mice.\"Qiao Hong Xia let out an \"ah\". Then her cheeks turned red: \"It's heard that Doctor Tian has a match arranged by his family. It may be his fiancee who came to see him.\"Wang Yan Sheng nodded. Both of them thought Tian Jian Ming's fiancee was hidden inside.Nowadays, even when men and women were engaged, they shouldn't be too intimate. Otherwise they will have a bad reputation. They can understand why Tian Jian Ming lied just now....Because there were too many children and it was getting late, they caught a ride from the community to the town.They were lucky. The bus arrived in the town shortly upon their arrival. Adult cost two dimes, teen like Qiao Dong He were half the price, one dime. Little Wan'er and other small ones cost no money. Of course, they couldn't occupy a seat.Wang Yan Sheng was very perceptive. He rushed to pay the money.Qiao Hong Xia glanced at him and said with a blushing face, \"I'll return the money to you later.\"Wang Yan Sheng's gaze was burning: \"My money is your money. You can spend it however you want. You don't have to give it back to me!\"Qiao Hong Xia blushed even more.The conductor usually don't have good attitude. She had quarreled with her man last night. This was why she feel uncomfortable at the sight of others throwing dog food. She bellowed in a rough voice: \"What are you doing? Don't want to sit, then get off!\"These days, public sector employees had horrible attitude. This was no surprise to everyone.Wang Yan Sheng raised his head and gave her a cold stare. The conductor shivered a bit, like chicken that was strangled by the neck. She did not dare to squawk.The road to the town was bumpy. After an hour, they finally arrived at the town after an hour.When Da Qiao got out of the vehicle, she immediately told the three little tails: \"You three little ones must follow the adults. You mustn't run around alone, understand?\"\"Understood. We will closely follow Elder Sister Da Qiao!\" Little Dong Lin and little Yi Ming said in unison.It was unknown what little Wan'er thought of. Her body shivered a little and she clenched her elder sister's hand tightly.Qiao Hong Xia directed to her parents, \"Da Qiao act more and more like a big sister.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan looked at each other and smiled. Both saw pride in each other's eyes.There was only one photo studio in the town. The scale is very small. Only one small room. When Qiao Family group went over, the owner of the photo studio was idly catching flies.Taking a picture was a dime for each print. Most people can't even eat enough these days. So very few people were willing to pay for this.When the boss saw that there was a business approaching his door, he suddenly became energetic: \"Are you here to take a family photo?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded: \"I want to take family photo, wedding photo, individual photo, and group photo.\"\"Okay. No problem. Come on in.\" When the boss heard that they were going to take so many pictures, the smile on his face became even brighter.The boss got them to take a whole group photo first. Then other photos can be taken after this was done. It wasn't convenient to have so many people inside.When taking the whole group photo, Wang Yan Sheng was excluded. Although he was already engaged to Qiao Hong Xia, he wasn't married yet. If something cropped up in the middle, should the photo be kept or thrown.Wang Yan Sheng looked at them with a little grievance in his heart. He vowed to himself that he would definitely join the family portrait next year.Boss told them to get to their positions according to his guidance and called out: \"Everyone smile for me. Like normal That boy, your expression is too exaggerated. Relax.\"The boy pointed out by the boss was none other than An Ping.Everyone turned their heads to look at An Ping and saw that he was grinning. His expression was stiff. He looked very funny. Everyone couldn't help laughing.Qiao Dong Ying patted him on the shoulder: \"Relax. See how I'll sort you out if the photo comes out hideous!\"\"Second Elder Sister, it's not that I don't want to relax. I'm really nervous!\" An Ping said with a stiff expression.This was his first time taking pictures. He really wanted to look good. But the more he wanted to take a good picture, the more nervous he became. This was the result.Qiao Dong Ying spun her eyes, stretched out her hand and pinched his arm fiercely, and An Ping yelled.\"Kacha...\"The boss took the opportunity to press the photo button: \"Okay, okay. Children go out and wait for a while. Next is the wedding photo.\"Nowadays, people liked to wear green military uniforms to take wedding photos. Qiao Xiu Xhi didn't want to wear them. But Xue Chuan said to take two photos. One in the clothes they were wearing now, and the other in green military uniforms. This should make up for the past regrets.Qiao Xiu Zhi had always been reluctant to go against her husband's words. So she nodded without any hesitation.The boss beamed even more happily and quickly took out the green uniforms for them to put on. By the way, there was also a little red flower. The costume was very complete.\"Okay, the two of you, put your heads together. Oh, yes, that's it. Don't move...\"\"Kacha!\"Soon Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan finished their shoot. Because there were too many people, they took Da Qiao and others to buy things nearby.Wang Yan Sheng suggested to Qiao Hong Xia to take an individual photo, another photo of her holding little Yi Ming, and another photo of the three of them.Qiao Hong Xia felt that this was a waste of money. She felt taking one group photo was enough. However, Wang Yan Sheng insisted. So Qiao Hong Xia had no choice but to agree with a blushing face.When it came to group of three photo, Qiao Hong Xia was like a red apple and stood half an arm's distance from Wang Yan Sheng.The boss frowned as soon as he saw this: \"What's going on? Why take a group photo while standing so far? Get closer, get closer. Aren't you one family? What are you shy about?\"Once these words dropped, two people came in from outside: \"Master, we want to take pictures.\"When Qiao Hong Xia heard the voice, she frowned and looked up...It was none other than her ex-husband Zhao Jie Fang and his current wife Xu Gui Ying.Qiao Hong Xia's face instantly sank and muttered, \"What bad luck!\"How can they encounter this pair of enemies every time they came to town!? What kind of fate was this!Wang Yan Sheng had seen Zhao Jie Fang once from a distance back then. Although he looked a lot older now, he still recognized him at a glance.Zhao Jie Fang and Xu Gui Ying didn't expect to meet Qiao Hong Xia and her son here.After Xu Gui Ying met Qiao Hong Xia in the town last time, she had a fight with Zhao Jie Fang at the supply and demand cooperative. After returning home, Zhao Jie Fang became more and more indifferent to her. He called Qiao Hong Xia's name a few times in his dreams.If she hadn't gotten Mother-in-law to put pressure on him, he might have gone to Qili production team to find them mother and son!She was so furious that she wanted to kill that vixen Qiao Hong Xia. They were already divorced and Zhao Jie Fang was still obsessed with her!Seeing her at this moment, love rival's jealousy flared up.She shook off Zhao Jie Fang's hand, walked over and said, \"Oh, isn't this Hong Xia? Are you guys here to take pictures?\"Qiao Hong Xia pulled little Yi Ming behind her and coldly stated, \"Don't come near me!\"Xu Gui Ying smiled proudly: \"Look at your guilty conscience. I'm not a tiger. I won't eat you. What are you afraid of?\"Qiao Hong Xia retorted: \"I'm not afraid of you. But your mouth is so stinky that it makes me want to vomit!\"\"You\u2026\u2026!\"Xu Gui Ying's face turned red and white with anger. Her chest heaved violently.\"This comrade, you should be Qiao Hong Xia's blind date, right?\"Her eyes suddenly turned and fell on Wang Yan Sheng. After looking up and down, she couldn't help but feel jealous. She was also a second-hand good. How could that vixen, Qiao Hong Xia be so lucky?Wang Yan Sheng nodded: \"Yes. What has it to do with you?\"Xu Gui Ying smiled so deep that her face wrinkled: \"Then do you know why Zhao Family had divorced Qiao Hong Xia?\"Wang Yan Sheng shook his head: \"Isn't it because her ex-husband is a cowardly trash and Zhao Family is despicable and shameless?\"Zhao Jie Fang's face flushed with anger. He really wanted to go up and beat the man. However, he was half a head shorter than him when he stood in front of the man. His body was obviously not strong enough, so he swallowed it down.Xu Gui Ying exaggeratedly smiled: \"Of course not. Zhao Family divorced this woman because she had an affair behind her ex-husband's back. Have you seen the child behind her? The child neither looks like her nor like her ex-husband. Clearly, the child looks like her lover. That's why Zhao Family divorced her. I advise you not to be deceived. Sooner you will be cuckold by such a woman if you marry her home!\"\"Shut up!\" Qiao Hong Xia flushed with fury. She wanted to go up and smoke Xu Gui Ying but was stopped by Wang Yan Sheng.She looked back at him in disbelief.Seeing this, Xu Gui Ying thought that the man had paid heed to her advice and instantly let out a pig laughed out a pig snort.Wang Yan Sheng pulled her behind him and said in a low voice, \"Don't get your hands dirty. I'll do it!\"After he finished speaking, he strode up, and grabbed Xu Gui Ying's neck. Exerting his strength, he actually lifted her up!Xu Gui Ying's feet were off the ground. Her neck was pinched. It became difficult to breathe.Her eyes popped out as big as bull's eyes. She panickily looked at demon-like man in front of her: \"You, you let me go...cough...Zhao Jie Fang...\"What kind of cowardly trash did she married? She was going to be strangled to death and he can still stand there like not happened!Damn, no wonder Qiao Hong Xia wanted to divorce him. She just picked up the garbage that Qiao Hong Xia didn't want!Xu Gui Ying's face turned white from being strangled. She vigorously kicked her legs.The boss was so frightened that his face turned pale: \"What are you doing? Comrade, if you don't let go, a life would be endangered!\"Little Yi Ming was a little frightened. He opened his small eyes, but he was brave enough not to cry.Qiao Hong Xia comforted her son before running over to stop Wang Yan Sheng: \"Forget it. It's not worth getting your hands dirty for this kind of person!\"Wang Yan Sheng threw Xu Gui Ying to the ground. Looking down at her, he stated, \"Hong Xia is now my fiancee. If you guys dare to pester her again in the future, or speak ill of her, it's best not to let me hear. Otherwise, you won't be as lucky next time!\"Xu Gui Ying was a person who bullied good and feared evil. She shook her head in fright: \"I don't dare. I don't dare anymore!\"Wang Yan Sheng turned his gaze to Zhao Jie Fang, \"Remember this. Although you are little Yi Ming's biological father, you can't harass them until little Yi Ming is eighteen. If not, I will let your Zhao Family have no place in the Red Maple production team! You'd better not question what I say. I have the ability to do what I say!\"Zhao Jie Fang's face turned red and white. His hands were clenched into fists.He wanted to say why. Even though he and Hong Xia divorced, little Yi Ming was his son. Why couldn't he see him?But this man stood there like a domineering mountain. His aura was so overwhelming that he couldn't breathe. He opened his mouth many times, but he didn't utter a word.Xu Gui Ying got up from the ground and spat on Zhao Jie Fang's face: \"I want to divorce you!\"Zhao Jie Fang stared at Qiao Hong Xia with a mouthful of pit on his face before turning his head to the side. In the end, he raised his hand to wipe his face, turned, and walked out.After Zhao Jie Fang left, Qiao Hong Xia said apologetically, \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have doubted you just now.\"Wang Yan Sheng lowered his head to her: \"I said I would take good care of you mother and son. Have confidence in me.\"Qiao Hong Xia: \"I won't doubt you anymore!\"Later on, Qiao Xiu Zhi found out about it. She nodded and said, \"It's a good thing that old Third Wang scared them. This way Zhao Family won't come to pester you mother and son.\"After taking the photos, they went to the supply and demand cooperative to buy things. Then, they made way to the food factory to visit Qiao Zhen Jun. After that, they caught a ride back to the production team.The next day, Wang Yan Sheng packed up and went back to the army.The weather was getting hotter and hotter. In a blink of an eye, it was time for the primary school graduation exam.At this time, Chen Qiao Qiao noticed her period hadn't arrived for more than a month.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was June. The time when winter wheat were ripened. The production teams were busy rushing to harvest the winter wheat.From June to August, it was the hottest time of the year. No matter how hot it was, one have to work. The production team would head out early to the scorching sun and return late every day. There was no combine harvester these days. One can only rely on their hands and sickle to harvest.After the winter wheat was harvested, it must be transported to the warehouse as soon as possible. If not, their big half year's work will be wasted if the rain drizzled on it.After harvesting the winter wheat, they can't stay idle either. Sorghum had to be quickly sow. This way, they can harvest another grain at the end of the year.Seeing that his family members became tan and thin at a speed visible to the naked eye, Da Qiao was very distressed. Every day, she put jade beads into the water or the food for everyone to eat.In addition, she had specially used some jade beads for Elder Cousin Sister Qiao Dong He to consume every day. Elder Cousin Sister need to go to town in the next two days to take the primary school graduation exam. She studied until late every day before going to bed as she feared that she will not be able to enter the junior high school.On June 15th, the county's primary schools welcomed its final exam. The graduating class's entrance exam was also scheduled on this day.That day, Xue Chuan and Qiao Xiu Zhi got up early in the morning and prepared two eggs for each of their grandchildren as well as a fried dough stick; hoping that they would each get 100 percent on their test.Fried dough sticks were not filling and oil-intensive. They generally don't make it at home. But Xue Chuan and Qiao Xiu Zhi both wanted to make the children happy and wish them good luck. So they woke up before dawn.Sure enough, the few children found it novel and were excited at the sight of fried dough sticks. They took a bite. So crunchy and tasty. Very flavorful!An Ping's mouth was full of fragrant food: \"Grandfather, Grandmother, it's really delicious. I think if I eat these things, I will definitely be able to come back with a 100% on the test!\"Qiao Dong Ying exposed him without leaving any face: \"Stop bragging. At your level, you want to get 100%!\"An Ping foolishly grinned: \"Why can't I? Add up Math and Chinese and it's 100%. I think I will definitely be fine!\"Everyone: \"...\"Alright, this was indeed 100%. What's more, he promised to score 40 points in each test before. If he can get 50 points in the test, it can be considered a superb performance.Da Qiao also liked this thing called fried dough sticks. She softly stated: \"Grandfather, Grandmother, I will bring back two 100% this time!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan smilingly looked at the children. Nodding, they responded, \"Okay, do your best. Especially Dong He. Treat it as a normal test. Don't be nervous!\"Hearing her grandfather and her grandmother's encouragement, her heart warmed. Just as she was about to open her mouth, she heard her dad speak...\"Dong He, you have to strive for success. It's up to you whether Dad can ride a bicycle this time!\"Qiao Dong He: \"...\" Immediately, she felt the pressure multiple.Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at her stupid son and speechlessly rolled her eyes: \"From now on, don't talk. Go to the field after eating.\"Qiao Zhen Guo innocently asked: \"Mom, didn't you ask me to send Dong He and the rest to the exam?\"Why was he disqualified? What's more, forbidden to speak! What did he do wrong?Qiao Xiu Zhi couldn't bother to respond to this stupid son: \"Stop wasting words. Just do as I say!\"If she really got him to send the chilren, Qiao Dong He can probably forget about taking the exam!...Those who worked went to the field. Those who needed to go to school went. The house was quiet. Chen Qiao Qiao walked out of the room with a pale face.Her hands were shaking. Every step she took seemed to be stepping on the clouds. Qiao You Rou watched her come out and barked at her twice. Startled. she kicked all the mung beans that were drying in the yard to the ground.Wan Chun Ju heard the movement and came out with her little daughter in her arms. She tutted: \"Qiao Qiao, what are you doing? You can kick down such a big bamboo sieve. Do you walk without eyes?\"Chen Qiao Qiao didn't respond her. She didn't even give her a glance. She hurriedly swept the mung beans on the ground into the bamboo sieve, stood up, and rushed out of the house.Wan Chun Ju watched her run as if a ghost was chasing her and pouted: \"So suspicious. She must have done something shameful!\"After she finished speaking, she lowered her head and kissed her little daughter's face: \"Little Yun Yun, do you think Mom is right? Isn't little butt Chen Qiao Qiao acting weird?\"\"Pu\u2026\u2026\"In response, little Dong Yun spat at her mom with saliva.Wan Chun Ju wasn't angry. Instead, she laughed even more joyfully: \"Oh, my sweetheart is smart. You can understand Mom's words at such a young age. Once you grow up, you will definitely get 100% in the test. More excellent than that bootlicker Da Qiao!\"Chen Qiao Qiao ran out of Qiao's house and listlessly came to the clinic. The moment she saw Tian Jian Ming, her tears almost spilled.Because there were patients in the clinic, she could only force her tears back.After finally waiting for the villagers to leave, she choked out with red eyes: \"Jian Ming, I have something to tell you!\"Tian Jian Ming lowered his head to pack his things. Without even raising his head to look at her, he replied: \"What's the matter? Tell me. However, you should call me Doctor Tian in the future. It will be bad if others hear and misunderstand, right?\"Since he got her, he had lost interest in her. Not to mention, he will get married in two months. He planned to distance himself from Chen Qiao Qiao.Chen Qiao Qiao sensed his indifference. Her heart felt someone had poured cold water over her head in the cold winter: \"Jian...I, I haven't got that for more than a month.\"Tian Jian Ming didn't process it yet: \"What haven't you got?\"Seeing that he didn't look at her from beginning to end, Chen Qiao Qiao felt more and more aggrieved. Tears flowed down with a swoosh: \"That woman's thing, I... I may be pregnant!\"\"BANG\"!The enamel tank in Tian Jian Ming's hand fell to the ground. The water splashed out, soaking the uppers part of his shoes.He finally raised his head to look at her. His eyes widened as if he had encountered a ghost: \"What did you just say? Comrade Chen, this kind of thing can't be used as a joke!\"Chen Qiao Qiao clenched her hands into fists: \"I'm not kidding. I haven't got that for a month and a half!\"Her menstruation had always been quite accurate. This time, since the first day of delay, she felt very uneasy. She always hoped that this delay would only be due to a physical problem. But now it was half a month late. She can't continue to deceive herself!Tian Jian Ming's expression finally changed: \"You... Are you sure this baby is mine?\"They had only been in bed three or four times. He had carefully done it out every time. Logically speaking, she shouldn't be pregnant.\"SLAP!\"Chen Qiao Qiao slapped him with a flushed face: \"Tian Jian Ming, how can you say such thing to hurt my heart?\"He knew that Qiao Zhen Min hadn't come back during this period of time. So when he said this, he was clearly doubting her innocence!A flash of anger flashed in Tian Jian Ming's eyes. But he quickly returned to gentle Doctor Tian of the past: \"Qiao Qiao, I'm not doubting you. I'm just worried that you made a mistake. After all, when we did that thing, I always didn't\u2026\u2026\"The following words were too explicit. Tian Jian Ming didn't say it. Both of them knew it well.When Chen Qiao Qiao heard him say this, she felt a little better: \"Can't be wrong. My monthly thing has always been on time. But now it's been late for half a month. I must be pregnant!\"Tian Jian Ming inwardly cursed. Seeing no one outside, he grabbed her hand and coaxed, \"Qiao Qiao, you know I really want to marry you. But it's a pity we met too late. If we got together, my fiancee's side and Qiao Family won't let us go. Everyone's spit will drown us. So... this child mustn't be born!\"Chen Qiao Qiao felt that her heart was about to be broken. She was so looking forward to being able to conceive another child. But now she was pregnant but cannot give birth!She cried and trembled.While comforting her, Tian Jian Ming paid attention to the movement outside: \"Qiao Qiao, if you really can't bear this child, I have a good idea.\"Chen Qiao Qiao raised her head and said with red eyes, \"What?\"Tian Jian Ming pushed his glasses, \"Didn't you always want to have another child with your husband? You've only been pregnant for more than a month. Immediately, pack up and find your man. When you are about to give birth, create an accident and pretend that it's a premature birth.\"Chen Qiao Qiao's heart rapidly thumped: \"This... isn't good?\"Tian Jian Ming spoke: \"Didn't you say that your man isn't good that aspect? With his ability, you may not be able to conceive another child in this life. Now that this baby is here, isn't it God's will?\"Thinking of letting other men raise a son for him, Tian Jian Ming suddenly felt an inexplicable excitement in his heart.Chen Qiao Qiao bit her lower lip as she internally struggled.Tian Jian Ming's words hit the point she was most worried about.After Qiao Zhen Min was injured there, their husband and wife's life wasn't very exciting. In addition, the two of them separate more than being together. She was very worried that she wouldn't be able to give birth to a son in her life!If Qiao Zhen Min never gets better, then this child is likely to be her only hope!Tian Jian Ming saw that her heart was moved and he pushed on: \"Time waits for no one. You have to make a decision quickly. Otherwise it will be difficult to do it when your belly grows!\"Chen Qiao Qiao looked up at him. When she was about to speak, there was a voice outside. The two quickly separated.Because of the hot weather, many people fell ill from heat stroke. The number of people who came to the health center to see a doctor was many times higher than before. Chen Qiao Qiao was in a trance. She either took the wrong medicine or hurt the villagers. The villagers were very dissatisfied with this.Still, Tian Jian Ming never scolded her from beginning to end. After the patients left, he patiently comforted her. This made her love Tian Jian Ming again.If she could give birth to Tian Jian Ming and her child, it would be considered as their love product. So when the setting sun dyed the whole sky red, she finally made up her mind...She was going to give birth to this baby!...Back at Qiao's old house, white smoke was already puffing out of the chimney. Bursts of fragrance wafted out of the stove.In order to reward those who went to the field and nourish the children, Lin Hui came to the old home to cook.The food made by Wan Chun Ju was too unpalatable. No one in the family wanted to eat the food she made.Lin Hui spread out a large portion of egg pancakes, which were made from sweet potato flour and eggs. It was eaten together with pickled veg. It was novel and delicious. Everyone liked it very much.The most popular one was braised pork with preserved veg. The most important part in making braised pork with preserved veg was flavor soaking in. If the flavor didn't penetrate through, it would taste no different from ordinary meat.In order to make the meat taste good, Lin Hui steamed the meat for a few hours in advance. When everyone came back, she steamed the meat again. The taste was perfect.Excluding Xue Chuan, Lin Hui's cooking skill was the best in the family. This braised pork belly with preserved vegetables was shiny and red. Not like some people's black end product. The pork was soft and fragrant. Oily but not greasy. The preserved veg was sweet and chewy. When eaten together, the taste was so fragrant that people can't wait to eat the whole bowl.\"It's so delicious! Second Aunt, I really admire your cooking skills!\" An Ping smacked his lips while eating.Lin Hui smiled with curved eyes: \"Eat more if you like it.\"\"I will. You don't have to worry. I will definitely not be polite!\" An Ping responded.Seeing him like this, everyone couldn't help but laugh.Da Qiao gave her mom a piece of meat and urged, \"Mom, eat more so that you won't starve little brothers!\"Lin Hui laughed even more deeply and clipped her a piece of meat, \"Okay. You eat more too. How's your exam today?\"Da Qiao softly answered, \"I think it's quite simple.\"She could do all the questions on the test paper. After she was done, she checked it twice. After all tha, she was still the first person to submit the test paper. If nothing else happen, she should get two 100% this time.Hearing this, An Ping almost burst into tears.This was so heartbreaking for a study scum!When Qiao Zhen Guo heard this, he quickly asked his eldest daughter, \"Dong He, how about you? Do you think it's easy too?\"Qiao Dong He: \"...Dad, I don't think it's easy. But I did it all.\"Younger Sister Da Qiao's brain was so good that she can learn anything at a glance and never forget it. While, she can't. She had to read the same article many times to remember it.The hard work pays off. Everyone said that the questions in this exam were very difficult. Many people didn't complete them, while she did. She felt that she didn't be too bad in the test.Qiao Zhen Guo was relieved: \"It's great that you did it all. As long as you can get into junior high school, Dad will be able to ride a bicycle!\"Qiao Dong He: \"...\" It can't be that her dad cared about her for the bicycle?Everyone was chatting and laughing. The atmosphere was very harmonious. Only Chen Qiao Qiao sat alone, like an outsider.After dinner, everyone enjoyed the cool air in the yard.After Chen Qiao Qiao washed the dishes, she walked over clenching the corner of her clothes and spoke, \"Dad, Mom, Zhen Min hasn't come back for almost two months. I want to visit him in the county.\"As soon as these words came out, everyone was quiet. Their eyes fell on her.Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at her and said, \"What about the work in the clinic? There are so many people who are sick recently. Can you walk away?\"Chen Qiao Qiao groaned in her heart. Squeezing out a smile, she replied, \"I told Doctor Tian about this. Doctor Tian said that he can handle it all by himself.\"Wan Chun Ju pouted and commented, \"If he can handle it all by himself, why did he hire you before?\"Chen Qiao Qiao always felt that Wan Chun Ju's words had hidden meaning. She was so nervous that her heart was about to jump out: \"Actually, it's not about handling it. But I insisted on asking for leave. He couldn't refuse, so he agreed.\"Wan Chun Ju responded with a \"tsk\": \"So, Doctor Tian is really kind to you.\"Chen Qiao Qiao's face immediately flushed: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, what do you mean by saying this? Are you trying to say that I have a shameful relationship with Doctor Tian? If you keep talking nonsense, I'll fight with you!\"Her voice was high-pitched and sharp, like the sound of fingernails scratching against the glass. Very harsh to the ear.But what was even more strange was her attitude. Although Wan Chun Ju's words just now were a bit inappropriate, she wouldn't make a dig with her IQ and personality. If she really suspect she have a relationship with Doctor Tian, she would definitely point it out directly.Little Dong Yun woke up with a fright and wailed out with a \"waa\". Her face flushed from crying.Wan Chun Ju hurriedly coaxed her little daughter.Once little Dong Yun was coaxed, she raised her head and retorted, \"Are you seeking death? Don't you know loud noise can scare my little Yun Yun? Also, when did I say you had an affair with Doctor Tian? Could it be that you have done something shameful and have a guilty conscience?\"Wan Chun Ju treasured her little daughter, little Dong Yun now. Not only because she wanted to train her to become the next Da Qiao, but also because little daughter looked too much like her.Little Dong Yun's appearance seem to be from the same mold as hers. The more she looked at her, the more beautiful she looked and the more she loved her. Gradually she really put her daughter in her heart.People were like this. Once they put a lot of energy and affection into a person or thing, the more invested they were. As well, the less they can let go.Chen Qiao Qiao was so pissed that she bit her lower lip tightly. Her eyes reddened: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, if you keep talking nonsense, I...I'll...\"Wan Chun Ju snorted coldly from her nostrils: \"What will you do? Do you want to berate or fight? Just say it. This lady have never been afraid!\"\"All you shut up!\" Qiao Xiu Zhi coldly hollered, \"If you want to fight, go out. You don't have to come back after you finish!\"Wan Chun Ju shrank her neck and didn't dare to speak any more. She secretly sent Chen Qiao Qiao a grudgeful gaze.Chen Qiao Qiao felt aggrieved!She felt that her mother-in-law was biased. It was obviously Wan Chun Ju who started it. And she got scolded along with her. She really couldn't stay in this house!Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at her youngest daughter-in-law, \"If you want to go, then go. It's just that old Fifth's work often involves business trips. You'd better make a phone call before you go. If he's not in the county city, you're not going there for nothing, no?\"When Chen Qiao Qiao heard this, it seemed as if someone had knocked her head hard. She almost fell to the ground.Why hadn't she thought of this before?If Qiao Zhen Min wasn't in the county city, what should she do?Her belly can't wait too long!At this moment, Da Qiao brewed a pot of flower tea she made with roses and came over. Qiao Dong He was behind her, holding a plate of garlic-flavored green beans.All the roses and jasmines she got from old Mister Shen had bloomed. She picked all the flower buds, washed them, soaked them in salt water for half an hour, and then took them out to dry. They were left under the sun for four to five days. Only then, one can get rose tea and jasmine tea.This method was taught to her by old Mister Shen before. It can preserve the flowers well.She felt this method was very good. She watered these flowers with jade bead water every day. If they were used to make tea, it should be good for the body. She planned to send a few jars of it to Godmother and the others later.Seeing this, Lin Hui smiled softly: \"Da Qiao is really become more and more capable. Will definitely be a good elder sister in the future!\"When Da Qiao heard this, her little face flushed with joy. Her little proud expression on her face was very cute.Qiao Dong He, who was behind, followed up and said, \"Younger Sister Da Qiao is really amazing now. She made this plate of garlic-flavored green beans. It's so fragrant!\"These green beans were previously planted in Qiao Family's private plot. After harvesting, the plot was all planted with Chinese herbal medicine.These green beans were also watered with jade bead water. Not to mention that the beans were at its max size, they tasted fragrant and sweet. Many times better than other people's.An Ping smelled it and almost drooled. He quickly grabbed a small handful and threw it into his mouth: \"It's really delicious! Younger Sister Da Qiao, can you make me some more later?\"As soon as his voice fell, Da Qiao heard a retching voice behind her before she could answer.Everyone looked up and saw Chen Qiao Qiao squatting on the ground. Her face turning white from retching.Everyone was eating, but she was retching by the side. This was a bit overboard!Chen Qiao Qiao was afraid that everyone would see something. So she stood up and explained, \"I'm sorry. I'm a little uncomfortable... Yuck...\"Before she could finish speaking, she ran into the room with her mouth covered. The sound of retching kept coming from the room.Wan Chun Ju curled her lips and remarked, \"With the way she retches, clueless people would think she's pregnant. Hmph, I think she's deliberately disgusting everyone!\"As soon as these words came out, there was silence around.Seeing everyone staring at her, Wan Chun Ju stuttered in fright: \"Why are you all looking at me like this? I'm not wrong. She's deliberately disgusting everyone. After all, she's not pregnant. Why else would she be retching?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi frowned and didn't speak. When Chen Qiao Qiao was going to the production team office to make a call the next day, she followed.Chen Qiao Qiao was displeased that her mother-in-law wanted to go with her to make a call, but she couldn't refuse.She could only pray that Qiao Zhen Min was in the transport team. Her luck wasn't very good. The person on the other end of the phone told her that Qiao Zhen Min had left a few days ago and wouldn't return until a month later.It was like she fell into an ice cellar. The hand holding the phone trembled.Qiao Xiu Zhi's sharp eyes observed her and spoke, \"Is old fifth in the transport team?\"Chen Qiao Qiao heard her voice reply: \"Yes, he agreed. Told me to go today.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi raised her eyebrows and uttered, \"Really? Give me the phone. I have something to tell old Fifth.\"Chen Qiao Qiao tightly grasped the phone without any intention to let go. Her whole body trembled like a sieve shaking.Seeing her like this, how could Qiao Xiu Zhi not understand what's going on: \"Give me the phone!\"Chen Qiao Qiao's face was pale. As if the blood from her whole body had been taken away. She suddenly rolled her eyes and fainted.The people in the office yelled out: \"How come she faint out of the blue? Quickly take her to the health clinic.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi refused. Instead, she sent her to the town hospital.Chen Qiao Qiao woke up to find that she was in the town's hospital. Her mother-in-law was sitting on the chair by her bed with a frigid stare.Qiao Xiu Zhi coldly spoke, \"The doctor said you are pregnant for a month and a half. Whose child is it?\"Chen Qiao Qiao trembled again: \"Mom, I... I know I'm wrong. Please don't tell Zhen Min, okay?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi shook off the grasping hand: \"I have asked the transport team to contact old Fifth and tell him come back no matter what.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead, it made her even more heartbroken.She got up from the bed and kowtowed: \"Mom, I beg you. Please help me this time. Please don't tell Zhen Min. I don't want to divorce him... waa waa...\"For someone like Qiao Zhen Min who loved face, would definitely not let him go when he knew she did such a thing!Qiao Xiu Zhi stated with a sullen face: \"When you did something like that, you should have thought about today's result. That thought of yours should die. Unless my brain is flooded, I will never hide it for you!\"Chen Qiao Qiao collapsed.She cried and laughed. Her heart burning with hatred: \"Can you blame me? I also want to live a good life with Zhen Min, but he went to the county city alone. No matter how much I begged him, he wouldn't agree to take me with him! \"If he had taken her to the county city, she wouldn't have met Tian Jian Ming. Nor would she do anything wrong to him. So the conclusion, she was also forced!When Qiao Xiu Zhi heard this, she almost vomited in disgust: \"Since you don't think you're wrong, why do you kneel down and beg me? I guess the father of the child should be Doctor Tian from the clinic, right?\"Seeing her mother-in-law solved the mystery like this, Chen Qiao Qiao was stunned. The next moment, she broke down and sobbed: \"You asked me if I wanted to go to the health clinic to study. If you didn't ask me, I would have stayed in the pigsty. I'll...\"Angered, Qiao Xiu Zhi let out a snort: \"According to what you said, all the men and women working in the fields should cheat. Why is it that you are the only one in the entire production team who steal a man?\"She was utterly disappointed with this little daughter-in-law. So far, not only did she not have a trace of remorse, but she felt that others caused her to become like this!She suddenly regretted that she had persuaded old Fifth to give Chen Qiao Qiao a chance. If they had divorced when little Wan'er disappeared, today's matter wouldn't have happened.Chen Qiao Qiao couldn't listen to anything. She resented Qiao Zhen Min for not taking her to the county city. And resented Qiao Xiu Zhi for letting her work in the pigsty. Even hated Da Qiao too!If Da Qiao hadn't made that plate of garlic-flavored green beans, she wouldn't have vomited. Her mother-in-law wouldn't have suspected her!In short, all the mistakes were the faults of others. She, Chen Qiao Qiao, was the most innocent. Like the sole white lotus in the world.Qiao Xiu Zhi was so disgusted that she turned around and wanted to leave. But at this moment, Chen Qiao Qiao acted out again!She picked up the old porcelain bowl next to her and smashed it on the ground. She picked up the broken piece of porcelain and said as she held it against her neck: \"Mom, if you don't agree, I will die for you to see!\"She can't divorce Qiao Zhen Min!Once divorced, what will happen to the child in her womb? What about her reputation? Her maternal family will definitely not take her in!So instead of being divorced and facing the spit from everyone, she might as well die now!Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at her indifferently and responded, \"Don't move!\"Hearing this, Chen Qiao Qiao's dull eyes instantly lit up: \"Mom, I really know I'm wrong. As long as you help me hide this time, I promise to properly live life with Zhen Min in the future!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi's mouth corner twitched and said: \"I told you not to move because I don't want you to die so quickly. I'll call the doctors and nurses to witness your death together. Lest you die without any evidence and people think I forced you to death. !\"Chen Qiao Qiao: \"...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi ignored her again. She turned around and went out to call the nurse over.The broken porcelain piece in Chen Qiao Qiao's hand fell to the ground and broke into two halves. Just like her heart.She covered her face and sobbed again....When Qiao Family knew about Chen Qiao Qiao's affair, they froze on the spot and didn't respond for a long time.Chen Qiao Qiao had an aloof personality. She didn't have much feeling for Qiao Family, including her biological daughter, little Wan'er. However, anyone with eyes can see how much she cared about Qiao Zhen Min.When Qiao Zhen Min went to the county city, she was in a state of despair all day long, wishing she could fly after him. As soon as Qiao Zhen Min came back, she immediately came to life. Her eyes glued to him. She even cooked up delicious treats for him. Before dawn, she ran to the supply and demand cooperative to line up to buy meat.So how could Chen Qiao Qiao have an affair and betray Qiao Zhen Min?If this news wasn't wasn't personally announced by Qiao Xiu Zhi, they wouldn't believe it even if they got beaten to death!Wan Chun Ju was the first to come back to her senses. Shaking her head, she spoke, \"Aiyayaya, Dog Qiao Qiao got such big guts. To actually do such a thing. I really underestimate her!\"In her opinion, Chen Qiao Qiao was ugly and had a small butt. She always looked at people with her chin up. Truly annoying trait. She had guessed that Chen Qiao Qiao would steal food and be lazy. But she never thought that she would steal people!Stealing people. How could she be so daring?Qiao Hong Xia said with a dark face: \"As long as she has considered old Fifth's face and little Wan'er, she will not do such disgusting things. She brought everything upon herself. She still has the face to cry?\"Since Chen Qiao Qiao came back from the hospital, she had been hiding in the room without eating or drinking. Just non-stop tears. No one from Qiao Family went to comfort her.After doing such a thing, did she expect everyone to coax her to eat?What a big face?Lin Hui frowned: \"It's such a pity for little Wan'er to have such a mother!\"Speaking of which, Chen Qiao Qiao and Fang Xiao Juan were really the same kind. Selfish. They only cared about their own happiness. Never think about others.Once the news of Chen Qiao Qiao having affair gets out, everyone will remember that little Wan'er has a cheating mother.Qiao Zhen Guo scratched his head and suggested, \"Dad, Mom, why don't I go catch the adulterer now and beat him?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi shook her head and responded, \"Don't do stupid things!\"Tian Jian Ming wasn't an important person, but he had an uncle who was a cadre in the town revolutionary committee. It was heard that the other party doted Tian Jian Ming. If he beat Tian Jian Ming, the other party will definitely retaliate against Qiao Family!When Qiao Zhen Guo heard what his mom said, he immediately dismissed the idea of beating. He sighed, \"How come each and every one having an affair? Is stealing people so fun?\"Wan Chun Ju stated proudly: \"Zhen Guo, don't worry. I will definitely not steal people and do anything to hurt you!\"Qiao Zhen Guo glanced at her and laughed: \"Wife, you work in a pigsty. You can only steal pigs, not people!\"Wan Chun Ju was stunned for a moment. Then she laughed: \"You're right, I really can only steal pigs!\"After speaking, the couple laughed at each other.Everyone: \"...\" It was impossible to watch!Qiao Hong Xia pondered for a while before speaking, \"Mom, why don't I write a letter to tell Yan Sheng about this matter. I'm afraid that surnamed Tian will attack us first.\"It was said that Tian Jian Ming's fiancee was the niece of the county magistrate. In order to maintain Tian Jian Ming's reputation, Tian Family will definitely turn it around and push all the fault on Qiao Family. Therefore, they had to make a foolproof plan and avoid getting hit by the foe with no way to fight back!Besides, they can't swallow the fact that they have to let that b*stard Tian Jian Ming go like this!Qiao Xiu Zi contemplated and answered, \"You can mention it to him, but let him focus on the affairs of the army more. Don't be impulsive!\"First, Tian Family hadn't made any move yet. Secondly, Wang Yan Sheng was in the army. Even if he wants to help, he may not be able to do anything. In the end, he could only feel angst.Qiao Hong Xia nodded her understanding.When Tian Jian Ming heard that Chen Qiao Qiao had fainted and was sent to the town hospital that day, he guessed that the matter had been exposed.He fidgeted in the clinic for a long time. Finally, he couldn't help but locked the door and ran off.He ran back to town and told his family what happened. His family severely reprimanded him!In fact, this wasn't the first time Tian Jian Ming targeted a married woman.He had beguiled a woman before. The woman thought Tian Jian Ming really loved her, so she abandoned her husband and children in spite of everyone's opposition. Later she discovered Tian Jian Ming couldn't be found anywhere. In the end the woman couldn't stand the blow and committed suicide by jumping into the river.The woman's maternal family had wanted to make trouble, but was suppressed by Tian Jian Ming's maternal uncle, Qiu Xin Yong. This time Tian Jian Ming came to Qili production team to avoid the limelight. And how long he had been here and did something like this?Mother Tian scolded him before immediately taking him back to her maternal parents' home for help.After Qiu Xin Yong found out, he gave him a reassurance on the spot: \"Maternal Uncle will take care of this matter for you. But during this period of time, you should behave. If you ruin your marriage with Lin Family, don't think about me helping you in the future! \"Tian Jian Ming's fianc\u00e9e was called Lin Miao. The county magistrate was her uncle. She and Tian Jian Ming were high school classmates. Tian Jian Ming was good-looking and a sweet talker. Lin family couldn't win against their daughter, so they nodded in agreement.Qiu Xin Yong was now the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee. He had been eyeing at the position of director and desired to go further. If he can become a relative with the county magistrate, this position will be guaranteed.If at this time, Tian Jian Ming got reported for messing with other women, the other party will definitely break the engagement. It might even affect his promotion!Therefore, Qiu Xin Yong couldn't let this matter be exposed no matter what.Tian Jian Ming repeatedly nodded: \"I understand, Maternal Uncle. Actually, I really can't be blamed for this time. That woman seduces me in the health center every day.Tian Jian Ming's maternal grandmother berated: \"Stinky shameless bitch, I knew she shamelessly seduce you. Don't be afraid. With your maternal uncle here, everything will be sorted for you!\"Tian Jian Ming pushed the frame of his glasses and smiled gently.He had never been afraid. Otherwise he wouldn't have targeted Chen Qiao Qiao....Qiao Zhen Min received a call from a comrade in the transport team, he had been looking for someone to replace himself. After finding someone, he hurriedly caught a ride home.Though he still didn't know what happened, he believed that his mom wasn't one to mess around. If something major didn't happened, she would definitely not call him back.The only thing he was worried about was that something had happened to little Wan'er. When he hurried to the production team and saw his daughter following behind Da Qiao from a distance, his raised heart settled down.\"Fifth Uncle!\" Da Qiao's eyes were sharp. She was the first to spot Qiao Zhen Min walking towards them.An Ping was leaning on the locust tree to pick the blossoms. He waved his arms and shouted, \"Fifth Uncle, you're back!\"Locust tree generally bloom in April and May. This year, due to the weather, locust tree bloomed a little late. It was currently the end of June. The blossom were already a little old. After picking this batch, they can only wait for next year.Therefore, the children of the production team came out to pick locust flowers. Qiao Family's children were no exception.Qiao Zhen Min walked over with his long legs. Raising his head, he told An Ping, \"You monkey boy, still not coming down!\"After speaking, he looked down at his daughter.After not seeing her for two months, he found that his daughter has grown taller. Her skin had became fairer. She looked much more energetic!More importantly, she no longer stayed under the tree alone and watch the ants. She went out to play with her cousins!Although his face was full of exhaustion, he felt full of joy when seeing his daughter like this!\"Little Wan'er, do you still recognize Dad?\" He squatted down and softly spoke.Little Wan'er tilted her head to look at him. It seem she had some recollection. She turned and hid behind Da Qiao. After a while, her head peeked out like a frightened little animal. Seeing that he was looking at her, she immediately hid back.Seeing his daughter so lively, Qiao Zhen Min's mouth corners almost reached the bottom of his ears.Da Qiao grasped Younger Sister and said, \"Little Wan'er, this is your dad. He loves you very much. He bought you a little dress last time. Do you remember?\"Little Wan'er tilted her head to ponder for a while. Then she lightly nodded: \"The dress, very pretty.\"These four words almost made Qiao Zhen Min cry. His little Wan'er can finally speak!He gratefully looked at Da Qiao and said, \"Da Qiao, Fifth Uncle must thank you. Thank you for taking care of little Wan'er!\"Da Qiao smiled with crescent eyes: \"Fifth Uncle, you're welcome. I like Younger Sister very much.\"Little Wan'er glanced between Elder Sister and the man in front of her. She quietly greeted, \"Fifth Uncle.\"Qiao Zhen Min, who suddenly changed from dad to uncle: \"...\"An Ping had finished picking the blossoms and ran to Da Qiao, \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, will you make me locust flower egg roll later?\"A few days ago, Younger Sister Da Qiao made two plates of locust flower egg rolls for everyone. The taste was so fragrant that he wanted to drool when he thought about it. It was really delicious!Da Qiao softly replied, \"Elder Cousin Brother, I won't make egg rolls with locust flower today. Let's try another way to eat it today...steamed locust flower.\"An Ping thought for a while before nodding, \"Sure, as long as it's made by you, I'll eat everything!\"Qiao Dong Ying came over and laughed at him: \"Then you'll eat the poo made by Younger Sister Da Qiao?\"An Ping jumped up angrily and uttered, \"Second Elder Sister, why are you getting more and more disgusting! Such delicious food and you insist on associating it with poo and pee. Don't eat it later!\"Qiao Dong Ying shrugged: \"It's impossible not to eat.\"After saying this, she turned her head to look at daughter-con Fifth Uncle and silently lit a candle for him in her heart.Da Qiao and others still didn't understand what was affair meant, but Qiao Dong Ying was mature. She knew what it meant a few years ago and felt very indignant for Fifth Uncle.Qiao Zhen Min turned his head and caught the expression on his second niece's face.Soon, he understood why Second Niece looked at him with sympathy....When Chen Qiao Qiao saw her husband rushing in with a livid face, she knew it was over: \"Zhen Min...uh...\"She only had time to call out his name before she was strangled by the neck!Qiao Zhen Min's blue veins on his forehead and neck were exposed: \"Chen Qiao Qiao, what wrong did to do to? If you don't want to live with me, you can tell me directly. Why do you want such a thing!\"To any man, being cuckolded by their own woman was unforgivable!Chen Qiao Qiao had difficulty breathing. Her face turned purple. She kept beating him with her hands: \"Cough...you...let...go...\"Because of the lack of oxygen, her eyes rolled back from the strangulation. Just when she thought she was going to die today, Qiao Zhen Min pushed her away.She fell to the ground, tears falling down with a swoosh.Qiao Zhen Min's chest heaved up and down violently. He looked down at her. It took a long time to squeeze a few words out of his teeth: \"We will go get a divorce tomorrow!\"Unlike Qiao Zhen Min and Qiao Hong Xia, Qiao Zhen Min and Chen Qiao Qiao had obtained a marriage certificate. They needed to go through procedures to get a divorce.Chen Qiao Qiao got up from the ground, grabbed his arm, and cried, \"Zhen Min, I won't divorced! I don't want to divorce with you. I love you!\"Qiao Zhen Min shook her off and sneered: \"Love me? How to love? Would you love me with the body you've touched other men? Save it. You don't feel disgusted, well, I think you are dirty!\"The blood on Chen Qiao Qiao's face drained at once. She took two steps back and fell onto the kang behind.She didn't understand how it came to this point.At the beginning, she never thought of doing something wrong to him. But the last time he came back, she begged him to take her to the county seat. He refused.Her heart felt twisted to knots. It was Tian Jian Ming who was always by her side. He joked to make her happy and praised her beauty with poetry. Every time he looked at her with affectionate gaze, her heart couldn't help but shake.Gradually, she lost herself. She fell in love with Tian Jian Ming. She liked his gentleness and thoughtfulness. She liked that she was the only one in his eyes. She liked even more his strong and powerful body...She was just an ordinary woman who needs the care and protection of a man. Tian Jian Ming held her like she was a treasure in the palm of his hand. How could she not be moved?Falling in love with Tian Jian Ming was an accident. She couldn't help it!But that didn't mean that she doesn't love Qiao Zhen Min. She never thought of getting a divorce with him!\"Zhen Min, I really know I was wrong. Please forgive me this time. I really love you. I promise to forget that man and properly live with you in the future!\"Qiao Zhen Min indifferently stared at her: \"When little Wan'er was gone last time, you had said that you would love her and properly live with me in the future. And what happened? Don't say anything. For little Wan'er, I will leave you some face and won't tell what you did. Before little Wan'er grows up, you can't come to see her! However, I think, you won't care, right?\"After speaking, he ignored her. He turned around and coldly walked out.Chen Qiao Qiao's face was pale. Her body softened and she powerlessly fell to the ground. As if all her strength had been zapped away....Qiao Zhen Min came to the main room with a livid face. His body exuded the aura that warned strangers off.Da Qiao walked in with a plate of steamed locust flowers and a small plate of garlic-flavored green beans. She softly spoke, \"Fifth Uncle, you will feel better once you are full.\"Da Qiao didn't know what it meant to have an affair, but the atmosphere at home was very strange during this time. She noticed long ago. There was a roar in Fifth Uncle's room just now. She guessed that he and Fifth Aunt quarreled.Fifth Uncle treated her very well and loved little Wan'er very much. While Fifth Aunt was always cold and ignored little Wan'er. Therefore, between Fifth Uncle and Fifth Aunt, she preferred Fifth Uncle Fifth.Qiao Zhen Min took in the child that looked at him with bright and clean eyes. Her voice was soft and silky. His heart softened all of a sudden.He raised his hand and rubbed her head: \"Good child, thank you.\"Da Qiao smiled sweetly: \"Fifth Uncle, eat it. I'm going to make locust blossom dumplings. I'll bring them to you when I'm done.\"Qiao Zhen Min nodded.As soon as Da Qiao left, Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan walked in together.Qiao Xiu Zhi asked, \"What are you going to do?\"Qiao Zhen Min smiled bitterly: \"What else can I do beside divorce?\"When little Wan-er went missing, both of them were responsible. That's why he can try to give each other a chance. This time, he really had no choice.Not only had Chen Qiao Qiao had an affair, but even became pregnant. What's even more overboard was that she wanted him to raise a cuckoo egg for another man!If murder wasn't against the law, he really wanted to strangle her to death!Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan looked at each other. They agreed, \"Then divorce. As for Tian Jian Ming's side, you must not be impulsive.\"Tian Jian Ming ran away that day and never came back. The community sent a female doctor over two days later.There was no news from Tian Family.Qiao Zhen Min clenched his hands into fists. After some endurance, he nodded, \"I know what to do. Don't worry, I won't mess around!\"\"I'm afraid Chen Family won't make it so easy for you to get divorced. Your dad and I will go with you tomorrow.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi knew rage burned within her son. But impulsiveness couldn't solve the problem. They could only wait.Qiao Zhen Min didn't refuse.Tian Jian Ming couldn't be touched for the time being. As for Chen Qiao Qiao, he didn't want to stay in the same room with her for a second!Originally, they thought that there would be a tough battle the next day. Surprisingly, Chen Family came over that very afternoon.Chen Family didn't act as ferocious as they imagined. Instead, they were very harmonious and kind.They said that Chen Qiao Qiao wronged Qiao Family and that their Chen Family didn't educate their daughter well. Their visit was to get their daughter to divorce Qiao Zhen Min and then take her away.Chen Family's understanding was quite abnormal.Qiao Family thought about it and quickly understood.Chen Family properly received benefits from Tian Family or even be threatened by Tian Family. That's why, they took the initiative to take Chen Qiao Qiao back.As for what will happen to Chen Qiao Qiao after she returned, Qiao Family didn't know and didn't want to know.The next day, Qiao Zhen Min went to the town to go through the divorce procedures with Chen Qiao Qiao.Because Qiu Xin Yong had instructed in advance, the divorce procedures were completed very quickly. Finished in less than half an hour.Holding the divorce certificate, Qiao Zhen Min turned around and left without even looking at Chen Qiao Qiao.Soon, the news of Qiao Zhen Min's divorce spread throughout the production team. The villagers were stirred up!In less than half a day, everyone's attention was sucked away by another news- Fang Xiao Juan was going to marry into Hu City to become a city folk!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One after another, they divorced. Now only Eldest Qiao is left!\"\"You're wrong. Qiao Hong Mei didn't get divorced. Qiao Xiu Zhi couple didn't get divorced either, no?\"\"Tsk tsk tsk, I bet a cucumber, even if all of Qiao Family's members get divorced, Qiao Xiu Zhi couple won't! You didn't see how they walked hand in hand last time!\"\"Already at this age and still do such a thing? Don't they feel ashamed to be seen by the juniors?\"Everyone discussed about Qiao Family getting another divorce.But as they talked, it turned into criticizing Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan as parents. One moment they said they didn't educate their children well. The next, they said that they were shameless for showing affection every day at this age!There were some people sensed Qiao Family got better with each divorce despite the bad reputation.Look at old Second Qiao who married Lin Hui after the divorce. The new wife was beautiful and virtuous. The family was harmonious. The in-laws were wonderful and didn't cause trouble. Multiple times better than Fang Xiao Juan.Then look at Qiao Hong Xia. One would think a broken shoe divorcee with a child would marry an old and ugly widower in the best case scenario. Who would have thought that she would actually capture the most promising old Third of Wang family.Twenty-six-year-old colonel. How many unmarried girls' eyes went red with jealousy!Qiao Zhen Min was capable of his own and worked as an employee in the county city. With his skills, he might be able to bring a girl from the city back soon!Xing Hua came over with her swaying hips and pouted: \"I don't care if you want to hold Qiao Family's stinky feet, but you don't need to hold one and step on the other. Our elder sister Xiao Juan is also doing well after leaving Qiao Family!\"Song Jin Lai's wife heard this, she immediately cackled: \"Are you blind? How is Fang Xiao Juan doing well? It wasn't bad to be married to Wang Family before. Still, she can't stand win against her natural bad luck. How sturdy was old Fifth Wang? He was killed within half a year of marriage. Tsk tsk tsk!\"Xing Hua flushed with anger: \"Song Jin Lai's wife, if you talk nonsense again, see how I tear your stinky mouth!\"Song Jin Lai's wife had her hands on her waist: \"Tear then! I just don't understand. What did Fang Xiao Juan give you to eat to make you so willing to be her lackey?\"Xing Hua gritted her teeth with hatred: \"Say it. Just say it. If you have the ability don't cluster over when Elder Sister Xiao Juan marry and become an official wife in the city!\"What?Fang Xiao Juan is going to marry and become an official wife in the city?Was Xing Hua's brain drowning and started to speak nonsense?Although Fang Xiao Juan looked good, she had married twice. If Qiao Hong Xia was a broken shoe, then Fang Xiao Juan was the most broken shoe among the broken shoes!Which official man gone mad and took a fancy on this broken shoe?Everyone quickly latched onto Xing Hua to inquire about the news.\"Do you still remember the educated youth named Meng Hong Guang who came to the production team before?\"Xing Hua was surrounded by the crowd. Her chin held high. So proud that it seem like she was the one going to marry into the city and become an official wife!Everyone was stunned for a moment. Soon someone wrapped their head around and slapped their thighs.\"I remember. How could I not? Back then, he and Fang Xiao Juan were flirting with each other. I thought they were going to get married. Who would have known that as soon as he returned to the city, there would be no news! What? Is Fang Xiao Juan going to marry him?\"Xing Hua nodded proudly: \"It's Educated Youth Meng. He's now the secretary of the deputy director of the Hu City's Urban Development Bureau. Apart from the mayor, this urban development bureau is the second-in-command of Hu City. Educated Youth Meng is the secretary of the deputy director. How many people wants to get on his good side and can't? This kind of man isn't better than a guard dog?\u201dQiao Zhen Jun went to the town's food factory to work as a door security. At this time, he became a guard dog from Xing Hua's mouth.The villagers didn't know anything about the so-called Urban Development Bureau. Still, that was a big city and he was the secretary of the deputy director. It didn't matter if they understand. In short, it was amazing!A quick witted person's mind immediately turned and flattered: \"My god, a secretary of the deputy director. Educated Youth Meng was really capable! When I saw him back then, I knew he was a young man with a bright future. So, he's really going to marry Fang Xiao Juan now?\"Someone sourly remarked: \"It can't be? Since Educated Youth Meng is so capable, why would he go back to the countryside to find a wife? Don't he like any of the girls in the city?\"These days, not to mention the people in the city, even the people in the town wouldn't easily choose a girl from the countryside. Even if Educated Youth Meng wanted to find a wife from the countryside, there were a lot of unmarried girls. Why fixate on Fang Xiao Juan?Xing Hua proudly responded: \"This is because Educated Youth Meng is affectionate and loyal. He said that when he came to our production team, if it hadn't been for Elder Sister Xiao Juan secretly helping him, he would have been unable to endure it. Elder Sister Xiao Juan had foresight. There were so many male educated youths and she didn't help anyone other than Educated Youth Meng. So you can't be envious!\"Everyone was boiling with env. Why didn't they help Educated Youth Meng in the first place?If they had helped at that time, now they will be the target of repayment!Some people were still dissatisfied: \"Educated Youth Meng should be twenty-nine years old this year, right? He should had already be married at such an old age!\"Xing Hua said: \"Educated Youth Meng married a girl from the city under the arrangement of the family after returning home. The woman was unlucky and died within two years of marriage. After that, Educated Youth Meng raised his son alone and didn't remarry. That was until he came here this time and met Elder Sister Xiao Juan on a business trip. He remembered those wonderful days and immediately decided to marry Elder Sister Xiao Juan!\"\"Oh, this is the fate of the two of them!\"\"Ain't that right! I said before that Xiao Juan is a lucky person. Isn't the luck coming now?\"No matter what everyone thought in their hearts, no one spoke sarcastically after knowing Educated Youth Meng's identity.Some wanted to have a good relationship with Fang Xiao Juan before she left. So after they dispersed, many people went to visit Fang Xiao Juan with eggs or snacks.That thatched hut, where no one usually to go in the past, suddenly became the most popular place for the production team.After the last group of people left, the sky was completely dark.Fang Xiao Juan glanced at the stuff on the table and asked Xiao Qiao, \"Have you made up your mind? Would you like to go to the Hu City with me?\"Fang Xiao Juan didn't have much affection for this daughter, Xiao Qiao.She originally wanted to leave Xiao Qiao to Qiao Family this time and then go to the city alone. However, Meng Hong Guang liked Xiao Qiao very much and asked her to take her there no matter what.Although she didn't understand why Meng Hong Guang was interested in Xiao Qiao, she agreed in order to please him.Xiao Qiao sat in the corner. The candlelight shone on her face that had recently grown flesh: \"Okay.\"She originally thought that if Fang Xiao Juan remarried, she would take the opportunity to return to Qiao's house. But after meeting Meng Hong Guang once, she changed her mind.Meng Hong Guang was gentle and refined. His whole person exuded with aura. More importantly, he was very capable. He became the secretary of the deputy director before the age of 30. Once the reform and opening up happen in the future, he will definitely seize the opportunity!Besides, his household registration was in Hu City. Even if he doesn't do business, he can buy some dilapidated buildings with money. In the future, he will be rich from the demolition. Therefore, she can't let go of such a good opportunity!Fang Xiao Juan breathed a sigh of relief when she heard this response. Still, she warned: \"Since you choose to go with me, then you have to listen to me. Only when I'm good, you can live a good life with me, understand?\"Xiao Qiao pouted and answered, \"Don't worry. We are on the same boat. I won't hold you back.\"What you should worry about is not being stupid yourself!But she didn't say it....It was hottest period of the year. The weather was getting hotter and hotter. Cicada sang nonstop from the trees outside. So noisy that it made people annoyed.Qiao Zhen Min brought back a lot of local specialties this time. This included a sea plant called coral.After the coral is boiled and cooled, it will become a transparent jelly-like thing. Then cut into pieces and poured in sugar water or honey. It can become a very delicious snack.At this moment, Da Qiao brought out the diced coral jelly and softly spoke to her mom: \"Fifth Uncle said this thing is cold. Mother, you can only eat a small bowl each day!\"Lin Hui's belly had reached over six months. Her belly was enormous. Since the weather was hot, she sweat every time she moves. Which was very unbearable.Da Qiao saw how hard her mom's pregnancy was. She couldn't help much. Could only make some delicious food for her from time to time.Lin Hui smiled softly and replied, \"Mom knows. Mom will eat a small bowl. The weather is so hot, don't run around. Come and sit down here.\"Da Qiao smiled with crescent eyes, picked up another bowl of coral jelly and sat down next to her mom.Lin Hui noticed that her cheeks were flushed with heat. She took out a handkerchief and wiped her sweat before eating her bowl.Although Da Qiao wasn't her biological daughter, she doted her more than her biological child. She can't understand why Fang Xiao Juan disliked such a well-behaved and sensible child.The entire production team knew that Fang Xiao Juan was going to marry to Hu City. It went without saying some gossipy people came to tell Qiao Family.After Qiao Family found out, they finally understood why Fang Xiao Juan was so low-key during this time. It turned out that she had climbed the high branch!Fang Xiao Juan had already let it spread that she will take Xiao Qiao to the Hu City in the middle of next month.From here to Hu City, it took seven days and seven nights to travel by transport. In other words, Fang Xiao Juan will probably never come back after her trip.Lin Hui glanced at Da Qiao, who was enjoying herself, and thought for a while, \"Da Qiao, do you know about your biological mom's remarriage?\"Da Qiao's long and dense eyelashes blinked and she gave a slight nod: \"I know.\"Lin Hui put down the old porcelain bowl and said softly, \"Do you want to... go see her? If you want to go, Mom will accompany you there.\"Her mom told her before that she shouldn't let Da Qiao come into contact with her biological mom. Because she was afraid that she wouldn't be able to nurture closeness if they had too much contact.She hesitated, but finally decided to leave the choice to Da Qiao herself.Da Qiao stared down at the transparent coral jelly in the bowl. After a while of silence, she shook her head. She answered, \"I won't go.\"In the past, she had always wondered why her biological mom didn't like her. No matter how much she tried to please her, it was useless. At that time, she was very depressed and sad. Now she won't anymore.She had the best grandparents, doting parents, and so many siblings that liked her. So it didn't matter whether her biological mom like her or not. She didn't need it anymore.Don't go then. Who knows if they will be scolded if they go to see her?Lin Hui reached out and rubbed her fluffy little head. Softly, she spoke, \"Your hair is getting longer and longer. Go get a comb. Mom will make a fishtail braid for you.\"Da Qiao instantly regained her energy. She put down the old porcelain bowl and ran to the room to get a comb.After finishing the braid, Da Qiao went to look for Elder Brother Huo Chi with the coral jelly.Since Wang Yan Sheng proposed the planting change to Chinese herbs, only eight families in the entire production team changed. Many people maintained a wait-and-see attitude.Although there weren't many people who switched, Huo Family's life was still much easier than before. Now not only Huo Chi can walk around in the production team, Huo Hua Qing and Dai Shu Fang were also allowed.The villagers who switched were much more polite to their family than before. When they have extra food at home, they occasionally secretly gave it to their family to eat. Huo Family was full of gratitude for this change.When she came to the private plot, Da Qiao called to Huo Chi, who was squatting on the ground and looking at the wolfberry saplings, \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, I brought you something to eat. Quickly come over.\"After discussion, Huo Hua Qing suggested to the villagers to plant wolfberry.All part of wolfberry was a treasure. Not only the leaves can be eaten as vegetables, the wolfberry fruit can be used for both medicine and food. Its root bark can be used as medicine to relieve cough. And its seed oil can be made into lubricating oil or edible oil.It was just that they decided a little late and missed the best germination time in spring. After they sowed the seeds during this period, Huo Family almost gave all their focused on it.Fortunately, their luck wasn't bad. The seeds they sowed have all sprouted. Now they had grown into palm-high saplings. Still, they were very fragile. So Huo Chi would come every day.Da Qiao looked at the green saplings on the private plot and her small mouth revealed her teeth.She didn't tell anyone that she secretly used jade bead water to water the seeds. That was why these seeds germinated so fast and the survival rate was so high.Hearing Da Qiao's voice, Huo Chi quickly patted the dirt off his body and ran over: \"The weather is so hot. Don't run around. If you become tanned, don't cry!\"Da Qiao took a bowl of coral jelly out of the basket and snorted coldly, \"You would cry. Look at me, I can't get tanned!\"Huo Chi looked at her fair and tender little face. It was like a peeled egg. Many people would become a few shade darker in the summer. But she didn't change at all.\"En, you don't get tanned,\" he nodded. Then he noticed her new hairstyle. \"You got a new hairstyle?\"Da Qiao shook her head and said, \"Yes, Mom helped me comb it into a braid. Elder Brother Huo Chi, do I look pretty? I think I'm pretty!\"\"Pfft...\"\"Younger Sister Da Qiao, why are you so vain every day?\" Qiao Dong Ying popped out of nowhere and amusedly revealed a set of white teeth.Da Qiao pouted her red lips: \"But I'm good-looking. Both Grandfather and Grandmother said I'm the best-looking. Elder Brother Huo Chi, do you think I'm pretty?\"Seeing vainness, Huo Chi found it funny and amusing. He couldn't bear to disappoint her though: \"En, not bad.\"Hearing this, Qiao Dong Ying secretly rolled her eyes.It was these people who always spoil Younger Sister Da Qiao without a bottom line and made her become so vain!An Ping had followed over with an orange in that contained a lot of cicada in his hand: \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, so you are here. Do you want to catch cicada with us?\"Da Qiao shook her head: \"I have to go back and teach younger siblings how to read. By the way, Elder Cousin Brother, you haven't come to class for many days. If your grades fall back when you start school, be careful that Elder Uncle beats your butt!\"An Ping scratched his head and said, \"Aren't I busy catching cicada? Younger Sister Da Qiao, didn't you say last time that salt and pepper cicada was more delicious than chilled cicada? I caught a lot today. Make it later please! Pretty please!\"For An Ping, as long as he can eat delicious food, he will even take they beating if needed!Da Qiao sterned up her fair and tender face: \"Sure, but you have to find me for make up lessons tomorrow, okay? If you don't go, I won't hold back!\"An Ping remembered Younger Sister Da Qiao's last time's 'won't hold back' and shivered for a while. He rapidly nodded: \"Okay, I'll go to make up class tomorrow. Please go easy on me!\"Qiao Dong Ying couldn't help rolling her eyes when she saw her brother's unpromising appearance....Qiao Family wasn't affected by Qiao Zhen Min's divorce. Qiao Zhen Jun was unlucky because of it.At noon that day, he was called to the office by the factory manager.Qiao Zhen Jun was slightly ill at ease. He had been in the factory for almost two months and the factory manager had never seen him privately .Why did he call him to the office all of the sudden?He knocked on the door of the office and the factory manager's deep voice sounded from inside: \"Come in.\"Qiao Zhen Jun walked in. Rubbing his hands together, he uttered said, \"Manager, you were looking for me?\"Factory Manager Nie glanced at him and shook his head. He opened the drawer, took out an envelope, pushed it over, and said, \"This is your salary for this month. An extra half a month as compensation. Take it and pack it up. You don't have to come to work tomorrow!\"Qiao Zhen Jun felt like he was struck like by lightning: \"Manager, can I, can I ask why?\"He knew that he wasn't smart enough at socializing. Nor was his mouth sweet enough. So he had worked harder than anyone else during this period of time. People didn't like to work night shifts, so he would take the initiative to take it. Whatever colleagues need, he will do his best to help.He dared not say he was the best worker, but he was sure that he had never made any mistakes or had conflicts with other colleagues. So he didn't understand why he wasn't allowed to continue to work.Factory Manager Nie sighed, \"It's not your fault. It's your family who offended someone who shouldn't be offended. I was forced with no choice. In short, you can go with your salary. Don't ask more questions. When you go back, tell your family don't randomly speak. Go.\"Factory Manager Nie waved his hand after speaking, indicating that he didn't want to say more.Qiao Zhen Jun was at a loss. He was very worried about what happened at home. He picked up the envelope, bowed to the factory manager, and hurried away.The factory only gave two days off a month and it had been more than half a month since he last went back. He didn't know what happened at home. He had to go back immediately!The two guards were surprised when they found out that he had been fired.\"You were doing well, why they want you to stop working?\" the older old guard asked.Another guard surnamed Wu nodded: \"Did something happen? Tell us and see if we can help!\"Qiao Zhen Jun was an honest and hard-working person. Had no bad intentions. Sometimes when something urgent cropped up at home for them, he would substitute for them. He never complained.Working with such a person was really worry-free. If someone else comes here, they may not be so easy to get along with!Qiao Zhen Jun sighed: \"Factory Manager said my family had offended people. So don't ask any more questions. If someone ask about me later, you should say that you aren't familiar with me. This way, you won't be implicated!\"When the two heard this, they couldn't help but be silent.They have the heart to speak for Qiao Zhen Jun, but their family were ordinary people. The whole family relied on their salary to live. So they can't lose this job no matter what.Qiao Zhen Jun didn't blame them. If he encountered such a thing, he would choose advantages and avoid disadvantages.He quickly packed his things and left that afternoon.Although he knew that the factory manager would have notified Shen Family about him, he still decided to go to Shen Family.When old Mister Shen knew about this, he loudly slammed the table: \"Who is so arrogant? Wait, I'll make a phone call and ask!\"Qiao Zhen Jun hurriedly dissuaded.He didn't come here to get Shen Family stand up for him. He felt that the job was found for him by Shen Family and now he was fired, he should give the other party a heads-up.But old Mister Shen's temper flared up. No one could stop him now.Factory Manager Nie was old Mister's younger generation. When he received a call from him, he felt bitter in his heart and complained about Qiao Zhen Jun before giving an explanation.At the end, he said, \"Fourth Uncle Shen, I know that Qiao Family is your savior, but this matter involved the Revolutionary Committee. You should forget it.\"After hanging up the phone, old Mister Shen's expression was very ugly. His chest heaved so angry that he gasped to breath.When old Madam Shen heard the movement, she scolded him: \"The doctor told you to keep calm. Look how you are angry. Do you want to go to the hospital and lie down?\"Old Mister Shen banged his cane loudly: \"Simply bullying people! Simply bullying people!\"Qiao Zhen Jun became more restless. If he knew earlier, he wouldn't come.After old Madam Shen knew what happened, she sighed, \"These people will get their retribution sooner or later! Nephew Qiao, go back and tell your family not to fight head on against those people!\"\"Okay, I'll go home now. I'm really sorry for causing you trouble!\"When Qiao Zhen Jun knew that his family had offended the Revolutionary Committee, he was so frightened that his heart skipped a beat.Old Mister Shen waved his hand: \"You don't have to worry about implicating us. No matter how bold the surnamed Qiu is, he doesn't dare to reach out to our Shen Family!\"Shen Family had been operating in the town for so many years. They got all kinds of network and connections. Qiu Xin Yong wouldn't be so stupid to make a move against Shen Family. Not to mention that he didn't single-handed control the Revolutionary Committee!However, Shen Family can't simply take a direct shot on this matter. He had to wait for his son to come back and discuss it with him.Qiao Zhen Jun came out of the Shen's house and immediately rushed to the production team without stopping. When he arrived at the production team, it was time for the villagers to get off work.Everyone greeted him when they saw him: \"Old Second Qiao, are you coming back on your day off?\"\"Oh, if I had known that you were coming back today, I should have asked you to help me buy something from the supply and demand cooperative!\"Qiao Zhen Jun gave an awkward smile.When Qiao Xiu Zhi saw the package behind her second son, she knew something was wrong.Back at Qiao's house, Qiao Zhen Jun's answer quickly confirmed her guess.\"Bang\"!Qiao Zhen Min slammed his fist on the table. His face ashen with anger: \"I'm going to fight with Tian family!\"Saying that, he stood up, turned around and rushed out.\"Come back here!\" Qiao Xiu Zhi sharply shouted.Qiao Zhen Min turned his head. The veins on his forehead were bulging: \"Mom, I really can't swallow this breath!\"Not to mention being cuckolded, they still have the face to threaten his family. Simply a bully!Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at him and said coldly: \"Even if you can't swallow it, you got to swallow it. Once you go, do you want to die with the surnamed Tian or what? Do you think the matter will be resolved when you die? Later, that surnamed Tian uncle won't let us go. And little Wan'er? If you die, have you thought about what will happen to her in the future? Do you think a mother like Chen Qiao Qiao will take care of her with all her heart?\"Qiao Zhen Min gritted his teeth and squatted on the ground in despair as he beat his head: \"It's all my fault! I'm the one who implicated everyone!\"Back then, he had just started working in the town's supply and demand cooperative. Even if he knew how to interact, everyone would inevitably defend against him, especially since he snatched the job from someone else at that time.In order to stay in the supply and demand cooperative, he worked very hard. For a while, he only slept three or four hours a day. Soon, he fell ill.It was at this time that Chen Qiao Qiao appeared.Her brother also worked in the supply and demand cooperative. She used this pretext to approach him, She washed and cooked for him. As well as delivering medicine and food to him. The people in the supply and demand cooperative thought they were dating.He didn't like Chen Qiao Qiao very much at that time, but seeing how gentle and considerate she was, he tacitly accepted that she was his match. Then they got married.When they first got married, she was a gentle and considerate wife. She began to change when she found out that little Wan'er was different from other children. She complained that little Wan'er wasn't smart enough. He was very dissatisfied with this and their couple's feeling changed .But he thought she was just a little colder at most. He never thought that she would put such a big green hat on him. What's more, it would also implicate his family.He truly regretted it. He shouldn't have married her in the first place!Qiao Xiu Zhi spoke: \"It has already happened. It's useless to regret. I just want to remind you that if you really care about your family, you'd better not act impulsively. Otherwise this family will be ruined in your hands!\"Qiao Zhen Min let a choked sounds from his arms: \"Mom, I know!\"At first everyone thought that Qiao Zhen Min was just coming back on his day off. But he didn't return to town after a few days. Everyone soon knew that he was fired by the factory!So there was a lot of discussion in the production team. And there were many people watching this joke.\"Oh, old Fifth Qiao just got divorced. Now old Second Qiao lost his job. I don't know what will happen to Qiao Family in the future?\"\"Ain't that right. It looks like it's good that Fang Xiao Juan to left Qiao Family!\"After Xiao Qiao knew about this, she was more certain that her decision was correct.The luck system on Da Qiao will steal the luck of the people around her. Qiao Family seem to be doing well some time ago, but it was actually just a false prosperity. Now, weren't they going downhill?So she must stay away from her. After arriving in Hu City, she will be able to play her big role as the heroine!On this day, Lin Hui came back from her maternal home. She happened to bump into Fang Xiao Juan mid-way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen the mortal enemy meets, their eyes go red!Lin Hui and Fang Xiao Juan used to be best friends. They grew up together and worked in the fields together. The once intimate two people became mortal enemies after Fang Xiao Juan stole the person Lin Hui liked.After going circles, Lin Hui was now married to Fang Xiao Juan's ex-husband. The feud between them could never be dissolved.Fang Xiao Juan stared at Lin Hui who was approaching A flash of jealousy flicked in her eyes.Lin Hui's complexion was ruddy and her skin was fair and tender. She looked younger and more beautiful than when she was seventeen or eighteen. This made people jealous!On the other hand, her face was sallow. Her cheeks have a lot of freckles that can't be removed. For the past half month, she had been hiding in the house and not go to field to maintain her body and skin. Still, her skin condition wasn't good.Seeing Fang Xiao Juan, Lin Hui felt disgust in her heart.This person was selfish. As a friend, she would stab you in the back. As a mother, she will abandon her children. As a wife, she will cheat and give you a green hat. There was no bottom line!Knowing that she was going to marry in Hu City, she wasn't jealous at all. She even hoped that she could live there in peace and never come back in this life!She didn't want to give Fang Xiao Juan any attention. This very reaction stimulated the other party.Just when she was about to go over, Fang Xiao Juan reached out and stopped her: \"Hui Hui, why are you in such a hurry? After all, we are good friends for many years. Now I'm going to the city, don't you want to have a nice chat with me?\"Her 'Hui Hui' made Lin Hui feel sick. With a sullen face, Lin Hui spoke: \"Get out of the way. I have nothing to talk to you about!\"After speaking, she took two steps to the side, but was stopped by Fang Xiao Juan again. It was clear that she didn't want to let her go!\"Fang Xiao Juan, don't think that you have climbed the high branch and we won't do anything to you. If you still want to smoothly go to Hu City, you'd better get out of my way now!\"Lin Hui was such a gentle person in the past. She always spoke in a quiet voice. At this moment, she was truly mad.Fang Xiao Juan's face became ugly when she heard her threat: \"Don't think because Qiao Family got connectioned with a deputy chief and you can walk sideways in the production team. If they really care about Qiao Family, Qiao Zhen Jun wouldn't have got fired! So save your threats!\"Lin Hui pursed her lips tightly. She didn't want to waste a word with her.Fang Xiao Juan's eyes moved around and landed on her bulging belly. Her heart was filled with jealousy: \"You're close to delivery, right? The belly is round, it should be a son. Oh, wait, your belly is bigger than mine. Most likely twins.\"Lin Hui supported her stomach and took two steps back. Eyeing her vigilantly, she said, \"What do you want to do?\"Fang Xiao Juan wanted to do something, but she didn't dare to cause trouble at this time.Although Meng Hong Guang was the secretary of the deputy director, far water can't save the near fire. If Qiao Family gets aggressive, they definitely have a way to make her unable to get out of the production team with their in-law relationship with Wang Family!This was also the reason why she had been so low-key during this period of time, so she can smoothly leave the production team.The reason why she stopped Fang Xiao Juan today wasn't just getting stimulating just now. There was another very important thing.\"Don't worry, I won't do anything to you! I still want to go to the city to be an official wife and enjoy happiness!\" Fang Xiao Juan uttered, \"I want to say that you will soon have children that belong to you and Qiao Zhen Jun. Plus you have your ex-husband's son. You will definitely not be able to take care of Da Qiao. So I want to take Da Qiao away with me!\"It never crossed her mind to take Da Qiao away. Yesterday, she received a letter from Meng Hong Guang; asking her to take the eldest twin daughter, Da Qiao along with her.Meng Hong Guang was now her gold master. Even though she wasn't happy to, she can only find a way to get Da Qiao.Lin Hui was stunned when she heard her words. Wide eyes, she stared at her: \"Fang Xiao Juan, what are you planning?\"The whole production team knew how much Fang Xiao Juan hated Da Qiao!Now she want to take Da Qiao away? Definitely wasn't to take her to the city to enjoy happiness. What exactly did she want to do?Fang Xiao Juan said: \"Don't get agitated! I was strict with Da Qiao before. Now I have reflected on it. As her biological mom, I want to make up for her and take her to the city to enjoy a good life with me.\"Lin Hui's face flushed: \"Don't even think about it. Da Qiao will never go with you!\"She didn't believe a word of what Fang Xiao Juan said!Fang Xiao Juan frowned, \"Lin Hui, you can't be too selfish. What future can Da Qiao have with you in this countryside? I'm different. I can take her to the big city, dress her well, and send her to the best school. In the future, I will find her a high-ranking family in the city. She won't have to worry about anything in her life!\"Fang Xiao Juan will think for Da Qiao's wellbeing?This was as strange as the sun rising from the west!The longer she talked, the more vigilant Lin Hui became on the inside. She felt she must have some shady conspiracy. No matter, she won't let Da Qiao be taken away by her.She held her belly and planned to run past Fang Xiao Juan. Then she can tell her in-laws about this earlier. That way, they could guard against Fang Xiao Juan.Fang Xiao Juan noticed that she was about to leave and subconsciously reached out to grabbed her arm. With a pull, Lin Hui lost her stability and fell to the ground with a wobble of her feet.Lin Hui let out an \"Ouch\". Her face instantly turned pale: \"Someone! Murder!\"Fang Xiao Juan was stunned. She really didn't want to attack Lin Hui.When Lin Hui shouted, she panicked and bent over to cover her mouth.At this moment, a soft, waxy and imposing voice came from a distance: \"You're not allowed to touch my mom!\"Fang Xiao Juan looked up and saw Da Qiao running towards her with a sullen face. Beside her, a Tibetan Mastiff sized dog followed.When Da Qiao saw her biological mom's actions, she thought she was going to hit someone. She was so scared that her heart was about to jump out!She desperately ran. Unfortunately she was too young and couldn't eat up with such a long distance.Her gaze fell on Pi Pi, who was beside her. She fiercely gritted her teeth: \"Pi Pi, go!\"Pi Pi responded with two barks and ran as fast as a gust of wind. In the blink of an eye, it ran to Fang Xiao Juan and tackled hard...Fang Xiao Juan screamed in fright and crashed to the ground!When she opened her eyes again, the big dog pressed down on her with its sharp teeth at her neck. With just a little force, her neck would be bitten off!She was so frightened that her face lost all color. Her whole body trembled like a sieve and went. A stream of yellow urine flowed out.Da Qiao ran over with red cheeks. Frowning, she worriedly asked: \"Mom, how are you? Are you injured?\"Lin Hui was also frightened by this scene. Only when she saw Da Qiao, did she recover her wits: \"Don't be afraid, Da Qiao. Mom is fine.\"Da Qiao didn't believe this at all, her mom's face was clearly drained of color from fear. She turned back and glared at Fang Xiao Juan, \"You baddie. I'm going to tell my Grandmother and get her to punch you to death!\"Fang Xiao Juan was filled with fear, hatred, and anger!This was her own child. Although she had criticized her a little bit in this life, she had spoiled her for decades in her last life. Simply a heartless jerk!But she didn't dare to move. The dog's teeth was still at her neck. As soon as she made a move, he would let out a fierce \"woooo\" sound.When Da Qiao rushed over here, she had already attracted other people's attention. At this moment, someone was already running towards them.Lin Hui was afraid that when others saw it, they would blame Da Qiao for being unfilial. So she quickly waved to Da Qiao and said, \"Da Qiao, come and help Mom up.\"Only then Da Qiao turned around and carefully helped her mom up. She also thoughtfully helped her clean off the dirt on her body.The villagers ran over and saw Fang Xiao Juan being pinned to the ground by Qiao's dog with its sharp teeth at her neck. They gasped in fright.\"My God, what happened? This dog isn't going to kill people, right?\"\"I think I heard someone shout murder just now. Who the hell is trying to kill who?\"\"Oh, look! Fang Xiao Juan p*ssed herself! I wonder if Educated Youth Meng will insist on marrying her when he sees her ugly appearance?\"When Fang Xiao Juan heard the latter, she was so angry that her breath almost couldn't come up and died on the spot!Qiao Family and the production team leader also came one after another.Qiao Zhen Jun was panting from the run. He supported Lin Hui and said worriedly, \"Hui Hui, are you alright? Do you feel any discomfort? I'll take you to the hospital now!\"\"Don't worry, I'm fine, and the babies are fine.\"Lin Hui didn't get much injured. She hadn't removed her hands that held her belly when she fell to the ground just now. So apart from the pain in her butt, she was fine.Qiao Zhen Jun hurriedly asked Da Qiao if she was injured. He was greatly relieved when he heard Da Qiao say that she was fine.Qiao Xiu Zhi came over, glanced at Fang Xiao Juan on the ground, hugged Da Qiao and spoke, \"Were you scared?\"Da Qiao grasped her grandmother's neck before pointed to Fang Xiao Juan on the ground and uttered, \"Grandmother, she pushed Mom and wanted to pinch her. I don't want to call her Mom anymore!\"Although this was a bit confusing, everyone can still understand it all at once.What was Fang Xiao Juan aiming for?She was going to be an official wife in the city. Why go and provoke Qiao Family? It can't be that she can't let Qiao Zhen Jun go?Fang Xiao Juan wanted to explain, but she couldn't open her mouth. When she heard Da Qiao's words, she trembled with fury!Old woman Fang and Wang Shui Sheng came over together. Seeing her soon-to-be-official's-wife daughter pinned on the ground by the dog, she patted her thigh and jumped three feet high: \"Oh, my poor daughter! Why is she being bullied like this? Leader, hurry up. Come and save my daughter!\"Wang Shui Sheng withdrew the hand that was being grasped by old woman Fang. He impatiently responded, \"What are you howling for? It's not certain who is bullying who!\"Old woman Fang sat on the ground and slapped her thighs as she cried, \"Oh, Leader is helping his in-laws. He's letting my daughter get bitten to death by a dog! My deputy's secretary future son-in-law! Come and save Xiao Juan! !\"Everyone: \"...\"At this time, she purposely called out the words 'deputy's secretary'. She blatantly wanted want everyone to know their Fang Family had climbed the high branch?Wang Shui Sheng's patient was reached its limit. But he didn't want to see the production team die. So he had to say to Qiao Family: \"You guys should let the dog get off. Be careful of endangering a life.\"Only then did Qiao Xiu Zhi called out, \"Pi Pi, come here!\"Usually Pi Pi obeyed Qiao Family's orders, but this time he didn't move.Seeing this, Da Qiao hurriedly urged, \"Pi Pi, Grandmother is calling you. Come here quickly!\"Only then did Pi Pi loosen Fang Xiao Juan's neck. But when he turned around, his paws deliberately pressed Fang Xiao Juan's stomach and stepped on her.Pi Pi was the size of an adult Tibetan Mastiff. Weighed more than 60kg. Such a heavy weight on Fang Xiao Juan's stomach was bound to make her facial features twist from pain.Only then did old woman Fang get up from the ground and ran over to help her daughter up: \"My poor daughter, are you injured? Do you want your elder brother to run to the station and call the police?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi coldly snorted: \"Perfect. We also want to go to the police. Since you dare to attack pregnant women, just wait and go to jail!\"Fang Xiao Juan met her gaze. Her heart shrank at once: \"I didn't do anything to Lin Hui. I just pulled her lightly. She didn't stand firm and fell by herself. It has nothing to do with me!\"Lin Hui glared at her angrily, \"You vicious woman, I'm fine now. But if there is anything wrong with the babies in my stomach, I will definitely fight with you!\"Old woman Fang jumped up, \"Aren't you fine now? You didn't miscarry...\"SLAP SLAP!Before she could finish speaking, she was slapped twice by Qiao Xiu Zhi. Two teeth were slapped out!Everyone was stunned. They witnessed the slap print on old woman Fang's face quickly became red and swollen. They felt like they could her pain in their hearts.Old woman Fang was also stunned. It took a while for her to regain her senses. She opened her mouth and wanted to cry, but was stopped by Qiao Xiu Zhi...\"Shut up! If you dare to talk nonsense again, I'll slap you! Go to the police if you want!\"Old woman Fang's mouth was wide open. She could neither yell or not yell. It was too embarrassing.Fang Xiao Juan gritted her teeth and was so exasperated: \"I accidentally pulled Lin Hui. I can apologize. But if you say I attacked Lin Hui, I will never admit it!\"She didn't dare to call the police. If the matter got bigger, she was afraid that she wouldn't be able to get the letter of introduction and go to the city!Qiao Family didn't want to make trouble big.Tian Family had been eyeing Qiao Family recently. Who knows if they will take the opportunity to suppress Qiao Family?Wang Shui Sheng saw the stalemate between the two families and stood up, \"All of you tell me what happened? Fang Xiao Juan, why did you pull old Second Qiao's wife?\"Fang Xiao Juan glanced at Da Qiao, who was being held in Qiao Xiu Zhi's arms, before saying miserably: \"Leader, I came to find her because she will soon have her own children. Plus her ex-husband's children, that's three sons in total. She will definitely not take care of my daughter then. So I told her that I wanted to bring Da Qiao with me to the big city to enjoy a good life. Who knew that she would rather let Da Qiao be a mud leg in this countryside than returning the child to me. The two of us got emotional and a little pull happened.\"Hearing this, Qiao Xiu Zhi frowned.When did Fang Xiao Juan know how to speak so well?Da Qiao hugged her grandmother tightly, buried her face in her neck and trembled, \"Grandmother, I don't want to go with her!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi came back to her senses and patted her on the back lightly: \"Don't worry. As long as Grandmother is here, no one can take you away!\"Everyone saw that Da Qiao was so frightened that her face was pale and panic was in her voice. Obviously, she had no feelings for her biological mother, Xiao Juan. If there were, it was only fear.But who's to blame?Back then, the way she treated Da Qiao! She tormented a good child to that state. How could the child not be afraid of her mom?Some people felt Da Qiao was too stupid; to actually giving up such a good opportunity. When she grows up, she will definitely regret it!When old woman Fang heard that her daughter wanted to take Da Qiao to Hu City, she immediately screamed in pain: \"Xiao Juan, since this white-eyed wolf doesn't want to go, why bother with her. Your elder brother has two sons. You can bring any one of them if you want. It's not a problem to bring the two together!\"Annoyed, Fang Xiao Juan uttered, \"Mom, can you be quiet for a while?\"Old woman Fang blushed with anger. Now that her daughter had climbed the high branch, Fang Family will depend on her in the future. So she endured it.Fang Xiao Juan turned around and explained to everyone, \"I know that I mistreated Da Qiao. Now I want to make it up for her and take her to a big city to enjoy a blessed life with me. And Qiao Family is unwilling! Everyone saw it just now. The child let the dog bite me and said she won't recognize me as her mom in the future. It really hurts my heart!\"Xing Hua spoke out: \"Elder Sister Xiao Juan, why do you feel depressed for that white-eyed wolf? According to me, you should cut ties with this child to save her from dragging you down in the future!\"Fang Xiao Juan's eyes flashed. That was exactly what she had in mind!She wanted to force Qiao Family to cut off Da Qiao's ties with herself. This way, she can explain to Meng Hong Guang.Old woman Fang wanted to leave the opportunity to her grandson and quickly approved: \"Yes, yes. It's better to cut off the relationship with this white-eyed wolf as soon as possible. She's currently so young and dares to attack you. What will she be like when she grows up?\"Fang Xiao Juan turned to Qiao Xiu Zhi and said, \"Auntie Xiu Zhi, I really want to make it up for Da Qiao. If you don't want me to take her away, I can only cut off ties with her. You should consider it!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi couldn't help laughing: \"No need to consider. You can cut off the mother-daughter relationship with Da Qiao now!\"Why must they cut off the mother-daughter relationship because she can't take her away? She couldn't understand the logic between the two.But it didn't matter if they understand or not. The key point was to quickly seize the opportunity to get Da Qiao and her cleanly break off!Everyone said that Fang Xiao Jjuan climbed the high branch. From now on, Fang Family will be prosperous. Well, she don't high hope of that. Fang Xiao Juan was a calamity. Even if she becomes an official wife, she will cause trouble!This time, she suddenly wanted to take Da Qiao away. Definitely not for the excuse she given. She couldn't guess what Fang Xiao Juan's purpose was. What was certain was... she had bad intentions!She and Xue Chuan were also worried that she would implicate Da Qiao in the future. Now that she suddenly proposed to cut off the relationship herself, they couldn't be any more happier!Seeing Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't even think about it, Fang Xiao Juan felt that her face was being rubbed on the ground.She looked at Qiao Zhen Jun with a dark face: \"As Da Qiao's dad, don't you want Da Qiao to live a good life?\"Qiao Zhen Jun responded: \"Only by cutting ties with you, Da Qiao would live a good life!\"Fang Xiao Juan gnashed her teeth in hatred upon hearing this!Some people had wanted to persuade Qiao Family to think about it again. After all, it meant living Hu City. Although Da Qiao recognized Shen family as her god-family, can godparents be compared to her biological mom?Besides, no matter how powerful Shen Family was, it was only in the town. While Fang Xiao Juan was going to marry into city!Qiao Xiu Zhi refused with a very firm attitude. Didn't give Fang Xiao Juan any chance to go back on her words. She got her write a document to sever the relationship on the spot.Fang Xiao Juan didn't want to drag it anymore. In a moment of anger, she caught an educated youth on the spot to write a mother-daughter tie severance letter.In the tie severance letter, it clearly stated that she and Da Qiao will sever the mother-daughter relationship from today. She give up the right to raise Da Qiao and will never pay a penny. In the future, Da Qiao will not have to give her old age care no matter what!After Qiao Xiu Zhi confirmed that the content of the severance book was right before four copies of it were made. She got Fang Xiao Juan to sign and fingerprint each. She also got the production team's cadre and reputable elders to be witnesses.These four severance books were distributed between Fang Xiao Juan, herself, Qiao Zhen Jun, and the production team. This was to prevent Fang Xiao Juan from flipping her face and not admitting it in the future!Fang Xiao Juan took in Qiao Xiu Zhi guarding against her like this and felt steaming with anger again.Xiao Qiao was very happy when she knew that her mom cut off the mother-daughter relationship with Da Qiao. She also agreed with this method!If her mom really brought Da Qiao to Hu City, she would really vomit to death!The people in the production team watched a big show today. Some sighed, some gloated, and some thought Qiao Family was too stupid!Qiao Family didn't bother to pay any attention to what other people thought. After confirming that Lin Hui wasn't injured, they went home and prepared a large table of good dishes to celebrate.That night, Qiao Xiu Zhi kept Da Qiao back to sleep with them.She rubbed Da Qiao's hair and said, \"Do you blame Grandmother for making you cut off from your mom?\"Da Qiao stuck over and rubbed against her grandmother's palm: \"I don't. I know Grandmother is doing this for my own good!\"She didn't really understand what it meant to cut off the mother-daughter relationship. She didn't want to leave with her mom. She doesn't want to leave her grandparents!Qiao Xiu Zhi rubbed her hair as she thought to herself; if Fang Xiao Juan knew that she had lost such a lucky baby, how she'll regret it!...At the army's side.Wang Yan Sheng received a letter from the production team. When he saw the crooked lettering on the envelope, the corners of his mouth couldn't help but lift.Sentinel Xiao Li saw that well-known expressionless and selfless colonel\u00a0showed a gentle smile, his body shivered all over. Goosebumps emerged all over his body.At the same time, he felt as if he was bitten by an ant. Extremely curious, he uttered: \"Colonel, who sent you the letter?\"Wang Yan Sheng glanced at him and coldly responded, \"Like to meddle so much? I think you have too much physical strength, why don't I get you to run ten laps?\"Xiao Li repeatedly shook his head in fright: \"Colonel, please forgive me. I don't dare to be curious any more! I've never seen Colonel\u00a0smile so softly before. This letter... It should be sent by Colonel's family!\"Colonel\u00a0had received letters from home before. There was never any extra expression on his face. But now, a flower was almost blooming on his face. Something must be up!Wang Yan Sheng took the letter and turned around to walk out: \"The letter was sent by my fianc\u00e9e!\"Fianc\u00e9e?When did\u00a0Colonel\u00a0have a fianc\u00e9e?Xiao Li was stunned. He wanted to ask Colonel, but Wang Yan Sheng had already left.Wang Yan Sheng was full of enthusiasm with the letter in hand. He just wanted to go back and take it out. However, he was stopped halfway by a gentle voice...\"Colonel Wang, wait a moment.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWang Yan Sheng didn't need to look back to know who was calling him.Dong Li Li, a nurse at the Military Region Hospital. She was also the niece of Commander-in-Chief Liang's wife.Before he was seriously injured on the mission, Dong Li Li was responsible for taking care of him after being sent to the military hospital. After that, he often 'ran into' her in many places.He turned his head around and saw Dong Li Li jogging toward him in a white dress. A bright smile was pasted on her face.\"Colonel\u00a0Wang, it's really you. I was worried that I've recognized the wrong person!\" Dong Li Li ran over. Raising her palm-sized melon face, she mischievously stuck out her tongue.Wang Yan Sheng indifferently responded, \"Nurse Dong, may I ask what are you looking for me for?\"Dong Li Li seemed to be used to his expressionless face and raised the fruit in her hand: \"My maternal aunt sent me a large bag of apples. My appetite is too small to finish it. So I would like Colonel\u00a0Wang to help me. Can you help me demolish a few?\"Dong Li Li was beautiful. She had a youthful and lively personality. On top of that, she had a maternal uncle who was the commander-in-chief. If someone else met her, they would have taken the initiative to chase after her. But it was a pity that the person she met was Wang Yan Sheng.Wang Yan Sheng's face didn't change at all. He coldly refused: \"I don't like apples. If Nurse Dong can't eat them, you can share the apples with other comrades in the hospital. I have to go back and read the letter. I will go first.\"Dong Li Li's heart was filled with disappointment. She had already hinted it so clearly. Why was he still indifferent?Was she not beautiful enough? Or did she not meet his requirements?Dong Li Li felt depressed. However, she didn't want to give up like that. So she smiled again: \"Apologies, I didn't know that Colonel\u00a0Wang was in a hurry to go back and read a letter. This letter... Was it sent by Colonel\u00a0Wang's family?\"Her gaze fell on the envelope in his hand and tried to see who the sender of the letter. Unfortunately it was blocked by his hand. she could only see some crooked characters on it. At a glance, it seemed to be written by someone uneducated.Wang Yan Sheng replied: \"Yes. My fianc\u00e9e wrote it to me.\"Fianc\u00e9e?The smile on Dong Li Li's face froze. She was struck by lightning: \"Co, Colonel\u00a0Wang... when did you have a fianc\u00e9e? Why didn't I hear about it?\"\"It was set when I went home last time. See you.\" After speaking, he ignored the other party, turned around, and strode away.Dong Li Li watched his tall back. Her eyes gradually reddened.Wang Yan Sheng returned to the accommodation and couldn't wait to open the envelope. After reading the letter, his brows furrowed.How arrogant and powerful the town's Revolutionary Committee was, he had occasionally heard his elder brother mention it before. But this matter was out of his control. And he had always been in the army, so he never thought of going against the Revolutionary Committee.Now Qiao Family was being targeted by the other party. Although Qiao Family wasn't at fault, it seem they will not let Qiao Family go out of their own selfishness.He circled the room twice before putting the letter away. He turned around and went out again.His connections were limited, so he had to ask Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang for help....The teacher from Community Primary School came to the production team in person and brought some good news to Qiao Family.First, Qiao Dong He was admitted to the town's junior high with the top 50 rank in the county. Second, Da Qiao maintained her first place in the whole grade. Third, An Ping had made great progress in his test. The two results added up to a hundred!\"I had said I will definitely bring back 100!\" An Ping jumped up and down the room with joy like a monkey.Qiao Dong Ying mocked him: \"Look at how excited you are. To the unknown, they would think you got a 100% in one test!\"An Ping scratched his ears and said, \"Second Elder Sister, I have improved. Compared to your 60 percent, which has remained unchanged for thousands of years. I think Grandfather and Grandmother will definitely praise me this time!\"Qiao Dong He flushed with joy knowing that she had been admitted to the town's junior high school. What's more, with such good grades.Seeing her younger sister like this, she was a little anxious: \"Dong Ying, do you still mind that matter from the past?\"Qiao Dong Ying wasn't actually stupid at all. When she first started school, her grades were the best among the three siblings. However her personality was wild. She liked to make more trouble and fought more than boys. Truly a best example of a bad student.In one mid-term exam, she scored more than 90 percent in both tests. Their teacher-in-charge at the time didn't believe that she did the exam by herself and announced that she was cheating in front of all the students. Qiao Dong Ying, who was only eight years old at the time, was furious to the point that she overturned the table!Although the matter was thoroughly investigated later and the teacher had apologized to Qiao Dong Ying, but Qiao Dong Ying never took the exam seriously. She only filled out enough questions for 60 percent in each exam.Qiao Dong Ying smiled at her elder sister: \"Elder Sister, don't worry about me. You got admitted to junior high school! Our family will have bicycle soon. Guess who in our family will grasp how to ride the bicycle first?\"Knowing that her younger sister was a very decisive person, Qiao Dong He sighed in her heart. She went along with her younger sister's words: \"I guess it should be Younger Sister Da Qiao.\"Younger Sister Da Qiao was so smart. She can learn anything just from looking once. She envied her to death.Qiao Dong Ying pointed: \"Elder Sister, no matter how smart Younger Sister Da Qiao is, do you think she can ride a bicycle with her small height? I think our grandmother should be the first to grasp it!\"Qiao Dong He patted his head: \"Why didn't I think of this. Younger Sister Da Qiao isn't tall enough...\"\"Elder Cousin Sister, I have grown a lot taller!\"Da Qiao walked in from the outside with a pouting mouth, very dissatisfied with her two cousins' remark about her not being tall.Since consuming jade bead water, her skin had turned fairer while her height grown a lot taller. But no matter how tall she was, she was only a seven-year-old child. It was definitely impossible to surpass her elder cousins.When Qiao Dong He saw her sister's aggrieved appearance, her heart softened and quickly coaxed: \"That's right. Compared to other children, you are already very tall. Just now, Elder Cousin Sister misspoke. Still, the bicycle seat is too high. Even Elder Cousin Sister can't ride it.\"Da Qiao wasn't really angry either. After being coaxed by her cousin, she quickly became jolly again: \"Elder Cousin Sister, you are really amazing! Didn't you say you wanted to eat fried pastry last time? I'll make it for you tomorrow!\"Qiao Dong He's heart softened. She stretched out her hand to squeeze her younger sister's fair and tender face, \"Okay. Elder Cousin Sister thank you first!\"\"Listeners have a share! Younger Sister Da Qiao, I want to eat it too!\" An Ping brought his big head closer and sucked in his saliva.Qiao Dong Ying laughed at him: \"Look at your unpromising appearance. I finally discover, where there is food, there is you!\"An Ping didn't feel embarrassed at all: \"Food is people's prime need. Second Elder Sister, don't you think that eating can make people very happy?\"The education level of community's primary school had always been inferior to that of the town. Despite being unable to compare with the county's primary school, the community's primary school gained face at the Education Bureau due to Qiao Dong He getting such good results in the exam this time.The principal was over the moon and specially rewarded Qiao Dong He with two pens, two notebooks, and two yuan. When Qiao Dong He saw these rewards, her face turned into a red apple.As soon as the teacher left, Wan Chun Ju walked in with little Dong Yun in her arms: \"Where is the money the teacher gave you? Give it to me!\"Qiao Dong He's face flushed red again. But this time it was out of anger: \"Mom, I want to save that money myself.\"Wan Chun Ju stretched out her hand and hollered, \"What are need is there for a child to hold so much money? Take it out!\"Qiao Dong Ying said: \"Mom, my grandmother has spoken. She said the money is for my elder sister. If you keep at this, I will tell my grandmother!\"Wan Chun Ju was so furious that she wanted to stomp her feet: \"You dead girl, you only know how to tattle every day! I am your mom. What worry do you have with leaving the money with me? Dong He, you are thirteen years old this year. I don't think there's any need for you to study any further. Stay at home for two years. I'll get Matchmaker Huang to find you a good family to marry into later!\"Embarrassed and angry, Qiao Dong He bit her lip. She was close to tears.Seeing her elder sister being aggrieved, Qiao Dong Ying was so mad that she stood up. She was prepared to go out to complain to her grandmother when she heard Da Qiao softly utter...\"Eldest Aunt, if Eldest Cousin Sister doesn't go to town to study, Grandmother will definitely not buy a bicycle. Then Eldest Uncle can't use the bicycle to drive you around the production team. What a pity!\"Wan Chun Ju was stunned when she heard these words.Get her man to cycle her around the production team?If that's the case, the women in the entire production team will envy her to death!The more she thought about it, the brighter her eyes became. She can't wait for her mother-in-law to buy a bicycle now. Even if she doesn't know how to ride it, she can push the bicycle around dozen of times in front of the women in the production team. That will definitely get their envy!But if Eldest Daughter goes to school, no one in the family can help her with the housework.Since Chen Qiao Qiao left, she had to take care of her youngest daughter as well as doing some housework.She originally wanted her eldest daughter to stop studying. That way Eldest Daughter can stay at home to help take care of her youngest daughter and do housework. Along the way, she can earn some work points.But now, she was in conflict.In the end, vanity prevailed over other thoughts. She coughed: \"After some thoughts, women should study some more. Dong He, you should go to school.\"After she finished speaking, she handed little Dong Yun to her eldest daughter and turned around to find Qiao Zhen Guo. She wanted to tell him in advance to learn to ride a bicycle quickly. That way she could show off and go around in circles in the production team.As soon as her mom departed, Qiao Dong Ying reached out and pinched Da Qiao's face, \"You little clever monkey. You can convince my mom in one sentence! Bravo!\"Qiao Dong He regained her smile. She nodded like a pecking chick: \"Younger Sister Da Qiao, your brain turn really fast!\"Although her grandmother can suppress her mom and attending school wasn't a problem, her mom will nag in her ear from time to time in dissatisfaction. Which was very demoralizing.But now she had been persuaded by Younger Sister Da Qiao, she won't nag her in the future. Younger Sister Da Qiao was amazing!Da Qiao's little face flushed. She puffed up her chest and said, \"En en, my brain turns very fast. If you have any problem in the future, feel free to ask me. I'm smart!\"\"Pfft...\"Hit by Younger Sister Da Qiao's cuteness, Qiao Dong He generously decided to take five dimes out to buy candies for everyone to eat.Qiao Dong Ying couldn't help but rolled her eyes. Though Younger Sister Da Qiao was smart, she was also very vain.Wan Chun Ju didn't find her man. Still her heart burned with the desire to show off. She turned around and ran out to boast to everyone.\"How is your child's final exam? It's only in the 70s. Not that great! My family's Dong He got in the top fifty in the county!\"\"You didn't hear it just now. The teacher said my Dong He is the smartest student in the whole community and had rewarded my Dong He with three yuan. There are also a good few pens and notebooks. Did you get any? No? Then that's right. Who told your daughter to be not as smart as my Dong He!\"\"By the way, my mother-in-law said that if Dong He can get admitted to the town's junior high school, she will buy a bicycle for our eldest branch and make it easy for child's dad to pick her up from the town in the future. How precious a bicycle is? I can't bear to spend such money, but my mother-in-law said that all the children I gave birth are smart and must reward our eldest branch!\"Everyone listened to Wan Chun Ju's boasting to the sky. Some were envious, some were jealous, and some said sour words.\"It's just a girl. It's enough to know how to write her own name. Only you Qiao Family has a lot of money! To actually let her go to the town to attend junior high!\"\"Ain't that right! What's the point of a girl reading so many books? Sooner or later, she'll be another's family, no? I say, Eldest Qiao's wife, it better that you don't let your Dong He attend school. Instead, let her help with housework at home. She can go to the field to supplement the family?\"When the villagers said this, they weren't targeting Qiao Family. This was what everyone thought in their hearts.Nowadays, many people can't get enough to eat. How can there be spare money for their children to go to school? Family with good conditions would send their sons to school. As for sending daughters like Qiao Family, one can count how many in total with one hand.There were also some who weren't too patriarchal and let their daughters or granddaughters go to school. But only for one or two years. Just enough for them learn to write their own names and be able to count. As for further education in higher grades, there were less and less girls.The production team had a total of ten taking the primary school graduation examination this time. Qiao Dong He was the only girl. The others were boys. Among those boys, their family didn't plan to let them continue their studies even if they passed the entrance examination,In the hearts of the villagers, no matter how much they study, it was useless. Haven't they witnessed all the educated youths being sent to work in the countryside?When Wan Chun Ju heard everyone's response, she immediately became displeased. She slapped her thigh, \"You guys understand sh*t! Who said it's useless for daughters to study? You guys clearly favor boys over girls! Aren't you female? Looking down on women means looking down on yourself! Why are you so ignorant? That's because you study too little!\"Everyone: \"...\"Damn, had Wan Chun Ju's brain been flooded?What face did she have to say that everyone prefer son over daughter> Wasn't she the same?Someone retorted back, \"Speaking as if you don't favor boy over girl and that you had read a lot of books yourself. Pah, you don't even know one, two, three, four. How dare you talk about us?\"Wan Chun Ju jumped up and spat back, \"I am illiterate! Wasn't that because I been poisoned by the old society? However, I have a heart to pursue progress. I don't know how to write, but I am willing to let my daughters go study. As long as they can study, I will keep supporting them. Can you do what I do? If you can't, stop b*tching!\"Everyone: \"...\"Feck, when did Wan Chun Ju's thought-wave develop so much?She spewed out a lot of persuasive content. Simply like seeing ghost!Seeing everyone rendered speechless by herself, Wan Chun Ju was so proud that she turned around and went to seek the next boasting battlefield.In the evening, Qiao's old house made another table of good dishes to celebrate the few children's progress.When Qiao Zhen Guo find out his daughter was admitted to junior high school, he was thrilled: \"Mom, when will we buy the bicycle you mentioned last time?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi responded: \"How can you buy it because you want to. To buy a bicycle, a coupon is necessary!\"Qiao Zhen Min, who had been sitting on the side as he ate in low spirit, interrupted at this point, \"Mom, you don't have to worry about this. I'll ask my friend to help and get a coupon back.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi had already guessed what her son was doing in private. Since he went to the transportation company in the county, the salary he brought home doubled. And some of things he bought back were costly and couldn't be bought with money alone.After discussing with Xue Chuan, she didn't plan to stop him. Privately, she reminded him to be more careful.Hearing his words now, she nodded: \"Okay. When are you going back to the county?\"Qiao Zhen Min answered, \"I'll depart tomorrow. I'll leave little Wan'er to Dad and Mom's care!\"After he finished speaking, he turned his head to look at his daughter who was beside Da Qiao. Da Qiao was in midst of feeding her. Her eyes were curved into crescents. Which was very different from her unresponsive appearance in the past.With his parents and Da Qiao present, he can rest assured even when he goes to the county.That night, Wan Chun Ju was so excited from the bicycle matter that she couldn't sleep. She nudged her man with her elbow and spoke, \"Zhen Guo, once you learn to cycle, take me around in the production team.\"Qiao Zhen Guo yawned and refused: \"Wife, your weight will crush the bicycle. Once the bicycle is bought, remember to stay away from it.\"She almost spurted blood from fury: \"...\"Her weight was fine. She touched the flesh on her stomach and thought about it: \"Then I will eat one bowl of rice less at each meal in the future. Once you learnt, take me around later, okay?\"Qiao Zhen Guo didn't answer.She turned around and saw that her man was snoring. He had already gone to dreamland.This damn man was really pissing her off!...It was all good news for Qiao Family. While Chen Qiao Qiao, who was in the town, seem to be living in hell these days.\"Mom, Eldest Brother, Second Elder Brother, let me out!\"Chen Qiao Qiao patted the wooden door hard. Which only result in her hand becoming red and pained. No one came.That day, her family went to pick her up from the production team and made her to nod her head to the divorce with Qiao Zhen Min. It was because they had obtained Tian Family's promise. As long as she was willing to divorce, Tian Family would recognize her as their daughter-in-law and recognize the baby in her womb.She felt that she was world's number one woman with the hardest choices. She fell in love with two men at the same time. Qiao Zhen Min had abandoned her, while Tian Jian Min was willing to marry her. What else could she do?So after slight hesitation, she packed her things and returned to her maternal home that day and divorced Qiao Zhen Min the next day.Seeing Qiao Zhen Min leave without looking back and the divorce book in hand, her heart throbbed in pain. But at thought that she could be with Tian Jian Ming and give birth to their child, her heart filled with sweetness and hope again.Who knew that as soon as she got home, her divorce certificate was hidden away by her family. Afterward, she was locked in the room.At first she didn't understand what her family was doing. Only when her mom came in with a bowl of abortion medicine, she understood.Her mother told her to obediently drink the abortion medicine. Saying that she would be able to marry again once she recover.Shocked and angered, she asked her mom why she did this. Her mom told her that Tian Family had never planned to let her in, let alone the baby in her belly.She didn't believe it and rushed out to find Tian Jian Ming to get to the bottom of it. However, she was pushed back into the room by her eldest brother and second elder brother. Once again, she was detained.Her elder brother had even pointed to her nose: \"Little Sister, please take a look at yourself in the mirror. With your looks, do you think people really like you? He's just playing with you. You are so stupid to treat it seriously!\"Second Elder Brother followed up: \"That's right, Little Sister. I advise you to abort the baby. Then obediently stay at home for a year or two. Once the matter subsides, you can find another man to marry. If you don't obey, our whole family will be dragged to death by you!\"She screamed in fury and wanted to frantically rush out. Only to be slapped hard a few times, get her hands and feet tied, and her mouth covered with a cloth. They didn't release her until yesterday when they saw her giving up.The door was opened with a squeak. Mother Chen walked in again with a bowl of abortion medicine in her hand.She looked at her daughter and spoke, \"Mom knows you're unwilling. But who can you blame? Wasn't it all because of your shamelessness? You don't want such a good life and persisted on doing such shameless things. If it spreads out, our Chen Family's face will be ruined by you!\"Hearing her mom's words, Chen Qiao Qiao felt like needles stabbing in her heart: \"Mom, I beg you. Let me go out. I'm going to find Jian Ming. He said he loves me. He won't be willing to get rid of the baby in my belly!\"Mother Chen said: \"It already reached this point and you still won't wake up? Drink the abortion medicine. Your dad and two elder brothers had said if you aren't obedient, they would marry you to a remote mountain village. You can't come back when you want to then!\"She didn't want to force her daughter. But what can she do?Tian Family had said if they couldn't keep Qiao Qiao's mouth shut, they would make it impossible for Chen Family to stay in the town any longer. Not only would their two sons be kicked out of their jobs, they might even be ruined!But if they do as they say, they will give Chen Family 100 yuan once the matter is over!With 100 yuan, the jobs of her two sons, and the safety of her family on the line, she could only choose to sacrifice her daughter.Seeing her mom coming over to force the abortion medicine in her mouth, Chen Qiao Qiao gritted her teeth hard and pushed her mom away.BOOM!The old porcelain bowl fell to the ground and shattered into several pieces.She stood up and rushed outside.She didn't believe Tian Jian Ming would treat her like this. She still remembered all the words he said. That's why, she wanted to find him and ask for an explanation!It was just that as soon as she ran to the door, she was caught by her eldest brother and second elder brother!The two of them dragged her back into the room again and quickly tied her up.She wanted to beg them to let her go, but her mouth was gagged. She couldn't utter a word.Half an hour later, a bowl of fresh abortion medicine was brought in again.Her jaw was forced open. The abortion pill was poured into her mouth as tears rolled down her cheeks.Ten minutes later, there was pained whimperings coming from the room.Chen Qiao Qiao rolled around on the bed. She almost fainted from the pain.The next day, Qiao Zhen Min was about to return to the county city. At this moment, Chu Family and Shen Family came to Qiao's house one after another.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShen Family was the first to arrive in the morning.As soon as the car entered the production team, it immediately attracted the attention of the villagers.\"Tsk tsk tsk, Qiao Family's god-relatives are here again. Truly enviable!\"\"This is their fate. No point envying them! In my opinion, it's actually pretty good that Da Qiao didn't go to Hu City with Fang Xiao Juan. Fang Xiao Juan used to treat that child badly. If she is taken away, who knows how she'll treat the child?\"\"That's right. So far away, Qiao Family has no way to know if she beat her to death!\"When Qiao Xiu Zhi saw the arrival of Shen Family, she went with Xue Chuan to ask for leave from the production team leader.Wang Family and Qiao Family were now somewhat in-laws. It went without saying Wang Shui Sheng approved very straightforwardly.Arriving at Qiao's old house, Qin Xiao Mei got off the car and looked around for Da Qiao's figure: \"Where's Da Qiao? She doesn't live in the old house, right?\"Just as Qiao Xiu Zhi was about to shake her head, she saw Da Qiao carrying a small bucket with three tails trialing after her.\"Oh, my dear Da Qiao. Come and give Godmother a hug. Godmother misses you!\" Qin Xiao Mei instantly perked up.\"Godmother, why are you here? I miss you too!\"Da Qiao ran over. Qin Xiao Mei hugged her and showered her little cheek with kisses. Her cheeks were soon reddened.Seeing his wife's behavior, Shen Shi Kai shook his head at this too much to bear sight: \"Look how red the child's face is. Such a grown person and still don't know how control yourself!\"Da Qiao smiled with curved eyes and softly spoke, \"Godfather, don't reprimand Godmother. I don't feel any pain at all!\"In fact, it really didn't hurt. Qin Xiao Mei loved her so much. She naturally knew how to control her strength. Still her skin was too tender. It would turn red from the slightest force.Qin Xiao Mei raised her head and rolled her eyes at her husband. She harumphed, \"Did you hear that? The child said it's all right. Actually, you're jealous of me, right?\"Although Shen Shi Kai was Da Qiao's godfather in name, to put it bluntly, the two weren't related by blood. So he never hugged or kissed Da Qiao. At most, rubbing the child's hair.Seeing his wife's mischievous appearance, Shen Shi Kai couldn't help shaking his head and burst into laughter. His eyes were full of doting.\"Elder Sister Da Qiao, what are you going to do with the bucket?\" Shen Tian You squeezed over and asked curiously.After not seeing him for a month or two, he seems to have gained a lot of weight again.Da Qiao turned to him and answered, \"We're going to catch loach. Younger Brother Tian You, you want to join?\"\"I want! I haven't caught a loach before!\" Shen Tian You's eyes were as bright as the stars in the sky, \"By the way, what about my Elder Sister Ying? Why haven't I seen her?\"Speak of the devil and the devil comes. As soon as his voice fell, he saw Qiao Dong Ying walking out of the old courtyard with two cages in her hands.The cages were made from bamboo strips. About 30 to 40 centimeters long with the ends shaped into conical funnels. In the past, these cages could be used to catch eels.\"Elder Sister Ying, I miss you so much!\" Shen Tian You saw his boss and immediately ran over. He took out all the white rabbit candies he brought from home.Qiao Dong Ying took one before telling him to share the candies with the others. She scanned him up and down and spoke, \"Why do I feel that you have gained a lot of weight? I think you should stop eating candy!\"When Shen Tian You heard this, he didn't become unhappy. Instead, he nodded like a pecking chick. \"Elder Sister Ying is right. I won't eat candy in the future!\"Qin Xiao Mei only felt her eyes hurt at the sight of her son's unpromising lackey behavior. Then again, if she really make him eat less sweet, she would gratefully thank her later.After getting the consent of the adults, the few children set out to catch loaches.Walking halfway, Da Qiao said to everyone: \"I have to find a friend. You go to the river first. We will go to find you soon.\"Qiao Dong He knew that she was going to find Huo Chi. She didn't say anything and took the initiative to hold her three tails.The three tails became teary-eyed. Little Yi Ming blinked his eyes and spoke, \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, you must come!\"The other two followers nodded their heads like chopping onion: \"You got to come!\"Seeing this, Qiao Dong Ying couldn't help rolling her eyes to the sky. If stranger saw this, they would have thought that this was some kind of large-scale life and death scene!Da Qiao pinched the three little dumplings' faces and solemnly promised: \"Don't worry. Elder Sister will come over soon. You have to listen to the other elder brothers and sisters, understand?\"\"Understand, we will be very good.\" The three little ones responded in unison.After parting, Da Qiao went to the pigsty to find Elder Brother Huo Chi.In the past, Huo Family was responsible for shoveling pig dung as well as cleaning other dung pit. During the peak farming period, they had to go to the field to help. There was no free time from morning to night.But after Huo Chi showed you the way last time and helped grow Chinese herbs, Huo Family only need to be in charge of the pigsty and guidance in raising Chinese herbs. They didn't need them for other things now.When Da Qiao dropped by, Huo Chi was helping his grandfather shoveling pig dung. She watched a bit before turning to quietly slip away. However, she was stopped by Huo Hua Qing.\"Qiao Family's girl, why are you silently leaving upon arrival?\"Hearing his grandfather's words, Huo Chi raised his head to find Da Qiao. He immediately put down the shovel in his hand and washed his hands before walking over: \"Why are you here? Are you looking for me for something?\"Seeing that she had been discovered, Da Qiao had to turn around and jollily responded: \"Hello Grandpa Huo, I originally wanted to come over and ask Elder Brother Huo Chi if he wanted to catch loach with us. But seeing that Elder Brother Huo Chi is busy, I don't want to disturb him.\"\"Chi'er, go play. There's not much work here. Grandfather can do it alone.\"Huo Hua Qing liked the girl in front of him very much. She was fair and clean. She had a very kind heart. If it weren't for her, this poor old man might have died of illness before. Thanks to her, Chi'er was able to systematically learn the knowledge from the textbooks.Huo Chi hesitated for a moment and said, \"Wait for me. I'll go with you after I shovel the remaining pig dung.\"Da Qiao nodded with a smile, and went to talk to Grandpa Huo while waiting for brother Huo Chi....Qiao's old house.After Shen Shi Kai sat down, he went straight to the point: \"I've heard from my dad about Second Brother Qiao's dismissal. I wanted to turn it around, but the surnamed Qiu didn't want to let go.\"Qiu Xin Yong was worried that his nephew messing around would spread to female party. So it was better to strike first and let the food factory dismiss Qiao Zhen Jun. Then confine Qiao Family to the countryside. This way, they wouldn't have the opportunity to talk nonsense everywhere.If it wasn't for their relationship with Shen Family and Qiao Hong Xia's marriage to Wang Yan Sheng, he would definitely not be so gentle. Qiao Family was so close to ruin because of this!Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't expect Shen Family to come here specially for this matter. She was very grateful: \"I've made you worry. You don't have to get involved in this matter. I'm afraid it will implicate you at that time!\"Qin Xiao Mei responded: \"What are you saying, Aunt Xiu Zhi? We are one family. Your business is our business. Surnamed Qiu has a lot of power in the town, we can't pull him down any time soon. Can only let you be aggrieved!\"The most aggrieved one in this matter was Qiao Zhen Min. He wore such a big green hat. Not only can he not be angry, but now he had to worry about his family. Now his family was implicated, he was going mad from fury.Shen Shi Kai nodded and spoke, \"Fifth Brother Qiao, I know that you have been wronged, but an arm can't twist the thigh. Once you offended the Tian Family, it's Qiao Family who will suffer. So in this matter, don't act upon your anger. You have to think about the long run!\"Qiao Zhen Min nodded with an ugly expression: \"Don't worry. I won't be impulsive!\"When the incident occurred, he really wanted to do a murder suicide with the adulterer. But he hollered awake by his mom.He wasn't alone. He had a family and a daughter. If he acts impulsively, he will only endanger his family!So he endured this breath. He didn't believe that surnamed Qiu could still be domineering for a lifetime. If surnamed Qiu could really conceal the sky for a lifetime, it could only be said that he was too unlucky!At this moment, a man's voice sounded from outside: \"Is this Qiao Zhen Min's house?\"Qiao Zhen Min was stunned when he heard the voice. He abruptly stood up: \"Why do this voice I hear sound like Chu Family's Eldest Brother?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi said: \"It sounds like it. Go out and have a look.\"Qiao Zhen Min acknowledged, turned around, and ran out.Qin Xiao Mei said: \"The Chu family you mentioned is the Chu Family that adopted little Wan'er?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded: \"It is that Chu Family. Just don't know if they are the ones who came.\"It took a few days to get here from Nanshan Count by bus. Very inconvenient. It wasn't the New Year or a festival at the moment. They can't think of why Chu Family came here.Qiao Zhen Min ran out and saw Chu Tian Bai standing at the door. His eyes lit up and he merrily smiled: \"Eldest Brother Chu, why are you here?\"Seeing Qiao Zhen Min, Chu Tian Bai also grinned, \"Finally found the right place! Our trip this time is for Sheng Mei's wedding. I thought I didn't have time to come here. So didn't notify you in advance. But Dong Xue has been missing little Wan'er these two days. She couldn't sleep or eat properly. We had to come here.\"Qiao Zhen Min quickly welcomed Chu Family in.This time around, it wasn't just Chu Tian Bai and his wife. There was also Chu Sheng Mei and her fianc\u00e9, Du Zhuo Cheng.Du Zhuo Cheng looked to be in twenty-four or twenty-five. He seemed well-mannered with a thin body and a pale face. In short, he didn't seem to have a particularly healthy body.Still, the talented man and beautiful woman were a good match.As soon as Dong Xue came in, she immediately sought for little Wan'er: \"Where is little Wan'er? Isn't she at home?\"When little Wan'er was taken away by Qiao Family, she couldn't eat or drink well. Every time she held the photo of little Wan'er with them, she felt her heart was empty.This trip's schedule was very tight. Still, she dearly missed little Wan'er. If she didn't see her, she will definitely lose sleep when she goes back.Qiao Zhen Min thought of his daughter and the smile on the corner of his mouth became deeper: \"Little Wan'er went to catch loach with her siblings. I'll bring her back later.\"At these words, Dong Xue's eyes lit up and exclaimed, \"Little Wan'er is willing to play with other children?\"Qiao Zhen Min nodded and said proudly: \"After little Wan'er came back, her personality has open up a lot under the care of her siblings. Now she can occasionally answer other people's questions!\"Chu Tian Bai and Dong Xue looked surprised.They had heard from friends about little Wan'er's condition. They knew that it was a mental developmental disorder called autism. It was very difficult to treat. Most likely, she'll live in her own world for the rest of her life and never interact with others.They didn't expect that there was such a big change in half a year. This was really exciting news. It was the right decision to make this trip!Noticing Qiao Zhen Min didn't mention his wife at all, it seem there was something wrong.Chu Tian Bai and his wife exchanged glances and politely chose not to touch this topic.Entering the main room, Shen Family stood up when they saw Chu Family.Although Shen Family and Chu Family's couple had never met each other, Chu Sheng Mei was a friend of Shen Lin Lin. The girls went to play at each other's home before. And with little Wan'er matter, both families knew of each other's existence. So they didn't have a sense of unfamiliarity when seeing each other now.After the greeting, Qiao Family and Shen Family thought of Chu Sheng Mei's upcoming wedding and congratulated her. They asked when the banquet would be held.Chu Sheng Mei's cheeks were stained with a crimson blush. She shyly responded: \"The wedding banquet is set in September. You must come to participate then!\"Du Zhuo Cheng worked in Nanshan County, but his family lived in Baocheng County. So the banquet will be held at the male's side.Both Qiao Family and Shen Family quickly agreed to go.Qiao Zhen Min stood up and spoke, \"You guys sit down for a while. I'll bring little Wan'er back.\"As he said that, he turned around and prepared to leave. However, he was stopped by Du Zhuo Cheng: \"Qiao Family's Fifth Brother, I'll go with you.\"Qiao Zhen Min was stunned for a moment. Soon he recovered, nodded and responded, \"Okay. You probably rarely come to the countryside. It's a good opportunity to walk around.\"When Chu Sheng Mei heard these words, she stood up and voiced her desire to look around.Naturally Qiao Zhen Min wouldn't refuse. So the three of them went out together.As soon as the three of them left, Shen Shi Kai felt a little awkward.Halfway through through their conversation, Chu Family had arrived. Although Qiao Zhen Min and Chu Family were god-relatives, this matter involved a man's face. He can't make the decision on his own and leak it out.However, Qiao Xiu Zhi told him to continue on. Old Fifth wasn't at fault in this matter. There was no need to hide it. Besides, it was definitely more important to think of countermeasures to deal with Tian and Qiu families than the face.Soon, Chu Family knew what happened to Qiao Family recently. They were shocked and furious after hearing it.Dong Xue gritted her teeth, \"Simply a bully! Just a deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee! Does he really think he can conceal the sky for a lifetime with only one hand?\"Chu Tian Bai frowned and asked, \"Brother Shen Shi, what do you think of this matter?\"Shen Shi Kai nodded: \"Qiu Xin Yong is invincible. He can freely kill people at any time. If he's always like this, he must have offended a lot of people over the years. There must be many people who want to kill him. I have recently instructed people to quietly collect his criminal evidence. Then find a way to report it to the top!\"When Chu Tian Bai heard this, he nodded: \"This is a good method. I'm afraid someone above is protecting him!\"Otherwise, how could the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee in a town commit evil for many years without any punishment?Shen Shi Kai frowned, \"You're right. They and the county magistrate of Baocheng County will soon become in-laws. It was heard the vice-governor had some connection with him. But I can't find anything.\"Chu Tian Bai pondered for a while and spoke, \"I have some connections at this side. After I go back, I'll find someone to clear up the way. If we work together, I don't believe that this bastard can't be killed!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan were very moved when they saw the two families spared no effort on a solution for Qiao Family.Xue Chuan stood up and went out to ask his eldest son to come back with some meat. He was preparing to cook for the two families at noon....Qiao Zhen Min walked towards the stream with Chu Sheng Mei and Du Zhuo Cheng.The last time Chu Sheng Mei came to the production team, she left quickly. She didn't have time to appreciate the scenery. She curiously looked around now.When passing by the field, the villagers saw Qiao Zhen Min walking with two stranger. The man and the woman didn't look like they were from the countryside by the way they dressed and their air. They became curious.\"Old Fifth Qiao, is this your relative? Why haven't I seen them before?\"Qiao Zhen Min vaguely responded. He didn't intend to tell everyone the true identity of Chu Family or let them know that they recognized little Wan'er as their goddaughter.After they walked away, everyone was working and talking at the same time.\"Qiao Family is really different. The deputy chief came here in the morning. Now there were relatives from the city. Tsk tsk tsk, I really envy them to death!\"\"It's not just Qiao Family. Fang Family is becoming better off, no? Look at Fang Xiao Juan now. No longer working in the fields. She's preparing to nurture her complexion fairer before going to the city to become an official wife!\"\"By the way, by the way, do you know why old Fifth Qiao divorced his wife? I've been inquiring about it for a long time, but I haven't found any news at all!\"\"Now you say that, I really don't know!\"\"Yeah, why did they get divorced? When little Wan'er was lost, they didn't get divorced. Now that the child have been back for so long, they get divorced out of the blue?\"Everyone couldn't help make wild guess. Some even suspected that the matter had something to do with Tian Jian Ming. Otherwise, why would Chen Qiao Qiao get a divorce as soon as Tian Jian Ming left. It wouldn't be such a coincidence, would it?Only when someone mentioned that Tian Jian Ming's maternal uncle was the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee and that his fianc\u00e9e was the niece of the county magistrate, no one dared to talk nonsense anymore.When Qiao Zhen Min trio passed by the door of Fang Xiao Juan's thatched hut, Fang Xiao Juan happened to be walking out of the house. She saw the trio and couldn't help but be startled.Qiao Zhen Min noticed Fang Xiao Juan's ugly expression and kept walking forward with a straight face.Fang Xiao Juan's eyes fell on Chu Sheng Mei and Du Zhuo Cheng. After staring at them for a long time, she found that she didn't know them. So she threw them to the back of her mind.A while ago, she got Xiao Qiao to write a letter to Meng Hong Guang about her and Da Qiao's severed mother-daughter relationship. After calculating the time, she should be able to receive a reply in the next two days.Although she put all the blame on Qiao Family, she still felt a little uneasy; fearing Meng Hong Guang would be displeased.When passing by the private plot, Chu Sheng Mei became curious when she saw that the plot wasn't growing vegetables.Qiao Zhen Min patiently explained to her: \"These small saplings are wolfberry, which can be used as both medicine and food. If they can be grown in large scale, it will be a good development path for the production team in the future.\"As he spoke, he told her what Wang Yan Sheng had said.Chu Sheng Mei listened with relish. She nodded her head again and again with appreciation: \"Ingenious! To be able to think of this method, that Regiment Leader Wang must be a very knowledgeable person. I'm so glad that he is engaged to Qiao Family's Third Elder Sister!\"Qiao Zhen Min smiled and nodded. He was also delighted that Third Elder Sister found a good marriage.Du Zhuo Cheng, who was following behind them all the way, had a smile on his lips. He hardly made a sound....When they came to the stream, they could hear the laughter of the children in the distance.\"Elder Sister Ying Elder Sister Ying, look. I caught a loach... ah... don't run away, loach!\"Shen Tian You caught a loach and proudly showed it to his boss. To his surprise, happiness would soon become sorrow. The loach twisted and slipped out of his hand.He stomped his feet in anger. His fleshy face was flushed with vexation.An Ping gleefully laughed. Unexpectedly, his feet slipped and he fell into the water with a \"bang\". His whole body suddenly became a drowned rat.This time, the entire Qiao Family burst into laughter.The best season for catching loach was actually in autumn and winter. However, the children were on vacation now. They had nothing to do at home. So they end up fishing and catching shrimp everywhere.There were also children at the other end of the stream chasing the loach. But the loach was too 'cunning'. Everyone didn't catch much.Huo Chi was different from other children when it came to catching loach. He didn't need a cage.He took out the small net bag he usually used for fishing, put the earthworms in the net bag to lure them, and spread the net bag in a place with less aquatic plants.In fact, he was skilled in picking out the loach's accommodation. Not long after the small net was put down, the net caught a good few loaches. What's more, they were all plump.\"Elder Brother Huo Chi, you are really amazing!\" Da Qiao adoringly looked at him with bright eyes.It was unknown whether Huo Chi's face was heated by the sun or because of embarrassment as two suspicious blushes appeared.Though he had a cool-guy expression on his face, the corners of his mouth were raised. He patiently instructed her: \"When catching loaches, you should pinch their heads with your fingers. That way, they won't slip away. Try it. \"\"Elder Brother Huo Chi, you know a lot. You are amazing!\"Da Qiao nodded her head. She imitated Elder Brother Huo Chi; holding the head of the loach with her thumb and forefinger. Sure enough, the loach couldn't run away.Da Qiao went all out in her rainbow-licking. The blush on Huo Chi's face became more and more obvious. The curvature of the mouth corners became more and more deep. He was clearly basking in it.Xiao Qiao came to look for Fang You Liang and Fang You Rou. When passing by, she saw Da Qiao and Huo Chi close together. The corner of her mouth couldn't help but raise a sarcastic arc.Really worthless. Staying with the wicked ones every day as if she wasn't afraid of being reported!If she wasn't going to Hu City, she would definitely go to the community to report Qiao Family!But who was this Huo Family? They didn't come to the production team in their last life.She pondered as she walked. Suddenly, she stopped, turned around, and her eyes fell on Huo Chi.She remembered that the richest man in her last life was surnamed Huo. She heard that his wife and child were once locked up on the farm as wicked ones. The family was reunited after the reform and the opening up.Could this Huo Chi be the son of the richest man?Huo Chi felt that someone was staring at him. He raised his head and encountered Xiao Qiao's eyes. His brows frowned and a chilly light flashed in his eyes.No matter how chilly his gaze was, he was still a child. So it wasn't any deterrent in Xiao Qiao's eyes.After thinking about it, she was still uncertain. She could only quickly find the two Fang Brothers and ask her mom when she got home.After Xiao Qiao left, Huo Chi looked at her back with disgust in his eyes.At this time, a child's cry suddenly came from the other side of the river: \"Someone come! Someone has fallen into the river!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85Everyone was stunned when they heard the call of help. Soon they recovered and ran towards the river.The adult trio ran very fast and overtook the children at once. When they arrived, they only saw a child's head bobbing up and down in the river. As if there was no more struggle.Everyone's heart went cold. They estimated that the child was probably beyond saving.Still, Qiao Zhen Min and Du Zhuo Cheng jumped in one after another and worked together to rescue the drowning child.The unlucky child who drowned was Fang You Rou. He had drowned once before. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be him this time.Last time, he was rescued early. Although he had a high fever in the end, he still managed to save his life. This time, he wasn't so lucky. When Qiao Zhen Min and Du Zhuo Cheng pulled him out, he had no breath.Although Qiao Zhen Min hated Fang Family, this was a life after all. He used the rustic method of saving people in the countryside; pressing his stomach and then ran back and forth with the person on his shoulder hanging upside down.Still, Fang You Rou never woke up.Wang Shui Sheng arrived. He reached out and probed the child's nose. His heart instantly became cold. The child was dead.At the side, Xiao Qiao was frightened. It was only after it happened, she recalled Fang You Rou had drowned in her last life.Because she didn't care about Fang Family, she didn't even think about it before. Forget about thinking of reminding Fang Family to avoid this misfortune.Of course, her mom, Fang Xiao Juan didn't remember either.Old woman Fang and Fang Fu Gui arrived one after another. When they saw a breathless Fang You Rou lying on the ground, they exploded.Old woman Fang did her same old act. She sat on the ground and opened her mouth to wail like in mourning: \"My poor You Rou! My little grandson! What happened to you? Quickly wake up... My God, I can't live...\"Fang Fu Gui's face was ashen. His eyes swept across Qiao Zhen Min and others. He viciously spewed out: \"Who pushed my son into the water? Say it! If not, I will kill you all!\"No one answered. The group of children turned pale with fright. Some of the children started to cry.Seeing saw that there was no answer, Fang Fu Gui bent down and picked up a stone from the ground. Glaring at everyone, he declared, \"Not answering, eh? Okay, then I'll kill you one by one and let you pay for my son's life!\"As soon as these words came out, the villagers immediately boiled over. Especially the families of the children. They kept their children behind them. If Fang Fu Gui dared to make trouble, they would fight him.Wang Shui Sheng glared at Fang Fu Gui and shouted, \"Put the stone down. If you dare to be impulsive, I'll arrest you and take you to the police station!\"Fang Fu Gui remembered the last time he was criticized. Fear and hate filled his heart. In the end, under the angry gaze of everyone, he threw the stone away: \"Who pushed my son into the water, you'd better confess!\"Old woman Fang wailed to the sky. Seeing no one answer, her eyes fell on Qiao Zhen Min and accused, \"It must be Qiao Family! Qiao Family has a grudge against our Fang Family. It was old Fifth Qiao who pushed my grandson!\"Qiao Zhen Min wiped the water from his face. He stood up and responded in a cold voice, \"So I save your son and end up with your hatred? Fine. Since you say I pushed your grandson, let's go to the police station now!\"Chu Sheng Mei angrily added: \"Old woman, you're so unreasonable. We ran over when we heard the call for help. If Fifth Brother Qiao and my fianc\u00e9 hadn't jumped down to save people, his body could have been gone! Fifth Brother Qiao, don't worry. If she dares to go to the police, I will testify for you!\"Qiao Zhen Min smiled gratefully at her.Old woman Fang was so frightened that she didn't dare to speak again.Wang Shui Sheng frowned and asked the children, \"What happened just now. Tell me the truth. If you don't tell the truth today, all of you will be taken to the community!\"The children look at each other. Then an older child stood up and told: \"We were fishing here at the time. Fang You Rou and his elder brother, Fang You Liang were at the other end. Not with us. Later, we heard someone yell. When we looked over, we saw Fang You Rou was struggling in the water and Fang You Liang ran that way.\"The other children nodded and echoed: \"Got nothing to dot with us. Fang You Rou was with his elder brother at the time. If you want to ask, ask Fang You Liang.\"When the villagers heard this, they couldn't help but start discussing.\"Could it be that Fang You Rou was pushed into the water by his elder brother?\"\"If this is the case, that child's heart is really dark. He can actually do that to his younger brother. This is the real white-eyed wolf!\"\"Now that you say this, I remember when Fang You Rou fell into the water last time, he was also with his elder brother. When something happened, Fang You Liang disappeared without a trace!\"When old woman Fang heard everyone's words, she was stunned at first. Once she regained her senses, she jumped three feet high: \"What do you mean? Do you want to say that my eldest grandson pushed his younger brother into the water? You're talking nonsense! Talk any more nonsense and I... I'll hang at your door!\"Everyone: \"...\"Alright, this trick was deadly enough!If she told everyone, she'll fight them to no end, no one would be afraid of her. But if she threatened to hang herself at the door of someone else's house, no one would want to provoke this crazy woman.Wang Shui Sheng spoke with a sullen face: \"What is the truth of the matter, we can only find out after talking to Fang You Liang!\"When old woman Fang heard this, her heart beat like a drum: \"This... is our family matter. We just need to figure it out by ourselves.\"Although Fang You Liang was a bit naughty in the past, he still had feelings for his own younger brother. After his mom died, his temperament changed greatly. He often beat Fang You Rou to tears. A few time, he almost strangled him to death.When old woman Fang thought of his past record, she already knew in her heart that it was mostly her eldest grandson who pushed her little grandson into the water.It was just that Fang Family only had this bloodline left. She can't let him meet with mishap no matter what!When everyone heard old woman Fang's response, they became more and more suspicious. However, they were afraid of old woman Fang going to their house to hang herself. They didn't dare to speak out.Wang Shui Sheng said: \"It's a matter of a human life. Not just a matter of your family affairs now. Carry him. I'll go find Fang You Liang with you and ask him directly!\"Old woman Fang wanted to resist, but a few cadres rounded up together and asked if they wanted to call the police immediately, or if they wanted to find Fang You Liang to get to the bottom of it. Fang Family had no choice but to pinch their noses and agree.Once Fang Family left, the crowd dispersed.Xiao Qiao glanced at Huo Chi before following Fang Family.Da Qiao caught this scene. She raised her head and pointed out the strange part: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, why do I feel like Younger Sister was looking at you?\"Huo Chi frowned and replied, \"Ugly people act up a lot. I don't know what bad things she plans to do!\"When Da Qiao heard this, her brows also wrinkled: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, then you have to be careful!\"Huo Family was responsible for raising pigs and planting Chinese herbs. These two things were very important to Huo Family and the production team. If something goes wrong, Huo Family will be severely punished and may even be sent back to the farm!She didn't want Elder Brother Huo Chi to be sent away.Seeing that she was worried about him, Huo Chi poked between her eyebrow with a finger and said, \"Don't frown. It will make you ugly!\"Da Qiao was surprised when she heard this, and quickly relaxed her eyebrows: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, since it's summer vacation now, I've called my elder cousins to join me the next few days and go to the private plot to inspect. This way, Younger Sister won't have the chance to do bad things!\"Huo Chi took in how she didn't forget about beauty even though she was worried about him and found it very amusing: \"En, but you don't have to worry. Them mother and daughter will soon leave the production team. If they are smart, they wouldn't cause trouble at this time.\"Da Qiao also felt it makes sense. But it was still necessary to guard against them....Back to Qiao's old house.Qin Xiao Mei and Dong Xue saw that Da Qiao came in with little Wan'er. Their eyes lit up at the same time.\"My sweetheart, come here to Godmother!\" Even though she had already met Da Qiao earlier, Qin Xiao Mei was still very excited.Da Qiao Jiao's delicate and soft look really pierced her heart. It made wish to hold her in her arms and rub her at the sight of her.Dong Xue's temperament was relatively reserved. However, seeing little Wan'er at this moment made her excited.She walked to little Wan'er. Due to being afraid of scaring her, she didn't stand too close: \"Wan Wan, do you remember Godmother?\"Little Wan'er was about to subconsciously hide next to her elder sister. At this moment, Chu Tian Bai came over and called her softly. She stopped and turned to look at him.Seeing her reaction to him, Chu Tian Bai was agitated and happy. He stretched out his hands towards her and coaxed, \"Wan Wan, how about coming to Godfather?\"Xiao Wan'er stared at him with black grape-like eyes. She didn't move for a long time. Just when everyone thought she wouldn't move, she tentatively walked over and put her arms around Chu Tian Bai's neck.Chu Tian Bai hugged little Wan'er tightly. His heart was extremely thrilled.Dong Xue's eyes were already red. She wiped her eyes with her hands and remarked, \"I was worried that this child won't remember us. Never thought...\"It was a pity that she doesn't want to let her hold her. It was understandable though. It was her man who rescued the child from the traffickers. Before Qiao Family found her, the child only trusted her man.Du Zhuo Cheng was about the same height as Qiao Zhen Min. So Qiao Zhen Min took him to his room to change clothes. He had took out a set of his clothes for him to change into.Qiao Zhen Min came out of the room after changing his clothes. He found the already changed Du Zhuo Cheng standing in the yard as he looked up at the blue sky in a daze.When he went over, he happened to hear the other person mutter to himself: \"Isn't death also a kind of relief. It takes courage to live.\"Qiao Zhen Min was stunned for a moment. But before he could speak, Du Zhuo Cheng saw him and jollily turned his head, \"Fifth Brother Qiao, thank you for your clothes. I'll wash them later and let my family send them over.\"Qiao Zhen Min waved his hand: \"No need. If you feel bad about it, just send it here. Don't let your family make a trip over here!\"Du Zhuo Cheng nodded: \"That also works.\"The two weren't familiar with each other. On top of Du Zhuo Cheng had a quiet personality and Qiao Zhen Min and him weren't people on the same path. The two only exchanged some polite words and went to the main room together.In order to thank Godfather and Godmother for entertaining her before, Da Qiao specially cooked a loach tofu soup by herself.The loach was caught just now. It was very fresh. She grabbed the loach's head, the knife went down, and the loach's head was chopped off with a \"dong\" sound. She hadn't bat an eyelash.An Ping got goosebumps when he watched this. Younger Sister Da Qiao appeared delicate and soft. How could she take action more fiercely than a man?He whispered to Shen Tian You, who was also squatting aside, \"Don't you find Younger Sister Da Qiao scary?\"With sparkling eyes, Shen Tian You watched Da Qiao chop the head of the loach with one cut after another: \"I don't. I think Elder Sister Da Qiao is amazing! If I hadn't already had Boss, I would definitely ask Elder Sister Da Qiao to be Boss! \"An Ping: \"...\"His second elder sister. Now Younger Sister Da Qiao. It can't be that this lad like \"violent\" women?After the loach got its head chopped off, Da Qiao squeezed the loach's internal organs out by pressing the loach's body. She cleaned it up, smashed some garlic, chopped ginger, and put the oil in the frying pan.After the oil pan was hot, the loach was add in and fried. Once it was golden on both sides, it was taken out. The garlic and ginger was added in before the loach was put back in again to fry it twice. In goes five bowls of water. Then the diced tofu was thrown into the pot. Soon, the soup in the pot turned milky white with a strong fish scent wafting up.She sprinkled the chopped shallots to the bottom of the large bowl and poured the fish soup over. The loach tofu soup was complete.When it was time to eat, Da Qiao's loach and tofu soup was unanimously approved by everyone. It wasn't because Xue Chuan's cooking skills weren't good, but because she was so young and her cooking skills were so good. It had surprised everyone.Qin Xiao Mei's mouth was full of flavorful food. Her eyes greedily looked at Da Qiao: \"This soup is so delicious. Da Qiao sweetheart, why are you so amazing?\"Da Qiao's went red from the praise. She revealed a sweet toothy smile: \"I learned it all from my grandfather. My grandfather is the truly awesome one. Still, I'm also quite amazing.\"Seeing that she didn't forget to praise herself at the end, everyone couldn't help laughing.Qin Xiao Mei hit by her cuteness and wished she could take her home. She felt even more regretful that such a sweet and lovely girl wasn't her own daughter?Chu Sheng Mei also liked Da Qiao very much. She leaned over and whispered to her fianc\u00e9, \"It would be great if I could have a child as cute as Da Qiao in the future.\"Du Zhuo Cheng looked at her and smiled softly: \"Only a cute mother can give birth to a cute child.\"Chu Sheng Mei's cheeks heated up when he praised her. Two red clouds appeared up immediately.When everyone saw it, they all tolerantly smiled.After lunch, Chu Family and Shen Family prepared to leave. Especially since Chu Family had to rush back to the county town today.Before leaving, Da Qiao put her homemade dried roses and jasmine flowers in orange cans. She gave five cans to each families.This time, both Chu Tian Bai and Dong Xue had to sigh. At such a young age, she was sensible, considerate, and capable. This was the little padded jacket that all parents want!Seeing Da Qiao and thinking about her own situation, Dong Xue couldn't help feeling sorry for herself. A child like Da Qiao was too rare. Even if she was given a little Wan'er, she would be satisfied.At a glance, Chu Tian Bai knew what his wife was thinking. When no one was paying attention, he reached out and grasped his wife's hand.Dong Xue looked up at her husband, feeling both comfort and discomfort in her heart....After Chu Family and Shen Family left, Qiao Family returned to calmness again. While Fang Family was very lively.Fang You Rou died.When Fang You Liang was found, he was sleeping on the straw pile. After being pushed awake and questioned about Fang You Rou by everyone, Fang You Liang wasn't panicked at all. He said he didn't know Fang You Rou had fallen into the water. When he left, Fang You Rou was still standing on the shore.Wang Shui Sheng asked him why he left Younger Brother and ran off. He acted as if it was natural. Explaining that he didn't like tails. He also said that he didn't hear Younger Brother's call for help. If he heard it, he would definitely go back to save him.When he said these words, he didn't feel guilty at all. His eyes didn't even blink. For a moment, the few cadres didn't know whether he was lying or not.It was just that after hearing that his younger brother died, he didn't look sad from the beginning to the end. His cold-blood was enough to make people feel chilled!Fang Xiao Juan was stunned when she heard the news of her little nephew's death by drowning. Like Xiao Qiao, she only remembered it after it happened.She grieved for a moment before quickly putting the matter behind her.Xiao Qiao told her mom about the richest man Huo. Then she asked her mom if she had any impression of the matter.After Fang Xiao Juan heard it, she patted her thigh and responded, \"Oh, you reminded me! How could I forget such an important thing?\"Xiao Qiao frowned and said, \"Mom, do you mean that the son of the richest man Huo's son is really that kid from the pigsty?\"Fang Xiao Juan curled her lips and sneered, \"Him? Haha, he wish. Unfortunately, he doesn't have that fate! It's not him. I remember richest man Huo's son is eleven years old this year. He is still on the farm!\"Xiao Qiao made sure: \"Mom, are you sure? It's really not that family in the pigsty?\"Fang Xiao Juan impatiently replied: \"Of course not! Back then, when richest man Huo came to pick up his son in his car, I happened to be visiting nearby. I went to watch. The boy was very handsome. Nothing like the one in the pigsty!\"When Xiao Qiao heard this, she finally felt at ease: \"Mom, since we know who richest man Huo's son is, we should treat him well while he is at his lowest point. He will be grateful to us when he is taken back by richest man Huo!\"Since richest man Huo's son looks good and he had such a powerful rich dad, she can consider marrying him in the future. This way, she will not have to worry about anything for the rest of her life!Fang Xiao Juan's eyes lit up. She nodded, \"You are right. But he is on the farm now. We need to find a way to encounter him. That way, we can easily send him things in the future!\"Xiao Qiao shook her head and commented, \"Mom, I don't think this can work. We have no relationship with him. What reason do we use to see him? Why don't we just send something to him and leave our names and addresses. Then wait for the other party to come over later. We'll say it was sent to the wrong person. Since the other party has received our benefits for so many years, he has to shoulder this gratitude!\"The smile on Fang Xiao Juan's face became even deeper: \"You considered it carefully. Okay, let's go with your method!\"The mother and daughter pair were looking forward to a bright future. They had dreams of getting rich that night. One dreamed that she was married to richest man Huo, and the other dreamed that she married richest man Huo's son.Wonder what expression they would have if they knew what each other's dreams were.In addition to Fang Family, tragedy also struck Chen Qiao Qiao.After Chen Qiao Qiao was fed abortion medicine by her eldest brother and second elder brother that day, she was in severe pain. What was even more tragic was that she was bleeding profusely. The blood flowed continuously. It would never stop no matter what.What chilled her was that she was about to die and her family hesitated whether to send her to the hospital. It was because going to the hospital meant they had to spend money, which they don't want.At that moment, she felt as if she had been pushed into the ice cellar in the cold winter. Blood frozen from head to toe.She regretted it. She shouldn't betray Qiao Zhen Min. If something happened to her at Qiao's house, Qiao Family would definitely not let her die.At that moment, she remembered Qiao Zhen Min's kindness to her. Her heart felt cut up by a knife.In the end, she rolled off the bed, knelt down, and begged her family. She promised that she would pay them back the money for going to the hospital. So they sent her to the hospital.At this time, she woke up in the hospital and felt a throbbing pain in her lower body and belly.She turned her head and looked around the room. No family in sight.In the next hospital bed was a woman about her age. It was unknown what her illness was. She was currently leaning against the pillow with a pale face. Her husband was feeding her soup. His movements were very gentle. From time to time, he wiped her mouth.Chen Qiao Qiao's eyes heat up from this sight. Her mind thought of Qiao Zhen Min again.Although she took the initiative to approach Qiao Zhen Min, Qiao Zhen Min was very responsible. Since he admitted that she was his match, he would bring her some small things every time he came back from a business trip.Sometimes it was some snacks. Sometimes it was a few headbands. Although it wasn't worth much, she was very happy when she received it at that time. It showed that he had put her in his heart.When did their relationship start to change?Oh, that's right. It started when she realized that little Wan'er was different from other children.Little Wan'er didn't respond to others. She can stay in the same place all day long. From birth to three years old, she had never seen her utter a sound except crying!They took her to the county town for an examination. The doctor said nothing wrong. The child was healthy. As for why this happened, the doctor said that the child may be born dull-witted.In other words, the child was born stupid and had no brains!She never liked stupid people. Before marrying Qiao Zhen Min, she imagined how smart their children would be in the future. Unexpectedly, she birth such an idiot. She was extremely disappointed at that time.At first, she didn't want to believe that her child would be stupider than others. She forced little Wan'er to learn. She taught her to speak, and taught her to write. If she didn't obey, she whipped her with a feather duster and made her howl. Still, the child was born to collect debts. No matter how she taught her, she was still as stupid as a pig.Of course, she whipped little Wan'er while Qiao Zhen Min wasn't at home. One time, Qiao Zhen Min came back a few days early and found a scar on little Wan'er. Although she muddled through it in the end, their relationship began to sour from that time.If there was no little Wan'er, her relationship with Qiao Zhen Min won't change. Nor would she be with Tian Jian Min. So all this was that idiot's fault in the end!The more Chen Qiao Qiao thought about it, the more hatred brew in her heart. If she knew earlier, she would have been killed as soon as she was born!At this time, her second sister-in-law came in with a food box. Seeing that she was awake, there was no delight on her face: \"Are you awake? Eat your meal now that you are awake. Hurry up, I have to go back to do housework!\"Chen Qiao Qiao already knew that her family was cold and cruel. But when she heard Second Sister-in-law's words, she couldn't help but feel depressed.She sat up and wanted to bring the food box over to eat. However, this action pulled the wound in her lower body. It made her gasp in pain. Her second sister-in-law act like she didn't see it. Just indifferently twiddle with her fingers.Chen Qiao Qiao tried several times, but it was so painful that she gave up: \"Second Sister-in-law, I want to ask you a favor.\"Second Sister-in-law Chen continued to pretend to be deaf.Chen Qiao Qiao gritted his teeth with hatred: \"As long as you help me go to Qiao's house to pass a message, I'll give you a yuan later!\"This time, Second Sister-in-law Chen finally listened. She raised her head: \"Do you really have money on you?\"Chen Qiao Qiao nodded: \"I brought back thirty yuan this time. As long as you help me, I will give you the money when I go back.\"Second Sister-in-law Chen wasn't afraid of her defaulting on her debts. She nodded and said, \"Okay, what do you want me to pass?\"Chen Qiao Qiao pursed her lips: \"Go to Qiao's house and say I'm going to die. Before I die, I want to see Qiao Zhen Min. Tell him to come over.\"Hearing this, Second Sister-in-law Chen's drooping eyes smilingly stared: \"Little sister, I didn't expect you to use this trick. Okay, I'll make a trip for you. Don't forget the money!\"Chen Qiao Qiao was embarrassed by her smile: \"I won't forget it.\"For the sake of money, Second Sister-in-law Chen went to Qiao's house that day.It was a pity that she didn't see Qiao Zhen Min. She didn't even enter Qiao's house. Instead, she was splashed with water by Qiao Xiu Zhi and was chased by Qiao Family's dog in the end.Later, Qiao Zhen Min found out that Chen Qiao Qiao was looking for him. He just sneered and threw it to the back of his mind.A month after she was discharged from the hospital, Chen Qiao Qiao was arranged by her family to marry a fifty-year-old man whose wife had died. The man was ugly and old. He looked older than her dad.More importantly, his son was older than her. She didn't want to marry. However, she was knocked out by her family and sent to the village.The village was very remote. She didn't even know the name and location of the village. The old man was afraid that she would run away, so he kept a dog to guard her.She had nowhere to turn for help. At this moment, she truly realized what she had done wrong.It was just there was no regret medicine in the world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86In mid-July, it was Lin Hui's mom, Wang Qiu Ying's birthday. Lin Family didn't hold a big banquet. Only prepared two tables of dishes and told her daughter to bring her children back to eat together.Early in the morning, Lin Hui asked Qiao Zhen Jun to carry the prepared fabric and twenty or so eggs. Then she lead Da Qiao and little Dong Lin to maternal home.Da Qiao supported her mom. Her eyes fell on the round and big belly and she couldn't help curiously asking, \"Mom, how long will it take for the brothers to come out?\"Little Dong Lin swung his short legs and followed closely. He parroted like a lackey: \"Yeah, when will they come out? The candies I've saved is going to melt!\"Because Da Qiao said that she would prepare gifts for her unborn brothers, the other children in the family readily followed suit and all got ready. The few little dumplings also joined in the fun.Little Yi Ming liked to draw very much. So he chose to draw. Little Dong Lin originally wanted to show his younger brothers a set of \"Kung Fu\", but was told that his younger brothers wouldn't understand. So he could only save the candies to give to his younger brothers.It was difficult for everyone to let him down again and couldn't tell him his younger brothers can't eat his candy.Lin Hui watched the two lively and lovely children. The corners of her mouth curled up: \"Soon. It's been more than seven months now. Younger siblings will come out in a month or so.\"Da Qiao raised her head and smiled sweetly: \"That's wonderful! Mom, I have prepared gifts for Younger Brothers. Just waiting for them to come out!\"\"Elder Sister Da Qiao, what gift did you prepare. Can you tell me?\" Little Dong Lin curiously asked.Da Qiao shook her head: \"No, it's a secret. You'll know when Younger Brothers come out.\"Little Dong Lin: He fell out of favor before Younger Brothers were born. What will he do in the future?Halfway there, they suddenly encountered Fang Xiao Juan.Fang Xiao Juan had been waiting for Meng Hong Guang's letter. It should have arrived last week, but the letter hadn't come. She was ill at ease; fearing that Meng Hong Guang will break up with her.Until yesterday, the letter still hadn't arrived. She couldn't wait any more. So she went to the post office in person. Unexpectedly, she really waited for its arrival. Meng Hong Guang's letter had just arrived and the postman hadn't deliver it yet. She collected the letter right there and then.Because she didn't recognize words, she was in a hurry to go back and get Xiao Qiao read the letter to her. To her surprise, she bumped into Qiao Zhen Jun's family.She saw how happy their family was. This scene stabbed her in the eye. But when she thought that she would soon be able to become an official's wife in the city, she snorted coldly and walked away from them with her chin up.Lin Hui and Qiao Zhen Jun looked at each other. The latter said, \"Let's go. Dad and Mom should be waiting for us.\"Lin Hui nodded. She didn't take this matter to heart.As soon as they entered Lin's house, Lin Hui's Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law immediately welcomed them in. Lin Family's children gathered around when they saw Da Qiao.\"Younger Sister Da Qiao, you are finally here. We are all waiting for you!\"\"Yeah, we have prepared a lot of delicious food for you. Come in and eat!\"\"Younger Sister Da Qiao is so beautiful. Skin is as white as tofu.\"\"I don't think tofu is as white and tender as Younger Sister Da Qiao!\"Everyone in the production team said that the feng shui of Lin Family was top-notch. Wang Qiu Ying gave birth to five sons in a row. Three of the five sons were married. And those three all gave birth to son. It made those who couldn't give birth to son green with envy.But from young to old of Lin Family, they all wanted a delicate and sweet girl more. So, as soon as Da Qiao came over, it immediately became a little fairy entering the monk temple. Lin Family's group of boys found it extremely rare.Little Dong Lin's red lips became a line and he shouted in a baby voice, \"Elder Cousin Brother, Second Cousin Brother, Third Cousin Brother, don't you like me?\"Lin Family's Eldest Cousin Brother turned around and pinched his little face: \"Of course I like you.\"Look how perfunctory this attitude was!Little Dong Lin pouted even deeper: \"You guys go away. This is my elder sister. Mine!\"Lin Family's mischievous boys poked his cheeks: \"You are right. Da Qiao is your elder sister, but she is also our younger sister!\"Little Dong Lin instantly became a little puffer fish.Lin Hui felt relieved when she saw Lin Family's kids liked Da Qiao very much.Eldest Sister-in-law supported her as she enviously remarked, \"Everyone says it's hard to be a stepmother. If there is a stepdaughter as delicate and cute as Da Qiao, I would also like to be a stepmother!\"When Second Sister-in-law Lin heard this, she laughed and said, \"Then Eldest Sister-in-law, hurry up and get a divorce with Eldest Brother!\"Everyone: \"...\"Some people may not have any malicious intentions themselves, but whenever they opened their mouth, they either offended people or immediately killed the conversation.Second Sister-in-law Lin was such a person.Fortunately, Eldest Sister-in-law Lin had long been accustomed to her character and didn't mind it.Lin Hui was at a pretty late stage of her pregnancy. On top of that, married out daughter was a guest when she returned to her maternal home. So this time, the few sister-in-laws didn't ask her to help. While Qiao Zhen Jun was dragged by the few brother-in-laws to chop wood.Wang Qiu Ying saw that the few daughter-in-laws were busy in the kitchen and hurriedly pulled her daughter into her own room. In order not to make people suspect anything, she didn't close the door and window. Just her action was very sneakily.She made sure that no one was outside before she crawled under the bed, ripped open a brick on the ground, and took out a wooden box from inside.Wang Qiu Ying's mouth was so tight that even Lin Hui didn't know that her mom hid such a wooden box under the bed: \"Mom, what are you hiding? It couldn't be gold?\"She was just joking, but when her mom opened the wooden box and took out the contents, she was stunned. It was really gold!It wasn't a gold bar or a gold ring. It was a round gold ball at the size of the little finger. It should have been hidden for many years.There weren't many golden balls. Only eight in total. If it was converted into money, it would be a lot of money.Lin Hui was shocked: \"Mom, where did you get these things?\"Wang Qiu Ying spoke: \"These are what your grandma left to me. Your grandma used to be the personal maid of an official's daughter. The two of them grew up together and had a good relationship. Later, when the world changed. The official family wanted to escape. Your grandma didn't want to follow, so the official's daughter gave some gold to your grandma. When I got married, your grandma split some gold with me.\"Lin Hui knew that Grandma used to be a maid. But it was the first time she heard about the gold: \"Mom, why haven't you exchange the gold after so many years?\"Wang Qiu Ying rolled her eyes at her daughter: \"What haven't? Otherwise, where do you think the things in this family come from? It's just Mom want to tell you that no matter how much a woman loves her husband and children, she should leave a way out for herself. With all this private fund, I have nothing to be of even if your dad want to divorce me!\"Lin Hui was amused by her mom's behavior: \"If my dad knew that you hid so much gold just to guard against him, he would probably be pissed off!\"Wang Qiu Ying slapped her daughter: \"Take it seriously. You married twice before, I was afraid that you did this out oof impulse. So I didn't give you the gold. Now it seems that Qiao Family treats you very well. I can rest assured to give the gold to you.\"Of course, it was impossible to give everything to Lin Hui. She had five sons and four-five grandchildren. Of course, she can't leave nothing behind. She took two small golden balls out to give her daughter.Lin Hui didn't want it. She pushed the little golden balls back and said, \"Mom, keep these things for yourself. I don't need them.\"She had been married twice. Her family had prepared a lot of dowry for her. As a person, she must know how to be grateful and contented. She can no longer take the things from the family. Otherwise, her few sister-in-laws will be displeased when they know about it.Wang Qiu Ying didn't allow her to refuse and stuff the little golden balls back to her: \"Take it! Zhen Jun's work has been messed up be another. You can take the gold and exchange it for money. Or directly gift it to someone and use connections. See if you can get the job back.\"It went without saying that she, the mother-in-law, was delighted and proud that her son-in-law was able to work as an employee in the town. Unexpectedly, he was driven back after only a few months. Recently, many people seen it as a joke in the production team.There were also some people who came to her deliberately took a jab. They all got retorted back by her one by one. Still, she couldn't swallow it.Of course, it wasn't all about fighting for this face. But if Son-in-law can become an employee, her daughter and unborn grandson will have security in the future. What's more, she only had this one daughter. It went without saying she hoped that her life will get better and better.Lin Hui held the little golden ball in her hand. Her eyes were a little sour. She hugged her mom and expressed, \"Mom, thank you. It's great to be your daughter!\"Wang Qiu Ying patted her daughter twice before gently pushing her away, \"Okay, don't be mushy. Quickly put the things away. Don't let your sister-in-laws see it.\"Lin Hui no longer hesitate. In the future, when the family situation improved, she would find opportunities to be filial to her mom.Lin Family's daughter-in-laws were diligent and swift people. Soon, they prepared two tables of good dishes. One for adults and one for children.Lin Family's daughter-in-laws' cooking skills can't compare with Xue Chuan's. Actually, it wasn't as delicious as Da Qiao's cooking. Still, Lin Family was full of sincerity. There were three meat dishes on each table. Everyone ate it with relish.Fang Xiao Juan took the letter and returned to the thatched hut. Seeing Xiao Qiao feeding the chickens, she quickly called her in: \"Come here and read this letter for me.\"As soon as Xiao Qiao heard her mom got the letter, she threw the things inside and wiped her hands clean before unfolding the letter.Fang Xiao Juan's heart was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot. Once Xiao Qiao opened the letter, she urged, \"What did it say? Did your Uncle Meng say anything about cut ties with that calamity?\"Xiao Qiao frowned and responded, \"Uncle Meng said, since your ties have cut off, then leave it. But... he made another request.\"\"What request?\"\"He want me to cut ties with Qiao Family.\" After Xiao Qiao said this, there was an indescribable discomfort in her heart.When Fang Xiao Juan heard this, she breathed a sigh of relief. She raised her eyes to watch Xiao Qiao's reaction. Raising her eyebrows, she said, \"Why? You don't want to?\"Xiao Qiao pursed her lips and replied, \"It's not a question of willingness or not. I don't think it's necessary.\"She didn't like Qiao Family very much. Qiao Family had said in front of her that they wanted her to sever the relationship, but as long as they didn't write a tie-severance letter, Qiao Family still had the obligation to support her.What happened to Wang Xin Sheng last time told her not to look at the beauty in front of her, but to leave a retreat for herself. So she didn't want to cut off her escape route, Qiao Family.If something unexpected happens in Hu City, or if Meng Hong Guang is proved to be unreliable afterwards, she can still go back to Qiao's house and get them to support herself. But once a tie-severance letter, this retreat will be gone.Therefore, she was reluctant in her heart. However, it wasn't easy to say it in front of her mom.\"Don't think I don't know what you're thinking! You don't want to cut off this backup road, Qiao Family! You treat Qiao Family as a backup road, but would Qiao Family treat you as their child? Do you think if something really happened, they will go all the way to Hu City for you? Don't daydream!\"Fang Xiao Juan pierced Xiao Qiao's daydreams with a sharp jab.She was worried that Meng Hong Guang would ask her to kidnap Da Qiao and so on. Now she heard that it was just cutting off the ties between Xiao Qiao and Qiao Family, there was no problem at all.Seeing that Xiao Qiao was unwilling at this time, she felt displeased at once.This child was really sneaky. While wanting to follow her to the city to enjoy happiness, she want to keep Qiao Family as a backup at the same time. She will reap all the benefits!Xiao Qiao pursed her lips and remained silent.Fang Xiao Juan could put down an ultimatum, \"If you don't want to cut ties with Qiao Family, then you can stay in the production team. I will go to Hu City alone!\"When Xiao Qiao heard this, she knew that she had no other choice: \"I know. Since this is the case, then I will cut off the relationship with Qiao family.\"No better day than today. Fang Xiao Juan was worried that Xiao Qiao would do something wrong, so she took her to Qiao's house on the spot.Halfway there, they happened to bump into Lin Hui's group who had returned from her maternal house.Lin Hui sighed her heart how 'enemies meet on narrow road'.Da Qiao glanced at her mom without saying a word. The group prepared to walk away as if they didn't see them.Unexpectedly, Fang Xiao Juan halted them: \"Qiao Zhen Jun, stop right there!\"Qiao Zhen Jun didn't turn around. He kept supporting Lin Hui forward.Fang Xiao Juan gritted her teeth angrily and loudly yelled, \"Are you deaf? I told you to stop. Didn't you hear? I want Xiao Qiao to cut ties with you and Qiao family!\"Qiao Zhen Jun stopped this time.Da Qiao was also shocked by her mom's words.She didn't understand what severing the relationship was before. After Elder Brother Huo Chi explained it to her in detail and gave her many examples, she understood.After understanding it, she felt a little depressed. Since her family treated her so well, she left this sorrow behind her.She didn't expect Younger Sister to cut ties with her family!Nearby villagers heard the commotion outside and immediately ran over to watch.Qiao Zhen Jun didn't look at Fang Xiao Juan. His eyes were on Xiao Qiao. He solemnly uttered: \"Xiao Qiao, you are smart since you young. I think you should understand what it means to cut off the relationship. Do you really want to cut off ties with Qiao Family?\"The last time his parents had warned Xiao Qiao in private. He only found out afterwards. He felt very helpless after knowing. But as long as he didn't really cut off the relationship, Xiao Qiao was still his child in his heart.Everyone was shocked and excited when they heard Qiao Zhen Jun's words.\"What? Are you going to cut off ties again? Last time it was Da Qiao. This time it Is Xiao Qiao. Tsk tsk tsk, your Qiao Family is really interesting!\"\"Ain't that right? Within these ten miles and eight towns, no one cuts off ties so frequently!\"\"I can't find a family with so many children divorced!\"In everyone's eyes, even though Qiao Family latched on high branch and the family was rich, they were still weirdo!A family of five children and three divorced. Old Second Qiao was even more bizarre. A pair of twin daughters, each cut off ties with their parents. Tsk tsk tsk, this gossip was enough for them to chew fr a long time!Xiao Qiao lowered her head and explained, \"Uncle Meng from Hu City said if I want to be his daughter, I must cut ties with Qiao Family.\"At this point, Xiao Qiao still wanted to leave a way out for herself as much as possible. She wanted everyone to know that she was forced to cut off the relationship.Sure enough, everyone heard her words and a discussion emerged. Majority expressed they could understand why Meng Hong Guang made such a request.\"It's understandable why Educated Youth Meng do this. No one wants to raise children for others!\"\"That's right. A lot of effort devoted in raising them up, only to be taken back in by Qiao Family when she grow up. Wouldn't it be a waste of effort?\"Some people curled their lips and sneered, \"Then you can not go to Hu City. Wouldn't it be better to stay at Qiao's house?\"Xiao Qiao looked up at her dad with teary eyes before lowering her head again. She appeared aggrieved and pitiful.Fang Xiao Juan snorted: \"You think she doesn't want to. Qiao Family doesn't welcome Xiao Qiao. Last time, they told Xiao Qiao straight up not to step into Qiao's house in the future. Do you think this is something a grandmother can do?\"\"Ah, did Xiu Zhi really say that?\" Everyone was shocked.Fang Xiao Juan harrumphed again: \"Would I lie to you? They clearly agreed before...\"Fang Xiao Juan wanted to make Qiao Family's promise to give meat and eggs three times a month, but later went back on their word known to everyone, but was stopped by Xiao Qiao.\"Mom, don't say it anymore!\" Xiao Qiao said with tears in her eyes, \"It's because I'm not as likeable as Elder Sister. It's my fault that Grandmother doesn't like me. Don't blame Grandmother.\"\"Oh, this child is so sensible and obedient. Seeing her like this makes my heart sour.\"\"Qiao Xiu Zhi used to blame Fang Xiao Juan for being biased. Isn't she biased too? She will give everything good to Da Qiao, while she is so strict with Xiao Qiao. She will regret it in the future!\"Qiao Zhen Min didn't want to listen to other people talking about his parents. He asked Xiao Qiao again, \"I'll ask you again, do you really want to cut ties with Qiao Family?\"\"Dad, you have Auntie Hui, Elder Sister, and other people by your side. But Mom only have me by her side. So I want to accompany Mom. I'm sorry Dad...\"As she said that, the tears that were in her eyes now rolled down at the same time as the last word fell.If this acting skills were in the modern times, she was truly as a proper actress award's contestant!\"In that case, let's go to the production team to write a tie-severance letter now.\" Qiao Zhen Jun sighed. Then he turned to Da Qiao and told, \"Accompany Mom home first.\"Da Qiao glanced at her biological mother and younger sister. She nodded and said softly, \"I see.\"Lin Hui swept a glance at Qiao Zhen Jun and whispered, \"The children and I are at home waiting for you to come back.\"When Qiao Zhenjun heard this, the depression in his heart dissipated a lot: \"I know. Quickly go back with the children.\"Fang Xiao Juan took in the sight of the two of them being lovey-dovey. Her body was full of discomfort. She said sharply: \"Go home if you want to be lovey-dovey. In front of so many people, you are shameless. I feel ashamed for you!\"The crowd laughed.Lin Hui's face flushed red.Qiao Zhen Jun raised his head and fiercely glared at her. Just now, he still felt a little pity for Xiao Qiao. Now it had completely dissipated.He strode toward the production team. Under the witness of the few cadres in the production team, they wrote four tie-severance letters to sever the father-daughter relationship like last time.Fang Xiao Juan took the tie-severance letter and left without looking back.This matter had once again become the topic during the production team's meal. Qiao Family's limelight was unparalleled for a while.Since old woman Fang's youngest grandson died, her mental state had deteriorated a lot. She wanted her daughter to take a grandson to Hu City before, but now she didn't want to.A few days later, Fang Xiao Juan took the letter of introduction issued by the community and Xiao Qiao. Under the envious eyes of everyone, she officially set foot on the road to Hu City.The villagers were very envious, especially those widows. They all fantasized that one day they can find a powerful man like Fang Xiao Juan to remarry.For Qiao Family, their ears became cleaner and their body became a lot relaxed as soon as Fang Xiao Juan's mother and daughter left....Less than five days after Fang Xiao Juan left, Tian Family and Qiu Family met with mishap.On the day of the mishap, Tian Jian Ming and Mother Tian were discussing Tian Jian Ming's marriage at Qiu's house. These days, it wasn't easy to buy the four major wedding gift. Most people can't even buy one of them.But for Qiu Xin Yong, this matter wasn't a matter at all. With a wave of his hand, he quickly bought it for his nephew.Mother Tian couldn't keep a lid on her delight: \"Jian Ming, you must thank your maternal uncle for your incident this time. In the future, you have to be filial to your maternal uncle, do you hear me?\"Tian Jian Ming smiling replied: \"Mom, I know without you saying. You might not like to hear this, but Maternal Uncle is more closer to me than you and Dad in my heart!\"When Qiu Xin Yong heard what his nephew said, he laughed with satisfaction.At this moment, there was a loud noise from outside. The door burst open. Sounds of panicked footsteps came in from outside.\"This... what happened?\" Tian Jian Ming's grandma was so frightened that she almost had a heart attack.Mother Tian hurried over and hugged her mother. She comforted: \"Mom, don't worry. With Second Younger Brother here, it will be taken care of!\"Qiu Xin Yong stood up with a dark face. He was about to go to see which b*stard dared to come to his house when he saw a group of people running in. Without saying a word, they stepped forward and grabbed him.The man who grabbed him was wearing a green suit uniform with a gun on his body. He was from the armed forces!Qiu Xin Yong's heart rapidly beated: \"You...what are you doing?\"Seeing these people, he knew something wasn't right.A man who looked like a military official walked in. Looking down at him, he spoke: \"Qiu Xin Yong, the municipal committee has received the report material about you. We had sent someone to investigate and prove that all the report material is true! Someone come. Search inside and outside of the house cleanly!\"The female relatives in the house screamed in fright. Tian Jian Ming's grandma fainted.When these people grabbed his maternal uncle, Tian Jian Ming quickly shrank to a corner. His heart beat like thunder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But this wishful thinking never came true.That military official soon noticed his presence and interrogatingly hollered, \"Who are you to Qiu Xin Yong? What's your name?\"Tian Jian Ming's legs trembled: \"My... my name is Tian Jian Ming. Not part of Qiu Family.\"Qiu Xin Yong raised his head and glanced at his nephew when he heard the end part.The military official laughed: \"So you are Tian Jian Ming. Perfect! Save us another trip. Come and arrest him for me!\"Two soldiers stepped forward and grabbed Tian Jian Ming's arms.Tian Jian Ming was like a weak skinny chicken. He didn't even dare to resist. Only weakly shouted, \"Did you arrest the wrong person? I'm not part of Qiu Family. My surname is Tian!\"The military official responded: \"You're the one we're arresting! Someone reported that you were messing around and caused the other party to commit suicide by jumping into the river. If it wasn't for your maternal uncle protecting you, you would have been arrested and paraded in the streets long ago!\"Tian Jian Ming's face instantly turned pale: \"I... I didn't. She got together with me voluntarily. I didn't force her from beginning to end!\"The military official looked at him like he was a fool; talking to him was a waste of his saliva.Tian Jian Ming panicked even more when he saw this. His heart kept sinking; sinking down to a-never-appearing bottom.Soldiers of the armed forces raided Qiu's house until it was upside down.If they didn't raided, they won't have known. Now that they did, they were shocked!Qiu Family actually had a basement, which hid a large amount of antique jewelry and gold, as well as countless other good things. In Qiu Xin Yong's mother's room, more than 10,000 cash was found!Currently the monthly salary of the employee in the town was 30 yuan. The cadres were 40 to 50 yuan. Even if one save all the money without drinking or eating, they have to save for more than 20 years!However, so much money can be casually raided out of Qiu's house. How could it not be shocking?Qiu Family's daughter and Mother Tian were so scared that their faces were bloodless. Huddled together, they trembled and cried. They could already imagine how miserable they would be in the days to come.In the end, Qiu Family and Tian Family were all arrested.The armed forces came to arrest people with guns. Many people witnessed this scene. So the news of Qiu's house being raided quickly spread throughout the town.Those who had been persecuted by Qiu Family and Tian Family before were so excited that they burst into tears. Immediately, they all gathered together and uniformly ran to the government to report Qiu and Tian Family's evil deeds.The wall fall when everyone pushed.The people who used to be friends with Qiu Family and Tian Family completely disappeared and lived with their tails between their legs. They feared that they would be implicated. However, most of these people weren't clean either. They either became redundant or had their homes raided.The turmoil lasted for half a month before it calmed down. The cadres in the town were washed and a lot of worms were replaced.Qiu Xin Yong was directly sentenced to death because of his numerous crimes. Tian Jian Ming was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Qiu Family and Tian Family were more or less involved. The serious ones were sentenced according to the specific circumstances. The less serious ones were all thrown to the farm for reform.After hearing that Qiu Xin Yong had been reported, county magistrate got his niece to break the engagement with Tian Family on the spot. Who would have thought that Lin Miao was a love-minded person. At this point, she was crying and begging her family to save Tian Jian Ming!This was dragging the whole family into the water to die together. How can Lin Family listen to her?Lin Miao was locked up. She cried a lot and threw tantrum. She even used hunger strike to force her family but it was to no avail. In desperation, she became seriously ill. After she recovered, she suddenly disappeared one morning.Lin Family was furious and worried. They had to find her though. After more than ten days, Lin Miao was found. She ran to the farm and said that she was Tian Family's daughter-in-law and wanted to share weal and woe with Tian Family!When the community director heard that there was a fish that slipped through the net and took the initiative to bring herself to the door, he imprisoned her on the farm without even thinking about it.After Lin Family found out, they announced that they cut ties with Lin Miao. Her life and death had nothing to do with Lin Family!When Qiao Family knew that Qiu and Tian Family had received their retribution, they celebrated with joy.Good news came one after another. The food factory manager sent someone to the production team to inform Qiao Zhen Jun that he could go back to the factory and continue to work. Once he works for half an year, he'll become a permanent employee.Qiao Zhen Jun can be considered to gain a blessing in disguise. Nowadays, the number of permanent employees in the food factory was limited. There was a hole for each radish. It was very difficult to get permanent job.Lin Hui's eyes were red with joy. She hurried back to her maternal home to tell her mom the good news. When Wang Qiu Ying found out, her chest puffed out. She immediately went out with a bowl to \"chat\" with others.Once the villagers knew that Qiao Zhen Jun got his job back and that he could become a permanent one, they were all envious.Qiao Zhen Min rushed back from the county before Qiu Xin Yong's gunshot execution and went to the prison to visit Tian Jian Ming.For Tian Jian Ming, these days were the most difficult days since he was born. He couldn't eat enough or sleep well. The place where he was detained was damp and smelly. There were bed bugs and fleas everywhere. He was bitten on the first day he entered. A rash was all over his body now.Putting these aside, the most painful part was that he was beaten by criminals in the prison every day. What's more, his 'innocence' had been endangered on the first day he came in.At this moment, he slowly moved in a strange gait. The prison guard impatiently pushed him: \"Hurry up!\"With this push, he staggered and almost fell to the ground. With this movement, there was a sharp pain in his chrysanthemum. This made his facial features twisted.F*ck, when were these days going to end?He really can't take it anymore!When Qiao Zhen Min saw Tian Jian Ming's haggard appearance, he was very relieved: \"God has eyes. Serve you right!\"Tian Jian Ming gave him pointed glare: \"I really underestimated your Qiao Family. We shouldn't have let you off back then!\"Qiao Zhen Min frigidly looked at him: \"Let go? When did you let our Qiao Family off? You just don't want the county magistrate to know about your evil deeds. That's why you haven't touched Qiao Family for the time being. Don't yourself appear so kind and compassionate!\"Tian Jian Ming's facial features contorted in fury. Then he suddenly raised his head and wildly laughed: \"So what if you bought us down? Your wife had been slept by me, no? By the way, she also said that you are not good there...\"BOOM!Blinded by fury, Qiao Zhen Min jumped up and punched him hard in the face!Tian Jian Ming's nose stung. Two lines of warm blood immediately flowed out of his nose. But before he could react, he eaten another punch and was pushed to the ground by Qiao Zhen Min. Fists fell on his face like raindrops.\"Save me! Murder! Prison guard!\" He was beaten to point of having no power to fight back and could only cry for help.However, the prison guard disappeared after sending him into this room. If he could go out at this time, he would see the prison guard standing on the other side; turning a blind eye to the cry for help inside.Qiao Zhen Min coldly stated, \"I advise you to save your energy. Even if you yell your throat hoarse, no one will come to save you!\"Before he came in, Shen Shi Kai had arranged everything for him long ago. As long as he didn't kill him, he can do as he like.Only then did Tian Jian Ming realize. Both hatred and unwillingness brewed in his heart. Still, he begged for mercy: \"Elder Brother Qiao, I was wrong. I really know I was wrong, but it was your wife who seduced me first... She said you wouldn't let her go to the county and blamed her for losing your daughter...\"No matter what he uttered, Qiao Zhen Ming's fists didn't hesitate at all. He beat Tian Jian Ming until his nose was blue and his face was swollen before letting him go.Not a part of Tian Jian Ming's body didn't ached. He thought it was over but heard Qiao Zhen Min coolly looked at him and spoke...\"You're a talented kid. Your maternal uncle is so good to you. And you can stab him his back. I wonder how Qiu Family will deal with you when they find out?\"In order to reduce the punishment for himself, Tian Jian Ming took the initiative to confess what Qiu Family had done. Some of these weren't in the report materials.If it weren't for him, Qiu Xin Yong's eldest son wouldn't have to be sentenced to death and the punishment for the other two sons wouldn't have been so severe. Although Qiu Family deserved it, Tian Jian Ming was truly a petty person.Hearing Qiao Zhen Min's words, Tian Jian Ming's heart thumped. His whole body uncontrollably trembled.He endured the pain and got up from the ground. Holding the other's legs, he begged for mercy: \"Elder Brother Qiao, please let me go. I really know I'm wrong!\"His two cousin brothers were in jail with him. If they knew what he had done, they would torment him to death!He still had to spend fifteen years in prison. For such a long time, he has to face two enemies. He couldn't stop shaking at the thought.Qiao Zhen Min kicked him away and his lips curled: \"It's too late to realize your wrongdoing.\"After saying that, he turned around and walked out. When he opened the door, Tian Jian Ming saw two people standing at the door. These two people were none other than the two cousin brothers from Qiu Family!Tian Jian Ming collapsed to the ground. With a roll of his eyes, he suddenly fainted....As Da Qiao picked wild vegetables in the East Forest, she muttered, \"If only I could catch a wild chicken.\"Tomorrow was Elder Huo Chi's birthday. In addition to the gifts that she had prepared a long time ago, she still wanted to make him something delicious. But she didn't want to trouble her family.As soon as her words fell, a wild child flapped its wings and ran out from the bushes. It happily clucked.When Da Qiao saw the wild chicken, her eyes instantly lit up. She was about to take a stone to knock it unconscious, when the pheasant ran to her, fell to the ground, and stopped moving.Da Qiao:\"\u2026\u2026\"What was going on?How can this wild chicken send itself to the door to die?Da Qiao blinked her big almond eyes. After thinking for a long time, she couldn't come up with a reason. She simply gave up then. Anyway, the ingredients were already in hand. Tomorrow she will be able to cook something delicious for Elder Brother Huo Chi!She tied up the wild chicken and hid it in a hidden bush to make sure no one would find it before she went home with the basket.The next day, she asked Mom to do a beautiful fishtail braid for her. Then she went out with a small basket.Little Dong Lin and little Yi Ming wanted to follow. But no matter how much they acted cute, Da Qiao didn't soften her heart.It wasn't that she didn't want to let her younger brothers go, but Elder Brother Huo Chi said that he wanted to spend his birthday alone with her. Though she wanted, she couldn't.Little Dong Lin and little Yi Ming watched their elder sister go away with tears in their eyes. Internally, they regarded Huo Chi as their top-tier enemy.Da Qiao and Huo Chi sneaked into West Wood and came to their usual spot, the waterfall.Because the other end of West Wood was still dense with fog and full of traps, the production team locked the entrance to this end with a bamboo door to prevent children from running in.But a small door wasn't much difficulty for Huo Chi.Da Qiao took out the items in the basket one by one. The first one taken out was a bag of crispy fried green beans.Qiao Family\u2019s private plot had been replaced by wolfberry trees. Now, they can only grow some vegetables that for their daily consumption in the yard. This batch of green beans was left over from the past. The beans were very full.After frying the green beans, she stir-fried them with chili peppers and other seasonings. It tasted spicy and crispy. When one take a bite, it crunches. Extremely crispy.\"Bring this back to Grandpa Huo and Auntie Fang to eat. This is a great snack. It's a new recipe that I recently came up with!\"While stuffing the bag over, Da Qiao introduced it to him. She didn't forget to praise herself.The corners of Huo Chi's mouth curled up. He was already used to her vain habit of boasting about herself. If one day she didn't praise herself, he mightn't be used to it!Da Qiao continued to take out things. In addition to some food, there was also a small purse. It was embroidered with a boy and a girl. The two were roasting chicken and eating.Huo Chi held the purse and touched the embroidery on it with his hand. His heart felt warmth: \"Your gift... I like it very much.\"Da Qiao smiled and responded, \"It great that Elder Brother Huo Chi likes it. Last time you were angry with me for this. I was sad for a while. You're not angry anymore?\"Before, she wanted to make some purses for her godmother and her family. Since the quantity was too large and she wasn't skilled enough in embroidery, she didn't prepare his share.But after Elder Brother Huo Chi accidentally found that she hadn't prepared for him, he turned around and left on the spot. Then he deliberately avoided her for two or three continuous days. Although he took the initiative to reconcile with her later, she knew he was angry that she didn't make a purse for him.Huo Chi's face turned red with a \"swoosh\". He forcefully defended himself: \"I'm not mad at you. You misunderstood.\"Da Qiao looked at him with her big eyes: \"No? But last time you obviously ignored me for a good few days...\"Huo Chi's ears turned red now: \"It's all in the past. Don't talk about it. I'll clean up the wild chicken.\"After he finished speaking, he quickly stood up, grabbed the chicken on the ground, and bolted as if he was running away.When Da Qiao saw Elder Brother Huo Chi's reaction, she was very puzzled. After thinking about it for a while, she dropped it and went to pick up dead branches to make a fire.Huo Chi ran to the edge of the waterfall. His face was still hot.He wasn't actually angry with Da Qiao last time. When he heard that she made purses for everyone and not him, he felt depressed.He dumped the wild chicken on the ground. After washing his hands, he took out his purse to look at it again. The corners of his mouth hooked up.He really liked this gift and will definitely treasure it!After staring it for a while, he carefully put the purse into his pocket and started killing the chicken.Once the chicken was all sorted, Da Qiao had successfully started the fire.Da Qiao accepted the wild chicken from Elder Brother Huo Chi. She smeared a layer of lard and salt on the chicken and then stuffed the ginger, chives, minced garlic, peppercorns, carrot pieces, and potato pieces prepared in the morning into the wild chicken's stomach.After marinating for half an hour, it was inserted on a stick and roasted over the fire.As soon as the roast chicken was put on the fire, there was a crackling sound. After a while, a taste fragrance wafted up. The two almost drooled.Half an hour later, the roasted chicken was cooked. The skin was crispy, while the flesh was tender and spicy. Although the meat was a little bit tougher than the domesticated chickens, it didn't affect its deliciousness at all!Huo Chi tore off a big drumstick and handed it to Da Qiao: \"Your favorite drumsticks. Both are for you.\"Da Qiao accpeted it over. Her eyes curved in delight: \"One is enough for me. Elder Brother Huo Chi, you eat the other. By the way, my grandfather said that there must be a beginning and an end in doing things. Today is Elder Brother Huo Chi's birthday. This chicken head and chicken butt is Elder Brother Huo Chi's too.\"Huo Chi: \"...\"Qiao Nian Nian, are you serious?Huo Chi's mouth twitched as he stared at her. The other party blinked at him with bright and clean eyes with three words written in the bottom of her eyes: I am serious.In the end, Huo Chi didn't eat the chicken head and chicken butt. He used an excuse of wanting to share the chicken. The chicken head and chicken butt ended up in Pi Pi's stomach....The office of Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang in the army.Wang Yan Sheng knocked on the door and walked in. He gave a military salute.Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang waved his hand and spoke, \"There's no one else here. Don't be so stiff. There's already news from Qiu Xin Yong's side.\"Saying that, he threw a document in front of him.Wang Yan Sheng picked up the documents and skimmed through it. When he saw that Qiu and Tian Family had been raided, he couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.These two families had been eliminated. Qiao Family will not have to worry about being schemed against in the future.He put the document in and responded, \"I must thank you, Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang. If it weren't for you, this matter would definitely not be resolved!\"Lieutenant General Jiang picked up the enamel tank and took a sip of water: \"Don't be in a rush to say thank you. I only gave a third of my strength to this matter. Besides us, there were also people in Baocheng's side who started to attack Qiu Xin Yong. It was the work of few forces that pulled that guy down!\"Wang Yan Sheng immediately thought of Qiao Family's god-relatives, Shen Family.Shen Family was very kind. Ordinary people couldn't wait to hide when they encounter such a thing. How could they possibly help? What's more, they and Qiao Family were just god-relatives.Just when he was pondering, he heard Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang continue: \"Our side can act so quickly, thanks to Commander-in-chief Liang's help. If it wasn't for him, this matter would definitely not have been solved so quickly!\"Hearing Commander-in-chief Liang being mentioned, Wang Yan Sheng was stunned.A youthful and lively figure immediately appeared in his mind. His brows immediately wrinkled.When Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang saw his reaction, he knew that he had guessed the underlying important factor: \"I don't have any connections that side. So I mentioned it to Commander-in-chief Liang. He was originally unwilling to help. At that time, Comrade Dong happened to hear our discussion. She pleaded Commander-in-chief Liang to help us. You have to thank Comrade Dong.\"Wang Yan Sheng's brows furrowed even tighter. He was silent for a while before uttering, \"I understand!\"Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang put the enamel tank aside and said, \"Comrade Dong is a good comrade. Commander-in-chief Liang's side also have intention to match you two. It's just you are already engaged. So you have to handle it well and mustn't make mistakes, understand?\"Wang Yan Sheng gave a military salute again: \"I understand!\"After coming out of\u00a0Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang's office, Wang Yan Sheng contemplated how to return this favor and how to make the other party give up.Unexpectedly, he saw Dong Li Li halfway on the road.The other party was wearing a blue dress with two braids. She was standing downstairs waiting for him.He took a deep breath and walked over: \"Comrade Dong, are you waiting for me?\"Dong Li Li's cheeks turned red with a 'thump'. She bit her lip and nodded, \"Yes, I'm waiting for you, Colonel\u00a0Leader Wang.\"Dong Li Li was pretty; melon face with big eyes, slender figure, beautiful and fashionable dress, plus a lively and cheerful air. Many men like her.But in Wang Yan Sheng's eyes, she had become a hot potato now.He was silent for a while. He decided to cut the mess with a quick knife: \"Comrade Dong, Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang has already told me Commander-in-chief Liang's help. On behalf of myself and my fianc\u00e9e's family, I thank you!\"Seeing that he took the initiative to come to find her, Dong Li Li felt like she was wrapped in honey. Who knew that he would mention his fianc\u00e9e as soon as he opened his mouth.Her heart immediately sank. The blush on her face dissipated: \"Colonel\u00a0Wang... Do you like your fianc\u00e9e very much?\"Wang Yan Sheng nodded without hesitation: \"Yes, I like her dearly. I have been thinking of marrying her since I was fifteen. But at that time I had no ability and my family was very poor. So for her, I joined the army and became a soldier. I made a mistake though. I didn't let her know my heart. That's why, she got married in my third year in the army!\"Dong Li Li gasped. Her eyes widened: \"You mean... your fianc\u00e9e is divorced?\"Wang Yan Sheng nodded again: \"Not only is she divorced, she also has a child. I don't care. As long as I can marry her, I will be satisfied!\"It felt terrible to hear someone you like talk about their love for another woman!Dong Li Li grabbed the corner of her clothes. Her eyes were a little red: \"Why? Is it because I appear later than her? Which part of me can't compare to her?\"Wang Yan Sheng responded: \"I have known her since I was eleven years old. When I was about to starve to death, her appearance saved me. So in my heart, no one can surpass her! You are wonderful. A decent girl. In the future, you will definitely meet someone who cherishes you.\"At this point, how could Dong Li Li not understand?Her eyes and nose were sour to the point of extreme discomfort. She choked: \"I see.\"After speaking, she turned and ran away.Wang Yan Sheng watched her back. He remained silent for a moment before turning and walked upstairs.Dong Lili sobbingly ran back to her dormitory. Because she had a single-person dorm, she could cry as much as she wanted.Once she was tired of crying, she fell asleep on the bed and had a dream.In the dream, she still liked Wang Yan Sheng very much. For his sake, she refused the family's arrangement. Since he wouldn't marry, she didn't marry either. Finally, when Wang Yan Sheng was thirty-three years old, she married him.It was just that the married life wasn't as good as she imagined. No matter how hard she tried, Wang Yan Sheng was always lukewarm. Later, she realized that he had a woman hidden in his heart. Even though that woman was dead, he still couldn't forget it.She collapsed at the time. How could she compare to a dead woman?Her family persuaded her not to care. Still, she just couldn't let it go. So in the days to come, she kept arguing with him. The house was in chaos. Daughter was often frightened into tears. She didn't care though. She was only focused on forcing him to forget that woman.They tortured each other like this for ten years. In the end, she couldn't take it anymore. After divorcing him, she abandoned her daughter and went to abroad alone.After going abroad, she lived a life of indulgence and depravity. She met a foreigner. Under his influence, she touched things that she shouldn't touch. She end up dying in a foreign country.She hadn't reached forty years old when she died.When she woke up from her dream, Dong Li Li found herself in a cold sweat.She remembered the scene in the dream. It felt so real like she had truly experienced it.She felt aggrieved for the her in the dream. At the same time felt that she was too unpromising in the dream. For a man, she actually made herself like that!She didn't want to end up like the dream. She stood up and washed her face. Seeing her red and swollen eyes in the mirror, she decided to give Wang Yan Sheng up today....Buying a bicycle required fifty industrial coupons. With the joint efforts of Shen Family, Chu Family, and Qiao Zhen Min, the fifty industrial coupons were quickly gathered.On August 1st, Qiao Family bought a Phoenix bicycle back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The bicycle was big and heavy. It was indeed not something that children such as Da Qiao can control.The management of bicycles was very strict these days. After buying a bicycle, one must register with the vehicle management office of the traffic department. The vehicle management office would issue a \"Bicycle License\" certificate to the owner.One must always bring their ID with them when they go out and around. If they weren't able to take it out when during checkpoint inspection, they were likely to be treated as a bike thief.When Qiao Zhen Min rode his bicycle back to the production team, the entire production team exploded!Although Shen Family had come by in a car before, Shen Family was too far away for them. They'll just admire in passing since they won't see or touch it. Nothing to do with their life.While Qiao Family's bicycle was the first bicycle in the production team. The production team leader didn't have one yet!Qiao Family was too awesome. This was a benefit for everyone. With a bicycle in the production team, they can borrow it from Qiao Family for emergency purpose.Therefore, at this time, everyone made up their minds that they must become good friends with Qiao Family in the future. Even if they can't become good friends, they can't offend them for the sake of borrowing bicycles!\"Old Fifth Qiao, you really bought this bicycle? This bicycle must have cost a lot of money, right?\"Everyone eyed the bicycle with envy. They wanted to reach out to touch it, but were afraid that the bicycle would be damaged.Qiao Zhen Min calmly replied, \"It's just over one hundred yuan.\"Just!Look at his tone, it made one's teeth itch. Qiao Family was really different!\"Oh, not to mention how expensive this bicycle is, it's not easy to save so many industrial coupons. Old Fifth Qiao, do your family have any extra industrial coupons? If there are, I'll use other coupons to exchange with you!\"\"I'll exchange too. I'll exchange with you with cloth coupons. Food coupons too. It's up to you to choose!\"These days, the most rare thing was the industrial coupon. One may not be able to get one even if they beg everywhere.A few years ago, the country wanted to make steel. The pots of every household were requisitioned. Some people haven't been able to buy a pot at home. To buy a large iron pot, they need industrial coupons. Without industrial coupons, money was useless.Old Fifth Qiao shook his head and told, \"There is no more for now. If there is any in the future, I will inform you again.\"The villagers' words made him realize that this might be a good way to make money.He can collect the food coupons in the hands of the villagers and go out to exchange industrial coupons with others. He can draw some benefits in the middle.Of course, he certainly can't tell them this now. He can't give them a definite answer either. If things come too easily, the other party won't cherish them.When everyone heard what he said, they made up their minds more and more to be on good terms with Qiao Family. They were incapable of getting industrial tickets these days.Qiao Zhen Min rode the bicycle home. Qiao Family's children were very excited when they saw the bicycle!\"Fifth Uncle, is this our family's bicycle?\" An Ping was the first to run up. His eyes sparkled as he looked at the bicycle like it was a gem.Qiao Zhen Min nodded: \"Yes, this bicycle will be ours from now on.\"An Ping jumped three feet high: \"Great, we have a bicycle! Fifth Uncle, can you teach me how to ride a bicycle?\"\"No!\" Qiao Dong Ying came over and stated, \"From elderly to young in an orderly manner. Must line up according to age. When Eldest Sister and I finish learning, it will be your turn!\"An Ping immediately slumped. There were so many elder before Eldest Sister. When will it be his turn?Why wasn't he older?Da Qiao was also very curious about the bicycle. She peered around and touched around: \"Fifth Uncle, doesn't this bicycle have to be tied with plastic film?\"She had seen a lot of cyclists in town before. Almost all the handlebars and cross tubes of the bicycles were tied with plastic film. Her grandmother told her that it was to prevent the paint from wearing off the bicycles.Qiao Zhen Min rubbed her head and smiled, \"I want to tie it up. Do you want to help Fifth Uncle tie it up?\"\"Yes!\" Da Qiao eagerly responded.Surrounded by a group of children, Qiao Zhen Min pushed the bicycle in. Everyone wrapped the bicycle around with plastic film.After winding it up, a brand-new bicycle instantly became colorful and a little unsightly.But no one disliked it. Bicycles were so precious. Naturally, they must be well protected!Seeing the bicycle, Wan Chun Ju was so excited that her face twitched. Seeing that Da Qiao wanted to touch the bicycle, she couldn't help but reprimanded her twice. She completely regarded the bicycle as the property of first branch.If it wasn't for fear of her mother-in-law scolding her, she would have moved the bicycle to her room to hide it!When it was time to sleep that night, she kept urging her man to quickly learn to ride a bike, so that he could drive her around the production team and show off fake wealth.This time, Qiao Zhen Guo didn't refuse. Mainly, he wanted to ride a bicycle. He planned to learn from tomorrow.It was a pity that the two's wishes soon went down the drain. The next day, Xue Chuan occupied the bicycle.Xue Chuan deliberately took leave with the production team to take his wife to town for a day of fun. Today was the 35th anniversary of their marriage.After Qiao Zhen Guo and the other children found out, they all wanted to celebrate with their parents. However, they got rejected.Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan expressed that they didn't want to bring along a group of light bulbs. Only Da Qiao was brought along. But once they got to town, they'll drop Da Qiao at Shen's house before experiencing couple time.Xue Chuan hopped on the bicycle with his long legs, picked up Da Qiao and placed her on the horizontal bar in front. Then he turned his head and smilingly beckoned his wife, \"Come on. I'll take you two.\"During this period, Xue Chuan's body had been getting better and better. He hadn't been sick once in the past six months. Qiao Xiu Zhi wasn't worried that he would not be able to carry them. She sat on the back frame.Xue Chuan pushed his feet and swiftly carried the two away.The people who were left behind: \"...\"When they arrived at town, they first brought Da Qiao to Shen's house. Shen Family welcomed Da Qiao's arrival. Especially Shen Tian You, who happily circled the room.After greeting, they rode their bicycle away.Xue Chuan didn't cycle to the state-run restaurant or the department store. Instead, he turned into an alley and finally stopped in front of a small courtyard.The small courtyard wasn't only remote, but also separated from the surrounding houses by a certain distance. Which looked very suitable for do bad things.There was no surprise on Qiao Xiu Zhi's face though. She was obviously no stranger to this place.Xue Chuan stepped forward and knocked on the door. A rough man's voice sounded from inside: \"Who is it?\"\"It's me, old Xue.\" Xue Chuan replied.The footsteps inside were a little hurried. With a \"squeak\", the wooden door was opened. A man in his fifties or sixties appeared behind the door with a simple smile on his face: \"You guys are a little early today!\"The man's name was old Xu. His grandfather used to be the housekeeper of Xue Family. Later, Xue Family took the initiative to give them back their slave contract. On top of that, they gave them a sum of money to make a living.Xu Family went out to open a restaurant. The business was quite prosperous and they saved a small fortune. Later, when Xue Family went in decline, Xu Family helped a lot behind the scenes. Over the years, the two families have kept in touch.Private business wasn't allowed now. Xu Family had long ceased to open a restaurant. Still, those things in the kitchen were still well kept.Xue Chuan familiarly walked into the kitchen. Various ingredients were already prepared in the kitchen. He rolled up his sleeves and cooked a good feast for his wife.Braised pork, Mapo tofu, old hen stew, steamed fish, and two bowls of handmade noodles. Full of color and aroma. The fragrance filled the whole yard.Fortunately, no one lived nearby. Otherwise, if they smell the meat, it will attract the attention of the neighbors.Old Xu went out after they came in. He wisely left the space for them husband and wife.After being seated, Xue Chuan scooped a bowl of soup for Qiao Xiu Zhi and merrily introduced, \"This soup has been simmered for several hours. It's very tasty. Try it.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi picked up the bowl and took a sip. It was perfect and salty. The dishes on the table were all her favorites.Xue Chuan saw that she had finished drinking and clipped some meat for her, \"You have worked hard all these years.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi stared at her husband's still handsome face, and smiled: \"With you, it's not hard work.\"Any more mushier, they wouldn't say it. The two stared at each other. Only the other person existed in their eyes.Over the years, they have gone through ups and downs together. In the days to come, they will continue to move forward hand in hand. If there s an afterlife, they will still be husband and wife.When the food was almost finished, Xue Chuan put down his chopsticks and stated, \"I have something to tell you.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi also put down her chopsticks: \"What's the matter? Is it serious?\"Xue Chuan said: \"We always felt that Hong Mei isn't like our child. After that, I asked old Xu to help me to investigate. Because it's been many years, many people couldn't be found. Recently, there was an elderly who used to be a nurse in the hospital. She took the initiative to find him. According to the old nurse, she was called out before she helped the baby bathe. When she came back, she found that the baby had suddenly changed. She was shocked. After searching around once, she didn't find others. Due to being worried that she would be fired from the hospital after she voicing it out, she pretended that nothing happened. Recently she found that she was dying, so she asked her nephew to come to old Xu.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi grasped the edge of the table and said solemnly, \"So, Hong Mei isn't our child anymore?\"Xue Chuan nodded: \"The child should have been swapped at that time. I don't know who did it, let alone why the other party did it!\"When Qiao Xiu Zhi had a dystocia, she was rushed to the town hospital. The situation was very critical at the time. After giving birth, she was bleeding profusely.Because both side's parents had passed away long ago, there were no other elders in the family to help. He entrusted the baby to the nurse who delivered the baby and asked her to help take care of his daughter.Unexpectedly, such a thing to happen in the middle. He felt very guilty at of his missing daughter and how her life or death was unknown!Qiao Xiu Zhi was also very depressed when she thought of the daughter she had never met.Xue Chuan reached out and held her hand. His voice choked up a bit: \"I'm sorry. It's all my fault!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi shook her head: \"How is your fault? With my situation back then, it's understandable that you didn't pay heed to the child. Did the old nurse provide any other clues? As for the hospital, were there have any birth records back then? \"Xue Chuan shook his head and nodded again: \"All the records in the hospital were burnt down a few years ago, so the data is gone. The old nurse did say our daughter has a peach-shaped birthmark on the back. About half your palm big. If we can meet, we should be able to recognize her easily.\"When Qiao Xiu Zhi heard this, she couldn't help but sneer.The sea of people was vast. Where do they start?What's more, the birthmark was on the back. How can they see it when everyone was wearing clothes?In other words, even if their daughter walked past them, they might not recognize her!\"Where's the old nurse?\" Qiao Xiu Zhi solemnly asked.If the other party had informed them of the matter at the time, they would have gone to the police on the spot. They might have been able to find their daughter. But it was because of the other party's concealment and selfishness that they had been separated for so many years!She really had the heart to kill her!Xue Chuan replied with an heavy heart: \"She is terminally ill. She probably don't have much time left. I want to get her tell the truth while she is still alive. Then we will cut off our relationship with Hong Mei.\"The old nurse did a bad thing and was condemned by her conscience all her life. Both of her sons died of illness one after another without leaving any descendants. She felt that this was God's punishment for her. When she found out that she couldn't last longer, she wanted to tell the truth of the matter.Xue Chuan hated the other party's selfishness. But with her current state, they can't do anything.Qiao Xiu Zhi thought of all the disgusting things that Hong Mei had done in the past, she nodded without hesitation: \"Okay. This should be done sooner rather than later least that the old nurse stopped breathing and caused trouble again.\"Ever since Hong Mei and Chen Family found out that they had a relationship with Shen Family, the couple often came to the production team. And they separate on bad terms every time.According to Shen Family, the couple specially went to Shen's house a few times to find them, only to be kicked out by them.Hong Mei firmly believed it was them who didn't want them to live well. The last time, they yelled and scolded at the door of Qiao's house before leaving. Almost the entire production team came to watch.She used to think that Hong Mei was their biological daughter, so she could only swallow it down even when she was disgusted. Now that she knew that she wasn't their daughter, she didn't want to endure it for a moment!Xue Chuan grasped her hand and stated, \"Let's go to the police station to find Shi Kai now!\"It was best that the police got involved in this matter. This way, Hong Mei and Chen Family can't even take the opportunity to act up!...The two said goodbye to old Xu and went to the police station.Shen Shi Kai was stunned when he saw the couple coming over.When he knew what happened, he fiercely slammed his fist on the table: \"It's not an exaggeration to say the mistake that the old nurse made is enough to lock her up for ten or eight years. If you want to, wait for the matter to be settled and she can be imprisoned on the spot!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi thought for a while before shaking her head, \"Forget it. Let's take it as gaining good merit for our daughter. Besides, with her condition, she probably won't be locked up for more than a few days.\"From what Xue Chuan said, the other party was too sick to get out of bed. Even if she was put in prison, it would be useless. Their daughter still couldn't be found. Once the other party is in prison, she might no longer blame herself.This would let her off too lightly.Selfish people like this should live in guilt and self-blame all their lives!Shen Shi Kai expressed his understanding, picked up the key, and drove them to the old nurse.Under his witness, he recorded everything the old nurse said, asked her to sign, and put her fingerprints. Then he took the old nurse to Chen's house.As soon as she walked into the family compound, Hong Mei could be heard scolding her daughter: \"You trash! I ask you to do some work and you can't do it well, I'll beat you to death!\"\"Mom, I was wrong. Don't hit me... ah...\" Chen Zhao Di's cry came from the room. There was the sound of a cane hitting on her body.Qiao Xiu Zhi frowned. Disdain for this fake deepen more and more in her heart.\"Qiao Hong Mei!\" Shen Shi Kai shouted at the door of Chen's house.When Qiao Hong Mei heard someone call her, she was startled. The cane almost whacked her in the eye.Fuming, she came out. As she walked out, she berated, \"Who's yelling at my door? Trying to scare people to death?\"When she came out and saw Shen Shi Kai's face, her anger suddenly turned into a smile: \"Oh, Deputy Chief, why are you free to come here?\"She threw the cane aside and rushed out; completely ignoring her parents who were standing at the side.Mother Chen heard a man calling her daughter-in-law's name. She thought her daughter-in-law was cuckolding her son and was about to come out and beat and scold her. Then she heard her daughter-in-law call the other party 'deputy chief'. Her face instantly bloomed like a flower.\"Hong Mei, why are you still standing there? Hurry up and ask Deputy Chief to come in and sit!\"Mother Chen's voice boomed. She wished for everyone in the yard to know that the deputy chief came to their Chen's house.Sure enough, after hearing Mother Chen's words, many people ran out from inside.\"Mother Chen Xing, is this your relative?\"Mother Chen raised her chin like a proud old hen with her head held high: \"This is the deputy chief from the police station. Also, a relative of our Hong Mei's maternal family. In a way, a relative of our Chen Family!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan took in the virtues of this pair of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. They felt like they were fed a mouthful of flies. Simply disgusting!Fortunately, after today, they were no longer related!Shen Shi Kai avoided Qiao Hong Mei's outstretched hand and declared with a straight face, \"I'm not a relative of your Chen Family. Stop talking nonsense here!\"Mother Chen and Qiao Hong Mei blushed with embarrassment. The surrounding people burst into laughter.Shen Shi Kai didn't give them a chance to speak. He pointed at Qiao Hong Mei and continued, \"I'm here today because of your identity!\"Then, he told in front of everyone that the old nurse discovered that the babies had been swapped, but concealed the matter.After listening, Qiao Hong Mei's face was as white as a ghost: \"No, it's impossible. Deputy Chief, you... must be joking with me?\"Shen Shi Kai said coldly, \"Who has time to joke with you? It's all true!\"Saying that, he asked the old nurse who was being carried by her nephew to testify and showed the recorded statement to everyone.Finally, he pointed to Qiao Hong Mei and Xue Chuan and asked everyone, \"The eyes of the masses are the sharpest. Do you think Qiao Hong Mei and the two elders of Qiao Family look alike?\"Everyone shook their heads: \"Not alike!\"Only then did people know that Xue Chuan and Qiao Xiu Zhi were Qiao Hong Mei's 'parents': \"Oh, it turns out that these two are Hong Mei's parents. Hong Mei didn't acknowledge them from beginning to end just now. I thought they were strangers!\"\"That's right. I thought Hong Mei didn't know them just now. Never thought they were Hong Mei's parents! However, Hong Mei really doesn't look like the two of them. I couldn't find any resemblance anywhere!\"When Qiao Hong Mei heard everyone's words, she panicked.She had deliberately ignored her parents just now. She held a grudge toward them for making her lose face a few times before. That's why, she deliberately embarrassed them.It was just that she never imagined that things would turn out like this!She did hate Qiao Family and hated her parents' biased even more. But she can't cut off the relationship with Qiao Family. Her man still want to latch onto Shen Family through Qiao Family. If she isn't the daughter of Qiao Family, this road will be completely cut off!She had already found out that her man was with that vixen Wang Ni-er. She gave that b*tch a good beating. She was beaten hard by Chen Xing in turn.Afterwards, Chen Xing reluctantly agreed to break up the relationship with that slut Wang Ni-er because she was still useful. Once she isn't Qiao Family's daughter, Chen Xing might immediately divorce her!She cried and rushed up: \"Mom, Dad, I know I have a bad temper and make you mad every time. But that's because I care about you too much. Don't say that I'm not your daughter. Hearing this, I feel hurt!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi's body dodged and avoided her rushing body.Qiao Hong Mei met with empty air and fell to the ground. Her nose smashed on the ground. The pain made her tears fall.At this moment, could she care about the pain? She got up and continued to sob: \"Mom, I really know I'm wrong. How could I not be your daughter? I'm made from the same mold of you!\"Everyone: \"...\"Look at her short figure and big pie face? Where did she get courage to say that she was made from the same mold as her?Qiao Xiu Zhi coldly stared at her, \"You have a cold nature and selfish in personality. Not only do you look different from everyone in our Qiao family, but you also have different personalities! Over the years, we have been wondering why you would develop this kind of character. Now we finally understand why, you are not our daughter!\"Qiao Hong Mei was so flustered that she trembled: \"Dad, I'm your daughter. You raised me from young. How could I not be your daughter? Please talk to Mom. Tell her not to treat me like this!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi was too lazy to waste time with her and asked Shen Shi Kai, \"What should I do now?\"Shen Shi Kai spoke: \"Let her sign this population register. It will record all the circumstances. From now on, there will be no parent-child relationship between you.\"\"I won't sign!\" Qiao Hong Mei cried, refusing to sign on it.Qiao Xiu Zhi frowned and asked, \"Is it okay to just imprint the index finger print without signing?\"Shen Shi Kai pondered before nodding: \"Also works. But it would be better if the people present are willing to sign their names to testify this.\"Neighbors expressed their willingness to sign.They can't latch on a high branch like Deputy Chief, but they can sell favor to the other party. If something happens in the future, the other party may be willing to give some face to them because of this favor.Qiao Hong Mei didn't expect everyone to treat her like this. She told them not to sign. No one paid heed to her!After seeing everyone's signatures, Qiao Xiu Zhi grabbed Qiao Hong Mei's hand and imprint her index finger print on it. Then she strolled away.During this process, Mother Chen was completely stunned. She only regained her sense after Qiao Xiu Zhi and others left.She jumped up and slapped Qiao Hong Mei on the face: \"You hen who can't lay eggs, I'll get my son to divorce you!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qin Xiao Mei answered the phone and was about to leave. She told them not to go out. Shen Tian You couldn't sit still anymore.Shen Tian You's eyes spun around: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, let's go out and play!\"Auntie Lan, the family helper, went out to buy vegetables. At this moment, there was only old Mister Shen who was dozing in the house. Shen Tian You felt that this was the best time to escape.Da Qiao shook her head and said disapprovingly: \"Godmother told us not to go out. You have to be obedient, understand?\"Shen Tian You's temper flared up: \"I'm not obedient. I'm suffocating at home every day. I'm going out now! You're accompanying me or not?\"Da Qiao shook her head again: \"I'm not going. I'm an obedient little cutie.\"Wishing iron could be steel, Shen Tian You stared at her. He turned and rushed out like a firecracker: \"Since you're not going with me, I'll go alone!\"\"Younger Brother Tian You, come back!\" Da Qiao anxiously stomped her feet.But the more she called, the faster Shen Tian You ran. From time to time he looked back to see if Da Qiao was catching up. When he saw Da Qiao catching up, he ran more and more frantically.\"Elder Sister Da Qiao, come and chase me!\"Da Qiao chased as thought about how she'll kick his butt when she catch up to this stinky boy!Although Shen Tian You was chubby, this didn't prevent him from becoming a nimble little chubby man. It took Da Qiao twenty minutes to catch up with him.The two stopped and panted. The looked left and right. Horrified, they discover...they were lost!Just now, in order not to let Da Qiao catch him, Shen Tian You bolted at the sight of a road. Now he stopped to realize that he had never been to this place.Although Shen Tian You had been living in the town since he was born, Shen Family never let him go out to play alone as he was the only child of Shen Family. Most of the time he went out by car. So he didn't know where they were there.While Da Qiao focused on chasing. She didn't recognize the way. Plus she only came to the town a few times. The places she knew was very limited.The two stared at each other. They were a little confused.Shen Tian You wriggled his chubby little body. Leaning over, he said with a guilty conscience, \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, what should we do now?\"Da Qiao glared at him with black grape-like eyes and reprimanded, \"Told you not to come out and insist on coming out. When Godmother return and can't find us, she will definitely be very anxious. You are truly disobedient!\"Shen Tian You's chubby cheeks were hot and flushed. He poked his fingers together and weakly responded, \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, I know I'm wrong. If Mom and Dad beat me when we get back, can you protect me?\"In Shen Family, old Mister Shen and old Madam Shen doted on the child , while Shen Shi Kai and Qin Xiao Mei, often played the bad cops. They were very strict with Shen Tian You. If he do something wrong, he will definitely be taught a lesson. In severe cases, he'll get the cane!Shen Tian You felt that his mistake was a bit serious this time. He feared that his butt would be hit when he got back. So he sought shelter from Da Qiao in advance.Da Qiao straightened her small face: \"No. Not only Godfather and Godmother want to beat you, I also want to beat you!\"Without waiting to go back, she turned Shen Tian You over and slapped his fleshy butt a few times.Shen Tian You's chubby face was so red that it seem like it almost drip blood: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, why are you spanking my butt!\"Da Qiao harrumphed: \"Since you disobedient, you get beaten. From now on, you must listen to me, or I will beat you!\"Shen Tian You was teary-eyed: He finally understood why Elder Brother An Ping would say that Elder Sister Da Qiao is so scary. He felt that way now.Da Qiao took Shen Tian You's little fleshy hand to find someone to ask for directions. But this side was a bit remote. After walking for a while, they saw a woman.Da Qiao quickly ran over with Shen Tian You and politely said, \"Auntie, may I ask you if you know...\"The woman might have been in a hurry. She dismissively spoke to them, \"I don't know. I don't know. Go and ask others.\"After speaking, the woman hurried away.Da Qiao and Shen Tian You had no choice but to keep walking forward. After unknown amount of time of walking, they finally saw another person.This time, it was a young man in his twenties. His head was like a chicken coop, looking like a completely slacker. His pair of eyes creepily eyed on them: \"I don't know the place you are talking about. Why don't you go home with me first... I'll take you to find your family when I'm free, okay?\"Da Qiao looked at the young man in front of her. Suddenly what her grandparents said to her, she felt something was wrong.She shook her head and replied, \"No need. Thank you Uncle. We'll ask others.\"After finishing speaking, she pulled Shen Tian You to leave.But they were stopped by the young man: \"Since you are here, don't think about leaving!\"He reached out to grab Da Qiao and Shen Tian You. But when he reached out, Da Qiao kicked him hard on his calf.As her body got healthier, Da Qiao's strength became stronger. Although it wasn't comparable to her grandmother, the strength wasn't something a seven-year-old girl could have.Receiving a kick on the calf, the young man was so in pain that tears came down: \"Damn it! Don't run!\"If one didn't run at this time, then they were fools!Da Qiao dragged Shen Tian You and frantically bolted forward.Although Shen Tian You was a little stunned at first, but once he regained his wits, he exerted a potential that a little chubby shouldn't have.The young man's calf painfully ached from the kick. He couldn't run fast. What he didn't expect was that the two little kids could run so fast. With one corner, they soon disappeared.\"Damn, don't let me see you again, or I'll kill you!\" The young man spat on the ground and walked away cursing.After he left for a long time, Da Qiao pulled Shen Tian You out of a dog hole.Both of them looked a little embarrassing. Their faces and clothes were dirty. They were afraid of meeting the young man again, so they had to went in the opposite direction.The opposite direction became more and more deviated. Looking at that direction, it seemed to be the road leading to the countryside. Both of them realized that something was wrong. So they had to go back the same way.When they reached the starting spot, they encountered that young man again!This time, the young man was pushing an old man: \"You damn old man, hand over all the money. Your bloodline is at a dead-end. Why are you still keeping so much money? To take to the coffin?\"The old man was so furious that his face turned red and white. He held the envelope tightly and didn't let go: \"You...you b*stard, you will have retribution! Be careful when the thunder strikes you to death!\"The young man grinned: \"If there is really retribution, how can I still live well? It's my poor elder cousin brother who died at a young age. Could it be that he was struck to death by lightning?\"Seeing him say this about his son, the old man was so mad that he almost didn't catch his breath.The young man took the opportunity to push him and snatched the envelope in his hand at the same time. Smirking, he said, \"When you die, won't all your money and house belong to me? I'm just using it in advance!\"The old man fell to the ground. His face pale with anger. His fingers trembling pointed at him: \"You...you...give me the money...give it back...\"He just took out the money from the post office and planned to go to the black market tomorrow to buy some nutritious food for his wife.The old woman had been getting worse and worse since her son died of illness. He was very anxious. Unexpectedly, he met this wicked b*stard halfway back!Da Qiao pursed her mouth tightly in anger. She turned back to Shen Tian You and spoke, \"I'm going to sort that bastard. Are you afraid?\"Shen Tian You looked at Elder Sister Da Qiao and shook his head, \"Not afraid!\"Da Qiao patted his shoulder heavily and said, \"Okay. I'll lead that person to chase after me in a while. You hide at the corner. When he comes over, immediately hit him on the leg with a stick. Understand?\"Shen Tian You took a deep breath and replied, \"Understood. Elder Sister Da Qiao, you have to be careful though. Or should I lead him?\"Da Qiao shook her head: \"No. He can't catch me!\"There happened to be a broken table in the garbage dump not far away. Da Qiao walked over, broke off the legs of the table with her bare hands, and handed it over to Shen Tian You: \"You must use force. If you can't hit him, run away immediately. Don't get caught by him!\"Shen Tian You's fiercely pounded. His little head nodded: \"I know. I won't let him catch me!\"Da Qiao didn't delay any longer. She picked up a large stone on the ground and dashed after the young man.The young man heard footsteps chasing after him and turned his head. It can said to perfect.. unlucky timing, a stone was hurled toward his forehead!#BANG!His felt a severe burst of pain. Warm blood immediately rushed out.The young man reached out and touched it. Blood smeared on his hand. When he saw that the person who smashed him was actually the little girl just now. He gritted his teeth and declared, \"Damn girl, I will kill you!\"Da Qiao didn't say much; just turned around and ran.Furious, the young man chased after her without another word. If he didn't kill this dead girl today, he wouldn't be surnamed Wei!Da Qiao's feet were like gone like the wind. But no matter how fast she was, she was still a child. She was almost caught a few times. Fortunately, the young man had be hit and his head was a little dizzy. After running for a while, his speed slowed down.Coming to the corner where Shen Tian You was hiding, Da Qiao turned around her head and said to Shen Tian You as she ran, \"Three, two, one!\"With the countdown finished, Shen Tian You swung the wooden stick out and hit the young man's calf.The young man's calf was injured earlier. Now it was injured again. The pain caused his facial features to twitch. He stumbled and fell to the ground with a #bang.Da Qiao ran back, took the wooden stick in Shen Tian You's hand and fiercely greeted the back of his head!The young man never imagined that he would fall into the hands of two little brats today!...Qin Xiao Mei came home and found that the two children weren't at home. She woke her father-in-law, but the other party didn't know anything.Her heart was pounding. She searched the whole house. Even the neighbors were asked. They all said that she had never seen the two children. She could only hope that the children went out to buy vegetables with Auntie Lan.But when Aunt Lan came back and said that the two children hadn't gone out with her. Her vision darkened and she almost fainted!Old Mister Shen felt even more guilt-stricken. He shouldn't have gone to the room to rest because of a headache!Old Madam Shen brought her daughter back from visiting the relative's house. Knowing that her grandson and Da Qiao were gone, her breath almost stopped on the spot and passed away!She cried and beat old Mister Shen: \"You damn old man, why didn't you keep an eye on Tian You?\"Qin Xiao Mei called her husband with trembling hands and asked him if he had gone home to take the two children out. When she heard the other party say no, she instantly collapse on the sofa.On such blazing hot days, she was frightened into a cold sweat.Once Shen Shi Kai knew that the two children were missing, he quickly told Qiao Xiu Zhi couple and drove them back.Then everyone searched around. After a long search, there was no news of the children at all.Qiao Xiu Zhi thought of the incident where little Wan'er was kidnapped. Her heart sank. She knew that she shouldn't have brought Da Qiao to town today.Thinking that the child might be abducted, she was heartbroken.Xue Chuan lost the smile on his face. He stretched out his hand to hold his wife's hand, \"Don't worry. That child is a lucky one. She will be fine.\"Thinking of the strange things that happened to Da Qiao, Qiao Xiu Zhi felt a little confidence in her heart and nodded. \"I know. You shouldn't worry either. Let's go out and look for them. Maybe the children ran out to play and got lost somewhere.\"Old Madam Shen and old Mister Shen couldn't stand the blow. Both had collapsed.Old Madam Shen grabbed her son's hand and cried with tears: \"Shi Kai, no matter what, you must bring them back!\"Shen Shi Kai comforted his mom, \"Don't scare yourself. I'll go back to the police station now and get my colleagues to help look everywhere. It will be all fine!\"Just when everyone was about to split up, the phone in the living room suddenly rang.Qin Xiao Mei was lying on the sofa. However, she didn't have the strength to answer the phone. So Shen Lin Lin had to run over and pick up the phone to answer.Soon, her expression shone with brilliance: \"You mean my nephew Shen Tian You, and a little girl named Da Qiao are all at the police station now?\"When everyone heard this, they gathered around and stared at the phone in Shen Lin Lin's hand.Old Madam Shen was no longer dizzy. She pushed her son away and rushed into the living room in a fast pace: \"Lin Lin, what did you say? I heard you say Tian You has been found. Where is he?\"Shen Lin Lin hung up the phone, wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes and replied, \"They are at the police station now. According to the police officer, the two of them had knocked down a hooligan!\"Hooligan!When everyone heard this word, their hearts rose again.It was just that Shen Lin Lin didn't know what happened. Hurrying up to the police station became top priority. Only when they made sure the two children were safe can their hearts truly settle down.So Shen Family hopped into the car and Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan rode their bicycle to the police station.Shen Family arrived at the police station first. When they saw the two dirty children, everyone was delighted and shocked.Old Madam Shen ran over, hugged her grandson, and touched his face up and down. Once she confirmed that he was all right, she cried: \"You brat, you scared Grandmother to death!\"Seeing that her son was fine, Qin Xiao Mei went to check on Da Qiao. Seeing that she was also fine, she breathed a sigh of relief: \"What's happened to the two of you?\"Shen Tian You shrank in his grandmother's arms with a guilty conscience; not daring to answer his mom.Da Qiao had no choice but to recount what happened.Everyone was terrified when they heard it. These two little things were too daring!Qin Xiao Mei was afraid after hearing it. She pulled her son out of her mother-in-law's arms and beat his butt twice: \"Who told ou do something bad! Not only did you almost hurt yourself, but you also almost implicated your elder sister Da Qiao. Do you know your mistake?\"Shen Tian You let his throat go all out and howled: \"Ahhh... Mom, forgive me. I know I was wrong! Grandmother, Grandfather, save your precious grandson. My butt hurts!\"Qin Xiao Mei was so angry: \"You still pretend!\"Saying that, she smacked him hard a few times.Old Madam Shen was so distressed that she hurried over to pull her precious grandson over and tightly protected him, \"Alright, alright. just hit a few times. Tian You already knows his wrong!\"Qin Xiao Mei helplessly uttered: \"Mom, you can't indulge him like this. If we don't teach him a lesson, he won't know to be afraid. Maybe he will dare to do it again next time!\"Shen Tian You hurriedly stated: \"Mom, I really know I'm wrong. And I'm not pretending. My butt really hurts!\"He was beaten a few times by Elder Sister Da Qiao earlier. His butt still hurt. Now his mom's strike was also ruthless. No matter how much flesh his ass had, it was useless!Da Qiao hurriedly spoke: \"Godmother, God-grandmother, I'm sorry. I already spanked Younger Brother Tian You to teach him a lesson earlier. Younger Brother Tian You should really hurt.\"Hearing Da Qiao's words, Qin Xiao Mei and the others became more convinced that Shen Tian You was pretending. Da Qiao was only a seven-year-old child. How strong could her be. It was like a tickle.Shen Tian You was close to tears. Elder Sister Da Qiao's strikes were heavier than his mom's. He was truly in pain.At this moment, Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan arrived.Seeing Grandmother and Grandfather, Da Qiao rushed over and hugged her grandmother's neck: \"Grandmother, Grandfather, I'm sorry. I made you worry!\"Godmother was beating as she detailed how everyone was anxiously finding the two of them. She felt very guilty.Qiao Xiu Zhi checked her over. Seeing that she wasn't injured, she felt relieved. Then they listened to Qin Xiao Mei telling them what happened.She reached out and rubbed the child's hair: \"If you encounter such a thing in the future, you must not be reckless. This time, you're lucky since there's no mishap. But you can't be lucky all your life. When you encounter this kind of thing in the future, remember to find an adult. Understand?\"Da Qiao nodded and obediently responded, \"I understand, Grandmother. I won't do anything that worries you in the future.\"Wei Bao Sheng came over after recording his statement. He bowed to Qiao and Chen Family and thanked them: \"I really owe it to the two children today. Otherwise I definitely won't be able to get the money back today!\"The young man who robbed him of his money was his distant nephew Wei Jia Yang. The other party was an idler, who didn't have any proper career all day. His eyes were only fixed on the wealth of the two old elderly.Before, he asked for some money from him from time to time. Considering how he and his wife would need someone go to visit their grave and their son's after they passed, so he endured it before.He never though that Wei Jia Yang would become more and more greedy because of his tolerance and even dared to rob him of money in the street. The reason why he dared to do this was because he knew he wouldn't call the police!When he was pushed down, he thought it through. Even if no one sweep their grave, he could no longer condone this beast!Wei Bao Sheng wanted to use money to thank the two children, but was rejected by Qiao and Chen Family.This was a pitiful old man. His only son died of illness. It was enough that they were alone with no one to depend on. Now they were bullied by his distant nephew!His injury wasn't light from today's push. He sprained his waist. It was estimated that he'll have to rest for a good few days. Shen Shi Kai felt him pitiful and gave him an ride back.When they came to Wei's house, Wei Bao Sheng thanked them again.Sharp-eye Qin Xiao Mei noticed a sign for sale hanging on the house next to his house and asked, \"Whose house is that? Is it for sale?\"Wei Bao Sheng glanced over and sighed, \"The house is mine. We two old undying can't live in such a big place, so we want to sell the house. Our wallet can also be wider.\"The house was originally intended for his son to live in after marry a wife. Who knew that his son would die of illness before he could marry a wife. He wanted to sell the house long ago, but his wife was unwilling.Until recently, they were running out of money and had no choice but to sell the house.Qin Xiao Mei spoke: \"Please take down the sign. We will come to see tomorrow. You meet Qiao Family just now. They have been searching for a house. If it is suitable, they would probably buy it.\"When Wei Bao Sheng heard that Qiao family wanted to buy a house, he had already made a decision. He affirmatively nodded: \"Okay, I'll take off the sign later.\"It wasn't that no one wanted to buy this house. They didn't want to casually sell it.The two of them were old and had no children. Naturally, they hoped to have good neighbors. It would be best to have someone like Qiao Family as neighbors!After Qin Xiao Mei went back, she immediately told Qiao Xiu Zhi about the house.Qiao Xiu Zhi originally planned to return to the production team. Because of the house issue, they had to stay overnight at Shen's house and go to see the house tomorrow. If they were satisfied, they would buy the house.The next day, they went to see the house. Because this house was originally planned by Wei Family as a wedding house for their son, the house was beautiful.Although the location was a little out of the way, this location was relatively close to the food factory. If they buy it, Qiao Zhen Jun can live there occasionally in the future. So after consideration, Qiao Family planned to buy it.Wei Bao Sheng originally planned to sell the house for 1,200 yuan. Due to being grateful to Da Qiao for saving him yesterday, he only wanted 800 yuan.800 yuan to buy three bedroom and a small yard in the town was too good-value. Even Shen Family had to sigh about Qiao Family's good luck.Qiao Xiu Zhi told Wei Family they'll come over in two days for money payment and transfer of the house. Then they said goodbye to Shen Family and returned to the production team....Back at Qiao's house.After everyone in Qiao Family knew what had happened, they would sigh in shock from time to time while listening to it like a story.Qiao Zhen Min raised his eyebrows and spoke, \"Mom, so Hong Mei isn't my elder sister anymore?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded: \"Yes. We have cut off our relationship with her. If she comes back in the future, you can directly drive her out!\"If it wasn't for Hong Mei's character, she would definitely not be so unfeeling when taking how long they had raised her into consideration. She could only blame herself!Qiao Zhen Min jollily commented, \"That's great! I used to wonder why she had such a personality. It turns out that she's not from our Qiao Family at all!\"Afraid that Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan would be sad, no one mentioned the child who had been swapped out.Everyone can only hope that the heaven will open its eyes and let them meet one day.Qiao Zhen Guo didn't care if Hong Mei was his younger sister. As soon as his parents came back, he immediately wiped the bicycle carefully with a cloth like serving his ancestors.Qiao Zhen Guo had no other talents. However, he can learn to ride very quickly. He grasped it in less than three days.Wan Chun Ju immediately asked her man to drive her around the production team.People were really envious!Wan Chun Ju sat on the back frame of the bicycle and smugly laughed. Who knew that the next moment would sorrow birthed emerged from joy.She laughed so hard that she dislocated her jaw!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her mouth grinning from ear to ear: \"Oh, a ride on a bicycle is different. It feels cool when the wind blows, it feels like something... Right, it feels like going up to heaven!\"Everyone: \"...\"Was it that exaggerated?Some people knew that Wan Chun Ju was showing off. Still, they can't help but envy: \"Eldest Qiao's wife, can I experience this feeling of going to heaven?\"Wan Chun Ju's chin was about to go up to the sky: \"Of course... you can't! I haven't sat down enough yet. This flying feeling... Hahaha, you can't understand it... Hahaahhhhhh...\"She laughed and turned into a shriek.Everyone: \"...\"Why did she make a scream out of the blue?Qiao Zhen Guo sighed while pedaling on the bicycle: \"Wife, just laugh if you want. Why do you have to make slaughtered pig scream? No wonder the production team want to call you Wan Pig Slaughterer.\"Wan Chun Ju gasped in pain: \"Zhen Guo...Mai jaw dopped fro laughin...\"Qiao Zhen Guo was stunned for a moment before realizing what his wife meant: \"Wife, keep a low profile.\"Wan Chun Ju's tears were about to fall: \"Nuh...Mai aaw dropped!\"As soon as she finished speaking, she heard a child call out: \"Look. Wan Pig Slaughterer is drooling!\"Everyone's eyes fell on Wan Chun Ju's face.It was fine if they didn't look. Now they did, it was startling!Wan Chun Ju was drooling. Her entire face suddenly elongated by a third more!F*ck, what was going on?An older elderly man spoke: \"This is laughing so hard that she laughed off her chin!\"Everyone: \"...\"Qiao Zhen Guo had to stop when he heard everyone's comments and his wife had been pestering him at his waist.He looked back and laughed like a dog: \"Hahaha... Wife, what's wrong with your chin? You look like the foolish girl from the neighboring production team. You are still drooling!\"Wan Chun Ju had the heart to kill him: \"...\"The production team gathered around liked they were watching monkeys.\"F*ck, this is the first time in my life that I know that jaw drop from laughing can literally happen!\"\"Me too! Eldest Qiao's wife, you can't close your mouth, right?\"\"Waste of words! If can, would she drool like a fool?\"\"Hahaha, Eldest Qiao's wife's behavior is even more stupid than the fool girl from the neighboring production team. I'm gonna die from laughing!\"Wan Chun Ju was immersed in pain, anger, and embarrassment. She wanted to speak, but as soon as she opened her mouth, more saliva flowed out. What's more, the two sides of her forehead was aching.It was still the same old man from before. He urged Qiao Zhen Guo, \"Eldest Qiao, stop laughing. Quickly get your wife's chin back in place!\"Qiao Zhen Guo naively uttered: \"Don't need to go to the hospital?\"The elderly man spoke with wisdom: \"No, no need. One hand press her head, the other hand hold her chin. Then lift it hard. It's very simple!\"Taking in his wife's appearance, Qiao Zhen Guo jollily told, \"Wife, I'll help you put your chin back in place. You're really going to make me laugh to death!\"The dislocated-chin Wan Chun Ju:\"...\"He pissed her off. What kind of man had she married?Following what the elderly man said, Qiao Zhen Guo put one hand on the top of her head and the other on her chin and lifted it hard...\"Ahhhhh\u2026\u2026\"Wan Chun Ju let out a shrill scream in pain. The nearby birds flew up in fright.When everyone saw it, they were stunned again.Not only was Wan Chun Ju's chin not put back, but it was also crooked!The method the elderly man said was actually effective. However, when Qiao Zhen Guo exerted force, Wan Chun Ju suddenly yelled. He got startled and the direction of his hand was deviated.Therefore, one side of Wan Chun Ju's chin was fixed, but the other side still off. Not only was the whole face longer, but also became crooked.After being frozen, Qiao Zhen Guo laughed like a dog again: \"Wife, your face is like the face of a donkey who was punched. Hahaha, my stomach hurts from laughing...\"Everyone: \"...\"Although the imagery was very similar, was it really good for him, her man, to laugh like this?Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"She nearly stopped breathing and passed on the spot!In the end, Qiao Zhen Guo had no choice but to send her to the health clinic. Under the professional technique of the doctor, Wan Chun Ju's chin was put back into place.It was just that her chin felt sore that she wanted to cry: \"Doctor, why do I still feel pain when it's back in place?\"The doctor said: \"Pain is normal. Not only will you be in pain now, but you will be in pain for a month!\"Wan Chun Ju was shocked. With her mouth wide open, she uttered: \"What? In pain for a month... ahhj... it hurts me to death!\"The doctor scolded: \"You don't want it to get better? Still dare to open your mouth so wide? Do you still want to your chin to dislocate? I'm telling you, you have to be careful in the future. Not only can't laugh too loudly, but also don't open your mouth too much when yawning. Hard things can't be eaten. If it hurts too much at night, put a hot towel on it!\"Wan Chun Ju: All thoughts were despairing.It wasn't just one month of pain, but also can't eat a lot of things. Even when yawning, she has to be careful. What was the point of her being alive?When Qiao Zhen Guo jollily went back and told Qiao Family about his wife's jaw dropping. Qiao Family was speechless.It was also the first time they saw someone laugh off their chin. Only this kind of matter can happen to Wan Chun Ju.At dinner that night, Wan Chun Ju drank congee again. This time it was even worse than when she was pregnant. At that time, she could eat some green vegetables. But now she can't even eat green vegetables!Wan Chun Ju: Life was worst than death....Two days later, Xue Chuan took Qiao Xiu Zhi to the town and bought the house.The whole house plus other expenses came up to a total of 820 yuan. However, Qiao Xiu Zhi told others that it only cost 500 yuan.The extra 300 yuan was her and Xue Chuan's private fund. They quietly helped Da Qiao out. Even Da Qiao's parents didn't know about it. Everyone just thought that Qiao Family got a big bargain.When the slack season came, Qiao Family all took leave to go to the town for a house-warming party at the newly bought house.This was also the first time Da Qiao saw her house.The house wasn't very big. There were three rooms in total, plus a small yard. It had been renovated before. The whole house looked very new.Moreover, the two elders of Wei Family cherished the house very much. Not only were they reluctant to rent it out, but they also came over to clean it every day. So the house was well maintained.All in all, this house was a great buy!Wan Chun Ju held her little daughter. Her eyes were scanning around. and her heart was bubbling with vinegar: \"Tsk tsk tsk, such a good house is only five hundred yuan. Da Qiao, you are really a blind cat encountering dead mice. Picked up a great bargain!\"Qiao Family: \"...\"The two elders of Wei family: \"...\" How did they become dead mice?Wan Chun Ju didn't notice other people's expressions. She turned to ask Wei Family's elderly, \"Do you want to sell the house next door? I'll buy it from you for five hundred yuan!\"Wei Family's two elderly: \"...\"If the house next door is sold, they'll sleep on the street?And she actually want to buy a four-bedroom next door plus a big yard with 500 yuan! She can really dream!Qiao Zhen Guo spoke: \"Wife, where do you get the five hundred yuan? It's better to speak less. Be careful when your jaw drops again, hahaha...\"Wan Chun Ju's face went red and white: \"...\"In the past few days, her man had been making fun of her every day about this matter. Can't he get over this hurdle?Qiao Xiu Zhi was too lazy to watch this stupid son and stupid daughter-in-law. She went to the department store with Xue Chuan to buy some homeware. Although Wei Family gave some furniture, they still had to buy things like pots and pans.Many things in the house were incomplete. So when it was time for lunch, Qiao Xiu Zhi originally wanted to take everyone to a state-run restaurant for a \"luxury\" trip. However, Wei Family insisted that they stay their side.Wei Family were so hospitable. Qiao Xiu Zhi couldn't refuse it. So she got her eldest son to buy some meat and vegetables before taking her eldest granddaughter, Qiao Dong He, to the kitchen to help.Wei's house hadn't been so lively for a long time. Since the death of their son, the family has been desolated. Because of the death of her son, Wei Bao Sheng's wife, old woman Luo became even more ill and had been lying in bed for a good few years.Because of the arrival of Qiao Family, she was in high spirit and ate half a bowl of rice and sat for a long time.Da Qiao knew that Grandpa Wei and Grandma Luo sold the house to her at a low price. She was very grateful. When everyone wasn't paying attention, she dropped two jade beads in the water Grandma Luo was drinking.What's more, she had brought dried roses and jasmine flowers for them. Brewing these two kinds of scented tea was more effective than eating health products.Wei Bao Sheng liked this little girl, Da Qiao very much. If his son hadn't died, his granddaughter would have been this old.Seeing that Da Qiao have present for them, he was so moved that he secretly wiped his tears: \"Good child, I heard that you planted these flowers yourself?\"Da Qiao proudly puffed out her chest, \"I planted it myself. Do Grandpa Wei like it? If you do, I will transplant some flowers over next time.\"Wei Bao Sheng felt that it would be good to plant some flowers in the yard. Now only would one's mood improve when seeing it, he could ask get old woman to get up to water and move about. It should be good for her body. So he nodded in agreement.Old woman Luo also liked Da Qiao very much. She held her in her arms and caressed her tender face with her rough hands; feeling both happy and sad in her heart.Having the same thought as her spouse, she recalled her dead son. She really hoped that Qiao Family would move to the town quickly.It was just that Qiao Family won't come to live for a while.First, Qiao Zhen Jun's work wasn't stable yet. Secondly, Lin Hui was about to give birth. If she moved here, she will have to take care of four children by herself. She definitely won't be able to handle it by herself.Therefore, the matter of moving to the town can only be postponed later. Fortunately, Fang Xiao Juan and Xiao Qiao were no longer in the production team. So it didn't matter if they move later.When Qiao Family was about to go back in the afternoon, Wei Bao Sheng sent them to the mouth of the alley. His reluctance to part made people feel very sad....Qiao Zhen Guo was riding a bicycle with Lin Hui and her big belly behind him. The rest of the group slowly returned to the production team.As soon as they entered the village, someone came to tip off: \"Oh, you guys are finally back. Your Hong Mei came over in the morning and waited at the door for a long time. You should go back!\"Hearing this, all of Qiao Family were like being fed with flies; a mouthful of disgust.Back at Qiao's old house, they found Qiao Hong Mei and her four daughters sitting in a row at the door of Qiao's house.\"Dad, Mom, you are finally back!\" Qiao Hong Mei heard the footsteps. She raised her head and saw Qiao Family returning and immediately flew over.Qiao Xiu Zhi stopped her to prevent her from bumping into Lin Hui's belly. She coldly spoke, \"I've made it clear to you last time. What are you doing here?\"Qiao Hong Mei took out a handkerchief from her pocket and wiped her tears. She didn't have any tears at first, but as soon as she wiped, the tears flowed down like a faucet was turned on.She cried: \"Mom, I've reflected on it for the past few days. You were so kind to me in the past, but I was blinded by lard and couldn't see it! Mom, I truly know I was wrong. Please forgive me! \"As she said that, she beckoned her four daughters: \"Come here now and beg your grandma and grandpa!\"As if the four golden flowers were well trained, they all rushed forward and shouted in unison, \"Grandma, Grandpa, Mom knows she is wrong. Please forgive mom!\"\"Grandma, Grandpa, little Cutie doesn't want to leave you. Don't chase little Cutie away, okay?\"Chen Lai Di even hugged Qiao Xiu Zhi's thigh; completely imitating Da Qiao's tone and coquettishly behavior.Everyone in Qiao Family was disgusted.An Ping scratched his head and said, \"Mom, is\u00a0Chen Er Mei\u00a0imitating Younger Sister Da Qiao? It's really scary!\"Wan Chun Ju curled her lips and mocked, \"Isn't she just imitating Da Qiao. She is\u00a0Dong Shi laughing at poverty! But I can't understand why Dong Shi is getting poorer the more he laughs?\"Everyone: \"...\"When Chen Lai Di heard that An Ping called her Chen Er Mei, she was irked: \"What nonsense are you talking about. My name is Chen Laidi!\"Qiao Dong Ying laughed, \"I think you might as well be called Chen Er Mei!\"The four daughters of Chen Family were named\u00a0Chen Zhao Di, Chen Lai Di, Chen Qiu Di, and Chen Huan Di. It made it seem that the purpose of their existence was to summon their younger brother!The atmosphere was so stirred up by Qiao Family's first branch, it couldn't become 'tragic' anymore.Qiao Hong Mei gritted her teeth in anger; wishing she could go up and slap them hard.But she dared not!She took a deep breath, wiped her eyes with a handkerchief again, and tearfully spoke: \"Dad, Mom, even if I'm not your own, but you have raised me for so many years. I'm full of gratitude toward you. I must give you old age care. If I leave like this, won't I become a white-eyed wolf?\"Wan Chun Ju curled her lips again and muttered, \"Said it as if you weren't a white-eyed wolf before.\"Qiao Hong Mei blushed like a cooked shrimp from anger: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, can you be a little more compassionate?\"Before she could finish speaking, she was interrupted by Wan Chun Ju: \"Hey, hey,\u00a0you can randomly eat sh*t but not randomly talk nonsense. I'm not your eldest sister-in-law. Stop with the nonsense!\"Qiao Hong Mei was trembling with fury. Why didn't she know Wan Chun Ju's mouth could be so poisonous before?Seeing that Qiao Hong Mei was fuming, Wan Chun Ju turned back and whispered to her mother-in-law: \"Mom, what do you think of my retort?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi twitched her mouth and responded, \"Very good. Later, reward a bowl of egg drop!\"Wan Chun Ju's eyes were as bright as a thief at night. She turned around and dumped her youngest daughter to her eldest daughter. She was ready to have a good 'battle' with Qiao Hong Mei!Everyone: \"...\"Since there was a big commotion at Qiao's house, the people around them immediately gathered.\"What's going on? What trouble crop up now?\"\"I say, Hong Mei, what's with you? Why do you have to make chaos every time you come back to your maternal home?\"\"That's right. How could there be a daughter like you? I think Auntie Xiu Zhi has a very good temper. If you were my daughter, I would have beaten you to death!\"Qiao Family was getting better and better. On top of that, Qiao Family had recently bought a bicycle. As long as they weren't muddled, they won't offend Qiao Family. Everyone was taking the initiative to speak for Qiao Family at this moment.Qiao Hong Mei almost spat out a mouthful of blood. She really didn't expect that all the villagers would help Qiao family!She took a deep breath again and took the initiative to say that she wasn't the daughter of Qiao family.She wiped her tears and stated, \"Uncles and Aunties, you all watched me grow up. Although I am a bit outspoken, I don't have any bad intentions. My parents worked hard to raise me. If I don't give them old age care, am I still human?\"When everyone heard that Qiao Hong Mei wasn't from Qiao Family, they were shocked on the spot!\"My God, there is such a thing? Who is so vicious to swap the babies?\"\"The other party deserves to be struck by lightning! If my baby is swapped and I find the other party, I will definitely kill them!\"\"Me too! No wonder Hong Mei's appearance and personality are different from Qiao Family. It turns out that she's not from Qiao Family at all!\"\"It's said that dragons give birth to dragons, phoenixes give birth to phoenixes, and mice are born to burrow. Hong Mei's temperament is probably just like her biological parents! Tsk tsk tsk, her biological parents did such a thing and Hong Mei actually has the face to come and pester Qiao Family? It's good enough that they didn't kill you!\"Qiao Hong Mei: ?She took in the villagers filled with righteous indignation and wanted to come up and teach her on behalf of Qiao Family. She almost doubted her life.She took another deep breath. Just as she was prepared to pretend to be pitiful. she heard someone speak first: \"By the way, Auntie Xiu Zhi, when Hong Mei got married, you gave her a lot of dowry. Take it back?\"Qiao Hong Mei's heart dropped and her whole body stiffened.Since her mother-in-law and men knew that she wasn't the daughter of Qiao Family, they had already disliked her very much. Her man had rekindled his relationship with that vixen, Wang Ni-er.She knelt on the ground and begged him for a long time before he reluctantly agreed that he wouldn't divorce. Stated that she have to reconcile with Qiao Family. Otherwise he would divorce her immediately.If she can't repair the relationship with Qiao Family and instead spit the dowry back out, her man will kill her!Qiao Xiu Zhi coldly sneered: \"You reminded me. Eldest, go and call the production leader...\"Before her sentence was finished, Qiao Hong Mei turned around and ran as if a ghost was chasing her. Completely abandoning her daughters!The four golden flowers of Chen Family: \"...\"With a perked up face, Wan Chun Ju asked: \"Mom, do you want me to catch that fake back?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi shook her head: \"Forget it. Let's go in.\"In fact, she didn't forget about the dowry. Just deliberately didn't mention it.They thought of this point before going to cut ties with Qiao Hong Mei.If they take back the dowry, not only Qiao Hong Mei, but also Chen Family will incessantly pester. Getting pestered will be a very disgusting experience to go through.In addition, if they ask for the dowry back through Shen Family, Qiao Hong Mei will have no worries. At the time, it will be useless even if Qiao Family chases her away.Might as well use the money to buy a clean cut.After this time, Qiao Hong Mei probably won't casually come to the production team in the future. Even if she encounter people from their Qiao Family, she will take the initiative to detour.After Qiao Family entered, everyone sighed one after another.Some people sympathized with Qiao Family for losing their daughter amd scolded the person who swapped the child and the old nurse. Some remarked Qiao Family was kind; didn't make Qiao Hong Mei spit back the dowry.Of course, there was no shortage of people who watch jokes. However, these people weren't like before Due to being afraid of offending Qiao Family, they dare not speak out.Seeing that her mother-in-law didn't pursue it, Wan Chun Ju felt her flesh ached. She pondered how the next time she sees Qiao Hong Mei, she must get the dowry back!...Not only was Qiao Hong Mei in trouble, Fang Xiao Juan was also frustrated.After she arrived in Hu City, Meng Hong Guang bought her all kinds of delicious food, had clothes made for me, bought her vanishing cream for facial, and clam oil for her hands. She seemed to be soaked in honey water.After only half a month, her whole person was like a dead tree blooming in spring. She suddenly became charming again.This kind of day was what she wanted!She can't wait to let Qiao Family and Wang Family see her current life and make them envy her!Though Meng Hong Guang was wonderful to her, there was one thing bad. That is... he never mentioned marriage after coming here for so long!Xiao Qiao also found this strange and unsettled. She urged her mom: \"Mom, this matter can't be delayed any longer. You got to talk to Uncle Meng tonight.\"Be it seduction or acting cute, they had to get Meng Hong Guang to nod no matter what.Fang Xiao Juan looked at herself in the mirror and said, \"I know. With old Madam Meng, you have to work harder!\"Meng Hong Guang's mother didn't like her, especially she had been married twice.However, she loved her grandson very much. Xiao Qiao seized this point and offered to teach Meng Hong Guang's son to read. Because of this, old Madam Meng's attitude towards Xiao Qiao was much better than when she first came.Xiao Qiao nodded to show that she knew what to do.In the evening, Fang Xiao Juan specially dressed herself up to serve Meng Hong Guang well at night. Then she can bring up the matter of marriage.Who knew that when Meng Hong Guang came back and saw her beautifully dressed, he smiled and said, \"How did you know that I was going to take you out tonight?\"Fang Xiao Juan's mind came to a halt for a moment. Then her eyes lit up: \"I didn't know, but...are you really going to take me out?\"After half a month, Meng Hong Guang never took her out. Let alone introduce her to his colleagues and friends.Meng Hong Guang eyed her up and down, approvingly smiled, \"Deputy Director Liang asked me to go to his house for dinner tonight. Come with me!\"Fang Xiao Juan was overjoyed. Then she nervously responded: \"Do you think it would be discourtesy of me to dress like this? Should I go in and change?\"Meng Hong Guang shook his head: \"No need. You are so good. It's getting late, we'll depart now.\"Fang Xiao Juan eagerly nodded. Before going out, she glanced at Xiao Qiao. Both of their eyes were full of joy.But soon, she couldn't keep the smile.She thought that Deputy Director Liang would have invited a lot of people. After she went there, she found that the other party only invited the two of them.But this was not a problem. The problem was that the other party had been looking at her with leering eyes. It made her very uncomfortable.She wanted to hint at Meng Hong Guang, but Meng Hong Guang seemed to act blind all night. As if he he didn't sense anything at all!She endured the nausea and hoped to quickly go back after eating.Unexpectedly, after the meal, Meng Hong Guang pulled her aside and softly spoke, \"Xiao Juan, Director Liang likes you very much. You stay and take care of him tonight.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Fang Xiao Juan heard this words, it felt like falling into an ice cellar: \"You... what do you mean? Do you want me to help Deputy Director Liang clean the house?\"A strange smile appeared on the corner of Meng Hong Guang's mouth and said, \"Xiao Juan, we're all adult, why do you pretend to be so innocent?\"Counting him, she had had three men in total. And these included the ones he knew. Who knew if she had slept with other men in private?Fang Xiao Juan's face flashed red and white. Trembling with anger, she responded: \"Surnamed Meng, is that why you tried everything to deceive me to come here?\"What gratitude? What unrequited love? Those were all farts!No wonder she had been here for so long and he never mentioned marriage. It was for this!She thought Meng Hong Guang would definitely be angry. Instead, he had a soft expression, put his hand on her shoulder, and hugged her. Fang Xiao Juan twisted a few times but couldn't get away. She could only let him hug her.Meng Hong Guang lowered his head and pecked her on the mouth: \"Xiao Juan, what I said before is sincere. I really want to marry you and want you to live a good life! Outsiders assume I live a top-notch life, but who truly understand the struggle I go through in the bureau. I have no connections and no family background. I may be squeezed out anytime and anywhere. If I want to stay or even go further, I can only hold on to Deputy Director Liang's thigh. Do you understand?\"Fang Xiao Juan felt his tenderness and the fury in her heart dissipated a lot.Still, she remained unwilling: \"Then you can use other methods. We can give gifts to Deputy Director Liang. Or if he has other requirements, we will find a way to satisfy him! Hong Guang, I am your woman. If I really do that, will you still want me?\"Men can have three wives and four concubines, but they require women to be clean and tidy. If she really slept with Deputy Director Liang, he would definitely kick her away when she is no longer useful!A hint of annoyance flashed passed Meng Hong Guang's eyes. However, his face still showed affection: \"Xiao Juan, why would you think that? Haven't you felt how much I love you during this time? The amount of fingers in one hand can't count how many people want to beg Deputy Director Liang. Also, with what I have, do you think I can gift Deputy Director Liang anything?\"Fang Xiao Juan bit her lip and was silent for a while.It was only after she came to Hu City that she realized Meng Hong Guang wasn't as rich and powerful as she thought.Meng Family currently lived in the family apartment. A property of 30 square meters, which was divided into two rooms. There were five people including her and Xiao Qiao. It was very crowded.More importantly, this family apartment didn't belong to Meng Hong Guang. If one day he stop working for the Urban Development Bureau, the property will be taken back.Meng Hong Guang saw Fang Xiao Juan's resolve budge and continued: \"Xiao Juan, only you can help me. Someone will retire from the position of administration deputy director in the second half of the year. Deputy Director Liang promised me just now that as long as you serve him well, he will recommend me. Once I'm promoted, I'll be a real official!\"He was just a secretary now. To put it bluntly, he did the odd jobs. He may be fired anytime. Besides, being a secretary had little oil and more water. He can't make his own decisions either. He wasn't willing to be a 'slave' all his life!Fang Xiao Juan thought of Deputy Director Liang's seven or eight months-sized belly and his oily pig-headed face. She felt sick for a while. But if she didn't agree, she was afraid that Meng Hong Guang would drive her away tomorrow.She can't go back to the production team!If she goes back like this, she will definitely become a laughing stock. Qiao Family will look down on her because of this. She will stay in Hu City no matter what!Meng Hong Guang gave the last dose of strong medicine, \"Xiao Jan, as long as you accompany Deputy Director Liang tonight, we will go to register for marriage tomorrow!\"Fang Xiao Juan's eyes lit up: \"You're not lying to me?\"Meng Hong Guang stretched out his hand and pinched her face. He grinningly responded, \"I can lie to anyone but not to you, my darling sweetheart!\"Fang Xiao Juan patted his hand away and said, \"But...but if I really do that, you won't mind?\"Meng Hong Guang stated with a serious face: \"Little fool, if I mind, why would I let you come over? Isn't that the logic? Besides, you're making sacrifice for me. My heart is currently so moved. How could I possibly dislike you?\"Fang Xiao Juan pondered and found it was logical. She had married two men before. If Meng Hong Guang mind, he wouldn't treated her well in the first place. In the past half month, he spent more than 100 yuan on herself!Someone in later generations said to see if a man is sincere to you, see if he's willing to spend money on you. It wasn't just listening to the other party's sweet words.Meng Hong Guang was willing to spend money on her. At least he had her in his heart!Fang Xiao Juan struggled a bit before reluctantly nod, \"Then we agreed in advance. It's just one night!\"Meng Hong Guang's eyes lit up. Beaming, he replied: \"Don't worry. It's just one night. You go in now. Deputy Director Liang is waiting for you inside. I'll come and pick you up tomorrow!\"Fang Xiao Juan felt a little uneasy. She grabbed his departing hand and said, \"Can't you just stay and wait for me here?\"Meng Hong Guang rubbed her head and reassured: \"If neither of us go back, then our mom will go to the police. Besides, although I don't mind, I'm still a man. If I hear anything, do you think I can really be indifferent?\"Fang Xiao Juan witnessed once again how he cared about her. She felt as if she had eaten honey. So she let go of his hand and urged, \"Then remember to pick me up tomorrow!\"As long as tonight is over, she can become Mrs. Meng tomorrow!But soon, Fang Xiao Juan regretted until her bowels were green!As soon as she walked into the room, she was picked up by Deputy Director Liang and slammed onto the bed. Although the bed was covered with a quilt, she still gasped in pain.Before she could speak, her clothes were torn!That was right. Not taken off, but torn apart!Deputy Director Liang hadn't reached fifty years old yet. Still, his figure was tall and fat. His strength was like that of an ox!The more perverted behavior was following this. She saw him drag a suitcase from the bottom of the bed. From inside, he took out hemp ropes to tie her hands and feet.Fang Xiao Juan's heart was beating wildly. Her face turned pale with fright, \"Deputy Director, what, what are you doing? Can you let go of my hands and feet?\"SLAP!Deputy Director Liang slapped her in the face without warning. Then a cotton ball was used to gag her mouth.Fang Xiao Juan shook her head and let out a muffled cry. Her eyes widened as if she had seen a ghost.No matter how scared she was, it was too late for her to regret it at this moment.The next day, Deputy Director Liang got up in good spirits and went to work. Before going out, he opened the cabinet, took out two large bundles of tenner and threw them at Fang Xiao Juan. Smilingly, he remarked, \"You did wonderfully. I'll call you next time!\"Fang Xiao Juan shivered uncontrollably when she heard this.Deputy Director Liang took in her terrified expression and jollily shouted: \"Quite interesting.\"Only when the door outside was heard closing, Fang Xiao Juan sat up from under the quilt.Her movement pulled the wound under her body; causing her to gasp in pain.This pervert not only tied her hands and feet and beat her with whips last night, but also... used various unspeakable tools on her body!Pervert! Perverted psycho!Fang Xiao Juan was burning with fury. Why should she suffer such a crime, while Lin Hui was cherished in the hands of Qiao Zhen Jun?Recalling the last time she met Lin Hui and how she was being carefully supported by Qiao Zhen Jun, she couldn't help but sizzle.If Lin Hui hadn't married Qiao Zhen Jun, Qiao Zhen Jun would definitely remarry her. Then she wouldn't come over with Meng Hong Guang. So it was all Lin Hui's fault!B*tch! Since she couldn't fair well, she won't make it easier for Lin Hui either!Fang Xiao Juan lowered her head. She took the two bundles of tenner on the bed and counted. There were actually two hundred and fifty yuan!She grasped the money and laughed.Meng Hong Guang didn't come to pick her up until noon. He acted very thoughtfully toward her. It made Fang Xiao Juan feel a lot better.After nursing the injury for a day, Meng Hong Guang fulfilled his promise. He deliberately asked for leave for two hours the next day and brought Fang Xiao Juan over to get the certificate.With the marriage certificate in hand, Fang Xiao Juan didn't have her initial excitement and joy.After Meng Hong Guang went back to work, Fang Xiao Juan didn't go back to Meng's house immediately. Instead, she turned her head and walked toward the post office....As the weather got hotter, the situation in the county suddenly became tense.It was unknown whether it was because of Qiu Xin Yong's incident and gave the county leaders a wake-up call. After a multi-party meeting, the county decided to rectify their standard!The correction didn't only apply to officials, but also the ordinary people. The first thing that bears the brunt was the current relationship between men and women.If a man and a woman were seen talking and laughing in the public, they will be detained for questioning. If they were a husband and wife, it would be fine. If not, lock up!If one dare to hold hands in the street and corrupt the atmosphere, it will be even worse. They will be directly arrested and paraded on the street!With this correction, everyone was on high alert. Young men and women must walk more than an arm away. If not, they will be questioned in nine out of ten cases.This was the situation in the county and in the town. As for the production team, it was catching those young men and women who were secretly dating and also remained unmarried.Production team leader Wang Shui Sheng went to the community to partake a meeting and came back. He immediately rang the gong and gathered all the community members for a meeting.Wang Shui Sheng stood on the stage and bellowed out: \"The atmosphere is getting worse and worse right now. The leaders in the county have recently issued a document to get the major production teams rectify this! The leader said, those who aren't dating for the purpose of marriage are committing hooliganism. So unmarried young people, if you have interest, you should set a banquet or obtain a certificate!\"When everyone heard this, they immediately went into a flurry of discussion.While Da Zhi, who was standing in the educated youth group, her face is very pale and ugly.At the beginning, she set her eyes on Qiao Zhen Guo. Who knew that the other party was a wooden block. No, a wooden block would be more tactful than him!Later, she fell in love with Wang Yan Sheng. This time, it wasn't purely out of taking advantage of the other party. She wanted to marry him. Unfortunately, he didn't even give her a single gaze!What was even more irritating was that the other party got engaged to a broken shoe later. It made her so angry that she almost vomited blood!After that, she still wanted to find other men in the production team to help her with her work. Sadly, everyone thought she was had been r*ped by others. When they saw her, they looked at her with meaningful gazes. It irked her every time!With no other choice, she had to accept the help of favus-riddled Gou Sheng. Although he was ugly and useless, he was better than nothing as he was young and strong.During this period of time, she only needed to go to the field and pass the time every day. The heavy work was left to Gou Sheng to do. If they enter this catching phrase now, it meant that she will have to do the work by herself!Thinking of this, she was in a turmoil for a while. But if she was to marry the dog because of this, it would be absolutely impossible!Who knew that after the meeting, she was immediately reported!In less than half a day, she was called by Wang Shui Sheng to the office for a talk.Wang Shui Sheng told her that there were a good few report letter about her and Gou Sheng dating. He asked her what she was going to do?Vexed, Da Zhi gritted her teeth and insisted that she was being falsely accused. She and Gou Sheng weren't dating at all. They were innocent.When Wang Shui Sheng heard her explanation, he couldn't help but want to roll his eyes. Even if he didn't have these report letters, he would have to interview the two of them, because he had seen Gou Sheng help her several times!Was taking advantage of people every day called innocent?No matter how aggrieved she was, Wang Shui Sheng straightforwardly told her the higher-up's countermeasures: \"You can either get married, or you can get arrested and be paraded on the streets. After the parade, you will be sent the farms to for reform!\"Because a corrupt person like Qiu Xin Yong appeared in the town, the leaders of the county town were named and criticized by the leaders of the provincial capital. So the leaders of the county town were on fire even when it wasn't new officials taking post period.These production team leader were the lowest ranked 'officials'. They will do what the higher up told them to do. If anyone disobey, then arrest them all!Da Zhi trembled with fury. Her face flushed red: \"Captain...I, I was really fals...\"Wang Shui Sheng waved his hand and interrupted her, \"I've said everything I need to say. I'll give you a day to think about it. If you don't want to get married, then I'll register you two's names!\"Da Zhi wailed out in anger.In the end, in order not to be paraded on the streets and not to go to the farm, Da Zhi was forced to agree to 'marry' Gou Sheng.Gou Sheng was a bachelor for twenty-six years. He finally had a wife. He was so happy that he was laughing in his dreams. All day, his mouth was curved up. It made him look even more foolish and ugly.Gou Sheng's family was poor. It was impossible to treat guests with wedding wine. Da Zhi wasn't willing to go to the town with him to get a certificate. So under the 'witness' of the production team cadres, Da Zhi packed up and went to live in the dilapidated house of Gou Sheng. The two were considered married.In addition to the pair of Da Zhi and Gou Zuo, there were also four or five pairs of educated youth who also got married. There were also educated youths who got together with the villagers. Not many, only one man and one woman....The weather was blazing hot. The branches outside were motionless. Not a breeze of wind at all. The cicadas on the branches were annoying.It hadn't rained for almost a month. If it went on like this, the crops in the fields will die of thirst!Wang Shui Sheng organized villagers to fetch water from the river every day to irrigate the fields. But with so many fields to be irrigated, the villagers were so tired that they almost collapsed.Da Qiao came out from the stove room with a bowl of sweet potato ball sweet soup and put it in front of her mom, \"Mom, the sweet soup is ready. It's a bit hot. Wait for it to cool before eating.\"Lin Hui crookedly leaned on the kang. Her cheeks flushed from the heat: \"Da Qiao is too good. It's really thanks to your care that Mom has been able to live so well these days!\"Her belly was already nine months. Many people said twins will be born early. But there hadn't been any movement yet.She was exhausted from carrying such a big belly in this hot weather every day. Thankfully, Da Qiao took care of her.She was either cooking her delicious food, or massaging her swollen legs, or telling stories and sing to the younger siblings in the stomach. This child was so well-behaved and sensible that it made people's heart ached.Da Qiao smiled so much her eyes curved into crescent. She sweetly spoke, \"You are my mom. I love to take care of you!\"Hearing this, Lin Hui's heart melted: \"Good child, Mom is fine here. You can go out and play.\"Just as Da Qiao was about to shake her head, she heard her elder cousin brother calling her from outside. Lin Hui ushered her to go.Although her belly was big, it wasn't to the point where others needed to watch her every steps. What's more, she was in good health.Seeing her mom's good complexion, Da Qiao hesitated for a while before nodding and ran out.An Ping came over and asked Da Qiao to help her fry some cicadas. Although his eldest sister could make it, he always felt that the taste wasn't as good as Da Qiao's.Da Qiao naturally didn't refuse such a simple request. She let her mom know and went to the old house.As soon as Da Qiao left, a figure flashed by in the small courtyard and hollered inside: \"Your family's Dong Lin broke his leg halfway up the mountain. Quickly go and have a look!\"Shortly Pi Pi wildly barked.Lin Hui was so frightened that the old porcelain bowl in her hand almost fell to the ground. She went out with a pale face and found no one.Her heart was beating wildly as her brows furrowed.Because Da Qiao wanted to take care of her, little Dong Lin and little Yi Ming were both taken to the old house recently and wouldn't come back until evening.Logically speaking, Qiao Family's children would take good care of them. But both of them were at naughty and playful age. She was afraid that he would sneak out to play and fall.People would use this kind of thing as a joke.Thinking of this, she supported her waist and hurried towards the mountain's middle.After climbing halfway up the mountain, she heard the cry of a child in the grass. She became even more anxious. She stepped up her pace. Just as she called out 'Dong Lin', something knocked on the back of her head.Her vision darkened and she fainted....Da Qiao's heart was still worried about her mom. She hurried back after cooking the cicadas. When she returned to the small house, she found that her mom wasn't there.She searched every room, but found no one. Immediately, she went to search the surroundings. Still came up empty-handed.She thought that her mom might have gone to Lin's house. So she ran to Lin's house. Halfway, she was stopped by Huo Chi.Huo Chi noticed that her cheeks were flushed and head covered with sweat. He asked, \"What happened?\"Da Qiao took a deep breath and replied, \"My mom isn't at home. I'm going to Lin's house to see if she's there.\"Huo Chi thought for a moment and said, \"I'll go with you.\"Da Qiao nodded.The two came to Lin's house but were told that her mom had never been there.Then Da Qiao panicked: \"Mom isn't at home. She didn't go to the old house. Nor did she come here. Where could she go?\"Huo Chi comforted her, \"Maybe went to the field to deliver water to Granny Qiao and Grandpa Qiao?\"Da Qiao's eyes lit up: \"Brother Huochi, you are right, I'll go take a look now!\"Although Qiao Xiu Zhi told Lin Hui not to deliver water, Lin Hui felt guilt-stricken. She wasn't earning work points or doing housework. Worried about people's idle remarks, she would occasionally deliver water.This time Da Qiao was destined to be disappointed. Her mom hadn't sent water at all.Qiao Xiu Zhi saw her soaked in sweat, wiped her face with the face towel hanging around her own neck and spoke, \"What happened? Why did you come here?\"Da Qiao anxiously spoke, \"Grandmother, did my mom come to deliver water?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi froze and shook her head, \"No. Isn't your mom at home?\"Da Qiao was about to cry: \"No! I've searched everywhere. She's missing!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi's heart dropped, \"Good child. Don't be anxious. We'll go home and check where your mom may be? Maybe she's already home.\"When Qiao Family heard that Lin Hui was missing, they asked for leave to search for her.They searched everywhere they could and not a shadow of her could be found.Qiao Xiu Zhi realized that something was amiss. She immediately reported the matter to Wang Shui Sheng.Qiao Family was Wang Family's in-laws. What's more, Lin Hui was still pregnant. If something goes wrong, it will be one corpse and three lives!Wang Shui Sheng couldn't help trembling when he thought of this.He immediately called over a dozen villagers. Plus more than a dozen people from Qiao Family and Lin Family, they went to look for her together.But after searching for a long time, Lin Hui seemed to have evaporated from the world. She was nowhere to be seen.Everyone truly realized something was wrong!Qiao Family and Lin Family's mind became even more chaotic....Lin Hui didn't know how long she had been unconscious. When she woke up, she found herself in a cave.She was stunned for a long time before she remembered that she had been knocked on the back of her head before fainting.She reached out and touched it. The back of her head was painful and the blood had dried.Who did it?Where was this place?Why would the other party do this?Lin Hui pondered about it for a while. However, her brain hurt too much. The most important thing now was to leave this ghost place. She simply gave up up thinking and stood up slowly with the help of the cave wall.However, her feet only took a step, when footsteps sounded from outside.Thump, thump, thump!The sound seem as if knocked her heart. Lin Hui was so nervous that her whole heart was about to jump out.She wanted to bend down to pick up a stone to use as a weapon. However, her stomach was too big. It was very difficult to squat down. What's more, the pain in the back of her head was really bad. At any large movement, her vision went black for a while.At this time, a figure appeared at the black entrance of the cave.With the light behind to the other's back, Lin Hui couldn't see him clearly at first. She only felt that his figure was a little familiar. Soon, she knew who this person was.\"Oh, I didn't expect you to have a great fate. You woke up so quickly. What? Are you trying to escape?\" The man smirked.It was Fang Xiao Juan's elder brother, Fang Fu Gui!Lin Hui felt oppressed. Cautiously staring at him, she spoke, \"Fang Fu Gui, why did you bring me here?\"Fang Fu Gui walked in and jollily said: \"Lin Hui, Lin Hui. If you had obediently married me back then, you would had been fine now!\"Lin Hui sneered: \"If I had marry you, I estimate that my bones would have been turned to ashes! Just like your dead wife!\"Like a cat whose tail was stepped on, Fang Fu Gui instantly explode. He came over and slapped her.Lin Hui was slapped two steps back and slammed into the cave wall behind her. If she hadn't supported herself with the cave wall in time, she would have fallen to the ground!It was only then that Lin Hui realized that the person standing in front of her wasn't a human at all. He was a devil. A scum. At this time, she mustn't confront him head-on!Fang Fu Gui grinned, \"Go on, talk! Isn't your mouth very powerful? Why aren't you speaking now?\"Lin Hui suppressed her anger and disgust and slowly uttered, \"Fang Fu Gui, I have no grievances with you. As long as you let me go, I promise that after I go out, I will never report you!\"Fang Fu Gui laughed: \"You think I'm a fool? If I let you out, can I still live?\"Even if Lin Hui really keeps her promise not to report it, will Qiao Family and Lin Family let him go? Impossible!There was no turning back after the arrow was fired. So he must follow this through. Lin Hui was destined to die here!His eyes fell on her bulging belly. He felt it was a little unlucky in his heart. If it wasn't for her pregnancy, he would definitely have a good time before she died. He could only drop it now.Lin Hui saw him stare at her belly and instantly became vigilant. She covered her stomach with both hands and wanted to step back. But there was no path behind her.Fang Fu Gui walked to the entrance of the cave, picked up the wooden stick that was thrown there before, and quickly walked back. Looking at Lin Hui, he stated, \"If you want to blame, blame my younger sister, Fang Xiao Juan. It is her who made me kill you. Later, when you're a ghost, go find her!\"After he finished speaking, the wooden stick in his hand was lifted up before hitting Lin Hui on the head again!Lin Hui screamed and fell to the ground.Seeing Lin Hui lying on the pool of blood, Fang Fu Gui threw the stick to the ground, turned around, and walked away.This place was quite secretive. When someone finds it, she will be already dead.After he left, Lin Hui painfully and slowly opened her eyes.Her belly hurt so much. It seems the babies were about to come out!Just don't know if the two babies will be affected.Lin Hui laid in the pool of blood and numbingly thought.The pain in her belly kept coming. For fear that she would attract Fang Fu Gui back, she bit her lip to not make any sound,With a sudden slide from her lower body, a baby came out!She struggled to sit up. She picked up the baby and examined it. She cried.The baby was still alive!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She carefully wrapped the baby.As for the umbilical cord, there was no such condition to sort it now. She can only leave it like this. She only hoped that her family will find her quickly. Otherwise she and the baby will die here!Soon her belly hurt again. The second baby was coming out...At the same moment, everyone in the production team was looking for Lin Hui's whereabouts. Many villagers came out to help.Some people want to sell favor to Qiao Family, but more people didn't want to see an accident happen. After all, Lin Hui was pregnant with twins. If something goes wrong, it will be one corpse and three lives!Lin Hui had a gentle temperament. She never got into conflict with people. Nor did she like to gossip about people everywhere. On top of that, she was pretty. There were many people in the production team who have a good impression of her.But as time went by little by little, all the places that could be found were searched. There was no result on Lin Hui's whereabout. Everyone was sure that she had never left the production team at all.Because leaving the production team meant one had to pass through the farmland. Everyone was working in the fields during the time and didn't see her. If she went out, someone would definitely notice.So, where did Lin Hui go?Da Qiao's long and dense eyelashes trembled slightly and big tears fell: \"It's all my fault. If I kept guarding Mom, Mom wouldn't disappear!\"An Ping lowered his head and kicked the ground in frustration: \"It's nothing to do with Younger Sister Da Qiao. I asked Younger Sister Da Qiao go and fry some cicada for me!\"If he knew earlier, he would just let his eldest sister fry a plate for him. It wasn't inedible. Why did he ask Younger Sister Da Qiao to fry it for him?Qiao Dong Ying came over and slapped him on the forehead with: \"Since you know it's wrong, then make it right. Don't be so greedy in the future!\"After being beaten by his second elder sister, An Ping felt a little better: \"I know. Younger Sister Da Qiao, don't cry. Let's go bring Second Aunt back together!\"Seeing her son being beaten, Wan Chun Ju rushed over and wanted to pull Qiao Dong Ying's ear. However, the other party avoided her.Wan Chun Ju jumped with anger: \"You damn girl, how many times have I told you not to hit your brother on the head. Why can't you remember? Also, how can this be An Ping's fault. It's obviously...\"Qiao Dong Ying interrupted her mom coldly: \"Mom, if you dare to say anything displeasing, don't blame everyone for not helping you if something happens to you in the future!\"Most of the people who betrayed and abandoned by their relatives had caused it by themselves!Receiving a cool gaze from her second daughter, Wan Chun Ju subconsciously swallowed the words in her mouth and muttered: \"Dead girl, you're become more disrespectful...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi had got her eldest son to go to the production team office to borrow a phone to inform Qiao Zhen Jun to come back. It took two hours to get from the town to the production team. He would be back anytime soon.The sun slanted west. The setting sky was like a knocked-down orange juice; dyeing the entire western sky red.Wang Qiu Ying couldn't stand the blow and fell to the ground crying.Her son wanted to carry her back. However, she shook her head and refused to go back: \"My poor daughter, where are you?\"Just when everyone was in a stump, Da Qiao suddenly ran inside the room, took out the clothes her mom had worn, put it in front of Pi Pi, \"Pi Pi, smell it. It's Mom's smell. Help me find Mom. Please, I beg you!\"Before at Shen Family, she overheard Godfather tell someone that a well trained hounds can help the police solve cases. But before she could hear it all, she was pulled away by Younger Brother Tian You.She knew that Pi Pi hadn't been trained. Now there was no other way. She can only treat a dead horse like a living horse!When someone noticed Da Qiao's actions, they couldn't help shaking their heads sympathetically. They thought the child must have been frightened silly.After everyone searched for so long, they couldn't find Lin Hui. What can a beast do?But weird things happened in the next moment!They witnessed Pi Pi smell the clothes, barked at Da Qiao twice, and dashed towards the door. Then he stopped to wait for Da Qiao when he reached the door.Da Qiao quickly followed.Everyone was shocked. It can't be that this dog got intelligence?Seeing Da Qiao running with the dog, Qiao Xiu Zhi was the first to react and immediately followed. Soon more and more people followed.As Pi Pi ran, his nose sniffed on the ground. He ran halfway up the mountain.Halfway up the mountain, Pi Pi got faster and faster. Occasionally, he turned back and barked at Da Qiao.While everyone was curious, they believed the dog wouldn't be able to find anyone. After all, they had searched the mountainside a good few times before and came up empty!Pi Pi came to a grassy area halfway up the mountain and lingered there. Some of the people who came over couldn't help but sarcastically comment.\"I say, what can a beast do? Da Qiao is a child who doesn't understand anything. While you people act like you haven't seen the world before and follow like a swarm of bees!\"\"Pah. You have seen the world and you are noble. What are you doing here?\"\"That's right! But I don't think this dog can find anything. Everyone...\" let's go back.Before he finished speaking, he saw his Pi Pi wildly dashing again. This time in the direction of the East Wood's dense forest.The mountains in East Wood weren't high. Many mountain roads have been developed by villagers and many people come to pick wild vegetables every day.The whole East Wood wasn't like this.The deeper one goes in the East Wood, the more trees and bushes. At the end, they were all steep cliffs. So the villagers rarely went there.So when Pi Pi was running towards the dense forest in the East Wood everyone was shocked. Could it be that Lin Hui ran over there?It was just that there were so many trees in that place. The road wasn't easy to walk. Why would a big-bellied woman go there for?Unless...unless she didn't go over by herself!Thinking of this, many people's expression instantly changed and rushed to follow.Pi Pi picked up the pace and finally stopped in a row of one-person-high thickets.That thickets were covered with small spikes. If one want to force go through, they will definitely be stabbed!Everyone couldn't help but doubt again. Pi Pi circled around before running to the bush at the end and barked at a big rock.When everyone ran over, he clawed out the bush under the rock and exposed a hole below. Then he climbed in under the stone.It was only then that everyone discovered that there was a gap under the big rock for one person to pass through. No one had never been here before. Even if they had, they wouldn't crawl in when they saw the big stone in the way.Who knows if there was any road on the opposite side. Or if there were snakes and ants in this thicket?Da Qiao squatted down and was about to follow Pi Pi. However, she was halted by her grandmother. She looked at her grandmother in confusion.Qiao Xiu Zhi said: \"You stand aside. Grandmother will move the stone away!\"When everyone heard this, they couldn't help but take a deep breath.They knew that Qiao Xiu Zhi was strong, but that rock was too huge. It might weigh about four or five hundred jins, right?Can she do it?Xue Chuan was also a little worried about his wife. He walked over and said, \"Try it. If it's too heavy, don't force yourself.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded: \"Don't worry, I won't force myself!\"Wang Shui Sheng quickly asked everyone to go to one side and make room.Qiao Xiu Zhi walked up to the big rock, squatted down and hugged it. The rock was certainly heavy and not easy to hold.She tried a few times. Just when everyone thought that she would definitely not be able to lift the rock, she let out a low yell and lifted the big rock.\"My God, what did Auntie Xiu Zhi grow up on? This strength is really amazing!\"\"Yes, that's right. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would definitely not believe it!\"\"I didn't know until today that killing a wild boar weighing more than two hundred jins with one punch is nothing at all. See who will dare to speak ill of Qiao family in the future!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi threw the big rock one meter away. Four to five hundred jins was the limit of her strength. That's why, she didn't dare to carry it away.After the big rock was removed, everyone looked at it closely. A mountain road suddenly opened up in front of everyone. There were two obvious footprints on the mountain road.Qiao Family and Lin Family were the first to run over.Everyone wanted to follow, but was stopped by Wang Shui Sheng: \"Why are you going over for? Don't you see that the mountain road was so narrow? If there is any danger ahead, can you run?\"When everyone heard this, they rest their desire. No one went back though. They all waited outside with their necks stretched out....Before Qiao Xiu Zhi moved the stone, Pi Pi had reached the cave first.Lin Hui was lying on the ground with her two babies in her arms. Her head was feeling dizzy for a while. Just when she was about to faint, she saw Pi Pi appear at the entrance of the hole.\"Woof woof woof...\" Pi Pi flew over and licked her face.Lin Hui thought she was hallucinating at first. But when a damp touch appeared on her face, her eyes instantly lit up: \"Pi Pi...\"It was just that she was too tired. She lost too much blood and gave birth to two babies. Completely out of strength now.After a while, footsteps sounded from outside the cave. It was accompanied by Da Qiao's soft and smooth voice: \"Mom? Where are you, Mom?\"It was like the sound from heaven. Lin Hui's mouth moved slightly. Two lines of tears flowed down the corners of her eyes before she closed her eyes.She could finally faint with eased mind.Qiao Xiu Zhi was the first to arrive at the cave with Da Qiao in her arms. Before she entered, a smell of blood hit the nose.She strode in and put her finger under Lin Hui's nose to probe.Fortunately, she was still breathing!Although the breathing was very weak, she was alive.Immediately afterwards, her eyes fell on the two babies in Lin Hui's arms.The two babies were asleep and tightly cuddled together. But because they hadn't been cleaned, the two babies looked a little terrible.Da Qiao struggled and jump down from her grandmother's arms. Running over, she sobbed: \"Mom! Mom, don't die!\"At the same time, she swiftly called for the koi jade pendant. Then she dug out two jade beads and stuffed them into her mom's mouth.When Qiao Xiu Zhi saw this scene, she completely froze!She just saw a jade pendant appeared in Da Qiao's palm!How could this jade pendant appear out of thin air?Where did this jade pendant come from?What did Da Qiao go through before?There were countless question marks in Qiao Xiu Zhi's mind. But the most important thing now was to stop others from entering.She didn't say or ask anything. Just turned around, walked to the entrance of the cave, and blocked Qiao and Lin Family who were about to come in.Lin Hui's Eldest Sister-in-law, Yuan Su Hua, ran over. She panted, \"Auntie Xiu Zhi, is Youngest Sister Hui Hui inside?\"\"She's inside.\" Qiao Xiu Zhi nodded. After answering, she ignored everyone's words. She looked at Lin Hui's eldest brother and stated, \"Take off your clothes and give it to me.\"Lin Hui's elder brother Lin Feng was stunned: \"Auntie Xiu Zhi, what do you want clothes for?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi responded, \"Lin Hui gave birth ahead of schedule. She used her clothes for the babies. If you don't take it off, do you want her to go out naked?\"Qiao Zhen Jun wasn't here. Otherwise, it would be the most suitable for him to take off his clothes.Only then did Lin Feng regained his wits. He stretched out his hand to unbutton his clothes and hand them over.At this moment, footsteps came from behind. Everyone turned to look and found Qiao Zhen Jun running over dripping with sweat.\"Mom, Hui Hui... how is she?\"At the time, he got a call from the production team in the factory and his heart almost stopped beating!After putting down the phone, he hurriedly asked the factory for leave. The factory manager asked the driver in the factory to take him back when he knew that there was a mishap at home. Otherwise he wouldn't be able to come here so quickly.\"She's still alive, but had shed a lot of blood. Since you are here, quickly take off your clothes. I will take them in and put them on for your wife. You block the hole!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi found her second son's early arrival a bit odd. But now was not the time to ask about these things.Qiao Zhen Jun hurriedly nodded. He stretched out his hand to block the entrance of the cave.The men outside consciously retreated one meter away. While Elder Sister-in-law Lin wanted to go in, but was stopped by Qiao Zhen Jun.Eldest Sister-in-law Lin couldn't understand. She was a woman. Why stop her too?But at this time, she didn't dare to cause trouble to everyone. After thinking about it, she stood aside and waited.Qiao Xiu Zhi went in, carefully picked up the two babies from Lin Hui's arms, and handed them to Da Qiao, \"Can you hold them?\"Da Qiao sat on the ground and spoke, \"Grandmother, give me younger brothers.\"She was very strong, so holding two babies wasn't a problem at all. However, her had short hands!There was undried blood and amniotic fluid from the childbirth on the ground. It was very dirty. Da Qiao didn't care though.Qiao Xiu Zhi's heart softened and she put the two babies on her lap.Da Qiao hugged her two soft younger brothers. When she looked closely, a thought flashed in her mind... Younger brothers were so ugly!They looked like two little old men. What's more, there were white things on their heads and faces.Younger brothers were so ugly. What to do once they grow up?It seem that she will have to work harder to make money in the future. Not only do she have to buy a big house for her grandparents, but also make more money for her younger brothers!Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't know about Da Qiao's 'sorrow'. She turned around to bandage Lin Hui's wound first.Although the blood on her head had dried up, she was afraid that she would make too much movement when she went out and cause the wound to be pulled. That's why a secure bandage was needed.Don't know if she was seeing things. She felt that Second Daughter-in-law's complexion was much better than before. When she came in just now, Lin Hui's complexion was so pale that it seem a few degree whiter than paper!After bandaging, she put her hand under Lin Hui's nose again. Sure enough, it wasn't her illusion.Lin Hui's breath was very weak earlier. Now her breath was steady. If it wasn't for the blood on the ground and the wound on her head, she would have suspected that she had just falling asleep.It seemed that the jade pendant that emerged from Da Qiao's palm played a key part. When she came back, the jade pendant in Da Qiao's hand had disappeared.She still didn't ask Da Qiao. After helping Lin Hui get dressed, she got Qiao Zhen Jun to come in: \"Hurry up and take your wife out.\"When Qiao Zhen Jun saw Lin Hui covered in blood, his heart felt like it had been stabbed with a knife. His eyes suddenly turned red: \"Hui Hui...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi calmly interrupted his deep feeling: \"Okay. I don't care how you cry later. Right now, quickly send your wife to the hospital!\"Qiao Zhen Jun: \"...\"He carried his wife, turned around, and strode out. He never noticed Da Qiao sitting on the ground and the two babies in her arms.Eldest Sister-in-law Lin had followed in and saw the babies in Da Qiao's arms at a glance. She exclaimed: \"My goddess, to give birth to a child in such a place. If my mother-in-law sees it, who knows how long she will cry! \"Qiao Xiu Zhi wrapped one of the babies with the leftover cloth that Lin Hui have torn out earlier and handed it to Eldest Sister-in-law Lin.She carried the other baby and led Da Qiao out of the cave.When the production team saw Qiao Zhen Min come out with Lin Hui in his arms, they were shocked still!Qiao Family and Lin Family had been in there for so long. They had already guessed that Lin Hui was inside, but they couldn't be sure as they didn't see her.Now they saw her. Lin Hui was covered in blood. The current atmosphere immediately exploded.\"My god, old Second Qiao's wife was really inside!\"\"Oh, old Second Qiao's wife is covered in blood. It can't be she's already...\"\"It shouldn't be. If that's the case, how could old Second Qiao have that expression?\"Some people recalled Lin Hui's disheveled appearance. Could it be someone had dragged her here to do that thing?But because in front of Qiao Zhen Jun, no one dared to say it.When they saw Qiao Xiu Zhi and Eldest Sister-in-law Lin come out with the babies, no one thought that anymore. It turned out that she had delivered!That's right. They were so shocked just now that they didn't realize that Lin Hui's belly was much smaller!Down the mountain, the factory's driver was still waiting.Earlier, Qiao Zhen Jun gave the other party two yuan and asked him to wait for him.The driver considered how he had nothing to do when he went back to the factory as well as Qiao Zhen Jun having a connection with the factory manager. If he helped the other party, it would be selling a favor to the factory manager. After pushing around, he only accepted one yuan in the end.Seeing Qiao Zhen Jun walking over with a pale-faced woman, he immediately got out of the vehicle: \"Old Younger Brother Qiao, what's going on?\"\"Elder Brother Huang, my wife hit her head and gave birth ahead of schedule. I need to take her to the hospital as soon as possible!\"Qiao Zhen Jun explained, but didn't intend to tell the truth of the matter to the other party.Qiao Xiu Zhi came down with the baby in her arms. She was relieved to see that her second son knew how to make the driver wait here.It seem going to work in the factory was still useful. Second Son was much smarter than before.She had heard what he said just now. Wonderful job!Although Lin Hui hadn't suffered that, it was better that less people know about this kind of thing.People's imaginations were rich. Who knows what kind of things will eventually spread?The driver drove a truck, which could fit four or five people. In the end, Qiao Zhen Jun held Lin Hui, Qiao Xiu Zhi and Eldest Sister-in-law Lin each held a baby. Da Qiao managed to squeeze in.The villagers watched Qiao Family go to the town hospital and went back to cook after a round of discussion.Once Wang Qiu Ying knew that her daughter had been found and that she had given birth in the cave, she sobbed again. Afterward, she wiped away her tears and ran to Qiao's house and asked Qiao Zhen Guo to take her to the hospital.Xue Chuan persuaded her to prepare the food and go tomorrow. It was too late and dangerous now. Going over empty-handed past wouldn't do much help.Wang Qiu Ying gave up the idea....Before they got to the hospital, Lin Hui woke up.Seeing Qiao Zhen Jun, her tears fell on the spot.Qiao Zhen Jun clumsily wiped her tears with his hands, feeling extremely distressed: \"Hui Hui, don't cry. Do you feel pain any where?\"Lin Hui cried so hard that she couldn't speak. Just latched onto Qiao Zhen Jun's hand and shed tears.Eldest Sister-in-law Lin family couldn't help tear up when she saw her sister-in-law like this.Da Qiao followed along and spilled big gold beads: \"Mom, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left you!\"Lin Hui stopped crying when she heard Da Qiao's voice: \"Good child. It's not your fault... Don't worry. Mom is fine.\"She wasn't completely lying to the child.Before she fell into unconsciousness, she was completely weak. Her head ached, while lower body was in pain. Basically, everywhere in her body hurt. Once she woke up, all these pains disappeared!The reason why she cried like that just now was not because of pain, but because of grievance and fear.She originally thought that she and her two babies were going to die in the cave. Never thought everyone would come over so quickly.After the catastrophe, she couldn't help crying.Because there was a driver, no one asked Lin Hui what was going on. Once they got out of the vehicle, Qiao Xiu Zhi asked her what had happened.Lin Hui gritted his teeth and told, \"It's Fang Fu Gui. He said Fang Xiao Juan told him to kill me!\"Eldest Sister-in-law Lin was furious: \"Those Fang Family beasts. From old to young, not one of them are no good things! Animals like them should go to eighteen levels of hell after death!\"Qiao Zhen Jun was also mad: \"Hui Hui, don't worry. I will definitely seek justice for you!\"Even if he had to fight with his life with Fang Fu Gui, he had to get justice back for his wife!Qiao Xiu Zhi remained silent. She led everyone into the hospital and asked the doctor to examine Lin Hui and the two babies.After some inspection, Lin Hui had one blow on the back of her head and one on the forehead. Judging from the wounds, there should had been a lot of blood loss. The patient's face was so rosy that the doctor found it strange!In the end, the doctor asked the nurse to clean the wound for her and then stitched it up. As for the two babies, they were taken to the obstetrics and gynecology department to be cleaned.Because of the previous incident, Qiao Xiu Zhi and Eldest Sister-in-law Lin followed the babies this time; never taking their eyes off them for a moment.The hospital's equipment were currently poor. After the babies' examination, no major problems were found for the time being. Just that one baby was sturdy, while the other was slightly thinner and weaker.The doctor told them to pay more attention to the thinner baby, otherwise it might not be able to survive.Eldest Sister-in-law Lin looked at the baby and couldn't help but wipe away her tears.After Lin Hui got her wound bandaged, she immediately went to look for her two babies, especially the youngest son. He was so thin and weak that he seemed to be dead when he was just born.Later, she resolutely hung the child upside down and patted his butt a few times. Only then, he cried. Still, his voice was as weak as a kitten. It made people feel very distressed.When Da Qiao saw her younger brothers after washing, she felt that the younger brothers didn't seem so ugly anymore.After settling in, Qiao Xiu Zhi immediately went out to make a phone call. The first call went to the production team.Wang Shui Sheng didn't go home after going down the mountain. He stayed in the office all the time. He had a hunch that Qiao Xiu Zhi would call.After waiting for two hours, he finally got it.Qiao Xiu Zhi told Wang Shui Sheng what Lin Hui said and asked him to immediately go to Fang's house and arrest all three of Fang Family.Wang Shui Sheng agreed.After putting down the phone, he went to find other cadres and some strong young men in the village. Everyone quietly came to Fang's house.The door of the Fang's courtyard was locked. They didn't give them notice and forced their way in. Without any hesitation, the family was captured!Old woman Fang screamed, \"What are you doing? Robbers, robbery, murder... woo woo...\"Wang Shui Sheng took off his shoe and stuffed it into her mouth!Old woman Fang couldn't call out!Fang Fu Gui wanted to flip over the wall when they broke in. However, Wang Shui Sheng was well prepared and had people wait outside.So as soon as he climbed the wall and flipped over, he was caught.After Qiao Xiu Zhi put down the phone, the second call made was to Shen's house.If Fang Xiao Juan didn't seek death herself and properly be her official's wife in Hu City, she would definitely not do anything to her. But if she wanted to stir trouble, she was going to fixed her to her spot!Never let her be able to turn around!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 93": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 93Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShen Family received a call from Qiao Xiu Zhi and immediately drove the car to the hospital. Shen Tian You hadn't slept yet. Originally, he wanted to follow, but Shen Shi Kai didn't agree.Shen Family's two elderly didn't want the child to go to a place like the hospital at this time of the day. So they persuaded him to stay.When Qin Xiao Mei walked in hand-in-hand with Da Qiao, Lin Hui was holding the baby as she wiped her tears.Twins usually have a situation where one child was better nourished, and the other child was less nourished. The one with poor nutrition will be relatively weaker. She never thought that the younger son would be this weak!She felt that her younger son was like this because she was frightened, stumbled around, and caused too much blood loss. Under normal circumstances, they would have to wait another half a month before they were birthed. Now they were forced to come out ahead of schedule.She hugged her young son tightly; feeling so guilty. Qiao Zhen Jun anxiously comforted her.Before Qin Xiao Mei could speak, Da Qiao let go of her hand and ran over.Da Qiao climbed into bed, wiped her mom's tears, and said, \"Mom, don't cry. Grandmother said that you can't shed tears during confinement.\"Lin Hui squeezed out a smile: \"Good child. Mom won't cry.\"No one told Da Qiao about the baby's feebleness. After all, she was still a child. It was useless to tell her. The reason why Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't say anything was because she had too many things to do.Da Qiao hadn't fed jade beads to her younger brothers in the cave before because she was afraid that her younger brothers would be too young to feed too much at once.But now she saw her mom crying, she turned her gaze at the thin small younger brother in her mom's arms. Right then, she seemed to understand something.She reached out and rubbed her younger brother's wrinkled face and assured, \"Mom, don't worry. Younger Brother will be fine. I will take care of Younger Brother in the future!\"Lin Hui's eyes turned red again when she heard the child's thoughtful and sensible words.Qin Xiao Mei came over, took out the handkerchief, and wiped her tears, \"You can't shed tears in confinement. Look, Da Qiao is more sensible than you!\"Lin Hui took the handkerchief and wiped her tears, and said a little embarrassedly, \"Elder Sister Xiao Mei, it's so late. Why did you come back?\"Qin Xiao Mei angrily responded, \"How could we not come when such a big thing happened?\"Once her voice fell, Qiao Xiu Zhi and Shen Shi Kai walked in.Qiao Xiu Zhi spoke, \"Second Daughter-in-law, tell Shi Kai the whole thing!\"Lin Hui nodded: \"It's my fault. It's because I was too stupid. I was drinking sweet soup when I heard someone shouting toward the house. Saying, Dong Lin broke his leg halfway up the mountain. In a panic, I ran over.\"She had heard people say that once one was pregnant, they'll be stupid for three years. She hadn't believe it. Because when she was pregnant with Dong Lin, she still got her wits together.Since she was pregnant with twins, her brain wasn't as good as when she was younger despite her good health.At that time, when she heard Dong Lin broke his leg, she was so anxious. She was worried that the child would be afraid and wanted to fly to the child immediately.Qin Xiao Mei comforted: \"Don't blame yourself. One would never think that people's hearts are so wicked!\"Lin Hui sighed: \"I thought the same thing with you at the time. I didn't see anyone when I came out and wondered if someone was playing a prank. But after thinking about it, people in the village just like to gossip. They would never joke about this kind of thing or play trick.\"Lin Hui's words weren't to justify herself.Though the villagers may get into conflict over a green onion or a chicken and wish to kill each other on the spot, no one will say such words to mess with the other party.This kind of lie was very easy to expose. Once it is discovered such a thing hasn't happened, it is equivalent to cursing the other party. Can the other party just let it go?Lin Hui thought of this at the time and felt no one would joke around. On top of that, she was too anxious. So she didn't consider going to the old house to confirm it.Who knew, people were sinister. And she suffered because of her carelessness!Lin Hui sighed and continued: \"I went halfway up the mountain and heard a child crying. I thought it was Dong Lin. Now that I think about it, that voice doesn't really sound like Dong Lin. I was too anxious at the time. I didn't pay attention to it and just walked over. I was knocked unconscious as soon as I walked over. After I woke up, I was in the cave. Then Fang Fu Gui came...\"After hearing Lin Hui's words, Qin Xiao Mei covered her chest and repeatedly exclaimed: \"Oh my god. I heard Auntie Xiu Zhi's recount and was already scared witless. Once I think of what you have experienced in person, I can't wait to kill those beasts Fang Family!\"Qiao Zhen Jun had heard his wife say it once before. Now when he heard it again, he was still very furious. At the same time he was very distressed.He carried youngest son from his wife's arms and took the opportunity to comfort his wife with his gaze.Qin Xiao Mei pretended not to see the interaction between the two of them and turned around and asked her husband, \"I'm a little confused. Why Fang Fu Gui spent so much time trying to get her to the cave and didn't do something ruthless?\"After speaking, she suddenly felt that her words were ambiguous, as if she wished Lin Hui had met with mishap.She quickly turned around and explained, \"Hui Hui, don't think too much. What I said just now didn't mean I wish something happened to you. I just can't understand.\"Lin Hui sent a thoughtful smile, \"Elder Sister Xiao Mei, don't worry. I won't think that. In fact, it's not just you. Even I don't understand.\"When she saw Fang Fu Gui coming in with a wooden stick, she thought she would be dead. Surprisingly, he only hit her and left.At that time, she pretended to be dead and didn't make a sound. Fang Fu Gui should be able to tell that she was still alive. So why didn't he give the killing shot?Of course, she would never think that the other party was too kind and wanted to leave a way out for her.After thinking about it, everyone couldn't grasp it. After all, the other party was a psycho beast. His thought couldn't be understood by normal people.Shen Shi Kai spoke, \"Auntie Xiu Zhi, what are you going to do about this?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at Da Qiao: \"When owing the debt, pay the money. Since they did such a vicious thing, they must be sent to the cell!\"After she finished speaking, she walked to Da Qiao's side, rubbed her hair, and said, \"Good child, your biological mom had done something bad. So Grandmother is going to call the police and make her receive the punishment she deserves. Do you understand Grandmother's action?\"Da Qiao blinked her big eyes and nodded her little head: \"I can. She is a bad person. I don't like her!\"From the initial admiration to the later indifference, to the current dislike. Fang Xiao Juan reaped what she sowed.Lin Hui took the child into her arms and kissed her forehead, \"Mom love you.\"Da Qiao raised her head and kissed her back. She sweetly responded: \"I also love Mom. Super love. More than liking Dad!\"Qiao Zhen Jun, who was suddenly received a shot: \"...\"Seeing Qiao Zhen Jun's aggrieved look, Qin Xiao Mei couldn't help burst into a chuckle. Then she make her face sullen: \"What about me? Doesn't Da Qiao love Godmother?\"Da Qiao rushed over, kissed her twice on the face, and softly declared, \"I do. I love godmother.\"Qin Xiao Mei smiled again. She hugged and showered her with kisses.With such interaction, the sad atmosphere suddenly dissipated a lot.Shen Shi Kai coughed twice and pulled everyone's attention back, \"If you want to cleanly send Fang Family into the cell, then Fang Fu Gui's side need to speak.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi sneered: \"Don't worry. Fang Family has no sibling-affection. Within three days, Fang Fu Gui will definitely confess!\"In any case, Fang Xiao Juan and Fang Family were going to be sent to the cell. The only trouble was... Xiao Qiao.If Fang Xiao Juan was sent to prison, how could Meng Hong Guang, an outsider, adopt Xiao Qiao? Xiao Qiao would definitely be sent back.Thinking of petty troublemaker Xiao Qiao, she couldn't help frowning....Qiao Xiu Zhi had said Fang Fu Gui will definitely confess the truth in three days. She had thought too highly of him!The day after being taken to the town police station, Fang Fu Gui confessed everything.From his confession, it was learned that he received an express post letter from Fang Xiao Juan. She requested him to kill Lin Hui. There was 100 yuan in the envelope. She stated that she would give him another 100 yuan after the matter was completed.Killing a person and he can earn two hundred yuan! He will definitely agree!It was just killing a person. In Fang Fu Gui's mind, it was no big deal.As for not killing Lin Hui all at once. He deeply regretted this until his bowels were green.He knocked Lin Hui hard that day and saw her lying on a pool of blood. He naturally knew that she wasn't dead yet. He originally thought that the cave was so secretive that no one would find it.So he didn't need to completely kill Lin Hui. She would die of excessive blood-loss. He liked to watch a person or an animal being slowly tortured to death.Usually, he liked to catch birds or mice and bake them alive on the fire. Seeing them squeak in pain, he felt extremely thrilled.If it wasn't for the fear that the production team would find out that he wasn't at home, he would definitely stay in the cave and slowly appreciate Lin Hui's dying appearance.He never thought Lin Hui would have strong life or that Qiao Family's animal to be able to find the cave!When the police officers at the police station heard Fang Fu Gui's confession, they all uttered 'psycho'!What made them even more stunned was that in addition to a big psycho like Fang Fugui, Fang Family actually had a small psycho, Fang You Liang.Fang You Liang was the one who led Lin Hui out that day. He was also the one who hid in the grass and pretended to be a crying child.Like Fang Fu Gui, he also liked to catch and torture animals. But instead of burning them to death, he skinned them alive!Some police officers couldn't help but vomit!During the interrogation, it was pulled out of Fang You Liang. It was he who pushed his younger brother Fang You Rou into the river. When Fang You Rou was struggling in the river, he enjoyed it for a while on the bank. If he wasn't afraid of people catching him on the act, he would watch the whole thing!As for old woman Fang. Although she didn't directly participate in the case, she committed the crime of shielding. She shielded the grandson of Fang You Liang before. This time she shielded her son Fang Fu Gui.When the production team was searching for Lin Hui, both Qiao Family and Lin Family suspected the Fang Family. However, old woman Fang insisted that her son had never left the house and even took the initiative to let them search the house.Because no evidence was found, everyone could do nothing to them. Who would have thought that Fang Fu Gui would actually hide people in the dense woods!With these confessions, Fang Fu Gui and Fang You Liang will definitely not be able to live.It was just that they can't be shot yet. They still have to be witnesses to take down Xiao Juan.As for old woman Fang. Although she won't be executed, she will definitely be locked up for a good few years. Her son and grandson were going to die though. Just don't know, if she can withstand this blow?Shen Shi Kai took Fang Fu Gui's confession to apply with his superiors to hunt down Fang Xiao Juan in Hu City. After the approval, he personally rushed to the Hu City with two police officers.When he raided Fang Xiao Juan with the police from Hu City, she wasn't at Meng's house. Instead, was at Deputy Director Liang's house. At that time, Fang Xiao Juan was hanging on the head of the bed with her hands and feet tied. The scene was so eye-piercing that everyone wanted to change their eyes!On that day, Fang Xiao Juan wasn't the only being taken away. Deputy Director Liang and Meng Hong Guang were also taken away.Hu City's police station had long received reports on Deputy Director Liang, but there was insufficient evidence. On top of that, there was someone behind Deputy Director Liang who was protecting him. They couldn't do anything about him for a while.But this time, he was caught in an affair. With so many eyes watching, the people behind him couldn't save him even if he wanted to!In fact, if Fang Xiao Juan was willing to admit that it was consensual, Deputy Director Liang and Meng Hong Guang still have a glimmer of hope.But the problem was that Fang Xiao Juan was unwilling. She said that she was tricked over by Meng Hong Guang and Deputy Director Liang forced her. If she didn't agree, they would kill her!Yes, Fang Xiao Juan hated Lin Hui and Qiao family. But she also hated Meng Hong Guang and Deputy Director Liang.Now that she was going to be executed, why should these people live so well in the world. They should go to hell with her!With Fang Xiao Juan's confession, the investigation of the case went smoothly.In fact, this was not the first time Meng Hong Guang had been a pimp for Deputy Director Liang. His previous wife died at such a young age, not because of illness or accident, but because she couldn't bear it anymore and committed suicide!His wife's family had suspected something, but there was no evidence. Their power wasn't comparable to others, so they could only swallow it up.Now the police found them, they expressed their willingness to testify on the spot.If they didn\u2019t investigated, they won't have known Now they did, everyone was shocked!There were at least ten women who have been abused by Deputy Director Liang since he was young. Some of them were from other places. Some women were strong-willed and survived. But most of them can't bear it and committed suicide or went crazy!Hell was empty as the devil was in the world!The crimes committed by Deputy Director Liang were simply too numerous to list!Before Shen Shi Kai left, Deputy Director Liang was already shot!And Meng Hong Guang? Why did he give himself a green hat again and again? Could it be that he had a green hat complex?Meng Hong Guang didn't have cuckold complex. He was a ruthless man though. In order to climb up, he handed his wife to his superiors twice.In fact, if he can put this ruthlessness on the right path and endure for a few more years, there may be a way up. Unfortunately, he didn't want to wait. His whole was on taking shortcuts.He didn't really care about wearing a green hat, because he didn't have much interest in adult women. For him, what attracted him the most were little girls like Xiao Qiao.Originally, he wanted Fang Xiao Juan to bring her other daughter too. When the time comes, he'll do a pair of twins. What a thrilling feeling it'll be. Unfortunately only one came in the end!One wasn't bad. After sending Fang Xiao Juan to Deputy Director Liang's bed, he sent his mom and son to relatives' house. Afterward, he prepared to attack Xiao Qiao.It was just that before he could take action, Xiao Qiao found out and had escaped. After that, the police came and he was taken to the police station.After some interrogation, Meng Hong Guang was also sentenced to death as an accomplice.Before Shen Shi Kai left Hu City, he asked him about Xiao Qiao's whereabouts. Unfortunately he didn't know either.Shen Shi Kai had to ask Hu City's police to help him find her. After a few days of searching, Xiao Qiao seemed to have evaporated from the world. There was no news at all.He couldn't stay in Hu City forever to search for her. He could only ask the police officers here to help keep an eye out. Then he and two other police officers escorted Fang Xiao Juan out of Hu City....Fang Xiao Juan, as one of the principal offenders, was also sentenced to death. Before the execution, she asked to see Qiao Xiu Zhi.Yes, not Qiao Zhen Jun, nor her daughter, Da Qiao. But her ex-mother-in-law, Qiao Xiu Zhi.After thinking about it, Qiao Xiu Zhi went to see Fang Xiao Juan.Although Qiao Xiu Zhi was mentally prepared, she couldn't help being stunned when she saw Fang Xiao Juan's appearance.Fang Xiao Juan was too thin. Her cheeks were sunken, her hair was messy like a chicken coop, and her face was covered with all kinds of bruises.\"Mom, you're finally here! I thought you wouldn't see me!\"Excited, Fang Xiao Juan wanted to stand up, but was restrained by the prison guard behind her.When Qiao Xiu Zhi heard the way she addressed her, she wanted to roll her eyes: \"Your mom is in prison. If you want to call that, call me all you like later. Since you you want me to come, say what you have to say!\"Fang Xiao Juan wasn't mad. Instead, she turned her head and glanced at the prison guard.The prison guard had already received a head up from the deputy chief. He walked out without Qiao Xiu Zhi asking. He didn't go far though.Otherwise, when something happen, that will be his responsibility!As soon as the prison guard left, Fang Xiao Juan couldn't wait to blurt out, \"Mom... Auntie Xiu Zhi, I'll say it straight out. I want to make a deal with you!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi snorted: \"With they way you are now, what qualifications do you think you have to make conditions with me!\"Fang Xiao Juan was choked for a moment and gritted her teeth: \"Auntie Xiu Zhi, I advise you not to be overconfident. If you reject me today, you will definitely regret it!\"When Qiao Xiu Zhi heard this, she couldn't be bothered to waste her time. She stood up to leave.Qiao Xiu Zhi's reaction was out of Fang Xiao Juan's expectation and hurriedly shouted: \"In March next year, Xue Chuan will die of illness!\"Although Qiao Xiu Zhi got supernatural strength, she would never use this to bully others. But at this moment, she couldn't hold back and nor she did want to!She walked over, grabbed Fang Xiao Juan's neck, and lifted her up, \"There are two kinds of people I despise the most in my life. One who always feel that it is someone else's fault and never reflect on themselves. The other, who continuously seek death. You are both!\"Xue Chuan was her weakness. Not a words of bad of him were allowed!When Fang Xiao Juan saw Qiao Xiu Zhi walking towards her, she regretted it. But she was strangled before she could speak!Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't really plan to strangle her to death. Seeing that she was strangled until wheezing, she threw her to the ground: \"If you dare to talk nonsense again, I'll send you to eat a gun immediately!\"Fang Xiao Juan sat on the ground panting: \"I wasn't curse... What I said is true! I know what will happen in the future...\"\"You have truly gone crazy!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi felt coming to see Fang Xiao Juan was a mistake from the beginning. She sneered and turned around again to leave.But then she heard Fang Xiao Juan continued: \"I'm not crazy! I lived once. Last life, I never divorced Qiao Zhen Jun. That's right, your Hong Mei will be pushed into the river by her man and die in a month. Just wait another month and you can verify my words. Then you can go to the deputy chief and ask him not to shoot me. As long as I live, I can tell you what will happen in the future!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi sent her a condescending gaze and laughed: \"You probably don't know. Hong Mei is not from our Qiao Family. So what does it have to do with me if she will die?\"Fang Xiao Juan was stunned: \"Hong Mei is not you and Xue Chuan's daughter? How is it possible? Nothing like this happened in my last life!\"When Qiao Xiu Zhi heard her mumbling, she became more and more convinced that she was talking nonsense.Fang Xiao Juan continued: \"What I say is true. Xiao Qiao was a fool in her last life. She reborn again in this life. While Da Qiao, she was never as good-looking or as smart as she is now in her last life!\"Hearing her mention of Da Qiao and Xiao Qiao, Qiao Xiu Zhi felt her heart thump. Still, she didn't stop.A wave of despair shrouded Fang Xiao Juan. She crawled up and chased to catch up. However, the prison guard came in!After Qiao Xiu Zhi went out, she went to Shen Shi Kai to ask about Xiao Qiao.Shen Shi Kai said that there was still no news from Hu City. And Meng Hong Guang's mom didn't take Xiao Qiao away.They have investigated. Xiao Qiao disappeared on the day Meng Hong Guang was arrested. If there was no news, it was very likely that she was kidnapped by kidnappers.Qiao Xiu Zhi didn't think so.If it was an ordinary child, it was indeed possible to be kidnapped by kidnappers. But with Xiao Qiao's scheming heart, she wasn't like a seven-year-old child. Thinking of what Fang Xiao Juan said just now, she feels that the possibility was very small.After thanking Shen Shi Kai, Qiao Xiu Zhi returned home.Fang Xiao Juan was originally sentenced to one month before being shot. However, she sought death. She told the prison guard that she knew what was going to happen in the future. In 1976, three important figures in the country would die.When she said the three names, the prison guard turned pale with fright, and immediately went out and reported it to his leader.After Chief Zheng and Shen Shi Kai found out, their expressions were also ugly. After reporting it to higher-ups, Fang Xiao Juan got gun execution!How can she not be shot?Once words get out, the entire police station can forget about living!Fang Xiao Juan never imagined that what she thought would become her invincible magic weapon ended up killing her!After Fang Xiao Juan was shot, Fang Fu Gui and Fang You Liang followed after. Once old woman Fang found out in prison, she went crazy.Fang Fu Gui's daughter, who was less than two years old, was sent to the orphanage.What happened to Fang Family made people sigh and lament. A good family end up like this.But who was to blame?They had a good life and chose to do illegal things. In the end, they reaped what they sowed. They deserved everything!Just like what Qiao Xiu Zhi said, Fang Xiao Juan held a good hand of card at first. But she kept seeking trouble. One marriage, two marriages, three marriages. The more she married, the worse she end up!She was used by Meng Hong Guang and given to his perverted superior. Was this Lin Hui's fault?Of course not!Step by step, she chose all by herself!If it wasn't for her greed for vanity, she would have rejected Meng Hong Guang long ago. One side she wanted benefits, and the other she felt that others were hurting her. In conclusion, others were at fault!There was no news of Xiao Qiao for a long time. Finally everyone believed that she was abducted by a kidnapper.In midst of all kinds of discussions, Qiao Family's twins reached one month.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 94": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the blink of an eye, it was early autumn. The autumn fierce sun doesn't lose blazing high summer sun. The high temperature was domineering and strong. Simply unbearable.The cicada on the tree continued to fret about during the countdown of their life.The sun was full of sunlight outside. The bright light cast mottled shadows on the ground through the window. Inside, there were two identical little dumplings lying on the kang.Not only did the two little dumplings look alike, but also wore exactly the same clothes. If they weren't familiar with them, they will definitely not be able to tell which was the older brother and which was the younger brother.At this moment, the two brothers were sleeping soundly with their head to head and their belly bulging Such a cute sight softened one's heart.Suddenly, a black thing rolled over from one side of the kang to the other like a ball. It was about to hit the two little dumplings.Right then, a pair of hands reached out and hugged the little black thing. A soft voice spoke, \"Younger Sister Yun Yun, that's being naughty!\"Charcoal little Dong Yun gave Da Qiao a toothless smile. She waved her small fists and yelled: \"Oh oh oh...\"\"Got to be quiet. Younger brothers are sleeping. Don't wake them up!\" Da Qiao coaxed her.Little Dong Yun continued to uttered, \"Oh oh oh\".An Ping walked in. Glancing from and to between Da Qiao and little Dong Yun, he finally sighed: \"Little Sister is so ugly. She will definitely not be able to marry in the future!\"Da Qiao:\"\u2026\u2026\"Although Da Qiao felt that it wasn't good for her elder cousin brother to say this, little Dong Yun was certainly not pretty. Mainly because she looked too much like Eldest Aunt.She had secretly fed her jade bead water, but for some reason, it had no effect on little Dong Yun. However, her health was superb. She had never been sick once since she was born.Qiao Dong Ying walked in and took ugly sister into her arm, \"If Mom hears what you say, she will jump around again!\"Wan Chun Ju placed too much hope on her little daughter. She couldn't allow others to say that her little daughter wasn't pretty. One time Song Jin Lai's wife remarked in front of her that little Dong Yun was ugly. Afterward...she lost a tooth.An Ping scratched his head and jollily spoke, \"Mom won't hit me. What's more, I'm telling the truth. Little Sister really looks like Mom. Dark and ugly. Dad said it was because Mom always go to the pig sty and roll in pig poop when she was pregnant with little Sister. That's why little Sister got this pig appearance!\"Da Qiao and Qiao Dong Ying: \"...\"\"Pfft...\"Suddenly there was a crisp laugh outside.A few people turned to look and found Qin Xiao Mei standing at the door. Her smile was from ear tot ear. Apparently, she heard what An Ping just said.Da Qiao rushed over in delight: \"Godmother!\"Qin Xiao Mei hugged her and landed several kisses on her tender little cheek: \"Godmother's little darling, why are getting prettier recently?\"Da Qiao hugged her godmother and kissed back a few times. She sweetly smiled, \"Because I'm like Godmother. We're both beauty that get prettier and prettier!\"Qin Xiao Mei couldn't help laughing when she heard it: \"Godmother really loves your little mouth. You really know how to talk!\"Despite the loud noise outside, the two little dumplings who were sleeping inside weren't woken up.Qin Xiao Mei took Da Qiao's hand and walked in. Seeing the two fair and tender dumplings with their heads next to each other like glutinous rice dumplings, she fell in love.She leaned over to identify them for a while. Finally she could only shake her head and give up: \"They look too similar! So which one is the elder brother and which is the younger brother?\"Da Qiao pointed to the little dumpling on the right and softly introduced, \"This is second younger brother, Qiao An Jie. This is third younger brother, Qiao An Xu. There is a mole under the left eye of Third Younger Brother. Look.\"Saying that, she gently turned Third Younger Brother's little face and revealed the little face on the left. There was indeed a very delicate mole on it.Qin Xiao Mei reached out and gently touched the mole on the child's face. She sighed, \"Oh, a boy with such a mole will make many girls cry for him when he grows up!\"Both Qiao Zhen Jun and Lin Hui were good-looking. The two small dumplings were born with their best features. Their facial features were very delicate.The average baby was born with a flat nose. However, the two little dumplings got high nose bridge and red mouth. So beautiful that people can't wait to steal them home!Speaking of which, Qiao Family knew how to raise children. When Qiao An Xu was born, he was as thin and small as a kitten. It had only been a month since and he was raised so plump that one couldn't tell the difference between him and his elder brother.After watching for a while, Chu Family also arrived.In two days, Chu Sheng Mei was going to have a wedding banquet in the county. That's why, Chu Family came over early; just in time for the two little dumplings' full month and everyone got together again.Like Qin Xiao Mei, Dong Xue fell in love with the two small dumplings; wishing they were hers.Qin Xiao Mei got one son, while she had nothing under her knees. Her only daughter died of illness few years ago. No matter how cute little Wan'er was, she can't see her every day.When she thought of herself, she couldn't help feeling sad. She felt sorry for her husband.They have been married for so many years and were without a child. In the past, the in-laws were dissatisfied, but were blocked by her husbands.Recently, in-law's dissatisfaction had reached its peak. When Mother-in-law came to stay in the county last month, she scolded her red and finally gave an ultimatum. If she couldn't be pregnant this year, she would get Chu Tian Bai to divorce her!She didn't dare to tell her husband. She could only take the brunt by herself. She was out of idea though.In the past few years, whenever everyone recommended an useful doctor, they ran over to see them. No matter how bad the herbal drinks were, she drank it without blinking. Still, there was no news from her belly.Seeing Dong Xue's reaction, Qin Xiao Mei understood in a second. She reached out and patted her hand and coaxed, \"Don't think too much. The more you worry about having a child, the more it won't come. Just leave it to fate.\"Dong Xue reached out and wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes. She squeezed out a smile at her and said, \"Yes. I can only leave to fate. I just want to a baby. Whether it's a boy or a girl, it can do. But why is it that I can't have one?\"Thinking of what her mother-in-law said, Dong Xue couldn't help covering her eyes and sob.Seeing her like this, Qin Xiao Mei sensed sadness in her heart. Her eyes turned red.Da Qiao looked at Godmother, then looked at Auntie Xue. She ran over and said, \"Auntie Xue, don't cry. You will have a baby soon!\"Dong Xue never thought that she would lose her composure so much. It must have been the excessive pressure during this time.Today was Qiao Family's good day. Fortunately, no one in Qiao Family minded. If it were another family, they might think she was deliberately trying to add bad luck.Hearing Da Qiao's words, she was startled: \"There will be a baby soon?\"Da Qiao stretched out her fair and tender paws and placed them on her belly. She raised her head and smiled with curved eyes: \"En, there will be a baby.\"Dong Xue came back to her senses and smilingly patted her head, \"Good child. Auntie Xue thank you for your blessing.\"Although the child's words were very pleasant, she didn't take them to heart; just thought of them as childish words.Qin Xiao Mei didn't take it seriously either. Instead, she teased her: \"What about Godmother? Will there be a baby?\"Da Qiao's little head nodded: \"There will be. Don't cry anymore. It's not good for the baby!\"The two of them couldn't help chucking at the little one's serious look.With this laugh, the mood had also improved a lot. The atmosphere was no longer depressed.Dong Xue grinned at Qin Xiao Mei: \"No wonder you love this child so much. So sweet!\"Proudness shone on Qin Xiao Mei's face: \"Ain't that right. If it wasn't for Qiao Family's unwillingness, I would definitely take her home and raise her!\"...Today was Qiao Family's twins' full month. Qiao Family didn't invite too many people; only Shen Family, Chu Family, and Lin Hui's maternal family.Even so, the small yard was crowded and filled with liveliness.Outside, people kept taking the opportunity to pass by Qiao's small house; wanting to see what delicious food Qiao Family made today.Qiao Family's life were really getting better and better. Not only did the family have two employees, but they also recognized two relatives from the city. And a future son-in-law who was a colonel. Tsk tsk tsk, simply envious to death!However, with a big dog like Pi Pi, everyone was destined to see nothing. Once they get close, Pi Pi will stare at them and they will get goosebumps.Though they can't see the dishes, they could see the newly budded pears from Qiao Family!That's right. The pear tree in Qiao's courtyard was bearing fruit again!A fist-sized pear hung on the branches and shone under the sun's golden glow. Those who had tasted it couldn't help drooling.Qiao Family's pear tree was really amazing. It bear fruit twice a year. Please give them a dozen of such pear trees!The production team's children had long been eyeing the pears in Qiao's small house. As soon as they saw the pear tree in fruition, they immediately went home and asked their family to bring something to exchange!Taking advantage of the twins' good day today, the villagers simply took good things and exchanged them. It was considered selling a favor to Qiao Family.Today's dishes were all cooked by Xue Chuan himself. No matter whether it was meat or vegetable dish, they were extremely fresh. But when a plate of steamed fish was served, there were suddenly two retching sounds from the table.Everyone was stunned and stared at Dong Xue and Qin Xiao Mei.What was going on here?Wasn't this fish delicious?Wan Chun Ju pouted and commented, \"The rich and noble people are different these days. They can't even eat fish meat. Do they want to eat fairy meat?\"In the past, Wan Chun Ju licked Qin Xiao Mei and Dong Xue's boots. But since the two of them refused to accept little Dong Yun as their goddaughter, she hated them both.Qiao Zhen Guo laughed: \"Wife, people don't want to eat it. While you couldn't eat even if you wanted to eat when you were pregnant!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Truly touching a tender spot!Qiao 'wife-retorter' Zhen Guo continued to add another dig: \"And when you were stung all over your face by monema flavescens. That's right, when you laughed and dropped your chin. You couldn't eat any meat. Hahaha, it's too hilarious. Wife, how come only unlucky things happen to you? It can't be that you can't eat again today, right?\"Wan Chun Ju was so angry that she nearly spat out a mouthful of old blood: \"...\"Hurry up and close your crow's mouth. No one will think you are mute if you don't open your mouth!One side, Wan Chun Ju was so mad with her man, the other side Qin Xiao Mei and Dong Xue kept retching.At first they thought it was just an accident. But once they smelled the fishy smell, they couldn't stop.Lin Hui eyed them and suddenly said, \"You two... it couldn't be that you have it?\"\"Impossible!\"Qin Xiao Mei and Dong Xue responded in unison.It wasn't that they didn't want to be pregnant. The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. Over the years, they had been disappointed too many times. They didn't want to be disappointed any more.So they'd rather tell themselves from the start that they ate something bad and had an upset stomach rather than being pregnant.Da Qiao ran over from the children's table and softly spoke, \"It's possible. The babies don't like to eat fish.\"Hearing Da Qiao's words, Qin Xiao Mei and Dong Xue were startled again.Many people believed children's eyes were clearer than adults. Due to that, they can see things that adults can't.It seem that when some people were pregnant, they will get a child check the gender. Da Qiao had already said earlier. Now she said it again. It can't be that they were really pregnant?Qiao Xiu Zhi made a decisive decision: \"I think you are pregnant. The health clinic isn't far from here. You can go there and let the doctor check. Even if it's not, let the doctor check. You should take the medicine you need. All in all, you'll get reassurance...\"Their men, Shen Shi Kai and Chu Tian Bai, also agreed with this. They hurriedly dragged them both to the clinic.Da Qiao took the initiative to lead the way.As a result, everyone was in joy!Qin Xiao Mei was pregnant. Dong Xue was also pregnant. Both of them were more than a month pregnant!When Dong Xue heard the doctor's words, she didn't respond for a long time: \"Doctor, you, you said I'm pregnant?\"The doctor jollily told: \"Yes. It should be less than two months along. Be careful during the first three months of pregnancy. Eat as little cold food as possible. Do not do too strenuous exercise.\"Chu Tian Bai was excited. In spite of the presence of so many people, he tightly grasped his wife's hand and exclaimed, \"You heard right. The doctor said you are pregnant.\"He knew better than anyone what his wife thinks.Over the years, he had never dared to display the idea of wanting a child in front of his wife; for fear of putting pressure on her and making her sad.But did he not want children?Of course he want. That year, when his daughter passed away, he was so sad that he almost couldn't get through it!Later, there was little Wan'er. He sincerely treated little Wan'er as his own daughter. It was a pity that little Wan'er had her own parents and family. No matter how much they like her, they can't force her to stay.Now they finally have a child of their own!Dong Xue turned around and rushed into her husband's embrace. She couldn't help crying: \"Tian Bai... We have a baby! We have a baby!\"Chu Tian Bai hugged her like a child, affirming her words: \"Well, we have a baby!\"On Qin Xiao Mei and Shen Shi Kai's side, they were also delighted and excited. But compared to the two of them, they can still keep a lid on it.After all, they had Tian You. Even if they didn't birth another, they won't feel bad. At most they would be a little disappointed.Qin Xiao Mei turned around and beckoned to Da Qiao: \"Quick, come over here to Godmother. Oh, you are really Godmother's little lucky star!\"Before Da Qiao said she had a baby, she didn't believe it. Unexpectedly, she was pregnant!Dong Xue calmed down after crying for a while. After wiping her tears, she turned around to pull Da Qiao over to hug her and said, \"Da Qiao, Auntie Xue thank you!\"Like Qin Xiao Mei, she felt that she was able to conceive because she was blessed by Da Qiao.After so many years of not being able to conceive, she found out that she was pregnant after Da Qiao said it. Even if it was just a coincidence, this coincidence made her feel grateful!Chu Tian Bai recalled and remembered during this period of time, they had given up looking for a doctor since last year. So Dong Xue hadn't gone through any diet for more than a year.To pinpoint when Dong Xue's health began to improve, it probably started after Da Qiao gave them dried rose flowers and jasmine tea.At that time, they brought the flower tea back. On the first day of brewing it, the two of them slept peacefully.He often suffered from insomnia due to his busy work and stress. But after drinking tea brewed with roses that day, he slept until dawn and never woke up in the middle!There was also white hair at such young age. But recently he noticed his white hair was much less. There was new growth of black hair.As for the wife, there had also been many changes. First of all, her hands and feet were no longer cold all year round. When she got those female thing, she won't roll on the bed in pain. Even the blood turned a lot more red.Her menstruation had been irregular. They didn't know how many doctors and Chinese medicine practitioners they had seen. They can cure the symptoms but not the root cause. But since drinking the herbal tea, she no longer had period cramp.All these changes came to mind now. All happened after drinking the flower tea!Chu Tian Bai looked down at the little dumpling in his wife's arms. His heart was surging, but he didn't show it on his face.Whether Da Qiao was a real lucky star or not, this matter wasn't suitable for publicity. Otherwise it will only do her harm.What Chu Family can think of, Shen Family can naturally think of.Compared with Chu Family, Shen Family benefited more. The whole family's health got better.It was just that they didn't link it to Da Qiao before. But now they thought about it carefully, they immediately realize that Da Qiao was different.Just like Chu Tian Bai, they didn't make a sound. They didn't want Da Qiao to suffer any harm because of it.As for the blessings that Da Qiao brought them, they will repay her and Qiao Family well in the future!Back at Qiao's house, everyone heard that they were both pregnant. They were happy for them and hurriedly congratulated them.Only one person in the audience was very unhappy.That person was none other than Wan Chun Ju.Because she was hit by her man's crow's mouth. She couldn't eat meat again!Not only was she unable to eat meat, but she also dislocated her jaw again!People, who have dislocated their chin once, will be more likely to dislocate again than the average person if they didn't pay attention. The doctor had warned her about this before, but Wan Chun Ju didn't take it to heart.She ate two pork knuckles in a row. When she was about to eat the third piece, she heard the sound of 'clicking' in her ears Then she let out the sound of slaughtered pigs.Qiao Zhen Guo turned to look and immediately laughed like a dog: \"Hahaha, Wife, your jaw dropped again!\"Wan Chun Ju burst into tears: \"... woo woo... hut your mouth...\"If it was fine if she didn't open her mouth. Now she did, saliva flowed down.Qiao Zhen Guo laughed even more wildly: \"Wife, you are like the silly girl from the neighboring production team again. Haha, your saliva is on your clothes!\"Wan Chun Ju almost died of anger: \"...\"This full month banquet ended with laughter and Wan Chun Ju's shriek. Quite a lively scene....When Shen Shi Kai and Qin Xiao Mei returned to Shen's house, Shen Family's two elders was shocked and happy when they found out that their daughter-in-law was pregnant.Old Madam Shen was so delighted that her eyes were red: \"It's really a blessing from the Bodhisattva. Whether it's a boy or a girl in this belly, we all like it!\"Shen Family already had Shen Tian You. So whether this child is a boy or a girl, the two elders didn't have any demand.Qin Xiao Mei rubbed her belly and smiled: \"It's not the blessing of Bodhisattva. It's the blessing that Da Qiao brought to us!\"With that, she told everyone what happened at Qiao's house today.After speaking, she stated: \"I know you will say that I am superstitious, but I just think that all this was brought to me by Da Qiao!\"Old Madam Shen responded, \"Now that you said, it's true. Since you recognized the child as a goddaughter, my waist and legs don't hurt anymore. Especially every time she comes over, I can eat half bowl more!\"She didn't consider it in that aspect before. She just thought that Da Qiao was so well-behaved and sensible and taken a liking to her. And due to good mood, her appetite improved.When old Madam Shen was younger, she was someone who would worship God and burn incense. But it was only after it was forbidden, she stopped. So, everyone wasn't surprised when she said that.Th unusual one was old Mister Shen.Old Mister Shen didn't believe in ghosts and gods. His character was old-fashioned and stubborn. Unexpectedly, after hearing his daughter-in-law's words, he nodded and said, \"Da Qiao is very good. She looks like a lucky child!\"Everyone looked at him like he was a ghost.Old Mister Shen was a little annoyed by the reaction and coughed: \"I'm not wrong. Da Qiao's child is certainly wonderful. You guys are too stupid. I found out long ago. The herbal tea she gave to us Shen Family can't be bought by money!\"Just like Chu Tian Bai, on the first day he received the flower tea, old Mister Shen slept until dawn.One must know, this kind of thing hadn't happened in decades. Especially when he was getting older. It was pretty amazing if he can sleep four or five hours a day.Later, every time Da Qiao came over, his body would be full of strength. All kinds of ailments on his body would gradually heal.According to the past, he had to go to the hospital four or five times a year. But since his daughter-in-law recognized Da Qiao as goddaughter, he hadn't been to the hospital for a long time.He took this all in, but never wanted to say it.Destruction pursues the great. The child was still young, so keeping a low profile was the best protection for her.Old Madam Shen complained to him: \"Since you know, why you didn't say it before. Oh, it can't do. I have to go to the room to find some good things and gift it to that child!\"Old Madam Shen got a lot of good things in her hands. It seems that she agreed with Da Qiao being a blessing.In fact, it was more than agreeing. If they hadn't already recognized her as goddaughter, she even wanted her grandson to childhood engagement with her. What a pity!The same scene also happened in Chu's house.Have to say, Dong Xue's pregnancy came at the right time. Her mother-in-law originally wanted to her son to divorce her daughter-in-law after her daughter's banquet. Unexpectedly, she became pregnant.Now that she was pregnant, there was definitely no need for a divorce.Chu Tian Bai didn't know his mom had this idea before. He was very angry when he found out. At the same time, he felt more and more distressed for his wife.Originally, he planned to bring his parents to live in the county. But after knowing this, he immediately dismissed the idea.The days were quiet for a few days. Soon, it was disrupted again.Wang Yan Sheng's dad and Qiao Hong Mei died on the same day!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySince the death of old Madam Wang and Wang Xin Sheng, old Mister Wang had been in a bad state. In addition, Third Son refused to bring his grandson back last time. He became more and more depressed.This morning, the sky was overcast with only a silver-white light shining from the distant horizon. The dragonflies and swallows in the vicinity flew very low. It seemed that there would be a heavy rain soon.Wang Shui Sheng carried breakfast to his dad's room, but the door was locked from the inside. No one responded when he called out a few times.Liu Cui Hua came over and spoke, \"Dad's health has been getting worse and worse recently. Why don't you take him to the town hospital later?\"Wang Shui Sheng sighed and replied, \"I persuaded him before. He said that he wasn't sick and didn't want to go with me.\"After calling a few more times, there was still no movement inside. The two realized that something was wrong.Something popped in Wang Shui Sheng's mind and his face was pale. He handed the breakfast to Liu Cui Hua before stepping forward and kicked the door.The wooden door wasn't very strong. It collapsed after a few kicks.He quickly rushed in. The sight of old Mister Wang collapsed sideway on the ground entered his eyes. He had been out of breath for a long time.Wang Shui Sheng's eyes instantly turned red. He chokingly yelled, \"Dad!\"Seeing this, Liu Cui Hua's face also turned pale. She hastily put the things aside.With such a big commotion, the other two branches also heard. Soon, Wang's house sounded wail one after another.When the people around heard the movement, they hurried overwithout even properly dressing. Only after inquiring did they know that old Mister Wang was gone.The crowd sighed at once.Wang Family had already lost three people in less than a year. The luck was too bad.However, some people think that it was nothing compared to Fang Family's complete destruction, the death of three members was nothing. What's more, two of them were elderly.Old Mister Wang was 60 years old this year. Although it wasn't considered an advanced age. In this era, the normal life expectancy wasn't generally high. So everyone gave condolences before leaving.After Qiao Family knew about it, Qiao Xiu Zhi immediately brought Qiao Hong Xia over to ask Wang Family if they needed help and gave five yuan as a gift.Wang Family didn't want to accept the money, but Qiao Family insisted that they accept it. Since they couldn't refused to accept, they insisted to on not needing help.Although Qiao Hong Xia was already engaged to Wang Yan Sheng, they still hadn't had a the banquet yet. Besides, there were many members in Wang Family. There were enough manpower.After crying for a while, Wang Shui Sheng made a call in the production team office.Originally, he thought that Third Younger Brother wouldn't be able to come back. After all, he had already asked for leave this year. Unexpectedly, he would catch a ride back tomorrow.He froze for a moment before quickly acknowledging.On the way back, he contemplated before deciding to go to Qiao's small house to notifying his future younger sister-in-law, Qiao Hong Xia.Once Qiao Hong Xia knew the news of Wang Yan Sheng coming back, two red clouds flew up on her cheeks from excitement and anticipation.Although she and Wang Yan Sheng were engaged for less than half a year, they were very close. After Wang Yan Sheng went to the army, he often wrote to her and sent her things. Not just food and clothing, but also his salary!She could never have imagined that such a serious person on the surface could write letters that often made her blush.Thinking of him coming back soon, her heart beated wildly....The sky was gloomy for a whole morning. Every now and then a drop or two of light rain fell. Like it was constipation. Quite an unpleasant drizzle.Finally, after lunch, there was a loud noise in the sky. Lightning struck and thunder boomed. Then followed by wind and rain.A scene of autumn rain to coolness. After a burst of heavy rain fall, the weather became a lot cooler.Da Qiao climbed onto the kang and covered the two younger brothers with a small sheet.When they were first born, she felt that her younger brother was ugly and smelly with wrinkled skin of an old man. She thought that even if they grew, they wouldn't look as good as little Dong Yun.Unexpectedly, the more the two small dumplings grew, the better they looked. They were fair and tender. Every time when one look at them, they want to take a bite.She had moved very carefully; hardly any movement were made. But as soon as she approached, the two little dumplings suddenly woke up.She reached out and tapped their little faces, \"Younger brothers, why are you awake again?\"When the two little dumplings heard her voice, their eyes turned to her. It was unknown if they could see. Anyway, the two little things giggled one after another.Out of the two small dumplings, elder brother, Qiao An Jie was relatively quiet and rarely cry. While younger brother, Qiao An Xu was a little delicate.It was fine if there was no one around. If someone was present, he will cry to get their attention. If one ignore him, the fake cry will turn into a real cry.Seeing that Third Younger Brother was about to fake crying again, Da Qiao hurriedly 'lectured': \"Xu Xu, you can't be like this. If you act so delicate, Elder Sister won't like you anymore!\"Lin Hui walked in. Seeing her serious appearance, she couldn't help laughing: \"Younger Brother is still young and can't understand what you say. Once they grow up, you teach them okay?\"But a strange incident happened the next moment. After hearing his elder sister's words, the normal delicate bundle actually quieted down, as if he really understood.He also showed a 'toothless' smile. His appearance was so obedient that it made people soft-hearted.Lin Hui instantly found strange: \"Oh, this little guy can look at his expression at such a young age. What will he be like once he grows up?\"Qiao Hong Xia walked in and nodded in agreement, \"I've found out long ago. When these two little guys grow up, they must be Da Qiao's followers too!\"There were already two followers at home and little Wan-er in the old house. Now there were two more. She felt a headache when she thought how a group of children will be sister-con in the future.Lin Hui imagined it and laughed. She reached out and rubbed Da Qiao's head, \"That's cause our Da Qiao is too cute and sensible. It's why younger brothers and younger sisters like her so much!\"Hearing her mom's compliment, Da Qiao blushed with joy. She nodded, \"I'm a good elder sister!\"In the past, her biological mom hated her. Her younger sister messed with her. The other children in the village laughed at her. Those days were like a nightmare.At that time, Da Qiao didn't dare to imagine that one day she would become the group's favorite.She liked the current life.The rain outside was getting heavier and heavier. Under an umbrella, old woman made way to the production team. Although she was holding an umbrella in her hand, the rain was so heavy that she was soaked like a chicken in soup.Behind her, there were two little drowned chickens.Their whole body was soaked by the rain. Their hair was sticking to their faces, while their trousers were muddy. They looked like a mess.These three chickens were none other than Qiao Hong Mei's mother-in-law, Mother Chen and Qiao Hong Mei's two daughters Chen Zhao Di and Chen Lai Di.Halfway there, Mother Chen suddenly stopped and turned around to berate: \"You two money-wasting things, hurry up, will ya. Stop dawdling. Do you still want to be beaten?\"Hearing this, Chen Zhao Di shivered: \"Grandmother, we aren't dawdling...\"SLAP SLAP!Before she could finish speaking, she was slapped by Mother Chen. Chen Lai Di next to her was also beaten.Chen Lai Di was so mad. She felt her elder sister was as stupid as a pig. Why did she talk back at this time?Chen Zhao Di's eyes were full of tears; immersed in self-pity!She didn't intend to talk back. She just wanted to explain to her grandmother. They really didn't dawdle on purpose .Why didn't her grandmother believe her?The trio entered the production team. Soon some people noticed them.\"It's raining so hard. Why are there people outside?\"\"Hey, those people look very familiar. They don't seem to be from our production team?\"Once they noticed the strangers entering the production team, everyone came out to holler regardless of the rain: \"Who are you? Why did you come to our production team?\"When Mother Chen saw someone, she sobbed out: \"I'm Hong Mei's mother-in-law. I came to the production team to find our in-laws...\"But before she could finish speaking, she was interrupted: \"What in-laws. Your Hong Mei isn't Qiao Family's daughter. I heard that they had gone to the police station to cut off the relationship. What are you doing here?\"\"Yes. Did you specially come here to return Hong Mei's dowry?\"Mother Chen didn't expect the production team to play cards so unconventionally. She hadn't said anything yet and they stood on Qiao Family's. Simple infuriating!Still the older the ginger, the spicier it was. Compared with Qiao Hong Mei, Mother Chen had a thicker skin: \"Hong Mei was raised by Qiao Family since she was young. Why is she not from Qiao Family? Now that Hong Mei murdered and Qiao Family's god-relative is deputy chief, shouldn't I come to look for them?\"When everyone heard \"Hong Mei murdered someone\", they couldn't care about anything else.\"What happened? Why did Hong Mei kill someone?\"Everyone started to ask questions. Mother Chen refused to say anything. She turned around and continued on to Qiao's house.Some people's curiosity was piqued. Paying no heed to the terrible weather, they hurriedly headed to Qiao's house after Mother Chen.Mother Chen came to Qiao's old house.\u00a0BANG BANG BANG.\u00a0As she patted the wooden door, she shouted: \"In-law, In-law, open the door. Your pitiful daughter Hong Mei is about to die. Hurry up and go see her!\"When someone heard this, they instantly became perplexed: \"Didn't you just say that Hong Mei murdered someone? Why is it now Hong Mei is about to die?\"No matter what everyone asked, Mother Chen didn't respond. Her hands hurt. So she got her two granddaughters to hit together.Even when the hands of the trio were all swollen, Qiao Family didn't open the door!\"In-law! Why are you so cruel!\" Mother Chen was really desperate.This morning, Qiao Hong Mei ran to the state-run restaurant and stabbed Wang Ni-er with scissors. Qiao Hong Mei had already been arrested.Whether Qiao Hong Mei will be shot or not, she didn't care at all. What she cared about was her son.Someone's life was gone. It went without saying Chen Xing and Wang Ni-er's affair couldn't be hidden. Chen Xing was arrested on the spot.So she rushed over because she wanted Qiao Family to come forward and save her son!Mother Chen's voice was hoarse. She made her two granddaughters cry together. Finally they couldn't take it anymore and the door of Qiao's house opened.Wan Chun Ju rushed out from the inside with a look of excitement and splashed the contents of the bucket with a 'splat' sound.As the contents of the bucket were poured out, a foul stench came out.\"Why does it smell so bad?\" The onlookers covered their noses in disgust.Then everyone looked. My goddess. Chen Family's trio's heads were covered with gold.Some people couldn't help but gag.Hands on hip, Wan Chun Ju smirked: \"This poo is accumulated from my little Dong Yun in the past two days. You benefitted! If you don't leave, I will let the dog out!\"Mother Chen was so pissed that her face turned red and white. Her breath almost didn't come up and she nearly died of anger on the spot!It was just that her son was still waiting for her to rescue him. She got to get Qiao Family come forward.However, Qiao Family made up their minds to ignore Chen Family. They had already cut off their relationship. Who would interfere in their bad affairs?In the end, Chen Family trio were chased out of the production team by Qiao You Rou and Pi Pi.Mother Chen went back to town crying. Then she saw a police officer who came to inform her; told her to go to the police station to pick up Qiao Hong Mei's corpse.When Mother Chen heard this, her legs softened. She collapsed to sitting position on the ground: \"You said my daughter-in-law died? Why...why so fast?\"\"She swallowed iron in prison!\" the police officer stated with a blank expression.No one thought the woman had an iron nugget hidden on her body, let alone that she was so cruel to herself and abruptly swallowed the iron nugget. When the prison guards found out, the woman was passed saving.It was clear that Qiao Hong Mei was ready to commit suicide before going to the state-run restaurant.Since Qiao Family cut off their relationship with Qiao Hong Mei, her life in Chen's house had become more and more difficult. Her mother-in-law and her man beat and scolded her every day; saying that she was useless and made such good maternal family connection gone!Chen Xing wanted to divorce her, but she didn't want to. She said that if he dared to divorce, she would report him. After saying this, she was beaten until bleeding on the spot.Later, Chen Xing stopped mentioning about the divorce. Instead, he brought Wang Ni-er home from time to time. To outsider, he said Wang Ni-er was the godmother of his children. Outsiders thought it was the truth. Each time, Qiao Hong Mei fumingly gritted her teeth.Wang Ni-er was too arrogant. Before she divorced Chen Xing, she entered the house and used her as a servant girl. If she didn't disobey, Wang Ni-er would encourage Chen Xing to beat her!This kind of life made Qiao Hong Mei gloomier day by day.Pitiful people had something hateful about them. After suffering under her mother-in-law and Chen Xing, she would later vent her anger on her daughters.Especially Chen Zhao Di, who she disliked the most. The girl had bruises all over her body from her pinch.Once she wanted to scald her eldest daughter with boiling water. If her mother-in-law hadn't come back earlier, Chen Zhao Di would have died a long time ago.Since she didn't silently wait to die, she silently ticked like a timebomb.Finally, after Chen Xing told her that Wang Ni-er was pregnant, Qiao Hong Mei couldn't bear it any longer. Grabbing a scissor, she stormed to the state-run restaurant. Then, without saying a word, she stabbed Wang Ni-er in the belly!Want to give birth to a son for Chen Xing? Want to squeeze her out of the door of Chen's house?Dream on!She knew she won't be able to live after killing Wang Ni-er. So before going out, she hid a thumb-sized iron nugget on her body.After entering the prison, she swallowed the iron nugget when the prison guards weren't paying attention. When the severe pain came, she regretted it.There was no regret medicine in the world though.Whether she regretted about being too selfish toward Qiao Family or committing murder, it was too late.It took Mother Chen a long time to find her own voice: \"What about my son? What will happen to him?\"Who cares if Daughter-in-law died. She was a calamity. She can't lay eggs herself and even killed her precious grandson. This kind of lowly thing should go to hell!The police officer impatiently uttered: \"Go retrieve the corpse first. I don't know about the rest!\"Mother Chen didn't dare to ask any more.However, because of Qiao Hong Mei's death, the case was also closed. Although Chen Xing had improper relationship, he didn't kill anyone.After a few days in prison, he was bailed out by Mother Chen with money. His job as a chef was definitely gone.To make matters worse, he was beaten on a dark and windy night less than two days after he was released from prison!He was lucky and got rescued by a passerby. However, the man's place was completely gone. He became Eunuch Chen.In tears, Mother Chen hugged her son. Her son's that place was disabled. Their Chen Family was completely without future!When Chen Xing was beaten, they called the police on the same day. It was at night when Chen Xing was assaulted. He didn't see the person who beat him. Noe did any one passed by. The case could only be left unresolved.In fact, Chen Xing knew in his heart who did this, Wang Ni-er's family.Wang Family lost a daughter. Qiao Hong Mei deserved what she got. But why did that lowly man, Chen Xing go unpunished?After discussing, Wang Ni-er's two elder brothers cut off Chen Xing's roots during the night. This way, he would never be able to commit sins again!Chen Xing lost his job and that place was disabled. He either slept or went out to hang out with hooligans all day. Then one night, he came home drunk and accidentally missed a step and fell into the river. He drowned.Knowing that her only son was dead, Mother Chen didn't catch her breath and passed away too.The four golden flowers of Chen Family suddenly became orphans. Someone proposed to send the four children to their grandma's house. The police station wanted to implement this idea but was stopped by Shen Shi Kai.Later, all four golden flowers were sent to the orphanage. They have nothing to do with Qiao Family since then.Of course, these were all matter of the future....Back to Wang Yan Sheng's side. After he received the call from his eldest brother, he immediately went to ask for leave from Lieutenant General Jiang.He had just asked for a leave in May. He shouldn't ask for another leave, but he wanted to bid a final goodbye to his dad.When his parents were alive, his parents had given birthed and raised him despite the slight biased. Now that they were all gone, their brothers were considered completely separated.From then on, they were only relatives.Second, he deeply missed Qiao Hong Xia.Since the moment they separated, he had been thinking about her all the time. So when he went back this time, he wanted to take the opportunity to spend more time with her.Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang approved his leave slip. At the same time, he gave him a task to bring Huo Hua Qing's grandson Huo Chi to the army.Hearing Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang's words, he couldn't help being stunned: \"The child is only ten years old. Is it appropriate to come to the army at such a young age? Is it alright with his identity?\"Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang said: \"Bringing him to the army isn't letting him join the army. He is so young. Even if I want to, can others agree? The child can't keep staying with the production team. Otherwise his life will be ruined!\"Staying in the pigsty of the production team, he can't study or go to school. Although the people in the production team have changed their opinion of them because of their hard work, they can only stay in the pigsty for the rest of their lives as long as they have the identity of wicked ones!To be able to fight for this position at a young age, Wang Yan Sheng wasn't just ruthless. His brain was also not stupid. He contemplated for a moment before he understood.His eyebrows raised: \"Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang want the child to faked his death, right?\"Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang nodded and sighed: \"I have a distant relative whose son died of illness not long ago. They haven't reported this matter to their community. After I found out, I proposed to let Huo Chi to take their child's place. They agreed.\"Of course, he promised a lot of benefits in the process. If not, the other party would definitely not be willing to cooperate.After listening, Wang Yan Sheng was silent for a while. Then he nodded and replied, \"This is also good. That child is smart by nature. It would be a pity if he keep staying in the pigsty!\"Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang picked up the enamel cup and took a sip of water: \"When the time comes, you can go to my hometown and get the child's identity certificate. Then bring the child to the army. When the time comes, he will be raised in my house.\"Lieutenant General\u00a0Jiang received a lot of help from Huo Hua Qing back then. Over the years, he had always wanted to improve the life and fate of Huo Family. Unfortunately he had limited power and can't do many things.Wang Yan Sheng nodded in agreement. Afterward, he left the office and prepared to go back to pack his things.Walking to the family building, he saw a young woman standing by the family building. He came to a halt.The back was very familiar. It was none other than Dong Li Li.As if sensing something, Dong Li Li turned around to find Wang Yan Sheng frowning at her. Blushing, she explained, \"I-I'm not waiting for you!\"When Wang Yan Sheng heard this, he couldn't help but paused.He was overthinking?Dong Li Li said: \"My match also lives here. He went up to get something. I'm to wait for him here.\"So don't overthink!Hearing this, a hint of awkwardness finally flashed across Wan Yan Sheng's face.Just now, he really thought that Dong Li Li was waiting for him. After all, this kind of thing happened often in the past. Although she hadn't done this for a long time after he explained it to her last time.In midst of the awkwardness, a young man ran downstairs and cheerfully spoke while running: \"I'm sorry. I kept you waiting for a long time. Now, this is the book you want.\"When Dong Li Li saw her match, she revealed a bright smile, \"It's fine. I just waited for a while. I've been looking for this book for a long time. Didn't expect you to have it. Wonderful. I'll return it to you immediately after reading it!\"The young man shook his head. Revealing a set of white teeth on his young face, he spoke: \"You don't have to give it back. My things are your things.\"As soon as he finished speaking, he realized that his superior was standing behind him.What a shock!When he came down just now, he only had his match in his eyes. He couldn't even see a person as tall as Leader Wang!He quickly stood at attention and gave a military salute: \"Greeting Colonel!\"Wang Yan Sheng nodded, walked past them and commented, \"Comrade Dong is a good girl. Treat her well!\"The young man gave another military salute. Smiling even more brilliantly, he responded: \"Copied that, Colonel!\"Dong Li Li didn't expect Wang Yan Sheng to say such a thing. After being stunned for a while, her nose slightly soured.She fell in love with Wang Yan Sheng as first sight. Later, she tried every means to get close to him, but he remained indifferent.She was sad and depressed. Now she was relieved.The person she liked, even if he didn't like her, was still a person worthy of liking.His character made her feel that her youth hadn't been let down!Wang Yan Sheng sourced a ticket on his side, packed his things and left.Da Qiao didn't know yet that her elder brother Huo Chi was about to part with her soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWang Yan Sheng was on the road for five to six days. He had to go to Lieutenant General Jiang's house to get the identity certificate. It was already ten days later when he returned to the production team.Lieutenant General Jiang's relative's child came to the municipal city to seek medical treatment before dying. Later, after being declared incurable, they were moved to Lieutenant General Jiang's house. In other words, he wasn't in the production team when he died, but in Lieutenant General Jiang's house.In this way, the production team didn't know that the child had died of illness. When his parents went back, they told the production team that he had been brought to the army by Lieutenant General Jiang to live in the army. While Lieutenant General Jiang's neighbor thought that the child had long returned to the production team.The two sides could deceive the sky and ocean.The child who died of illness was the same age as Huo Chi. Once Huo Chi lived in the army for more than ten years, the production team couldn't recognize him even if he went to the production team. No one would ever find out about it.Back to the production team. Because it was lunch time, not a figure could be seen along the way. That was until he walked past a century-old tree. A slender figure walked toward him.Da Zhi was returning from the educated youth center. She didn't expect to see the person who once made her dream... Wang Yan Sheng.Her heart was beating like a drum. It beat so fast. She lowered her head to straighten her clothes and hair. Then she walked toward the other party with a sweet smile.She felt that this was the last chance God gave her. She must seize it no matter what!Ever since she was 'forced' to marry Gou Sheng, she felt like she was in hell. Each day was worse than death. Gou Sheng was ugly and incompetent. How could deserve to marry a heavenly celestial like her?She originally just wanted to be a fake couple with him. But that beast. She was ... by him the first day she moved in...Thinking of what Gou Sheng forced her to do, her face flushed even more. Her chest heaved up and down violently.It was a pity that Wang Yan Sheng's eyes never turned to her from the beginning to the end. His whole heart was thinking of seeing his fiancee.\"Colonel Wang...\"Seeing Wang Yan Sheng ignoring her and directly walking past, she felt aggrieved and embarrassed.Hearing the words 'Colonel Wang' go longer than the mountain range, Wang Yan Sheng found it too greasy. He turned around and stated with a serious face, \"What's the matter?\"Da Zhi bit her lower lip lightly and replied, \"Colonel Wang, don't you remember me? I'm...\"\"I'm asking you what's the matter?\" Wang Yan Sheng didn't listen to her at all and coldly interrupted her.Da Zhi's face flashed red and white.She wanted to say that she had fancied him for a long time. She intended to present how knowledgeable she was. What's more, she was from the city. The most important thing was that she hadn't given birth to other men's children. She was a hundred times better than Qiao Hong Xia!But before she could open her mouth, a rush of nausea rushed to her throat. She turned her head, and retched to the side.Seeing her like this, Wang Yan Sheng was about to find someone over when he noticed an auntie walking over.\"Oh, isn't this Wang Family's old Third? Did you get a leave to come back?\" The auntie's voice was as loud as a gong. Her pair of triangular eyes swept between the two of them.Expressionless, Wang Yan Sheng spoke: \"Auntie Huang, this... I don't know who this is. She suddenly vomited in front of me. If you know her, give her a hand.\"When Da Zhi heard his words, she was so vexed that he vomited even more.The auntie patted her thigh and yelled: \"Gou Sheng's wife, it can't be that you're pregnant?\"In midst of vomiting, Da Zhi: \"...\"What she hated most was that the people in the production team calling her Gou Sheng's wife. What kind of garbage name was this. She felt sick every time she heard it.Wait. What did the auntie just say?She was pregnant?Can't be! Certainly can't!But when she thought about this month's dozen-days late period, her face gradually paled. Her whole body was struck by lightning.Seeing the auntie present, he left them be. He turned around and strode away.One after another, the other production team saw Wang Yan Sheng coming back and came up to greet him.Some people were very envious when they saw Wang Yan Sheng carrying large and small bags. However, at the sight of Wang Yan Sheng's serious face, no one dared to ask.After Wang Yan Sheng left, everyone held their old porcelain bowls and chatted about it as they atte.Someone said: \"Although Wang Family were separated in the past, the two elderly were still living and they lived together. It's not a big difference whether the family was separated or not. Now, it's different. They will be four families in the future! \"\"It is like this. Now the parents are gone, the siblings will become relatives no matter how close they are! To put it in a bad way, with old Fifth Wang, the other members of Wang Family should be relieved!\"\"Ain't that right. He was just a piece of rat poo! I don't envy Wang Family though. I envy Hong Xia. Why didn't I see that she was so lucky before?\"\"Hong Xia got a very good life. All these women in the surrounding areas can't compare to her! It's strange. I never considered Hong Xia to be good-looking before. Why is she getting prettier the older she get now?\"\"Now that you said that, it's true! Not only her, but the rest of Qiao Family are all good-looking. Oh, this isn't right. It should be excluding Eldest Qiao's wife and her precious daughter!\"At the mention of Wan Chun Ju's ugly daughter, the topic instantly took a turn....Wang Yan Sheng went home first. Then he went to the top of the mountain with his eldest brother to pay his respects to his dad.After returning, he took out all the things he brought back. Some were given to his three brothers. The rest were taken to Qiao's house!Watching him go to Qiao's house with so much stuff, Liu Cui Hua sighed, \"In the heart of old Third, it seems there will be only Qiao Family in the future!\"Wang Shui Sheng glanced at her and scolded: \"What are you talking about? The things belong to old Third. He can give them to whomever he wants. You must not talk nonsense in front of him or you can go back to your maternal home!\"Liu Cui Hua was angry and embarrassed: \"I'm just casually commenting. I've been married to you for so many years, when did I talk nonsense?\"Wang Shui Sheng recalled that his wife had a good sense of proportion compared to those women in the production team and his tone softened: \"I'm afraid that one day you accidentally leaked it out and other overheard it!\"The speaker thought of nothing, while the listener sensed something. If these words reach the ears of old Third, it will be bad.Now that their parents were gone, the family had long split up. Everyone will have to live their own lives from now on. With old Third's personality, he might never look for them again in the future if they became greedy!Liu Cui Hua understood her man's meaning and assured: \"Don't worry. I will never say this again!\"Knowing that Wang Yan Sheng took so many things to Qiao's house, the other two sisters-in-law weren't very comfortable. Despite their displeasure, none dared to show it.Wang Yan Sheng didn't know the thoughts of his family. Even if he did, he wouldn't care. Over the years, he had contributed enough to his family.From next year, he will have his own small family. Everything in the future can only belong to his small family.As for his brothers, if they know to be grateful, everyone can get along well. He will naturally help those if he can help. If not, then everyone will be just ordinary relatives.When he arrived at Qiao's house, he found Qiao Family's children picking pears under the pear tree. Quite lively scene.As soon as he walked in, Pi Pi immediately sensed him and barked at him twice. Probably remembering who he was, he soon stopped barking.After these barks, Qiao Family naturally noticed him.Da Qiao was the first to react and sweetly called out, \"Future Uncle!\"Hearing this addressment, Wang Yan Sheng was very satisfied. In the near future, he would be able to remove the word 'future'.He tried to make a friendly expression. But before he even opened his mouth, he heard a series of \"Future Uncle\" one after another.The others were fine. However, little Yi Ming also called him \"Future Uncle\". It made him a little dumbfounded.The sensible children couldn't help laughing when they heard it. The little ones didn't know what the elder brothers and elder sisters were laughing at. It didn't matter if they didn't know. They just laughed along!So in an instant, Qiao's courtyard was filled with joy and laughter.Wang Yan Sheng looked at the group of children in front of him and felt warm. He can't wait to join such a warm and harmonious family.When Qiao Hong Xia heard the movement, she ran out and found Wang Yan Sheng standing like a mountain at the door. With a swoosh, her face flushed. \"You're back.\"As soon as Qiao Hong Xia came out, Wang Yan Sheng couldn't see anyone else anymore. His blazing eyes stared at her. He confirmed, \"En, I'm back.\"Qiao Hong Xia felt hot all over from his gaze. On top of that, the other children were looking at her. She became more and more at a loss: \"You, I... I haven't finished washing the dishes yet. I'll go in first.\"After speaking, she ran away.Entering the stove room, she felt like there were a few naughty deer in her heart; making her flustered.As she squatted down to wash the dishes, she recalled the way he looked at her just now. Her heart felt sweetened. She also felt very embarrassed. Her cheeks were like smeared with rouge.Qiao Hong Xia was shy. So Lin Hui had to come out and help her entertain him.Everyone in Qiao Family had a share of what Wang Yan Sheng brought. Even Qiao Zhen Jun and Qiao Zhen Min who were working outside.Just based on this thoughtfulness, one can see how much he valued Qiao Hong Xia.Lin Hui wasn't jealous at all. She was happy for her. But she missed her man more and more in her heart.When Wang Yan Sheng came over, the main purpose was to say a few words to Qiao Hong Xia and look at her more. However, she only came out once and never came out again after that.This made Wang Yan Sheng very disappointed. Even if she came out, they probably can't have a proper conversation with so many eyes from Qiao Family.Sighing, he returned.At night, he took advantage of the darkness to go to the pigsty again.Although everyone's attitude toward Huo Family had changed now, they were still wicked ones. What's more, he wasn't in the production team all year round. It went without saying they didn't know each other. That's why people in the production team can't know they have interactions.What's more, it was best that no one know what will happen next.Seeing Wang Yan Sheng coming over, Huo Hua Qing was a little surprised. Soon, he calmed down: \"Did Guo Hai send you here?\"Wang Yan Sheng nodded and told the other party what Lieutenant General Jiang had instructed to him bit by bit.After finishing speaking: \"I think this arrangement of Lieutenant General Jiang is the best for the child. But in the end you have to make your own decision. Elder Huo consider it. I will stay in the production team for a few days. Two days before I leave, I'll ask for your opinion again!\"After Huo Hua Qing heard it, an excited expression appeared on his face: \"No need to consider. I'll agreed to it!\"Ever since he was cast down as a wicked ones, he wasn't reconciled to his grievances. He never did anything wrong to the people of the country in his life and ended up like this.Son was dead. Grandson followed them to work on the farm like a sinner. He used to toss and turn for countless nights for the future of his grandson; fearing that his grandson would be trapped there for the rest of his life.Now that there was such a good opportunity, what else was there to consider?Although the child will change his name and surname because of this, it was nothing if he can live. In the end, it was just a way of addressing.Besides, if he changed his name, he wasn't a descendant of Huo Family then?Wang Yan Sheng could understand Elder Huo's excitement. He remained silent for a while before responding, \"Elder Huo should discuss it with the child and the child's mother. It is best not to let him go to the army with a rebellious heart.\"Huo Hua Qing pondered and replied, \"Okay, you thought it through. Then we'll go with what you said. Come back in two days!\"Wang Yan Sheng nodded and handed over the supplements he brought.He bought some of these things. Majority of them were instructed by Lieutenant General Jiang to bring over.Huo Hua Qing persisted on declining. Wang Yan Sheng didn't give him this chance. He turned around and went back into the night.Huo Hua Qing couldn't wait for tomorrow to tell his daughter-in-law and grandson and immediately woke them up.After listening to her father-in-law's words, Dai Shu Fang was very excited: \"Dad, what you said is true? Has everything been arranged by Lieutenant General Jiang? Will it be discovered?\"Though she was reluctant to have her son become someone else's child and go to the army, she could bear it when it was her son's future!Only Huo Chi was the calmest. A little unusually calm.Seeing her son like this, Dai Shu Fang felt like cold water poured on her face and instantly calmed down: \"Chi'er, don't you want to go?\"Huo Chi thought for a while before honestly nodding: \"I don't want to be someone else's son. Nor do I want to leave you either!\"Grandfather was getting older and older. He had accumulated a lot of injuries in those years on the farm. He was worried about being away for so long. If something happens to him one day, he will regret it for the rest of his life!Likewise, he was worried about his mom.Not everyone on the production team was a good guy. He had to stay and take care of them!Huo Hua Qing spoke: \"Good boy, we can't bear to part with you, but this is the only chance for you to leave the pigsty. Grandfather is old. The person I'm most worried about is you. If you are really filial, go!\"Grandson had been raised by his side since he was born. How could they not be reluctant to part?If he had other ways, he won't let him leave and let him change to someone else's surname. He had no choice!If he and his daughter-in-law both pass away in the future, what will happen to the child?Qiao Family were all good people, but no matter how good they were, they will never let their granddaughter or daughter marry a wicked one and live in a pigsty for the rest of her lives!He wasn't blaming Qiao Family. If he was in their place, he wasn't willing either. Measure other people's corn by one's own bushel. That's why, he was willing to send his grandson out and didn't want him to be ruined in this place for the rest of his life!Dai Shu Fang added: \"Chi-er, both Mom and Grandfather are reluctant to let you go, but only sending you away is the best arrangement for you. As for Mom and Grandfather, you don't have to worry. Now the production team treat us well. Isn't there Qiao Family? If something happens to us, they will definitely not let us die!\"Huo Chi lowered his head. The corners of his mouth pursed tightly and didn't speak.Huo Hua Qing was so anxious at sight of his grandson's reaction.Seeing that her father-in-law was about to scold, Dai Shu Fang hurriedly said, \"Dad, why don't you go to rest first. I'll persuade Chi-er. Although this place is far away from other villagers, we might be heard if someone passes by.\"Huo Hua Qing looked at his grandson who was still silent and sighed: \"Okay, properly explain it to him. Don't scold him\"When Dai Shu Fang heard her father-in-law's response, she smiled and spoke, \"I know. I will properly explain to him.\"After Huo Hua Qing left, Dai Shu Fang pulled her son to her side and said softly, \"Chi-er, Mom understand what your thought, but you really can't stay here. Let's not talk about the future and take now. You see Da Qiao go to school. While you can't go. She will go to junior high school and high school in the future. Can you still be friends by then?\"Huo Chi raised his head and agitatedly responded: \"Of course. Da Qiao isn't that kind of petty person!\"Dai Shu Fang nodded: \"Da Qiao is a good child. She's kind-hearted and sensible; naturally won't look down on you. But can you converse together? You don't understand what she understands. She will go to town and become an employee or teacher in the future. It may be difficult to come back to the production team in the future. And you. You can only stay in the pigsty for the rest of your life!\"Staying in the pigsty wasn't the worst. If Lieutenant General Jiang can't protect them in the future, they may be sent back to the farm. Their situation would be even worse!Huo Chi went silent again.Needless to say, he had already felt the distance between himself and Da Qiao.Every time Da Qiao came back from school, she would tell him about what happened at the school. He felt envious and depressed.What bothered him the most was that he had never been to school. He didn't even know how to imagine.So every time she mentioned this topic, he didn't know how to respond.Also when Shen Family came over, Shen Family was dressed so decently and drove a car. Every time they came, they brought a lot of things for Da Qiao; food and clothing. Without exception, everyone in the production team envied Da Qiao.Their Huo family received so much help from Qiao Family, especially from Da Qiao. He kept all these in his heart.It was just that this 'debt' was getting larger and larger. With his ability, he had no way to repay it!This made him extremely depressed and inferior.As his mother, Dai Shu Fang knew from her son's reaction that he had budged: \"Chi-er, will you be obedient? Mom knows that you are reluctant. We can meet again in the future.\"Huo Chi lowered his head and muffled out, \"Can we really meet again?\"Dai Shu Fang nodded: \"That colonel Wang who came just now is the future son-in-law of Qiao Family. Da Qiao's aunt will definitely come back in the future. You can just follow them back then.\"This was half true.It was probably plausible now. In the future, Qiao Hong Xia will follow him to the army. As Wang Yan Sheng's position rises, they may not be able to come back once a year.But she can't say these words. Otherwise, with Huo Chi's temperament, he definitely doesn't want to go.Huo Chi stood up and stated, \"I'll think about it.\"Dai Shu Fang breathed a sigh of relief when she heard her son's words. If he could consider it, it meant that he was willing in his heart. It was just that he couldn't get over his emotions.This night, Huo Family had a sleepless night....The next day, Huo Chi wanted to find Da Qiao, but Da Qiao had already gone to school. He had to wait for her to come back from school.As soon as Da Qiao returned to the production team, she noticed Elder Brother Huo Chi wandering in the bushes from a distance.She hurriedly let her cousins know before flying over.Qiao Dong He had already gone to the town for study. She usually lived at the school. Only on weekends, Qiao Zhen Guo would ride the bicycle to pick her up from the town.Now it was just Qiao Dong Ying, An Ping, and Da Qiao attending school in the community. The other children were too young to go to school.\"Elder Brother Huo Chi, are you waiting for me?\" Da Qiao ran over and said softly.Huo Chi let out an 'en' and nothing else. He turned around and headed towards West Wood.Da Qiao was stumped.What happened to Elder Brother Huo Chi?He seem a low-spirited. Did something happen?Thinking of this, she hurried to catch up.On the way, Da Qiao asked a few times, but Huo Chi kept his mouth shut and didn't say anything. In the end, Da Qiao could do nothing.After sneaking into West Wood, Da Qiao took out two white rabbit candies from her schoolbag, handed one to Huo Chi, and said, \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, after eating candy you'll be happy.\"Huo Chi looked at white rabbit candy in her palm and felt more and more depressed.Most people can't eat one of white rabbit all year round, while Da Qiao can eat it often as well as give it to him.His mom was right, if he continued to stay here, the distance between them would get bigger and bigger. Even if Da Qiao was willing to interact with him, he wouldn't have the face to appear in front of her.He imagined about when he grow up; Da Qiao became a teacher and he is picking dung in the production team with rattan baskets...The picture was so 'beautiful' that he instantly broke out in a cold sweat!Seeing that he didn't take white rabbit, Da Qiao forced the candy onto him: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, is there something on your mind? Tell me, I might be able to help you! I'm considerate and caring little cutie!\"When Huo Chi heard what she said toward the end, he finally couldn't help laughing: \"Okay, considerate and caring little cutie, if I say... I will be leaving the production team soon, will, will, you be sad?\"Da Qiao was startled. Her eyes widened: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, you are leaving the production team. Where are you going?\"She heard from her grandfather about Elder Brother Huo Chi's family coming up from the farm. She didn't know what kind of place the farm was before, so her grandfather told her in detail.After hearing this, she felt very sad. She didn't expect Elder Brother Huo Chi to have it so hard before. What made it even more unbearable was that her grandfather had almost been taken to the farm!So in her heart, the word farm was equivalent to hell.Huo Chi felt a little better when he saw Da Qiao being worried and sad for him. Still, he insisted on asking, \"So will you be sad?\"Da Qiao's little head nodded: \"Yes, I will be very sad. Elder Brother Huo Chi, don't worry. I'll ask my grandmother to see if she has a way to keep you from being sent back!\"Huo Chi was a little stunned: \"Sent back? Sent back to where?\"Da Qiao blinked her long eyelashes and replied, \"Send back to the farm? Isn't that what Elder Brother Huo Chi mean just now?\"Huo Chi didn't know whether to laugh or cry: \"No. We aren't getting sent back to the farm. What's more, it's not the whole family leaving. Only me leaving.\"Da Qiao's big almond eyes blinked. There was a big question mark in those big eyes.Huo Chi took in her reaction; she was like a silly rabbit in a daze. So cute and playful. He couldn't help reaching out and pinch her face. He didn't exert much force though.Da Qiao had a good temper with people she knew. Even if she was pinched, she didn't get angry. She foolishly sent her face over; as if fearing that others won't be able to pinch her.Huo Chi felt she was silly. But he didn't know why he felt his heart soft.Then he told Da Qiao about the message Colonel Wang brought over: to fake death and then changing his name and following him to the army. At the end, he reminded her: \"You can only know about this matter. You must not tell anyone else, understand?\"Da Qiao nodded like a pecking chick and obediently complied: \"I understand. I won't tell others. But Elder Brother Huo Chi, I can't even tell my grandfather and my grandmother, right?\"In her heart, her grandfather and her grandmother were the people she trust the most. She didn't want to keep any secrets from them.Last time she inadvertently exposed the existence of the koi jade pendant in front of her grandmother. Later, her grandmother asked her. But her response was the same as before. No matter how anxious she was, she couldn't say anything.Later, her grandmother stopped asking. Just reminded her that no matter how anxious she was in the future, she couldn't expose the existence of koi jade pendant in front of outsiders, not even her parents.Huo Chi pondered about it and replied, \"Your grandfather and grandmother can know. Other than them, no one else can!\"Da Qiao smiled with crescent eyes and nodded her little head: \"Okay, I will only tell my grandfather and grandmother. No one else!\"Huo Chi found that his hands were itchy again from the sight of her obedient appearance: \"Do you think I should go?\"Da Qiao thought for a while and answered, \"En. Although I am reluctant to part like Grandpa Huo and Auntie Fang, I think you should go, Elder Brother Huo Ci.\"Huo Chi raised his eyebrows: \"This way, you won't be able to see me in the future. And I won't be able to make straw hens for you every year!\"Da Qiao softly spoke: \"But when Elder Brother Huo Chi goes to the army, he can go to school like my cousins and I. Also, when you miss me, you can ask Uncle Wang to help you send me a letter. I will reply to you. I have money!\"She was now a little rich woman. She had saved a small treasury of three yuan and can buy a lot of stamps!Huo Chi: \"...\"Alright. Another thing that frustrated him; he had no money. He can't even take out a penny!\"I understand. I will go back and tell my grandfather and mom that I will go. But Qiao Nian Nian, you must not forget me. If I don't reply to you, you must still write to me!\"When he goes to the army, he will find a way to help people with work and earn some change. This way, he can buy stamps and send letters back.It was just that he can't guarantee the situation over there. So he had to notify Da Qiao in advance.Da Qiao obediently acknowledged, \"Okay, I will write letters to Elder Brother Huo Chi!\"After speaking, the two pinky-swear.The sun slanted westward and the sky gradually darkened. Although the two little one had endless things to say, they could only hurry out.After coming out of West Wood, the two made an appointment two days later to cook chicken for the last time in West Wood....After Wang Yan Sheng came back, he had been looking for opportunities to meet Qiao Hong Xia alone. Finally, he found an opportunity.\"Hong Xia.\" Wang Yan Sheng stepped out from behind the wolfberry tree and stared at her with hot gaze.Wolfberry tree was categorize as a shrub. Generally. it can grow to half a meter or one meter high. The wolfberry tree cultivated in later generations can grow to two meters. The production team's wolfberry trees didn't reach two meters. Still, they were taller than ordinary wolfberry trees. From visual inspection should be about one meter fifty.This growth was completely beyond everyone's imagination. Even Huo Hua Qing was shocked at the time. He didn't understand why the production team's wolfberry tree would grow so well.Research after research, it can only be attributed to production team's fertile land being conducive to the growth of wolfberry trees.This was a very important and gratifying thing for the production team and Huo Family.If wolfberry can really develop, they will stabilize in the production team in the future.When Wang Yan Sheng proposed to let everyone change to grow wolfberry, only eight of the two hundred households in the production team agreed. This included his three brothers and Qiao's two households.In other words, out of the rest of the production team, only three households followed suit.After the replanting, the eight households stopped growing green vegetables and other beans. Sometimes, when they wanted to eat those, they had to exchange things with the production team.At that time, there were people who said all kinds of sarcastic things.Now, everyone can see that the wolfberry tree was growing tall and good. The wolfberry fruit that it bears had gradually matured. Since May, the wolfberry had been blooming and fruiting. Batches after batches had been harvested.The resulting wolfberry fruit was soft in color and full of flesh. Even people who weren't expert can see that this was an excellent wolfberry fruit.What's more, wolfberry leaves can also be picked off to cook and eat. It was said that eating them was good for the eyes.The people in the production team became envious one after another. Many went to Wang Shui Sheng's house and declared that they would also switch to growing wolfberry.However, Wang Shui Sheng didn't agree. Instead, said that he would report it to the community. If the community agreed, he would plant a large number of this crop when the time come.Because the wolfberry tree was tall and dense, Qiao Hong Xia didn't see anyone inside when she came over. She was so frightened that she almost screamed.Wang Yan Sheng didn't expect to scare his sweetheart, so he hurried over: \"Don't be afraid, Hong Xia. It's me!\"Qiao Hong Xia took a closer look before breathing a sigh of relief. She gave him an pointed look and said, \"You really gave me a scare. Why did you hide in such a place?\"Wang Yan Sheng fixed his eyes on her face and spoke in a low voice, \"I want to see you.\"Qiao Hong Xia's face instantly turned red, like a ripe red apple. Her cheeks were crimson. Very attractive.Wang Yan Sheng couldn't even turn his eyes away.He had the urge to hug her tightly into his arms: \"Hong Xia, you are so pretty!\"Qiao Hong Xia's face was so red that she could fry an egg. Her ears and neck also turned red. Her gaze didn't dare to raise to look at him. She refuted: \"Don't say it! If people heard, I won't forgive you! \"These words was really embarrassing. If someone heard it, how will she meet people in the future?Wang Yan Sheng responded: \"I have seen it when I came here, and there is no one around!\"Qiao Hong Xia felt shy and speechless. What she meant was for him to not say anything. Not if there was anyone present. Even if no one, not allowed to say it!She moved away while picking wolfberry leaves. But wherever she went, Wang Yan Sheng would be close to her.His body was like a hot iron. She could feel his heat through his clothes. She took two steps back as if she had been burned.Unexpectedly, her big stride didn't her wired state. With a turn of her step, she was about to fall to the ground.Wang Yan Sheng took one step closer and stretched out his hand to pull her. The basket in her hand fell to the ground, while he hugged her whole body!The two were close to each other; no gap between them.Qiao Hong Xia felt that she was about to burn up: \"You, you let me go!\"Wang Yan Sheng didn't let go, but instead held her even tighter: \"Hong Xia, you are so wonderful.\"His arms were like iron, tightly hugging her slender waist.The next moment, he gave her a quick peck on the face before letting her go.He wanted her very much, but the two weren't married yet. He couldn't do anything to bring her shame.Qiao Hong Xia blushed so hard. She kicked him before turning around and run away. Halfway through her run, she couldn't help turn around and scolded, \"Rogue!\"Wang Yan Sheng touched his hot ears with an embarrassed expression flashing pass his face.After she left, he recalled the scene just now. He couldn't help but let out a toothy grin again.He really hoped to get married soon. But his dad passed away. The date of their marriage had to be delayed again.Seeing that she ran away without the basket, Wang Yan Sheng had no choice but to pick up the basket and pick up all the wolfberry leaves before sending it back to Qiao's house.When he sent it back, it went without saying he didn't see Qiao Hong Xia again.While Qiao Hong Xia's sister-in-law, Lin Hui looked at him with a playful look. It seemed that he could only 'run away' in the end....In order to give something as a souvenir to Elder Brother Huo Chi, Da Qiao had been embroidering for a good few days.She knew that Elder Brother Huo Chi liked her embroidery, so she embroidered Elder Brother Huo Chi, herself, and Gu Gu again. The two of them and a chicken were roasted chicken in West Wood.Gu Gu: ?She also wrote a letter to him in advance and asked him to open it after he arrived in the army.Huo Chi felt warmth when he received the gift from her. But when he saw the embroidered handkerchief, he couldn't help sputter.If Gu Gu could speak, she would definitely be unable to resist berating.There were too few things he can take out. But after this period of research, he had been able to weave twelve zodiac signs. So this time he gave Da Qiao the grass-woven twelve zodiac signs.When Da Qiao saw these straw-woven animals, he liked them very much.She held her zodiac rabbit and said, \"This is me. A soft and cute rabbit.\"Then she picked up a cow. She pointed at him and remarked, \"This is you, stubborn old yellow cow!\"Huo Chi: \"...\"Why didn't he find out before that Da Qiao could choke people to death out of the blue?Was this the characteristic of Qiao Family?One must know that Da Qiao's Eldest Aunt always get retorted by her man and she often jumped with anger. It was pretty much a normal scene for the production team.There was also Da Qiao's elder cousin brother who had inherited this feature perfectly. Amazingly from time to time, his speech was gob-smacking.Still, he didn't like Da Qiao becoming like this. He reached out and grabbed the little rabbit in her hand and stated, \"Give the rabbit to me. You keep the old yellow cow!\"Da Qiao blinked her eyes and said, \"Why? I don't like the old yellow cow. I like rabbits!\"Huo Chi harrumphed: \"No reason. The rabbit is mine anyway!\"Da Qiao's face bulged with anger: \"Elder Brother Huo Chi, you are really domineering!\"Huo Chi didn't speak. He insisted on not giving her the rabbit. In the end, Da Qiao could give up.Afterward, the two had a roast chicken. The next day, Huo Family reported to the production team that their grandson fell into the river and was washed away by the water!In order to act this scene, Huo Hua Qing and Dai Shu Fang went all out. They sobbed and screamed; vividly interpreting the loss of a child.If placed in modern times, the best actor and actress must be them!Although the people in the production team look down on the wicked ones, everyone didn't want something to happen to them as they will rely on these wicked ones to guide the production team on growing wolfberry.Therefore, everyone put down their work to help with the search. After searching for a long time, no living person was found. Neither was a body.Some people assumed the child had been swept by the current to far far away, while some people thought the child may had been dragged to the bottom of the water by the aquatic plants. Anyway, no matter which scenario, there was no rescue.Huo Hua Qing and Dai Shu Fang cried as if the sky was collapsing. Then both passed out.Wang Shui Sheng had to send them back to the pigsty and said that they were allowed to rest for a day.Most of the people in the production team were simple people. Seeing them like this, they all shook their heads in pity.Over at Qiao Family's side. Da Qiao had told her grandparents in advance. No one else knew.After learning Huo Family's misfortune, they were shocked and in disbelief. They felt sorry for Huo Family.An Ping said, \"Why that kid... Doesn't he usually know how to swim?\"An Ping didn't like Huo Chi at first, because he was afraid that he would teach Younger Sister Da Qiao bad things. But as he got along, he felt that this person wasn't bad and accepted the other. Occasionally, they played together.Never expect the other party to die like this!Lin Hui was soft-hearted. She couldn't help but wipe her tears a few times when she thought about it. She took a lot of things to Huo Family in the pigsty and gave her condoloences.Huo Family was very grateful to Qiao Family, but they dared not show it on the surface. They can only keep up the sorrowful act all the time.That night, Wang Yan Sheng and Huo Chi quietly left the production team.Long nights meant many were dreaming. If they left during the day, they will definitely be seen.Once they exit the production team, Huo Chi couldn't help but look back in the direction of the pigsty and Qiao's house. His eyes gradually turned red.Wang Yan Sheng patted him on the shoulder and spoke, \"Let's go. When you have the ability in the future, you will definitely not regret today's decision!\"Huo Chi didn't know if he would regret it, but he couldn't go back now he taken this road.He had to be a man above others so his family won't be looked down upon forever!And he had to 'repay the debt' to Da Qiao. So he must have the ability!In the pigsty, Huo Hua Qing and Dai Shu Fang had already burst into tears.Spring and autumn came and went. Time slipped by like flowing water and a year had passed in a blink of an eye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was autumn once again.In the field, the sorghum and its heavy ears swayed with the wind, like a red wave passing by. On the other end, the wolfberry were also ripe. The plump wolfberry dotted like rubies in midst of the green leaves.Today's Qili production team was very lively because Wang Family's third lad was going to marry Qiao Family's third girl.Three three get nine. Everyone merrily remarked that the two of them will definitely last a long time!Over the past year, Qili production had undergone great changes.First of all, half of the land in the production team was replanted with wolfberry. The wolfberry was a product that can be used for both medicine and food. It was more valuable than grain. Now one work point was worth 6 penny. After a month, a diligent family can get 20 yuan.20 yuan wasn't comparable to a salary. In the past, no matter how hard one worked, they could get seven or eight yuan a month at most. When other production teams knew about it, they were all envious.Because wolfberry wasn't a grain, it wasn't suitable for large-scale cultivation at present. So it was useless for other production teams to be jealous.The production team got money and a lot of tile-roofed houses got built in the village. That's right. The production team already had its own primary school. The children of the nearby production team came here to study due to convenience.All of this was due to Wang Family's old Third proposing the idea of grow Chinese herbal medicine. Otherwise, how could they have this current life?Remembering that they didn't trust old Third Wang at the time, everyone still felt a little guilty. So now that he was going to get married, almost the entire production team came to help.As for Qiao Family, they had become more and more prosperous. It was heard that they had bought a house in the town. How envious!In midst of the chatter and laughter, a child shouted: \"He's here. Here comes the groom!\"Everyone rushed out to take a look. My oh my, it was a SUV vehicle driving toward Qiao's house!Oh my goddess. When Qiao Zhen Jun borrowed a bicycle when he married Lin Hui was enough to envy about. Never thought that old Third Wang would actually use a car when he married his wife!There were people who were so envious that acid bubbled in their hearts; thinking how they were all from the same village and it was only a short distance away. Was it necessary to use a car?As for the necessity, no-one know. Anyway, it gave more face!The SUV stopped in front of Qiao's yard and Wang Yan Sheng got out of the car.He was wearing a green military uniform, which made him tall and heroic.All the young girls were green-eyed with envy. How could such a perfect man not belong to them?Da Zhi stood in the crowd and watched Wang Yan Sheng. So jealous that her fingernails were pinched into the flesh of her palm.She was filled with hate!This man was simply blind. He actually set his eyes on a broken shoe and didn't even give her, a heavenly celestial from the city, a proper look. If he had chosen her, she wouldn't have been forced to marry that beast, Gou Sheng!The last time she saw Wang Yan Sheng, she vomited in front of him. It was later confirmed that she was indeed pregnant. She was pregnant for ten month and gave birth to a son. She didn't like that child though!She felt that the child was a testimony to her shame. So from the time the child was born to the present, she was unwilling to hold him!What made her even more devastated was that her waist's weight gain from the pregnancy. She can't lose that weight!Wang Yan Sheng keenly noticed that there was a gaze on him and glanced at the crowd. Soon, he turned back and led a group of brothers to Qiao's house.When they got to the door, they were stopped. It wasn't Qiao Hong Xia's brothers who stopped them, but Qiao Family's children soldiers!Like a hen protecting her chicks, An Ping opened his arms and said loudly, \"This tree is open by me. This tree is planted by me. If you want to marry my aunt, leave the money to buy Aunt!\"When everyone heard this messy poetry, they all burst into laughter.Qiao Dong Ying kicked him from the back and reprimanded, \"What embarrassment? You don't listen when I tell you to read more and eat less!\"An Ping rubbed his butt and replied, \"Second Elder Sister, reading more and eating aren't in conflict at all!\"In order to send this army of children away, Wang Yan Sheng was very generous; he gave each child five dimes. Even the twins who had just learned to walk got a share!After getting the money, Qiao Dong Ying gave an order and all the children made way.Da Qiao stood aside. Each hands held a small dumpling. Her fair and tender showed a sweet smile.Although she smiled sweetly, she wasn't very happy in her heart.One was due to Elder Brother Huo Chi. He originally promised to come back but was told that he couldn't come back before he set off.According to Uncle Wang, this was Elder Brother Huo Chi's own good. After all, he changed his identity. The more low-key the better. If he came back and got discovered, then everyone will be in trouble.Secondly, after Third Aunt got married, she would soon go to the army with Younger Brother Yi Ming. Grandmother said that it was called accompanying the army. She might come back once a year at most.She can't bear to part with Third Aunt. Even more so with Younger Brother Yi Ming. When Younger Brother Yi Ming know, don't know how much tantrum he'll throw!Wang Yan Sheng entered the main room and bowed to his parent-in-laws: \"Dad, Mom, I'm here to pick up Hong Xia!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi looked at him and her voice boomed, \"I hand my daughter over to you. Remember what you promised us. If you can't do it, no matter how high you climb in the future, I won't let you go!\"Wang Yan Sheng thought of his mother-in-law's iron fist and quickly affirmed with a serious face: \"Dad, Mom, please rest assured. I will definitely treat Hong Xia and her son well!\"Talking too much was useless. Time will prove everything. From the current point of view, Wang Yan Sheng's character seem very reassuring.Qiao Hong Xia and Wang Yan Sheng did the bow to parents. Before heading out the door, an incident happened.\"I can't marry you!\"As soon as these words came out, everyone burst into laughter again.Because the person who said this wasn't Qiao Hong Xia, but her son little Yi Ming!At this moment, little Yi Ming had his hands crossed at his chest. His little face was puffed up as he stared up at the tall and majestic Wang Yan Sheng with his two small eyes. His expression showed he meant business.Wang Yan Sheng couldn't hold back his laughter. He squatted down and had a serious conversation with the little man: \"It isn't you who marry me. It's your mom who marry me. I will be your dad from now on.\"Little Yi Ming exclaimed with a look of surprise: \"I'm not marrying you? Then don't I have to go with you?\"Wang Yan Sheng explained: \"You'll marry a wife in the future. Although you aren't marrying me, you have to follow me.\"Little Yi Ming shook his head like a rattle: \"No, I can't go with you. I want to follow my elder sister!\"\"Yi Ming, aren't you coming with Mom? You don't want Mom?\"Qiao Hong Xia couldn't help but feel helpless when she heard this. She had communicated with her son for a long time before. She was still communicating until last night. Unexpectedly, he would regret it when it was time to get into the\u00a0sedan chair!Little Yi Ming sent glances between his mom and Elder Sister Da Qiao. Immediately, he was caught in a dilemma.He had it hard!In order to not delay the auspicious time, Qiao Xiu Zhi got them to head out first. Little Yi Ming was staying at Qiao's house tonight. Anyway, the two families lived so close together.Don't belittle little Yi Ming's young age. He was very assertive. If he didn't like somethings, it was useless to force him. In the end, Qiao Hong Xia can only follow Wang Yan Sheng by herself....The bride was picked up. The spectators also followed over to Wang's house.After a lively morning, Qiao's old house became quiet.Qin Xiao Mei came out of the inner room with a baby in her arms. She spoke to Qiao Xiu Zhi, \"The new son-in-law displayed such great fanfare. It shows that he really values Hong Xia in his heart. Auntie Xiu Zhi, you don't have to worry in the future.\"Dong Xue came out slowly behind her. She too was holding a baby in her embrace.Hearing Qin Xiao Mei's words, she repeatedly nodded: \"Yes. A talented man and a beautiful woman are a good match. When they come back next year, they might be able to bring back another grandchild for Auntie Xiu Zhi!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi merrily responded: \"They decide whether to have more children or not. I only hope that they will grow old together!\"The two ladies stated they will.Qin Xiao Mei and Dong Xue were found to be pregnant on the same day. Coincidentally, their babies were born on the same day and both were boys.Everyone in the world loved sons, but for the two of them, they were looking forward to a sweet and considerate\u00a0little padded jacket.Needless to say, Qin Xiao Mei. She wished to the stars and the moon and had been waiting for so many years to finally get pregnant. Everyday, she called the baby in her womb 'daughter'. She even took Da Qiao to take pictures. Afterward, she fantasized about a daughter in front of Da Qiao's photos every day.It was a pity that it was born with a handle. No need to describe how disappointed she was.Dong Xue felt the same. The death of her previous daughter was a thorn in her heart. She always hoped that her daughter could be reborn in her womb. Although she knew that her in-laws wanted a grandson more, she privately wanted a daughter.In the past year, Shen Family and Chu Family were very grateful to Qiao Family and Da Qiao. So they had maintained close contact.Shen Family lived close by. From time to time they drove over to the production team or took Qiao Family's children to the town to play.Even when Dong Xue had a child of her own, she still loved her goddaughter, little Wan-er. She often sent things over. If it was clothes, she will definitely prepare an extra set for Da Qiao.Wan Chun Ju was extremely dissatisfied with Chu Family's approach!Little Wan-er was her goddaughter. It was normal for her to gift little Wan-er something. But why prepare an extra set to gift to Da Qiao?Since she had gift Da Qiao, why not prepare four more for her children?From Wan Chun Ju's point of view, Shen Family and Chu Family were deliberately excluding their first branch and looked down on their first branch!Although Shen Family and Chu Family were doing well financially, they weren't rich enough to do whatever they want.If eldest branch was given, then the other children must be gifted too. There were ten children in Qiao Family in total. This number was too huge. Their wallets can't bear it.Therefore, no matter how dissatisfied Wan Chun Ju was, they will not\u00a0slap faces to make themselves fat!The few women were conversing when they saw Shen Shi Kai walking in from outside. He jollily spoke, \"Auntie, I'm so sorry for being late!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi smilingly responded: \"It's not too late. The banquet hasn't started yet. You've come just in time!\"The police station's performance in the previous year was superb. The chief was promoted to the police station in the county. Shen Shi Kai took his position. That was to say, Shen Shi Kai was currently the town police station's chief!As the chief, the tasks on his shoulders were heavier. He managed to find time after much difficulty today to attend the wedding banquet.Chu Tian Bai didn't have time to come this time. Only Dong Xue came to participate with their son.Shen Shi Kai came over and said, \"Auntie, this time I went to Hu City to do business and saw someone on the road.\"\"Who?\" Qiao Xiu Zhi raised her eyebrows, \"Could... it be that you saw Xiao Qiao?\"Hearing Qiao Xiu Zhi's response, Qin Xiao Mei and Dong Xue were both shocked.They also knew about the disappearance of Da Qiao's twin younger sister.It was just that there had been no news for more than a year. It was heard that the child's character wasn't good. So it was a problem to find the child back. Not finding her back also couldn't do.Shen Shi Kai nodded: \"It should be her. When I was passing People's Street, I noticed a black car driving past. With a turn of a head, a little girl in the back seat and I looked at each other. I thought I was seeing Da Qiao then. But it was definitely impossible for Da Qiao to appear in Hu City. So she should be Xiao Qiao. I originally wanted to chase after, but someone on the other end got stolen by a thief. I had to go to catch the thief. After handling that, the car was long gone. \"Qiao Xiu Zhi was solemn for a moment before answering, \"Did she see you?\"Shen Shi Kai nodded: \"She should had. I noticed a shocked expression on her face.\"What he didn't say was that the child was really strange. At the age of eight, she controlled her expression in an instant. Her face changed so quickly that she put many adults to shame!Qiao Xiu Zhi stated, \"So she saw you but didn't stop the car, right?\"Shen Shi Kai confirmed again.Qiao Xiu Zhi said, \"Since she chose it herself, let her be.\"She didn't like this granddaughter, Xiao Qiao. She felt that she was too scheming. After listening to Fang Xiao Juan's words, she didn't like her more and more.But no matter how she dislike her, she was still had the blood of Qiao Family. So for more than a year, she often asked Shen Shi Kai to ask the police station over in Hu City to look around despite not personally search for her like she did with little Wan-er.In the past, there had been no news.This news brought by Shen Shi Kai indicated the child wasn't kidnapped. But for some unknown reason, she was adopted by a wealthy family.At that time, she recognized Shen Shi Kai but pretended not to know. Which meant that she didn't want to come back to Qiao's house at all. If she was kidnapped, she would try her best to rescue this granddaughter even if she didn't like this granddaughter.But now, it was clear she didn't want to come back. So be it.Although Shen Family and Chu Family were Qiao Family's god-relatives, this was Qiao Family's business. Naturally, they can't really interfere.Besides, that child was really unpleasant. Since they knew was fine, the current situation may be the best choice for both parties.Afterward, everyone went to Wang's house for the banquet.Three days later, Qiao Hong Xia took her son little Yi Ming and followed Wang Yan Sheng to the army.Wang Yan Sheng's marriage report had been typed out long ago. In order to make him feel at ease in the army and not take a leave of absence every so often, the army approved his family accompanying report in advance.Little Yi Ming didn't want to follow him. He chose his elder sister Da Qiao after a difficult dilemma. It made Qiao Hong Xia helpless and a little sad.In the end, Da Qiao persuaded him. She secretly handed him two letters and some food. She requested him to help bring it to the army to Huo Chi.In order to complete his elder sister's mission, little Yi Ming had no choice but to aggrievedly nod and agree. He thought he would come back soon after completing his 'mission'....After Qiao Hong Xia joined the army, another thing happened to Qiao Family- Qiao Zhen Min brought a match back.The girl he brought back was named Shi Qin Xin, who was introduced to him by the director of the transport team he worked for. It was said to be the director's cousin's niece.Shi Qin Xin wasn't young. She had been divorced once. Qiao Zhen min didn't mind that. He had been divorced himself. What qualifications did he have to dislike someone else for being divorced?In fact, he hoped that the other party was divorced. Because they both were divorced, neither can dislike the other. Those who have been divorced should cherish their hard-won new feelings even more.It was heard that she had been pregnant before, but she was miscarried due to her ex-husband. That was the reason for the divorce.He had interacted with the other party for a while and felt that she was gentle and open. What's more, she liked children very much. She didn't care about him having a child at all. Instead, she was looking forward to seeing little Wan-er.So after two months of acquainting, he decided to take her home to show his parents.If it was suitable, they can get married this year. When the time come, he can take his daughter to live in the county.He wasn't worried that his daughter would be bullied at home. His parents took good care of little Wan-er. Still, he hoped that his daughter could grow up by his side.When Qiao Zhen Min brought Shi Qin xin back to the production team, the villagers were working in the fields. So everyone noticed them as soon as they arrived.Everyone's eyes were like spotlights. All were focusing on Shi Qin Xin as if they wished they could see a hole in her!\"Old Fifth Qiao, you're going home? Who is the girl beside you? Is she your family's god-relayive?\"Although everyone didn't know the specific identity of little Wan-er's godparents, they can tell they weren't ordinary people just by their clothes. So the entire production team knew Qiao Family had two great god-families. They were envious.Qiao Zhen Min smilingly greeted everyone and openly introduced: \"It's not a god-relative. It's my match.\"When the people heard this, they were in an uproar.Qiao Family's life had become more and more prosperous. Qiao Zhen Min was the most capable one among them. And he had no son under his knees. This was a tempting treat in eight townships!So since he divorced Chen Qiao Qiao, people would go to Qiao's house from time to time to introduce him to someone. But they were all declined by Qiao Xiu Zhi.Qiao Xiu Zhi had freedom in love at the time. She fancied Xue Chuan. So she had been very democratic on the few children's marriage choice since the beginning.The person who spend a lifetime with the match was the children themselves. Not them, the parents. So as long as the person they like wasn't too bad, neither she nor Xue Chuan will object.That was the case with Wan Chun Ju. Before she entered the door, they knew that her temperament wasn't superb. But compared with Fang Family, Wan Family got decent characters. So she didn't prevent Qiao Zhen Guo from marrying Wan Chun Ju.The only one she stopped was Fang Xiao Juan, but was unsuccessful.Now the production team heard Qiao Zhen Min say the girl was his match, everyone felt it was a pity. Many girls who wanted to marry into Qiao Family were heartbroken.How come it was never their turn when good men appear?Seeing that Qiao Zhen Min didn't hide it, Shi Qin Xin felt sweetness, She lowered her head and showed a shy smile at the corner of her mouth.Seeing Qiao Zhen Min bring a match back, Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan asked a leave from the production team leader.As soon as the two of them entered the door, Shi Qin Xin immediately stood up from the seat and attentively ran over: \"Uncle, Auntie, you're back? I'll go get you water to wash your face and wash your hands!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi wanted to refuse, but the other party had already turned and ran away. However, halfway through, she embarrassedly turned around. She didn't know where to fetch water and which tub was the two's.Many families shared a wooden basin because they were too poor. While Qiao Family never did this. They tried to separate the stuff as much as possible.Qiao Xiu Zhi walked over and spoke, \"There's no need for you. You are a guest. Just go in and sit inside.\"An awkward smile appeared on Shi Qin Xin's face. She no longer insist.But when it was time to cook lunch, she took the initiative to help in the kitchen. Although her actions were a bit clumsy, she wasn't a heiress that never did spring cleaning.After that, Shi Qin Xin ate at Qiao's house and stayed at Qiao's small house for one night. During that time, she came into contact with little Wan-er.Over the past year, Da Qiao had been feeding little Wan-er with jade beads every day. So her autism symptoms had improved a lot. But compared with ordinary children, she was still very timid and introverted. At least she can communicate with people normally.Shi Qin Xin was very patient with little Wan-er and seemed to like little Wan-er very much. As soon as she saw her, she wanted to hug her. She even took out the gifts she brought to please her.It was a pity that little Wan-er didn't buy it. She didn't let Shi Qin Xin hold her. Nor did she want the gift she brought.She clung to Elder Sister Da Qiao's hand tightly; clearly expressing her repulsion to this unfamiliar woman.Da Qiao had to softly comfort her; telling her that Shi Qin Xin would be her mom in the future.When little Wan-er heard the word 'mom', she inaudibly trembled and whispered, \"Elder Sister, I don't want a mom.\"Da Qiao thought that she was afraid of stepmother hitting her. She rubbed her younger sister's head and persuaded, \"Don't worry, little Wan-er. Not all moms are bad-hearted. Look, my mom is not my biological mother. Isn't she good to me?\"Little Wan-er tilted her head for a while before nodding: \"So, she will dote me like Second Aunt?\"Da Qiao's little head bobbed: \"Yes. Our little Wan-er is so cute and beautiful. Who wouldn't like you?\"When little Wan-er heard her elder sister's compliment, she pursed her lips and smiled shyly.Later, Shi Qin Xin came to please her again. Little Wan'er didn't repulse her like the first time.Shi Qin Xin stayed at Qiao's house for three days and two nights. She was generous and easy-going. Toward little Wan-er, she was patient. She unanimously received 'verification' from all Qiao Family except Wan Chun Ju.Wan Chun Ju didn't like Shi Qin Xin. She felt she was hypocritical. She was so attentive before she married in. How much did she wish to marry?Also, she felt that the other party's buttering up to little Wan-er was definitely not out of sincerity. She faked it in order to marry Qiao Zhen Min!However, her opinion didn't matter. Even when she mumbled that her dislike, no one listened to her.It wasn't everyone's fault. Wan Chun Ju had never liked any of her of sister-in-laws. From Fang Xiao Juan to Chen Qiao Qiao to Lin Hui to the current Shi Qin Xin, she never liked any of them!So if Qiao Zhen Min listened to her opinion, he might as well stay as a bachelor for the rest of his life!And at this stage, they had already met the parents. Everyone knew they were in a relationship. As long as the other party didn't have too many problems, they will marry by default. If not, it will cause great damage to the other party's reputation.After returning to the county, Qiao Zhen Min took the marriage gift to Shi Family to seek for marriage approval.Shi Family didn't make any excessive demands. The two returned to his hometown in November to hold a wedding banquet and get married.After getting married, Qiao Zhen Min took little Wan'er to the county to live with him.In the beginning, the newlywed life was as sweet as honey mixed with oil.Qiao Zhen Min cherished this new marriage. Except for business trips, the rest of the time was reserved for his small family.Shi Qin Xin treated little Wan-er wonderfully. Everything started to change after half a year of marriage.Shi Qin Xin was pregnant.She had to do housework as well as taking care of the child by herself. In addition, the morning sickness was very serious. So she proposed to send little Wan-er back to the production team and bring her back after she gave birth to the child.But before little Wan-er could be sent back, something happened to Shi Qin Xin. and she fell and had a miscarriage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQiao Zhen Min was delivering goods when he was notified about his wife being sent to the hospital.His face turned pale with fright. He quickly asked what happened.Unfortunately, the one who came to inform him was a ten-year-old child. He didn't know what happened. The adults told him to come.After making sure little Wan-er was at the neighbor's house, he hurried to the hospital. Only then, he found out things were more serious than he thought.Shi Qin Xin had a miscarriage and their two-month-old baby was gone.Indescribable sadness emerged in Qiao Zhen Min's heart.He was assaulted at that man part by a gangster before and thought that he would never have any more children in his life. Later, after his divorce with Chen Qiao Qiao, he didn't plan to marry again.Don't know what happened. His body got better day by day. That male area had a normal reaction in the morning. This was why he will later agree to his director's matchmaking. If he wasn't good there, he will definitely not marry again.Last month, Shi Qin Xin was diagnosed with a month or so pregnancy. His eyes were almost red with joy.After having that kind of disease, one can't talk to people or treat it. As a man, it was natural to feel inferior. The arrival of this baby had washed away all his inferiority and shame.So he was looking forward to the arrival of this baby. Unexpectedly,...He stood outside the ward for a long time before he was mental prepared and ready to pushed the door in.When Shi Qin Xin saw him, her just-stabilized emotion became agitated again. She stared at him with tears in her eyes: \"Zhen Min...\"Mother Shi turned her around and exclaimed, \"You're finally here. I have comforted her for a few hours. She has been crying and crying. It's better to leave her to you.\"Qiao Zhen Min hurriedly thanked his mother-in-law.When she reached the door, Mother Shi suddenly stopped. She turned to Qiao Zhen Min and spoke, \"Come out. Mom has something to tell you.\"As soon as these words came out, Qiao Zhen Min had yet to react when he heard Shi Qin Xin anxiously cry out: \"Mom, you...\"Mother Shi turned to her daughter and assured, \"Don't worry, Mom has a sense of limit.\"Qiao Zhen Min sensed the pair's strange attitude. A bad feeling surged in his heart. He nodded, \"Okay.\"Then he walked out of the ward with Mother Shi.Shi Qin Xin watched their back as her hands tightly grasped the sheet. So nervous that the veins on the back of her hands were showing.Mother Shi walked to the small garden outside before stopping and sitting down on the stone stool. She spoke \"You sit down too. Don't stand or I will feel uncomfortable staring up at you as we talk.\"Qiao Zhen Min sat down a seat width away from her.Mother Shi said, \"You two aren't young. Logically, you should have a child. I was extremely happy when you guys were pregnant after half a year of marriage. Never thought...oh.\"Qiao Zhen Min responded, \"It's my fault. I didn't take good care of Qin Xin!\"Mother Shi was very satisfied with his attitude: \"This can't blame you. You are busy with work. How can you stay at home to take care of Qin Xin. Even if you want to suspend work and stay at home, I wouldn't agree. I just feel sorry for my poor daughter. You know that she had a miscarriage before, right?\"Qiao Zhen Min nodded: \"I know.\"\"Miscarriage hurt the body too much. One time, two times. If it become habitual, it will be troublesome!\" Mother Shi led the conversation to this and observed him. Her tone suddenly took a turn, \"If Qin Xin's miscarriage this time is accidental, it would be alright. But\u2026\"Qiao Zhen Min raised his brows: \"Mom, what do you mean by that? Isn't Qin Xin's miscarriage an accident?\"Mother Shi's eyes flickered: \"Little Wan-er didn't do it on purpose. It's normal for a child to be unruly at this age. Don't scold the child when you go back. Still Zhen Min, don't blame Mom for intervening too much. If you and Qin Xin wants to have a baby, the best way is to send little Wan-er to your parents. Bring her back after little Wan-er's younger brother is born.\"Qiao Zhen Min's face instantly sank. He pursed his lips and said nothing.Seeing that he didn't object, Mother Shi pushed for a foot after getting an inch, \"Actually, it's not very stable to have one. It's better to wait until after you have given birth to a second baby before bring the child over. At that time, little Wan-er is more grown up. Perfect to have her come and help take care of younger brothers. What do you think?\"A burst of anger rose in Qiao Zhen Min's heart, almost burning out all his sanity!Though his anger reached its max, he laughed: \"My family's little Wan-er is neither a maid nor a nanny. Even if Qin Xin and I have children in the future, she doesn't need to help take care of her younger siblings.\"When Mother Shi heard what he said, she immediately became displeased: \"What's with your attitude? What's wrong with what I said just now? Which eldest doesn't need to help with the chores at home?\"Qiao Zhen Min stood up and declared, \"My family's little Wan-er don't need to!\"After he finished speaking, he ignored Mother Shi, turned and walked towards the ward.Mother Shi Mu's chest heaved with fury. Recalling Qiao Zhen Min's expression just now, she felt uneasy. She quickly picked up the things and chased after him.Qiao Zhen Min rushed into the ward. Staring at Shi Qin Xin and spoke, \"Is your miscarriage caused by little Wan-er?\"Seeing him pull a long face, Shi Qin Xin's heart thumped: \"Little Wan-er didn't do it on purpose. She...she accidentally bumped me and I fell down because I didn't stand stable. Zhen Min, did my mom tell you something?\"Qiao Zhen Min sneered: \"Don't you have any idea what your mom said to me? She asked me to send little Wan-er back to my hometown. And after we give birth to the second baby, little Wan-er would be brought back to help take care of younger siblings!\"Shi Qin Xin swallowed a mouthful of saliva. She couldn't help trembling under the sheet: \"My mom is worried about me. You know me... I have had a miscarriage before. She is worried that I may not be able have another child if it happen again... \"Qiao Zhen Min stared at her coldly: \"So you agree with Mother-in-law. You want me to send little Wan-er back, right?\"Shi Qin Xin looked at his frosted face. She wanted to shake her head, but her mouth answered first: \"Send her back for a few years. At most we will go back often to see her later... Zhen Min, I don't despise that child. I just\u2026\"\"You don't need to say it anymore!\" Qiao Zhen Min coldly interrupted her, \"Before the wedding, I told you. My reason for marriage was to find someone to take care of little Wan-er. You said you don't mind. How long have it been since we married before you regret it!?\"Shi Qin Xin's eyes were red: \"I don't regret... I...\"\"What are you doing?\" Mother Shi rushed over like an old hen protecting her chicks and smacked Qiao Zhen Min with the bag in her hand, \"Qin Xin just had a miscarriage. It's enough that don't feel distressed for her. You even yell at her. Is there a husband like you? If I knew you were like this, I shouldn't have handed my daughter over to you in the first place!\"Qiao Zhen Min let her hit without retaliation.On the contrary, Shi Qin Xin, who was leaning on the hospital bed, couldn't stand it. She cried out: \"Mom, don't hit him anymore. Mom!\"The nurse outside heard the commotion and ran over. With a black face, she warned them to stop arguing or they would all be thrown out!Only then did Mother Shi stop and panted, \"You wolf-hearted thing, my family's Qin Xin was hurt like this by your daughter. She was worried that you would blame the child and didn't want me say it. If you only have your daughter in your heart, why did you marry a wife in the first place?\"Qiao Zhen Min glanced at her before looking at pale Shi Qin Xin and spoke, \"Maybe I was wrong in the first place. Let's calm down these days. I'll give the money to get an auntie from next door to come and help take care of you.\"After saying that, he turned and left.\"Zhen Min!\" Seeing his resolute departing back, Shi Qin Xin's heart suddenly panicked.She wanted to get out of bed and chase after him but was pulled back by her mom.\"Why are you chasing? Dog man. The more you care about him, the more he rubs his nose in your face. At this time, it is best to be cold to him. Are you still worried that he will divorce you?\"Mother Shi poked her head and scolded.Mother Shi wasn't worried that Qiao Zhen Min would divorce her daughter. Divorce was a last resort in this era. No matter who was right or wrong, it would be bad for the reputation of both parties.Qiao Zhen Min had already been divorced once. Qiao Family already had three children divorced. So for the sake of reputation, he will never divorce again!Shi Qin Xin bit her lip: \"Mom, I told you not to say it at this time. You don't know how much Zhen Min love little Wan-er. He can't stand to hear anyone say anything bad about her!\"Mother Shi sat down and spoke, \"That's why you have to take this opportunity to send the child away! Otherwise, what position will you and my grandson havee in this family in the future?\"Shi Qin Xin bit her lip. Her eyes drooped. Finally, she stopped refuting.In fact, she didn't hate little Wan-er.Although the child was a bit introverted, she was well-behaved. This made adults feel at ease. So before marrying, she really wanted to treat the child as her own daughter.But after getting married and witnessing Qiao Zhen Min's love for the child, her mentality changed. Especially after hearing him say that he would buy a house for the child in the county, just like Qiao Family did for Da Qiao.A house in the county cost seventeen to eighteen hundred yuan for a two-bedroom house. If it was better, it was absolutely impossible to buy it without twenty-five hundred yuan.His current salary was thirty-five yuan. Although this was pretty good, it will take several years to save up to buy a house. The key was his attitude. Currently little Wan-er was still small and he want to buy a house for her. Then when she get married, won't he want to empty the house?What about her and their children?That was why her mom suggest her to take this opportunity to send little Wan-er to the countryside. With distance between them, the feeling would gradually fade away. She can take the opportunity to use her child to win over his heart.Her mom wanted her to have at least two babies. It would take three or four years for the two babies to be born. If it is slow, it may take five or six years. In this way, when little Wan-er comes back, their father-daughter relationship has already fade. Then there would be no worry.She admitted that she was moved by her mom's words. She didn't want to isolate little Wan-er but Qiao Zhen Min cared about her too much. If she stayed in the county, she and their future children would really have no place at all.After being persuaded by her mom, Shi Qin Xin's heart was firmed up again. She decided to give Qiao Zhen Min the cold treatment and make him send little Wan-er away!...Qiao Zhen Min sat outside for a long time. It had gotten dark when he remembered little Wan-er was still in the neighbor's house. He hurriedly stood up and went home.Once he came to the neighbor's house, he was told that little Wan-er had gone back long ago; she explained that little Wan-er had been clamoring to go back, so she could only take her back.Qiao Zhen Min was so worried in his heart that he turned around and rushed home. Before he reach home, he saw his daughter sitting by the door from afar. Her small body curled up in a ball.His heart instantly ached.\"Little Wan-er.\"He approached his daughter and called her softly.Little Wan-er raised her head. A pair of dark eyes looked at him. For a long time, she remained silent. Then she lowered her head to stare at the ground again.Qiao Zhen Min's heart dropped. He couldn't help but panic.He hadn't seen his daughter like this for a long time!He quickly picked up his daughter. Only then, he noticed her little face had been bitten a good few times by mosquitoes: \"Why didn't you stay at Auntie Li's house? Does it hurt? Dad will go back and smear it with balm.\"Still no response from Little Wan-er.Qiao Zhen Min hugged her even tighter. If his daughter changed back to before, he would never forgive himself!The main reason for his second marriage was for his daughter. He didn't want his daughter to be separated from him all the time. But his job made him unable to take care of her. Finding a partner was the best solution at the moment.Therefore, when his director introduced Shi Qin Xin to him, he didn't refuse. Before meeting Shi Qin Xin, he asked around to inquire about the other party's character and personality. Everyone said that she was gentle and open. A good girl. That was why he decided to meet her.Afterward the relationship was confirmed. Her character was indeed as gentle and generous as others said. She was very patient with children. So he made up his mind to remarry.After half a year of marriage, everything was fine. He really didn't understand how it suddenly changed!Qiao Zhen Min took his daughter home and washed her face and hands with warm water first. Then he rubbed the mosquito bites on her face with balm. Lastly, he went to get two bowls of noodles.During the whole process, little Wan-er remained silent.Once it was dinner time, Qiao Zhen Min gave her the poached egg in his bowl and spoke, \"Was little Wan-er scared today? Eat more eggs to suppress the fear.\"Little Wan-er stared at the two poached eggs in the bowl. After a moment of silence, she said quietly, \"When Mom went grocery shopping, she met a man. Don't know what that man said. Mom quarreled with him. That man pushed Mom. Mom fell. That man ran away.\"\"Once at home, Mom said she wasn't feeling well after cooking. I wanted to find Dad. Mom didn't let me go. She slipped and fell when she came to grab me. Then she was bleeding. A lot of blood...\u201dReaching this point, little Wan-er's eyes were staring straight. Her little body was visibly trembling.Qiao Zhen Min swiftly went over and held her in his arms: \"Don't be scared. Don't be scared. Dad is here. Everything will be fine.\"After a while, little Wan-er slowly calmed down.Qiao Zhen Min controlled the anger in his heart and carefully asked, \"Who is that man? Has little Wan-er met him before? And why did you know that Mom met that man?\"Little Wan-er whispered, \"I'm afraid that Mom will be tricked by kidnappers. So every time she goes shopping, I secretly follow her. I haven't seen that man before. However, Mom seems to know him.\"In little Wan-er's heart, kidnappers were the most terrifying people in the world.She liked this new mom. She was afraid of new mom getting kidnapped. That was why she secretly followed every time Mom went.Qiao Zhen Min's hands under the table clenched into fists. After a lot of effort, he suppressed his anger. He rubbed her hair and comforted, \"Don't be afraid. Mom is fine. She is now in the hospital.\"Little Wan-er looked up and asked, \"Fine?\"Qiao Zhen Min nodded: \"En, she's fine. So little Wan-er doesn't have to worry. It's not your fault that Mom bleed. She was injured when she fell the first time. Little Wan-er promise Dad this; don't blame yourself, ok?\"His little Wan-er was so well-behaved and kind. Because she was worried about Shi Qin Xin getting kidnapped, she secretly protect her every time. But what she didn't know was that the person she want to protect wanted to send her away!The most infuriating part was that her miscarriage wasn't little Wan-er's fault at all. Yet she put such a big responsibility on a four-year-old child!She clearly knew that little Wan-er was different from other children. If little Wan-er shoulder this mistake, she might become autistic again because of guilt!Shi Qin Xin couldn't be forgiven!He originally wanted everyone to calm down a bit before discussing a solution. But now it seem it was no longer necessary to maintain this marriage contract!Little Wan'er blinked her dark eyes and said, \"What about Younger Brother? Is Younger Brother okay?\"Qiao Zhen Min's throat was a little choked: \"Younger Brother was taken away by Grandma. It will take a long time before he come home. Little Wan-er misses Grandfather, Grandmother, and Elder Sister Da Qiao? Dad will take you back tomorrow to see them, okay?\"Little Wan-er's eyes lit up at once: \"Can we really?\"She missed Elder Sister so much. But Dad was too busy. She hadn't seen Elder Sister for a long time.Seeing his daughter like this, Qiao Zhen Min's heart felt more and more uncomfortable: \"Of course. You can think up with something Elder Sister Da Qiao likes first. We will buy it tomorrow. After buying it, you can take it back and give it to Elder Sister Da Qiao, okay?\"\"Okay.\" Little Wan-er curled her lips. Finally, a smile appeared on her pale little face....The next day, Qiao Zhen Min took little Wan-er to the county department store to buy a lot of things. Afterward, he took a leave of absence from the company and returned to the production team.Seeing Da Qiao, little Wan-er immediately let go of Dad's hand and flew over: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao!\"Da Qiao immediately caught her charging younger sister and smiled sweetly: \"Little Wan-er, Elder Sister misses you dearly!\"Little Wan-er also missed her elder sister very much, but she was too embarrassed to voice it out. Still, her hand tightly held Elder Sister's hand. A meek smile hung on her small lip.Then she gave the gift she brought back to Elder Sister. Da Qiao was ecstatic and took out her treasure to share with Younger Sister.The sisters kept chatting together. The scene was cute and warm.Qiao Zhen Min watched them and suddenly wondered if he really made the right decision back then to take his daughter away.When Qiao Xiu Zhi saw her son come back alone with Granddaughter, she immediately realized something was wrong.After distributing the things brought back to the children, she asked, \"Where's your wife? Why didn't she come back with you? Did something happen?\"Facing his mom's fiery eyes, Qiao Zhen Min had a feeling of being seen through: \"Mom, Qin Xin had a miscarriage yesterday.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi frowned: \"She had a miscarriage yesterday and you didn't stay by her side to take care of her. Instead, you run back. If you don't have a reasonable explanation, see how I'll sort you out!\"In Qiao Family, apart from not beating women, a man can't be a hands-off guy. Even naive Qiao Zhen Guo would piggyback his wife to the doctor, bring food, and change medicine when she was sick. He also took care of Wan Chun Ju's post-natal confinement.So now that Shi Qin Xin had a miscarriage, Qiao Zhen Min brought his daughter back. If there was no unavoidable reason, then she will definitely teach him a good lesson!Qiao Zhen Min sighed and recount to his parents what happened.He really couldn't understand whether it was because his marriage fate was too bad, or because he was too blind as found the wrong person twice in a row!After listening to Qiao Zhen Min's words, Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan exchanged glance and saw anger and helplessness in each other's eyes.They thought old Fifth would definitely be able to live in peace this time. How long was it since the wedding and something happen?It can't be getting divorced again?Divorce was a bit unreasonable because of this matter. It was normal for bumps and cracks to appear in marriage. Things didn't go one's way in eight or nine out of ten case. If everyone gets divorced at every turn, it was estimated that more than 90% of the entire production team will have already divorced.But if they don't get divorced, little Wan-er will definitely not be able to live with them. Now it was up to old Fifth to choose.Qiao Zhen Min was silent for a while, \"Dad, Mom, I want to get a divorce. From now on, I will take care of little Wan-er by myself and not get married.\"What Shi Qin Xin did was nothing compared to Chen Qiao Qiao. But she had already developed hostility toward little Wan-er. If they had children in the future, she wouldn't tolerate little Wan-er.In other words, he either sacrifice his marriage or his daughter.His choice hadn't changed since the beginning.Qiao Xiu Zhi sighed and spoke: \"Think carefully. Little Wan-er will stay at home for the time being. If you really make up your mind to get a divorce, I'm afraid you won't be able to keep this job anymore. So are sure that you have thought it through?\"Qiao Zhen Min replied in a heavy voice, \"Thought it through.\"His director was a relative of Shi Family. If he divorces Shi Qin Xin, they will definitely not let him continue to work there.He had thought of this for a long time and his decision wouldn't change.After two days at home, he returned to the county city.Shi Family had been waiting for Qiao Zhen Min to come to apologize. They didn't expect that they waited for him to say he wanted a divorce!Shi Family was furious!Shi Qin Xin's eldest brother and younger brother rushed up to beat Qiao Zhen Min, but was stopped by Father Shi.The younger brother was young and energetic. What's more, he had the best relationship with Second Elder Sister. At this time, his face was red with anger: \"Dad, why are you stopping us? This kind of scum deserve a bloody beating!\"Father Shi gave the younger son a warning stare before asking Qiao Zhen Min, \"Why did you make this decision? What did you tell us when you came to ask for marriage? You said you would take good care of Qin Xin. How long has it been since then and you want to get a divorce? Qin Xin had a miscarriage because of your daughter...\"\"Little Wan-er has nothing to do with her miscarriage!\"From entering until now, Qiao Zhen Min didn't retaliate no matter how Shi Family scolded him.Because this matter wasn't serious enough to need a divorce. Once they get divorced, it will cause great harm to Shi Qin Xin. Still, he will never allow them to continue to slander little Wan-er!Mother Shi was pissed: \"At this time, you still want to protect your daughter? Qin Xin said that she fell down after being bumped into by little Wan-er!\"Qiao Zhen Min sneered, \"So Qin Xin hasn't told you yet. She met her ex-husband on the day of her miscarriage and was pushed by him?\"\"What?\"Shi Family were shocked when they heard this!Shi Family's younger brother came back to his senses. Furious, he wanted to rush over and beat Qiao Zhen Min: \"You b*stard, don't pour dirty water on my elder sister!\"Qiao Zhen Min dodged the incoming punch and coldly stated, \"Your elder sister knows better than anyone if I pour dirty water! Also, little Wan-er never bumped into her from beginning to end. It was little Wan-er who found out she was unwell and wanted to tell me. However, Qin Xin wanted to stop her and unexpected slipped. That's why she had a miscarriage!\"Upon his plausible explanation, Shi Family couldn't help but wonder. Was it really like what he said?It was just that Daughter had divorced that beast. Why did they still meet? Why did she hid the truth of being pushed down by the other party and put the blame on a little girl?If that was the case, no wonder Son-in-law was so mad that he want to divorce!Mother Shi was also exasperated. She felt that she had been tricked by her daughter!If her daughter told her the truth, she would never have said those words to Qiao Zhen Min at that time.Yes, indeed.Little Wan'er was Qiao Zhen Min's off-limit spot. If Mother Shi and Shi Qin Xin didn't mention sending little Wan-er back to his hometown, he won't be this angry even if he knew that she miscarried due to her ex-husband.With an embarrassed smile, Mother Shi spoke, \"Zhen Min, there may be some misunderstanding in this matter. Qin Xin...\"Before she could finish speaking, she heard the door on the opposite side being opened. Shi Qin Xin appeared at the door with two lines of tears rolling from her eyes.Mother Shi was vexed and helpless in her heart. Her daughter had already divorced once. And if she divorce again, it won't be just her daughter losing decency. Their entire Shi Family wouldn't need to go out to meet people!She quickly pulled her daughter over and said, \"Why are you being in a daze? Still not coming out and explain to Zhen Min. Hurry up and say you didn't see that scumbag that day!\"Shi Qin Xin met Qiao Zhen Min's gaze. She couldn't refute.When Qiao Zhen Min saw her expression, he knew: \"Qin Xin, let's peacefully break up. I'll give you half of the money I made before. Take it as my compensation to you!\"A second divorce after less than half a year of marriage was indeed a heavy blow to a woman.He sincerely liked her. And she almost gave birth to their child. So the money was regarded as compensation for her.Shi Qin Xin's heart felt like it was cut up by a knife. She burst into tears: \"Zhen Min, I'm not going to divorce! I know I'm wrong. That b*stard suddenly pestered me that day. I was afraid you will think that I have done something with him and wronged you. I was afraid of you assuming Chen Qiao Qiao and I are the same kind. So I dare not let you know!\"In fact, she didn't fully tell the truth.Her ex-husband was good at painting figures. When the two of them were affectionate, he painted her a very bold painting in which she was dressed in a very revealing way.When she was divorced, she wanted to burn the painting, but she couldn't find it. She had asked the scumbag. He said he didn't know. Never thought it was hidden by him long ago!That day, he threatened her with the painting and told her to buy the painting back with 100 yuan. If not, he would show the painting to Qiao Zhen Min. She was angry and scared. So she quarreled with him and unexpectedly got pushed by that scumbag!She didn't dare to let other people know that her ex-husband came to her as she was afraid of everyone knowing that she had such \"shameless\" painting painted!\"So you put the miscarriage blame on little Wan-er's head?\" Qiao Zhen Min snorted, \"Your reason is too ridiculous, isn't it?\"It was alright that she didn't want to mention her ex-husband matter. She could had said she had fallen by herself. Why did she have to push it on a four-year-old child?To put it bluntly, she just can't tolerate little Wan-er!Shi Qin Xin's mouth opened and closed again and again. She couldn't refute a word.The situation took a turn for the worse. Before, Shi Family was so arrogant that they wanted to tear up Qiao Zhen Min. But now that they heard Shi Qin Xin's response, they could no longer be tough.Mother Shi slapped her daughter on the back twice and scolded: \"You damn child. What do you want me to say about you! Zhen Min, Qin Xin knows she's wrong. It's not a big deal. There's no need to reach the point of divorce, no?\"Qiao Zhen Min stated: \"Not divorcing is possible. As long as Qin Xin promises that every penny earned in the family will be used as a dowry when little Wan-er gets married, then I won't divorce.\"All give to little Wan-er?Then what was this marriage for!In the end, even if Shi Qin Xin agreed, Shi Family wouldn't agree.Eventually they got divorced.On the day of the divorce, Qiao Zhen Min personally handed 400 yuan to Shi Qin Xin. Calmly looking at her, he spoke, \"Do you know how I knew that you were pushed by your ex-husband, oh no, it should your ex-ex-husband?\"Pale face, Shi Qin Xin didn't respond. She was curious though.\"It was little Wan-er who told me. She was afraid that you would be kidnapped by kidnappers. Every time you went out to buy grocery, she would quietly follow you and said she want to protect you. But you... aren't worthy of her liking!\"After speaking, Qiao Zhen Min stopped looking at her and turned to leave.Shi Qin Xin watched his back go farther and farther. Finally she crouched down, hugged her legs, and bitterly cried.Just don't know whether she was crying for wronging little Wan-er or the lost of her marriage.Because of Shi Qin Xin's plea, the transportation company didn't dismiss Qiao Zhen Min. However, Qiao Zhen Min took the initiative to pack up and leave after a few days.Though other party didn't dismiss him after such a matter, they did kick him out of the 'oil content team' and never assigned him any more business trips.Without oil content, this job was hard and boring. Why should he stay?It might be better to go back to town and find a job. This way, he can be closer to home and make it easier for him to take care of his daughter and parents.Half a month after their divorce, Shi Qin Xin's ex-husband got his legs broken by someone.Half a year later, Shi Qin Xin was matchmade to another province by a distant relative. Later, she didn't return for many years.Divorced twice in less than two years and there were two more divorce certificates in the drawer that could not be thrown away. It made Qiao Zhen Min extremely depressed.Although he appeared to be unaffected on the surface, he was actually very depressed.It can be said that the reason for marrying Chen Qiao Qiao was because he was too young and made a hasty decision. This time with Shi Qin Xin, he decided to marry after repeated confirmations. Unexpectedly, this was the result.Chen Qiao Qiao gave him a green hat and wanted him to raise a cuckoo son. So disgusted, he never wanted to see her again in this life.Although Shi Qin Xin wasn't an objectively bad person, she was too selfish. If this marriage continued, she will only hurt little Wan-er in the end.Qiao Zhen Min took out the wine and made himself drunk. In the end, he fell asleep unconscious.After falling asleep, he had a dream.In the dream, Da Qiao didn't pick up a hundred years old Ganoderma lucidum. Nor did he take little Wan-er to see a doctor in the provincial capital. Due to this, Wan-er didn't go missing. He also didn't divorce Chen Qiao Qiao.It was just that in the dream, he still went to work in the transportation team in the county city. After three years of working, the comrades of the transportation team were caught by the police. A big cap of reselling was put on and those comrades who were caught in the act were all shot.Although he wasn't caught in act, he was affected; sentenced to twenty years in prison!Less than half a year after he was in prison, Chen Qiao Qiao left his daughter and eloped with another. In his dream, his parents passed away two years ago. He could only entrust little Wan-er to his two elder brothers to adopt.In his fifth year in prison, his elder brother came and told him that little Wan-er had drowned!He woke up from the dream and broke out in a cold sweat.After he washed his face, he decided to destroy all traces of his connection with the transportation team before leaving!...Once the production team knew that Qiao Zhen Min was divorced again, they exploded again.\"How long have it been since they married? Why are divorced again?\"\"That's right. I went to Qiao's house to inquire. Qiao Family didn't say anything! Eldest Qiao's wife is afraid of her mother-in-law scolding her and dared not speak. But I heard rumors that old Fifth Qiao is not only divorced, but also lost his job!\"\"My goddess, what is going on? Do you think old Fifth Qiao wronged the other party?\"\"It's possible. I'm afraid he had offend someone with great background and implicate us when the time comes!\"There ware endless speculations. Qiao Family never outright responded.After this divorce, Qiao Zhen Min had changed from a sweet treat to a hot potato that no one cared about.Although Qiao Family was still prosperous and Qiao Zhen Min found a job in the town later, it couldn't withstand against his repeated divorces. So no matter how good of a catch he was, it was useless!After Qiao Zhen Min came back, it happened that the driver of the food factory where Qiao Zhen Jun worked had an accident and couldn't continue to work. After being referred by Qiao Zhen Jun, Qiao Zhen Min went for an interview. Finally after passing the interview, he stayed in the factory.The two brothers worked in the same factory and could be each other's company.Many people felt sorry for Qiao Zhen Min after losing his job in the county. They also discussed a lot about his second divorce.Little do they that was no weal with woe. One year after Qiao Zhen Min left the transportation team in the county, the people in the transportation team were arrested because of reselling.In these days, reselling was a very serious crime. All those people were sentenced to death.Some people wanted to pushed the already gone Qiao Zhen Min out. But he had been gone for a year. Secondly, unless he was caught on the spot, it was difficult to find evidence. In the end, Qiao Zhen Min wasn't affected.Qiao Zhen Min sweated once again when he remembered that dream.Also, if he hadn't divorced Shi Qin Xin, he would definitely not have escaped this disaster!Suddenly, he was relieved.Spring went and autumn came. In the blink of an eye, another three years have passed.1977 arrived. Da Qiao was eleven years old. She had grown into a young girl with fair skin and beautiful long legs.Her skin was as white and tender as always. No matter how much she was exposed to the sun, there was no flaw on her face. Her facial features become more and more delicate as they grew. She looks like a little celestial fairy walking out of a painting.What was more important was that she took the first place in the whole grade every time. The year before last, in the county's primary school graduation exam, she stirred a sensation in the education bureau by being the county's first place.That time, the county education bureau rewarded her 50 yuan. The town education bureau rewarded her 30 yuan. While the community rewarded her 20 yuan. This added up to exactly 100 yuan!In order to let her go to school, the junior high school in the town offered free tuition and accommodation as well as a subsidy of 20 yuan per semester!Everyone was shocked that studying can actually make so much money!Da Qiao became famous in the first battle. She was 'that family's child'. Everyone wanted to birth a good-looking and smart child like her.When Da Qiao was in the second year of junior high school, a piece of news bombarded the whole country. That was, the Ministry of Education decided to resume the college entrance examination that had been suspended for ten years!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt had been ten years since colleges and universities across the country stopped enrolling students. No one expected that there would be a day when they would recover!As soon as the news came out, it was like pouring a scoop of water into an oil pan. The whole country was sizzling!When the news reached Qili production team, it had already been few days later. Still, this didn't reduce everyone's shocked and excitement. Especially the educated youths in the educated youth center. They were almost going crazy with joy!Some educated youths had been in the countryside for more than ten years. They thought they would stay in the countryside for the rest of their lives and couldn't go back. Most of them got married and had children in the production team.The educated youth didn't go to the field to work. Even the educated youths who were teaching in the school also stopped going to the school to teach. Their minds were completely on the college entrance examination.At this time, Qiao Family was talking about the college entrance examination.Wan Chun Ju snacked on the pumpkin seeds as she spoke, \"Isn't it just a test? It is worth the educated youth to cry and laugh. Simply look like mad men!\"From Wan Chun Ju's point of view, what was the use of studying so many books. Haven't these people been working in the fields for so many years? Each and every one of them had to leave their hometowns. Their lives weren't as good as them rural people!She glanced at her eldest daughter, who was sitting beside her with her head bowed. She spoke, \"Dong He, your grandma said that she would introduce you to a good match. Tomorrow, dressed up and come with me to your grandma's house!\"A look of disdain flashed in Qiao Dong He's eyes. Frowning, she replied, \"Mom, I don't want to get married so early.\"Wan Chun Ju instantly shrieked: \"What do you want to do if you don't get married? We provide for you to study for so many years and it got no use. Others graduate from high school and go to factories to make a lot of money for their families. While you haven't earned a penny back. Since you can't make money, you might as well get married sooner!\"Qiao Dong He's face flushed red. Pinching the corners of her clothes with her fingers, she bit her lips white.She graduated in June. After graduation, she originally wanted to return to the production team to be a teacher. However, the production team had no place for her.Later, Shen Family introduced her to a job, but she was rejected during the interview. For the past few months, she had been helping at home and working in the fields when it peak farming period. Her mom kept despising her; saying she was useless. It was very frustrating to her.Last month, her grandma's house introduced a match to her. The man came back after being a soldier. Because of her third uncle's relationship, she was very fond of soldiers. So she went to see him.The man was tall and thin with a straight back. She had a good first impression. But as soon as the man opened his mouth, she was disillusioned.He first looked at her like she was a product. Then he began to criticize her for not being pretty and expressed his disdain about her for having so much education and still end up in the field. While the man's mom was eyeing her butt. Then in front of everyone, she commented that she was worried that she would only have daughters like her grandma's family did in the future.She was so angry that she was in tears. Even so, her mom still blamed her. If her grandmother hadn't stopped her, she would have forced her to get along with that man.Since that time, she had resisted blind date.Seeing her unresponsive sullen personality, Wan Chun Ju became angry: \"I'm your mom. I have the final say on your affairs. If I tell you to go, you have to go. Otherwise...\"\"Otherwise what?\" Qiao Xiu Zhi walked in from outside and coldly eyed her with a pair of tiger eyes.Wan Chun Ju shivered all over. Her arrogance instantly reduced to nothing: \"Mom, aren't I thinking for the best for Dong He? She is seventeen years old. If she doesn't find a good man now, they will be picked by others. This child isn't smart and got a clumsy mouth. I'm so heartbroken for her!\"Qiao Xiu Zhi gave her a cold look. Then she turned to look at Qiao Dong He and said, \"Dong He, do you know about the continuation of the college entrance examination?\"Qiao Dong He raised her head and nodded: \"I know, Grandmother.\"Qiao Xiu Zhi continued: \"Then do you want to take the exam? You just graduated this year and you meet the qualifications to take it. If you want to take the exam, you must start preparing now!\"Qiao Dong He's face flushed red. She stared straight at her grandmother and said, \"Grandmother, can I?\"Qiao Xiu Zhi replied: \"I don't know if you can. I'm just asking you if you want to. If you want, I will support you to study. If you don't want to, it's useless for me to force you!\"Before Qiao Dong He could answer, Wan Chun Ju became anxious: \"Mom, why should girls study so much? And Dong He is so stupid. Even if she goes to college, she still can't find a job. Why waste all that money? Quickly finding a man to marry is bet...\"Qiao Xiu Zhi retorted: \"Since you wished to marry so much, you can divorce Eldest and marry again. My granddaughter wasn't born to marry. If she doesn't want to marry, our Qiao family can support her for a lifetime!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Qiao Dong He's tears were about to fall. She rushed over and hugged her grandmother: \"Grandmother, I want to take the college entrance examination. I want to study!\"Her character wasn't lovable. Nor was her mouth good at coaxing people. The only thing she was good at studying. In fact, when it can to studying, she wasn't as good as her younger siblings. She was really useless.Such a rare chance, her grandmother didn't despise her. She was really touched!Qiao Xiu Zhi patted her head and said, \"Since you want to participate, then properly revise.\"Qiao Dong He's eyes reddened with excitement. She nodded vigorously: \"En, I must revise well. I will definitely be admitted to university!\"She wanted to become the first college student in Qiao Family. She wanted to make her grandparents proud of her!Qiao Xiu Zhi glanced at Wan Chun Ju's face again and indifferently stated: \"Dong He's book is for revision. If an educated youth comes to borrow the book, no one is allowed to lend it away. Also, from today onwards, no one is allowed to disturb her. Otherwise, get out of Qiao's house!\"Wan Chun Ju: \"...\"Her face went from red to white as she touched her chest; feeling like she was about to die of anger!Her mom told her that this match was very wealthy and was willing to give a dowry of 80 yuan.Nowadays, the bride price was generally ten yuan and twenty yuan. The generous ones will give thirty or forty yuan. The richer people in the town will give fifty yuan. A wealthy family like eighty yuan was hard to come by!She had planned to teach Dong He how to please men and take down this rich future son-in-law. However, her mother-in-law unexpectedly blocked the path halfway!Why should girls study? No matter how much they read, they'll be another family's!It was useless for her to be angry though. She can't win against her mother-in-law!...In addition to Qiao Family and educated youth be rowdy because of the college entrance examination, there were also some families that were even more noisy: the family with educated youth and local pair.After Wang Shui Sheng came back from a meeting in the community, he had already announced to everyone that all educated youths could take the college entrance examination.This may be the only chance for educated youths to return to the city. So both male and female educated youths wanted to participate the college entrance examination. However, their local partners didn't want them to take part.The reason was very simple. They were afraid that once they leave, they will not come back!It was a plausible thought. Once they return to the city, they will be city people. Who would want a match and children from the countryside. So the people with educated youth partners were now kicking up a lot of fuss.Lin Hui's fifth elder brother married a female educated youth.Now that female educated youth wanted to take part in the college entrance examination. But Lin Hui's mom, Wang Qiu Ying was afraid that she won't come back once she leaves. Therefore, leaving her husband and children behind. So she forbid her from applying.This female educated youth was called Zhou Xue-e. She was a strong-minded woman. She quarreled with her mother-in-law on the spot. Wang Qiu Ying was so mad that she almost had a heart attack. Zhou Xue-e also threw a tantrum.Old Fifth Lin was harassed by two women to the point his head feel big. No matter which side he stood on, he was in the wrong.Lin Hui took the twins to her maternal home. Before entering the door, she asked her fifth elder brother: \"Fifth Elder Brother, what are your thoughts on this? If Fifth Elder Sister-in-law insists on taking the college entrance examination, would you agree?\"Old Fifth Lin sighed and replied, \"This is not a question of whether I agree or disagree. The community has already said that no one is allowed to stop the educated youth from signing up for the college entrance examination.\"Otherwise, they will be arrested.Besides, with his wife's personality, if he really stops her, they might not be able to live peacefully in the future.Lin Hui sighed and spoke, \"I understand. I will talk with Mom.\"As soon as she entered her mom's room, she found her mom laying on the bed with a white towel on her head as she moaned.Lin Hui walked in quickly and said, \"Mom, how are you feeling? Do you want me to take you to the clinic?\"Wang Qiu Ying opened one eye and glanced behind her. Seeing that no one was behind her, she threw aside the towel on her head.Sitting up, she responded, \"No, I'm fine. I'm putting an act for you fifth elder brother. If not, with your fifth elder brother's soft-hearted temper, he will definitely agree after that woman kick up a fuss or two!\"Lin Hui was a little dumbfounded: \"Mom, I know you're doing this for Elder Fifth Brother and little nephew, but you can't stop her. Nor can it be stop! If Fifth Elder Sister-in-law is forced to give up the college entrance examination this time, do you think she won't have any resentment in her heart?\"Wang Qiu Ying gritted her teeth: \"You think I want to be the villain. Once this female educated youth return to the city, how can she still like mud legs from the countryside? Your little nephew is only three years old, what to do then?\"Lin Hui spoke: \"Mom, Fifth Elder Sister-in-law isn't that kind of person. Besides, if Fifth Elder Sister-in-law can get into college, it will help little nephew in the future, right? Also, if our Lin Family can produce a college student, it would be an honorable matter. Isn't that right, Mom?\"Wang Qiu Ying was a little moved by what she said: \"But... what if she doesn't come back after passing the exam?\"Lin Hui sighed, \"Mom, when Dong Lin's dad returned to the city. You told me not to agree to letting him go. I never thought of stopping him from the beginning to the end. Even when he met with mishap later, I had never regretted it. Because if I stop him, he will have resentment in his heart. If I made him stay, he would had hold resentment and we can't live in harmony. It was better to let him go.\"If the other party had a conscience, he would definitely not abandon them. If the other party had no conscience, what was the use of keeping him?Thinking of her daughter's current life, Wang Qiu Ying budged in the end, \"Fine, she can take the exam if she wants. I won't be the villain anymore!\"Lin Hui quickly told her fifth elder brother and fifth elder sister-in-law the news.Zhou Xue-e was overjoyed when she found out. She patted her chest and assured: \"Don't worry. I, Zhou Xue-e, am not the kind of woman who abandon her husband and children. When I go to university, I will definitely come back!\"Lin Hui just smiled but gave no response.Her ex-husband also told her this back then. Although the other party drowned later, she had a feeling in her heart that even if the other party didn't die, he wouldn't come back to pick up the two of them.Zhou Xue-e didn't notice little sister-in-law's expression. She was looking for pen and paper everywhere to write a letter home and get her family to help find some information.Lin Hui came out of her maternal home. Halfway home, she saw female educated youth, Da Zhi carrying a bundle and walking towards the educated youth's point. There were two children chasing her behind her.The little girl was only two years old. She cried until her face was covered with snot and tears. Her baby voice shouted, \"Mom, mom, don't go!\"The little girl was thin and small. She couldn't walk steadily. After chasing a few steps, she fell to the ground and instantly burst into tears.Despite hearing her daughter falling, Da Zhi didn't stop. Without even looking back, she continued to walk forward with her bundle in her arms.The little girl's elder brother, Liu Xiao Hu picked up his little sister and coaxed, \"Younger Sister don't cry. Let's go back. Elder Brother will cook for you.\"The little girl pointed in the direction where her mom disappeared and cried, \"Elder Brother, Mom, want Mom!\"Although Liu Xiao Hu was only four years old, the poor's children mature early. In his precocious eyes, there was a hint of hatred: \"She isn't our mom. Let's go home!\"Liu Xiao Hu led his sobbing younger sister home. Lin Hui couldn't help shaking her head.From the start, she was reluctant to marry favus-riddled Gou Sheng. Even after she gave birth to a child later, her mind still couldn't accept. Except for the occasional field work, she didn't do any chores at home.She wasn't good to the two children either. Even when they cried to death when they were little, she wouldn't hug them. Later, when they grew up, she would beat them at every turn. What pitiful two children.If she really didn't want to marry, she could have gone to the farm. Besides, it was due to her laziness and wanting to use Gou Sheng, everyone thought that they were dating.So who can be blamed for this? Her own, no?On the other hand, favus-riddled Gou Sheng. He was extremely lazy before marriage. After getting married, he suddenly became diligent. After having a child, he became a father and a mother at the same time on top of of working in the field. Seeing how much he did, everyone couldn't help but sigh.The recovery of college entrance examination had caused angst across the country.There were also people in the village who disallowed like Lin Family. But in the end they couldn't stop it. All the educated youths signed up for the college entrance examination....When Da Qiao knew that Eldest Cousin Sister was going to take the college entrance examination, she immediately rode her bicycle to the town and asked her godparents to help her find some revision materials.From Da Qiao's point of view, the decision made by Eldest Cousin Sister was extremely correct.Eldest Cousin Sister was introverted and quiet. She didn't like complicated life and personnel affairs. If she can be admitted to a normal university, becoming a teacher in the school is the most suitable path for her.After Shen Family found out, they naturally agreed. They immediately called relatives in the capital to get them to help buy one or two sets of material and send them over.Da Qiao thanked her godparents. Afterward, she had lunch at Shen's house and played with her younger brother Shen Tian for a while before riding the bike back.As soon as she got home, a sweet voice came from outside the small house: \"Elder Sister Da Qiao, your little cutie is here.\"This voice was soft and silky. The softness and waxiness carried sweetness. As if it was the sound from heaven.When one listen to this voice, they will definitely think that the owner of the voice was a sweet little princess. But the truth is...As soon as the voice fell, a coal-like little tanned girl merrily walked in. Her dark skin, rough facial features, and flat nose appeared to sight. All together, there was only one word to describe her. That was ugly!Behind her was Qiao Dong Ying and An Ping.An Ping walked in and complained: \"Little sister, how many times have you said it? Please don't call yourself little cutie. Quite chilling to the max!\"When Younger Sister Da Qiao was a child, she also liked to call herself little cutie. Younger Sister Da Qiao was fair and tender with big eyes and a red mouth. She was prettier than the prosperous baby in the New Year painting. When she said that she was little cutie, everyone would at most laugh at her vanity.But his little sister looked like this; exactly like from the same mold of his mom. And she dared to say that she was little cutie. He was truly afraid that she will be beaten by everyone when she goes to school in the future!Little Dong Yun looked back at her elder brother and responded, \"Elder Brother, I am little cute. It's not my problem that you don't think I'm cute. It's because your eyes aren't good!\"An Ping: \"...\"Little Dong Yun continued to add a knife: \"Also, Elder Brother, your voice is too ugly. You sound like a duck when you speak. You shouldn't talk in the future!\"An Ping's face flushed red: \"...\"\"Pfft...\"Seeing that her younger brother was speechless by youngest sister's retort, Qiao Dong Ying laughed without any sympathy.An Ping's voice was recently changing. The voice was like a male duck's voice. Simply charring to hear. Youngest sister's mouth was really powerful. The whole family couldn't beat her even when added together!Youngest Sister was a strange person. She looked ugly, but had a super sweet voice that completely contrast with appearance. More importantly, she didn't think she was ugly. Instead, she was very confident and thought she was pretty and cute.If she wasn't half a year older than the twins, she would even think she and the twins were triplets!Yes, she was that confident!Da Qiao was no stranger to this sibling's love and hate. She rubbed little Dong Yun's head and spoke, \"Younger Sister Dong Yun is so good. Go in and sit down. Elder Sister will come to give you lessons in a while!\"After she finished speaking, she sternly looked at her elder cousin brother, \"Elder Cousin Brother, hurry up and sit down. If not, I won't be polite!\"An Ping: In this family, elder sisters can beat him at any time, while the two younger sisters would refute him from time to time. He was so pitiful, weak, and helpless.As soon as the words fell, two fair and tender little dumplings ran out of the room.The two little dumplings looked exactly the same; with white and tender skin, big eyes like black grapes, and small red lips. Anyone who saw them would marvel at how delicate and dewy these two children looked.These two little dumplings were Da Qiao's twin younger brothers, Qiao An Jie and Qiao An Xu.\"Elder Sister, you are finally back. I miss you dearly!\" Little dumpling Qiao An Xu was running in front.Although they were twin brothers, their personalities were completely different. Qiao An Jie had a quiet personality, while Qiao An Xu was vain and coquettish.Qiao An Xu jumped up and hugged his elder sister's thigh. With his head raised, his big watery eyes blinked. So cute that one's heart would melt.Da Qiao really liked as well as feeling helpless toward this cutey younger brother: \"That's right. Elder Sister is back. Did you listen to Mom at home?\"Qiao An Xu grinned and spoke in his baby voice, \"Yes. Xu Xu is the most obedient!\"Such a cute little cutie, who can resist.Qiao An Jie ran up and his little paw grabbed his elder sister's hand: \"Elder Sister, Jie Jie is also obedient.\"His eyelashes were long and dense. His big watery eyes stared at her like a small animal begging for praise; it made people's hearts melt.Da Qiao's heart softened. She kissed each of the two younger brothers on the face: \"What good children. Elder Sister brought you candies. Quickly, go sit down with Elder Sister Dong Yun.\"Qiao An Xu cheered: \"Hooray, there's candy to eat!\"Qiao An Jie also pursed his lips and grinned; looking obedient and cute....Because the educated youth in the production team had no textbooks and no materials, they came to Qiao\u2019s house every day to borrow materials. Qiao Dong He relented and lent them the materials to copy.That was enough. But they still come to ask her questions from time to time. Some of these people hadn't touched textbooks for nearly ten years. They had almost forgotten a lot of knowledge. People come to Qiao's old house every day. The entrance threshold was about to be leveled.Qiao Dong He was soft-natured and didn't know how to say no to others. In this way, she herself had become someone who can't revise.Qiao Xiu Zhi had always hoped that her eldest granddaughter's character can be tough. Over the years, she had taught everything she can, but unfortunately it had little effect.Seeing her eldest granddaughter like this, she simply made a decision to send her eldest granddaughter to live in the town. Afterward the food supply was sent to neighboring Wei Family. So money was also given every month for helping to take care of her eldest granddaughter.Wei Family's two elders had always been lonely. So they were delighted to be entrusted this task from Qiao Family.Like this, Qiao Dong He was sent to the town to revise and Qiao's house became quiet.Although the college entrance examination had made a lot of noise, it was currently the autumn harvest period. A period that got all of the villagers' attention. Everyone threw themselves into this autumn battle.Once the autumn harvest was completed, the weather was getting colder. The news about the college entrance examination had been confirmed. The first college entrance examination was scheduled on December 11th and 12th.The educated youth didn't care about things outside the window. They only focused on reviewing and devoting themselves in welcoming the college entrance examination. The production team's school was also forced to suspend classes.Before the college entrance examination, Da Qiao went to the town to live with her elder cousin sister in order to take care of her.She added a jade bead to the water that her elder cousin sister drinks every day to ensure that her elder cousin sisters wouldn't get sick. Qiao Dong He felt that after Younger Sister Da Qiao came, her memory seemed to be better.It usually took three or four read to memorize the knowledge. Now, she can memorized by just reading it twice. And when she woke up the next day, she can still remember it very clearly.She felt that Younger Sister Da Qiao was her own little lucky star!Under such pressure, the first college entrance examination arrived.The day before the college entrance examination, Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan came to live in the town. They took their eldest granddaughter to the examination hall the next day.Da Qiao handed the water bottle that she had put in the jade bead in the morning to her elder cousin sister and smiled sweetly: \"Elder Cousin Sister, just do the questions like normal. Don't worry, you will definitely pass the test!\"\"Thank you, Younger Sister Da Qiao. Grandfather, Grandmother, I'm going in.\"Qiao Dong He was actually so nervous that her palms were sweating. Now seeing her younger sister's sweet smile, she suddenly became less nervous for some unknown reason.Qiao Xiu Zhi and Xue Chuan told her not to be nervous. Qiao Dong He nodded, turned around, and walked into the examination room.At this time, two high-end cars came to Qili production team.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Adored Koi in the \u201970sCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBecause Shen Family often drove a car to Qiao Family, a car wasn't something rare sight for the villagers of the Qili production team.But when the two premium sedan cars entered the production team, it caught everyone's attention.\"My god, is that also a car? Why is it so big?\"\"Ain't that right? It's much more expensive than Qiao Family's god-relatives'. What's more, it's so new and stylish looking. One can tell it's very expensive at first glance!\"\"It's one thing whether it's expensive or not. The question is why did this car come to our production team? Could it be they're Qiao Family's god-relatives too?\"\"But didn't Auntie Xiu Zhi couple go to town to send their granddaughter off to the college entrance examination? If god-relatives comes, they wouldn't have left.\"Everyone had their own guesses. Their eyes were stuck to the two cars like glue.When Wang Shui Sheng saw the car, he didn't plan to go there immediately despite his slight curious. Still, his eyes kept following the cars.The two cars stopped when they arrived at the production team's office. Seeing this, Wang Shui Sheng knew that he couldn't leave it.He left some instruction with everyone and was about to go over when he saw the director of the community rushing over on a broken bicycle. His face was so red that he didn't know whether it was due to anxiety or exercise.Seeing Wang Shui Sheng, he abruptly braked. The bicycle almost dived into the field: \"Why are you still standing here? Did you see the mayor passing by?\"Mayor?Hearing these two words, let alone the villagers, even Wang Shui Sheng was stunned: \"Why did the mayor suddenly come here? Did something happen?\"The director of the community had been chasing the car all the way and was already exhausted. He waved his hand and ushered, \"Don't ask any more. You will know when quickly you go over.\"Wang Shui Sheng hurriedly rolled down his trousers and ran towards the office while sorting his clothes and hair.At this moment, the door of a car behind was opened. A tall man walked out from inside. He was wearing a black suit and a pair of black leather shoes. His hair was combed back. Each strand seemed to be specially shaped.The mayor got off the car in front and smiled at the man in the black suit: \"Mr. Huo, this is Qili production team. The person you're looking for is... I'll call the production leader here.\"In fact, he didn't know the true identity of this Mr. Huo. He received a special called and was instructed to entertain the other party; saying that this person not only had the ability to develop their entire town, but even the entire county. So no matter what they must not disappoint the other party.He was very shocked when he heard this. Nor did he dared to ask any more questions. He quickly patted his chest and promised that he would definitely entertain the other party. That was why he was personally accompanying him now!The community director rushed over on a bicycle. Behind him was Wang Shui Sheng, who was running on his legs. Even like this, the mayor felt they were slow and kept rushing them.Wang Shui Sheng was running out of breath. He came over and asked, \"Mayor, Zhen, is there anything I can help you with?\"The mayor waved his hand and said, \"I don't need your help here. But this Mr. Huo has something to ask you!\"Mr. Huo?When Wang Shui Sheng heard the surname, he immediately thought of the pair of wicked ones in the pigsty.He turned his head to look at the other party. Immediately, he was stunned. He wondered if it was an illusion. He kept having a feeling that Mr. Huo was a little familiar.Huo Zheng Chen turned around and politely gave a slight bow to Wang Shui Sheng, \"Hello, my name is Huo Zheng Chen. I heard my father, Huo Hua Qing, wife and children were transferred from the farm to your production team five years ago. Might you know where they are now? Are they\u2026 okay?\"Hearing this, Wang Shui Sheng froze again. He was wondering how he felt a little familiar just now. Unexpectedly, they turned out to be father and son!It was just who was this person who can actually make the mayor personally accompany him. If he finds out that his son was gone later, would he take his anger on him?Wang Shui Sheng's heart instantly felt a like drum: \"They are... over at the pigsty.\"He couldn't help but feel a little guilty when he said this. They couldn't be blamed though. Huo Family was bad people. They definitely couldn't live in a good place.In fact, compared with other wicked ones, Huo Family was doing well. Especially in the past two years. Except for not being able to freely move, they were almost the same as other villagers.Hearing the pigsty, Huo Zheng Chen's face showed a slight response. But he didn't blame Wang Shui Sheng: \"Can I trouble you to show me the way?\"Wang Shui Sheng's head kept bobbing. Then he waved his hand: \"No trouble, no trouble. I'll take you there.\"With that said, he quickly led the group towards the pigsty.At this time, he was very fortunate that he brought someone to repair the pigsty two years ago.When they arrived at the pigsty, the mayor smelled the stench. Taking in the surrounding environment, his heart started thumping.He never thought Mr. Huo's father was a wicked one. Since his father was a wicked one, why didn't he join with him back then?Everyone had countless questions in their hearts, but no one dared to ask.Huo Zheng Chen's leather shoes stepped on the muddy ground and walked in step by step. Excitment and sullenness pumped in his heart.With so much a large movement outside, Dai Shu Fang heard it in the kitchen and ran out while wiping her hands. When she saw a tall man standing in front of the main room, she suddenly felt a very strange feeling.This back was inexplicably familiar.She frowned and asked, \"Who are you looking for?\"Huo Zheng Chen heard the voice from behind. His body came to a sudden halt. Then he slowly turned around. The woman in sight seemed so familiar to him that he could even recognized even if turned into ashes. But also so unfamiliar that he wanted to cry.She was wearing patched clothes. Her face was pale and sallow. White hairs were faintly visible on the temples.In his memory, his wife was a well-known beauty with plump cheeks and a rosy face. She was always wearing the most fashionable clothes. He never dreamed that one day she would become like this!Huo Zheng Chen's lips trembled and he choked out, \"Fang Fang.\"When the other party turned around, Dai Shu Fang's eyes instantly widened. She stared at him as if she had seen a ghost.Even if the man in front of her turned to ashes, she won't forget. But he was already dead!Twelve years ago, when Huo Chi was just one year old, he personally transported military supplies in order to support the country's war with the foreign. Never thought he wouldn't come back after going on that trip.If she didn't have a child, she would have followed him. Two years after he was gone, they were stamped as wicked ones and then driven to the farm.Twelve years! The person she thought had been dead for twelve years suddenly appeared in front of her again!Dai Shu Fang looked at him and asked, \"Are you a human or a ghost?\"Before Huo Zheng Chen could answer, an old man walked into the door. This man was none other than Huo Hua Qing.Like Dai Shu Fang, Huo Hua Qing was stunned and couldn't react when he saw his son who had been dead for twelve years suddenly standing in front of him.Huo Zheng Chen saw his white-haired father and suddenly felt sad. Kneeling down at him, he spoke, \"Dad, unfilial son is back!\"\"You! You're still alive?\"Huo Hua Qing's eyed were pinned to him to the point that his eyeballs were almost protruded.Huo Zheng Chen's eyes were red: \"Dad, I'm still alive!\"As soon as the words were out, Dai Shu Fang rushed up and beat him for a while: \"You are alive! Then why didn't you come back before? Why?\"In the past twelve years, his death had become a scar they dared not mention. In the past twelve years, they had been struggling on the edge of hell, while he had lived brightly!Huo Zheng Chen let her beat and vent.Back then, he sent the military supplies to the battlefield. It was unknown who leaked the news and they met the enemy halfway. The two sides fought. Before he went unconscious, he went flying from the explosion. His head hit against a rock. What happened afterward was unclear.When he woke up, he had no memory. What's more, he didn't know something went wrong in the middle and he became a black worker in Country Mi.Those years in Country Mi, he had a very bad life. He had no identity and no human rights. He worked day and night. At the slightest drop of pace, he would be beaten.He endured it for more than three years before he found the opportunity to escape from the black workshop. After that, with the help of a\u00a0noble person, he got a new identity and began to help the noble person.Later, he became independent from the noble person and started to create his own business. In less than ten years, he accumulated a fortune that others couldn't earn in a lifetime.It was just that for so many years, he hadn't recovered his memory until a few months ago when he hit his head again. The memory that disappeared for many years suddenly came back.After recovering his memory, he immediately rushed to Xiang Jiang from Country Mi. He requested help to find the whereabouts of his family through various connections and contacts.Huo Hua Qing looked at his son with cloudy eyes and burst into tears.No one from outside came in; leaving the space for the family of three.Since last year, people had been vindicated one after another.When the villagers knew that Huo Family in the pigsty had been vindicated, everyone was shocked.They never thought 't wicked ones could be vindicated one day. Looking at this situation, Huo Family in the pigsty had an amazing background!At once, everyone regretted it.If they had known that Huo Family would be vindicated or had known that their background was so great, they would had treated them better in the first place!Now, it was too late!Speaking of it, Huo Family seem to have a good relationship with Qiao Family. Especially the drowned Huo Chi, who had a good relationship with Da Qiao back then.Now that Huo Family had been vindicated, they will definitely thank Qiao Family.Why was Qiao Family so lucky?Casually saving someone and it was the son of the deputy chief. Lose a daughter and end up gaining god-relatives from the city. Now supporting wicked ones, they end up supporting someone important!Why didn't they have such luck!?It was same people with different life!Everyone looked at Huo Family's high-end car. Some of them were thick-skinned. They rushed up to get close. However, there was a person who was hiding in the crowd and didn't dare to get close.This person was none other than Wan Chun Ju.When Wan Chun Ju was working in the pigsty, she often ordered Huo Family around. From time to time, she almost poked her fingers in their faces and called them wicked ones.It wasn't until she stopped working in the pigsty that she didn't continue to scold them. But seeing them on the road, despising them was always a must.Unexpectedly, trapped-in-the-mud wicked ones would have their vindication one day. And the mayor himself came to accompany him to pick them up. One can imagine how scary this background was.Wan Chun Ju thought of what she had done back then and her legs went weak with fright.She wanted to stealthily sneak home while no one noticed her. Just as she turned around, she was stopped by someone.\"Eldest Qiao's wife, aren't your Qiao Family and Huo Family close? Why didn't you join in?\"\"Yeah. It's not like your character!\"In the past, when Shen Family came over, Wan Chun Ju looked like she was a tongue-wagging dog. Now the other party was accompanied by the mayor, she didn't go up to please them. Which was very abnormal.With such call, Dai Shu Fang noticed Wan Chun Ju and walked towards her step by step.Seeing this, Wan Chun Ju's legs went limp and she slumped on the ground: \"I was wrong, Elder Sister Fang! I was wrong, I shouldn't call you wicked ones. Don't take me to the farm!\"Dai Shu Fang was speechless when she heard Wan Chun Ju's words.In fact, she never took what Wan Chun Ju said to heart.Although what Wan Chun Ju said was unpleasant, it was nothing when compared to those on the farm. She had endured more unpleasant sounds.What's more, Qiao Family had been taking care of them all these years. Her son Huo Chi and Da Qiao were childhood-sweetheart-close friends. Looking upon the face of Qiao Family, she won't take out her anger on Wan Chun Ju.She wanted to go up and help Wan Chun Ju get up. However, Wan Chun Ju thought she was going to beat her. Frightened, she screamed like slaughtered pigs.The people around couldn't help but burst into laughter.\"Wan pig-slaughterer deserves to be Wan pig-slaughterer. After so many years, she still like to make slaughtered pig shriek!\"\"Ain't that right. If one day she stops calling, I may not be used to it!\"Seeing this, Dai Shu Fang didn't help her at all. Instead, she softly asked, \"Is your mother-in-law at home?\"Seeing that she didn't beat herself, Wan Chun Ju became a little more courageous: \"My parent-in-laws gone to the town. My daughter is going to take the college entrance examination these days. They went to the town to take care of her. It's estimated to take two days before they come back.\"Only then, Dai Shu Fang remembered the college entrance examination matter. Nodding, she responded, \"Okay, we'll come back in two days.\"Her husband was going to take them back to the capital. Before going back, they had to meet Qiao Family once and say goodbye.Huo Family left in the sedan car. Long after they left, the villagers were discussing endlessly....Da Qiao and others in the town didn't know what happened to the production team.After Elder Cousin Sister entered the examination room, she and her grandparents didn't immediately leave. Instead, they waited outside.Qiao Dong He brought the stationery into the examination room. Her heart was drumming.Her brain had never been very smart. Especially compared with Younger Sister Da Qiao. She had never got the first place in the exam.Her personality wasn't likeable. She can't say nice things with her mouth. She also disliked to interact with strangers. She didn't know what she can do except studying.So she had to go to college no matter what!But the more she thought about it, the more nervous she became. After she found a seat and sat down, she couldn't help trembling.The teacher invigilating the exam hadn't come over yet. A young man sitting behind her saw her like this and poked her in the back with a pen.Qiao Dong He was startled. She turned around and looked at the other party like a frightened animal: \"Are you calling me?\"The male's name was Luo Jun Liang. His eyes fell on Qiao Dong He's face and he grinned: \"Don't you remember me?\"Qiao Dong He stared at him and finally shook her head: \"I don't remember.\"A look of disappointment flashed across Luo Jun Liang's face: \"We are from the same school, but I am in the second class. I bumped into you in the school cafeteria half a year ago and knocked down your lunch box. Do you really not remember?\"When Qiao Dong Hhe heard his words, she remembered: \"So it's you!\"Luo Jun Liang grinned and responded, \"That's right, it's me. My name is Luo Jun Liang. I'm so sorry about last time!\"Qiao Dong He waved her hand. Her face was a little red: \"It's okay. You have apologized to me before and even compensated for the meal!\"Luo Jun Liang smiled and said, \"I saw you shaking just now. Are you cold or are you too nervous?\"After being reminded by him, Qiao Dong He recalled her nervousness: \"I'm very nervous. I'm afraid I won't pass the exam.\"Luo Jun Liang spoke: \"If you can't pass, try again next year. Since the country has resumed enrollment, it will definitely not be the only one.\"Qiao Dong He pursed her lips and smiled. She didn't respond though.She was afraid that if she failed the exam this time, her mom wouldn't let her take the exam again. Instead, she would force her to go on a blind date.Although her grandmother can suppress her mom, it was very annoying to listen to her mom nagging at home every day.Seeing that she didn't answer, Luo Jun Liang continued, \"If you're still nervous in a while, just take a deep breath as you write 'people' in your hand three times in a row. You'll be relaxed soon.\"Qiao Dong He's eyes widened: \"Is this useful?\"\"Of course it works. I won't lie to you!\"Luo Jun Liang jollily nodded. The sunlight came in from the window and shone on his young face. It made his smile look extremely bright.Qiao Dong He didn't want to use this method in front of him. After thanking the other party in a low voice, she turned around.At this moment, the invigilator came. The noisy exam room became quiet at once.Seeing the serious face of the invigilator, Qiao Dong He's heartbeat began to speed up again. She thought about it and decided to use the method that Luo Jun Liang taught her just now; took a deep breath and wrote.Don't know if it was because of her mentality, she really calmed down after taking a few deep breaths.She couldn't help but be grateful to him.Before writing, she took a sip of the water that Young Sister Da Qiao prepared for her. Sugar was added. So it tasted sweet.Younger Sister Da Qiao had this kind of ability. No matter how ordinary the ingredients were, once they were in her hands, it can become better than others. It was an ordinary bottle of sugar water. The ones she brew were sweeter than those made by others.What was even more strange was that after drinking the water, the remaining tension in her heart disappeared.She felt that her mind couldn't be any more sober. After the exam paper was handed out, she felt that it was very easy to do the questions.She felt that this was the good luck brought to her by Younger Sister Da Qiao!After the exam in the morning, Qiao Dong He came out of the exam room.As soon as she came out, she found Younger Sister Da Qiao and her grandparents standing in the wind waiting for her. Her eyes teared up and she almost burst into tears.When Da Qiao saw her elder cousin sister come out, she immediately flew over, took out the prepared buns from her arms, and handed them over, \"Elder Cousin Sister, I just bought this bun. It's still hot. Hurry up and take a bite!\"Qiao Dong He was more and more moved. She reached out and rubbed her younger sister's hair with a smile: \"Why didn't you go back? The wind is so strong. It's easy to catch a cold waiting outside like this!\"Da Qiao shook her head: \"It's alright. We went to wait somewhere else in the middle. Just got here. Elder Cousin Sister, quickly eat!\"Qiao Dong He didn't hesitate, accepted the bun in Younger Sister Da Qiao's hand, and took a big bite.The meaty taste entered her mouth. It was her favorite meat bun.Younger Sister Da Qiao and grandparents were so nice to her. She was so blessed!When Qiao Dong He munched the bun, Luo Jun Liang happened to pass by. Seeing her wolfish look, he immediately laughed out loud. Her white teeth were particularly conspicuous in the sunlight.\"Cough cough...\"Qiao Dong He didn't expect him to pass by and happen to witness her unruly appearance. She suddenly choked and coughed.Luo Jun Liang saw that her family was there and didn't come. He merrily went to his family.Seeing Elder Cousin Sister cough until tears come out, Da Qiao quickly patted her back: \"Who is that person? How rude!\"Qiao Dong He's face instantly turned red. She muddled it through with a cough.The exam took two days.After the exam, Qiao Dong He felt that she did well in the exam. At least she could do all the questions. She didn't know whether it was right or wrong.After the exam, they stayed in the town for a half a day. Xue Chuan personally cooked a delicious meal for his granddaughter. While they were at it, he invited Wei couple over to thank them for helping to take care of Eldest Granddaughter during this period.Wei Family liked the two girls, Qiao Dong He and Da Qiao very much. They were gloomy for a while when they heard that they were going back in the afternoon.Da Qiao rushed to comfort them; saying that they would come here often in the future.Only then did the two elders perk up....When they returned to the production team, villagers immediately told them about Huo Family.The group was shocked when they found out.Unexpectedly, Huo Family's son who had been dead for 12 years actually came back to life. And he even used his own connections to help Huo Family get vindication!After the shock, they were happy for Huo Family.Huo Family's status had improved in recent years. In the end, they were still wicked ones. They can only work in the production team. No freedom at all.
