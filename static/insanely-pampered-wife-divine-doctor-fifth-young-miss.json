I\u2019ll go get you d.a.m.ned!\u201dWithin a large manor in the Imperial Capital City of the Dong Chen Kingdom, a voice filled with resentment resounded through a large manor.\u201cIs the Young Master awake?\u201dTwo figures scuttled in a hurry into the courtyard, and perked up their ears to listen. There was no noise and all was quiet, so quiet they thought they might have imagined it all.\u201cShould we take a peek into the room?\u201d One asked in a trembling voice, her fear was clear in her voice and could not be hidden upon the thought of entering the room.\u201cMaybe\u2026.. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t.\u201d The other figure said, \u201cWhen the Young Master wakes up, he will naturally call for us. If we barge into the Young Master\u2019s room just like this, we will be severely punished.\u201d\u201cBut if the Young Master wakes up, and does not see us around, we will still be punished! And what if the Young Master wakes up but he can\u2019t speak, then what do we do?\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 then we better go in and take a look, if the Young Master is not awake, we will just come back out again?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAfter discussing the matter through in hushed tones, the two of them tiptoed towards the main bedroom within the courtyard. They pushed the door open slowly and quietly treaded inside. They saw that the eyes of the figure on the bed were still tightly shut, and only after they saw the figure drew in a deep breath, did they slowly retreat out of the room.\u201cWhew, fortunately the Young Master has not awoken.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just wait in front of the door.\u201d\u201cHmm, I had not thought that the Young Master would be unconscious for so long.\u201d\u201cI heard that the General had wanted to go settle the score with the other party but the Young Master stopped him.\u201d\u201cPfft! The Young Master said, \u2018d.a.m.n it, when I wake up, I\u2019ll settle things with him myself!\u2019\u201d\u201cOur poor Young Master was so badly wounded, if the other Young Masters get to know about it, they will be so devastated.\u201d\u201cI heard that the other Young Masters will be back soon.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSima You Yue opened her eyes after the two maids left, the expression on her face was one of rage, she gritted her teeth in anger, looking like she was ready to bite.\u201cHiss\u2026\u2026\u201dShe sucked in a breath of cold air as she hissed in pain from the wounds on her face as they stretched and pulled with every emotion she displayed.\u201cd.a.m.n, this is no joke!\u201d Sima You Yue reached out to touch her face, however that attempt itself rendered another sharp stinging pain excruciating from her body as she stopped her movement and gave up.Listening to the maids chirping outside, once they mentioned Young Master, Sima You Yue could not help but roll her eyes.She was a female through and through, but she was asked to act like a boy by her grandfather, to wear boy\u2019s clothes, and to even walk and talk like one.\u201cYou are a fraud just as well!\u201d Sima You Yue cursed.Thinking back of her status in the twenty-first century as an accomplished a.s.sa.s.sin, she did not expect to suddenly appear here, stuck in the body of a 14-year-old girl!That\u2019s right, those curse words the two maids had heard earlier had indeed come right out of her mouth because she had been conned two times successively!Previously, she was the Organization\u2019s most powerful a.s.sa.s.sin, since she started working for the Organization she never once missed a target.Never would she have expected that the second person-in-charge of the Organization was jealous of the attention and recognition she had from her boss and took advantage of the boss\u2019 absence and made her perform a dangerous task. However, it was already too late when she realized that it was a trap. Because of the high stakes of billions of dollars, the Organization chose to abandon her and even prepared the most advanced bomb for her. She was blown into smithereens along with the building she was in.The process of death was too short, before she had time to curse, she fell into the darkness, and lost all consciousness.When she regained her consciousness, she was in a vast white s.p.a.ce and there was a faint silhouette beside her, it appeared in the same soul state like her. Before she could speak, the other spoke out: \u201cYou are in my body now.\u201dThe words she heard made her shocked to the extreme, shouldn\u2019t she be in h.e.l.l now? How did she end up in someone else\u2019s body?The other soul seemed to have read her thoughts and said: \u201cI do not know what\u2019s happening, but when I saw your soul, I simply pulled and you came in.\u201d\u201cEhhhhhh?!!!\u201d\u201cI am now dead, my life has come to an end. Since you can enter my body, you should be able to continue to live in place of me as long as you promise me, to take care of everything, I shall leave my body to you.\u201d The other soul said wistfully.\u201cReally?\u201d Sima You Yue asked in surprise. She really had a second chance in life?\u201cYes, but you have to swear to not only live as me on my behalf, but also to help me to clean up those tras.h.!.+\u201d\u201cAlright, I promise you.\u201d Sima You Yue answered in a straightforward manner. If I can live again, but also get rid of the life as an a.s.sa.s.sin, what more could she ask for? Before that though, she had her own matters to take care of. She wanted revenge on the Organization\u2019s second person-in-charge who plotted against her.\u201cIn that case, I will give my memory to you, remember that you promised to take revenge for me! Also, my grandfather and brothers are good, the matter I have not done yet is to to find my parents, I believe that they must still be living in some corner of the world.\u201d That silhouette become lighter and lighter as her voice became softer and softer as she slowly started to dissipate.Sima You Yue saw the regret and heart filled with emotion, she answered with resolution: \u201cDo not worry, I will help you find your parents.\u201d\u201cI do not think you are the kind of person who goes back on her words. Since you\u2019ve agreed, then I can rest in peace and leave it to you.\u201d As soon as that silhouette finished speaking, she turned into little specks of light and completely disappeared.Sima You Yue suddenly felt a strong pull, followed by a severe pain. Before she could find out what was happening, once again she lost consciousness.When she woke up, she was already lying down on a bed. She did not think she really grasped a second chance in life, but she as she looked around, the antique furnis.h.i.+ngs in the room made her speechless. She could not react for a moment and even thought that she was dreaming, however a sudden flash of insight made her break this thought that it was a dream. This was her reality now.\u201cd.a.m.n it!\u201d Sima You Yue started swearing after affirming the reality. \u201cThis is not even my world, so what if I live? I can not take my own revenge!\u201dAnd so as she continued to read the memory left behind, she had no more energy to curse and swear. She felt that she was conned by the other soul.This was not the earth she knew of the 21st century, but a continent called Yilin. There were no aircrafts nor high-rise buildings. It was a place where the strong was revered and the weak was crushed. Here, the air contained spiritual power and comprised of a variety of properties and people can rely on the absorption of spiritual power to cultivate and become stronger.This place was based entirely on the law of the jungle, where the strong are evidently favoured. The dignity of the strong could not be trampled on, if the weak dared to insult the strong, the strong could simply kill him directly!If one was a genius cultivator, one would be able to gain respect from all walks of life; if one had absolutely no talent in cultivation, then they were termed as trash and would be looked down upon.And the very body which Sima You Yue was stuck in was exactly a body that was looked down upon! The most infamous tras.h.!.+ Not a little practice of the foundation, was now 14 years old, and even spiritual power are not sensitive, not to mention the introduction of the body to practice it!Not only that, she was obviously a girl, but her grandfather had insisted she dressed as a boy, telling her it was to protect her. But no matter how she dressed, she still liked men, and deeply infatuated at that. She loved being surrounded by men all the time, and all their attempt at wooing at ingratiation of the female s.e.x!So the General\u2019s Residence Fifth Young Master \u2026 \u2026 was rumored to be bent.Translator\u2019s note:The Main Character\u2019s name is ????(Si mayou yu\u00e8). Sima is her family name while You Yue translates to (Serene Moon).

But when she thought back to her previous self as the top a.s.sa.s.sin of the twenty first century, she did not believe that she would not be able to carve out a path of her own niche even if she could not train and practise the way people did here!But when she realised the type of personality that previous owner of her body had and the reason that had gotten her killed dawned upon her, she suddenly felt weak.It must be said that her body\u2019s previous owner was rather pitiful. She had only gone to bring some food to the Capital City\u2019s most eligible Young Master, Murong An when she was seen to be a pest and Murong An\u2019s lackeys had given her a good thras.h.i.+ng holding nothing back as they kept scolding her, repeatedly ridiculing her and calling her trash.And the supposedly most cultured and refined, most eligible Young Master of the Capital City had just watched on as she was badly thrashed up, and had continued with his merriment with the fawning beauties all around him.Her body\u2019s previous owner had been beaten to within an inch of her life and when she was carried back to the General\u2019s Residence, she saw her grandfather,Sima Lie and just managed to tell him she would exact her own revenge before she fell into a dead faint, and stopped breathing soon after.Although she had promised to take revenge for her predecessor, however you looked at it, this all started from her own actions! Who had asked the previous Sima You Yue who kept pestering people to their breaking point until they felt extremely tired and suffocated? After appearing in front of the person whom had been relentlessly pestering you, it would be strange if that person didn\u2019t do anything at all!\u201cBut that Murong An actually watched on at the sidelines without any attempt to stop them. Well, do not worry, I will help you exact your revenge on those people.\u201d Sima You Yue softly promised. \u201cHowever, this body of yours really can\u2019t cultivate? Those people are all geniuses of the Imperial Academy , if I can\u2019t cultivate, seeking revenge would be very troublesome. I can\u2019t even check your body now, d.a.m.n, these injuries are really bothersome! How long more would it take to recover?\u201d She lamented in exasperation.As her injuries were too heavy, after grumbling for a moment she felt exhausted and fell into deep slumber. However, she did not sleep well at all, her brows were constantly wrinkled and her whole body was drenched in cold sweat.\u201cXimen You Yue, so what if you are an unparalleled genius of the Divine World? You will still die by my hands today and your whole Ximen family can all go to h.e.l.l and reunite there!\u201d\u201cXimen You Yue, do you know what this is? This is a high grade spirit artifact \u2013 the Soul Lamp Lock. Once your soul is sucked inside, you can never reincarnate. Even if you want to destroy your own soul, you cannot do that! Haven\u2019t you always been suppressing me wherever you went? You can now take your time to enjoy this Soul Lamp Lock I\u2019ve specially prepared for you! Hahahahahaha\u2026\u201dA shrill female voice suddenly rang in her head and her cackling slowly trailed off. Amidst a dense fog, Sima You Yue saw a woman holding onto a lamp.\u201cYou\u2019re missing a part of your soul? Even if you reincarnate, you won\u2019t remember anything from this life! Even your strength will not be restored. Try to repair your soul, see what kind of miracles you can create.\u201d Another voice echoed in this dense fog as the wind slowly stirred.\u201cSima You Yue, who asked you to be so accomplished and recognised? Today, Boss is not around, whatever complaints you have, you can directly complain to the King of h.e.l.l! These are the most advanced explosives, dying by them can be considered your good fortune\u2026\u201d\u201cSima You Yue\u2026DIE!!!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..!\u201dSima You Yue suddenly jolted awake, breathing heavily as she gasped for air. Her entire back was thoroughly soaked in sweat and her damp hair clung onto her cheeks as she felt her whole body tremble, not sure if it was from fear or anger.\u201cYoung Master, is everything alright?\u201d A maid knocked on the door and asked from outside.Sima You Yue took a few deep breaths to calm herself down and replied: \u201cI\u2019m fine, you can go.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d After the maid replied and the footsteps trailed off, there was no further movement outside.After taking in a few more deep breaths, Sima You Yue endured the pain that bore through her as she struggled to pour herself a cup of water. Her hands were trembling as she steadied the teapot and only after drinking three cups of water did she finally calm down.Thinking back on her dream, why were there two names?\u201cSima You Yue\u2026Ximen You Yue\u2026\u201d She murmured the two names. \u201cWho is Ximen You Yue\u2026?\u201dWhy did her heart wrench in pain when this name was mentioned?\u201dAfter struggling back to bed, Sima You Yue quietly stared at the antique mosquito net with her big eyes, her mind kept replaying the memories of the dream she just had. Also, what did that strange voice mean and who was that woman? Who was this Ximen You Yue?The voices of the maids were getting louder as they approached her room.\u201cGeneral.\u201d\u201cHas Fifth Young Master awakened?\u201d A slightly raspy elderly voice could be heard.\u201cGeneral, the Young Master just screamed a moment ago and when I enquired, the Young Master replied that he was fine and asked me to retreat. There\u2019s no sound of movement inside, he may have fallen asleep again.\u201d The maid replied.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ve got it, you two can go now.\u201d\u201cYes, General.\u201dThe door creaked open and Sima You Yue quickly closed her eyes, only to hear the sound of footsteps slowly walking towards her, and stopped at the bedside.\u201cWell, enough of this pretense, I know you\u2019ve woken up.\u201d Sima Lie looked at the person in bed who still had her eyes shut tight.She\u2019s been discovered\u2026Sima You Yue slowly opened her eyes and peered at the elderly man standing by her bed, watching him quietly.This was Dong Chen Kingdom\u2019s strongest man, he looked exactly like her memories, a head of grey hair with an astute build and eyes full of vigor. He looked at her affectionately, however his eyes also reflected a tinge of distress.\u201cDoes it hurt very badly?\u201d Seeing that You Yue was quiet, he moved to sit by her bed gently as he asked her in a voice full of concern.Sima You Yue nodded her head. It was really painful! So painful that it felt as if her bones were being crushed and grounded into powder.As if performing magic, Sima Lie flipped his hand and a jade bottle suddenly appeared in his hand. Sima You Yue was startled. Although she knew that interspatial rings existed in this world, seeing it working before her still shocked her.In Sima Lie\u2019s hands was a jade bottle which he had retrieved from his interspatial ring.\u201cThis is the 2nd tier medicinal pill that Master s.h.i.+ refined. It would speed up your recovery, quick, eat it and it won\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d Sima Lie coaxed as he opened and a black pill rolled out from within and he stuffed it into Sima You Yue\u2019s mouth in a practised manner.As soon as she swallowed the black pill, a strong bitter aftertaste a.s.saulted her mouth. Before she could say anything, Sima Lie quickly followed up by stuffing something sweet into her mouth.\u201cMaster s.h.i.+ said that the pill may be bitter but this is good stuff, it\u2019s a 2nd tier medicinal pill, so bear with it and you\u2019ll get better soon.\u201dSima You Yue was aware that elixirs with miraculous properties existed in this world. It was just like the western pills from her past life, but its effects were so many times better than those pills. The types and varieties were many and myriad and they had all kinds of uses. For example, just like the one she just ingested was used to treat injuries, there were also others that helped regain Spirit Powers, those that helped regain strength, endurance and many others.The elixirs were also segregated into tiers, first tier, second tier, third tier and so forth. The first to third tiers were termed common grade pills, fourth to sixth grade, medium grade pills, while the seventh to ninth grade were advanced grade pills. Alchemists similarly had a ranking system, primarily divided into three ranks \u2013 Rudimentary, Medium and Advanced.The efficiency of each pill also varied with each tier and were further divided three levels, namely low, medium &amp; advanced.Needless to say, the higher the level, the higher the efficiency and that effectively equates to a higher price.Sigh, the previous soul did not really understand much of these as her mind was completely filled with faces of handsome men. Since she could not cultivate, she spent all her time and effort thinking of men, she only started 2 days of cla.s.ses at the Imperial Academy and stopped attending henceforth. Sima Lie doted heavily on her and spoiled her silly, and even left the matter of attending school in her own hands, never once forcing his own opinions on her. Since she did not want to go to school, he did not force her to attend. However, this had in turn made her even more ignorant and her literacy and knowledge was stuck at the the bare basics.Current schedule: 2 Regular Chapters a week.Supported Chapter: Sorry, not at the moment. =)|Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay|Chapter 3: \u201cEnemy Encounter\u201d\u201cYue Er, don\u2019t be upset, the matter of revenge can be put on hold. More importantly, wait till you\u2019ve fully recovered and let your brothers escort you along when you go and to take your revenge. See who dares resist then! Whoever dares to resists will face their wrath, you can slowly savour the taste of returning those imbeciles the favour \u2026and beat the living daylights out of them!\u201d Sima Lie heartily said when he saw that his dear granddaughter had not spoken a single word since and thought that she was still angry. This was his manner of coaxing her.However, Grandfather, are you sure this is the right way to coax anyone? Wasn\u2019t this just digging a deeper pit than previously? Such encouragement would just spell more trouble for the future. However, in the past life, she was an orphan and after hearing the \u2018encouraging words\u2019 of Sima Lie, she felt a warmth emanate from her heart.So this is how it felt like to have family..Within minutes of eating the bitter medicinal pill, the immense pain she previously had all disappeared and within half an hour, all her injuries were fully healed! It was the first time she had experienced such a miraculous feat! This opened a whole new door of curiosity to this world she was now in.\u2018Grandfather, this stuff is simply amazing!\u2019 Sima You Yue\u2019s eyes sparkled as she sat up. She felt rejuvenated and full of life!\u201cHaha, yes, not bad at all.\u201d He chortled, nodding happily as he looked at her with an affectionate gaze. \u201cSigh.. if only someone from our family was an alchemist then you wouldn\u2019t have had to suffer so long. Even getting this one pill took a bit of trouble.\u201cDon\u2019t we have some alchemists working for us?\u201d Sima You Yue asked indignantly, weren\u2019t they the General\u2019s Residence, what were some mere medicinal pills to them?\u201cWe have hired a few and but only have stashes of the common grade tier one pills and only a handful of tier two pills. However those tier two pills we possess are not meant for healing, which was why I had to go to Master s.h.i.+ and specially request for that tier two pill from him.\u201d He looked apologetically at Sima You Yue. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s all my fault. Tsk, but if it wasn\u2019t for my fiery temper that caused a rift between our residence and the alchemists in the city, it wouldn\u2019t had taken such a long time. Sorry you had to bear such pain for so long.\u201d He looked down and said in a self-deprecating tone.\u201cGrandfather! Please don\u2019t blame yourself, if you want to blame, it\u2019s all those alchemists own fault for being annoying and unlikable! Since you do not like them, I also do not like them! If I do become an alchemist one day, I\u2019ll slap them in the face and show them what true alchemy is!\u201d\u201cHaha, well then, I shall be looking forward to that.\u201d He laughed in glee.However, none of them seemed to have remembered at that moment, that one has to first be able to cultivate in order to be an alchemist. To concoct a pill, spiritual energy is used on the pill furnace and an alchemist requires one to not only sense the spirit energy but to have excellent control over it as well. Sime You Yue was not even able to sense a shred of energy, what more to fire a pill furnace with spiritual energy?Due to the effects of the medicinal pill her grandfather got for her, Sima You Yue recovered quickly. The next morning, the curious and lively Sima You Yue went out alone to explore the streets.Although she has memories of this place, she still wanted to see with her own eyes what this new world of intrigue was like.\u201cThis world is really amazing!\u201d Sima You Yue exclaimed in excitement. After visiting a couple of streets, she stopped in front of a shop which had on display a mult.i.tude of spirit beasts and gasped in shock when she saw one talking.\u201cOh, is this not Fifth Young Master? Please come in Fifth Young Master! What would you like today? We have a few new Spirit Beasts in store today! Would you like to have a look?\u201d A amiable shopkeeper stepped forward to warmly welcome her, evident that he was familiar with the Sima You Yue.She quickly searched her memories for a moment and realized why that shopkeeper gave her such a warm welcome. Indeed, the Sima You Yue before often patronized this store and bought spirit beasts and gifted them to various Young Masters around town to please them.Since she did that on a regular basis, she quickly became well acquainted with this shopkeeper.\u201cFifth Young Master, please have a look at our latest arrivals. We have here, a fifth low-ranked firefox. We also have a sixth low-ranked wind wolf. How is it? Quite good, aren\u2019t they?\u201d The storekeeper smiled as he introduced the spirit beasts that were locked up in the cages before them.Sima You Yue looked at the wind wolf that looked back at her without a trace of life or emotion, it\u2019s fur was very full and glossy, something of high quality. \u201cOh, I have no intention to buy anything as I didn\u2019t bring any money out with me today. Since I can\u2019t even establish any contract with any spirit beasts, why do I even need to buy one?\u201dWho did not know that the General Residence\u2019s Fifth Young Master was labelled as trash and could not establish any spirit link, how could he have any contracts with spirit beasts? To establish a contract, one must first have a spirit link stemming from the Spirit Master. Hence whenever the Fifth Young Master bought a spirit beast, it was always given away as a gift. However for the shopkeeper, it didn\u2019t matter as long as he could make some business.\u201cIf Fifth Young Master likes it, you can bring the spirit beast back first and send someone to pay for it later. Oh! The last time Young Master Murong An wanted a wind wolf but there was no stock then. You have to quickly act on this or else it\u2019s going to be sold out soon!\u201d The shopkeeper prattled on.If it was the Sima You Yue before, she would definitely have bitten the bait and bought the wind wolf in a heartbeat, anything that Murong An wanted, she would have no qualms about giving it to him no matter the cost.However, Sima You Yue heard the words of the shopkeeper and simply replied: \u201cWell, if I see him, I\u2019ll let him know.\u201dAfterwhich she turned and left the shop.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dFor a few seconds the shopkeeper could not react. Only after she had left the shop did he touch his own forehead in stupor and muttered: \u201cI don\u2019t have a fever, how am I hallucinating? This Sima You Yue not only heard Murong An wanted it, he simply just left without buying it! And so calmly at that? Did the sun rise from the west today?\u201dSime You Yue thought back of what just happened in the shop. Even a meager shopkeeper was using Murong An\u2019s name to sell a spirit beast to her, how well known was she for liking Murong An?Thinking back on the spirit wolf, she softly sighed again in amazement of this new magical world she now lived it. Although the previous Sima You Yue could not cultivate, but because of Murong An, she did some homework and knew a thing of two about spirit beasts.This world has these spirit beasts and they ranked accordingly: Low rank, Saint Rank and Divine Rank.Low Ranked spirit beasts had a bit of intelligence and could understand some human words and respond to simple commands, however a Divine Ranked spirit beast was very intelligent and completely mastered the human language and converse proficiently.Spirit Masters could establish a contract with spirit beasts through sharing a spirit link. However because spirit beasts are caught from the wild, if they have not been tamed, their wild and frenzied spirit energy will try to take over the link and this might make the cultivator incur a backlash instead.Beast Tamers had the ability to temporarily stabilize and curb the innate wild and frenzied spiritual energy of these spirit beasts and calm them down. This would make the spirit beasts docile before establis.h.i.+ng any contracts and reduce any risks of backlash. This was the main reason why Beast Tamers were very highly sought after. After establis.h.i.+ng a contract with the Spirit Master, the spirit beast will regain back its ferociousness, however due to the contract, they are not able to hurt their contracting Spirit Master.After strolling around the streets aimlessly for a period, Sima You Yue decided to head back. As she was still thinking about the matters of a Beast tamer, she did not pay attention to her surroundings and carelessly ran into a person head on as she turned into a small alley.\u201cWho the h.e.l.l has no eyes?! Asking for death?!\u201d Exclaimed a man who was clutching his head, fuming away. When his eyes laid to rest on Sima You Yue, his lips curled up into a taunting smile: \u201cSo it\u2019s our infamous tras.h.!.+ How are you still alive? It seems that my punches were too light that time!\u201dSima You Yue was still dazed from the sudden collision but when she looked up after hearing the other person\u2019s words, she narrowed her eyes.This person was none other than one of the lackeys that had a hand in beating her up that day! Since she had promised revenge for the previous Sima You Yue, now, let\u2019s just start with this person in front!Misty\u2019s notes: (\u6708\u513f)Yue Er is an affectionate way to call someone.

Do you really think that by giving Murong An a spirit beast, that would raise your standing? If I were you, I would have committed suicide long ago! Just by being alive is simply wasting food!\"\"Have you said enough?\" Sima You Yue snapped back as she glared at him coldly. \"The last time you ganged up with them to beat me up, didn't you? Well, count yourself unlucky that you've ran into me today.\"\"Ha ha ha ha ha!\" Li Cheng was amused by the tone and arrogance that came out of Sima You Yue's mouth. \"Listen to this! Wow!

Since I did not kill you that day, let me solve that today and save the face of us men!\" He roared in contempt as he gathered spiritual energy and condensed them into a ball of red light on his hand.Although Sima You Yue was walking on the crowded streets just moments ago, she had made a detour and had aimlessly wandered off into a small and quiet alley. Killing Sima You Yue right here will not lave any traces and would pose no problems at all, hence Li Cheng had started off with such a vicious move! He had been unhappy with Sima You Yue's very existence for a long time, although born a trash, Sima You Yue was still of the distinguished General's lineage. How unfair was this!Sima You Yue looked at the growing ball of red light in Li Cheng's hand and knew this was a ball of condensed spiritual energy, not something her current body can resist if she met it head on. She needed to interrupt him before he completed it! As soon as she made her decision, her body rushed forward with a dagger in her right hand as she aimed for his neck.Li Cheng was inwardly surprised, not only did that trash not run away with his tail between his legs like usual, he actually tried to attack him! This Sima You Yue before him was like a different person altogether! Sima You Yue's action was decisive and nimble. She swiftly reached him in moments and he felt a chill as the blade rushed towards him.Just as the blade was about to touch his neck, Li Cheng hurriedly released the incomplete red ball and threw it at her as he stumbled a few steps back.Although the ball was incomplete, it still harnessed a terrible energy for Sima You Yue. She knew she could not take it head on as she quickly twisted her body and dodged to the right. However, as the distance was too close and the speed in which he threw it was too fast, she did not manage to completely dodge it and she felt a burning pain on her left arm.\"Booooom!\" As soon as the ball of light touched the earth, it blew a big hole into the ground.Sima You Yue looked at the hole it made, she shuddered. She was inwardly shocked that such a small ball of converged spiritual energy could harness such an explosive power. Somewhat similar to the bombs in her previous world but this was much more powerful! Moreover this was created from a mere person\u2026'Hisss'She sucked in a breath of cold air as she looked at her arm. She let out a sigh, even though that ball of light merely sc.r.a.ped by, her sleeves were burnt to a crisp and her entire arm was burned.\"Hahaha! Now you know my prowess!\" Li Cheng did not expect Sima You Yue to actually dodge that , however he felt a burst of pride when he saw her shocked expression from his spiritual energy.\"To create an energy ball like that, is something trash like you will never be able to achieve! How about I give you a hand and send you on your way to reincarnate faster, perhaps you may be able to practice cultivation in your next life!\"When Sima You Yue saw that Li Cheng had started converging energy on his hand again, she naturally would not give him another chance to gather more spiritual energy.Li Cheng did not expect Sima You Yue to be even faster than before and he had barely managed to converge a little energy. Despite her injury, she had reached him in mere seconds. This time when she appeared in front of him, she lifted her leg up and swiftly kicked his stomach mercilessly as he flew backwards and landed heavily on the ground with a thud.Li Cheng spat out a mouthful of blood and he dumbfoundedly looked at the crimson patch on the ground. That trash actually made him bleed? He roared in anger: \"A mere trash like you dare to hit me?! Cough cough\"Sima You Yue silently appeared by his side and kicked him before he could stand properly and he fell to the ground.A spirit master's power lay in the manipulation of spiritual energy but their body was no different from an average person. She ruthlessly kicked him a couple more times till he could no longer muster any strength to stand as he laid sprawled on the ground, groaning in pain.Sima You Yue stood in front of him and sneered: \"Didn't you like to kick me? Well, how\u2019s the feeling of being kicked instead?\"In her past life, she was very familiar with the human anatomy and she knew where the weak points in the human body were. She lifted her leg and gave another kick.\"You b.a.s.t.a.r.d! Wait till I\u2019ve recovered, I\u2019m definitely going to kill you!\" The pain that Li Cheng felt was so overwhelming that he had lost all his rationality as he shouted incessantly.\"Thanks for reminding me, when cutting down weeds, you must pull them out from the roots, otherwise the weeds will return with the spring breeze. Should I give you a chance for revenge?\"Sima You Yue laughed lightly and kicked him a few more times, like what he did to the previous Sima You Yue; she brutally kicked him till he fainted.Thinking back on how he swore revenge, although she did not fear his revenge, she did not want to deal with the extra trouble. Since his smelly mouth kept calling her trash repeatedly, why not let him experience it himself?When her gaze landed on the rock by the side of the crumbled wall, a smile blossomed on her face.\"Although you are only a lackey, however you truly wanted her life. I can\u2019t let you off so easily. Since you abhor trash so much, how about I let you have a taste of being one? You don\u2019t have to thank me!\"\"Ah\u2014\u2013\" A shrill scream resounded from the small alley.After throwing away the blood-stained rock, she clapped her hands and said: \"Well, you wanted her life and now I\u2019ve crippled your meridians. This can be considered revenge for her, when you wake up, enjoy the taste of being called trash~ ouch.. it really hurts..\"She clutched her injured arm as she walked out of the quiet alley, and she una.s.sumingly walked back to the General's residence as if nothing had happened.After she left, two figures appeared at the alley. One was dressed in purple, a devilishly handsome face matched with an attractive figure as he exuded an air of arrogance. Although he did not express anything on his face, his eyes flashed a trace of interest. Next to him was a figure with fiery red hair and he was cloaked in a mantle of flames. If one took another look, one would realize that he was not a human but was a spirit beast!\"Didn\u2019t expect to come across such an interesting spectacle, a spirit master being crippled by a mere girl who doesn\u2019t have a shred of spirit energy! What courage!\" Fire Kirin praised.Wu Lingyu looked at the bloodied person on the ground as he thought back on how that girl who did not even bat an eyelid when she crippled his meridians. He gave an enigmatic smile and said: \"Yeah, pretty interesting.\"Although she had used an illusion ring to cover up her gender, such petty tricks did not work on them. With one glance, they could see through the guise.\"Master, you are the esteemed Holy Son of the Sage Pavilion, please do not make such an expression!\" Fire Kirin gravely reminded Wu Lingyu when he saw the careless smile slip when he looked at Sima You Yue.Wu Lingyu glanced at Fire Kirin as his expression returned to his usual aloofness, devoid of any emotions and they both suddenly disappeared, not a single trace of them ever having been there left.Current schedule: 2 Regular Chapters a week.Supported Chapter: Sorry, not at the moment. =)|Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She had only stepped out for a short while this morning and when she returned she was seriously injured yet again! She just recovered last night\u2026\u201cMy G.o.d, Fifth Young Master, how did you get hurt! Who hurt you?! Quick, let me have a look at your injury.\u201d The housekeeper in the yard quickly rushed forward when he saw Sima You Yue's injured arm.Looking at his distressed eyes, Sima You Yue smiled and said: \"Uncle Quan, I\u2019m fine, just burnt a little of my skin, it\u2019s nothing.\"\"A little? How could you call that a little!\" He looked at her as his heart winced.\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing, it doesn\u2019t even hurt that much, I'll just go back and get the maids to apply some medicine on it and I'll be fine.\u201d Sima You Yue comforted him.Although the people outside had always labelled her as trash wherever she went, however all that was different in the General's Residence. No one has ever slighted her nor looked down on her. Moreover, because she could not cultivate to be a spirit master, they felt distressed for her and spoilt her even more. Her grandfather, her brothers and even all the servants and maids doted heavily on her, only the previous Sima You Yue did not know how to appreciate these affections and always made them worry.\"Well, quickly go and let the maids help you tend to your wound, I'm going to ask the General for another good medicinal pill for you.\" Uncle Quan said.She had already ate the most expensive medicinal pill in the residence, where else could they find another one? She nodded absentmindedly and went back to her courtyard.She did not have many maids serving her, in addition to the ones Chun Quan and Yun Yue whom she had met yesterday, there were two that were in the midst of cooking. They were shocked when they saw that she was wounded, and quickly tended to her wound.Looking at their swift and familiar movements, she could not help but wonder, just how many times did former Sima You Yue get injured? Looking at their practised and fluid movements, one could easily tell how seasoned they were in this.After treating the wound, Chun Quan took out a medicinal pill and popped it into Sima You Yue's mouth. However this was a tier one medicinal pill but Sima You Yue was injured by spiritual energy and so it wasn\u2019t that effective.After a short while, Sima Lie came to see her and when his eyes landed on her injured arm, he furrowed his brows and asked in a very distressed and angry tone: \"Why did you go out alone again!\"\"Grandfather\u2026\" when she saw that he was in a rage, she coquettishly held onto his sleeves and pulled it gently. \"I just wanted to go out for a short stroll to get some fresh air and did not expect to run into one of the men that beat me up that day. Hence I taught him a lesson, I used a rock and smashed till he became a trash that would never be able to cultivate any more! Compared to him, I\u2019m in a much better condition. This is nothing, it will heal up in a few days.\"Frankly, in her past life, she had suffered various degrees of injuries ranging from gunshot wounds to stab wounds. This injury was really nothing in her eyes, the most it would leave an ugly scar on her arm.Sima You Yue did not kick up a huge fuss like previous times and this comforted Sima Lie as this was more fitting of a 'Young Master' of his valiant General's Residence! He took out a porcelain bottle and emptied it as a lone pill rolled out. \"This is the last medicinal pill that Master s.h.i.+ refined, quickly, eat it.\"\"Grandfather, I'm alright, it's really nothing, this will heal up in no time. This medicinal pill is so valuable, keep it for emergencies next time.\" She retorted as she nudged his hands away.\"What do you mean by nothing! Your whole arm's burnt so badly, you still say it\u2019s nothing?! No matter what, we are the esteemed General's Residence, we won\u2019t be put in a sorry position just because of a mere medicinal pill! Be good, eating it will heal you up in no time.\" Sima Lie tried to coax her into eating the pill as he brought it to up to her mouth again.Sima You Yue obediently ate the medicinal pill, although the pill was very bitter, she felt her heart swell with overwhelming sweetness.Past life, she was an orphan, and she was brought up by the Organization, and went under their tough and rigorous training. No one had ever cared for her, she was only a tool in their eyes. Never had she expected to experience the feeling of being spoilt and loved like this.Grandfather. You are henceforth my grandfather, she swore silently in her heart.\"Hahahahahahah, Fifth Brother is all grown up now! You even know how to comfort grandfather!\"At his time, a hearty voice came from the door and four men strode in. They were the other young masters of the Sima Residence \u2013 Sima You Qi, Sima You Ming, Sima You Ran and Sima You Le.The voice belonged to the eldest Brother, Sima You Qi.\"Big Brother, Second Brother, Third Brother, Fourth Brother, why are all of you back at the same time?\" Sima You Yue looked at the four men that just entered.\"We heard that you were beaten up, of course we all rushed back to see you, it was a coincidence that our timing clashed.\" Big Brother replied as he studied her from head to toe, as he asked in concern: \"Are you alright? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere else?\"They were all scattered around in different places, however when they heard that she was seriously injured, they had put everything down and rushed back without second thoughts.Sima You Yue shook her head as she rea.s.sured them and said: \"No, don\u2019t worry, the medicinal pill that Grandfather gave me is really amazing! I\u2019m not hurting anywhere at all.\"\"Grandfather, you went to seek an alchemist?\" Second Brother Sima You Ming asked.\"Well, the ones we had in store were too low in grades so I went to seek Master s.h.i.+ out to refine two medicinal pills.\" Sima Lie replied.\"That guy had been coveting our two hundred year old ginseng, don\u2019t tell me that you used that in exchange?\" Big Brother Sima You Qi had been managing the household affairs, hence he was well aware of the matters regarding the General's Residence most clearly.Sima Lie nodded his head. \"I requested for the two tier medicinal pill from him and he told me that these tier two medicinal pills were really difficult to refine and he only had a few. They were all precious and invaluable and when he asked me to use the ginseng to exchange for them, in my haste I agreed.\"\"A second tier medicinal pill costs twenty gold coins, while a two hundred year old ginseng costs at least fifty gold coins. But considering this in exchange for Fifth Brother's recovery, this was worth it.\" Sima You Ran said, not at all concerned with the loss of the two hundred year old ginseng.\"Yes, the loss of that ginseng cannot be compared with our brother. As long as he is alright, nothing else matters.\" Fourth Brother Sima You Le affirmed.Sima You Yue sat on her bed as she looked at the five men who were chattering by her bedside. Listening to them fawning over her well-being more than the loss of the precious ginseng, her heart sighed, how lucky the previous Sima You Yue was to have so many people doting on her.Now this world used coins as the main currency. 1 Gold Coin = 100 Silver Coins = 1000 copper coins. The majority of the population used copper and silver coins while the rich mainly used gold coins.Twenty gold coins was enough to feed an ordinary family of five for a year! However they dotingly splurged on her and were concerned only about her recovery and nothing else.\"Fifth Brother, who was the perpetrator? Tell us and we'll go take revenge for you!\" Fourth Brother Sima You Le, who looked older than than Sima You Yue by 3 to 4years was the most hotheaded of them all.The General Residence had five young masters \u2013 First Young Master 29 years old, Second Young Master 24 years old, Third Young Master 22 years old, Fourth Young Master 18 years old and Fifth Young Master 14 years old. The first four were renowned geniuses in Dong Chen Kingdom. First Young Master was a ninth ranked spirit master, Second and Third Young Masters were already fifth ranked while the Fourth Young Master had already been acknowledged as a level one spirit master. Having attained that rank at such a young age was already an accomplishment and the genes in this family was rather alarming.Only the infamous Fifth Young Master had no talent in this aspect, he could not even sense the spirit energy in the surroundings. He was not even qualified to be the lowest ranked spirit master, he was simply tras.h.!.+Hearing Sima You Le asking for the perpetrators, Second Brother also chimed in and exclaimed loudly as he gnashed his teeth: \"Fifth Brother, who was it! Let us brothers help you take revenge!\"Current schedule: 2 Regular Chapters a week.Supported Chapter: Sorry, not at the moment. =)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Sima You Yue has grown up. I will not be so willful in the future.\"\"Good! Very good! Yue er has grown up!\" Sima Lie chortled excitedly.\"Grandfather, I wasn't very sensible before. I've made you and all my brothers worry about me constantly. It was all my fault, I'm sorry.\" Sima You Yue said.From the previous Sima You Yue's memory, she could see that she was really a troublemaker and because of those handsome men outside, she had hurt her family many times. However in her heart, she still loved her family deeply, or else she wouldn\u2019t have asked a wandering soul to let her replace her in this life, as she did now want to cause them grief lest they know that she had died.\"Let the past be the past, as long as Fifth Brother can acknowledge his past undoings, it is good enough. Moreover, we\u2019ve never once blamed you before in the past.\" Third Bother Sima You Yan said.The others nodded in agreement.\"Well, I know my errors and will not continue on. I\u2019m going to live a good life from now.\"\"Haha, that\u2019s for the best. Since you\u2019ve said that you'll exact your own revenge, we brothers will not interfere! Whatever you need, just tell us! No need to stand on ceremony, just give us the word and we'll be there!\"Sima You Yue felt her eyes moisten before she knew it, and she did not know if it was because of her own feelings of being moved or the feelings left deeply imprinted in this body of hers. These overprotective brothers of hers had unknowingly left a deep impression in her heart.\"Ok, we'll let Fifth Brother rest, no matter how good the effects the medicinal pill is, he will still feel some fatigue.\" Big Brother said thoughtfully.\"Well, it is getting late, we'll head back first Fifth Brother, if you need anything remember to call us! Don\u2019t head out in secret again!\"\"Yeah! What if you go out by yourself and get hurt again? So be good and don't wander out alone again!\"\"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\"Only after many, many, many reminders did her grandfather and four brothers finally leave.When she was finally alone, she let out a soft sigh filled with envy. \"You are really very lucky to have such a good family that love you so deeply. I never thought that I could feel what it's like to have a family, experiencing such care and concern\u2026so..thank you, I will live my life well in place of you.\" Sima You Yue swore in her heart.After sorting out her emotions, Sima You Yue called out for her maids.\"Young Master.\" They gently pushed the door open and bowed before her.\"I want to take a bath.\" She said simply, too tired to say anything more as she looked at the two beautiful maids.\"Yes, Young Master. Please wait for a moment while we prepare it.\"They quickly went out to prepare and soon came back with a large barrel and jostled in and out of the room with buckets of hot water.\"Young Master, your bath is ready.\"\"Alright, you may leave.\" She waved them away and only after ensuring that they had closed the door behind them did she come down from the bed.As she walked towards the wooden barrel, she peeled off her robes, layer after layer and by the time she stood before her bath, she was completely naked. She looked down at her flat chest and continued gazing further down, muttering grudgingly: \"Really look like a man..\"She carefully climbed into the bath and immersed her body completely into the water as she started to relax. In her previous life, she really enjoyed soaking in baths as she felt as though all the fatigue and all the pain would be washed away and she felt that she could go on doing what she did. It refreshed her mind and rejuvenated her will.As the hot water in the bath started to cool down, she stretched out her left hand and looked carefully. On her left finger was a ring, and this ring was the same ring from memory that Sima Lie had reminded her time and time again to never remove it. From the memories, she had it from the beginning, since she was a young child. Sima Lie had told Sima You Yue that it was a ring which was imbued with magic and would make her look like a boy. He had told her to never ever take it off especially in front of anyone else.But nevertheless, the Sima You Yue then would still take the ring off from time to time when she was alone in the room. To prevent her secret from leaking out, she had gravely warned the maids to never enter the room unless she had called for them.Now she had to examine what was wrong with her her own body so she removed the ring to remove the effects of the ring. She reached out and deftly touched the edge of the ring where there was a small b.u.t.ton. She turned it gently and heard a small click as her body instantly transformed into that of a young maiden.She placed her fingers on her left wrist, carefully feeling her pulse.In the past, although she was an a.s.sa.s.sin, on the surface, her ident.i.ty was of a Medical College a.s.sociate Professor of Traditional Chinese Medicine, moreover she was the youngest a.s.sociate Professor of the school. They usually lived their day to day lives normally for their cover unless they had to take on their missions.After taking her pulse, she had on a solemn expression as she let go of her wrist and raised her hands and found one red and black dot like a mole on her armpits.She had this feeling that something was wrong with the body and suspected that it could be the reason why she was unable to cultivate. She used her right index finger to touch the dot under her left armpit and in a daze, she murmured: \"This body really has a problem\u2026\"She quickly dressed herself up and reverted her appearance to that of a male and stood in front of the mirror. She looked at the reflection, although it was not a devastatingly handsome face, it was still above average however it had on delicate features, no wonder coupled with her erratic behaviour, people had thought that she was bent.She called for the maids to come in to clear the bath. One was called Yun Yue, another was Chun Jian, both were rather poetic in her opinion. The two were waiting outside awaiting further instructions, not daring to enter on their own unless they heard their Young Master call for them. They had been serving by their Young Master's side for some time and had seen how their Young Master would punish those disobedient ones who did not heed his instructions. Hence after seeing so many other maids and servants come and go, they were the two obedient ones who had been by his side for the longest time, although they still harboured some fear of him.\"Yun Yue, Chun Jian, I'm hungry.\" She glanced over at them.Those who cultivated could absorb spiritual energy from the environment to support the body and wouldn't go hungry so easily. The higher their level, the longer they could go on without food, for those who were in the top ranks, they did not even need to eat. However to satisfy their taste buds, most people still ate three meals a day.What more for Sima You Yue who was labelled a trash, she had no choice in that matter and eating was a necessity.\"Your humble one has already prepared your meal, would you like me to serve it now?\" Yun Yue said carefully.\"Yes! You're the best!\" One she heard that there was food, her whole mood improved and she felt spirited.Past life, although she was busy living the double life of murder and medical research, food was an indispensable part of her life. She had even taken the extra effort and time to learn and mastered the art of cooking. From Sichuan cuisine to Hunan cuisine, she was well versed in them. This was another aspect in life she would not compromise in.Hi, sorry will not be able to adhere to a regular release this month, will pick up the pace in march!

However when Yun Yue brought the food in, her mind reeled. Afterwhich she blanked out momentarily as she went into a state of shock.\"This..This is the food you prepared for me?\" She asked cautiously, as a trembling finger pointed to the food on the table with dishes that looked as though they had only been cooked and blanched in water.Yesterday, she only had the simple meat porridge and did not really know what the food here was like. When she saw the plain dishes spread out before her, she was shocked to the core.\"Please forgive us!\" Both maids quickly dropped their knees onto the round as they started knocking their heads onto the ground while begging for mercy.\"What are you doing?! I'm not blaming you, quickly get up!\" Sima You Yue cried out when she saw the huge reaction of the two maids.Only then did she see from the memory that the previous Sima You Yue was very strict and this has caused fear to be deeply etched into the hearts of these two maids and their reflex actions kicked in when they saw their Young Master's unhappy expression.\"Thank you, Young Master.\" Two girls got up from the ground, with fear still lingering in their hearts.Sima You Yue no longer bothered about the two of them as her left hand clutched her stomach, while her right hand held up a pair of chopsticks as she tried to pick a dish that looked palatable as she scoured the food placed before her. However after ten minutes, she gave up as she helplessly put the pair of chopsticks back down as she called out: \"Give me two fruits instead.\"After eating the two fruits,Sima You Yue rolled on the bed and started to mutter grudgingly as she felt her empty stomach: \"I still need proper food\u2026\"\"Tsk tsk\u2026You have always been so picky about food, you're already in the divine ranks and can survive even without food.\" A gentle doting voice suddenly rang out in her mind, as if transcending time and s.p.a.ce, a familiar memory flashed by.\"Whose voice is this? Is this another memory of this body's?\" Sima You Yue thought to herself, however she could not shake of a nagging feeling that it was not, this body was that of a trash, how could it be divine ranked? Who did this voice belong to? And who was it talking to?When dinner was still challenging to swallow, Sima You Yue could not take it any longer as she went into the kitchen herself and stirfried two simple dishes.This was the first time since she has eaten so full since arriving in this new world.As she drifted off to sleep at night, she had the same dream as the night before, with a shrill voice screaming out the same words: \"Sima You Yue\u2026 DIE!!!\"She could recognize that this voice belonged to her past life.\"Ximen You Yue. Please die for me. Only when you are dead then I will be the one and only acclaimed genius in this whole world! Hahahahahahahaha\"Who was this? Why did she not have any impression at all?\"Go to h.e.l.l!\"The two voices resounded in her mind, overlapping each other as the voices grew louder and louder as the cackling and screams echoed and she jolted awake from her nightmare. Her whole body was drenched with sweat as her clothes clung on to her. Her confused eyes darted around as a trace of sadness and loss was reflected in them.\"Why is it these two names again\u2026?\" She whispered.This night, as the moon hung high in the sky, she could no longer sleep a wink. As long as she closed her eyes, the two names resounded in her mind.Sima You Yue, Ximen You Yue.She tried to scour through all her memories but there were only traces of Sima You Yue however it was a complete blank for Ximen You Yue. Whether it was the past life of her own or this body's there was not even a hint of such a name in either of them.As she tossed throughout the night, when she looked into the mirror the very next morning, she found a pair of puffy eyes resembling a panda staring back at her. While waiting for breakfast with her Grandfather and Brothers, she chatted a bit and cheered them up.\"Third Brother, Fourth Brother, why haven't you guys gone to the Academy? Big Brother, Second Brother, don't you need to head out today?\" Sima You Yue asked but before she could look at them properly, she got distracted as her eyes rested on the dishes on the table that the maids placed before her. They looked pretty much the same as yesterday's unpalatable breakfast. Her brows furrowed deeply as she grudgingly picked up her chopsticks and stared intently at the dishes before her.\"We were waiting for you, we had to make sure that you were alright first. We still have some time, it's still not too late to leave.\" Big Brother Sima You Qi replied.\"What happened to your eyes?\" Second Brother Sima You Ming stared intently at her dark undereye circles.\"Two huge mosquitoes in my room made my whole night restless.\" She replied bitterly.It was now summer, hence the appearance of mosquitoes were not a rare occurrence.She picked and nibbled on breakfast and put her chopsticks down midway.\"Why have you stopped eating?\" Sima Lie asked with deep concern.\"The food is horrible, and I have lost all my appet.i.te.\" Sima You Yue replied very matter-of-factly.\"Haven't you been eating like this all these while?\" Sima Lie asked in a befuddled tone as he looked at the breakfast before him and couldn't find any difference from what they usually had.\"Since You Yue doesn\u2019t want to eat anymore, clear the table.\" Sima Lie said aloud.The maids scurried over and cleared the table up quickly. The other brothers did not voice out any opinions as they didn't really need to rely much on food anymore. The only reason they were eating together was to spend time with Sima You Yue.\"Well then, we'll head over to the Academy now.\" Sima You Ran stood up as he prepared to leave.\"We'll also head out now.\" Sima You Qi chimed in.\"Go on, go ahead.\" Sima Lie waved his hands casually and after all the brothers left, it was just the two of them alone. Sima Lie asked: \"You Yue, what are your plans for today? What are you going to do?\"Her initial plan was to study more about this new world and she had wanted to go to the library to read and gather more information, however the quality of food here haunted her so much that she blurted out: \"I want to go to the kitchen and have a look. At the same time, I want to teach the chefs a thing or two about cooking!\"\"Teach\u2026 teach the chefs how to cook?!\" Sima Lie choked out, as he stared at her with wide eyes as he stood stunned in place.\"Yes. Oh, weren\u2019t you invited by the Emperor to the palace to discuss some things? Don't worry, I won't go out, I'll be good and stay home the whole day.\" She rea.s.sured him. She knew her Grandfather was afraid that if she went out on her own, she might get bullied again. Now that she had given him her word, he should be more a.s.sured.However, Sima Lie did not believe her entirely as she had done this countless times in the past, once he stepped out, she followed suit and went out on her own. But when he saw her head straight to the kitchen, he could only throw in more faith in her words and hope she would stay home as promised.Sima You Yue stayed in the kitchen the whole day and when Sima Lie returned from the palace, she called out excitedly: \"Grandfather, come quickly! Try out these new dishes they've prepared!\" She grabbed a pair of chopsticks and picked up the closest dish and fed it straight into Sima Lie's mouth.\"Mmmmmm!\" Sima Lie was surprised as he closed his eyes and slowly savoured the delicious food she just fed him. \"What dish is this? How is it so delicious?!\"\"This was what I've taught them today! How is it? Isn't it delicious?\" She asked with a sparkle in her eyes.\"Hahaha, really much better than before!\" Sima Lie beamed with pride.\"Of course, they spent the whole day practising to finally get to this point.\" She quipped. Although they failed to meet her requirements, this was still much better than what she had been eating the past few days.She even dragged Chun Jian and You Yue into the kitchen when she felt that they had a bit of talent in this area. In fact, the dish that she had just fed Sima Lie was cooked by You Yue.\"Very good, let them prepare more delicious food for you next time. See, you can do it if you put your mind to it! In future, you can spend more time teaching them more dishes.\" He tried to encourage her as she rarely had other interests. She only knew how to chase handsome men or create trouble.\"I know, don't worry.\" She answered softly. Suddenly, she thought of something and she immediately put down her chopsticks and sat up straight before she looked at Sima Lie warmly.\"Grandfather, I would like to go to our Book Pavilion to have a look at some books.\" The Book Pavilion was what they called the library in her previous world. She really had to get used to the different terms they used in this new world.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8: \u201cBook Pavilion\u201d\"You want to read?!\" Sima Lie shouted aloud and started coughing as he choked on the food afterwhich he stared at her with a bewildered expression. His huge reaction made the whole kitchen focus on their Young Master, their interest piqued as they craned their necks and threw curious glances over.In fact, one couldn\u2019t really blame them for their reactions as the other name Sima You Yue carried with it was trash and having only attended the Academy for two days, other than recognizing a few words, a book had never been seen in this Young Master's delicate hands, not to mention reading a whole book! A sudden mention of 'wanting to read a whole book' and 'going to the Book Pavilion' was shocking news indeed.\"Cough, cough.\" Sima Lie readjusted his mood and returned to his usual calm demeanor and said: \"Since you want to have a look, let\u2019s go have a look.\"As soon as he said it, he strode out of the kitchen in large steps as Sima You Yue quickly followed behind. They came before a large courtyard with three-storey building.It was a simple looking building built in the middle of a plain looking yard, no one would have guessed that this inconspicuous building would be the Book Pavilion .\"Here we are \u2013 the Book Pavilion.\" Sima Lie introduced as he flipped his hands and a large key suddenly appeared. After retrieving the key from his interspatial ring, he unlocked the door and gently pushed it open as the scent of musty books greeted them.This was the first time she had been here, although the book Pavilion was located in between her courtyard and the main entrance, the past Sima You Yue had never once ventured in here.\"Here, this key belongs to you.\" Sima You Yue casually flipped his hands once again and retrieved another key and handed it over to her.All the other four brothers each had a key to this place, however as she did not enjoy reading, this key was never pa.s.sed to her, for fear that she might lose it.Sima You Yue took the key and put it in her pocket. She could not cultivate and had no spiritual power hence she could not use the interspatial ring.\"Alright, go ahead and read whatever you want. Take your time, I\u2019ve still got some things that I have to do, I'll be in my study. If you need me, you know where to find me.\" Sima Lie turned to leave after granting her access.Sima You Yue nodded and only after she watched his fading back did she turn to take a good look at the interior.Although she knew that there were some problems with her current body, there were still some differences with the herbs and materials from her world and this, at least she hoped that they were merely name differences. She needed to know more about the differences in the properties as well and study these more thoroughly to be able to cure herself and rid of this 'trash' label herself.Sima You Yue gaped in wonder as she looked at the interior of the Book Pavilion, who would have thought that the exterior which looked like any other common building but the interior was unexpectedly different! What attracted her attention most was that right in the middle of the Book Pavilion, there was actually a grand spiral staircase, which connected all four storeys, and each level had books that were placed in shelves that reached the ceiling. Such grandeur and splendour!Moreover, the scale was totally different! From the outside it did not look as big as what she was currently looking at. Surprisingly, the size of the first floor was as large as that of a soccer field. Although each level got smaller, however the size of the top floor was still bigger than a basketball court!\u201cOh wow, what sorcery is this?! This is simply too mysterious!\u201d Sima You Yue cried out in shock as she tried to compose herself. This had outrightly defied her logic and common sense that she was used to. Ever since she's been in this world, everything had left her agape. Things that she had 'seen' from her memories were still foreign to her and it felt as if she was watching everything from a television and experiencing it herself still roused the adventurous spirit within her as her eyes sparkled with excitement. She was particularly fascinated by the vast disparity of scale and grandiose.After she had finally regained her composure, she grew anxious. \u201cWith so many books, where should I even start looking? If I had known earlier, I should have asked Grandfather.\u201d She sighed with regret as she looked on helplessly at the grand collection of books before her.She started exploring the books on the shelves and after looking for a while, she discovered that the books were arranged according to different categories. If this row of books in this shelf was in one category, that following ten rows were in the similar category.\u201cHaha, found it!\u201d She cried out in relief. After scouring for an entire two hours, she had finally found the category she had came here for! She earnestly started to look for the books she needed as she carefully combed the shelves that housed the medical related books.She looked for quite some time until she found a book about the various herbs and materials for medicine and discovered that this whole shelf had the same genre of books.Her stomach rumbled and she touched her belly as she groaned in defeat. She quickly pulled out several books and hugged them carefully and left the Book Pavilion, locking the door securely as she left.By this time, day had already turned to night and it was completely dark outside. When Sima You Yue returned to her own courtyard, Yun Yue and Chun Jian noticed that in the arms of their Young Master were a pile of books. They hurried forward to a.s.sist, and asked: \u201cYoung Master, would you like to have dinner now?\u201d\u201cYes, I'm famished. Bring the meal directly into my room. Also, Yun Yue please pa.s.s the message to my Grandfather that for the next two days, I will be dining in my own room and will not be joining the family for meals.\u201dSima You Yue rubbed her belly before returning to her room.Chun Jian immediately went into the kitchen to prepare dinner for Sima You Yue, while Yun Yue brought the pile of books and placed them on the table before pa.s.sing the message to Sima Lie.Sima You Yue picked up a book and started reading, the books that she had selected this time round were all very general and were introductions to the basics of herbs and materials that were common in this world. It was a good start to help her identify the various herbs and materials and let her have a grasp of the differences of the two worlds. In her previous world, her intelligence quotient was higher compared with ordinary people, therefore whatever she studied took only a fraction of time. In addition, she originally majored in the study of Traditional Chinese Medicine so she was very familiar with the various herbs and properties. Moreover, she was just looking for the differences in these aspects hence her reading speed was exceptionally fast.By the time dinner was prepared, she had already flipped through more than half of the first book. When Chun Jian came in with dinner saw that her Young Master was browsing the book in such a flippant manner, she could not help but shook her head. It was evident her Young Master was not reading it properly!\u201cYoung Master, your dinner is ready.\u201d Chun Jian placed the meal gently on the table.Sima You Yue immediately put the book down, and her gaze rested on the dishes placed on the table. Seeing that the steaming hot dishes that were visually enticing was a stark contrast with meals before, she smacked her lips and gave a satisfied nod, and said: \u201cThis is what I call a meal!\u201dShe guzzled her dinner down heartily and as soon as she was done, she called for the two maids to clear the table and she continued to read into the night.After she read finish the first book, she discovered that here, the ordinary materials for medicine were similar to her previous world, but some had some minute discrepancies. For example, the name was different, or some had similar properties, but there were also some unfamiliar names that she came across.However she discovered that this set of books that she had brought back was from the same shelve and it was further segregated into the similar materials and properties. Realizing this, she quickly looked up according to each particular material and herb and studied them carefully.\u201cLuckily I went through these books first! Almost half of the names are different from before..\u201dSima You Yue stretched her body lazily and stifled a yawn as she looked at the prescription she had written down before realizing that dawn was soon approaching.Because she did not manage to get a good sleep last night, and she worked hard throughout this entire night, after she relaxed, her felt her eyelids were extremely heavy. She crawled to bed and as soon as her head touched the pillow, and she fell into a deep slumber.Tonight, she did not have a single dream, and by the time she woke up, it was already noon. When she opened her eyes, she looked around groggily as her eyes focused on the ancient pattern of the mosquito net. For a moment there, she thought that she was dreaming.\u201cRumble -\u201dThe hungry belly started to protest, making her consciousness slowly return, as memories flashed in her mind reminding her where she was. She put a hand and touched her forehead, and muttered: \u201cSo this is not a dream.\u201dShe finally rolled out of bed, washed up and changed. Chun Jian quickly prepared lunch and brought it into the room. After lunch, she took the prescription that she had painstakingly written down last night and walked towards Sima Lie's study.When Sima Lie saw Sima You Yue, he was somewhat surprised. Wasn't it only last night that she said that the next two days she would be busy reading in her own room? Why was she out so soon? She couldn't sit still for just two days? Or\u2026did anything happen?\u201cGrandfather, I have a matter to ask you.\u201d She straightened her back and looked at him earnestly.\"What is the matter?\u201d When Sima Lie saw Sima You Yue's serious appearance, he waved his hands and signaled for the bodyguards to exit.Sima You Yue pulled a chair and sat down across from his desk and said: \u201cGrandfather, do you know why can\u2019t I cultivate?\u201dCan\u2019t wait for your next dose?

When your Father carried you back, he mentioned that your Mother was injured, and that might potentially affect the fetus. That might have been the reason as it might have affected the development of your meridians. Why? What\u2019s the matter? Why did you bring it up again? \u201cSima Lie cast her a strange look.\u201cGrandfather, I suspect the real reason behind my blocked meridians is not because of a congenital cause, but for another reason\u2026 \u201cSima You Yue said cautiously.\u201cAre you saying\u2013\u201d Sima Lie's eyes went wide with shock as he looked at her.Sima You Yue nodded, saying: \u201cI have been poisoned, and it is the cause of my blocked meridians. After a.n.a.lyzing further, the reason I can\u2019t cultivate\u2026 and this matter is certainly related. \"\u201cBang -\u201d Sima Lie stood up suddenly, this abrupt movement toppled the chair that he was sitting on.\u201cIs\u2026 Is what you say true? \u201cSima Lie looked at his delicate granddaughter and asked.Sima You Yue nodded, and pressed on: \u201cI\u2019m sure, Grandfather, this poison is rare and not easy to detect. And this poison has been in my body for a long time, seemingly it looks like I was poisoned at the time of my birth. \"\u201cThe Emperor has sent quite a few people to check your condition several times before, what more they even comprised of renowned Doctors and Alchemists, they could only determine that your meridians are blocked and did not detect any trace of poison! \u201d Sima Lie said.Sima You Yue knows that the Emperor of Dong Chen Kingdom, Xing Zhantian, had been very fond of Sima Lie, he had certainly sent the best of the kingdom over, so if even they could not detect the poison within, it showed how rare that poison was in this world.\u201cMaybe the poison is very rare in our kingdom, furthermore there's no other symptoms other than the blocked meridians. If I had not touched the two small points under my arms, I wouldn't have found it out too. So it's normal that no one else could detect.\u201d Sima You Yue said.\u201cWhen your Father brought you back, he said that your mother was injured so so he felt that your development may be affected, but I did not expect that your blocked meridians was due to poisoning! \u201d Sima Lie sighed with regret..\u201cGrandfather, wasn't I born at home? What did you mean by 'when your Father brought you back'? \u201cSima You Yue felt that Sima Lie was behaving a little odd as she tilted her head in query and asked.\u201cCough,when you were born, your parents were not in Dong Lin City, and your Father only brought you back when you were around 6 months old. He said that he had to go look for your Mother and left you in our care, and has never returned. \u201d Sima Lie said wistfully. \u201cYue er, how did you discover that you were poisoned? Who diagnosed it? Tell Grandfather, I\u2019m want to look for that person and get the antidote for you. \"Sima You Yue shook her head and said: \u201cGrandfather, don\u2019t worry, no one else examined me, I found it out myself. \"\u201cYou found out yourself? \u201cSima Lie gave her an incredulous look of disbelief as he looked at Sima You Yue, saying: \u201d Don\u2019t lie to your Grandfather, what can\u2019t you tell Grandfather? Did that person make you say that it's a secret? \"\u201cThis-\u201d Sima You Yue remembered that the previous Sima You Yue was completely useless and did not harbour much intellectual knowledge, if she were to suddenly say that it was really her, Sima Lie would definitely not believe. So she took out the prescription and said \u201cGrandfather, here\u2019s the prescription for my cure, allow some people to get these herbs and materials written down, remember to do it with utmost secrecy!\"\u201cWell, Grandfather knows what to do.\u201d Sima Lie nodded, and he reached out and took the prescription from her to have a good look. Although the words were a bit ugly, but considering her illiteracy from before, Sima Lie nodded with satisfaction as he called out: \"Come, follow this prescription and bring the medicine back!\"\u201cYes, General.\u201d Two bodyguards came in and they carefully took the prescription and headed out to perform the a.s.signed task.After settling this task, Sima You Yue leisurely walked back. After returning to her yard, she locked herself in her room and continued to read. She was going to have to spend more time to look through these books, as she had to study these more intensively and in-depth to gain a better understanding.Soon, the prescribed herbs were sent over to Sima You Yue. She took those herbs and checked them thoroughly, only after determining that they didn\u2019t have any problem did she get Yun Yue to prepare the medicine. She had even given out specific instructions on its preparation method. After having them prepared the bath, and ensuring that they had all left did she slowly step into the red medicinal water.\"Hiss-' Once she had completely immersed her body in the medicated bath water, she felt her whole body burn up as if on fire, as an intense pain a.s.saulted her whole body.\"d.a.m.n it! Didn't think it'll hurt so much\" Sima You Yue cursed out loud as she writhed about in pain, her whole body felt as if there were flames lit on it and burning every inch of her body that was soaked in the medicated bath.The medicinal bath soon came into effect as she felt another surge of energy fuse together, further intensifying the heat and she felt as if her body may explode any moment. The red medicated bath water soon turned clear and her head felt foggy for a moment when suddenly she felt a sweet sensation well up in her throat. Before she knew it, she vomited out a mouthful of black blood and continued vomiting out more black blood on the floor. After she could no longer spit anything out, she finally felt better and regained some clarity.\"It's a lot smaller now.\" Sima You Yue muttered after touching the two little dots under her arm. \"It seems like it's going to take a few more sessions to completely clear this poison.\" She sighed and gritted her teeth, thinking back on the pain she had to go through.As soon as she came out of the bath and dressed herself, she kicked the huge wooden barrel and the whole barrel tilted slightly as a huge amount of bath water gushed onto the floor, was.h.i.+ng the black blood away.\"Young Master, is everything alright?\" Yun Yue and Chun Jian asked from outside with a slight quivering voice.\"Oh, I was a bit careless and accidentally spilt the bath, can you come in and help me clean it up?' Sima You Yue replied lazily.The two maids quickly scuttled in and saw that some of the water in the bath had spilt onto the floor. They hurriedly brought in dry cloths and cleaned the whole floor and removed the wooden barrel soon after.The next few days, aside from having her meals with Sima Lie, Sima You Yue spent her time burying herself in the books. She had almost completely finished reading the books she had brought out from the Books Pavilion the last time.In the blink of an eye, seven days pa.s.sed and this was her last medicinal bath.Sima You Yue immersed herself in the red bathwater once again and after a quarter of an hour pa.s.sed by, this time, the blood that she vomited out was no longer black but it had familiar vibrant crimson shade. She quickly touched under her arm and found that the 2 small dots were gone!She took her own pulse and confirmed that the poison had been completely removed from her body! Although she did not know if she could start cultivation after removing the poison, she still could not conceal her happiness as she felt a wave of exhilaration and excitement.After she used the same method to wash the blood away like previous days, she grabbed the huge key and walked briskly towards the Book Pavilion. This time, the books she wanted to look for would be those on cultivation methods!She wanted to ascertain if she could embark on her cultivation path once the poison had been completely flushed from her system!Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 10: \u201cFascinating New World\u201dThis time round, she was no longer wandering about the Book Pavilion like a lost sheep. The last time when she came in, she had written down the various locations of the different categories of books in detail. With such preparation in hand, she simply waltzed over to the bookshelf in search of what she wanted and soon staring at her, was a book with the t.i.tle: \"Professions Guide\".Thinking back, she had an impression of this book as this was the book that was given to the previous Sima You Yue on the first day she had attended the Academy. Unfortunately, she wasn't interested in it and had just casually tossed it at a corner of the table, and she had not touched it since.Sima You Yue leaned against the bookshelf as she quickly read through the contents of the book. However the more she read, the more she could not hide her surprise as she sighed in amazement \u2013 she was really living in a fantasy world!According to the book, people can cultivate because there is Spiritual Qi in the air and by absorbing the Spirit Qi, the body would, in turn, transform this Spiritual Qi into Spiritual Energy and the more Spiritual Energy one has, the stronger one is.In tandem with the difference in their powers, Spirit Masters are categorized into various grades, the grades in sequence are namely: Spirit Warrior, Spirit Lord, Great Spirit Master, Spirit King, Spirit Overlord, Spirit Saint and Spirit Paragon with the corresponding colours red, orange, yellow, green and blue, blue and purple. Each grade is further divided into 9 minor grades, with every minor grade depicted by a small star, and a moon depicted one major rank. For example, a sixth grade Spirit Warrior when drawing out his Spirit Energy, six little stars would show by his feet while for a sixth grade Spirit Lord, it would show a moon and six little stars, and for a Grand Spirit Master, it would show two moons, and so on.Although Spirit Masters held dominance over the world, they were nevertheless few in numbers as not every single person was able to sense and detect the spiritual powers in the air. As Spirit Masters held great powers, they were greatly revered and enjoyed high status in the world.Besides Spirit Masters, there were other highly regarded professions. In opposing relativity, would be the Sword Master. A Sword Master would refer to all those who were unable to sense the spiritual powers in the air and they rely solely on developing the force they infuse into their swords, named as Sword's Aura. Besides developing their swordsmans.h.i.+p, Sword Masters put in a lot of training into their physical strength as well, as the stronger their bodies get, the more force they would be able to sustain and bear up under with their swords.Each grade is further divided into 9 minor grades, with every minor grade depicted by a small star, and a moon depicted one major rank. For example, a sixth grade Spirit Warrior when drawing out his Spirit Energy, six little stars would show by his feet while for a sixth grade Spirit Lord, it would show a moon and six little stars, and for a Grand Spirit Master, it would show two moons, and so on.The different grades for Sword Masters were namely: Swordsman, Sword Meister, Grand Sword Master, Sword King, Sword Overlord, Sword Saint and Sword Paragon. The Sword's Aura was also categorised by seven colours: red, orange, yellow, green and blue, blue and purple, and every grade was similarly split further into minor grades from 1 to 9. One minor grade was corresponded by a tiny sword while a major grade was depicted by a sabre.Although Spirit Masters and Swordmasters are rare in the world, compared to other occupations, their numbers were considered to be rather numerous, as in the other occupations, they were even fewer in numbers.These occupations would include Elixir Masters, Weaponsmith Masters, Beast Tamer Masters and Array Masters, and every profession had their own unique strengths.Spirit Masters were able to form a contract with a Spirit Beast and the Spirit Master and the Spirit Beast would merge and become one body. But as Spirit Beasts were wild and savage in nature, a Spirit Master who forms a direct contract with a Spirit Beast would be harmed by the Spirit Beast, hence, that was how the need for a Beast Tamer Master came about.Beast Tamer Masters used their abilities at taming to remove and eradicate the savagery in Spirit Beasts, to enable Spirit Masters to safely form a contract with these Spirit Beasts. As the Spirit Beast after being contracted would lend the Spirit Master a strong boost in power, so Beast Tamer Masters were seen as highly important people. But to become a Beast Tamer Master, one must also first become a Spirit Master.Besides that, Weaponsmith Masters and Array Masters were also a branch of Spirit Masters, and that fact made Sima You Yue rather speechless.\"Sigh, seems like I better start training.\" Sima You Yue got up from the floor and after searching through the bookshelves for awhile, she finally found an entry level book covering the most basic of training and cultivation. She looked up into the sky and saw that it was getting late. She brought the book back to her room and after dinner, she locked herself in and sat up in bed to read. She followed what was written in the book and attempted to sense the Spiritual Qi in the air through meditation.Initially, she did not feel a single thing. But after some time, she seemed to have felt something unidentifiable swirling around her. It was not until dawn broke that she was finally able to properly sense those things as multi coloured specks of light,Sima You Yue opened her eyes and broke her meditative trance, feeling rather puzzled in her mind. [Didn't the book say that they came in only one colour? Why had she felt that they were in a mult.i.tude of colours?]\"That's strange!\"She did not understand why the specks of light she had sensed came in a variety of colours. The book had specifically mentioned that people were normally able to sense only one singular colour of lights. Did she use the wrong method to do it?She read the book from the beginning all over again and found that she had done it exactly as what the book had said and she had not gotten any step wrong. So where exactly was the problem?She pondered upon it for a while and finally decided to go ask Sima Lie. Sima Lie had already attained the highly acclaimed Spirit Saint grade and he must know the answer to her dilemma.She found Sima Lie and Sima You Yue threw out her query.\"That is actually very simple.\" Sima Lie said, looking at the upraised tiny face of his granddaughter who came to him with a question. He continued with a smile and said: \"The Spiritual Qi would differ in colour according to their different attributes or properties.\"\"Properties?\"\"Yes, my dear. The properties shows the type of Spiritual Qi one can train and cultivate in. Red is the colour for Fire attributes and when training, they absorb the red coloured specks of light. green is for Wood attributes and while training, they absorb the green specks of light. Similarly, Water attributes would be blue, while Metal attributes would be gold. Earth attributes would be brown, Light attributes would be white and Darkness attributes would be black. Usually, the colour of light that one is able to sense and detect would mean the type of powers that person would be able to train and cultivate.\"\"So that's how it works.\" Sima You Yue nodded her head to show she understood. When she recalled the multi coloured lights she had seen that morning, she continued to ask: \"What if I sensed a variety of colours in the lights?\"Sima Lie did not know why Sima You Yue was suddenly so interested in these matters about training and cultivation but he still replied patiently. \"When one can sense many colours of lights, that would be someone we term as Multifaceted Spirit Masters.\"\"Multifaceted Spirit Masters.\"\"Mmm. For example, if one can sense both red and gold coloured specks of light, they would be Fire and Metal, a Dual Faceted Spirit Master. If they can sense three types, they would be Tri faceted Spirit Master. But Multifaceted Spirit Masters are very rarely seen. And if they are found, they were usually be highly revered.\"\"What if all the colours were seen?\" Sima You Yue asked innocently as she looked earnestly at Sima Lie, asking him excitedly.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

That\u2019s the most elusive Perfect Prism!\" Sima Lie spoke out, his eyes revealing a trace of longing.\" But it\u2019s been hundreds and thousands of years that someone with this attribute has been seen. If such a person appears, I wonder what type of storm would it set off? Oh yeah, Yue Er, why are you asking me this today?\"Sima Yue heard his words and wanted to tell him that she had the very Perfect Prism that he had just spoken of! But she had decided to hold it in until she could cultivate properly and give him an even bigger surprise then.\"Yue Er, unless\u2026 Can you sense the Spiritual Qi in the air?\" Sima Lie asked her as his face lit up with hope.\"Yes.\" She laughed when she saw his reaction, this Grandfather of hers was really too adorable.\"Are you telling me the truth? Can you really sense the Spiritual Qi in the air?\" He asked and he felt overwhelmed with emotions as he hugged her tightly.She nodded her head and affirmed: \"Yes, the poison in my body has just been completely cleared and my meridians are no longer blocked. I've just embarked on my cultivation journey last night and only this morning, I was able to grasp a faint sense of Spiritual Qi.\"\"What?\" Sima Lie froze momentarily, as he cast her a strange glance.Sima You Yue was worried by the change in his expression.She picked up her courage and asked: \"Grandfather, is that not Spiritual Qi that I've sensed? Could it be that I've got it wrong?\"\"Ha ha ha ha ha!\" Sima Lie gave a hearty laughter as he chortled on. \"I knew our Yue Er was not a tras.h.!.+ Yue Er's a genius! Not just any genius, a genius amongst geniuses!\"Sima You Yue could not help but let out a cold sweat when she saw his face was flushed red with excitement. Although he did not answer her directly, from his reaction she knew the reply.Sima Lie finally calmed down as he looked at her gently and said: \"Yue Er, for one to sense the Spiritual Qi in just one night has never been heard of. What you've just accomplished was a huge feat! Your Grandfather was also called a genius, however, I took four to five days to be able to comprehend a faint Spiritual Qi when I first started out. The average person takes about half a month and yet some are still unable to comprehend it. Out of your few brothers, the shortest duration he took was still a week! Ha ha ha! Not only can you cultivate, your level of comprehension is absurdly high!\"Sima You Yue was stunned when she heard his words, she had initially thought that taking a whole night to sense the Spiritual Qi was considered a long time. However, to her surprise, it was the complete opposite and it was exceptionally short!What a relief, she had some talent after all, she wouldn't need to waste a lot of time then!\"Yue Er, what colour do you see?\" Sima Lie asked, his curiosity peaked, wanting to understand more on her situation.Sima You Yue wanted to have sufficient strength before she divulged her talent, lest someone gets jealous like her past life. And as Sima Lie mentioned earlier, someone with such attributes had not been seen in the past hundred thousand years, if her attribute was known to all, it may bring about a disaster for her family.\"Grandfather, I can only sense the red Spiritual Qi.\" She replied softly. Sima Low and her other brothers all were of the Fire attribute hence it wasn\u2019t too strange if she had the same as them.\"Well, every member in our family are of the fire attribute, it seems you too.\" Sima Lie nodded happily as he added: \"Tonight, be sure to call all your brothers out, let us celebrate! we'll let everyone now that you can cultivate. Hmph, after tonight let\u2019s see who still dares to call you tras.h.!.+\"Grandfather, I think it\u2019s better that we still keep this between ourselves for now.\" Sima You Yue persuaded.\"Hmm..Why should we? I know that although you don\u2019t say it out, you are still concerned about other people\u2019s views! I know that you used to hide in the yard and secretly cry, that\u2019s why when you said you didn\u2019t want to go to the Academy, I didn\u2019t force you.\" He asked with a confused expression.\"I\u2019ve been living for fourteen years and I\u2019ve not been able to cultivate. If we were to declare that I could suddenly cultivate, wouldn\u2019t that lead to a lot of unnecessary trouble? Everyone would prattling away and there would be people who would keep disturbing me to verify this fact, wouldn\u2019t it save all the trouble to just keep it under wraps for now?\"Sima Lie furrowed his brows, and said: \"But you are concerned with what other people think and you are my Granddaughter, why should you have to shoulder all of this on your own?\"\"It\u2019s true that I used to be very upset that I couldn\u2019t cultivate, however it was based on the fact that I really wasn\u2019t able to cultivate rather than what other people were saying about me. Now that I can cultivate, I do not care about what others say. Besides, whether if I can cultivate or not is also my own matter, others do not have the right to interfere. If others were to know that I can cultivate and in turn increase the strength of our family, I\u2019m afraid that might bring about unwanted trouble too. Don\u2019t you have lots of enemies? Especially the Nalan family, they\u2019ve always been opposing us. If they were to find out about my talent, they might brew some extra trouble.\" Sima You Yue coaxed.Sima Lie looked at her with warm eyes, ever since she was heavily wounded the last time, she seemed to have really changed. No longer was she wayward, she had became more sensible and thoughtful.\"Well, what you\u2019ve just said made sense.\" He gruffed. \"We'll leave the matter for now but you'll still have to call all your brothers out tonight, we'll just celebrate it on our own.\" He reluctantly said, trying to change his tone to a more cheerful one to restore the mood.\"Alright, I shall go back and cultivate first! I'll meet for dinner when all my brothers come back tonight.\" She quickly chimed and turned to leave.\"Wait a minute.\" Sima Lie stopped her in her tracks.\"What is the matter, Grandfather?\" She queried.\"Come with me for a moment.\" He said as he turned and led her to the corner of his study and his hand touched a tile on the wall. He pressed firmly on it and there was a click sound and next to the bookshelf a small hole appeared. He reached in and pulled something and soon a small entranceway appeared beside them with a ladder leading down. He flicked his wrist and a light pearl appeared in his palm as he turned to her and nodded.\"Let\u2019s go.\" He said.Sima You Yue followed him closely, her interest piqued as she curiously walked behind him, as he led her down the into the secret room as they walked through a long narrow corridor and only after a while had they finally came to a stop.\"We're here.\"He said gently and led her into a small stone room. She looked around and found that other than a small stone table in the centre which had a small box on it, there was nothing else.He walked towards the box and wistfully said: \"This was what your Father left for you before he left to find your Mother. He said that if you were ever able to cultivate, then I should pa.s.s this box to you. I hereby pa.s.s this to you now.\" He let out a small sigh as he looked at her.Sima You Yue felt that something was odd but couldn\u2019t pinpoint what as she listened to her Grandfather's words. His eyes were filled with emotions as he pa.s.sed her the box. She took the box and was about to open it when he stopped her.\"Go back and open it when you are alone.\" He was very insistent and she could only helplessly comply and nodded in response.\"Well, let's go back now.\" He said as he led her back the way they came from.Once she left his study, she briskly walked back to her room as she rushed past everyone in sight. Back in her own room, she sat on her bed as she looked intently at the box in her hands.Thinking back on what Sima Lie had said earlier, he had mentioned that her two maids You Yue and Chun Jian were both people whom she could trust. Although it was Sima Lie that made them swear the oath, they had both sworn oaths to never betray her. Sima Lie had ensured that they had sworn their allegiance to her. The contents of the contract had bonded them despite it being Sima Lie who had did it. The power of oath in this world had magic imbued in it. It was a contract sworn to heaven and earth. If the person were to ever break their oath, they would be forced into h.e.l.l, never be able to leave!So no matter how she treated them, they could never betray her. This however was not known to the former Sima You Yue. Due to her feisty temper, Sima Lie and kept it from her then.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

She felt a myriad of mixed emotions stir within her as she looked at it, half of her wanted to satisfy her curiosity and quickly open it while another part of her had her reserves of opening it, fearing that if she opened it, somehow she'd be on a path to no return.\"Well, since it's something that cheap Father who had left it behind, I might as well have a look in it.\" She convinced herself as she broke open the seal and lifted the lid.Inside the box, lay a simple ring, a piece of leather parchment and a dark stone. She picked up the leather parchment and took a look. There was a map that was drawn on it, and a house was deliberately marked out. Other than that, she could not find anything else that had a clue to what this place was. She wanted to put the map back in its original position but noticed that there was an envelope there.\"What is this?\"Written on the envelope were the words: 'To my Daughter.'She then picked it up and unsealed it, and out slipped a piece of paper. Her expression became serious as she read it.The letter was not very long , it simply stated that the ring left behind for her was an ancient artifact and was a prized family heirloom. It was in fact, a rare interspatial ring. Other than that, not much other information on the ring was written. She found it peculiar that if this was really a family heirloom, why would Sima Lie be oblivious to this? Also, she had a feeling that there was more to her family situation.She placed the ring back, currently she still has yet to cultivate enough to ama.s.s sufficient Spiritual Qi to harness the power of a Spiritual Master. The current her still could not make the ring hers as a drop of blood was needed to form the bond and that too, required Spiritual energy. Her fingers deftly glossed over the map as her eyes studied the various lines and landmarks drawn on it. Her Father had also mentioned that this map was very important and she should never ever divulge to anyone else that she possessed it.This leather parchment looked a little worn, seems like it had quite a bit of story and history behind it. She did not possess any knowledge to provide her any clues to where this map was for. There was no other information written on the paper as well.\"So he left me a dilapidated map, this cheap Father of mine, the least he could have done was to tell me where the map was for! Or else what use of it is it to me if I'm so clueless?!\" She shook her head and sighed in resignation, not knowing why that man had to make everything so mysterious, rendering her completely helpless.Finally, she picked up the final item in the box, the dark piece of stone and carefully placed it on her palm as she brought it closer and studied it intently. After a while, she sighed in exasperation as she tried to figure out how was this small stone an 'ancient artifact' as the letter had claimed it was.\"It's just a very black stone, hmm, a little smooth and rounded more like a pebble\u2026 looks a little like obsidian, are you sure it's really an ancient artifact?\" She raised an eyebrow in query, her eyes full of doubt as she continued muttering to herself: \"That cheap Father had also wrote that this stone chooses its Master, perhaps we're not meant to be and we have no fate so I can't see what's so special about you?\"Sima You Yue finally placed the small stone back into the box after fiddling with it a while longer as she closed the lid and started to earnestly cultivate. As long as she could become a Spirit Master, she would be able to bind the s.p.a.ce ring and make it hers by putting a drop of her blood on it. At that time, she would be able to see what was stored inside. A huge part of her was very curious on the items that man had left behind for her.She gently touched the illusion ring on her finger as she softly cursed in her heart, why was the interspatial ring so troublesome! Why could she only bind it after she has attained the level of a Spirit Master? If only it was convenient like this illusion ring without so many c.u.mbersome conditions, how nice would that be!This time round, when she was cultivating, she did not absorb all the Spiritual Qi, instead, she spent the whole day trying to sense the various attributes. This time, she carefully observed the various colours and realised that within so many colours, she could sense that here were more of some colours and less of some. She could also sense that those different little light orbs seem to be able to sense her as well and were attracted to her and flying all around her, seemingly wanting to be absorbed into her body.Soon it was time for dinner and Sima You Yue stopped meditating as she got ready for dinner, those brothers of hers should most probably be back by now.\"Young Master, Fourth Young Master came and is waiting for you.\" Yun Yue gently informed Sima You Yue from outside the door.\"Alright, I've got it, let him know I'll be out soon.\" She replied as she got down from her bed.\"Yes, Young Master.\" Yun Yue respectfully bowed and retreated.Sima You Yue quickly stuffed the box under her pillow and left. In her hurry, she did not notice that there was a faint glow emitted from within the box.\"Fourth Brother, why have you come?\" Sima You Yue walked over the the table that Sima You Le was drinking tea at.\"Oh, I'm here to call you for dinner.\" He gave her a wide smile.\"You could have just asked a servant to pa.s.s the message, why did you have to make this trip yourself? Since you've come all the way here just to pick me up, we should go over now.\"He followed her as they walked over to the dining hall. He hesitated a moment before he opened his mouth and said: \"I've something else to tell you too.\"\"What is it?\" She turned her head and asked.\"Teacher Mu has given an ultimatum, he said that if you do not appear in the Academy tomorrow, the princ.i.p.al will dismiss you from the Academy. Even if the King pleads on your behalf, you won't be able to attend.\" Sima You Le said.\"Teacher Mu? Who is Teacher Mu?\" Sima You Yue blinked and asked him sincerely with a puzzled expression.Seeing her reaction, Sima You Le bitterly smiled and patted her head. \"Your cla.s.s teacher. Teacher Mu.\"Sima You Yue furrowed her brows as she struggled to think. She seemed to have a small recollection, this Teacher Mu was her teacher in charge of her cla.s.s, other than teaching, he controlled a lot of other things in school.\"If you do not want to go, I'll let Teacher Mu know on your behalf.\" He paused. \"It's just that you won't be able to attend the Academy anymore.\"\"No need, I'll just go to the Academy with you tomorrow.\" She shook her head and said.Before, she had no interest in the Academy as she could not cultivate but now that she was able to, going to the Academy would let her be more exposed to the various teachings and methods, although it was a little too soon, it did not pose a big problem.During the dinner, Sima You Yue expressed her interest in attending the Academy to Sima Lie. He also had the same thoughts as her. Since she could cultivate now, going to the Academy would be a good choice.It was at this point that her other four brothers knew that she could cultivate and they congratulated her one by one, letting her feel the warmth of a family as they were each exhilarated and genuinely happy for her.After dinner, Sima Yue went back to her room and continued meditating, however this time, she did not only simply observe the various little light orbs, she also tried to absorb them.At first, with her guidance, she experienced some resistance, however after a few tries, the first orb was absorbed in, as she seamlessly guided it along her meridians and into her abdomen. After the first one was successfully absorbed, the second light orb followed by the third and everything after was just as easily absorbed.While she was cultivating this time, there was a spectrum of lights s.h.i.+ning out from the box which she had placed below her pillow earlier today. When the various coloured lights shone out, more little orbs of light gathered around her as she quickly absorbed them.Late into the night, she had to stop cultivating as she had to attend the Academy tomorrow. Once she stopped her meditation, the light from the box disappeared completely and not a trace of that beautiful spectacle could be seen.Can't wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 13: \"Returning to the Academy\"Early the next morning, Sima You Yue climbed onto the beast carriage that would bring her to the academy. This carriage was similar to those carriages in her past life, except that the ones pulling it were not horses but were Spirit Beasts.Sima Lie had arranged a wolf carriage for Sima You Yue and standing before the carriage, were four majestic and magnificent Storm Wolves, every single one of them a fifth low-ranked beast.Low-ranked spirit beasts, sought by many as a contract beast, however, it was used to pull a carriage for Sima You Yue instead. This had garnered a lot of attention as people could only smile wryly at this luxury.\"Fourth Brother, where\u2019s Third Brother?\" She could not help but ask as she looked around the ma.s.sive carriage and saw that it was only the two of them that were seated in this s.p.a.cious and comfortable carriage.\"Oh, he went out earlier to meet with his cla.s.smates to do a mission today, so he had left earlier before dawn.\" He casually replied.\"Went out on a mission?\" Sima You Yue asked in a surprised tone as she look wide eyed at her Brother, imploring him to explain further.Sima You Le closed the book that he was reading as he looked up and patiently explained. \"The Academy is not only a place for studying theory, it\u2019s also a place to gain some experience. The Academy occasionally arranges some missions for students to accomplish. They have various missions catered to different levels and these missions are usually not too difficult. This time, he's gone out for a field Mission so it would take him some time to complete it. I don\u2019t think he will be back anytime soon.\"\"That explains it\u2026\" Sima You Yue nodded with a satisfied expression, it seems life at the Academy won\u2019t be so boring after all!\"I forgot to tell you last night that the Academy is holding their entrance selection for two days and it just started yesterday, so if you are interested you can go and have a look. I\u2019ll be busy the entire morning as I\u2019ve a prior engagement with my Master so I\u2019m afraid that I do not have the time to accompany you. If you want to go and have a look, can you wait till after lunch? I can meet you then and we can have a look together.\" Sima You Le said.\"Don\u2019t worry so much, no need to trouble you, if you are busy don\u2019t let me hold you up. If I\u2019m interested, I can just head over on my own.\" She shook her head and and refused.She knew that her Brother was concerned about her and was worried that she\u2019d be bored or someone may find trouble with her. But she could not rely on him all the time, at such an age, she was already old enough to be independent, moreover the soul was more mature than the body.\"Yue Er has really grown up!\" Sima You Le could not help but looked at her warmly as he smiled in appreciation.Cold sweat.Sima You Le's comment made her speechless, he was only three years older and yet the way he spoke was as if he was much older than her! She quickly cast her gaze outside the window to cover the awkwardness she felt. Outside, the street was hustling and bustling with activity, as Sima You Le had mentioned earlier, it was time for the selection for the Academy hence the capital was particularly lively this time of the year.The wolf carriage brought them directly to the front gates of the Academy and Sima You Le brought her to her cla.s.sroom and repeatedly nagged and fussed to make sure she had no problems before leaving.The moment she entered the cla.s.sroom, the was a moment of silence. The appearance of Sima You Yue made everyone stare in shock, seconds later, jeerings were heard as whistles and boos were thrown in the mix.\"Why is the trash in our cla.s.sroom?\"\"Haha, maybe he\u2019s here to check out the freshman! I\u2019ve heard that this year\u2019s selection have quite a few handsome men!\"Another voice cried out in exaggeration.Boisterous laughter filled the cla.s.sroom as more voices chimed in.\"I\u2019ve heard that he had hara.s.sed Murong An to the point that his followers almost killed him!\"\"No wonder he\u2019s been missing for so long, he was actually recuperating at home!\"\"He should just kill himself! A useless trash that shames the entire family! Such a Grandfather is wasted on him.\"\"\u2026\u2026\u2026..\"Sima You Yue was calmly listening to all the insults thrown at her, as she silently swore in her heart, whoever spat those words at her, she would pay them back with interest. She made her way to an empty seat at the last row and turned to look out the window, completely ignoring those ignorant fools.Thinking back, one couldn\u2019t blame the previous Sima You Yue for her actions. Since she could not cultivate, she had naturally lost all interest in learning. She had no interest in studying as she could not cultivate. She liked handsome guys \u2013 she was after all a young girl, this was also understandable. However her obsession was a little excessive. However, looking at her prominent background, she didn\u2019t misuse her ident.i.ty and bullied others, unlike some other rich n.o.bles who went around with their servants in tow whose past times were based around oppressing the poor and the weak.Everyone around Sima You Yue continued their discussions until they saw that he had no response, the chatter slowly died out as the topics began to hover about the new freshmen in the selection trials.However some gossip mongers couldn\u2019t keep their mouths shut and continued digging out stories and the topic soon steered to how a complete trash could actually enter the Academy, making Sima You Yue the first trash that could actually enter its prestigious gates.Along the beautiful lake, there were pavilions built along it and there was a group of youths discussing the matter on Sima You Yue appearance at the Academy.\"Murong, don\u2019t tell me that trash is actually stalking you?\" One of the youths asked Murong An who was the centre of attention.Murong An indeed had a das.h.i.+ng appearance, if put into modern context, he would be a movie star that ranked amongst the top. Hearing what that youth said, Murong An couldn\u2019t help but furrowed his brows.\"Yes, I think that it may be true, perhaps that waste couldn\u2019t take it anymore and followed you to the Academy!\"The girl sitting beside Murong An was the very same one who had watched together with Murong An while Sima You Yue was being thrashed and beaten. When she heard that Sima You Yue was coming back to the academy, she could not help herself but ask: \"Murong, what would you do if she continues to stick to you?\"Murong An clasped the girl\u2019s hand in his and said: \"Don\u2019t worry, I will not give him the opportunity to do that.\"Sima You Yue had just been sitting in the cla.s.sroom for a little while when she was summoned into Master Mu's office. When she entered, she saw Master Mu sipping tea with a rather young, scholarly and elegant man. Dressed in a white long robe, that man gave people the feeling of being unapproachable and was a no nonsense kind of person.Seeing her come in, Master Mu's eyes almost dripped with disgust but his face very quickly changed into one full of smiles as he said: \"Sima You Yue, this gentleman here is the teacher for the new first years, Feng Zhi Xing.\"Sima You Yue offered a greeting to Feng Zhi Xing. \"Master Feng.\"Feng Zhi Xing turned to look at Sima You Yue, and there was not a single trace of disgust or displeasure on his face as he said: \"You are Sima You Yue? Make sure you study diligently or Master will still punish you as well.\"Sima You Yue was getting rather confused by Feng Zhi Xing's words and she looked in puzzlement at Feng Zhi Xing and Master Mu.\"Cough cough\u2026.. It's like this. As you have never attended cla.s.ses before, we considered the fact that you might not be able to keep up with the other students in your cla.s.ses and I went to speak with the Headmaster about it. It so happens today is the selections for new students and I thought you should go learn together with the freshmen. That might be better for you. So, from now onwards, you will be Master Feng's student.\" Master Mu explained.Sima You Yue looked at Master Mu's deeply concerned face, and although he was trying his best to hide it, she could still detect that suppressed glint of joy in his eyes.With a student who was the epitome of worthlessness in his cla.s.s, Master Mu had always been utterly ashamed of that embarra.s.sing fact. Now that he was finally able to be rid of her, his heart could not help but sing with joy. No one would understand just how disgraceful it was to have a completely worthless and utterly useless student like her! And only the Heavens knew from where the Headmaster managed to dig up a teacher that would accept a student like that!Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

I know your grandfather is a respected general of our country, but you will still have to stay here. You can go out in the day, but you must be back in the dormitory by bedtime. Only when we are not out on a mission, you can then go back home and sleep once a week.\" Feng Zhi Xing explained.Although she did not fully understand the rationale behind it, but Sima You Yue obediently complied.\"Alright, you can go back now. Move your belongings into the academy tomorrow and we'll officially begin our cla.s.ses the day after.\" Feng Zhi Xing continued.Sima You Yue bowed and took her leave after that. Since she had no more cla.s.ses, she thought to make good use of her time to go catch up on her training. But before leaving, she thought she should at least inform Sima You Le, but she was stopped before she could even reach the cla.s.srooms of the seniors.\"Sima You Yue! Stay right there!\"Sima You Yue raised her head and stared at the person standing before her, blocking her way forward. He was from the same bunch of people who had thrashed her up the other day. She remembered this one person among the many people who had beaten her up at that time, he had been the most vicious one! Seeing him once more, she could almost visualise the scene when the previous owner of the body had been beaten to death by them. Her eyes darkened and she said in a chilling tone: \"Get out of my way.\"The person standing in her way was Nalan Qi from the topmost family in the Capital City. The Nalan Family was one of the mightier Houses in the Feng Ming Kingdom and their ancestors were almost reaching the level of the revered Spirit Paragon and hence, they did not think much of the Sima Family. Afterall, in the Sima family, only Sima Lie was powerful, and only he alone. While the Nalan Family had a whole bunch of powerful individuals!The confrontation between Nalan Qi and Sima You Yue quickly attracted many people to crowd around them. Although they feared offending Sima You Yue, their curiosity for the show unfolding before them won out and they all were thinking they would not get into any trouble if they just watched from the side.When Nalan Qi saw that so many people had crowded around them, he said with a taunting laugh: \"Sima You Yue, are you going to look for Murong An again? Are you still going to bother him like this? Haven't you learnt your lesson from the thras.h.i.+ng we gave you? How could you be so shameless? As a man, why are you sticking to Murong An so persistently! ? You're so outrageously shameless!\"Nalan Qi's words elicited a roar of laughter to erupt from the surrounding crowd. Their eyes were all on Sima You Yue, and the mockery in their eyes were plainly obvious to see.Sima You Yue stared at Nalan Qi, her eyes seething with anger.Nalan Qi was not intimidated by Sima You Yue's angry glare. He got people to bring him a bench and he put one foot onto it and said: \"If you want to pa.s.s, I will allow it. Here, crawl yourself through under here and I will not stop you.\"As he spoke, he pointed at the s.p.a.ce under his raised leg.Sima You Yue continued to glare at Nalan Qi and did not say a word, but just stood in her spot, unmoving. If it was the previous owner of this body here now, she would have immediately flown into a rage.\"Why? Not going to crawl? You don't want to or do you not dare to do it? If you are so gutless, that will also mean your so called General Sima is just as spineless as you are! Ha ha ha ha ha\u2026..!\"Nalan Qi looked at Sima You Yue, fully intent on ridiculing him. Never in his wildest dreams would he have foreseen what unfolded next. He had not expected that Sima You Yue would suddenly charge towards him and swiftly grabbed his robes and held him down. Next, Sima You Yue quickly gave a huge kick into Nalan Qi's groin, and a shrill scream tore out of his throat before he fell over onto the ground, curling up tightly into a ball.Not a single person there had expected that Sima You Yue would suddenly retaliate. No one had seen how Sima You Yue had come to suddenly appear right before Nalan Qi. By the time they were able to react, Nalan Qi was already writhing on the ground.It was thought that Sima You Yue would stop at that, but Sima You Yue jabbed a knee onto Nalan Qi's back as Sima You Yue knelt, and with a grab, Sima You Yue twisted Nalan Qi's right arm behind before giving it a sharp tug. A loud crack could be heard and a scream suddenly tore through the entire academy grounds.\"Your little Lord here has no time to play with you today. Do not appear before my eyes ever again, or I will beat you to a pulp every time I see you!\" Sima You Yue stood up calmly as she got up from Nalan Qi's back. She gave him another two sharp kicks before he slowly turned and left.Everyone was utterly shocked and they were all dumbfounded for a long while. Was that the same Sima You Yue who was well known to be timid and weak, and perceived as nothing but just a l.u.s.ty and infatuated moron?The news about the ruckus that had happened before the seniors' cla.s.srooms spread quickly throughout the entire academy. Not a single one of the students could believe what they heard. If the ones who brought them the news had not sworn and pledged upon a myriad variety of G.o.ds and deities on the authenticity of the news, no one would have believed a word of it.In a tower not too far away, two men were observing the commotion and one of them was the very same man whom Sima You Yue had met just earlier, Feng Zhi Xing.\"That is one ferocious little one there!\" Feng Zhi Xing said with a big smile when he saw Sima You Yue's moves. But he could not help but to cringe when he remembered where that first kick had landed!\"What made you agree to let him join your cla.s.s?\" The man beside Feng Zhi Xing asked him.\"Just intuition.\" Feng Zhi Xing replied. \"See, didn't he just show you that he is nothing like what the rumours said about him? The speed that he moved at earlier when he attacked. Whew\u2026.. I am really curious about him. Adding to the fact when he saw me earlier, he had not displayed any signs of infatuation or the sleazy l.u.s.t that those rumours mentioned.\"\"It's up to you. Since I managed to get you to come, I'll leave all these issues in your hands to handle.\" The man said.\"Headmaster, do you really trust me that much? Aren't you afraid I'll lead those students astray?\" Feng Zhi Xing asked, looking meaningfully at the other man.\"What is there to be afraid of? Don't I know you well enough?\" The Headmaster walked away from the window and sat back into his seat. He had just been discussing some things with Feng Zhi Xing earlier when he was dragged to go to the window to witness Sima You Yue beating someone up.\"Ha ha, if you're not afraid, then I have nothing to fear. I'll leave now and go see which are the unfortunate students that will be ending up in my hands.\" Feng Zhi Xing said.\"Your cla.s.s consists of a bunch of the most gifted kids we have among the entire batch. Take it easy on them.\"\"Alright, I'll try to. I will make sure they have an unforgettable time here!\" Feng Zhi Xing immediately left the Headmaster's office after saying those words.Before the cla.s.srooms, Sima You Yue went to look for Sima You Le after giving Nalan Qi the two kicks. And before she reached the cla.s.srooms, she suddenly saw Sima You Le rush out from his cla.s.s and he didn't even see Sima You Yue whom he had just pa.s.sed.\"Fourth Brother, where are you rus.h.i.+ng to?\" Sima You Yue quickly reached out and grabbed her brother by the arm to ask.\"Little Yue, what are you doing here?\" When Sima You Le asked in shock when he saw Sima You Yue there.\"I came here to find you.\" Sima You Yue answered with a smile. \"You were running so fast, where are you going?\"\"I heard you got into an altercation with Nalan Qi up front, and it even escalated into a fight. I was running over there to see if you were hurt.\" Sima You Le said.Sima You Yue was beaming happily as she replied: \"Fourth Brother, rest a.s.sured. I am not hurt. I gave Nalan Qi a good thras.h.i.+ng.\"\"Really?\"\"Of course! I'm right here before you, aren't I?\" Sima You Yue said.\"That's good to hear.\" Sima You Le finally heaved a sigh of relief and then went on to ask: \"What did you come here for anyway?\"\"Oh, I came here to tell you something.\" Sima You Yue told her brother about her being demoted a grade and that she would also be boarding at the Academy. Then, she continued to say: \"I intend to go back and inform Grandfather about it, and I will move into the dorms tomorrow.\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Come, let me send you back.\"\"There\u2019s no need! I\u2019m not a child anymore, I can go back on my own. Bye!\" Sima You Yue waved her hand awkwardly and quickly turned to leave.Sima You Le watched the departing back of Sima You Yue as he let out a small sigh. He felt that ever since the last tras.h.i.+ng, this little Brother of his has really become more sensible. Moreover, now he could cultivate, he may catch up to him very soon! If he wanted to continue to be able to protect him, he has to work harder! A flash of determination could be seen in his eyes as he turned and walked back to his own cla.s.sroom.Sima You Yue wasn\u2019t very familiar with the Academy as she followed the main path and directions of the signs and found herself standing before the majestic main gate once again. When she saw that the entrance was full of people, she thought back on how this was the second day of selections.\"The next one, Ouyang Fei.\" The examiner shouted out towards the group in front of him.At this time, within the group, a young man came to the front and followed the examiner's instructions and put his hand on the crystal ball. Sima You Yue watched with interest and saw that when Ouyang Fei had poured his Spiritual Energy into it, the crystal ball emitted a red and green glow.\"My\u2026my G.o.d! He actually has dual attributes! This time, our Academy has a Double Faceted Spirit Master! Great! Hahaha!\" The examiner was ecstatic when he saw the reaction of the crystal ball. He couldn\u2019t help but laughed out loud and bellowed to the person beside him: \"Go tell the headmaster that we've discovered a Double Faceted Spirit Master!\"Soon, as if summoned by the wind, a man swiftly arrived and from the memories, Sima You Yue recognized him as the Headmaster of the Academy.\"Where is our new student who is also a double facet Spirit Master?\" He asked as soon as he arrived and he saw the examiner pointing excitedly to Ouyang Fei. The director flashed a large smile and walked up to Ouyang Fei and greeted him. He then guided him into the Academy.Sima You Yue could not help but sneer. This director really was quite a character! When he saw that she was trash, he had on a sour face and now when there was a genius presented before him, he blossomed into a smile that made her irk.The examiner soon called for the next person and she watched on and soon found that the selection consisted only of this one round which was a crystal ball test. Upon injecting their Spiritual Energy into the crystal ball, they would be able to see their attributes. The deeper the colour, the higher the talent. If the crystal ball reacted like how it did to Ouyang Fei just now, it was an incredible reaction that garnered respect from everyone.She also gathered from everyone around her was that in this selection, there were no other Double Faceted Spirit Masters.After awhile, she no longer felt any novelty in this and turned to leave when she heard gasps and loud exclamations from behind her.\"My G.o.d! There\u2019s actually a Tri Faceted spirit Master!\"\"It\u2019s really three colours!\"\"We, we actually got to witness this moment!\"This time there was a huge outburst from the crowd. The people started shouting out loud exclamations in shock and disbelief. There hasn\u2019t been a Tri Faceted Spirit Master in the Academy for hundreds of years, what\u2019s more, just before this, a Dual Faceted Spirit Master was discovered.The examiner was panting in excitement. This year, they\u2019ve just discovered a Dual Faceted Spirit Master and moments after, a Tr Faceted Spirit Master?! He could not help but pinch himself to determine if he was dreaming or not.Sima You Yue turned and saw a lone figure that was not affected by this all these bustle and excitement. Instead, she stood beside the crystal ball and watched the people around her who were excited for her. She looked as if she was watching a spectacle and as if the matter had nothing to do with her at all. She was very detached, she stood there expressionlessly, nothing could be seen on her face, no pride, no amus.e.m.e.nt \u2013 no joy. Sima You Yue could see that she harboured endless loneliness, and also found a trace of hatred that was hidden well within.She felt Sima You Yue staring at her and she turned to look, expecting to see the same crazed fervour as the rest. Instead she saw a pair of calm and clear eyes looking back at her.They stood far apart but their gazes locked and they were at this for a full half minute until the girl retracted her gaze and turned to look at the examiner and asked: \"Excuse me, I\u2019ve already pa.s.sed, can I go in now?\"\"Of course, of course! However your's is a special case so you don\u2019t need to go in like the rest, wait here and another examiner will come and guide you in. We have a special arrangement for you!\" The examiner quickly answered.\"Alright.\" That person gave a superfluous answer and turned to look at Sima You Yue again, however she found that he had already left, leaving only the back view.Sima You Yue returned to her home and had intended to look for Sima Lie immediately. However, she was told that he was in the palace at the moment so she could only return to her own room and continue reading and cultivating.Last night she felt that there was progress in her cultivation and she believed that she was just a few steps away from becoming a full fledged Spirit Master. At that time, she would finally be able to bind that ring that her Father had left behind. After all, having an interspatial ring was much more convenient.She had warned Yun Yue and Chun Jian not to disturb her under any circ.u.mstances and had also locked the door from within, ensuring that no one would interrupt her during this crucial period.She sat down in meditation as she concentrated on sensing the surrounding Spiritual Qi. It was now much easier to sense the surrounding Spiritual Qi than before.The book that she had read earlier was a book that she had casually picked out which coincided with what she was looking for as it was a basic guide to cultivating for Spirit Masters.Sima You Yue concentrated on the red orbs of light and slowly guided them into her body and gathered them in her lower abdomen. The multi array of various coloured orbs were all dancing around her, however, only the red ones could enter her body.At the same time, the box emitted a glow from within and a.s.sisted in her cultivation.When Sima Lie returned home and heard that Sima You Yue was looking for him, he went over to her courtyard. However, when he arrived, he could feel the fluctuations in the surroundings and knew that she was cultivating at the moment and he called Yun Yue over to ensure that no one disturbed Sima You Yue and he left her courtyard and went back.It's really true! She can cultivate!Sima Lie felt exhilarated as he walked towards his courtyard, unable to suppress the smile on his face.Sima You Yue was furiously cultivating and this time round, it was only after two days later that she woke up.She felt refreshed and as if her whole body was rejuvenated and a warm stream was flowing within her, a gentle energy was circulating throughout her whole body with her meridians.Her eyes snapped open and she felt as if her whole body was enveloped in a warm glow, she looked around and saw a small star was sparkling.\"I\u2019m finally a Spirit Master! Hahaha, I\u2019m at the initial stage of a Spirit Warrior but nevertheless, this proves that this body isn\u2019t tras.h.!.+ Right after removing the poison, I can already cultivate..hmm? What\u2019s this?\"The box was unlike previous times that once she stopped cultivating, the light dispersed. This time, resplendent rays of various coloured lights poured out of the box. She couldn\u2019t help but reach out to the box in her stupor.Once she picked up the box, the lights all disappeared, even the soft glow that enveloped it dissipated.She curiously opened the box but found nothing out of the ordinary. Only the same three items that were in it before.\"There\u2019s nothing strange in here, what could be the one that caused those lights to appear?\" She muttered out loud in puzzlement.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

She poured in Spiritual Energy to inspect them separately and still could not find anything special. She then put the stone down and used a small knife and p.r.i.c.ked her finger as she let the blood drip onto the interspatial ring. She stared at it intently, watching in marvel as her crimson blood seemed to have disappeared into the ring although she had witnessed it touching the ring. She felt a sense of closeness and realized that her link with the ring had been established. Just as she was curious and focused her thoughts on the interior of the ring, she felt as if her consciousness was sucked away into a different s.p.a.ce.\"I\u2019m inside the ring?\" Sima You Yue couldn\u2019t help but stare wide eyed as she took in her surroundings. She was surprised to find herself standing in a s.p.a.ce the size of a room as she excitedly said out loud: \"From now on, going out will be so much more convenient! I can store everything in here!\"Her consciousness swept the entire room in its entirety and she had a grasp of how it worked. As she retracted her consciousness, she heard a voice in her head cry out.\"Hahahahahahah! This little Master has finally awoken!\"Sima You Yue was startled as she subconsciously asked: \"Who is it?\"\"Huh?\" The other voice paused for a while and there was silence. Suddenly, the voice exclaimed: \"You actually don\u2019t remember me?!\"Sima You Yue scanned her surroundings and saw nothing, where did the voice come from?\"Sniff sniff, I can\u2019t believe you actually forgot about this Little Master.\" The voice whimpered out indignantly.\"Who are you?\"\"I am Little Roar! You really can\u2019t remember me?\" A voice filled with grievance echoed in her head which further confused her.\"Monkey? Haha, You are a monkey?\" She asked out loud.(*TL: Little Roar's name in chinese is Hou and it can also mean monkey. It sounds similar, only when reading it, would you be able to see the difference)\"You are the monkey! You were the one who named me!\" Little Roar cried out.While Sima You Yue was still in her stupor, a figure came out from her body and floated in front of her.\"Hmm, you're not a monkey but a rabbit!\" Sima You Yue looked at it from head to toe and after affirming it, she nodded contentedly.Rabbit? How am I a rabbit?! I am Hou! The Ancient Sacred Beast Hou!\" Little Roar yelled at her in exasperation.Sima You Yue touched her own noise in embarra.s.sment and asked: \"Sacred Beast Hou?\u2026Little Roar?\"\"You\u2019ve finally remembered me?\" Little Roar asked.\"Not really.\" She seriously answered.\"Then how did you know that I\u2019m called Little Roar?\" It asked earnestly.\"Didn\u2019t you just say it yourself\u2026?\" Sima You Yue carefully answered\u2026as she looked at this creature once again. This creature's IQ was way lower than a human's.\"Oh, did I?\"Sweat\u2014\"How are you in my body? Also, just now you mentioned that you've finally awoken. What do you mean by that?\" Sima You Yue who was speechless at the way the little rabbit appeared could not help but ask.\"I have a contract with you, so where else would I be other than in your body?\" Little Hou asked.\"Contract?\"\"That's right! We are bound with a Spiritual Contract and although you then died, your spirit was still around and I followed you here.\" Little Roar replied.\"Why then did you not appear till now?\" Sima You Yue continued to ask.\"Didn't I just tell you? I was in a deep sleep!\" Little Roar explained: \"You were hurt, and the injuries spread to me as well and I was recuperating in my sleep. I did not expect you to have forgotten me when I woke up\u2026.. Wah~\"Little was so sad he started sobbing and the tears dripped onto Sima You Yue, as an invigorating sensation of relaxation came over her.\"Your tears are amazing.\" Sima You Yue exclaimed.\"I am a Charm Beast, of course you will feel good.\" Little Roar retorted.\"Really!\" Sima You Yue stared at Little Roar intrigued and said: \"You mentioned you got hurt earlier, how did that happen? And, how did we come to be bound in a contract? I don't remember having ever seen you!\"\"Wah~ Wah~ Yue Yue! You are so detestable! I don't like you anymore! How could you ever forget your adorable Little Roar? Luckily I entered into a Spiritual Contract with you earlier or I would never have been able to find you! Wah~ Wah~ But now, Yue Yue has completely forgotten about Little Roar altogether!\" Little Roar wept sadly.Seeing Little Roar in such a state made Sima You Yue suddenly overcome with a sad feeling in her heart as well, seemingly having been affected by Little Roar's emotions. She carried Little Roar into her arms, gently stroking at its fur and said: \"I'm sorry, I really can't remember. But I can feel the link between us. When you are sad, I feel it in my heart as well.\"Little Roar stretched out a short front paw and rubbed it over its face and said: \"Maybe your spirit was damaged and it has caused you to forget your previous life? I will go take a look.\"Upon finis.h.i.+ng the sentence, Little Roar suddenly vanished from within Sima You Yue's arms and quickly reappeared. But its face was looking rather concerned as it stared at Sima You Yue to say: \"Your memories have completely disappeared. No wonder you do not remember me.\"\"Memories? What memories?\" Sima You Yue raised Little Roar up before her eyes and asked.\"It wouldn't help even if I told you. You will have to find those memories back on your own.\" Little Roar replied.\"Recently, I have been feeling that I am missing some memories as well. Sometimes my mind feels a little empty, feeling like I am forgetting something very important. But if it was that important, why do I not remember a thing about it?\" Sima You Yue released Little Roar and put both her hands on her head, as her face twisted up in frustration.\"Yue Yue, don't get so frustrated. That will not help you get back your memories.\" Little Roar said.Sima You Yue turned to Little Roar and asked: \"Little Roar, you know of a way?\"Little scratched at its tiny head for awhile before it finally said: \"I think it must be due to your spirit having been damaged, that caused you to forget what happened in the past. As your spirit gradually restores itself, you should be able to remember them again.\"\"But how do you restore the spirit?\"\"Eat things that are beneficial to the spirit, and also cultivate. Once you reach a certain level, you will be able to restore your spirit.\" Little Roar replied.Suddenly, Little Roar saw the stone in the box. It cried out in surprise and pointed at the stone: \"That\u2026.. that is the Spirit Pearl?\"Sima You Yue saw Little Roar's agitated reaction and she asked: \"You know of this thing?\"\"Of course I know about it!\" Little Roar's eyes lit up as it flashed to come before the Spirit Pearl. It stretch out its two short paws and started caressing the pearl, its drool almost dripping out of its mouth.\"My cheapo father said this was a divine item handed down from far ancient times, and it will only acknowledge the destined one as its owner.\" Sima You Yue said.Little Roar was still caressing the Spirit Pearl as it nodded vehemently and said: \"Yes, yes. A pity no one knows what kind of use this pearl has. Yue Yue, come here quickly and see if it will acknowledge you as its owner! I heard that this is a magical item of the highest divinity and it will be great is you can gain its acceptance.\"\"Really?\" Sima You Yue looked at Little Roar skeptically.\"Really! Come, come, come. Come try!\" Little Roar carried the Spirit Pearl to come right before Sima You Yue and urged excitedly.\"Err\u2026..\" Sima You Yue hesitated, but when she saw Little Roar's earnest face and so filled with excitement, she took the Spirit Pearl and said: \"Alright, I'll give it a try.\"\"Yup, yup.\" Little Roar leapt up onto Sima You Yue's shoulder and said: \"Yue Yue, quick, quick.\"But Sima You Yue did not know what she must do to make the Spirit Pearl acknowledge her and just as she was thinking what kind of ritual she must carry out when Little Roar suddenly just came over and pulled apart the wound earlier inflicted on her finger and as there was not much blood, Little Roar pushed her finger directly on to the surface of the Spirit Pearl.At first, there was completely no reaction from the Spirit Pearl. The blood had not melded into the pearl yet. And just as she was about to give up, the blood was suddenly absorbed into the pearl and she had wanted to remove her finger thinking the process was finished when she found that she could not move it.Not only that, Sima You Yue felt as if her finger had been bitten and an excruciating pain suddenly poured into her as she felt her blood surge out of her through her finger. She was soon giddy from the sudden loss of blood and the next moment, the world turned suddenly black and she fell onto the bed.Before she lost consciousness, she heard Little Roar calling out to her worriedly and she cursed in her heart: \"You little con! You just killed me!\"*Can you see Little Roar on her shoulder?TL: \u5c0f\u543c (xi\u01ceo h\u01d2u) is Little Roar\u2019s chinese name. \u7334\u5b50(h\u00f3u zi) means monkey in chinese.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

All she felt was as if she had fallen into a deep, long slumber and she was in a dream realm. In that dream, there was a mirror which reflected her past life as she stood in the abyss of darkness. Scenes flashed before her, one after another and she stood there calmly, watching each fragmented scene, as if watching a movie. Suddenly, she felt a sharp pain in her heart, and she let out a bloodcurdling scream.\u201cYou Yue, today is the day of the downfall of our Ximen Family. They have been plotting against us for a long time, so you are not responsible for this matter. No one will blame you for this.\"\u201cXimen You Yue, seeing your loved ones dying before you, how does that feel? Ha ha ha ha \u2026 \u2026\u201d\u201cYou Yue, you have to live well \u2026 \u2026\u201d\u201cYue Yue, no matter where you go, Little Roar will follow you.\u201d\u201cXimen You Yue, Die!\u201dSima You Yue stood in the abyss of darkness as she struggled to listen to the exchange between the gentle voice and the voice laced with hatred as she gritted her teeth and bore through the pain. She felt as if her heart was slowly being torn apart. However, she tried her best to concentrate on the voices, she wanted to know who the voices belonged to, but in the end, no matter how hard she tried, she could not pry her eyes open, it was as though something was restricting her vision.\"Ahhh\u2014!\"Sima You Yue forcibly flung her eyes open, and the restriction that binded her eyes dispersed along with the dream. She was panting heavily, gasping for breath, her whole body was drenched, as if she had just doused with water.\"Yue Yue, you've finally woke up! Wuu Wuu\u2026 You've scared Little Roar to death!!!\" Sima You Yue was still groggy when Little Roar who was floating by her side suddenly dashed and nuzzled his way into her arms, crying and wailing loudly.Sima You Yue's thought snapped back to reality when she heard Little Roar's cries as she held him gently in an embrace as she touched his fur and coaxed, \"Do not cry, am I not fine already?\"\"Wuu wuu, it's all Little Roar's fault! If I had not made you try to bind the Spirit Pearl, this would not have happened at all.\" Little Roar sniffled and said in a self-deprecating tone.Sima You Yue hugged him tightly and planted a kiss on his forehead, as she soothed him in a gentle voice: \"Didn't you do it all for my sake? It was for my own good, wasn't it?\"Although the dream was very fragmented, however, the feelings she had for Little Roar seemed to have been cleared by a fog and she felt a whole lot closer to him. That feeling wasn't just a mere link based on a contract, it had a depth that was as if they had been together for a long, long time, a special kind of bond had formed between them.She stood up with Little Roar in her arms as she looked around, trying to figure out her where she was. She found herself standing in the midst of a strange new world \u2013 surrounding her were mountains, lakes, fields and a house. However, there were no signs of anyone else.\"Where is this?\" Sima You Yue couldn't help but ask in surprise as she observed her surroundings, realizing that they were nowhere near the Capital City that she had some knowledge of.\"Yue Yue, just now when you fainted, there was a bright light and it brought us here. I do not know where this is as well.\" Little Roar replied honestly.\"You are inside the Spirit Pearl.\" A childlike voice sounded out.\"Inside the Spirit Pearl? Who are you?\" Sima You Yue turned around and did not find a trace of anyone or any animals nearby.A small figure slowly took form and manifested before her. A small child looking around to be 3 year old, with two red buns on his head, wearing a red bib was looking at the person and Sacred Beast before him and said: \"I am the soul of the Spirit Pearl, and you are now in the world that exists in the Spirit Pearl itself.\"The world that exists in the Spirit Pearl.Looking at the befuddled expression of Sima You Yue and Little Roar, the soul nodded and continued: \"There is a world that exists within the Spirit Pearl, similar to your world on the outside. No, this world is much better than your world outside.\" He gave a proud smile as he corrected himself.Sima You Yue couldn't help but nod in agreement. It was indeed much better than the world outside! She could already feel that the Spiritual Qi in the environment was many times denser than the outside world. Even a novice like her who could feel the Spiritual Qi without meditating signified how many times the Spiritual Qi was! Also, not only the Spiritual Qi was denser, the ground was filled with many precious herbs.\"Where did these herbs come from?\" She couldn't help but ask as she stared at the myriad and vast quant.i.ty of precious herbs that were growing on the pastures that stretched beyond what she could see.\"These were all left behind by the former masters, and these herbs have been around for hundreds and thousands of years.\" Replied the boy with a sense of pride. \"All those that can't grow for too long have been regularly cleared by me.\"\"The former masters?\"\"Yes, it's been hundreds and thousands of years ago, too long that I don't even remember some things.\" The boy said wistfully as he had on a faraway look as he looked into the distance, deep loneliness reflected in his eyes.Not knowing if it was because of the bond they shared due to the contract, when Sima You Yue saw that he had on a lonely and forlorn expression, she walked up to him and held him up in her arms as she brought him closer to her face and looked at him in the eyes and softly said: \"Don't worry, we are here, with us around, you won't be alone anymore.\"The small boy was startled and he stiffened up when he heard that, however when she embraced him, he felt her warmth and he slowly relaxed and let out a small cry. \"Yeah.\"Sima You Yue patted his head as she carried him in her arms and walked towards the house and said: \"Let's go have a look around.\"\"Ok! Sounds good!\" Little Roar who was perched on Sima You Yue's shoulder exclaimed excitedly in antic.i.p.ation.Sima You Yue walked towards the house and went in to explore, discovering many things the previous masters left behind. There was also a study that housed a larger amount of books than the Book Pavilion back at the Sima Residence. It had a huge selection of rare ancient texts, many which have already been lost with time. The boy said that this collection of books had started from the first generation master and in this large collection, was the acc.u.mulation of various predecessors and the vicissitudes of time could clearly be reflected here.When she saw these books, she was ecstatic and excited for quite some time, ancient texts have always been known to be more powerful, however, many had been lost with time as knowledge slowly got lost in transition.What got her really psyched was what he mentioned at the end.\"Your soul is incomplete, you should have been gravely injured in the past. But don't worry, this Spirit Pearl has the ability to heal you and mend your soul, at the same time, it can also aid you in your cultivation.\"\"It can also aid me in my cultivation?\" Sima You Yue couldn't help but blurt out in excitement.\"Try sensing the Spiritual Energy in your abdomen\"She did as she was told and although she could not accurately control and visualise everything at her current level, she could still sense that the Spiritual Energy was no longer just a ma.s.s of sporadic red Spiritual Energy, there seemed to be the existence of a pool in there.\"At your current level, you still can't see it, but when you can, there's actually a small pool in there. That is what the Spirit Pearl has prepared for your cultivation, when you inhale the Spiritual Qi, it would attract all the Spiritual Qi and gather them there, using it's ability to sort the various attributes apart. Now, you won't be able to understand it very well, when you can see it, everything will be clear to you.\"She stared wide eyed at him and blanked out momentarily before coming to her senses. \"You mean that when I cultivate, I do not need to concentrate on which attribute to absorb but I can simply absorb them all and the Spirit Pearl would help me sort them out?\" She really could not believe her windfall, It was simply a game cheat!\"Yes.\" He calmly replied. Sima You Yue picked up up in a crazed fervour and smacked a large kiss on his cheek.\"Yucks! That's so disgusting! There's so much saliva!\" He wiped his cheeks with his hands, as he gave her a disgruntled look, however, he could not mask the suspicious blush that appeared on his face and ears. Amused, both Little Roar and Sima You Yue laughed out loud.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 18: \"Dormitory Mates\"Sima You Yue gave the boy the name 'Little Spirit' and after she gained some understanding of the Spirit Pearl and how to use it, she returned back to her own room.Upon returning, she remembered the Academy matters, as she quickly called her two maids in and found out that 4 days had pa.s.sed since then. When she heard that, she was startled and jumped up and quickly stuffed everything she needed into her interspatial ring and ran out.\"Yun Yue, just now\u2026 Young Master used an interspatial ring, didn't he?\" Chun Jian asked in disbelief.Yun Yue who was equally stunned nodded back in a daze, \"It seems like it.\"\"Then, you mean that our Young Master can now cultivate?\"\"Yes\u2026and before he left he still told us to cultivate properly.\"They both looked at each other in confusion. \"That person, was that really our Young Master?\"\"He\u2026should be\u2026\"Sima You Yue had quickly dropped by and informed Sima Lie about her lodging in the Academy and then she headed back to the Academy in the beast carriage. Thinking on how many days she was late for school, she was worried that Feng Zhi Xing would not let her in.Imperial Academy, the first years of the elite cla.s.s were all having their lessons and when Feng Zhi Xing came into the cla.s.sroom and saw the empty seat at the back of the cla.s.s, a glint came into his eyes, as he looked at the rest of the cla.s.s and said: \"It's been two days since you all started attending our Academy, by now you should have a grasp and better understanding of how things work in here. Also, those that are in this cla.s.s are all who harness Spirit Energy so I will not repeat all the basic stuff to you, now we will learn how to absorb Spiritual Qi into our body faster\u2026\"At the end of the day, the first years each returned to their own yard.These students were all who had topped the selections this year and were all the top talents, the cream of the crop, many who had attained the level of Spirit Warriors much earlier.As the elite cla.s.s, their treatment received was not the same. For example, other regular students were living together in a big dormitory, while they had the privilege of staying in a cl.u.s.ter of five rooms to a courtyard, and each of them enjoyed the luxury of having a single room all to themselves. Although the courtyard was not large, but the facilities were not lacking. It was fully equipped with a kitchen, bathroom as well as a garden.Standing before the entrance, Bei Gong Tang was about to open the door but found that it had been opened prior to this.\"Bei Gong Tang, how are you always so fast? After cla.s.ses end you always rush back, why don't you wait and walk back with everyone?\"Behind her was a voice that was filled with short gasps and a string of complaints, and Bei Gong Tang turned and saw that it was her roommate for 3 days, the Fatty Qu followed by the frosty Ouyang Fei and gentle Wei Zi Qi.Fatty Qu's name was called Qu Li, and because he was rather chubby all over, he had on the first day that everyone had met each other, he had self mockingly told everyone that they could all call him Fatty Qu.\"It wasn\u2019t you guys?\" Bei Gong Tang asked when she saw Fatty Qu and the other two with him, her face frowning slightly.\"What happened?\" Ouyang Fei keenly sensed that something was wrong and asked immediately.Bei Gong Tang turned his body slightly to show them the opened lock, and said: \"I didn\u2019t do it.\"\"Oh? Does that mean that another one of our dormitory mates has arrived?\" Wei Zi Qi took a step forward and pushed open the doors leading into the courtyard while saying: \"I\u2019m rather curious who it could be?\"As Wei Zi Qi stepped in, the others followed behind and went into the courtyard. As predicted, noise could be heard coming out from the second unit on the right.In the room, Sima You Yue was holding a rag in hand and wiping at the tables and chairs. Little Roar was lying on the table that had just been cleaned as its mouth poured out a string of endless grumbles: \"This place is so tiny! And they allocated only one to each individual. Compared to the place you stayed in before, this is a dump.\"\"It's not really that bad, downstairs as the s.p.a.ce for learning, upstairs houses my bedroom. It's great! Moreover, as long as it\u2019s a roof over our heads, it is good enough. Why would you want such a big place for?\" Sima You Yue asked, stretching her hand out to poke at Little Roar's tiny head.The houses here had two levels, and both levels belonged to the same unit.Little Roar rolled over and lay on its back on the table saying: \"Yue Yue, hurry up and regain your powers. Your spirit is incomplete and it has greatly reduced my powers too. The current me is just so weak!\"\"These things can\u2019t be rushed.\" Sima You Yue continued: \"Anyway, you\u2019re not that young anymore, waiting a few hundred years wouldn\u2019t make a difference to you anyway.\"\"Sigh, that's awful\u2026..\" Little Roar rolled its eyes.\"Oh yes, don\u2019t forget, do not reveal your ident.i.ty before anyone. You are just an ordinary little bunny. Alright?\" Sima You Yue reminded.\"Yes, yes, I remember. You\u2019ve said it many many times. Not to reveal my ident.i.ty. Don\u2019t worry, I will not give you any trouble!\" Little Roar said.\"Glad you know.\" Sima You Yue said, and proceeded to continue with the cleaning.\"Cough\u2026 cough\u2026\"Two coughs sounded from outside the door. Sima You Yue turned to look and saw four people standing there.\"Why is it you! ?\" Fatty Qu exclaimed in shock as he stared at Sima You Yue.\"You know our new dorm mate?\" Wei Zi Qi asked.\"Err\u2026.. Yes.\" Fatty Qu was starting hesitatingly at Sima You Yue, looking as if he was afraid that he would pounce on him any moment.Fatty Qu's family resided in the Capital City and when it came to people with widely known infamy such as Sima You Yue, he would naturally know them. He had heard the rumours about the Fifth Young Master of the General's Residence being not exactly a straight guy.\"You guys are my new dorm mates?\" Sima You Yue said, smiling at them. When she saw Fatty Qu's expression, his face fearful, Sima You Yue said: \"Fatty Qu! Why are you looking like you've seen a ghost? Don\u2019t worry, I have no interest in you!\"[Not interested? What did that mean?]\"Hi, my name is Wei Zi Qi, and I stay just in the next house to your left.\" Wei Zi Qi introduced himself, smiling at Sima You Yue.\"Ouyang Fei, first unit on the west side.\" Ouyang Fei said simply.\"Bei Gong Tang, to your right.\" Bei Gong Tang said.\"I know about you guys. In the new student selections, I saw it. Ouyang Fei is a Double Faceted Spirit Master and Bei Gong Tang, you are a Tri Faceted Spirit Master.\" Sima You Yue said.She had not thought that her dormitory mates would turn out to be the most gifted students among the new students, and why did Feng Zhi Xing put a useless piece of trash among these elites?\"I\u2026 I\u2026..\"\"It's alright. You are staying in the second house on the west side, you don\u2019t need to say it.\" Sima You Yue looked at Fatty Qu and he suddenly felt weak.\"We have all introduced ourselves but you have not said who you are.\" Wei Zi Qi pointed out.My name is Sima You Yue.\" Sima You Yue simply said in reply.\"You are Sima You Yue? Didn\u2019t they say Sima You Yue was\u2026..\" Wei Zi Qi stared at Sima You Yue aghast, unable to control the expression on his face for a brief moment.Even Ouyang Fei's expression was looking a little strange.\"Sima You Yue, the High General's fifth grandson, Dong Cheng nation's most useless piece of trash, inclined towards guys.\" Bei Gong Tang unreservedly repeated the rumour about Sima You Yue as she looked at Sima You Yue. \"We've met. Now I\u2019m going back to my room.\"Finis.h.i.+ng her statement, she immediately turned to go to the unit beside them.What an icy girl! She was very beautiful, and now she had became a cool and aloof beauty. When she thought back to having seen her withdrawn from all others, isolating herself during the selections, Sima You Yue could not help but feel that she was hiding a secret she did not want others to find out about herself.\"I'm going back too.\" Ouyang Fei left as well after saying.\"Cough cough. Then erm\u2026 We welcome our new dorm mate.\" Wei Zi Qi said, laughing awkwardly. \"The teacher taught us quite a bit of knowledge today, and I need to go back and revise. Bye!\"Sima You Yue looked at Wei Zi Qi's back as he fled in terror and she felt herself on the nose.Wei Zi Qi was just little more suave than others, did he really need to react so strongly? Was she really that terrifying?\"Cough cough, then, I will need to go back and catch up on cultivation.\" Fatty Qu said hurriedly, preparing to flee as well.\"Fatty Qu, you stand right there!\" Sima You Yue stretched out her hand and grabbed Fatty Qu by the collar and dragged him back.\"Wh\u2026 What do you want?\" When he saw the evil glint in Sima You Yue's eyes, Fatty Qu instinctively raised up his arms and crossed them protectively over his chest, his face in abject horror.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Do you know them well?\u201dFatty Qu shook his head and replied: \u201cBei Gong Tang is a person offew words and she likes being alone, other than her name, she has neverdivulged anything else about herself.\u201dSima You Yue touched her chin as she thought out loud: \u201cMmm..she hason that frosty expression, she doesn\u2019t seem to like to interact withothers.\u201d\u201cOuyang Fei as well, other than his name and that he is a doublefaceted Spirit Master, we don\u2019t know anything about his family, hisbackground or even where he\u2019s from.\u201d Fatty Qu continued sharing.\u201cd.a.m.n it. Why is everyone so mysterious!\u201d Sima You Yue couldn\u2019t helpbut exclaim out irritatedly. \u201cHow bout that last guy? Wei Zi Qi? Helooks amiable?\u201d\u201cFifth Young Master, although he is better looking, I\u2019d advise you tohave any designs against him.\u201d Fatty Qu quickly interjected when he sawthe expression on Sima You Yue.\u201cWhy?\u201d Sima You Yue asked in response, before the underlying meaningbecame clear to her, she smacked him hard on his shoulder and cried out:\u201cSince when did I even say that I have any designs on him?!!\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 your eyes were bright and sparkly when you spoke about him,almost the same expression when you look at Murong An.\u201d Fatty Quanswered as he cast her a contemptuous glance.\u201cCough cough, the past is the past. Now I\u2019m a changed man and I\u2019m nolonger interested in men.\u201d Sima You Yue couldn\u2019t help but cough slightlyin an embarra.s.sed manner. \u201cEnough of this talk, Now tell me, why shouldI not have any designs on Wei Zi Qi?\u201d\u201cBecause he has quite a powerful background. He comes from thelineage of the Beast Tamers. Wei is the largest Beast Tamer clan in theNorthern Forest City, and they hold a very prestigious status in BeiChen Kingdom. Even though your Grandfather is the General, he is stillnot in a position to directly confront such a powerful Beast Tamer Clan.It is said that Wei Zi Qi is the direct descendant of the most talentedBeast Tamer, so you can imagine the status he has in his family.\u201d FattyQu explained.\u201cOh, so he hails from the Beast Tamer Clan.\u201d She finally let go ofFatty Qu and sat down as she continued asking: \u201cWhat are his Spiritattributes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the rarely seen Ice attribute coupled with Wood.\u201d Fatty Qu said.\u201cIce attribute? I thought there were only Metal, Wood, Water, Fire,and Earth for the various Spirit attributes?\u201d Sima You Yue asked.\u201cThose are just the more common Spirit attributes.\u201d Fatty Qu knewwhat kind of a useless piece of trash Sima You Yue had been before andit was completely understandable that Sima You Yue did not understandit, so he explained it patiently. \u201cBeyond the basic five attributes,there are a few more rarer ones. Ice, Wind and Lightning attributes.However these are really very rare so not many people know about them.It\u2019s said that perhaps among ten thousand Spirit Masters, you may beable to find one or two with such rare attributes.\u201d\u201cThat rare?!\u201d Sima You Yue could not help but gape out loud.\u201cYes, and I\u2019ve also heard that their attacks are especially powerful.\u201d Fatty Qu replied enviously.\u201cWhy are you putting on such a disgusting expression?! Envious? Aslong as you work hard, you can also become as strong!\u201d Sima You Yuechided.\u201cHaha, true.\u201d Fatty Qu scratched the back of his head and looked down in embarra.s.sment.\u201cWell, now that I know more about the rest of them, now let\u2019s talk about you, what is your attribute?\u201d She asked him.\u201cOh, I have a double attribute of Fire and Earth.\u201d He replied.\u201cFire and Earth attributes? Wow, not bad boy, didn\u2019t know you had it in you.\u201d Sima You Yue looked at him and cheered him on.Fatty Qu wanted to roll his eyes, oh please, in the past you onlyknew how to chase Murong An, where in the world did he have the time tocare about a second character like him?\u201cHmm? I thought that multifaceted Spirit Masters were rare? How arethere so many just in this one dormitory?\u201d Sima You Yue asked curiously.\u201cYes, that\u2019s true, I\u2019ve heard that there were even years where not asingle multifacet Spirit Master, and yet this year alone, four suchpeople popped up, and even amongst us there\u2019s a tri faceted SpiritMaster. What\u2019s even more coincidental was that the four of us were inthe same group and were lined up consecutively. Ouyang Fei was the firstwho was tested, next was Bei Gong Tang, Wei Zi Qi was the third and Iwas the fourth. You should have seen that teacher\u2019s reaction then! Hewas shocked silly!\u201d Fatty Qu chortled on as he thought back on theselection day.He was surprised that chatting with Sima You Yue was actually quite fun!She had witnessed the selection of Ouyang Fei and Bei Gong Tang, andhad left right after Bei Gong Tang got selected. She hadn\u2019t expectedthat right behind would be Wei Zi Qi and Fatty Qu.At that time that teacher was drowned in ecstasy when he had testedOuyang Fei and Bei Gong Tang. Adding in the the two other geniusesbehind, she could more or less imagine his expression then.If he knew that she was a Perfect Prism, what would his expression be? Would he have died of a heart attack on the spot?\u201cBut Fifth Young Master, why are you in the elite cla.s.s?\u201d Fatty Qu could not help but ask.\u201cWhat elite cla.s.s?\u201d Sima You Yue asked back in query.\u201cThat\u2019s our cla.s.s! We had the best results on the selection day so we are all in the elite cla.s.s. Do you not know that?\u201d\u201cI have absolutely no idea, all I did was follow Feng Zhi Xing and he brought me here and gave me the keys.\u201dIs it because his Grandfather is the General? So he gets preferentialtreatment? Fatty Qu couldn\u2019t help but think in that direction.\u201cSince Master Feng gave you the keys means that you are a member ofour cla.s.s. But you\u2019ll have to be mentally prepared, the people in ourcla.s.s all have quite a bit of background, most of them are n.o.bles andcoupled with their talent, they are very arrogant, with your \u2026 prestigeand reputation, some people may not be able to take it and may come findtrouble for you.\u201d He warned seriously.\u201cHaha, thanks for the reminder.\u201d Sima You Yue smiled, did not think that this boy\u2019s heart was pretty good.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d When Fatty Qu heard the word \u201cthanks\u201d coming outfrom Sima You Yue\u2019s mouth, he was suddenly feeling that it was rathersurreal. In the past, they would have been utterly grateful if Sima YouYue had not tried to give them a hard time, they wouldn\u2019t have dareddreamed that they would be thanked at all. \u201cBut as your grandfather is adecorated General of the country, people would normally be afraid tosay anything against you, and you will only have to be a little morecareful of some who might have come from big distinguished families.\u201d\u201cMmm, I know it now.\u201d Sima You Yue nodded.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll go back and get back to my cultivation.\u201d Fatty Qu got up to say.\u201cGo, go. And thanks again for giving me so much information. When Igo back, I will get something delicious as a reward for you.\u201d Sima YouYue said, patting Fatty Qu on the shoulder.\u201cCough, cough. There\u2026.. is really no need for that. I will need to gonow.\u201d When Fatty Qu heard that Sima You Yue was even going to get himfood, he immediately turned tail and ran.It was widely rumoured, that the food the Fifth Young Master of theGeneral Residence prepared, was able to poison a hardy Spirit Beast todeath! He was still young and he did not want to die a martyr so soon.Little Roar peeked open its eyes and said: \u201cSee? Didn\u2019t I do a good job? I did not even say a word!\u201d\u201cNot bad, we\u2019ll do it this way from now on.\u201d Sima You Yue said, full of praise for Little Roar.Although Fatty Qu had said that he didn\u2019t need Sima You Yue toprepare him any food as a reward, it was very early the next morningthat he was drawn by a delicious and enticing scent wafting out from thekitchen. When he got to the kitchen, his eyes widened in disbelief whenhe saw the figure bustling busily inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She turned and saw Fatty Qu standing there in a daze and his mouth wide open.\"What happened?\"\"You..you\u2026really know how to cook?\" Fatty Qu said.\"Do you wanna try and see if it's poisoned?\" She retorted.Academy cla.s.ses start at nine in the morning, and she woke up at the break of dawn and cultivated for awhile before started preparing breakfast.She was very eminent on one thing, that was, she needed solid food \u2013 good food to tide through her days. In the past, unless she was out on field missions would she forsake eating and nibbled on snack bars, ration food or pills. This was deeply etched in her so she continued displaying her culinary skills here.While cooking, she had also thought about the others living in the same courtyard as her. They would be living together for a few years, hence she decided to include in their portions as well.Fatty Qu quickly walked over to the table and sat there, looking at the spread before him as he gulped a few times and asked: \"Aren't these all restaurant food?\"This person was simply unbelievable! Was she that untrustworthy? He simply did not have any faith in her!\"If you do not want to eat, I won't force you.\" Her eyes narrowed with a glint while serving up the last dish.\"Hahaha, of course I want to eat.\" Fatty Qu quickly replied, sneakily stealing glances at the rabbit who was already nibbling by the table, seeing that it was well and alive and it had on a blissful expression while eating. What\u2019s more, the aroma was so tantalizing, and he concluded \u2013 the food must be delicious!At this time, another person appeared by the door and looking at the table full of appetizing dishes, he cried out in surprise: \"Oh! What a spread, looks like there's no need to go to the Academy's cafeteria today! It smells amazing!\"Sima You Yue looked at the handsome uninvited guest who happily sat himself down by the table and thought back on how he fled yesterday, she asked in an icy tone: \"You're not afraid I'll eat you up today?\"Wi Zi Qi's whole body stiffened when he heard that but then he looked at the spread before him and he shrugged. \"I'm afraid, but let me eat first, then I'll continue being afraid.\"Everyone who heard that was rendered speechless.\"This is your pet?\" Wei Zi Qi looked at the small una.s.suming bunny and asked.When he heard Wei Zi Qi called him a 'pet', Little Roar was furious and glared at him, he was a Spirit Beast, THE Sacred Ancient Beast Hou!One really could not blame Wei Zi Qi for calling Little Roar a pet, if he wanted to blame anyone, it would be on Sima You Yue's infamous reputation for being a trash. That label made everyone believe that he was unable to establish a contract with any Spirit Beasts, and with Little Roar's fluffy and docile appearance, one certainly wouldn't link them as together in manner. It simply looked like an adorable pet kept for entertainment.Sima placed the last dish on the table and replied: \"Yeah, I've spent quite a large sum of money to buy it.\"Little Roar who had already eaten his fill, cast her a glance full of disdain and contempt as he jumped off the table and went to the garden.Bought him? Obviously it was her who cheated him into establis.h.i.+ng a contract! This big liar!Looking at the expression on Little Roar, Wei Zi Qi started doubting himself, was this really just a pet?\"Alright, let's dig in!\" Fatty Qu quickly said as soon as Sima You Yue sat down.\"Wait, what about the other two?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"No idea where they went, every morning it's just me and Zi Qi who goes to cla.s.s together.\" Fatty Qu said impatiently, completely disregarding the other two.\"Is that so?\" What game are they playing at? Acting so mysterious\u2026\"If you go to their rooms now, you won't find anyone.\" Fatty Qu said while stuffing his mouth.\"Alright then, let's dig in.\"She found that what she just said was completely redundant, as the dishes were being swiped away at tremendous speed while she picked up her chopsticks. She laughed and shook her head as she saw the manner and speed these other two were skillfully gobbling up all the food.After breakfast, she went back to her room to pack up and also let Little Roar go into the Spirit Pearl.Originally contract beasts have their own s.p.a.ce, however he complained it was too boring hence she brought him into the Spirit Pearl to let him play with Little Spirit.When she stepped out of her room, Fatty Qu looked at her empty hands and asked: \"Where's your pet? You're not bringing it along?\"\"Not bringing.\"Little Roar was in the Spirit Pearl but when he heard Fatty Qu calling him a 'pet', he was waving his claws and screaming back: \"You dare call me a PET! Fatty Qu! You'd better watch out, one day this Little Master will enlighten you!\"Little Spirit cast Little Roar a contemptuous glance and mumbled: \"Bloodline is good but the temper is too shabby.\"Little Roar who was still waving his claws in the air froze instantly as he turned and stared at Little Spirit for 2 seconds. Crash. He pounced onto Little Spirit.When Sima You Yue and Fatty Qu went to the cla.s.s together, it garnered a lot of attention and those who knew who she was started whispering.\"Why is he in our cla.s.s?\"\"Isn't he a trash? How can he be in our cla.s.s?\"\"That's so unfair! We went through so much during the selections, how can a repeat student come taint our cla.s.s?\"\"Do you know him?\"\"Of course! He's just a trash who can't even sense the Spiritual Qi!\"\"My G.o.d! He's actually such tras.h.!.+ How is he in our cla.s.s!\"\"Isn't it because his grandfather is the Great General.\"\"Ugh, we are in the elite cla.s.s, and we study cultivation. Can he understand anything? Even if he can,he's a trash who can't even cultivate, what can he do? He's just taking up extra s.p.a.ce!\"\"Hahaha, you're right!\"Sima You Yue glanced at these people, although they were whispering, it was all still heard by her. Seeing that only the last row of seats were available, she walked behind and sat down.Those who were seated in front of her looked at each other and stood up, wanting to cause some trouble for her but just then, Feng Zhi Qing walked in. They helplessly sat back down in their seats.Habitually looking at the last row of seats, when he saw Sima You Yue seated, he was surprised.\"Sima You Yue.\"\"Here.\" Sima You Yue was reading a book that was in the drawer and when she heard her name being called out, she looked up.\"Come out with me for a moment.\" He said as he glanced at the others and continued on: \"The others, review on what you have learnt yesterday.\"Sima You Yue had some apprehension when she left the cla.s.sroom with him as she followed him to his office. Thinking back on how she was late for cla.s.ses for a few days, could it be that he was going to expel her?\"Why did you only attend cla.s.s today?\" He asked, unable to detect any joy or anger in it.Really was because of this\u2026She took a deep breath and replied: \"There were some family circ.u.mstances, so there was a slight delay.\"He looked at her for a moment, as if trying to decipher if she was saying the truth. He seemed to be thinking of something when he suddenly said: \"Come here.\"Sima You Yue had no idea what he was up to, but she still obliged and walked over to him.He stretched out his hands and grabbed her wrist.Sima You Yue was taken aback as her eyes widened in surprise by this sudden movement. Only when she felt her wrist was grasped by something cold, had she noticed that he had gotten hold of her. She was inwardly shocked, what level was he? She had not even noticed that he had moved and he had already grasped her wrist.\"Master Feng?\" She looked at him in a puzzled manner.What was this? Molest?Seeing the expression of doubt and wariness in Sima You Yue's eyes, he let go and simply said: \"You can go back.\"She was still confused but since he did not mention anything, it should mean that he was not going to investigate further. Feng Zhi Xing looked at her departing back and his lips curled up as he murmured to himself: \"He started cultivation already, seems like this plan will proceed quite smoothly, very soon\u2026\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

However, this tranquil moment was broken shortly when she heard Little Spirit's warning.\"You have to be careful, that person just now may have found out that you are already a Spirit Master.\"Sima You Yue froze for a moment before asking him, \"Didn't you mention before that with you around, I do not have to worry about people finding out that can cultivate?\u201d\"In general.\" he emphasized. \"I can conceal the spiritual fluctuations emitted from your body, and ordinary people cannot sense it, however that person just now was very powerful and when he held your wrist just now, he did a probe and I think he may have already found out.\"\"Why would he probe me?\"Sima You Yue gave it some thought before throwing it to the back of her mind. Now, what she needed most was time. She needed to maximize her time to efficiently and effectively cultivate since she started much later than everyone else.As soon as she stepped into the cla.s.sroom, the eyes of the students turned hostile and there was a trace of mirth mixed in as everyone's gaze rested on her. Some had thoughts that Feng Zhi Xing had booted her out of cla.s.s and soon a string of curious gazes followed the slim figure walking to the back of the cla.s.s.Sima You Yue ignored them and continued on when suddenly someone stuck a leg out. Everyone stared in delight expecting her to trip and fall, however, all they saw was the slim figure walking smoothly across without any hitches, stepping on that person's leg very naturally as if stepping on a stool.\"Ahhh!\" The person screamed out loud after she walked past as she had deliberately made some adjustments and s.h.i.+fting her weight so that particular step had encompa.s.sed her whole body weight in it.\"Sima You Yue! Watch where you are going! Don't you know how to walk properly?\" That student screamed out loud in anger.\"That's the way I walk.\" She did not bother giving a second look and completely disregarded that person as she strolled back to her seat.\"You\u2026.!\" That student stood up and was about to storm off in her direction to teach her a lesson when another student quickly said: \"Miss Meng, Master Feng is coming.\"Meng Ting saw Master Feng walking in and she had no choice but to sit back down. She turned her head and glared at Sima You Yue, eyes full of resentment.\"Miss Meng, don't you worry, teaching that brat a lesson is as easy as pie. There'll be lots of chances to clean him up.\" He Qiu Zhi said.\"That's true, so what if his grandfather is the Great General? My Meng clan is not afraid!\" A dangerous glint flashed in her eyes when she spat that out.\"Yes, although Sima You Yue has the Great General watching his back, he doesn't have the backing of a great family clan! How can you even compare the likes of Mirage City's largest family clan, the Meng Clan?\" He Qiu Zhi scoffed.\"Quiet down.\" Feng Zhi Xing said as he faced the cla.s.s of thirty five students. \"Today, we will continue with what I've taught you yesterday.\"Sima You Yue leaned in and listened with interest, however while the rest of the cla.s.s were furiously taking down notes, her hands were clasped together.\"Why aren't you taking down any notes?\"When Bei Gong Tang had finished writing down the notes Feng Zhi Xing had given them, she noticed that Sima You Yue had not picked up the brush at all. Curiosity took over and she took the rare initiative to speak to Sima You Yue.\"Hmm?\" Sima You Yue was surprised for a moment as she looked over at Bei Gong Tang. \"I've got them all down.\"Bei Gong Tang looked at her clean notebook and looked back, with her eyebrows raised in query.Sima You Yue pointed to her head and tapped her temple. \"It's all in here.\"Looking at Bei Gong Tang's skeptical expression, she carried on: \"Since young, once I've seen something, I can remember it. I've never forgotten anything once I've looked at it. I've memorized everything Master Feng taught.\"Bei Gong Tang didn't bother anymore, the look of disbelief was still written all over her face but she went back to revise the notes that she had jotted down.Sima You Yue didn't think that Bei Gong Tang would have sat at the last row. She was diligently reading the notes and quietly listening and concentrating hard on the cla.s.s. However, she still gave off the same icy cold aura that separated her from everyone else, as if she had a barrier set around her. This piqued Sima You Yue's curiosity, what could she have experienced that made her that way? It was as if she had a deep hatred buried within, that even her eyes could not suppress.A day of cla.s.s pa.s.sed by without any hitch as various cultivation theories and practical lessons were conducted throughout the day.After they finished cla.s.s, Sima You Yue and Fatty Qu went back to their courtyard and she lightly touched her rumbling stomach, she headed straight to the kitchen.While she was cooking, she could not help but let out a small sigh and lament, she spent quite an amount of time on food, when would she be able to catch up with her cultivation?\"Don't worry, you can also cultivate while eating.\" Little Spirit voiced out when he sensed what was troubling her.\"I can cultivate even when I'm eating? How is it that I've never heard of such a wonderful method before?\" She asked.\"That's because you are ignorant.\" Little Spirit replied honestly without any hesitation.Sima You Yue twisted her lips, this guy! Couldn't he be a little more tactful?Well, she was an adult and he was only a small brat, she shouldn\u2019t argue with kids. She silently convinced herself as she asked: \"So, how do you cultivate while eating?\"\"Those plants that successfully absorb the Spiritual Qi in the air and store them are termed as Spirit Plants. They were originally ordinary plants, but some have managed to absorb the Spiritual Qi and store these Spiritual Qi within.\" Little Spirit explained.Thinking of her past knowledge of photosynthesis, absorbing the carbon dioxide and converting it into oxygen, she could also relate to the matter of the plants absorbing Spiritual Qi.\"As long as you consume food that is imbued with Spiritual Qi, all the Spiritual Qi that were stored in them would be naturally absorbed by your body.\" Little Spirit carried on with his explanation.\"Really?\" She raised an eyebrow, her voice full of doubt. \"If it was so simple, why hasn't anyone else discovered this method? If things were so simple, I'm sure this would have caught on.\"\"It's because the Spiritual Qi here is too thin, there's not enough Spiritual Qi for these plants to transform into Spirit Plants and flourish. So everything in this world are only ordinary plants, so of course there's nothing special about them.\" Little Spirit replied with undisguised contempt.Sima You Yue glared at him once she heard that everything in this world was simply ordinary plants and she felt her blood boil as she yelled back at him: \"Then why the h.e.l.l would you tell me all these things!\"\"Such a moron.\" Little Spirit sneered. \"Even if everything in the outside world are all ordinary plants, that doesn't mean that the plants grown in the Spirit Pearl are!\"\"Huh?\" The sudden realization struck her as she bolted into her room, locked the door and dived straight into the Spirit Pearl.As soon as she arrived in the familiar environment, she called out: \"What did you mean just now, Little Spirit?\"Little Spirit took his time as he slowly appeared before her. \"Feel the Spiritual Qi here.\"Sima You Yue closed her eyes and concentrated. She opened her eyes excitedly as she chirped: \"Such dense Spiritual Qi!\"\"Mmm.\" Little Spirit puffed up his chest with pride.\"Of course, come along now.\" Little Spirit said as he turned around and led her along a small path, a small smile leaked out when he turned away from her.She quickly walked close to him as she looked around inquiringly to the new scene that was in front of her. There was a farm that had many various vegetables planted on one side and on the other side, were many animals.She gaped in bewilderment and asked, wide-eyed. \"How\u2026How are all these animals here?\"\"These are all low level animals who cannot comprehend anything despite living in such great environment enriched with rich Spiritual Qi. They can't cultivate to be Spirit Beasts and they only know how to breed, causing me quite a bit of ha.s.sle to control the population.\" He said wryly.\"I haven't even seen some of these animals in this world, how are there so many animals here?\" She couldn\u2019t suppress her curiosity and continued to ask as she looked at the huge variety of familiar animals that were in front of her.\"These were left behind by the former Master, I have no idea where he caught them from. Anyway, since they've been living here all these while, although they did not become Spirit Beasts, their bodies are still enriched by the rich Spiritual Qi and have quite a vast amount stored within. All these vegetables too, they are all Spirit Plants imbued with Spiritual Qi. You can use them for your food.\"Sima You Yue looked at the familiar culinary ingredients, including spices such as pepper and c.u.min. \" Your former Master couldn't have gone to earth and robbed it\u2026right?\"\"Who knows what he did! Anyway, he was a picky foodie like yourself. You can use them as you like, just remember to leave some behind.\" After saying that, Little Spirit disappeared.Sima You Yue watched Little Spirit dissipate away and she could also feel a trace of loneliness that lingered in her heart, knowing that he must have missed the former Master.Looking at the huge stock of ingredients in front of her, Sima You Yue felt an adrenaline rush as the excitement got the better of her. She could now feast on delicious food and still cultivate at the same time!When she came out of the Spirit Pearl, there was a burst of rapid knocks on her door.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Quick, go find your brother now!\" Fatty Qu let out a small sigh of relief before he rushed her.\"What happened\" Why did he suddenly ask her to go find her brother?\"I was on the way back from the library when I heard that Meng Ting is looking for you and wants to challenge you!\" Fatty Qu quickly said, while still trying to grasp his breath.\"Looking for me?\"\"Yeah, she was blabbering on and on about how a waste like you do not deserve to be in our elite cla.s.s, so she wants to challenge to put you in your place.\"\"Alright, I've got it, thank you.\" Sima You Yue replied.\"If she really wants to challenge you, I'm afraid things will go out of hand, so it's best that you quickly go and look for your brother!\" Fatty Qu insisted.\"Why do I need to go look for my brother? This is my own problem, so I shall solve it myself.\" She leaned lazily on the door as she replied nonchalantly, not at all concerned at the seriousness he had perceived it to be.\"You may be the grandson of the Great General but the Meng Family is not to be trifled with! It's the largest family clan in Mirage City! Moreover she is the direct descendant, so she has always held her nose up high in the air, trampling on everyone else beneath her. Since she has already declared that she is looking for you, she will definitely come knocking soon!\"\"Is she very powerful?\" Sima You Yue asked Fatty Qu who wore a worried expression on his face.\"When she was thirteen, she had already achieved the rank of a fifth grade Spirit Warrior!\"\"Is that very strong?\" She looked at him and asked again.\"Yes, for this age to achieve that, she is considered very strong. Stop dawdling now, my dear Fifth Young Master! Quickly, go and find your brother so that he can protect you!\" Fatty Qu could not take it anymore as he urged her.\"Well, if she's really out to find trouble, even if I avoid it today, she will still come back another day. Hmm? But doesn't the Academy prohibit fighting?\" She asked curiously in an unhurried manner.\"There's this rule but a challenge is different. As long as the challenges are officially fought on stage then it's allowed. Many people who have personal grudges use this method to iron things out using this method. What's more, challenges are all life and death matches where each party would sign a death disclaimer before heading onto stage. She is sure to exact her revenge on you for stepping on her leg in cla.s.s earlier today. Now, the most important is to hide first and we'll think of a plan to avoid the next one, we'll take things step by step!\"\"Hide?\" Sima You Yue gave him an incredulous look as she put crossed her arms. \"There is no such word this dictionary of mine. I, Sima You Yue do not recognize this word!\"\"But\u2026She..\" Fatty Qu was about to continue persuading Sima You Yue when the door of the next room flung open. Wei Zi Qi stepped out and looked at the two people who were in heated discussion. \"What happened?\"Fatty Qu looked helplessly at Wei Zi Qi and explained: \"That Meng Ting wants to issue a challenge to You Yue. I'm trying to get him to find his brother but he refused.\"\"That Meng Ting keeps looking for trouble!\" Wei Zi Qi was agitated when he heard this.\"Fatty Qu, thank you for coming to warn me. I am very grateful for that. However, it seems that it's too late now.\" She raised her chin and looked at the main door as a group of students barged in with Meng Ting.\"Sima You Yue! Not bad courage you have. When I saw Fatty Qu running off to tell you the news, I was sure you've gone into hiding. I'm surprised that you've not run away with your tail tucked behind your legs!\" Meng Ting sneered.\"Well, there's no need for the likes of you.\" Sima You Yue smiled provocatively as she gave her a contemptuous glance from head to toe.\"You!!!\" Meng Ting gnashed her teeth together furiously. Since young, she had always been the object of affection and everyone fawned on her. No one had ever spoken to her in such a manner before! The people living in this courtyard had already made her very mad when no one had put her in their eyes and usually ignored her. She did not expect that a trash like Sima You Yue would dare to be so rude and even dared to give her such a condescending look, as if despising her. She felt the anger in her heart rise as she yelled out: \"Since Fatty Qu had already told you my motive, then I won't waste my breath on you. Sima You Yue, I challenge you! If you lose, you are never to ever take a step into Imperial Academy ever again!\"\"You, a fifth grade Spirit Warrior wants to challenge me? Haha, alright, let's say I take you up on this challenge, tell me, what do I stand to gain if I win?\" Sima You Yue did not even bother looking at Meng Ting as she looked at her nails and fiddled with them.At this point in time, Ouyang Fei's room door swung open and he stepped out. He had on his usually cold demeanor and cast a glance at the commotion in the courtyard before he left without saying a word.Next, Bei Gong Tang's room door also swung open and she looked at Meng Ting and frowned. \"If you want to create a ruckus, go out! Whoever was disrupting my reading, SCRAM!\"Sima You Yue looked at the departing back of Ouyang Fei and listened to Bei Gong Tang's merciless words, these two people somehow seemed to have a few common traits.When Meng Ting heard Bei Gong Tang's words, she seemed to have momentarily lost her composure and had on a brief look of fear. She lowered her voice and glared at Sima You Yue menacingly. \"You, a trash who can't even sense Spiritual Qi, wants to win me? What a joke!\"She threw her head back in laughter as the others who followed her in all had the same look of disdain as they laughed together mockingly.\"A joke? Well, you may find it funny now but careful you may not be even able to laugh later.\" Sima You Yue lips curled up, her voice laced with mirth.\"Hah! Just say what you want.\" Meng Ting scoffed.\"Sima You Yue looked in the direction of Bei Gong Tang and said: \"I have no intention of disturbing my dorm mate, since you are here to challenge me, then to make me take up your challenge, you must also give me something to stake. Hmm, let's do it this way, if by a stroke of incredible luck I somehow manage to beat you, all you have to do in future is whenever you see me, you will turn have to turn tail and stay out of my sight! If you're okay with this then I'm up for the challenge.\"\"Fine! If you win, I will get out of your sight whenever I see you, and no longer stir up any trouble for you. But, if I win, then you'll have to get out of Imperial Academy!\" Meng Ting declared.\"Alright, so it's set, why don't you head over to the stage first, I'll come in a while.\" Saying this, Sima You Yue turned and closed her room door.\"You Yue\u2026\" Fatty Qu did not have the opportunity to continue with his words when he was shut outside.\"Let's go! We'll wait for her on the challenge stage!\" Meng Ting gave a last glance at Sima You Yue's door as she left happily.The courtyard finally regained back it's tranquility. Bei Gong Tang gave a final glance at Fatty Qu who was still standing outside of Sima You Yue's door before closing her own door.Fatty Qu thought back on this morning's meeting with the General Residence's Fourth Young Master Sima You Le who had seeked him out and had especially asked him to look after his brother on his behalf. Never did he expect that half a day later, Sima You Yue had already embroiled himself in such trouble.\"No, I have to quickly inform Fourth Young Master!\" Fatty Qu's eyes had a glint of resolve in them as he ran out.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

With a thought, Little Roar appeared in front of her.\"What's the matter?\" She hugged him and ruffled his furry his long ears and asked gently.\"Yue Yue, you really want to challenge that white lotus?\" Little Roar asked.\"Yes, why not? Since people specially came to provoke me, tell me, can I retreat?\"Sima You Yue threw Little Roar into the air as he leaped in a beautiful crescent arc and when he saw he was going to hit the wall, he swiftly twisted his body and flew back to see her searching for something within her interspatial ring. \"What are you looking for?\"\"Weapons! I need to find a weapon for this challenge. In the ring that cheap dad left me had only a pathetic selection of weapons.\"You want weapons? I saw a lot over at Little Spirits' place!\" Little Roar reported.\"Oh really? Let's go have a look then!\" With a thought, they both entered the Spirit Pearl once again.As soon as they entered, Little Spirit appeared before them. \"Come with me\" he calmly said as he turned and led the way. It seems he knew the reason for her arrival.\"This is the former former's Master's weapon refinement collection. Little Spirit brought them to a room filled with a wide variety of weapons.\"How many former masters did you have?\" After listening to Little Spirit's words, she could not hold back her curiosity and asked.\"There's only those few.\" Little Spirit disappeared right after.Sima You Yue had a good look at the weapons and found that the majority comprised of Holy armaments. Sprawled across the wall were all grand and majestic weapons, however looking for an inconspicuous low profile weapon was rather hard.After going through almost all the weapons, she finally found a little dagger at the far corner of the room. She picked it up and flipped it about on her hand and felt the weight and finally said: \"It's settled, this would be it.\"After Sima You Yue left the room, Little Spirit appeared and took a glance and when he saw the empty spot at the far corner of the room where the dagger used to be, he was surprised. \"She actually chose that weapon and it did not resist. To think that all the former Masters did not manage to gain it's acknowledgment, yet , a girl who has just embarked on the path to cultivation had managed gain it's approval\u2026Or could it be that her future would be a long and arduous path threaded with obstacles?When Sima You Yue took the dagger out and removed it from the sheath, she was dumbfounded.\"Hahaha\"Little Roar was laughing hysterically sprawled on the ground, holding his stomach and wiping a tear off.\"Yue Yue, you chose for such a long time and in the end, out of all the fine weapons in there, you actually picked out a rusty dagger?!\"Sima You Yue stared helplessly at the dagger in her hands. Although it felt alright in her hands but when she unsheathed it, other than the handle being wrapped by leather, the entire blade was covered in a layer of rust. How was she going to use this for the challenge?At this time, a male student had ran to their courtyard and hollered out: \"Sima You Yue! Miss Meng has asked me to remind you that the challenge is starting soon, if you are not going for it, it\u2019s best to start packing your things and scram!\"After saying what he needed to, he turned and left. Although Meng Ting was not afraid of her Grandfather, that didn\u2019t mean the others felt the same, if they were caught by Sima You Yue, their future would be bleak.When Sima You Yue heard the message, she sighed and said: \"Now I don\u2019t even have time to polish it, we'll just use what we have then. Although it doesn\u2019t look nice, it still fits well in my hands.\"Little Roar threw her a look of contempt: \"Any other weapon would be better than that?\"\"What do you know. A weapon and a person must resonate, if I simply pick any weapon, at a critical juncture, it might just drag me down.\" She mumbled and sheathed the dagger and continued to argue in defence: \"Also, for some weapons, in the hands of different people, a different power may be unleashed.\"She blinked for a moment as she stared at the dagger. For a moment there, she thought it moved on its own. Hmm, it must have been an illusion.\"Well, that\u2019s what you said the last time as well. But since then, you\u2019ve still not found a weapon that you're happy with.\" Little Roar complained.He looked at the dagger with disdain. In her past life, she had never found a suitable weapon and she was always searching for that one weapon. Now, in her present life, how did she end up with such a dilapidated weapon?Looking at the reality before him, his heart felt cold.Sima You Yue saw the expression on Little Roar and felt three black lines at the back of her head. What was this expression? Did he despise her weapon, or her? And what\u2019s with the sullen expression and the feeling of sadness that was welling up within her?\"Do you want to go back?\" She asked.\"No! I want to stay outside and see you trash that white lotus with my own eyes! I\u2019ve not seen you for such a long time! I don\u2019t wanna go back!\" He shook his head vehemently.\"Alright then, let\u2019s go.\" She tucked the dagger safely on her waist belt and carried Little Roar out.As the whole world knows, she couldn\u2019t cultivate. She couldn\u2019t put the dagger in the interspatial ring now. Not yet.When she heard the neighbouring door open, Bei Gong Tang glanced out her window and shook her head before she continued reading the book in her hand.\"You Yue.\"Sima You Yue stopped in her tracks, she had just stepped out of the courtyard and she heard Wei Zi Qi call out from behind.\"Zi Qi, something?\"\"Nothing.\" He shook his head. \"I\u2019ll accompany you to the stage, no matter what the results are, it\u2019s better you have someone accompany you there.\"As they walked towards the stage, it attracted the attention of many as people started pointing at them and talking in hushed tones.\"I thought he had already been expelled, didn\u2019t think that he was hiding amongst the freshmen.\"\"Who do you think his Grandfather is? If he wants to stay in the Academy, all they need is a word from him.\"\"Really shameless, this kind of person can only rely on their background, its too unfair!\"\"I heard that Meng Ting challenged him to a fight, if he loses, he will leave the Academy and never take a step back!\"\"They should quickly let him go, if such people stay on, wouldn\u2019t it just tarnish the reputation of our esteemed Imperial Academy?\"\"I also heard that if he won, he wanted Meng Ting to avoid him and make a detour if she ever ran into him.\"\"He really knows how to dream. I heard Miss Meng's temper isn\u2019t very good, this time he provoked her, I wonder how miserable would he be on stage later?\"\"That Meng Ting has already achieved reaching the level of a fifth grade Spirit Warrior at a young age, although the level isn\u2019t very high, it\u2019s enough to deal with a waste.\"\"Yeah! Can\u2019t wait to see him get thrown out of the Academy gates!\"\"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\"Sima You Yue and Wei Zi Qi were walking past and these careless whispers and insults were just thoughtlessly being thrown out, thinking that they couldn\u2019t hear them well.However, each word was heard clearly and Wei Zi Qi flushed red with anger. But when he saw that Sima You Yue walked on leisurely as if he heard nothing, Wei Zi Qi could only hold it in and walked alongside.\"Aren\u2019t you angry?\" Wei Zi Qi asked through his gritted teeth.\"What\u2019s there to be angry about? Those dogs that bite are the quiet ones. These barking dogs only know how to make noise. The best way to shut them up is using strength to speak!\"\"Challenge stage? This should be it.\" Sima You Yue read out loud in the words that were hung on the signboard above.Before she had even stepped inside, she could already hear the noise spilling out here from inside.Seems like Meng Ting had gathered quite a number of people to watch the battle!ps: white lotus in this instance means more like a derogatory term, something along the lines of a flower vase.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Most of them were here to see how Sima You Yue was going to be defeated Many couldn't wait to see him being humiliated, they wanted to watch the show and see how he ran away with his tail tucked between his legs.Although in terms of status, they can\u2019t compare to Sima You Yue, but they wanted to witness with their own eyes at his defeat and his expression at the moment of defeat.\"How is that trash still not here yet?\"Although they did not dare call him names straight to his face, behind his back they had a huge variety of names that was used.\"Could it be that he's now afraid and backed out?\" Another person chimed in.\"After all, Miss Meng is a Spirit Master, compared to that waste, hmph! I\u2019m sure he likely to escaped already!\"\"If that\u2019s the case, he wouldn\u2019t be so thick skinned and appear in our Academy again!\"\"Really so annoying! This trash's skin is thicker than the walls! Or else he wouldn\u2019t keep pestering Murong An!\"\"This Murong An is quite unlucky, he\u2019s been targeted by a male. The expression he has on whenever he sees Sima You Yue, tsk tsk\u2026 I really pity him.\"\"Haha! This Sima You Yue is going to be kicked out of the Academy, has Murong An arrived yet to witness this spectacle?\"\"Yes, I see Murong An's group! They are seated at the front row!\"Everyone looked towards the direction he was pointing at and sure enough, in the middle of the first row, Murong An and Nalan family's Young Miss, Nalan Lan were seated together.\"Murong, this Sima You Yue will come, right?\" Nalan Lan asked gently with an air of n.o.ble arrogance.\"Even if he does not come, I will have my own ways to make him disappear from the Academy!\" Murong An spat out with disgust. \"I thought that he had already been expelled from the Academy, who knew he actually joined the freshman cla.s.s after the New Year started. If he dares to hara.s.s me again, don\u2019t blame me for being ruthless!\"\"Brother in law, you can rest a.s.sured that piece of trash won\u2019t hara.s.s you again.\" Nalan Qi said with an insidious smile.\"Oh Brother, what nonsense are you saying?\" Nalan Lan nudged her Brother with a faint blush on her face.\"Hahahaha, why are you still so shy? Since both of you have already established a couple relations.h.i.+p, all that\u2019s missing is a wedding. In my heart, Murong An is already my Brother in law, isn\u2019t that so? My Brother in law?\" Nalan Qi teased Murong An unabashedly as well.Murong An did not say anything but he also didn\u2019t deny anything.\"Oh look! That trash finally appeared!\"Following that outcry, everyone\u2019s gaze darted to the entrance and saw Sima You Yue strolling in with Wei Zi Qi.Standing on stage was Meng Ting, and when she saw Sima You Yue enter, she raised her hands and the entire challenge grounds immediately quietened down.\"You\u2019ve made me wait so long, I thought that you had escaped already!\" Meng Ting taunted as she sneered at Sima You Yue.\"How could it be? You\u2019ve given me such a rare opportunity to make yourself disappear from my sight in the future, how could I miss out on such a good deal!\" Sima You Yue took a look around the arena and saw that it was packed. What a huge crowd!Seems like a lot of them came here, seeing her as a joke.\"Since you\u2019re here already, enough nonsense. Faster, come up!\" Meng Ting said impatiently.She couldn\u2019t wait to teach that waste a lesson, she had already spent so much time waiting for that piece of trash and he still had the cheek to be late!\"I'll wait for you at the stands.\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"There\u2019s no need to, I\u2019ll finish this real quick, just wait here for me.\" Sima You Yue replied.\"Alright then.\" Wei Zi Qi nodded and stood beside the challenge stage and watched her step forward.Meng Ting looked at Sima You Yue and with a voice filled with contempt and snickered: \"If I were you, to save some face for my family, I\u2019d just directly throw in the towel.\"\"Why should I?\"\"Because I will beat you up until you admit defeat. Everyone here will witness the General's grandson beaten miserably to a pulp, and the whole General's residence will be put to shame. Your whole family will become a huge joke!\"\"Wow, so you are confident that you can defeat me?\" Sima You Yue raised her eyebrows in a taunt.Meng Ting puffed up her chest and answered: \"Of course!\" Her whole self br.i.m.m.i.n.g with confidence.\"You Yue!\"At this time, Sima You Le and Fatty Qu frantically ran in and when Sima You Le saw that Sima You Yue was already standing on the stage, he was struck silly and felt as if his soul had left his body.\"You Yue! What are you doing up there! Quick! Come down NOW!\" He was shouting at her as he ran in.\"You Yue\u2026You..come..down..\" Fatty Qu was panting heavily as he gasped for his breath.\"Fourth Brother, why are you here?\" Sima You Yue looked at the two figures das.h.i.+ng towards her, guessing that it was most probably Fatty Qu who had called him. Before she left she didn\u2019t see Fatty Qu and thought that he was in his room, she didn\u2019t expect that he had actually went to look for her Brother for help.This friends.h.i.+p, she has noted it down thoroughly!Looking at the panic stricken two, she beamed widely and said: \"Fourth Brother, I\u2019m now already standing on the challenge stage, unless there is a victor, no one can step down. Unless I admit defeat, if not I can\u2019t come down.\"On the way here, she had already heard about the rules from Wei Zi Qi.\"That\u2026\" Sima You Le wanted to ask You Yue to directly throw in the towel, safety was his priority.\"Fourth Brother!\" Sima You Yue knew what Sima You Le wanted to say and stopped him. \"For the reputation of our Sima Family, I will not run away! And I will never let our Sima Family suffer another humiliation because of me ever again!\"Hearing the words of Sima You Yue, the people present were shocked. Was this the same cowardly Sima You Yue?\"You Yue\u2026\" Sima You Le looked at the blinding smile she gave. His 'Fifth Brother' had really changed.\"Don\u2019t worry, nothing will happen to me.\" She gave a superfluous smile next and casually gave a victory sign to her Brother. She turned and faced Meng Ting, \"Let's start.\"Meng Ting looked at the people standing below the stage and impatiently snapped: \"Since you cannot cultivate, I\u2019ll let you use a weapon. Quick, bring out your weapon!\"Little Roar was in Wei Zi Qi's arms and he was squirming with excitement when he heard Sima You Yue said start. However, after hearing Meng Ting Asking her to bring out her weapon, he froze and covered his eyes with his little paws, burrowing deeply into Wei Zi Qi's arms.Wei Zi Qi was puzzled at the little furball's reaction in his arms. Just a moment ago it was squirming in excitement and the next moment it just stood still with its eyes covered.When Sima You Yue took out the dagger from her waistband, it looked as if it was simply wrapped in a cloth. A burst of laughter broke out once she removed the cover.\"Hahahahahahaha! Has the Prestigious General's family ran out of weapons? Or have they gone bankrupt? Don\u2019t even have enough money to get a decent weapon? He wants to use a rusty dagger to fight against a Spirit Master?! Hahaha! What a joke!\"\"This is hilarious! Hahahahaha!\"Boisterous laughter filled the arena.Sima You Le looked at the dagger in Sima You Yue's hands and he cringed. He wanted to follow Little Roar and cover his eyes in embarra.s.sment\u2026this rusty dagger\u2026 could it even be called a weapon?Meng Ting was speechless when she saw Sima You Yue pull out that rusty dagger. She was stunned for a moment and broke into a smile. \"Tsk tsk\u2026 Sima You Yue, you have no Spirit Energy yet you dare to swagger in front of me with this piece of junk? Don\u2019t tell me this rust will absorb my Spirit power? Hahaha!\"Sima You Yue had guessed that bringing out that dagger would have brought about such a reaction but she liked how the dagger felt in her hand. The handle was comfortable and she decided that when she got back later, all that blade needed was just a good polish.In the face of all the ridicule, she simply brushed everything aside as noise and looked at Meng Ting in the eye. There was a dangerous glint in them as she smiled.\"Let's start.\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Fighting him had given her the experience of fighting a Spirit Warrior and an insight on how they fought. She had a.n.a.lysed from her past experience, that they first needed to gather and condense their Spirit Energy and that, was her key to attaining victory. This short time frame was her window and she just needed to grasp it well.A referee was on stage and once he said 'start', Meng Ting immediately started to converge her Spirit Energy on her hand.Sima You Yue simply stood still and everyone thought that she was scared and had frozen there in fear. After all, Sima You Yue was a well known 'trash' and when he saw Spirit Energy, he would be scared.\"Ugh! Why isn\u2019t he moving!\" Fatty Qu cried out in anguish.\"If he\u2019s not going to make a move, Meng Ting would finish condensing all her Spirit Energy very soon!\" Wei Zi Qi was frowning and baffled at why Sima You Yue had not moved an inch.Moreover, there wasn\u2019t any trace of fear on his face, only a confident smile!Sima You Le was just standing at the side of the stage, his eyes fixated on You Yue as he watched on nervously. With his two fists clenched tightly, he was in a stance that showed that was ready to rush to the stage to Sima You Yue's aid anytime.If Sima You Yue was in a ny real danger, he was ready to rush to her aid!Everyone was antic.i.p.ating Sima You Yue to be badly wounded and riddled with injuries. They had on a knowing smile but very soon, that smile became stiff as their eyes bulged out in shock.When Meng Ting was about to successfully converge the Spirit Energy, Sima You Yue suddenly moved and he dashed towards Meng Ting at an astonis.h.i.+ng speed!In just a mere few seconds, he had closed up the gap of more than ten metres and had appeared behind Meng Ting!The moment Meng Ting saw Sima You Yue rush towards her, she threw her rationality behind and threw out the incomplete condensed ball of Spirit Energy at Sima You Yue. Looking gleefully at the energy ball that was just about to land on Sima You Yue, she saw him twist strangely and completely dodged the energy ball!Boom!The Spirit Energy Ball landed on the challenge stage with an explosive boom that rocked the stage.Before Meng Ting could come to her senses and gather her thoughts, she felt something cold on her neck.\"You\u2019ve lost.\" Sima You Yue's faint voice came from behind.Everyone was stunned silly. Sima You You was standing behind Meng Ting with his hand wrapped around her shoulders and his rusty dagger was pressed against her delicate neck.\"How did you get behind me?!\" Meng Ting asked with shock, her eyes wide with surprise.\"By running with my legs!\" Sima You Yue replied dismissively. \"Hmmm\u2026Although this dagger is rusty and may be somewhat blunt but if I use some strength, I think I can still slit your throat with it, or maybe I can draw a few lines on your face. What do you think?\"She lifted the rusty dagger and lightly followed the contours of Meng Ting's face.Meng Ting was scared silly when she felt the cold blade move lightly over her face.\"Ah! Do not touch my face! I\u2026I admit defeat!\"Meng Ting shouted out with teary eyes, leaving the whole stand of spectators completely shocked once again.\"Miss Meng actually lost to a waste!\"\"How did that trash appear behind Miss Meng?\"\"He was just lucky, if it was a proper battle, I\u2019m sure Miss Meng would have definitely defeated him!\"\"He..won?\"\"That waste won this round, so means he is still our cla.s.smate.. oh my G.o.d!\"Sima You Yue let go of Meng Ting and sneered. \"Since you\u2019ve thrown in the towel, means that you have to comply with our agreement. Next time if you see me, you have to make a detour and take a different path! I don\u2019t want to see you again! And if you still come and look for trouble\u2026\"She did not complete her sentence and trailed off at the end but the meaning behind it was evident.Meng Ting was full of resentment when she looked at Sima You Yue casually picking up the dagger cover and swaggering off the stage.There was no other way she could go about it,with so many eyes on their match today, if she didn\u2019t comply with the agreement, then she would digging her own grave if she still went to look for trouble. One thing about the people of this world, was that they all kept to their promises. They absolutely hated and despised people who went back on their words. So honouring the bet was the only thing she could do.\"So fast? Everything\u2019s over?\" Fatty Qu saw Sima You Yue stroll down the stage leisurely and was walking over to them.\"What do you think?\" She laughed when she saw the dumbfounded expression Fatty Qu had on. That foolish look made her reach out and poked his head in amus.e.m.e.nt.Only when Sima You Le saw that You Yue was completely fine, his heart completely relaxed. Once he relaxed, the suppressed rage erupted from within. \"How can you easily accept such a challenge?! For goodness sake! This is a life and death challenge!!! What if something happened to you?\" He roared at her in a thunderous voice as he held her firmly on her shoulders and shook her in anger.\"Fourth Brother, look at me, I'm fine, aren't I?\" She leaned towards him and held his hand, her voice in a coaxing tone, she cooed: \"Alright, everything is over, whatever you want to say, we'll say it when we get back, kay? There's too many people here.\"\"Hmph! You still know shame!\" He snorted.\"Cough cough, come on, let's head back first.\" Wei Zi Qi interjected as he felt a lot of strange glances fixed on their group.\"Let's go.\"On the way back, Sima You Le was nagging non stop at her. He kept harping on how she should not disregard her own safety, if there was any problems, always look for them and they would help her solve.After hearing the same thing for the upteenth time, Sima You Yue looked at him seriously and said: \"Fourth Brother, I have grown up and I cannot always rely on you guys to protect me. You are my family and you have all given me warmth and love. It is my turn to protect all of you. I want to be stronger, so that I can protect the people I care about. If I shrank away from such a challenge, it means giving up on myself. Tell me, how can the heart of a coward be strong?\"\"You\u2026ugh..You've really grown up.\" Sima You Le patted You Yue's shoulder helplessly. He couldn't decipher the mixed emotions he was feeling now after hearing these words.Was he happy that she's all grown up? Or sad that she no longer needed their protection?Sima You Yue sensed his complex emotions and held his hands and leaned her head on his shoulder, as she gently said: \"No matter what I've become, I'm always be your 'baby brother'. You are all my brothers and we're forever a family!\"Sima You Le patted her head as he smiled. \"Mmm, we'll always be together.\"\"Eew! Can you guys not be so mushy! This is so nauseating!\" Fatty Qu rubbed his arms in a s.h.i.+ver in exaggeration.Just now he had heard the touching words and had turned to look at them. However when he saw them stuck together so closely, he cried out: \"Don't tell me you are interested even in your own brother?\"Sima You Yue broke away from her brother and kicked Fatty Qu and she reb.u.t.ted him harshly: \"Fatty Qu, go and die!\"Fatty Qu dodged her attack , of course this was possible only because she did not have any intention to really attack him, or else with such skills, he would never be able to escape her clutches.\"Hmph! Count yourself lucky that you've managed to dodge in time!\" Sime You Yue touched her stomach and gave a goofy grin. \"I'm famished! Let's go back and eat.\"After getting back to their courtyard, Sima You prepared a few simple dishes and everyone dined together. After polis.h.i.+ng up everything on the table, they all went back.Sima You Yue returned to her own room and retrieved a block of whetstone from the Spirit Pearl, preparing to polish the rust off.Just as she was about to start grinding it, she heard Little Spirit screaming at her in condemnation.\"You fool!

    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26: \"Supreme Artifacts\u201dThere was a shriek mixed in with Little Spirit's scolding hence it was not possible for that shriek to belong to Little Spirit.Sima You Yue looked at Little Roar who had on the same puzzled expression, so she also ruled him out.Before she could even continue her train of thoughts, the scene around her had changed and she had already been pulled into the Spirit Pearl and Little Spirit was floating in front of her.\"Didn\u2019t you say that only with my thought then I can enter? How did you manage to pull me in?\"She asked in a disgruntled tone.Little Spirit gave her another condescending glance and said: \"Those are only for the general Spirit Artifacts, those stronger artifacts that are more powerful, like myself, have the ability to take the initiative.\"\"Oh, alright then.\" She touched her nose and asked again. \"So why did you pull me in here? What was all that screaming about?\"\"Really an idiot!\" Little Spirit couldn't help but think that out of all his previous masters, Sima You Yue was the most stupid one. He then thought back and tried to figure out how did their destinies get entwined together, having recognized her as a master.Sima You Yue gently knocked her knuckle on his head and asked in a dissatisfied tone: \"Are there Spirit Artifacts like you who despise their own masters? If I ever see you with this same expression on, I'm just going to throw the Spirit Pearl into fire and roast it!\"\"I'm just speaking the truth.\" Little Spirit answered nonchalantly, not a trace of fear could be found in his voice.\"Alright, just tell me the main reason on why you interrupted me and pulled me in here for.\" After saying, she had an an image in her mind and with a thought, a chair appeared before her.She had already grasped how things worked in here. Her thoughts worked magically in here, whatever she wanted, all she needed to do was to conjure up the image in her mind and with a simple thought, it would appear. Her thoughts were akin to G.o.d's power in here. Whatever she wanted, would simply manifest before her with a single thought from her.When Little Spirit saw how fast she had grasped onto how things worked here, he furrowed his brows.\"Oh, stop dawdling and quickly spill the beans! Hurry up and say it!\" Little Roar who was beside her couldn't take the suspense anymore and quickly urged Little Spirit impatiently.Little Spirit still did not answer them and arrived before the dagger and poked it with his chubby hands. \"Have you played enough? When are you going to drop all this pretence.\"There was no movement from the dagger.\"Continue on with this farce and I'll really let her polish you with this whetstone!\" Little Spirit threatened.This threat seemed to have worked better and the dagger above the whetstone shook gently trembled a couple of times and it suddenly shot up above Little Spirit's head and without any warning, it whacked Little Spirit's head. A tender voice sounded out: \"You dare to polish this Big Master? This Big Master here will chop you up into pieces!\"Little Spirit's wrath was ignited and he no longer paid any heed to Sima You Yue and immediately lunged towards the dagger.Sima You Yue and Little Roar watched on speechlessly at this scene in front of them, both still in shock as they watched the two fighting each other while each threw blatant threats at the same time.\"This dagger can speak?\" Little Roar asked in astonishment.\"Do you know what's going on?\" Sima You Yue asked him.\"Nope, no idea.\" Little Roar answered very simply.\"Didn't you say that you were an Ancient Sacred Spirit Beast, and you know everything?\" She looked at him with contempt.\"Oh, haha, I'm just a descendant of the Ancient Sacred Spirit Beast, I've not lived for thousands of millenniums, so how would I know? What I meant when I said I know everything was referring to my heritage, I've nothing to do with this guy here, so how would I know anything about him?\" Little Roar quickly evaded her eyes, but at the same time, he let out a little sigh.He had also mentioned this to her before, but now that her soul was damaged, she held no memories of the former.After watching the two for a while more, Sima You Yue asked: \"When are two of you going to fight till? Can someone tell me what's going on?\"When the dagger heard Sima You Yue's voice, it flew over immediately as it floated in front of her and the same tender voice sounded out: \"Little Yue Yue, don't use the whetstone to polish me, kay!\"She poked the dagger in front of her in curiosity and asked: \"You're covered in such a thick layer of rust, if I don't use a whetstone to polish you, tell me how am I to use you? More importantly, you're a dagger! How can you talk?! Little Spirit! Come over and tell me what's happening!\"With her sudden change in temperament and her aggressive tone, both Little Spirit and the dagger were shocked.\"It's not an ordinary artifact.\" Little Spirit explained.\"I can see that, quick, say the main points. Tell me, what is this thing?\" Sima You Yue rolled her eyes in annoyance.\"I'm not a thing! I'm a Supreme Artifact!\" The dagger yelled out in defence.Not a thing\u2014Sima You Yue was rendered speechless at the dagger's defence, at the same time, she was also surprised by what it said last, it claimed that it was a supreme artifact.\"You are a Supreme Artifact? The Supreme Artifact is obviously me!\" Little Spirit retorted at once.\"I am the Supreme Artifact, I'm more powerful than you!\" The dagger countered back.\"I'm more powerful!\" Little Spirit said.\"No, I'M more powerful.\"\"Enough. Both of you stop fighting. Can you just explain to me what's going on? In the end, what is this\u2026thing?\" She had to stop their childish banter, the way things were going, if she didn't interrupt them, they might have gone on till the next day.\"Little Yue Yue! I've already said that I'm not a thing!\" The dagger said as if being wronged and the voice was full of grievance. \"I've already said, I'm a Supreme Artifact! I'm the Supreme Artifact Ling Long.When Little Spirit heard that dagger claim itself to be s supreme artifact, he wanted to retort but he was silenced by that deadly glare from Sima You Yue. All he could do was to swallow back the words he had wanted to say.\"Ling Long? What weapon is that?\" Sima You Yue asked, her curiosity piqued.\"It's means Ling Long.\" Ling Long simply said. \"I was born from the beginning of time, when the heavens and earth were made, I was made from a piece of the divine rock Ling Long. A deity had picked me up and refined me into an artifact. Before he had picked me up, I had already formed my own awareness and had my own consciousness. When he was refining me, I was cut up into pieces, melded under high pressure and intense heat. Going through all that excruciating pain made me lose my consciousness and when I came to, I had already become like that.\"\"Why did he make you into a dagger? A dagger's attack power isn't as good as other weapons.\" Sima You Yue asked.\"This is not my original form.\" Ling Long said. \"But this is the only form I can show now.\"\"So you mean to say that you can change into other form of weapons?\" Sima You Yue asked excitedly.\"Of course! Since I'm a Supreme Artifact, I sure have a great ability!\" Ling Long voice became proud and continued on: \"I can change into any weapons, spear, saber, sword, whatever you want me to turn into, I can do it! Well, other than this rolling bead in front of me, that is. As long as it's a weapon, I can turn into it!\"\"This shows that you are still not as good as me! Hmph!\" Little Spirit stuck out his chest and boasted.Sima You Yue looked at the dagger with sparkling eyes and asked: \"Can you change into another weapon for me to have a look?\"\"This transformation is controlled by my master. Little Yue Yue, I like you very much! I'll acknowledge you to be my master!\"\"Acknowledge me to be a master? This weapon also needs to establish a link?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"What an idiot! Without establis.h.i.+ng a link, tell me if you are able to enter the Spirit Pearl?\" Little Spirit retorted.Sima You Yue stared at Little Spirit and frowned. This kid had been recently scolding her a lot, calling her stupid this and that\u2026 Since when was she stupid? She was just very unfamiliar with this world!\"Giggle-\" The dagger explained patiently: \"In this world, Spirit Artifacts need to establish a link with their masters. This link will also play an important part in drawing out the powers of the spirit artifacts. The closer the bond, the more powerful the Spirit Artifact.\"\"Oh, so it's like this! I didn't know that. Alright then, let's establish a link and get this acknowledgment thing going!\" Sima You Yue clapped her hands in excitement.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslated by SocksrockerChapter 27: \u201cLing Long\u201dSima You Yue thought of the previous time she recognised Little Spirit as her master. It seemed as if it was something that needed her own blood. Therefore, she placed her own finger upon the dagger and, before she made any action, Ling Long gave her a cut. In a flash, the fresh blood moistened the dagger.\"You look so old and rusty, I never thought that you would still be so sharp.\" Sima You Yue said. She wanted to retrieve her hand but she realised that her hand was completely unable to leave Ling Long's body. The situation was exactly the same as the previous circ.u.mstance as Little Spirit.\"Yue yue!\" Little Roar saw Sima You Yue faint and quickly flew over.\"Don't worry, she just lost too much blood. She won't die.\" Little Spirit said.After Ling Long sucked enough blood, it immediately lay down beside Sima You Yue, and belched satisfactorily. The rust on the dagger started to completely fall off. The entire dagger was so clean that you could use it as a mirror and the edge of the dagger started to give off a cold ray of light. With one glance, one could tell that it was incomparably sharp.Not only that, but after the rust completely fell off, in a split second, the dagger turned transparent. Little Roar and Little Spirit only saw that, inside the blade, Sima You Yue's blood was churning chaotically. As such, every single part of the blade was covered with bloodstains. At the same time, a beam of red light shot towards the heavens and the inside of the entire Spirit Pearl was engulfed in red.It was lucky that this was the inside of the Spirit Pearl. If it were outside instead, this movement would have undoubtedly drawn more than a little amount of trouble.Little Spirit and Little Roar were blinded by the red light and could not open their eyes. After waiting for the red light to disperse, they opened their eyes and saw a small child sitting on Sima You Yue's body, smiling happily. That baby's voice was small and was really similar to a little doll.\"A, a small child?\" Little Roar and Little Spirit were both shocked dumb.\"You, how can you be so small?\" Little Spirit pointed at Ling Long, \"Furthermore, you're even a female!\"Although this Ling Long had already been wasting away inside the Spirit Pearl for tens of millions of years, it had always been in the form of a dagger. It completely never crossed his mind that this Ling Long would be a female child.\"Why can I not turn into a small child? Aren't you one yourself. Hmph!\" Ling Long turned her back on Little Spirit. Looking at Sima You Yue's pale appearance, she asked, \"When will master wake up?\"\"My dear little sister!\" Little Roar flew in front of Ling Long and said, \"Little sister Ling Long should not worry, Yue Yue will wake up very soon!\"\"Little Sister your a.s.s!\" Ling Long turned her body over and stepped on Little Roar's face and said, \"When Big Sis was formed, you were still in some unknown corner of the universe and were not even reincarnated! You still dare to call me little sister? If you want to call me anything, you should call me Big Sis Ling Long!\"Although Little Roar's face was soon going to be stepped into a meat pancake, he stretched out a small claw to pat Ling Long's leg and said fawningly, \"Does Big Sis Ling Long's leg hurt? Do you need me to help you blow on it?\"\"You are so soft and tender, how could you hurt me?\" One sentence of 'Big Sis Ling Long' had satisfied Ling Long; this little beast was quite cute. After which, she flew back to Sima You Yue's body and sat down. With her little hand holding her chin, her face was full of worry as she looked at the Sima You Yue who wouldn't wake up.It appeared that Little Roar was able to notice that Ling Long was really someone who had a fiery temperament. If she was dissatisfied with you for a single moment, she would definitely shout to beat and kill you. It was no wonder that people like Little Spirit were unable to handle her, and would quarrel with her for so many years.Despite that, she seemed to like Sima You Yue. Even before they recognised their master, it was clear to see. But why?It was not only Little Roar who was unable to figure this out, but neither could Little Spirit. He and Ling Long had been together for so many years. Watching her look for a master over and over again, being filled with regret and returning over and over again, and finally, simply being too lazy to continue searching, they wasted away inside the Spirit Pearl.For someone who was so fussy about their master, why would she look upon Sima You Yue with such favor when Sima You Yue had only recently become a Spirit Master?Little Spirit unknowingly asked this question out loud. Ling Long smiled and said, \"Because she understands me.\"\"But, for someone like you whose nature is so aggressive, don't you only like people who are strong? She has only just started practicing.\" Said Little Spirit.\"She will become strong.\" Ling Long said confidently.After saying this, she stretched forth her short hand and gently prodded Sima You Yue's face.Sima You Yue, once again, saw these scenes that she had not seen for such a long time; the raging fire, which burnt the beautiful mansion to ashes. This was not the apartment building that belonged to her world. It was a beautiful, old and antique building. The nameplate 'Ximen Mansion' hung upon the front door. The flames quickly rushed up and immediately engulfed the majestic door.Watching the entire mansion burn down in flames, Sima You Yue's heart felt as if it was pierced with a countless number of knives. A silhouette appeared amidst the flames and faced her while laughing heartily, \"Ximen You Yue, look at your home. It's turned into a pile of ashes. Hahaha, what qualifications do you still have to fight with me?\"Sima You Yue could not see her face clearly, but she could remember that voice. That voice was incomparably sharp and it pierced straight through her heart.Why, why did she have this kind of dream again. Was this what Little Roar talked about, her forgotten past?But she remembered that in her previous life on this earth, she was killed by an explosion, at the hands of her company's second in command.Unless you're saying, after she had died on the earth, she had pa.s.sed through this world and lived another life, becoming Ximen You Yue, receiving Little Roar. After which, having her entire family and herself a.s.sa.s.sinated. The reason was completely unknown. When she had reincarnated for the second time, she became this obsessive love-struck Miss.Furthermore, like Little Roar said, when she had died previously, her spirit had received a trauma. That was why she had forgotten memories from the middle part of her life. Also, Little Roar had confirmed that she had forgotten those memories and that it was not a delusion but an undeniable fact.\"You Yue, if you can possibly survive, you definitely should not take revenge for us. What we want to see the most, is you living a good life.\" \u2014 A warm voice sounded from the midst of the sea of flames. However, listening to this voice, Sima You Yue's heart began to hurt even more, and could not hold herself back from shouting out, \"Mother\u2026\u2026\"With just one call of 'mother', it immediately caused her pair of dry eyes to turn moist, and unstoppable tears fell unceasingly.It appeared that she had seen a beautiful face, lightly pasted upon her own face, which said while smiling, \" Look, this is our daughter, she really looks like you! She resembles the moon in the sky.\"\"Then we should call her You Yue.\" \u2014 A male voice sounded.\"Alright, silly girl, in the future you will be called Ximen You Yue. I'm your mother, your first word definitely needs to be 'mother'!\"Sima You Yue stretched out her hand, she wanted to touch that beautiful face. However, before she managed to touch her, that silhouette disappeared into the fire.\"Mother\u2026\u2026\"Ling Long sat on Sima You Yue's chest, looking at the tears that fell from her eyes, she said with her heart aching, \"Little Yue Yue, why are you crying? Little Yue Yue is really sad, her heart is hurting. Ling Long also wants to cry, sob sob\u2026\u2026\"Little Roar and Little Spirit also felt the pain in Sima You Yue's heart. Little Spirit did not know why, but Little Long guessed that she definitely saw some memories that happened in her past.\"Little Yue Yue, don't cry anymore, we will be here with you!\" Ling Long crawled on the top of Sima You Yue's head. She stretched forth her hand and wiped away the tears that that were in the corner of Sima You Yue's eyes.When Sima You Yue gently opened her eyes, the tears blurred her vision. Looking at the silhouette in front of her eyes that had, seemingly, not disappeared, she said softly, \"Mother, Yue Er really misses you\u2026\u2026\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

She turned her head and looked at the little child beside her and said hesitatingly, \"Ling Long?\"\"Ha, Little Yue Yue recognises me.\" Ling Long chirped happily as she clapped her hands.\"How have you turned into a child? And such a small one at that?\" Sima You Yue sat up and cupped Ling Long into her hands. She realised that she was merely around the the size of two fists.\"Of course, I am a Soul Weapon. I'm quite similar to Little Spirit, of course I'd be able to transform into a human.\" Ling Long said while laughing happily. \"However, I'm more powerful than that guy! I'm able to completely transform into one, but he's unable to. He can only waste away inside the Spirit Pearl. So, looking at just this one point, the one who is the most senior Supreme Artifact is me.\"\"Alright, both of you are very powerful.\" Sima You Yue quickly pacified the situation when she saw that Little Spirit was about to explode.\"Oh right, what did Little Yue Yue dream of just now? We immediately felt your pain, and it also hurt me greatly.\" Ling Long asked.\"Nothing much, it was just a few old memories.\" Sima You Yue said. \"Perhaps it's because I can now cultivate, so my memories are slowly coming back to me.\"Looking at how Sima You Yue was reluctant to divulge any information, n.o.body asked any further.Sima You Yue stood up. Looking at how she was still at the place that she fainted at earlier, the corner of her mouth arced and said, \"Couldn't you all have let me lie down on a bed or something? At least it would have been more comfortable.\"\"Too lazy to change location.\" Little Spirit said in a forceful and just manner. In a flash, he disappeared.\"I'm also too lazy to bicker with you any further, if not, you'll anger me to death.\" Sima You Yue did not look at Little Spirit and looked at Ling Long, who was in her hands, and asked, \"What kind of weapons can you turn into right now?\"\"I also have no idea.\" Ling Long shook her head as she said.\"Then let's try.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Alright.\" After saying this, Ling Long turned into a dagger and said, \"Master, let's begin.\"Sima You Yue thought of a few different types of weapons in her head. Aside from the initial double edged sword, none of the rest succeeded.After a while, Sima You Yue helplessly looked at the pot in her hands and bellowed with laughter, \"Hahaha, what kind of Supreme Artifact are you? Did you turn into a pot because you plan to help us cook some food?\"\"This time was a mistake.\" After saying this, Ling Long left Sima You Yue's hands and started to spin in midair. When it stopped spinning, the pot was missing and a spatula that was used to stir-fry vegetables appeared in front of everyone.Sima You Yue's initial hopefulness turned to disappointment. While looking at the spatula, the disappointment had turned into despair.It turns out that she had chanced upon another fraud item. It had said that it was so powerful but in the end, the result was too beautiful. She could no longer bear to look at it.Looking at Sima You Yue's expression, Ling Long turned into the dagger and said, \"Little Yue Yue, don't be disappointed. Although I can turn into many things, right now, it's also dependent on your own ability. The stronger you become, the more powerful a weapon I can turn into as well.\"This was basically saying, her current strength was only able to turn it into cooking utensils.Sima You Yue could feel the disappointment in Ling Long's words and picked it up and said, \"I will enable you to turn into extremely powerful weapons. In any case, I am unable to use these weapons right now. When I increase in strength, we will become stronger together!\"\"Mm! I believe in you, Little Yue Yue!\" Ling Long said confidently.\"Me too, I also want to become stronger together!\" Little Roar came over and said.Ling Long turned into a small child and stepped on Little Roar's face, roaring, \"Little Yue Yue and I are mutually encouraging each other right now, what did you run over for?!\"Sima You Yue looked at the fiery little lady, whose temperament had changed in a split second. For a moment, she was unable to figure out which one was the true Ling Long.Since the time that the Spirit Pearl had come out, it was now already sunset. It was lucky that they had no cla.s.ses in the afternoon or she would have been caught in the act by the scoundrel Feng Zhi Xing.Thinking about Feng Zhi Xing, she thought about Little Spirit's reminder. Did he really know that she could cultivate? Then why did he not expose her at that point? He obviously knew that she was a wastrel, but he willingly accepted her into his cla.s.s. Was it really because he was doing it on account of the princ.i.p.al and her grandfather?If he really had any motives towards her, she did not sense any malicious intent from him. Unless you're saying that he had concealed it so deeply. Furthermore she had been sensitive towards people ever since she was born. Feelings like maliciousness or kindness were very obvious to her; she had never mistaken these things before.So much so, that because of this, when she had carried out multiple missions with people from her organization before, she had managed to kill someone in revenge even during their betrayal.As a result, she could feel that Feng Zhi Xing held no malicious intentions towards her.Also, right now in the princ.i.p.al's office, Feng Zhi Xing who had just returned from outside was called over.\"Are you aware of the situation regarding your cla.s.s of students?\" The old princ.i.p.al looked at Feng Zhi Xing and asked.\"Are you talking about the challenge? I've heard about it.\" Feng Zhi Xing replied indifferently.\"What do you think about it?\" The old princ.i.p.al asked.\"Don't have any opinions, as long as she doesn't play their lives, anything goes.\" Feng Zhi Xing leaned on the chair and fiddled with his fingernail. He said, \"Furthermore, in the compet.i.tion, they are responsible for their own life and death, if any situation occurs, their two families won't be able to pin this on me.\"eh-The old princ.i.p.al almost choked when he heard Feng Zhi Xing's words and said, \"I'm asking about the situation where Sima You Yue triumphed over Meng Ting.\"\"So what if she's won over Meng Ting?\" Feng Zhi Xing said, \"This is not anything strange. That Meng Ting only closes the door and studies at home while Sima You Yue constantly gets into fights in the city. I think that it's due to his vast combat experience that he won.\"When the old princ.i.p.al heard about how Sima You Yue had triumphed over Meng Ting, he actually thought about whether or not he could have possibly been able to cultivate. If not, why would this scoundrel with such foresight accept a wastrel. However, listening to his explanation now, it was not like it was not a reasonable explanation. After all, during their fight, Sima You Yue had really not used any spirit power.Feng Zhi Xing saw the way the old princ.i.p.al's eyes darted around sneakily and guessed what he was thinking in his heart. However, he did not plan to say anything.\"Do you still have anything else? If not, I will make my move first. I have to bring them to choose a Spirit Beast Egg tomorrow and have to go back to prepare a bit.\"\"Yup, choosing a Spirit Beast Egg is a very important event for the students, you need to prepare properly. Have the Spirit Beast Eggs all been replenished?\" the old princ.i.p.al asked.\"They all arrived today. I expect that they've all been sent inside already.\" Feng Zhi Xing replied.\"Then you should go and prepare.\" The old princ.i.p.al said, \"remember to take note not to allow them into the house with the dead egg. If not, they would have wasted a chance unnecessarily.\"\"Since it's a dead egg, why don't you dispose of it?\" Feng Zhi Xing asked puzzledly.\"That was something that was pa.s.sed down a very long time ago, our custom in this school is not to touch that egg. I am also unaware of the reason why. However, there were many times in the past where a student who entered that house would always be very confused upon his return. As such, we thought that, despite it being a dead egg, it was still a rather unique place. So, we left it as it was.\"\"I understand.\" Feng Zhi Xing said, and left.At night, when He Qiu Zhi was walking around in the campus, a group of people blocked her path.\"Are you guys going to choose eggs tomorrow?\" That person asked.\"Yes.\" He Qiu Zhi replied.\"Very good. Help me with one thing, I will reward you well.\" That person said with a smile.\"What thing? You should let me listen to first.\"\"Help me eliminate Sima You Yue.\" That person said, \"Meng Ting has the support of her Meng family, what powers do you have to protect you? If she finds out that you've instigated Meng Ting into challenging her\u2026\u2026\"\"I'll do it!\" He Qui Zhi answered nervously and thought about it for awhile and asked: \"How do you want me to do it?\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Hence tonight, the table was full of various dishes.Fatty Qu didn\u2019t need anyone to call him over, he had followed the waft of fragrant food trail and ran over himself. Very soon, Wei Zi Qi had also ran over on his own.\"Have a look and see if Bei Gong Tang and Ouyang Fei are in. If they are, ask them to join us.\" Sima You Yue who was still cooking at the side shouted over to Fatty Qu.\"Alright!\" Fatty Qu stole a mouthful of food before he headed off.Wei Zi Qi originally thought that even if Bei Gong Tang and Ouyang Fei were in, they wouldn\u2019t come. To his surprise, both of them had appeared in front of the table.\"Both of you actually turned up. What a miracle!\"Bei Gong Tang shot a glance at Wei Zi Qi, before was.h.i.+ng her hands and sitting down by the table.

By this time, Little Roar had already finished eating and had went outside for a walk.\"Since we all live in the same courtyard, we should interact more with each other. See? Having a meal together is very nice as well.\" Fatty Qu said.\"Can you cook?\" Bei Gong Tang asked coldly.\"No.\" Fatty Au answered very seriously, but he turned and laughed out loud. \"Don\u2019t we have You Yue with us?\"Sima You Yue looked at him coldly but didn\u2019t object.\"Tomorrow is day of the Spirit Beast Egg Selection.\" Ouyang Fei interjected.\"Spirit Beast Egg Selection? Hmm? What\u2019s that?\" Hearing this for the time, Sima You Yue asked.\"Spirit Masters can contract their own Spirit Beasts, you should know this as well?\" Fatty Qu said.She nodded.\"In general, Spirit Masters and Spirit Beasts contracts have their limitations. The stronger the Spirit Master, the more Spirit Beasts they can contract with. Students like us who have just initially stepped into the world of Spirit Masters are only able to establish a contract with one Spirit Beast. However, with a Spirit Beast Egg, it\u2019s a totally different story. Some students don\u2019t have distinguished family backgrounds and have never contracted any Spirit Beasts prior to this. So upon selecting a Spirit Beast Egg during this selection, they are able to choose their own Spirit Beast to establish a contract with. However for those students who already have a Spirit Beast contract, with a Spirit Beast Egg, it doesn\u2019t take too much Spiritual Energy and they can also establish another contract.\" Wei Zi Qi patiently explained.Sima You Yue nodded yet again with an enlightened expression. \"So it\u2019s a gift from the Academy to the students\u2026\"\"You can put it that way too, but you still have to pay attention to certain aspects of this Spirit Beast Egg Selection.\"\"Pay attention to certain aspects?\"\"The Spirit Beast Eggs are also have their own grades, they have high and Low level grades. Although the odds are relatively Low, but if you are able to select a high level grade egg, in the future, when it's out,you'll be contracted to a stronger and more powerful Spirit Beast.\"Sima You Yue bit on her chopsticks and asked: \"why are they all in eggs? What about those mammals?\"\"Those mammals are also kept in the Spirit Beast Eggs, it\u2019s just that the eggs are illusionary.\" Wei Zi Qi added. \"I\u2019ve heard that these Spirit Eggs are from a very mystical place. No matter what animal it is, you can only see an egg. Furthermore, all the eggs have exactly the same appearance. If the egg you chose has a mammal in it, the egg will disappear.\"\"That has got to be some trick behind it. Or else why do all the eggs look exactly the same? What is the reason behind it?\" Sima You Yue asked as she began a.n.a.lysing.When Beigong Tang heard this, she looked up at her.\"Anyway, tomorrow is a day worth looking forward to.\" Fatty Qu said.\"You should already have one Spirit Beast contracted before this, what are you still looking forward to?\" Sima You Yue chided.\"That is not the same, I heard that there are some Spirit Beast Eggs with Divine Ranked Spirit Beast lineage mixed in! If I were to select one, next time wouldn\u2019t I be very powerful? Hahahaha!\" Fatty Qu puffed his chest up as he said in antic.i.p.ation.\"Stop daydreaming.\" Sima You Yue retorted.\"Even if you did not choose one from a Divine Spirit Beast lineage, no matter what, as long as its chosen by the Academy, there\u2019s a chance that\u2019s it\u2019s more rare and powerful.\"Really so? Now I\u2019m really excited for tomorrow! Hahaha!\"The next day, Bei Gong Tang and Ouyang Fei also joined in for breakfast. Fortunately, all the food preparation had been done by Little Spirit so all she needed to do was to cook.After breakfast, they headed to the cla.s.sroom.Once she stepped in, Sima You Yue could feel that everyone\u2019s gazed were fixed on her. There were various emotions mixed in, those of disdain, surprise, curiosity and anger. It seems that winning the challenge yesterday\u2019s had set off a small storm.Meng Ting was still seething in anger but she had no choice and could only leave her alone and throw her dagger stares at best.Sima You Yue and Bei Gong Tang both walked to their seats and sat down, totally ignoring the people around. Bei Gong Tang was just distant and cold. As for Sima You Yue, she was simply too lazy to bother about these matters.Soon, Feng Zhi Xing came into the cla.s.sroom and saw that everyone was in cla.s.s. \"You all know what day it is today, before we head off, just want to brief you on some things to note.\"\"The place where the Spirit Beast Eggs are stored at one of the mountains behind the Academy. There are a total of four doors and you can go into three of them. When you enter them, there will be an illusion and you will see many Spirit Beast Eggs. Each of them look exactly the same so you can only use your own instinct and sense to choose that one egg for yourself. Select the one that you want most and once you've chosen it, you will be sent out. Now, follow me and we'll head over for the Spirit Beast Egg Selection.\"The students started chattering excitedly and followed him out. When Sima You Yue walked past He Qiu Zhi, he stared at her with a gaze full of menace. When she turned her head, he swiftly retracted the gaze and acted as if nothing happened.Feng Zhi Xing led them towards the mountain and when they arrived, the other cla.s.ses had already gathered and the other teachers were chatting away leisurely together.Sima You Yue noticed that the gazes from those teachers were filled with respect when they looked over at Feng Zhi Xing.\"Is everyone here?\" Feng Zhi Xing walked over to the group of teachers and asked.\"Yes, everyone had a.s.sembled earlier, your cla.s.s is the last to arrive.\" One teacher answered.\"Let's go in then.\" Feng Zhi Xing simply ignored that teacher's snide remarks.This year, the number of Spirit Masters that were enrolled were not that many, there were only about a thousand students. Other than the special cla.s.s, there was also the unique cla.s.s of the Beast Tamers and Alchemists. The ordinary cla.s.s had around nine hundred students. The entrances to the caves were relatively narrow hence, the students were split into three groups and entered in batches.The students felt that if they entered at the end, it wouldn't be fair to them as the better eggs would have already been chosen. A teacher raised his hands up and the incessant clamouring hushed up at once and he spoke out: \"The Spirit Beast Eggs placed inside are all randomly placed, so the rate for success is also split up. It doesn't matter which order you enter in, come, first batch to enter now.\"In accordance with the order of arrival, the students all went into their a.s.signed batch. As Feng Zhi Xing's group was the last to arrive, they went in as the last batch.As soon as Sima You Yue arrived at this mountain, she had a faint feeling that something was calling her. She felt drawn to a gentle voice that said: \"Come\u2026come here\u2026\"She looked around and did not find anything unusual and she tried to listen out for that voice again but she heard nothing.\"That's strange\u2026\" She muttered in her heart. It was finally her team's turn and she pushed it to the back of her mind as she followed her team to enter the cave.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Remember, once you've selected a Spirit Beast Egg, you'll immediately be sent out. There is no second chance, so you must grasp hold of your own opportunity and not waste this chance and choose the one you want the most.\" Another teacher added.\"You can only go through these three teleportation arrays, you cannot go to the fourth . Whoever goes to the fourth will be responsible for their own actions. If you encounter any problems, it\u2019s going to be your own responsibility.\" The first teacher stressed on this point.\"Teacher, is every teleportation array the same?\"\"They are all the same, they will randomly send you to the location for your Spirit Beast Egg selection. Alright, spread out now, don't crowd around and choose which array you want to enter from.\"After the teacher finished, everyone rushed forward to the arrays. Although the teachers had explained beforehand that everything was random and chances were all similar, they still felt that entering faster would still be a key factor in securing the best Spirit Beast Egg. Soon, some students had already disappeared upon activating the teleportation array.When the other students saw this, they got more excited and soon everyone was rus.h.i.+ng forward in a frenzy.Sima You Yue was also forced to move forward and she was shoved and nudged and soon found herself close to the innermost array. This was also the fourth teleportation array which the teachers have repeatedly stressed that no one was to go to. Everyone also felt that there were no Spirit Beast Eggs inside so they also did not go near it.That teleportation was not lit up and had been closed, however when Sima You Yue gave a casual glance at it, she thought she saw two faint flashes of light.\"Come \u2026come\u2026\"Sima You Yue heard that voice calling again and she froze. At this moment, she felt someone push her from behind and before she knew it, she was already standing above the fourth teleportation array.At this time, the teleportation array emitted a dazzling red light. Sima You Yue quickly turned her body around and she was surprised to see He Qiu Zhi looking at her with eyes filled with hatred and grinning maliciously.\"You\u2026!' before she had the chance to say anything else. She disappeared into the red light.One of the teachers who was nearby was shocked when he saw a red light flash and he shouted out in a panic: \"Who! Who was it that entered the fourth teleportation array?!\"There were only around half the initial number of students who had yet to enter the teleportation array and they looked at each other with a puzzled expression on, wondering what was wrong with the teacher.\"Teacher, I think it was Sima You Yue from the elite cla.s.s that entered it.\" Someone said.\"Sima You Yue? Oh, alright, continue on.\" said the teacher.Since it was that waste, then there was nothing to worry about.In order to prevent a similar occurrence, all the students began to enter the teleportation array in an orderly manner.Feng Zhi Xing had been outside the cave all this while but when he saw the flash of red light, he had a bad premonition.He entered the cave and immediately asked: \"Who was it that activated the fourth teleportation array?\"\"It's your student, Sima You Yue.\" One of the teachers answered, \"Most probably, he was squeezed over during the chaos just now.\"\"What?!\" Feng Zhi Xing's heart missed two beats, asked: \"Isn't inside\u2026\"\"Master Feng, once that student enters and realize that there are no Spirit Beast Eggs, he will come out very soon. There's no need to be so anxious. Anyway there's nothing you can do at this point, no need to be so worried.\"\"Yes, although the Academy hasn't opened the fourth teleportation array, it shouldn't have any problems.\"No problems? How can it be?Yesterday, the old princ.i.p.al had told him that the students who had entered before came back all delirious and meridians were destroyed, their whole future ended just like that. You call this no problem?In fact, the old princ.i.p.al didn't mention that some of those students who had entered, had never made it out.\"Master Feng, you are a new teacher, so you do not understand this. We have been here for so many years, these matters we're most clear about it, there's absolutely no problems.\" Another teacher added. \"Those stories about those students that entered before were just rumours, your student will be fine.\"\"No, I have to go in.\" All the comforting words the other teachers gave him were simply brushed off as he rushed straight to the fourth teleportation array. However, no matter how much Spiritual Qi he put in, the teleportation didn't activate. There wasn't the slightest reaction from the array.By this time, almost all the students had entered the three teleportation arrays. When the teachers saw Feng Zhi Xing rush to the fourth teleportation array, they were all shocked silly, but calmed down once they saw that it didn't activate.\"Master Feng, this teleportation array is very mysterious, not everyone can use it. You're better off just waiting here.\"He stepped out and looked at the teleportation array for a moment more before turning back and he headed straight to the princ.i.p.al's office.Although this teleportation array look similar to the others, if one looked at it carefully, there were some differences. Maybe the princ.i.p.al had a way on entering it.However, the princ.i.p.al's answer shattered all his hope.\"That teleportation array has been there since the beginning of our Imperial Academy. It was initially a forbidden area that was cordoned off, only after they started with the Spirit Beast Egg selections, only then were the three other teleportation arrays added in. That particular teleportation array only activates when it recognizes that person.\"It? What do you mean?\"\"I myself do not know, these were all handed down from my predecessors. There were no other explanations, other than the dead egg, there are other things in there which is why the students that have entered before all came back that way.\" The princ.i.p.al sighed.\"Is there no other way to enter?\" Feng Zhi Xing slammed both his fists down on the table as he asked anxiously.The princ.i.p.al could only shake his head helplessly. When he saw this, Feng Zhi Xing fell back to his chair and slumped back in stupor.The princ.i.p.al was perplexed as he looked at Feng Zhi Xing's reaction. Since when did this guy ever show such an expression? His impression of Feng Zhi Xing was that he was cold,detached and had no emotions like a normal person.\"I will wait there.\" Afterwhich, he turned and left.When he was went back, many students had already selected their Spirit Beast Eggs and were excitedly holding onto their eggs.He fixated his eyes worriedly over the fourth teleportation array and kept repeating to himself: \"You You, you have to come out safely\"Sima You Yue felt her surroundings disappear and felt light headed and her mind go blank. Before she could gather her thoughts, she felt her body land softly on the ground.\"Urghh! d.a.m.n it!\" She got up and dusted herself as she surveyed her surroundings. Luckily she had landed on a thick bed of leaves that cus.h.i.+oned her fall.\"d.a.m.n it, dare to scheme against me?! Hmph! You better not let me find you or else!\" She swore in the air angrily.She swept away all the gra.s.s and leaves that were stuck on her and looked around the thick foliage that surrounded her. Didn't they say that they would be sent to select the Spirit Beast Eggs, why had she appeared in a forest instead?Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31: \"Imprisoned Within an Array\"Sima You Yue took a good look around to see where she was. All she could see was an impenetrable wall of bamboo seemingly reaching the skies. Each shoot of bamboo appeared to radiate a faint green glow and the ground was covered by a thick layer of dead leaves. How did she end up in this bamboo forest?She came before a bamboo stem and stretched out her hand to touch it. A brisk chill lingered upon her fingertips, as if the thing that she had touched was a giant ice cube.\"So cold!\" She felt as if her fingers had been frozen, to the point where she could no longer feel them, and immediately retracted her hand.She wandered about in a circle and realized that this forest was ridiculously huge. She had already walked about for a good half hour, but she was still lost within the bamboo forest.\"What the heck is this place? Don't tell me it's a fantasy world, or else, why would these bamboos and rocks feel so realistic?\" She sat her b.u.t.t down on a piece of rock, and started to pound on her weary legs. \"This body is also too weak, I've only walked about for a little while but it's already so tired. It's just too different from my previous life. If I ever have to battle anyone in the future, this would definitely be too disadvantageous! It looks like I'll have to exercise more in the future.\"After resting for a little while, she continued to meander around the forest. She hadn't even caught a glimpse of a single living thing, much less a Spirit Beast Egg.\"d.a.m.n, what kind of G.o.dforsaken place is this?! Didn't they say that you just had to find a Spirit Beast Egg and leave? But this place doesn't even have a single egg, how am I supposed to look for it!\" Sima You Yue kicked a bamboo leaf that was sticking out that she was facing. Who would have thought that there was something under the leaf and it tumbled and rolled to her feet.\"A human skull?!\" Looking closely at the white skull that had flew out in front, Sima You Yue immediately burst forth with killing intent. She had only realized at this point that the place in which she was standing had a few footprints.She lowered her head to take a look. Because she had just exerted a bit of force, she had kicked away quite a number leaves that were under her. Aside from the skull, which was recently kicked aside, there were still numerous bones scattered around her.She retreated backwards by a couple of steps and stepped down from atop the skeleton. The leaves had all been scattered, clearly revealing the entirety of skeleton.\"The skeleton has no signs of scarring. It looks as if this person had not encountered any external danger prior to his death.\" Scrutinising it once more, she thought about how she had already circled more than halfway around the entire forest. She asked in confusion, \"Could it be that this person died of starvation or dehydration?\"\"Master, this is an array.\" Little Spirit's voice answered in reply.\"An array? I think that someone had mentioned that this place contained an Illusion Array and it makes everything look the same, in order to let everyone see everything in front of them as the Spirit Beast Eggs.\" Sima You Yue said.\"The one you're talking about is an illusion array. This array is not an Illusion Array. It's actually\u2026\u2026 a Mystical Array.\" Little Spirit said.\"A Mystical Array? What kind of array is that?\" Asked Sima You Yue.\"It's a array that causes people to lose their way.\" Explained Little Spirit. \"The reason that you got lost is also because of this Mystical Array. This caused you to become increasingly anxious. You couldn't even hear me although I had called out to you a few times just now.\"\"You called out to me just now? Since I could not hear anything just moments ago, how come I can hear it now? Could it be that the array was broken?\" Sima You Yue thought about how she had indeed felt increasingly muddled just now that was nothing like her usual calm and she suddenly felt a wave of the after-shock.\"You just happened to kick a skull, that managed to jolt your consciousness that stimulated your brain for a moment, which allowed me to take advantage of the opportunity to b.u.t.t in.\" Little Spirit said.\"This array is really scary, why would the Academy erect this kind of array?\" Sima You Yue asked in bewilderment.\"This is not the right time for you to be thinking about this. If you wish to live, you need to think of a way to dispel this array, or you will have to stay here forever with no means of getting out.\" Little Spirit roared.\"This must be the reason why that person had been trapped here until he died.\" Sima You Yue said, \"Little Spirit, since you know about this array, are you able to dispel it?\"\"I'm not an Array Master, how would I know how to dispel it?\" Said Little Spirit.\"If you're not an Array Master, how would you know about the Mystical Array?\" Asked Sima You Yue.\"Does everyone who knows how to eat, know how to cook?!\" Little Spirit said in disdain, \"Even if you've never eaten pork, you've seen a pig run.\"\"Uh..You don't know how to dispel the Array, and neither do I. What now?\"\"Fishsticks[1]!\"\" Yue Yue, umm, I know what to do?\" Little Roar interrupted.Sima You Yue reacted to Little Roar's shout, and asked, \"What?\"\"In the past, you had a brother who was a super powerful Array Master. I once heard him mention that this type of array could be broken in two circ.u.mstances. One way was by following a specific method, the other was by going completely against it.\"\"Following it? Against it?\"\"Yes, following it requires you to be aware of the array's motion pattern and undoing it step by step. This method doesn't dispel the array and the people inside the array will also get hurt.\" Little Roar said.\"This method is impossible, we don't even know the array. Tell us about the next method.\" Sima You Yue said.\"The method that goes against is a very simple one.\" Little Roar said, \"Your brother once said that every Array has a core. As long as we can locate that core and take it away, we will be able to dispel the Array.\"\"This solution is simple!\" Sima You Yue started to look around in all directions, in order to locate the core of this Array.\"I haven't finished talking!\" Little Roar snapped. \"Although this method of going against it is simple, once you destroy the core, the entire array will collapse. Every array collapses in a different way. Some shatter like ice, without causing any harm to the people in the array, but there are those that explode like a bomb, wounding or even killing the people inside. It really depends on how the the owner has set up the Array.\"\"What the h.e.l.l, that's so dangerous!\" Sima You Yue uttered in despair.\"That's right, so a majority of the people won't choose the second option.\" Little Roar explained.Sima You Yue pondered over it for a moment and said, \"There's nothing I can do even if it's really going to explode. I don't know how to execute the method of following it and only know how to go against. There's still a possibility of survival if I take the method that goes against it. If I don't understand it then there's only the option of death.\"\"It seems that way. We should go out together and search for that core.\" Little Roar flew towards Sima You Yue's head and lay down, using his big round eyes to search everywhere diligently.\"To begin with, the core is already not easy to locate. Furthermore, this array is so big, if we want to locate its core, it's worse than looking for a needle in a haystack. It's not even as easy as that!\" Little Spirit lamented.\"We still have to look for it.\" Sima You Yue shrugged, \"This is the only option we have right now. Anyway, we have some food and drinks, so we won't die even if we can't leave this place. What we have now is time and we can use it up slowly.\"Little Spirit remained silent while Sima You Yue and Little Roar continued to look for the array core together.When she was hungry, she went inside the Spirit Pearl to cook. When she was thirsty, she went into the Spirit Pearl to get some water to drink. When she was sleepy, she also went inside the Spirit Pearl to sleep. Actually, she had decided to sleep inside the forest, but Little Spirit said that one's consciousness would be weaker after they had fallen asleep. If she once again became muddled as a result of the array, it was uncertain whether or not she would be able to awake from it once again.She did not know how long she had spent walking around in the forest since it was always dark inside, except for that bit of green luminesce. Although the sky did not darken, she had already eaten 7 meals and slept an entire sleep cycle so 2 or 3 days should have pa.s.sed already.\"Yue Yue, it is impossible to discern where this array core is located!\" They were completely unable to locate the array core and Little Roar's entire person looked as if he was in despair, as he climbed to the top of Sima You Yue's shoulder.\"We will find it eventually.\" Sima You Yue was also a bit discouraged. Aside from bamboo, this forest only had bamboo. Furthermore, during their search, they had even uncovered 2 more skeletons.\"Continuing this blind search is also not a good method.\" She halted her steps and said, \"Since it is a core, it definitely has to have some kind of law it has to follow or some unique characteristic. Let us first examine at this carefully before continuing.\"After saying this, she sat down atop a piece of large rock, scrutinising the Bamboo and fallen leaves on the ground.[1] a nonsensical replyCan't wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslated by SocksrockerChapter 32: \"Dispelling the Array\"Little Roar had originally intended to say something, however, looking at Sima You Yue's intense dedication, the words that were on the tip of his tongue were forced back down. He decided to involve himself in looking around the surroundings to see if there was anything that resembled the array core.\"This place is really too weird. There isn't even any sun, where is this light even coming from?\" Little Roar inquired, as he stood alone on top of a stick of bamboo, and looked at how the light that was coming off the bamboo turned his pure white fur, green.Light?Sima You Yue heard what Little Roar had said; a miraculous radiation of light. These bamboos were freely giving off light, this meant that these bamboo were one and the same. If they could find a bamboo that did not give off any light, it was possible that that bamboo was actually the array core!\"Ha, Little Roar, let's look for a bamboo that doesn't give off light!\" She said, facing Little Roar who was behind her, as stood up and patted off the leaves that had fallen on her body.\"A bamboo that doesn't give off light? Why would we look for that?\" Little Roar asked as he flew over.\"It's possible that it is the array core.\" Sima You Yue explained, \"Anyway, let's just look for it together.\"\"Okay.\"As such, the both of them wandered around the forest once again. This time, looking for a bamboo that did not give off any light; their goal was obvious in but a moment.\"\"Master, I can feel it.\" A very silent Little Spirit suddenly voiced out.\"Little Spirit, what do you feel?\" Sima You Yue said, as she halted her steps.\"This place contains the aura of a Spirit Stone.\" Little Spirit replied.\" Spirit stone, is it a stone that's similar to you?\" Asked Sima You Yue.\"How could you possibly compare that kind of thing to me. I'm a Sacred Spirit Stone you know, there's only one of me in the entire universe. I can be tempered into a Spirit Pearl and can contain the heaven and earth, while those kind of dregs can only be used to raise some varieties of spirits, at most. It's impossible for them to support life.\" Little Spirit said proudly.\"Then what are you so worked up for?\"\"Are you stupid! While this may be a Mystical Array, although it has been set up with the methods of an array, in fact this array core is useful for things related to spirits. It is only in this way that they formation would reach it's peak potential.\" Little Spirit said.\"So you're saying that it's possible that the Spirit Stone could be the location of the formation core.\" Sima You Yue said a little agitatedly.\"Hmph, it's a good thing you're not that stupid.\" Little Spirit replied.\"Since you can feel its aura, are you able to pinpoint its specific location?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"If I was on the outside of the array, I would be able to directly search for it. However, this is the inside of the array. I can only feel that it's close by, within a range of 50 metres. You can look for it yourself.\" After Little Spirit finished saying this, he refused to utter another word.Sima You Yue looked around. This segment of bamboo was not very dense. Compared to other areas, this place was relatively spa.r.s.e.She scrutinised every single stalk of bamboo and saw that every single one was glowing. There wasn't even a single stalk that fit with the description that she had.\"Could it be that my speculation was wrong?\" Sima You Yue touched her chin, doubting her own idea.\"Yue Yue, maybe the array core doesn't lie within the bamboo.\" Little Roar offered.\"Not the bamboo?\"\"Yup, if the formation core really is the Spirit Stone, it will probably continue to resemble a stone, right.\" Little Roar postulated.\"Ha, that's possible. Let us look over the stones one again.\" Sima You Yue hugged Little Roar; man and beast deciding to look over each little stone one by one. However, this place didn't even contain a single pebble.Looking at the only large rock in this entire place, Sima You Yue finally set her sights upon it.\"Could this be it?\" She walked towards the stone and walked 2 circles around it. She felt that this stone appeared a little different from the one just now. She stretched out her hand to touch it and it had a similar chill to the bamboo.\"Yue Yue, is this it?\" Little Roar flew over to ask.\"Nope.\" Sima You Yue said. \"If this was the array core, it would be a real item and would not have the same kind of ice-cold chill that the bamboo has.\"\"So, the core is also not here?\" Little Roar said with a little disappointment.\"No, it is here.\" Sima You Yue said confidently, \"Are you able to kick this rock away?\"\"Piece of cake.\" Little Roar flew over to the top of the rock and tapped on it lightly with his little leg. The humongous rock was sent flying.Sima You Yue looked at the bottom of the rock that was sent flying. It had a very black stone, which was around the size of a child's fist.\"Is this it?\" Sima You Yue squat down and looked at that black stone. \"Do we just have to take this away? We don't know whether or not there's be an explosion, but I don't care. Even if a horse is dying, you still have to send it to the doctor.\"After saying this, she threw the little white ball into the Spirit Pearl and let out a breath. She stretched out her hand and grabbed on to the piece of Spirit Stone.\"Whoosh, whoosh-\"The quiet bamboo forest was interrupted by a sudden gust of wind that came from all sides as the ground looked like it was going to rip itself apart and shook incessantly.\"Bang-\"Sima You Yue was unable to open her eyes because of the strong wind. She used the stone that she was grasping in her hands to block in front of her, however, she was unable to block the force of the wind.\"\"Rumble-\"The ground suddenly split apart and the crack rapidly enlarged. The leaves and bamboo all tumbled in indiscriminately.\"I'll go-\" as she was falling into the crack, Sima You Yue held onto the stone in her hands, and attempted to suppress the panic in her heart.Her blood flowed into the stone and Sima You Yue and Sima You Yue felt a burst of pain spread out from her palms, towards the rest of her body and all her bones, causing her to pa.s.s out. Just before she fainted, she only had one thought. If the ground were to join back together, would she be flattened into minced meat?Her consciousness faded away, and she did not know how long she had spent in that darkness. As her consciousness slowly started to recover, she opened her eyes and realised that she was currently within a canyon. There was a thick meadow underneath her and her clothes were clean. The dirt that was on her body just now when the earth broke apart was generally gone.She sat up and rubbed her head that was in a bit of pain. She was a little suspicious of whether or not her current situation was one of a dream.\"Hiss-\"A burst of pain came from the palm of her hand and she opened up her palm. She saw that there were some scars on the palm of her hands and the wounds had not yet completely closed up. As a result of her movements just now, they had reopened.\"Looks like this isn't a dream.\" She took out her knife and cut off a part of the hem of her skirt to wrap her hand, using her mouth and left hand to tie a knot.After finis.h.i.+ng this, she began to inspect the canyon.Similar to the Bamboo forest just now, there were not any living creatures. There was not even a shadow of a Spirit Beast Egg, just as before. The difference was that the place just now consisted entirely of a bamboo forest, but this place had many different types of flowers, plants and trees.\"Could it be that I entered another array from that array?\" Sima You Yue was puzzled.\"It shouldn't be. I don't feel any aura of an array.\" Little Spirit said.\"No array? Didn't you say that this place contained multiple Illusion Arrays?\"\"Nope, this is the real world.\" Little Spirit a.s.serted.\"Then how do we go back? This place isn't within an array and looking for a Spirit Beast Egg is not longer the method for sending us back out.\" Sima You Yue said with a little bit of headache. \"Oh right, the Spirit Stone just now. Do you know where it has disappeared to?\"\"It's with me.\" Little Spirit said. His mood was a little bad.Sima You Yue felt that something was not right and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\"There's something strange about this item. I'll tell you about it when you get out of this place.\" Little Spirit said.\"I'll go look for a route out first, then.\" Sima You Yue replied.She walked towards the canyon and suddenly heard the same call from before.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Seeing her odd behaviour, he asked: \"Yue Yue, what happened?\"\"Did you hear that?\" She asked.\"Hear what? There's only the rustling of leaves, what are you talking about?\" Little Roar froze and perked his ears up, fully focused on picking up any sounds. No matter how hard he focused, he didn't hear anything!\"There is.\" She affirmed and ran forward quickly and finally stopped in front of a cave.\"Yue Yue, how did you know there was a cave here?\" Little Roar flew to her side and looked at the dark cave entrance.\"I did not, it was the voice that led me here.\" She answered truthfully.\"What's inside?\" Little Roar asked.\"I don't know, well, once we go in then we'll know.\" Sima You Yue picked up a piece of broken branch on the ground and lit it up and she entered the dark cave cautiously with Little Roar, with the torch in hand.The deeper they went in, the higher the temperature rose. It became so hot to the point that it was they felt as if they were being cooked alive.\"Yue Yue! It's too hot in here!\" Little Roar could not take it any longer. The him who usually didn't work up any sweat was now drenched in it, and his fur clumped up with his sweat dripping down profusely.When she saw the severity of the state he was in, she quickly sent him into the Spirit Pearl as she walked deeper into the cave alone.Because the temperature was too high, the entire torch burnt out quickly but luckily, she had reached a stone chamber before the flame extinguished.She dug around the interspatial ring her cheap dad gave her and retrieved a night pearl from it. When she held it in her hands, her surroundings lit up and she could see much clearer.She had initially walked close to the walls of the cave which had finally led her to this stone chamber. Now that the night pearl had illuminated the place, she could see that the wall was actually red. Although she still maintained some distance from the walls, she could feel the heat that it was radiating out.\"What place is this? Such a rich fire Spiritual Qi! If I were to cultivate here, I wonder how many levels I can increase?\" She closed her eyes and sensed the dense red little dots dancing around, and surrounded her, as if wrapping her in a layer of aura.\"It's actually much more than what I have inside!\" She exclaimed. \"Master, this is an absolutely good opportunity for you! There's no need to hurry out, stay here and cultivate first. This place is extremely favourable to you, it would definitely increase your cultivation by leaps and bounds.\" Little Spirit quickly voiced out.\"I'll have a look around this stone chamber first before I start then.\" She was also excited when presented with such a great opportunity. Maybe she'll be an expert when she leaves this cave!Before she entered, she saw that there was something placed in the middle of the stone chamber. She could only make out a vague shape then but there wasn't enough light to see what it was.When she walked closer, she cried out: \"Spirit Beast Egg!\"Suddenly, the egg emitted flashes of resplendent red lights and the sudden glare made her s.h.i.+eld her eyes with her arm.After the dazzling flashes of red light dispersed, the egg emitted a faint red glow which illuminated the entire stone chamber.She could see the room in it's entirety and saw that this stone chamber had nothing else other than the Spirit Beast Egg. The egg reached up to her chest and she could not put her arms around the whole egg.The Spirit Beast Egg had a beautiful pattern resembling a flame on it and it left her fascinated, and she could not help but reach out to touch it.Prior to entering the cave, the cloth that was initially tied to her right hand was removed as it was too hot. When her hand touched the egg, her whole palm seemed to have been stuck to the eggsh.e.l.l.The temperature of the egg suddenly rose and she could feel an excruciating burning sensation from her palm, almost seemingly a barbecue smell wafted in the air.She wanted to retract her hand but she felt as if her blood and strength were flowing out of her body from her palm. She could only helplessly stand there, watching her blood flow out and formed various lines and runes and soon, the whole egg was surrounded by some strange inscriptions, eventually disappearing into the egg.\"With thy blood, held within my body, thou shalt henceforth be joined, life and death are one. By the glory of this vow of contract, illuminate the lands. Human, wouldst thou be willing to embrace and be bound to me by this contract?\"Just as she was about to faint, an archaic voice resounded and that kept her awake.The pain was so severe to the point that she was trembling non stop, her teeth was chattering and her mind almost blanked out. Hearing the oppressive voice, she wanted to speak out but no sound came out.\"Are thou willing?\" When the voice did not hear her answer, it asked again.\"I\u2026am..willing\u2026\" She gritted her teeth and squeezed out these three words, after mustering all her strength.Beneath her feet, an array which comprised of a pentagram and some ancient runes appeared. A silvery white light wrapped around both the egg and her and no longer felt any pain. A comfortable warmth embraced her and it was a if she was soaked in warm water and she felt it wash away all her pain and a rejuvenate her.The pentagram slowly narrowed and condensed into two flashes of silvery white light. One flash flew into her chest while the other flash of light flew into the egg, concluding the establishment of the contract.She touched her chest and could feel that she was linked to the Spirit Beast Egg in front of her.She had actually established a contract just like that?Before she had the time to think further, she felt an influx of Spiritual Energy and the Spiritual Energy in her body suddenly grew.At her foot, a small star appeared, symbolizing her Spiritual Power had increased and showing her level.While she was still stunned, the small star quickly increased, from one to two, two to three and it quickly increased to nine stars when it suddenly condensed again and eventually a moon and a small star appeared.That small star glowed again and it was as if another star was going to appear but the light dimmed and it finally stopped.\"Spirit Lord! First grade Spirit Lord!\" Sima You cried out in surprise when she saw the moon and star by her feet. Even after the lights had all disappeared, she was still frozen in stupor.She had heard before that establis.h.i.+ng contracts with Spirit Beasts would increase their own strengths but she did not expect such an outcome. She didn't think that establis.h.i.+ng a contract with a Spirit Beast, well in her case it was establis.h.i.+ng a contract by a Spirit Beast, would actually trigger off such a big increase in level!\"This promotion was just like drinking water!\" She couldn't help but exclaim.\"Yue Yue, that's because it's not the usual average Spirit Beast that you've established a contract with!\" Little Roar who had witnessed everything from the Spirit Pearl explained. \"That's because, the greater the power of the contract and the higher the level of the Spirit Beast, would result with the greater the Spirit Energy the Spirit Master can attain. The Spirit Beast that you've contracted to must have a very pure lineage from a great background.\"\"That's strange.\" Little Spirit said.\"Why? What's strange?\"\"I didn't feel any signs of life when you entered, that is to say that egg should have been a dead egg.\" Little Spirit answered as he explained his a.n.a.lysis out in a befuddled manner. \"However, the moment your blood touched it, it was as if it had awakened in an instant.\"\"Really? There was such a thing?\" Sima You Yue looked at the egg and tried to feel through their link to ascertain that this was indeed alive. Didn't that archaic voice belong to the Spirit Beast within the egg?\"I'm very sure.\" Little Spirit answered solemnly. \"This Spirit Beast Egg doesn't look like it's just been placed here, it should have been around for a long time. If it wasn't a dead egg before, I think perhaps your promotion would have even been greater.\"At this time, the Spirit Beast Egg suddenly moved a bit and Sima You Yue thought that it was about to hatch when it suddenly just flew straight into her body.\"Hiss-\"When the egg went into her body, she felt as if she was cloaked in fire and she felt as if her whole body was ablaze.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 34: \"Nirvana Fire\"The fire that cloaked Sima You Yue lit up the entire stone chamber, bright as day, as she felt her meridians and bones burning.However, this was a different burning sensation to her palm, although her whole body was wrapped in flames, the flames seem to be part of her body and the flames danced brilliantly on every single part of her body.All the impurities in her meridians were incinerated and now, she could feel that her meridians were all free of impurities and not only that, she could also clearly feel that her once narrow meridians had widened significantly!With widened meridians, it also meant that her cultivation would increase at a much paster pace as more Spiritual Qi could be absorbed! In addition to her wider meridians, her bones and flesh seemed to be much tougher and stronger than before!She crumbled to the ground as the intense pain gnawed at her bones and flesh while her meridians were expanding and impurities burnt away. She rolled on the floor, trying to alleviate the pain as time slowly ticked by. No matter how painful it was, she stubbornly clenched her teeth together, refusing to utter a single sound of pain.Each time her body expelled some black sticky fluid, the fire would then incinerate it.This process kept repeating itself until the pain became dull and she only felt numb.\"Nothing will happen to Yue Yue, right?\" Little Roar was extremely worried, looking at this scene from within the Spirit Pearl.\"Nothing will happen to her, she will definitely make it.\" Little Spirit affirmed emotionally.He had always thought of Sima You Yue as a small girl that had just embarked on the path to cultivation and didn't think she she held such tenacity. Despite the excruciating pain that she was going through, she didn't utter a single sound. They could understand the torturous pain that she was going through as they shared a link through their contract.Little Spirit was shocked and in awe. However much pain and torment she was going through, , her eyes held a strong and unwavering will of determination. Such people were meant for great things. He started to antic.i.p.ate what her future would be.\"Hah! I told you Little Yue Yue is very amazing!\" Ling Long was leisurely lying atop Little Roar with her hands beneath her head, not at all worried.For someone who could understand the depths of her soul, would not be stopped by something like this.All these was also witnessed by the Spirit Stone that was thrown in as it emitted a faint glow.When Little Spirit saw this, his eyes narrowed.Sima You Yue did not know how much time had pa.s.sed and when she felt that her body could no longer take it, the flames started to weaken and finally dissipated.She groaned and tried to move her fingers. They could only twitch at first and after a few tries, she could wriggle them, and cracking noises resounded in the stone chamber as she moved her whole body and the stiff joints started cracking. Fortunately after moving for a bit, her body movement resumed normally. She lay on the ground, panting as she looked at the ceiling in a daze. The whole experience was as if she had just walked through the sea of flames in h.e.l.l.\"Nirvana Fire has just cleansed your whole body, this would be a great help to your future cultivation.\" The same archaic voice sounded out.\"Nirvana Fire? Who are you? Why did you take the initiative to make a contract with me?\" Sima You Yue asked when she heard that voice sound out.\"I am called Crimson Flame. For everything else, the current you doesn\u2019t need to know. When the time comes, you will naturally know.\" The voice was somewhat low and magnetic.\"Aren't the both of us in a contract? Since we have already established a blood link, what is there to hide from each other?\" Sima You Yue pressed on.\"Knowing too much now won't be good for you. Your body's condition was too terrible, so I've helped you to temper it with Nirvana Flames. Your cultivation will be able to improve much faster from now. Have a look at your dantian.\"\"I cannot see it now\" She said with remorse.\"Give it a try.\"Don't tell me after tempering my body with Nirvana Flames, I can now view my dantian? Sima You Yue was still skeptical but she did as she was told. She closed her eyes and used her own consciousness to probe as she tried to visualise the interior of her body.Without trying she wouldn't know but when she tried, she had a huge shock! She could actually see the internal structure of her body, down to her meridians and blood vessels.\"To the dantian.\" Crimson Flame said.\"Alright.\" She continued to guide her consciousness to the desired location and the first thing she saw was a pool. This must be the Spiritual Pool that Little Spirit mentioned last time!The Spiritual Pool was divided into a few segments, each had a little level of liquid in it. However, there was one that was red in colour and the level was filled the most which showed that currently, her fire attribute was the most powerful.A manifestation of her consciousness as her tiny form appeared beside the pool and she was looking at a small red pearl that was rotating in the middle of it. Surrounding it was a cylindrical s.p.a.ce on it's own which held absolutely no Spiritual Energy.She stared at in in curiosity and asked: \"What is that?\"\"That is what was formed after your body underwent tempering under the Nirvana Fire. Look up.\" Crimson Flame said.She looked up and saw a rich flow of red Spiritual Qi flowing in the meridians and flowing into the Spiritual Pool.\"That's the fire attribute Spiritual Qi?\" Sima You Yue asked. \"But I'm not cultivating now?\"\"That is the role of the pearl, as long as it rotates, it will automatically absorb the Spiritual Qi around you. Even when you are not cultivating, Spiritual Qi will be absorbed here.\" Crimson Flame answered.\"Wow! So good!\" Sima You Yue exclaimed.Isn't this simply a high level cheat? Even when she's not cultivating , Spiritual Qi would automatically be absorbed, this way, she would have more time to do her own things!Because she was too excited, her consciousness suddenly bounced out of her body, ending the internal view.\"You are now very weak in strength, so you should seize the time to cultivate and not be lazy. This place has millions of years of fire Spiritual Qi acc.u.mulated in here, and a very suitable environment for you to cultivate. I will be in deep slumber from now on, don't disturb me.\"After saying his piece, there was absolute silence. She tried to sense his presence and realized that he already fallen into slumber!\"If he was going to sleep, the least he could do was to tell me what Spirit Beast he is!\" Sima You Yue was stumped as she grumbled.\"Cough cough-\" \"Although there isn't anyone else around, but Yue Yue, I think it's still best you put on some clothes first.\" Little Roar reminded.Only then did Sima You Yue realize that her clothes had been burnt into ashes by the flames and she quickly brought out a new set of men's robes and put them on.She started thinking about her current situation, since she was presented with such an opportunity, she certainly would not waste it. After she checked that there was nothing else in the stone chamber, she sat down at where the egg was previously and began cultivating.At the same time, at the back mountain at the Imperial Academy, the Spirit Beast Egg Selection had been over since three days ago. All the students had came out of teleportation arrays after they had selected their eggs. Everyone had came out after two days, all except for Sima You Yue.Feng Zhi Xing was still waiting in the cave, staring resolutely at the fourth teleportation array, looking forward to a reaction from it.\"How long are you going to wait here for?\" The princ.i.p.al came to the cave and asked the forlorn Feng Zhi Xing.\"I'll wait until she comes back.\" He looked up at the princ.i.p.al and turned his attention back to the array.The princ.i.p.al let out a soft sigh and asked: \"In the end, what is the relations.h.i.+p between you and him?\"When he saw that Feng Zhi Xing cast his gaze on him, he finally asked the question that he held in for so long: \"You do not treat him like a teacher to a student. The main reason that you've decided to teach here was also because of him, right? Tell me, what is the relations.h.i.+p between the both of you?\"Crimson Flame\u2019s chinese name is \u8d64\u7130: ch\u00ec y\u00e0nCan\u2019t wait for your next dose?

I know that you and General Sima have a very good relations.h.i.+p, anyway, I will not harm him. Furthermore, there is the Sima family to consider.\" Feng Zhi Xing said, \"Also there are the rules that constrain me, I would be unable to randomly interfere.\"\"I am not worried about what you would do,\" The old princ.i.p.al sighed, saying, \"I am just worried for you. If anything should happen to that child\u2026\u2026\"\"Nothing will happen.\" Feng Zhi Xing a.s.sured, \"That man's child will not lose his life so easily.\"Feng Zhi Xeng said it with such a.s.surance, but he did not know that Sima You Yue had actually already run into a bad situation, and her body was currently inhabited by a different soul.\"Sigh, you are a teacher, you cannot continue to keep watch here indefinitely.\" The old princ.i.p.al said.\"When it's time for cla.s.ses to begin, I will head to my cla.s.s.\" Feng Zhi Xing said, \"Oh right, Princ.i.p.al, do you know where this teleportation array leads to?\"\"Don't know. The people who come out always say that they don't know where they've been. The only information I have is that it appears as if everyone who goes in will go to a different place.\" The old princ.i.p.al said. \"But as for a specific location, it remains unclear.\"\"In this case\u2026\u2026\" Feng Zhi Xing was a little frustrated.\"You should just go back, if he returns from some other place, you wouldn't be able to see from here, anyway.\" The old princ.i.p.al said, \"In a while, I also have to head to the General's Residence to relate this piece of information to General Sima.\"\"I'll go with you.\" Feng Zhi Xing suddenly thought of something as he said to the princ.i.p.al.The princ.i.p.al nodded his head, and the two of them headed to the General's Residence.Sima Lie listened to the fact that there was no news about Sima You Yue in shock. He wanted to go look for her immediately, however, it was completely unknown where the teleportation array had sent her. Even if he wanted to look for her, there was no way.\"General Sima, you should have Sima You You's life jade, right?\" Feng Zhi Xing asked.\"Sima You Yue heard Feng Zhi Xing's words and his face immediately darkened. He asked, \"How did you know?\"\"Don't care about where I got this piece of information from, for now. You should first check whether or not her life jade is in good condition.\" Feng Zhi Xing said anxiously.Sima Lie saw the worry on Feng Zhi Xing's face and stopped harping on this question. With a single thought, a plain black jade box appeared in his hand.He opened the black jade box and inside it rested a white jade. The white jade had two flus.h.i.+ng red circles, as if it were human blood.\"This piece is You Yue's life jade. It is in good condition, it means that she is still alive.\" Sima Lie said, as he looked at the piece of white jade.Listening to Sima Lie's words, Feng Zhi Xing's anxious heart gradually calmed down.\"It's really because her life jade has no sign of activity that I could not detect her being in any form of danger.\" Sima Lie put the jade back in its rightful place, and put the black jade box back into the interspatial ring. He looked at Feng Zhi Xing and said, \"You can tell me now. How did you know about You Yue's life jade?\"Feng Zhi Xing replied, \"Of course I would know. Because I was the one who helped her mother make it.\"\"So you are\u2026\u2026\" Sima Lie looked at Feng Zhi Xing in shock.\"That's right.\" Feng Zhi Xing said, \"Don't tell You Yue about this.\"\"Of course I understand this.\" Sima Lie said.\"Since this is finished, I will return to the school first.\" The old princ.i.p.al said.\"Okay. In case there is any sign of activity from that child, I ask for you to let me know.\" Sima Lie said.\"I will.\"After waiting for the old princ.i.p.al and Feng Zhi Xing to leave, Sima You Qi and the rest went to Sima Lie's house and said, \"Grandpa, Fifth brother, he's is not in any danger right?\"\"Right now we only know that his life is not in any danger.\" Sima Lie said, \"But we have no idea what his current circ.u.mstances are. We are unable to discern this information from the life jade.\"\"I'll go look for Fifth Brother.\" Sima You Ran said.\"Come back!\" Sima Lie called out, \"You also know about the Academys' teleportation array. n.o.body knows where You Yue's been sent to. The kingdom's so huge, where would you go to look.\"(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\"But we can't just wait here!\" Sima You Ming said.\"Apart from waiting, there's nothing else we can do right now.\" Sima Lie said.\"But Fifth Brother's life jade is still in good condition. We can also pretty much guess his current situation.\" Sima You Ran said. \"Fifth Brother must have encountered some kind of situation and cannot return for awhile. Who knows, maybe he will return in a few days.\"\"Sigh\u2026\u2026\"During the following days, Feng Zhi Xing would come by every few days to enquire about the condition of You Yue's life jade. Everyone also become accustomed to checking the condition of the life jade every day.Although they knew that she was currently alive, within the academy, they disseminated the information that Sima You Yue had entered through the fourth teleportation array and had been sent to some G.o.dforsaken place and died.When this piece of news was being pa.s.sed around, there were people in the academy who took pleasure in other's suffering. Of course, those who hated Sima You Yue were amongst the happy ones. The ones who were the happiest were the Murong An and Nalan family.Amongst those who were worried, apart from her dorm roommates and Feng Zhi Xing, it was actually Meng Ting.The days pa.s.sed one by one. An entire month had gone by but Sima You Yue had yet to return. Apart from those few worried people, the others had apparently been convinced that she was already dead. He Qiu Zhi's worried heart had also slowly calmed down.During the time where everyone was incomparably worried about Sima You Yue, she was actually deep in meditation, cultivating.Because she had already reached the ranks of the Spirit Lord, she no longer had any need to eat. As a result, she had cultivated non stop for a few days. Following the saying of the previous generations, a few days pa.s.sed by with the blink of an eye.After waiting for her to blink a few times, lights that signified an advancement in rank appeared under her feet. After she had finished advancing, she was already at the fifth rank.The Spiritual Qi inside the cave had gradually dissipated to nothing. Sima You Yue glanced around at her surroundings and never thought that this inconspicuous cave would actually acc.u.mulate so much Spiritual Qi of the fire attribute. Furthermore, it was so dense. It had allowed her rise four whole spirit ranks in but a moment.\"It is merely the results of this environment.\" Little Spirit voiced out, \"With the agreement that you initially had with that Spirit Beast egg, at that time you had some semblance of force acc.u.mulating in your body. It wouldn't have let you grow by so much in such a short while. Right now, it's being released little by little. It was with the aid of this environment that you actually rose up four ranks.\"So it was actually because of this Spirit Beast Egg!If it was an egg that allowed one's spiritual energy to rise by so much; what kind of Spirit Beast would this be?\"Yue Yue, while you were practicing, we went outside to take a look. Outside of this canyon lies a range of mountains. This mountain range appears to be huge.\"\"A huge mountain range?\" Sima You Yue started to search her brain for information. A large mountain range in Bei Chen, one of it was Pu Luo mountain range in the North, while one of it was Bi Li mountain range in the South.Comparing these two mountain ranges, Pu Luo appeared to be slightly smaller while Bi Li was a little bigger. Also, the spirit animals that were living on Bi Li mountain range were much higher in quality.\"I don't know whether we are on Bi Li mountain range or Pu Luo mountain range.\" She stood up and pat the dust off her clothes.\"The problem will be solved if we just leave the canyon, catch a spirit beast and ask it.\" Little Roar said.\"Yup, this is the only thing we can do now.\"Sima You Yue hugged Little Roar and exited the cave. Following along the canyon, they left really quickly and entered a valley. Before they had the opportunity to scan their surroundings, she heard Little Roar say, \"Yue Yue, there's a person on this side of the river!\"Sima You Yue looked towards the river bank and saw a person lying on a huge rock by the river side. He was sprawled on top of the rock and his face was facing to one side, the rock was dyed red as fresh red blood was flowing out from beneath the body.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Before Sima You Yue had walked over, it had already pounced off her body and flew over to where that person was.\"Yue Yue, this person is really attractive.\" Little Roar exclaimed when he looked at that person's face.Sima You Yue walked over and looked at his face clearly. He had a sharp face that was extremely handsome, a rather straight nose and s.e.xy lips. His eyes were closed, so there was no way of knowing whether they were good looking or not. However, his long eyelashes were definitely extremely attractive.He was definitely a pretty boy! However, she had seen plenty of this kind in her past life. Even though they were not as handsome as he was, she had already developed some immunity.She frowned and said, \"He really is more good looking at me. All those who are more attractive than me are my enemies, let's go.\"\"Yue Yue, you're not going to save him?\" Little Roar exclaimed when it saw that Sima You Yue was only momentarily stunned by that person's face and was about to go off.\"Why should I save him?\" Sima You Yue glaced at that person and said, \"You should have left from this place earlier, and when you returned he was was not even here. How come he was here the moment we exited? Don't you find it strange?\"\"It could be that I returned at the same time that he had been hurt by the Spirit beast and ran over to this place and fainted.\" Little Roar said.Sima You Yue walked forward by two steps and lifted Little Roar, who was lying in front of the person while salivating. She said, \"Little Roar, don't think that I'm unaware that you have a perverted heart lying underneath your apparently pure exterior. You're a Sacred beast, not a pervert[1]!\"\"I'm not a pervert!\" Little Roar was picked up by Sima You Yue by his neck with four of its limbs dangling in the air. \"Yue Yue, we could possibly find out where this place is if we save him. It's always better to ask a person than to ask a spirit beast. At most, a spirit beast would be able to tell you where this place is, while a person would be able to tell you how to leave.\"Sima You Yue eventually stopped in her tracks. She pondered over Little Roar's words and said, \"Your words make sense. Alright then, we'll save him first.\"After bringing him to dry ground, she turned him over. She looked at the long wound on his stomach and it appeared as if it had been inflicted by a spirit beast's claw. It extended from his left chest all the way to the right of his stomach.\"Injured to such a large extent, and losing so much blood; it's so strange that he hasn't died yet.\" She clicked her tongue and sighed when she looked at his wounds.\"Yue Yue, can he still be saved?\" Little Roar asked as he floated beside her.\"He's not dead yet.\" Sima You Yue said. After which, she flipped over the ring that her cheap father had left behind and found the pellet of medicine that he had left behind. She took out a piece for him to eat. It was only after he had eaten it that she noticed words 'Fourth Grade' on the jade bottle. This was one of the most precious treasure of the entire Dong Chen Kingdom, so few that they could be counted with one's fingers. Thinking about how she had actually given this fourth grade medicine to a stranger, she started to feel immeasurable pain in her heart.\"Is just doing this enough?\" Little Roar asked.\"This is a Fourth Grade medicine.\" Sima You Yue said, \"That time, when I was hurt, the General's Residence didn't even have this fourth grade medicine. Grandpa actually had to go look for that Grandmaster s.h.i.+, or whatever, to exchange for 2 third grade medicinal pills.\"Talking about Sima Lie, she felt like she missed him a little bit.\"I don't know how grandfather is doing now. I've not contacted them in so long, he and my brothers must be worried to death.\"\"Yue Yue, don't worry. When he comes to, we will know where we are and find out how to get back!\" Little Roar comforted.\"Sigh, all we can do now is to wait for him to wake up.\" Sima You Yue sighed and said, \"You can make your body grow bigger right?\"(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\"Yup yup.\" Little Roar nodded its head.\"Then you should make yourself bigger and carry him on your back and bring him to the cave.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Wh-What? You actually want me to carry him on my back?\" Little Roar shouted in shock.\"Didn't you want to save him?\" Sima You Yue dug her ears and said, \"He's so big and this place is so far from the cave. If I drag him back, I'm just afraid that he would be dead even before we reach the cave entrance. Anyway, it's pretty good for you to get an opportunity to get close and intimate with this pretty boy.\"\"I'm a Sacred Beast that has integrity and morals!\" Little Roar retorted.\"So are you carrying him or not?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"I\u2026.. will!\" The little white ball had definitely thrown away whatever integrity and morals it had for the sake of this pretty boy.It trembled in the air for a while and its originally small body gradually became bigger, until it was about the size of a person.Sima You Yue moved that man on top of Little Roar's back and she herself also crawled on. Little Roar flew back to the cave with the both of them on his back.When they reached the cave, Sima You Yue, in a rare expression of kindness, took out an old bed from the Spirit Pearl. Although a person would rock and sway upon sitting atop that old bed, however, lying on it was definitely much better than directly just throwing him on the floor.When the bed was ready, she carefully placed him on the bed and took Ling Long out to turn her into a knife, cutting the clothes on his body to pieces.\"Yue Yue, are you acting like a rogue?\" Little Roar turned back into its small appearance and flew over, remaining at a side. It saw the clothes that Sima You Yue had cut and both of its ears hung down. It stuck out its claws to cover both of its eyes. This was a useless act since half of its eyes were peeping out.Sima You Yue's face turned completely black upon hearing what Little Roar said. She retorted, \"I learnt in the past that if you don't want to save someone then don't. But if you do, you need to put in all your effort to get it done well. Although he's eaten that medicine, his wounds still need to be cleaned.\"\"Oh, so that's why. I thought that you wanted to act like a rogue and take advantage of him!\" Little Roar straightforwardly looked at the body of the man lying down on the bed with its mouth open wide. The only thing missing was its heart-shaped eyes.Sima You Yue could no longer bear to look at its intensely l.u.s.tful face and grabbed its stomach to fling it backwards, straight outside.Without Little Roar messing around on the side, Sima You Yue could fully concentrate once again. She took out water and a towel from the Spirit Pearl and wiped away the bloodstains on his body. After that, she carefully washed his wounds. In order to avoid causing the man on the bed to wake up from the pain, she intentionally made her actions slightly more gentle.The man on the bed briefly woke up when she had bent over to clean his wounds. He opened his pair of hazy eyes and saw her sparkling and clear eyes single-mindedly examine his wounds.It appeared that he had been saved?He inwardly examined the situation of his body and ascertained that he had been saved. After which, he immediately fainted again.When that man had woken up, Sima You Yue happened to squat down to rinse the towel, so she did not notice. When she had finished was.h.i.+ng away the stains from his body, she realised that his wounds were already beginning to scab.\"Although I've seen the effects of this world's medicine many times, I always feel it's amazing.\" She stretch out her hand to touch the scars. \"When I have the time, I should look for two medicine books to read and learn a bit of pill concoction.\"After she had packed, only that large bed remained in the cave. Thinking about how she had not yet slept because she had been cultivating, she felt a bit sleepy looking at the bed.She looked at how that man was sleeping on less than half the bed and how she was also dressed as a man. So, she crawled onto the bed and fell asleep.[1] pervert in chinese literally translates to 'color wolf'- she's making a pun.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37: \"Negotiating Terms\"After a period of time, the man slowly opened his eyes. In the darkness, that pair of eyes flashed a light before dimming and became clear.\"Ugh-\" He habitually stretched out to touch his forehead but this small movement itself had triggered off a series of pain from various wounds all over his whole body. This series of pain jolted him awake as his once fuzzy consciousness resumed its usual sharpness.\"Master, you're awake!\" The voice of the Fire Qilin came from the contract s.p.a.ce.\"Yeah.\" Wu Lingyu groaned and began recalling the things that happened before he had lost his consciousness.He recalled that he had followed the clues and went to the Pu Luo Mountain Range in search of that thing, however not long after arriving, his fainting phenomenon occurred again.This fainting phenomenon was a period in which his soul was extremely vulnerable and would faint from time to time. This time round, however, he could not call out his Fire Qilin and had encountered a Sacred Spirit Beast.If it was a normal day, he would not even put a beast of such calibre in his eyes. But this time round, his fainting phenomenon had suddenly occurred, way earlier than usual. This had caused him to almost lose his life here.\"Master, your fainting spells have been recurring at much shorter intervals these two years. We must find that thing as soon as possible.\" Fire Qilin advised, his voice deep with worry.\"I know.\" He nodded his head weakly and asked again: \"I remember before I fainted, I was by the river, how am I in a cave now?\"\"Master, have you not realized that there is someone else lying beside you?\" Fire Qilin asked deviously.Wu Lingyu was shocked. He hadn't even realized that there was someone else lying beside him! If that person wanted his life, it was easy for that person to succeed.\"Master, there's no need for panic, she saved you.\" Fire Qilin said.Even though his soul was extremely vulnerable and weak now, and the interior of the cave was dark, that still shouldn\u2019t hinder him from sensing the presence of another in such close proximity!He remembered before losing his consciousness, he saw a pair of bright eyes, does it mean the person beside him was the owner of those eyes?\"Well, it's as if she's melded into this darkness, and almost erased her presence. So it's normal that you weren't able to sense her.\" Fire Qilin comforted his master.Wu Lingyu took out a medicinal pill from his interspatial ring. This pill was a much higher tiered medicinal pill than the one Sima You Yue had fed him. After swallowing the pill, he meditated and used his Spiritual Energy to circulate the pill to amplify its effect.After his soul felt more comfortable, he then sat up and took out a string of illumination pearls, wanting to have a look at the person whom he was lying next to. However, what he saw instead was a pair of eyes that were looking back at him.\"You've woken up.\" Sima You Yue sat up and looked at Wu Lingyu.Although she was sleeping, however the a.s.sa.s.sin instincts that was honed over the years made her extra sensitive to movements and sounds around her so when Wu Lingyu had woken up and ate the medicinal pill, she was already well awake by then.\"It's you.\" Wu Lingyu was surprised when he saw her close beside him.\"You know who I am?\" Sima You Yue put her both feet on the ground and climbed off the bed to stand beside him,This guy not only was handsome, he had a pair of deep eyes that could take one's breath away. With his eyes closed, he looked very pure and innocent. However, when he opened his eyes, they had a glint in them that suggested otherwise \u2013 his intent gaze was one that felt as if they were capable of hooking one's soul away just from a simple gaze.\"You can count it as I do.\" Wu Lingyu affirmed.That time when he was in Dong Chen Kingdom's capital city, he had seen her bash a man up into a complete waste. He also remembered that they even had a small discussion on this so he still had a faint impression of this girl disguised as a man in front of him.Sima You Yue thought that he was talking about her fame as a waste. \"It seems that this lord's reputation is quite renowned, well, since this lord has saved you, isn't there any reward?\"Wu Lingyu was rather amused. This brat was obviously a girl in disguise but she kept saying 'this lord'. Although she had on an illusion ring which masked her gender, did she think that this low level of enchantment could elude his Fire Qilin's sense?He flashed her an enigmatic smiled and asked in a deep seductive tone: \"So, tell me, what do you want as reward?\"(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\"Any reward will do, but I do have a preference for the likes of gold coins and gems.\" Sima YouYue did not expect him to give her anything specific and had casually mentioned something.\"I can give you a very good reward, but I have a condition.\" Wu Lingyu continued smiling and said.\"What condition?\" Sima You Yue furrowed her brows, this guy actually wanted to discuss terms and conditions with her!\"You have to accompany me for a period of time.\" He said. \"After that, I will generously reward you.\"\"Why?\" Sima You Yue was completely stumped at his request.\"Before I completely recover, I can't leave here.\" He answered in a straightforward manner.\"Do you know where we are?\" She asked.\"The Pu Luo Mountain Range to the south of Dong Chen Kingdom, thousands of miles away from the capital.\" He replied.Sure enough, they were really at the Pu Luo Mountain Range. That blasted teleportation array actually brought her to such a desolated place! Sima You Yue grumbled in her heart.\"But I need to go back, I've been away for too long, my Grandfather must be very worried about me.\" Sima You Yue sounded distant for a bit.\"If that's the case, I can't give you any reward.\" Wu Lingyu casually looked at her. \"I actually wanted to give you a medicinal pill that could promote the ranks, an advancement elixir. Well, we'll forget about it then.\"\"Advancement elixir?\"\"I know that General Sima have been stuck at a bottleneck for a long time and I happen to have with me two advancement elixirs and thought that if you were to accompany me for a period of time, I will give them to you as a reward. But\u2026\"\"I'll stay with you.\" She replied almost immediately. \"However, you better not be lying to me or else\u2026Do not take me lightly, just to let you know that I have the means to save you but also the means to kill you.\"Wu Lingyu's mouth curved up slightly. This bratty girl's tone wasn't not very small, doesn't seem like the legendary waste that everyone had made her out to be! Thinking back on her reputation as a waste, he asked, \"This place is filled with Spirit Beasts, how did you get here?\"\"The Academy's teleportation array sent me here. Hmm, those light pearls you have there are very good! They are really bright, come on, take out a few more out.\"Afterwhich, she turned around and went out.\"Where are you going?\"\"To prepare dinner.\"Sima You Yue left the cave as a guise, she didn't want him to know that she had her own s.p.a.ce that was akin to a world. Interspatial rings could only contain items and not anything that had a breath of life.\"Master, why are you getting a waste to protect you?\" Fire Qilin couldn't help but ask in the contract s.p.a.ce. \"Now that you're awake, I can just send you back to the Sacred Palace and let you recuperate.\"\"We're not returning to the Sacred Palace for now, since we've come all the way here, how can we leave without finding anything conclusive?\"\"But still\u2026 it doesn't make any sense to have a waste protect you?\" Fire Qilin was befuddled and asked in anguish.\"Doesn't it make you curious? To what her secret is? A waste surviving alone on the dangerous and desolate Pu Luo Mountain Range without a single shred of worry or fear. While we were in the Capital that time, we received news that she had been missing for two months, which means to say that she's been surviving out here for more than two months on her own. Doesn't it make you want to know how she's been surviving up till now?\"\"Now that you've mentioned it, it really does make me curious.\" Fire Qilin said. \"But it's not like your usual self, you are practically cold blooded, since when did you take any interest in someone else's matter?\"\"What cold blood are you muttering about?\" Wu Lingyu expressed his dissatisfaction with the Fire Qilin's own evaluation of himself. \"No matter what, I am the Sage Pavilion's Holy son and representing our Sacred Ent.i.ty to the world and sharing the glory of our\u2026\"Fire Qilin stopped him short and scoffed: \"That is the personage you project in front of other people, don't mix your real self with that fake mask.\"\"Oh well, it's about the same anyway.\" Wu Lingyu muttered as he lay down. \"Sima You Yue, you've sparked my curiosity\u2026hmmm\u2026\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 38: \"Intriguing\"While Wu Lingyu was lying down in bed trying to sort out the clues he had, a tantalizing smell of barbeque wafted in.Shortly, Sima You Yue walked in with a roasted chicken and saw that Wu Lingyu had indeed brought out more light pearls and the entire cave was illuminated as bright as day.She then took out a table from her interspatial ring as well as a plate and placed the roasted chicken on the plate as she proceeded on carve the chicken into several pieces and asked: \"Would you like to have some?\"She had given it some thought and had decided that since she won't be able to hide the fact that she could cultivate, she might as well openly use her interspatial ring for convenience. All she needed to do was to hide the fact that she had her own s.p.a.ce which could keep live animals inside, she just needed to keep her Spirit Pearl's existence a secret.\"You can use an interspatial ring.\" Wu Lingyu said it very matter of factly, without any surprise.\"Well, as long as one's a Spirit Master, it can be used.\" She replied.\"Rumours has it that you can't cultivate, let alone sense the Spiritual Qi.\" He pointed out.\"As you've said, rumours.\" She brushed it off as she steered the conversation away: \"Then what's-your-name, would you like to eat? If you aren't I'm eating it all.\"\"Wu Lingyu.\"\"Well then, Wu Lingyu, do you want to eat?\" She asked again.Usually he didn\u2019t eat such simple food but when he saw her bright eyes looking at him, he nodded his head and agreed.Sima You Yue pushed the table to the bed so that he could sit up and eat. She then put some on a clean plate for him and she carefully savoured the rest of the meat, slowly picking at it. The way she ate it was also an art as she ate it elegantly.Wu Lingyu picked up a chicken wing and bit into it without much thought. However, the burst of flavours that came right after was a huge surprise to him as he subconsciously took a bigger bite next.\"Never would I have thought that you are able to cook something so delicious!\" Not having eaten anything so delicious in a long while, moreover in such a desolate place, he praised her generously.\"There\u2019s more things that you\u2019ve not thought before.\"When she saw Little Roar enter, she took out the roast chicken she had prepared for him earlier from her interspatial ring.\"Yue Yue, you\u2019re so mean! Why didn\u2019t you call me when you have such good stuff here?\" Little Roar couldn\u2019t speak now so he transmitted the message to her directly to her mind.\"Even if I didn\u2019t call you, aren\u2019t you here now?\" She affectionately poked him on his head. \"I heard you happily chatting with another Spirit Beast just now, hmm, how did I not find out about this perverted personality of yours before?\"\"I\u2019m not!\" Little Roar weakly protested, however the vindication behind it also made it unable to believe it himself.\"Your contract beast?\" Wu Lingyu asked as he looked at Little Roar in curiosity.She glanced at him and replied: \"Yes, a useless and perverted one at that.\"\"Hey! Who's useless!\" Little Roar retorted.\"It's pretty cute.\" Wu Lingyu said.\"Thanks for your praise.\" By the time Sima You Yue finished gnawing on her last piece of chicken, she stood up and said: \"It's safe in here. The Spirit Beasts won't encroach this area, so rest a.s.sured and recuperate well.\"Following that, she left the cave.Little Roar was holding the roast chicken and he looked at the cave entrance and turned his little head to look and Wu Lingyu. He seemed to be in a dilemna and he finally tore his gaze away from Wu Lingyu and went out of the cave with the chicken.Although he was someone who appreciated beauty, the most important to him was still his Master.When Wu Lingyu saw the reluctance Little Roar had, he couldn't help but laugh out loud.After sensing Sima You Yue and Little Roar had gone far away, Fire Qilin appeared in his human form, donning on a set of fiery red robes and he swaggered over to his Master's side.He came to the table and sat down as he helped himself to a chicken thigh, chomping the chicken gleefully: \"Mmm\u2026. Master, this girl has pretty good cooking skills.\" He was relis.h.i.+ng the moment and licking his fingers as he ate.\"Why did you eat my chicken thigh?\" Wu Lingyu was sternly staring at the Fire Qilin.\"Well, anyway you don't eat such food.\" Fire Qilin continued enjoying the chicken thigh in his hands and in a few moments, he had completely gnawed it clean. He reached out for another piece of chicken but Wu Lingyu smacked his hands away and threw the chicken head to him instead.\"Can you identify what Spirit Beast was that beside her?\" Wu Lingyu asked.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});When Fire Qilin saw that his attention was not on the chicken, he quickly grabbed another piece of chicken and started eating it. \"You mean that guy? He's the ancient sacred beast, Hou.\"\"How can an ancient sacred beast appear in such a desolate place in the lower realm?\" Wu Lingyu was surprised with Little Roar's ident.i.ty and asked.\"No idea.\" Fire Qilin said while chewing. \"And it seems that he's been severely injured because of this, it has significantly reduced his powers. If he were to enter the upper realms with such mediocre strength, he's bound to be torn into pieces by other Spirit Beasts in no time, moreover his Master is so weak.\"Thinking back, when he saw Little Roar, even he himself was shocked as the Ancient Sacred Beast Hou was very rare, even in the upper realms. To actually see one here in such a desolate place in the lower realm was even more like a miracle.\"In the eyes of others, she is nothing but a waste. But not only can she cultivate, she also has a contract with the Ancient Sacred Beast Hou. She's really making me more curious.\" Wu Lingyu's lips curled up into a charmingly devilish smile.When Fire Qilin saw Wu Lingyu smile, he held a moment of silence in his heart for Sima You Yue.Each time his Master had on such a smile, it meant that the inner demon in his Master was at work. Not once had those that were the target of this smile had ever met a good ending.\"Where's my roast chicken!\" By the time Wu Lingyu had recovered from his thoughts, he found that other than the half eaten chicken wing in his hands, all that he saw was a pile of chicken bones in front of him.The Fire Qilin who was still eating the chicken put on a very serious expression and said: \"Master, with regards to that matter, let me go and check it. Since we share a soul contract, if I'm near it, I will be able to sense it too. This time, let number two protect you.\"Wu Lingyu threw the finished chicken wing onto the table and coldly said: \"I don't need you to worry about such things.\"\"Then I'm off.\" Fire Qilin left the cave and flew into the mountains.Sima You Yue looked at the mountains and saw that the Spirit Beast that Little Roar was happily chatting with with earlier and had called over was actually a saint ranked Iron Claw Tiger.She then learned more about the Pu Luo Mountain Range from this Iron Claw Tiger, such as the various powers of the Spirit Beasts residing in this mountain range, as well as the various territories. After she had learned everything she wanted to know, she told it that it was free to go.However, the Iron Claw Tiger looked at her hesitatingly.\"What's the matter?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"Well\u2026umm\u2026 I've kinda taken a liking Little Roar and since I'm all alone here, why don't you take me in?\" Iron Claw Tiger said in an embarra.s.sed manner.\"Cough cough-\" Sima You Yue was almost choked to death by her own saliva. She looked at the Iron Claw Tiger incredulously and gulped. \"I thought you Spirit Beasts despise humans? And you, a Saint Ranked Spirit Beast actually want to take the initiative to have me, a mere Spirit Master who just started cultivating as your Master?\"Iron Claw Tiger looked at Little Roar and said: \"I was actually chased out by my family clan, and I've been wandering about these mountains all on my own for so long. Since Boss has already followed you, I believe that you will grow to be incredibly strong in the future! I believe in Boss!\"Sima You Yue glanced at the smug Little Roar by the side who currently had his nose in the air, as she wondered how did he actually cheat a Spirit Beast of such calibre over.She looked at him helplessly and explained: \"Look, I would love to have you as my contract Spirit Beast but I'm not a Beast Tamer and I do not have the beast taming skills to suppress your Spirit Energy. I can't establish any contract with you as I won't be able to handle the backlash.\"Little Roar face palmed as he lamented : \"Arghh!!! How could I forget such an important thing!\" Just as he was so proud of himself, he actually missed out such a detail.\"Does that mean that I can no longer follow Boss around?\" Iron Claw Tiger asked dejectedly.Little Roar flew over to Iron Claw Tiger, landed on his back and said, \"Don't worry. Your awesome Boss here still has a way.\"Misty: Guess what I had for lunch? haha. Yup, Roast Chicken. Mmmmmmmm\u2026Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Furthermore, it's an ancient method that has long been lost so these beasts are also unaware of this.\"\"This can also be done?\" Sima You Yue said.\"Of course! Think about that egg, didn't it initiate a contract with you?\" Little Roar said.\"Oh yes! Now that you mention it, I remember!\" Sima You Yue looked at Little Roar and said, \"You actually knew it long ago didn't you, but you were not surprised at all. As such, you already knew what that egg was, yes or no?\"Little Roar didn't expect that he had just said a single sentence for Sima You Yue to realize this. He smacked his own head and said, \"With regards to that, Boss Chi said that we wouldn't tell you. Ah, Yue Yue don't ask about this anymore. It's for your own good that we're not telling you this information.\"\"Yup, I understand.\" Sima You Yue saw how frustrated Little Roar was and did not wish to trouble him. Since Crimson Flame had said that it was for her own good, she wouldn't ask anymore. \"However, this method that you talked about means that he has to take the initiative to acknowledge a Master?\"\"That's right.\" Little Roar nodded its head.\"Boss, but I don't know how to take initiative to acknowledge a Master.\" Iron Claw Tiger pointed out.\"No problem, this Boss will teach you how.\" Little Roar said as he patted Iron Claw Tiger's back.\"But you said that the beasts of this generation don't know the method of initiating contracts. So how come you know how?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"Of course it's been pa.s.sed down to me!\" Little Roar boasted, \"Don't forget that I am an Ancient Sacred Beast and we have strong ancestry. Although I don't know, the method can be found within my inherited knowledge.\"After saying this, Little Roar closed his eyes and thought for awhile. He very quickly opened his eyes and exclaimed, \"I found it!\"One could only see him crawl beside Iron Claw Tiger's ear and whispered a few sentences. He suddenly said out loud, \"You just have to voice out these few sentences and it will be done.\"\"Will do, Boss.\"Iron Claw Tiger nodded its head and waited for Little Roar to leave before it began to repeat the words that Little Roar had said.He appeared to be speaking in beast language since Sima You Yue could not understand a single sentence. However, it fell in line with their dialect. She and Iron Claw Tiger had a contract appear between them.Iron Claw Tiger lay down in a show of allegiance.\"Yue Yue, place your hand on its forehead.\" Little Roar mentioned as he stood at a side.Sima You Yue stepped a single step forward and placed her hand on Iron Claw Tiger's head. She heard it say, \"I agree that Sima You Yue is my Master and I will become her Contracted Beast. From henceforth, I will protect her and will never leave her. Sima You Yue, are you willing to form a contract with me?\"\"I am willing.\" Sima You Yue answered.After she said this, the contract began to s.h.i.+ne brightly. The bright lights engulfed the both of them and gradually dissipated. It divided into two and entered their bodies.\"Master!\" Iron Claw Tiger shouted excitedly as he felt the connection between himself and Sima You Yue.\"Ha, we actually managed to form a contract!\" Sima You Yue squatted down and looped around Iron Claw Tiger's neck.\"Haha, I already told you that forming a contract was possible!\" Little Roar boasted.\"Yup, it's really all thanks to you this time!\" Sima You Yue said.Iron Claw Tiger, through its contract link, managed to feel that Sima You Yue not only had Little Roar, this type of Ancient Sacred Beast, but also had another more powerful contracted beast. It had only felt it for a little while but it started s.h.i.+vering from head to toe from feeling its spirit pressure.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\"That one is the real boss. However, he's sleeping so don't disturb him.\" Little Roar warned.\"Yes, I understand.\" Iron Claw Tiger said as he truly acknowledged its master in his heart.\"Do you have a name?\" Sima You said as she patted Iron Claw Tiger's head.\"No I don't. My parents were already dead when I was born. n.o.body in the tiger pack liked me, so n.o.body had ever given me a name. After that, they even chased me out.\" Iron Claw Tiger said.Sima You Yue scratched Iron Claw Tiger's neck and said, \"Don't feel sad, from now on you follow us, and we are a family. Since you don't have a name, let's call you Ya Guang.\"\"Thank you master.\" Ya Guang said as it rubbed itself lightly against Sima You Yue's hand.\"Ya Guang, I want to train on Pu Luo Mountain Range for the next few days and need to look for a few spirit beasts that are weaker in quality to battle. Do you know where I can find some weaker quality and solitary Spirit Beasts?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"I know. In the past when I was wandering around Pu Luo Mountain Range, I had already explored most of it.\" Ya Guang nodded its head and pointed at a mountain range nearby. It said, \"Most Spirit Beasts over there are by themselves. And that area over there has spirit beasts and tend to flock together. The surrounding Spirit Beasts have qualities that are a little lower. They are generally weak Spirit Beasts. The middle area and inner region have a higher quality while the residents are mostly Saint Ranked Beasts. The inner areas even have a few Divine Ranked Beasts.\"\"Then is this area that we're in, considered the outer area or middle region?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"Master, this place can be considered the inner region.\" Ya Guang replied.\"Inner region!\" Sima You Yue blinked her eyes and said, \"This place is actually the inner area?! But how come I haven't seen a single Saint Ranked Beast?\"\"Cough cough, this area is the inner region.\" Ya Guang said, \"However, this is the fringes of the inner region. I've heard that it's unknown why, but the Saint Ranked Beasts never come here. As such, it is expected that master has yet to see a single Saint Ranked Beast even though you have hung around this place for such a long time.\"\"Then why would you be here?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"I fought with a third grade, Saint Ranked Beast and it was two levels higher than me. I was unable to defeat it so I ran.\" Ya Guang explained, \"However, I never expected that it would relentlessly pursue me to attack me so I escaped in a panic without knowing where I was going. Before I realised it, I was already here. After that I encountered Little Roar.\"\"There's actually a Spirit Beast that dares to bully you, we will look for it and take revenge!\" Little Roar said.\"There's no need!\" Ya Guang said.Sima You Yue held onto Little Roar and said, \"If you go over like this, who will be the one who beat it up? Are you able to defeat it?\"\"I\u2026 If I wasn't injured, a tiny little Third grade, Saint Ranked Beast would not even be worth looking at!\" Little Roar said.\"Ya Guang can't defeat it and you have no battle strength to speak of. I'm just a Fifth ranked Spirit Lord, am I looking for death?\" Sima You Yue said.\"Little Roar, Master is right. Right now, no matter who we look for, we wouldn't be able to defeat them. We would even endanger master.\" Ya Guang was clearly much more mature than Little Roar and said, \"Anyway, he didn't take advantage of me here. It wouldn't be too late for me to get revenge when I become stronger.\"\"Fine then.\" Little Roar thought about it and agreed. It would be troublesome to endanger Sima You Yue. After all, her current strength was really too low.\"Let's go back first, starting from tomorrow, we will look for spirit beasts to spar with. Little Roar, bring Ya Guang into the Spirit Pearl.\"After saying this, she sent Little Roar and Ya Guang into the Spirit Pearl and walked towards the cave at the canyon.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40: \"Eating what\u2019s hers, Sleeping what\u2019s hers\"When Sima You Yue returned to the cave this time round, Wu Lingyu was deep in meditation. However, once he sensed her presence, he came out of his meditative state and opened his eyes.\"You're back? Do you know where exactly we are now?\" Wu Lingyu asked her.\"Don't you know where we are? Didn't you come here on your own?\" She countered.\"I only know that we are in the Pu Luo mountain range. After arriving here, I encountered some things and now I'm not sure where we are exactly.\" He replied.\"We are in the innermost region of the Pu Luo Mountain Range.\" She replied. \"I was sent here by a Teleportation Array but yet here you are, all intact surviving on your own in the most dangerous region. You're really lucky to be alive and did not end up in some Spirit Beast's stomach.\"\"We're actually so deep in.\" He mumbled. \"Well, you've been here for such a long time already, why don't you tell me how did you survive out here? How is it that no Spirit Beasts have come to find trouble with you? They are very hostile to humans.\"Sima You Yue was startled for a moment as she herself pondered on why she had never encountered any Spirit Beasts despite staying here for so long. Before, she had thought that there were no Spirit Beasts living out here, however Ya Guang had just told her that there were Spirit Beasts in the vicinity.Was it because of Crimson Flame's presence that had deterred the other Spirit Beasts?She knew that in this world, the hierarchy of Spirit Beasts were strictly revered. From Little Roar's reaction and the leap in her cultivation advancement when she contracted with Crimson Flame, she had gathered that his ident.i.ty was not so simple. It must have been the pressure he emitted that had scared the other Spirit Beasts in the vicinity, hence this entire canyon was so peaceful.Even the divine ranked Spirit Beasts are so fearful of it, it made her wonder what kind of monstrous ent.i.ty did she have a contract with?Wu Lingyu looked at Sima You Yue who was deep in contemplation and asked: \"Do you know the reason?\"\"How would I know?\" She shrugged it off. \"Don't forget that I'm a renowned trash. How would I know such a thing?\"\"Didn't you say that rumours aren't credible?\" he flashed her an enigmatic smile.\"Haven't you heard of the saying? To take something with a pinch of salt?\" She glanced at him and brought out a pot as she got ready to prepare dinner. Since he was here, she wouldn't be able to cultivate now, might as well prepare something to eat.\"Didn't you just eat?\" Wu Lingyu looked at her puzzled.She looked at him and said defensively: \"Wasn't that all shared with you and Little Roar? It's almost night soon, it's obviously time for dinner.\"After saying, she looked around and put the pot back into the interspatial ring. She left the cave and took all her cooking utensils out and started preparing dinner.Wu Lingyu thought about things for a bit and he got off the bed and headed out and watched her prepare dinner. There was a pot that was simmering and in it was some rice grains with water. She was on the other side, frying up some dishes.\"Are you like this at home too?\" He asked.He had only heard her reputation as a trash, but did not know that she was so skilled in cooking. She was effortlessly frying up the dishes, in a practised manner. Her cooking skills were even better than the restaurants out there.\"Yeah.\" She snuck a glance at him and was inwardly praising this world's medicines and elixirs. He had such a deep gnash across his stomach just the other day and now here he was speaking to her as if it was nothing. This world's medicine was simply too incredible! If it was in her past world, one with such a wound would have to stay in bed for months to be doing what he was doing now. It merely took him a few hours and he could get out of bed.Wu Lingyu was leaning against the wall at the entrance and just watched her cook silently.After Sima You Yue finished dis.h.i.+ng up the food, she had prepared two portions and set them on the table. \"Powerful cultivators like you have no need to eat, so if you don't want to eat, you can just leave it there.\"\"Although I don't feel hunger, after watching you working so hard and pouring so much effort into this meal, I would like to try some.\"Under the silvery moonlight, the two of them ate out under the blanket of glittering stars, with the occasional roars from the Spirit Beasts echoing in the canyon as an accompaniment.Because it was rather late, she had only cooked porridge and two simple dishes. Although it was only two simple dishes, the taste was simply out of this world and for someone who was rarely interested in food, he couldn't help himself but had a second bowl.After she finished her meal, she put her bowl down and looked at him. \"I'll leave the dish was.h.i.+ng to you.\"\"You want me to wash the dishes?!\" Wu Lingyu thought that he had heard wrong. Since young, he had never needed to do such menial tasks and now in this lower realm, someone that he could crush easily like an ant was actually asking him to wash the dishes?\"Of course, since I prepared the meal, it's only right that you wash the dishes.\" She answered in a straightforward manner, as if it was a matter of fact.\"Don't forget that I'm akin to your employer, I asked you to accompany me and I'm even giving you a reward.\" He scoffed as he 'gently reminded' her.\"You said that you would give me two advancement pills but what happens if you fall back on your promise? Why don\u2019t you give me half of the reward first so that we can officiate this employment.\" She stretched her hands out and looked at him in earnest.Under the glowing moon, Wu Lingyu looked at the small hand in front of him that was as smooth as jade. He suddenly had the urge to reach out and hold this hand. He wanted to know how it felt to hold onto this hand.But it was only a pa.s.sing thought that flashed by. He wasn\u2019t a person that was attracted by woman and held no interest in them and their antics. He swiftly retrieved a small jade bottle from his own s.p.a.ce and placed it in her hands before he walked back into the cave.Sima You Yue pulled the stopper off and took a whiff, as a gentle and mellow fragrance drifted out.\"Little Spirit.\" She called out.\"What is it?\"\"Since your former master was an alchemist master, then you should be familiar with the various medicinal pills. You should be able to determine what medicinal pill this is, right? Can you help me identify and see if this is really an advancement pill?\"Little Spirit took the jade bottle from her hands and took a look. \"Yes it is. Moreover, it\u2019s the highest grade advancement pill at that.\"\"All's good then.\" When she heard Little Spirit's answer, she smiled and happily went to wash the dishes, almost seemingly humming a tune while was.h.i.+ng.After she had finished tidying everything up, she habitually went for a short walk after a meal and strolled about the canyon to aid her in the digestion of food. After her stroll, she returned to the cave.Wu Lingyu was lying in bed resting when he suddenly sensed a shadow cast upon him. He opened his eyes and snapped: \"What are you doing?\"\"Move further in.\" Sima You Yue gestured.\"Why?\"\"I want to sleep and you are right in the middle of the bed, occupying the whole bed. Move over.\" Saying which, she sat down by the edge and started removing her shoes.\"No.\" Wu Lingyu refused to budge.\"Why? She sat up and looked at him, puzzled.\"I don\u2019t like to sleep with someone else as well, but this is my bed and it\u2019s the only one I have. May I ask if you have one?\"\"No.\" He replied.Usually all these basic necessities were all arranged for him, there was no need for him to bother about such trivial matters. That was why he never had any of such things like a bed in his own interspatial ring.\"That won't do.\" She frowned. \"Now there's only one bed, if we're not going to sleep together, where am I going to sleep? Or why don't you give me back my bed.\"She continued to remove her other shoe and when she saw that he did not move, she pushed him in.\"Wu Lingyu, this is MY bed!\" She yelled at him.\"It's mine now.\" He replied in a faint voice. When he saw that she touched him, he subconsciously reached out and patted her hand away.Sima You Yue's hand stiffened in a conditioned reflex and she thrusted her hand out like a knife towards Wu Lingyu. From a simple push, everything escalated into a fight.Her moves were fast, accurate and ruthless but Wu Lingyu did not fare any worse and he kept up with her moves although he was lying down. Eventually, they fought to a standstill.When she saw that she could not win him, she stopped and immediately flipped on top of him with her two hands supporting her. She was face to face with him and saw that his entire face was black. She then roared at him: \"Do you have any obsessive compulsive disorder or are you just crazy? It's just two men sleeping on the same bed! Is there a need for such a big reaction?!\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslated by SocksrockerChapter 41: \"This Lord is a Man and I Have No Interest In You!\"Sima You Yue was a little bit angry and glared maliciously at Wu Lingyu.Wu Lingyu saw the movement of her eyelashes and suddenly thought of the time where he saw a pair of sharp and focused eyes when he was conscious.\"You're pressing on my wound.\"Sima You Yue remembered that he had a wound on his stomach and got up from his body, saying, \"This Lord is a man, I have no interest in you. Quickly s.h.i.+ft inside.\"Wu Lingyu didn't say anything this time and s.h.i.+fted in a little.Sima You Yue took out a pillow from her interspatial ring and put it outside. She lay on her side and closed her eyes, choosing to ignore Wu Lingyu.Although she was a female but she did not care a single bit that they were sleeping on the same bed. On the other side, he was still hesitating and his heart was a complete mess.Wu Lingyu could feel that Sima You Yue was angry and he touched the wound on his stomach. Who knew that this brat would have such nimble skills. For this kind of close-ranged attack, if he was not so experienced with combat, he would not be her opponent at all.He thought about the rumours that were spread about her. Did she really use to be a waste?If the rumours in the past were false, that would mean that she had really concealed herself very deeply.When she had roared just now, that att.i.tude was really quite powerful.However, whenever he watched her pretend to be a man, he always felt indescribably amused.Thinking back on her declaration of zero interest in him, with her eyes that remained clear even as she said it, he subconsciously touched his face.Even in the upper realm, no matter where he went, he was the centre of attention. There were countless girls who tried to gain his favor and affection by fawning all over him.Although he had had never liked any of those girls, truth be told, he hated them even more. But never would he have thought that come there would come a day where, in this place, there was actually a brat that roared her disinterest in such a loud voice.Although Sima You Yue was sleeping, she had let Little Roar, and the others, pay attention to Wu Ling Yu's condition, just in case.Every time she slept, she was afraid that she would have dreams of her past, once again. Even so, she still hoped that she would dream of them. However, this was yet another night of dreamless sleep until the sunrise.Wu Lingyu only managed to fall asleep very late into the night. He wasn't used to having anyone in such close proximity, moreover it was sharing a bed. Furthermore, it was a female. This made him extremely uncomfortable, and only managed to sleep when it was close to the break of dawn.On the morning of the second day, Sima You Yue rose from the bed. She looked at Wu Lingyu, who was still asleep, and quietly walked outside to prepare some food. After that, she quietly came back in and put the food on the table before leaving once again.Wu Lingyu waited for Sima You Yue to leave before opening his eyes. He lay on his side and used his hands to prop up his head. Looking at the food that had been prepared on the table, he started to laugh.He rose from the bed and went to sit down at the side of the table, saying, \"This brat really thinks that everyone is like her and needs to eat three meals a day without missing a single one!\"He sat down and ate two mouthfuls of porridge, saying, \"This brat comes up with completely new dishes , where does she get all these ideas from? However, this taste is really good.\"Wu Lingyu thought that this time, Sima You Yue had gone for a stroll and would come back soon. However, he had already waited for half a day and yet there was no sign of her.When Sima You Yue had left the cave in the morning, Ya Guang shouted: \"Master! The inside of the Spirit Pearl is amazing!\" Ya Guang said as it looked excitedly at Sima You Yue.\"Yue Yue, this guy has been bouncing around the Spirit Pearl ever since it came in. Its uncontrollably excited.\" Little Roar crawled on Ya Guang's head as it reported to Sima You Yue.\"This is the first time I've ever seen such a great place so I got excited for awhile.\" Ya Guang said a little embarra.s.sedly.\"Anyway, if you all are fine with it, you will remain in there. It'll be good for you to get used to it.\" Sima You Yue said, \"Do you know how to get to the fringe peacefully?\"\"Master needs to look for Spirit Beasts in order to increase real combat ability?\" Ya Guang asked.\"Yup. My current strength is insufficient. I also don't know many spirit skills. I want to start practicing from the weakest Spirit Beast.\" Sima You Yue said.\"There's no definite safe path from here to the outer region. However, if Little Roar is here, if we encounter any Divine Ranked Spirit Beast, he just needs to release his aura. They will take it upon themselves to hide in a faraway place. Little Roar can just hide his aura once again once we've reached the outer region.\" Ya Guang said.\"In this case, let's move out.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Master, this place is still very far from the outer region. You can climb on my back and I can bring you there.\" As Ya Guang said this, its body started to shake and it grew quite a lot.When Spirit Beasts reached the Saint Rank and above, they would gain the ability to camouflage. Before this, Ya Guang would always camouflage itself.Sima You Yue flipped onto Ya Guang's body and said, \"Let's go.\"When Ya Guang received the order, it brought Sima You Yue with it as it ran to the outer region. Using Little Roar's Spirit Pressure on the road, they quickly reached the fringe of the Pu Suo mountain range.They stopped at a mountain top because Ya Guang was not like Little Roar, who could easily release or retract its own Spirit Pressure. Sima You Yue was afraid that these Spirit Beasts would all go into hiding and stored it away in the Spirit Pearl. She only left Little Roar outside to accompany her.The number of Spirit Beasts on the Pu Luo mountain range was really a lot. They had just come down from the top of the mountain when they encountered a Fire Lizard.\"Yue Yue, that's a third ranked Spirit Beast. With your current strength, it's suitable for you to battle it.\" Little Roar looked at the Fire Lizard's ranking as it said.\"And it's also of the fire attribute. It's just in time for me to put my Fire Spirit to the test.\" Sima You Yue said.The Fire Lizard saw Sima You Yue and its eyes immediately shone brightly. It looked like a hungry dog who had seen a bone and wanted to eat her.This was because Sima You Yue did not have any Spirit Power aura emitted from her body. That Fire Lizard a.s.sumed that she was just a normal person. From the beginning, it did not plan to attack her using any Spirit Power and wanted to fling its long tail over instead.It went without saying that this Spirit Beast had an extremely hard exterior. This Fire Lizard had merely flung its tail, but the stone that Sima You Yue was initially standing on had multiple cracks from that hit.\"What shocking strength!\" Sima You Yue stood at a side, looking at the crack on the rock. She said with a little surprise, \"It looks like this Spirit Beast has quite a strong body. This point is not bad.\"Upon encountering a strong enemy, she became especially excited. Since its strength was so huge in contrast to a person's weaker body, she decided to play on her strengths.\"It just so happens that I haven't used my Spirit Power to fight any other opponents. You will be my first test subject.\" After saying this, she began to gather her internal spirit power and it slowly began to coalescence on her palm.The Fire Lizard saw that Sima You Yue began to gather spirit power and started to cry out. This time, it used its tail and aimed it at her. It appeared to want to disrupt her movements.Sima You Yue saw what the Fire Lizard was doing and quickly avoided it by dodging to the side. She had dangerously avoided that attack.If it was any other person, they would definitely be disrupted in the face of such an attack. Just like that time on the battle stage where Meng Ting had, because she had seen herself, prematurely released a ball of spirit power.However, even though she had only this moment of hesitation, she had not been disrupted and continued to gather spirit power on her hand.Her ball of spirit power grew bigger with the increase in quant.i.ty of her spirit power. She had already begun to feel the power contained in her hand. It was a feeling unlike in her past world where one would point a gun at someone. This kind of power made one feel that they would be able to temporarily split the sky.A red fireball also began to gather on the mouth of the Fire Lizard. At the moment where it had thrown the fireball towards Sima You Yue, She had also thrown the ball of spirit energy. Both of them collided in the air with a sound that sounded similar to a bomb explosion.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslated by SocksrockerChapter 42: \"A Badly Injured Soul\"Wu Lingyu was meditating inside the cave, as he slowly gathered his soul together.His Master had mentioned it before- his soul was not complete and half of his soul was missing. As such, as the years went by and as he grew older, his body also became increasingly weak because that half of a soul was unable to support his increasingly strong body.Aside from his body growing increasingly weak, there was also a another problem, which would be the fact that he would faint periodically. Furthermore, he would be unable to use any spirit power for a period of time after waking from his unconsciousness. He had to rely on the medicinal pill that his Master prepared for him in order to slowly restore his soul.He practiced for a whole day yet Sima You Yue never came back. He stood up and went outside the cave only to realise that it was already dusk.\"Master, she wouldn't have left after you gave her the pill, right?\" Another contractual beast that Wu Lingyu had, cautiously said as was floating in the contractual s.p.a.ce.A similar thought momentarily flashed by, as Wu Lingyu pondered on it for a while. However, thinking about her pair of clear eyes, he shook his head, saying, \"She wouldn't.\"He had just spoken these words when Sima You Yue's silhouette appeared at the other end of the canyon. Because she didn't expect that Wu Lingyu would be at the cave entrance, she stared blankly when she saw him.Wu Lingyu noticed that there was something off about the way Sima You Yue was walking and asked indifferently, \"You're hurt?\"\"A shallow wound.\" Sima You Yue's right hand covered her left arm, \"Why are you outside?\"\"Came outside to check the time and see why you hadn't returned.\" Wu Lingyu replied.\"Relax, I'm a man of character and my words carry weight. Since I've taken your reward, I won't leave by myself.\" Sima You Yue said this and walked past him to enter the cave.\"This brat, still so sensitive.\" Wu Lingyu smiled.Sima You Yue returned to the cave and lay on the bed. Although she had eaten the medicinal pill, the wound of her arm still ached dully, reminding her of all that she had experienced today.This morning, when she had fought with the Fire Lizard, she had fully depended on the senses of her body and experiences of her previous life an a.s.sa.s.sin in order to win.When the Fire Lizard had died, Ya Guang told her that people tended to bring the carca.s.s back with them after killing any spirit beast because their bodies were relatively tougher and could be sold. Furthermore, there was a crystal core in their head. These crystal cores were a crucial item in pill concoction and could be sold for a good price.So she called out for Ling Long and got her to change into a dagger. She split the Fire Lizard open right there to look for the crystal core in its head. She also conveniently split the meat on its body.Although she had gained some spoils of war, her body also suffered a series of injuries.By the time she had finished doing all these, it was already afternoon. She made herself a simple lunch but before she had finished eating, a Golden Leopard had found her by following the scent of her blood.This Golden Leopard was of a similar ranking to the Fire Lizard. However, it had lived much longer than the Fire Lizard and so its battle ability was higher by quite a lot. It's agility was it's best attribute and it used it to it's advantage. Because Sima You Yue had already expanded quite a bit of spirit energy in the morning, she had yet to fully recover. It was only with much difficulty that she managed to win the Golden Leopard and even received a wound from it on her arm, and it even slammed her whole body to the ground. However, that beast still died in the end.She had battled two Spirit Beasts in one day and even received injuries. This allowed her to experience the strength of their combat abilities for the first time.Despite all that, she had still come out victorious. It was just that her body was tired beyond belief and her arm was still bleeding. She took out the medicine from her interspatial ring. However, because it had been eaten by that guy Wu Lingyu, she could not find a high quality pill and could only randomly take a bottle out, so the effect was not that fast.She stood up and stored the carca.s.s away in the Spirit Pearl and rested for quite a long time. She waited for her wound to close before calling out Ya Guang.\"Master, it was too dangerous just now. You should have called us out.\" Ya Guang said the moment it came out.\"This kind of danger doesn't count for much, it's not like a matter of life and death.\" Sima You Yue said.\"But Master, you're injured.\"Ya Guang said with heartache.Sima You Yue patted Ya Guang's head and said, \"If a person wants to grow, one needs to learn independence. If one thinks of relying on others from the onset, it will be hard for a person to grow.\"Ya Guang pondered over this for a moment and said, \"Master, I understand.\"\"Alright, I don't have anymore strength left today to fight. Let's go back.\" After saying this, she sat on Ya Guang's back and let him take her back to the canyon.Thinking back on the morning fight, Sima You Yue felt a bit of excitement. She realised that she was much better at utilising her body's spirit power today than she was yesterday. It had been such a long time since she had fought a good battle that her entire body was cheering.However, she also knew that her body was currently insufficient and so had suffered injuries during battle.\"It looks like I not only need to engage in battles, I also need to train this body.\" Sima You Yue said this and then closed her eyes and slept.Wu Lingyu took a stroll around the canyon and saw Sima You Yue sleeping when he came back.\"Gone out for an entire day, and even sustaining injuries when you came back. What exactly did you do today?\" Wu Lingyu muttered softly.When he arrived at the bedside, the originally sleeping Sima You Yue opened her eyes for awhile. She saw that it was him and continued to sleep.\"This brat is so alert.\" Wu Lingyu gave a sigh and removed his shoes. He came to the bed and lay down.It was unknown whether it was because he had not yet eaten today or because he was thinking about where she had gone today, but he was unable to sleep. However, he was already accustomed to having this brat beside him. Even if they were sleeping on the same bed, he no longer reject it like he did before.However, this was the first time that he had removed his halo and had interacted with someone else like an ordinary person.Since the beginning, he had always been revered, like the stars surrounding the moon. He was like the moon and he was constantly surrounded by admirers. Later on, when he had ascended to the position of the Holy Son of the Sage Pavilion, his ident.i.ty became even more untouchable. No matter where he went, he received more than a little respect and attention.Being saved by someone, eating and sleeping like a regular person, especially having to wait for someone to come back, it could be said that these days had experiences he never had before.It could be because of the change in environment. This was how he explained it to himself.On the second day, Sima You Yue woke up very early once again. The medicine had healed yesterday's wounds by quite a bit so she went out to make some breakfast. She carried it back in, preparing to place it down to Wu Ling Wu but she saw that he had already woken up.\"You've woken up so early.\" Sima You Yue said with a bit of astonishment.\"Couldn't sleep so I woke up.\" Wu Lingyu said, \"You've already made breakfast?\"\"Yup. Sima You Yue put the food on the table and said, \"Since you're already woken up, let's eat together.\"Wu Lingyu came to the side of the table and sat down, while Sima You Yue placed his share of breakfast in front of him.It was in line with his expectations that today's breakfast was different from the one he had before.Sima You Yue sat opposite him and didn't say a word, only immersing herself in eating.Wu Lingyu saw Sima You Yue's appearance and, although she had male garb on, he strangely felt that he was sitting across a picturesque wife.Wife? Thinking of how he had actually thought of this term, his heart started to pound indescribably.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43: The True himAfter dinner, Wu Lingyu saw that Sima You Yue was preparing to head out.\"Where are you going?\" he suddenly asked.\"Into the mountains.\" She replied.\"I want to go with you.\" He quipped.\"What?\" She looked at him in surprise. Wu Lingyu had on the same bewildered expression as the two of them were stunned momentarily. Even he himself did not know why he said that.\"Cough-\" \"Well, since this time belongs to me, it\u2019s obvious that I want to know what you do outside.\" Wu Lingyu nodded his head, not sure if this was said to convince Sima You Yue or himself..Sima You Yue saw him smile and frowned. \"This smile is too fake, I\u2019d rather you not smile.\"He touched his chin and said \"Others have always said that my smile is like the sun and it brings them warmth and hope, and they can feel the glory\u2026\"\"Those people were blind.\" She cut him off midway and shot him a superficial glance.\"Haha\u2026\" Wu Lingyu let out a laugh and no longer kept up the pretense and his whole aura changed.His smile turned from one of brilliant suns.h.i.+ne into one that was from the dark abyss. His whole expression took an instant switch as his whole demeanour changed and his eyes that were innocent and pure changed to one that had a tinge of demonic charm and his whole persona seemed to have changed into a completely different person.\"This should be the real you.\" Sima You Yue who looked at him indifferently and said.The guy before was like an unparalleled holy person and emitted resplendent hope and light when he spoke, however the man before her now gave out a totally different and dangerous vibe.This contrast was simply too great!If she had not witnessed it herself, she wouldn't have believed that it was the one and same person.\"Now, can you take me along?\" He asked her, with a trace of mirth in his eyes.She still hesitated, if she took him along, he would find out about her contract with Ya Guang.\"Don't worry, whatever I see, I won't say a single word.\" He chortled. \"Since there is nothing to say.\"Sima You Yue looked at him in the eye and her intuition told her that he wasn't lying. \"Alright, you can come along, but I've got no time to take care of you.\"\"That doesn't matter.\" He smiled, her strength was so low, for her to protect him was simply a joke.Once they stepped out of the cave, Sima You You immediately summoned Ya Guang and climbed onto his back. She then turned to Wu Lingyu and said: \"Come on up.\"Wu Lingyu was inwardly surprised, this brat actually had the means to contract another Spirit Beast? Normally, those with her current level of power could only have one contract beast. Not to mention, this Spirit Beast that she just summoned was of a Saint Ranked. Such a feat could only be possible if she had a strong mind and soul.Sima You Yue saw that he was staring in a daze and remembered that he didn\u2019t like to have close contact with other people. \"If you're not going to come up, then go back.\"She smiled sweetly and turned away.Just as Ya Guang was about to take off, she suddenly felt a warm pair of arms hugging her waist tightly from the back.\"I can\u2019t use any Spirit Power now, so you have to let me hold on tightly to you now.\" Wu Lingyu leaned in and said it in a low and husky voice just beside her ear.Her face immediately darkened. Although she couldn\u2019t see him, she could still sense that he had on that aloof smile.\"Then hold on tight. Ya Guang, let\u2019s go.\" Once he heard her command, he leapt into the air and followed the same route to the outer region as yesterday.Once they reached the fringe of the Pu Luo mountain range, Wu Lingyu looked at the surroundings and asked, \"What are you doing here?\"You'll know it in awhile. But I'll need you to leave me further for a bit. I won\u2019t be responsible for anything if you get injured.\"He was baffled at her request but very soon he found out the reason she was here for.This time round, she encountered a rattlesnake, one that was two ranks higher than yesterday\u2019s Spirit Beasts!If she had met it yesterday, she would most likely a lost. But after going through the two battles yesterday\u2019s, she was more skilled in using her Spiritual Powers and also gained more insight into battling Spirit Beasts.Wu Lingyu leaned lazily against a tree while he watched the battle with interest. He was just a slight distance away and could watch the battle very clearly, as he saw the intense battle going on between that small human and huge Spirit Beast. Several times, there were near misses and the rattlesnake had came very close to landing its bite on Sima You Yue. She had narrowly escaped each time by a hairs breath.As the battle dragged on, she got more used to fighting with this body and utilising her spiritual powers. She felt her body seemed to be more attuned to how she wanted it to move and her hits and dodges progressed smoothly and she could avoid all the vicious attacks by the rattlesnake much easier now. In the initial stage, she was seen narrowly escaping with her life, now it was clear what she was doing, she was actually using this snake as a sparring opponent!With her dagger in hand, she deftly leapt into the air and gracefully dodged in midair, flipping her body swiftly and arrived behind it and stabbed the dagger into its huge body. The rattlesnake was furious as it felt a sharp pain on its back and it twisted in agony as it felt it\u2019s strength drain away at an astonis.h.i.+ng speed.However, it refused to submit at it relentlessly tried to throw her off its back as it twisted and wreathed about furiously.Sima You Yue did not expect that despite stabbing her dagger into the death point of the snake, it still had so much fight in it and it trashed about, trying to best to fling her off its back. She then firmly gripped her legs around the snake, but she had squeezed them so tightly that the scales had cut through her pants and deep into her legs.The rattlesnake made another attempt as it straightened its whole body, trying to get her to fall off. She immediately grabbed its body with her left hand and mustered all her strength and she stabbed into the snake.This time, she had used all her strength and the rattlesnake could only struggle a few times before it slumped and crashed onto the ground.After such a bitter struggle, she felt a wave of exhaustion wash over her and she followed the snake and slumped onto the ground.Wu Lingyu slowly walked over and looked at the brat who was playing with death just moments ago , was sprawled in a puddle of blood panting heavily.She had completely shocked him with her tenacity and battle prowess, even staking her own life to practice! He started to see her in a different light as all the previous notions of her being a wastrel was completely swept away.\"Are you alright?\"\"It won't kill me.\"Sima You Yue flipped over and she lay all sprawled out as she lay on the ground. She had just battled the rattlesnake for more than a hour and she could no longer feel her four limbs, not wanting to move at all at that moment.Hearing what Sima You Yue said, Wu Ling Yu laughed out lightly and said: \"If you're still not dead then get up. If you continue to lie there, other spirit beasts will smell the scent of blood and come running here.\"Sima You Yue glanced at Wu Ling Yu and drew in a deep breath before she pushed her hands on the ground and stood up.Wu Ling Yu stood on one side and looked at that wretched figure to ask: \"Where do we go now?\"Sima Yiu Yue retrieved the rattlesnake and kept it away before she turned to look in all directions to finally say: \"There.\"Wu Ling Yu did not comment and just followed her downhill, where they saw a little brook at the foot of the mountain.\"Look, you just sit here and have a rest. I am going to take a bath and you must not peep.\"Sima You Yue pushed Wu Ling Yu to sit down below a tree as she spoke while she went around to the back to take her bath at the brook. Before she dipped herself into the water, she summoned Ya Guang and the others to help her stand guard.Although she looked outwardly like a male, but she was a woman through and through. And if that fellow was bored from having nothing better to do and came here and saw her, she would have lost out big time.Wu Ling Yu sat below the tree and he could hear the sound of water behind him as he leaned back against the tree. He had not sat upon the ground for a long time and he was feeling rather carefree and relaxed.It's fine, take it as indulging himself just once. He will allow himself to be more uninhibited here and he can go back to being a saint when he gets back to the Sage Pavilion.Thank you for reading the Original translations of:Genius Doctor Black Belly Miss- Insanely Pampered Wife - Divine Doctor Fifth Young Miss- Mesmerizing Ghost Doctor- Prodigiously Amazing Weaponsmith\u2013 The Anarchic ConsortOnce again, Thank You for the support and please continue to read other translated series on Misty Cloud Translations!*Deep Bow*Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

She asked, \"You didn't peek right?\"\"What's there to peek at?\" Wu Lingyu asked.\"Hmph.\" Her figure was good okay? It had just yet to develop.\"What are we doing now?\" Wu Lingyu asked.\"I'm hungry, I'm going to find something to eat.\" Sima You Yue said.Wu Lingyu parted his lips slightly, eating again?Sima You Yue didn't care about his reaction. Coming to the riverbank, she took out the snake that she had just killed, slicing it into portions with her knife. She kept the leftovers and took a piece of it to wash using the river water.\"You plan to eat this thing?\" Wu Lingyu walked over and saw Sima You Yue handling the snake meat with furrowed brows.Sima You Yue glanced at him and said, \"If you don't like it you don't have to eat it. Anyway you won't feel hungry even if you don't eat.\"After she had thrown Wu Lingyu off with her words, he stood at the side and didn't talk anymore.After Sima You Yue finished was.h.i.+ng the snake meat, she took out a pot and put in various ingredients before placing it on top of the fire to stew some snake soup. Then she used some skewers to barbecue the rest of the snake meat.After a little while, the aroma of the barbecued meat wafted over, and she prepared to season it before barbecuing it for a little longer, finally putting it on a plate at the side.After waiting for all the meat to finish barbecuing, she put the barbecue on the table.\"Do you want to eat it or not?\" In any case, he was now her employer so she had to at least go through the motions of asking him.Wu Lingyu apparently looked at the snake meat with some distaste, but after some hesitation, he still came to the table to pick up that barbecued meat to eat.While eating the barbecued meat, the snake soup was also pretty much done. Sima You Yue put their two portions into two bowls, and the delicious smell caused Wu Lingyu to go back on his decision, which was initially dead set against eating snake meat.\"You look like you really know how to cook?\" Wu Lingyu asked as he finished drinking all the soup in his bowl.\"You know that I used to be unable to cultivate.\" Sima You Yue said, \"So I always had to eat. Eventually, I learnt how to cook.\"\"The General's residence doesn't have a cook?\"\"Can the average chef cook as well as I do?\"\"\u2026\u2026 No.\"\"Then, that's that. Anyway I really enjoy cooking.\"After eating, she kept all the things and continued to look for any Spirit Beasts who were alone in order to continue practicing.At night, they didn't return to the cave in the canyon, choosing to look for a cave outside to rest instead. Anyway, she had only returned there yesterday because Wu Lingyu was there. Since he had come along with her today, there was no need to go back there.After that, for the next half of a month, they never went back to that canyon. Sima You Yue had pretty much spent her days fighting spirit beasts while Wu Lingyu would go along with her occasionally, choosing to cultivate in the cave alone at other times.After half a month, Sima You Yue could feel that Wu Lingyu's strength was recuperating quickly. There were even times where he would inadvertently leak out some aura that actually caused her to be afraid.However, no matter how strong he became, she was fine as long as she never allowed him to interfere in her battles.It was just that it appeared as if this guy never planned to get involved in the first place.After half a month, Fire Qilin came back but was unable to find Wu Lingyu at the cave in the canyon. He relied on its contractual link to look for them at the surrounding areas.Sima You Yue was currently battling a spirit beast, but when the Fire Qilin came over, he had immediately caused that spirit beast to faint.\"Yue Yue, that's a Shape-s.h.i.+fting Beast.\" Little Roar notified her from the Spirit Pearl.\"Shape-s.h.i.+fting Beast?\" Sima You Yue looked at Fire Qilin in shock as she said.Fire Qilin saw Sima You Yue looking over and she was immediately found it hard to breathe as she was crushed by the invisible spirit pressure that was coming from his body.Was that his contractual beast? Not only was his own strength extremely powerful, he also had such a powerful contractual beast. What kind of ident.i.ty did he have?\"Yue Yue, I know who he is now.\" Little Roar said.\"You know him? Have you met him before? Why didn't you say so earlier.\" Sima Yu Yue asked with surprise.\"When did I meet him! If I'd really met him, I would have remember it long ago.\" Little Road said, 'It's just that I recognise his contractual beast.\"\"That Shape-s.h.i.+fting beast? You are acquainted with it?\"\"Something like that.\" Little Roar said, \"That's Fire Qilin.\"\"Fire Qilin? Isn't that the Ancient Divine Beast from the legends?\" Sima You Yue recalled a time where she had seen the description of some ancient Sacred Spirit Beasts in a book. One of them was the Fire Qilin.\"That's right, it's an Ancient Divine Ranked Spirit Beast like me.\" Little Roar said, \"Furthermore, it had actually appeared on the mainland. A person who is able to have a contract with it must be the Holy Son of the Sage Pavilion. Now that the Fire Qilin has appeared, that Wu Lingyu is definitely the Holy Son of the Sage Pavilion.\"\"What kind of power is the Holy Son of the Sage Pavilion? It sounds very upright.\" Sima You Yue said.\"The Holy Son of the Sage Pavilion has the power to govern the world. No matter where it is, there is a place for the Holy Son of the Sage Pavilion, it's equivalent to the G.o.d that governs this world.\" Little Roar continued to say.\"So you're saying that this guy actually has a very respectable ident.i.ty?\" Sima You Yue touched her chin while looking at Fire Qilin and Wu Lingyu.\"The Holy Son of the Sage Pavilion puts on a pure and holy appearance to appear in front of the ma.s.ses. I've heard that the Holy Son is the most pure and holy male, it really commands respect.\" Little Roar said.\"Pure and holy? How come I can't see it.\" Sima You Yue said, \"I feel as if his body has a smell of some kind of disease.\"On the other side, Wu Lingyu and Fire Qilin were having a conversation.\"Master, I can't find that item.\" Fire Qilin said, \"I've already scoured the entire Pu Luo Mountain Valley but I didn't catch a single whiff of its scent.\"\"Could it be that my feeling was wrong?\" Wu Lingyu said.\"Master, what should we do now?\" Fire Qilin asked.\"Since there's nothing, we can only return back upstairs for now. We just received a summon from the palace hall today, it's calling everyone to rush back.\" Wu Lingyu said.\"Is anything the matter?\"\"Not sure, it's possible that the old guy has found another woman from the prophecy.\" Wu Lingyu said, \"We should go back first to take a look beyond anything.\"\"Okay.\"After the two of them finished their conversation, Fire Qilin went back to his contractual s.p.a.ce. Wu Lingyu looked over at Sima You Yue hinting at her to come over.Sima You Yue thought about the fact that he was her employer, and so walked over to Wu Lingyu.\"We've leaving now.\" Wu Lingyu said simply.\"You're done?\" Sima You Yue blinked, looking at Wu Lingyu excitedly.Wu Lingyu saw Sima You Yue's excited appearance and his heart felt uncomfortable for some reason. She really didn't want him around to that extent?\"Are you very happy?\"\"Of course! Although it's great for me to stay here and cultivate, there are still some important things that I have to do. Oh-\" Sima You Yue had yet to finish speaking when she had been drawn into an embrace.\"What kind of things do you have to do that are more important that accompanying me?\" Wu Lingyu looked at Sima You Yue with an evil grin on his face, his eyes churned with rage.\"Are you crazy?\" Sima You Yue didn't understand why Wu Lingyu had suddenly become this way and used both hands to push against his chest. \"Let me go!\"\"Crazy? Maybe I really have gone crazy.\"After speaking, he imprisoned Sima You Yue's arms and she had been wrapped in his embrace. Also, amidst all her confusion, he bent down and planted a kiss upon her lips.Chapter 44: \u201cLeaving On A Journey, First Kiss\u201dCan\u2019t wait for your next dose?

After that, she crouched down and slipped out of his imprisonment.\"Are you crazy?!\" She stood far far away, looking guardedly at Wu Lingyu.Wu Lingyu touched his lips. He had already smelled the scent of his own blood.\"You really bit me viciously.\" He muttered, his face had no trace of trying to calm down.\"Of course!\" Sima You Yue glared at him and said, \"This Lord really meant it, I have no interest in men like you!\"\"Oh? How come I've heard of you relentlessly pursuing men without letting go, paying attention to all kinds of men?\" Wu Lingyu said as he wiped away the blood on his lips.\"Those were all rumours. I've already told you that you can't believe in rumours. This Lord here loves beautiful ladies.\" Sima You Yue could lie without even blus.h.i.+ng.\"Hehe.\" Looking at the state that Sima You Yue was in, he couldn't help but laugh.\"You like men?\" SIma You Yue sized him up. After that, it was as if she had heard it from some unknown place as she said, \"You're not straight!\"Wu Lingyu saw Sima You Yue's straightforward gaze and his face sunk, \"What did you say?\"\"I don't care whether or not you're straight since you're going to leave this place anyway. You should give me my other half of the reward now, after that we can both go our separate ways, never to meet again.\"\"Never meet again?\" Wu Lingyu moved his body slightly only to appear beside Sima You Yue. She had been completely unable to see his movement clearly, she could only feel that she was being crushed by his power and could not move her body.Wu Lingyu took out a jade bottle and pulled Sima You Yue's hand up, placing it in her palm. After that, he moved beside her ear and said, \"Next time, remember to change the scent on your body or else those spirit beasts of a higher right, you won't be able to deceive their noses, woman.\"Sima You Yue froze, he knew that she was a woman?!Wu Lingyu looked at Sima You Yue's expression with satisfaction, smiling as he gave her another kiss on the lips. After that, he said, \"Although I don't like woman who cry and whine, since we've already shared the same bed for so many nights, I'm not someone who won't take responsibility. I'll just have to force myself to acknowledge you as my woman.\"Sima You Yue glared at Wu Lingyu. This guy actually knew everything but he had nonchalantly shared the bed with her. Now he had actually said, she was his woman now, or something. If she was not being imprisoned, she would definitely stab her dagger straight into his heart.Wu Lingyu saw the rage in her eyes and smiled happily. He stretched out his hand to touch her smooth face, saying, \"You're cute even when you're angry. I hope that the next time we meet, you would have grown a bit. See you next time, and remember to wear some female clothing for me.\"I'll wear rags for you to see!\"Hehe.\" Wu Lingyu realised that he actually really liked to see her get angry. He took off the Illusion ring from her finger and her appearance changed. At the very least, she was no longer flat chested.\"So you actually do have something there.\" He nodded his head approvingly, as he used his hands to cop a feel.b.a.s.t.a.r.d! Rogue!\"Cursing me? I'm just measuring their volume.\" Wu Lingyu said. After that, he took out another ring and p.r.i.c.ked Sima You Yue's finger. He dripped a drop of blood on it, and put it on her after waiting for the drop of blood to enter it. He turned the k.n.o.b on the ring and Sima You Yue turned into the appearance of a man once again.Watching Wu Lingyu put the ring on her finger, Sima You Yue suddenly thought of how people swore their love to each other in holy matrimonial in her old world. This was similar to the groom putting the ring on his bride.Wu Lingyu looked at Sima You Yue's current appearance with satisfaction, saying, \"Like this, even if you encounter a higher ranked Spirit Beast, they won't be able to sniff out the female scent from your body. Alright, that old guy is pestering me again so I have to go. Remember, you're my woman. You're not allowed to flirt with other men, don't attract any random bees. Remember to think of me.\"After saying this, he gave her another kiss on the lips.\"Woman, don't forget our agreement, remember to wear female clothing for me next time.\"You a.s.shole!\"Hahaha! If you leave this place, there's a city nearby. That place has a teleportation array that you can take back to the capital.\" Looking at the current state that Sima You Yue was in, he laughed twice more and retreat to a s.p.a.ce, with both hands forming a seal. Suddenly, the s.p.a.ce around him twisted and moved according to his hands and looked as if it had been ripped open. A black pa.s.sage appeared in front of him.When Wu Lingyu appeared in front of that pa.s.sage, he turned his body to look over at Sima You Yue, saying, \"Woman, remember you can't let other people know that you are a woman, or else if something happens to you, I won't be able to go and save you.\"After saying this, He turned his body and entered that pa.s.sage. After he entered it, the pa.s.sage closed as if it had never appeared in the first place.\"d.a.m.n!\"After Wu Lingyu had left, Sima You Yue regained control over her body. When she thought of the feeling she had of being imprisoned, she was incomparably angry. Even if he wanted to kill her, she was completely defenseless and had absolutely no strength to retaliate.However, this also sparked her fighting spirit. Wouldn't killing one\u2019s enemies based on a type of feeling be considered the strength of an expert?She looked at the ring on her finger and thought of the fact that he knew she was a female and had even kissed her three times. She really felt the impulse to go and kill him.\"Just you wait! If I don't manage to take my revenge, I'll take on your surname!\" Sima You Yue had just entered the new place when she roared loudly.This was the first kiss of two lifetimes, but it had actually been s.n.a.t.c.hed away. She raged just thinking about it.\"Yue Yue\u2026\u2026\" Looking at Sima You Yue about to explode from rage, Little Roar timidly shouted from the Spirit Pearl.\"What do you want?\" Sima You Yue said huffily.\"That, I heard the sound of many Spirit Beasts running. If you continue to linger here\u2026\u2026\"Little Roar had yet to finish speaking when she saw countless Spirit Beasts run out from behind the mountain. She used all of her strength to run. That wave of Spirit Beasts had at least a hundred of them. It must be the comrades of the rhinoceros that she had just killed. They must have smelled the scent of his blood and had come to take revenge.\"d.a.m.n!\" Sima You Yue could not afford to grumble anymore. She could only take to her heels and sprint off, running while asking Ya Guang to come out. She waited for it to turn back to its original body, then rode on its back, running out of Pu Luo Mountain Range.The s.p.a.ce tunnel opened in another world and Wu Lingyu stepped out of it. Thinking about how furious Sima You Yue was just now, he could not help but break out into a smile.He called out Fire Qilin and let him return to his original body before sitting on him.\"Master, your actions just now were quite unlike you.\" Fire Qilin said as he flew.\"Hmm?\"\"You couldn't possibly be thinking of making her your woman, right?\" Fire Qilin asked.\"Why not?\" Wu Lingyu asked.\"But she's way too different from you. Even the women inside the palace are better than her by a least a few thousand times. How could you think she's good enough?\" Fire Qilin could not understand. He had only left for half a month but his Master, who had never used to even stand close to a woman, had become like this!\"This Lord likes the things that she cooks.\" Wu Lingyu said slowly.If Sima You Yue had heard him, she would definitely be filled with regret that would transcend generations. If she knew this earlier, she wouldn't cook anything for him!Wu Lingyu laughed. Actually he also had no idea why he would tell her that he wanted her to become his woman. However, when he had said it just now, he had no evil intent or feelings, as if it was something that just had to be done. The little obstinate face, unyielding bravery in the face of danger, ability to barbecue such amazing food; every single part of her was different from the other women he had met.In these little ways, she had found a place in his heart.'His woman'. Thinking about it, he was filled with sweet pleasure and could not help but smile. This form of address was really not bad.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

The marble palace walls shone with white radiance under the sunlight, looking incomparably majestic and holy.Wu Lingyu sat on Fire Qilin and descended right in front of the main door of the palace. The gatekeepers immediately knelt, saying respectfully, \"Greetings to the Holy Son.\"Wu Lingyu smiled lightly as he nodded his head, saying gently, \"You may rise.\"\"Thank you, Holy Son.\" The gatekeepers stood up and returned to their positions.\"Where is Pavilion Lord?\" Wu Lingyu asked.\"The Lord is at Clear Wind Palace Hall together with the other Branch Pavilion Lords, discussing some affairs.\" The gatekeeper replied, \"The Lord instructed us that if the Holy Son returned, to tell him to look for them in the Clear Wind Palace Hall.\"\"I got it.\" Wu Lingyu waved his hand and entered through the palace door. He walked towards the Clear Wind Palace Hall. All the people kowtowed towards him whenever he walked by in reverence.\"Holy Son, Pavilion Lord has been waiting.\" A woman dressed in white said as she saw Wu Lingyu, \"Please follow this servant.\"'The lady led Wu Lingyu inside, and the people in the main hall said, \"Pavilion Lord, the Holy Son has returned.\"A man clad in black sat on the seat above, his white Chang Pao was concise but it was not simple. His handsome face looked like he was not more than 30 years old, but he had already an old man who had lived for more than a thousand years.\"Lingyu greets Pavilion Lord.\" Wu Lingyu bowed slightly.\"Lingyu, you're returned. I am currently discussing some affairs with these other Lords. You can return to your seat.\" Pavilion Lord nodded as he said.\"Yes, Pavilion Lord.\" Wu Lingyu walked to his seat and sat down.\"Alright, let us continue.\" Pavilion Lord said, \"Where were we?\"\"In response to Pavilion Lord, we were talking about the incident where the Ximen clan was exterminated.\" A female Pavilion Lord said.\"Right, have we properly investigated this incident of the extermination of the Ximen clan?\" Pavilion Lord asked.\"We have finished investigations. The perpetrators were the ones who have always been at war with them \u2013 the Zong Zheng clan.\" The Branch Pavilion Lord said.\"We do not have to bother about the previous issues of the clan. However, I've heard that the Ximen clan has a daughter called Ximen You Yue, her innate gift is extremely high, is that the woman whom the higher ups want us to look for?\" The Pavilion Lord asked.\"In reply to Pavilion Lord, the man who was sent to investigate this matter has returned. Ximen You Yue has a strong innate talent as well as a multi-faceted Spirit Master, however, she only has 3 facets and does not possess the four different facets that was rumoured.\" The Branch Lord said, \"Furthermore, she has already been killed by the Zong Zheng Clan, this point can absolutely be verified.\"Wu Lingyu sat at his place. Listening to them talk about Ximen You Yue, he could not help but to think of Sima You Yue. Thinking of how he had thoroughly enraged her before he had left, he could help but break out into a smile.\"Since that is the case, there is no longer any need to care about the affairs of the Ximen family.\" Pavilion Lord said.\"Yes, Pavilion Lord.\" That man said, \"However, when we were investigating, we found out that the Zong Zheng family has a little miss called Zong Zheng Han Yue, she's a rare talent. I feel that I could let her enter my Sage Pavilion.\"Could she be the woman from the prophecy?\" Pavilion Lord asked.\"No, she's a dual faceted Spirit Master with the gold and fire attributes.\" That Branch Pavilion Lord said, \"She has already been tested by our own people and they have confirmed that she is a dual faceted Spirit Master.\"\"Since she's a dual facet Spirit Master, you can let her enter.\" Pavilion Lord waved his left hand, as his right hand rested on the armrest and leaned his hand against his forehead and said, \"Is there anything else you want to raise?\"\"Pavilion Lord, during my administration, I discovered a four faceted Spirit Master.\" Another Branch Pavilion Lord, who had a cold disposition, said.\"You're certain that she has four facets?\"\"Yes I am, Pavilion Lord. That is a ten year old female child who has just begun to cultivate. During the clan ability testing, it was found that she possessed four facets.\"\"No matter whether or not she is the woman from the prophecy, we cannot let this go.\" Pavilion Lord said slowly, as if a person's life was worth nothing to him.\"I have already called for men with superior skills to bring her to take on our clan name and bring her into the Sage Pavilion. I wanted to give a report to Pavilion Lord before executing her.\"\"Good. It is the will of the higher ups, in order to avoid the killing of a thousand, we cannot let a single one go. As long as they are female with four or more facets, we cannot let them go, do you understand?\" Pavilion Lord warned.\"Understand.\"Wu Lingyu sat wordlessly at his place and he laughed coldly in his heart. This was the 'pure and holy' Sage Pavilion. In their eyes, the lives of others were worth less than a stalk of gra.s.s. All for the sake of a prophecy from who knows where.After a while, after they had finished their discussions, only Pavilion Lord and Wu Lingyu, these two people, were left.\"How come you went out for so long this time?\" Pavilion Lord asked Wu Lingyu.\"In reply to Pavilion Lord, I'd heard that there were movements in Yi Lin Continent, so I went down to take a look.\" Wu Lingyu replied.\"Then did you meet any suspicious people?\"\"No.\" Wu Lingyu said confidently. \"Yi Lin Continent is the most inferior continent here. Looking for a talent is more difficult than reaching for the sky.\"If one was talking about a suspicious woman, then he would definitely think of Sima You Yue. However, he had no plans to say anything about this.\"Even if this is the case, you shouldn't be careless.\" Pavilion Lord warned.\"I understand.\" Wu Lingyu lowered his head slightly, looking as if he had taken to heart what he had said.\"How is your body?\" Pavilion Lord asked in concern.\"In reply to Pavilion Lord, it is the same as it always way. My Master said that he is still looking for a way for me to fix this problem.\" Wu Lingyu replied.Pavilion Lord took out a jade bottle from his interspatial ring and said, \"This is a pill that I have tasked others to research about. It nourishes the soul greatly. Take it and use it well.\"Wu Lingyu rose, both hands extended towards the jade bottle, saying, \"Many thanks for Pavilion Lord for your concern.\"\"You are the Holy Son that I have personally chosen and you are my successor. It is a given for me to show you some care.\" Pavilion Lord smiled lightly, \"If there's anything else in the future, just get the people in the lower realm check it out for you. There is no need to go there personally.\"\"I understand.\"\"Alright, you should go and rest.\" Pavilion Lord said as he waved his hand.\"Alright. Then I will head downstairs first.\"\"Go. Remember to use that medication.\" Pavilion Lord urged.\"Yes, I will go back and use it well.\" Wu Lingyu said, \"Lingyu takes his leave.\"Wu Lingyu turned around and walked out with large strides. When he was at the entrance, he heard the sound of Pavilion Lord's voice.\"Holy Maiden will be coming back from above these few days. When that time comes, bring a few people to receive her.\"Thinking about that annoying woman, whose skin was thicker than the concrete wall and always stuck around him, Wu Lingyu went stiff. However, he still turned around to reply, \"Yes.\"Meanwhile, in the Pu Luo Mountain Valley in Mainland China, Sima You Yue miserably sat on Ya Guang as they escaped. She's originally thought that just being able to leave the mountain valley would be good, but who would have thought they would chase her for several hundreds of kilometers.As for that 'nearby city' that Wu Lingyu had told her about, it was only after riding on Ya Guang's back, running for half a day when she finally saw it.\"We've ran so far, this is his idea of a nearby city?\" Sima You Yue placed Ya Guang back into the Spirit Pearl. \"Next time, if I ever meet him again, I will definitely tear out his skin!\"She entered the city. Everyone saw her battered appearance but they did not laugh at her. In fact, they even expressed some kind of admiration.\"May I ask, how do I get to the Spirit Masters Guild?\" Sima You Yue pulled a pa.s.serby to ask.\"Great Master, just continue walking on straight. After crossing two streets, just turn left and you will be there.\" The pa.s.serby, who had been pulled to a stop, replied with veneration.\"I got it, thank you!\" It was the first time that Sima You Yue had been looked at with a gaze of admiration and it felt a bit strange.What she didn't know what that the people of this place could tell at one glance that she had come from Pu Luo Mountain Range. A person who dated to enter the Pu Luo Mountain Range alone must definitely be a powerful expert. Everyone immediately had the posture of reverence.She followed that person's instructions to get the the Spirit Masters Guild; that was a place that would have that teleportation array back to the capital.Thinking about the person who had pushed her, she broke into a sneer. She was about to go back so she should properly prepare her own revenge.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

The Spirit Masters were bound by the rules of the guild, however in return, they also gain protection from the guild.Similarly, all the other professions also have their own guilds. Alchemists had their Alchemists Guild, Weaponsmith Masters would have their Weaponsmith Masters Guild and Beast Tamer Masters had their Beast Tamer Masters Guild and even the mercenaries had their Mercenaries Guild.All these guilds worked together and did not work in isolation.Each guild would be in charge of the different resources and every city's teleportation array would be located at the Spirit Masters Guild.When Sima You Yue walked into the Spirit Masters Guild, the person inside saw her tattered clothing and immediately felt a deep sense of veneration.\"Is there anything that I can help you with?\" The girl at the counter bowed down slightly as she asked.\"I wish to use the teleportation array to return to the capital city.\" Sima You Yue said as she looked around the guild.It could be because the area was relatively small so this Spirit Masters Guild and was decorated simply. The counter was old and worn, leaving only one girl inside who had bent her head down to work. It was only when she had seen her walk in that she raised her head to inquire what help she needed.That girl smiled lightly and said, \"Sorry, we don't have a teleportation array that sends you directly to the capital.\"\"You don't?\" Sima You Yue was puzzled. Didn't Wu Lingyu tell her that they had one?\"We used to have one, but it was damaged recently and we haven't had an Array Master to fix it yet.\" That girl said with a slight flush of embarra.s.sment, \"However, we have one that will send you to a city near the capital and from there, you can transfer and use their teleportation array to head on to the capital. Don't worry, this way would not spend too much time or gold coins.\"\"Okay then, send me to that place first.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Please fill up this form first, and pay 5 gold coins.\" The girl handed a piece of paper to her.Sima You Yue looked at that piece of paper and saw that it was just some fundamental information, with a brush of the hand, it would be done. After that, she took out 5 gold coins from her interspatial ring and placed it on the counter.The girl put the gold coins into the drawer, and took the piece of paper without even looking at it, as she said, \"Please follow me.\"Sima You Yue followed her into a hall behind the Spirit Masters Guild and saw the mark of the array in the middle. The wall contained various city names.\"Please stand on the array.\" She gestured over to the array in the middle.Sima You Yue stood on it and saw the girl walk over the right side of the wall and press the name of a city.\"This is Chariot City, which is on the right of the capital city. Going to the capital from there should be convenient.\" The girl explained to Sima You Yue.Sima You Yue nodded. At this time, the array suddenly gave off a flash of light, similar to the time when she had seen the array in the cave. The inscriptions and runes were filled with light and she disappeared within the array.The girl saw that all was normal with the array and then lowered her head to look at the form in her hands. She saw the name filled in the box and was shocked.\"Sima You Yue? That waste?\"She raised her head to look towards the array, however, Sima You Yue was already gone.\"There's no way it would have been that waste.\" The girl shook her head as she said, \"That waste cannot cultivate at all, and the person just now had an interspatial ring. He was definitely a Spirit Master. It must be a person who has the same name.\"The girl shook her head as she left the hall.Sima You Yue felt her body being squeezed by the immense pressure and she couldn't help but closed her eyes tightly while she was being teleported. After an unknown period of time, only when she felt the pressure release could she open her eyes. This time, she had already appeared in another place.\"Hmm? This came from the Pu Luo Mountain Range? How come there's only one person? Hey, quickly wake up, don't hog the teleportation array, there are people from other places that will be sent here.\"Sima You Yue heard an astonished voice and crawled up from the teleportation array, mustering her energy as she groggily stood aside.It hadn't been half a minute since she left when the teleportation array flashed with light again. After the flash of light, three people appeared in the hall.Those three people glanced at the surroundings wordlessly and immediately left.After they had left, the teleportation array lit up yet again, this time, only two people appeared. In a similar fas.h.i.+on, they glaced at the surroundings and left.Sima You Yue saw that the others were standing, and it appeared as if she was the only one who was lying down when she arrived at this place.\"Hey, what are you still doing here? Aren't you leaving yet?\" A youth in his teens berated her when he saw that she was just staring blankly at the teleportation array.\"I want to use the teleportation array to go to th capital.\" Sima You Yue said.\"You want to go to the capital?\" The youth looked at Sima You Yue twice before saying, \"When you go out, turn left into the courtyard. Go there.\"Sima You Yue had no idea why he had told her to go to that place but she still followed his instructions obediently and went there.She currently had the pressing desire to return home. She couldn't be bothered with those people who had bad att.i.tudes.After she stepped out of the teleportation hall, she saw a large garden outside. It was a picturesque sight as she saw the beautiful landscape filled with a huge variety of rare and exotic flowers, a complete contrast from the Pu Luo Mountain Range's simple Spirit Masters Guild.She saw a stalk of Foxtail Gra.s.s, a plant she had came across a few times in her past world. She went forward and broke off a portion, and placed it in her mouth, following the youth's instructions to head to the courtyard at the side. To her surprise, there was an extremely long queue.\"So many people!\" Sima You Yue gasped as she grudgingly went over and stood right at the back of the line, slowly shuffling along with the group of people.She had initially thought that this place was just for her to fill out the form, but she quickly realised that the the people who went in never came out. She could see that there were occasional flashes with white rays of light.\"It turns out that the teleportation array for entering and leaving is not the same in this place.\" She touched her chin and muttered, \"This teleportation array looks quite fun. In the future, I should go and learn it. If I was able to create my own teleportation array, that it would be so convenient.\"\"Hahaha-\"When the man in front of her heard what she said, he started to laugh out loud.The fellow behind her pat her shoulders, saying, \"Little brother, being an Array Master is not something that you can become just by thinking about it!\"\"Is it very difficult to become an Array Master?\"\"Of course, not everyone can become an Array Master, it's as difficult as becoming a Alchemist or a Weaponsmth Master! Actually, it might even be a little harder because there might be an Alchemist out of a thousand Spirit Masters, but it's uncertain as to whether or not there will be an Array Master.\" That fellow said.\"Really, then isn't become an Array Master really amazing?\" Sima You Yue's eyes shone, if the person that she was familiar with in her past life knew this, she would definitely be exceedingly interested.\"Haha, in any case, it's very difficult. Little Brother, if you're that ambitious, then try your best at it! If you manage to succeed, at that time you will be able to get anything your heart desires!\" That fellow didn't have any intentions of making fun of Sima You Yue, only encouraging her as he pat her back.\"Hehe, thank you elder brother!\" Sima You Yue smiled as she said.\"Not a problem. Try your best, Little brother!\" The fellow encouraged, \"Oh right, where do you want to go?\"\"The capital.\" Sima You Yue replied.\"This place is not far from there, it's such a waste of gold coins to use a teleportation array to get there. Do you know anyone from the capital?\" That man asked.His random chatter gave Sima You Yue a scare. If she used a teleportation array to go back, she would be sent directly to the Spirit Masters Guild in the capital. The people here may not recognize her, but the people over there would definitely recognize her! Wouldn't the fact that she had become a Spirit Master become exposed?!\"Ah, I just remembered that I have something to do. I'll head off first! Goodbye elder brother.\" After thinking it through, she left the queue and exited the Spirit Masters Guild.As she walked down the street, she grabbed a man to ask him the way to the capital. That man not only told her how, but also told her that she could take a Beast Carriage to head there for only 15 gold coins.As such, Sima You Yue went to look for a place that rented Beast Carriage and rented one, letting the other party send her to the capital.It was a journey that did not even take a day. It was clear that this city was really very close to the capital. As the clouds started to turn pink and a beautiful orange glow covered the skies, she had finally reached her destination. It was almost night but she had made it back on time.Outside the city, she paid the reward and let the other party return. She looked at the majestic city wall and smiled lightly.Grandfather, brothers and those who had schemed to hurt me, I, Sima You Yue, have returned!Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Where's Grandfather?\"\"The General has just returned.\" The guard replied, \"I will notify them immediately.\"After saying this, that person sprinted inside, shouting while running, \" Fifth Young Master has returned, Fifth Young Master has returned!\"Sima You Yue watched that guy running and yelling around in such an amusing matter and shook her head, as she had on light smile and headed inside.\"You Yue has returned? Where?\"\"Fifth Brother has returned? That guy has finally come back!\"\"Fifth Young Master has finally returned.\"When Sima You Yue had just pa.s.sed through the front courtyard, she was blocked by a pair of broad shoulders, and she was immediately pulled into a warm embrace.\"Grandfather.\" Smelling that familiar scent, Sima You Yue snuggled deeply into that embrace.\"You've finally decided to return!\" Sima Lie hugged Sima You Yue tightly, his voice was choked with emotion.\"Grandfather, I'm well and fine!\" Sima You Yue patted Sima Lie's back and comforted him.\"Fifth Brother, you've finally returned. If you had dragged it on any longer, the few of us were planning to go and look for you!\" Sima You Ran and the rest of them had also ran into the courtyard and saw Sima You Yue, who had peeked out from Sima Lie's embrace.\"Grandfather is really biased, he has never hugged us like this before!\" Sima You Le whined.\"If you went missing for a few months, I would also hug the few of you!\" Sima Lie roared at Sima You Le.\"Fifth Brother, where have you been these past few months. You really worried us to death!\" Sima You Qi walked over. Seeing that Sima You Yue was safe and sound, his anxious heart gradually calmed down.\"That's right, why did you go to the fourth teleportation array and was even sent to some unknown location?\" Sima You Ming asked.\"This is a long story, let's head inside first before talking.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Okay!\"They walked into the hall and Sima You yue began to tell of her experiences after she sat down.\"Bang-\" After listening to the beginning of Sima You Yue's story, Sima Lie slapped the table, raging, \"There's actually a person who dares to harm you!\"\"I was just asking myself why you would enter that fourth teleportation array, so it was actually someone that pushed you in!\" Sima You Le said, \"We will go to the Academy tomorrow and drag that person out to let him know that there are some people in this world that you cannot offend!\"\"Cough-\u2026Cool down a bit\u2026 you all should not get so worked up.\" Sima You Yue saw that each and every single one of them looked like they were preparing for battle and helplessly rolled her eyes. \"Do you all want to continue listening to my story?\"\"Fifth Brother, continue speaking. Where did you get sent to?\"\"Pu Luo Mountain Range.\" Sima You Yue answered.\"What?!\"\"You had actually been sent to Pu Luo Mountain Range?! Then how come you're not injured or anything?\"\"You all should relax, I'm very healthy.\" Sima You Yue said with a smile.In order to prove that she was fine, she even stood up and moved a bit.\"Pu Luo Mountain Range has so many Spirit Beasts, most Spirit Masters won't dare to venture in on their own. You didn't encounter any dangerous situation right?\" Sima You Yue asked with worry.\"Fifth Brother, if you have any injuries, you definitely have to tell us!\"Sima You Ran looked at Sima You Yue and was worried that she was hiding something from them.Even they did not dare to lightly enter Pu Suo Mountain Range, to say nothing of Sima You Yue, who had just started cultivating as a Spirit Master.\"I'm really okay.\" Sima You Yue emphasised once again. Seeing how they didn't believe her, she could only call Ya Guang out for them.When Ya Guang came out, his Saint ranked power pressure filled the entire hall.\"Master.\" Ya Guang shrunk himself and came to Sima You Yue's side.\"This is the beast that I made a contract with when I was at Pu Luo Mountain Range. It's a Saint ranked Beast. Whenever I encountered any dangerous situation, it came to save me.\" In the face of their disbelief, Sima You Yue could only give all the credit to Ya Guang.Ya Guang looked at Sima You Yue. Every single time, she made it stay on the sidelines. It felt like he hadn't even done anything. Faced with Sima You Yue's threatening gaze, it could only lower its head silently.\"This Saint ranked Beast has not been tamed, how did you form a contract with it?\" Sima Lie looked at Ya Guang, his eyes filled with puzzlement mixed with amazement.\"When I first met it, it just happened to be injured by another Spirit Beast. It had escaped and collapsed by the river. After that, I rescued it and it took the initiative to make me its Master.\" Sima You Yue lied with a steady heart, without a hint of blush or remorse.What do you mean she saved Ya Guang, it was clear that the one she saved was Wu Lingyu!However, this is the manner in which she told the story and so this is what they heard. After all, explaining the story in this way still sounded very reasonable.\"That's right, I also saved a person on Pu Luo Mountain Range. After that, he gave me two pills as thanks. At that time, I really wanted to give it to grandfather!\" Sima You Yue took out two jade bottles and these bottles contained the rank advancement pills.She put the pills on Sima Lie's desk and then returned back to her place.\"What kind of pills are these?\" When Sima You Le saw the pills in the jade bottle, he was excited for a moment, so he asked curiously.\"These pills will help him to advance in rank.\" Sima You Yue said, \"Grandfather has been stuck at this bottleneck for such a long time, with these pills, Grandfather should be able to increase in rank.\"\"Really?!\" The other four brothers became extremely excited when they heard this.\"Grandfather, are these really Rank Advancement Pills?\" Sima You Ran asked.Sima Lie nodded his head, his eyes were moist.These Rank Advancement pills have been lost for a long time. He didn't know kind of person Sima You Yue had saved on the mountain that he would actually possess these kinds of pills!\"This is too fantastic!\" Sima You Ran brandished his fan, \"If Grandfather manages to increase in rank, we will no longer have to worry about the Nalan Clan coming over to look for trouble!\"\"What's up with the Nalan clan?\" Sima You Yue asked, \"Did something happen these four months when I wasn't around?\"\"Actually it's not really a situation.\" Sima You Ran explained, \"It's just that the Ancestor of the Nalan family has recently advanced in rank to become a Spirit Paragon, the same rank as Grandfather.\"\"This Nalan family has always come to compete with us, but because their strength was not on par with Grandfather's so they still held back a bit. However, since their ancestor had risen in rank, they became extremely unbridled; sooner or later, their b.u.t.ts were going to start sticking up in the air!\"\"Right now, as long as Grandfather can rise in rank, he will be able to pressure them one again. We'll see whether or not they will be able to remain as arrogant as before!\" Sima You Le said.\"Nalan clan\u2026\u2026\" Sima You Yue stretched out her hand and touched her chin, eyes s.h.i.+ning with a strange light.\"Since we have the pill, Grandfather should quickly go rise in rank.\" Sima You Qi said.\"That's true, tomorrow, I will head to the imperial palace to look for His Majesty to request for an absence of leave. After that, I will quickly come home and go into closed door cultivation.\" Sima Lie said. \"In this period of time, you all must be careful of any movement from the Nalan clan.\"\"We will, Grandfather please go into your closed door cultivation in peace.\" Sima You Ran said.\"Fifth brother, now that you've returned, do you still want to go back to the academy?\" Sima You Le asked.\"That Master of yours, Feng Zhi Xing, has constantly been worrying about you. Every few days, he will come over to ask about your situation.\"\"Master Feng?\" Sima You Yue never thought that he would actually care so much about her. She thought about it and said, \"I will wait for Grandfather to finished his closed door cultivation before returning back to the Academy. I still have some things that I want to do at home.\"\"Then tell me who is the person who hurt you. I will go and take revenge for you on your behalf!\" Sima You Le declared.\"No need. If I want to feel any joy, it definitely has to be me to take revenge on my own enemies. You all don't have to worry about this.\" Sima You Yue said, \"When I return back to the Academy, I will slowly play with her\u2026\u2026\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

However, he was momentarily been stunned in place when Sima You Yue appeared in the hall to greet him instead of Sima Lie.\"Master Feng, please sit.\" Sima You Yue smiled as she gestured with her hand, saying, \"Grandfather is currently busy and my few brothers are also busy settling some things so today I will be the one to receive you.\"\"You, you\u2026when did you come back?!\" Feng Zhi Xing quickly collected himself as he came to the chair and sat down in a daze, looking at Sima You Yue from head to toe, making sure that she was alright.Sima You Yue sat opposite him and patiently replied, \"I just came back last night.\"\"Where have you been this entire time?\" Feng Zhi Xing absentmindedly received a cup of tea served by the maid and lifted the cover but did not proceed on to drink.\"That teleportation array sent me to a mountain range very far away. After that, because of a few things, I was delayed for a period of time.\" Sima You Yue smiled as she said, \"I heard that Master Feng was very worried about me, I am touched by your concern.\"\"Since you've managed to return safely, all is well.\" Only after he heard Sima You Yue's reply and ascertained that she was alright did he let out a small sigh of relief and drank a mouthful of tea. After that, he placed the teacup back on the table and asked, \"So when do you think you want to come back to the Academy?\"\"There are some matters that I need to tend to first, and I may need a couple of days to settle them. Can I request for a leave of absence for a few days?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"Of course you can. I imagine that you've suffered quite a bit during the time that you were outside. You should rest at home properly for a while.\" Feng Zhi Xing speedily replied.\"Many thanks to Master Feng.\" Sima You Yue said, \"Oh right, I beseech Master Feng to help me keep the fact that I have returned, a secret.\" Her lips curved up at the ends.\"Alright.\" Feng Zhi Xing nodded his head, saying, \"Since you have returned safely, I will head back to the Academy first. Whenever you want to tell me about the things that have happened to you during this period of time, then tell me.\"After he finished speaking, he got up from his seat and left.Sima You Yue looked at Feng Zhi Xing's back and had some questions in her heart. However, she knew that if she were to go and ask him those questions now, he would not tell her the answers.After Feng Zhi Xing left the General's residence, he turned around and looked at it, muttering, \"She's finally back. She's even much stronger than she was before. She must have met with a fortuitous encounter.\"\"Master, this is great, you don't have to worry anymore.\" A voice inside his head sounded.\"Yep, no need to worry anymore\u2026\u2026\" He broke into a smile.Sima You Yue waited for Sima Lie to come back and personally sent him to a hidden room. Only after seeing the door to the hidden room close safely did she turn around and leave, returning to her own courtyard.\"Young master.\"Sima You Yue glanced at her two maids. Yesterday, when they had seen that she had returned, both of them were incomparably excited. It was unexpected that they were no longer as afraid of her as they were in the past.\"I want to stay in the room to cultivate. If there is nothing, please do not come and disturb me.\" Sima You Yue instructed.Because she had once used her interspatial ring in front of them, they already knew about the fact that she could cultivate. Furthermore, they had sworn their loyalty to her, so she had no desire to keep it from them.Afterall, they were her own people. It would be far more convenient if they knew about all her future plans.\"Yes.\"\"Sima You Yue went back to her own room and locked herself in. After that, she entered the Spirit Pearl.\"Little Spirit.\" She called out.\"What?\" Little Spirit appeared in midair\"Where is the Spirit Stone from that time?\" Sima You Yue wanted to have a look at the stone that Little Spirit had found as she wanted to study it a bit to see whether or not it was of any benefit to her soul.\"I actually thought that you had no interest towards this thing!\" After he said that, a jet black stone appeared in front of them.Sima You Yue held the Spirit Stone in her palm and said, \"This was the thing that caused us to be stuck in that Illusion Array for such a long time?\"\"That's right.\" Little Spirit nodded his head.\"Then does this things bring any benefit to my soul?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"It could at first, but not anymore.\" Little Spirit said.\"Why?\"\"Because a spirit has already gone on ahead to live inside.\" Little Spirit said.\"A spirit is living inside it?\" Sima You Yue lifted the Spirit stone high up, squinting her eyes to stare at it for a long while but did not notice anything special about it.\"You're really stupid, I already told you that there's a spirit living inside, how could you possibly see anything like this!\" Little Spirit was exasperated and cast her a contemptuous glance.\"Then how did you know that a spirit lives inside it?\" Sima You Yue asked puzzledly.\"I am the Sovereign of Spirit Stones, I was born with an innate capability to sensing spirits. Of course I would know that a spirit lives inside this stone!\" Little Spirit said.\"Fine then.\" Sima You Yue held the Spirit Stone in her hand and said, \"So you're saying that it's first come, first served, so I can't use this anymore.\"\"Something like that.\" Little Spirit replied, \"However, forming a contract with me couldn\u2019t even fully restore your Soul, so one or two of these Spirit Stones wouldn't help you much, either way.\"\"So what kind of spirit lives within?\" Sima You Yue swung that stone, wanting to fling that spirit awake.\"How would I know, he hasn't come out ever since he went in!\" Little Spirit used both hands to hug in front of its chest, inadvertently rolling its eyes when it saw what Sima You Yue was doing.\"Hey, the person inside, if you're awake then come and show your face outside!\" Sima You Yue shouted at the Spirit Stone.No reply\u2026\"If you don't come out, I'll throw you!\"Still no reply\u2026\"Fine then.\" Sima You Yue put the stone on the ground and called Ling Long out.\"Master, did you call Ling Long out because you miss Ling Long?\" Ling Long said with emotion as she appeared.\"I want you to change into a weapon.\" Sima You Yue said.\"What kind of weapon?\"\"Hammer.\"Ling Long pouted, as she transformed into a hammer\u2026After a short moment, a hammer appeared in Sima You Yue's hands.Seeing herself turn into something so ugly, Ling Long's heart was anguished. Did this girl really know about weapons? Why did she always make her turn into this kind of brute weapons!Sima You Yue tapped on the Spirit Stone with her hammer, saying, \"If you refuse to come out, I will break this stone to pieces, I'll see whether you can still remain inside.\"After saying this, she lifted the hammer hair in the air. Just as she was about to beat down on it, a voice chided, \"Stay your hand!\"\"Oh my, willing to talk now?\" Sima You Yue heard that voice and gave two evil laughs, saying, \"Your voice really is a bit scary, but this Lord doesn't get scared easily. I'll count to three. If you still don't come out, I will break it into pieces! 1, 2, 3\u2026\"Just as she was about to go through with it, a red colored mist stopped her from moving. After that, the mist turned into a faint image of a person.He had handsome features, a slender body and he looked to be about 20 over years old. His hair and clothes were fiery red, even his pupils were red. He really looked like an evildoer.\"My goodness, what kind of person it this? He looks just like a fireball!\" Sima You Yue had been scared by the person who had just appeared in front of her.\"Ignorant human, you have a lot of guts!\" That red silhouette looked at Sima You Yue and his body gave off an aura that was both grand and oppressive.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

I didn't that you were actually from the Devil Clan. However, why would someone from the Devil Clan end up living here, even wandering over to this place?\"\"Hmph! Listening to the mockery behind Sima You Yue's word, the man immediately turned his head to the side.\"What is your name?\" Sima You Yue asked.He ignored her\u2026\"I can't call you heyheyhey forever, right? Or else I would be treating you like a cat or dog.\" Sima You Yue said.The man pouted, saying, \"Mo Sha.\"'Mo Sha\u2026\u2026 As expected, it's a Devil's [\u9b54- Mo] name. Sima You Yue said, \"That time was it you who set up that Illusion Array?\"Silence.There was no way of confirming it with him.\"Looks like it was.\" Sima You Yue said, \"A person like me has many plans for revenge. Towards someone like you, who has locked me inside that Illusion Array for such a long time, how do you think I will settle this grievance?\"While speaking, she used her hammer to knock lightly against the Spirit Stone in her hand.Mo Sha looked at what Sima You Yue was doing and his gaze turned dark. He suppressed his anger and said, \"How do you want to settle it?\"\"The fact that you are in charge of this little stone shows that you are stronger that the average person. Shouldn't you give me some benefits?\" Sima You Yue said lazily.Mo Sha looked at Sima You Yue for a long time, his gaze also slowly started to clear. After a little longer, he opened his mouth to speak, \"You want some benefits, this isn't impossible. But you have to promise me one thing.\"\"What?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"Before I find my physical body, I want to stay here.\" Mo Sha said.\"This is no problem.\" Sima You Yue nodded.This Spirit Pearl was so big, it would be no problem no matter how many stones of this kind were placed inside.\"I haven't finished.\" Mo Sha said.\"Then you should continue.\" Sima You Yue touched her chin as she watched him while she pondered about what kind of benefits he would be able to bring to her.\"You have to help me find my physical body!\" Mo Sha said indistinctly.\"You wis.h.!.+\" Sima You Yue could not help but cry out when she heard it, saying, \"The heavens and the earth are vast, where would I go to find your physical body? I don't even know how to go to your Devil Realm!\"\"My physical body may not necessarily be in the Devil Realm.\" Mo Sha said.\"Why?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"At that time, when my soul was forcibly separated, half of it entered this place while another half has probably reincarnated.\" Mo Sha said, \"However, my reincarnation may not necessarily be from the Devil Race.\"\"Then wouldn't I be even more at a loss of where I should go to find it!\" Sima You Yue said.\"Even if you cannot find it, you still have have to try. If I help you do things, it's obvious that you have to repay me sufficiently!\" Mo Sha said.\"First tell me what the benefit is, see whether it's capable of enticing me to agree to your demands.\" Sima You Yue's eyes were spinning as she said.\"Imperial Art of Beast Taming.\" Mo Sha said indifferently.\"Imperial Art of Beast Taming?\" Little Spirit was at a corner when he shouted out, \"That's a really good thing, Master you must quickly agree!\"\"It's just the Imperial Art of Beast Taming. Although Beast Tamers are rare, there's no need for me to know this thing before I can become a Beast Tamer. Since I have to do so many things in return, it's not worth it.\" Sima You Yue shook her head as she said.\"The Imperial Art of Beast Taming is something from the ancient times!\" Mo Sha said.\"From the ancient times?\" Sima You Yue narrowed her eyes at Mo Sha, saying, \"So what?\"\"Are you stupid, the Beast Tamers right now all use such simplistic methods, they only know how to tame the beasts. The Imperial Art of Beast Taming is more powerful than those methods by more than a hundred times!\" Little Spirit pulled Sima You Yue to a side, saying, \"My ex ex ex master had spent his entire life searching for the Imperial Art of Beast Taming, but until he died, he never managed to find it.\"\"Is it really that great?\" Sima You Yue could not believe it.\"Of course it's great!\" Little Spirit affirmed, \"The most important thing is, this Imperial Art of Beast Taming has been lost for a long time and is completely impossible to find right now.\"Mo Sha looked at Sima You Yue and Little Spirit muttering to each other at the same and knitted his eyebrows together, saying, \"Quickly make your decision!\"\"Fine then.\" Sima You Yue hugged Little Spirit and ma.s.saged him twice, saying, \"Let's do it according to what you've said. The deal is complete!\"\"Good!\" He had barely finished speaking when he floated in front of Sima You Yue, giving her a kiss on the lips when she was off guard.\"What are you doing?!\" Although there was no physical feeling, Sima You Yue still retreated a step back, glaring at Mo Sha.\"Sealing the deal!\" Mo Sha said, \"This is the way we do it in our Devil Clan.\"\"Then there's no need for you to do this!\" Sima You Yue said with a black face.\"I'm just a Spirit right now, this is the only thing I can do.\" Mo Sha said.Sima You Yue had rage that she could not release and could only forcefully wipe her lips, causing her lips to become even redder.\"What about that Imperial Art of Beast Taming that you talked about?\" She glared daggers at Mo Sha as she asked.Mo Sha looked over at her red lips and entered the Spirit Stone, saying, \"Put this Spirit Stone on your forehead.\"Sima You did what he said. When the Spirit Stone came into contact with her forehead, she felt that something had entered into her brain, causing it to hurt. It was only after a long while that she recovered.\"This jerk must have done it on purpose!\" She said, as she held her forehead\"Master, quickly try out that Imperial Art of Beast Taming!\" Little Spirit said.\"Okay.\" Sima You Yue closed her eyes. She only felt that her brain contained some information that she never had before. Her brain was currently appeared to contain a book, and on its cover the words 'Imperial Art of Beast Taming' were inscribed in gold.When she had organised that information, she realised that this information was definitely of a higher quality. The most impressive thing was that the Spirit Beast that used the Imperial Art of Beast Taming, when he had formed a contract with its owner, it could increase its own strength. Further, in the future when the owner had increased in rank, the Spirit Beast would also increase in rank.\"d.a.m.n, it can actually increase in rank. This is something I've never heard of before!\" Sima You Yue called out after she had finished reading it.This Art of Beast Taming is very simple, it uses the same method as other methods of Beast Taming but because taming a Spirit Beast required a lot of Spirit Energy so only when she had increased her own Spirit Energy would she be able to tame higher ranked Spirit Beasts.\"We should try catching a Spirit Beast with this.\" Sima You Yue said happily.\"Don't forget about our agreement!\" Mo Sha said from the Spirit Stone.\"I know!\" Sima You Yue frowned, saying, \"You have this kind of ancient thing and you could even live within this small spirit stone for so many years. You must have been a very powerful person in the past. Why don't you tell me what your ident.i.ty was, it'll be easier for me to look for your you based on your ident.i.ty and status!\"\"When I meet him, I will be drawn towards him. I will naturally tell you when that time comes!\" After saying this, he refused to say anything more. The Spirit Stone also stopped s.h.i.+ning.\"Tsk-\" Sima You Yue threw the Spirit Stone over to Little Spirit, saying, \"Help me keep this safe.\"Little Spirit wished it away, and the Spirit Stone disappeared in front of them.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Then would I have many pills to eat in the future?\" The moment Little Spirit heard what Sima You Yue said, its eyes started to s.h.i.+ne.\"Do you really like to eat pills?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"I do!\" Little Spirit nodded his head, saying, \"I've already eaten all the pills that my previous master had left for me, that's why there are no pills inside the Spirit Pearl.\"Eh-Sima You Yue had her suspicions long ago. Since there was an owner who used to be an Alchemist, it was strange that the Spirit Pearl didn't even have a single pill! So it was this guy who that had eaten them all!\"Master, I'll take you to go look for the books.\" Little Spirit said as he pulled Sima You Yue and they disappeared. In the blink of an eye, they appeared inside a house.\"Master, all the books in here about books on pill refinement, this is the collection that belongs to the previous Master. I've heard him say before that there are many books that belong to the ancient times! There are also many methods of pill refinement that have gone extinct.\" Little Spirit said at it pointed towards the house full of books.Sima You Yue took a look at the books inside the room. There were piles of it that filled a room. No need to mention ten thousand, there were hundreds and thousands of them.\"There are so many books, do you know which ones are for beginners?\" Sima You Yue asked.Little Spirit shook his head. He had never read these books before, how would he know.'Oh, right!\" Little Spirit thought of something and suddenly disappeared from within the house. When he had reappeared, his was holding on to a pill furnace.\"Master, this is the pill furnace that the previous Master left behind. After reading these books, you can use this pill furnace. If you need any pill ingredients, you can find them everywhere in the ground outside. The previous master had gathered so many different kinds and I've preserved them all.\"It was the first time that Little Spirit had been so warm towards her. Sima You Yue's mouth pulled into a smile. This guy appeared to love anything related to pills.After taking a look at the bookshelves, which filled the whole house, she decided to first look for the books that catered to the beginner before doing anything else.So she spent the remaining time to look over the books in the house once over, taking out all the books that were suitable for a beginner. After that, she took them to the table and began to read earnestly.Actually, the method of pill refining was actually not difficult. It was basically divided into 3 steps, purifying, fusing and binding. However, these 3 steps stumped thousands upon thousands of Spirit Masters.Purifying- this was done by purifying the essence of the pill ingredients. One needed attentiveness and patience in order to do this.Fusing sounded easy. It was done by fusing the purified essences of the pills together. This step may seem easy, however, each pill had its own fusion sequence. One had to pay particular attention to what ingredient went in at what time. It was not like you could just pour all the ingredients together.Furthermore, if one could not master it well, there was a chance that it might even explode. Besides wasting pill ingredients, it was also dangerous for the Alchemist.The third step was the most important step of all, Binding.If the previous two steps were successful, but the binding stage was not, the final product would only be medicine, at best. Although medicine had its uses, when compared to a pill, the difference was like a hundred thousand times.Furthermore, binding required one to wait until all the essences had pretty much fused together before pouring one's Spirit energy into the pill furnace, turning the medicine into a pill. This step really tested a person's mental strength. If one did not control it well, all the efforts that had been put in earlier would be completely wasted.As a result, although pill refinement looked easy, those who could really become Alchemists were few and far between.Not to mention the fact that pill refinement still needed two very important elements- pill furnace and fire.The pill furnace was easy to explain, it was obvious that a better pill furnace would have an increased rate of success.With regards to fire, there were many different types. Firewood Flame, Spirit Beast Life Flame, Deviant Flame, Spirit flame.The first one was self explanatory. The second Spirit Beast Life Flame was done by asking a Spirit Beast to provide aid while one was refining pills. Because of their contract, their Master could very quickly order the Spirit Beast to control the intensity of the flame. If it was their own Spirit Beast, the Master could directly control the Spirit Beast Life Flame.This was the fire that the majority of Alchemists used. However, the problem with using these flames were that their quality was not high. Also, they required contractual Spirit Beasts in order to work.The third type of fire was Deviant Flame. This kind of flames was generated between Heaven and Earth. It had a spiritual nature. If one could control it, the success of pill refinement would exponentially increase.However, controlling this kind of Deviant Flame was really difficult because one had to absorb the Deviant Flame into their body before pouring it into the Pill Furnace. If one was not cautious and was devoured by the Deviant Flame, he would be burnt to death.For the fourth kind of flame, not much was written about it. It could possibly be because this kind of flame was simply too mysterious.When Sima You Yue had finished reading the Pill Refinement procedures, she realised that it was something that really required endurance. Although she lacked money and men in this current life, what she did not lack was patience.And so she began to practice the first step of Pill Refinement, Purifying.She followed the methods written in the books with utmost precision, after that, she eagerly ran towards the medicine field to look for a few pill ingredients. When she came to the pill room, she took the pill furnace that Little Spirit had found for her earlier and began her closed door training.After two days, aside from coming outside to obtain some pill ingredients, Sima You Yue remained inside the alchemy room. For a period of time, the sounds pingpingpingping sounded non stop.The Spirit Beasts inside the Spirit Pearl all ran over and waited outside the alchemy room.\"Will Master be able to refine any pills?\" Ya Guang asked as he looked towards the pill room.\"Of course!\" Little Roar, who rolling around on Ya Guang's back, affirmed when he heard Ya Guang's question.\"Little Yue Yue is so smart, she'll definitely be able to refine them successfully.\" Ling Long's body floated in mid air. She had one leg crossed over the other with both hands behind her head, looking as if she was sleeping on top of a bed.\"She definitely has to succeed! Then I will be able to have many Candy Drops to eat.\" Little Spirit said.\"Candy Drops?\"\"I'm talking about pills. I used to call them Candy Drops.\" Little Spirit said.\"Boom-\" During the pause in the conversation between Little Spirit and the rest, the sound of an explosion sounded from inside the pill room. The shock sent them scurrying inside for a look.\"Yue Yue, are you okay?\" Little Roar was the first one to enter. He saw the room full of smoke with Sima You Yue's silhouette faintly discernable in the centre of it.\"Master, what happened?\" Ya Guang and the rest rushed inside and asked when they saw what remained of the door.The smoke in the house gradually dispersed, leaving the room in the mess. Not just the table, but also the floor and even the walls had been scattered with remainders of the pill ingredients as a result of the explosion.Sima You Yue stood in the centre of the house. When it had exploded, she managed to protect her face, but her hair had turned into an afro because of the explosion. Her clothes had also been shredded.\"Wawawa, I'm so sad!\" Little Spirit saw the state of the house and cried out loudly.\"What's wrong, Little Spirit?\" The other could not understand what was wrong with Little Spirit.\"Other people would only cause an explosion during the fusion process, but Master was just purifying the pills when it exploded. This shows that she can't refine pills at all. I have no more Candy Drops to eat anymore, sob, I'm so depressed.\" Little Spirit cried.Little Roar and the rest looked at the charred Sima You Yue.

His eyes were excited and sparkling when he looked at her and asked: \"If it didn\u2019t explode at the purifying stage, you mean to say that it was at the fusion stage?\"\"Yeah!\" She touched her own face, but this had actually made the only clean spot on her black now.\"How could it be? You\u2019ve only just started pill refining just a few days back. How could you possibly advance to the next stage so quickly?\" Little Spirit continued on, \"I remembered my Alchemist Master once said that the average person takes one month to get the bare basics of purifying, being able to be an apprentice is already a blessing on its own. It also took twenty over talents to finally advance to the stage after they had practiced non stop. You took such a short time\u2026 how could you\u2026\"\"Others take such a long time?\" Sima You Yue was shocked when she heard Little Spirit's explanation. \"How could they take such a long time? It\u2019s so easy, I took only two days.\"\"Two days?!\" All the Spirit Beasts in the room all cried out in shock.She took only two days while the average person took a month. This difference was too heaven defying and everyone looked at her as if she were a monster.\"Yeah, after I came in, I took two days to extract the essence and I spent the remaining days practicing it over and over as a revision. Afterwards, I studied the pill recipes and realized that I just had the ingredients for a certain pill and decided to try my hand at it. It was fine in the beginning, however when I tried to mix the two essences together, it suddenly exploded.\"At this point of time, Little Spirit was too excited to speak and was trembling and holding tightly onto Sima You Yue's shoulder. Only after a long while did he speak. \"Initially, I thought that you were a complete waste in Alchemy. Hah! It turns out that you are a genius! No! A devil more like it! Ha ha ha ha ha! Yay! I finally have Candy Drops to eat! This is really great!\"Sima You Yue was speechless, how did this guy give her the feeling that she was a candy dispenser?\"Alright, I'm going to head off to shower first, I will come back later to clean up and a.n.a.lyze the reason for the explosion.\" She said.\"There's no need, no need!\" Little Spirit broke out into a smile as he spoke to her in a flattering tone. \"You just go and take a good bath and a.n.a.lyze what went wrong, leave the cleaning up to me!\"Since someone had offered to help, she was definitely more than willing to take up on the offer. Little Spirit went off to prepare the bath for her and she happily went to take a bath.\"In the end, where did I go wrong?\" In the wooden bath tub, she was leaning her head against the edge of the tub and staring at the ceiling as she retraced the steps she did during the refinement process in her mind.Her steps were definitely right, the order in which she added the essences in were also correct\u2026 These two points, she was very sure so it meant that the problem did not lie in these two places.\"If that's the case, it should have been the purity of the essences and the temperature control.\" She murmured to herself. \"It seems that I need to practice more on the purifying and my flame control.\"After the bath, Sima You Yue went to the alchemy room and saw that it had been cleaned up nicely. She couldn\u2019t help but praise Little Spirit's actions and devotion.But she also forgot that in here, it was the Spirit Pearl and all Little Spirit needed to do was to just use a single thought to have the room back to what it was before.This time round, she did not start refining immediately but instead went to pick up a book on alchemy and started to make references to what she did previously and only after ensuring that there was no mistakes in the steps and tweaking some parts did she try her hand again and started extracting the essences from the herbs.After she had calmed her heart and concentrated on extracting all the various essences, she found that there was a huge improvement in the purity of the extracted essences.\"Master, there\u2019s movement outside.\" Little Spirit suddenly appeared beside Sima You Yue and informed her.\"Is Grandfather out of his closed door cultivation?\" She asked.To prevent any accidents, during this time she was practicing her alchemy, she had Little Spirit keep track of the outside.\"It should be, I feel that there's a fluctuation on the Spirit Energies outside. It feels like someone has just advanced in rank.\"Once she heard that, Sima You Yue immediately put everything down and with a thought, she was back in her room.When she opened the door, she saw her two maids guarding her door. \"Why are two of you here?\"\"Back to Young Master, we have waited many days and you did not come out. Hence, we thought that you may be cultivating inside so we've been guarding the door, lest someone disturbs you.\"Sima You Yue did not think that they were so diligent and smiled warmly: \"Thank you, I\u2019m out now so go on and rest.\"She proceeded on and headed over to her grandfather's study and found the entrance to the tunnel and groped her way down to the hidden room.Once she was outside the hidden room, she stood outside, waiting for her grandfather.Ever since she had undergone that baptism with Crimson Flame's fire, her perception to the spirit fluctuations in the air was overly sensitive. Other people might not have sensed the changes in the spirit fluctuations, but she was able to determine the increase in Fire Spiritual Qi in the hidden room.After half an hour pa.s.sed, Sima You Yue felt the Fire Spiritual Qi began to stabilize and knew that the advancement was over.Sure enough, the doors to the hidden room opened and Sima Lie stepped out.\"Grandfather!\" Sima You Yue went up to him and smiled. \"Congratulations on advancing a rank!\"\"Hahaha! This was possible all thanks to the two advancement pills you gave me.\" Sima Lie was surprised that Sima You Yue was outside waiting for him and he froze a moment before he laughed out heartily. \"How did you know that I was coming out?\"I could sense the Spiritual Qi fluctuations in the air and guessed that Grandfather had successfully advanced, so I came to welcome you!\" She said as she smiled sweetly, beaming with pride.\"You can actually sense the Spiritual Qi fluctuations from my rank advancement?\" He was very surprised when he heard that.If it was someone else who had sensed it, he wouldn't be able to hide his own rank.\"Grandfather, you can rest a.s.sured that other people would not be able to sense it.\" She rea.s.sured him, \"Before I came in, I had Little Roar surround whole area with a barrier so no one would be able to sense it.\"\"Little Roar?\"\"That's me, Grandfather!\" Little Roar flew in and strutted in front of Sima Lie as if boasting on his own appearance.Sima Lie was inwardly shocked when heard that. What kind of Spirit Beast was this? Not only could it talk, it could even set up barriers? Before, when he saw Sima You Yue carry it, he thought that it was a spirit beast that she had purchased from outside to keep as a mere pet.\"Although Little Roar has no fighting abilities, he's top notch when it comes to setting up barriers.\" Sima You Yue continued introducing Little Roar to her Grandfather, \"So you can rest a.s.sured, grandfather.\"She had ensured that Little Roar set up a barrier so that no one could detect the Spiritual Qi fluctuations. She had thought it through, in her previous life, she had climbed so high with her own powers and yet that had brought about the jealousy of others. If she had remained low-key, then she wouldn't have gained the jealousy of the second in charge and even died from that.\"Alright, let's go out and show my brothers your achievement! When they know that you have advanced in rank, they will be so happy!\" Sima You Yue grabbed his arms and led him out cheerfully.However, back in the Imperial Academy's office, despite Little Roar's barrier, a silhouette was sitting by the window and looked in the direction of the General's Residence and faintly said: \"Was this the thing you said that you had to settle? Since the matter is already resolved, when will you come back\u2026?\"Chapter 52: \"A Waste? A Devil More Like It!\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Sima You Qi, Sima You Ming and Sima You Le had all came back, knowing that Sima You Lie had successfully advanced in rank. Everyone was exceedingly excited.At night, Sima You Yue cooked an entire table of dishes for everyone in a moment of happiness. When she stepped out of the kitchen, she saw the four of them sitting at the sides of the table, all of them staring at her with faces full of surprise. She stared back blankly because she realised that she, in her extreme happiness, forgot that the original owner of this body did not know how to cook. The previous time where she said that she had taught the chefs how to cook, they had thought that she had just listened to some rumors. However, this time, she was the one who had made these dishes by hand!\"Fifth brother, when did you learn how to cook?\" Sima You Le was the first one to ask.Sima You Yue went to her own seat and sat down, saying, \"Wasn't I living on Pu Luo Mountain Range for a few months? At that time I was the only one who could cook for myself, so I had to learn it.\"Listening to what Sima You Yue said, everyone looked at her with pain in their hearts, thinking that she must definitely have suffered so much on Pu Luo Mountain Range, so much so that she even had to learn something as complex as cooking.Sima You Yue felt a bit guilty when she looked at the expression on everyone's faces. She had just wanted to dodge the question of her learning cooking. She never expected that she would cause heartache.She smiled and said, \"Alright, let's quickly eat. If we wait any longer it will get cold and it won't be delicious anymore.\"\"Yes, let's eat. Let's see how Fifth Brother's dishes are.\"\"Mmhmm, let's eat!\"\"Come, let's give a toast to Grandfather, congratulating him on advancing a rank smoothly.\"\"Haha, for this, we have to give thanks to You Yue for bringing back that advancement pill.\"Talking about Sima Lie's advancement, everyone's spirits were lifted once again as they ate and drank until late at night.\"\"Grandfather, I think I will return to the Academy tomorrow.\" Sima You Yue said after dinner ended.\"It's good for to be the one to decide how to settle your own problems.\" Sima Lie patted Sima You Yue's head, \"You're going to Academy in order to find the ones who hurt you that day and to exact revenge?\"Sima You Yue nodded, saying, \"I'm not the kind of person who asks you whether or not your hands hurts after you've given me a slap. If you want to hurt me, you better prepare to figure out how to receive my revenge!\"\"Haha, no matter what you decide to do, Grandfather will definitely support you. If you need anything from me or from your brothers, all you need to do is to ask.\" Sima Lie said.\"Yup, I will.\" Sima You Yue smiled as she said.She looked towards the direction of the Academy as her mouth twisted into a malicious smile. Who knew what kind of reaction those people who had thought she already died would have once they saw her.Returning back to her own courtyard, Sima You Yue locked herself back inside her house once again to cultivate. Although she really wanted to go and practice refining pills, she also knew that one should not try to run before they learnt how to walk. She knew that she did not have enough experience extracting the essences from the herbs yet, so if she hastily tried to fuse them together, she would only end up causing another explosion like the previous time. Even if she had somehow managed to successfully refine out medicinal pills, its quality would also not be that good.Furthermore, what she needed the most right now was to cultivate. Little Roar said that before she reached Divine Rank, there was a chance that she would be able to recover her memories. She was currently only a mere Spirit Lord, who knew how long it would take before she finally reached Divine Rank. She needed to make full use of every second.Inside the Imperial Academy , for the first month that Sima You Yue had gone missing, everyone was still heavily gossiping about it. They were guessing when the General's residence would come to the Academy to make trouble. Who would have thought that not even a single shadow was sent from the general's residence.After more than a month had pa.s.sed, everyone had lost interest in gossiping about it and very few people even remembered that waste.Today, after they had finished their morning cla.s.ses, everyone was walking around after their lunch.The two people, Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi, had come back. Seeing that the main gate was unlocked, they still thought that Ouyang Fei or Bei Gong Tang had returned first.\"These two guys, they ran off right after cla.s.s. We didn't even see them at the canteen just now, so it turns out they had rushed back here first.\" Fatty Qu said.\"Yup, ever since we ate the food that You Yue cooked for us, the food at the canteen seems too disgusting to eat.\" Wei Zi Qi's face fell as he talked about Sima You Yue.\"You Yue, He\u2026\" Fatty Qu's voice was also a bit hoa.r.s.e.The only ones in Academy who would still talk about Sima You Yue would only be these two people.\"What are you guys doing, standing at the door?\" Bei Gong Tang's cold voice came from behind them, interrupting them in the midst of their pain.Wei Zi Qi turned around and looked at Bei Gong Tang, saying, \"Didn't you go in? We thought that you had already come back.\"\"Nope, I went to the library.\" Bei Gong Tang stepped forward two steps and looked at the two of them suspiciously. After that, she pushed the door open to enter.\"When will this Bei Gong Tang ever smile? Whenever we see her, she's always so cold.\" Fatty Qu said agitatedly.\"Yup, her smile will definitely be beautiful.\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"Are you trying to be gatekeepers by standing at the door?\" Ouyang Fei came from behind and said, when he saw the two of them standing at the door without entering.After living together for a period of time, although they did not like to talk to each other, but they had already grown less cold as compared to the time when they had just gotten to know each other.\"Sigh, this guy, he's really\u2026.\" Fatty Qu was talking halfway when he suddenly turned to look at Wei Zi QI and saw that his eyes, similarly, contained traces of surprise.The two of them had just returned and thought that the main door had been opened by Bei Gong Tang or Ouyang Fei. However, they realised now that these two had only returned after them. This must mean that the one who was was able to use a key to open the door, it must be\u2026 Sima You Yue?!!\"This must mean that he has returned?The two of them quickly entered the house. The moment they entered, they saw Ouyang Fei standing at the the house while Bei Gong Tang was standing in front of Sima You Yue's door. The door that had always been tightly shut was actually opened today!They only saw Sima You Yue stick out her head from inside the house, smirking towards the four surprised people, \"You've all come back. I'm just tidying the house. It's been so long since someone has lived here so the dust is really thick.\"Fatty Qu pointed at Sima You Yue and found that he could not speak in proper sentences.\"You\u2026. you\u2026 when did you return?!\"Sima You Yue completely walked out and laughed, \"I just returned. Fatty Qu, you don't have any afternoon cla.s.ses right? Want to help me pack my place up?\"After that, she looked at the three people, including Bei Gong Tang, and said, \"This place is really too dirty. It also seems to have been smashed by someone. It's so messy, why don't you all wait until it's been packed up before coming over again to sit down?\"It was only at this point that they four of them had any real reaction. Wei Zi Qi rolled up his sleeves and walked over saying, \"It really is very dirty, let us clean it up together.\"\"RIght, I'll help out too.\" Fatty Qu said as he walked over.Sima You Yue looked at Wei Zi Qi take initiative to help and smiled, \"Alright, having you guys to help will let us pack it up quicker.\"But what was even more strange was that Ouyang Fei and Bei Gong Tang had also come in to help. Although the two of them still looked really cold, she had always taken the two of them to be inflicted with some kind of facial nerve paralysis. She will still surprised that they had came forward to help them out.\"It really seems as if someone had broken in here!\" Fatty Qu said helplessly as he threw his glance towards the mess.The five of them packed up together and the place was quickly tidied up. After that, Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi sat together while Ouyang Fei leaned on the table and Bei Gong Tang was near the door. Four of them simultaneously looked towards Sima You Yue.\"You Yue, where did the Teleportation Array send you that time?\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

First listen to what You Yue has to say.\"\"Meng Ting?\" Ouyang Fei looked towards Sima You Yue.Meng Ting was the only one who had any form of enmity towards her this in this period of time. It was not strange for everyone to put the blame on her.Sima You Yue shook her head and said, \"Not her.\"\"Not her? Then who else wishes to harm you?\" Fatty Qu said, \"I've also heard some people say that people who entered in the past rarely survived to come out.\"Thinking back on how she had seen all those skeletons back in the Illusion Array, it truly was a place of no return. Furthermore, if they had, like her, been sent to Pu Luo Mountain Range, chances of survival would drop even further.\"Yup, the number of people who wish to harm me are not few.\" Sima You Yue said, \"But the one who I believe pushed me inside is not the main schemer, the person is just a henchman. The one I wish to find is the one who hides behind that person.\"\"The one who hides behind?\" Wei Zi Qi and Fatty Qu looked at Sima You Yue.\"When that time comes, it's possible that I'll need your help.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Alright.\" Bei Gong Tang sounded in reply before turning to leave.Ouyang Fei also nodded before he left.Sima You Yue saw the two of them leave before sighing, \"These two are still as cold as before!\"\"They've already gotten a lot better. At the very least, they helped you to clean up this place and were concerned about what happened to you. If this was in the past, I'm afraid these two would have directly returned back to their houses, not even caring about what happened.\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"Yup, I also did not expect the two of them to stay behind to help me tidy up this place.\" Sima You Yue said, \"However, how would my place become like this? It looked like it had been completely thrashed!\"\"It truly is strange.\" Fatty Qu said, \"When something had happened to you, none of us had entered your room so we did not realise that your place had become like this. Did you lose anything?\"\"I lost a few ornaments.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Then it must be that someone had broken in when we went to cla.s.s.\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"Yup, the things that were lost were not particularly expensive or precious.\" Sima You Yue said.\"You Yue, now that you're back, you definitely would shock the one who had harmed you that time!\" Fatty Qu rubbed his hands together in glee, ready for action. Thinking of what would happen when Sima You Yue was seen by people, his face revealed an exceedingly excited expression.\"Yup, I also want to see what kind of expression those people would have.\" Sima You Yue smiled.\"Right, does Master Feng know that you've returned?\" Wei Zi Qi asked.\"He doesn't know that I've returned to the school compound.\" Sima You Yue thought of Feng Zhi Xing and pursed her lips. Grandfather had told her that in this period of time, he had been very concerned about her. Even though his actions were a bit strange in the past, thinking about it now, he must not have had any evil intentions. \"I will go look for him at the office later.\"\"Alright, then you should go and rest first. We'll go back first.\"Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi both stood up to leave.Little Roar, who had been silently lying down on the table finally opened his eyes, looked at Sima You Yue and said, \"The four of them were really concerned about you!\"\"How do you know?\"Little Roar stretched lazily and said, \"Who am I? I am Divine Roar, an Ancient Sacred Beast! I am especially sensitive towards people's emotions.\"Sima You Yue smiled, she had also felt it. This time, their gazes revealed astonishment and joy. Their very first reaction was from the heart, even Bei Gong Tang's eyes momentarily flashed with joy.\"Let's go up and rest then go look for Master Feng later.\" After she said this, she picked up Little Roar from the desk and headed upstairs.There were no afternoon cla.s.ses so Fatty Qu and the rest were all cultivating inside their own rooms. Sima You Yue went to Fend Zhi Xing's office alone.\"Knock knock-\"Feng Zhi Xing was currently meditating. Hearing the knock on the door, both his eyes opened as he said unhurriedly, \"Enter.\"Sima You Yue pushed opened the door and bowed to Feng Zhi Xing, saying, \"Master Feng, I have come to report.\"\"You're ready to return to cla.s.ses?\" Feng Zhi Xing looked at Sima You Yue as he smiled and indicated for her to sit at a chair on the side.\"That's right, I've already settled my business at home and so I have come back to cla.s.s.\" Sima You Yue looked at the chair but still chose to continue standing.When she faced Feng Zhi Xing, she always had some insurmountable feeling. She knew that this person in front of her was definitely extremely strong. The stronger she grew, she stronger she felt he was.\"Good, then you may begin attending cla.s.ses tomorrow.\" Feng Zhi Xing nodded without saying anything else.\"If there's nothing else, I will take my leave first.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Wait.\" Feng Zhi Xing called for her to stop, \"The princ.i.p.al knows that you've returned and feels a bit curious about where the Teleportation Array has sent you. He wishes for you to pay him a visit once you've returned. Follow me.\"After Feng Zhi Xing said this, he bought Sima You Yue to the princ.i.p.al's office.This was the first time that Sima You Yue had met the princ.i.p.al. Sima Lie had told her before that he was good friends with the princ.i.p.al and that if she had any problems she could always go and look for her. So she had the impression that the princ.i.p.al must have been someone similar to Sima Lie.However, the moment she saw him, she realised that this princ.i.p.al was completely different from her own grandfather.Sima Lie gave off some kind of soldier's aura, imperceptibly giving others a kind of pressure, while this princ.i.p.al gave others a very easy-going feel, as if he had no constrictions.The princ.i.p.al looked at Sima You Yue and was not surprised, he just peacefully asked her some questions regarding what happened to her during the period of time where she had gone missing.Sima You Yue merely answered simply that she had been sent to Pu Luo Mountain Range, that it was merely on the fringes and that she had had been rescued by a group of people when she was in danger then finally followed them to wander around the place for a few months.Feng Zhi Xing and the princ.i.p.al did not call her any of her words into question, although they also did not fully believe it. They just wanted to see that she had safely returned.Leaving the princ.i.p.al's office, Sima You Yue still thought of how, when she was leaving, she saw Feng Zhi Xing patting her head. It felt as if he was patting the head of his junior. Because she was too lost in thought, she had not paid attention to what was in front of her and when she left the office, she b.u.mped into a person who was rus.h.i.+ng in.\"Ah, who's this person who did not open their eyes! Do you want to die!\" The person who had been b.u.mped into shouted. After looking at her clearly, she stammered, \"It\u2019s\u2026 it's you?!\"Sima You Yue looked at He Qiu Zhi, who had become so arrogantly merely after not seeing her for a few months. She thought of how she had always carefully stood behind Meng Ting, yet now she had become so imposing.It looked like the person backing her had really made her life great recently.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

I knew that it was impossible for someone like you to die.\" Meng Ting glanced at Sima You Yue and although these words did not sound that nice, Sima You Yue still heard a trace of concern within them.Wow, this one actually was concerned about her? Then it should not have been her who instigated He Qiu Zhi to cause her harm?She glanced at the He Qiu Zhi who was standing beside and He Qu Zhi subconsciously took a step back, thinking that she wanted to expose her.However, Sima You Yue, contrary to her expectations, smiled and ignored her. She looked at everyone else and asked, \"How come you have all gathered here?\"\"We're all here to ballot.\" Meng Ting replied.\"Ballot?\"Looking at Sima You Yue's confusion, the cla.s.s monitor Shen An walked over. He said, \"In this period of time, we are beginning to receive a.s.signments from school. Now we are going to ballot to get the a.s.signment for our groups.\"Sima You Yue thought of how Sima You Ran and Sima You Le seemed to always go out for a.s.signments and nodded her head after understanding clearly. She unexpectedly asked: \"Then, do I have to go with you all to ballot?\"Shen An shook his head and replied, \"You don't have to ballot, your group has already decided on its a.s.signment.\"\"Hmm?\"\"Regarding that, you should go back and ask Wei Zi Qi and the rest then you will know.\"\"Oh, okay.\" Sima You You nodded her head. Since that was what he had said, all she needed to do was to go back and ask. \"Then I will return back, you all can carry on balloting first.\"After she said this, she glanced over at He Qiu Zhi, who was standing silently as the side, once again. She smiled maliciously for a moment before leaving.\"Let's go, we will go over to where Master Feng is.\" Shen An urged everyone to walk towards Feng Zhi Xing's office. When He Qiu Zhi saw everyone leave, she looked towards Sima You Yue's back and thought of the gaze Sima You Yue had when he was leaving. Her heart suddenly rose to her throat.She was definitely sure that when Sima You Yue was entering the teleportation, he had confirmed that she the one who had pushed him. Looking at how he was not exposing her right now, he definitely was plotting something evil.Thinking of how the General's residence was backing Sima You Yue, she was so afraid that she broke out into a cold sweat. If they came to seek revenge, she definitely would not even be enough for him to play with.No way, she definitely had to find them to protect her!A mere moment had pa.s.sed before He Qiu Zhi's heart started to waver and falter.\"Qiu Zhi, aren't you coming?\" Meng Ting shouted when she saw He Qiu Zhi just standing there.\"Coming.\" He Qiu Zhi raised her skirt slightly and chased after them.Sima You Yue returned back to her courtyard and immediately headed towards Fatty Qu's house.\"Fatty Qu, Fatty Qu!\" Sima You Yue pounded upon Fatty Qu's door. Wei Zi Qi, who was at the side, was the one who opened his door first and came out.\"What's happening?\"\"Oh, you didn't go out?\" Sima You Yue looked at Wei Zi Qi and said, \"You will do as well. I have something to ask you.\"Farry Qu opened his door and he ma.s.saged his eyes and looked at Sima You Yue, asking, \"You Yue, what's up?\"Sima You Yue looked over at Wei Zi Qi then entered Fatty Qu's house. Wei Zi Qi also followed them in.\"Looking at how you're shouting with such anxiety, it must be that you're missing me?\" Fatty Qu saw the state that Sima You Yue was in and smiled as he said.By this point, He was already familiar with Sima You Yue so he knew he was not the lovestruck fool that he heard about from the rumors and was not afraid of joking with him in this way. What he didn't know was that the rumors were not wrong, it was just that the original spirit in the body had changed.Sima You Yue found a stool to sit down and said, \"I just went to find Master Feng when I b.u.mped into Shen An and the rest at the school gates. They said they were going to choose their a.s.signments and told me to come back and ask you all. What is going on?\"\"Oh, you're talking about this. I would have forgotten it if you didn't bring it up.\" Fatty Qu came to sit beside Sima You Yue and said, \"Our school spends half the time studying and another half of the time carrying out a.s.signments and cultivating. Do you know about this?\"Sima You Yue nodded.\"After two more months, it will be our turn to carry out a.s.signments. When that time comes, we will have to choose to execute a certain mission from the school. There are easy and difficult ones, so we have to ballot to decide.\" Fatty Qu continued to explain.\"Then why do I not have to ballot?\" Sima You Yue saw that everyone else had to go but she didn't, so she felt a bit strange.\"\"Hehe, because this mission is completed in groups. One living quarters is one group, so you belong to this group.\" Fatty Qu looked over at Wei Zi Qi, then said to Sima You Yue with some regret, \"Because we didn't know you were going to come back, so when Master Feng said that we had to choose mission, we chose the mission with the greatest difficulty, which is also the only grade A mission of the first years.\"\"So you all don't have to go and ballot? And because I am in the same living quarters as you all, I have to go along with you to execute this mission? Sima You Yue asked the two of them.Wei Zi Qi and Fatty Qu nodded their heads.\"This mission is quite difficult. This\u2026 Since you've just come back, you can choose not to come along with us.\" Wei Zi Qi said tactfully since he thought Sima You Yue thought that Sima You Yue was blaming them for choosing a dangerous mission.\"Why would I not want to come along?\" Sima You Yue laughed, \"Aren't we all in the same group? Relax, I will not lag behind you guys.\"Looking at the excitement in Sima You Yue's eyes, Wei Zi Qi and Fatty Qu looked at him weirdly, isn't this guy afraid of danger?!\"Oh right, have you told Master Feng about the incident where someone harmed you?\" Fatty Qu thought of how Sima You Yue had said the person who harmed him was someone from their cla.s.s and he asked casually.\"Nope.\" Sima You Yue shook her head, \"But I've already met her.\"\"Then did you expose her?\" Fatty Qu probed agitatedly.\"Nope.\"\"Why didn't you expose her? She actually tried to kill you!\" Fatty Qu yelled.Sima You Yue saw how agitated Fatty Qu was and knew he was seeking justice on her behalf so she put a hand on his shoulder, saying, \"It's not the right time yet, I want to give her two more days.\"\"If it were me and I saw my enemy, I would rush up and beat him to death.\" Fatty Qu said.\"So who is the one who had pushed you?\" Wei Zi Qi looked at Sima You Yue and asked.\"Within these few months, don't you feel that He Qiu Zhi has become more high profile?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"Is she the one who pushed you?\" Wei Zi Qi asked.Sima You Yue nodded her head in agreement.\"So it was her.\" Fatty Qu said, \"She had become more high profile these few months, I heard that it was because curried favor with the Nalan Clan.\"\"What's up with the Nalan Clan?\" Sima You Yue rubbed her chin. If it was their clan, they would definitely have ideas and plots to kill her.\"You Yue, the Ancestor of this Nalan Clan has recently advanced in rank to become a Spirit Saint. In the past he was already unbearably arrogant and even much more so now. If it was really them who hurt you, even if your father is the General who protects the country, if you rashly accuse them, I'm just afraid that you will be fruitless in your labor.\" Fatty Qu was a person from the capital and was more familiar with these kind of things.\"I understand this point.\" Sima You Yue said. \"So I want to collect evidence and let the one who had harmed me get out of here before I take action.\"\"So what do you plan to do?\" Wei Zi Qi saw the coldness flash in Sima You Yue's eyes and he gained in interest.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

I remember that the school has a rule that prevents students from harming one another. If we let others know that they injured me based on a personal grudge, they would get expelled by the school. As long as they are no longer students of our school, thinking of how to deal with them will become my own issue.\"\"Wanting them to confess might not be an easy thing. Even if they were to confess in front of you, if they were to turn around and lie, we would not be able to do anything.\" Fatty Qu said.\"Sigh, if only we had a voice recorder.\" Sima You Yue thought of the voice recorders she had in her previous life. If only she had something like that, it would be so much more convenient.\"Voice recorder? What's that?\"\"It's something that can record down voices.. Something like, uhm, a weapon.\" Sima You Yue explained, \"If only we were able to record the voice inside then play it out to listen again later.\"\"You can try a Sound Stone.\" Ouyang Fei's voice came in front outside the door.\"Ouyang Fei, you've also come. Come in and take a seat.\" Fatty Qu smiled and greeted.Ouyang Fei looked over at Fatty Qu but he didn't go in, saying, \"I just happened to listen as I walked past. You can use a Sound Stone for something like this.\"He left the moment he finished speaking.\"That's right, how could I forget about the Sound Stone.\" Wei Zi Qi slapped his own head and said.\"What's a Sound Stone?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"A Sound Stone is similar to the voice recorder you talked about just now. As long as you record down the voice, you just need to pour in some spiritual power inside to release the voice from inside again.\" Wei Zi Qi explained.\"Really? Then do you have a Sound Stone?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"Sound Stones are really expensive, how would we possess one?\" Wei Zi Qi said.Sima You Yue glanced at Fatty Qu but he also shook his head. \"But you can head over to the Xuan Yuan Pavilion, maybe there will be one inside.\"\"Oh right, I'll go and take a look over there. If they don't have one, then we will have to think of something else.\" Sima You Yue turned around to leave once she finished speaking.\"Let's go together then. Anyway, I have nothing else to do.\" Fatty Qu said.\"Yup, I'm also done with my homework.\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"Let's go together then.\" Sima You Yue smiled.As such, the three of them left together.Bei Going Tang opened the door just as they were leaving. Looking at the direction of the main door, she touched the interspatial ring on her hand.The Xuan Yuan Pavilion was the Capital's largest shop. It sold things like Spirit tools, Spirit Beasts and medicine. If you said that the Xuan Yuan Pavilion did not have something, you definitely would not be able to find it anywhere else.When Sima You Yue's three man gang entered, the a.s.sistant pa.s.sionately came up to them.\"Well, if it isn't the Fifth Young Master, it's been such a long time since I've seen you. What would Fifth Young Master be looking to buy today?\"Sima You Yue's disappearance from school was an incident that was known throughout the capital. Seeing Sima You Yue here today, every single person was filled with surprise.It was not Sima You Yue's first time here. In the past, for the sake of looking for things that Murong An liked, she would come here often.She glanced at the area for miscellaneous goods, saying, \"I want a Sound Stone.\"\"Sound Stone?\" The a.s.sistant never thought that Sima You Yue would actually want that and gave a start before apologising, \"Fifth Young Master, our shop currently does not have a Sound Stone.\"\"It doesn't?\" Fatty Qu said, \"This is the capital's largest shop but you actually don't have a single one?\"The a.s.sistant smiled, saying, \"You're right in saying that this is the capital's largest shop, but a Sound Stone is really hard to find. A few hundred years may pa.s.s before one appears. You know what they say, the best housewife can't cook without rice; if it doesn't exist, then of course we won't be able to have it.\"\"But didn't I hear that a Sound Stone appeared? It seemed to have been a piece of news that was spread from this place.\" Fatty Qu's news could be said to be efficiently fast.\"We indeed had one two months ago, but it has already been sold a month ago.\" The a.s.sistant said.\"Who bought it?\"\"Nalan Clan.\" The a.s.sistant replied.Sima You Yue and Fatty Qu looked at each other. If this Sound Stone had been bought by others, just looking at Sima You Yue's status and ident.i.ty, it was still possible for her to buy it from them. However, if it had been bought by someone of the Nalan Clan, wanting to buy it over was practically impossible.The three of them could only return without a Sound Stone.\"You Yue, it doesn\u2019t matter. If we don't have a Sound Stone then we can just think of something else.\" Fatty Qu consoled.\"Yeah, it's not like other methods are impossible. They're just really difficult. If we had a Sound Stone, we could just effortlessly chase them out of school.\" Sima You Yue mused.\"Why don't I send a letter back to my family to see if they can help us look around?\" Wei Zi Qi asked.\"No need, it would be best if we could get that Sound Stone today. After a few days, finding it would also be useless.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Why do you need it to be today?\" Fatty Qu couldn't understand.\"Because tonight, He Qiu Zhi will be going to look for that person.\" Sima You Yue explained. Looking at the disappointments on Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi's faces, she smiled, \"It's okay, although tonight was the best opportunity, and we have some regrets of letting it pa.s.s, we still have other methods, right? The two of you, don't look so downcast.\"\"Yup, if you need anything you have to tell us directly.\" Fatty Qu said.\"Okay, I will.\"\"Creak-\"Bei Gong Tang's door opened and she appeared outside the door. She looked at the three people in the courtyard and threw something towards Sima You Yue before saying indifferently, \"I'm hungry. Are you cooking tonight? If you're not cooking then I will go to the canteen.\"Sima You Yue caught the thing that Bei Gong Tang had thrown to her and realised it was a small piece of stone. She saw that it was nothing special, apart from having some purple veins on the surface.\"What is this?\" She asked as she noticed that the stone was rather pretty and felt nice in her hand.\"A Sound Stone?!\" Wei Zi Qi shouted in surprise when he saw the stone.\"This is a Sound Stone?\" Sima You Yue looked at Bei Gong Tang. How come she would have something like this?When they were on the road back, Little Roar was despising how this world didn't have a single thing. In the place where she lived in her past life, this kind of stone was something that was thrown at the side of the road that people wouldn't even bother to pick up. But now, this entire country did not even possess one. It was too poor, too poor!Although Sima You Yue did not know which world Little Roar was referring to, she knew that this world had other places and these places were much more superior than where she was currently.\"Yup, in the past I happened to pick it up.\" Bei Gong Tang explained simply, \"You haven't told me whether or not you're going to cook.\"Sima You Yue smiled widely and nodded, saying, \"I am. It's still early right now so they shouldn't be moving yet, let's eat our fill before taking action.\"After saying this, she threw the Sound Stone into her interspatial ring and headed into the kitchen. Because she had gotten used to it when she was living on Pu Luo Mountain Range, she was accustomed to leaving things inside her interspatial ring, forgetting that in the eyes of the others, she was someone who was unable to cultivate and was actually supposed to be unable to use this interspatial ring.Wei Zi Qi and Fatty Qu heard that there were good things to eat and left with Sima You Yue without realising that she could already cultivate.Bei Gong Tang looked at Sima You Yue thoughtfully but she didn't say a word. She turned and entered the house, waiting for Sima You Yue to call her out to eat.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

So, now that she had made a large table of dishes, apart from leaving some aside for Ouyang Fei, every plate had been picked clean by these few people.After they finished eating, Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi took the initiative to stay behind to clean the plates and bowls. When they had just finished cleaning the bowls, Sima You Yue received some news from Little Roar, telling her the He Qiu Zhi had left her place.At this time, it was already very late, around 12 midnight. It was unknown what she wanted to do by leaving at this time.\"I'm going out.\" Sima You Yue said to Fatty Qu and the gang.\"Did He Qiu Zhi leave her house?\" Fatty Qu asked.Sima You Yue nodded.\"Then we'll go as well.\" Wei Zi Qi pulled off the ap.r.o.n that Sima You Yue had prepared for him.It was their first time wearing something like this so these two men were unaccustomed to it. However, they did not wish to dirty their clothes. Thinking about it, they were at home anyway so it didn't matter.Sima You Yue also did not say anything as she brought these two people out, according to what Little Roar reported to her. The three of them fumbled about towards the small lakeside at the Academy.\"You Yue, how did you know that she would be here?\" Fatty Qu asked when he saw Sima You Yue had directly run over to this place.Sima You Yue had yet to answer when Little Roar flew over.Looking at Little Roar, the two of them immediately understood. It turns out that You Yue had sent Little Roar to monitor He Qiu Zhi long ago.\"Yue Yue, now this evil woman has appeared, but there's no one else!\" Little Roar reported the situation.After hearing what Little Roar said, the other two widened their eyes in shock.They had always a.s.sumed that Little Roar was just a pet that Sima You Yue had been keeping, but thinking about how it could actually speak, it means that it was a Spirit Beast that was at least of the Saint Rank!Sima You Yue hugged Little Roar and said towards Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi, \"Let's look for a place to hide first. The person backing He Qiu Zhi might appear any second.\"\"Okay.\"The three of them saw that there was a rock garden not too far away from the Pavilion and so slowly inched their way towards that rock garden. Together with He Qiu Zhi, who was inside the Pavilion, they waited for that person.He Qiu Zhi was looking outside the pavilion the whole time, pacing back and forth anxiously. After a moment, a silhouette slowly appeared.\"Miss Nalan, you've finally come!\" He Qiu Zhi quickly came over the moment she saw the person who had come.Nalan Lan glanced over at the panicky He Qiu Zhi, walked over to the Pavilion and sat down directly before asking, \"Say it, why did you call me out so late at night?\"Sima You Yue didn't think that the person backing He Qiu Zhi was actually Nalan Lan; the one who had watched the original owner of this body get beaten to death together with Murong An.It was evident that the appearance of Nalan Lan had given both Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi and shock. They never thought that the one who wanted to harm Sima You Yue was actually the completely unrelated Nalan Lan.\"Miss Nalan, I had no other choice but to call you out.\" He Qiu Zhi knelt down, looking at Nalan Lan as she said, \"Miss Nalan, save me!\"He Qiu Zhi's words caught the attention of the three people hiding behind the rock garden so Sima You Yue took out the Sound Stone, pouring Spirit Power into it.Once the purple veins on the Sound Stone felt the Spirit Power, it was as if it were alive. The veins started to move, scaring Sima You Yue so much that she almost flung the stone aside.Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi only now realised that Sima You Yue was using an interspatial ring. Looking at her using her Spiritual Power to activate the Sound Stone, both of them stared at her with shock that was greater than when they had seen Nalan Lan.\"What\u2026\" Fatty Qu wanted to say something but his mouth was covered by the person beside him.Wei Zi Qi shook his head at Fatty Qu, indicating to him not to speak. Although his own heart was filled with question, he know that if he were to speak right now, he would disrupt Sima You Yue's plan.Fatty Qu blinked his eyes, indicating that he understood. Only then did Wei Zi Qi put down his hand.Sima You Yue looked gratefully at Wei Zi Qi before turning to continue looking at the two people in the Pavilion from the stone garden.\"Save you?\" Nalan Lan looked contemptuously at He Qiu Zhi who was kneeling on the ground. This kind of person had no real worth in her eyes, but she had helped her to get rid of Sima You Yuer so she had forced herself to allow He Qiu Zhi to follow after her. \"Say it, who have you provoked this time?\"\"It's Sima You Yue, he has returned.\" He Qiu Zhi said.\"Sima You Yue?\" Hearing the name Sima You Yue, Nalan Lan was shocked and said, \"You said that he has returned?\"\"Yes, I saw him today at the Academy building. He was alive and well!\" He Qiu Zhi shuddered when she thought of the way that Sima You Yue had looked at her.\"How come?! Are you certain that it's him?\" Looking at how He Qiu Zhi did not look like she was lying, she was extremely surprised.\"It's really him!\" He Qiu Zhi affirmed, \"Miss Nalan, you said that after entering the Fourth Teleportation Array, he would definitely die. It was only because I believed you that I was willing to push him in. But now that he has returned and he even wants to find me for revenge. His gaze when he looked at me made my hairs stand on ends, he even said that he wants to come for my life! Miss Nalan, you have to save me, you were the one who made me do it!\"As she said this, she stretched forth a hand to pull onto Nalan Lan's clothes, seeking a sense of security.Nalan Lan brushed He Qiu Zhi's hand aside saying, \"What are you so uptight about! Even if that waste has returned, what can he do to me?\"\"He must have seen that it was me who pushed him into the Fourth Teleportation array! He will definitely find me for revenge!\" He Qiu Zhi cried.\"The Academy prevents students from mutually killing each other. If one had been found with intentions to harm another, once it was found out by the Academy, the person would immediately be expelled from Academy.\" Nalan Lan was calm, \"As long as Sima You Yue has no evidence, he will have no way of doing anything to us. As long as you don't accept when he comes to you looking to battle, you will not be in any danger. Anyway, does that waste even dare to come to the Academy courtyard looking for trouble with you? Could it be that you can't even win over a waste?\"\"But I'm afraid that he'll play dirty.\" He Qiu Zhi said worriedly.\"Didn't I just tell you that he won't dare to do anything to you in Academy? Not unless he plans to be expelled by the Academy.\" Nalan Lan objected.\"But what about outside the Academy premises?\" He Qiu Zhi asked.\"Outside? Then you just have to not leave the Academy premises and all will be well.\" Nalan Lan said, \"During this period of time, you just have to remain in Academy. Don't you all have to go and complete some missions for Academy, the question still remains of whether or not he will be able to return alive. In the future, don't come to look for me for these kind of things. You're really a cowardly waste. I don't like the people who are following me to be of this kind of character, do you understand?\"After saying this, she did not wait for He Qiu Zhi to reply before turning around to leave the Pavilion.He Qiu Zhi watched as Nalan Lan departed before walking far away to spit in contempt, \"What are you so prideful for? You just have a good clan backing you. If you didn't have the Nalan Clan, wouldn't you just be the same as the rest of us? If you don't protect me, I'll just drag you through the mud with me, everyone of us can die together. Pui!\"He Qiu Zhi left before Sima You Yue finally stopped pumping Spirit Power into the Sound Stone. She turned around to face the two of them and said, \"With this thing, we'll see how they can object. I know you guys have questions on your hearts, let's talk about them when we get home.\"In order to prevent any accidents, the three of them avoided everyone else before sneaking back to their house.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

After that, she placed it on the table and the veins on the Sound Stone began to move. It quickly began to playback the conversation that had taken place between He Qiu Zhi and Nalan Lan at the lakeside. Once the conversation had ended, the Sound Stone quietened down.\"This is truly very strange.\" Sima You Yue's eyes flashed after she had finished listening to it. She never expected that the stone would be so powerful but she still had a question in her heart. This Sound Stone was so rare that even the Xuan Yuan Pavilion didn't have one, so how come Bei Gong Tang did?\"You Yue, you should answer our questions now right?\"Fatty Qu's voice caused Sima You Yue to gather her thoughts and she looked at them with confusion, \"What questions?\"\"The matter of you being able to cultivate?\" Fatty Qu looked pointedly at the inconspicuous ring on her finger. If it wasn't for the fact that they knew it was an interspatial ring, many people would not even think of it. \"You being able to use that interspatial ring, being able to infuse the Sound Stone with Spirit Energy, this means that you are a Spirit Master.\"\"That's right, I'm a Spirit Master now.\" Sima You Yue admitted.\"But weren't you unable to cultivate?\" Wei Zi Qi and gang probably didn't know, but Fatty Qu and all those who were close to her all knew that inside information about Sima You Yue.\"Yup, in the past, I was unable to cultivate.\" Sima You Yue explained, \"but during this time when I had gone missing, I happened upon some fortuitous encounters and my clogged meridians were opened. Thus, I am able to cultivate now.\"\"Really?\" Fatty Qu's eyes widened. Who knew that him going missing was actually a blessing in disguise. Not only had he survived, he even gained the ability to cultivate.Sima You Yue nodded her head, saying, \"But the details of my encounter, I really find it difficult to elaborate on, anyway this is its end result. With regards to this, previously it was only my family that knew about it, but now you two know as well. You two definitely have to keep this a secret for me!\"\"But why?\" Fatty Qu could not understand, \"Your ability to cultivate is a good thing, why would you not want others to find out? If others knew that you were able to cultivate, they would no longer curse at you for being a waste.\"\"What others want to think about me is their own problem, I don't care.\" Sima You Yue said, \"But if others found out that I knew how to cultivate, I'm afraid that it would draw no end of troubles.\"Fatty Qu knew that Sima You Yue was talking about the Nalan Clan. He'd heard about it the last time when he went back home. The feud between the General's residence and the Nalan Clan had increased in tenacity. It was only because they knew that Sima You Yue was a waste and so had not made any moves to hurt him for the time being. If they knew that he was able to cultivate, they would definitely move against him.\"Okay, we will definitely not speak a word of this to anyone.\" Fatty Qu nodded his head fervently in agreement.Wei Zi Qi nodded his head in a similar fas.h.i.+on.Sima You Yue smiled, saying, \"Thank you both.\"\"Why are you thanking us!\" Fatty Qu said, \"We are friends, of course we would help you to protect your secret. We'd initially planned not to let you go fulfill this mission with us because it would be dangerous to you. Although you can cultivate, your rank must not be too high. If you go, you will still be in some danger. However, if we're talking about cultivation, this is a rare opportunity to put it into practice. So you can think about whether or not you want to go.\"Sima You Yue merely smiled when he heard Wei Zi Qi say that her rank was not high and did not reply. His words had no intent to hurt her and people normally would not think that she would be able to cultivate to such an extend in such a short period of time.Furthermore, he had said this with her best interests at heart.\"Since it is a mission that has been a.s.signed to our group, I definitely have to be there.\" Sima You Yue said, \"But you all can relax, I will not drag you down.\"\"We are not afraid that you would drag us down, it is just that this mission is quite dangerous. If there happens to be a dangerous situation where we cannot protect you, it is possible that you would lose your life!\" Fatty Qu explained.\"I understand\" Sima You Yue said, \"I'm someone who really values my life. You two can rest a.s.sured.\"\"Since you've already decided then it's fine.\" Wei Zi Qi did not add anything else, only looking at Sima You Yue and saying, \"So when do you want to expose the true colors of these two people?\"Sima You Yue looked at the Sound Stone lying on the table and smiled sinisterly, \"With regards to this, the earlier the better so as to avoid harming my eyes whenever I have to look at them.\"\"That Nalan Clan is truly more rampant inside the school compounds. If you were to cause the talent of their family to be expelled from school, that family would definitely explode in anger.\" Fatty Qu laughed.Explode in anger? Sima You Yue smirked, that would be great!On the second day, Sima You Yue attended cla.s.s as per normal and when people saw her on the way to cla.s.s, they stared at her with wide eyes.\"Didn't that waste die? How come he's back?\"\"Yeah, didn't they say that all who entered the Fourth Teleportation Array would never survive to return?\"\"That's what they say.\"\"Then how come that waste is back? Furthermore, looking at his appearance, nothing happened to him at all.\"\"Could it be that the Teleportation Array had no killing power towards that waste?\"\"d.a.m.n, if that's really the case, isn't that trash too lucky?! Being a trash actually saved his life!\"\"Don\u2019t' speak so loudly, if he heard you, he'd call men from the residence to dispose of you!\"\"Tsk, isn't he just relying on support from the General.\"\"Enough, let's go. My mood is ruined from looking at that waste.\"A few of them left after speaking a few sentences. When Sima You Yue walked in front of them, she heard everything clearly. These few people were just jealous because they didn't have superior family backgrounds and felt that, as a waste, she actually had this kind of life and environment. Life was really unfair to them.When the new students from the elite cla.s.s walked into the cla.s.sroom, they weren't as surprised as the people before. After all, many people had already seen her yesterday.When Sima You Yue entered the cla.s.sroom, she saw He Qiu Zhi and she also saw her. Seeing that she looked over, she smiled profoundly, causing her to look down immediately in fear.She sat with Bei Gong Tang at the last row and saw that her seat was completely clean and free of even a single speck of dust.\"I don't like the seat beside me to be dirty.\" Bei Gong Tang explained simply as she took out a textbook to read.\"Thank you.\" No matter what she said, she had helped her to clean her desk and so deserved her grat.i.tude.\"You guys went out yesterday night, have you settled things?\" Bei Gong Tang was still looking at the textbooks but thinking of the way that Sima You Yue had looked at He Qiu Zhi, she thought that there would be a good show to watch soon.She didn't know why but looking looking at Sima You Yue gave her a kind of amiable feeling. She even cared about his problems. This was something that she had never felt before.In the past, her heart was strong and when she had returned to that place, she had exacted her revenge on some people.Actually being able to care for something like this was something that she thought was strange.\"Yup, it's all been settled. I'm just waiting for cla.s.s to end.\" Sima You Yue smiled as she replied.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59: \u201cExacting Justice\u201dSoon after, a teacher walked inside. He had been a little surprised when he saw Sima You Yue, but he very quickly regained his composure and began cla.s.s.This cla.s.s was on Geography and it happened to be about Pu Luo Mountain Range. After talking about the topography of the area, the teacher began to teach about the Spirit Beasts on the mountain. The entire cla.s.s was focused on teaching the students about things like the characteristics of the various Spirit Beasts.Sima You Yue turned serious upon hearing this, especially since she desired to accustom herself better to this world. Furthermore, on the Pu Luo Mountain Range, she had encountered some of the Spirit Beasts that the teacher had mentioned, so it wasn't too dry or boring.Especially since the things that the teacher was talking about were pretty useful. If she had known about these things before she had ended up in Pu Luo Mountain Range, she would not have faced such difficulty when she encountered those Spirit Beasts.Bei Gong Tang and her listened to these things extremely seriously but Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi, these two, had their minds wandering everywhere. They were barely listening to cla.s.s and were very distracted.With much difficulty, they managed to last till the end of cla.s.s. The moment the teacher left, the two of them looked at Sima You Yue and immediately ran out. One of them went to look for Feng Zhi Xing while another ran towards the Academy Plaza.Before he left, Wei Zi Qi even shouted at the cla.s.srooms, \"If you want to see something exciting, come to the Academy Plaza!\"Being enticed by Wei Zi Qi's cliffhanger, everyone's curiosity had been aroused so they all headed towards the Academy Plaza.He Qiu Zhi saw that everyone had left but she just sat unmoving at her seat. She had a kind of foreboding that this exciting news had something to do with her.\"Let's go.\" Sima You Yue and Bei Gong Tang were waiting inside the cla.s.sroom. They saw that everyone else had left but He Qiu Zhi still sat at her seat with no indication of moving so they walked forward to say.\"I, I'm not going.\" He Qiu Zhi said, \"I have something on, right, I have something I need to do so I'll be leaving first.\"After saying this, she stood up and prepared to leave.Sima You Yue immediately grabbed her collar, saying, \"You're the main lead of today's show. If you don't go, this show will be incomplete, right?! Let's go.\"\"Sima You Yue, release me!\" He Qiu Zhi heard what Sima You Yue had said and was even more reluctant to go. She twisted her body, wanting to break free of Sima You Yue's grasp.But no matter how much she struggled, it was like she was held in a death grip that refused to budge.Sima You Yue saw how restless He Qiu Zhi was and grabbed onto her hand, pulling it backwards. It hurt her so much that she grounded her teeth and roared, \"Sima You Yue, what do you want to do?! Aren't you afraid of being expelled?\"\"There's no point thinking about these little things.\" Sima You Yue increased the strength in her hand, \"You think that I would deal with you personally? There's no way that I would give the Nalan Clan an excuse to expel me. Since I've said that you have to go, then you better not resist. Bei Gong Tang is not as easily appeased as I am.\"He Qiu Zhi saw Bei Gong Tang, who was standing at the side, and gave up all thoughts of resisting.These few months they've also started practice battles. If Bei Gong Tang said that her battle abilities were only ranked second, n.o.body would dare claim to be the first.\"Since you've chosen to harm me, you should have been prepared for a day like this to come.\" Sima You Yue smiled coldly as she said.By the time Sima You Yue and Bei Gong Tang had finally brought He Qiu Zhi to the Academy Plaza, the Plaza had been filled with so many people. Aside from the new students, there were even a few seniors.This Academy Plaza happened to be at the heart of the school and was a place that students definitely had to walk by after cla.s.s. After hearing that something exciting was going to take place, everyone decided to stay back.The people who were waiting to see the exciting show were standing there in twos and threes, as everyone wondered what exciting thing was going to happen today.Nalan Lan and Murong An had came in together from cla.s.s and there were even three of four other people who had came with them from their previous cla.s.s. They were walking past the Academy Plaza when they were barred from walking along by Sima You Yue.When they saw Sima You Yue, the faces of these two people turned black immediately. Murong An's face was even colder as he said, \"Sima You Yue, why are you looking for me again?!\"\"Sima You Yue, how can you be so shameless? I've just heard of your return but you immediately come to hold on to Master Murong.\" The people behind immediately began to rage.\"When did he ever have any semblance of shame? When did he not act like a dog, running over, every single time he met Master Murong.\"Sima You Le had received news from Sima You Yue in the morning, telling him to come over to the Academy Plaza after school. Who knew that he would hear these people scolding his younger brother so he rushed over to these people who had been talking and immediately beat them up.\"You dare to curse at my younger brother, you're asking for death!\"\"Ahhh!\u2026\" Those who had been on the receiving end of his punch were left sprawled on the ground, groaning about in pain.\"Sima You Le, are you looking for a fight?\" Those people immediately helped their friends up.\"So what if I'm looking for a fight?\" Sima You Le looked at the people who were glaring at him and he stood in front of Sima You Yue. He raised his chin as if he was taunting them to see who would dare step forward to fight with him.Sima You Yue pulled at Sima You Le's arm, saying, \"Fourth Brother, wasting your words on these imbeciles would only lower our own status, don\u2019t you think?\"\"Sima You Yue, what did you say?\" Some people hollered.\"Look, Fourth Brother, they don't even understand such simple words, if you continued to reason with them, it would be completely meaningless.\" Sima You Yue shrugged her shoulders. After that, she looked towards Murong An, saying, \"Murong An, you're even more disgusting than they are. A narcissistic dog is the most vile of them all.\"The activities on this side had long aroused the interest of many people. After hearing what Sima You Yue had said, everyone was incomparably shocked.When had Sima You Yue learnt to speak to Murong An like that?!\"What did you say?!\" Sima You Yue had called him a dog in front of everyone, and he was even a waste. This made him extremely furious.\"You were one from the start.\" Sima You Yue said, \"I didn't even come to look for you today, but the moment you opened your mouth you asked me why I came to look for you, isn't that narcissism? Or are you saying that you've been enraptured by my charming good looks, hoping that I, this Young Master, had come to look for you for whatever reason?\"\"Nonsense!\" Murong An immediately refuted.\"Nonsense or not, I can't be bothered to argue with you.\" Sima You Yue saw that Fatty Qu had already brought Feng Zhi Xing over and the fatty who was the Teaching Director had also tagged along so she knew that the timing was just about to arrive, she said, \"Nalan Lan, I came today to look for you.\"\"Look for me?\" When Nalan Lan heard what Sima You Yue had said, her heart involuntarily started to pound. She convinced herself that it was impossible for Sima You Yue to find any evidence against her. Even if He Qiu Zhi accused her of doing anything, all she had to do was to refute it. As a result, her heart started to calm down again. She asked \"Why are you looking for me?\"\"Why is everyone gathered over here? Also, who is the one who asked us to come?\" The Teaching Direction creased his eyebrows in question as he saw the large crowd of people gathered in the Plaza.\"Director, it was me who asked them to invite you here.\" Sima You Yue stepped two steps forward and said, \"I have something that I want everyone in the Academy to help me judge.\"Looking at Sima You Yue, the Teaching Director's eyes flashed with disdain and hatred, but he still asked, \"What is it about?\"\"Last time when we were choosing Spirit Beast Eggs, someone had harmed me and pushed me into the Fourth Teleportation Array. This is something that everyone knows. Now, I've already found out who is the one who hurt me. Initially, I wanted to find her for revenge but I thought of the rule that forbid me from taking revenge into my own hands, so I specially invited everyone here to help me be the judge.\"\"Who is it?\" The Teaching Director had yet to say a word when Feng Zhi Xing asked.He always had his suspicions. There were so many people, so why was she the one who entered the Fourth Teleportation Array. It turned out that someone had sabotaged her. Thinking of how she had almost failed to return, his clear eyes flashed with a coldness.Sima You Le hatefully glared at the people around him. Since Sima You Yue had chosen this place to say it, the person who had harmed his brother was definitely around here.Thinking of how there was someone who actually dared to harm Sima You Yue, his face revealed unrestrained malice.\"Fifth Brother, who was it that dared to harm you?!\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

After that, she turned towards He Qiu Zhi, who was already so scared that her whole body was trembling, then turned again towards Nalan, who looked confident that nothing would happen to her. She said, \"Nalan Lan, why did you hurt me?\"Sima You Yue's words caused the initially quiet Plaza to explode with conversation. Everyone stared at Nalan Lan with disbelief. The one who had harmed Sima You Yue was actually her?!\"Sima You Yue, don't talk nonsense. When did I harm you?!\" Nalan Lan quickly refuted, \"You went missing during the time where new students were choosing their Spirit Beast Eggs, but I am a senior student. How could I have harmed you? I wasn't with you when you went to the cave.\"The Teaching Director nodded his head, saying, \"Nalan Lan has spoken the truth. She's not a new student, how could she have harmed you?\"Sima You Yue looked at the way the Teaching Director was acting and realised that he was already going to be biased towards Nalan Lan.\"She might have had no way, but she made someone else do it. Right, He Qiu Zhi? You wouldn't have pushed me into the Fourth Teleportation Array for no reason right?\"When He Qiu Zhi was pointed out by name, her entire bottle involuntarily trembled. She raised her head and saw that everyone was looking at her and could not form her sentences properly.\"I, I\u2026\"Nalan Lan looked at the way He Qiu Zhi was behaving then she looked at the Teaching Director with grief, saying, \"Director, I really have no intention to harm Sima You Yue at all. If he lets He Qiu Zhi accuse me as the mastermind, I would really be hard pressed to defend myself.\"He Qiu Zhi never expected that Nalan Lan would say this, so she stared at her in shock, her eyes flashed with anger and helplessness, saying, \"Miss Nalan Lan, it was clearly you who told me that entering the Fourth Teleportation Array would definitely end in death. You asked me to push Sima You Yue in during the time where they were choosing Spirit Beast Eggs! But now you're pus.h.i.+ng all the responsibility onto me!\"Nalan Lan acted as if she knew this was going to happen all along and said, \"Everyone look, I told you all that she was going to to say this. I think that this is something that Sima You Yue asked you to say, right?\"\"Isn't it just that you are very clear on what happened?\" Sima You Yue smirked. She felt that the way Nalan Lan was acting really resembled a clown that was jumping up and down.\"Clear on what? Sima You Yue, I know that the relations.h.i.+p between our families is not that great, but you can't frame me like this!\"\"Sima You Yue, just what are you planning to do?\" Murong An hatefully glared at Sima You Yue, feeling that Sima You Yue was doing this just to get his attention but he was increasing disgusted by him.\"Why do you care about what I want to do?\" Sima You yue looked at Murong An with disdain. Looking at the way he was acting, she knew he was being narcissistic again.Feng Zhi Xing had finally regained his calm and said, \"You Yue, you're saying that He Qiu Zhi is the one who pushed you into the Teleportation Array but it was under Nalan Lan's orders?\"Sima You Yue nodded.Feng Zhi Xing looked at He Qiu Zhi and with a face covered with frost, he asked, \"He Qiu Zhi, do you admit to your crime?\"He Qiu Zhi took a look at the way Feng Zhi Xing was behaving and immediately knelt down, \"Master Feng, I never wanted to harm Sima You Yue, it was Nalan Lan who made me do it. If it was not for her ordering me to do it, as a new student, how would I know that there would be something wrong with the Fourth Teleportation Array?\"\"The entire school knows that there's something wrong with the Fourth Teleportation Array, it's not just Nalan Lan. On what basis do you claim that it was her who told you to do it? Do you have any evidence?\" The Teaching Director said, \"If not, I could say that it was someone else who asked you to do it and you just want to cover up for the one backing you.\"\"My words are the very evidence! It was really Nalan Lan who asked me to do it!\" He Qiu Zhi never expected that the Teaching Director would not believe what she said and was momentarily stunned.Sima You Yue did not think that the current situation was anything out of her expectations. After all, this Teaching Director's surname was Nalan. He was part of the Nalan Clan, of course he would say things to the benefit of Nalan Lan.\"It is a given that your words do not count as evidence.\" The Teaching Director said, \"If you have no other evidence, I have to cast the verdict for this issue.\"\"I\u2026\" He Qiu Zhi started at Nalan Lan unresignatedly. At the point of time, she never expected that Sima You Yue would be able to survive to return. Furthermore, whenever the two of them met in private, they only had verbal agreements. Of course she would not have any other types of evidences.\"Right now, I, the Teaching Director, will announce the verdict. He Qiu Zhi has caused harm to Sima You Yue, which has violated the law of our Academy that states you may not harm another student. As a result, He Qiu Zhi must leave the Academy. She will be expelled and will no longer be under the Academy's protection. After leaving, she is also not allowed to declare herself as a student of our Academy.\" The Teaching Director proclaimed.\"Don't, don't expel me!\" He Qiu Zhi cried as she heard that the Teaching Director has expelled her just like this, \"It was really Nalan Lan who asked me to do it, she's the real mastermind!\"\"Nonsense, as of this moment you are no longer our student. If you continue to slander a student of our Academy, our Academy will not let you off lightly!\" The Teaching Director hollered before turning around to face Sima You Yue, asking, \"What do you think about this way of settling it?\"Sima You Yue was just waiting for the punishment that the Teaching Director would meter out against He Qiu Zhi before saying, \"The punishment for the accomplice is very satisfactory, but the Teaching Director can also justly settle the main culprit.\"When the Teaching Director heard what Sima You Yue had said, his eyebrows raised involuntarily, saying, \"What do you mean?\"\"I mean what I said!\" Sima You Yue said, \"Just now, you asked for evidence but you only asked He Qiu Zhi, you didn't ask me!\"\"You're saying that you have evidence?\"\"Yes I do. Zi Qi.\" Sima You Yue said as she looked towards Wei Zi Qi.\"Here.\" Wei Zi Qi took out the Sound Stone and handed it over to Sima You Yue.Sima You Yue took the Sound Stone and turned to give it to Feng Zhi Xing, saying, \"It's all inside here.\"Feng Zhi Xing didn't expect that Sima You Yue actually had a Sound Stone. Of course, he knew how to use it and poured in some Spirit Power, causing the veins on the Sound Stone to move once again.\"Director, you should listen to this carefully.\" Sima You Yue smiled as she said.\"Save you? Say it, who have you provoked this time?\" Nalan Lan's voice came out from the Sound Stone.\"It's Sima You Yue, he's returned.\" It was He Qiu Zhi's voice.\"Sima You Yue? You say that he's returned?\"\"That's right, I saw him today at the Academy building. He's alive and well, he didn't die!\"\"How can this be?! Are you sure it's him?\"The voices that came from the Sound Stone stunned He Qiu Zhi and Nalan Lan. This was the conversation they had when they were at the lakeside yesterday night at the Pavilion.\"It really was him! Miss Nalan, you said that entering the Fourth Teleportation Array would definitely mean death. It was only because I believed you that I pushed him in but now he has returned and even wants to take revenge on me. When I saw his eyes, I had gooseb.u.mps all over, he really wants to take my life! Miss Nalan, you have to save me. You're the one who made me do it!\"\"What are you so uptight about! Even if that trash came back, what can he do to us?\"\"He saw that I was the one who pushed him into the Fourth Teleportation Array! He will definitely come to look for me for revenge!\"\"The Academy prevents students from mutually killing each other. If one had been found with intentions to harm another, once it was found out by the Academy, the person would immediately be expelled from Academy.\" Nalan Lan was calm, \"As long as Sima You Yue has no evidence, he will have no way of doing anything to us. As long as you don't accept when he comes to you looking to battle, you will not be in any danger. Anyway, does that waste even dare to come to the Academy courtyard looking for trouble with you? Could it be that you can't even win over a waste?\"Listening up to this point, the students all started at Nalan Lan with shock.

She thought that he did not have any evidence, but now this was definitely conclusive proof, rendering her unable to dispute anything.\"Director, you've heard the conversation. He Qiu Zhi was merely a henchman, the real mastermind was Nalan Lan. She's the one who wanted to kill me.\" Sima You Yue said.The Teaching Director's face was so black and thunderous. He didn't think that Sima You Yue would actually be able to do this, shooting Nalan Lan so directly.If she was an ordinary person, it would be fine to expel her. However, Nalan Lan was the genius of the Nalan Clan. If she were to be expelled, the family members would definitely not let him off easily. Even if he was now the Teaching Director of this Academy, he was still restricted by the family.\"Director, you've seen the evidence. Please pa.s.s a fair judgement on my students.\" Feng Zhi Xing looked at the way the Teaching Director was behaving and said directly.\"This, Sima You Yue, this only has the voices. They've only mentioned the name of Miss Nalan but that doesn't necessarily mean it's Nalan Lan. So this evidence is not solid enough.\" The Teaching Director thought for a while and said this sentence that even he found hard to believe.When the surrounding students heard this, they all sucked in a breath.\"Director, what do you mean by this?\" Feng Zhi Xing said coldly.The Teaching Director appeared as if he was very satisfied by the explanation that he had come up with and said, \"This is exactly what I mean. The evidence is not satisfactory and is not enough to incriminate Nalan Lan. As a result, it is not possible to do anything towards Nalan Lan.\"\"Director, how could you be like this?!\" Sima You Le shouted at the Teaching Director.\"Sima You Le, what kind of att.i.tude are you showing me!\" The Teaching Director looked at Sima You Le unsatisfactorily, \"If you continue being this way, I might even charge you with disrespect against a teacher! You\u2026\"The Teaching Director had yet to finish speaking when he felt as if he saw someone flash past. After that, Nalan Lan suddenly screamed.\"Sima You Yue, what are you doing!\" The Teaching Director shouted when he saw that Sima You Yue was standing in front of Nalan Lan and had placed a dagger on her neck when everyone was not looking.\"What am I doing? Can't you see?\" Sima You Yue said, \"In any case, you have already decided to favor her. The evidence is clear but you won't punish her. It looks like harming another student can't mean much. I'm just thinking that since this is the case, I can just take things into my own hands and settle this. I'm not sure what will happen if this blade accidentally slips. Will her head still remain on her neck?\"\"Stay your hand!\" The Teaching Director anxiously shouted when he saw that Sima You Yue's dagger was moving.\"Why should I stop?\" Sima You Yue stared at the teaching director mockingly, \"So many students have heard the conversation between He Qiu Zhi and Nalan Lan but, no matter what, you seem to want to say it isn't her. Since this is the case, I can kill her but still claim that it wasn't me. Anyway, I believe that the General's residence has the power to keep everyone silent.\"\"You\u2026\" The Teaching Director saw that a line of blood had started to form under Sima You Yue's blade that was pressed against Nalan Lan's neck and wanted to quickly pull them apart. However, Fen Zhi Xing blocked him.The two of them exchanged two moves before separating. The Teaching Director glared at Feng Zhi Xing and shouted, \"Master Feng, what are you doing? By blocking me are you planning to let Sima You Yue kill Nalan Lan?\"Feng Zhi Xing stood in front of Sima You Yue and looked at the Teaching Director, saying, \"I feel that Sima You Yue has a point. Since you are unwilling to pa.s.s a fair judgement on behalf of my students, I will allow him to settle things himself. I will allow him to settle things before I punish him.\"Sima You Yue almost laughed when she heard what Feng Zhi Xing had said. What did he mean that he would allow her to settle things before punis.h.i.+ng her, by that time, Nalan Lan would already be dead. He just had to expel her and things would be settled, but at that time the Nalan Clan would have lost a genius but all she had to do was leave the Academy.Furthermore, she was certain that the the Teaching Director did not dare to really let her harm Nalan Lan, if not, he would have no way to give an account to the Nalan Clan.\"Feng Zhi Xing, I want to punish you!\" The Teaching Director said, \"But if you move aside now, I will not pursue it.\"The Teaching Director did not know how strong Feng Zhi Xing was, he only knew that he was an important person to the Princ.i.p.al. As a result, he did not wish to fight him right now.The way he saw it, Feng Zhi Xing was offending his superiors and obstructing his enforcement of the law. Giving him this chance could be said to be treating him fairly. However, Feng Zhi Xing did not plan to accept his good graces.\"Since you are unable to conduct things justly, it is a given that I would no longer be able to believe your words.\" Feng Zhi Xing acted as if he was very earnest and said, \"As a result, I will no longer allow you to harm my student any longer. If you want to punish me then go ahead!\"\"Sima You Yue, do you know what kind of ending you will meet if you dare to harm Nalan Lan?\" The Teaching Director turned to say to Sima You Yue when he saw that Feng Zhi Xing refused to move and that Sima You Yue's dagger could take Nalan Lan's life any moment.\"Won't I just be expelled.\" Sima You Yue smirked maliciously, \"But before I even get expelled, I will do as I please!\"After saying this, she brandished her dagger and prepared to slash it across Nalan Lan.\"\"Stop!\"The people standing around were shocked by Sima You Yue's actions as the Teaching Director hastened to call out.When Sima You Yue's blade was just 1cm away from Nalan Lan's neck, a terrifying spirit pressure came from the School building, freezing everyone on the compound in place. Only Feng Zhi Xing was able to turn his body to look at the place which the spirit pressure was coming from.That place was the Princ.i.p.al's office.The window of the Princ.i.p.al's office opened as a person flew out from the inside, landing on the Plaza. He looked at Sima You Yue and Nalan Lan, walked over to pull Nalan Lan out of Sima You Yue's clutches.After that, he released the terrifying spirit pressure.\"Everyone else disperse. The few of you, come with me to the Princ.i.p.al's office!\" The Princ.i.p.al looked at Sima You Yue and gang, clasped his hands behind his back and left.n.o.body dared to dispute the Princ.i.p.al's words and everyone who had come to see the exciting show had left. Sima You Yue and Feng Zhi Xing, Sima You Le, the Teaching Director, Nalan Lan and He Qiu Zhi followed the Princ.i.p.al to his office.Nalan Lan covered her neck with her hands, hatefully glaring at Sima You Yue. It was too sudden just now and she did not even notice when Sima You Yue had come close to her. Just now, she really felt Sima You Yue's strong urge to kill. She knew that if the Princ.i.p.al had not appeared, Sima You Yue would really have killed her!Sima You Yue glanced at Nalan Lan and made an action of slitting her throat. Looking at her involuntarily retracting her neck, she beamed.After that, she looked at Feng Zhi Xing who had walked in front of her. She had noticed that under the Princ.i.p.al's spirit pressure, he actually managed to retain his movement. This meant that he was stronger than the Princ.i.p.al.The Princ.i.p.al was known to be the strongest person in the country of Dong Chen, even stronger than Sima Lie.

Click on our to add to the queue!Chapter 62: Settling the punishmentArriving at the Princ.i.p.al's office, everyone took their own initiative to stand into two lines. Nalan Lan stood behind the Teaching Director while Sima You Yue and Sima You Le stood behind Feng Zhi Xing. He Qiu Zhi took a look before standing to Sima You Yue's side.The Princ.i.p.al sat in his seat before turning to look at the Teaching Director, saying, \"How are you governing the issues of the students that you almost allowed manslaughter!\"\"Princ.i.p.al, it was Sima You Yue that wanted to kill Nalan Lan but when I wanted to stop it, Master Feng blocked me. You should ask Master Feng why he wanted to block me!\" The Teaching Director threw the entirety of the blame to Sima You Yue and Feng Zhi Xing.The Princ.i.p.al looked at Feng Zhi Xing then his face frosted over. He appeared to be fuming mad. She'd heard that the Princ.i.p.al was very terrifying once he became angry so Sima You Yue could not help but to feel slightly worried for Feng Zhi Xing. She was afraid that the Princ.i.p.al would make trouble for him.However, the Princ.i.p.al shouted at the Teaching Director once again, \"You think that your words are the only ones that count in this Academy? Although I don't poke my nose much into the affairs of this Academy, do you think I am blind? I watched the unfoldings at the Plaza extremely clearly. You still want to push the blame to others? It looks like you're the Teaching Director for nothing! Do you wish to give up your position? I'll immediately call for someone to take over!\"\"No, Princ.i.p.al I\u2026\" The Teaching Director wanted to explain but he had been stared down by the Princ.i.p.al.\"Where's the Sound Stone?\" The Princ.i.p.al asked.Feng Zhi Xing stepped forward and placed the Sound Stone on his desk.The Princ.i.p.al picked up the Sound Stone and infused it with Spirit Power. The previous conversation sounded once again. While listening to it, he glared daggers at the Teaching Director. It's meaning was that things were already so obvious but he had actually made this kind of decision. The Teaching Director was so afraid that he broke out in cold sweat.After he finished listening to the recording, the Princ.i.p.al looked at Nalan Lan and said, \"What else do you want to say?\"Nalan Lan groaned, turning her head to the side.\"Since this is the case, we'll just expel her.\" The Princ.i.p.al said, \"He Qiu Zhi, the same goes for you. Two of you should return to pack up your things and leave the Academy. From now on, you both are not students of this Academy. Go back now to pack.\"Nalan Lan took the lead and walked out. When she walked past Sima You Yue, she glared at her hatefully.He Qiu Zhi saw how things were already set and could only leave feeling unreconciled.\"As for you, you're the Teaching Director but you don't know how to handle things impartially. Because of your impartial judgement, you are suspended for a year. During this period of time, someone will take charge in your place. You should go home and properly reflect!\" The Princ.i.p.al said to the Teaching Director.The Teaching Director wanted to explain himself but once he saw how strict the Princ.i.p.al was, he swallowed his words and turned to leave.Sima You Yue touched her nose. This issue was resolved just like that?No matter what, this Nalan Lan had been expelled so her first goal had been reached.\"Hmph!\"Right now, only Sima You Yue, Sima You Le, Feng Zhi Xing and the Princ.i.p.al remained inside the house. When he saw that Sima You Yue's mind was wandering, the Princ.i.p.al humphed, causing Sima You Yue to recover her thoughts.Sima You Yue saw that the Princ.i.p.al was looking at her so she quickly stood straight, as if she was a model student.\"What's the point of acting obedient now!\" The Princ.i.p.al saw the way Sima You Yue was acting and said, \"Did you know that if I had not acted out today, you would be expelled today?! You actually dare to harm another student, you really are brave!\"Sima You Yue grinned, \"Wasn't it because I knew that Princ.i.p.al would intervene that I acted this way?\"\"You knew?\" The Princ.i.p.al raised his eyebrows in shock.\"That's right! You were watching from the window for such a long time. You definitely would not have let things become too serious!\" Sima You Yue said.\"You knew that I was watching from here?\" The Princ.i.p.al and Feng Zhi Xing looked at each other. It was expected that Feng Zhi Xing would realised because he was of an unknown strength, but how come Sima You Yue would also know that he was watching?\"That's right, when Master Feng and the rest had arrived at the plaza, you were standing here already.\" Sima You Yue said definitively.From the very beginning, she had felt someone watching her from here. Someone who was able to watch her from this place, who else could it be if not the Princ.i.p.al?She was an a.s.sa.s.sin in her previous life and was especially sensitive towards this kind of gazes. Furthermore, she was most talented in concealing herself and discovering others. She had managed to feel the Princ.i.p.al's barely concealed gaze immediately.\"That's why you came up with this kind of idea, in order to make me intervene?\" The Princ.i.p.al said.Sima You Yue nodded.\"The Teaching Director had hardened his heart to protect Nalan Lan, only you would be able to shake him. However, you remained here watching the drama without showing yourself so I had no choice!\" SIma You Yue said with a face full of lamentation, \"But speaking up to this point, if I had been slightly more rash or had moved slight quickly, or if I had accidentally slipped\u2026\"Looking at how the Princ.i.p.al's face turned blacker and blacker, Sima You Yue's voice also became softer and softer. In the end, her voice was barely a whisper as she finally swallowed her words.\"I promised your Grandfather that I would account to him with regards to this situation. I didn't expected that you would use murder to force it out. Right now, this can be considered to be fair to you. You can do whatever you want in the Academy and I won't care. But the Nalan Clan will not be easily provoked. Right now, your family and theirs are back on par, when you do things please be more alert.\" The Princ.i.p.al said.Her secret plans had been exposed. Sima You yue was a bit embarra.s.sed and laughed awkwardly.The Princ.i.p.al waved his hands, saying, \"The two of you go down, I have some things to speak to Master Feng about.\"\"Yes, Princ.i.p.al!\"Sima You Yue and Sima You Le came out and looked at each other. They immediately laughed.Sima You Le touched the cold sweat that beaded on his forehead, saying, \"I never thought you would dare to do this kind of things in front of so many people, it was even more unexpected that the princ.i.p.al did not pursue it. You really want to scare me to death!\"\"Hey hey, who asked that Teaching Director to be so hateful.\" Sima You Yue placed a hand on Sima You Le's shoulder, saying, \"However, their pampered princess has been expelled, it looks like that Nalan Clan will not let this matter go. I'm just afraid that they will go look for trouble with Grandfather.\"\"Mm, this is a possibility.\" Sima You le nodded, \"I'll go home now to explain today's happenings to Grandfather and tell him to be more careful.\"\"Alright, then I'll trouble you, Fourth Brother.\"\"What are you thanking me for. Who asked me to be your Fourth Brother! I'm going off first.\" Sima You Le patted Sima You Yue's shoulder and left with large strides.Sima You Yue watched him leave and laughed languidly. She had caused such a major event but he had not even scolded her at all. Having this kind of family was really a blessing!When she pushed open the main door to the dormitory, she saw that Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi were sitting in the Pavilion watching and waving at her.She walked over and sat down, saying, \"What are you guys doing here?\"\"Waiting for you!\" Fatty Qu said, \"Did the Princ.i.p.al make things hard for you?\"\"Nope.\" Sima You Yue said.\"That's good.\" Fatty Qu let out a breath. He was afraid that Sima You Yue would also be expelled. If that happened, he would not have anymore good food to eat.\"What do you plan to do next? He Qui Zhi and her friend will probably leave the capital.\" Wei Zi Qi asked.\"I don't have to raise my hand against He Qiu Zhi. The Nalan Clan will definitely not let her off.\" Sima You Yue said, \"Right now, Nalan Lan has been expelled. In the future, it will be an issue between the Nalan Clan and my Sima Clan.\"\"You need to be careful of Nalan Lan's younger brother, Nalan Qi.\" Wei Zi Qi cautioned.\"Yes, I will.\" Sima You Yue said, \"From now I need to make use of every opportunity to cultivate and then go complete the mission with you all.\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Although she had been framed by her organization's second in charge, she did not carry on those bitter feelings to think that everyone in this world was a bad guy. She still subconsciously believed her own ability to discern. She could tell that Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi honestly treated her as a friend.But she also knew that because of her contract with the Spirit Pearl, she would subconsciously leak out a kind of aura that caused those with a similar spirit to her to draw near to her.When Sima You Yue returned to the General's residence, she related everything that happened to Sima Lie. Once Sima Lie heard that the Nalan Clan had attempted to kill Sima You Yue, he broke the desk in anger. He gritted his teeth and said, \"This Nalan Clan has always set itself against my Clan, but it has actually dared to scheme against You Yue! It seems that we have been too lenient on them recently!\"\"In any case, that Nalan Lan has been already been expelled from the academy and if we a.s.sume that they will continue their style of doing things, I'm afraid that they will not let Fifth Brother nor our family off the hook.\" Sima You Le said.\"What is there to worry about?! They won't let us off the hook, but neither do I intend to let them off!\" SIma You Ming's voice came in from the outside.Sima You Le watched as Sima You Ming walked in and asked, \"Second Brother, you've returned?\"\"Yup, I just came back when I heard you relate what happened.\" Sima You Ming said, \"That Nalan Clan could go cause trouble for Fifth Brother at any time. Grandfather, since we have already promised the other party that we will take care of Fifth Brother well, we can't let him be caught up in such danger now.\"Sima Lie nodded.\"Grandfather, Second Brother, what are you guys talking about?\" Sima You Le heard the conversation between the two of them and looked at them in surprise.Sima Lie and and Sima You Ming only now remembered that Sima You Le was still here and recalled that he did not know about Sima You Yue's ident.i.ty. They didn't expect that they would be furious to such an extent that they would even forget about this.Sima You Ming patted Sima You Le's shoulder, saying meaningfully, \"Actually, Fifth Brother isn't our brother by blood.\"\"What did you say?!\" Sima You Le had been so shocked by this piece of news that he started to shake all over, staring at Sima You Ming with disbelief.\"What I said is true.\" Sima You Ming said, \"You were still very young in the year that Fifth Brother arrived at our home, that's why it's to be expected that you don't remember this.\"\"Fifth Brother actually isn't our brother by blood\u2026\" Sima You Le repeated this fact to himself twice over before raising his head to ask Sima Lie, \"Then who are the parents of Fifth Brother?\"\"We are also not sure who his mother is. Our Sima Clan had always owed his father a favor. At that time, they handed him over to us before they disappeared, so we are also unclear what his real ident.i.ty is.\" Sima Lie said.At that time when the Sima Clan had just arrived in this small place, they encountered some danger and it just so happened that Sima You Yue's father saved them. At that time they said that in the future, if they had the chance to, they would repay him. Who would have thought that a few tens of years later, he found them and pa.s.sed Sima You Yue to them, even telling them not to let anyone know that Sima You Yue was a girl. At that time, only Sima Lie remained of the Sima Clan.In order to protect Sima You Yue, Sima Lie even told everyone outside that Sima You Yue was brought back by his own son. Actually, at that time, his son had already disappeared for a few years.It had to be noted that Sima You Yue's parents as well Sima You Le's parents both encountered the similar situation of disappearing. At least this point was consistant.At that time, Sima You Le was still really young so he didn't remember. However, Sima You Qi, Sima You Ming and Sima You Ran all knew that Sima You Yue was not their brother by birth. However, they still never treated him as an outsider, as continued to treat him with as much love as the youngest of the family of the Sima Clan.Sima You Le looked at his own Grandfather, then looked at his brother. They didn't look as if they were lying so he started to slowly digest this information.\"Grandfather, at that time, the person saved the life of our Sima Clan so today we must not watch as others harm Fifth Brother.\" Sima You Ming declared resolutely.\"Mm. That Nalan clan has always been looking for something to cripple our family. You should arrange for a shadow guard to surround the school compound to protect You Yue secretly once he leaves the school grounds. We cannot let the Nalan Clan cause any harm to him.\" Sima Lie said, \"As for within the school, I believe that Feng Zhi Xing will not allow even a single hair on him to be harmed.\"\"Oh yeah, what kind of ident.i.ty does that Feng Zhi Xing possess?\" Sima You Le questioned curiously.Sima Lie shook his head, \"I don't know either. I had asked that old coot in the school before, but even he doesn't know Feng Zhi Xing's true ident.i.ty. He only knows that he must be someone from another place, furthermore, he's here because of You Yue.\"\"Because of Fifth Brother?\"\"Mm. Feng Zhi Xing said, You Yue carried a life jade. A life jade is not something that just anybody can possess. The people who do possess it are normally those from the large clans, furthermore, it has to be left in the family's ancestral hall. The fact that You Yue has a life jade that actually isn't placed in her ancestral hall and was actually brought out by her father shows that her ident.i.ty isn't simple, neither is it safe.\"Talking about Sima You Yue's life jade, SIma You Le and his brother thought of the time when Sima You Yue had gone missing for those few months and they had to rely on the perfect state of the life jade in order to stay sane.\"It looks like this world doesn't have people who even know about something like a life jade.\" SIma You Le said.\"That's right. The people of this world don't know how to make this at all.\" Sima Lile said, \"They don't even have the materials to make it, much less have the strength to do it.\"\"So Fifth Brother's ident.i.ty must be from somewhere outside of this world?\" Sima You Ming asked.\"This is just my guess.\" Sima Lie said, \"However, at that time, Feng Zhi Xing said something when he came here to look at You Yue's life jade. At that time, he said that he was there when You Yue's life jade was being made. This proves that he must also be from that place, and so, he knows You Yue's ident.i.ty!\"\"Then will he tell Fifth Brother's ident.i.ty to him or not?\" Sima You Ming knitted his eyebrows in question.\"Not right now.\" Sima Lie said, \"Looking at the way he is, he's just here to see how You Yue is living. He's not here to tell him about the reality of his situation.\"Hearing what Sima Lie said, Sima You Ming and Sima You Le both sighed. Even if Sima You Yue wasn't their brother by birth, they had lived their lives together for so many years that they had the same brotherly affection as real brothers. They did not wish for anyone to disrupt their current life.\"Alright, enough. You Le, you should return to school. You Ming and I will discuss how to deal with that Nalan Clan.\" Sima Lie said.\"Okay, if you need me to do anything please tell me. I'm also a part of this Sima Clan!\" Sima You Le said seriously.\"Your responsibility right now is to cultivate properly and watch over Fifth Brother in school, that is enough.\" Sima You Ming patted Sima You Le's shoulder.\"Okay then, I will return first.\" Sima You Le shrugged and left the study room.When they watch Sima You Le leave, Sima You Ming turned to Sima Lie and asked, \"Grandfather, how do you plan to deal with the Nalan Clan\u2026\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

A single stone causing a thousand waves, every single street was discussing this.Nalan Clan.In the hall, the Head of the Nalan Clan sat on his seat with two elders sitting at each side. Everyone else sat at either side.In the middle of the house, Nalan Lan was clad in blue as she sat on the ground with her head lowered. Her long hair cascaded down her back, covering her cheek.Nalan Qi also knelt at a side, looking at the rising tension that locked them in a stalemate, he said, \"Father, you cannot blame Elder Sister for this. It's all because of Sima You Yue. If not for him, Elder Sister would not have been expelled from school!\"\"You still dare to speak!\" Nalan slammed the teacup in his hand on the table and looked at Nalan Lan and Nalan Qi, who were kneeling, and berated, \"You knew that this kind of things were not allowed in the premises of the Academy but you just had to do it. Now that you've been expelled, you've thrown away the face of the entire Nalan Clan!\"Nalan Lan lowered her head, not daring to utter a single word.\"Clan Head, Lan'er never thought that things would become like this. She thought that that trash would die simple, but who would have thought that he would survive and come back.\" An elder at the side said, \"Lan'er just wanted to strike at that old coot Sima Lie. Didn't you see, when that waste went missing, we were really able to sieze the opportunity to strike at that Sima Clan.\"\"That's right, Clan Head, Lan'er is such a gifted child, just because we don't have the Academy, does it mean that the Nalan Clan will be unable to train the younger generation?\" Yet another elder helped speak on behalf of Nalan Lan.\"But this matter of being expelled by the school has caused how much embarra.s.sment to our clan?! We can't let this go unpunished, you are now confined to the family ancestral hall to devote yourself to repentance for 3 months. You better reflect on your actions thoroughly!\" After listening to the two elders absolve his own daughter of guilt, Nalan Lan was more relaxed and gave Nalan Lan a very superficial punishment.Nalan Lan bowed slightly before standing up to leave. From the beginning to the end, she did not utter a single word. Everyone thought that she was in shock by the situation, however, her eyes revealed hatred and malice. Once she was released from the ancestral hall, she would definitely take the life of that useless tras.h.!.+After Nalan Lan left, the elder waved his hand to dismiss the younger generation since they had no need to partic.i.p.ate in the later conversation.\"Clan Head, this time, the Sima Clan is directly shedding all pretense of cordiality!\" The Second Elder said.\"This time, that Sima Clan has caused us great disgrace. We definitely have to take revenge on them!\" Nalan gritted his teeth and said, \"It just so happens that when we went to visit the old ancestor, he also said that we should quickly cause their family to fall. Since that's the case, we should quickly make use of all our networks.\"After understanding what the old ancestor meant, the First and Second elder nodded simultaneously.The Sima Clan had always wanted to suppress the Nalan Clan. This time, they would definitely need to take the Sima Clan down.As a result, the feud between these two clans and moved from the shadows, and started to be displayed on stage for all to see. Regardless of the domain, the two clans would always fight as if it was a you-live-I-die kind of situation.With regards to their unrestrained battles, even while in school, Sima You Yue knew of a few. However, Sima Lie had ordered her to stay in school and did not allow her to come out so she could only stay in school to work hard and become stronger.For a month after that, Sima You Yue remained inside the Spirit Pearl to practice pill refinement.Before, she had already almost mastered pill purification. After practicing for a new more days, she set her sights on the second stage, fusion.This time, during fusion, Sima You Yue chose the easiest pill to practice, the Coagulation Pill.This Coagulation Pill only need four kinds of ingredients. Furthermore, they were relatively milder ingredients and the chances of exploding would be relatively smaller with higher chances of success. It was an introductory pill that was generally used by Alchemists.After letting Little Spirit finish preparing the Spirit Ingredients, Sima You Yue went to look over the steps of refining the pill once again to make sure she had memorised it all before she began to purify the ingredients.The most important step of pill refinement was purification and she was already extremely familiar with this step so she very quickly finished purifying all four ingredients. She separated the purified ingredients according to type before placing two into the pill furnace. After a while, she placed yet another type inside.Thinking back on how things exploded the last time, Sima You Yue had some lingering fear when she put the pill ingredients in. She was extremely nervous that putting the ingredients in would cause the same occurrence as the last time.However, the pill ingredients this time could be said to have given her more face as nothing like an explosion occurred, allowing her heave a huge sigh of relief.Following the directions from the book, she controlled the intensity of the flame. At this moment, she realised that not having your own flame was really a troublesome thing for pill concoction.After a few more minutes, Sima You Yue finally added in the last most important pill ingredient and it was still good, this time, nothing like an explosion occurred.However, just when she thought that she was successful, a grunting sound came from inside the furnace, followed by a puff. A pasty smell leaked out from the hole in the pill furnace cover, declaring her failed attempt at fusion.Sima You Yue put out the fire before opening the cover of the pill furnace. As she expected, she saw a dark black pasty sludge and could not help but to heave a sigh of disappointment.\"Yue Yue, do not be disappointed. This is merely your first time, failure is extremely normal. You just need more experience. Little Roar appeared beside her and comforted her.\"I'm not disappointed.\" Sima You Yue shook her head and said, \"I was just thinking that refining pills was really not an easy task.\"\"Of course.\" Little Spirit also appeared in the air and said, \"My previous owner told me before that just looking at the steps to refining pills was not easy, but there is a reason why it has obstructed so many thousands of Spirit Masters. When refining pills, every single minute of heat control and every single step of control needs to be precious. Further, its requirement on Spirit Power can be said to be to be found only one in a thousand.\"\"It looks like I can't do without instruction from a teacher.\" Sima You Yue touched her chin and began to think of who she should choose to teach her, however, she had gone through the list of Pill Masters in her brain without managing to find anyone suitable.\"They're all so repulsive, I wouldn't be able to learn much from them.\" Thinking of how all those Pill Masters always had their nose in the air, Sima You Yue had rejected all of them.If those Pill Masters knew that they were treated by someone with such disdain, who knew whether or not they would be hopping about in anger!\"Forget it, I might as well try to practice on my own first. When that time comes that I meet a good Pill Master, then I'll think about how to hail him as a Master.\" Sima You Yue finished speaking before she took yet another pill ingredient to begin practicing once again.Three days later, she finally managed to fuse her first liquid pill.\"Now it's time for the last step, binding!\" Sima You Yue let out a long breath before putting her hand before the pill furnace, condensing her Spirit Power and sending it gently into the pill furnace.\"Bang-\"Once the Spirit Power came into contact with the liquid pill, it resulted in a huge explosion. The pill furnace directly exploded, sending splinters flying about everywhere. Sima You Yue had also been sent flying by the explosion.\"d.a.m.n it! It exploded again!\"Before she fainted, in her daze she saw a faintly discernible red silhouette appear by her side, as well as a pair of complicated eyes stare directly at her.Chapter 64: \u201cFurnace explodes again\u2026\u201dCan\u2019t wait for your next dose?

You'll squash her and make her unable to wake up.\" Little Roar flew over, picking Ling Long up.Ling Long moved and threw off Little Roar's claws, falling on Ya Guang's back, hatefully glaring at Little Roar.\"Master should have already regained her consciousness.\" Ya Guang took a sniff at Sima You Yue's body as he said.Ling Long took a look at the transparent silhouette at the side before pursing her lips to say, \"Hey, we can take care of Master. What is a guy like you running out for.\"\"Whoa, don't tell me you've taken a fancy to Yue Yue?\" Little Roar started to roar dangerously at Mo Sha, \"I'll say it first, Yue Yue is ours, you better not s.n.a.t.c.h her from us!\"Mo Sha glanced coolly over these few beasts. Without taking any notice of them, he put all his attention over Sima You Yue's body, his eyes containing traces of serene and hidden meaning.Little Roar looked at Mo Sha, then looked at Sima You Yue. What was this guy looking at Yue Yue for? Something was up!Sima You Yue heard Little Roar and the rest quarrel incessantly beside her ear and felt that her brain was going to explode. However, she was unable to open her eyes.\"Just wait for me to get up, I'll teach you all a lesson!\" Sime You Yue could not help but think.Although she could not open her eyes, her thoughts were completely clear. Her current nerves was also exceptionally sensitive so every single pain on her body was amplified by multiple times.Just as she felt that she was going to faint from the pain, a 'ka-cha' sound echoed beside her body, followed by an ice-cold aura that came from her lower abdomen, out to her four limbs and the rest of her body.The scorching pain subsided following that aura and finally disappeared.That aura circled a few times before returning to her lower abdomen, finally staying still.Sima You Yue slowly opened her eyes and could not longer see the silhouettes of Little Roar and the rest. It was probably that they saw she was fine and then ran off to play.\"Master, you're awake.\" Ya Guang saw that Sima You Yue had woken up and said anxiously.Sima You Yue sat up. The first one she looked at was not Ya Guang, but Mo Sha, who was seated at the side.How come this guy was out?She kneaded her forehead, saying, \"Ya Guang, how long was I unconscious?\"\"You weren't unconscious for long, in half a day you regained your consciousness. However, after regaining your consciousness, you slept for another two and a half days, so it's been about three days.\" Ya Guang answered from the side.\"Three days?\" Sima You Yue looked at Ya Guang in shock. She made sure that he was not exaggerating as she started to mutter incessantly in her heart. She had felt that only a little while had pa.s.sed, how had it been three days?At this moment, she finally noticed her hands. They were smooth and without scars, just like in the past.She remembered that when the pill stove exploded, the flying splinters had gashed a long red wound. How come it was gone?\"Healed.\" Mo Sha suddenly opened his mouth in reply.Sima You Yue's astonished gaze turned towards Mo Sha. This sentence was him telling her that the wound on her hand had been healed?\"Very surprised?\" Mo Sha looked at Sima You Yue, \"It's not just the wound on your hand that has healed, the other wounds on the rest of your body have also healed.\"Sima You Yue touched the wounds on her body and realised that they did not hurt anymore.\"How\u2026 come.\" Sima You Yue concealed her outward surprise, looking at Mo Sha to ask, \" Was it you who healed me?\"Mo Sha shook his head, saying, \"You did it.\"\"Me?\" SIma You Yue pointed at herself doubtfully. It was obvious she didn't believe what Mo Sha said.\"Master, it really was you who healed yourself.\" Ya Guang said from the side, \"When you were unconscious, your wounds started getting better one by one. At that time, all of us were really shocked!\"\"It was really me?\" Sima You Yue still felt that this was too incredible, however, Ya Guang was a very honest one, he would not lie to its own owner. It had already said that she was the one who had healed it, so it should be the truth.But when did she gain such an awesome natural ability?Just as she was daydreaming, Mo Sha suddenly drifted over, landing in front of Sima You Yue, giving her a huge fright.\"What are you doing?!\" Seeing this suddenly enlarged face, although it was very attractive, it would still scare a person okay!\"There's a problem with your body.\" Mo Sha sniffed at Sima You Yue's body and said coldly.Sima You Yue saw that Mo Sha was looking at her as if she was some kind of prey and unconsciously tried to push him, however, her hand went through his body.\"What problem do I have! Isn't it just that I have some intrepid natural ability! You're the one who has a problem!\"Mo Sha left Sima You Yue and said, \"A seal has been placed on your body!\"\"Seal? What kind of seal?\" Sima You Yue stood up and bent her head to look down at her body but she didn't see anything out of the ordinary.\"Have you seen any person that's been injured in an explosion, but even without eating any pills, they were able to recover in two days?\" Mo Sha said.\"It appears that I haven't.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Have you had this experience before?\" Mo Sha asked again.Sima You Yue sifted through her memories but shook her head. In the past, this body would get wounded frequently, but she always had to rely on pills in order to recover. She really never went through this kind of experience before.\"Don't tell me that my natural ability has something to do with the seal?\" Sima You Yue looked at Mo Sha and asked.\"During the moment of explosion, I felt a familiar aura.\" Mo Sha said, \"I'm trying to ascertain whether or not it is that, but you always remained unconscious, so I had no way of doing so.\"\"How would you ascertain it?\" Sima You Yue asked, \"also, what is this matter about the seal?\"\"You have to let me check first before I can answer your question.\" Mo Sha said.\"You have to first tell me what method you are going to use to check.\" Sima You Yue looked at Mo Sha distrustfully, but this big devil, if he wanted to play any tricks, he could sell her and she would still be able to fetch him some money.\"I will enter your body.\" Mo Sha said.The moment Sima You Yue heard it, she got angry and shouted at him, \"I knew it, you would definitely have some kind of warped idea! If I let you enter my body, what if you seize control? What if you harm my body? I would definitely not agree to something like this!\"Mo Sha never expected that Sima You Yue would have such a big reaction and said, \"I won't harm you!\"\"Pui! There's no way I would believe that!\" Sima You Yue said, \"I've done my research. The books say that devils are the least trustworthy. You'll say now that you won't harm me but what if you go back on your words after you enter my body? I don't want to do it!\"Mo Sha looked at the way Sima You Yue was looking at him disdainfully and he was enraged. A vortex started to form around him.\"What, I've guessed too accurately now you want to kill me to silence me? This place is my territory!\" Sima You Yue shouted at Mo Sha.The aura surrounding Mo Sha gradually subsided and eventually became like before. If it wasn't for the fact that the surrounding area was no longer the same, Sima You Yue would not have been able to tell that he had gotten angry.\"It's impossible for me to harm you. Because\u2026 we've already established contract.\" Mo Sha said this sentence slowly, successfully rooting Sima You Yue to the spot in shock.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Click on our to add to the queue!Chapter 66: Light Devil Body Physique\"Con-contract?\"Mo Sha nodded, confirming that it was true.\"At that time, why didn't I feel that we had entered a contract?\" Sima You Yue felt it was strange and asked.\"Because I blocked it.\" Mo Sha said.Sima You Yue scrutinised this Mo Sha and was secretly fearful. Being able to block the contract between two people such that she was unable to feel a thing\u2026 even if she had only been in this world for a short period of time, she knew that this was something that was practically impossible.However, he had done it. Furthermore, it was done when he was still an incomplete spirit. How terrifying was he in his past life!\"However, the stronger he is, I believe, the more things he will know how to do.\" Sima You Yue contemplated in her heart, \"If he has established a contract with me, wouldn't I have an overwhelming advantage? Who knows, I may even be able to gain much more things from him.\"Mo Sha noticed that Sima You Yue's eyes were turning and knew that she had thought of some warped idea yet again. However, he could not be bothered with it and closed his eyes for awhile before opening them to look at her, saying, \"Enough.\"Sima You Yue felt it for a moment then realised she really had another connection with Mo Sha.\"When did we establish a contract?\" She still felt it was incredulous when she asked.The other party was a devil, furthermore, was in a spirit state. How did they form a contract with each other?\"When you broke the Illusion Array, I don't know how you entered into a contract with the Spirit Stone. Since I lived in there, of course I entered into a contract with you as well.\" Mo Sha's face blackened considerably when he thought of this, \"In any case, will you let me go and check now? I'll take a look at what this seal is.\"Talking about the seal on her body, Sima You Yue also became more serious. Who knew that her body would actually have some a weird thing. She didn't know what this seal was for, who gave it to her and why she had it.\"Come then.\"She nodded towards Mo Sha. She didn't know how he planned to enter her body and was going to ask when Mo Sha turned into a kind of black ray, shooting into the s.p.a.ce between her eyebrows.At the moment he entered, Sima You Yue felt a biting chill and unconsciously broke out into s.h.i.+vers.\"How is this guy's temperature so cold.\" Sima You Yue could not help but jest, \"If he doesn\u2019t come out soon, I'll turn into an ice cube.\"After more than a little while, just before Sima You Yue's body reached its limit, Mo Sha came out from between her eyebrows. The moment he left, the freezing cold also left with him.\"How is it? What is that seal?\" Sima You Yue noticed that Mo Sha was looked at her with a complicated expression and asked. Seeing how he refused to answer, she said, \"Don't tell me that a bomb is sealed within my body?\"\"Not a bomb, but something like it.\" Mo Sha had followed Sima You Yue for such a long time that he knew what she was talking about when she said the word bomb.\"It's really a bomb?!\" Sima You Yue's expression was wrecked with grief, \"I was just randomly spouting guessing, who knew that I would guess it.\"\"I said that it wasn't a bomb.\" Mo Sha said.\"Fine, no matter what is is, I still have to know what it is.\" Sima You Yue pursed her lips, saying, \"Say it, what is sealed within my body?\"\"Light Devil Body Physique.\" When Mo Sha said this, his voice trembled slightly, as if he was quite agitated.Sima You Yue had been shocked by his three words, so.. So she didn't notice his agitation.\"What is a Light Devil Body Physique? Why is it sealed?\"\"If it was not sealed, I'm afraid that your body would have exploded when you were two or three years old.\"\"So terrifying?\" SIma You Yue attempted to find a word that would properly describe its extent, but failed. \"Then what is it exactly?\"\"This world is separated into light and darkness. You should know this right?\" Mo Sha looked at Sima You Yue.\"Don't I just have to look at you to know.\" Sima You Yue felt that Mo Sha would talk for a long time so she casually took out a chair from her interspatial ring, sitting down to listen slowly.Mo Sha looked at what Sima You Yue did and could not help but turn his face completely black. This brat was just incomparably worried just seconds ago, but she was now taking out a chair to sit down and listen?\"People from the world of light have a physique that will only be found after a few hundred thousand years. This kind of physique actually contains a kind of aura. This aura will let them cultivate at speeds that surpa.s.s normal Spirit Masters by more than a few times, furthermore, their bottlenecks are few. As a result, they have very strong abilities to recover. This kind of body is called a Light Body Physique.\"So powerful!\" Sima You Yue's mouth opened wide in shock, \"If one managed to encounter this kind of body, wouldn't this be super-ultra out of this world!\"\"On the other hand, in the Dark world, those with dark auras are termed Devil Body Physiques. If one was able to use one of the two types, to the average person, this would be seen as an extremely fortuitous event.\" Mo Sha said, \"However, you are not the same as them.\"\"You said I possess a Light Devil Body Physique, don't tell me that you're saying I have both kinds?\" Sima You Yue said.Mo Sha gave her an appraising look, saying straightforwardly, \"That's right. You have both kinds of auras in your body. One represents the light while one represents the darkness. Both are at odds with each other but they now reside in one body. What do you think will happen? Furthermore, at that time, you were just a baby, you would have been killed with even a little bit of shock.\"\"No wonder it has to be sealed.\" Sima You Yue said. After that, she thought about something and looked straight at Mo Sha, asking, \"Now that this seal has been broken, won't I be 100% dead?\"\"Not for the time being.\" Mo Sha replied, \"However, this doesn't mean that you won't in the future.\"Sima You Yue looked at Mo Sha and beamed, saying, \"You definitely have an way to deal with it, right?\"Mo Sha raised his eyebrows, \"How are you so sure?\"\"Since we've had a contract, if I die, you also wouldn't be able to live on. However, you don't look worried at all.\" Simna You Yue declared a.s.suredly, \"Anyway, you managed to recognise right away that I have a Light Devil Body Physique, so you definitely have seen experienced like this before. Or, you are one, or you have encountered one before.The way Mo Sha looked at Sima You Yue changed a lot in a moment. He never expected that this brat would actually have a brain.\"Your Lords.h.i.+p knows that his charm is hard to contain, but you still don't have to look at me like that.\"Sima You Yue pinched her nonexistent fringe and pretended to show off, causing Mo Sha to roll his eyes.\"You still haven't said what kind you are!\" Sima You Yue said.\"I was like you, in the past.\" Mo Sha said this sentence slowly.Although Sima You Yue had guessed it, hearing it from Mo Sha himself still gave her a bit of surprise.\"Then, then how did you turn into someone from the Devil Clan?\"Mo Sha glanced over at Sima You Yue, before looking in the distance, saying, \"When I was young, I was also a human. I didn't grow up in the Devil Clan.\"Sima You Yue looked at Mo Sha and felt waves of hurt coming from her own body.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Click on our to add to the queue!Chapter 67: Secret of Soul RefinementSima You Yue had been given a huge shock by Mo Sha's words. He wasn't a person from the Devil Clan, so how did he end up this way?\"Then how did you end up in the Devil Clan?\" Looking at the way Mo Sha was, she was unable to control her curiosity.Mo Sha was only melancholic for a while before he quickly regained his original mood, replying, \"My father was a human, my mother was from the Devil Clan, so technically Devil blood flowed through my body.\"\"So this why you ended up with a Light-Devil Body.\" Sima You Yue nodded her head with understanding.If his father was a human, his body would not possibly have any dark aura. Thinking up to this point, her heart started to fl.u.s.ter. Didn't this mean that one of her parents wasn't human?!\"Your current situation is similar to mine from the past. Now that the seal has been opened, it actually doesn't threaten you that much. In fact, it is even a good thing.\" Mo Sha was clearly no longer talking about himself as he looked at Sima You Yue and said, \"Now the two auras that you have are still are the stage at which you can control them, so they won't explode within your body. However, the Light Devil Body Physique will cause your cultivation speed to be several times high than others. Your innate skill has already been several notches above other average people and now you will be even more powerful.\"\"Really?\" SIma You Yue's eyes shone as she looked at Mo Sha. If he wasn't just in Spirit form, she might have even really run over to give him a hug and give him a huge kiss.\"You shouldn't be happy too soon.\" Mo Sha saw the way she was acting and could not help but to rain on her parade, \"Just as your strength increases, the conflict between the the two auras present will also increase. If you are unable to control it when that time comes, you will be in danger.\"When he said this, Sima You Yue was not too worried.\"In any case, don't you have a way to solve it? Since you managed to survive at that time, I'll be able to survive too!\"This simple yet confident statement cause Mo Sha's heart to shudder. At that time, he himself was just a young frivolous kid, he was also full of confidence. When he found out that he possessed a Light Devil body physique, he also believed he would be able to survive. When the time came, he really did survive, it was just that the process of it was quite painful.\"Oh right, what's the method that you talked about?\" Sima You Yue looked up and asked.\"There's no point telling you about this now.\" Mo Sha said cooly.\"Ugh, pretending again.\" Sima Yue Yue curled her lip. However, even if she continued to question him, if this guy really had no plans to talk, he really would not budge an inch. Anyway she believed right now that he wouldn't harm her.Mo Sha pretended not to hear anything that Sima You Yue said, asking, \"Alright, I've explained to you the circ.u.mstances regarding your body. Now let me talk about something else.\"\"There's something else?\"\"Pill Refinement, explosion.\" Mo Sha said languidly.\"This?\" Sima You Yue raised her eyebrows, \"I also don't know why. During pill refinement, it keeps exploding although I clearly followed all the steps on this book.\"\"I was watching you refine pills. Your actual skills can still be deemed pa.s.sable but the problem comes from your control over the fire.\" Mo Sha explained, \"Every pill, every stage has a different degree of fire. Even a little difference can cause your pill refinement to fail.\"\"You know how to refine pills?\" Sima You Yue raised her eyebrows in surprise. From the way he was talking, he didn't seem like an amateur at all.\"I do.\" Mo Sha admitted.\"What rank?\"\"You will know in the future.\" Mo Sha replied, \"In any case, it's high enough to guide you.\"\"Tsk.\" Sima You Yue rolled her eyes at him. This guy really liked to act blur. \"If you don't tell me, then how will I know whether or not you really know how?\"Mo Sha creased his eyebrows, saying unhappily \"If you don\u2019t want to learn then forget it.\"\"Hey hey hey, I didn't say I didn't want to learn!\" Sima You Yue saw that Mo Sha was quite done with dealing with her, and beamed, \"If you don\u2019t want to say it then fine! In any case, we're now on the same boat. If I become stronger, I'll be able to help you find your other half more efficiently! I also don't have to worry about you taking advantage of me.\"Mo Sha looked down, as if he was closing his eyes in contemplation. Him being willing to teach her how to refine pills was not without personal motives.\"Enough, I'll tell you about the basics of Pill Refinement\u2026\"After listening to Mo Sha's explanation, Sima You Yue was able to understand Pill Refinement even more.It turns out that Pill Refinement really wasn't as easy as she though. Those three steps may have seemed easy, but they held tens and millions of other points. If even one of them was wrong, one was unable to become a Pill Master.\"No wonder there are so many Spirit Masters but so few Alchemists.\" Sima You Yue touched her chin.\"All these things require a certain prerequisite.\" Mo Sha said.\"What prerequisite?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"A very strong mental strength.\" After Mo Sha finished speaking, he gave Sima You Yue a once-over. Her mental strength could be said to be the strongest he had ever seen amongst his peers. If she didn't have such a huge amount of mental strength, he would never have thought of teaching her.\"A very strong mental strength?\"When refining pills, you need to use your mental strength to control it, especially for higher grade pills where refinement is even more complex, it is extremely taxing on your mental strength. The stronger your mental strength, the easier and further your walk will be on the road to Pill Refinement.\" Mo Sha explained.\"So this is the case.\" Sima You Yue clutched both hands to her head, leaned on the back of her chair, looked towards Mo Sha and asked, \"Aren't you someone from the Devil Clan? How do you know how humans refine pills?\"\"Humans and the Devil Clan have the same methods of Pill Refinement. It's just that the fusing process is a bit different.\" Mo Sha said, \"When Humans are at the last stages of Pill Refinement, they need to inject Spirit Power of the light attribute, while those of the Devil Clan inject Spirit Power of the dark attribute. For some of the same types of pills, if someone of the Devil Clan eats the pill with Light Spirit Power injected, that pill will become poisonous instead. Vice versa, Humans can't eat pills that are imbued with Dark Spirit Power.\"Understand.\" Sima You Yue nodded.\"Place this Spirit Stone on your forehead.\" Mo Sha said.Sima You Yue did not know what he wanted to do but she followed his instructions. She took the Spirit Stone and placed it on her forehead. Once her forehead came into contact with the spirit stone, a brilliant ray of light shot out from the Spirit Stone. After that, information was poured in through the s.p.a.ce between her eyebrows.\"This is a way of strengthening one's mental power. You just have to follow what it says and practice in order to increase your mental power.\" Mo Sha said.Sima You Yue closed her eyes to feel for a bit and realised that aside from Imperial Beast Arts from before, there existed another book full of old auras in her consciousness.\"Secret of soul refinement.\" Sima You Yue looked at the words on this book and her heart felt an indescribable tremor. She opened her eyes and looked at Mo Sha while asking, \"Isn't it to train my mental strength? How come it's the secret to refining souls?\"\"The bigger your soul, the stronger your mental power.\" Mo Sha explained simply, \"Enough, we'll go to the pill refinement room now. You should practice making the pill you did before. I will stand beside you and instruct you.\"\"Okay.\" Hearing Mo Sha say it in this way, Sima You Yue kept away all her questions and curiosities towards the secret of soul refinement and brought him to the Alchemy room.She would slowly ask him all these questions in the future. Right now, the proper thing to do was to learn how to refine pills.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Under Mo Sha's careful watch, she purified each type.As Mo Sha watched her refine, his eyes revealed traces of praise.She had not been practicing Alchemy for long, however, her actions were very proficient. She appeared not only to have talent in Alchemy, but was also very hardworking and determinedAfter refining the medicinal ingredients, Sima You Yue looked to the side, towards Mo Sha.\"Put the ingredients into the Pill Furnace in order. I will tell you what to take note off at every step.\" Mo Sha said.Sima You Yue sucked in a deep breath. As she placed the purified ingredients successively into the pill furnace, Mo Sha would always voice out when it was time to place the second ingredient or time to control the fire.With Mo Sha giving directions, after half an hour, a pill with a faint medicinal smell slowly emerged.\"Okay, put out the fire.\" Mo Sha said.Sima You Yue extinguished the fire that was under the pill furnace. In her heart, she complained that if she had her personal flames, it would not be so troublesome whenever she wanted to put out the fire.She opened the pill furnace and took out a pill from within. Although it appeared a little bit ugly, this was the first pill that she had successfully alchemised. Just thinking about it made her emotional.However, Mo Sha was not too satisfied with her end result, saying, \"Let me refine it once, you should stand at my side and watch carefully.\"\"Oh.\" Sima You Yue knew that this was Mo Sha's way of looking down on her final product, however, this did not influence the way she felt.She took out a jade pill bottle and placed the pill inside before standing to the side to watch how Mo Sha did it. Looking at how he stood in front of the pill furnace without moving, she touched her chin and thought, \"How does a spirit even do Alchemy anyway.\"\"I will intentionally slow down my actions, you have to watch carefully.\" After Mo Sha said this, with a thought, a ball of black colored flame appeared in his hand. He casually flung it and that flame flew to the bottom of the pill furnace. Once that pill furnace was hot, he placed the ingredients in to refine one by one.At the moment that the black flame appeared, Sima You Yue felt a kind of terrifying temperature. However, she had been pressed down by that pressure. If not for the fact that her soul was a bit more sensitive, it would have been hard to discover it.She wanted to ask Mo Sha what kind of flame this was. However, once she saw that he only doing the refining process, she swallowed her question and seriously studied what he did.Although Mo Sha had intentionally slowed down his movements, he had only used half the time that she did to refine a pill.He took back his flame then asked Sima You Yue to take out the pill.Sima You Yue quickly stepped forward, opening the cover with unparalleled excitement. Inside it lay pills that were perfectly round and smelled intoxicating. One could tell with a single look that it was more than a few times better than the pill that she had refined.\"Alright, you should first digest the information that I told you and ponder over it on your own.\" After saying this, Mo Sha returned to the Spirit Stone before Sima You Yue could even ask him about his black flame.\"Left in such a hurry.\" Sima You Yue pursed her lips and thought to ask him the next time. She sat on a stool and closed her eyes. Mo Sha's earlier actions during his refinement of the pill played out before her eyes.After one day, Little Spirit smelled a fragrant scent and his eyes flashed. In a moment, he appeared at the Alchemy Room.\"Master, you successfully refined a pill?\"Sima You Yue placed the pill that she had just made into her jade bottle and ignored Little Spirit's gluttonous appearance, saying, \"Yep, just successfully refined one.\"\"Haha, didn't I say that you would definitely be able to become an Alchemist!\" Little Spirit laughed out happily and looked at Sima You Yue as if he was looking at a precious child.Sima You Yue threw the Jade bottle into Little Spirit's hands, saying, \"Tidy it up.\"After that, with a flash, she left the Spirit Pearl.Little Spirit saw that the Alchemy Room was in a complete mess and waved his little hand, returning the room to its original clean state. After that, he held the jade bottle gleefully and disappeared.Inside the house, Sima You Yue sat cross legged on the bed. In a moment, she opened her eyes and spat out a breath of muddy qi because the fatigue of alchemy just now had completely disappeared.\"Yue Yue, while you were locked away these few days, Fatty Qu and the rest came to find you a few times.\" Little Roar saw that Sima You Yue had woken up and said as it lay on the table.\"Is anything wrong?\" Sima You Yue got down from the bed.\"I don't know. They only wandered about by the gate for a while then thought you were cultivating so they didn't knock.\" Little Roar's tiny legs wiggled as it thought to flip over, however, it failed after trying a few times.Sima You Yue walked over and bent her head down, stretching out a hand to help flip it over, saying indifferently, \"You should diet.\"She opened the door and left after saying it.Little Roar lay on the table. Watching Sima You Yue's back, its eyes filled with tears as it howling with grief: you're the one who made me fat in the past, but now you're ignoring me because I'm fat!Sima You Yue walked out the room and just happened to see Ouyang Fei enter from outside. A faint scent of blood wafted from his body.\"You're injured?\"Ouyang Fei looked over at her without saying a word and returned to his own house.Sima You Yue touched her nose. The pressure around this guy was comparatively lower today, could he have been beaten up by someone?\"Yue Yue, you've come out from seclusion?\" Wei Zi Qi came out from his own house and smiled towards Sima You Yue.\"Yeah.\" Sima You Yue nodded, \"Little Roar said that you guys came to find me during this period of time?\"\"Right, it has to do with our mission. We actually wanted to discuss some things with you, how seeing how there wasn't any activity while you were in your room, we didn't want to disturb you.\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"Did anything happen?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"It's because our mission this time is a bit more difficult so we decided to move out earlier. In any case, cla.s.ses have stopped recently. So we were planning on waiting until you came out before moving.\" Wei Zi Qi said quite apologetically. It was actually a collective thing but they hadn't waited for Sima You Yue to come out before making a decision.\"So quick?\" Sima You Yue was a little surprised. Looking at the way Wei Zi Qi was acting, she smiled and said, \"It looks like I've ended up wasting everyone's journey time. Since this is the case, let me pack up a little and go back to let my Grandfather know before going.\"\"You don't have to rush.\" Wei Zi Qi said, \"Looking at Ouyang Fei, it looks like we can't go for the next two days. You can take your time to prepare.\"\"Alright. Then I'll go back first and be back tomorrow.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Okay.\" Wei Zi Qi nodded and watched as Sima You Yue closed the door behind her. He suddenly thought of something and called out after her, \"Oh right, during the time that you were in closed door cultivation, that He Qiu Zhi has been discovered dead in the city. The other party has acted so efficiently, it should have been done by the Nalan Clan.\"Hearing news of He Qiu Zhi's death, Sima You Yue was not surprised. She knew that the Nalan Clan would definitely not let her off.She waved to Wei Zi Qi before turning to leave.Those who wished to harm her would die sooner or later.Returning to the General's residence, Sima You Yue looked for Sima You Lie to tell him about her need to leave for a period of time to complete a mission. At first, Sima Lie did not agree, however, in the face of her coaxing and pestering, he agreed reluctantly.Watching her leave, he shouted to his main servant, \"Fifth Young Master wants to go out, go and send some men to protect him.\"\"Yes, Lord.\" The main servant sent out the order and arranged for some people to guard him.Sima You Yue stayed at home for that night and left on the morning of the second day to return back to school. After walked along a few streets, she entered a small alley.\"Since you've come, why bother hiding?\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

It was only through listening to his words that the person realised he had brought him here intentionally.\"I never expected that though you are trash, you were able to discover our presence.\" A man clad in black came out from behind a kind of shelter and looked coldly at Sima You Yue.Another person came out from another alley, trapping Sima You Yue inside this alley.Sima You Yue looked at the person who had just spoken and said, \"Nalan Qi, you're so weak but you still want to play at shadowing another person? Don't make me laugh!\"\"You trash, you're about to die but your mouth is still so sharp!\" Nalan Qi looked at Sima You Yue with eyes that flashed with bloodthirst. \"You're the reason why my sister has been locked in solitude for a month. I definitely will have my revenge today!\"\"Want to kill me?\" Sima You Yue was extremely familiar with things like bloodthirst. She laughed coldly, \"You think you can kill me?\"\"Haha, even without talking about the bodyguard behind you that is a First Ranked Spirit Master, I am a magnificent Eighth Ranked Spirit Warrior. How could we be unable to defeat you, a mere waste who can't even sense Spirit Power?\" Nalan Qi looked at Sima You Yue as if he was an idiot, \"We were unable to beat you to death the last time, but today we will definitely let you meet the King of h.e.l.l and let you have the true taste of fear right in front of my eyes.\"\"Mm, you've spoken well. I'd also like to let you have a true taste of fear right in front of my eyes. Since we have the same goal, why don't we stop wasting words and just get right into it!\" Sima You Yue turned and ran right after she said this.\"You want to run? Grab him!\" Nalan Qi watched Sima You Yue run and thought that he was going to escape. He wanted the person who was blocking the other alley to grab on to him.When that bodyguard saw Sima You Yue run to him with such speed, he was thunderstruck. He never thought that this waste would actually run from the middle of the alley to the place right in front of him in but a few breaths.When he heard Nalan Qi's order, he began to condense his spirit power. Even while he was surprised, he did not forget to throw a Spirit Ball right at Sima You Yue.When Sima You Yue saw the Spirit Ball approaching her, she moved her body and ran a few large strides along the wall, dodging the trajectory of the Spirit Ball completely.\"Bang-\"The Spirit Ball detonated on the ground, creating an explosion of dust.When the bodyguard thought he had succeeded, Sima You Yue's silhouette appeared from the wall. A dagger appeared in her hand as she sped in front of him, smiling maliciously. While he was surprised, she slashed at his neck before jumping away.The bodyguard felt a chill emanate from his heart when he saw Sima You Yue's smile. He never expected that even before he could react, he felt his neck go numb and watched as his own blood spurted from his neck.\"Bang-\"His body fell backwards. Right to the point of his death, he still did not understand how this person, who was rumored to be a waste, could managed to dodge his attack and how did he move so quickly? Furthermore, how could that inexplicably dense murderous aura manage to appear on the body of a pampered little waste?Nalan Qi arrived at the edge of the dust cloud and waited for the dust to settle to see Sima You Yue's corpse. He never expected that he would see Sima You Yue's completely unharmed body standing in front of him instead. Further, behind Sima You Yue was his own bodyguard lying dead on the group.\"You didn't die?!\" He called out with shock.If he had taken the attack that was thrown by his bodyguard just now, he would have been seriously injured even if he had managed to survive. However, Sima You Yue didn't even receive a single injury, how was this possible?!Sima You Yue smiled sinisterly, \"You're not dead yet, so how could I be?\"\"Hmph, even if you lucked out and managed to avoid it, you won't be so lucky this time!\" Nalan Qi began to gather his own Spirit Energy the moment he finished speaking.\"Actually I didn't plan on taking your life so early. However, since you're presented yourself to me, how could I not accept your good will?\" Sima You Yue also began to condense her Spirit Energy as she spoke.Nalan Qi looked at Sima You Yue and shouted in astonishment, \"You're a Spirit Master?!\"Sima You Yue smiled in reply. Towards someone who had tried to kill her so many times, she would definitely not show any kindness.Nalan Clan.Nalan Lan sat in her own house and her heart felt a bit restless, as if something was bad was going to happen.\"Don't tell me that Younger Brother has really gone to look for Sima You Yue to make trouble?\" Nalan Lan mumbled to herself.In the morning, Nalan QI had come over to tell her that Sima You Yue had returned home yesterday and would head to school today. He had planned to bring a few people with him to kill him on his way back.She had not agreed in the beginning. However, Nalan Qi had persisted and brought his bodyguard with him in the end and left.Ever since Nalan Qi had left, she felt her heart grow restless, worried that something would happen to him. However, thinking about how Sima You Yue was just a waste, given the strength of Nalan Qi and the bodyguard, getting rid of him would only be a minor inconvenience. Thinking about things in this way, she managed to calm her heart.\"Sima You Yue, I have a bit of regret that I am unable to take your life with my own hands. However, to die in the hands of my brother is the same thing!\" Thinking about how she had been expelled from the academy, Nalan Lan's hands balled into fists.At the alley, Sima You Yue came beside Nalan Qi. Seeing how he had been charred by Sima You Yue's Spirit Flame to such a sorry state, his eyes were full of fear and shock. She gave a kick, saying, \"What are you so surprised for? Because I can cultivate? Or because you never thought that you would lose so quickly?\"Nalan Qi blinked his eyes, unable to say a single word.He never thought that not only would Sima You Yue be able to cultivate, but that he would also be so much stronger than himself. He did not know why but when Sima You Yue was using his Spirit energy, moon and stars did not appear to show his rank. However, he could feel that he was at least the rank of a Spirit Lord.Looking at the murderous intent in his eyes, his heart started to fill with regret. If he had not brought people along to kill Sima You Yue today, or if he had not overestimated himself and brought a few more people, he would not have met this end.\"I am someone who means what they say. Since I've said that I would take your life today, I can't let my words be empty.\" Sima You Yue took out the dagger than Ling Long had transformed into, saying, \"You were cruel in this life, but it was a pity that your strength was insufficient. I pray that you will not meet me in your next life.\"After saying this, she stabbed the dagger right into Nalan Qi's heart, thoroughly ending his life.In order to avoid the trouble that would come when others found Nalan Qi's corpse, she placed the bodies of Nalan Qi and his bodyguard into the Spirit Pearl and let Little Spirit take care of it.When Little Spirit saw the corpses that Sima You Yue threw in, he clapped his little hands. The two bodies turned into dust and dispersed into the air.After this matter was settled, she walked out slowly from the alley and headed to school.Two people appeared in the alley later on. Looking at the bloodstains left on the ground, they looked at each other as their eyes flashed with unconcealed traces of shock.\"Fifth Young Master has actually killed off the opponent in such a short period of time. Looks like his strength isn't low at all! I will continue tailing Fifth Young Master, you should return to the General's residence first to report what happened.\"\"Okay\u2026\"After their conversation, the two of them split up and left.Sima You Yue arrived at school. Even before she reached the dorm, she saw a person waiting at a quiet roadside.Chapter 69: Exterminating Nalan QiCan\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Especially since it was relatively early in the morning, there was n.o.body on the road. It was completely unexpected for Feng Zhi Xing to be waiting here for her.\"Waiting for you.\" Feng Zhi Xing looked at Sima You Yue as he said indifferently.\"Is there anything wrong?\" Sima You Yue saw how calm Feng Zhi Xing was and so her disturbed and violent heart also gradually calmed down.\"Ouyang Fei came to find me yesterday to tell me that you all will be leaving the school today.\" Feng Zhi Xing said.Sima You Yue didn't think that they would be leaving so quickly but she thought of how she had already held them back by quite a few days so Ouyang Fei and the rest must definitely be anxious.\"Yeah, they said that they wanted to leave a little earlier.\" She nodded her head.\"Their mission this time is the most difficult one. It also has the highest degree of danger, you have to take care of yourself.\" Feng Zhi Xing said.\"I will. Many thanks for your concern. If there is nothing else, I will take my leave first since they are still waiting for me.\" Sima You Yue scratched her cheek as she smiled and explained.\"Go then.\" Feng Zhi Xing waved his hands. Upon seeing Sima You Yue leave, he mumbled, \"She has the smell of blood, what has this girl done this time?\"\"Master, are you able to rest a.s.sured, letting her do her mission together with those people?\" A voice sounded in the distance.\"What is there to be a.s.sured or not about, if she wants to go then let her go. Experience is very good for increasing one's strength.\" Feng Zhi Xing said as he unhurriedly left the little road.When Sima You Yue returned to the living quarters, the other four had already been prepared and were just waiting for her.\"Zi Qi, didn't you say that we would be waiting for two days? How come we're in such a rush?\" She pulled Wei Zi Qi to ask as she saw the four of them who were ready and waiting for her.Wei Zi Qi looked helplessly at Ouyang Fei and said, \"I initially thought that in light of his injury, we would let him rest for two days to tend to his wounds. However, he's the one who insisted so we couldn't say much. Have you packed your things?\"\"I have everything I need on me!\" Sima You Yue waved her interspatial ring as she gleefully said.\"Then let's move out.\" Wei Zi Qi clapped Sima You Yue on the back as he turned to the three of them to say.The pressure surrounding Ouyang Fei's body was as low as it was yesterday. Hearing what Wei Zi Qi said, he wordlessly walked out of the courtyard.\"Let's go.\" Bei Gong Tang said indifferently as she also walked out.The three of them, Sima You Yue, Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi shrugged their shoulders before following after them.\"Oh right, Zi Qi, you all still haven't told me what our mission is about!\" After following them to the Spirit Master Guild, Sima You Yue finally realised that she had been so busy cultivating and practicing alchemy that she had totally forgotten to ask about anything regarding this mission.Wei Zi Qi slapped himself on the forehead before saying in vexation, \"I can't believe I'd forgotten to explain the mission to you. Our mission this time is to harvest a few pill ingredients.\"\"Pill ingredients?\" Sima You Yue was shocked. Couldn't they just buy the needed pill ingredient from the pill store, why did they have to go and look for it.\"Actually, looking for this pill ingredient is just the cover up for our mission.\" Fatty Qu explained, \"While under pretense of looking for whatever pill ingredients, these are only found in the Pu Luo Mountain Range. The main thing the Academy wishes for us is to develop our skills and increase our experiences.\"When she heard about the Pu Luo Mountain Range, Sima You Yue felt a bit of regret. She had only returned back for a few months but she had to go back there again.\"Let's go then, we have to go through a Teleportation Array to send us to a capital near Pu Luo Mountain Range.\" When it was their turn, he paid the fees for the five of them and told the servant girl the name of a certain city.\"Salt City, five people.\" That servant girl said as she received five wooden signs and gave it to Wei Zi Qi, who handed it out to everyone.Sima You Yue looked at the wooden sign in her hand and thought about how this place had no need for her to fill up any form. It could be because the amount people who pa.s.sed through this place was really too much, so filling up forms was too much trouble.\"Salt City is a place that Ouyang Fei and I decided on.\" Wei Zi Qi walked as he explained to Sima You Yue, \"We've did our research and found that the North of Pu Luo Mountain Range has a little less Spirit Beasts so we have decided to head there. Salt City happens to be the biggest city in the North.\"Arriving at the house that the Teleportation Array was in, Bei Gong Tang gave her wooden sign to a person standing at the side before standing inside the Teleportation Array and looking at Sima You Yue and the other three.Thinking of the last time, where she had fallen into a heap like a dog eating s.h.i.t the last time she used the Teleportation Array, Sima You Yue's eyes flashed when she saw the Teleportation Array again..After waiting for the five of them to enter the array, the Teleportation Array began to activate and they quickly disappeared from the house.Not long after they left, two other groups of people also arrived at the Spirit Master Guild. Looking at the clothes they were wearing, they must also have been students from the Imperial Academy.\"Salt City.\" One of the people holding the wooden plates took it out and said one word to the person-in-charge before standing inside the Teleportation Array.\"Boss, you said that you really want to head to the Pu Luo Mountain Range from Salt City?\" The second one who arrived at the Teleportation Array asked.The one who was referred to as Boss glanced at the other one wordlessly. He shrugged his shoulders and stood to the side.When evening came, Sima You Yue and the others appeared at the Spirit Master Guild at Salt City.\"We'll go look for an inn first to rest for a night and listen to any news about the current situation at Pu Luo Mountain Range while we're at it, okay?\" Wei Zi Qi asked.\"Okay!\" Fatty Qu was the first to agree. Hanging around the Teleportation Array for such a long time caused his back to ache.\"I'm okay with anything.\" Sima You Yue replied.Bei Gong Tang and Ouyang Fei also nodded. The sky had gotten dark, so rashly heading to the Pu Luo Mountain Range would be a considerably dangerous thing.And so the five of them left the Spirit Master Guild after asking around for the position of the closest inn. They went to rent five rooms and ate their dinner before retiring to their own rooms to rest.Not long after they entered the inn, another group of people also entered.Sima You Yue returned to her room and was sprawled out on the bed.When dinner time came, she saw that the four of them had very solemn expressions and knew that they were nervous about entering the mountain tomorrow. However, since she had stayed at Pu Luo Mountain Range for such a long time, she had nothing to be nervous about.As a result, she simply washed her face and brushed her teeth before surrounding herself in her blanket to sleep.On the morning of the second day, the few of them came downstairs to eat breakfast together.\"I have already asked about Pu Luo Mountain Range's current situation from the innkeepers last night.\" Wei Zi Qi said as he ate his breakfast, \"The Pu Luo Mountain Range is divided into the outer area, the middle area and the inner area\u2026\"Sima You Yue already knew everything that Wei Zi Qi was talking about, however, seeing that he was saying it with such detail, she could tell that he really had the ability to source for information.\"As long as we don't go to the middle or inner areas, we won't be met with too much danger.\" Wei Zi Qi concluded.\"However, if the pill ingredient that we need to gather isn't in the outer areas then we have no choice but to enter the middle area to look for it.\" Fatty Qu said.\"The middle area is too dangerous. If it is possible to avoid it then we really should do our best not to go.\" Wei Zi Qi said, \"Let's go. This is my first time entering Pu Luo Mountain Range, I can't help but to really look forward to see what it's like.\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

On the way there, they saw that quite a few people also happened to go in the same direction as them.\"How come there are so many people heading there?\" Fatty Qu could not help but ask as he watched the people come and go.\"Some of these people are like us and have come to train, but most of them are mercenaries from various places.\" Sima You Yue had seen some mercenaries before and recognised their clothes.\"Mercenaries come to these kind of places?\" Fatty Qu observed that these people really looked like fiends who lived their lives on top of blades and weapons.\"Yes, a few mercenaries will accept a few kinds of missions. For example, the collection of pill ingredients or the magic crystal found in Spirit Beasts or other ingredients that can only be found on the mountain.\" Wei Zi Qi explained.\"So you're saying that they have also come to enter the mountain? I initially thought that the Pu Luo Mountain Range would be so dangerous that n.o.body would dare to enter!\" Fatty Qu exclaimed.\"This is really too different from what you imagined right?\" Sima You Yue clapped Fatty Qu on the back. Growing up in the capital city together, if she had not remained here for a period of time, she would have been as clueless as Fatty Qu.The group of them had been walking for almost half a day but when they finally reached Pu Luo Mountain Range, Fatty Qu complained that he could not walk any further. Sima You Yue examined those around her. Aside from herself, she saw that Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi were panting for breath. Ouyang Fei and Bei Gong Tang also appeared exhausted.She looked around her and said, \"It's getting dark, why don't we find a place to camp and rest for a night. We'll enter the mountain tomorrow.\"Fatty Qu planted his b.u.t.t on the ground the moment he heard what Sima You Yue had said. He saw how relaxed Sima You Yue was and said, \"You Yue, we're all dead tired, but how come you don't look tired at all?\"\"I constantly train my body so this kind of physical exertion doesn't really affect me.\" Sima You Yue shrugged as she said, \"You all should rest here, I'll go check out whether there's any wide plot of land.\"When she finished talking, she turned to leave and left the four of them behind to rest.After a period of time, Sima You Yue walked in a circle and returned. Seeing that Fatty Qu and the others had rested sufficiently, she said, \"I was just at a place that appeared more suitable for us to set up camp, shall we head there?\"\"Okay.\"Sima You Yue brought the others with her to the place that she was at earlier but she didn't expect that others had already set up their camp there first.Those who had camped there were a group of mercenaries. Seeing that Sima You Yue and the others had come over, a twenty to thirty year old youth smiled at them, \"You guys also set your sights on this place? This place is quite big; we've gathered in this area. If you all don't mind, you can set up camp in that other area.\"Sima You Yue looked at the others to ask what they thought about it.\"Let's just put up with it.\" Ouyang Fei said, \"In any case, it's just one night.\"Bei Gong Tang didn't say anything, she just took out her tent and prepared to pitch it.\"Ouyang Fei is right, it's just one night. Let's just put up with it.\" Wei Zi Qi said.Since everyone agreed, Sima You Yue and Fatty Qu also took out their own tents and set it up according to the innkeeper's instructions. After everything had been set up properly, she took out a large bed from her interspatial ring and put it in the middle of her tent.\"Wow, you even brought such a huge bed out with you?\" When Fatty Qu had finished setting up his own things, he saw her large bed and was shocked.Sima You Yue had been shocked by Fatty Qu's reaction and glared at him, saying, \"What's there to be surprised about? Didn't you guys do it too?\"Fatty Qu pursed his lips, saying, \"Where would we find the s.p.a.ce to put such a huge bed?!\"\"Huh?\" Sima You Yue didn't understand, could it be that their interspatial ring was very small?\"Our interspatial ring is about the size of a house. If put a bed that was as huge as your, we wouldn't need to bring anything else.\" Fatty Qu looked begrudgingly at Sima You Yue. How great it was to be a young master of the General's family, his interspatial ring must definitely be bigger than his own by a few times.\"Aren't interspatial rings the same size?\" Sima You Yue asked.Fatty Qu rolled his eyes at Sima You Yue, saying, \"How can interspatial rings be the same size?! Normal interspatial rings only one to two cubic metres. A ring like mine, that is around the size of a house is already considered to be really good.\"Listening to what Fatty Qu had said, Sima You Yue touched the interspatial ring in her hand. This was something that Sima Lie had given her once she was able to cultivate. He told her that it was something her father had left behind for her so she had always used it. Seeing that it was around the size of a luxurious villa, she did not dare to think about what rank her ring was that her father had left behind.\"Alright, stop complaining like an old woman.\" Sima You yeu said, \"If there's an opportunity, I'll give you a bigger one okay. Let's go take a look at how Ouyang and the rest are doing.\"When they went out, Wei Zi Qi, Bei Gong Tag and Ouyang Fei were already sitting down in the middle of camp talking to each other.The place that they had chosen was surrounded by tall trees with leaves that were lush and vast on the tops. The leaves at the bottom were fewer and appeared spa.r.s.e.Those few mercenaries had also finished setting up their camp and sat in twos and threes, eating dinner together.\"You Yue, you're done setting up?\" Wei Zi Qi waved at Sima You Yue.\"Yup.\" Sima You Yue sized up those mercenaries. The youth that had spoken to Sima You Yue earlier felt her gaze and raised his head to smile at her. After that, he turned around to talk to his own teammate.Sima You Yue and others were chatting when that youth stood up to come over. He cupped his hands in greeting, saying, \"I am Qing Wu Ya from the Green Ridge Mercenaries. Is it your first time coming to Pu Luo Mountain Range?\"\"It is. Does Master Qing need anything?\" Wei Zi Qi replied.\"Looks like I guessed correctly.\" Qing Wu Ya smiled as he said, \"I just saw that you all had set up camp for so long but had yet to begin eating dinner and wanted to warn you that because there are many trees here, the sky darkens relatively earlier. You can consider eating your dinner a bit earlier, in order to avoid the pitch black darkness.\"\"Many thanks for Master Qing's reminder.\" Wei Zi Qi smiled as he said.\"You're welcome. As mercenaries, we don't have much experience with formalities and if you all do not reject it, you can call me Big Brother Qing. 'Master Qing' sounds odd, I'm not too used to hearing that.\" Qing Wu Ya scratched the back of his head and said.\"Hehe, Big Brother Qing. If Big Brother Qing has time, why don't you sit with us and chat?\" Wei Zi Qi took out a seat from his interspatial ring as he said.Qing Wu Ya recognised immediately with a glance that Wei Zi Qi's interspatial ring was not a simple thing. It was definitely not something that just anyone could use. Since he had already taken a chair out, he smiled and replied, \"Okay then.\"\"Big Brother Qing, do you come to Pu Luo Mountain Range often?\" Wei Zi Qi asked.\"Yeah, Pu Luo Mountain Range can be said to be a frequent hangout of us mercenaries.\" Master Qing replied.\"So you all will definitely have a good grasp of this place? Could you tell us a bit about the circ.u.mstances about this place?\" Wei Zi Qi smiled as he asked.Sima You Yue looked at Wei Zi Qi. This guy had a bright countenance, his smile was warm and he really knew how to talk. He gave people a kind of gentle and cultured feeling, causing people to want to get close to him without even knowing it.This kind of desire for closeness was different from the closeness that came from the Spirit Pearl; this was attributed to his personal charm.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

This Pu Luo Mountain Range has some areas that are relatively more dangerous than others. I'll tell you what they are so you can avoid having to enter those places.\"\"You all can continue talking, I'll go and prepare food.\" SIma You Yue stood up and said.Qing Wu Ya was right, the day did get darker relatively earlier, so they had to eat their dinner earlier.Everyone knew that his taste was more refined. As long as he had time, he wouldn't eat rations. As a result, everyone felt blessed that they followed Sima You Yue.She came to a large open s.p.a.ce and took out everything she needed to cook. She had all kinds of pots, pans and ladles, causing the mercenaries from the Green Ridge Mercenary Group to stare blankly.\"Tsktsk, looks like you're someone from one of the large clans. You even brought these kind of things with you.\" A mercenary looked at Sima You Yue's cooking equipment and lamented.\"Of course. You just have to take a look at what these guys are wearing to know that they're definitely not average people.\"\"This interspatial ring is really huge!\"\"Enough, don't be jealous, let's drink.\"Sima You Yue did not care about the admiration that she had received, taking a few ingredients from her Spirit Pearl, focusing on her own task of cooking dinner.Qing Wu Ya had also been shocked at what Sima You Yue did. This was the first time that he seen someone actually bring cooking utensils with him.\"Big Brother Qing, don\u2019t be surprised. His palette is a bit more refined and doesn't like to eat rations.\" Wei Zi Qi explained, \"Just now you mentioned something about how there have been more people coming to Pu Luo Mountain range?\"Qing Wu Ya moved his gaze away from watching Sima You Yue's cooking equipment and nodded his head, saying, \"That's right, this is something I have noticed. We, from the Green Ridge Mercenaries can be seen as being deployed often in Yancheng. We often go in and out of Pu Luo Mountain Range, so we'll be able to detect even the smallest difference. Although there has always been quite a large number of people coming to this Pu Luo Mountain Range, within this half a month, the number of people inside has increased by quite a lot. Further, most of them are from the large clans.\"\"Oh? Why would there suddenly be such an increase in the number of people?\" Fatty Qu was curious and asked.\"In the beginning, we didn't know. But after awhile, we accidentally overheard a bunch of people say that it appeared that some treasured object had appeared or whatever strange pill ingredient matured. We're not too clear on what that that item actually is.\" Qing Wu Ya shrugged and said, \"Because it doesn't really have much to do with us so we didn't pay too much attention to it.\"\"Does Big Brother Qing not have any interest towards this thing?\" Fatty Qu asked.\"It has nothing to do with whether or not I am interested in it, but the fact that the item would either be found in the inner area or at least near the inner area. How would we dare to enter that place! So we just listen to hearsay.\" Qing Wu Ya explained. \"Brother Wei, you all better not be captivated by that treasured object. Although treasures are great, one's life is the most important that you can't do without.\"\"Hehe, we understand that logic.\" Wei Zi Qi smiled.The inner area, this was a place that Saint Ranked beasts lived in. Although the strength of the few of them could compare to others who were the same age, when compared to other, they weren't any kind of experts. They had no guts to go and pick a fight with those Saint Ranked beasts.Sima You Yue was listening to the information that Qing Wu Ya was giving them while she fried her vegetables. Hearing them talk about treasured items, her movements hesitated for a while.Treasures? Those were her favorite. If she had the chance, she would go alone to check it out.She quickly made a table full of food and the smell wafted through the forest, attracting the attention of quite a few people.\"Brother Sima's food smells really great.\" Qing Wu Ya smelled the fragrance and could not help but praise it.\"Haha, in order to thank Big Brother Qing to telling us all about the Pu Luo Mountain Range, since everyone has been chatting so happily, why don't we drink together?\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"This\u2026 wouldn't be too good, right?\" Qing Wu Ya was a bit embarra.s.sed.\"I've cooked a bit too much food, Big Brother Qing, you should eat with us.\" Sima You Yue smiled and invited.This Qing Wu Ya's character was not bad, the things that he had told them earlier were very useful to them. Inviting him to eat and drink with them was nothing much.\"Let's go, Big Brother Qing, You Yue's dishes are really delicious. If you wanted to eat these anywhere else, you wouldn't be able to. Come, let's drink a few rounds!\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"Since you've all said it that way, then I won't hold back and will impose.\" Qing Wu Ya smiled as he cupped his hands in thanks.He had quite a good impression of Wei Zi Qi and the others so although he could tell that their ident.i.ties were not ordinary, they didn't have the usual arrogance that accompanied those of large family clans.The dishes that Sima You Yue had made were naturally eaten well by the others and they drank well too. After eating, Qing Wu Ya even praised that this was the best meal he had ever eaten in his life.After eating dinner, the sky was more or less pitch dark. Qing Wu Ya also returned to his own area with his military team mates. Sima You Yue and Bei Gong Tang cleaned up together, bringing it to a brook nearby to wash it clean.\"We're going to enter the mountain range tomorrow so everyone should rest early, I'll keep watch tonight.\" Ouyang Fei waited for them to come back before saying.\"No need, you can go to sleep. Just let Little Roar take care of the night watch.\" Sima You Yue looked over at Little Roar, who was hugging a chicken drumstick, eating it right down to the bone.Ouyang Fei glanced at Little Roar and could tell that it was powerful. He also had no desire to fight over keeping watch so he nodded his head to everyone and returned to his tent.\"Goodnight everyone.\" Wei Zi Qi returned after saying.\"Goodnight.\"Sima You Yue returned to her own tent and crossed both legs on the bed. Little Roar hugged the chicken drumstick and flew in.\"Little Roar, keep watch tonight.\"\"No problem! You can rest a.s.sured!\" Little Roar bit a mouthful of drumstick while saying.Sima You Yue nodded. However, she did not fall asleep and she only closed her eyes. She injected all of her spiritual qi into her sea of consciousness. There, the Imperial Beast Art and the Secrets of Soul Refinement quietly floated in the the air.Her mental energy became reduced to a little person and flew in front of the Imperial Beast Art, stretching out a hand to pick it up.The Imperial Beast Art was not long winded, the important parts talked about how to tame Spirit beasts and even had a few different methods of forming contracts. Looking at what it wrote, Sima You Yue just realised that there were different methods of forming contracts and each had different results.Contracts were generally divided into Life Contract, Spirit Contract and Master-Servant contract.Life Contract, as the name implied, was interdependent on the life and death of both parties. If one side died, the other party would also follow him in death. This was the most common method of contracts. The contract between Sima You Yue and that nameless egg was a Life Contract.Spirit Contract was a kind of contract that formed a link between the spirits of two parties. With this contract, if one side died, as long as the Spirit was still around, the Spirit Beast would also not die. This was the contract she had with Little Roar.Master-Servant contract was that the Person was the master while the Spirit beast was the Servant. For this kind of contract, even if the Spirit Beast died, the Master would not die. At most, he would lose a bit of strength. This kind of contract was the kind of contract that the Spirit Beasts hated the most.Some Life contracts and Spirit Contracts could only contract one beast, so at that time, when that egg had felt the Spirit contract between Sima You Yue and Little roar much earlier, it settled for the next best thing, which was the Life Contract.People of this age only knew about Life contracts and Master-Servant contracts. It was rare for people to know about Spirit Contracts.Apart from that, contracts were also very much related to a person's mental power. The stronger one's mental power, the more contracts they would be able to form with Spirit Beasts. Most Spirit Masters could only contract one Spirit Beast and only those who were stronger were able to contract a second.People like Sima You Yue, who were able to contract three of them, if we were talking about her strength, she was the most powerful of the most powerful.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

She didn't know how they could have possibly gotten lost over time.The book ended with one sentence, that the rank of beasts that could be tamed were dependent on her mental power. The higher the rank of the Spirit Beast, the stronger one's mental power would have to be. This was a point similar to alchemy.\"Sigh, looks like I have to increase my mental strength first!\"Sima You Yue sighed. Initially, she thought that cultivating Spiritual Qi was the most important, who would have thought that the art of Beast Taming and cultivating Spiritual Qi were just as important as each other.She put down the Imperial Art of Beast Taming and came in front of the Secrets of Soul Cultivation and took down the book. The s.h.i.+ning light that had suffused the book dissipated, letting her see the entirety of the book.She gently flipped open to the first page. The first sentence on the front gave her heart a huge shock.\"The highest limit of Soul Cultivation allows a soul to remain even without a body.\" When Sima You Yue read this sentence, she thought of that transparent ethereal spirit, \"So he practiced this art, allowing his spirit to remain in this world? Looks like this Soul Cultivation is of standard.\"She continued reading and it wrote about some ranks of Soul Cultivation. It started out with Reveal, followed by Manifestation, then Refining Emptiness and, finally, Transcendence.Furthermore, the degree of Soul Cultivation that would be demonstrated was dependent on one's mental powers.Reveal was a range that any mental power would be able to reach and would allow one's perception to reach one kilometer.Manifestation allowed one's mental power to condense concretely outside of the body.Refining Emptiness allowed one's mental power to condense a second type of form.Transcendence allowed one's Soul to remain independently.Every single degree was separated from the other by a huge chasm. Crossing over each rank would reap huge rewards.After the section of ranks, they had methods of cultivating one's Soul. Sima You Yue read it for a bit and initially thought it was relatively easy. Only a few chants were used to cultivate the soul, after that were some methods of increasing one's mental power.\"Looks like this Soul Cultivation and Mental Power are closely related and I can't lack a bit of either. No wonder Mo Sha said that my Mental Powers would increase after practicing Soul Cultivation.\" After complaining for a while, she left her sea of consciousness and began to practice while following the steps listed on that book.Time flew while she was cultivating and by the time Sima You Yue had been awoken from her meditation, the sky was already bright.She never thought that she would unknowingly cultivate the entire night and was completely energised. She didn't have the lethargy that came with a sleepless night at all.\"Looks like I'll be practicing this at night whenever I have nothing to do.\" She got down from the bed and tidied her clothes before placing the things in her tent into her interspatial ring along with the tent.\"Brother Sima, you're awake as well.\" Qing Wu Ya saw that Sima You Yue was keeping his things and smiled as he waved.\"Good morning, Big Brother Qing!\" Sima YOu Yue smiled as she nodded to him. After that, she went to the small lake to wash up, coming back to take her cooking utensils to cook breakfast.As she was cooking breakfast, Bei Gong Tang and the rest also woke up successively, packing their own things before waiting to eat.\"Brother Wei, we will be entering the mountain as well. You definitely have to remember the things that I told you all yesterday. Definitely don't go to those dangerous places.\" Qing Wu Ya told Wei Zi Qi after his own team had finished packing their stuff.\"Big Brother Qing will be entering the mountain so early?\" Wei Zi Qi said when he saw that the team of mercenaries were already ready and waiting.\"Yep, the mission this time is relatively more difficult and time is more tight so we have a leave a bit earlier.\" Qing Wu Ya replied.\"I see. Then I hope Big Brother Qing will be able to finish the mission earlier.\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"Thanks, Brother Wei. Hope we meet again!\"\"Hope we meet again.\"Qing Wu Ya cupped his hands towards Sima You Yue and the rest before returning to his own team saying, \"Let's go.\"Fatty Qu watched as Qing Wu Ya and his team left, saying, \"These mercenaries from Green Ridge are really not bad.\"\"Not bad. Much better than those we've met before.\"\"Let's eat.\" Sima You Yue placed the food on the table and beckoned to everyone.Being different from the Green Ridge Mercenaries, they were not in a rush, so Sima You Yue and the gang ate their breakfast before heading into the mountains.This time, they had to harvest quite a few different types of pill ingredients and each person had to also bring back one Spirit Beast body. Their mission was already quite difficult.The mission of searching for Pill ingredients was much easier for Sima You Yue because she was well acquainted with pill ingredients and knew what kind of environment which pill ingredient would be growing in. As a result, the scope of her search was greatly reduced.After one day, they found their first pill ingredient.\"You Yue, I never thought that you would be so familiar with pill ingredients.\" Wei ZI Qi looked at the pill ingredient that was lying in the basket and sighed.\"That's right, You Yue. How come we never knew you were so familiar with pill ingredients?\" Fatty Qu said.\"It's not like you all are with me 24 hours a day, how would you know what I do or don't know?\" Sima You glanced at Fatty Qu, directly avoiding answering their question.\"Now that we've found Earth's Core Gra.s.s, we still have to look for Fire Flame Gra.s.s and four other types of pill ingredients.\" Ouyang Fei said.\"I know about Fire Flame Gra.s.s, it grows facing the sun. However, there will be powerful Spirit Beasts living near the Fire Flame Gra.s.s.\"\"Yep, I propose leaving the search for Fire Flame Gra.s.s to the end. We should look for the other types of pill ingredients first.\" Wei Zi Qi suggested.\"Agreed.\" Sima You Yue nodded, \"The Spirit Beasts on the periphery of the Pu Luo Mountain Range are not high in rank, if we meet them, we will be able to practice a bit of combat.\"\"Okay. Then let's continue to look.\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"Yup.\"Not long after they left the valley, another group of people arrived at the place they were at.\"Boss, that group of people don't follow any pattern when they walk. We have no way of encountering them!\" One of them said.\"Even if there's no way, we have to think of a way!\" The black clothed man said, \"She caused Nalan Lan to be expelled from school so we definitely have to avenge this on her behalf.\"\"Boss, we can't directly do something to her, so how should we go about it?\" Yet another person asked.The black clothed man thought about it for a while, saying, \"Didn't they say that they wanted to look for Spirit Beasts to practice some combat? We can help them look for partners to practice with. If they are killed by the Spirit Beasts on Pu Luo Mountain Range, the school cannot place their deaths on our heads.\"\"But boss, I heard that the ranks of these few people are quite high. Aside from Sima You Yue, that waste, the others are not weaker than us. How can we do that would cause them to\u2026 by those Spirit Beasts\u2026?\"\"Of course I have an idea for that. Do you guys know where we can find Spirit Beasts and flock together?\" The black clothed man said.\"Boss, I know! I heard a mercenary mention it just now.\"\"That's good, let's go, we will help them look for Spirit Beasts to practice combat\u2026\"Sima You Yue and her five man team searched the mountain for an entire day but they had no harvests at all. However, while searching, they had encountered a Spirit Beast of the sixth rank. They managed to settle it very quickly by working together, letting Sima You Yue keep it. As for why she was the one to keep it, the reason was because her interspatial ring was the largest.Just as they were resting, Sima You Yue suddenly felt a sense of danger and subconsciously stood up.\"You Yue, what's wrong?\" Fatty Qu asked when he saw Sima You Yue panic.\"I hear something!' Sima You Yue said.The others had yet to say anything when they heard the chaotic sound of footsteps. Following which, a pack of Fire Wolves appeared in front of them, running towards them with terrifying speed.\"So\u2026 so many Spirit Beasts.\" Fatty Qu could not help but gulp when he saw so many Fire Wolves.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Click on our to add to the queue!Chapter 74: Battling the Fire Wolves PackIt was not only Fatty Qu but also Bei Gong Tang and the gang who had been scared witless by the pack of beasts that were charging towards them.\"Help\u2026\"As the pack of beasts drew nearer, Sima You Yue and gang noticed a person running right at the front of the pack.\"Awooo\u2026\"The call of the wolf pack was filled with a ferocity that caused that person to break out into a cold sweat, however, seeing Sima You Yue and the gang in front of him, he grit his teeth and charged straight at them.When Sima You Yue saw that person run towards their direction, she immediately reacted and gave a yell as she started running. She pulled Bei Gong Tang, who was standing beside her and they ran towards the back.Hearing her yell, Wei Zi Qi and the rest came back to their senses and broke into a run without even being able to pack their things.\"Help\u2026 the friend in front, help me\u2026\" That person called out when he saw that Sima You Yue and the rest were running.\"d.a.m.n, save yourself!\" Sima You Yue scolded, pulling Bei Gong Tang as they increased their pace.However, the strength in the legs of these five people were limited. How were they to outrun the Fire Wolves? Seeing the Spirit Beasts draw closer along with that black clothed man, Fatty Qu complained, \"d.a.m.n it, how can this guy run so fast!\"The one was had been chased by those Fire Wolves caught up very quickly. Seeing the tiny wolf cub in his hands, Sima You Yue finally understood why this pack of wolves had chased them all over the mountain.\"You idiot, what are you holding the wolf cub for? Quickly give it back!\"It appeared as if the person only regained his senses when Sima You Yue said it as he lowered his head to look at the tiny wolf cub in his embrace. He threw the wolf cub to Fatty Qu who was beside him before running towards another direction.\"d.a.m.n it, is this jerk trying to kill someone!\" Fatty Qu subconsciously caught the wolf cub but by the time he understood what was happening, that person had already run off without a trace.Sima You Yue watched as that person ran so quickly that he completely disappeared from sight and her eyes flashed with suspicion.\"Fatty Qu, what are you still hugging that wolf cub for! Quickly throw it away!\" Wei Zi Qi yelled.Fatty Qu hurriedly threw the wolf cub, however, except for one or two who had went over to where the cub was, the rest of the pack still chased them relentlessly.\"I can't run anymore, looks like I can only battle it out with them!\" Ouyang Fei looked at the Wolf Pack that was still chasing them relentlessly, and took out his weapons, turning to face the Wolf Pack, ready to kill.The rest of them also understood that this Wolf Pack had already marked them. No matter how far they ran, they would not let them off. They had also run for such a long time, their physical stamina would not last. If they waited until it was all depleted, the Wolf Pack would be able to kill them all easily.Sima You Yue was not too worried about the Wolf Pack behind them. Either one of little Roar or Ya Guang's appearance would be able to scare them off, however, she had no plans to do so.\"Let's just do it!\" Wei Zi Qi also stopped running as he called out his own contracted Spirit Beast and was ready to fight the Fire Wolves.\"This Lord won't run anyway, d.a.m.n it!\" Fatty Q u also called out his own Spirit Beast and axe, hurling it at the Fire Wolves.Bei Gong Tang did not call out her own Spirit Beast. She only stopped running and only threw the condensed ball of Spiritual Qi in her hands towards the Fire Wolves.Sima You Yue surveyed the situation for a bit. Ouyang Fei's beast was just a ninth ranked Clouded Leopard. It appeared to be breaking into the ranks of a Saint Ranked Spirit Beast.Fatty Qu's beast was just a seventh ranked Charm Fox. That fox's build was much smaller that the Fire Wolves but it was not weaker in combat ability at all.The rank of Wei Zi Qi's Spirit Beast was not as high as Ouyang Fei's, however, it was a very rare Fire Lizard. With just one sweep of its tail, an entire bunch of Fire Wolves were sent flying.Sima You Yue took out her dagger, Ling Long, and leapt in front of a Fire Wolf. While it was pouncing over, she quickly stabbed the dagger straight into the s.p.a.ce in between it\u2019s eyebrows. She had already pulled the dagger out before it had any chance to react.Ouyang Fei and the others never expected that Sima You Yue would be able to kill a wolf so quickly and stared in shock.\"The s.p.a.ce between the eyebrows and three inches below their neck is the Flame Wolves' most vulnerable spot. It's the most efficient to target those two areas.\"\"How did you know?\" Although it was not the best time for it, Fatty Qu still asked.\"It was mentioned before during cla.s.s.\" Sima You Yue said.It was at this point that everyone realised they had the vague impression that the teacher had talked about this before when he was explaining about the Spirit Beasts in Pu Luo Mountain Range. However, everyone did not pay attention. If it wasn't for Sima You Yue pointing it out, they would never have remembered that they had a cla.s.s on it.\"You have to be quick or else you will be hurt by the pack of wolves.\" Ouyang Fei cautioned.\"Ouyang Fei and Bei Gong Tang have quite a bit of battle experience, the three of us will take charge of attacking those closest to us. Zi Qi and Fatty Qu, you two will have to focus on using Spiritual Qi to attack.\" Sima You Yue said, \"We function as a team now, if we want to live through this, we have to work together to the best of our ability.\"Everyone looked at the Wolf Pack encircling them and nodded, showing their acceptance of what she said.\"Zi Qi, Fatty Qu, we will be outside and you two will be in the centre. Pump out Spiritual Qi as fast as you can. If any of us are taken down, it is possible that you two will be in danger.\" Ouyang Fei warned.\"You all can relax.\" Fatty Qu a.s.sured.Sima You Yue glanced at Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi, and said very earnestly, \"In the past, I rarely showed my back to others because it was a very dangerous thing. Today, the three of us entrust our backs to you, you guys have to defend it well!\"When Wei Zi Qi and the other four heard what Sima You Yue said, their hearts could now help but to be shaken. He was right. In the past, they kept to themselves even if they were in their own families. They never trusted anyone to the point that they could present their backs to them. However, today, they were presenting their backs to others because they had no choice, because they trusted each other.\"You Yue, you all can rest a.s.sured. We are a team and we will always be companions that you can trust your backs to!\" Wei Zi Qi responded with his heartfelt words.\"Thats right, we will always be companions you can trust your backs to!\" Fatty Qu confirmed.Sima You Yue smiled lightly, saying, \"That's good. Let's begin the battle!\"Bei Gong Tang and Ouyang Fei exchanged glances, with large amounts of battle intent apparent in their gazes, as well as feelings that birthed only out of teammates who suffered together.\"Charge!\"Ouyang Fei was still the first one to charge right in front of the Wolf Pack, with Sima You Yue and Bei Gong Tang close behind him. The three of them, with three Spirit Beasts unknowingly formed a circle with Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi wrapped in the centre, giving them enough time to condense their Spiritual Qi.As Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi condensed their b.a.l.l.s of Spiritual Qi, they would throw it towards the direction of whoever was in the most danger or whoever was the most taxed. There were some times where they threw the b.a.l.l.s of Spiritual Qi into the centre of the Wolf Pack, causing them to howl with pain.After half an hour, because there were too many injuries and deaths, the leader of the Fire Wolves had no choice by to resignedly take its underlings and run away with their tails between their legs.Only when the Wolf Pack left did everyone collapse to the ground with cuts of various sizes still dripping blood. The fight just now had depleted their energy. After Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi had depleted all their Spiritual Qi, they also chose to fight directly with the Wolf Pack.Sima You Yue took out a medicine bottle and poured out a pill and ate it. After that, she pa.s.sed the jade bottle to Bei Gong Tang, who poured out four pills and handed it out to everyone.\"We have to leave this place now. The activity just now and the smell of blood will definitely attract other Spirit Beasts.\" Looking at how everyone was utterly exhausted, Sima You Yue kept the carcases of all the Fire Wolves into her interspatial ring.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

He ran towards another mountain top, quickly linking up with his other teammates.\"Huang Si, how was it?\" The people who were waiting there asked when they saw their own teammate come back.\"By the time I ran off, Sima You Yue and the others had already been encircled by the pack of Fire Wolves.\" Huang Si tore off a piece of talisman that was pasted on his body and handed it over to the black clothed man, saying, \"Boss, what is this thing? After pasting it on, my speed increased by many times, as if this pair of legs weren't mine.\"\"You don't have to ask what it is.\" The black clothed man kept the talisman, saying, \"That Fire Wolf Pack really surrounded them completely?\"\"Really, boss!\" Huang Si guaranteed, \"It was even thirty to forty Fire Wolves! Even if that group of them wasn't weak, they wouldn\u2019t be able to match up to that many Fire Wolves.\"\"That would be good if it really happened.\" That black clothed man said, \"Sigh, even though they lost their lives, being unable to kill that waste with my own hands really fills me with regret!\"\"Boss, do we need to go and check out how they died?\" Huang Si asked.\"No need.\" The black clothed man shook his head, saying, \"If we happen to encounter that Wolf Pack, we will end up in a lot of trouble. Furthermore, the scent of blood would easily attract other Spirit Beasts nearby. Since we know that it was impossible for them to have survived, we have no need to place ourselves in danger.\"\"Boss is right.\"\"We have also come here to fulfill a mission. Since we've settled Sima You Yue, we should go and fulfill our own mission! Let's go.\" The black clothed man led his own team towards another mountain top when he finished speaking.On the other side, Ouyang Fei and the others kept their contracted Spirit Beasts into their interspatial rings, working together to leave the forest that they had just battled in.After moving for quite a while, they arrived at a river side. Looking at the empty s.p.a.ce beside the river, Sima You Yue said, \"This place should be far enough from the battleground earlier, we should stay here and wash our wounds.\"\"Okay.\" Wei Zi Qi supported Fatty Qu as he sat down on a large rock by the riverbed and he sat down on the side.Although they had already eaten the medicine that Sima You Yue had given them, a healing pill of the first rank would take effect slowly and the effects were not that great either. It was not possible for their wounds to close up after such a short period of time.Ouyang Fei came to the riverside and immediately took off his outer garment and began to wash the wounds on the upper half of his body. Sima You Yue glanced at him and realised his body had actually been marred by a criss cross of scars.Sima You Yue took out a basin and went to the side of the river to fill it up with water. She walked over to Fatty Qu and stretched out a hand to strip him of his clothes.\"Ahh- You Yue, what do you want to do?!\" Fatty Qu saw that Sima You Yue was stripping him and unconsciously shrieked as he used both hands to cover his chest.Sima You Yue's face was completely black, what did this guy react so exaggeratedly for?!\"If you feel that it's not painful for you to continue pulling on your wounds, I don't mind if you continue to hug yourself like that.\" As she said this, she glanced over at the wounds on Fatty Qu's body.It was only after he heard what Sima You Yue said that he recalled the wounds on his body. His actions just now caused his wounds to hurt even more, causing him to cry out in pain because he couldn't take it any longer.Sima You Yue pulled down his hands and used a pair of scissors to shred the clothed on his body, revealing the wounds on his shoulder and back.Of course, that pair of scissors was something that Ling Long had changed into extremely reluctantly. She really could not understand. Why was her master so insistent on her changing into a weird and crazy object that didn't have any use?For the sake of convenience, Sima You Yue completely cut apart Fatty Qu's clothes before taking out a piece of cotton cloth, wetting it with the water in the basin. After she had completely washed away the bloodstains around his wound, she took out a bottle of powdered medicine and sprinkled it evenly across his wound. She finally used a strip of cloth to wrap him up.Wei Zi Qi came back from the riverside after was.h.i.+ng the bloodstains off his body. When he say Sima You Yue's skilled actions, he teased, \"I didn't expect that You Yue would be so skilled at wrapping up wounds.\"\"I used to injure myself a lot in the past.\" Sima You Yue replied.The past that she spoke of was of the time when she always got injured when she was an a.s.sa.s.sin, but Fatty Qu and the other understood it as a past where he had always been beaten up by the people by Murong An's side.\"You Yue, don't worry, if anyone dares to beat you up in the future, this fatty will be the first one to defend you!\" Fatty Qu said as he looked at the strip of cloth on his arm.Sima You Yue smiled and walked behind him. She sprinkled some medicinal powder on the wound on his back before carefully wrapping it up.\"Done.\" Sima You Yue bound it well and said, \"This medicinal powder is very useful for treating wounds. When paired with pills, the effects are very good. Ouyang Fei, you all have many wounds on your body, I'll also help you wrap them up.\"\"I can do it myself.\" Ouyang Fei was not too used to others working on his own body and took the pill bottle to wrap his own wounds. However, because he had some wounds on his shoulders, he had no choice by to let him help.After Sima You Yue had finished helping Wei Zi Qi and Bei Gong Tang to wrap the wounds on their bodies, Fatty Qu thought of something before staring at Sima You Yue strangely.\"What's up with you? Why are you looking at me like that?\" Sima You Yue felt a bit scared under Fatty Qu's gaze.\"You Yue, we're all injured but you're perfectly fine.\" Fatty Qu said.After he said this, Wei Zi Qi, Bei Gong Tang and Ouyang Fei also realised it. They had all sustained injuries, but Sima You Yue did not have a single scratch!\"Cough cough, this\u2026\" Sima You Yue did not know how to answer and pretended to cough twice.\"Haha, we were even so worried earlier that bringing you to the mountain would be too dangerous for you. It turned out that you're someone who hides things deeply!\" Wei Zi Qi suddenly said with a big laugh.\"Hehe\u2026\" Sima You Yue touched her nose and smiled.\"You're very strong.\" Ouyang Fei said as he looked at Sima You Yue.When they were fighting, he had realised that Sima You Yue was extremely accurate each time he killed the Fire Wolves. Although he was had understood the weak points of those Fire Wolves, this was something that could only be exploited by his own strength.\"I feel that there's something fishy towards what just happened to us.\" Bei Gong Tang said.\"You realised it too?\" Ouyang Fei looked at Bei Gong Tang. It seemed that he was not the only one who thought something was off.\"What's fishy about it?\" Fatty Qu looked at the few of them with confusion.\"Everything about it is fishy.\" Wei Zi QI said.\"Huh? What is?\"Sima You Yue looked at how baffled Fatty Qu was and said, \"Don't you think the appearance of that person was very strange?\"\"What's so strange about that person?\" Fatty Qu asked.Sima You Yue looked at him with a contemptuous expression, this guy still didn't understand even though she had explained it like this!\"Fatty, that person today\u2026 it looks like his strength should more or less be on par with ours. It is even possible that it hasn't reached our level, so why would he come to Pu Luo Mountain Range, that is filled with so much danger? What about his companions?\" Wei Zi Qi explained patiently.Fatty Qu blinked and said, \"Hearing your explanation, it really does seem weird.\"\"This is not the only thing weird about it!\" Sima You Yue smiled lightly as her eyes flashed with a cold light.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

There's so much disparity between his speed before and after he met us. Don't you think that's strange?\" Sima You Yue said, \"Looking at his earlier actions, doesn't it seem like he deliberately drew the Wolf Pack to our location?\"\"You, you're saying that the person intentionally drew the Wolf Pack to our location? That person wanted to hurt us?\" Fatty Qu shouted out with surprise.Sima You Yue gave him an appraising look.\"d.a.m.n, who's that person? Why would he want to hurt us?\" Fatty Qu cried out.\"No matter who it is, we will find out eventually. There's no point guessing blindly right now.\" Ouyang Fei said.\"Right, there's no point thinking about it now. Since he's still within the mountain, we might be able to run into him.\" Wei Zi Qi said, \"Everyone's tired out today; we're injured too. I think we should just set up camp and rest.\"\"Okay.\"The five-man team rested for a day and during this period, many people pa.s.sed by their camp.\"You Yue, look, yet another large group of children from the large clans.\" Fatty Qu sat beside Sima You Yue and said as he watched another group of people walk by.Sima You Yue watched as that arrogant group of people walked past and she didn't have any good impression of them.\"However, speaking of which, Zi Qi is also someone from a large family clan. How come he doesn't walk around with his nose in the air like those people do?\" Fatty Qu puzzled.\"Aren't you the same?\" Wei Zi Qi laughed.\"How can my clan even compare to your Wei Clan.\" Fatty Qu shook his head, \"Hey, now that we're on this topic, we still don't know about Ouyang and Bei Gong's Clans.\"Seems like it.\" Wei Zi Qi nodded his head in agreement.When they first started to get to know each other, Ouyang Fei and Bei Gong Tang didn't really talk about themselves. However, at that time, they weren't close yet so they didn't pry much. After that, even after they had gotten close, they had forgotten to ask.Ouyang Fei shrugged, \"I don't have any relatives, I'm an orphan.\"He said it very casually, but Sima You Yue could feel a hint of resentment within his tone.\"I only have a mother and a younger brother, however, they are in a place very far away.\" Bei Gong Tang said this with a distant look in her eyes as she looked towards the sky. She gave off an aura of hurt and resentment.Sima You Yue looked at the two of them, whose eyes looked like they were holding something back. It looks like these two had stories that they did not want anyone to know about!Wei Zi Qi patted Ouyang Fei's shoulder, saying, \"It's okay, we'll be your family in the future.\"\"That's right, we're all housemates and we're also a team. In the future, we will be your family.\" Fatty Qu echoed.Ouyang Fei turned his head and saw the sincerity in Wei Zi Qi and Fatty Qu's eyes, his biting cold eyes filling with warmth.\"Okay, we will be brothers from now on!\"\"Right, brothers!\" Fatty Qu stood up to walk beside Ouyang Fei to take a said, as they gave each other a high five.The camaraderie between these men had initially already been unadulterated. All it needed was recognition for them to become brothers.Sima You Yue beamed towards the three of them, saying, \"Hey hey hey, count me in!\"\"Haha, how could we leave you out!\" Fatty Qu grinned as he said.Bei Gong Tang watched the few of them laughing and joking with each other as loneliness flashed in her eyes. As if she could not bear to watch this jovial scene in front of her eyes, she stood up to leave.\"What's up with Bei Gong?\"Everyone looked at each other with dismay, their eyes suffused with confusion.\"I'll go take a look at her.\" Sima You Yue stood up and walked towards the direction that Bei Gong Tang had left in.Bei Gong Tang came to the little river bank and watched the river blankly. Hearing something behind her, she turned her head and saw Sima You Yue. She asked, \"What are you doing here?\"\"I'm the one who should be asking you, why did you run out on your own?\" Sima You Yue walked beside Bei Gong Tang as she casually kicked a stone into the river, causing ripples on the water surface.\"I have something to do somewhere.\" Bei Gong Tang shook her head.\"You're intentionally distancing yourself from everyone.\" Sima You Yue said.Bei Gong Tang looked blank and retorted, \"I'm not.\"\"You are.\" Sima You Yue looked at Bei Gong Tang, \"We've already known each other for a few months and you're always neither here nor there with everyone. You left just now because you saw the way Ouyang Fei and Wei Zi Qi were behaving, right?\"Bei Gong Tang didn't reply, she merely watched the river.\"You're worried, aren't you?\" Sima You Yue continued, \"Worried about your mother and younger brother.\"Hearing what Sima You Yue had said, the aura exuding from Bei Gong Tang immediately changed. She watched him guardedly, asking coldly, \"Who are you?\"However, Sima You Yue was not scared by her reaction, laughing, \"You don't have to be so anxious. I don't know where you family is and don't know what you have experienced. I am even more uncertain why you are so sensitive. I merely noticed that your eyes reflected some traces of worry.\"\"Really?\"Sima You Yue shrugged, \"I can pretty much be considered as someone who is very well known. Although my reputation can't be said to be too great, whatever I've done has never been any kind of secret.\"Bei Gong Tang stared at Sima You Yue for quite a long time. After that, she appeared to have thought of something as she turned around to face the river. Although she didn't say anything, she no longer exuded the cold aura like before.When Sima You Yue saw her acting this way, she knew that Bei Gong Tang was no longer as guarded against her. The corner of her mouth pulled up as she said, \"Although I also used to be a lone wolf, I realised recently that it's not bad to have others with you. No matter what your past was like, if you encounter anything else in the future, during this period, we are all a team. Don't forget, we are comrades who have gone through battles together. Right now, we are people who can entrust our backs to one another. If you ever need someone to confide in, we are always here.\"\"Mm.\" Bei Gong Tang nodded, indicating that she understood.\"Alright then, let's go back. When they saw that you left without a word, they were all worried about you.\" Sima You Yue said as she patted Bei Gong Tang on the shoulder.When they returned back to the campsite, Wei Zi Qi and the rest were able to heave a sigh of relief before they started to banter together.Although Bei Gong Tang was the same as before, not really joining the conversation, however she would still have some replies to the things they said.Sima You Yue watched this group of people and realised that the battle this time had caused their relations.h.i.+p to become more intimate. If one saw this as a team in the past, everyone who now be regarded as a group of comrades that have fought alongside each other.When night came, everyone returned back to their own tents to rest. Bei Gong Tang lay on her own bed to take a nap when her eyes suddenly flew open, filling with unrestrained delight.\"Are you awake, Meng Ji?\"\"Master, the wounds I sustained last time were too serious, I've only regained consciousness for a while.\" A female voice resonated within Bei Gong Tang's consciousness.\"Meng Ji, it was all because you helped me to escape that you would be wounded to this point. It's already been so many years but you still need to remain unconscious to heal your wounds.\" Bei Gong Tang blamed herself.\"Master, you do not need to blame yourself. Protecting you is something that I should do.\" Meng Ji said.\"Master, this time, I will not be able to stay awake for long so I will just straightforwardly tell you my reason for waking up. I feel that there is a kind of pill ingredient on this mountain that is about to mature. If I am able to eat it, I will be able to completely recover.

What kind of scent? How come I didn't smell anything?\" Sima You Yue used all her effort to sniff around, but she didn't pick up on any particular scent.\"It's really far from here, how would the current you be able to smell it.\" Mo Sha said with a hint of disdain..\"What could it be, that it would actually be able to draw you out.\" Sima You Yue asked curiously.\"Golden Snake Fruit.\"Huh?!Once she heard about the Golden Snake Fruit, Sima You Yue's brain immediately thought of a fruit similar to the red apple from her previous life on earth. However, she knew what it would definitely not be something ordinary like that.She had seen it once in a medical book the last time she was inside the Spirit Pearl; the Golden Snake fruit was a kind of golden colored fruit. It flowered for seven hundred years, bore fruit for seven hundred years, another seven hundred years to ripen. Each time, it would produce seven fruits.The fruit could directly be used to increase one's cultivation rank, however, one could only eat a piece around the size of a fingernail at each time. If not, the energy would acc.u.mulate beyond what the body could stand and it would easily result in one's meridians exploding.If one refined it into a pill, they would not end up with this kind of outcome, however, this kind of pills would cost at least thousands upon thousands of gold for a single pill. When compared to the pills that cost only a few tens of gold per piece, it was more than a few hundred times more precious.Not only would this fruit be able to increase one's cultivation rank, its branch, leaves and roots were all precious. As a result, once the Golden Snake Fruit was noticed, everyone would fall over themselves to rush to the fruit.However, this Golden Snake Fruit was not easy to obtain. It goes without saying that there would be many Spirit Beasts guarding it, but once that fruit ripened, its fragrance would spread for thousands of miles, attracting all the Spirit Beasts nearby. This was because the fruit was not only useful for people, it could also be used by Spirit Beasts to increase their rank.\"I never expected that this Golden Snake Fruit would be so attractive that even you would be moved by it.\" Sima You Yue teased.\"A precious treasure of Heaven and Earth is definitely not easy to encounter.\" Mo Sha did not deny it at all, \"Furthermore, this item also benefits you.\"\"What benefits does it have? Will it increase my cultivation capacity?\" Once she heard that it brought some benefits to her, Sima You Yue's enthusiasm surfaced again.Mo Sha shook his head, \"Some people only know that it will be able to increase their cultivation, however, very few people know that it something that can nourish and repair one's spirit. Your soul had once received a great deal of damage, which would have very large impacts on your future cultivation and alchemy. If you were able to obtain the Golden Snake Fruit to warm and nourish you, it would definitely be extremely useful for the recovery of your soul.\"\"Huh? It's also able to recover one's soul?\" Sima You Yue looked at Mo Sha with shock.\"That's right. This Golden Snake Fruit has absorbed the moonlight, and after that, when it's transforming the inside of your body, will give off a milky white gas. This kind of gas is extremely beneficial for a person's soul.\" Mo Sha explained, \"Even if your soul didn't receive any wounds, after being nourished by it for a long time, it would become much stronger.\"\"That's amazing! It really is a treasure! Hehe, I definitely have to obtain this item.\" Sima You Yue immediately sat up and saw that Mo Sha had turned his head around to look at her. She smiled and said, \"I know, you want to use this item to recover your soul, if not, there would be no reason for a guy like you, who never wakes up early in the morning, to come out and say all these things to me.\"\"I am able to sense that there is at least one Divine Ranked Spirit Beast within the vicinity of the Golden Snake Fruit.\" Mo Sha said, \"Furthermore, once that Golden Snake Fruit matures, it will draw large quant.i.ties of Spirit Beasts. Add that onto the people who will be drawn, it will definitely not be easy to seize.\"\"You will help me.\" Sima You Yue said with confidence.\"Oh? You are so confident of that.\" Mo Sha raised his eyebrows in question.\"Of course.\" Sima You Yue said self-a.s.suredly, \"If this item had nothing to do with you, you may not help out. However, it is unknown how for how many years your spirit has lingered outside your body and the wounds you sustained are no less than mine. Although the Spirit Pearl can nourish you, the process is not quick. If you were able to obtain the Golden Snake Fruit Tree, you would definitely recover at a quicker rate. And so, you definitely need to obtain this Golden Snake Fruit.\"\"I can't intervene rashly.\" Mo Sha said.\"I know, you just have to act when the time is right.\" Sima You Yue replied as she waved her hands.\"This Golden Snake fruit is very picky about its living environment. Who knows why it has grown for such a long time here in Yi Lin Continent, which is such a low leveled place.\" Mo Sha puzzled.\"Who knows, maybe it knows you and I need it, so it decided to grow.\" Sima You Yue joked.Mo Sha's mouth curved into a slight smirk when he heard what she said, and was too lazy to reply her. He closed his eyes for a while to perceive something, then opened them to say, \"The Golden Snake Fruit still needs twenty days to mature. You should go and check out the situation two days before that.\"\"I got it.\" Sima You Yue nodded in reply.When he saw this, Mo Sha turned back into a wisp of black smoke and returned to the Spirit Pearl.Sima You Yue lay on the bed once again and spoke to herself, \"twenty days\u2026 we already have enough Spirit Beast bodies so we're just left with having to find some pill ingredients. In half a month, we should be done with them as well. However, it's so dangerous in the inner regions, at that time, it would be best for me to go by myself in order to avoid putting the others in danger. But how would I get them to let me go? Forget it, I won't think about it. I'll settle it when the time comes.\"After thinking through it, Sima You Yue closed her eyes and recited the Secrets of Soul Refinement in her heart as she began to cultivate her soul.After a day and night of recuperation, added on to the use of pills, Fatty Qu and the rest had pretty much tended to their wounds. At the very least, they would have no problems hurrying on with their mission. Thinking about how they still had a few different kinds of ingredients to find, they packed their things and got on the road on the morning of the second day.In order to save time, Sima You Yue threw Little Roar out and let him look for a Spirit Beast who could talk, so they could ask it where the ingredients grew. After he told her, she brought everyone there to harvest it.As a result, they used a total of twelve days before they managed to finish harvesting all the pill ingredients they needed.Along the boundary of the middle and outer regions, Sima You Yue and the few of them kept the Fire Gra.s.s, that they had picked from the valley, into their interspatial rings.\"Hehe, I really never thought that this place would have so much Fire Gra.s.s.\" Fatty Qu laughed heartily, \"Bei Gong, didn't you say that there would be a lot of danger surround the Fire Gra.s.s, how come we haven't seen a single Spirit Beast?\"Bei Gong Tang was also a bit puzzled, saying, \"Normally, this place is where Spirit Beasts tend to gather, but how come there aren't any around?\"\"They should have been drawn towards the activity within the inner regions.\" Sima You Yue said, \"Haven't you guys realised that we rarely encounter Spirit Beasts recently. They say that when some treasure appears, it will cause a great commotion. I think that they have gone to join in the fun.\"\"So that's why.\" Fatty Qu pretended to nod his head earnestly.After they had finished harvesting the Fire Gra.s.s that had matured for a certain number of years, their mission this time was considered to have been completed. Wei Zi Qi looked at Sima You Yue's figure from behind. He initially thought that bringing him would be a burden, however, he never expected that once they arrived at this place, his contribution to everyone would be the greatest.\"Since our mission has been completed, when shall we return?\" Wei Zi Qi asked.Hearing what he said, Sima You Yue and Bei Gong Tang's bodies stiffened.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Looking at the way she was behaving, she should have some unavoidable reason.\"You're going to look for that treasure.\" Ouyang Fei said.\"Really?\" Fatty Qu looked at Beng Gong Tang and asked.Bei Gong Tang blanked out for a moment, she didn't expect that Ouyang Fei would immediately be able to guess it. She nodded, saying, \"Yes.\"\"Bei Bong, we only heard the people pa.s.sing by say it yesterday. That treasure is in the inner regions. Even without talking about how dangerous the inner region is, during this period of time, there have been so many experts coming in. It's not like you don\u2019t' know, but it's only possible to obtain that treasure if you have to strength.\" Wei Zi Qi said solemnly.\"I know.\" Bei Gong Tang said, \"But I really have to obtain that item.\"\"Why?\" Ouyang Fei asked.Bei Gong Tang remained silent for a moment, then said, \"I have my reasons. You all go back first, there's no need to wait for me.\"\"No way, if you don't tell us the reason why, there's no way we'll let you go!\" Wei Zi Qi said resolutely, \"We are comrades who have fought side by side, we won't leave you alone, neither will we let you take the risk alone!\"\"Thats right, Bei Gong, we wouldn't let you remain here by yourself.\" Fatty Qu agreed.Bei Gong Tang was stunned and opened her mouth, but she didn't say anything.Sima You Yue walked beside Bei Gong Tang, patted her shoulders and said, \"Could it be that your Contracted Spirit Beast is injured?\"\"How did you know?\" Bei Gong Tang was extremely shocked, how could Sima You Yue manage to guess her true intentions every single time?\"I guessed it.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Bei Gong, is this really the case?\" Fatty Qu asked.Bei Gong Tang nodded, saying, \"A few years ago, I encountered some danger and my Contracted Spirit Beast saved me. But she sustained grave injuries and has been in a deep slumber to recover her injuries the past few years. She told me a few days ago and if she was able to obtain this treasure, she would be able to awaken. I'm the reason why she had to enter a deep sleep. Now that I know that something can heal her wounds, I can't give it up.\"After she had finished speaking, everyone went silent. Sima You Yue placed her hand on her shoulder, saying, \"Actually, I also wanted to go and take a look at that treasure. Since this is the case, I can go with you.\"\"You also want to go?\" Wei Zi Qi and Fatty Qu shoulder out simultaneously. Even Ouyang Fei looked at these two disapprovingly.\"That's right.\" Sima You Yue nodded, \"I'll go with Bei Gong, the three of you can\u2026\"\"Don\u2019t' say that you want us to return first!\" Fatty Qu said, \"If you two insist on going then we will go with you!\"Wei Zi Qi contemplated for a moment and said, \"Although I don't know what that thing is, it's able to entice you two so much. However, if you really have to go, then count me in. Adding in one more person will also be adding on a strength.\"\"I won't leave alone either.\" Ouyang Fei said.\"You guys\u2026\" Bei Gong Tang looked over and Wei Zi Qi and the gang. When she saw Sima You Yue's smile, she felt a tingle on her nose and her heart also started to feel a kind of warmth that she had not experienced for a very, very long time.She had never considered herself close to them before, but they had actually treated her so kindly.\"Okay then, since everyone wants to go, at that point in time, that treasure won't be given to you alone.\" Sima You Yue saw that Bei Gong Tang was touched, and smiled as she said.\"What? You Yue, what do you mean?\" Fatty Qu asked.\"Since everyone has decided to go together, then I will explain the situation to everyone. After I have finished explaining, you all can decided whether or not you want to go.\" Sima You Yue said.\"You Yue, how do you know?\"\"Don't ask me how I know, just listen to what I have to say.\" Sima You Yue said, \"That treasure is something that is rarely ever seen in this world, the Golden Snake Fruit.\"\"What kind of treasure is the Golden Snake Fruit?\"Ouyang Fei and Bei Gong Tang's faces held unconcealed shock while Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi just looked confused.Although Bei Gong Tang knew that the treasure was definitely not ordinary, she never expected that it would actually be the Golden Snake Fruit. It was no wonder that Meng Ji would wake up just to tell her about it.\"The Golden Snake Fruit flowers for seven hundred years, bears fruit for seven hundred years, takes seven hundred years to mature, and bears seven fruits at once. Using the Golden Snake Fruit will allow one's cultivation to rise and it's even better to refine it into a pill. That's why man and beast will fall over themselves to get to that treasure.\" Sima You Yue explained.\"d.a.m.n, that's really powerful!\" Fatty Qu said in shock.\"That's why it would attract so many darlings!\" Sima You Yue said, \"However, at this point, I'm not talking about the value of the Golden Snake Fruit. You all also know that a priceless treasure will attract very powerful Spirit Beasts. That Golden Snake Fruit even has a Divine Beast guarding it.\"\"Divine Beast!\"The other four sucked in their breaths. That Divine Beast an unparalleled Spirit; placing it on the continent made it the top expert. They actually wanted to take those seven Golden Snake Fruits from that Spirit Beast's mouth? How difficult would that be?\"Not only that.\" Sima You Yue continued to explain, \"When this Golden Snake Fruit ripens, it will give off a fragrant scent that will attract all nearby Spirit Beasts. We've rarely encountered any powerful Spirit Beasts recently, and now that this Golden Snake Fruit is quickly going to mature, those few Spirit Beasts have all headed into the inner regions. That's why, apart from that Divine Bests, we will possible meet countless of other strong Spirit Beasts.\"\"Tss-\"Everyone had already been shocked speechless by what she just said.\"There's also\u2026\" When Sima You Yue saw how they reacted, she thought of wanting to tell them whether or not all she said was true.\"There's also, the experts that have been on this mountain in the recent month, right?\" Ouyang Fei said.Sima You Yue nodded. During the half of a month that they had spent on this mountain, they had met quite a bit of strong people entering the inner regions. This was something she didn't have to point out, everyone pretty much understood.\"Heavens, this situation is too scary, okay!\" Fatty Qu finally found his voice after a long time and lamented.\"That's why you all have to think this through clearly, do you want to go or not.\" Sima You Yue said, \"Bei Gong Tang and I have our own reasons why we have to go, but you all don't have to take the risk. After all, this thing is good but the dangers are just as great.\"After hearing what she said, Wei Zi Qi and the rest thought it over, then said seriously, \"Since it's so dangerous, if you go in by yourselves, wouldn't it be more dangerous? Let's go in and take a look together, if it's really impossible then you all better not force it either!\"\"I promised Young Master You Le that I would take good care of you. If you don't return, how could I?\" Fatty Qu said.\"I'm interested in that treasure.\" Ouyang Fei said.Bei Gong Tang sniffed, as if suppressing her emotions. She looked at them and said, \"No matter what the outcome is, this show of friends.h.i.+p, Bei Gong will never forget it!\"\"I always had the intention to go, you don't have to count me into that.\" Sima You Yue shrugged and said.Looking at his cheeky expression, Bei Gong Tang laughed for the first time.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

She always used to be as cold as ice but her smile this time was simply mesmerizing.\"Cough cough.\" Wei Zi Qi was the first to come back to his sense and he pretended to cough twice, saying, \"Where is that Golden Snake Fruit? How long do we have before it ripens? With so many people and Spirit Beasts setting their sights on it, should we come up with some kind of countermeasures?\"When Wei Zi Qi said this, everyone creased their eyebrows. Just thinking about the Spirit Beasts was enough to give them a headache. Adding on to it the Spirit Beasts that would be attracted from all over the Mountain Range as well as the people who had their sights set on it, without a plan, it would definitely be very difficult to succeed.\"There are still seven days before this Golden Snake Fruit ripens. Let's look for the place first before testing out the situation secretly. We'll think of a countermeasure after that.\" Sima You Yue said.\"But where is that Golden Snake fruit? Which direction should we head towards?\"\"I know the general direction. Head towards the inner region and that place will probably be very easy to find.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Since this is the case, let's go and find out what the current circ.u.mstances are.\" Ouyang Fei said.\"Wait.\" Sima You Yue called out to stop them. When she saw that they had turned around to look at her, she said, \"The bodies from the Fire Wolves from our previous encounter have been with me. I'll give them out to you all. When that time comes, if we get forced to split up, you all should take it to complete the mission.\"When she finished speaking, she took out all the Fire Wolf carca.s.ses from her interspatial ring. She gave a few to each person and they kept them within their own interspatial rings. After that, they moved out.Actually, Sima You Yue was also unsure of which way to go. However, with Mo Sha there to show the way, they just had to hurry along.After three days, they came to the inner region that contained the Golden Snake Fruit. Following the tracks that those people had left behind, they came to a mountain peak.That Golden Snake Fruit was in the middle of a steep cliff. It was about 100metres from the ground and people were crowding around all the other areas of the hillside. The valley had been occupied by countless numbers of Spirit Beasts.Sima You Yue waited until they had reached an empty s.p.a.ce and they looked at the forces all around, shocking them all.\"So many people and Spirit Beasts!\" Wei Zi Qi lamented.\"We want to capture the Golden Snake from so many people and Spirit Beasts\u2026\" Ouyang Fei did not complete his sentence but everyone knew what he meant. That was something that was completely impossible.\"No matter what, I won't give up easily.\" Bei Gong Tang said as she clenched her fists.\"Is that the Golden Snake Fruit?\" Fatty Qu pointed at the Golden Snake Fruit Tree in the centre of the overhanging cliff.\"With a high place like that, it wouldn't be easy for us to pluck off the Golden Snake Fruit even if there wasn't anybody else!\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"Although that cliff is tall, it's not standing straight. There's a little bit of slope under it.\" Sima You Yue observed the area.\"But most people won't be able to climb up. At the very least, we can't.\" Fatty Qu said.\"Right now we can only see whether or not we will be able to take action during the chaos that will ensue when the Golden Snake Fruit ripens.\" Ouyang Fei said, \"Bei Gong, if that's not possible, you\u2026\"\"I understand' Bei Gong Tang nodded. If they really were unable to come up with any plan, she would not force it. If she were to throw her life away because of it, it would really not be worth it. Furthermore, she still had many things that were waiting on her to do.\"I'm just afraid that it won't be easy to take advantage of the chaos!\" Sima You Yue touched her chin and pondered, \"Looks like we really have to come up with an strategy.\"\"You Yue, look, isn't that the General?\" Fatty Qu suddenly pointed to a tent as he said.Sima You Yue looked over and it really was that Sima Lie had brought along a few people from the General Residence to pitch camp on the slope opposite the Golden Snake Fruit.\"Why is Grandpa here?\" When she saw Sima Lie, who had come out from the tent to observe the situation, she immediately hid behind Fatty Qu's body. She spoke to the others, \"In any case, there are still four days before the Golden Snake Fruit matures so let's leave this place first.\"\"That's fine too. If we remain here, we might end up as the stepping stones of those powerful masters.\" Wei Zi Qi said.n.o.body knew why Sima You Yue did not want to go and look for Sima Lie, but they had no reason to stay in this area, so they nodded and left the area together.The five of them left the others and stealthily went down the mountain. They came to a mountain peak beside it before finding a place to rest.\"You Yue, why did you want to run when you saw the General and the others?\" Fatty Qu waited until they sat down before giving voice to the question in his heart.\"If Grandpa knew we were here, he would definitely call for men to bring us back immediately. At that time, how would we be able to fight for that Golden Snake Fruit.\" Sima You Yue said.\"We can carefully scout out the environment in the surrounding areas for the remaining period of three days.\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"That's fine as well. The attention of those Spirit Beasts will all be on that Golden Snake Fruit. The inner regions are relatively safer than usual.\" Bei Gong Tang said.\"Since this is the case, then let's\u2026\" Sima You Yue had yet to finish what she wanted to say before her expression suddenly changed, saying, \"you all wait here for me, I'll leave for awhile.\"\"You Yue, where do you want to go? Although the inner region can be said to be relatively safer, it's still very dangerous for a person to head out alone.\" Fatty Qu said.\"Did something happen?\" Wei Zi Qi asked.\"Little Roar just sent me a message. It appears that he has encountered some sort of trouble.\" Sima You Yue said anxiously.Although Little Roar always said that it was a Divine Beast from the ancient times, it had zero battle strength right now. If it ended up in a conflict with another party, the outcome of the battle would be uncertain.Furthermore, if it did not encounter any danger, it would not call her so anxiously. Thinking to this point, her heart burned with anxiousness and could not help but to head over immediately.\"We'll go with you!\" Bei Gong Tang said.Sima You Yue looked over at everyone and saw that they were determined not to lether venture out alone and nodded, saying, \"Ya Guang, bring us to look for Little Roar.\"Just as everyone was puzzling over who Ya Guang was, a majestic, awe-inspiring, Iron Claw Tiger appeared in front of everyone.\"Master, quickly get on.\" Ya Guang said. It also felt that Little Roar was in danger and immediately transformed its torso the moment it appeared.\"It, it can talk. It's another Saint ranked Beast?\" They looked at Ya Guang, then looked at Sima You Yue. Everyone was incomparably shocked as they never expected that, apart from Little Roar, she would actually have another Saint Ranked Beast!However, this was not the time to be in shock. Everyone quickly settled their emotions and followed her to climb on Ya Guang's body. Ya Guang simply said, \"Hold on tight\", before speeding along.He headed towards the direction from which he could feel Little Roar. After half an hour, they finally arrived at the place where Little Roar was, however, what they say was not the precursor to a Spirit Beast's Battle, but a small basket. Inside, Little Roar was lying on its stomach with a little bird, with a pair of eyes that appeared listless. It was pulling at his head and they could tell that something was wrong with one look.Ever since Little Roar had awakened, Sima You Yue had never seen it look so listless. Looking at the way it was now really gave her heartache.However, she was upset. Previously, she should not have followed what Little Roar had said and shouldn't have permitted it to wander around the mountain by itself. If not, it would not have been forced into this state by others.It appeared that it could feel that Sima You Yue had arrived as Little Roar, who was lying inside the basket, had its eyes suddenly flash and walked over to where they were hiding.Just as they were planning to go and rescue Little Roar, the two people who were sitting in the centre while drinking wine began to talk about Spirit Beasts that they had captured.Sima You Yue never thought that their trip would actually result in them b.u.mping into a huge plot!Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

We've already caught close to twenty?\" Full-beard said happily, \"This time, we'll strike it rich! HAHAHA!\"\"Boss, this idea of your is really great. Those people are going to seize the treasure but we're here capturing Spirit Beasts.\"\"Those Spirit Beasts have all been attracted by that treasure and those who pa.s.sed us have lost their battle strength because of the knockout drug that we scattered and were directly captured by us. If we sell those Spirit Beasts to those shopkeepers, we really will strike it rich this time!\"Those two people were happily trying to take the credit in front of their boss. That boss glared at them, saying, \"What do you mean sell them to those shopkeepers? Stupid, we will sell these to the Beast Tamer Master Guild!\"\"Ah? Beast Tamer Master Guild?\"\"Sigh, you two idiots! I have already agreed with Great Master Ge that we will sell these Spirit Beasts to him and the Beast Tamer Master Guild will let us tame five Spirit Beasts free of charge.\" Full-beard said.\"Really? Wah, taming five Spirit Beasts!\" The two of them cried out happily.\"Both of you, keep your voices down. If anyone finds out, watch out or I'll break your legs!\" Full-beard chastised.\"Hehe, as long as we have those tamed Spirit Beasts, they will be able to form a contract. It's unavoidable for them to be excited.\" A middle aged man dressed in green came out from the tent and said with a smile.\"Great Master Su, why did you come out?\" Full-beard looked at that green clothed man and asked.\"I came out to see those few Spirit Beasts that were caught just now.\" Great Master Su said.\"Those two were just caught.\" A man carried that basket that Little Roar and that little bird were in.Full-beard looked at Little Roar and Little Bird, creased his brows and said, \"Why would you only catch these kinds of Spirit Beasts this time? Are they even Spirit Beasts?!\"\"Boss Hao, don't be angry. Although we've never seen these two Spirit beasts before\u2026\" Great Master Su was speaking when he suddenly opened his eyes wide and was filled with pleasant surprise when he saw Little Bird and said, \"Is this the Four Winged Flying Bird?! It, It's really the Four Winged Flying Bird!\"Great Master Su walked beside the basket and looked excitedly at the listless bird inside. He wanted to stretch out his hand to touch it, but he was apparently filled with worry and eventually encircled the basket, waving and dancing with joy.\"Great Master Su, what kind of Spirit Beast is this Four Winged Flying Bird?\" Seeing Great Master Su acting this way, Boss Hao and the other members of the group were watching him with confusion.\"Hehe.\" Great Master Su said with false calm, \"This Four Winged Flying Bird is something that I have only seen in books. It's just another type of Spirit Beast. Eh, what is this Spirit Beast that looks like a Rabbit? How come even I can't recognise it?\"The few of them clearly did not believe what Great Master Su had said. He said that it was something that he had only seen in books, so how could it be just another type of Spirit Beast. However, since he had said it, they could not say anything else. However, this Boss Hao secretly thought that when the time came to sell it, this bird would definitely fetch a high price.\"Great Master Su, it looks like this is totally not a Spirit Beast, it's just a rabbit.\" A member of the team said.\"I also feel that it looks like a rabbit.\" A few others agreed.\"How could this just be a rabbit!\" Great Master Su shook its head, \"Being with the Four Winged Flying Bird means it's no ordinary Spirit Beast. However, it's currently camouflaged. Wait until I've seen it's body then perhaps I will be able to recognise it.\"At this time, another ten over people came over from the forest, they seemed to be laughing and talking on their way.\"Look Boss, we've caught another Spirit Beast!\" A male youth walked over while carrying a basket and the inside was a Saint Ranked Black Leopard Beast.\"Boss, the medicine you gave us is really good. This guy was extremely fierce just now. But I didn't expect that once it smelled that medicine, it changed into this appearance, allowing us to capture it.\"\"Haha, Great Master Su, it looks like our harvest this time is plentiful!\" Boss Hao laughed loudly.Seeing that they had caught yet another Spirit Beast, Great Master Su's face also broke out into a huge smile, saying again and again, \"Not bad, not bad.\"\"Boss, we b.u.mped into this little guy on the road.\" Those few men pushed a guy from the back. Sima You Yue and them saw that the person who had been kidnapped could be considered an acquaintance.\"Qing Wu Ya, what is he doing here?\" Fatty Qu asked.\"Hao You Cai, you actually didn't care about the agreement that humankind has, using medicine to hunt and kill Spirit Beasts in such great amounts!\" Qing Wu Ya glared at Hao You Cai and raged.\"Hey, isn't this the young commander of the Green Ridge Mercenaries. Aren't you completing some missions from Salt City? What did you run over to the inner regions for?\" Hao You Cai evidently knew who Qing Wu Ya was, furthermore, from the tone of his voice, the relations.h.i.+p between these two was definitely not a friendly one.\"Go and die, they actually dared to treat the Spirit Beasts in this way!\" When Wei Zi Qi heard what Qing Wu Ya said, he was so angry that he immediately wanted to lash out, however, he was pulled to a stop by Sima You Yue.\"They have too many men right now and we are also unable to call out our contracted Spirit Beasts right now. With just the few of us, how are we supposed to fight them? Furthermore, their strength definitely overpowers us!\"\"But\u2026\"\"Zi Qi, you shouldn't be anxious. Since You Yue has said it in this way, he definitely has a plan. Little Roar is still in their hands, you know.\" Fatty Qu comforted.\"Why are you so angry, Zi Qi?\" Ouyang Fei looked as Wei ZI Qi but he could not really understand.In the past, this guy was always steady and calm but he was actually hopping mad right now.\"That's right, Wei Zi Qi, why are you so upset?\" Sima You Yue didn't understand either.\"As a Beast Tamer Master, every Spirit Beast is our friend. People like them who are using the knockout medicine to catch Spirit Beasts are the enemy of every single Beast Tamer Master!\" Wei Zi Qi said.He had been imbued with a single teaching by his family ever since he was young. Spirit Beasts were friends; it was only those who could have chemistry with those Spirit Beasts that would be able to tame a high ranking Spirit Beast.Furthermore, Wei Zi Qi had always been around Spirit Beasts ever since he was young and had already gotten used to having them make up a large part of his life. Hearing now that these people had used these kind of methods to catch close to twenty Spirit Beasts really infuriated him to no end.\"You Yue, what should we do now?\" It was rare for Bei Gong Tang to take the initiative to ask a question. This showed that she had already become used to this team.Sima You Yue looked at Little Roar, who was lying in the basket and said, \"They have many people and we are currently no match for them. The most important thing now is to find out what kind of medicine they are using. Since it is a kind of medicine that is released into the air, it is likely that this medicine can directly be carried by the air. As long as we understand this knockout medicine, going according to the temperaments of these Spirit Beasts, these people would definitely not meet a good end.\"\"But we're so far from them and we also don't know what kind of medicine they're using, right?\" Fatty Qu asked.\"There is!\" Wei Zi Qi said, \"There's a kind of gra.s.s called bitter-sweet smelling gra.s.s. This kind of gra.s.s causes Spirit Beasts to become violent and increases their blood circulation. It can be said to be the antidote to all Knockout medicines. As long as we can find that bitter-sweet smelling gra.s.s, no matter what kind of Knockout medicine they're using, we'll be able to counter it.\"\"But where do we go to look for the Bitter-sweet smelling gra.s.s now?\" Ouyang Fei knitted his eyebrows together.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

At that time, the knockout drug will be remedied.\" Wei Zi Qi explained.\"Will this work?\" Fatty Qu asked.\"We'll know whether or not it works by testing it out.\" Sima You Yue lit the bitter-sweet smelling gra.s.s in her hands on fire.Although the bitter-sweet smelling gra.s.s had the word 'bitter' in its name, the gas that it produced actually carried an almost indiscernible smell. The smell extended out from her hands, stealthily drifting over to where the camp was.\"Boohoo\u2026\"When they smelled the fragrance, because those few spirit beasts who had just been caught were not under the effects of the knockout medicine for a long period of time, they were not deeply affected by it. When they smelled the fragrance of that bitter-sweet smelling gra.s.s, they began to exhibit some signs of aggression.\"What's wrong with this guy?\" When they saw the reactions of those spirit beasts, Hao You Cai remarked, \"Elder Mu, there shouldn't be any issues with the things you gave us, right?\"\"There won't be.\" Great teacher Mu ascertained, \"Didn't those previous beasts all turn out fine?\"He just said those words when two men dashed over anxiously towards the campsite, saying agitatedly, \"Boss, the Spirit Beasts inside appear not to be in good condition, it looks like the effect of the knockout medicine is beginning to wear off.\"\"How can this be?! The knockout medicine I have should last a month before wearing off.\" Great Teacher Mu said with confidence.\"Haha, it must be that you've done too many bad things that the knockout medicine no longer works!\" Qing Wu Ya laughed loudly.\"You're talking nonsense!\" Hao You Yue immediately threw a punch at Qing Wu Ya's face, directly sending him flying.\"This guy knows what we've done and will be a liability if we leave him on this earth.\" Great Teacher Mu looked icily at Qing Wu Ya.\"Great Teacher Mu is right, come, let's send the young commander on a journey.\" Hao You Cai said.\"Yes, Boss!\" Two of the men responded as they took out their double edged swords, preparing to kill Qing Wu Ya.\"Stop!\"The voice that resounded throughout the area caused the two men to pause, then they suddenly had the impression that a person flashed in front of them before they had been sent flying.Qing Wu Ya had initially closed his eyes and waited to die, regretting that he had come here all alone. However, the pain that he had expected did not come. After that, he heard the cry of the two men and opened his eyes to see a distinct silhouette standing in front of him.\"Little Sister Bei Gong?\" Qing Wu Ya said with disbelief.\"Big Brother Qing, are you okay?\" Sima You Yue and Ouyang Fei came out from their hiding place, looking at Qing Wu Ya and asked.Qing Wu Ya shook his head, saying, \"I'm fine. What are you guys doing here?\"\"We happened to pa.s.s by and saw that they were going to kill you.\" Sima You Yue said.They initially thought that these people were from some great clans since they had been sent flying at their hands, but they never expected that it would be three brats who still stank of their mother's milk.\"You three are so young, but you actually learnt how to be busybodies. So, if you lose your lives, you shouldn't blame anyone.\" Hao You Cai coldly said.Sima You Yue and the other three had b.u.mped into and ruined their plans, furthermore, they were acquainted with Qing Wu Ya, so they would definitely not allow them to leave this place.\"Another three have come to meet their deaths!\" Great Teacher Mu furrowed his eyebrows, saying, \"We can't let others find out about our plans. Since they are together, we should send them on the same journey.\"These heartless words were said, showing that these few lives were worth less than ants to them.\"You want to kill us, but that really depends on whether or not you all have the ability!\" Sima You Yue smiled and said.\"Haha, what kind of ability would we need to deal with the three of you?\" Hao You Yue guffawed loudly and said, \"Any two men of ours would be able to take care of you! Ah Cao, Ah Cai, two of you go.\"\"Yes, Boss.\" These two large people walked out from the group and smiled coldly towards Sima You Yue and the rest as they drew closer. \"Kids, if you want to blame anything, blame it on yourselves for being busybodies and for finding out about our plans. Throughout the times, dead men are the best at keeping their mouths shut.\"\"Ah Cao, why are you still speaking so much rubbish to them. Aren't you going to make a move!\" Hao You Cai urged.Sima You Yue and Ouyang Fei exchanged glances and watched Ah Cao and Ah Cai who were coming closer. The two of them took action at the same time, running towards them and sending them flying when they were off guard.Ouyang took a step back, not rus.h.i.+ng to meet the person that he had sent flying, shooting a glance at Sima You yue instead.He had always been training his own body, so his body could handle more than a double edged sword master. It wasn't a big deal to send a Spirit Master flying. What really surprised him was that Sima You Yue would actually be so strong that he could actually send an adult flying.It appears that it was not that his body was very agile; his strength was what shocked a person.\"d.a.m.n your mother!\"Ah Cao and Ah Cai felt it as they were sent flying by those two children and felt that they had lost face in front of their teammates. Especially since Great Teacher Mu was still standing there watching.However, they thought that it was because they were overconfident that allowed these two brats to take advantage of gaps in their defenses. So, the two of them crawled back up from the ground to charge towards Sima You yue and the rest.\"Run!\" Sima Youe Yue shouted loudly as she began to run away from the camp site.She had just finished speaking when she realised that Ouyang Fei was already one step ahead of her.\"d.a.m.n!\"Although this was something that they had discussed beforehand, she never expected that Ouyang Fei would move so quickly.The two of them had already fully explored the entire place. They had not run far, and instead, were just going around in circles around the campsite. Ah Cao and Ah Cai were panting heavily from chasing them but were completely unable to catch up.\"Quickly chase after them, we can't let them get away!\" Great Teacher Mu shouted.\"Quickly, quickly chase! If we let them get away, I'll definitely have your heads!\" Hao You Yue also threatened.As a result, a few more people joined the group to chase after them.Qing Wu Ya saw that everyone's attention had been drawn by Sima You Yue and the rest. However, if he wanted to escape, he would definitely be noticed.He walked beside Bei Gong Tang and whispered, \"Little Sister Bei Gong, in a moment, I will draw their attention, and you must take advantage of the situation to run away quickly.\"\"My mission is to protect you, not to run away!\" Bei Gong Tang cooly said, \"We just have to press on for a little longer and it will be fine.\"Qing Wu Ya saw that Bei Gong Tang appeared completely at ease and thought about how there were still two more people that were not present. He guessed that they had some kind of plan and no longer urged her to leave.A few more people started to chase them and although Sima You Yue and Ouyang Fei's abilities were not bad, it was hard for a pair of fists to fight against four, especially since their side had so many people. The two of them were eventually pressured to come together as those mercenaries formed a group, encircling the two of them in the centre.\"Brats, where can you can run to now?!\" Ah Cao never thought that they would actually spend so much time to surround these two people in the centre. These two people were just like mudfish, every time they were about to catch them they would always manage to escape.\"Run?\" Sima You Yue looked at the people who were encircling them and shook her head, saying, \"Right now, the ones who should run are not us, but you all.\"\"Haha, right now, you are about to go meet Yama the King of h.e.l.l, but you are actually still trying to scare us\u2026\"\"Roar-\"Ah Cai had not even finished speaking when a roar came from inside the tent.

Its call was too piercing, forcing the men to cover their ears.\"Master Mu, what's wrong with these Spirit Beasts\" The Mercenaries had been frightened by the current situation so Hao You Cai had come beside Master Mu to ask in a trembling voice.\"It looks like the Spirit Beasts are going to wake up!\"When Master Mu finished speaking, he walked towards the tent where the Spirit Beasts were kept. Even before he pulled open the door curtain, a h.o.a.rd of transformed Spirit Beasts ran out.\"Roar!\"The Spirit Beasts shouted as their recovered the strength in their bodies, as they crammed the entire camp, one by one.\"Outrageous humans, you actually dared to use this kind of despicable knockout medicine on us in this way? Accept your fates!\"The Saint Beast that had recovered its strength looked at the mercenaries as they charged towards the people in the group.Sima You Yue did not know when she arrived beside the basket that shut Little Roar inside but she threw it open and Little Roar immediately pounced on her.\"Boohoo, Yue Yue, I thought that I would never get to see you again!\"Little Roar wailed in Sima You Yue's embrace, however, she could not see even a single teardrop.\"Enough, stop pretending.\" Sima You Yue lifted Little Roar's neck, saying, \"Didn't you say that you were going to probe the situation? How did you end up getting caught in this place?\"\"Eh- um- oh no, my friend is going to go on a rampage, I have to and give it support!\" Little Roar's pupils spun. When he saw that the bird that was with him had recovered its strength, his body nimbly twisted and threw off Sima You Yue's strong grip and flew, landing on the back of that bird.\"Big Roc, you are a giant legendary bird, yet these few men dared to catch you! Let them have a taste of your power!\" Little Roar shouted as he sat on the body of the Four Winged Roc.The men from the group of mercenaries were all completely panic-stricken. All these Spirit Beasts were brought back by them when they were in a daze; under normal circ.u.mstances, even a few of them would be impossible to defeat. Now that there were so many, furthermore, each and every single one of these Spirit Beasts were glaring hatefully at them, they would most definitely get torn apart.Hao You Cai watched helplessly as the Spirit Beasts emerged on by one, transforming in front of their very eyes. With fear and trembling, they pulled on Great Master Su's clothes, saying, \"Great Master Su, didn't you say that this Knockout medicine would at least last one to two months, why is it that they're all waking up now?\"Great Master Su no longer had the awe-inspiring authority that he had just now. Looking at the three-metre long spirit beasts, he gulped. When he heard what Hao You Cai said, he replied, \"How would I know!\"\"Boss, this is definitely the work of those few brats!\" Ah Cai pointed to Sima You Yue and said when he called what he had said to him.\"Haha, you all guessed it right!\" Wei Zi Qi and the others came out from inside the tent, holding bitter-sweet smelling gra.s.s in his hands.\"Bitter-sweet smelling gra.s.s!\" Great Master Su recognised what Wei Zi Qi was holding in his hand at a glance, \"Bitter-sweet smelling gra.s.s is able to nullify all knockout medicines. No wonder our knockout drug would stop working!\"\"Humph! As a Beast Tamer Master from the Beast Tamer Master Guild, you actually would ignore the contract that humans have with the spirit beasts, using knockout medicine to kidnap these Spirit Beasts!\" Wei Zi Qi yelled.\"Since you know that I am someone from the Beast Tamer Master Guild, you should also know that I am doing things on behalf of the Beast Tamer Master Guild but you actually dared to cause trouble!\" Great Master Su heard what Wei Zi Qi had said and replied him while sizing him up. Listening carefully to what he said, it he was not an average person.\"Beast Tamer Master Guild? Who knows whether or not the Beast Tamer Master Guild would be willing to be your protective umbrella when they find out what kind of shady business you've been done! I'm afraid that Wei Heng won't let you all off!\" Wei Zi Qi smiled coldly.\"How are you, how do you know Wei Heng?\" When Great Master Mu heard the name Wei Heng, he started to feel guilty.There was n.o.body in the Beast Tamer Master Guild who did not know of the vice president of the Guild. However, he always stayed indoors without coming out, so rarely appeared outside and very few people knew him. Hearing Wei Zi Qi talk about Wei Heng at this moment revealed clearly that his ident.i.ty was definitely not simple!\"Wei Heng is my Great Uncle, I am a member of the Wei Clan!\" Wei Zi Qi said proudly.\"A member of Wei Clan!\" Great Master Su's eyes were open wide in shock. He had almost killed a member of the Wei Clan!\"Zi Qi, why are you wasting words on him. These Spirit Beasts are almost all completely recovered. If we don't leave this place, we'll also be implicated.\" Fatty Qu reminded him from the side.The Spirit Beasts who had just awakened from their stupor were extremely irritable. What they wanted most now, towards the humans who had plotted towards their capture, to let them feel their wrath! Now that they were able to see the humans who had hurt them, they were unable to hold back.\"Roar-\"The Spirit Beasts roared towards them before charging towards the mercenaries. Wei Zi Qi and the others had already left far away long ago, rus.h.i.+ng quickly to an ancient tree far away.\"You were already here but you didn't call out to us!\" Fatty Qu saw that Sima You Yue and the other four were already sitting down on the branches of the large tree and complained.\"We saw that you all were talking to them so happily that we didn't want to disturb you.\" Bei Gong Tang jested in a rare expression of humor.\"You all did it on purpose!\" Fatty Qu sat on the branches as he complained in a small voice.\"Those Spirit Beasts have all become so irritable, how come Little Roar is unaffected?\" Wei Zi Qi asked when he observed Little Roar, who was hopping and jumping while giving commands, on the back on that Four Winged Roc.Sima You Yue shrugged, saying, \"I don't know either. Whoa! Those Spirit Beasts are truly malicious!\"Everyone looked towards the direction that Sima You Yue was looking in and saw a Black Leopard just happen to split Ah Mo in half, filling the entire compound with blood.\"The bitter-sweet smelling gra.s.s by itself would already make the Spirit Beasts violent. Adding on to that the fact that they have enmity with them, having hatred in their hearts, it's natural that their hands would be so heavy!\" Ouyang Fe said with an unchanging face.Sima You Yue and Bei Gong Tang didn't have that much feelings towards the scene that was taking place. Those men had tried to kill them to silence them earlier, and even violated the contract, so it could be considered their own fault for having this kind of outcome.Fatty Qu and Wei Zi Qi had never seen such a bloodbath, so seeing that the whole ground was flowing with blood caused them to involuntarily turn their heads away.Although that group of mercenaries had about thirty over men, when compared to those twenty over Spirit Beasts, they paled in comparison in battle strength. Those few men had been wiped out by those Spirit Beasts very quickly.The Spirit Beasts who were relatively weaker would come and fight together after killing off the men.\"Little Roar!\" Sima You Yue suddenly shouted.Little Roar glanced at her then cleared his throat, suddenly lifting his head to roar.\"Roar-\"It was strange even as one said it, the Spirit Beasts, who had initially been incomparably rash and ready to battle, all completely quieted down, creeping on the ground, completely different from how it was just now.Sima You Yue jumped down from the branch and directly walked over to where Little Roar and the rest were, leaving behind the few of them who stared at her while completely stunned.\"Little Brother Sima You Yue, what Spirit Beast is that?\" Qing Wu Ya asked while staring blankly.\"We have never seen one that looks like it.\" Fatty Qu said.\"However, even if we saw one before, we wouldn't necessarily be able to recognise it. Being able to cause the other Spirit Beasts to acquiesce to it is not something that just any ordinary Spirit Beast can do.\" Wei Zi Qi shook his head while saying.\"In any case, it's a d.a.m.n awesome Spirit Beast!\" Fatty Qu said with pride, as if Little Roar was his own contracted Spirit Beast.\"Revolting!\" Ouyang Fei walked past Fatty Qu and could not help but roll his eyes at him.Sima You Yue came to the campsite from earlier, where the corpses were all strewn about on the ground. She looked at Little Roar's friend, the Four Winged Roc and realised that its eyes still contained the scarlet aftereffects.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Those Spirit Beasts left successively, leaving behind Four Winged Roc and himself.\"It doesn't want to return?\" Sima You Yue asked as she cast a glance at the Four Winged Roc.Little Roar climbed down from the Four Winged Roc's back and came to plop on her head, saying, \"Big Roc is my friend, he will accompany me everywhere, of course he won't leave!\"When Sima You Yue heard it, she immediately thought of that time where it had cheated Ya Guang into coming into a contract with her. Could it be that this Four Winged Roc would be tricked as well?When Little Roar felt that she was harboring some suspicions towards him, he protested in his heart, \"When did I deceive others? Ya Guang and Big Roc all voluntarily followed me, okay? Don't group me in with people like you who have a belly full of evil tricks!\"When she heard that Little Roar said in his heart that she had a belly full of evil tricks, Sima You Yue immediately threw Little Roar down from the top of her head. Before she had even had the chance to reprimand him, she saw that Four Winged Roc transformed itself and flew towards her. He landed on her shoulder as he closed his eyes, falling asleep.When she felt that the little bird was falling off her shoulder, Sima You Yue threw Little Roar away as she stretched forth her hands to catch the little bird.\"Yue Yue, you're so biased!\" Little Roar roared.Sima You Yue rolled her eyes at it before looking at the little bird in the palm of her hand, saying, \"How come it fainted?\"Wei Zi Qi walked over and said, \"It's possible that the knockout medicine from just now is the cause of this.\"Qing Wu Ya cupped his fists towards them saying, \"Qing Wu Ya thanks the few of you for your benevolence in rescuing me today, in the future, if you have anything that you need Wu Ya, please immediately ask, ten thousand deaths would not stop Wu Ya from coming to help!\"\"Big Brother Qing's words are too serious.\" Wei Zi Qi raised up his pair of hands, saying, \"However, why would Big Brother Qing still be here in the Pu Luo Mountain Range?\"\"I will tell you these things later, we should leave this place first.\" Qing Wu Ya said.Being an experienced mercenary, he had been to the Pu Luo Mountain range all year round and he knew that the smell of blood would definitely attract other Spirit Beasts.The five of them quickly left the camp as Qing Wa Ya explained what he was doing here while they travelled.It turns out that they had already completed the previous mission ten over days after entering the mountain. After that, their group received a second mission, which was to bring a group from a large family clan into the inner regions.The were unwilling at first. After all, the inner regions were really too dangerous. However, the men from that clan said that the Pu Luo Mountain range would be safe during this period of time because all the Spirit Beasts would have been attracted away. Added on to the fact that the remuneration was also generous, Qing Wu Ya's dad agreed but they would only bring the two of them whose strengths were greater. Furthermore, Qing Wu Ya appeared as if he really wanted to go and take a look at the inner regions.After he finished talking about himself, Qing Wu Ya said, \"Why are you all still here in the mountain? Furthermore, you are even in the inner regions. Even though it's relatively safer now, this may not always be the case.\"\"We're just here to partic.i.p.ate in the fun.\" Wei Zi Qi said, \"Just now, looking at the way Big Brother Qing was acting, it appears that you're acquainted with those mercenaries?\"\"Yeah, that's the group that always sets itself against the Green Ridge Mercenaries. They're called the Black Bear Mercenaries. Although their Boss, Hao You Cai, is pretty strong, his personality is bad. He always brings his group to steal other's business and he has done no small amount of bad things! I never expected that this time, it turns out that he was doing things on behalf of the Beast Tamer Master Guild\" Qing Wu Ya said.\"Are you acquainted with Master Mu?\" Wei Zi Qi asked.\"I know him. He's a Beast Master Tamer from Salt City's Beast Master Tamer Guild. I've heard that his personality is not that great either. However, he also wouldn't do this kind of things.\"\"I think he is not the kind of person who would do this kind of things. If he dared to do this kind of things, it means that the Mercenary guild has a great backer. Possibly, it could be that the Guild was the one who incited them to do this!\" Wei Zi Qi said, \"Once I go back, I will definitely tell these things to my Great Uncle.\"When Qing Wu Ya heard what Wei Zi Qi had said, he immediately knew what his ident.i.ty was. Initially, he merely guessed that he was not an ordinary person, but he never expected that he would actually belong to the aristocratic family of Beast Tamer Masters!They headed towards the mountain peak where the Golden Snake Fruit was and reached the campsite in a day. Qing Wu Ya invited them to go to the campside together, however, Sima You Yue politely turned him down. If they were together with others, it would be troublesome to act when the time came.Initially, Qing Wu Ya had been quite worried about them. However, since they did not agree, he didn't force them. He just told them to immediately look for him if they encountered any trouble.Sima You Yue and the others readily promised before Qing Wu Ya left.Seeing that the mountain valley had an influx of people and Spirit Beasts, Fatty Qu held on to Sima You Yue's shoulders and said, \"You Yue, a lot of people have come these two days.\"Seeing the mountain filled with people and Spirit Beasts, Sima You Yue and Bei Gong Tang's eyes were filled with a mysterious and imposing light.\"There's still a day and a night before the Golden Snake Fruit ripens. Let's first go and rest nearby.\" Sima You Yue suggested.The few of them found an area that was relatively more concealed, but where they were still able to observe the situation below.Because this s.p.a.ce was too small, although it was better at concealing them, n.o.body occupied this s.p.a.ce.While waiting for the Golden Snake Fruit to mature, Sima You Yue wanted to go to another place to keep away from Wei Zi Qi and the rest conveniently.She scanned her surroundings and saw that n.o.body was there so she called out LIttle Roar and stared at him as she asked, \"What's up with the Four Winged Roc?\"\"Talking about Little Roc?\" Little Roar shrunk his neck and replied, \"Because I saw that you wanted to seize the Golden Snake Fruit\u2026 this Little Roc can fly so when the time comes, he can fly us across!\"\"That's why you tricked him into coming?\" Sima You Yue said.\"Sigh, Yue Yue, this Spirit Beast is willing to follow you is a good thing, you know!\" Little Roar said.\"Of course I would also like to have more and more Spirit Beasts, but if you trick others, when the time comes that they recover their senses, what will you do when they come to settle the debt!\" Sima You Yue stretch forth a little finger to prod Little Roar's head, \"This Four Winged Roc's rank isn't low, right? When the time comes and it goes crazy, are you able to defeat it?\"\"With Big Brother Crimson Flame around, which Spirit Beasts dares to act rashly in front of you!\" Little Roar muttered softly.\"What did you say?\" Sima You Yue carried Little Roar as she asked.\"Nothing!\" Little Roar recalled that Crimson Flame had said not to talk about its situation and hurriedly denied it. He went back to the topic and said, \"In any case, Little Roc won't harm you, so you can rest a.s.sured!\"\"But right now, the number of contracts that I can have is maxed out, I can't form a contract with it.\" Sima You Yue said.\"No problem, just let it stay where Little Spirit is. When you are able to form a contract with him then do it!\" Little Roar said nonchalantly, \"Even though he's a Ninth Ranked Saint Beast, he carries the blood of the ancient Big Roc in its body. Once its bloodline awakes, he would be a decent Spirit Beast.\"When Sima You Yue heard what Little Roar had said, the corner of her mouth curved into a smile. What was a Ninth Ranked Saint Beast? It was a Spirit Beast that was only one step away from breaking into the Divine ranks, okay? It was equivalent to the existence of a Spirit Emperor. If Sima Lie wanted to fight it, the winner and loser would be unknown! How did Little Roar end up speaking of it as if it was some kind of cabbage?!Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

Don't you all have a saying that goes, a Big Roc spreads its wings over 90000 miles? Although this might sound exaggerated, however this speed is not something that ordinary Roc-type Saint Birds birds can match up to. Furthermore, its battle strength is steady! If Little Roc was able to awaken his bloodline, he would be considered a decent helper!\"Sima You Yue looked at the little bird in her hand and found it hard to imagine that that guy would actually be a Spirit Beast that had the bloodline of the ancient Saint Beast.\"Let me also tell you that although Little Roc might not look like much, but together with my Discerning Eyes, even if his bloodline does not awaken, once he grows up, he will be the King of the Four Winged Rocs. To the best of my knowledge, it has been a long time since the King of the Four Wing Rocs appeared.\" Little Roar said mysteriously.Hearing that this little bird, that had slept for n entire day and night, actually had this kind of ident.i.ty, Sima You Yue's heart was even more confused, how did Little Roar actually manage to con this Spirit Beast over?\"Why is he still asleep?\"\"I think that it's the effects of the knockout medicine from the previous time.\"Sima You Yue thought about Four Winged Roc's scarlet eyes that she had seen the last time. Perhaps it really had something to do with it.\"Then if he continues sleeping like this, when the Golden Snake Fruit ripens, it won't be able to help with anything.\" Sima You Yue said helplessly.\"This\u2026 Ha, he's woken up!\" Little Roar said happily.Four Winged Roc was a helping hand that he had specially brought over. If it continued to sleep wouldn't he have looked for it for nothing? As a result, he was ecstatic when he felt the Four Winged Roc wake up.Four Winged Roc's tightly shut eyes began to openly slowly. When he saw everyone, his hazy eyes immediately sharpened as the feathers on his back all stood on edge. It was only when he recognised Sima You Yue that his body began to relax.\"You've woken up?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"Thank you for saving us.\" Four Winged Roc said as he flapped his wings.\"I just happened to, in pa.s.sing.\" Sima You Yue said, \"How are you now?\"\"I'm fine.\" Four Winged Roc said, \"Do you want to form a contract with me now?\"\"Huh?\" Sima You Yue was stunned as she did not think that Four Winged Roc would be so direct. She shook her head, saying, \"I'm unable to form a contract with you now. I'm already reached my limit on the number of Spirit Beasts I can contract, and am unable to contract more Spirit Beasts right now.\"\"Oh.\" Four Winged Roc nodded his head calmly, saying, \"Little Roar said that you have an area in which you can cultivate in. He said that if you can't form a contract with me, I can go in there to cultivate and once you are able to form a contract, then form a contract with me.\"\"Eh-\" Sima You Yue looked at Four Winged Roc, \"You really are willing to follow me?\"\"Yes.\" Four Winged Roc nodded.\"Why?\" Sima You Yue didn't understand.\"Little Roar's bloodline is superior to mine and he says that there is a future to follow you. I believe his words.\" Four Winged Roc said seriously.Sima You Yue was inexplicably shocked by his reply. It turns out that this guy didn't follow her because of her, but because of Little Roar.With a single thought, Little Roar and Four Winged Roc were thrown into the Spirit Pearl.Looking at this kind of partner caused her eyes to hurt. What the eyes didn't see, the heart wouldn't agonise over.The scene in front of Four Winged Roc changed in a moment and it shocked him.\"This is Yue Yue's territory, you can randomly choose an area to go and cultivate.\" Little roar said smugly.Little Spirit emerged from thin air as he looked at Four Winged Roc and said, \"This is my world, and it is also Master's area. Since you have entered, in the future you will be Master's contracted Spirit Beast. Yes, even though you haven't entered a contract. Little Roar, Master said to ask you to bring Little Roc for a stroll around here and to take care of him.After he finished speaking, he disappeared, leaving behind Four Winged Roc who was still stunned.Little Roar flew over, saying, \"How is it? I didn't lie to you, right?\"Little Roc nodded his head fervently, saying, \"This is really too magical! There actually exists a place like this that has Spiritual Qi so many times denser than outside!\"\"Alright, I'll bring you for a tour now. There are some areas that you can't enter without permission, or else Yue Yue will get upset.\" When Little Roar finished speaking, he brought Little Roc for a tour around the Spirit Pearl.Sima You Yue slowly walked over to where Wei Zi Qi and the others were. Because the area was too small, they had no way of setting up their tents. The four of them directly sat on top of a large boulder to chat.\"You Yue you were actually gone for so long, could it be that you've taken a nice dump such that your stomach is all empty now?\" Fatty Qu laughed as he teased.Sima You Yue smiled and didn't answer him.Everyone realised that the Little Bird that was initially in his embrace was gone and thought that he had left after he had woken up.Sima You Yue walked over and sat beside them. This boulder was really decent. It was just big enough to accommodate the five of them.Furthermore, they just had to stick their necks out a bit to be able to see the situation that was happening below.\"There's still a day left before the Golden Snake Fruit ripens. Right now, there's even more Spirit Beasts below. Today, more than a few higher ranked Spirit Beasts have come as well.\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"I have never ever seen this kind of display of forces. My heart is beating, going ba-thump ba-thump, you know!\" Fatty Qu said as he patted his chest with exaggeration.\"If your heart didn't beat then you'd be dead!\" Ouyang Fei said.\"Pfft-\"They never expected that Ouyang Fei would say this kind of things and everyone's spirits were lifted.\"Someone's coming!\" Bei Gong alerted them.Everyone quieted down. With a large shrub blocking them, the people who were walking outside didn't see them.\"Dad, I suspect that younger brother has really been killed by the people from the Sima Clan!\"Sima heard the person who was talking and didn't expect that it would be someone she recognised.Nalan He and Nalan Lan walked past the forest but they didn't realise the people behind the large shrub.\"Lan'er, Qi'er has only been gone for a short while. Why are you so sure that he's been killed by the people from the Sima Clan?\" Nalan He asked, \"Is there something you're hiding from me?\"Nalan Lan bit her lip as her eyes flashed with hints of a struggle. In the end, her feelings of worry took priority and she said, \"Dad, during the morning of the day he disappeared, he came to find me and told me that the trash of the Sima Family had returned home. He said that he would return to the academy in the morning and so he actually brought a few imperial bodyguards to settle the score with him and to get rid of him quietly. However, I never expected that he never returned and completely disappeared, not even leaving a corpse behind. You tell me, aside from getting killed by Sima You Yue, what other explanation could there be?\"\"Nonsense!\" Nalan He chastised \"You just got expelled from the academy, why did you go and pick another fight?!\"\"Dad, it wasn't me who asked younger brother to go. At that time, I also advised him but he wouldn't listen to me.\" Nalan lan said aggrievedly, \"Dad, this isn't important right now. Younger Brother has already been missing for more than a month, should we go and ask the Sima Clan.\"\"Humph. If the Sima Clan really dared to kill my son, the Nalan Clan would never be able to coexist with them!\" Nalan He ground his teeth as he said, \"Wait until we settle the issue with the Golden Snake Fruit then we'll go to the Sima Clan when we go back!\"When the two of them finished speaking, Sima You Yue's five man team all let out a long breath. Sima You Yue thought of how they had said they would go look for trouble at the Sima Clan and raised her head to find that everyone was looking at her.\"Tell us, was it you?\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

When they heard what Sima You Yue said, they all rolled their eyes.Wei Zi Qi and the others all gave Sima You Yue a look that showed they knew he was lying to himself and to others. If they didn't know what his true strength was, they would have believed him. However, after the whole episode at Pu Luo Mountain Range, they knew that he was definitely not weaker than them and was actually even stronger. This sentence could not even convince the person who said it, much less convince them!\"Regardless of whether or not you did it, hearing what Nalan Lan and the other one said, this time, they will go to your Sima Clan to look for trouble.\" Fatty Qu said a bit worriedly.He never used to care about whatever happened between the Sima Clan and the Nalan Clan, but now that he had taken Sima You Yue as a brother, he would naturally take his burdens upon his own shoulders.\"The Nalan Clan has always been nursing a grudge against you because of the previous time where you caused Nalan Lan to be expelled. I heard that they've been increasing pressure on your clan these few months. If not for the fact that General Sima had ties with the army, I think that they would have directly struck against you.\" Wei Zi Qi said, \"Although that Nalan Qi is a bit stupid and incompetent, he is the apple of Nalan He's eye. If he knew that he was killed by you, he would be even more heavy handed and intense.\"She didn't refute anything that Wei Zi Qi had said about her killing Nalan Qi and she had already thought about all his worries.\"Since he talked about his troubles about going to find Grandfather, then why don't we push the inconvenience of killing onto the source.\"Hearing that Sima You Yue spoke without any hesitation, their hearts were shocked.\"Tsktsk, and you just said that you were a pure and innocent person but now you say these kind of words so easily.\" Fatty Qu unveiled her mask.Sima You Yue rolled her eyes at him, saying, \"My purity and innocence depends on the receiving party. A dragon has reverse scales that will anger it if you touch it, everyone has their own areas you can't mess around with. If anyone dares to mess with my family, I, Sima You Yue, will definitely not let them off easily!\"The four of them were moved by what Sima You Yue said, a dragon has reverse scales that you can't touch, weren't they the same!\"Roar-\"An angry roar sounded from the mountain valley, scaring everyone on the mountain who was waiting for the Golden Snake Fruit to ripen.\"What happened?\"\"No idea, why would the Divine Beast suddenly rage?\"\"It seems like someone got close to the Golden Snake Fruit!\"\"It was a Spirit Beast, my goodness, it was a Ninth ranked Saint Beast!\"\"They're fighting!\"Sima You Yue and the others stood up and lay on the boulder, facing the mountain valley. They really did see two Spirit Beasts fighting and it ended up involving the other Spirit Beasts nearby, scaring them into retreating behind quite a bit.\"That Saint Beast is really powerful, it can actually battle a Divine Beast.\" Fatty Qu clicked his tongue in astonishment as he watched the battle down below.\"That's because it's bloodline is slightly higher than the Saint Beast's.\" Wei Zi Qi said, \"Spirit Beasts of a certain bloodline can eliminate the pressure that comes from some higher ranked. However, whether or not it will be able to attain victory will depend on their individual strengths.\"\"That Divine Beast is concealing its power, the Saint Beast is going to lose!\" Bei Gong Tang said.The others didn't know how Bei Gong Tang knew this, however, not long after she finished speaking, that Saint Beast lay beaten on the ground. Each breath it took was shallow, as were the breaths it released.\"That Full Ape has actually reached the level of Second Ranked Divine Beast!\"The people who were watching were completely shocked by the strength that the Spirit Beast had revealed and were at a loss.\"General, it's unexpected that the Full Ape would actually be a Divine Beast at second rank. Now the difficulty in seizing the Golden Snake Fruit will be increased many many, many times!\"Actually, a Rank One Divine Beast's strength was not that different from a Rank Two Spirit Emperor. Adding on to that the help of a few more men, it was still possible for Sima Lie to obtain that Golden Snake Fruit. However, now that this Full Ape increased its rank to a Second Ranked Divine Beast, it's battle strength was comparable to a Fourth Ranked Spirit Emperor and could be considered as being stronger than him by two ranks. Wanting to surpa.s.s it became completely uncertain in a short moment.\"Admittedly, this Golden Snake Fruit is really enticing, but this Full Ape actually secretly increased in rank. Pa.s.s down the command to play by ear and not to risk one's life to be stubborn.\" Sima Lie saw Nalan Clan's camp that was not too far away from his. Nalan He was over there having a discussion and he was also talking about what just happened.The boulder that Sima You Yue was hiding behind was not too far away from the Sima Clan's campsite. When she heard what Sima Lie said, her heart full of worry finally calmed down. She was afraid that SIma Lei would be muddle headed over this treasure and would stubbornly press on in fighting with the Full Ape for the Golden Snake Fruit. Now that she knew he did not think this way, she felt relieved.However, she never expected that their desire for the Golden Snake Fruit would be taken by others as people who did not know their own strength.Night gradually arrived and the moon this night was exceptionally bright. It was like a Jade Plate hanging up in the sky, like a silver blanket across the mountain valley.Perhaps it was because it could feel that the Golden Snake fruit was about to ripen. The Spirit Beasts as well as the people in the mountain valley did not rest. Everyone was anxiously paying attention to the situation regarding the Golden Snake Fruit.Sima You Yue anxiously stared at the Golden Snake Fruit Tree. Because she was slightly more informed about it than others, the parts that she were focusing on were slightly different.Most people only saw that the Golden Snake Fruit was absorbing the moonlight and that it had yet to turn completely golden as it slowly matured. However, her focus was on the Golden Snake Fruit tree.The Golden Snake Fruit Tree was giving off a faint white glow, spreading out like a thin silver thread. Under the mask of the moonlight, those who did not look carefully would not be able to notice it at all.\"Is that the gas that allows one's soul to recover?\" Sima You Yue saw the Full Ape sit beside the Golden Snake Fruit as it worked hard to breathe in the gas that was emitted by the Golden Snake Fruit. Looking at it, the fact that it was able to breakthrough to the Second Ranked Divine Beast rank was not unrelated to this gas.In the later half of the night, when everyone was a little bit sleepy, Mo Sha suddenly voice out, \"The Golden Snake Fruit is going to ripen!\"Sima You Yue had always been watching the Golden Snake Fruit Tree and realised by herself that there were some changes to the Golden Snake Fruit. Those seven fruits had already turned yellow and were giving off a rich fragrance, causing the Spirit Beasts onsite to go crazy.Those Spirit Beasts charged towards the overhanging cliff, wanting to take the fruit. However, they realised that it was wrapped in a burst of white light, barricading it from everyone's touch.\"Still missing the final part.\" Mo Sha said.\"The Golden Snake Fruit has matured, everyone quickly go take it!\" It was unknown who shouted this from the mountain as everyone's state of mind was immediately thrown into disarray in a moment. They completely disregarded the h.o.a.rd of Spirit Beasts, directly flying towards the Golden Snake Fruit.The Spirit Masters who reached the rank of Spirit King were able to fly in the air. It seemed that each and every single one of these were experts whose powers were ranked above Spirit King.Those Spirit Masters who had directly flown over to the overhanging cliff were swatted down by the strong gust of wind that came from a swat by the Full Ape, sending more than a few people flying. Those were fell on the ground were besieged by the Spirit Beasts from all sides.Beast and beast, man and man, everyone was fighting against everyone, turning the entire mountain valley into a scene of chaos.Sima You Yue saw that SIma Lie was also flying towards the Full Ape and took out a bottle of medicine powder and placed it in Bei Gong Tang's hand. She said, \"I'm going to s.n.a.t.c.h the Golden Snake Fruit. Help me to scatter this on the people from the Nalan Clan. If I'm able to s.n.a.t.c.h the Golden Snake Fruit, I will definitely give you a share!\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

If we all go down, I'm afraid that we'll add on to the number of people who'll end up in between the teeth of these Spirit Beasts.\" Sima You Yue said, \"I have an idea on how to secretly sneak in there, but I have no way of bringing you all along with me. Zi Qi, Ouyang, Fatty, the three of you have to be proper protectors of the flower. After you have scattered the medicinal powder onto the bodies of the people from the Nalan Clan, retreat immediately. We will meet in Salt City in two days.\"\"How can we let you go alone?!\" Bei Gong Tang didn't want to take the pill bottle.\"We haven't finished doing our things, I won't take my life as a joke.\" Sima You Yue stuffed the pill bottle into Bei Gong Tang's hand and said, \"Trust me, I will bring the Golden Snake Fruit back!\"After she finished speaking, she quickly flashed out from behind the shrub and dashed towards the bottom of the mountain.\"We should leave as well.\" Ouyang Fei said, \"He's not someone who only talks big. Since he said that he has a way, it must be the truth. If we go, we may only drag him down.\"Wei Zi Qi, Fatty Qu and the gang did not refute what Ouyang Fei said because it was the truth. They always felt that they were excellent amongst their peers and had never thought a day would come that they would drag someone else down.Bei Gong Tang watched as Sima You Yue dashed down the mountain, disappearing completely amongst the crowd of Spirit Beasts and could not help but feel worry in her heart.How long has it been since she felt worry for another person?She clutched the pill bottle tightly in her hand and forced down her worry, saying, \"You all wait for me here, I'll go and scatter this onto the bodies of the people from the Nalan Clan.\"After she said this, she was going to leave but she was pulled to a stop by Ouyang Fei.\"We'll go together.\"Bei Gong Tang saw the look of resolution in his gaze and nodded.\"We don't have to scatter this onto Nalan He's body. There will definitely still be people at the Nalan Clan's campsite, so we'll scatter this onto this inside of their tent before leaving.\" Wei Zi Qi said, \"It's too chaotic here now, the earlier we leave the better.\"\"Mm, let's go!\"\"Wait up.\" Fatty Qu pulled everyone to a stop as he took out four masks from his interspatial ring and handed it to everyone, saying \"In order to avoid revealing our ident.i.ties, it'll be better for us to put these on.\"Fatty, why would you have these masks?\" Wei Zi Qi asked.\"You Yue gave them to me.\" Fatty Qu put on the face mask as he took the initiative to walk out.Ouyang Fei and the three of them wordlessly put on the face mask. Was this something that Sima You Yue had prepared much earlier in order for him to do some misdeeds?\"Let us move out as well.\"The three of them put on the face masks as the followed Fatty Qu and walked towards the Nalan Clan's tent.Because they didn't know how many people still remained at the Nalan Clan's campsite, Bei Gong Tang and the others scattered the medicinal powder around the inside of the tent before leaving. They didn't see who was inside the tent at all.Nalan Lan was outside, looking at the situation outside and was so afraid that her face was paperwhite and she charged right back into the tent. Because she was still so traumatised, she didn't realised that there was an additional faint fragrance within the tent.After their plans had gone smoothly, Wei Zi Qi and the four of them began to run off in another direction on the mountain. They didn't run far when they saw Ya Guang in front waiting for them.\"Master told me to bring you all back.\" Ya Guang revealed himself as he told Wei Zi Qi and the others.The inner areas were currently chaotic. If they met any crazy Spirit Beasts, as a Saint Ranked beast, Ya Guang would be stronger than those beasts by quite a bit.Wei Zi Qi and the others did not refuse as they directly climbed onto Ya Guang's back, allowing him to carry them as he ran towards the outer regions.Bei Gong Tang sat right at the back and she turned her head around to look at the mountain valley that was illuminated by the battles taking place, looking slightly as if she was holding herself back.Sima You Yue took out and wore a face mask the moment she came out from behind the boulder and then ran towards the bottom of the mountain.During the moment in which she entered the h.o.a.rd of Spirit Beasts, the aura she released changed unexpectedly. It was as if her entire person\u2019s presence suddenly disappeared. Even if she walked past those people and Spirit Beasts, they didn't notice her. As a result, she quickly pa.s.sed by the h.o.a.rd of Spirit Beasts and came to the bottom of the overhanging cliff, flying towards the side of the Golden Snake Fruit in a single leap.\"Wow, I never thought that I would ever be able to experience the feeling of flying.\" Sima You Yue sighed to Mo Sha the moment she landed.Mo Sha didn't reply her, saying \"As you near the Golden Snake Fruit, the strength that I poured into your body will disappear. When that time comes, you can only depend on yourself to pick that Golden Snake Fruit. Furthermore, you have to be quick, or else, if the people or Spirit Beasts downstairs realise it, I don't have to tell you what the consequences will be.\"\"I understand.\" Sima You Yue nodded.There were so many powerful Spirit Beasts and experts down below. If they were to take any action against her once she dug out the Golden Snake Fruit tree, even if she didn't die, she would still walk around the gates of death.\"If you're prepared, I'll retract my strength.\" Once Mo Sha finished speaking, Sima You Yue felt the strength that was just poured into her own body disappeared, along with the lithe feeling.She took out the trowel that she usually used to dig out weeds within the Spirit Pearl as she squatted beside the Golden Snake Fruit and began to cautiously dig out the Golden Snake Fruit.This Golden Snake Fruit Tree was shorter than fifty over centimeters in height, but its roots were not small. In order to minimise the damage done to the Golden Snake Fruit tree, she tried hard to dig the roots out entirely. Just as she was going to complete it, an angry roar sounded from the air.\"Roar-\"The Full Ape that was battling Sima You Yue felt that someone was touching the Golden Snake Fruit, and although it was initially at an advantage and was relentlessly pursuing Sima Lie, it turned around and charged towards Sima You Yue at a high speed.Sima Lie had battled a few rounds with the Full Ape and was preparing to withdraw, however, the Full Ape did not give him any opportunity to escape. Seeing the Full Ape leave, Sima Lie seized the opportunity to fly to a neighboring mountain peak and came beside the Golden Snake Fruit Tree as he wanted to see what it was that actually avoided the detection of so many people and Spirit Beasts.Other people also noticed the situation that was occurring on the overhanging cliff and headed towards the Golden Snake Fruit tree one after the other. They saw someone wearing a face mask and a large mantle, squatting there digging up the Golden Snake Fruit.\"Who is that?\"n.o.body could think of anyone they had met these few days that looked like this person. Even upon close scrutiny, they could not figure out this person's ident.i.ty.Sima You Yue felt that the Full Ape was charging towards her but saw that a bit of roots still remained in the dirt. She hardened her heart and immediately pulled up the Golden Snake Fruit Tree and threw it into her Spirit Pearl.When the Golden Snake Fruit Tree disappeared, Mo Sha's power bubbled up in her body once again. Before she was prepared, the Full Ape had rushed over and she had no choice by to receive one of its blows.\"Pfff-\" Sima You Yue was sent flying by a single punch by the Full Ape and spat out a fresh spray of blood, eventually flipping her body and flying in the air.It was only at this time that everyone could see her figure clearly and saw that it was clearly slender and thin. However this was unable to conceal the aura that was emanating from her body.\"Spirit, Spirit Paragon?\" Sima Lie said uncertainly.\"Master, when did a Spirit Paragon appear on our Continent?\"\"It's not a real Spirit Paragon. Her aura is clearly superficial and it's obvious that its not her real strength.\"\"Daring Human, you actually dare to steal my Golden Snake Fruit!\" The Full Ape saw that even the Golden Snake Fruit Tree had been uprooted and was incomparably angry. Furthermore, she had not died even after receiving its punch, causing him to become even more furious. Its body suddenly rose up as it launched its large fist towards Sima You Yue once again.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

How come you can't even defeat this monkey now?\" Sima You Yue asked as she watched Mo Sha bring her into hiding.\"My soul is currently unsteady and I can't display my power.\" Mo Sha said, \"Furthermore, I was not ready to receive its punch just now. Meeting it head on injured me a bit.\"\"Alright then, since we can't defeat it, we should escape. We'd be in trouble if other people wanted to s.n.a.t.c.h it from me as well.\"After she finished speaking, Sima You Yue called Little Roc out from the Spirit Pearl. He directly appeared and she flipped her body and landed on his back.\"Little monkey, I won't play with you today!\" Sima You Yue towered above the Full Ape and looked down on it. She saw that it was violent, angry and filled with resentment, she suddenly felt some kind of reluctance. The treasure that it had protected a few thousand years ago was uprooted just like this; wasn't this going too far.Her mind speed up a few seconds as she took a Golden Snake Fruit and threw it to the Full Ape, saying, \"Little Monkey, you guarded it for such a long time, I'll give you a bit of the share.\"The Full Ape caught the Golden Snake Fruit that Sima You Yue had thrown over and confirmed it. It raised its head and saw that she had already left while sitting on Little Roc. It was a bit confused in its heart.It initially thought that it would never be able to retrieve the Golden Snake Fruit today. It never expected that this person would actually give it one and it was extremely unexpected.However, it just needed a single Golden Snake Fruit because it never thought of relying on this to increase its strength. It only wanted to stimulate and awaken its bloodline in its body. It was a good thing that this human did not s.n.a.t.c.h away the entirety of the Golden Snake Fruit, leaving it with some hope. Otherwise, even if it had to self-destruct, it would drag her down with it!Thinking up to this point, the pure heart of the Full Ape was filled with grat.i.tude towards Sima You Yue. If she found out about it, she would definitely scold it for being foolis.h.!.+The Full Ape ate the Golden Snake Fruit and flew towards another direction, leaving behind a mountain full of people and Spirit Beasts.Everyone had yet to react when both thieving parties of the Golden Snake Fruit left. The Mountain Valley no longer had the aura of the Golden Snake Fruit and those Spirit Beasts also slowly came back to their senses. A few of the higher rank ones took the initiative to leave first.\"Family leader, is the Golden Snake Fruit just gone like this?\" Nalan Family's guard came beside Nalan He. The both of them felt like they were in a dream. They were just battling others for the sake of the Golden Snake Fruit, but their eyes merely left it for a moment before it was gone.\"If not? Even if that person wasn't a spirit paraon, it would at least be the rank of a Spirit Emperor. How else would she be able to use a secret method to increase her strength to the level of a Spirit Paragon. This kind of person also has a flying Spirit Beast by her side; do you want to go and s.n.a.t.c.h it from her?\" Nalan He thought that his trip here was completely wasted and had a raging inferno in his heart and vented it all on the Imperial Bodyguard.\"Your subordinate doesn't dare.\" The guard immediately cupped his hands and said.\"Go back and pack up, let's leave this mountain valley first.\" Nalan He commanded.\"Yes, Family Leader.\"Nalan Clan's people moved out quickly while the others also left the mountain peak successively. Although it wasn't safe to travel along at night, if they remained here, it was unknown whether or not the beasts below would go crazy. If they attacked them, it would spell trouble.There were only two people who didn't move. One of them was Sima Lie while the other was Qing Wu Ya.Sima Lie stood on the mountain peak, watching the direction in which Sima You Yue had left. He had the feeling that that person's silhouette was somewhat familiar, however, he could not remember where he had seen it. He thought for a long time but he never thought that person would be his granddaughter that he had brought up since she was young.However, Qing Wu Ya recognised that it was Sima You Yue. When he first saw the Four Winged Roc, he thought that it was just a coincidence; this guy who stole the Golden Snake Fruit just happened to possess a Four Winged Roc. However, when he recognised that the little white dot sitting on the head on the Four Winged Roc was Little Roar, he was certain that person was Sima You Yue.However, he had no intentions on revealing this piece of news; it counted as his repayment to Sima You Yue for saving his life. When he heard his father shout for her, he turned around and left with them.On the other hand, Sima Lie initially saw Little Roar as well. However, he had never seen the Four Winged Roc before and thought that it was some white feathers on the Four Winged Roc's forehead. As a result, he had missed the chance to recognise Sima You Yue.\"General, that person\u2026 we are unable to defeat her right now\u2026\" After the Imperial Bodyguard came beside Sima Lie and saw that he was gazing towards the direction that Sima You Yue had left, he thought that Sima Lie was still unresigned.\"I know.\" Sima Lie said, \"Get everyone to pack their things and leave.\"\"Yes, General.\"Very quickly, the noisy mountain valley quieted down, leaving behind only the carca.s.ses of the Spirit Beasts who had died in the battle.It was not that the people who had left did not entertain thoughts of taking away the dead bodies, however, these Spirit Beasts had always hated it when humans s.n.a.t.c.hed away the dead bodies. Although it wasn't their own species, they would not permit it under these circ.u.mstances.There were so many Spirit Beasts right now that although these people wanted to bring them back with them, they still left.Sima You yue sat on Little Roc as they flew towards the outer region. Sitting on his back and looking down, the view as the moon shone down on the Pu Luo Mountain Range was really not bad.After leaving the Mountain Valley by quite a distance, Mo Sha took back his power, saying, \"I'm going back. My soul has been unstable this entire time and I've even sustained injuries. I won't be able to lend you my power again in the near future.\"Hearing that Mo Sha's voice was a bit weak, Sima You Yue asked worriedly, \"How are you feeling? Is it serious?\"\"It's nothing, I just need to absorb the gas from the Golden Snake Fruit Tree for awhile and I'll be fine.\" Mo Sha said, \"the next time I come out, there won't be this kind of circ.u.mstance anymore.\"\"In that case do you want to eat a Golden Snake Fruit?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"No need, I can't eat it, anyway. My current soul can't handle the explosive energy from the Golden Snake Fruit at all.\" Mo Sha said, \"If you really want me to recover quicker, it's not like there's no method.\"\"What method?\"\"Alchemy.\" Mo Sha said, \"As long as you are able to refine some pills that can benefit the soul, I will be able to recover faster.\"\"How am I supposed to refine Dark Pills.\" Sima You Yue was initially excited when she heard that there was a way, but was discouraged when she heard him talk about Dark Pills.\"Have you forgotten about your physique?\" Mo Sha said.\"Light Devil's body?\" Sima You Yue didn't understand, what did this have to do with refining Dark Pills?\"People who have the Devil's physique are able to absorb dark spiritual qi. As long as you possess dark spiritual Qi, when you are alchemising pills, just it in and you will be able to concoct Dark Pills.\" Mo Sha explained.\"Huh, I can absorb dark spiritual qi?\" Sima You Yue said with surprise, \"then what rank of pills will be of use to you?\"\"At the very least it must be sixth rank.\" Mo Sha said, \"right now, you are only able to refine pills at rank one. It's still too early for you to refine pills that will be of use to me.\"Sima You Yue touched her nose, saying, \"This is the hidden reason why you were willing to come out and teach me how to refine pills, right?\"She'd said it earlier, at that time, when she had felt that she was of a Light Devil's body, she was wondering why he was so willing to reveal the fact that they had a contract with each other. He was even pa.s.sionately teaching her alchemy. It turns out that he was just thinking that she would be able to refine some Dark Pills that would be useful to him in the future.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Insanely Pampered Wife: Divine Doctor Fifth Young MissChapter 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88: Something happened again!Mo Shan didn't deny it because his primary objective for teaching her alchemy really was because he had this goal in mind.\"I'm going back. News about the person who stole the Golden Snake Fruit possessing a Four Winged Roc will spread very quickly. It's best for you to keep him and go back on your own. In any case, with your current level of strength, n.o.body will suspect you.Mo Sha entered the Spirit Peal after speaking and came beside the Golden Snake Fruit Tree.Little Spirit already planted the Golden Snake Fruit Tree into a large flower pot. Although there was the situation where it just changed its soil, the Golden Snake Fruit did not suffer much damage.\"I specially planted it in this flower pot.\" Little Spirit appeared beside Mo Sha and said, \"This needs to absorb moonlight at night in order to change it into strength, so this will be more convenient when she wants to take it out in the future.\"\"Mm, your idea is not bad.\" Mo Sha nodded in approval as his soul floated beside the Golden Snake Fruit Tree and sat down as he closed his eyes and began his meditation.When Little Spirit saw this, he disappeared as wordlessly as when he came.When Mo Sha left, Sima You Yue let Little Roc choose a place to land before keeping him into the Spirit Pearl.Mo Sha was right, news of her leaving on the Four Winged Roc probably already reached Salt City. If she returned while sitting on him, she might end up attracting unnecessary trouble.However, if she pretended to get rid of him on her return, a Spirit Master with no special rank would definitely not attract any attention at all. In any case, she had already arrived in the central region and it was no longer too dangerous for her.Hugging Little Roar in her embrace, she chose a large and tall tree and crawled up to the lush foliage in a moment. She chose a relatively thick branch before lying on it and sleeping through the night.When early morning came and the first light of dawn shone on her face, she woke up and hopped onto the ground with a twist of her body. She clapped her hands, letting Little Roar choose a direction to head towards the outer regions and begin travelling.After walking for half a day, she encountered a group of people who were leaving as well. Although, when they first saw her, they didn't manage to link her up with the person yesterday, they were still surprised when they saw that she was wandering around the central regions alone.Sima You Yue directly disregarded their appraising looks and was neither interested in those people nor talking to them.She communicated with Ya Guang while she was rus.h.i.+ng down and realised that they did not really leave that far and planned on going back together with them.Little Roar was lying down on Sima You Yue's shoulder the entire time and didn't use his use his own effort to walk at all. However, because he was chatting the entire way, Sima You Yue also felt like the journey was not that far.\"Master, help!\"Sima You Yue was just joking with Little Roar when she suddenly heard Ya Guang's cry for help.\"Ya Guang, what's wrong?\" When she heard his shout, she asked anxiously.\"Master, come quickly, we can't hold on anymore, you must come now!\"Ya Guang went silent after he finished speaking, causing Sima You Yue to jump up in front. She only calmed down when she felt his connection with her.\"Little Roar!\" Sima You Yue immediately shouted.\"Yue Yue, come up.\"Little Roar enlarged his body big enough for Sima You Yue to sit on top before bringing her to fly through the air.It really seemed as if the distance that separated them was not large as a strong smell of blood came around half an hour later. There was also a dull fragrance coming from the air.\"Oh no, Yue Yue, I don't have anymore strength.\" Little Roar suddenly shouted.\"Little Roar, what's wrong with you?\" Sima You Yue could feel like Little Roar was not normal and asked.\"Yue Yue, this air is strange. It's like it's sucking out all the energy in my body.\" Little Roar stopped and his eyes started to lose focus.Sima You Yue felt for a bit and knew that they were not far from where Ya Guang was. So much so that she could barely hear sounds of them fighting. The battle must be taking place somewhere not too far in front of her.\"Little Roar, go back first and leave the rest to me.\"Sima You Yue got down and kept Little Roar into the Spirit Peal to let Little Spirit take care of him before rus.h.i.+ng towards the front. Suddenly, she realised that a few silhouettes were hiding in the area in front of her. It looked like those people were peeping over at what was happening over there.\"Boss, never thought that those people would be able to hold up against that Acacia Silk Snake for such a long time.\"\"Right now, they're relying on that Bei Gong Tang to hold up against it. If she falls, the other three won't be able to hold on.\"\"No matter what, this time, they're doomed for sure!\"\"Haha, Boss is truly wise. You're actually able to lead them to the territory of the Acacia Silk Snake.\"The man who was referred to as Boss gave a cold snort, saying, \"Didn't expect that the wolf pack the last time didn't manage to kill them and we actually ran into them here. It's just a pity that Sima You Yue is not here, otherwise, we'd be able to eliminate them all in one fell swoop!\"\"Since they're all here, I think that Sima You Yue should be nearby. As long as we settle the four of them, that waste will fall within your grasp.\"Sima You Yue quietly snuck towards them and heard their conversation clearly. She laughed coldly in her heart. She just knew that there was something off about the Fire Wolf pack the last time, it turns out that these people were the perpetrators!With a single though, a jade bottle appeared in her hand. She opened the cap and threw the bottle towards the middle of those people.Those who were watching Bei Gong Tang bear the brunt of the force relentlessly heard a sound and turned their head in order to see what happened and realised that Sima You Yue was standing not too far from them, watching them with a cold air.\"Sima You Yue, when did you manage to come behind us?\" That man shouted with surprise.When they heard that man's voice, the others turned around as well. One of them was the one who was chased by that pack of wolves.\"So it was you who caused the situation to happen that time!\" Sima You Yue glared at them as her eyes flashed with unconcealed bloodl.u.s.t.The few of them were intimidated by her imposing manner. Was this really the aura of a waste?\"Sima You Yue, what do you want?\"Hearing sounds of the battle in front of her, Sima You Yue glanced over at the front and happened to see that Bei Gong Tang was sent flying by a hit from the tail of the Acacia Silk Snake. Her heart filled with anxiousness, saying, \"You all will find out what I want to do in a moment!\"\"Are you still thinking of saving them?\" The Boss looked at Sima You Yue, \"We initially planned to kill you all secretly, however, since you've discovered us, we'll directly send you to the gates of h.e.l.l!\"\"That will depend on whether or not you have the ability!\" Sima You Yue directly went past them when she finished speaking and charged towards the empty s.p.a.ce in front.The few of them wanted to attack her, but they realised that at an unknown time, they could no longer move a muscle.Bei Gong Tang was whipped by the Acacia Silk Snake's tail and was sent flying heavily, sending a cloud of dust flying as she landed.\"Pffff-\"A sweet taste rose up in her throat as a mouthful of blood spurted out. There were even some particles mixed into to the blood that was sprayed on the ground.\"Bei Gong, quickly run away! Don't care about us anymore!\" Wei Zi Qi lay on the ground shouting at Bei Gong Tang.Bei Gong Tang thought about how, ever since she had crawled up from the ground, she had failed in both times she had tried. With one hand clasped on the ground and another grasping her chest, her face was a sheet of white as she looked towards the Acacia Silk Snake in front of her. She said weakly, \" Since you've said that time that we were a team, there's no way I can throw you aside and not care about you!\"\"You silly show off girlie, it's a pity that I don't like these kind of people!\" That Acacia Silk Snake flung its tail towards Bei Gong Tang, \"Never thought that a person would be able to hold up against me for so long, I'll send you to h.e.l.l right now. Relax, with a single hit from my tail, you won't feel the pain of death.\"After speaking, its tail rose high in the sky as it looked at the body of Bei Gong Tang, its target.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

It had already proven its prowess just now; if she got hit by it again, she really would end up paying a visit to Yama, the King of h.e.l.l.However, she was unable to move as her leg was already broken. It was hard to move any part of her body. She had no choice but to close her eyes and wait for his final strike.\"Meng Ji, I'm sorry. I can no longer wait for you to awaken. Mum, younger brother, sorry, I can\u2019t fulfill our promise, I'm coming back to you all\u2026\"However, the pain that she imagined did not come. Instead, she heard a clang and the sound of the snake tail hitting the ground beside her.\"You Yue?!\"Bei gong Tang heard the shouts of surprise as she opened her eyes to see Sima You Yue's steady back. His hand was holding onto a weapon and it was actually\u2026a frying pan!Sima You Yue turned around and looked at her,saying, \"Bei Gong, I've arrived.\"If not for the fact that the weapon in her hand was too amusing, Bei Gong would definitely have felt that the current Sima You Yue was extremely eye catching. It was a pity that silly weapon really ruined her image too much.Sima You Yue noticed that Bei Gong Tang's gaze was on the frying pan in her hands and she smirked, saying, \" The situation was too urgent so I had to make do.\"She was also rendered completely speechless by the frying pan in her hands. As she was charging over, that Acacia Silk Snake was already going to strike Bei Gong Tang. She had no time to think it through and directly shouted for Ling Long. However, she didn't know that Ling Long just happened to be transforming and happened to have just changed into a frying pan as she was taken out.Using a frying pan to save a person\u2026 she had never heard about anyone like this since the beginning of time.Ling Long was also filled with limitless resentment when faced with Sima You Yue's disdain. Her image\u2026 Sima You Yue had completely destroyed it.Everyone awoke from their initial shock before remembering what situation they were currently in.\"You Yue, leave quickly, this territory belongs to the Acacia Silk Snake. Once you smell the fragrance it shoots out, men will lose all strength!\" Bei Gong Tang shouted anxiously.Sima You Yue glanced over at the Acacia silk Snake's 7 inch area that was thras.h.i.+ng about on the ground after being beaten by her. There was the badly wounded Bei Gong Tang as well as Wei Zi Qi's limp and weak but unharmed group of three, together with Ya Guang. She understood why they would actually fall to this Acacia Silk Snake that had just increased its rank to Saint Ranked.Sima You Yue bent over and carried Bei Gong Tang and carried her over beside Wei Zi Qi and the others. She took out a Jade pill bottle and said, \"Are you still able to feed yourself some medicine?\"Bei Gong Tang nodded and grabbed on to Sima You Yue's hand, saying, \"You Yue, you're not a girl and will get poisoned right away. Quickly run away while the Acacia Silk Snake hasn't come over yet!\"\"Yeah, You Yue, escape quickly!\" Fatty Qu said to Sima You Yue as he lay paralysed on top on Ya Guang's body.Although Wei Zi Qi and Ouyang Fei didn't say anything, the meaning behind the gaze in their eyes was clear enough to tell her what they thought.\"Ah! d.a.m.ned human, I'm going to kill you!\" The Acacia Silk Snake was refreshed after its momentary rest as it spat at her.The seventh inch was the snake species' most vulnerable place. After being maliciously attacked, it took a long while before the snake could move again.\"You Yue\u2026\" Bei Gong Tang pushed Sima You Yue, wanting him to run away quickly.Sima You Yue patted her hand, saying, \"Don't worry. It's useless against me.\"After speaking, she picked up the frying pan that she had tossed aside and stood up. Standing in front of the few of them, she stared directly at the Acacia Silk Snake.\" I never knew that a snake like you existed. All male are unable to stand against you, allowing you to live on disgracefully until now. This young master feels like drinking some snake soup, why don't you contribute?\"The Acacia Silk Snake laughed coldly upon Sima You Yue's provocation, saying, \"Presumptuous kid, how long has it already been since you arrived here. In a moment, you will be like all the other males and lose your strength. You're actually acting so rashly even now!\"Sima You Yue tightened her grasp on the frying pan in her hand, saying, \" I've already told you that it's useless on me. Otherwise, how would I be able to retain my strength until now?\"\"Impossible\" The Acacia Silk Snake trusted fully in its own abilities and was quite puzzled towards the fact that Sima You Yue had yet to lie paralysed on the ground.\"What's so impossible about it?\" Sima You Yue smiled as she said, \"When did I ever say I was a man?\"After she finished speaking, she took advantage of that momentary period where it was stunned and charged up.A Saint Beast was currently not at the level where she could defeat it alone. She had to take advantage of the time where it was caught off guard in order to attack its 7th inch. Only this way would she attain victory.The Acacia Silk Snake quickly returned to its senses. With a wave of its tail, it directly attacked Sima You Yue.Sima You Yue flashed towards the left, narrowly avoiding the attack. She even used the chance to move closer by a few steps, decreasing her distance from the Acacia Silk Snake.\"When did I ever say I was a man?\"The four of them didn't believe it. However, she was not affected by the Acacia Silk Snake's fragrance and was still battling it with full strength. Fighting up, down, left and right\u2026 it looked like her energy supply was completely fine.Sima You Yue was actually female!\"Fifth Ranked Spirit Master!\"Even before that surprising piece of news had settled, because Sima You Yue was using Spirit Power, it revealed to them her real level of strength. They were given another huge shock.\"I'm not seeing things wrongly right?\" Fatty Qu wanted to stretch out his hand to rub his eyes, but because he couldn't move, he could only try his best to blink his eyes in order to ascertain that his eyes weren\u2019t blurred.\"Really never expected that Sima You Yue's strength actually reached Fifth Ranked Spirit Master already.\" Wei Zi Qi sighed with admiration.\"Fifth Ranked Spirit Master battling a Saint Beast\u2026\" Ouyang Fei didn't complete his sentence but everyone understood what he meant.Spirit Warriors, Spirit Masters and Great Spirit Masters were able to battle with lowly ranked Spirit Beasts. Highly Ranked Great Spirit Masters, Spirit Kings and Spirit Overlords were able to battle Saint Beasts. This Acacia Silk Snake was already a first ranked Saint Beast and, at the very least, would need a Great Spirit Master in order to be its match.However, Sima You Yue was currently only a Fifth Ranked Spirit Master. The outcome of her wanting to defeat a Saint Beast was obvious.\"I believe in her as well.\" Bei Gong Tang said.After eating the pill that Sima You Yue had given her, the pain from her wounds had gradually subsided and her voice did not sound as weak.\"The thrills that Sima You Yue has given us today is really not little. Being a mere Spirit Master that wants to battle a Saint Beast is something that not everyone can accomplish.\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"Who knows, she may be able to pull off a miracle!\" Bei Gong Tang looked directly at Sima you Yue.She believed that Sima You Yue did not speak irresponsibly. When Sima You Yue was talking to her, she saw the confidence in Sima You Yue's eyes. That look made her believe that she would definitely perform a miracle today!Ouyang Fei watched Sima You Yue. He also wanted to believe that she would be able to defeat the Acacia Silk Snake, however, the difference in rank was really too great.

    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Insanely Pampered Wife: Divine Doctor Fifth Young MissChapter 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 90: Serious Wounds and DangerSima You Yue was completely clueless towards the thoughts that were running through the minds of the few people behind her. In any case, she was unable to think about other things and had to give 120 percent of her attention to the Acacia Silk Snake in front of her.Right now, Ya Guang and Little Roar were unable to help her so she could only rely on her own strength to defeat this Acacia Silk Snake.However, in the minds of others, normally, only highly ranked Great Spirit Masters would be able to defeat Saint Beasts. She was an entire rank lower than it, so she had to think of other methods in order to defeat it.Furthermore, the only thing that she was able to rely on now was strength.In her past life, she knew a profound martial art that focused solely on speed. So when she came to this world and was cultivating her body, she thought of ways to attain the martial art moves that she used to know.When the Acacia Silk Snake saw that Sima You Yue was actually more agile than its tail, its heart raged even more. It increased the speed of which it was swinging its tail, forcing Sima You Yue to increase her speed as well. There were a few times where she was struck by the tail, sending her cras.h.i.+ng heavily into the ground.She felt a scorching heat coming from behind and a piercing pain came when she mover her left hand slightly. According to her past experiences, she knew that she had broken at least two ribs.\"I can't carry on like this, I need to think of a solution quickly!\"Sima You Yue felt that the strength in her body was quickly fading away and there was not much left of her spirit power either. If she continued like this, she would definitely be the one to suffer a crus.h.i.+ng defeat.As a result, when the Acacia Silk Snake tried to attack her again, this time, she didn't choose to hide. Instead, she narrowly avoided it and grabbed onto the tail when it brought its tail back to its body, brandis.h.i.+ng the frying pan in hand, striking it heavily.When Bei Gong Tang and the others saw that Sima You Yue had actually grabbed onto the Acacia Silk Snake, they were very worried for her. Seeing her brandish that frying pan so naturally and landing a direct hit on that Acacia Silk Snake, they really didn't know whether to laugh or cry. If it wasn't such an inappropriate timing right now, it appeared that they would have laughed out loud long ago.If they were able to survive today, this scene would definitely be etched into their memory for the rest of their lives.Even though Ling long had transformed into a frying pan, her power was definitely not comparable to an ordinary frying pan. Even a Spirit Beast with thick skin that would normally stand up to a beating would suffer under the hands of Sima You Yue's attacks.\"Argh- malicious human!\" The tail of the Acacia Silk Snake thrashed about in pain. Sima You Yue, who was hugging onto its tail, had to hug on tightly with her legs in order to avoid getting thrown off.\"Die!\"The Acacia Silk Snake heavily raised its tail as it prepared to smash her to death on the ground.Sima You Yue saw a position that was just right and she released its tail, landing on the seventh inch part of the Acacia Silk Snake. With a slight tilt of her body, she blocked the vision of Wei Zi Qi and the others. Ling Long, who was in her hands, changed into a dagger as she stabbed it straight in.\"Ah-\"Receiving a fatal injury, the Acacia Silk snake curled up like a bow.Sima You Yue's legs clamped onto the Acacia Silk Snake as her pair of hands wielded the dagger, stabbing the rest of the knife in. After that, she used a lot of strength to pull downwards and the Acacia Silk Snake's back was directly cut with a 90 over metre wound.The Acacia Silk Snake thrashed on the ground as it used all of its remaining strength to viciously fling Sima You Yue off, falling onto the ground, never to stir again.\"You Yue?!\"\"You Yue!\"Bei Gong Tang and the others had already been stunned by the sudden twist in events and shouted anxiously when they saw Sima You Yue lying motionlessly on the ground.\"Ss- ah-\"The Acacia Silk Snake was still thras.h.i.+ng about on the ground, albeit less wildly than before. Eventually, it lay motionlessly on the ground.\"You Yue, what's wrong?\" Bei Gong Tang saw her silhouette lie motionlessly on the ground and her eyes turned red for the first time since they met.However, no matter how much they called out, Sima You Yue did not have any form of response.\"You Yue, You Yue, say something!\" Fatty Qu looked teary eyed at Sima You Yue and wished that he could dash up immediately.\"No, Sima You Yue wouldn't just die like this!\" Wei Zi Qi mumbled.\"What are you all fl.u.s.tered about?! Ya Guang is still breathing so this shows that You Yue is still alive.\" At this crucial moment, it was still Ouyang Fei who retained some clarity of mind and he reminded them as he saw Ya Guang who was lying down under Fatty Qu's body.\"She- she's fine?\" Fatty Qu glanced coldly at Ouyang Fei as he felt the breathing under his body. His heart gradually calmed down.Seeing her crumpled on the ground after a battle with a Saint Ranked beast, it was no wonder that everyone thought that she was dead.\"cough cough-\"After a moment, light coughing sounds could be heard. It was music to the ears of the four of them.\"You Yue!\"\"You Yue, how are you feeling?\"Sima You Yue moved her body and there was not a single part of her body that didn't hurt. With a thought, a Jade pill bottle appeared in her hand. With great difficulty, she ate the pill before turning her head over to look at Wei Zi Qi and the rest.\"I'm fine.\"Seeing Sima You Yue's exhausted yet s.h.i.+ning eyes, the four of them relaxed.As long as she was alive, it was fine.After they had rested for around an hour, Wei Zi Qi and the others finally felt that their bodies had recovered a bit of strength. Ouyang Fei was the first to regain his movement as he struggled to get up, rocking and shaking as he came beside Sima You Yue. He stretched forth a hand and wanted to give her a hug.\"Hiss-\"When Sima You Yue moved, she felt a cold and even more biting pain.\"Which part hurts?\" Ouyang Fei didn\u2019t dare to move again after seeing Sima You Yue in pain. He hugged Sima You Yue as they sat in their original spot.\"Cough cough, I think most of my ribs are broken. The injuries in other places are not too light either.\" Sima You Yue said.Ouyang Fei supported Sima You Yue with one hand, and with a single thought, a Jade pill bottle appeared in his other hand.A fourth ranked pill?!Sima You Yue was incomparably shocked when she saw the pill in Ouyang Fei's hand.How could he have such a precious pill?!Ouyang Fei didn't say anything before directly feeding Sima You Yue the pill without letting her voice any objections.Wei Zi Qi and the others also regained their strength as they came beside Bei Gong Tang, saying, \"How are you?\"\"Nothing major, my legs are just broken and I can't walk.\" Bei Gong Tang said.Wei Zi Qi pulled up Bei Gong Tang's pants and saw how much her leg had swollen.\"I'll go look for a rod to help you stint it.\" Fatty Qu, who was the last to crawl back up, said.\"Wait, Fatty.\" Sima You Yue was wrapped in Ouyang Fei's embrace as she said, \"Let's leave this place first or we'll be in trouble when other Spirit Beasts are attracted here.\"\"Right, let's leave first.\" Wei Zi Qi said, \"Bei Gong, I'll carry you. We'll bandage you in a moment.\"\"Mm.\" Bei Gong Tang nodded and could not be bothered about things like the inappropriateness between male or female for the moment.Sima You Yue called out Ya Guang before calling out Little Roar and letting him enlarge his body.\"Yue Yue, why are you so seriously injured?\" Little Roar saw the wounds on Sima You Yue's body and said tearfully, \" It's all Little Roar's fault. I screwed up when I was supposed to guard you.\"\" It's not your fault. Grow a little bigger, enough for ten people.\" Sima You Yue said as she shook her head.\"Okay.\"Little Roar's body flashed as he became bigger. It was no problem even if ten people lay down.\"You Yue, why do you want s.p.a.ce for ten people?\" Fatty Qu didn't understand.Sima You Yue looked into the distance, her gaze were cold. \"Because we have to take a few enemies with us.\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

He took out a ropeand bound the whole lot of them before flinging them onto Little Roar\u2019sback.After waiting for Fatty Qu to sit down, Little Roar brought everyone and left the area.After an hour plus, Little Roar found a cave and brought Sima You Yue and the others in.\u201cThis place isn\u2019t bad, lets tend to our wounds here.\u201d Sima You Yue said as she appraised the area.Fatty Qu was the first to hop off. He held those five and grabbedonto one with each hand, carelessly flinging them onto the ground. Afterthat, together with Wei Zi Qi and Ouyang Fei they supported Ouyang Feias they got off.Sima You Yue took out her large bed and set it aside for her and BeiGong Tang to recuperate. Wei Zi Qi and Ouyang Fei carried the two ofthem to the bed.\u201cZi Qi, I\u2019m unable to move right now. I\u2019ll give you instructions while you help me set her bones.\u201d Sima You Yue said.\u201cYou Yue, you even know how to set bones?\u201d Fatty Qu looked at Sima You Yue with surprise.\u201cPast experience.\u201d Two boards appeared in her hands as she finished speaking. \u201d Use this to fix it properly.\u201d\u201cMm, you just tell me what to do and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Wei Zi Qi said as he took the wooden boards.After that, Sima You Yue instructed Wei Zi Qi on how to properly setBei Gong Tang\u2019s legs before telling all of them to get out beforestripping her clothes to get Bei Gong Tang to set her own bones.When they went outside the cave, Fatty Qu and the others finally thought of the secret they had discovered today.\u201cYou Yue really is a girl?\u201d Fatty Qu was unable to accept this facteven until now, \u201d If anyone were to find out that You Yue was a girl,the entire capital would be thunderstruck.\u201dWei Zi Qi and the others weren\u2019t clear either. They had alwaysthought that Sima You Yue was a male. They really needed to digest thisnew information that she was a female.\u201cThere must be some special circ.u.mstances since the General\u2019sresidence has always let her masquerade as a male. I think it\u2019s betterif we don\u2019t expose this.\u201d Ouyang Fei said.\u201cI\u2019m thinking the same thing.\u201d Wei Zi Qi said, \u201cn.o.body has ever foundout that Sima You Yue\u2019s real ident.i.ty was female; the General\u2019sresidence is really able to keep a secret. If You Yue wanted others toknow, she would have mentioned it herself. Since she didn\u2019t sayanything, there must be some unavoidable circ.u.mstance.\u201d\u201cMm, you guys are right. We better not say anything to avoid givingher any trouble.\u201d Fatty Qu nodded his head in agreement, \u201cHowever, YouYue is actually a Fifth Ranked Spirit master, it\u2019s really unbelievable.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d Ouyang Fei nodded.The few of them were bantering at the cave entrance when, after quitea long while, Bei Gong Tang finally called them from inside to let themknow that they were done and that they could enter.Fatty Qu and the others went in and saw Sima You Yue lying on thebed. Her left cheek sported a long gash because she had sc.r.a.ped itagainst a rock during battle. It was even more obvious after they hadwashed the dried blood off.\u201cYou Yue, your injuries?\u201d Wei Zi Qi asked.\u201cNo problem, it\u2019ll be fine after lying down for two days.\u201d Sima You Yue said.\u201cWhat I mean is, that wound on your face\u2026 will it leave a scar?\u201d Wei Zi Qi asked.If she was a male then it was no problem. However, if she was femalethen they placed more importance on appearance. If a woman\u2019s face wasscarred, it was the same as asking her to give up her cultivationstrength.Sima You Yue blinked in confusion before she understood what Wei ZiQi was saying. She replied, \u201cNo problem, I can just put someanti-scarring medicine for a season when I return and then it\u2019ll befine.\u201d\u201cThat would be great.\u201dWhen Wei Zi Qi finished speaking, the whole atmosphere in the cave turned a little awkward.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you guys?\u201d Sima You Yue broke out in gooseb.u.mpswhen she saw the strange way the few of them were looking at her.\u201cCough cough, You Yue uh, we haven\u2019t yet known how to react to thissudden knowledge that you\u2019re female.\u201d Fatty Qu said, \u201cHowever, if youthink about it, if it wasn\u2019t for what happened today, we would probablynever find out that you\u2019re female. How did you disguise yourself as amale? Could you possibly be the rumored Airport Runway?\u201d\u201cCough cough, how could I possibly be an Airport Runway?!\u201d Sima YouYue choked on what Fatty Qu said and almost couldn\u2019t draw her nextbreath. The last time that they had gone to watch some pretty women, shehad talked about some Airport Runways. She never expected that this guywould actually remember.\u201cIf you\u2019re not an airport runway, how come we\u2019ve never noticed thatyou have these?\u201d After he finished speaking, Fatty Qu even rubbed hischest, his action was extremely obscene.\u201cGo and die you stupid Fatty! Argh-\u201d Sima You Yue had used too muchforce while shouting that, along with the wounds on her body, had causedher to be in so much pain. Her expression immediately turned cold.\u201cYou should be a bit more careful.\u201d Bei Gong Tang sat at the side ofthe bed, stretching forth one hand to press on Sima You Yue. After that,she berated, \u201cFatty, You Yue is currently covered with wounds. Therearen\u2019t even a few ribs of hers that aren\u2019t broken but you\u2019re stillprovoking her!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just speaking frankly.\u201d Fatty Qu shrunk his neck as he felt wronged.He was merely curious, how did this Sima You Yue avoid detection under their discerning eyes?\u201cWe\u2019re also quite curious about this.\u201d Wei Zi Qi probed Sima You Yue.Ouyang Fei stared at Sima You Yue, his meaning glaringly obvious.\u201cCough cough, You Yue, why don\u2019t you just tell them. Otherwise, they\u2019ll keep staring at you.\u201d Bei Gong Tang said casually.She would never admit that she was curious as well.Sima You Yue could not help but roll her eyes, saying, \u201cYou guys willnever give it up unless I tell you; and if you frustratingly a.s.sumethat my chest is like an airport runway, it will be too disastrous formy image. Ugh, its due to the ring on my finger. As long as I put it on,you will all see me as a male.After she finished speaking, she took off her ring. Her body appeared to transform instantaneously.Wei Zi Qi and the others never expected that Sima You Yue woulddirectly take off her ring, causing a man to turn into a ***** woman.Everyone was incomparably shocked.Sima You Yue quickly put the ring back on and the female bodydisappeared. She really appeared as a guy in front of everyone\u2019s eyes,as if that female her never existed\u201cToo strange!\u201d Fatty Qu cried out with shock, \u201cThat this ringactually exists in this world\u2026 I initially thought that onlyinterspatial rings existed.\u201d\u201cReally very strange.\u201d Wei Zi Qi said, \u201d Where did you get this ringfrom? If we have the opportunity, we\u2019ll also go make one to wear.\u201dWhen she heard this, Sima You Yue was stunned. A picture of Wu LingYu flashed in her mind along with that forceful kiss just before heleft. Who knows what that evildoer, who had shouted to her grow upquickly, was doing right now. Did he already forget her?In a palace far away sat Wu Ling Yu who was reading a book. His heartwas suddenly moved and stared out the window as if he was aware ofsomething.\u201cLittle girl, you have to grow up quickly\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He never told me the reason either.\"\"Rest a.s.sured, we have already discussed it just now, we won't tell anyone about this. The fact that you're a woman will never come out from our lips.\"\"Mm, I know you all won't tell.\" Sima You Yue said definitively, if they even had a single possibility of having this thought, she would not have gone to save them, anyway.\"Wu-\"The sound of sleeping talking came from the side, reminding Sima You Yue and the others of their presence.\"Who are these people and why did they want to hurt us?\" Wei Zi Qi asked with furrowed eyebrows as he looked at the group of people flung on the ground.\"Look carefully at the person on the extreme left.\" Sima You Yue saidThe person on the extreme left?When Fatty Qu that flung that person's body down, he was lying face down and he was facing towards the wall so n.o.body noticed him.When they heard what Sima You Yue said, Fatty Qu ran over and gave him a kick, causing him to flip over and face the ceiling.\"It's him?\" Fatty Qu called out with surprise.\"Fatty Qu, you know him?\" Wei Zi Qi asked.\"I'm not the only one, you guys know him as well.\" Fatty Qu stepped away to let the others see the face on the ground as well.\"It's him?!\"\"How could it be him? Don't tell me\u2026\"The three of them had been shocked when they saw this people and all recalled their previous encounter with the wolf pack. They had found it strange at the time, and looking at it now, these people must have intentionally led the wolf pack to them.\"These people actually keep trying to kill us over and over again!\" Wei Zi Qi clenched his fists, with only his good upbringing stopped him from rus.h.i.+ng up to kill them all immediately.\"Who are these people? Why do they want to kill us?\" Ouyang Fei didn't understand.\"I think I know the reason.\" Fatty Qu said.\"You do?\" Bei Gong Tang looked at Fatty Qu and wondered how he could possibly know.Fatty Qu came beside the person and gave him a kick. He looked at his face and said, \"I know this jerk. He's one cla.s.s above us, he's called Shou Hou.\"\"In this case, these people are all from our school?\" Wei Zi Qi asked.Fatty Qu nodded, saying, this Shou Hou is in the same cla.s.s as Wu Tian. As for that Wu Tian, I heard that he's head over heels for Nalan Lan.\"\"So you're saying that they want to harm us in order to help Nalan Lan take revenge because we chased her out of school.\" Sima You Yue said, \"At the end of the day, it's me who has burdened you all!\"\"You Yue, don't say that. We are a team, what's this about burdening or not burdening. If it wasn't for you, we would have turned into the Acacia Silk Snake's lunch.\" Wei Zi Qi said.\"Yeah, You Yue don't think about nonsense.\" Fatty Qu said, \"Since we know that these people are from the academy, what should we do now? How should we settle these people?\"Everyone quieted down when he said this. According to their way of thinking, it would definitely be tooth for tooth, an eye for an eye. These people wanted to kill them so there was no need to leave them with their lives.However, they knew now that these people were from the academy. According to rules of the academy, you weren't allowed to harm other students or else you would be expelled. This was a large handcuff on what they could possibly do.Everyone looked to sima You Yue. Since they had come because of her, she had the most right to decide.Sima You Yue smiled, saying, \"I don't recognise a single one of them. Since we encountered some people trying to kill us in Pu Luo Mountain Range, it's natural for us to retaliate. It's not like we know who these people are, right?\"Everyone was stunned when they heard Sima You Yue say this.\"Yeah, we don't know who these people are at all; don't know which faction they belong to. Totally don't know why they want to hurt us.\" Bei Gong Tang was the first to react and replied Sima You Yue.There were many people who went in and out of the Pu Luo Mountain Range. If they met someone who tried to kill them, they would definitely retaliate. If they accidentally killed them, it had nothing to do with the school.Afterall, they really didn't know their ident.i.ties before.\"Yeah, we don't recognise them.\" Wei Zi Qi also affirmed as he nodded his head.\"Since this is the case, what do we do with these people that we don't recognise, yet still wanted to kill us? Ouyang Fei asked.Sima You Yue smiled secretly when she heard everyone speak this way. These guys, each and everyone single one of them acted innocent but were actually so evil.\"No matter what we do, in any case, we can't let them leave this mountain alive.\" Bei Gong Tang said, \"If we have no other ideas, I don't mind personally ending their lives.\"\"Why dirty our own hands.\" Sima You yue said, \"Since they know how to use Spirit Beasts to attack us, we have to pay them back in full, exactly as they have done to us.\"\"You Yue, what good ideas do you have? Fatty Qu saw the gleam in Sima You Yue's eyes and knew that she had thought of another good idea.\"This\u2026 you will know when the time comes.\" Sima You Yue didn't say anything, she only smiled secretively.When the others saw this, they knew she had an idea and didn't probe any further.\"Uhmm, You Yue\u2026\" After they finished speaking about this, Bei Gong Tang looked at Sima You Yue as if she had something to say but was hesitant.Sima You Yue immediately knew what she meant. With a single thought, a Golden Snake Fruit appeared in her hands.She handed the Golden Snake Fruit over, saying, \"You should keep this first. The Golden Snake Fruit shouldn't be left out for too long or else it will attract Spirit Beasts over.\"\"It's really the Golden Snake Fruit!\" Fatty Qu looked at that Golden Snake Fruit with surprise, \"You Yue, how did you manage this?\"\"Don't ask about this, you guys.\" Sima You Yue shoved the Golden Snake Fruit into Bei Gong Tang's hands and she quickly kept it into her interspatial ring.\"You Yue, thank you!\"Although Sima You Yue didn't say it, everyone knew that it definitely wasn't easy. Especially since so many Spirit Beasts and experts had coveted this.Sima You Yue looked the three of them in the eye, saying, \" You all have a share. However, if one were to directly ingest this, the power would be too explosive and one's body would definitely not be able to handle it. Do you all want the fruit right now or the pill?\"Fatty Qu and the others thought about it for a while and said, \"Since the fruit is not too useful for humans to directly consume, I'll prefer the pill.\"\"I want the pill as well.\" Wei Zi Qi said.Ouyang Fei thought it over for a moment, saying, \"I want the fruit.\"Sima You Yue didn't ask why as she took a fruit and handed it to Ouyang Fei who immediately kept it.They had previously agreed that as long as they helped Bei Gong Tang scatter that thing onto the bodies of the Nalan Clan's people, she would distribute these to them. As a result, they could have whatever they wanted.In any case, she had kept the Golden Snake Fruit Tree, so with regards to her, whose soul was damaged, that was the greatest treasure. Furthermore, Little Spirit had already told her that she could transfer out an individual s.p.a.ce, where she could speed up time, reducing the time it took for the Golden Snake Fruit to mature. Who knows, she might have a few more Golden Snake Fruits not too far from now.As for pills, Mo Sha could help her settle that. All she needed to do during the fusing stage was to input some Spirit Power and it would be enough.When they saw that Sima You Yue was so generous, the hearts of the other four were extremely moved and this team was even more united than before.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

If they really were able to increase a rank by obtaining the fruit then waiting for a period of time was really nothing much.\"Oh right, You Yue, what was that thing that you called us to scatter on the Nalan Clan?\" Bei Gong Tang asked.\"Enchanting Powder.\" Sima You Yue said, \"As long as that smell sticks on your body, you'll never be able to wash it off no matter how hard you try.\"\"What does it do?\" Ouyang Fei asked.\"That\u2026 wait for the effects to take place then you will know.\" Sima You Yue smirked evilly.Since the Nalan Clan wanted to go out and find trouble with the Sima Clan, she would make it so that they wouldn't be able to go out at all.\"Enough, You Yue is injured and can't speak too much. Everyone is tired so we should all get some rest.\" Ouyang Fei said.\"Mm.\"Because Sima You Yue and Bei Gong Tang were sleeping on the bed, Ouyang Fei and the others could only look for a place to rest somewhere inside the cave. They didn't bring a bed so they had to make do with chairs and whatever they brought along.The cave soon became quiet because everyone was already worn out by everything that happened in the day and fell asleep quickly.Sima You Yue looked at the side of Ouyang Fei's face and her eyes flashed with suspicion.Fourth Ranked pills were a rarity in Dong Chen Kingdom. He said he was an orphan so how did he obtain such a precious pill? Furthermore, no matter how you looked at it, she felt that he wasn't an ordinary person.Although her heart held many suspicions, she didn't say anything. Just like how she held many secrets, who didn't have things that they didn't want others to know?A night pa.s.sed by quickly and Sima You Yue's pill that healed her inner body quickly revealed its usefulness. Added on to her particular body const.i.tution, when she woke up on the second day, she was already able get off the bed and walk around.\"d.a.m.n, You Yue, your healing abilities are too amazing, okay!\" When they saw Sima You Yue like that, the few of them stared at her with gaping mouths.\"It's the effect of Ouyang Fei's medicine that is amazing.\" Sima You Yue attributed all her healing to that pill.\"Bei Gong, how are you doing?\" Ouyang Fei didn't reply Sima You Yue's underlying question and turned instead to ask Bei Gong Tang.\"Apart from some pain still remaining in my legs, I'm okay in other areas.\" Bei Gong Tang smiled in reply.Although the pill that Sima You Yue gave her was not ranked too highly, the wounds that she had received were not that serious so it was no big deal.\"Let's rest for one more day today. We'll carry on doing other things tomorrow.\" Wei Zi Qi looked towards the people lying near the wall as he said.The things that he was talking about doing was obviously to deal with them.\"The two of you rest first, I'll go look for something to eat and return.\" Ouyang Fei said.\"No need, I have them.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Then I'll go fetch some water.\"\"I have that too.\" Sima You Yue said.\"What about firewood?\"Sima You Yue wanted to say that she had that as well but she didn't want everyone to think that she was Doraemon, so she smiled and shook her head.\"Then we'll go and look for some firewood.\" Ouyang Fei said as he walked out.\"We'll be nearby, if you need anything just shout loudly and we'll rush back.\"After he finished speaking, Wei Zi Qi and Ouyang fei walked out as well.\"What's up with them?\" Sima You Yue saw the three of them rush out as she looked at Bei Gong Tang with confusion.\"Cough cough, it appears that there's something that's not too convenient for them to talk about.\" Bei Gong Tang said.\"Something not too convenient to talk about? Then it's convenient over there?\" Sima You Yue nodded with understanding.It was just having to answer the call of nature, how was this something so inconvenient to say? Sima You Yue looked down on the three of them in her heart.However, she never thought about the fact that she used to have the ident.i.ty of guy so they wouldn't think too much about saying these kind of things in front of her. Now that they knew she was female, they started to feel awkward about it.\"Bei Gong, you've already obtained the Golden Snake Fruit so you should quickly give it to your contracted Beast to eat.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Mm.\" Bei Gong Tang nodded. With a single thought, a green bird appeared in the cave.\"This is\u2026 a Great Argus?\" Sima You Yue looked at Meng Ji's appearance and asked in surprise.The Great Argus belonged to the Phoenix family and the teacher said before that the Yi Lin continent didn't have any phoenixes. But Bei Gong Tang actually had a contract with a Great Argus\u2026 was she someone who was actually not from the mainland at all?!Bei Gong Tang turned a blind eye towards Sima You Yue whose eyes were filled with surprise and then understanding. She knew that Sima You Yue would understand a few things after seeing Meng Ji, but she believed that Sima You Yue would never breathe a word of it.\"Meng Ji, Meng Ji.\" Bei Gong Tang called a few times before Meng Ji slowly opened her eyes.\"Master.\" Meng Ji's voice was a bit weak and it appeared that her wounds were not shallow. She thought that Bei Gong Tang would not call her out without reason so her eyes shone, \"Master, you called me out, don't tell me it's because\u2026\"Bei Gong Tang smiled as she took out the Golden Snake Fruit and placed it beside Meng Ji's beak, saying, \"This Golden Snake Fruit was s.n.a.t.c.hed by You Yue, we have to thank her.\"Meng Ji looked at Sima You Yue who was lying down on the bed and said gratefully, \"Thank you.\"Sima You Yue waved her hands, saying, \"Your family'sMaster has already pledged her life to me so you don't have to thank me.\"When Meng Ji heard this, she looked to Bei Gong Tang with alarm, saying, \"Master, how could you do this? If you have to use your entire life's happiness to trade for this, Meng Ji will never take it!\"\"Pfft-\" When she saw Meng Ji's reaction, Sima You Yue immediately burst out laughing.\"Meng Ji, You Yue was just teasing you.\" Bei Gong Tang said, \"She's a woman, how could I follow her all my life. Alright, if we let this Golden Snake Fruit remain outside for too long, it will attract Spirit Beasts. Quickly eat it then go back to recover.\"\"Master, she's really a female?\" Meng Ji was still looking at Sima You Yue with suspicion. How could she not even notice that Sima You Yue was a female? Even her scent didn't reveal it.\"Enough, quickly eat it and return.\" Sima You Yue said, \"Not only is your body injured, the damage to your soul isn't light. That's why you haven't recovered enough though it's been such a long time. Aside from being able to increase your strength, the Golden Snake Fruit will also heal your soul. Aren't you going to quickly go back and recuperate yet?\"Meng Ji was incomparably shocked. How did she know that her soul was wounded? This was something that even Bei Gong Tang didn't know.\"Her soul was injured? No wonder her wound didn't heal a single bit even though it had been such a long time.\" Bei Gong Tang said.\"Since this is the case, I will return first.\" Meng Ji saw the questioning look in Bei Gong Tang's eyes and picked up the Golden Snake Fruit with her beak before heading back into the contracted s.p.a.ce.Seeing that Bei Gong Tang was quite anxious, Sima You Yue smiled, saying, \"She doesn't want to tell you because she doesn't want you to worry. Anyway, she has the Golden Snake Fruit so I believe she will be alright in no time. You should stop worrying.\"\"You Yue, how did you know that Meng Ji's soul was injured?\" Bei Gong Tang asked.\"Because I have discerning eyes!\" Sima You Yue laughed and said. She would never say that Mo Sha was the one who had told her and could only skirt the topic by asking, \"Oh right, how come those three guys still haven't returned?\"She just finished speaking when she heard the sound of footsteps. It was obvious that the sound came from inside the mountain, however, it wasn't three people, it was a bunch of people.Bei Gong Tang could also hear that the footsteps were a little off and the two of them headed to the cave entrance cautiously, on full alert.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

If they really encountered enemies, this would be able to help stall for a while.The cave that Little Roar had chosen was relatively hidden, but the footsteps were heading directly inside the cave.They didn't hear any calls for help from Ouyang Fei or the others, which proved that strength of the people who came was a few levels higher than theirs. Only then would they not have any opportunity to call for help.It had already been two days since the Golden Fruit Tree event had pa.s.sed. It was possible that those powerful experts had yet to leave and were wandering around the mountain when they happened to meet Fatty Qu and the others\u2026Just when the two of them were making random guesses, the few of them finally reached the cave.\"We're back.\" Fatty Qu's round chubby body appeared at the cave entrance followed by Ouyang Fei and Wei Zi Qi.Seeing that the three of them had no external wounds, the two of them relaxed, asking, \"Are you guys okay?\"\"We\u2026\"Fatty Qu had yet to finish speaking when he was picked up by one of the men from the back and placed behind. After that, some unexpected silhouettes appeared in front of Sima You Yue, causing her to call out in surprise, \"Third brother! Fourth Brother! What are you guys doing here?\"\"Fifth Brother, we heard that you got hurt? Quickly let Third Brother take a look.\" Sima You Ran quickly appeared beside Sima You Yue, wanting to run into her but afraid of hurting her.\"Third Brother, I'm already fine!\" Sima You Yue pulled Sima You Ran's hand as she tried to placate his moodiness.\"Fifth Brother, what is the meaning of this. How did you receive such serious injuries?\" Sima You Le walked over as his eyes filled with worry and anger.\"I'll explain it to you later, okay.\" Sima You Yue said, \"You guys haven't replied me yet, what are you all doing here?\"\"We came here to practice combat!\" Sima You Le said, \"And it just so happened that our two groups ended up in Pu Luo Mountain Range so we ended up together.\"Sima You Yue just realised that apart of the two of them, there were a few other people standing outside the mountain cave. It looked like they were Sima You Ran's schoolmates.\"Enough, say it now, how did you get injured?\" Sima You Ran looked at Sima You Yue, saying, \"Just now, Little Qu already said that every single one of your bones were broken yesterday. How did you end up getting so gravely injured?\"This Fatty Qu, didn't he know that her older brother was a control freak? He still dared to tell him that every single one of her bones were broken!Sima You Yue maliciously glared at Fatty Qu before looking at the five men who were still fainted on the ground, saying, \"It's because of them. They lured us to the territory of a vicious beast. You don't know but there were so many wolves, it terrified us all.\"\"It's because of these people?!\" Sima You Ran glared icily at those men, as if they were already a pile of corpses.\"Mm, that's them!\" Sima You Yue said.\"I'm going to kill them!\" Sima You Le stopped for a moment before standing up, taking out his sword, intending to go over and kill those men.\"Fourth Brother, Fourth Brother, don't be ras.h.!.+\" Sima You Yue pulled on Sima You Le, saying, \"These five men cannot die in your hands.\"\"Why not?\" Everyone was confused.\"Because they're from our academy.\" Sima You Yue explained the entire situation in a moment, however, she left out whatever happened with the Acacia Silk Snake and blamed whatever happened entirely on the Wolf Pack attack that happened earlier.\"Too cruel!\" Sima You Le angrily went and viciously stomped on them a few times.\"Then what do you plan to do?\" Sima You Ran naturally noticed the loophole in whatever Sima You Yue had said. For example, for what reason would she have caught those men, why it was only her and Bei Gong Tang who got injured and so on. However, there were outsiders among them right now so he didn't expose her and went along with whatever she had said when he asked his question.\"Of course it would be to give them a taste of their own medicine.\" Sima You Yue said. \"They placed us within a pack of wolves, so I want them to meet the exact same kind of situation. That we were able to survive is only because we were lucky, whether they live or die will depend on their own abilities! Dear older brothers and sisters, you all won't spread this around, right?\"\"Pu Luo Mountain Range was always a place where Spirit Beasts ran rampant, Encountering a few Spirit Beasts is something that happens all the time.\" A lady wearing a red dress said.\"Yeah.\"The others also agreed. Seeing the rage in their eyes, she figured that they were also feeling unbridled disgust towards the actions of those few people.\"Since you want to do things this way, then go ahead.\" Sima You Ran ruffled Sima You Yue's hair, turning it into a complete mess.Sima You Yue slapped his hand away, saying, \"Third and Fourth Brother, did you all come to execute a mission? Our mission is already complete and we will return tomorrow. You can go ahead and complete your mission first.\"\"Don't even think about chasing us away.\" Sima You Ran said, \"We already finished doing whatever we needed to do yesterday and were already preparing to return. We can wait for your wounds to heal together.\"\"Ah, this isn't too good, is it? We can't let these other older brothers and sisters wait!\" Sima You Yue said.\"It's okay, another one or two days won't matter.\" Those people said.Sima You Yue could see that her two brothers were the core of their two teams. If the two of them didn't want to leave, the others wouldn't say anything.\"Okay then.\" She buried her head in the pillow. It looked like they weren't going to leave on their own accord.Those few people knew that Sima You Yue and her brothers had just met and would definitely have things to talk about so they left first. Immediately, Bei Gong Tang also found an excuse to get Ouyang Fei and the others to bring her away.Seeing that there was n.o.body else left in the cave, Sima You Ran finally asked, \"Say it, how did you get those injuries?\"\"I just knew I wouldn't be able to hide it from you. See, Fourth Brother didn't even notice anything was off.\" Sima You Yue pursed her lips and said.\"You still dare to say it!\" Sima You Ran slapped Sima You Yue's head, \"If it wasn't for the fact that there were others around, I would have given you two slaps long ago. You actually lied even to your older brothers!\"\"Come on, it's not like I lied to you on purpose!\" Sima You Yue looked at Sima You Le with grief, hoping that he would help speak on her behalf. However, Sima You Le didn't stand on her side this time and had actually turned his head to the side, refusing to look at her at all!\"Okay, tell us honestly how on earth you got those injuries!\" Sima You Ran said with a serious face.\"Okay\u2026\" Sima You Yue told them about the encounter with the wolf pack and the Acacia Silk Snake. After that, she looked at Sima You Ran and the rest pitifully, \"Your team members were there just now so I couldn't let them know I was female and could only talk nonsense! Also, this isn't considered nonsense since they were really the ones who caused the incident with the wolves.\"\"These people!\" Sima You Le clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white; only then did he manage to stop himself from impulsively going over to kill them.\"So you're saying that your team members all know that you're female?\" Sima You Ran's attention was focused on this point. If they revealed this, there would definitely be trouble.\"This Brother, you can relax. They won't tell anyone.\" Sima You Yue said, \"I trust them.\"\"Mm, I believe that you won't do anything reckless anymore.\" Sima You Ran said, \"Recuperate today, tomorrow we'll head for Salt City. Grandfather is still there waiting for us.\"\"Grandfather hasn't gone back yet?\" Sima You Yue asked.The moment she said this, she realised that she had made a mistake. However, it was too late. She only saw that Sima You Ran, who was initially looking at her tenderly, was staring at her solemnly again.\"It's over, I won't be able to run this time\u2026\" Sima You Yue grieved in her heart.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

He said that that he would remain in Salt City for a while and to go look for him if we were able to leave this place.\" Sima You Ran said, \"Don't think you'll be able to avoid answering my question. Grandfather didn't say anything about meeting you yesterday, which means that he has no idea you're here. Say it, where did you see Grandfather? Did you secretly run over to s.n.a.t.c.h the Golden Snake Fruit?Seeing how Sima You Ran was acting, Sima You stuffed her head into the people, \"I just went to take a look from a place very very far away, I didn't go there.\"\"You think I believe you?!\" Sima You Ran took one look at Sima You Yue and knew she definitely didn't catch a glimpse from a place very very far away.The moment Sima You Le heard that Sima You Yue actually went to s.n.a.t.c.h the Golden Snake Fruit, he immediately cried out, \"Fifth Bro, how could you go to such a dangerous place? Didn't you know that that item attracted many powerful experts and Spirit beasts? You actually went to watch the fun in such a dangerous place. You really\u2026 if Grandfather knew, see how he would deal with you!The moment she heard what Sima You Le said, she immediately raised her head.\"Third Brother, Fourth Brother, you have to help me keep this a secret, you can't let Grandfather know about this.\" Sima You Yue looked pitifully at the two of them with s.h.i.+ning eyes and began to act cute.If it was the past and she did something like this, she would definitely have felt weird about doing something like this. However, it was probably because she was looking at her relatives right now that she did not feel any inhibitions.\"Humph, it's such a serious matter; how could we possibly help you keep it a secret.\" Sima You Ran chided her with a cold and stern face, \" If something happened to you, how would we feel? How sad would Grandfather be?\"\"I was wrong.\" Sima You Yue sincerely admitted her wrongs.No matter what reason she had, when faced with the concern of her loved one, it would not be legitimate.\"It's good that you know you were wrong!\" Sima You Le saw that she was being scolded by Sima You Ran with a stern and cold face and felt a bit of heartache so he spoke up for her.\"That right, Third Brother, you shouldn't be angry either. I just went to take a little peek because I was curious, I won't do it in the future!\" Sima You Yue looked like extremely earnest, the only thing she didn't do was to slap her chest and pledge.\"Humph!\" Sima You Ran couldn't speak as nicely as Sima You Le and remained as stern faced as before.Sima You Le winked at Sima You Yue and she immediately understood. She pulled on the corner of Sima You Ran's clothes and swayed her body.\"Third Brother, I already know I'm wrong, don't be angry anymore. If you're angry, my little heart trembles and trembles, oh no, my wounds are hurting again.\"\"Fifth Bro, where hurts?\" Sima You Le asked anxiously.\"Sigh, it hurts everywhere.\" Sima You Yue said aggrievedly.\"Enough, I know you're faking it.\" Sima You Ran could not help but look at Sima You Yue. How did this brat end up even more cheeky than before? \"I can keep from telling Grandfather about this, but if you dare to do this kind of things without care for how serious it is, don't talk about not telling Grandfather; I will be the first to punish you!\"When she heard Sima You Ran say this, she knew that the issue was settled. Sima You Yue smiled happily as she said, \"It won't happen next time, okay!\"After she finished speaking, she secretly added another sentence in her heart, \"I won't let you all find out next time!\"If he knew what she was secretly thinking, Sima You Ran would definitely be angered to death.\"Alright, continue to recuperate for today. We'll see how your body is like tomorrow. If it's not possible, we'll wait for one more day. We'll head outside to discuss with them our travel route.\"Sima You Ran left after speaking with Sima You Le trailing behind. He turned around to give Sima You Yue an ok sign, then turned around to leave.Sima You Yue buried her head into the pillow again, crying out in her heart in agony for committing such a low-levelled mistake. However, she felt warm all over because of the that her family had shown her.When Sima You Ran and Sime You Le walked out, Wei Zi Qi was supporting Bei Gong Tang inside. Because of her ident.i.ty, the relations.h.i.+ps between the five of them had gone through some subtle changes. At the very least, Bei Gong Tang would talk to her about female things.Although she was just lying on the bed, her wounds were healing at a speed visible to the naked eye.The next day, for the sake of not holding anyone back, Sima You Yue didn't care how painful her bones were, she persisted on travelling. Sima You Ran couldn't convince her and could only let them begin travelling.However, before they left the mountain Range, there were still a few things they had to settle.\"You Yue, should we wake them up now?\" Fatty Qu asked.\"Mm. If they don't wake up then this wouldn't be considered fair!\" Sima You Yue took out a medicine bottle and threw it to Fatty Qu. \"Put this under their nose and let them smell it.\"Fatty Qu followed her instructions and those who smelled what was in the medicine bottle woke up quickly.\"Sima You Yue?!\" Wu Tian, the group leader, saw Sima You Yue and his initially dazed brain immediately woke up.\"Still able to recognise me, looks like he's awake.\" Sima You Yue said, \"He hasn't eaten for a few days, he must be much weaker now right?\"\"What do you plan to do?\" Shou Hou saw the evil grin on Sima You Yue's face and suddenly felt a wave of gooseb.u.mps, a chill emanating from his heart.\"Not doing anything, just learning a few things from you all.\" Sima You Yue said, \" This antidote will only be given for a short while and won't be able to help you recover your strength so the timing is just right. Fatty, be careful not to get any of it on your body, or else, don't blame me for throwing you aside without a care.\"Fatty Qu caught the bottle and poured a bit onto the bodies of those men and said, \"Relax, I won't be that stupid.\"When all five men had been sprinkled with the powder, everyone made to walk out of the cave.\"Wha..What have you done to us?\" An unknown fear gripped his heart as Wu Tian shouted at Sima You Yye.The others had already left as Fatty Qu turned around, saying, \"Didn't we already say we wanted to learn from you? Right now, you can all properly feel what it's like to be graced by Spirit Beasts.\"After he finished speaking, he didn\u2019t turn around again and left.Not long after Sima You Yue left, quite a few Spirit Beasts had smelled the scent that was coming from inside the cave went inside. When they saw Wu Tian and his group of men, they charged crazily at them and quickly finished the men off cleanly, where not even bones remained.\"You Yue, what did you scatter on their bodies?\" Sima You Ran came beside Sima You Yue and asked, as they had left quite a distance from where the cave was but they were still able to hear Wu Tian and his men's final cries of agony.\"Nothing much, it\u2019s just some medicinal powder that attracts Spirit Beasts.\" Sima You Yue answered..\"Why do you have something like that?\" Sima You Ran asked\"Bought it before we came.\" Because outsiders were present, Sima You Yue randomly said something.Although these people were her older brother's teammates, she was not acquainted with them and had no plans to let them know about herself.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

After staying in the mountain for so long, it feels like we've turned into Spirit Beasts ourselves!\" Fatty Qu laughed.\"You look like a barbarian to me, it\u2019s only right for you to remain in this mountain!\" Sima You Yue joked.\"What do you mean I\u2019m a savage, hmph hmph, I, this little Lord, am longing for the bustling of our capital world. If I remain on this mountain for half a year to a year, I will definitely go crazy.\" Fatty Qu said.\"Sigh, you, it\u2019s because your heart is not at peace that Ouyang Fei and Bei Gong Tang would be so much stronger than you.\" Sima You Yue slapped him on the head as she sighed.Thinking about how he really was the weakest amongst the five of them, Fatty Qu looked ashamed as he shrugged his shoulders, not refuting what Sima You Yue said. However, he secretly swore in his heart that he definitely couldn\u2019t lag behind Sima You Yue. It was precisely because he made this promise that he became more dedicated in his cultivation later on, increasing it by leaps and bounds.Their journey was smooth and uneventful. When they encountered a few Spirit Beasts, it wasn\u2019t too much trouble when they relied on the strength of ten over of them.Three days later, riding on the backs of Spirit Beasts hurrying on their journey, they finally left the Pu Luo Mountain Range.The Spirit Beasts continued to carry them towards Salt City. Sima You Yue sat on the back of Sima You Ran's Spirit Beast as she turned her head back to gaze at the connecting hill tops under the blanket of the blue sky, her heart filled with emotions.Bei Gong Tang sat on the back of Wei Zi Qi's Spirit Beast and when they saw Sima You Yue look back, they turned back as well and were also filled with similar feelings.n.o.body ever expected that their expedition this time would cause them to encounter so many things. So many times they brushed past death but they worked together and saved each other, showing care and concern. It caused them, who had initially come together only to fulfil the mission, to turn into a group of true comrades bounded together through life and death.Sima You Yue saw that Bei Gong Tang and the others had also turned their heads, and she turned her gaze upon at their backs. They happened to turn around and the three of them looked at each other, smiling in understanding.Sensing their earlier interaction, Ouyang Fei and Fatty Qu looked over as well. Everyone looked at each other and joy was reflected in their tired eyes. A warmth filled each of their hearts, allowing them to find an irreplaceable kind of warmth within this team.The Spirit Beasts very quickly brought the group of people to Salt City.When they arrived at Salt City, they kept their Spirit Beasts and directly headed towards the inn that Sima Lie was staying at.The innkeeper was at the counter counting the money when he heard a few people enter. He raised his head, smiled and said, \" Oh, customers, really very sorry but our little inn has already been completely rented out and currently has no vacancies. Do you all want to go to other places to take a look?\"\"We came to look for someone.\" Sima You Ran said.\"Looking for someone? That customer didn\u2019t say that there would be anyone coming to look for them!\" The innkeeper said with doubt, \"Sorry to the group of you but those people had instructed me before that unless they specifically said so, they were to be undisturbed.\"At this moment, a few guards came downstairs. When they saw Sima You Ran and the others, the quickened their steps and came down, walking towards and bowing, saying \"Third Young Master, Fourth Young Master, Fifth Young Master, you all are finally here.\"\"Shao Ling, where's Grandfather?\" Sima You Ran asked.\"The Master is upstairs, we were just preparing to go back to the Imperial Capital. I came down to check out of our rooms.\" Shao Ling replied.Shao Ling was the personal bodyguard that followed Sima Lie. Seeing that his expression was off , Sima You Yue asked, \" Could it be that something happened to Grandfather\"Shao Ling didn\u2019t think that Sima You Yue would be so sensitive and guess it in a moment. He was stunned for a while before he said, \"It's true. The General has gotten injured and we are preparing to bring him back to the Imperial Capital to look for Great Master s.h.i.+.\"\"Go back to look for him? That means that Grandfather must be seriously injured?\" Sima You Yue's heart was in shock, \"What happened to Grandfather?\"\"We are unsure of it ourselves. The General didn\u2019t let us follow him when he went out yesterday. After that, he returned this morning with serious injuries and has already been unconscious for half a day. The medical doctors that we brought were at their wits end and it was useless when we called for Pill Masters as well. That\u2019s why we planned on going to the Imperial Capital to look for Great Master s.h.i.+. Shao Ling replied.\"Don't check out yet, I\u2019m going to take a look at Grandfather first.\" After Sima You Yue finished speaking, she ran upstairs.\"Shao Ling, get the innkeeper to arrange rooms for everyone.\" Sima You Ran ran upstairs as well after he finished speaking.Sima You Le didn\u2019t say anything as he dashed upstairs after them.Shao Ling didn\u2019t know why Sima You Yue didn\u2019t let them check out, but since Sima You Yue had instructed it, he turned towards and the innkeeper and said, \"Arrange rooms for everyone.\"He headed upstairs as well after speaking.Sima You Yue didn\u2019t ask which room Sima Lie was in. When she arrived upstairs, she simply ran towards the room that was guarded heavily by guards.\"Fifth Young Master.\" The guards were all shocked when they saw Sima You Yue and wondered what he was doing here. However, Sima You Yue didn\u2019t spend any time on them and directly pushed open the door and entered.Sima You Ran and Sima You Le came upstairs and nodded towards the guards before hurriedly entering the room.This room was precisely the same that Sima You Yue had rented before. She entered the room and saw Sima Lie lying down on the bed.\"Grandfather.\"She ran over and saw that Sima Lie's eyes were shut, his eyebrows furrowed today\u2019s and his lips were constantly trembling as if he was in a lot of pain. There was a black qi hovering above him and looked poisonous at a glanceShe quickly grabbed into Sima Lie's hand and took his pulse.When Sima You Ran and Sima You Le saw Sima You Yue like this, they were stunned. Seeing Sima You Yue take his pulse, they forgot that she had no medical abilities for a moment and opened their mouth to ask, \"You Yue, how is Grandfather?\"Sima You Yue didn\u2019t say anything. After taking his pulse, she put Sima Lie's hand down, saying, \"There is poison wreaking havoc in Grandfather's body. However, it\u2019s not the usual kind of poison.\"Sima You Yue was puzzled. She observed his body for quite a while when she suddenly pulled at his outer robe, revealing his pitch-black chest.\"What, what is this?\" Sima You Le cried out in surprise when he saw the thing on Sima Lie's chest.Furthermore, Mo Sha, who had been recovering his soul under the Golden Snake Fruit Tree, suddenly opened his eyes as they flashed with suspicion.\"So it turns out to be this!\" Sima You Yue saw the black qi around Sima Lie's chest and took a deep breath; her face was incomparably solemn.\"You Yue, this\u2026?\" Sima You Ran looked at Sima You Yue with confusion.\"I kind of know it, I read about it before in a book.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Then do you know how to save Grandfather? If you can\u2019t then we will immediately take a Teleportation Array to the capital.\" Sima You Le said .\"It's too late .\" Sima You Yue shook her head, \"It takes a day to take the Teleportation Array to the capital. If the poisonous air within Grandfather is not purged, he will die in half a day.\"\"What did you say?!\"Sima You Ran and Sima you Le had lost their wits when they heard what Sima You Yue said. It was Sima You Ran who quickly reacted as he held Sima You Yue by her shoulders and said, \"Fifth Bro, since you know what this is, do you know how to counter it?\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

I can only suppress the poison in Grandfather's body for a period of time for now.\"\"How long?\"\"Two days.\" Sima You Yue said, \" We have to find a way to counter the poison within these two days, or else the result will still be the same after these two days.\"\" Okay. First suppress the poison for Grandfather.\" Sima You Le anxiously said.\"Take off Grandfather's upper robes.\" Sima You Yue nodded towards the two of them and said.Shao Ling just happened to walk in and she instructed him, \" Tell the innkeeper to send up a jug of strong wine as well as a new piece of cloth.\"Shao Ling saw Sima You Le stripping off Sima Lie's clothes and didn\u2019t know what Sima You Yue wanted to do, however, he still promptly called for the guards guarding the door to do what Sima You Yue had instructed.The strong wine and new clothes were quickly sent up and Sima You Le had already finished taking off Sima Lie's upper robes.Shao Ling pa.s.sed the wine jug over and motioned for the guard to exit before closing the door.\"Fifth Young Master, the strong wine is here.\" Shao Ling held the wine jug as he walked over..Sima You Yue took the cloth and let Shao Ling open the wine jug before taking the wine jug herself and pouring the wine over the cloth. When the cloth had been completely soaked by the strong wine, she used the cloth to wipe the top half of Sima Lie's body.After she had wiped it three times, she threw the cloth to the corner and, with a thought, a delicate box appeared in front of everyone.She opened the box and took out a needle from inside and quickly stuck it into Sima Lie\u2019s body. After that, she stuck a second and a third\u2026Sima You Le and the three of them stared as Sima You Yue stabbed Sima Lie's body full of needles and were all extremely shocked. They had no idea what function these needles had.After half an hour had pa.s.sed, Sima You Yue's forehead was completely beaded with sweat. After she had placed in the final needle, she heaved a sigh of relief.\"Fifth Bro, is it done?\" Sima You Ran asked when he felt Sima You Yue relax.Sima You Yue took her sleeve to wipe the sweat off her forehead and said, \" Mm, it has been suppressed for the time being.\"Sima You Yue had needed to be careful at every single step and could not make a single mistake. As a result, the pressure was immense and it was only at the end when she had successfully finished the acupuncture that she had managed to suppress the poison and contain it at Sima Lie's chest area.\"The ones on Grandfather's face have completely subsided!\" Sima You Le said excitedly as he saw Sima Lie's face.Sima You Ran and Shao Ling looked over and the black qi on his face had truly disappeared, returning him to his usual color. However, because he was injured, he was completely pale.\"Fifth Bro, how did you accomplish this?\" Sima You Ran asked.\"I used needles to block Grandfather's acupoints.\"\"Acupoints? What is that?\" Sima You Le raised his eyebrows in question. \"Also, Fifth Bro, when did you learn medicinal arts?\"\"I always knew them, you just never knew.\" Sima You Yue said, \"Grandfather is currently unable to move so you all have to remain here to watch over him. I\u2019m going back to my room to rest for a bit and see whether I can think of any ideas.\"\"Mm, you go ahead and rest then.\" Sima You Le said.Sima You Yue kept the remaining needles into her interspatial ring then turned to leave.Sima You Ran looked at her retreating figure as his eyes flashed with puzzlement.Sima You Yue came to the room beside and didn\u2019t care about who had occupied it before. In any case, it was hers now. She locked the door from the inside then teleported her body into the Spirit Pearl. She wanted to take a look and see whether the medical skills in here would be able to help her in any way. She never thought that she would see Mo Sha the moment she entered.\"Mo Sha, what are you doing here? Weren\u2019t you beside the Golden Snake Fruit tree?\"\"The Black Qi on your grandfather's chest\u2026 what does it look like?\" Mo Sha directly asked.Sima You Yue knew that Mo Sha could enter and leave the Spirit Pearl as he pleased, and she had already guessed earlier that he would know about the things happening outside, so she wasn\u2019t surprised when he knew about Sima Lie's condition.She thought for a bit before saying, it looks like a bird claw but it\u2019s six-toed.\" Sima You Yue said.\" Six-toed, I knew it.\" Mo Sha muttered.Sima You Yue saw Mo Sha's reaction and asked, \"You know it?\"\" That\u2019s not a poison, its Devil Qi.\" Mo Sha said.\"What? Devil Qi?!\" Sima You Yue's eyes widened, \" Didn\u2019t you say people from the Devil Clan remained in the Devil Realm? How come there\u2019s Devil Qi on Grandfather's body?\"\"How am I supposed to know? I haven't gone back in years.\" Mo Sha said, \"You can just wait until your Grandfather wakes up before asking him.\"\"Since it's Devil Qi, do you have any way to save my Grandfather?\" Sima You Yue looked expectantly at Mo Sha.Mo Sha had never seen Sima You Yue look at him with that kind of gaze before. In the past, No matter whether she was threatening him or thanking him, her gaze always contained a hint of estrangement. However, the way she was currently looking at him right now carried a trace of dependence. This caused him, who had never been depended upon before, to feel weird.\"How about it? Do you have any ideas or not?\" Sima You Yue urged when she saw that Mo Sha was not speaking.Mo Sha pushed aside the unknown feeling in his heart and said, \"I do have an idea and it is simple. However , after getting rid of the Devil Qi, your Grandfather's body will receive damage.\"\"Then what should we do?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"You just need an Ultimate Sovereign Pill.\" Mo sha said.\"Ultimate Sovereign Pill? What kind of pill is that? Which rank?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"A pill that helps one\u2019s body to recover. Fourth rank.' Mo Sha said.\"Fourth Rank?!\" Sima You Yue was stupefied, where was she supposed to find a Fourth Ranked Ultimate Sovereign Pill right now. \"If it\u2019s really impossible, then we just have to help Grandfather preserve his life for now. When I\u2019m stronger I will just find a way to help him recover!\"\"I took a look, the Spirit Pearl has the ingredients necessary to make the Ultimate Sovereign Pill.\" Mo Sha said.Sima You Yue raised her head and looked at him, blinking her eyes, \"That\u2019s right, you know alchemy. Help me alchemize an Ultimate Sovereign Pill, okay?\"\"If you want me to lend a hand, that's fine. But you have to agree to one condition.\" Mo Sha said.Sima You Yue was stunned. After that, she immediately said solemnly, \" If you are able to save my grandfather, I promise you that when I am able to dissolve our contract, I will dissolve it.\"Mo Sha didn\u2019t think that Sima You Yue would know what he was thinking. But just thinking about the connection that they had, it wasn\u2019t strange for her to know.However, he didn't feel that it wasn\u2019t good. It was just that for someone with his ident.i.ty, how could he be bound by a person for eternity?!\"Since you know, then there\u2019s no need for me to say it. I can refine an Ultimate Sovereign Pill but you have to inject your spirit power at the end. If not, without using Devil Qi, that pill will directly claim his life.\" Mo Sha said.\"I know. Then when should we begin? \" Sima You Yue asked.\"We can start after you've rested.\" Mo Sha said, \" I can also make use of that time to prepare the ingredients.\"\"Mm.\" Sima You Yue nodded as she walked to a place beside the Golden Snake Fruit tree and sat down.This Golden Snake Fruit Tree was very useful in aiding the soul in recuperation and was able to help her recover her vitality.When she felt that she had more or less recovered, Mo Sha appeared in front of her, saying, \"The ingredients have already been prepared. We can begin. The Spirit Power needed for these fifth Ranked pills are not low, you have to properly prepare. These pills are ones that I just refined; they help to recover one\u2019s Spirit Power. You have dark qi inside you so even if you use it, there won\u2019t be much of a difference.\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

She never thought that a random pill that Mo Sha could refine to recover one's Spirit Power was already third rank. In that case, what was his rank as an Alchemist?\"Since you are able to refine pills yourself, why do you still need me to help you?\" Sima You Yue thought about how he wanted her to help him refine pills and was filled with confusion.\"In the end, I\u2019m just a soul. I can still stand it if it\u2019s just refining these few low ranked pills. But if the pill is a high rank then I don\u2019t have enough Devil Qi to fuse the pills.\"\"So this is the case.\" She kept the pill and stood up. \" Let\u2019s begin.\"Mo Sha couldn\u2019t tell what Sima You Yue was thinking now as he brought her to the Alchemy room.Little Spirit was already inside waiting. He knew that she was anxious right now and merely looked over at her without saying anything.\"I\u2019m going to begin. Wait for me to give the signal to begin then you should also start to pour in your Spirit Power. If I don\u2019t ask you to stop, you can\u2019t stop or else it will end up worthless. If you don\u2019t have enough Spirit Power, please use those pills.\" Mo Sha reminded her in a rare moment of kindness.\"Mm.\" Sima You Yue nodded as she cast her gaze onto the the Pill Furnace.Although this was a time for her to refine a pill for Grandfather, it was also a good time to learn. Watching others perform alchemy was a good time to notice one\u2019s own shortcomings in the pursuit of self improvement.Mo Sha was also thinking the same thing, so while he was refining, he intentionally slowed down the process in order to let Sima You Yue understand as she looked. However, the consequence was that something that initially only needed 3 to 4 hours, was extended by an entire hour.\"Begin.\" Mo Sha said.Sima You Yue also guess that it was around the time to fuse the pill so she had made preparations beforehand. The moment Mo Sha called out, she condensed her Spirit Power outside her body and poured it into the Pill Furnace.In order for the Pill to contain Spirit Power, she needed to send in the Spirit Power quickly. As a result, she quickly felt that the Spirit Power in her body was insufficient.Just when her Spirit Power was almost drained dry, she took out the pill that Mo Sha had given her and ate it. The pill very quickly showed it's usefulness once it entered her body, as she felt the empty tank of Spirit Power fill to the brim once again . She didn\u2019t know whether the power came from the pill itself or pulled from the surroundings.Mo Sha was initially worried that Sima You Yue wouldn\u2019t be familiar with her Spirit Power, and would end up breaking off the stream of power, however, seeing her continuously send in a uniform stream of power, he cast her a look of approval.After she had eaten two pills, she held on for another ten or so minutes more before Mo Sha shouted for her to stop. Sima You Yue hurriedly returned her hands to her side and her entire person was depleted of energy as she sat on the floor.Mo Sha continued refining, waiting for the pill to be complete before extinguis.h.i.+ng the fire and retrieving the pill.A golden coloured pill appeared in front of Sima You Yue and that s.h.i.+ning golden colour was like the colour of hope to her.\"You should stay here properly to rest and recover a bit of your Spirit Power.\" Mo Sha said.Sima You Yue nodded, crossing her legs right there as she meditated. The Spirit Power in her body was currently completely drained as she absorbed Spirit Power from the surroundings, which quickly entered the empty s.p.a.ce in her body.Feeling the Spirit Power in her body fill up once again, the feeling of control returned to her once again.Sima You Yue could feel that the Spirit Power had some kind of movement as the outside Spirit Power was still flowing into her body ceasingly.\"This feeling\u2026 could it be I\u2019m about to advance in rank?\" Sima You Yue talked to herself, 'since that\u2019s the case, why don\u2019t I try and see if I can advance to the sixth rank.\"Just as she was prepared to just charge straight into it, Little Spirit appeared in the Alchemy room and interrupted her cultivation.\"What\u2019s wrong?\" Sima You Yue looked at Little Spirit and asked.\"I\u2019m just helping you make sure you don\u2019t waste your time and energy.\" Little Spirit said, \"you will never be able to advance in rank while in the Spirit Pearl. No matter how much Spirit Power you absorb, you will merely store it within your body.\"\"Can\u2019t increase in rank? Why?\" Sima You Yue didn\u2019t understand.\"Because this place doesn\u2019t have the Heavenly Law.\" Little Spirit said.\"Heavenly Law? What\u2019s that?\" Sima You Yue continued to ask.\"It\u2019s not too convenient for me to tell you what that is, figure it out yourself.\" Little Spirit said, \"Since you can\u2019t increase in rank here, why don\u2019t you go outside. Who knows, you may be able to succeed there.\"Thinking of Sima Lie's condition, she also felt that she didn\u2019t want to delay here anymore so she stood up and prepared to go look for Mo Sha. However, when she opened the door, she found him standing in front of the door with his hands clasped behind his back, looking at the sky outside.\"Done?\" Mo Sha turned around and asked.\"Mm, let\u2019s go.\" Sima You Yue said.Mo Sha nodded and Sima You Yue walked out first.Inside Sima Lie's room, Sima You Ran and Sima You Le were looking at Sima Lie worriedly.\"Third Brother, the doctors and Alchemists that we called over all said that they didn\u2019t know what to do. How is Fifth Bro going to save Grandfather?\" Sima You Le said.Sima You Ran thought of Sima You Yue's retreating back and said, \"I don\u2019t know either. Right now, we are just hoping that he has thought of a way. We hope that he really has an idea\u2026\"Sima You Le felt that the things Sima You Ran said were strange but he couldn\u2019t pinpoint what exactly.Shao Ling knocked on the floor twice and pushed it opened to enter, saying to the two of them, \"Third Young Master, Fourth Young Master. Fifth Young Master appears not to be in the house.\"\"Fifth Bro isn\u2019t in the house?\" Sima You Le said disbelievingly, \"If he isn\u2019t in the house then where is he?\"\"This subordinate went to knock on Fifth Young Master's door but there was no response.\" Shao Ling said.\"It has almost been an entire day since Fifth Bro went back; now that Grandfather is only left with one day, where could he have gone at this time?\" Sima You Le said worriedly.\"I went out to look for something. \" Sima You Yue suddenly appeared at the door, giving the three of them a shock.\"Fifth Bro, have you thought of a way to save Grandfather?\" Sima You Ran asked.Sima You Yue nodded, saying, \"Thought of it. However, I need absolute silence. Can you all go out for a moment?\"Sima You Le and Sima You Ran exchanged glances; they had no idea what Sima You Yue wanted to do.\"Rest a.s.sured, I will definitely save Grandfather.' Sima You Yue a.s.sured them, \"I won\u2019t let anything happen to Grandfather.\"Sima You Ran got up and came close to Sima You Yue, wanting to pat her head. However, he stopped halfway and put his hand down, saying, \"We will be waiting for you outside.\"Sima You Yue nodded and Sima You Ran saw a strange glint in her eyes and it was if he understood something. It caused him to wonder whether or not she had already become aware of her real ident.i.ty.\"Fifth Bro, we'll entrust Grandfather to you!\" Sima You Le saw that Sima You Ran was leaving and left along with him.Sima You Yue turned to close the door and looked at the few of them who were outside, saying, \"Don\u2019t worry. Grandfather has cared for me so much that it\u2019s my turn now to repay him.\"After saying this, she closed the door.Sima You Le watched Sima You Yue's behavior and exclaimed, \"Fifth Bro has really grown up!\"Sima You Ran looked at the tightly closed door and was speechless towards what\u2019s Sima You Le had said.Did she really grow up? Or\u2026 did she change into an entirely different person\u2026?Inside the house, Sima You Yue came to Sima Lie's bedside and with a thought, Mo Sha appeared beside her.Because there were people outside the house, Sima You Yue could not speak. She used the connection they had a result of their contract to communication with Mo Sha.\"Mo Sha, let\u2019s begin\u2026\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

When he saw the claw shape on Sima Lie's chest, he signalled for her to let him eat the Ultimate Sovereign Pill and then to keep the needles that were on his body.Sima You Yue did what he said and took out the Ultimate Sovereign Pill, placing it in his mouth. It was only after seeing him swallow the pill that she kept the needles before retreating to one side.Mo Sha stretched out his right hand and placed it on Sima Lie's chest, as a circle of black fog slowly dispersed from his palm.Sima You Yue stared at him anxiously as she didn\u2019t know how he was going to expel the Devil Qi from Sima Lie's body.Mo Sha really did as he pleased. The Devil Qi from Sima Lie's body acted as if it had met its natural enemy and tumbled about chaotically. The six-toed claws were as if alive as they began to move incessantly.Sima You Yue was stunned by the events happening in front of her. She initially thought that it was some simple Devil Qi and never expected that it would actually be alive.Seeing the Devil Claw fight back, Mo Sha snorted coldly as he increased his strength and that Devil Claw was unceremoniously and unwillingly dragged out from Sima Lie's body.\"Zi zi-\"As the Devil Claws left Sima Lie's body, they released high pitched squeals that sounded similar to eat squeaks.\"Just a mere little six-toed devil mouse, still hoping in vain to take root here and challenge me!\" The Devil Qi in Mo Sha's hand caught hold of the Devil Claw as a single gaze caused it to shake like a leaf.Mo Sha used a bit of strength and that Devil Claw was transformed into a light black mist and was completely engulfed by the black mist in his hand.\"Done just like this?\" Sima You Yue asked as she watched Mo Sha retrieve his own Devil Qi.Mo Sha nodded as he teleported back into the Spirit Pearl.Sima You Yue turned around and helped Sima Lie take his pulse. She felt that his body had been eroded by the Devil Qi by quite a bit. If they had simply expelled the Devil Qi, he would definitely have forfeited quite a bit of his strength.However, it was good that they had the Ultimate Sovereign Pill which slowly recovered the areas in his body that had been eroded away. She reckoned that he wouldn\u2019t have received much damage to his strength by the time they waited for him to regain consciousness .When she had confirmed that there was nothing wrong with Sima Lie, Sima You Yue's anxious heart gradually calmed down. She came to the door, took a deep breath, opened it and smiled at the anxious people who were waiting outside for her.\"Third Brother, Fourth Brother, it\u2019s done.\"Sima You Le was anxiously pacing around the room. When he saw Sima You Yue come out, he dashed in front and grabbed hold of her shoulders, asking, \"Fifth Bro, Grandfather is okay?\"\"Luckily, I did not fail my mission.\" Sima You Yue smiled as she stepped out of the way for Sima You Ran and Sima You Le who dashed straight in. It was only after they saw that the black qi had already disappeared before they calmed down.\"Fifth Bro, this time is really all thanks to you.\" Sima You Le patted Sima You Yue on the shoulders as he said.'I just happened to chance upon it in an ancient book.\" Sima You Yue said.\"No matter what you said, this is really all due to your efforts.\" Sima You Ran said, \" When will Grandfather regain consciousness?\"\"Grandfather\u2019s body has been wounded by that Devil Creature and is recovering right now he should wake up tomorrow.\"\"Devil Creature?\" Sima You Ran knitted his eyebrows. How could a Devil Creature appear here?\"Mm. According to what I know, Devil Creatures are all in the Devil Realm. I don\u2019t know how Grandfather encountered a Devil Creature and even got wounded.\" Sima You Yue said, \"We have to wait for Grandfather to wake up before finding out.\"\"Mm. Wait for Grandfather to wake up before asking him.\" Sima You Ran nodded.\"Third Brother, Fourth Brother, you all have taken care of Grandfather for a whole day, you both should rest. You can just leave it to me.\"\"Okay, then take care of Grandfather well.\" After an entire day of anxiousness and worry, Sima You Le was truly feeling exhausted.\"We\u2019ll just be next door. Remember to call us when Grandfather wakes up.\" Sima You Ran exhorted.\"Mm, relax, I will.\" Sima You Yue said at Sima Lie's bedside and waved her hands at the two of them.Sima You Le left first, followed by Sima You Ran. When the closed the door, the turned back to look and saw that Sima You Yue was sitting at the bedside, watching Sima Lie. She carefully helped him to wear his clothes as the corners of her lips curved slightly upwards.When she was the only one left in the house, she contacted Mo Sha who was in the Spirit Pearl.\"Mo Sha, what kind of Devil Creature is the six-toed mouse?\"\"It is merely the lowest ranked Devil Beast in the whole Devil Realm.\" Mo Sha said indifferently.\" Since it\u2019s a Devil Creature, why did it appear in Dong Chen?\"\"There is definitely something strange about this.\" Mo Sha pondered about it for a moment, saying, \"Devil Creatures live their entire lives in the Devil Realm. More accurately, they are confined to the Devil Realm. Now that they have appeared here, it just shows that they have found an exit and have wandered here.\"What if large groups of people from the Devil Clan come?\" Sima You Yue thought of how even the lowest levelled six-toed mouse could cause Sima Lie to end up this way and didn\u2019t even dare of think of what would happen if large groups of people from the Devil Clan came over. It would be likely that the entirety of the living creatures on the continent would be completely exterminated!\"You can relax, what you\u2019re thinking of won\u2019t happen. At the very least, not right now.\" Mo Sha sneered when he sensed what Sima You Yue thought.\"Why?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"Didn't I just tell you? The Devil Clan has been confined to the Devil Realm. Since its being confined, how would large groups of people from the Devil Clan leave? Even if there was an exit, the Devil Clan would never choose to come to the Yi Lin continent.\"\"Why not?\"\"Because of the Heavenly Law.\"Talking about the Heavenly Law again!This was the second time that Sima You Yue had heard about this but she had no idea what it was.\"Still don\u2019t understand.\" Sima You Yue shook her head.\"I'll explain it like this.\" Mo Sha said, \" Because the standard of the Yi Lin continent is too low and it\u2019s strength is too weak, for the sake of intercontinental peace, those things are restricted to the higher ranked places and can\u2019t come to this place to wreak havoc. The Heavenly Law will naturally limit their powers, allowing them to only display powers equivalent to the highest power here.\"Taking a Saint Ranked person for example, he will only be able to to display powers of a Spirit Warrior, correct?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"Right.\" Mo Sha said. \"Because it\u2019s small and weak, it is protected by Heavenly Law. Furthermore, the barrier between Devil Realm and Yi Lin continent is the thickest. As a result, those guys won\u2019t release these guys and choose to come here. Even if they did come, they wouldn\u2019t reap much benefits. They won\u2019t waste their time.\"Although it made her slightly upset that he said this place was the weakest one, hearing this meant she didn\u2019t have to worry that the Devil Clan would come here and hurt her family.\"Furthermore, the Devil Clan is not as powerful as you imagine.\" Mo Sha said after pondering for a while.\"Grandfather is a Spirit Saint but couldn\u2019t defeat a single normal Devil beast from the Devil Realm, isn't it considered powerful?\" Sima You Yue didn\u2019t believe it.\"These six-toed mice have their own special traits. Furthermore, your Grandfather probably only fell prey to it because he received a sneak attack. Also, it is only you all of the Light attribute that happen to clash with them. If you met other Devil Beasts, your grandfather would not be without the ability to battle.Grandfather was sneak attacked? Sima You Yue looked at Sima Lie. What did he go out to do yesterday that even without talking about how he received such a serious injury, he had been sneak attacked by a Devil Creature. Since people from the Devil Realm couldn\u2019t come to this world, who was it that was using these Six-toed Mice and why did they want to hurt Grandfather?\"Grandfather, you have to wake up quickly\u2026\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

She moved a chair over and placed it on the bedside, crossed her legs and sat on it as she began to practice her soul arts.On the morning of the second day, the warm sunlight streamed into the house.Sima Lie slowly opened his eyes. When he saw the sun s.h.i.+ning on Sima You Yue's body, he saw a kind of dazzling countenance.After cultivating for an entire night, all the remaining exhaustion from yesterday was completely swept away. Sima You Yue let out a long yawn before gently opening her eyes.\"Grandfather, you\u2019re awake?!\" When she saw that Sima Lie was looking at her, Sima You Yue was so excited that she almost jumped off the chair.Sima Lie nodded as he looked warmly at her. Thinking that his previous circ.u.mstance must have scared her silly.\"You Yue, how did you know that I was here?\"\"I met Third and Fourth Brother at the mountains. They said that you were staying here.\" Sima You Yue said, \"Oh, you\u2019re awake so I\u2019m going to call Third Brother and the rest! You gave us all a such a huge scare when you came back wounded and unconscious.\"After she finished speaking, she dashed out and quickly brought Sima You Ran and Sima You Le back with her.\"Grandfather, you\u2019re awake! Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?\"Sima Lie shook his head, indicating that he was feeling fine.\"Shao Ling, get the innkeeper to cook a bit of porridge for breakfast.\" Sima You Yue said to Shao Ling. After thinking for a while, she wasn\u2019t sure whether or not the things cooked here were edible so she changed her mind and said, \"Forget it, I\u2019ll do it myself. Third Brother, you all stay here and take care if Grandfather, I\u2019m going to cook some breakfast.\"Shao Ling hadn\u2019t had time to react before Sima You Yue already walked past him and left.He never thought that Sima You Yue would actually really be able to save Sima Lie. Looking at his master close his eyes once again, he felt his eyes turn slightly red as he knelt down beside the bed, \"General, your subordinate lacked the strength to protect you, causing great harm to fall on General, please punish your subordinate.\"\"Shao Ling, you should stand up. I\u2019m the one who didn\u2019t let you follow me, it\u2019s got nothing to do with you.\" Although Sima Lie had awakened, he was still quite weak so his voice sounded like it lacked strength.\"Shao Ling, you should rise. Grandfather won\u2019t blame you.\" Sima You Ran said.Sima You Le came beside Shao Ling and pulled him up, then turned to Sima Lie and said, \"Grandfather, you don\u2019t know how dangerous your situation was this time. If it wasn\u2019t for Fifth Bro who knew how to save you, I\u2019m afraid you would have\u2026\"He didn\u2019t finish his sentence but everyone understood.'It was You Yue who saved me?\" Sima Lie said with a bit of surprise.Sima You Ran nodded, saying, \"It was. When we came to the lobby, we happened to meet Shao Ling who was going to check out of the rooms, saying that they wanted back to bring you back to look for Great Master s.h.i.+. However, Fifth Bro examined you and said that if we didn\u2019t heal you quickly, you would lose your life in half a day. After that, he used a few needles to suppress and contain the poison in your chest area, delaying it by one or two days.\"\"That\u2019s right, we even invited a few doctors over to take a look but they said they didn\u2019t have any idea. After that, during this period of time, Fifth Bro found a way to save you and then took care of you for an entire night. He said that you would awaken today and this morning you did wake up.\"\"How did You Yue save me?\" Hearing that his favourite granddaughter bad saved him, his heart felt especially glad.\"We don\u2019t know either, she made us all go outside.\" Sima You Le said.Sima Lie thought of the person who had helped her detoxify the poison and wondered, could it be that person who taught her?Up until now, Sima Lie thought that there was a person who was backing Sima You Yue and helping her.Because he was too weak, Sima Lie didn\u2019t say too much. Sima You Ran and the others merely stood beside him and accompanied him.After a moment, Sima You Yue carried in a bowl of porridge. She said to Sima You Ran and the others, \"Third Brother Fourth Brother, I left a bit of porridge in the kitchen. I\u2019ll stay here and feed Grandfather, you all should go ahead and eat something. You all haven\u2019t eaten for a day either.\"'Okay.\" Sima You Ran and the others had eaten the things that Sima You Yue bad cooked before and had fallen in love with those delicacies. Furthermore, they hadn\u2019t eaten for a day and felt especially hungry so everyone went out, leaving Sima Lie in her care.Sima You Yue placed the serving tray onto the table, coming to the bedside saying, \"Grandfather, I\u2019ll help you sit up first and lean against this.\"Sima Lie nodded and relied on her strength to s.h.i.+ft backwards to learn on the back cus.h.i.+on she prepared.Sima You Yue carried the porridge over with both hands and took the ladle to ladle out a single scoop before blowing on it and feeding Sima Lie.\"Grandfather, this is some medicinal porridge, which I\u2019ve infused some medicine into. It will help a lot in healing your body.\" Sima You Yue said while feeding him.With regards to his power, Sima Lie's demands towards his commitments were very little. In the past, he would often accompany Sima You Yue for breakfast and thought just now that it was because of this that she had this habit. It turns out that this was porridge that she had specially cooked and modified for him.\"The things that You Yue makes get more delicious each time.\" The aroma of the porridge was mouth watering. When one ate it, they would feel the weariness of the body slip away, cleansing away the chill from every part of the body. The strength in his body gradually came back.\"If Grandfather likes it, You Yue will often cook it for you to eat!\" Sima You Yue smiled as she said.\"\"Haha, okay!\" Sima Lie heard these heartfelt words, he thought of that man from the past who refused even to go home, and his heart surged with emotion.They said that girls were the most intimate of your cotton padded jacket and his granddaughter was the most intimate of them all.The grandfather-granddaughter pair sat in the warmth of the sun eating a bowl of porridge. After he finished eating it, Sima You Yue even took out a silk handkerchief to wipe his mouth, leaving Sima Lie's heart feeling incomparably sweet.Sima You Yue placed the bowl onto the serving tray on the table and came back, saying, \"Grandfather, do you feel a bit better?\"\"Mm, that medicinal porridge was really not bad. My body feels nice and warm.\" Sima Lie said.\"That\u2019s good.' Sima You Yue said, \"Grandfather, how did you get hurt?\"\"Its nothing much. When I went out, I encountered a few of our old enemies.\"\"Grandfather, don\u2019t fool me.\" Sima You Yue said, \"Devil Creatures wouldn\u2019t appear on the Yi Lin continent. If it was your average enemy, you wouldn\u2019t have been injured by the six-toed mouse, leaving Devil Qi on your body.\"'You said those are Devil creatures?!\" Sima Lie looked at Sima You Yue with a shocked expression that was no less than her own when she first found out.Sima You Yue nodded, saying 'so I\u2019m guessing that the ones who harmed you are no ordinary enemies. Furthermore, Grandfather is so powerful here that n.o.body in the entire Yi Lin continent will be able to hurt you.\"'So the weird creature that attacked me at the end was actually a Devil Creature.\" Sima Lie muttered.\"Grandfather, you\u2019re still not telling me?\" Sima You Yue said.\"Sigh, you have really gotten a lot more shrewd than in the past.\" Sima Lie said, 'It\u2019s just that the person should have already returned, so even if I say it\u2026\"\"Grandfather, since it\u2019s an enemy that actually is after your life, this is probably no ordinary grievance. Just because he has left now doesn\u2019t mean that he won\u2019t return. If you don\u2019t tell us then what are we supposed to do if we meet him in the future?\" Sima You Yue cut Sima Lie off and stunned him into silence.After pondering about it for a moment, Sima Lie let out a long sigh, saying, \"Sigh, this is an old clan feud\u2026\"Note from Misty: If anyone\u2019s confused, because in chinese, he/she sounds the same but are written differently. Hence when in speech, although in chinese, the author could differentiate them but when translated into english, it\u2019s quite obvious so we\u2019re leaving all speeches as \u2018he\u2019 for Sima You Yue cos it\u2019s still supposed to be a secret to others so if others hear a \u2018she\u2019, they might pick up on the clues\u2026 so for now, unless it becomes more obvious in the future, we\u2019re leaving it as \u2018he\u2019. For narration and inner thoughts of those who know her secret, it would then be a \u2018she\u2019. Hope this clears up any fluffy cloud brewing~Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

We can also share a part of your burdens, isn\u2019t that right?\"Sima Lie patted Sima You Yue's hand. This granddaughter of his really was so mature that she caused one\u2019s heart to ache.\"Have you ever thought about it before \u2013 other clans have so many branches yet it is only the Sima Clan that has us as its single branch?\" Sima Lie asked.Sima You Yue pondered about it; it really did seem to be the case. Other clans really had quite a few branches but it was only their Sima Clan that consisted of only Sima Lie and Sima You Yue and her 4 brothers.She never thought much about it at first because the clan in her previous life was not really that powerful. However, thinking about it now, it was really too inconsistent with this world. This was a place where a clan was considered as a gang. There weren\u2019t any others like them who only had a few members.Unless, they really didn\u2019t have any other relatives!\"Grandfather, could it be that the relatives from all our other branches have died?\" Sima You Yue asked.Sima Lie shook his head, saying? \" They didn\u2019t die. It was actually us who were chased out.\"\"Chased out?!\"\"That\u2019s right, Furthermore, we were exiled into this land of captivity.'\"Land of captivity?\" Sima You Yue felt that she had been completely confused by all that Sima Lie was telling her. This was a land of captivity? Were they living inside of a jail?\"Actually, the country of Dong Chen is just a part of Yi Lin continent. You know this, right?\" Sima Lie asked.Sima You Yue nodded her head, this was something she did know.\"Actually, this Dong Chen Country is the land of captivity for the Yi Lin continent.\" Sima Lie said, \"People in this country are those who had been exiled to this place. Those clans who consist of many people are that way because they had been here for a very long time and slowly grew to this state. As for us, it\u2019s because we haven\u2019t been here for long that we have not yet grown.\"\"Grandfather, why do you say that this Dong Chen Country is the land of captivity?\" Sima You Yue asked in confusion.\"Because Dong Chen Country is surrounded by steep mountains that are also filled with highly ranked Spirit Beasts. Those areas make it convenient to use to lock up up this area like a jail, making it so these people can only live in this place. If they wanted to go out, i\u2019m afraid that it would not be long before they perished is the Sofia Mountain Range.\" Sima Lie said, \"Dong Chen Country has very few resources, and is totally different from other places. When compared to other places, this place is like a jail.\"\"So what you\u2019re saying is that we're actually living in a closed off area surrounded by natural geographical barriers.\" Sima You Yue said.Sima Lie nodded\"Then, Grandfather, why were we expelled to this place?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"Because we were framed.\" When Sima Lie said this, he could not help by to tremble. \"Outside, our Sima Clan is considered a Great Clan, however, because your great grandfather was framed, our branch of people had entered for a brief period oftime before we were framed and expelled from the family. The people that framed us also relentlessly chased us to kill us. There was no choice. He could only take us to escape into the Sofia Mountain Range. But Sofia Mountain Range was fraught with peril, and the group of us entered for a short time before we met with dangers from all sides. Even your great grandfather and great grandmother could not escape. With sheer luck, at the very end, I was the only one left. Actually, i had almost been buried like an animal, but I was lucky to have been rescued by my benefactor, who brought me out of Sofia Mountain Range and into Dong Chen Country.Speaking up to this point Sima Lie glanced at Sima You Yue and didn\u2019t tell her that that man was actually her father.\"After that, I started my life anew and worked hard in order to increase my own power. Luckily, my talent was not too bad and slowly thrived and prospered, even achieving a grand position as a great General, governing the peace of Dong Chen Country for his Majesty.\"\"Is the person who harmed you the same one who framed our clan in the past?\"Sima You Yue guessed.\"Mm.\" Sima Lie nodded, \"That was a friend that I had grown up with. I don\u2019t know how but he actually knew about the Golden Snake Fruit and used some unknown method to come to Pu Luo Mountain Range. Initially, our strengths were around the same level but his battle experience could not be compared to mine. Just as I was about to emerge victorious, a long and ugly creature came out from his body and struck me. At that time, I felt that something was not right so I immediately escaped.\"\"Will that person come since he knows that Grandfather escaped?\" Sima You Yue was a little worried.\"I don\u2019t think he will.\" Sima Lie said, \" I know that person\u2019s character, he has always been conceited. Since I had been injured by that Devil creature, to him, I would not live past a day. He would have a.s.sumed that it was impossible for me to survive. Even if he felt that I was lucky enough to survive, he has no idea where I am. Even if he wanted to look for me, Dong Chen Country is not small and he would have to waste a few days. However, he does not have this kind of time to waste.\"\"Why not?\"\"If I didn\u2019t remember it wrongly, there will soon be a grand event happening in the Sima Clan. So, everyone has to go back or else they will be punished. He can\u2019t afford the delay.\" Sima Lie said.\"But at the end of the day, this is still a possibility.\" Sima You Yue thought it over. \"Since he knows you are here, he would be able to guess that you are the head of the family. If the plan to get rid of all witnesses, I only fear that our future days will not be easy to pa.s.s.\"\"I think so too.\" Sima Lie let out a sigh.Sima You Yue saw Sima Lie furrow his eyebrows and smiled at him, saying, \" Grandfather, you don\u2019t have to worry too much. This is just something we\u2019re guessing. Who knows, that person may not have the spare time to come over. It is better for you to heal up properly, we can talk about future things later on.\"Sima Lie saw Sima You Yue's smile and the worried in his heart faded quite a bit. He resolved in his heart that no matter what happened, he would definitely protect her.Sima You Yue waited for Sima Lie to meditate and heal his wounds before leaving the room. As she was leaving the room, the smile on her face disappeared and was replaced by a deep worry.That person could possibly not come down right now, but he was definitely a threat.\"It looks like I have to think of a way to increase my brothers powers, or else we would not have the power to fight back when those people come.\"Sima You Yue teleported into the Spirit Pearl and ran over to take a look at the five remaining Golden Snake Fruits.Right now, these were the only things she could use to increase their powers. However, she was unable to refine any of these pills right now.\"Aside from relying on pills, there are other methods.\" Little Spirit informed her as he appeared at her side.\"There are other ways?\" Sima You Yue looked at Little Spirit and ran over to him, saying, \"Little Spirit, what other ways are there?\"\"Your current fawning look is so ugly.\" Little Spirit looked down on her as he said.Sima You Yue slapped him on the head and yelled, \"What fawning look, say it quickly, what other methods can I use?\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

After he had been hit, he held his head and stared at Sima You Yue.Sima You Yue saw Little Spirit's big round eyes stare at her aggrievedly and immediately felt a bud of affection. She hugged him and patted his head, saying, \"Alright, aren't I just anxious. Say it quickly, what other way is there?\"Little Spirit could feel Sima You Yue's affection and after he heard what she said, frowned and said, \"You're so stupid; Pills can increase their inner strength but you can also increase their external strength, right?\"\"External?\" Sima You Yue stared, \"You're telling me to properare some Contracted Beasts for them?\"Little Spirit nodded, \"You forgot about what Mo Sha gave to you? That's a treasure, you know.\"\"You're talking about the Imperial Beast Art?\" Sima You Yue thought about what he said. Using Imperial Beast Arts to tame Spirit Beasts were something that could increase the strength of both parties during the contract. Her eyes flashed with delight and pinched Little Spirit's face, smiling as she said, \"That's right! I can help my old brothers to prepare some Spirit Beasts for them to form a contract with. Little Spirit, thanks for reminder!\"After speaking, she left a kiss on Little Spirit's face and walked off with a satisfied smile.\"Leaving saliva on my face again!\" Little Spirit shouted at her retreating back in protest but his eyes flashed with happiness.Sima You Yue came outside and Little Roar cried out.\"Yue Yue, did you miss me?\" Little Roar immediately came into Sima You Yue's embrace as he said shamelessly.Seeing her narcissistic Little Roar, Sima You Yue could not help but roll her eyes.How could such a narcissistic Spirit Beast exist?!\"Little Roar, you can make other Spirit Beasts listen to your orders, right?\" Sima You Yue asked.\"Depends on their rank, I guess.\" Little Roar said, \"It's not problem with the majority of them. But if you found a Saint Beast then it's not possible based on my current strength.\"\"No need to order about a Saint Beast.\" Sima You Yue waved her hands. Even if she wanted to control a Saint Beast, there wasn't one available! \"I just need the usual Spirit Beasts; I'm planning on preparing a few Contracted Spirit Beasts for my older brothers. Furthermore, they need to be ones that I can tame so their ranks can't be that high.\"\"Good idea!\" Little Roar said, \"How many do you want? I can go to Pu Luo Mountain Range to catch a few.\"Alright, Little Roar finally admitted that he was catching those Spirit Beasts.\"I have four brothers, so one for each.\" Sima You Yue said, \"Mm, I think it's better for me to accompany you so I can see what ranks I can tame. I'll work hard to help them prepare a few that are higher in rank.\"\"Okay. When do you want to go?\" Little Roar was extremely excited to abduct those Spirit Beasts. He could not wait when he heard that they were going to go and kidnap some Spirit Beasts.\"We can go now. Tomorrow we should be returning to the capital. We'll see whether or not we can rush back by tomorrow morning.\" Sima You Yue said.\"Tomorrow morning? That's definitely impossible.\" Little Roar said, \"You'll only be able to tame just one Spirit Beast but you want to choose a good one. Furthermore, you still want to try and see how high a rank of Spirit Beast you will be able to tame so you will definitely not rush. It will already be good enough if you can get it done in ten days!\"Sima You Yue thought about it. Little Roar was right, it looked like she had to find an excuse to leave.After thinking about it for a long time, she left a letter and hugged Little Roar as she left the inn. She never thought that, the moment she exited the doors of the inn, she would see Sima You Ran waiting at the door.\"Third Brother? What are you doing here?\"Sima You Yue looked at Sima You Yue. That was definitely a familiar countenance, a familiar look, but\u2026\"They're all gone out to walk around, I was waiting here for you.\" Sima You Ran smiled as he said.\"Waiting for me? What for?\" Sima You Yue was a little worried. Could it be that this guy really noticed something?Sima You Yue noticed her feelings reflected in her eyes and walked forward to ruffle her hair, said, \"Are you interested in accompanying your Third Brother for a walk?\"\"Third Brother wants to go window shopping?\"\"No, I have some things I want to talk to you about.\" Sima You Ran said.\"Oh, okay then. Then let's take a walk.\" Sima You Yue said.She had always known that Sima You Ran was the smartest out of her four brothers. She was too different from the way she was in the past. At first, because they were rarely together, he did not notice anything. However, because they had been with each other a lot these few days, he had already realised some things.She lowered her head as she walked with Sima You Ran, thinking about how she would explain about herself. She unknowingly followed him into a tea shop.\"Let's go up and drink some tea.\" Sima You Ran did not ask for Sima You Yue's opinion before directly bringing her upstairs.They let the shopkeeper prepare a private room that was facing the street as Sima You Yue sat opposite Sima You Ran, waiting for him to start talking.\"I heard that the tea here is not bad.\" Sima You Ran poured a cup of tea while speaking.Sima You Yue held the tea in her hands and took a sniff before drinking a mouthful. After that, she placed the cup down and said, \"It's really not bad.\"Sima You Ran watched Sima You Yue taste the tea indifferently. He squinted slightly, \"Fifth Bro never knew how to drink tea in the past. Every time I gave you some nice tea, you would just gulp it down.\"\"This is something that one needs to learn.\" Sima You Yue's heart started to pound; it was starting.\"It's true that this needs to be learnt, but some things can't be done just by learning for a bit. When I saw Fifth Bro save Grandfather, your actions were incomparably skilled. This is not something that you can learn overnight.\" Sima You Ran said.Sima You Yue pondered about it; he was right. Her medical skilled were something that she had gained in a short period of time. That day, when she had helped Sima Lie so acupuncture, she had shown that her skills were not something that was learnt in just three to five days.\"What is Third Brother trying to say?\" Sima You Yue asked directly.Sima You Ran never thought that Sima You Yue would turn from the pa.s.sive recipient into the aggressor. He smiled and said, \"I just wanted to know, who are you? Why do you want to pretend to be my Fifth Bro? Where is My Fifth Bro right now?\"\"I\u2026\"Sima You Yue wanted to speak but Sima You Ran raised his hand, saying, \"Don't say that you are my Fifth Bro. What he was like in the past; what you are currently like\u2026 this is something I know extremely clearly. Saying that you are him, do you think that I will believe it?\"Sima You Yue pondered deeply she she lowered her head and drank a mouthful of tea.\"You better speak honestly or else it won't be hard for me to get rid of you right now. Say it quickly, where is my Fifth Bro?\"Sima You Yue looked up. Seeing that Sima You Ran's were filled with anxiety, she let out a breath, saying, \"Third Brother, it's really me.\"\"Impossible.\" Sima You Ran refuted immediately.\"When I was four years old, I peed the bed and when you asked me to wake up, you happen to see me shoving my wet pants under the bed\u2026\"Sima You Ran's body trembled as he looked directly as Sima You Yue.\"When I was five, you brought me outside the capital, to a little tree to get some honeycombs. We were both attacked by bees and we didn't know how but one of them entered your pants and stung your b.a.l.l.s\u2026\"\"When I was ten, you liked a lady and it was me who encouraged you to go for her but you had given up in the end\u2026\"\"Also, when I was ten years old, it was my first time experiencing that monthly occurrence and you lost your head out of fear, thinking that I was going to die. It was you who helped me to look for that sanitary cloth and that servant girl almost mistakenly thought that you were up to no good\u2026\"\"Cough cough, don't say anymore.\" As she was speaking about that situation, Sima You Ran unknowingly cut Sima You Yue off.Sima You Yue smiled, \"All these are things that we promised that we would keep secret. All these years, no matter how hard it was, I never told anyone. Do you believe me now?\"Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

This was definitely two different people no matter which angle one looked at it.\"But when did you learn medical arts?\"Sima You Yue heard him ask in this way and knew that he had already believed her ident.i.ty. She said, \"Did Grandfather ever tell you about the seal on my body?\"\"Seal?\" Sima You Ran knitted his eyebrows together. It seemed that he had never heard about it. However, hearing her speak like this, it didn't seem to be fake. \"What is that about?\"Sima You Yue shrugged her shoulders saying, \"I don't know either, but when I spoke about it, it gave me memories of my past life. Later on, because of the seal, it sealed a part of my memories as well. Even later on, because I had been hurt, the seal shook a bit a I recovered a bit of my memories. Those medicinal arts were things I knew in my past life.\"\"Memories of your past life?\" Sima You Ran felt that it was a bit outrageous, but this was the best way to explain things right now. \"Don't tell me that your huge change in character as well as you doing these things that you never used to do were things that you knew how to do in your past life?\"Sima You Yue thought of how she was framed and killed by the second in charge of her organisation back on Earth, and she thought of the dream where Simen You Yue experienced heartbreaking pain and her complexion turned bad.She smiled, saying, \"Third Brother, those are already old memories and have already pa.s.sed. It's fine not to talk about them.\"Sima You Yue knew that Sima You Yue had definitely thought of some unhappy things and no longer continued to pursue in his question. The two of them eventually settled into silence.\"Third Brother, this thing, if you are willing to tell our older brothers then please tell them. I won't ask you to keep this a secret.\" Sima You Yue did not wish to continue in silence and said.\"As long as your are our Fifth Bro then all these things are not important.\" Sima You Yue smiled smiled as she said.\"Thank you, Third Brother.\" Sima You Ran looked at Sima You Yue thanked him sincerely.\"I am your older brother and it natural for me to want to protect you. If those guys aren't able to realise it then they are the ones who are not smart. It's not because I didn't tell them.\"\"Pfft. I just knew that Third Brother was the smartest!\" Sima You Yuer smiled and said. \"Third Brother, I want to ask for your help for a certain thing.\"\"What thing?\" Sima You Ran asked.\"I want to go back to Pu Luo Mountain Range, will you be able to take them and leave first? I'm afraid that if I tell Grandfather, he won't let me go.\"Sima You Ran raised his eyebrows, \"Then how do you know that by telling me, I will agree to letting you go? Pu Luo Mountain Range is too dangerous, how could I let you go alone.\"\"Third Brother, the last time I was alone at Pu Luo Mountain Range, I was there for a few months. Did you forget?\" Sima You Yue said, \"There is something urgent that I have to settle. Don't worry, I know how to come back by my myself after I exit the mountain.\"\"But\u2026\"\"I'm not the same me as I was in the past. I'm someone who has memories from two lives and I won't take my life as a joke.\" Sima You Yue said, \"Let's just do it this way, Third Brother, help me to settle Grandfather. I'll take my leave first.\"After she finished speaking, she didn't wait for Sima You Ran to reply and immediately turned around and ran out.Sima You Ran watched Sima You Yue leave and laughed as he shook his head, \"This brat, her impatience is exactly the same as in the past.\"He looked up and looked out the window and happened to see Sima You Yue run out to the main street. She could feel his gaze and turned around to wave at him.\"Third Brother, remember to help me keep this a secret!\"After speaking, she even made a gesture with her hands in the air.Sima You Ran didn't reply her, but in his heart, he was thinking about what to tell Sima Lie once he returned. Since she said that it was a secret, she didn't want anyone to know that she had gone to Pu Luo Mountain Range.Thinking about the gesture that Sima You Yue had just made, Sima You Ran's trust in her increased but a bit. That gesture was something that they would show each other when they asked each other to keep something a secret. For her to do it subconsciously showed that she was really his sister, not an imposter!Even though he was so smart, he never thought about the possibility of switching souls. Furthermore, Sima You Yue really treated the Sima House as her own house, and thought of all them as her own family, and they treated her as the real Sima You Yue.\"Sigh, really a mischievous kid\u2026\" He sighed and stood up to leave, his footsteps much more lighthearted than before.Sima You Yue left the city and called out Ya Guang who let her ride on him to head towards Pu Luo Mountain Range. She didn't know what excuse Sima You Ran would come up with, but she believed that she would definitely be able to lead Sima Lie and the others back home.Ya Guang was definitely not slow and quickly brought them back into Pu Luo Mountain Range.She was very clear about her current mission, which was to catch some Spirit Beasts. Because she didn't know what rank of Spirit Beast she would be able to tame, she would start to tame Spirit Beasts from the lowest rank.She first read the Imperial Beast Art again a few times and committed the methods and important parts to memory. It was only after that she let Ya Guang and Little Roar go and catch a Spirit Beast of First Rank.The first time she used the Imperial Beast Art, Sima You Yue's heart was still nervous. That Low ranked Spirit Beast was small and lay trembling on the ground because of Ya Guang and Little Roar's spirit pressure.Sima You Yue walked over and placed a hand on its head. After that, she followed the Imperial Beast Arts said and transferred her internal spirit energy, working hard to set up a connection between her and the Spirit Beast.Ya Guang and Little Roar stood at a side and watched. Because they didn't dare to say anything and end up distracting her, they only used their contract connection to talk.\"Little Roar, what does it feel like to be tamed?\" Ya Guang said.At that time, he had taken the initiative to ask Sima You Yue to be his master, so he didn't know what it felt like to be tamed.\"How am I supposed to know.\" Little Roar said, \"It's not like I've ever been tamed.\"\"You were also not contracted with taming?\" Ya Guang looked at Little Roar in surprise.\"Hmph hmph, it's all because I didn't know how old I was that time and met that cunning Yue Yue who cheated me. After that, I had no choice but to follow her. Sigh, thinking about it now fills me with bitter tears!\"Ya Guang looked at the way Little Roar was acting and he could only lament a single sentence: he really knew how to act!\"Say, do you think our master will be able to tame the Spirit Beasts?\" Ya Guang saw that Sima You Yue had not succeeded after such a long time and asked with a bit of uncertainty.\"Of course!\" Little Roar would, any time and place, have an att.i.tude of absolute and unwavering trust towards Sima You Yue. \"No matter what, there are only things that Yue Yue doesn't want to do, and nothing that she cannot do!\"It just happened that Sima You Yue had finished taming the Spirit Beast and heard what Little Roar had said so she looked at him speechlessly.This guy, he really had an overflowing amount of trust in her! How could it be that she didn't know when she had become so powerful that she could do whatever she thought of doing!\"Yue Yue, are you done taming?\" Little Roar flew over and asked when he saw that Low ranked Spirit Beast obediently lie on the ground.\"Mm, this is my first time using the Imperial Beast Art and I'm not familiar with it so I went down a few wrong routes and wasted a lot of time.\" Sima You Yue said.What she didn't know was that, it could be because the Imperial Beast Art was strong, or because her mental strength was abnormally strong but the time that she took to tame it was much faster that most Beast Tamer Masters. Especially since it was her first time!If the Beast Tamer Master Guild knew that she had succeeded at her first attempt at taming a beast, they would have raised a storm.Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?

She looked for beasts ranked from first rank to Saint rank andspeedily went through them rank by rank.When it came to her fifth day on the mountain, Sima You Yue hadalready managed to tame a first ranked Saint Beast. On this day, aftershe had tamed the First Ranked Saint Beast, the strength that she hadgained and caused her to break through the Spirit Master\u2019s fifth rank,ascending to the sixth rank.\u201cNever thought that this Imperial Beast Art would really allow aSpirit Beast Master to gain strength while taming beasts.\u201d Afterascending in rank, Sima You Yue felt an increase in strength in herinner body and she felt exceptionally good.\u201cThat\u2019s a given. Or else, why would this Imperial Beast Art becomethe treasure that all Beast Tamer Masters would fall over themselvesfor.\u201d Little Spirit said, \u201cOur ex ex ex master was a Beast Tamer Masterand he said before that he really wanted to obtain the Imperial BeastArt. This was because Beast Tamer Masters wanted to tame Spirit Beastsof higher ranks and needed to spend a lot of time increasing their ownmental strength at the cost of slowing down their own cultivation. Ifthey were able to obtain the Imperial Beast Art, and able to gainstrength while taming beasts, wouldn\u2019t he have easily\u2026\u201d\u201cLittle Spirit, you really have many ex masters.\u201d Sima You Yue brokeout with cold sweat. He had Alchemists and Beast Tamer Masters\u2026 if heever told her that he had a Weaponsmith Master and an Array Master, shewouldn\u2019t even be surprised anymore.\u201cHmph hmph.\u201d Little Spirit snorted from his nose. He decided that hewould no longer tell Sima You Yue that he had past masters from all thedifferent professions.\u201cEnough, let\u2019s continue taming.\u201d Sima You Yue said, \u201cLittle Roar, Ifelt relatively relaxed when I just tamed that first ranked Saint Beastso you should just directly help me find a third ranked Saint Beast,okay.\u201d\u201cOkay, Yue Yue. Wait for me!\u201d Little Roar flew off after speaking andbrought a third ranked Saint Beast back with him not long later.This time when she was taming the Spirit Beast, Sima You Yue feltthat it was a bit draining and had, with much difficulty at the end,managed to tame it.When she finished taming it, she wiped off the sweat on her forehead.It looked like she had overestimated her own strength. However, beingable to tame a Saint Ranked Beast was something that the entire JingChen Country had never seen before.Of course, this was totally dependent on her possession of theImperial Beast Art and the Art of Soul Refinement, coupled with heroverflowing mental fort.i.tude.\u201cYue Yue, do you want a fourth ranked one?\u201d Littler Roar flew over to ask when he saw that she had finished.Sima You Yue shook her head, saying, \u201cTaming that Third Rank wasquite draining already. If I went another rank higher, I\u2019m afraid that Iwould hurt myself. You should go and help me look for a few Third Ranksand bring them over. Wait for me to recover before I begin tamingthem.\u201d\u201cOkay then.\u201d Little Roar finished speaking and flew off again.Sima You Yue watched Little Roar abduct Spirit Beasts with such apa.s.sion and laughed as she shook her head. After that, she let Ya Guangprotect her as she closed her eyes to regain some of her exhaustedmental strength.It could be that it was the first time that she had finished using upher mental strength while taming so Sima You Yue had to use an entirenight in order to recover. It was only on the second day that shemanaged to completely recover. She directly used up an entire day\u2019sworth of time to tame those Spirit Beasts and another night to recover,repeating the cycle over and over again until she had finally completedtaming those few third ranked Saint Beasts.After that, she also cultivated a few Saint Beasts of first, secondand third rank and kept them all into her Spirit Pearl. In order toprevent them from knowing about the secret of her Spirit Pearl, she letLittle Spirit keep them alone in a particular area.\u201cMaster, you have already been stay here for almost half a month.\u201d YaGuang saw that Sima You Yue was more or less ready and that the SaintBeasts had already been more or less swept clean before speaking out toremind her.\u201cMm, we should leave soon.\u201d Sima You Yue nodded, \u201cNot sure how thecapital is like right now. Wait for Little Roar to come back then we canreturn.\u201dAfter speaking, she shouting for Little Roar a few times in her heartand told him that they were going to leave soon so he should come backquickly or else she would leave him behind without a care.\u201cCruel Yue Yue!\u201d Little Roar lamented before turning to the SpiritBeasts beside him that he was happily conversing with, saying, \u201cI haveto go. Sigh, don\u2019t miss me too much.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he flew back towards Sima You Yue,leaving behind a female Monkey that was looking at him, reluctant towatch him go.Sima You Yue could sense the situation that was happening at Little Roar\u2019s side and her whole face turned black.This guy, he actually went to go chase girls, uhm wrong, he went to chase Spirit Beasts!\u201cYue Yue, I\u2019m back!\u201d Little Roar came back and rolled in Sima You Yue\u2019s embrace.Sima You Yue lifted Little Roar up by his neck, right in front of her face and looked left and right.\u201cYue Yue, what are you looking at?\u201d Little Roar asked as he looked at Sima You Yue with large surprised eyes.\u201cI\u2019m checking to see whether or not you are really an ancient mythological beast!\u201d Sima You Yue said.Little Roar swung his head to the side and said with incomparable arrogance, \u201cAre you able to see it clearly?\u201d\u201cI only see a perverted beast!\u201d Sima You Yue flung Little Roar away and sat on Ya Guang\u2019s body, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dUpon receiving the order, Ya Guang stirred his limbs and started torun. Little Roar regained his balance in the air and saw that they hadleft first, complaining, \u201cActually treat a handsome and confidentancient mythological beast this way, really a woman with a poisonousheart! But other female animals are powerless against me, why is Yue Yuealways so violent? Could it be that she was a male in her past life?Not right, wasn\u2019t she also Yue Yue in her previous life. Sigh, soconfused\u2026\u201dBeing unable to come up with an answer, he saw that Sima You Yue andthe others had already ran very far so he rushed to catch up with them.He sat on Ya Guang\u2019s head and, with the att.i.tude of a commander, lookedtowards the front.With Ya Guang\u2019s speed, they very quickly arrived back at Salt City.Sima You Yue first went to look for the inn. She found out that SimaLie and the others had already left ten days ago so she directly went tothe Spirit Master Guild and took the Teleportation Array back to thecapital.One day later, Sima You Yue arrived at the capital and immediately headed straight for the General\u2019s residence.\u201cFifth Young Master, you\u2019re finally back.\u201d When the steward saw Sima You Yue, he ran over excitedly.\u201cHey hey, I\u2019m back. Where\u2019s Grandfather?\u201d Sima You Yue smiled as she asked.\u201cGeneral is in the hall.\u201d The steward replied.\u201cI\u2019ll go look for Grandfather.\u201d Sima You Yue walked off right after she spoke but was pulled back by the steward.\u201cFifth Young Master, it\u2019s better not to go right now. The people from the Nalan Clan are here.\u201d The steward said.\u201cPeople from the Nalan Clan are here? Is it Nalan He? What did they come for?\u201d Sima You Yue asked.Didn\u2019t she ask Bei Gong Tang and the others to cause trouble forNalan He and the others? How could they still have the time to come hereto find trouble?\u201cIt\u2019s not Nalan He, it\u2019s the Great Elder from the Nalan Clan who saidhe wants to see you.\u201d The steward said, \u201cHowever, the General has seenthat they look like they\u2019re up to no good and are afraid that it\u2019snothing good. He instructed us that if you were to come back, not to letyou go to the hall.\u201d\u201cGreat Elder?\u201d Sima You Yue searched for a Great Elder from the NalanClan from her memories, it was known that apart from their oldancestors, he was the strongest man who was most capable of breakingthrough to Spirit Saint.Sima You Yue had initially wanted to head to the Hall to take a peekat that Great Elder, but the steward would rather die than let go.Thinking about how Sima Lie was not unable to deal with an elder, shelet it go and turned around to return to her house.The steward looked over at the guard, hinting to him to let them knowwhen the people from the Nalan Clan had left before leaving togetherwith Sima You Yue.When she returned to her own house, seeing that the steward would not leave her, she didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.He still treated her as the same youth who would easily get hurt andwas afraid of her getting even a little hurt. This warmed her heart andshe kept the feeling in her heart.Thinking of the Nalan Clan, she smirked in her heart. She beamed atthe steward and said, \u201cSteward, didn\u2019t something happen to the NalanClan recently?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That incident involving the Nalan Clan was a secret to outsiders. If it were not for the fact that they were constantly observing the situation over at the Nalan Clan, they would not have known about it either.However, Fifth Young Master had just returned to the capital, right? How did he know?\"Cough cough, I just guessed randomly.\" Sima You Yue said, \"If not, the Great Elder of the Nalan Clan would not come to our home.\"\"We heard that Nalan He had gotten injured when he went to the Pu Luo Mountain Range. When he came back, he closed his doors and refused to come out. Only a few guards that went with him survived and returned. We don't know what they encountered either.\" The steward sighed, but his tone carried no small amount of joy.When she heard this piece of news, Sima You Yue's heart leapt with joy. She knew it; how could she possibly have miscalculated!\"Young Master, you've returned.\" Chun Jian and Yun Yue heard Sima You Yue's voice and came out from inside the house, looking at Sima You Yue with joy.After Sima You Yue had left, they didn't have anything much to do and the General allowed them to cultivate on their own. As a result, the strength of those two had soared within these few months.When Sima You Yue saw the two of them, she beamed and asked, \"Did the two of you miss this Young Master.\"\"Young Master, you're joking around again!\" Chun Jian smiled and replied.\"Young Master is frequently not at home, of course we would miss you.\" Yun Yue said, \"Young Master, how long are you planning to stay at home this time?\"\"I should be going to the academy tomorrow.\" Sima You Yue said, \"Your Young Master has seen that your strengths have risen by quite a bit. I'm not sure whether or not your culinary skills have improved as well? Go, prepare dinner for Young Master, I'm going to starve to death.\"Chun Jian and Yun Yue exchanged glances before saying simultaneously, \"Wait for a bit Young Master, your servant girls will go now to prepare it.\"After they finished speaking,the two of them bowed and excused themselves and headed to the kitchen to cook.Sima You Yue was ready to go back to the house and she saw the steward was still standing inside the house. She waved at him and said, \"You should go about doing your things. Since I've returned back to this place, I won't go and see that Nalan Clan's pickled old man anymore.\"The steward really did have things that he needed to do so he looked at her hesitantly, cupped his hands and said, \"Then this old servant will first withdraw.\"\"Go on, go on.\" Sima You Yue waved her hand. She waited for the steward to leave before she entered her own room.After a short moment, Chun Jian and Yun Yue brought her dinner in. When she saw the amazing and delicious meat and vegetable dishes, Sima You Yue could not help but to secretly nip some.\"Looks like your culinary skills didn\u2019t deteriorate even when this Young Master wasn't around!\"Hearing her compliment them, Chun Jian and Yun Yue broke out into smiles.\"Fifth Young Master.\"Just as Sima You Yue was ready to begin eating, a guard shouted from the house.Chun Jian went outside and very quickly returned back in, saying, \"Young Master, the Lord has called others to tell you to go over.\"Sima You Yue glanced at the dishes and sighed, saying, \"Wait for this Young Master to come back before I eat, then.\"\"Young Master, that guard said just now that the General pa.s.sed on the message to tell you to bring your dishes along with you.\" Chun Jian added.\"Oh. Bring it along with me, then.\"Sima You Yue went to Sima Lie's study room as Chun Jian carried the dishes and followed behind her. When they arrived at the Study Roo, Sima You Yue took the serving tray and hinted for Chun Jian to go back.The guard standing outside the Study Room had received the orders to open the doors for Sima You Yue when he saw her come over.Sima Lie was looking at something with his head lowered when he heard voices. Without raising his head, he said, \"Come sit down here and eat.\"Sima You Yue placed the food on the table and stretched forth and hand to take the letter in Sima Lie's hand. She placed a bowl of food into his hand and said, \"Since we're eating, there's no need to look at these things.\"Sima Lie let her place the letter in his hand to the said and ate dinner with her. After they finished eating, the servants kept the dishes away and poured a cup of tea for them.Sima You Yue looked at Sima Lie with some restlessness as she felt that some things were strange today. She had left for such a long time and they had just met but he didn't ask her what she had gone to do. He also did not tell her the reason why he had asked her to come, and it was only to accompany him to eat dinner and drink some tea.\"Cough cough, Grandfather, if there's nothing else then I will return first. I still have to head to the academy tomorrow.\" Sima You Yue caught the first sign of Sima Lie getting angry and wanted to use this as an opportunity to escape.\"No rush, there's still a lot of time before tomorrow comes.\" Sima Lie drank a mouthful of tea and slowly placed the teacup down.\"Oh.\" Sima You Yue picked up the cup of tea and drank from it. Sima Lie didn't speak and neither did she.\"People from the Nalan Clan came today.\" Ultimately, it was still Sima Lie who could not hold back and spoke first.\"I heard.\" Sima You Yue nodded and added on before lapsing into silence again.Sima Lie looked at Sima You Yue with some suspicion in his heart. In the past, whenever something was up, she would definitely get to the bottom of things but she was so quiet today, so even though he wanted to reprimand her, he was unable to say it.He lamented in his heart that he was really unable to scold her at all!\"You should know the reason why they came, right?\" Sima Lie said.\"Eh, no I don't.\" Sima You Yue said, \"The steward didn't tell me.\"\"They want to go after you.\" Sima You Yue stared at Sima You Yue as if he wanted to ascertain something from her expression. However, Sima You Yue's expression did not change at all and she didn't reveal any guilty conscience at all. As a result, he directly asked her, \"They said that you killed Nalan Qi and want me to surrender you and pay with your life.\"Sima You Yue heard this and secretly mused that it really was something related to Nalan Qi. However, didn't something happen to Nalan He? How would they still have the mood to come and find trouble with her?\"Hey hey, based on what would they say that I went to kill someone for no rhyme or reason!\" She smiled lightly.\"Based on what you're saying, it's true?\" Sima Lie said.Sima You Yue nodded. She never thought of keeping this from Sima Lie and said, \"It happened on the morning of that day when I left the home. On the road to school, he brought a guard who was a Spirit Master to specially to come and kill me. It's just that he was killed by me in the end.\"Actually, on the morning of the day that Nalan Qi had been harmed, the guards that Sima Lie had sent to protect Sima You Yue had already told him everything that happened at the alley. Seeing that Sima You Yue did not hide it, Sima Lie said, \"Right now, the Nalan Clan is unable to find Nalan Qi's corpse. No matter who asks, you just have to refute them at it will be okay.\"\"Okay, I understand.\" Sima You Yue nodded.\"However, the reason I called you here today was not to talk about that.\" Sima Lie changed the topic of the conversation, \"Say it, is the latest situation that happened to the Nalan Clan caused by you?\"\"What situation?\" Sima You Yue had not yet recovered her senses as she raised her head and asked Sima Lie.\"That time, Nalan He had gone to the Pu Luo Mountain Range to fight for the Golden Snake Fruit and on the way back, he kept being chased by different Spirit Beasts who tried to kill him. Does this have anything to do with you?\"Sima You Yue's heart pounded; how did he know?Thinking about how she couldn\u2019t let him know she had gone to fight for the Golden Snake Fruit, she shook her head and denied it, \"Grandfather, how can this situation with the Nalan Clan have anything to do with me?! Who knows whether they were constantly chased because they had gone to provoke whatever Spirit Beasts.\"\"Enough, stop babbling.\" Sima Lie said, \"I already saw you all!\"What?!Sima You Yue was truly flabbergasted this time, could it be that, despite their disguises back then, they were still recognised?Can\u2019t wait for your next dose?
